11 Jets With Tail Glitch Grounded
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
	   LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Airlines temporarily grounded 11 more jets Saturday
under a government order to examine tail wings for a problem that may have
caused an Alaska Airlines jet to crash two weeks ago. Since Thursday, at least
21 planes have been found to have irregularities with tail wing jackscrews, the
2-foot-long rods that drive the stabilizers that keep planes level, according to
numbers from the Federal Aviation Administration and airlines. The jackscrew
recovered from the submerged wreckage of Alaska Airlines Flight 261 had damaged
threads and metal shavings.

Reform Party Names Choate Chairman
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
	   NASHVILLE, Tenn. (AP) -- Ross Perot's Reform Party ousted party chairman
Jack Gargan, an ally of dissident Jesse Ventura, during a Saturday showdown that
exploded almost immediately with raw hostility and scuffling. At one point,
local police threatened to shut down the proceedings, organizers said. The
committee, by a 109-31 vote, ousted Gargan on a motion that said "he has failed
to faithfully perform and execute the duties of his office." One person
abstained. They picked Pat Choate, who was Perot's running mate in 1996 to be
the new chairman, by a 101-29 margin.

Poll: Bush, McCain Tied in S.C.

<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- A Newsweek poll released today shows Republican
presidential hopefuls John McCain and George W. Bush locked in a dead heat in a
campaign to win the South Carolina primary in a week. The Texas governor was
supported by 43 percent and McCain, a senator from Arizona, was supported by 40
percent in the poll conducted Wednesday through Friday. The poll supported the
McCain camp's belief that it will need a heavy turnout of independents to win in
the state. McCain got the backing of 55 percent of independents in the poll,
while Bush was backed by 53 percent of Republicans.

Cyanide Spill Hits Yugoslav Town
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
	   BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) -- In what may be Europe's worst environmental
disaster since Chernobyl, a cyanide spill contaminating a major river has moved
into Yugoslavia and destroyed all life in the water, local officials said
Saturday. The spill originated in northwest Romania, near the border town of
Oradea, where a dam at the Baia Mare gold mine overflowed Jan. 30 and caused
cyanide to pour into streams. From there, the polluted water flowed west into
the Tisa River in neighboring Hungary and then on into Yugoslavia. Eighty
percent of the fish in the Tisa have died since the contaminant entered the
country two days ago.

Banks Urge Internet in Poor Nations

	   TOKYO (AP) -- Japan's Softbank Corp. and a unit of the World Bank said
Saturday they will invest $500 million in Internet startups in developing
nations. The International Finance Corp. and Softbank will set up Softbank
Emerging Markets to provide technological, legal and management support to
Internet business entrepreneurs in the developing world, they said in a
statement. Softbank holds stakes in more than 300 Internet companies. IFC
finances private sector investments in the developing world. Their investment
will help bridge the technology gap between rich and poor nations by lowering
Internet access costs, they said.

Harvey Gets NAACP Best Actor Award
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
	   PASADENA, Calif. (AP) -- Steve Harvey took best actor in a television comedy
series Saturday during the 31st NAACP Image Awards, saying the honor meant much
more to him than others because of the organization presenting the award.
Earlier, the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People
announced that a shortage of minority characters in television made it difficult
for Image Award organizers to select nominees in the TV categories this year.
The NAACP has confronted the networks for months about the lack of minority
characters.

	   IRVING, Texas (AP) -- Tom Landry, the Dallas Cowboys coach who led America's
Team to five Super Bowls and was famous for pacing the sidelines for three
decades wearing a stone face, business suit and felt hat, died Saturday. He was
75. Landry had been undergoing treatment since May for acute myelogenous
leukemia. He died at Baylor University Medical Center about 6 p.m. CST,
surrounded by his family. Landry, who coached the Cowboys for their first 29
years, won two Super Bowls with star quarterback Roger Staubach.

Blackhawks defeated Atlanta 4-3 today and extended the Thrashers' winless streak
to 13. Dean McAmmond, Tony Amonte and Steve Sullivan also scored for the
Blackhawks, while Michael Nylander added three assists.

<HEADLINE> Late Falls Cost Cohen and Hughes  </HEADLINE>
By TOM WITHERS-
AP Sports Writer-
<TEXT>
<P>
	CLEVELAND (AP) -- Their time will come, but teen-agers Sasha Cohen and Sarah
Hughes learned a tough lesson Saturday night: Ice is slippery and so are the
standings.
</P>
<P>
	Cohen, the doll-like 15-year-old, looked as if she might unseat defending
national champion Michelle Kwan in the U.S. Figure Stating Championships until a
fall on her final jump dropped her to a second-place finish.
</P>
<P>
	Hughes, a graceful 14-year-old, finished third despite a strong program during
which she was the only skater to attempt and land a triple-triple combination.
</P>
<P>
	``It's not easy to compete at the nationals,'' Hughes said.
</P>
<P>
	And it doesn't get much easier -- just ask Kwan, who now has four U.S. titles,
but is sitting on a very shaky throne.
</P>
<P>
	Cohen and Hughes won't have long to wait, they are clearly the sport's future
in this country. But for at least another year, Kwan is still U.S. skating's
first lady.
</P>
<P>
	Cohen, the leader following Friday night's short program, had a few missteps
early on. But except for doubling a triple lutz, appeared to be on her way to a
surprising gold medal.
</P>
<P>
	Following a double axel about two-thirds through her program, Cohen allowed
herself a quick, satisfied smile. But moments later, she fell while attempting a
triple toe loop, a slip-up that brought a frown.
</P>
<P>
	``I'm happy with the way I skated, but disappointed with the last jump,'' she
said. ``I was a little tired and had an outward lean. I just couldn't save it at
the very end.''
</P>
<P>
	However, it may have saved Kwan.
</P>
<P>
	Cohen's speed and amazing flexibility had made her the crowd favorite. They
oohed and aahed at her tight jumps and were ready to jump from their seats
before her faulty finish.
</P>
<P>
	``I'm proud I skated great for myself and that I attacked the jumps,'' she
said.
</P>
<P>
	Hughes, second after the short program, skated first in the final group.
Following a double axel, she executed a strong triple-triple, and it became
evident throughout her program that Hughes had made tremendous improvements in
her artistry after finishing fourth at nationals last year.
</P>
<P>
	Skating to Puccini's ``Turnadot'', Hughes' solid jumps were complemented by her
improved presentation and she was clean until the final minute of her
performance, when she crashed on a triple salchow.
</P>
<P>
	``I had a little trouble at the end, that was obvious,'' she said. ``I fought
through the program and tried to make every moment count. If I didn't I would
regret it later.''
</P>
<P>
	Her coach, Robin Wagner, thought Hughes might have just gotten a little
careless at the end.
</P>
<P>
	``I think it being the last jump she might have lost her focus a little bit,''
Wagner said.
</P>
<P>
	Two costly falls for two rising stars.

<HEADLINE> Cleveland Eager for More Skating  </HEADLINE>
By TOM WITHERS-
AP Sports Writer-
<TEXT>
<P>
	CLEVELAND (AP) -- It's probably safe to assume Cleveland won't have to wait
another 36 years to be host of another U.S. Figure Skating Championships.
</P>
<P>
	This sports-crazed city, better known for its barking football fans and
baseball fans who have sold out Jacobs Field for every Indians game since 1997,
has received high scores from skaters, coaches, officials and out-of-town media
for this week's event.
</P>
<P>
	``Our goal was to host the best nationals ever,'' said Terry Collar, president
of Cleveland Championships 2000. ``And we've heard from some of the competitors
that that's exactly what it's been.''
</P>
<P>
	Cleveland had not held the nationals since 1964, when Peggy Fleming won the
first of her five U.S. titles at the Cleveland Arena.
</P>
<P>
	This year's week-long event has been a smashing success.
</P>
<P>
	There weren't seating problems like the ones that plagued Salt Lake City last
year. Transportation was adequate and the Gund Arena ice got rave reviews.
</P>
<P>
	Through Saturday's men's championship competition, more than 127,000 tickets
had been sold, eclipsing the record of 115,000 at the 1996 nationals in San
Jose.
</P>
<P>
	Even the novice ice dancing competition drew overflow crowds at the host club,
the Winterhurst Figure Skating Club.
</P>
<P>
	``We wanted to put rear ends in the seats,'' said Collar, who credited a strong
marketing push for filling the arena.
</P>
<P>
	The organizing committee's other goals were to showcase Cleveland as a
championship city and to hopefully convince the skating community it could
handle the World Figure Skating Championships.
</P>
<P>
	Cleveland was beaten in its bid for the 2003 worlds, losing out to
Baltimore/Washington.
</P>
<P>
	``We were told the reason we didn't get it was because we hadn't done the
nationals,'' Collar said. ``Well, now we have.''
</P>
<P>
	Collar said the success of this year's event is helping Cleveland shed its
national reputation as a crumbling steel town. When the city first began trying
to land a national championship in 1994, Collar said there was still resistance
to bringing anything here.
</P>
<P>
	``We were still fighting that burning-river syndrome,'' he said. ``But every
time something good like this happens in Cleveland, it's good for the city.''
</P>
<P>
	No longer the Mistake on the Lake, Cleveland proved it can skate.
</P>
<P>
	Boston will be the site of nationals next year, with Los Angeles set for 2002,
the Olympic trials.
</P>
<P>
	-------
</P>
<P>
	WORLD TEAMS: At least Sasha Cohen got a nice consolation prize. Maybe.
</P>
<P>
	Cohen, who finished second Saturday night at the U.S. Figure Skating
Championships, was selected for the world championships team. But because she
was born too late to be eligible for worlds, she must finish in the top three at
junior worlds in three weeks to qualify.
</P>
<P>
	Four-time U.S. champion Michelle Kwan will lead the contingent to Nice, France.
Sarah Hughes, who was third Saturday night, also will go because of her strong
showings at last year's junior and senior worlds.
</P>
<P>
	If Cohen can't go to Nice, Angela Nikodinov will replace her.
</P>
<P>
	Two-time U.S. champion Michael Weiss will be joined by a familiar face at the
Four Continents event in two weeks in Osaka, Japan.
</P>
<P>
	Five-time American champ Todd Eldredge, who has kept his Olympic eligibility
but skipped competing on the circuit for nearly two years, will go. So will
Trifun Zivanovic, who was third Saturday at nationals.
</P>
<P>
	Eldredge last skated in an ISU-series event against eligible skaters at the
1998 worlds.
</P>
<P>
	Weiss and runner-up Timothy Goebel will go to worlds.
</P>
<P>
	The Four Continents competition is for skaters from North America, Asia, Africa
and Australia.
</P>
<P>
	Also chosen for Four Continents were the same couples that will go to the world
championships in Nice, France, late next month. Pairs champions Kyoko Ina and
John Zimmerman will join runners-up Tiffany Scott and Philip Dulebohn in Osaka.
Also going are dance champs Naomi Lang and Peter Tchernyshev, and runners-up
Jamie Silverstein and Justin Pekarek.
</P>
<P>
	Hughes, Nikodinov and Andrea Gardiner also were chosen for Four Continents.
</P>
<P>
	-------
</P>
<P>
	HEY, WHERE'S ALEC? Hollywood has the acting Baldwins. This week, Cleveland had
the figure skating Baldwins.
</P>
<P>
	All three of Donna and John Baldwin's children competed at the U.S. Figure
Skating Championships. John Jr. and Don competed in senior men's, while Donna
was in junior ice dance with Zachary Fix.
</P>
<P>
	If that didn't make things hectic enough, the parents coach the two boys.
</P>
<P>
	``We're lucky there are two of us,'' the elder John Baldwin said with a laugh.
</P>
<P>
	The Baldwins left daughter Donna in the hands of her coach for practices,
though they made sure they were on hand for each of her events. They made all
but one of their sons' practices, and the lone miss came because one of Don's
free skate practice sessions conflicted with Donna's compulsory dance
competition.
</P>
<P>
	Still, they managed to catch glimpses of Don's workout.
</P>
<P>
	``Donnie was doing his long program in the second Winterhurst rink,'' said
Donna Baldwin, the mother. ``We could hear his music and every time he did a
triple, we could see his head.''
</P>
<P>
	This was the third time all three Baldwins were at nationals, completing the
trifecta in 1993 and 1996.

<TEXT>
<P>
    SALT LAKE CITY (AP) -- Alex Jensen scored eight of his 16 points in a key
second-half run as No. 21 Utah beat Brigham Young 77-62 on Saturday night,
extending the Cougars' home winning streak to 50.
</P>
<P>
	   Nathan Cooper brought BYU (15-6, 4-4 Mountain West) within 56-52 with 8:49
remaining on his third 3-pointer of the half. But Jensen, who had only four
points at the time, scored eight points and Jeremy Killion added a driving layup
in a 10-3 spurt to give Utah a 66-55 cushion with 6:05 to play.
</P>
<P>
	   Harvey made a 3-pointer, and Wesley, who had a technical foul earlier in the
second half, was whistled for an intentional foul for an elbow to Phil Cullen's
chin. Cullen made both free throws and Utah led 71-56 with 5:01 remaining.
</P>
<P>
	   The Utes (19-4, 8-1 MWC), who played without injured leading scorer Hanno
Mottola, have won 17 of their last 19 games and have not lost at the Huntsman
Center since Dec. 31, 1996, against Wake Forest.
</P>
<P>
	   Killion led Utah with 18 points, Nate Althoff had 15 and Tony Harvey added
14. Freshman Mike Puzey scored a season-high 10 points and grabbed seven
rebounds before earning a standing ovation when he fouled out with 5:51 to play.
</P>
<P>
	   Wesley and Terrell Lyday each scored 14 points for BYU, but collectively
shot 7-of-22. Cooper scored 11 for the Cougars, who have lost three of their
last four games.
</P>
<P>
	   The win marks the first time the Utes have a winning series record with BYU,
Utah's oldest rival. Utah leads 114-113 in the series that dates to 1908.
</P>
<P>
	   BYU took a 19-8 lead after eight points from Wesley and a jumper by Todd
Christensen. But the Ute defense clamped down and the Cougars shot 2-of-13 as
Utah made its move.
</P>
<P>
	   Sparked by the seldom-used Puzey, who had eight points and five rebounds in
the first half, the Utes outscored BYU 18-3 over the next seven minutes.
</P>
<P>
	   Puzey, who had only scored nine total points in conference games, made a
layup with 6:33 left in the half to put Utah up 26-22.
</P>
<P>
	   Mottola is listed as game-to-game with torn ligaments in his left elbow and
right thumb. Team doctors ruled out season-ending surgery Thursday.
</P>
<P>
	   Utah hasn't lost a conference game at the Huntsman Center in more than four
years.

<HEADLINE> Outgoing IMF Chief Hit With Pie  </HEADLINE>
    By NAOMI KOPPEL Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) -- The outgoing chief of the International Monetary
Fund got a rude retirement present Sunday when an American anti-free trade
activist penetrated security at a trade conference and hit him with a pie in the
face.
</P>
<P>
	   Moments before Michel Camdessus was to deliver his last speech as IMF
chairman, the activist hurled a fruit-and-cream pie inside the meeting hall
where some 190 nations are holding the U.N. Conference on Trade and Development.
</P>
<P>
	   The action left Camdessus -- seen by many activists as Public Enemy No. 1
for dictating financial policies to poor countries -- and Thailand's
tough-talking security officials with pie on their faces.
</P>
<P>
	   Camdessus has been a prime target of both Thai and foreign anti-free trade
activists gathered in Bangkok to demonstrate at the conference, seeking to
repeat protests that derailed the World Trade Organization summit in Seattle
last year.
</P>
<P>
	   The pie-thrower, who identified himself as Robert Reuel Naiman, 34, of
Washington, D.C., said he performed the stunt to give the IMF chief "a friendly
reminder of what we think of his policies and to give a warning to his successor
we expect different policies."
</P>
<P>
	   Camdessus was chatting to delegates in the main conference hall before
making a keynote speech when Naiman snuck up beside him and threw a pie with a
shout of "Happy Birthday!"
</P>
<P>
	   "It was a small cake, very tasty," Naiman told the ITV television network
before he was taken away by security.
</P>
<P>
	   Naiman had managed to sneak his projectile through a tight security cordon
around the Queen Sirikit Convention Center, the site of the conference. Thai
police have kept demonstrators away from the immediate area.
</P>
<P>
	   Naiman was being questioned by U.N. security officials inside the center.
National Police Chief Gen. Pracha Promnok said it would be up to the United
Nations if they wished to file criminal charges and prosecute him.
</P>
<P>
	   "I'm disappointed," said Foreign Minister Surin Pitsuwan. "It's absolutely
impossible to prevent such an incident. We have left no stone unturned in our
planning and preparation. We have been able to prevent bigger problems."
</P>
<P>
	   The Brussels-based group said it had staged similar attacks at international
conferences and called the attack a "slight and sweet embarrassment" compared to
the tremendous suffering inflicted on poor countries by the IMF.
</P>
<P>
	   Naiman, who described himself only as a "private citizen," said that he had
been at the WTO meeting in Seattle, which ended in acrimony when anti-free trade
activists clashed violently with police.

Utah's oldest rival. Utah leads 114-113 in the series that dates to 1908.

Christensen. But the Ute defense clamped down and the Cougars shot 2-of-13 as
Utah made its move.

the first half, the Utes outscored BYU 18-3 over the next seven minutes.

layup with 6:33 left in the half to put Utah up 26-22.

years.

<HEADLINE> Olympics Race Toward Blood Testing  </HEADLINE>
By JOHN PYE-
Associated Press Writer-
<TEXT>
<P>
	SYDNEY, Australia (AP) -- Australian Olympic Committee president John Coates is
confident blood testing for drug use will be introduced before the start of the
Olympics in September.
</P>
<P>
	Coates said SOCOG and the International Olympic Committee are committed to
implementing blood testing to stamp out the use of erythropoietin (EPO), a
banned performance-enhancing hormone that is undetectable using current tests.
</P>
<P>
	Speaking Sunday after the IOC's Coordination Committee meetings, Coates said
researchers at the Australian Institute of Sport were on the verge of producing
a reliable blood test.
</P>
<P>
	``There is a political will on behalf of the IOC to have blood testing if it's
available,'' he said. ``I'm hopeful (a test for EPO will be available) and so is
the AIS.''
</P>
<P>
	Coordination Commission chairman Jacques Rogge isn't as sure.
</P>
<P>
	Rogge said the IOC had provided the AIS with a $1 million grant to develop a
test for EPO and he was pleased with the progress.
</P>
<P>
	``We're not quite sure if we'll have a test in time for Sydney -- there are
many legal and scientific issues that need to be resolved,'' he said. ``But
we're working hard.''
</P>
<P>
	Rogge said at least 2,000 athletes would be subjected to routine tests, which
use urine samples as controls, during the Olympics regardless of the
availability of blood testing.
</P>
<P>
	He also said between 200 and 400 athletes would be randomly subjected to doping
tests from Sept. 2 in the buildup to the Games.
</P>
<P>
	Coates, who is also vice-president of SOCOG, said the Australian Sports Drug
Agency would be contracted to undertake the pre-Games tests and it was already
prepared to use blood testing, if it was approved, as well as traditional
methods.

<HEADLINE> Camdessus Defends IMF in Speech  </HEADLINE>
    By NAOMI KOPPEL Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) -- Giving his last speech as chief of the
International Monetary Fund, Michel Camdessus used the occasion Sunday to
counter claims that his organization has ignored the concerns of ordinary
people.
</P>
<P>
	   Camdessus said foreign investment in the Third World has enormous potential
to close the income gap, while information technology has given poor nations
access to knowledge that was once the preserve of the rich.
</P>
<P>
	   "Globalization can now be seen in a positive light ... as the best means of
improving the human condition throughout the world," he said.
</P>
<P>
	   Camdessus, 66, retiring after heading the IMF since 1987, spoke at the U.N.
Conference on Trade and Development shortly after an American anti-free trade
activist threw a pie in his face in protest against the IMF.
</P>
<P>
	   He spoke without mentioning the attack but was passionate in his defense of
the fund's goal of stabilizing the global financial system as a prerequisite for
reducing inequality in wealth.
</P>
<P>
	   "Macroeconomic stability is clearly necessary for growth and hence poverty
alleviation," Camdessus told delegates from some 190 countries gathered for the
eight-day meeting. UNCTAD aims to use trade to promote development in poor
countries.
</P>
<P>
	   Camdessus postponed a news conference that had been scheduled after his
speech, which itself was delayed for half an hour after the pie-throwing
incident.
</P>
<P>
	   Critics of the IMF's bailout packages of Asian countries during the recent
regional economic crisis see the Washington-based fund as a symbol of how
globalization has benefitted rich countries at the expense of the poor.
</P>
<P>
	   In Thailand, which will leave its IMF-brokered $17.2 billion economic
bailout package in June, many people claim the fund's insistence on high
interest rates to restore financial stability deepened recession, leading to
heavy job losses.

<HEADLINE> Carter Exhibits Slam Dunk Grace  </HEADLINE>
    By RICK GANO AP Sports Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   OAKLAND, Calif. (AP) -- Vince Carter won the NBA slam dunk contest Saturday
night with a riveting above-the-rim demonstration that was almost perfect.
</P>
<P>
	   The Toronto Raptors star scored a perfect 50 on three of his five attempts
and got a 49 and 48 on the other two to defeat teammate Tracy McGrady and Steve
Francis for the title.
</P>
<P>
	   Carter used a unique hanger on his first dunk of the final round, driving
the ball down and then clinging on the rim from the crook of his elbow. It
brought him his third 50 of the night.
</P>
<P>
	   "It was something different and I didn't know how the judges would react,"
Carter said, still trying to gather himself after winning the competition.
</P>
<P>
	   "It's unbelievable. It hasn't sunk in yet. I'm having trouble. I just
remember back in the days when me and my friends used to tape the dunk contests
and watch them over and over."
</P>
<P>
	   On his final dunk, Carter went sailing down the floor and took off just
inside the free-throw line for a two-handed stuff that earned him a 48 and a
final round 98, enough to beat Francis.
</P>
<P>
	   Francis finished the final round with 91 points and McGrady 77 after missing
his final attempt.
</P>
<P>
	   Carter said the final dunk was an attempt to duplicate one of Julius
Erving's most famous dunks when he took off from the foul line.
</P>
<P>
	   "I wasn't too happy with it, but I'll take it," Carter said. "I wish I could
have tried it again. I think I would have done better."
</P>
<P>
	   Carter set the tone with his first dunk of the night. He did a 360-degree
spin to his right in the lane and then brought ball up from his right hip before
powering it through the basket, sending the crowd into a frenzy and getting a
perfect 50.
</P>
<P>
	   Toronto teammate McGrady matched the 50 on his final dunk of the first
round, catching the ball after it bounced high on the floor and then making a
double clutch stuff.
</P>
<P>
	   But on Carter's third and final dunk of the first round it was apparent he
would be almost impossible to beat.
</P>
<P>
	   He took a bounce pass from McGrady -- one first-round dunk had to be done in
coordination with a teammate -- brought the ball under his right leg while he
was in the air and then slammed it through. It brought the judges out of their
seats and one of them, Isiah Thomas, jumped on the scorer's table to cheer.
</P>
<P>
	   "It made me say ohh, it made me saw ahh and then I just jumped," Thomas
said.
</P>
<P>
	   The popular contest was revived this year for the first time since 1997.
</P>
<P>
	   Each dunk is scored from six to 10 by each judge. The first-round score is
based on a composite with the lowest score excluded and three of the six
contestants advancing to the finals.
</P>
<P>
	   Judges were Thomas, Cynthia Cooper, Rick Barry, George "Ice Man" Gervin and
Kenny Smith.
</P>
<P>
	   With the lowest of three first-round scores eliminated, Carter had a
first-round 100 to advance with McGrady (99) and Francis (95). Eliminated were
Ricky Davis of Charlotte, Jerry Stackhouse of Detroit and Philadelphia's Larry
Hughes, who missed his first two attempts.

<HEADLINE> No. 24 Oregon 64, California 60  </HEADLINE>
    By ROB GLOSTER AP Sports Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   BERKELEY, Calif. (AP) -- Oregon finally can go home, and with a big win.
</P>
<P>
	   A.D. Smith and Alex Scales had 21 points each as the No. 24 Ducks defeated
California 64-60 Saturday night to wrap up a brutal two-week trip with a split.
</P>
<P>
	   Scales hit a 3-pointer with 28 seconds remaining and Darius Wright added
three late free throws to seal the win as Oregon (17-5, 8-3 Pac-10) recovered
from a 15-point loss at No. 2 Stanford on Thursday night.
</P>
<P>
	   The victory wrapped up a trip that began with a loss at No. 9 Arizona and a
win at Arizona State. The Ducks, in third place in the Pac-10, play five of
their seven remaining games at home.
</P>
<P>
	   Sean Lampley had 18 points and Shantay Legans added 13 for California (14-9,
5-6), which had a three-game winning streak snapped. Cal had won three straight
close games -- all by four points or fewer -- coming into the contest.
</P>
<P>
	   Leading 33-27 at halftime, Oregon extended its lead to 41-31 as Smith scored
the Ducks' first eight points of the second half. A 3-pointer by Scales gave the
Ducks a 46-34 lead before Cal scored nine straight points to pull within three.
</P>
<P>
	   Scales then scored all of Oregon's points on a 6-2 run that increased the
lead to 52-45 with 5:33 remaining. But, a minute later, Lampley had a run of
five straight points that pulled the Bears within a point at 54-53.
</P>
<P>
	   The Oregon lead still was one point when Scales hit a 3-pointer from the top
of the key with 28 seconds left to give the Ducks some breathing room.
</P>
<P>
	   Oregon improved to 7-3 on the road this season. The Ducks have not won more
than seven road games in a season since 1951-52.
</P>
<P>
	   Oregon missed its first eight shots of the game and made just one of its
first 11, but finally warmed up and used an 11-0 run midway through the first
half to take a 33-27 halftime lead. Smith had 11 in the first half to lead the
Ducks.

11 Jets With Tail Glitch Grounded
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
	   LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Airlines temporarily grounded 11 more jets Saturday
under a government order to examine tail wings for a problem that may have
caused an Alaska Airlines jet to crash two weeks ago. Since Thursday, at least
21 planes have been found to have irregularities with tail wing jackscrews, the
2-foot-long rods that drive the stabilizers that keep planes level, according to
numbers from the Federal Aviation Administration and airlines. The jackscrew
recovered from the submerged wreckage of Alaska Airlines Flight 261 had damaged

	   NASHVILLE, Tenn. (AP) -- Ross Perot's Reform Party ousted party chairman
Jack Gargan, an ally of dissident Jesse Ventura, during a Saturday showdown that
exploded almost immediately with raw hostility and scuffling. At one point,
local police threatened to shut down the proceedings, organizers said. The
committee, by a 109-31 vote, ousted Gargan on a motion that said "he has failed
to faithfully perform and execute the duties of his office." One person
abstained. They picked Pat Choate, who was Perot's running mate in 1996, to be
the new chairman, by a 101-29 margin.

presidential hopefuls John McCain and George W. Bush locked in a dead heat in a
campaign to win the South Carolina primary in a week. The Texas governor was
supported by 43 percent and McCain, a senator from Arizona, was supported by 40
percent in the poll conducted Wednesday through Friday. The poll supported the
McCain camp's belief that it will need a heavy turnout of independents to win in
the state. McCain got the backing of 55 percent of independents in the poll,
while Bush was backed by 53 percent of Republicans.

Cyanide Spill Devastates Yugoslavia

	   BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) -- In what may be Europe's worst environmental
disaster since Chernobyl, a cyanide spill contaminating a major river has moved
into Yugoslavia and destroyed all life in the water, local officials said
Saturday. The spill originated in northwest Romania, near the border town of
Oradea, where a dam at the Baia Mare gold mine overflowed Jan. 30 and caused
cyanide to pour into streams. From there, the polluted water flowed west into
the Tisa River in neighboring Hungary and then on into Yugoslavia. Eighty
percent of the fish in the Tisa have died since the contaminant entered the

<TEXT>
<P>
	   PASADENA, Calif. (AP) -- Steven Spielberg, whose conscience-raising films
include "Schindler's List," "Saving Private Ryan" and "Amistad," was honored by
the NAACP for promoting social justice at the organization's 31st Image Awards
on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
	   "This is the first time I've been out since my operation and it feels like a
dream, an absolute dream," Spielberg said.
</P>
<P>
	   Last week, a kidney was removed from the 53-year-old director after doctors
found an irregularity.
</P>
<P>
	   Spielberg joked about how he explained to his children that he was forgoing
rest to accept the NAACP Vanguard Award, which honored him for "his pioneering
courage to promote social justice through creative endeavors."
</P>
<P>
	   "A couple of days ago, I was in the hospital," Spielberg said. "I kinda just
told them, I was coming here to accept the 'Will Smith Vanguard Award' and they
understood that."
</P>
<P>
	   Smith, an actor and singer, picked up his own Image Awards for the music to
the movie "Wild West," in which he starred. The movie also earned him awards for
outstanding rap artist and outstanding music video.
</P>
<P>
	   Steve Harvey took best actor in a television comedy series, and said the
honor meant much more to him than others because of the organization presenting
the award.
</P>
<P>
	   "This is from us, for us, that's why it means something to me," said Harvey
of "The Steve Harvey Show," in which he plays the vice principal of an urban
high school. The series appears on the Warner Bros. WB television network.
</P>
<P>
	   Best actresses in a comedy series went to twins Tia and Tamera Mowry for
their roles in "Sister, Sister," also on the WB network.
</P>
<P>
	   Singer Smokey Robinson was inducted into the Image Awards Hall of Fame.
</P>
<P>
	   Earlier, the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People
announced that a shortage of minority characters in television made it difficult
for Image Award organizers to select nominees in the TV categories this year.
</P>
<P>
	   The NAACP has confronted the networks for months about the lack of minority
characters.
</P>
<P>
	   The issue of minorities in the entertainment industry came to a boil in July
when NAACP and a coalition of Hispanic groups condemned a near-total lack of
minority characters in fall series. The groups threatened lawsuits and boycotts.
</P>
<P>
	   But within the past months, NAACP officials met with TV network executives
who promised to work toward enhancing diversity on their shows.
</P>
<P>
	   In the television categories, CBS had 18 nominations. ABC was next with 15,
followed by HBO with 14, Warner Bros. with 12 and NBC with 10.
</P>
<P>
	   Although CBS had the most nominations, critics say both CBS and Fox are not
putting enough minorities to work in television. Both networks recently
announced that they will have more minority characters this fall.
</P>
<P>
	   Agreements by Fox and CBS are similar to those signed by NBC and ABC last
month, focusing on changes in minority representation through the companies --
both on-screen and off.
</P>
<P>
	   The 31st NAACP Image Awards, which honors minorities in film, television,
music and literature, took place Friday and Saturday at the Pasadena Civic
Auditorium.
</P>
<P>
	   On Friday, CBS won for outstanding drama series for "Touched by an Angel,"
co-starring Della Reese. Fox took the outstanding variety series or special for
"1999 Essence Awards." Civil rights heroine Rosa Parks won for supporting
actress in a drama series for her appearance on "Touched by an Angel."
</P>
<P>
	   Angela Bassett won outstanding supporting actress in the motion picture,
"Music of the Heart." Halle Berry won outstanding actress in a television movie,
mini-series or dramatic special for the lead role in "Introducing Dorothy
Dandridge," an HBO movie about the first black woman nominated for an Academy
Award as best actress. Berry also won a Golden Globe for her role.
</P>
<P>
	   The Image Awards show is scheduled to air April 6 on Fox.

<HEADLINE> Media Execs Debate Ethics in D.C.  </HEADLINE>
    By GARRETT THEROLF Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Media executives at a National Press Club panel grappled
Saturday with the difficulty of delivering accurate news to a skeptical public
while at the same time coping with the competitive pressures of media outlets
moving at ever-faster speeds.
</P>
<P>
	   "News is everywhere," said Louis D. Boccardi, president and CEO of The
Associated Press. "The public just can't get away from it."
</P>
<P>
	   He noted that surveys often show the public saying they were overloaded with
news coverage, but at the same time "the audience figures were just phenomenal"
for some of those same stories.
</P>
<P>
	   Other members of the 12-member panel on media ethics emphasized that many of
the problems they face are derived from the fact that the ways journalists use
to get this massive amount of news to their audience are quicker, and sometimes
hastier, than more traditional mediums of the past.
</P>
<P>
	   Veteran Washington Post political reporter David Broder said the speed with
which the new media moves creates a "problem for our credibility and trust."
</P>
<P>
	   Broder said the quick pace of developing stories with the advent of cable
television news and the resulting 24-hour news cycle often provides the public
with unchecked or inaccurate stories. He said he has not only seen his stories
go unedited onto the Post's Web site, but has seen similar situations involving
live television reports.
</P>
<P>
	   "I have been on the set ... when some 12-year old rushes a piece of copy to
the anchor people 3/8, they read it (on the air) and at the next commercial
break, having some sense of judgment and perspective, one or the other will say
'where the hell did that come from.'
</P>
<P>
	   "But by now it's out there in the ether," Broder said.
</P>
<P>
	   The annual National Roundtable was sponsored by the Scripps Howard
Foundation. It was carried live by C-SPAN and moderated by C-SPAN founder Brian
P. Lamb.

<HEADLINE> Wahid Says Wiranto Must Resign  </HEADLINE>
   By SLOBODAN LEKIC Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) -- Hours after returning from an overseas trip,
Indonesian President Abdurrahman Wahid held an emergency meeting Sunday with the
powerful security chief who has defied his demands to resign.
</P>
<P>
	   Senior Security and Political Affairs Minister Gen. Wiranto arrived at the
presidential palace in Jakarta with Vice President Megawati Sukarnoputri. They
declined to speak to reporters before being ushered into the president's office.
</P>
<P>
	   The three were originally scheduled to meet on Monday. Officials at the
palace said they did not know why the meeting occurred earlier. Indonesian
Attorney General Marzuki Darusman also attended the meeting.
</P>
<P>
	   Earlier Sunday, Wahid returned from a 16-day tour of the Middle East, Europe
and Asia. The trip was largely overshadowed by his long-range public squabble
with Wiranto, accused by Indonesian and United Nations human-rights panels of
overseeing violence in East Timor in his former role as armed forces commander.
</P>
<P>
	   Wiranto -- a former army chief -- refused to step down, fueling speculation
that the standoff could spark a coup.
</P>
<P>
	   Speaking on Saturday in Thailand, Wahid said Wiranto would either resign or
be sacked from the Cabinet for his role in last year's bloodshed, which racked
the former Indonesian province following an overwhelming vote for independence.
</P>
<P>
	   ``If he does not resign, I will change the Cabinet anyway, without him,''
Wahid said.
</P>
<P>
	   Two weeks ago, a government-sponsored human rights probe into the crisis in
East Timor recommended that Wiranto be formally investigated by state
prosecutors. The attorney general later said an investigation could take three
to six months.
</P>
<P>
	   Soon after the initial report was made public, Wahid announced he would
suspend Wiranto for the duration of the investigation and possibly a trial.
</P>
<P>
	   Wiranto, who like many Indonesians uses one name, has denied any wrongdoing
and repeatedly insisted he will not quit until he has a chance to present his
case to the president.
</P>
<P>
	   The general was a protege of Indonesia's former dictator Suharto. He was
given the post of security minister last October when Wahid took office.
</P>
<P>
	   Wiranto's relations with the reformist leader have become increasingly
strained because of the inability of the security forces to stem a rising wave
of religious and separatist violence throughout the island nation.

<HEADLINE> Coyotes 4, Flames 3  </HEADLINE>
    By MEL REISNER AP Sports Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   PHOENIX (AP) -- Jeremy Roenick scored two goals to lead the Phoenix Coyotes
to a 4-3 victory over the Calgary Flames on Saturday night.
</P>
<P>
	   The victory tied the Coyotes with the Dallas Stars for first place in the
Pacific Division.
</P>
<P>
	   Roenick's second goal -- his 26th of the season -- seemed unnecessary when
he put it in with 1:42 remaining. But it turned out to be his ninth game-winner
this season after the Flames finally solved Phoenix goalie Sean Burke and scored
twice in the final 1:11.
</P>
<P>
	   Steve Begin and Bill Lindsay, who got his goal with four seconds remaining,
scored on the last two shots by Calgary, which lost its third straight in an
0-7-1 skid.
</P>
<P>
	   Burke made 29 saves and won for the first time in three games since he was
sidelined one game with a groin strain.
</P>
<P>
	   Trevor Letowski scored short-handed for Phoenix's first goal, and Teppo
Numminen had two assists as the Coyotes snapped their two-game losing streak and
improved to 10-2-2 against the Flames since moving to Arizona in 1996.
</P>
<P>
	   Benoit Hogue also had two assists in his first game with the Coyotes since
signing as a free agent Feb. 3. He started on the third line, but moved up to
the first to play left wing when captain Keith Tkachuk aggravated an ankle
sprain.
</P>
<P>
	   The Flames got a power-play goal from Jarome Iginla in the first period, but
weren't able to get anything past Burke from then on until they scored with
their last two shots.
</P>
<P>
	   Roenick made it 3-1 with 5:14 left in the second period when he took a pass
from Numminen just outside the crease and flicked it behind Giguere.
</P>
<P>
	   Tocchet broke a 1-1 tie just 1:34 into the second, tapping in the rebound of
his own shot as he skated diagonally across the crease.
</P>
<P>
	   Both first-period goals came with a Calgary advantage.
</P>
<P>
	   Letowski's goal was his third short-handed goal this season and the NHL-best
11th for the Coyotes, breaking a deadlock with the St. Louis Blues.
</P>
<P>
	   He beat Giguere, who had 26 saves, with a 62-foot shot from just beyond the
blue line.

<HEADLINE> Outgoing IMF Chief Hit With Pie  </HEADLINE>
    By NAOMI KOPPEL Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) -- The outgoing chief of the International Monetary
Fund got a rude retirement present Sunday when an American anti-free trade
activist penetrated security at a trade conference and hit him with a pie in the
face.
</P>
<P>
	   Moments before Michel Camdessus was to deliver his last speech as IMF
chairman, the activist hurled a fruit-and-cream pie inside the meeting hall
where some 190 nations are holding the U.N. Conference on Trade and Development.
</P>
<P>
	   The action left Camdessus -- seen by many activists as Public Enemy No. 1
for dictating financial policies to poor countries -- and Thailand's
tough-talking security officials with pie on their faces.
</P>
<P>
	   Camdessus, 66, who is retiring after heading the IMF since 1987, gave a
scheduled speech afterward without mentioning the attack. A planned news
conference was postponed, however.
</P>
<P>
	   The IMF chairman has been a prime target of both Thai and foreign anti-free
trade activists gathered in Bangkok to demonstrate at the conference, seeking to
repeat protests that derailed the World Trade Organization summit in Seattle
last year.
</P>
<P>
	   The pie-thrower, who identified himself as Robert Reuel Naiman, 34, of
Washington, D.C., said he performed the stunt to give the IMF chief "a friendly
reminder of what we think of his policies and to give a warning to his successor
we expect different policies."
</P>
<P>
	   Camdessus was chatting to delegates in the main conference hall before
making a keynote speech when Naiman snuck up beside him and threw a pie with a
shout of "Happy Birthday!"
</P>
<P>
	   "It was a small cake, very tasty," Naiman told the ITV television network
before he was taken away by security.
</P>
<P>
	   Naiman had managed to sneak his projectile through a tight security cordon
around the Queen Sirikit Convention Center, the site of the conference. Thai
police have kept demonstrators away from the immediate area.
</P>
<P>
	   U.N. security officials decided not to press charges after questioning
Naiman, National Police Chief Pracha Promnok told reporters.
</P>
<P>
	   "I'm disappointed," said Foreign Minister Surin Pitsuwan. "It's absolutely
impossible to prevent such an incident. We have left no stone unturned in our
planning and preparation. We have been able to prevent bigger problems."
</P>
<P>
	   The Brussels-based group said it had staged similar attacks at international
conferences and called the attack a "slight and sweet embarrassment" compared to
the tremendous suffering inflicted on poor countries by the IMF.
</P>
<P>
	   Naiman, who described himself only as a "private citizen," said that he had
been at the WTO meeting in Seattle, which ended in acrimony when anti-free trade
activists clashed violently with police.

campaign to win the South Carolina primary in a week. The Texas governor was
supported by 43 percent and McCain, a senator from Arizona, was supported by 40
percent in the poll conducted Wednesday through Friday. The poll supported the
McCain camp's belief that it will need a heavy turnout of independents to win in
the state. McCain got the backing of 55 percent of independents in the poll,
while Bush was backed by 53 percent of Republicans.

Cyanide Spill Devastates Yugoslavia

	   BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) -- In what may be Europe's worst environmental
disaster since Chernobyl, a cyanide spill contaminating a major river has moved
into Yugoslavia and destroyed all life in the water, local officials said
Saturday. The spill originated in northwest Romania, near the border town of
Oradea, where a dam at the Baia Mare gold mine overflowed Jan. 30 and caused
cyanide to pour into streams. From there, the polluted water flowed west into
the Tisa River in neighboring Hungary and then on into Yugoslavia. Eighty
percent of the fish in the Tisa have died since the contaminant entered the
country two days ago.

Outgoing IMF Chief Hit With Pie

	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) -- The outgoing chief of the International Monetary
Fund got a rude retirement present Sunday when an American anti-free trade
activist penetrated security at a trade conference and hit him with a pie in the
face. Moments before Michel Camdessus was to deliver his last speech as IMF
chairman, the activist hurled a fruit-and-cream pie inside the meeting hall
where some 190 nations are holding the U.N. Conference on Trade and Development.
Camdessus, 66, who is retiring after heading the IMF since 1987, gave a
scheduled speech afterward without mentioning the attack.

	   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) -- Hours after returning from an overseas trip,
Indonesian President Abdurrahman Wahid held an emergency meeting Sunday with the
powerful security chief who has defied his demands to resign. Senior Security
and Political Affairs Minister Gen. Wiranto arrived at the presidential palace
in Jakarta with Vice President Megawati Sukarnoputri. Earlier Sunday, Wahid
returned from a 16-day tour of the Middle East, Europe and Asia. The trip was
largely overshadowed by his long-range public squabble with Wiranto, accused by
Indonesian and United Nations human-rights panels of overseeing violence in East
Timor in his former role as armed forces commander.

percent in the poll conducted Wednesday through Friday. The poll supported the
McCain camp's belief that it will need a heavy turnout of independents to win in

Cyanide Spill Devastates Yugoslavia

	   BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) -- In what may be Europe's worst environmental
disaster since Chernobyl, a cyanide spill contaminating a major river has moved
into Yugoslavia and destroyed all life in the water, local officials said
Saturday. The spill originated in northwest Romania, near the border town of
Oradea, where a dam at the Baia Mare gold mine overflowed Jan. 30 and caused
cyanide to pour into streams. From there, the polluted water flowed west into
the Tisa River in neighboring Hungary and then on into Yugoslavia. Eighty
percent of the fish in the Tisa have died since the contaminant entered the

<HEADLINE> 'Peanuts' Creator Schulz Dies at 77  </HEADLINE>
   By MARY ANN LICKTEIG Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   SAN FRANCISCO (AP) -- Charles M. Schulz, the cartoonist who delighted the
world with the adventures and adversities of Charlie Brown, his friends and a
dog named Snoopy, died on Saturday on the eve of the publication of his last
``Peanuts'' strip. He was 77.
</P>
<P>
	   Schulz, who was diagnosed with colon cancer and suffered a series of small
strokes during emergency abdominal surgery in November 1999 and announced his
retirement a few weeks afterward, died in his sleep at about 9:45 p.m., his son
Craig Schulz said.
</P>
<P>
	   His wildly popular comic strip, ``Peanuts,'' made its debut on Oct. 2, 1950.
The travails of the ``little round-headed kid'' and his pals eventually ran in
more than 2,400 newspapers, reaching millions of readers in 68 countries.
</P>
<P>
	   His last strip, appearing in Feb. 13 Sunday editions, showed Snoopy at his
typewriter and other Peanuts regulars along with a ``Dear Friends'' letter
thanking his readers for their support.
</P>
<P>
	   Over the years, the Peanuts gang became a part of American popular culture,
delivering gentle humor spiked with a child's-eye view of human foibles.
</P>
<P>
	   One of the strip's most endearing qualities was its constancy.
</P>
<P>
	   The long-suffering Charlie Brown still faced misfortune with a mild, ``Good
grief!'' Tart-tongued Lucy still handed out advice at a nickel a pop, a joke
that started as a parody of a lemonade stand. And Snoopy, Charlie Brown's
wise-but-weird beagle, still took the occasional flight of fancy back to the
skies of World War I and his rivalry with the Red Baron.
</P>
<P>
	   The strip was an intensely personal effort for Schulz. He had had a clause
in his contract dictating the strip had to end with his death. While battling
cancer, he opted to retire it right then, saying he wanted to focus on his
health and family without the worry of a daily deadline.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Why do musicians compose symphonies and poets write poems?'' he once said.
``They do it because life wouldn't have any meaning for them if they didn't.
That's why I draw cartoons. It's my life.''
</P>
<P>
	   In his final daily strip, published Jan. 3, 2000, a thoughtful Snoopy sat
atop his doghouse with his typewriter. In a text message signed by Schulz, he
thanked fans for their ``wonderful support and love.''
</P>
<P>
	   ``Charlie Brown, Snoopy, Linus, Lucy ... how can I ever forget them,'' the
message read.
</P>
<P>
	   Although he remained largely a private person, the strip brought Schulz
international fame. He won the Reuben Award, comic art's highest honor, in 1955
and 1964. In 1978, he was named International Cartoonist of the Year, an award
voted by 700 comic artists around the world.
</P>
<P>
	   The 1965 CBS-TV special ``A Charlie Brown Christmas'' won an Emmy and rerun
immortality, and many other specials followed.
</P>
<P>
	   There was a hit musical, ``You're a Good Man, Charlie Brown,'' with Gary
Burghoff, later Radar O'Reilly on ``M-A-S-H,'' playing Charlie. The book ``The
Gospel According to Peanuts'' explored the philosophical and religious
implications of the strip.
</P>
<P>
	   When Schulz announced his retirement, Mort Walker, the creator of comic
strips ``Beetle Bailey'' and ``Hi and Lois,'' said he and Schulz wept when they
spoke on the phone.
</P>
<P>
	   ``He did something entirely different from what all the rest of us did. I
write and draw funny pictures and slapstick; it's a joke a day,'' Walker said at
the time. ``He delved into the psyche of children and the fears and the
rejections that we all felt as children.''
</P>
<P>
	   The characters also appeared on sheets, stationery and countless other
products. Schulz several times was listed as one of Forbes magazine's best-paid
entertainers, most recently in 1996, when his 1995-96 income was estimated at
$33 million, ranking him No. 30 on the magazine's list.
</P>
<P>
	   In 1990, when the Peanuts gang turned 40, the government of France named
Schulz Commander of Arts and Letters, one of that country's highest awards for
excellence in the arts.
</P>
<P>
	   Despite the success, Schulz struggled with depression and anxiety, according
to his biographer, Rheta Grimsley Johnson. But the struggle only improved his
work, she found, as he poured those feelings of rejection and uncertainty into
the strip and turned Charlie Brown into Everyman.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Rejection is his specialty, losing his area of expertise. He has spent a
lifetime perfecting failure,'' Johnson wrote in her 1989 book, ``Good Grief: The
Story of Charles M. Schulz.''
</P>
<P>
	   Schulz was born in St. Paul, Minn., on Nov. 26, 1922, and studied art after
he saw a ``Do you like to draw?'' ad.
</P>
<P>
	   He was drafted into the Army in 1943 and sent to the European theater,
although he saw little combat.
</P>
<P>
	   After the war, he did lettering for a church comic book, taught art and sold
cartoons to the Saturday Evening Post. His first feature, ``Li'l Folks,'' was
developed for the St. Paul Pioneer Press in 1947. In 1950, it was sold to a
syndicate and the named changed to Peanuts, even though, he recalled later, he
didn't much like the name.
</P>
<P>
	   The popularity of the strip soared in October 1965 when Snoopy turned his
doghouse into a Sopwith Camel for the first of many engagements with the Baron.
The following year, a group called the Royal Guardsmen had a No. 2 single,
``Snoopy vs. the Red Baron.''
</P>
<P>
	   Charlie Brown, named after a friend at art school, was to some extent the
cartoonist's alter ego, and Snoopy was inspired by a dog he had as a child that
Schulz recalled as ``the smartest and most uncontrollable dog that I have ever
seen.'' The little red-haired girl, Charlie Brown's unrequited love, was based
on a girlfriend who rejected Schulz's proposal of marriage in 1950, according to
Johnson.
</P>
<P>
	   Schulz went on to marry Joyce Halverson in 1951. They divorced in 1972 and
he married Jeannie Forsyth two years later.
</P>
<P>
	   In his later years, he spent much of his time at his Redwood Empire Ice
Arena in Santa Rosa, about 60 miles north of San Francisco, where he frequently
played hockey or sipped coffee at the rink's Warm Puppy snack bar.
</P>
<P>
	   When ``You're a Good Man, Charlie Brown'' was revived on Broadway in 1999,
it had a multiethnic cast that at first concerned Schulz. He said he wasn't
racist but, ``I thought, 'This is mine. I did this thing. Nobody helped me. I
did the whole thing and now you're going to come in and show me how wonderfully
open-minded and liberal you are.''
</P>
<P>
	   He said he finally was persuaded that unorthodox casting was ``a very New
York thing to do.''
</P>
<P>
	   ``So I said, 'Well, if that's what they're going to do, all right,''' he
said. ``If ... people are willing to accept it, willing to accept that Lucy's
leaning on the piano playing up to a black Schroeder. All right, let's see how
it goes.''

<HEADLINE> Indonesian President Backs Down  </HEADLINE>
   By SLOBODAN LEKIC Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) -- President Abdurrahman Wahid appeared to back down
Sunday from repeated demands that his powerful security minister step down
immediately over his alleged involvement in the bloodshed in East Timor.
</P>
<P>
	   Instead of announcing Gen. Wiranto's resignation, a Wahid spokesman said
Sunday the president had ordered an investigation of the security minister's
role in the violence that shook the former Indonesian province last September.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Wiranto will remain at his present position until the president makes a
decision after reviewing the report of the team,'' Cabinet Secretary Marsilam
Simanjuntak said at the presidential palace.
</P>
<P>
	   Wiranto met with Wahid at the palace just hours after the president returned
from a 16-day tour of the Middle East, Europe and Asia.
</P>
<P>
	   The trip was largely overshadowed by his long-distance public row with
Wiranto, which sparked fears of a possible military coup in Jakarta.
</P>
<P>
	   Also present at Sunday's meeting were Vice President Megawati Sukarnoputri,
Attorney General Marzuki Darusman and Lt. Gen. Arie Kumaat, who heads the
national intelligence agency.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The president agreed today to let the attorney general form a special team
to investigate Gen. Wiranto's case,'' said Simanjuntak as the meeting was
ending.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The president will not take any decision about Wiranto before the team
reports the results of the investigations to the president,'' he said, adding
that the probe would likely be completed within a month.
</P>
<P>
	   Two weeks ago -- after Wahid had left for Saudi Arabia on the first leg of
his tour -- a government-sponsored human rights probe into the crisis in East
Timor recommended that Wiranto be formally investigated by state prosecutors.
</P>
<P>
	   Soon after the report was made public, Wahid announced he would suspend
Wiranto.
</P>
<P>
	   But Wiranto defied repeated calls from Wahid to step down. He denied any
wrongdoing and insisted he would present his case to the president in person.
</P>
<P>
	   Speaking on Saturday in Thailand, Wahid said Wiranto would either resign or
be sacked from the Cabinet for his role in last year's bloodshed, which rocked
the former Indonesian province following an overwhelming vote for independence.
</P>
<P>
	   ``If he does not resign, I will change the Cabinet anyway, without him,''
Wahid said.
</P>
<P>
	   The issue dominated Wahid's trip and sparked fears of a possible military
coup in Jakarta. The original goal of the tour -- to encourage investment in
Indonesia's moribund economy -- was largely forgotten as the media focused on
the public row.
</P>
<P>
	   U.N. Secretary General Kofi Annan, who met briefly on Saturday with Wahid on
the sidelines of a U.N. trade conference in Bangkok, said he was following
``very closely'' the discussions between Wahid and Wiranto.
</P>
<P>
	   Annan told a press conference Sunday in the Thai capital he would have a
``long session'' with Wahid when he visits Indonesia this week.
</P>
<P>
	   Wiranto, a protege of Indonesia's former dictator Suharto, was given the
post of security minister last October when Wahid took office.
</P>
<P>
	   Since then, Wiranto's relations with the reformist leader have become
increasingly strained because of the inability of the security forces to stem a
rising wave of religious and separatist violence throughout the island nation.

'Peanuts' Creator Schulz Dies at 77
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
	   SAN FRANCISCO (AP) -- Charles M. Schulz, the cartoonist who delighted the
world with the adventures and adversities of Charlie Brown, his friends and a
dog named Snoopy, died on Saturday. He was 77. Schulz, who was diagnosed with
colon cancer and suffered a series of small strokes during emergency abdominal
surgery in November 1999 and announced his retirement a few weeks afterward,
died in his sleep at about 9:45 p.m., his son Craig Schulz said. His wildly
popular comic strip, "Peanuts," made its debut on Oct. 2, 1950. The travails of
the "little round-headed kid" and his pals eventually ran in more than 2,400
newspapers, reaching millions of readers in 68 countries.

nations access to knowledge that was once the preserve of the rich.
"Globalization can now be seen in a positive light ... as the best means of

	   LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Airlines temporarily grounded 11 more jets Saturday
under a government order to examine tail wings for a problem that may have
caused an Alaska Airlines jet to crash two weeks ago. Since Thursday, at least
21 planes have been found to have irregularities with tail wing jackscrews, the
2-foot-long rods that drive the stabilizers that keep planes level, according to

campaign to win the South Carolina primary in a week. The Texas governor was
supported by 43 percent and McCain, a senator from Arizona, was supported by 40
percent in the poll conducted Wednesday through Friday. The poll supported the
McCain camp's belief that it will need a heavy turnout of independents to win in
the state. McCain got the backing of 55 percent of independents in the poll,
while Bush was backed by 53 percent of Republicans.

Cyanide Spill Devastates Yugoslavia

	   BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) -- In what may be Europe's worst environmental

into Yugoslavia and destroyed all life in the water, local officials said
Saturday. The spill originated in northwest Romania, near the border town of
Oradea, where a dam at the Baia Mare gold mine overflowed Jan. 30 and caused
cyanide to pour into streams. From there, the polluted water flowed west into
the Tisa River in neighboring Hungary and then on into Yugoslavia.

Coyotes with the Dallas Stars for first place in the Pacific Division. Roenick's
second goal -- his 26th of the season -- seemed unnecessary when he put it in

after the Flames finally solved Phoenix goalie Sean Burke and scored twice in
the final 1:11.

<HEADLINE> Poor Nations Seek Share of Wealth  </HEADLINE>
    By DIRK BEVERIDGE AP Business Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) -- Economic globalization may be inevitable, but the
leaders of poor nations told an international trade conference Saturday that it
holds painful and frightening consequences for their countries.
</P>
<P>
	   The weeklong U.N. Conference on Trade and Development, which started
Saturday, was being touted as a place for trade officials to redeem December's
debacle in Seattle, where street protests turned violent and World Trade
Organization ministers failed to launch a new round of global commerce talks.
</P>
<P>
	   But security issues plagued the Bangkok meeting as well, with an American
anti-free trade activist dodging a cordon around the conference to throw a pie
in the face of International Monetary Fund chief Michel Camdessus.
</P>
<P>
	   Following the embarrassing incident, Camdessus went ahead with a speech, his
last before stepping down as IMF chief. He used the occasion to counter claims
that his organization has ignored the concerns of ordinary people.
</P>
<P>
	   "Globalization can now be seen in a positive light ... as the best means of
improving the human condition throughout the world," he said.
</P>
<P>
	   Camdessus said foreign investment in the Third World has enormous potential
to close the income gap, while information technology has given poor nations
access to knowledge that was once the preserve of the rich.
</P>
<P>
	   The U.N. meeting, held every four years, focuses more on the developing
world and a feeling among many of its leaders that they cannot access wealth
created by a global system centered on high technology and increased power by
multinational corporations.
</P>
<P>
	   Such corporations -- some already financially more powerful than
medium-sized countries -- will keep getting bigger through mergers and
acquisitions, warned Malaysian Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad.
</P>
<P>
	   "While we welcome their collaboration with our local companies, we fear if
they are allowed into our countries unconditionally, they may swallow up all our
businesses," said Mahathir, long a vocal critic of the West. "I am worried and
frightened at the preparations being made by corporations in certain industries
and business activities in order to take advantage of liberalization and
globalization."
</P>
<P>
	   Japanese Prime Minister Keizo Obuchi said Saturday that his country, the
richest in Asia, would agree to open its market to most goods from the poorest
countries -- but only if the United States and Europe go along.
</P>
<P>
	   The Europeans have given the idea a warmer response than the Americans,
Japanese officials said privately.
</P>
<P>
	   U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan called for a "Global New Deal," with rich
nations extending a helping hand to their poor neighbors.
</P>
<P>
	   "The downsides of globalization are indeed painful," said Philippine
President Joseph Estrada, whose nation lags many of its neighbors economically.
"But taking the bigger pills against its ills is superior to living inside a
sterile bubble."
</P>
<P>
	   After the pie-throwing incident, Prime Minister Chuan Leekpai ordered
stepped-up security at the convention center and hotels where delegates from
some 190 nations are gathered.
</P>
<P>
	   Shortly after the order was issued, 500 protesters outfoxed hundreds of
officers and set themselves up directly in front of the main gates. Police in
riot shields surrounded the demonstrators, who sat down and refused to be moved.
No violence was reported. After an hour, the demonstrators on their own cleared
the area.
</P>
<P>
	   While the U.N. meeting is essentially a forum for developing nations and not
a place where policy is set -- like the WTO -- organizers have promoted this
session as a chance to rebuild confidence in global trade after the debacle in
Seattle. WTO Director-General Mike Moore is huddling here with trade officials
from various nations for that purpose.
</P>
<P>
	   UNCTAD is meeting in the capital where Asia's economic crisis began July 2,
1997, with the devaluation of Thailand's currency. That devaluation revealed
major cracks in the developing world's efforts to boost its economies quickly.
</P>
<P>
	   Thailand announced this week it would be leaving the IMF's rescue program, a
symbol that Asia is bouncing back, with regional growth expected to average 4
percent this year.

<HEADLINE> Spielberg Honored by NAACP  </HEADLINE>
    By CADONNA M. PEYTON Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   PASADENA, Calif. (AP) -- Steven Spielberg, whose films include "The Color
Purple" and "Amistad," won a special honor at the 31st NAACP Image Awards on
Saturday, while Denzel Washington took best actor for "The Hurricane."
</P>
<P>
	   The NAACP honored Spielberg with a Vanguard Award for his "pioneering
courage to promote social justice through creative endeavors."
</P>
<P>
	   "A couple of days ago, I was in the hospital," said 53-year-old Spielberg,
who had a kidney removed last week. "This is the first time I've been out since
my operation and it feels like a dream, an absolute dream."
</P>
<P>
	   Spielberg later went on to talk about promoting diversity in the industry.
</P>
<P>
	   "It's my responsibility and it's our responsibility as picturemakers, as
network executives, as studio heads, to continue to expand the opportunities of
the portrayal of diversity in all medium," he said. "And we still must
acknowledge the painful absence of racial diversity within our very own
industry."
</P>
<P>
	   The National Association for the Advancement of Colored People had announced
a shortage of minority characters in television made it difficult for Image
Award organizers to select nominees this year.
</P>
<P>
	   The organization has confronted the networks for months about the lack of
diversity.
</P>
<P>
	   The issue of minorities in the entertainment industry came to a boil in July
when NAACP and a coalition of Hispanic groups condemned a near-total lack of
minority characters in fall series. The groups threatened lawsuits and boycotts.
</P>
<P>
	   But NAACP officials recently met with TV network executives who promised to
work toward enhancing diversity on their shows.
</P>
<P>
	   Washington, who played a boxer wrongly imprisoned for murder in "The
Hurricane," congratulated NAACP President Kweisi Mfume "for the great work he is
doing in this town and in this country."
</P>
<P>
	   Earlier in the evening, comedian Steve Harvey won for best actor in a
television comedy, while "The Steve Harvey Show" won for outstanding comedy
series.
</P>
<P>
	   "This is from us, for us, that's why it means something to me," said Harvey,
who plays the vice principal of an urban high school. The series appears on
Warner Bros.' WB network.
</P>
<P>
	   Best actresses in a comedy series went to twins Tia and Tamera Mowry for
their roles in "Sister, Sister," also on the WB.
</P>
<P>
	   In the television categories, CBS had 18 nominations. ABC was next with 15,
followed by HBO with 14, Warner Bros. with 12 and NBC with 10.
</P>
<P>
	   Although CBS had the most nominations, it was one of the last major
broadcasters to sign a commitment with the NAACP to use more minority characters
this fall.
</P>
<P>
	   Agreements signed by Fox and CBS on Feb 3. are similar to those signed by
NBC and ABC last month, focusing on changes in minority representation through
the companies -- both on-screen and off.
</P>
<P>
	   CBS won for outstanding dramatic series for "Touched by an Angel," and its
co-star Della Reese won for best actress in a TV drama.
</P>
<P>
	   "It's so nice when your family says you're doing good," Reese said on
Saturday.
</P>
<P>
	   Civil rights heroine Rosa Parks won for supporting actress in a drama series
for her appearance on "Touched by an Angel."
</P>
<P>
	   Outstanding actor in a drama series went to Eriq La Salle of "ER."
</P>
<P>
	   Angela Bassett won outstanding supporting actress in the film "Music of the
Heart."
</P>
<P>
	   Halle Berry won outstanding actress in a television movie, mini-series or
dramatic special for the lead role in "Introducing Dorothy Dandridge," an HBO
movie about the first black woman nominated for an Academy Award as best
actress. Berry also won a Golden Globe for her role.
</P>
<P>
	   "The Best Man," about friends reuniting at a wedding, took outstanding
motion picture. Outstanding actress and actor awards went to the film's Nia Long
actor Terrence Howard, respectively.
</P>
<P>
	   The awards show is scheduled to air April 6 on Fox.

<HEADLINE> IMF Chief Defends Finance System  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) -- Despite protesters burning his image in effigy and
throwing a pie in his face, International Monetary Fund chief Michel Camdessus
on Sunday defended IMF measures to stabilize the global financial system.
</P>
<P>
	   Camdessus, giving his last speech before retiring Monday, told the U.N.
Conference on Trade and Development that the IMF was a force for global good and
not a villain as portrayed by critics.
</P>
<P>
	   The UNCTAD meeting is the first big gathering on international trade since
the World Trade Organization summit in Seattle last year was derailed by
protests and acrimony between nations over the uneven benefits of globalized
trade.
</P>
<P>
	   Camdessus said that the policies of financial stability promoted by the IMF
were a prerequisite for reducing inequality in wealth.
</P>
<P>
	   "Macroeconomic stability is clearly necessary for growth and hence poverty
alleviation," he told delegates from some 190 nations.
</P>
<P>
	   Critics of IMF bailout packages of Asian countries during the recent
economic crisis claim the fund's insistence on high interest rates to restore
financial stability deepened recession, leading to heavy job losses.
</P>
<P>
	   Many people in Asia have held Camdessus personally responsible for the
region's woes. The mostly Thai protesters outside the conference center burned
his image in effigy.
</P>
<P>
	   Inside, minutes before his speech, an American activist shouting "Happy
Birthday!" threw a cream-and-fruit pie in Camdessus' face.
</P>
<P>
	   Camdessus was unhurt and refused to press charges against Richard Reuel
Naiman, 34, of Washington, D.C., representing a group called "Fifty Years
Enough."
</P>
<P>
	   Camdessus gave his speech without commenting on the incident.
</P>
<P>
	   He said an expansion of information technology has given poor nations access
to knowledge that was once the preserve of the rich.
</P>
<P>
	   The organization issued a report saying that the number of least developed
countries -- the world's poorest nations -- since 1971 had risen from 25 to 48,
with 33 in Africa. Only one, Botswana, has graduated.
</P>
<P>
	   Britain's trade minister, Richard Caborn, urged rich countries should to
write off debt of the world's poorest nations and open markets to their goods to
revive the World Trade Organization talks.
</P>
<P>
	   Britain has to date written off $350 million in debt held by the world's
least developed countries, Caborn said.

<HEADLINE> 'Ripley' Stars Attend Film Festival  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
    BERLIN (AP) -- Gwyneth Paltrow is still in shock. Matt Damon can no longer
hide. And Anthony Minghella has more clout with the studio bosses.
</P>
<P>
	   Two days before this year's Academy Award nominations are to be announced,
the stars and director of a leading contender, "The Talented Mr. Ripley," talked
Sunday at the Berlin International Film Festival about the impact of winning
Hollywood's top prize.
</P>
<P>
	   Minghella, best director in 1997 for "The English Patient," said the Oscar
made it easier for him to convince Hollywood to back "Ripley," an intellectual
thriller where the lead character gets away with murder.
</P>
<P>
	   "Winning the Oscar was a great blessing," he said at a news conference after
his film's screening.
</P>
<P>
	   Damon was at home watching the Oscars on television when Minghella won. The
following year, he and pal Ben Affleck were on stage themselves, sharing the
best original screenplay award for "Good Will Hunting."
</P>
<P>
	   "Ben and I came out of nowhere," he said. "Suddenly everyone knew who we
were and that was the end of our anonymity."
</P>
<P>
	   Paltrow, last year's best actress for "Shakespeare in Love," is still trying
to cope with the post-traumatic stress of winning.
</P>
<P>
	   "I haven't been able to get any joy out of it," she said. "I'm just sort of
shocked and traumatized by it. ... I haven't in any way been able to get any
perspective on it and incorporate it into my life."
</P>
<P>
	   "The Talented Mr. Ripley" is one of 21 films competing for the Golden Bear
at the festival, which runs through Feb. 20.

<HEADLINE> Endangered Hawaiian Goose Is Back  </HEADLINE>
   By JEAN CHRISTENSEN Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   HONOLULU (AP) -- An endangered Hawaiian goose will be reintroduced to an
island it hasn't inhabited since before Capt. James Cook's 1778 arrival in
Hawaii.
</P>
<P>
	   Pu`u O Hoku Ranch on Molokai will become home to a flock of captive-bred
nene goslings this spring as part of a state and federal program encouraging
private landowners to help restore populations of endangered species.
</P>
<P>
	   Now, no more than 1,200 nene -- Hawaii's state bird -- survive.
</P>
<P>
	   This is one of the first applications of the U.S. Fish and Wildlife
Service's ``safe harbor'' policy, and a national conservation group hopes the
agreement will be a model for other states trying to protect endangered species.
</P>
<P>
	   ``There are lots of landowners out there who want to help endangered species
but are afraid of the regulatory consequences of doing so,'' David Wilcove,
senior ecologist for the New York-based Environmental Defense group, said Feb.
8.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The safe harbor agreement is a way to ease their fears and allow them to
be the good stewards they want to be.''
</P>
<P>
	   The nene (NAY'-nay) once thrived on the islands' volcanic slopes and lowland
lava flows. But hunting and the introduction of alien species reduced that
population to just a few dozen by the early 20th century.
</P>
<P>
	   Wildlife experts believe the nene disappeared from Molokai even before
Cook's arrival, perhaps in the early 1700s. It has not been found anywhere else
in the wild.
</P>
<P>
	   Since a captive breeding program began in 1949, more than 2,000 nene have
been released on the islands of Maui, Hawaii and Kauai.
</P>
<P>
	   But Paul Conry, wildlife program manager for the state Department of Land
and Natural Resources, said East Molokai, where Pu`u O Hoku ranch operates
14,000 acres, offers an especially desirable nene habitat because it lacks many
natural predators like the mongoose.
</P>
<P>
	   The ranch is about 75 miles east of Honolulu.
</P>
<P>
	   Nenes differ from domestic geese with their more upright stance, longer legs
and wings, and reduced webbing on their feet.
</P>
<P>
	   They are 21-26 inches tall and weigh about 4 1/2 pounds, with black feet and
legs, dark brown bodies and cream-colored, feathered necks.
</P>
<P>
	   The Hawaiian name, nene, comes from the unusual murmuring sound the geese
make during feeding.
</P>
<P>
	   Under the safe harbor agreement, about 20-30 nene goslings and a few
``foster parent'' adult geese will be introduced to a 735-acre grassland area
this spring.
</P>
<P>
	   Perhaps hundreds more will be introduced over the next several years, Conry
said.
</P>
<P>
	   The agreement will undergo a 60-day public comment period and must be
approved by USFWS, which began reviewing it Feb. 8, according to Gina Shultz,
the program leader for habitat conservation plans in the Pacific Islands.
</P>
<P>
	   The agreement assures the ranch it will not be responsible if nene are
harmed or killed there because of legal land-use activities.
</P>
<P>
	   Similar agreements have helped efforts to restore the red-cockaded
woodpecker in North Carolina and the northern Aplomado falcon in Texas, Wilcove
said.
</P>
<P>
	   Private landowners have been reluctant to allow endangered species on their
property because they believed their hands would be tied if their plans for the
property changed, he said.
</P>
<P>
	   That led to timber farmers cutting down trees before they were old enough to
become an attractive habitat to endangered woodpeckers, he said.
</P>
<P>
	   ``It was sort of a scorched-earth approach, and we wanted to get away from
that,'' Wilcove said.
</P>
<P>
	   Safe-harbor agreements allow landowners to opt out and develop the land at a
later time.
</P>
<P>
	   Wilcove said similar agreements could benefit several mainland species,
including the San Joaquin kit fox in California.
</P>
<P>
	   Conry said the Molokai ranch owner, who requested anonymity, was not
motivated by a desire for publicity.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We are fortunate we've got a really willing landowner that is entering
into this totally altruistically,'' he said. ``They don't have any great
expectations on their part but to do good for the nene.''

<HEADLINE> Watercraft, Kids a Rough Mix  </HEADLINE>
    By IRA DREYFUSS Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Kids just want to have fun, but it's getting harder for
them to have it on personal watercraft. Adults are deciding Jet Skis and similar
speedy craft are too dangerous for those under 16.
</P>
<P>
	   "No one younger than 16 years should operate PWC," said the American Academy
of Pediatrics in a statement in the February issue of the medical group's
journal Pediatrics. Industry groups and a Coast Guard official concur.
</P>
<P>
	   "There are states where 900 pounds of personal watercraft that's capable of
doing better than 60 miles an hour can be operated by a 12-year-old," said Capt.
Mike Holmes, chief of the Coast Guard's Office of Boating Safety. Five states
have no age minimums, according to a 1997 Coast Guard report. In the rest, the
minimums range as young as 10 years, with many allowing use at the ages of 12 to
14.
</P>
<P>
	   "It is clear they are dangerous vehicles for kids," said Dr. Barbara Smith
of Tucson, Ariz., who helped to write the statement.
</P>
<P>
	   Exactly how dangerous is hard to say. There are too few law enforcement
personnel chasing too many boats over too much water to get a handle on all
accidents, Holmes said. However, the Coast Guard tallied 1,743 injuries for
1998, ranging from bruises to spinal and head injuries and loss of limbs. Of the
total, 151 were to children under 16.
</P>
<P>
	   Personal watercraft are only 12 percent of boats but account for 40 percent
of accidents, Holmes said. The rate of boating accidents has been steadily
dropping since passage of the federal Boating Safety Act of 1971, but the
wave-hopping craft powered by jets of water keep the accident rates from falling
more, he said.
</P>
<P>
	   To Smith, the little boats are an invitation to trouble.
</P>
<P>
	   "The whole goal of these things is to go fast. The whole goal of taking your
fishing boat out is not necessarily to go fast," Smith said. "The majority (of
personal watercraft users) are out there to whoop it up in those things."
</P>
<P>
	   This difference in use explains why the typical accident in a personal
watercraft involves banging into something or someone in the water, whereas the
typical accident in an ordinary boat is someone falling overboard, Smith said.
</P>
<P>
	   The image of personal watercraft as playthings of thrill-seeking yahoos is
something the industry is trying hard to change. "It's important for the
industry that personal watercraft are not only fun to use but safe to use," said
Sean T. Foertsch, state and local government relations manager for the Personal
Watercraft Industry Association, which represents manufacturers.
</P>
<P>
	   "Any time there is a risk to young people who use our products, it's
something the industry is very concerned about," he said.
</P>
<P>
	   The association has developed model state legislation on the boats' uses.
Among other things, the measure would set 16 as the minimum age for a user of a
privately owned watercraft or any other motorboat with 10 horsepower or greater.
The minimum would be 18 for a user of a rental.
</P>
<P>
	   The age of 16 is in line with minimum driving ages in many states. The age
of 18 makes renters legally able to sign contracts taking responsibility for the
watercraft and their use of them, said the association's executive director,
Larry Lambrose. Rentals apparently have an outsized risk of being involved in
accidents in which someone is hurt, he said.
</P>
<P>
	   But more than changes in the law are needed, Lambrose said. Parents should
take a hand in saying who gets to drive the watercraft, he said. "When
somebody's daughter is 14, and wants the car keys, the mother is going to say,
'You're out of your mind,' " he said. "In a boat, they are likely to say, 'Sure,
go ahead,' and that's very inappropriate."
</P>
<P>
	   Lambrose also said that under-16s accounted for only 16 percent of injuries.
</P>
<P>
	   Older users, especially in the late-teen, young-adult age range, had more
injuries, Holmes said. But people in this range also had higher usage rates, so
the injury rates may at least partly reflect their greater use, he said.

<HEADLINE> Salmon Are Natural Recycler  </HEADLINE>
   By JEFF BARNARD Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   GRANTS PASS, Ore. (AP) -- A growing body of scientific evidence is showing
that salmon are more than just a majestic sport fish, a tasty entree, an
economic resource or a cultural icon.
</P>
<P>
	   From Alaska to California, they serve as a huge natural recycler,
responsible for transporting organic material they eat in the oceans and store
in their bodies before swimming to the headwaters of watersheds, leaving their
carcasses to feed insects, bears, plants, trees and particularly baby salmon.
</P>
<P>
	   A recent study published in the journal Fisheries estimates that as little
as 5 percent of the historical biomass of salmon is returning to its native
watersheds, creating a dramatic shortage of nutrients derived from the ocean.
</P>
<P>
	   The recycling role is so important that restoration of wild salmon in the
Pacific Northwest ``is hinging on recognition of this issue,'' said Jeff
Cederholm, a fisheries scientist with the Washington Department of Natural
Resources.
</P>
<P>
	   Historically, salmon management has been based on allowing the maximum catch
in the ocean and rivers while allowing just enough fish to return to their
native streams, where they die after spawning a new generation.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We have essentially starved our freshwater systems,'' said Bob Bilby, a
fisheries scientist with the National Marine Fisheries Service in Seattle.
</P>
<P>
	   Based on historical cannery records and published accounts, researchers
estimated the annual biomass of salmon returning to rivers before the arrival of
settlers in Washington, Oregon, Idaho and California.
</P>
<P>
	   They found that salmon runs totaling between 352 million pounds and 497
million pounds had declined to between 26 million pounds to 30 million pounds.
</P>
<P>
	   ``This means that just 5 percent to 7 percent of the marine-derived nitrogen
and marine-derived phosphorous once delivered annually to the rivers of the
Pacific Northwest is currently reaching those streams,'' the researchers say in
their study.
</P>
<P>
	   ``This nutrient deficit may be one indication of ecosystem failure,'' they
wrote.
</P>
<P>
	   Jim Lichatowich, an independent fish biologist, Ted Gresh, a graduate
student in planning and public policy at University of Oregon, and Peter
Schoonmaker, executive director of the Institute of the Northwest published
their findings in the January issue of Fisheries, the journal of the American
Fisheries Society.
</P>
<P>
	   ``This is sort of like the erosion of genetic diversity,'' Lichatowich said
in an interview. ``It is something you don't see, but accumulatively it probably
could have a big impact.''
</P>
<P>
	   The key to this research has been equipment that can identify individual
isotopes of chemicals such as nitrogen, phosphorous and carbon, and track them
to their source. Using it, scientists have analyzed leaves, plants, young fish
and even grizzly bear bones. All showed high levels of nutrients coming from the
ocean.
</P>
<P>
	   On Washington's Olympic Peninsula, Cederholm observed 22 different animals
feeding on salmon carcasses.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We have been finding marine carbon and nitrogen in leaf matter of trees
growing along river corridors,'' Cederholm said. ``The only way for it to get
there is through salmon swimming up streams, spawning in rivers.''
</P>
<P>
	   The trees in turn drop their leaves, branches, and eventually their trunks
into the river, where they serve as hiding and resting places for the fish, and
decompose to feed insects, which in turn are eaten by salmon.
</P>
<P>
	   ``They are a keystone species,'' Cedarholm said of salmon. ``All the other
wildlife or plant communities have, in some way, some dependency.''
</P>
<P>
	   Working on the Snoqualmie River in Washington, Bilby found that as much as
40 percent of the nitrogen in the bodies of young coho salmon and 60 percent of
the nitrogen in young steelhead came from marine sources.
</P>
<P>
	   When they dumped salmon carcasses on streams running into Willapa Bay, they
found higher densities of young fish around the carcasses. The young fish were
feeding on the carcasses and eggs laid in the river.
</P>
<P>
	   The extra food meant juvenile fish grew bigger before migrating to the
ocean. Bigger fish survive better, so more fish come back to the river. And so
on.
</P>
<P>
	   It appears that salmon evolved this as a survival strategy because the
streams in the Northwest were generally low in nutrients. So they brought their
own lunch.
</P>
<P>
	   ``If you don't have the subsidy provided by salmon, those systems gradually
decline,'' Bilby said. ``You'll still have aquatic life occurring in those
streams, but there won't be much of it.''
</P>
<P>
	   The Oregon Plan for restoring dwindling salmon populations recognized this
research, and for the past two years volunteers have been tossing salmon
carcasses from five hatcheries along rivers on the northern Oregon Coast, where
coho salmon originate. Washington state has a similar program.
</P>
<P>
	   There is a long way to go, the authors of the Fisheries article concluded.
</P>
<P>
	   Research has indicated that between 93 and 155 carcasses per kilometer are
needed to provide the maximum ecological benefit on coho streams. While Oregon's
goal for coastal coho streams is 26 fish per kilometer, only two to seven fish
per kilometer were found in 1997.

<HEADLINE> IMF Chief Camdessus Retiring Monday  </HEADLINE>
    By NAOMI KOPPEL Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) -- During his 13 years as head of the International
Monetary Fund, Michel Camdessus transformed himself from a faceless bureaucrat
into a well-known -- and much-criticized -- figure.
</P>
<P>
	   Camdessus, 66, retires as the IMF's managing director Monday, more than a
year before his term expires. He is the IMF's longest-serving IMF chief.
</P>
<P>
	   He often drew criticism from some governments and activist groups that
partly blamed his financial policies for poverty in the Third World.
</P>
<P>
	   His career ended in a more physical act of criticism. Before Camdessus gave
his final speech at a U.N. trade conference in Bangkok on Sunday, an American
activist threw a cream-and-fruit pie in his face.
</P>
<P>
	   But the pie-throwing incident gave Camdessus a last chance to show the iron
side of his character, going ahead with his speech -- a defense of the IMF as a
force for global good -- without mentioning the assault on his dignity minutes
earlier.
</P>
<P>
	   Camdessus instead hit back at countries that had criticized him over the
years, hinting at hypocrisy.
</P>
<P>
	   "Some governments from time to time find it convenient not to express their
public support for actions they support wholeheartedly in our executive bodies,"
he said. "We will all be unable to discharge our ever-growing responsibilities
if we are not perceived for what we are -- the faithful instruments of the
community of nations."
</P>
<P>
	   Many in Thailand held Camdessus personally responsible for exacerbating the
recent Asian economic crisis by insisting on high-interest rates that have been
blamed for ruining businesses and leaving millions out of work. The IMF and
Camdessus in particular became convenient scapegoats for some governments.
</P>
<P>
	   Camdessus, a former governor of the Bank of France, was picked in 1998 by
Asiaweek magazine as Asia's most powerful man.
</P>
<P>
	   Under Camdessus, the IMF coped with financial crises in Asia, Africa, Russia
and Latin America.
</P>
<P>
	   But the IMF was never popular internationally, and calls have increased for
the organization to operate with the transparency it often demands of poor
countries.
</P>
<P>
	   In recent months, the IMF has been tested by allegations that billions of
dollars of aid money destined for Russia had been misappropriated.
</P>
<P>
	   The United States is proposing significant changes. It wants the IMF to
focus on short-term emergency loans and to withdraw from making long-term loans
to poor countries that can obtain money from private sources.
</P>
<P>
	   When Camdessus' retirement was announced last year, British Chancellor
Gordon Brown praised him as a visionary.
</P>
<P>
	   But on Bangkok's streets, protesters who see the IMF as part of a world
system favoring rich countries cheered at the pie throwing and burned Camdessus
in effigy.
</P>
<P>
	   Camdessus, typically unflappable, refused to press charges against the pie
thrower.

<HEADLINE> Poor Nations Say They're Left Behind  </HEADLINE>
    By DIRK BEVERIDGE AP Business Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) -- Government officials argued, protesters marched
and a demonstrator threw a pie at the chief of the International Monetary Fund
on Sunday during a trade summit that had been touted as a peaceful meeting of
rich and poor nations.
</P>
<P>
	   One chapter of the current economic order came to an end as Michel
Camdessus, the IMF's managing director, made a final speech to the U.N.
Conference on Trade and Development before his retirement Monday. He said
economic globalization does not threaten poor nations because foreign investment
will help reduce gaps in wealth.
</P>
<P>
	   "Globalization can now be seen in a positive light," he said, "as the best
means of improving the human condition throughout the world."
</P>
<P>
	   But many developing countries argue they are being left behind as the
benefits of economic globalization are spread unequally among the world's
people, creating bigger divides between the haves and the have-nots. The
developing countries contend that debts owed to rich nations are crippling their
ability to grow, and they complain trade barriers keeping their products out of
some markets are imposed unfairly.
</P>
<P>
	   Critics of IMF bailout packages of Asian countries during the recent
economic crisis claim the fund's insistence on high interest rates to restore
financial stability deepened recession, leading to heavy job losses.
</P>
<P>
	   Many people in Asia have held Camdessus personally responsible for the
region's woes. The U.N. conference, which runs through Saturday and is held
every four years, has attracted hundreds of demonstrators. The mostly Thai
protesters outside the conference center burned Camdessus' image in effigy.
</P>
<P>
	   Inside, minutes before his speech, an American activist shouting "Happy
Birthday!" threw a cream-and-fruit pie in Camdessus' face.
</P>
<P>
	   Camdessus was unhurt and refused to press charges against Richard Reuel
Naiman, 34, of Washington, D.C., who represented a group called "Fifty Years
Enough."
</P>
<P>
	   Camdessus, who is French, laughed off the attack, calling it "professional
risks, part of my job."
</P>
<P>
	   Developing nations have also vented anger at the World Trade Organization
since its attempt to start a new round of global commerce talks failed in
Seattle last year, and they are demanding more say in setting the rules.
</P>
<P>
	   Leaders of some poor nations have expressed hoped that the conference would
offer them the chance to fight for more input.
</P>
<P>
	   But the world's two biggest traders, the United States and the 15-member
European Union, made it clear Sunday they don't want the conference straying
from its role of gathering ideas on helping developing nations get ahead.
</P>
<P>
	   "UNCTAD is not a forum for the negotiation of multilateral trade rules,
which is the prerogative of the WTO," said Portugal's secretary of state for
economic affairs, Vitor Ramalho, speaking on behalf of the EU.
</P>
<P>
	   International labor unionists, meanwhile, urged the developed world to
overhaul economic policies they claim promote trade at the expense of workers'
rights.
</P>
<P>
	   "I am here to deliver the message that we need globalization with a human
face and that the global economy is measured by what it does to make better
lives for workers," said Anne Knipper of the AFL-CIO.
</P>
<P>
	   Meanwhile, a report issued by the conference said the world's 48 poorest
countries are failing to benefit from free trade and globalization and face
worsening poverty.
</P>
<P>
	   Indian Commerce Minister Murasoli Maran urged Western nations to abandon any
ideas of using the Geneva-based WTO to set rules on stronger workers' rights.
</P>
<P>
	   Poor nations say cheap labor is their biggest competitive advantage in the
rapidly globalizing economy. They contend they can't afford to treat workers as
well as they are treated in wealthy countries. They also balk at suggestions of
imposing tighter environmental protections, saying that would harm their chances
to better their fortunes.
</P>
<P>
	   "We should not forget that the cry of grief uttered in the pain of poverty
and deprivation by people still echoes all over the developing world," Maran
said. "Out of the pain must be born the new dreams of justice -- a new world
economic order."

<HEADLINE> Low Turnout for Zimbabwe Referendum  </HEADLINE>
   By ANGUS SHAW Associated Press
<TEXT>
<P>
	   HARARE, Zimbabwe (AP) -- A referendum seen as a gauge of President Robert
Mugabe's waning support entered a second day Sunday with voters turning out in
smaller numbers than expected, officials said.
</P>
<P>
	   Zimbabweans were voting on proposed changes to the constitution that would
allow Mugabe to retain most of his powers despite growing opposition to his
rule. The constitutional changes also would allow the government to seize land
owned by white descendants of British settlers without paying compensation.
</P>
<P>
	   A low turnout is expected to favor a ``yes'' vote to the constitutional
changes. Results are expected after vote counting on Monday.
</P>
<P>
	   In the first high profile police action during the election, a top
opposition leader and eight supporters were arrested in the township of
Highfields.
</P>
<P>
	   Tendai Biti, a leader of the Movement for Democratic Change and a prominent
human rights lawyer, was accused, along with party colleagues, of inflammatory
campaigning and incitement to violence.
</P>
<P>
	   Biti and his colleagues denied the accusations.
</P>
<P>
	   The group had been using a bullhorn to draw voters to the polls and were not
in breach of voting rules, said Lovemore Madhuku, an official of the National
Constitutional Assembly, an ally of the main opposition party.
</P>
<P>
	   Small lines formed at main polling stations Sunday and monitors forecast an
overall turnout of about 40 percent of the nation's 5 million eligible voters.
</P>
<P>
	   Ruling party officials expected a higher turnout because voters only needed
to present Zimbabwean identity documents instead of registering ahead of time as
in 1996 elections.
</P>
<P>
	   Still, if the forecasts are accurate, the number of voters would be nearly
10 percent higher than in 1996.
</P>
<P>
	   During voting Saturday, lines for scarce gasoline and kerosene were longer
than those at voting stations.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We are not happy with the low turnout and hope it will improve,'' said
Lovemore Madhuku, an official of the National Constitutional Assembly.
</P>
<P>
	   The assembly, -- a coalition of civic, human rights, church and lawyers'
groups opposed to the revised constitution -- has accused the government of
preventing election monitors from reaching all of the 3,600 polling stations
across the country.
</P>
<P>
	   Madhuku said voter education programs were inadequate and that there were no
ballots in local languages in rural areas where English is uncommon.
</P>
<P>
	   The official Zimbabwe news agency reported that some voters in the eastern
Manicaland province believed the poll was a presidential vote either to endorse
Mugabe's rule or elect opposition leader Morgan Tsvangirai to replace him.
</P>
<P>
	   Tsvangirai's Movement for Democratic Change wants the constitutional
revisions scrapped, arguing that Zimbabweans want Mugabe stripped of his
sweeping powers.
</P>
<P>
	   An economic crisis has spurred the biggest opposition challenge to Mugabe's
party since he led the former British colony of Rhodesia to independence in 1980
as Zimbabwe.
</P>
<P>
	   Inflation has reached a record 70 percent, unemployment has soared to 50
percent and diesel, gasoline and power shortages since December have crippled
transport, industry and agriculture.

<HEADLINE> AFL-CIO Leaders Plan Vote Strategy  </HEADLINE>
    By ALICE ANN LOVE Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   NEW ORLEANS (AP) -- AFL-CIO leaders, pushing ahead despite the refusal of
the Teamsters and the Auto Workers to join their endorsement of Al Gore, are
meeting this week to fine-tune congressional election strategy.
</P>
<P>
	   The labor federation is committing $40 million to put Gore in the White
House and to win back control of Congress for its allies -- traditionally
Democrats.
</P>
<P>
	   The AFL-CIO's executive council chose New Orleans for its annual midwinter
meeting partly to highlight the strength of labor unity in overcoming
opposition. The city was the site of a six-year battle to organize shipyard
workers that was won last fall.
</P>
<P>
	   Across the country, union members are leafleting for Gore at job sites in
presidential primary states and going door-to-door handing out video tapes in
which John Sweeney, the AFL-CIO president, stumps for the vice president.
</P>
<P>
	   The executive council is set to discuss special political mobilization
efforts aimed at retired union workers and women, both union members and
spouses.
</P>
<P>
	   But all is not completely unified on the political front.
</P>
<P>
	   The International Brotherhood of Teamsters and the United Auto Workers,
which opposed Gore's early endorsement by the federation in October, represent a
combined 2 million of the 13 million members of AFL-CIO's 68 affiliated unions.
</P>
<P>
	   "Really, in some ways, we're hamstrung by not having every union on board,"
AFL-CIO political director Steve Rosenthal said.
</P>
<P>
	   Teamsters government affairs director Mike Mathis said Gore has gained
ground with the union's rank and file since fall polls showed that among
Teamsters, the vice president was in a dead heat with former New Jersey Sen.
Bill Bradley, a Democrat, and Texas Gov. George W. Bush, a Republican.
</P>
<P>
	   Neither the Teamsters or the UAW are expected to make presidential
endorsements this week, even though the executive council scheduled a private
meeting with Gore on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
	   "I think the AFL-CIO would very much like everybody to do a nice standup and
applaud and just listen to him," Mathis said. "I don't know that (Teamsters
president) Jim Hoffa is going to let them do that."
</P>
<P>
	   Adding to tensions, other labor leaders share the Teamsters' and the UAW's
biggest disagreement with Gore: the vice president's support for the Clinton
administration's push to give China permanent normal trade status with the
United States as part of the process for China to gain entry to the World Trade
Organization.
</P>
<P>
	   The executive council is to meet Wednesday with Labor Secretary Alexis
Herman, who helped negotiate the trade deal with China last year that now awaits
congressional action.
</P>
<P>
	   The labor leaders say China's poor record on workers' rights and human
rights should rule out new trade privileges. They will use the issue as a litmus
test for congressional candidates this year.
</P>
<P>
	   The UAW already has begun an ad campaign in Washington, D.C., newspapers --
"You can't have free trade without freedom" -- to let lawmakers know what they
could see in their districts later this year.
</P>
<P>
	   The executive council will discuss additional tactics, including the
possibility of a mass demonstration in Washington similar to those that crippled
a WTO meeting in Seattle in December.
</P>
<P>
	   The unions also plan to press congressional candidates on a minimum wage
increase being pushed by Democrats and proposed regulations Republicans have
tried to block that would protect workers from repetitive-stress, or ergonomic,
injuries on the job.
</P>
<P>
	   Rep. Richard Gephardt, D-Mo., who hopes to be the next House speaker, is to
meet with the labor leaders on Tuesday, hoping to solidify support for
Democratic candidates.
</P>
<P>
	   The AFL-CIO plans to focus its attention on about 65 close House races and
14 Senate contests -- mostly backing Democratic candidates, as usual. Rosenthal
predicted labor may lend its support to about 25 Republican candidates this
year.
</P>
<P>
	   "We actively look for more moderate Republicans, but they are harder and
harder to come by," he said.

<HEADLINE> Rev. Moon Marries 20,000 People  </HEADLINE>
   By KYONG-HWA SEOK Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   SEOUL, South Korea (AP) -- For most brides, a wedding without a bridegroom
would be difficult to imagine. But Lee Hwa-shin said she couldn't be happier,
even though she and her future husband were married without ever having met.
</P>
<P>
	   Lee was among 10,000 couples who tied the knot Sunday in a mass wedding
organized by the Unification Church of Rev. Sun Myung Moon. The vast majority of
the newlyweds were complete strangers matched by church officials.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I am very happy although my husband is not here,'' said Lee, a 20-year-old
South Korean design student, as she shivered in cold weather at Seoul's Olympic
Stadium.
</P>
<P>
	   She held a framed picture of her new husband, Tokumasa Yamashita, in a black
suit. She said Yamashita, a 20-year-old Japanese man studying computer
engineering in the United States, couldn't get a visa in time to attend. At the
end of the ceremony, Lee took out a golden ring and slipped it on herself.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I have no regrets, because I know I am doing the right thing,'' said Lee,
who wore a white wedding gown.
</P>
<P>
	   Church officials said Moon and some elder church officials appointed by him
paired the couples by examining their photographs.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We want to allow God to choose (the spouses),'' church spokesman Robin
Marsh said. ``In our wedding, we build, we develop our love for each other.''
</P>
<P>
	   About 40,000 married church members also attended the ceremony to renew
their vows. Church officials said ``hundreds of thousands'' of others renewed
their vows while watching the ceremony through the Internet and a satellite
broadcast.
</P>
<P>
	   Church officials said those who attended Sunday's ceremony included people
from 150 countries, including the United States, Russia, England, France,
Germany, Japan and Italy.
</P>
<P>
	   It was the 16th mass wedding organized by the Unification Church.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I feel very good. This is really great for me and my wife and my future,''
said Aistis Vaicekauskas, 26, a law student from Lithuania who said he met his
bride, 21-year old Natasha Buzuk of Belarus, only a week ago.
</P>
<P>
	   The 1 1/2-hour-long wedding began with the couples saluting the Korean
national flag, a gesture meant to express respect for South Korea, the church's
birthplace.
</P>
<P>
	   Holy water was sprinkled, wedding vows were repeated, and the familiar
phrase ``I do'' echoed across the stadium. Foreign couples read English
instructions flashed on a huge electronic screen.
</P>
<P>
	   The event ended with the couples shouting ``Hurrah'' three times amid gun
salutes and fireworks.
</P>
<P>
	   Church officials said some couples from reclusive communist North Korea took
part in the wedding by sending their photos to China, where a small ceremony was
held. Officials refused to disclose details, saying that to do so could endanger
the couples.
</P>
<P>
	   The Unification Church claims 4.5 million members worldwide. Its followers
are mainly from South Korea, Japan and the United States.
</P>
<P>
	   Its doctrines are a mixture of Christian, Confucian and traditional Korean
values. Followers believe the church's leader, Moon, came to the world to
complete the work of Jesus Christ.

<HEADLINE> Aid Just Starting To Reach Chechens  </HEADLINE>
   By NICK WADHAMS Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   SLEPTSOVSKAYA, Russia (AP) -- At the Sputnik refugee camp, ragged tents
filled with Chechen families stand next to muddy pits filled with human waste.
</P>
<P>
	   People wait days to get medical treatment. Each gets just a half loaf of
bread a day, and only occasionally flour, canned meat and other basic foods. Aid
coming in is just a trickle compared to the help given during the last war in
Chechnya.
</P>
<P>
	   ``People say they're bringing aid, but it never arrives,'' complained Zora
Estamirova, 52. She fled the Chechen capital of Grozny in September and ended up
in the Sputnik camp in Ingushetia, just over the border from Chechnya.
</P>
<P>
	   The war in Chechnya has forced some 250,000 people to flee their homes and
their livelihoods, and now most are dependent on humanitarian aid. Yet the aid
being provided is nowhere near the help given to civilians during the 1994-96
war.
</P>
<P>
	   Back then, international organizations worked in Grozny amid fierce street
battles in which the ravaged city changed hands twice. Now, only a couple of
foreign aid groups are operating anywhere in Chechnya -- and they insist on
secrecy.
</P>
<P>
	   Even the camps in Ingushetia, the destination for most of the refugees, are
almost totally devoid of any international presence.
</P>
<P>
	   ``This conflict has gone much more ignored by the international community,''
said Peter Bouckaert of the New York-based Human Rights Watch group.
</P>
<P>
	   Aid organizations say the biggest obstacle to increasing their activity is
the shaky security situation in the region. Many aid groups pulled out of
Chechnya and surrounding regions after the last war and an ensuing wave of
killings and kidnappings, some of which targeted foreigners.
</P>
<P>
	   In 1996, six Red Cross workers were shot to death as they slept in Grozny
and at least three foreign aid workers were kidnapped. Two years later, Vincent
Cochetel, a representative of the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees, was
kidnapped in neighboring North Ossetia and held for a year.
</P>
<P>
	   ``If we look at the history of what's happened in the region since the last
war ... the answer is obvious why the response is not so great,'' said Victoria
Catliff, a Red Cross spokeswoman in Moscow. ``There's nothing to indicate that
the risk has decreased for us.''
</P>
<P>
	   Some organizations blame the Russian government, saying it has not provided
safe passage for many civilians trapped in Chechnya or allowed in most
foreigners, including representatives of aid and rights groups. The government
contends it has provided safe corridors for refugees to escape the fighting and
says it cannot yet guarantee security for foreigners.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Russia does carry the primary responsibility to respond to this crisis and
it has not done so in an adequate way,'' Bouckaert said.
</P>
<P>
	   A handful of humanitarian groups, including Doctors of the World and the
Danish Refugee Council, are working at the Sputnik camp, but they are
overwhelmed by the needs of the 7,000 refugees there.
</P>
<P>
	   Many of the children run around in freezing temperatures in slippers and
summer clothes. Cows, chickens and horses pick through piles of trash in a field
nearby.
</P>
<P>
	   Only some tents have gas heating; inhabitants of others are forced to scour
the area for their own wood and coal. Medics have reported a wave of serious
illnesses including tuberculosis.
</P>
<P>
	   Some refugees have received boxes of food, oil and hygiene supplies from the
Red Cross, while the U.N. refugee agency has provided flour, gas stoves, soap,
bed linens and other goods.
</P>
<P>
	   Aid groups say they are expanding their work and insist the refugees will
soon start feeling the difference. The groups say they are impatient to get into
Chechnya, but acknowledge it probably won't happen soon.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We're continuing our contacts so that we get access, but not just one-time
access,'' said Catliff at the Red Cross. ``It must be repeated access with all
the guarantees of security.''

<HEADLINE> Defense Spending Targets Troop Life  </HEADLINE>
   By ROBERT BURNS AP Military Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- In pitching President Clinton's proposed $277 billion
defense budget, Pentagon leaders are finding a Congress sympathetic to their
plan for spending billions more on ``quality of life'' programs for the troops:
another substantial pay raise, cheaper housing, easier access to health care.
</P>
<P>
	   Better treatment for the troops is a matter of growing importance and
urgency, in the view of Defense Secretary William Cohen and the service chiefs.
It also is good politics, especially in an election year.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The life blood of America's defense posture will continue to be the
individual soldier, sailor, airman and Marine,'' Cohen said. ``Their high
quality remains essential to future U.S. security under any threat scenario.''
</P>
<P>
	   Cohen told the House Armed Services Committee last week that military health
care reform was ``perhaps the single most important issue'' in the coming debate
over military spending.
</P>
<P>
	   But the most compelling aspect of that reform -- restoring full health
benefits to veterans over age 65 -- is not addressed in the 2001 budget plan,
mainly because of its multibillion dollar cost.
</P>
<P>
	   The Pentagon is pushing to make military life more attractive because
defense officials have come to realize the booming civilian economy is luring
potential recruits and enticing active-duty troops to leave the service.
</P>
<P>
	   In 1999, the Army could snag only 92 percent of the recruits it needed. The
Air Force also fell short, despite advertising on television for the first time.
The Navy and Marine Corps met their targets.
</P>
<P>
	   Last year the administration proposed a 4.4 percent pay raise for troops,
which Congress bumped up to 4.8 percent -- the biggest across-the-board increase
in military pay since the early 1980s.
</P>
<P>
	   The retirement pay system was changed so people who left after 20 years of
service would get 50 percent of base pay rather than 40 percent.
</P>
<P>
	   This year the administration is proposing a 3.7 percent pay raise, although
the new focus is housing and health care.
</P>
<P>
	   Clinton's proposal for the budget year that begins Oct. 1 includes
improvements in the military health care system known as Tricare. He is
requesting $80 million to provide an HMO-type health care benefit for military
members stationed far from military medical facilities.
</P>
<P>
	   The budget, however, does not address the problem of medical care for
veterans over age 65, who are getting squeezed out of the system as the number
of military medical facilities shrinks and the retiree population grows.
</P>
<P>
	   The Pentagon says it is weighing a number of possible solutions, and in the
meantime Congress is clamoring for quick action.
</P>
<P>
	   Sen. Tim Johnson, D-S.D., and Sen. Paul Coverdell, R-Ga., are pushing their
``Keep Our Promise Act,'' which would restore full health care benefits to
military retirees at an estimated annual cost of up to $10 billion.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The legislation would rectify a broken promise made to those servicemen
and women who were promised by recruiters that they would have fully paid health
care for life,'' Johnson said. ``Instead, many of the nation's military retirees
are suffering from a health care crisis.''
</P>
<P>
	   Rep. Gene Taylor, D-Miss., underscored the urgency of fixing the problem.
</P>
<P>
	   ``In south Mississippi alone, I've got about 14,000 military retirees who,
on a daily basis, are telling kids not to join the service because they feel
like they have been given the short stick when it comes to their health care,''
he told Cohen.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I think it would behoove the Joint Chiefs, it would behoove you, to solve
this problem this year, right now, even if it costs us as much as people have
said, which is anywhere from $5 billion to $10 billion,'' Taylor said.
</P>
<P>
	   Army Gen. Henry H. Shelton, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, made a
similar point during appearances on Capitol Hill last week.
</P>
<P>
	   ''(It's) not just the right thing to do; it is the smart thing to do,
because it also sends a very strong signal, not only to those serving today, but
also those that are considering a career in our armed forces,'' he said. ``And
it also keeps faith and keeps the commitment to those that have served and
retired.''
</P>
<P>
	   As for housing, the 2001 budget proposes that the 19 percent share of
off-base housing costs absorbed by military members today drop to 15 percent in
2001 and end by 2005.
</P>
<P>
	   That will cost the government about $3.1 billion. But by making it more
attractive to live off base, the Pentagon hopes to reduce demand for on-base
housing, which is scarce and in need of expensive renovations.

<HEADLINE> Military Hero Refuses Milosevic  </HEADLINE>
   By DANICA KIRKA Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) -- Police Capt. Slobodan Pajic is a most unlikely
dissident.
</P>
<P>
	   He marched off to defend Serbian interests in Kosovo, almost died in battle
and then did something highly unusual in this country: He snubbed President
Slobodan Milosevic.
</P>
<P>
	   His decision last month to reject the prestigious Knights' Sword medal for
his military service is a serious matter in Yugoslavia's dominant republic.
People here know that direct attacks on the president bring consequences and
police officers form the front line to safeguard the Milosevic regime.
</P>
<P>
	   Yet Pajic didn't hesitate to speak out.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I couldn't protect lives. I couldn't protect the territory,'' he says.
``Serbs were getting killed. Albanians were getting killed. All in all, I didn't
fulfill my task. I'm unable to receive my decoration based on that.''
</P>
<P>
	   Pajic stands out because ordinary Serbs don't publicly suggest that Kosovo
was lost not because the West was so strong, but because Serbia made mistakes.
</P>
<P>
	   Pajic became an overnight sensation. The independent daily Blic published a
profile. The weekly magazine Vreme put him on its cover. An independent station
put him on television.
</P>
<P>
	   These days, Pajic watches his back. He stays out of central Belgrade,
meeting visitors in dingy cafes far from the city. He won't speak about his
family or allow photos to be taken, and the only personal detail he reveals is
his age -- 35.
</P>
<P>
	   Milos Vasic, a military analyst for Vreme, says Pajic was the first
uniformed police officer who dared to criticize a war Milosevic used as a tool
to stay in power.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The poor guy really thought that (police) were fighting this war in Kosovo
so Kosovo would remain Serbian,'' Vasic says.
</P>
<P>
	   Pajic contends that Serb police in Kosovo weren't given the tools to win.
They were hampered from the start, he says, by poor equipment, including
camouflage uniforms in a vibrant blue that stood out against Kosovo's green
hills and primitive walkie-talkies that that permitted ethnic Albanian militants
to follow their every move.
</P>
<P>
	   Worse, he says, was the official government line that Serbia's police and
army were fighting disjointed bands of roving terrorists. In reality, Kosovo's
ethnic Albanian majority sought to shake off Belgrade's rule.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We cannot talk about terrorism. We can only talk about the rebellion of an
entire people,'' he says. ``Terrorists can control a house or two. ... Instead,
we had 20 villages -- entire areas -- controlled by vast groups of people. We
were fighting against an entire people.''
</P>
<P>
	   In ``that kind of situation,'' he says, the Serbs needed ``to be much better
prepared, better organized with a clear goal.''
</P>
<P>
	   Pajic, although a 16-year police veteran, claims he has always been the
black sheep in the insular world of the Serb force. Virtually the only civil
servants who are regularly paid in the increasingly impoverished country,
Serbia's police are considered the vanguard of privilege.
</P>
<P>
	   Pajic says he objected to the callous attitudes of others behind the blue
wall.
</P>
<P>
	   In one instance he related to Vreme, he'd returned to Belgrade after losing
two officers in combat and fully expected a reprimand. Instead, a higher officer
quizzed him on the whereabouts of a jeep he'd dropped off for repairs without
notifying his superiors.
</P>
<P>
	   Not surprisingly, other officers closed ranks and shut him out after he
rejected the military honor. He has little hope he'll keep working.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I was fully aware I could be suspended, fired, punished. But I was seeking
professionalism in the force,'' he says. ``That's why I joined the force. Either
I would improve it or I would leave.''

<HEADLINE> Smothers Bros. Lament Loss of Satire  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
    ASPEN, Colo. (AP) -- Daytime television viewers can watch kinky love affairs
unravel, but the Smothers Brothers still don't think prime-time viewers would
embrace the biting satire that got them fired 31 years ago.
</P>
<P>
	   "Today in prime time there's no political satire. I don't think the industry
has learned anything. The brightest people on TV are still on the fringes," said
Tom Smothers, who played the buffoon foil to his brother Dick.
</P>
<P>
	   The brothers participated in a discussion of the "Smothers Brothers Comedy
Hour" at the U.S. Comedy Arts Festival this weekend.
</P>
<P>
	   Following the show's cancellation, Tom Smothers said he fell into a funk and
"lost my sense of humor for three years after that."
</P>
<P>
	   But the comedy hour did lay the foundation for future satire.
</P>
<P>
	   "If not for the Smothers Brothers, there would be no 'Laugh In' or 'Saturday
Night Live,"' said Bill Maher, host of ABC's late night talk show "Politically
Incorrect," who led the discussion.

<TEXT>
<P>
    VIENNA, Austria (AP) -- Singer-songwriter Lou Reed has canceled a planned
performance in Vienna to protest the inclusion of Joerg Haider's right-wing
Freedom Party in Austria's new government.
</P>
<P>
	   "When people elect someone like him, it is their right to do so," Reed told
Austrian state radio, in comments published by the daily Standard Sunday. "But
that doesn't mean that other people have to voluntarily choose to be near him."
</P>
<P>
	   The new government, inaugurated Feb. 4, has split the country because of the
inclusion of Haider's party.
</P>
<P>
	   The Freedom Party, which seized on fears that immigration and European Union
expansion would cost Austrians jobs, finished second in the balloting with 27
percent of the vote.
</P>
<P>
	   Haider holds no position in the new government, but instead remains in
office as the governor of the province of Carinthia, in the south of the
country.
</P>

	   Reed is currently in Hamburg for the premiere of the Edgar Allen Poe musical
"POEtry," for which he wrote the libretto.

<HEADLINE> Vatican, Arabs Make Churches Deal  </HEADLINE>
   By SAMAR ASSAD Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) -- The Vatican will sign an agreement with the Palestinian
Authority on the status of Catholic churches in Jerusalem -- an indication it
recognizes Palestinian claims to the contested city, a Palestinian official said
Sunday.
</P>
<P>
	   The agreement will be signed Tuesday, when Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat
meets Pope John Paul II at the Vatican, Arafat adviser Nabil Abourdeneh said.
</P>
<P>
	   PLO and Vatican representatives began negotiating the deal two years ago in
Jerusalem, shortly after Israel and the Holy See signed an agreement to place
Catholic institutions in Israel and east Jerusalem under Israeli jurisdiction.
</P>
<P>
	   The Palestinians were concerned that the agreement implied recognition of
Israeli claims to the disputed sector, captured and annexed by Israel in 1967
but claimed by the Palestinians as the capital of a future state. Israel claims
the whole city as its eternal capital.
</P>
<P>
	   Emile Jarjoui, the PLO official who led talks with the Vatican, said the
agreement would ``regulate the relationship between the Palestinian Authority
and the Catholic churches in Jerusalem.''
</P>
<P>
	   ``The agreement would also state the Vatican's position regarding Jerusalem,
the peace process and Palestinian rights,'' Jarjoui said. The Vatican has called
Israel's annexation of east Jerusalem illegal, and does not recognize Israeli
sovereignty there.
</P>
<P>
	   Arafat seeks the Vatican's support in negotiations with Israel on Jerusalem.
Arafat and Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak are scheduled to produce a final
peace treaty by September.
</P>
<P>
	   Jerusalem Patriarch Michel Sabbah, the highest ranking Catholic official in
the Holy Land, said the Catholic church supports independence for both Israel
and the Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
	   ``All people must enjoy the same rights and statehood, an Israeli and
Palestinian state where Palestinians can live in freedom,'' Sabbah said.

<HEADLINE> Lawyers Told To Cut Work, Add Fun  </HEADLINE>
   By RICHARD CARELLI Associatred Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   DALLAS (AP) -- The sermon lasted two hours. The message: Too many are
unhappy and that doesn't have to be the case.
</P>
<P>
	   The soothing voice came not from a man of the cloth but of the bar. And his
audience of two dozen lawyers was not seeking to repent but to learn how to
handle stress.
</P>
<P>
	   Lawyer George Kaufman, a burnout victim at times during 37 years of
practice, wanted his professional colleagues to know they could balance life and
work.
</P>
<P>
	   On a day when most of the 3,000 attorneys attending the American Bar
Association's national convention studied ways to build a better law firm,
Kaufman zeroed in on lawyers' need to build better lives.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I think of stress as the elephant in our workplace,'' he said. ``It's
large and obvious, and makes it presence felt. And yet we go about our daily
business as though it didn't exist.''
</P>
<P>
	   Kaufman's two-hour sermon, ``Reducing Stress: A Primer on Balancing Life and
Work,'' was built on what he has observed during his law career -- that too many
lawyers are unhappy, and they don't have to be.
</P>
<P>
	   Chronic stress simply wears you down mentally and physically, Kaufman said,
citing a survey that ranked lawyers rank No. 1 among all professionals in
depression.
</P>
<P>
	   Kaufman, who lives in Saugerties, N.Y., and is affiliated with the Omega
Institute for Holistic Studies, believes self-enhancement and coping techniques
to manage stress are antidotes for lawyers, their families and their clients.
</P>
<P>
	   Do family, health and spiritual fulfillment rank higher among your core
values than monetary success and position? Then live your life accordingly, he
said.
</P>
<P>
	   What to do about a crushing workload? Kaufman suggested three healthy
options: Do not take on additional assignments, give some work back, and ask for
help.
</P>
<P>
	   If some of the assembled workaholics appeared unconvinced, maybe they just
were not listening.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Lawyers are terrific speakers and lousy listeners, Kaufman said. ``In a
room full of lawyers, the person who draws the first breath becomes the
designated listener.''
</P>
<P>
	   Taking a few deep breaths sometimes can help lawyers, he said, because the
very skills that make them good advocates ``often make resolution (of a dispute)
more difficult to achieve.''
</P>
<P>
	   Working too hard and too many hours can lead lawyers to view their jobs as
``devoid of service, devoid of feeling,'' Kaufman said. By allowing work to
override all other considerations, ``We have affected more than our health -- we
have affected the breadth and depth of who we might become.''
</P>
<P>
	   And that gets Kaufman to his bottom line: Lawyers ``are more than the work
we do.''

<HEADLINE> Bush Pushed Four Ideas in Texas  </HEADLINE>
   By MICHAEL HOLMES Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   AUSTIN, Texas (AP) -- In January 1995, when George W. Bush took office as
governor, the Legislature already had convened with Democrats holding majorities
in both the House and Senate. They also held the two most powerful legislative
jobs, House speaker and lieutenant governor.
</P>
<P>
	   Bush didn't butt his head against that wall. He came to the Capitol pushing
four ideas that already had bipartisan support -- getting tough on young
criminals, increasing local control over education, limiting civil lawsuits and
retooling welfare.
</P>
<P>
	   Lawmakers passed bills on all four, and a Bush political brochure grandly
declared the 1995 session ``the most substantive in Texas history.''
</P>
<P>
	   Now, on the presidential campaign trail and in Republican debates, Bush
rarely misses an opportunity to tout his record. Lately, he's taken to calling
himself a ``reformer with results.''
</P>
<P>
	   By one measure, he's achieved plenty of results, having signed 4,095 bills
into law.
</P>
<P>
	   But it's also apparent to some who have watched him closely that Bush's most
successful ``reforms'' have been those undertaken without great controversy, and
that when he's tried something particularly tough, like a big tax cut, he's had
to compromise.
</P>
<P>
	   Building his Texas record, Bush carefully picked popular legislative targets
-- from boosting education to cutting taxes -- while working closely with
Democrats.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I don't try to do all things for all people,'' he said in an interview.
</P>
<P>
	   After five years in office, his approach is clear: Government should do a
few things well, and an officeholder shouldn't squander his political capital.
</P>
<P>
	   ``He's been described as almost risk-averse,'' says Bruce Buchanan, a
University of Texas political scientist. ``He's not ideological. He's chosen a
small number of issues that are clear-cut and not terribly controversial.''
</P>
<P>
	   It's a pragmatic stance in a state where, even now, Republicans hold only a
one-vote Senate majority and Democrats have ruled the House for 120 years.
</P>
<P>
	   ``If he had come in with a hard-right program, he would have been demolished
his first six months in office by the Legislature,'' said George Christian, who
was President Johnson's press secretary. ``We don't have a hard-right
Legislature, and he wouldn't be running for president now.''
</P>
<P>
	   ``A lot of what he has done as governor is avoid the bad things,'' Christian
said. ``He hasn't been confrontational. He hasn't been dogmatic.''
</P>
<P>
	   Bush regularly emphasizes his push in Texas to lower property taxes.
</P>
<P>
	   He called on lawmakers in 1997 to cut school property taxes by $3 billion.
To reach that goal, he proposed a series of steps that included spending $1
billion of the budget surplus, raising the sales and motor vehicle sales taxes
and imposing a business activity tax.
</P>
<P>
	   That plan resurfaced in the presidential race, when former GOP rival Steve
Forbes accused Bush of breaking a no-new-taxes pledge, a charge Bush denies.
</P>
<P>
	   While the Legislature didn't adopt his plan, Bush still claimed victory.
After months of tense negotiations, a tax cut of $1 billion, funded from the
surplus, passed.
</P>
<P>
	   Bush tried again last year, calling for $2.7 billion in property, sales and
business tax cuts. Lawmakers again OK'd a smaller, $1.85 billion package.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I cut taxes,'' Bush said.
</P>
<P>
	   For many Texans, tax bills went up anyway.
</P>
<P>
	   School property taxes rose more than 8 percent in 1998, topping $11.3
billion, according to the state comptroller's office. Bush's campaign points to
rising property values across a booming state as one reason and argues that
taxes would have gone even higher without cuts.
</P>
<P>
	   Bush has pushed for tax-funded private school tuition vouchers, but the idea
has failed to attract legislative support.
</P>
<P>
	   He has declined to be drawn into the fray on some other issues.
</P>
<P>
	   There was a clamor last year to toughen the state's hate-crimes law after a
black man was dragged to death behind a pickup truck. The debate grew rancorous
as some lawmakers sought to extend hate-crimes protections to homosexuals.
Saying ``all crime is hate crime,'' Bush declined to intervene. The bill died.
</P>
<P>
	   However one reads his record, everyone says Bush has excelled at personal
persuasion.
</P>
<P>
	   Beginning with a meeting weeks before his 1994 election, Bush won over the
late Bob Bullock, his first lieutenant governor and the state's most powerful
Democrat. Four years later, even though he was godfather to Democratic nominee
Garry Mauro's daughter, Bullock endorsed Bush for re-election and said, ``I'd be
proud to call him my president.''
</P>
<P>
	   Bush goes out of his way to praise House Speaker Pete Laney, a West Texas
farmer and 26-year Democratic lawmaker.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The two people in the state who he had to reach out to to have any sort of
success were those two men. And he did it quite effectively,'' says Christian,
the former LBJ aide.
</P>
<P>
	   Bush's office is short on constitutional power but long on influence. Still
operating under a Reconstruction-era constitution from 1876, power is divided
among a half-dozen elected officials and a part-time Legislature.
</P>
<P>
	   Bush says he knew he had a choice when he first came to Austin, and getting
along was better than getting beat.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Politics is the art of passing legislation,'' he says. ``Today's reluctant
(lawmaker) may be tomorrow's ally.''

<HEADLINE> Look at George W. Bush's Record  </HEADLINE>
   By The Associated Press
<TEXT>
<P>
	   George W. Bush's views and record on major issues as governor of Texas:
</P>
<P>
	   ABORTION:
</P>
<P>
	   Would support a constitutional amendment to ban abortion except in cases of
incest, rape or to save the mother's life. But also has said, ``The country is
not ready for a constitutional amendment.''
</P>
<P>
	   Was praised by abortion opponents after the Texas Legislature in 1999
required parental notification before minors could obtain abortions.
</P>
<P>
	   BUDGET:
</P>
<P>
	   In 1994, candidate Bush criticized Democratic Gov. Ann Richards for growth
in the state's budget. But Bush's three, two-year budgets are bigger, too. The
current 2000-2001 budget spends about $98.1 billion -- nearly 31 percent more
than the last budget enacted before he took office.
</P>
<P>
	   Bush's campaign says the increase in part reflects a growing population.
</P>
<P>
	   EDUCATION:
</P>
<P>
	   Teacher salaries are up, although they remain about $3,000 below the
national average. Student scores on a state achievement test that Bush
strengthened after taking office also are up.
</P>
<P>
	   There has been a continued drive for local control of education while
holding schools accountable through a strong statewide rating system.
</P>
<P>
	   Also won approval of legislation meant to ensure that students are
academically prepared before they're promoted to the next grade. Texas still
lags behind the national average on SAT college entrance scores.
</P>
<P>
	   GUNS:
</P>
<P>
	   Approved a law to let Texans carry concealed weapons after undergoing
training and background checks. He also approved jailing juveniles caught with
illegal guns until a judicial hearing.
</P>
<P>
	   Supports instant background checks for buyers at gun shows, but declined to
back such a bill in the 1999 Legislature, calling it a federal matter.
</P>
<P>
	   The Texas Department of Public Safety under his administration failed to
refer for prosecution more than 700 felons who had tried to obtain concealed
handgun permits.
</P>
<P>
	   MINORITIES:
</P>
<P>
	   Made several high-profile appointments of Hispanics and blacks. During his
first term, Hispanics made up 11 percent of his appointees and blacks, 7
percent. In 1999, those figures rose to 15 percent for Hispanics and 8 percent
for blacks.
</P>
<P>
	   Bush, who speaks Spanish, campaigned hard for the traditionally Hispanic
vote in 1998 and pulled in at least 40 percent.
</P>
<P>
	   POLLUTION:
</P>
<P>
	   Says Texans are breathing cleaner air, but Houston in 1999 overtook Los
Angeles as the nation's smoggiest city.
</P>
<P>
	   Signed legislation requiring older power plants that were protected from
environmental regulations to reduce emissions by 2003 or close.
</P>
<P>
	   Signed bill encouraging about 800 industrial plants to voluntarily reduce
air pollution. Environmentalists say the legislation, drafted in concert with
the industry, falls short of what's necessary.
</P>
<P>
	   TAXES:
</P>
<P>
	   His most sweeping initiative, which he cites often while campaigning, was a
push to reduce school property taxes by $3 billion in 1997.
</P>
<P>
	   To do it, he proposed raising some other taxes, including sales and motor
vehicle sales taxes. The Legislature rejected much of the plan but passed a $1
billion tax cut funded from the budget surplus.
</P>
<P>
	   Bush tried again in 1999. Lawmakers again approved smaller cuts in property,
consumer and business taxes. For many Texans, tax bills went up anyway. Bush's
campaign points to rising property values across a booming state as one reason.
</P>
<P>
	   TORT REFORM:
</P>
<P>
	   Pushed for and signed legislation limiting civil lawsuits; said the changes
were good for business.
</P>
<P>
	   WELFARE:
</P>
<P>
	   Pushed for changes -- approved by lawmakers -- to require welfare recipients
to work, learn or get job training to receive benefits. Another bill limited
time on welfare. Federal law soon mandated similar work requirements and benefit
time limits.
</P>
<P>
	   His credentials as a ``compassionate conservative'' were questioned during
the 1999 legislative debate over a program for kids lacking health insurance.
</P>
<P>
	   Bush favored limiting eligibility to families at 150 percent of the poverty
level or less. Democratic lawmakers said that would leave 200,000 Texas children
without coverage. They eventually passed a bill setting the bar at 200 percent
of poverty, and Bush signed it.

<HEADLINE> Judge Tightly Controls Diallo Trial  </HEADLINE>
   By TOM HAYS Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) -- When defense attorney John Patten won an objection in
the Amadou Diallo murder trial last week, he made the mistake of thanking
Supreme Court Justice Joseph Teresi.
</P>
<P>
	   ``You don't have to thank me, Mr. Patten,'' a stern Teresi replied from the
bench. ``I call `em as I see `em.''
</P>
<P>
	   The scolding reflected the no-nonsense justice's firm control over his
courtroom in the racially charged trial of four white police officers. The New
York City officers are accused of murdering Diallo, an unarmed black man, in a
hail of 41 bullets.
</P>
<P>
	   Teresi, 53, surprised legal observers early on by ruling the trial could be
televised. But they say the real test may come over the question of allowing the
jury to consider lesser charges against the officers -- now accused of
second-degree murder -- like manslaughter.
</P>
<P>
	   ``It's probably the first moment in any criminal trial where the judge's
decision will be crucial,'' said James Long, a criminal defense attorney who has
tried cases before Teresi. ``He's equipped to handle it.''
</P>
<P>
	   Defendants Sean Carroll, 36, Kenneth Boss, 28, Edward McMellon, 27, and
Richard Murphy, 27, have pleaded innocent. If convicted, they face a maximum
sentence of 25 years to life in prison.
</P>
<P>
	   Lawyers who have dealt with Teresi said it was unusual for him to reserve
his ruling on a routine defense motion to dismiss the murder indictment at the
close of the prosecution case last week. They said that might signal doubts
about the charge.
</P>
<P>
	   The judge could give jurors the option to find the officers guilty of lesser
charges. Second-degree manslaughter -- recklessly causing someone's death --
carries a maximum sentence of 5 to 15 years; criminally negligent homicide --
failing to perceive the risk of death -- a maximum of 1 1/3 to 4 years.
</P>
<P>
	   Prosecutors allege the plainclothes officers made a ``conscious decision''
to corner Diallo, 22, on his doorstep in the Bronx on Feb. 4, 1999, and open
fire without warning; 19 bullets hit him. The defense counters that the officers
shot in self-defense after the West African immigrant refused orders to stop,
then pulled out a black object that turned out to be a wallet.
</P>
<P>
	   As the trial enters its third week, the officers must convince the jury that
they believed Diallo was a threat. Carroll -- one of two officers to fire all 16
rounds from his semiautomatic pistol -- was to take the witness stand as early
as Monday.
</P>
<P>
	   The slaying set off a wave of pretrial publicity and protests alleging
rampant police abuse of minorities. That prompted an appeals court to move the
case to Albany, where Teresi took over.
</P>
<P>
	   A graduate of Boston College and Albany Law School, Teresi spent more than
20 years as an assistant public defender before becoming a judge six years ago.
He once defended a police officer sued over the shooting of an unarmed man; the
case was settled before it went to trial.
</P>
<P>
	   The judge struck a blow for the First Amendment by ruling the state's ban on
cameras in court was unconstitutional. And he helped ensure the case would be
heard by a racially mixed jury by denying defense attempts to remove two black
women from the panel.
</P>
<P>
	   Albany prosecutors have been discouraged from talking about Teresi during
the Diallo trial. Defense attorneys described him as tough but fair.
</P>
<P>
	   ``He's like the nuns in Catholic school who loved you to death outside of
the classroom, but cracked your knuckles if you weren't on top of your lesson,''
said Long.
</P>
<P>
	   Civil rights lawyer Kevin Luibrand said only ``poor attorneys gripe about
(Teresi). ... He's good at shutting down lawyers who are trying to testify and
putting their words in people's mouths. Well-prepared ones have no problem.''
</P>
<P>
	   From the bench, Teresi has admonished verbose attorneys to ``move on.'' A
trial expected to last at least six weeks in the Bronx now could go only a
month.

<HEADLINE> Candidates Discuss Minimum Wage  </HEADLINE>
   By The Associated Press
<TEXT>
<P>
	   Three days a week, The Associated Press picks an issue and asks the
presidential candidates a question about it. Today's question and the responses:
</P>
<P>
	   Minimum Wage
</P>
<P>
	   Should the $5.15 federal minimum wage go up and, if so, by how much and over
what period?
</P>
<P>
	   Democrats:
</P>
<P>
	   Bill Bradley: ``I have proposed that the minimum wage should be raised by $1
per hour over two years, to $6.15. In addition, I have said that it should be
indexed to the increase in the median wage so low-income Americans who earn the
minimum wage don't fall further behind most Americans.''
</P>
<P>
	   Al Gore: ``Yes. I have called on the Congress to raise the minimum wage by
$1 over the next two years. I believe that the legislation passed recently by
the Congress does not move quickly enough to raise the minimum wage, and I
support the president's statement that he cannot sign that legislation in its
current form.''
</P>
<P>
	   Reform:
</P>
<P>
	   Pat Buchanan: ``I would go along with that, if you would take an exact
amount and cut the taxes on the small businesses that are threatened by that
increase.'' (Source: CNBC)
</P>
<P>
	   Republicans:
</P>
<P>
	   George W. Bush: ``I support raising the minimum wage as long as states are
given flexibility not to price entry level workers out of the market. In some
areas of the country, a high minimum wage could keep people from getting jobs.''
</P>
<P>
	   Alan Keyes: No response.
</P>
<P>
	   John McCain: ``Many small enterprises operate on a thin margin, and the
imposition of additional costs could result in the closure of businesses and the
loss of jobs. This only serves to hurt the very people an increase in the
minimum wage is designed to assist. I have opposed increasing the minimum wage
because of its detrimental effects on small businesses. However, recently I
supported an amendment increasing the minimum wage because it was combined with
tax and regulatory relief to offset the negative impact of increased personnel
costs on small businesses and the economy as a whole.''
</P>
<P>
	   ------
</P>
<P>
	   Eds: The Republican-led Senate this month passed a $1 increase in the
minimum wage, to be phased in through March 2002, and coupled the increase with
$18 billion in breaks, largely for small business. The House has yet to act.

<HEADLINE> Russians Target Key Chechen Gorge  </HEADLINE>
   By ANDREW KRAMER Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   SLEPTSOVSKAYA, Russia (AP) -- Russian forces focused their offensive against
Chechen rebels Sunday on a gorge cutting through the southern mountains where
thousands of fighters have strongholds.
</P>
<P>
	   Russia already claims to have another key gorge under control.
</P>
<P>
	   The Argun and Vedeno gorges have been important targets of the Russians
since thousands of rebels fled the Chechen capital, Grozny, this month. The
gorges provide main thoroughfares for rebels in the mountains.
</P>
<P>
	   Federal troops have taken control of the Vedeno Gorge and the fighting has
shifted to the Argun Gorge, the Interfax news agency said Sunday, citing the
North Caucasus military command. Several villages where rebels are believed to
be hiding have been encircled, Interfax reported.
</P>
<P>
	   Despite difficult weather conditions, Russian warplanes and helicopter
gunships flew more than 100 missions in Chechnya over the past 24 hours,
targeting the gorges, Interfax said Sunday.
</P>
<P>
	   Russian officials estimate that up to 8,000 rebels are in the mountains,
whose rugged terrain offers shelter for their hit-and-run guerrilla attacks.
</P>
<P>
	   The military command said the air attacks wiped out 18 rebel bases and
strongholds and destroyed two communication stations, according to Interfax.
</P>
<P>
	   But the Russian forces face substantial difficulty in routing the rebels
from the mountains. Russia has begun using larger bombs -- as big as 1 1/2 tons
-- to blast the rebels.
</P>
<P>
	   On Sunday, Interfax cited Defense Ministry officials as saying a
flame-thrower battalion would be sent to Chechnya to intensify the fight in the
mountains.
</P>
<P>
	   Russia's NTV television, quoting the military, said Sunday that the rebels
are planning large-scale terrorist operations in Chechen areas that the Russians
claim to have liberated.
</P>
<P>
	   The guerrilla campaign has already begun, and each operation may involve
from 300 to 500 rebels, NTV said.
</P>
<P>
	   Although Russia claims to control most of Chechnya after nearly five months
of fighting, rebels last week ambushed two military trains and attacked federal
units, demonstrating that they can still inflict bloody damage on Russian
forces.
</P>
<P>
	   Russia sent troops into Chechnya in September after Chechen-based Islamic
militants twice invaded the neighboring region of Dagestan. Authorities also
claim Chechen rebels are tied to apartment bombings that killed about 300 people
in Russia in September.

<HEADLINE> German Targets Nazi-Labor Firms  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   MUNICH, Germany (AP) -- A leading German politician is calling for protests
against German companies that used forced labor during World War II but have yet
to contribute to a proposed compensation fund.
</P>
<P>
	   Hans-Jochen Vogel, former chairman of the Social Democratic party, made the
appeal to ``engaged citizens'' in an article to appear in Monday's editions of
the Munich newspaper Abendzeitung.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We can't be indifferent when new shadows fall on the efforts of our nation
to come to terms with the darkest chapter of its history,'' Vogel wrote in the
letter, released Sunday by the newspaper. ``The impression is formed (that) to
the large majority of German companies, the level of annual profit or even
shareholder value is more important than the alleviation of human suffering.''
</P>
<P>
	   As of early this month, 130 German companies had announced they would take
part in the fund. But only $1 billion, less than half of industry's share, had
been pledged, fund spokesman Wolfgang Gibowski said at the time.
</P>
<P>
	   The government is to put up the other 50 percent of the $5 billion fund,
which it hopes to have operational this year.
</P>
<P>
	   The German Chamber of Commerce said last month it had sent letters to
220,000 companies in an attempt to drum up more support.
</P>
<P>
	   Vogel said he would like to see politicians and unions pressure companies
about why they have not yet joined.
</P>
<P>

continue to refuse with protest vigils,'' he wrote.

<HEADLINE> Iranian Vote Pits Clergy Vs. Change  </HEADLINE>
   By ANWAR FARUQI Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   DUBAI, United Arab Emirates (AP) -- Iran's legislative elections this week
pit a nation clamoring for greater democracy against an Islamic establishment
determined to preserve its hard-line rule.
</P>
<P>
	   Conservative clerics accuse their rivals of straying from the ideals of the
1979 revolution that ousted a dictatorial monarchy, while reformists say the
hard-liners failed to deliver their promises of freedom and prosperity.
</P>
<P>
	   The reformists' leader, President Mohammad Khatami, hopes that Friday's
elections will be a replay of the 1997 presidential vote in which he drew 20
million votes to his hard-line rival's 7 million.
</P>
<P>
	   Allowing Khatami to run was a grave miscalculation by the hard-liners. This
time, they have tried to disqualify as many reformists as possible, but many
remain in the race. More than 6,000 candidates are running for the 290-seat
Majlis, or parliament.
</P>
<P>
	   Khatami, a former culture minister, was a virtual unknown when the
presidential race began. His popularity took off only after the establishment
threw its weight behind hard-line candidate Ali Akbar Nateq-Nouri.
</P>
<P>
	   Iranians protested the conservative clergy by turning to Khatami. He has
used that support to fire a genuine reformist movement that has challenged the
absolute power of the hard-liners.
</P>
<P>
	   Khatami's calls for increased social and political freedoms have struck a
chord among Iranians, especially women and the young, who were instrumental in
getting him elected. He has appealed to both groups to vote in the legislative
elections.
</P>
<P>
	   Over the past few months, the hard-liners have shut down pro-reform
newspapers, jailed leading reformists and disqualified many of the top reform
candidates from the vote.
</P>
<P>
	   But new pro-democracy newspapers took the place of those that were closed,
and some reformists managed to get through the screening process controlled by
the hard-liners.
</P>
<P>
	   Two leading candidates are Mohammadreza Khatami, the president's brother,
and Alireza Nouri. Nouri's brother Abdollah Nouri, a former aide to Khatami and
an outspoken reformist, was sentenced in November to five years in jail for
political dissent.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Anti-reform forces did not manage to disqualify all the pro-reform
candidates,'' Hamidreza Jalaipour, a journalist whose candidacy was rejected,
wrote in his Asr-e-Azadegan daily. ``We should use the opportunity and turn out
in large numbers and vote those hopefuls that can be at the service of the
reformist movement.''
</P>
<P>
	   The reformists' greatest challenge has been to the position of supreme
leader, held by hard-liner Ayatollah Ali Khamenei. He is unelected and has
absolute veto power over all policy in Iran.
</P>
<P>
	   Many of the leading reformists themselves are former hard-liners who denied
freedom to their opponents and quashed opposition when they were in power.
</P>
<P>
	   Abbas Abdi was a leader of the students who stormed the U.S. Embassy in 1979
and held 52 Americans hostage for 444 days. He later became a top official in
the office of the prosecutor general. Now, he advocates freedom and ties with
the United States.
</P>
<P>
	   Sadeq Khalkhali, now staunchly behind Khatami, was known as ``the hanging
judge'' for ordering hundreds if not thousands of summary executions immediately
after the revolution. One of Khatami's closest aides, Saeed Hajjarian, was the
founder of Iran's notorious Intelligence Ministry.
</P>
<P>
	   They began to speak out for freedom of expression and greater political
plurality after being removed from positions of influence and silenced for
opposing the eight-year presidency of Hashemi Rafsanjani, who stepped down in
1997. At the time, he wanted to loosen state control over the economy, grant
greater freedoms and mend fences with the West.
</P>
<P>
	   Now Rafsanjani, who recently began leaning toward the hard-liners, has
become the bane of the reformists. His candidacy in this election has split the
reformist front.

<HEADLINE> Eccentric Contenders in Oscar Field  </HEADLINE>
    By DAVID GERMAIN AP Entertainment Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Oscar, the Academy Awards statue that resembles a man in
a straitjacket with arms tucked tightly to his torso, is having one of his most
neurotic years since "One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest."
</P>
<P>
	   With nominations coming down Tuesday, the wildly eccentric list of
contenders includes films about a social-climbing killer, a magical Death Row
inmate, chatty ghosts, tobacco-industry nasties, identity snatchers and
seriously, insanely dysfunctional families.
</P>
<P>
	   With no arguably great and lasting picture on the order of "Schindler's
List" or "The Silence of the Lambs" in 1999, Academy voters were handed a
remarkably diverse slate of Oscar potentials.
</P>
<P>
	   "The films in so many ways are so unexpected -- they're such unpredictable
stories," said Tony Angellotti, a publicist who works on studio Oscar campaigns
and is a member of the Academy that chooses nominees and winners.
</P>
<P>
	   Choices this year are as varied as some years of the 1970s, a prime era for
character-driven films. In 1975, "Cuckoo's Nest," a disturbing comic drama about
mayhem in a mental ward, won five Oscars, including best picture, actor for Jack
Nicholson, actress for Louise Fletcher and director for Milos Forman. Other
oddball films such as "Dog Day Afternoon" and "Nashville" also had best-picture
nominations that year.
</P>
<P>
	   This year's similarly varied slate "makes it more interesting, certainly,
and opens the playing field for all of us to consider everything," Angellotti
said.
</P>
<P>
	   "Other years, you have films where you can say, 'It looks like an Oscar
picture, it tastes like an Oscar picture. It must be an Oscar picture.' When you
have to consider everything, like this year, it confuses everyone."
</P>
<P>
	   Warts and all, here are some films looking like Oscar pictures this year:
</P>
<P>
	   --"American Beauty": How strange is it that the nominal best-picture
front-runner should be about a deluded dad who finds joy in smoking pot with the
neighbor kid and lusting after his daughter's cheerleading friend, and an
uptight mom who finds happiness with a warm gun?
</P>
<P>
	   The dark comedy about suburban dysfunction led the Golden Globes last month
with three awards: best dramatic picture, director Sam Mendes and screenwriter
Alan Ball. Kevin Spacey and Annette Bening are likely Oscar nominees, and
there's potential for some of the supporting cast.
</P>
<P>
	   --"The Insider": A darling among critics, the movie was a box-office
disappointment and a thorn in the side of "60 Minutes." The story of tobacco
whistleblower Jeffrey Wigand examined the newsmagazine's hesitancy to put his
story on the air. Besides a best-picture nod, likely nominees include actor
Russell Crowe and director Michael Mann. Christopher Plummer is in the mix as
supporting actor for his imperious take on Mike Wallace.
</P>
<P>
	   --"The Sixth Sense": The year's box office runner-up after "Phantom Menace,"
this ghost story probably will earn a supporting nod for child actor Haley Joel
Osment. M. Night Shyamalan could grab nominations both for directing and
screenplay, and Toni Collette has a shot at supporting actress. But will the
Academy see fit to grant a blockbuster thriller a best-picture nod?
</P>
<P>
	   --"Being John Malkovich": Inventive in the extreme, this tale about raiders
of actor Malkovich's mind won universal acclaim but may be too far out for
best-picture contention.
</P>
<P>
	   '"Malkovich' has a better chance than most people think," said Oscar watcher
Thomas O'Neil, who is writing a book about movie awards. "One of those voting
quirks is that the largest group in the Academy is actors. They see those two
words, 'John Malkovich,' in the title and that plays well with them."
</P>
<P>
	   Director Spike Jonze and writer Charlie Kaufman are in the running, while
Malkovich, Catherine Keener and possibly Cameron Diaz could earn supporting
nominations.
</P>
<P>
	   --"The Hurricane": Criticism about its veracity aside, the story of
boxer-turned-murder-convict Rubin Carter likely will gain a nomination for
Golden Globe winner Denzel Washington. The film also has prospects for best
picture and director Norman Jewison.
</P>
<P>
	   Also in the best-picture mix are "The Cider House Rules," based on John
Irving's orphanage novel; "The Talented Mr. Ripley," about a murderous
high-society wannabe; and maybe "The Green Mile," adapted from Stephen King's
Death Row novel about an inmate with supernatural powers.
</P>
<P>
	   Some other notable acting prospects are Golden Globe winners Hilary Swank in
her gender-bending role from "Boys Don't Cry," Janet McTeer as a flaky mom in
the road movie "Tumbleweeds," Tom Cruise as a TV misogynist in "Magnolia," and
Jim Carrey, who followed up last year's Oscar snub for "The Truman Show" by
winning a second straight Golden Globe, this time for playing the late comic
Andy Kaufman in "Man on the Moon."
</P>
<P>
	   "Nothing's certain in this year's Oscars," said Robert Bucksbaum, a film
analyst for Reel Source Inc. "I guess it's safe to say some films will not get
nominated. 'Deuce Bigalow' will not get a nomination."

<HEADLINE> Keyes Attracting Curious Crowds  </HEADLINE>
   By DAN LEWERENZ Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   COLUMBIA, S.C. (AP) -- Few in the crowd had heard Alan Keyes in person, but
they had heard plenty about him.
</P>
<P>
	   They had heard he was the last ``outsider'' remaining to challenge George W.
Bush and John McCain for the Republican presidential nomination. They had heard
he was a brilliant orator, a fire-and-brimstone preacher who wouldn't back down
from his strict, conservative stands.
</P>
<P>
	   They came to hear for themselves.
</P>
<P>
	   ``He's a political evangelist, and he preaches the truth,'' said Will
Grimsley, a Duke University student who, with his father, drove from North
Carolina to Columbia to see and hear Keyes late last week. ``Finally, we have a
candidate who is not afraid to tell the truth, regardless of the political
consequences.''
</P>
<P>
	   Keyes doesn't fail his audiences. Often he steps down from the podium,
preferring to speak eye-to-eye with his listeners about what he calls the
``moral crisis'' sweeping the nation.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I would rather lose every single election, starting with this one, without
a single vote than support something that God condemns,'' he declares.
</P>
<P>
	   He thunders against abortion. Against income taxes, gun control and big
government.
</P>
<P>
	   Many who come to listen to the talk-show host and former U.N. ambassador say
he's spreading the gospel.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I think Keyes represents truth,'' said William Shaheed, who usually votes
for Democrats and came to the Columbia rally unsure of Keyes. ``That sums it all
up -- he represents truth. All of the politicians seem to be saying the same
thing, but I think Keyes represents something new, something pure.''
</P>
<P>
	   Not everyone accepts Keyes and his message. Most polls show him far behind
Bush and McCain in the last week of campaigning before the Feb. 19 GOP primary
here.
</P>
<P>
	   In his second run for the Republican nomination this year, he finished third
in Iowa with 14 percent, then fourth in New Hampshire and Delaware with 6
percent and 4 percent respectively. But he's still standing, even as Gary Bauer
and Steve Forbes, the candidates with the conservative messages most like his
own, have dropped out.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I think it's great fun and folly,'' said Martha Wright, a Democrat and
sophomore at the University of South Carolina. Wright said she wanted to hear
what Keyes had to say, ``even if there's not a shadow of a chance'' she would
vote for him.
</P>
<P>
	   Keyes doesn't seem to care if his message isn't for everyone. And his zeal
only strengthens the resolve of supporters.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I don't think the message will resonate right now,'' said Eddie Guess,
pastor of the Good News Gospel Fellowship in Columbia, who is working to get
Keyes' message out to black voters. Keyes is the only black candidate among the
mainstream presidential contenders.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I think it's a seed. I think he's sowing seeds for a return to the moral
fiber that this country was founded on,'' Guess said.
</P>
<P>
	   Keyes counts on supporters, whatever their party, who are fed up with what
they see as an immoral government and pandering politicians.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Democrats will be able to cross over. In this state, I think there are a
lot of people who traditionally vote for Democrats, but they will listen,''
Keyes said. ``I know for a fact that my message is the one that appeals to a lot
of South Carolinians, and if what I'm saying makes sense, then maybe they'll
cast their votes.''
</P>
<P>
	   He urged crowds in Columbia and Orangeburg to ``change the existing order in
the national Republican Party.''
</P>
<P>
	   Supporters believe that can happen.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I think if the public hears his message, I think he has a great chance to
win this election,'' said Grimsley, the Duke student who came to hear him.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Miracles do happen,'' Guess said. ``Miracles do happen.''

<HEADLINE> Iraq Warns of Further Oil Cuts  </HEADLINE>
    By LEON BARKHO Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) -- Iraq has reduced its oil output and will consider
further cuts unless the United Nations removes its hold on contracts for spare
parts, the Iraqi trade minister said in remarks published Sunday.
</P>
<P>
	   With world oil prices rising and supplies being tight, a substantial cut in
Iraqi exports could push prices higher if the Organization of Petroleum
Exporting Countries continues to restrict its production.
</P>
<P>
	   U.N. figures and latest data released by the Oil Ministry show that Iraq has
slashed its U.N.-monitored oil sales by nearly 400,000 barrels a day.
</P>
<P>
	   Its output was about 2.9 million barrels last fall, of which about 2.3
million barrels daily were reserved for exports. Since the start of a new
agreement with the U.N. was reached in early December, Iraq has been exporting
at about 1.9 million barrels a day, according to figures from the United Nations
and the oil ministry.
</P>
<P>
	   "If the sanctions committee does not quickly approve contracts submitted to
it, Iraq will not be able to continue pumping to the previous levels," Mohammed
Mehdi Saleh told the U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan in Thailand this week,
according to the state-run newspaper Al-Thawra.
</P>
<P>
	   Saleh did not say by how many barrels Iraq would cut its output. But Oil
Minister Amer Mohammed Rashid told Cable News Network television on Saturday
that a cut of "a quarter million (barrels) or even more" was possible.
</P>
<P>
	   The sanctions committee vets contracts under the U.N. oil-for-food program
which allows Iraq to purchase food, medicine and essential goods in an exemption
to the embargo imposed after the 1990 invasion of Kuwait. U.S. and British
representatives on the committee have often delayed approval on grounds that
certain purchases could have a military use.
</P>
<P>
	   The prices of the benchmark North Sea oil hit nine-year highs of $28.20 a
barrel last week. The Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries is to decide
whether its production curbs, imposed last year to raise prices, will be
maintained at a meeting in Vienna next month.

<HEADLINE> One Killed in Violence in Kosovo  </HEADLINE>
   By ELENA BECATOROS Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   KOSOVSKA MITROVICA, Yugoslavia (AP) -- Fighting between peacekeepers and
snipers, along with grenade attacks on ethnic Albanians, killed one person and
reportedly wounded 18 Sunday in the bitterly divided city of Kosovska Mitrovica.
</P>
<P>
	   Two of the wounded were French soldiers, hit by ethnic Albanian snipers
firing from the northern, Serb-controlled part of the city, NATO officials said.
</P>
<P>
	   ``It was an attempt to kill our soldiers,'' French spokesman Lt. Col.
Patrique Chanliau said. ``We would like to believe it was an isolated incident
of extremists, of terrorists.''
</P>
<P>
	   One soldier was wounded in the stomach while on patrol in the Serb part of
the city, Chanliau said. The second soldier was shot in the arm after NATO
peacekeepers launched a counterattack, he said.
</P>
<P>
	   The counterattack killed one of the snipers and wounded five others. Grenade
attacks on ethnic Albanian houses in the north wounded seven, NATO said.
Peacekeepers imposed a dusk-to-dawn curfew.
</P>
<P>
	   Yugoslavia's state-run news agency, Tanjug, said a further four people,
identified as Serbs, had been wounded, at least one by a sniper.
</P>
<P>
	   Bursts of semiautomatic gunfire could be heard from the northern side of the
mostly Serb city located about 20 miles north of Pristina. Occasional explosions
sounded over the gunfire, which died down by afternoon.
</P>
<P>
	   Some sniping continued, Chanliau said, but the peacekeepers had located the
positions from where the snipers were firing.
</P>
<P>
	   Serb sources, who asked for anonymity, said the trouble began when several
ethnic Albanians from the southern side crossed a bridge over the Ibar River
leading to the Serb side and threw several hand grenades. A large number of
Serbs gathered, they said, and NATO peacekeepers tried to control the crowd.
</P>
<P>
	   However, NATO said all the grenade attack victims were ethnic Albanians
living in the north, suggesting Serbs were still trying to expel them from the
neighborhood.
</P>
<P>
	   U.N. police rescued two ethnic Albanians, Hysen Xhersheku and his wife,
Sofija, after one of their houses was damaged by a grenade and the other set
ablaze.
</P>
<P>
	   ``They beat us. They set our house on fire,'' Hysen Xhersheku said in the
safety of a U.N. police building in the city's south. He said that as they were
packing, about 10 Serbs entered their house and told them to leave in 10 minutes
or die.
</P>
<P>
	   Mukadez Bjqnovci, who fled from the north with her two young daughters and
two cousins, said she was beaten.
</P>
<P>
	   ``They were kicking and punching us all over our body,'' she said. ``They
were hitting us with sticks.''
</P>
<P>
	   At least 10 French tanks rumbled over the Ibar bridge from the ethnic
Albanian side. Civilians on the Albanian side were warned to take cover from
possible sniper fire from the Serb section. The bridge -- the scene of previous
confrontation -- was cordoned off with barbed wire.
</P>
<P>
	   An attempt by armed ethnic Albanians to ford the river and move into the
Serb-controlled side was rebuffed by peacekeepers firing warning shots, Chanliau
said.
</P>
<P>
	   Kosovo's most multiethnic city has been wracked by violence since Feb. 2,
when a grenade attack on a U.N. bus killed two elderly Serbs. Serbs have been
forcing ethnic Albanians to leave their homes in the northern part of the city,
despite appeals by U.N. chief administrator Bernard Kouchner and others.
</P>
<P>
	   Kouchner announced new security measures Friday, including peacekeeping
reinforcements. But the news did little to calm the situation.

<HEADLINE> Indonesia Chief Backs Down on Wahid  </HEADLINE>
   By SLOBODAN LEKIC Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) -- Indonesia's president ordered a formal
investigation Sunday into his security minister's role in last year's bloodshed
in East Timor, but backed down from earlier demands that the minister resign
immediately.
</P>
<P>
	   Gen. Wiranto will retain his Cabinet post pending the outcome of the
investigation, which should be completed within a month, Cabinet secretary
Marsilam Simanjuntak told reporters at the presidential palace.
</P>
<P>
	   President Abdurrahman Wahid ordered the investigation after meeting with
Wiranto, who has been accused by Indonesian and U.N. human rights panels of
overseeing the East Timor violence in September as commander of the armed
forces.
</P>
<P>
	   Wahid had returned a few hours earlier from a 16-day foreign tour, which was
overshadowed by his long-distance public row with the defiant general. During
the trip, Wahid repeatedly emphasized that Wiranto must either resign or be
sacked from the Cabinet for his alleged role in the violence.
</P>
<P>
	   It was unclear why Wahid changed his mind Sunday about the resignation of
Wiranto, who like many Indonesians uses only one name. The president frequently
has made strong statements on issues, only to ignore them later or change his
stance.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I asked (Wiranto) to resign, but he said he preferred to be investigated
by law, and I said 'Okay','' Wahid explained to reporters after the meeting.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I have ... the right to change my ministers,'' he said. ``After he is
inspected by law, then I will exercise my prerogative.''
</P>
<P>
	   Sunday's flip-flop effectively forestalled a showdown between the president
and army hard-liners linked to Indonesia's former dictator, Suharto.
</P>
<P>
	   Wahid's trip abroad was to focus on encouraging investment in Indonesia's
moribund economy. But that goal was largely forgotten as the media focused on
the political duel, which sparked fears of a possible military coup in Jakarta.
</P>
<P>
	   U.N. Secretary General Kofi Annan, who met briefly on Saturday with Wahid on
the sidelines of a U.N. trade conference in Bangkok, Thailand, said he was
following ``very closely'' the discussions between Wahid and Wiranto.
</P>
<P>
	   Annan told a press conference in Bangkok on Sunday that he would have a
``long session'' with Wahid when he visits Indonesia this week.
</P>
<P>
	   Two weeks ago -- after Wahid left for Saudi Arabia on the first leg of his
tour -- a government-sponsored human rights probe into the crisis in East Timor
recommended Wiranto be investigated by state prosecutors.
</P>
<P>
	   Soon after the report was made public, Wahid announced he would suspend
Wiranto. But Wiranto defied calls to step down. He denied any wrongdoing, and
insisted he would present his case to the president in person.
</P>
<P>
	   The general was a protege of Suharto, who ruled Indonesia for 32 years until
he was ousted in 1988. Wiranto was given the post of security minister last
October when Wahid took office.
</P>
<P>
	   Since then, Wiranto's relations with the reformist leader have deteriorated
because of the security forces' inability to stem a rising wave of religious and
separatist violence throughout the island nation.
</P>
<P>
	   As well as targeting Wiranto, Wahid also has been taking on Suharto himself.
His administration reopened a corruption probe against the 78-year-old autocrat,
and state lawyers named him as a suspect over allegations that his family got
rich on billions of dollars channeled through charitable foundations he set up
and controlled.

<HEADLINE> Gore Visits 2 Black Churches in NYC  </HEADLINE>
   By SANDRA SOBIERAJ Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   NEW YORK (AP) -- A week before he debates Bill Bradley at Harlem's Apollo
Theater, Vice President Al Gore squeezed in Sunday services at not one, but two,
black churches. ``Let us march on 'til victory is won,'' he preached.
</P>
<P>
	   His hand flying to his chest, Gore gasped at the surprise endorsement Rev.
Floyd B. Flake delivered from the pulpit of Allen A.M.E. Church in Queens just
after Gore addressed the congregation of New York's fastest-growing church.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I don't do endorsements from across the pulpit because I never know who's
out there watching the types of laws that govern separation of church and state,
but I will say to you this morning and you read it well: This should be the next
president of the United States,'' said Flake, a former Democratic congressman.
</P>
<P>
	   On what was to have been a rare day off, Gore rerouted his flight home
Saturday night from California to New York for the late additions to his
campaign schedule: 8:30 a.m. worship at Calvary Baptist Church, also in Queens,
and the 11:15 a.m. service at Allen, which stretched nearly three hours.
</P>
<P>
	   Gore was returning to New York on Monday for a speech at Medgar Evers
College in Brooklyn. Bradley, the vice president's Democratic opponent in the
hard-fought campaign for March 7 primaries in New York and California, took
Sunday off in California.
</P>
<P>
	   At both churches, Gore quoted a handful of Scriptures and hymns and recited
in rapid, staccato cadence all the top Clinton-Gore administration appointments
that went to blacks.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Just reflect for a moment. ... and the list goes on... We have been a
successful administration not in spite of diversity but because of diversity,''
Gore said to applause.
</P>
<P>
	   Gore's standing among the city's influential black activists was shaken a
week ago when Bradley visited Allen A.M.E. Church and was embraced by Flake and
the Rev. Al Sharpton. Both ministers had saluted Bradley for his outreach to
minority voters -- and criticized Gore's efforts.
</P>
<P>
	   In particular, Sharpton knocked Gore for not campaigning in many black
neighborhoods, and he threatened to ``mobilize against'' the vice president if
Gore did not agree to debate Bradley in front of a black audience in the city.
That debate is scheduled for Feb. 21 at the Apollo.
</P>
<P>
	   Between services, Gore looked for votes -- and grits and bacon -- at
Carmichael's Diner in southeast Queens.
</P>
<P>
	   At the counter and waiting for his own to-go breakfast order, James McNeill
was perturbed that the fuss over Gore was making him late for his shift driving
a bus at LaGuardia Airport.
</P>
<P>
	   He said he was an undecided voter and he resisted Gore's press for a
commitment of support. ``I got to see what the other guy's got to offer,''
McNeill said.
</P>
<P>
	   Gore aides stubbornly dodged the question of whether Gore will meet with
Sharpton, who has spoken of lingering ill feelings over Gore's 1988 presidential
campaign.
</P>
<P>
	   Then-New York Mayor Ed Koch, after endorsing Gore, had engaged in a racially
charged feud with the Rev. Jesse Jackson, another Democratic primary contender
that year.
</P>
<P>
	   Gore reminded the Allen congregation of a different anniversary -- the
``Bloody Sunday'' 35 years ago on March 7, when civil rights activists were
brutally blocked in their protest march through Alabama. Martin Luther King Jr.
had pledged that day not to be stopped, Gore said.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Well, we're going to make the final journey to justice together as
Americans,'' Gore said. Quoting a hymn by James Weldon Johnson, Gore added:
``Facing the rising sun of our new day begun, let us march on 'til victory is
won.''

<HEADLINE> Serbia Seeks Money for River Damage  </HEADLINE>
   By MISHA SAVIC Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   BECEJ, Yugoslavia (AP) -- Serbia on Sunday announced it will demand
compensation at an international court from those responsible for a cyanide
spill that has contaminated a major river, destroying most aquatic life.
</P>
<P>
	   Serbian Environment Minister Branislav Blazic said it would take at least
five years for life in the Tisa River to recover.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The Tisa has been killed. Not even bacteria have survived,'' Blazic said
as he toured the area along the river in northern Serbia. ``This is a total
catastrophe.''
</P>
<P>
	   ``We will demand an estimation of the damage and we will demand that the
culprits for this tragedy be punished,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
	   Romania, where the pollution originated, played down the environmental
damage. But people -- not just aquatic life -- are at risk because of the spill,
said Predrag Prolic, a professor of chemistry and toxicology at Belgrade
University.
</P>
<P>
	   He said those with wells close to the riverbed are in danger. Birds feeding
off fish could die, he said. The poisoned water also can filter into the soil
and then contaminate grass, grain, and livestock, Prolic said.
</P>
<P>
	   In Bucharest, Romania, Anton Vlad, an environmental official, suggested the
spill's effects had been overstated.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I have the impression that it is exaggerated,'' Vlad told national radio.
</P>
<P>
	   The cyanide spill originated in northwest Romania, near the border town of
Oradea, where a dam at the Baia Mare gold mine overflowed Jan. 30, causing
cyanide to pour into streams. At the mine, a cyanide solution is used to
separate gold ore from surrounding rock.
</P>
<P>
	   From there, the polluted water flowed west into the Tisa in neighboring
Hungary, killing large numbers of fish there, and then into Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
	   The spill was expected to reach the Danube River sometime Sunday. There was
no official word of that happening, but the Beta news agency cited eyewitnesses
late in the day who said the Danube was ``all white with the bellies of dead
fish'' between the area where it is joined by the Tisa, and Belgrade, about 50
miles to the southeast.
</P>
<P>
	   Vlad said that once the cyanide had reached the Danube, the pollution would
``disappear because the water levels in the Danube are tens of times higher than
the Tisa.''
</P>
<P>
	   Prolic said the Danube could dilute the spill enough to reduce its dangers,
but the spill still ``destroyed life in the Tisa for years to come.''
</P>
<P>
	   He said the peak concentration of cyanide in the river was 20 times the
permissible level. Poisonous heavy metals such as lead can be left behind after
the cyanide dissipates and can also leech into the soil, Prolic said.
</P>
<P>
	   In Serbia, dozens of volunteers and fisherman, wearing protective rubber
gloves, removed hundreds of dead fish from the Tisa to bury them. Heaps of them
littered the river bank.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Everything's dead, cyanide destroyed the entire food chain,'' said local
fisherman Slobodan Krkljes, 43. ``Fishing was my job, I don't know what I'm
going to do now.''
</P>
<P>
	   In Becej, a town on the Tisa about 55 miles north of Belgrade, police were
making sure no contaminated fish were brought to the town's market for sale.
Restaurants in the region have removed fish from their menus.
</P>
<P>
	   Experts and officials estimate that some 80 percent of the fish in the Tisa
have died since the contamination entered the country Friday.
</P>
<P>
	   The fertile plains of Serbia's north are also the country's breadbasket.
Water from the Tisa is traditionally used for irrigation.
</P>
<P>
	   Serbia's environment minister accused Romania of covering up the real
dimensions of the poisoning, which some environmentalists say could be the
biggest ecological catastrophe in Europe since the Chernobyl nuclear reactor
catastrophe in 1986. Blazic claimed the initial concentration of the cyanide in
Romania must have been enormous if the effects remained so deadly in Yugoslavia,
about 300-400 miles down the river.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Had we from Yugoslavia done something like this, we probably would have
been bombed,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
	   Blazic was referring to that NATO bombing of Yugoslavia last year over its
actions in Kosovo -- and a widespread belief here that the West is anti-Serb.
The cyanide spill adds to the ecological damage caused by NATO's bombing of oil
refineries and factories here.

<HEADLINE> Deadline Miss Prompts Mideast Worry  </HEADLINE>
   By RON KAMPEAS Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) -- It was supposed to have been a day of clarity, the first
time Israelis and Palestinians outlined the shape of a permanent, peaceful
coexistence.
</P>
<P>
	   Instead, Sunday, the deadline for the framework of a final status agreement
on the conflict's toughest issues -- Jerusalem, final borders and refugees --
was a blur of recriminations and dire predictions for a peace process gone awry.
</P>
<P>
	   Palestinians accuse Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak of neglecting them to
focus on talks with Syria; Israelis say Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat is
asking for too much, too soon.
</P>
<P>
	   Talks broke down early this month, and neither side knows when they will
resume. The delay could jeopardize the Sept. 13 deadline Barak and Arafat have
set for a full-fledged permanent agreement. And missing that date, both sides
worry, could lead to a total peace breakdown.
</P>
<P>
	   Barak told his Cabinet on Sunday that ``our responsibility is to try to
reach arrangements by the end of this year.''
</P>
<P>
	   ``The interest of terrorist groups to torpedo the process is very high,''
Barak said, according to an official in his office who spoke on condition of
anonymity.
</P>
<P>
	   In an effort to get the Palestinians back to the table, Barak's chief
negotiator said, Israel was ready to concede a key Palestinian demand: a
contiguous block of land in the West Bank, seen by the Palestinians as a crucial
underpinning to a future state.
</P>
<P>
	   Oded Eran also said explicitly for the first time that Israel will have to
give up some Jewish settlements.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I would have expected the Palestinian side to show the same good faith, to
come with clear positions on issues to move forward the negotiations,'' he told
The Associated Press.
</P>
<P>
	   Palestinians countered that Israel was wrapping offers that should have been
part of an interim agreement into a permanent status agreement -- a ploy, they
say, to make less seem like more.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Now Mr. Barak wants to merge the third phase (of an interim agreement)
with the permanent status,'' top Palestinian negotiator Saeb Erekat told the AP.
``We won't allow him, we won't let him do that.''
</P>
<P>
	   A similar disagreement broke up the talks on Feb. 3, when Arafat learned
that Barak was not prepared to hand over Arab suburbs of Jerusalem as part of an
interim withdrawal from 6.1 percent of the West Bank. Palestinians said that
showed bad faith.
</P>
<P>
	   Eran hinted that the suburbs will go to the Palestinians as part of a final
agreement, and chided the Palestinians for stoking hard-line Israeli opposition
to the talks by demanding the suburbs now.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Raising the (Jerusalem) issue now causes political problems in Israel,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
	   The result is that the sides are hardly speaking, and Israeli security
forces, acting on intelligence reports, braced on Sunday for a wave of terrorist
activity.
</P>
<P>
	   One poll showed that support among Palestinians for violent attacks against
Israel had increased from 36 percent in December to 43 percent. The poll by The
Center for Palestine Research and Studies had a margin of error of 3 percentage
points.
</P>
<P>
	   Palestinian leaders said Barak would do well to heed their growing
disappointment.
</P>
<P>
	   ``This reflects very negatively on the peace process,'' a top Arafat aide,
Nabil Abourdeneh, told the AP.
</P>
<P>
	   The official at the Cabinet meeting quoted Barak as saying that both sides
must take responsibility for the missed deadline: Barak for dithering five weeks
over whom to name to his team, and Arafat for ignoring the talks for a month in
a fit of pique prompted by renewed Israeli-Syrian talks in December.
</P>
<P>
	   The efforts with Syria have meanwhile collapsed, and guerrilla attacks on
Israeli troops in Lebanon have risen dramatically, killing seven so far. Syria
is the main power broker in Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
	   Yet the breakdown on the Palestinian track, while attracting less attention
-- Lebanon news drove the missed deadline to the inner newspaper pages on Sunday
-- could have more serious consequences.
</P>
<P>
	   Erekat said the almost seamlessly intertwined lives Israelis and
Palestinians lead would make violence harder to handle than the limited war
Israel wages in Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Syria is to Israel a strategic military threat, a threat that can be
deterred through agreements, demilitarization,'' Erekat said. ``But me to them
and them to me is a daily-life strategic threat.''

<HEADLINE> Barak Puts Off Lebanon Withdrawal  </HEADLINE>
   By JACK KATZENELL Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) -- Despite mounting public pressure for Israel to withdraw
its troops from southern Lebanon, Prime Minister Ehud Barak said Sunday that the
soldiers would not be coming home at least until April.
</P>
<P>
	   Barak's statements to his Cabinet came as the parents of a recently killed
soldier begged the prime minister to make their son's death the last Israeli
casualty in Lebanon. Some Cabinet ministers joined them Sunday, calling for an
immediate unilateral pullout.
</P>
<P>
	   Barak has promised to withdraw troops by July from a border zone in Lebanon
that Israel occupies to protect its northern towns. He had hoped to negotiate
the troop withdrawal through an agreement with Syria, the main power broker in
Lebanon. But with those negotiations frozen, Barak has begun to speak of the
possibility of a unilateral withdrawal.
</P>
<P>
	   Barak told his Cabinet during a closed meeting Sunday that if by April or
May there is no agreement on the horizon, Israel will ``know what to do,'' his
office said.
</P>
<P>
	   Meanwhile, Iranian-backed Hezbollah guerrillas on Sunday attacked Israeli
and allied militia outposts in southern Lebanon, shattering the relative calm
that has prevailed in the region for the past two days. The attack triggered
Israeli artillery bombardment of suspected guerrilla hideouts.
</P>
<P>
	   No casualties were reported. In a statement issued in Beirut, Lebanon,
Hezbollah said its guerrillas fired rockets at the Israeli military outpost in
Dabshe, two miles north of the Israeli border. An Israeli soldier was killed in
a similar attack at the outpost on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
	   Barak said he understands the fears of parents and of soldiers who want to
come home safely, but that it would take a few months to explore every chance of
achieving an agreement with Syria. Barak called on Israelis to maintain a
``stiff upper lip for a few more weeks,'' his office said.
</P>
<P>
	   The premier was responding, in part, to pleas by the parents of Sgt. Tzahi
Yitah, 19, killed Friday when an anti-tank missile fired by Hezbollah guerrillas
hit his outpost in Lebanon. He was the seventh Israeli soldier killed in Lebanon
in just over two weeks.
</P>
<P>
	   ``This earth is soaked in blood,'' the soldier's mother, Yafir Yitah said.
``Enough! My son Tzahi has fallen in Lebanon, and I want him to be the last.''
</P>
<P>
	   In a further sign of declining morale, soldiers have begun breaking a taboo
against publicly criticizing their commanders' decisions, giving interviews
questioning the point of dying in Lebanon if Israel is to withdraw soon anyway.
</P>
<P>
	   Israel maintains that Syria has used the Hezbollah attacks as a means of
pressuring Israel to give back the Golan Heights, captured in the 1967 Mideast
War. Israeli-Syrian peace negotiations broke off in January after a single
round.
</P>
<P>
	   The Syrians refuse to resume the talks unless Israel promises in advance to
return to the pre-1967 border. Israel has refused and insists that the depth of
the withdrawal in the Golan depends on the progress of the talks.

<HEADLINE> Episcopalians Withhold Gay Ruling  </HEADLINE>
   By JULIA LIEBLICH AP Religion Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   NEW YORK (AP) -- In a long-awaited report, an Episcopal Church commission
declined to take a position on same-sex unions.
</P>
<P>
	   If church leaders follow the report's recommendations, they would leave in
place an unofficial policy that lets individual dioceses decide whether to bless
gay marriages.
</P>
<P>
	   The report, to be released Monday, does not back either a liberal or
conservative position on gay marriage, which has become increasingly common in
the Episcopal Church.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We are not ready, theologically or scientifically, to say a defining word
about the life of homosexuals in the church,'' said the Standing Commission on
Liturgy and Music, whose recommendations will be discussed at the church's
national convention in July.
</P>
<P>
	   ``In the context of reverence -- and humility -- it seems best not to take
absolutist positions on a national level.''
</P>
<P>
	   Instead, the commission suggested the church leadership to ``allow dioceses
to find their own way in the matter,'' a continuation of an unofficial church
policy that has angered conservatives.
</P>
<P>
	   The report consists of essays on such subjects as scripture, tradition,
decision-making, and blessings. A paper by the Rev. I. William Countryman, a New
Testament scholar, concludes that the Bible ``is not definitive enough to demand
a negative judgment on the present subject.''
</P>
<P>
	   Officially, the Episcopal Church upholds the Christian tradition limiting
intimacy to heterosexual marriage. A 1998 meeting of the world's Anglican and
Episcopal bishops gave 88 percent approval to a declaration that homosexual
behavior is ``incompatible with Scripture.''
</P>
<P>
	   But conservatives object to more liberal attitudes in this country.
Conservative-liberal tensions heightened last month when, at St. Andrew's
Cathedral in Singapore, two conservative American priests were consecrated as
bishops to work in the United States without Episcopal Church authorization.
</P>
<P>
	   The United Methodist Church will debate the same-sex marriage issue in May.
Last week, the church decided not to bring charges against 68 ministers who
blessed a lesbian wedding to protest their church's ban on gay marriages.
</P>
<P>
	   In June, the Presbyterian Church (U.S.A.) will likely decide whether to
enact a prohibition on gay marriage. And Reform Judaism faces a showdown on same
sex marriage in March.

<HEADLINE> 'Scream 3' Mutes DiCaprio's 'Beach'  </HEADLINE>
    By DAVID GERMAIN AP Entertainment Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   LOS ANGELES (AP) -- "Scream 3" shouted down Leonardo DiCaprio's new film to
retain the top spot at the box office, according to industry estimates Sunday.
</P>
<P>
	   The third movie in the horror franchise took in $16.4 million in its second
weekend. DiCaprio's "The Beach," about an American backpacker's ill-fated search
for paradise, opened in second place with $15 million, according to Exhibitor
Relations Co. Inc., which tracks movie ticket sales.
</P>
<P>
	   Two kid-flicks also debuted in the top five. "Snow Day," a comedy about
children wreaking havoc when a blizzard closes their school, grossed $14.8
million for third place. The movie co-stars Chevy Chase, Jean Smart, Chris
Elliott and Pam Grier.
</P>
<P>
	   "The Tigger Movie," Disney's animated Winnie the Pooh tale, was No. 4 with
$9.2 million.
</P>
<P>
	   Last weekend's No. 2 film, the Oscar contender "The Hurricane," dropped to
fifth place with $3.6 million.
</P>
<P>
	   Ticket sales for "Scream 3" dropped 53 percent from its $34.7 million
opening last weekend. The movie has grossed $57 million in 10 days.
</P>
<P>
	   Panned by many critics, "The Beach" puts DiCaprio in a far darker role than
the heroic heartthrob he played in "Titanic," the all-time box-office leader.
</P>
<P>
	   Distributor 20th Century Fox said it was not disappointed by the film's No.
2 slot.
</P>
<P>
	   "Disappointing is when nobody comes to a movie. That's disappointment," said
Tom Sherak, the studio's head of distribution.
</P>
<P>
	   The movie's R rating cut off some of DiCaprio's biggest fans, girls under 17
who would have to see the movie with a parent or guardian. Even so, women made
up 57 percent of the movie's audience, and more than half of them were under 25.
</P>
<P>
	   "There were a lot of guys that went to the movie, and there was enough
adventure in it for them. But anytime you have a male star that females are
really interested in, they're generally dragging the guys to see it," Sherak
said.
</P>
<P>
	   After two months that were heavy on adult-oriented films vying for Oscar
consideration, the weekend offered a truly diverse lineup.
</P>
<P>
	   "It's the first weekend in a long time that spoke to every demographic,"
said Paul Dergarabedian, president of Exhibitor Relations. "A horror movie with
'Scream 3,' a date movie with DiCaprio, a movie for the family and older kids
with 'Snow Day,' and 'Tigger' for families with little kids."
</P>
<P>
	   Estimated ticket sales for Friday through Sunday at North American theaters,
according to Exhibitor Relations. Final figures were to be released Monday:
</P>
<P>
	   1. "Scream 3," $16.4 million.
</P>
<P>
	   2. "The Beach," $15 million.
</P>
<P>
	   3. "Snow Day," $14.8 million.
</P>
<P>
	   4. "The Tigger Movie," $9.2 million.
</P>
<P>
	   5. "The Hurricane," $3.6 million.
</P>
<P>
	   6. "The Green Mile," $3 million.
</P>
<P>
	   7. "Next Friday," $2.8 million.
</P>
<P>
	   8. "Stuart Little," $2.7 million.
</P>
<P>
	   9. "Galaxy Quest," $2.2 million.
</P>
<P>
	   10. "Eye of the Beholder," $2.1 million.

<HEADLINE> German Telecom May Expand Business  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
    MUNICH, Germany (AP) -- Seeking to capitalize on Internet growth in Europe,
telecom giant Deutsche Telekom reportedly is working on deals to offer
high-speed Internet access over cable television lines and to expand outside its
home base of Germany.
</P>
<P>
	   The Sueddeutsche Zeitung reported in its weekend edition that Telekom had
reached a deal with Munich-based Kirch media group to purchase 51 percent of its
subsidiary Beta Research for almost $500 million (1 billion marks).
</P>
<P>
	   Beta Research developed the set-top decoder box for Kirch's digital
television venture, and the next generation box will also have the capability to
provide Internet access, according to the newspaper report.
</P>
<P>
	   A Telekom spokesman declined to comment on the reports. A Kirch spokesman
would say only that discussions were ongoing.
</P>
<P>
	   Both companies confirmed last week that they wanted to cooperate in
developing technology for multimedia, but were not specific.
</P>
<P>
	   The Sueddeutsche newspaper also said Telekom and Commerzbank are considering
forming a joint venture to turn Telekom's Internet service, T-Online, into an
international service that could better compete with AOL Europe.
</P>
<P>
	   T-Online is Europe's biggest Internet provider, with 4.2 million customers
-- almost all in Germany. AOL Europe, a joint-venture of media giant Bertelsmann
and America Online, has 3.8 million members, mainly in Britain and Germany.

<HEADLINE> Sicilian Volcano Puts on Show  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   CATANIA, Sicily (AP) -- Mount Etna is putting on its latest spectacular show,
but the fiery volcano's eruption is posing no danger to tourists and natives on
its slopes, experts said Sunday.
</P>
<P>
	   Etna roars to life every few months. Its last major eruption was in 1992.
</P>
<P>
	   ``It's really spectacular,'' said Luciano Scarfi, one of 40 experts on a
monitoring team near the crater. ``No town or people are in danger,'' Scarfi
said in a telephone interview.
</P>
<P>
	   Skiers on Etna's slopes this winter have been able to enjoy the show of
orange-yellow bursts of flame. Many rural villages dot the mountain's slopes on
the side away from the hot lava flow.
</P>
<P>
	   The last time the volcano was so active was in September.

<HEADLINE> 'Peanuts' Fans Reflect on Schulz  </HEADLINE>
   By ROGER PETTERSON Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   The coincidence of Charles Schulz's death one day before his final
``Peanuts'' appeared in newspapers weighed heavily Sunday on fans of Charlie
Brown, Snoopy and Lucy.
</P>
<P>
	   ``It's real sad. He did a really neat strip and it really touched a lot of
people's lives. It's really too bad he couldn't enjoy his retirement,'' said
Charles Weier, who lives in the house in St. Paul, Minn., where Schulz spent his
teen-age years.
</P>
<P>
	   ``It's not fair. It felt like a shame,'' said lifelong fan Sherron Courneen,
56, of New York City, as she waited for a plane at Newark International Airport.
</P>
<P>
	   Schulz was diagnosed with colon cancer and suffered a series of small
strokes during emergency surgery in November 1999, and announced his retirement
a few weeks afterward.
</P>
<P>
	   In addition to the last appearance of a new ``Peanuts'' strip, Sunday was
officially Charles ``Sparky'' Schulz Day in St. Paul.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We will all miss his daily dose of wisdom,'' St. Paul Mayor Norm Coleman
had said Saturday when he proclaimed the observance, before Schulz's death. ``In
each of his characters, we see a little bit of ourselves.''
</P>
<P>
	   About 250 people ignored snow and temperatures in the teens Saturday as
Coleman unveiled an ice sculpture of the Peanuts characters.
</P>
<P>
	   ``It's just ironic that in your last comic strip you're gonna call it all
and ... all of a sudden you die. You kind of think maybe he had it planned,''
said Rick Micheltree, a cook at Mickey's Diner in St. Paul.
</P>
<P>
	   Schulz's first feature, ``Li'l Folks,'' was developed for the St. Paul
Pioneer Press in 1947. In 1950, it was sold to a syndicate and the name changed
to ``Peanuts.''
</P>
<P>
	   ``Nobody thought he was too good, to tell you the truth, because he had a
whole different style,'' Mort Walker, creator of ``Beetle Bailey,'' said Sunday
from Boca Raton, Fla., in an interview with WCCO in Minneapolis. ``He didn't do
the traditional solid cartoon, which was kind of slapstick humor. But he brought
in pathos, failure, rejection, all that stuff and somehow made it funny.''
</P>
<P>
	   ``It's sad to think that he didn't get the chance to see his last strip
running in the paper,'' Tom Batiuk, cartoonist of ``Funky Winkerbean'' and
``Crankshaft,'' said Sunday from his home in Medina, Ohio. ``It would have been
nice to see him bask in the glory of it a little bit more.''
</P>
<P>
	   ``I am part of that generation of cartoonists that were just devoted to his
work,'' Batiuk added. ``Strips prior to his time reflected the world around us,
he opened a door to the world inside us and allowed us to share feelings that
are common to everyone.''
</P>
<P>
	   Mell Lazarus, who draws the ``Momma'' and ``Miss Peach'' strips, knew Schulz
for 42 years.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I think 'Peanuts' has been for most of its existence the best comic strip
in history, and nothing's ever approached it,'' Lazarus said. ``He's going to be
missed and will clearly never be replaced.''
</P>
<P>
	   ``He made it possible for new cartoonists to be inspired and get their
start. He was a master of timing in every way,'' said Hank Ketcham, creator of
``Dennis the Menace.''
</P>
<P>
	   Charlie Brown was the favorite ``Peanuts'' character for Don Tansey, 50, of
Short Hills, N.J., because it was so easy for people to relate to him.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The guy's always trying to do the best for others, and he gets left
behind. It's a theme that happens so much in this country. The nice people get
left behind,'' Tansey said.

<HEADLINE> Indonesia President Demands Probe  </HEADLINE>
   By SLOBODAN LEKIC Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) -- Indonesia's president ordered a formal
investigation Sunday into his security minister's role in last year's bloodshed
in East Timor, but backed down from earlier demands that the minister resign
immediately.
</P>
<P>
	   Gen. Wiranto will retain his Cabinet post pending the outcome of the
investigation, which should be completed within a month, Cabinet secretary
Marsilam Simanjuntak told reporters at the presidential palace.
</P>
<P>
	   President Abdurrahman Wahid ordered the investigation after meeting with
Wiranto, who has been accused by Indonesian and U.N. human rights panels of
overseeing the East Timor violence in September as commander of the armed
forces.
</P>
<P>
	   Wahid had returned a few hours earlier from a 16-day foreign tour, which was
overshadowed by his long-distance public row with the defiant general. During
the trip, Wahid repeatedly emphasized that Wiranto must either resign or be
sacked from the Cabinet for his alleged role in the violence.
</P>
<P>
	   It was unclear why Wahid changed his mind Sunday about the resignation of
Wiranto, who like many Indonesians uses only one name. The president frequently
has made strong statements on issues, only to ignore them later or change his
stance.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I asked (Wiranto) to resign, but he said he preferred to be investigated
by law, and I said 'Okay','' Wahid explained to reporters after the meeting.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I have ... the right to change my ministers,'' he said. ``After he is
inspected by law, then I will exercise my prerogative.''
</P>
<P>
	   Sunday's flip-flop effectively forestalled a showdown between the president
and army hard-liners linked to Indonesia's former dictator, Suharto.
</P>
<P>
	   Wahid's trip abroad was to focus on encouraging investment in Indonesia's
moribund economy. But that goal was largely forgotten as the media focused on
the political duel, which sparked fears of a possible military coup in Jakarta.
</P>
<P>
	   U.N. Secretary General Kofi Annan, who met briefly on Saturday with Wahid on
the sidelines of a U.N. trade conference in Bangkok, Thailand, said he was
following ``very closely'' the discussions between Wahid and Wiranto.
</P>
<P>
	   Annan told a press conference in Bangkok on Sunday that he would have a
``long session'' with Wahid when he visits Indonesia this week.
</P>
<P>
	   Two weeks ago -- after Wahid left for Saudi Arabia on the first leg of his
tour -- a government-sponsored human rights probe into the crisis in East Timor
recommended Wiranto be investigated by state prosecutors.
</P>
<P>
	   Soon after the report was made public, Wahid announced he would suspend
Wiranto. But Wiranto defied calls to step down. He denied any wrongdoing, and
insisted he would present his case to the president in person.
</P>
<P>
	   The general was a protege of Suharto, who ruled Indonesia for 32 years until
he was ousted in 1988. Wiranto was given the post of security minister last
October when Wahid took office.
</P>
<P>
	   Since then, Wiranto's relations with the reformist leader have deteriorated
because of the security forces' inability to stem a rising wave of religious and
separatist violence throughout the island nation.
</P>
<P>
	   As well as targeting Wiranto, Wahid also has been taking on Suharto himself.
His administration reopened a corruption probe against the 78-year-old autocrat,
and state lawyers named him as a suspect over allegations that his family got
rich on billions of dollars channeled through charitable foundations he set up
and controlled.

<HEADLINE> Quotes From 'Charlie Brown' Book  </HEADLINE>
   By The Associated Press
<TEXT>
<P>
	   Quotations from Charles Schulz's 1980 book ``Charlie Brown, Snoopy and Me.''
</P>
<P>
	   ``Actually, I don't really know if I was aware (as a child) that there were
such things as comic strip artists. I liked the funny papers and I was
fascinated by them and read every one, but I suppose I didn't realize that you
could make a living drawing until I was in my early teens.''
</P>
<P>
	   ------
</P>
<P>
	   On early efforts at professional cartooning: ``I must confess that, at the
time, I had only a meager interest in drawing little kids. I drew them because
they were what sold.''
</P>
<P>
	   ------
</P>
<P>
	   On the name `'Peanuts,'' picked when he started at United Feature Syndicate:
``I disliked the name then, as I do now, but in spite of my objection, they
liked it; thus, the strip was named `Peanuts.' ... Who was I, an unknown kid
from St. Paul, to argue with them? I gave in.''
</P>
<P>
	   ------
</P>
<P>
	   ``I have never regarded children as my main audience. The real fans are
adults, from high school age on up, for they have memories of what it was like
to be a child, and can appreciate `Peanuts' much more deeply than can the
youngsters.''
</P>
<P>
	   ------
</P>
<P>
	   ``You can't create humor out of happiness. I'm astonished at the number of
people who write to me saying, `Why can't you create happy stories for us? Why
does Charlie Brown always have to lose? Why can't you let him kick the
football?' Well, there is nothing funny about the person who gets to kick the
football.'''
</P>
<P>
	   ------
</P>
<P>
	   ``I like to think of Charlie Brown as being a bit of Everyman. ... He tries
to assume a perfect social image, but everything seems to go wrong. There is a
lot of myself in his character, too.''
</P>
<P>
	   ------
</P>
<P>
	   On the inspiration for Snoopy, a childhood pet named Spike: ``He was the
smartest and most uncontrollable dog that I have ever seen. ... One day I
counted up and realized that Spike had a vocabulary of at least 50 words. You
could say to him, `Spike, do you want a potato? Why don't you go downstairs and
get a potato?' and he would immediately go down to the basement and stick his
head in the potato sack and bring up a potato.''
</P>
<P>
	   ------
</P>
<P>
	   ``Lucy and Linus are the only characters who have tiny half circles around
their eyes. Charlie Brown and Snoopy have them when they are confused or
surprised, but Lucy and Linus always look as if their eyes were slightly out of
focus.''
</P>
<P>
	   ------
</P>
<P>
	   ``Of all the things in the strip, I think that I am most proud of Linus'
security blanket. I may not have invented the term, but I like to think that I
helped make it a part of our language.''

<HEADLINE> SingTel Denies Calling Off Merger  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
    HONG KONG (AP) -- Singapore Telecommunications on Sunday denied a media
report that it may call off a planned merger with Hong Kong's Cable &AMP; Wireless
HKT to give way to a rival bid by a local Internet investment company.
</P>
<P>
	   SingTel and Cable &AMP; Wireless HKT said they are still in talks despite
Pacific Century Cyberworks Ltd.'s unexpected announcement Friday that it also
wants to link up with Hong Kong's dominant telecommunications provider.
</P>
<P>
	   "We are denying the report. The talks are still going on," SingTel spokesman
Lim Seng Jin said late Sunday.
</P>
<P>
	   Lim said the company would make an announcement "when there's material
development" in the talks.
</P>
<P>
	   Hong Kong's Sing Tao Daily on Sunday quoted an unidentified source in
Singapore as saying that SingTel wants to withdraw from the planned deal because
of potential political hurdles in Hong Kong and Beijing.
</P>
<P>
	   Critics in Hong Kong worry the deal would give Singapore's government too
big a role in rival Hong Kong's fast-developing telecom industry. The government
owns a majority stake in SingTel and would become a key shareholder in the $60
billion merged entity.
</P>
<P>
	   The newspaper said SingTel is awaiting official approval from the Singapore
government to announce its withdrawal.
</P>
<P>
	   Hong Kong-based Pacific Century Cyberworks approached Cable &AMP; Wireless HKT
for a merger deal on Friday in which the latter's shareholders would receive
cash and Pacific Century shares.
</P>
<P>
	   No offer or agreement has been made, the statement added.
</P>
<P>
	   Pacific Century is controlled by Richard Li, whose father Li Ka-shing is one
of Hong Kong's wealthiest businessmen. The elder Li is owner of Hutchison
Whampoa, a major provider of mobile phones in the territory.
</P>
<P>
	   Formed less than a year ago, Pacific Century is setting up an Internet
network in Asia and is valued at $29.3 billion.
</P>
<P>
	   Cable &AMP; Wireless HKT, which is 54 percent held by Cable &AMP; Wireless PLC of
Britain, has lost its services monopoly in Hong Kong.

<HEADLINE> Fifteen Vie for Russian Presidency  </HEADLINE>
   By JIM HEINTZ Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   MOSCOW (AP) -- Fifteen people have applied to run next month for Russia's
presidency, including acting President Vladimir Putin and Communist Party chief
Gennady Zyuganov, the head of the election commission said Sunday, the final day
for applying.
</P>
<P>
	   Putin is the clear favorite for the March 26 ballot, according to recent
opinion polls that show more than 50 percent of respondents supporting him. His
nearest challenger, Zyuganov, has about 20 percent of respondents' support.
</P>
<P>
	   Others who applied for the race -- submitting property and income
declarations and the signatures of at least 500,000 supporters -- were Grigory
Yavlinsky, leader of the reformist Yabloko party, and nationalist firebrand
Vladimir Zhirinovsky.
</P>
<P>
	   The applications of Zyuganov and Alexei Podberyozkin, of the small leftist
Spiritual Heritage group, have already been approved. The rest are to be
examined over the next eight days.
</P>
<P>
	   Election commission head Alexander Veshnyakov said on NTV television that he
did not expect all the applications to be approved, but did not elaborate.
</P>
<P>
	   Putin's strong performance in opinion polls appears to reflect wide approval
of his tough stance on the war in Chechnya and his law-and-order image. But his
position on many of the issues troubling Russia remains unclear. With just six
weeks to go before the election, he still has not released an economic platform.
</P>
<P>
	   Zyuganov has repeatedly criticized Putin for failing to put forward a clear
platform. That criticism was echoed Saturday by two other prominent politicians.
</P>
<P>
	   Moscow's Mayor Yuri Luzhkov, a leader of the moderate Fatherland-All Russia
movement, said Putin remained ``a blank piece of paper.''
</P>
<P>
	   The movement's co-leader, Yevgeny Primakov, challenged Putin to fight
corruption and ``take a firm position on the negative activities'' of people in
former President Boris Yeltsin's entourage.
</P>
<P>
	   Putin vaulted into public awareness only in August, when he became prime
minister. He was Yeltsin's clear favorite to succeed him in the presidency, and
his prospects rose substantially when Yeltsin unexpectedly resigned on Dec. 31
and forced elections to be moved up from June.
</P>
<P>
	   Among the other applicants for the presidential race was Yuri Skuratov, whom
Yeltsin tried to fire as Russia's prosecutor-general while Skuratov was
investigating Kremlin corruption allegations.

<HEADLINE> Low Turnout for Zimbabwe Referendum  </HEADLINE>
   By ANGUS SHAW Associated Press
<TEXT>
<P>
	   HARARE, Zimbabwe (AP) -- A two-day referendum seen as a gauge of President
Robert Mugabe's waning support ended Sunday with voters turning out in smaller
numbers than expected and monitors criticizing irregularities in the election.
</P>
<P>
	   Zimbabweans were voting on proposed changes to the constitution that would
allow Mugabe to retain most of his powers despite growing opposition to his
rule. The constitutional changes also would allow the government to seize land
owned by white descendants of British settlers without paying compensation.
</P>
<P>
	   For a second day, fewer voters turned out than expected, officials said.
Rain hindered communications between voting stations and provincial centers,
however, and no official figures were available, said chief elections officer
Tobaiwa Mudede.
</P>
<P>
	   During voting Saturday, lines for scarce gasoline and kerosene were longer
than those at voting stations.
</P>
<P>
	   A low turnout is expected to favor a ``yes'' vote to the changes. Results
are expected Monday.
</P>
<P>
	   Election monitors provided by civic groups and churches reached only 65
percent of the 3,600 voting stations nationwide, said Isaac Maphosa, a
monitoring coordinator.
</P>
<P>
	   Maphosa said monitors were ordered out of polling stations Sunday in
southern Zimbabwe and others were prevented from remaining with ballot boxes
overnight after voting Saturday. Some boxes were taken to police stations.
</P>
<P>
	   In Chivi, also in the south, monitors saw at least 50 ballot boxes delivered
to a government office before polling closed. Monitors also said locked boxes
were loaded into a police jeep during polling in the eastern city of Mutare,
Maphosa said.
</P>
<P>
	   ``There should be no movement of boxes during voting,'' Maphosa said.
</P>
<P>
	   In the township of Highfields, a top opposition leader and eight supporters
were arrested.
</P>
<P>
	   Tendai Biti, a leader of the Movement for Democratic Change and a prominent
human rights lawyer, was accused, along with party colleagues, of inflammatory
campaigning and incitement to violence.
</P>
<P>
	   Biti and his colleagues denied the accusations.
</P>
<P>
	   The group had been using a bullhorn to draw voters to the polls and were not
in breach of voting rules, said Lovemore Madhuku, an official of the National
Constitutional Assembly, an ally of the main opposition party.
</P>
<P>
	   The National Constitutional Assembly, -- a coalition of civic, human rights,
church and lawyers' groups opposed to the revised constitution -- has accused
the government of preventing election monitors from reaching all the polling
stations.
</P>
<P>
	   Madhuku said voter education programs were inadequate and that there were no
ballots in local languages in rural areas where English is uncommon.
</P>
<P>
	   The official Zimbabwe news agency reported that some voters in the eastern
Manicaland province believed the poll was a presidential vote either to endorse
Mugabe's rule or elect opposition leader Morgan Tsvangirai to replace him.
</P>
<P>
	   An economic crisis has spurred the biggest opposition challenge to Mugabe's
party since he led the former British colony of Rhodesia to independence in 1980
as Zimbabwe.
</P>
<P>
	   Inflation has reached a record 70 percent, unemployment has soared to 50
percent and diesel, gasoline and power shortages since December have crippled
transport, industry and agriculture.

<HEADLINE> Jewish Leader Defends Haider  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   VIENNA, Austria (AP) -- A leader of an Israeli community in Austria on Sunday
criticized Israel's decision to ban the entry of Austria's right-wing leader as
a populist move.
</P>
<P>
	   George Wozasek, president of the Linz Israeli Cultural Community about 90
miles west of Vienna, said he had been surprised at the vehemence of the
worldwide reaction to the inclusion of Joerg Haider's Freedom Party in the new
Austrian government.
</P>
<P>
	   The reaction gave the impression that ``stronger states wanted to interfere
in Austria's internal politics, and by doing so, they were doing no good,''
Wozasek told Austrian state radio, according to the Austrian Press Agency.
</P>
<P>
	   Israel banned Haider from visiting Israel after his party became one-half of
the Austrian government earlier this month. At the same time, the 14 other EU
members announced they would scale back their relations with Austria.
</P>
<P>
	   The current situation is different from that of 1933, when Hitler came to
power and his party policies were well known, he said.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Haider comes from the postwar generation,'' he said. ``He has never
personally murdered or tortured anyone.''
</P>
<P>
	   Even though Haider is known abroad for praising some aspects of the Nazi
era, many Austrian critics of Haider consider him more an opportunist who
switches stances according to his audience, rather than someone close to Nazi
ideology.
</P>
<P>
	   Meanwhile in Budapest, Hungary, about 10,000 people rallied Sunday against
war, fascism and hate-mongering.
</P>
<P>
	   The rally was held exactly one year after hundreds neo-Nazis from various
parts of Europe marched through Budapest's streets. This weekend, the Free
Democrats put up posters in the city, saying, ``Nazis Not Welcome.''
</P>
<P>
	   ``We want to live without hatred and without fear,'' Imre Mecs, member of
parliament representing the liberal Free Democrats, told the crowd. Mecs was
sentenced to death after the suppression of the 1956 revolt against Soviet rule
for his role as a university activist, but his sentence was commuted.
</P>
<P>
	   Hungarian President Arpad Goencz and former premier Gyula Horn, of the
Socialist Party, joined in the demonstration, which followed a smaller one
Saturday night in support of Haider.
</P>
<P>
	   Speakers at Sunday's rally did not name Haider or refer to the fact that
Istvan Csurka's Hungarian Truth and Freedom Party had organized the Saturday
rally in support of the Austrian politician.
</P>
<P>
	   But there were many references to the dangers of a revival in far-right
ideology.
</P>
<P>
	   Mecs had a message for the three parties in Hungary's own center-right
coalition.
</P>
<P>
	   ``When the government coalition accepts the support of the far right, it
becomes an accomplice,'' Mecs told the crowd, to loud applause.
</P>
<P>
	   Sunday's rally was organized by the Civil Forum, a loose alliance of civic
groups, NGOs and the writers union.
</P>
<P>
	   Hungary's neo-Nazis scheduled a demonstration for Tuesday in front of the
Austrian Embassy to express support for Haider.

<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- For the third time in a week, President Clinton is
welcoming Hispanic leaders to the White House. Aides say it reflects concern
Hispanic voters may overlook Clinton's record in favor of Republican George W.
Bush.
</P>
<P>
	   The White House is seizing on the chance to highlight the Clinton
administration's record on behalf of the nation's fastest-growing population
group.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The president himself has noticed that the Latino community is intrigued
with the Republican Party and the Bush candidacy,'' a senior administration
official said.
</P>
<P>
	   On Monday, Clinton was to receive a lifetime achievement award from the
League of United Latin American Citizens, the first time the nonpartisan group
has honored a president.
</P>
<P>
	   Clinton planned to cite expansions of education and health-care programs
that have benefited Hispanics, as well as record lows in unemployment and the
poverty rate among Hispanics.
</P>
<P>
	   Republicans, he may note, have moved to cut legal immigrants from the
Medicaid and food stamp programs, and tried to keep illegal immigrant children
out of public schools.
</P>
<P>
	   In the past two presidential elections, Hispanics voted overwhelmingly for
Clinton -- 72 percent to 21 percent in 1996, and 61 percent to 25 percent in
1992.
</P>
<P>
	   But Bush has shown he can attract support from Hispanics. The Texas
governor, who sometimes speaks to Hispanic crowds in Spanish, took 49 percent of
the Hispanic vote during his re-election in 1998, according to a statewide
election-day poll by the Voter News Service for The Associated Press and
television networks.
</P>
<P>
	   The White House ceremony is in recognition of Clinton's record and does not
amount to a political endorsement, said Brent Wilkes, national executive
director of the nonpartisan group.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We're not saying, `Hispanics, stay with the Democratic Party,''' Wilkes
said.
</P>
<P>
	   During its annual legislative meeting this week, the group will hear from a
prominent Hispanic member of the administration, Army Secretary Louis Caldera,
as well as an equally prominent Hispanic Republican and frequent Clinton critic,
Rep. Ileana Ros-Lehtinen of Florida.
</P>
<P>
	   ``It's good for the community to be sought after by both parties,'' Wilkes
said. ``I don't think it's healthy to be identified with only one party.''
</P>
<P>
	   Last week, Clinton paid tribute to Alfred Rascon, an immigrant from Mexico
belatedly awarded the Medal of Honor for valor during the Vietnam War. Rascon's
immigrant status got nearly equal billing with his battlefield heroism.
</P>
<P>
	   Also last week, Hispanic members of Congress met with Clinton and top aides
to discuss three Hispanic nominees for federal judgeships. None has been
confirmed by the Republican-led Senate, although the GOP leadership has promised
a vote by mid-March on Richard Paez, whose nomination has languished four years.
</P>
<P>
	   Clinton was struck by national polls last month reflecting growing Hispanic
support for Republican themes, said the White House official, who spoke on
condition of anonymity.
</P>
<P>
	   As a result, the president wants to make Hispanics aware of his record and
stakes involved in this year's election, the official said.
</P>
<P>
	   Last month, a Public Policy Institute of California poll showed that Bush,
the GOP presidential front-runner, would draw at least 40 percent of the
Hispanic vote in November -- almost double what Republican nominee Bob Dole
received in 1996.
</P>
<P>
	   Top Republican officials have said the GOP must capture at least 40 percent
of the Hispanic vote to remain competitive.
</P>
<P>
	   The survey showed Bush would draw 40 percent of the Hispanic vote against
Vice President Al Gore and 45 percent against Democrat Bill Bradley.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The Democrats have every reason to take proactive measures to reassure the
Hispanic community about its Democratic Party roots,'' said Mark Rozell,
political science professor at Catholic University. ``George W. Bush has shown
real vote-getting potential among Hispanic voters, and that is unusual for a
Republican.''

<HEADLINE> One Killed in Violence in Kosovo  </HEADLINE>
   By ELENA BECATOROS Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   KOSOVSKA MITROVICA, Yugoslavia (AP) -- Fighting between peacekeepers and
snipers, along with grenade attacks on ethnic Albanians, killed one person and
reportedly wounded 19 Sunday in the bitterly divided city of Kosovska Mitrovica.
</P>
<P>
	   Two of the wounded were French soldiers, hit by ethnic Albanian snipers
firing from the northern, Serb-controlled part of the city, NATO officials said.
</P>
<P>
	   ``It was an attempt to kill our soldiers,'' French spokesman Lt. Col.
Patrique Chanliau said. ``We would like to believe it was an isolated incident
of extremists, of terrorists.''
</P>
<P>
	   One soldier was wounded in the stomach while on patrol in the Serb part of
the city, Chanliau said. The second soldier was shot in the arm after NATO
peacekeepers launched a counterattack, he said.
</P>
<P>
	   The counterattack killed one of the snipers and wounded five others. Grenade
attacks on ethnic Albanian houses in the north wounded seven, NATO officials
said. And an American with the U.N. police force was also injured by glass
shards, after gunfire from outside broke the windows of a train he was riding
on.
</P>
<P>
	   Yugoslavia's state-run news agency, Tanjug, said four more people,
identified as Serbs, were wounded, at least some by snipers.
</P>
<P>
	   Seventeen people were detained by late Sunday, NATO said, but gave no
details. Peacekeepers imposed a curfew from sunset to daybreak.
</P>
<P>
	   Bursts of semiautomatic gunfire could be heard from the northern side of the
mostly Serb city located about 20 miles north of Pristina. Occasional explosions
sounded over the gunfire, which died down by afternoon.
</P>
<P>
	   Some sniping continued, Chanliau said, but the peacekeepers had located the
positions from where the snipers were firing.
</P>
<P>
	   Serb sources, who asked for anonymity, said the trouble began when several
ethnic Albanians from the southern side crossed a bridge over the Ibar River
leading to the Serb side and threw several hand grenades. A large number of
Serbs gathered, they said, and NATO peacekeepers tried to control the crowd.
</P>
<P>
	   However, NATO said all the grenade attack victims were ethnic Albanians
living in the north, suggesting Serbs were still trying to expel them from the
neighborhood.
</P>
<P>
	   U.N. police rescued two ethnic Albanians, Hysen Xhersheku and his wife,
Sofija, after one of their houses was damaged by a grenade and the other set
ablaze.
</P>
<P>
	   ``They beat us. They set our house on fire,'' Hysen Xhersheku said in the
safety of a U.N. police building in the city's south. He said that as they were
packing, about 10 Serbs entered their house and told them to leave in 10 minutes
or die.
</P>
<P>
	   Mukadez Bjqnovci, who fled from the north with her two young daughters and
two cousins, said she was beaten.
</P>
<P>
	   ``They were kicking and punching us all over our body,'' she said. ``They
were hitting us with sticks.''
</P>
<P>
	   At least 10 French tanks rumbled over the Ibar bridge from the ethnic
Albanian side. Civilians on the Albanian side were warned to take cover from
possible sniper fire from the Serb section. The bridge -- the scene of previous
confrontation -- was cordoned off with barbed wire.
</P>
<P>
	   An attempt by armed ethnic Albanians to ford the river and move into the
Serb-controlled side was rebuffed by peacekeepers firing warning shots, Chanliau
said.
</P>
<P>
	   Kosovo's most multiethnic city has been wracked by violence since Feb. 2,
when a grenade attack on a U.N. bus killed two elderly Serbs. Serbs have been
forcing ethnic Albanians to leave their homes in the northern part of the city,
despite appeals by U.N. chief administrator Bernard Kouchner and others.
</P>
<P>
	   Kouchner announced new security measures Friday, including peacekeeping
reinforcements. But the news did little to calm the situation.

<HEADLINE> Gas Prices Rise 4 Cents Per Gallon  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
    LOS ANGELES (AP) --Gasoline rose more than 4 cents per gallon at the pump in
the past three weeks on the strength of unseasonably higher demand and a surge
in crude oil prices, an industry analyst said Sunday.
</P>
<P>
	   The national average price on Friday, including all grades and taxes, was
$1.4105 per gallon, up 4.29 cents, according to the Lundberg Survey of 10,000
stations nationwide.
</P>
<P>
	   The average still is about a nickel per gallon off the all-time peak of
about $1.46, recorded in November 1990.
</P>
<P>
	   Winter months see a drop in gasoline usage as drivers stay off the roads,
but January's demand was 5.5 percent higher than for the same period in 1999,
analyst Trilby Lundberg said.
</P>
<P>
	   That "speaks volumes, because January is the month when Americans consume
the least gasoline," Lundberg said.
</P>
<P>
	   The price hike might have been as much as a penny more, but dealers
sacrificed some profit margin, she said.
</P>
<P>
	   "Wholesale gasoline prices in the past three weeks rose more than retail
prices to consumers," Lundberg said.
</P>
<P>
	   Crude oil prices are up amid uncertainty over whether the Organization of
Petroleum Exporting Countries will increase demand when an agreement on lowered
production expires next month.
</P>
<P>
	   "If they do cancel export reductions next month then the chances of a severe
gasoline price run-up this spring and summer, when U.S. gasoline demand picks
up, would be much reduced," Lundberg said.
</P>
<P>
	   Prices at self-service stations averaged $1.3625 for regular unleaded
gasoline, $1.4595 for mid-grade and $1.5432 for premium.
</P>
<P>
	   Full-service prices were $1.6744 for regular, $1.7605 for mid-grade and
$1.8323 for premium.

    TOKYO (AP) -- Japanese supermarket chain operator Nagasakiya Co. on Sunday
filed for bankruptcy protection with the Tokyo District court.
</P>
<P>
	   Nagasakiya, established in January 1948, had been in the process of
restructuring. The nationwide retailer, which employs about 2,600 people, said
it plans to continue operating its 95 stores.
</P>
<P>
	   The Tokyo-based parent company has $2.8 billion in debt. The group's total
debt, including that at affiliated companies, $4 billion, Nagasakiya said.
</P>
<P>
	   The company said earlier this month it will suffer a larger-than-expected
net loss of $167 million in the fiscal year ending Feb. 29.

<HEADLINE> 'Peanuts' Fans Reflect on Schulz  </HEADLINE>
   By ROGER PETTERSON Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   The coincidence of Charles Schulz's death one day before his final
``Peanuts'' appeared in newspapers weighed heavily Sunday on fans of Charlie
Brown, Snoopy and Lucy.
</P>
<P>
	   ``It's real sad. He did a really neat strip and it really touched a lot of
people's lives. It's really too bad he couldn't enjoy his retirement,'' said
Charles Weier, who lives in the house in St. Paul, Minn., where Schulz spent his
teen-age years.
</P>
<P>
	   Schulz was diagnosed with colon cancer and suffered a series of small
strokes during emergency surgery in November 1999, and announced his retirement
a few weeks afterward.
</P>
<P>
	   In addition to the last appearance of a new ``Peanuts'' strip, Sunday was
officially Charles ``Sparky'' Schulz Day in St. Paul.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We will all miss his daily dose of wisdom,'' St. Paul Mayor Norm Coleman
said Saturday when he proclaimed the observance, before Schulz's death. ``In
each of his characters, we see a little bit of ourselves.''
</P>
<P>
	   About 250 people ignored snow and temperatures in the teens Saturday as
Coleman unveiled an ice sculpture of the Peanuts characters.
</P>
<P>
	   ``It's just ironic that in your last comic strip you're gonna call it all
and ... all of a sudden you die,'' said Rick Micheltree, a cook at Mickey's
Diner in St. Paul.
</P>
<P>
	   Schulz's first feature, ``Li'l Folks,'' was developed for the Saint Paul
Pioneer Press in 1947. In 1950, it was sold to a syndicate and the name changed
to ``Peanuts.''
</P>
<P>
	   ``Nobody thought he was too good, to tell you the truth, because he had a
whole different style,'' Mort Walker, creator of ``Beetle Bailey,'' said Sunday
from Boca Raton, Fla., in an interview with WCCO-TV in Minneapolis. ``He didn't
do the traditional solid cartoon, which was kind of slapstick humor. But he
brought in pathos, failure, rejection, all that stuff and somehow made it
funny.''
</P>
<P>
	   ``It's sad to think that he didn't get the chance to see his last strip
running in the paper,'' Tom Batiuk, cartoonist of ``Funky Winkerbean'' and
``Crankshaft,'' said Sunday from his home in Medina, Ohio. ``It would have been
nice to see him bask in the glory of it a little bit more.''
</P>
<P>
	   ``I am part of that generation of cartoonists that were just devoted to his
work,'' Batiuk added. ``Strips prior to his time reflected the world around us,
he opened a door to the world inside us and allowed us to share feelings that
are common to everyone.''
</P>
<P>
	   Mell Lazarus, who draws the ``Momma'' and ``Miss Peach'' strips, knew Schulz
for 42 years.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I think 'Peanuts' has been for most of its existence the best comic strip
in history, and nothing's ever approached it,'' Lazarus said. ``He's going to be
missed and will clearly never be replaced.''
</P>
<P>
	   ``He made it possible for new cartoonists to be inspired and get their
start. He was a master of timing in every way,'' said Hank Ketcham, creator of
``Dennis the Menace.''
</P>
<P>
	   ``For 50 years, his keen eye, his good and generous heart, and his active
brush and pen have given life to the most memorable cast of characters ever to
enliven our daily papers,'' President Clinton said in a statement Sunday. ``The
hopeful and hapless Charlie Brown, the joyful Snoopy, the soulful Linus -- even
the 'crabby' Lucy -- give voice, day after day, to what makes us human.''
</P>
<P>
	   Charlie Brown was the favorite ``Peanuts'' character for Don Tansey, 50, of
Short Hills, N.J., because it was so easy for people to relate to him.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The guy's always trying to do the best for others, and he gets left
behind. It's a theme that happens so much in this country. The nice people get
left behind,'' Tansey said.

<HEADLINE> Bush Concerned About Democrats  </HEADLINE>
   By JANELLE CARTER Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Gov. George W. Bush expressed concern Sunday that
Democrats are mobilizing to support Sen. John McCain in South Carolina's open
Republican presidential primary.
</P>
<P>
	   But McCain said Bush's allegation that some Democrats believe McCain would
be the easier candidate to defeat in the general election in November ``flies in
the face of the facts.''
</P>
<P>
	   ``The facts are that independents are also flocking in large numbers to my
candidacy as well as Republicans,'' McCain said on CBS' ``Face the Nation.''
``Everybody knows that if you're going to win a general election, you have to
have those independents and some Democrats.''
</P>
<P>
	   He said it was his message that was attracting non-Republicans.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I'm very proud that Libertarians or vegetarians or anybody would consider
supporting me because I have a vision of reform for America that I think is
taking hold, not only in South Carolina but all over the country,'' McCain said.
</P>
<P>
	   Still, Bush and his surrogates claimed -- without offering proof -- that
Democrats were trying to skew the results of Saturday's GOP primary, in which
non-Republicans may vote.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The only thing I'm concerned about is that Democrats flock into the
Republican primary to decide who the Republican nominee is, and then head back
for the Democrats in the general election,'' Bush said on NBC's ``Meet the
Press.''
</P>
<P>
	   Pat Robertson, founder of the Christian Coalition and a Bush supporter,
alleged on CBS that ``people who are allied with (Vice President) Al Gore are
indeed making telephone calls to try to encourage Democrats to vote in the
Republican primary ... I think that they consider him a weaker candidate than
Governor Bush.''
</P>
<P>
	   Gore campaign spokesman Chris Lehane dismissed the claims, saying the Texas
governor was ``increasingly sounding like a rattled candidate.''
</P>
<P>
	   ``I would suggest that he focus on earning the support of Republicans in his
own primary rather than worrying about what Democrats are doing,'' Lehane said.
</P>
<P>
	   Bush's concern, however, has been expressed about other states with open
primaries.
</P>
<P>
	   Voting is open to non-Republicans in several upcoming GOP contests,
including South Carolina, Michigan, Virginia, North Dakota, Missouri and
Georgia. States with so-called closed primaries have reported a flood of
inquiries from people hoping to switch their registration to Republican.
</P>
<P>
	   McCain defeated Bush by 18 percentage points in the New Hampshire primary by
securing a majority of GOP voters and a virtual sweep of the state's large
independent bloc.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We are very concerned about any attempts by liberal Democrats to come into
our party for the purpose of creating mischief as opposed to an enduring
philosophy,'' said Bush campaign spokesman Ari Fleischer said. ``We welcome all
voters who will enter the Republican primary who intend to vote Republican now
and in November.''
</P>
<P>
	   A Newsweek poll Saturday showed Bush and McCain in a dead heat in South
Carolina, and both candidates are intensifying their efforts as the primary
nears.
</P>
<P>
	   Some 200,000 people that McCain's campaign has identified as having voting
histories that cross back and forth between party primaries are being inundated
with telephone calls and mailings.
</P>
<P>
	   For his part, Bush has bought the $45,000 in air time that became available
after Steve Forbes quit the Republican contest, boosting the governor's radio
and television expenses in South Carolina to $2.8 million, according to
Fleischer.
</P>
<P>
	   On other subjects, Bush:
</P>
<P>
	   -- Defended his decision to appear at Bob Jones University in Greenville.
The Christian school once refused to accept blacks and continues to ban
interracial dating.
</P>
<P>
	   ``There were 6,000 students and voters there. I went because I wanted to get
out my message of compassionate conservatism. ... When I go to speak to voters,
I don't necessarily have to embrace the policies of the university,'' Bush said.
McCain said he had no plans to visit the university and would condemn its
policies if he appeared there.
</P>
<P>
	   -- Declined to pull campaign ads that are critical of McCain. Last week,
McCain halted negative advertising about Bush and promised a positive campaign
from here on out.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I understand how to defend myself and I'm going to do so. And my record,
I've got a good record and a record of leadership. And I'm not going to get
defined as somebody I'm not,'' Bush said.
</P>
<P>
	   -- Said he would not follow Illinois Gov. George Ryan and impose a
moratorium on death penalty executions ``because I'm confident that every person
who has been put to death in Texas under my watch has been guilty of the crime
charged and has had full access to the courts.''

<HEADLINE> More Crash Victims' Bodies Found  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   ABIDJAN, Ivory Coast (AP) -- Divers scouring the ocean floor recovered four
bodies on Sunday and will probably call off the search for more, two weeks after
a Kenya Airways jet crashed into the Atlantic just after takeoff.
</P>
<P>
	   Only 10 of 179 people on board survived and only 119 bodies have been
recovered.
</P>
<P>
	   With the plane wreckage and remaining bodies slipping every day into deeper
water, Sunday's search was probably the last, Kenya Airways spokesman Fred Kiige
said.
</P>
<P>
	   ``It's apparent it's becoming more dangerous to the divers,'' Kiige said.
One Kenyan military diver has died while searching amid the wreckage, which on
Sunday was about 200 feet under water.
</P>
<P>
	   Kiige said 119 bodies had been recovered, but in worse condition each day
and increasingly difficult to identify.
</P>
<P>
	   After talking with family members, Kenya Airways decided to call off the
search, he said. But that decision could change following discussions with
Ivorian government officials on Monday, he said.
</P>
<P>
	   Flight 431 crashed 2 miles offshore just moments after it took off Jan. 30
from Abidjan's seaside airport.
</P>
<P>
	   The rescue effort has been slow from the start, with Ivorian authorities
relying at first on unpaid amateurs from an Abidjan diving club. Later,
professional divers were brought in with specialized equipment from South Africa
and United Arab Emirates.
</P>
<P>
	   Kenya Airways has been underwriting much of the search since the
professionals were brought in.
</P>
<P>
	   The plane's flight data recorder has been recovered, but the cockpit voice
recorder was still missing.

<HEADLINE> Serbia Seeks Money for River Damage  </HEADLINE>
   By MISHA SAVIC Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   BECEJ, Yugoslavia (AP) -- Serbia announced Sunday that it will demand
compensation at an international court from those responsible for a cyanide
spill that contaminated a major river, destroying most aquatic life.
</P>
<P>
	   The spill in the Tisa River, which originated in Romania, apparently sunk to
non-lethal levels Sunday after reaching the Danube. Before that, however, it had
devastated the river in Hungary and Serbia. Serbian Environment Minister
Branislav Blazic said it would take at least five years for life in the Tisa to
recover.
</P>
<P>
	   Blazic accused Romania of covering up the real dimensions of the poisoning,
which some environmentalists say could be the biggest ecological catastrophe in
Europe since the Chernobyl nuclear reactor catastrophe in 1986.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The Tisa has been killed. Not even bacteria have survived,'' Blazic said
as he toured the area along the river in northern Serbia. ``This is a total
catastrophe.''
</P>
<P>
	   ``We will demand an estimation of the damage and we will demand that the
culprits for this tragedy be punished,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
	   Romania played down the environmental damage. But people -- not just aquatic
life -- are at risk because of the spill, said Predrag Prolic, a professor of
chemistry and toxicology at Belgrade University.
</P>
<P>
	   He said those with wells close to the riverbed are in danger. Birds feeding
off fish could die, he said. The poisoned water also can filter into the soil
and then contaminate grass, grain, and livestock, Prolic said.
</P>
<P>
	   Serbian Agriculture Minister Jovan Babovic said Sunday that after the toxic
waste entered the Danube, the concentration of cyanide dropped below 0.2
milligrams per liter, a non-lethal level. But the Beta news agency cited
eyewitnesses who said the that the Danube was ``all white with the bellies of
dead fish'' between the spot where it joins the Tisa and Belgrade, about 50
miles to the southeast. The fish were possibly washed down from the Tisa.
</P>
<P>
	   In Bucharest, Romania, environmental official Anton Vlad suggested the
spill's effects had been overstated.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I have the impression that it is exaggerated,'' Vlad told national radio.
</P>
<P>
	   The cyanide spill originated in northwest Romania, near the border town of
Oradea, where a dam at the Baia Mare gold mine overflowed Jan. 30, causing
cyanide to pour into streams. At the mine, a cyanide solution is used to
separate gold ore from surrounding rock.
</P>
<P>
	   From there, the polluted water flowed west into the Tisa in neighboring
Hungary, killing large numbers of fish there, and then into Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
	   Prolic said the peak concentration of cyanide in the river was 20 times the
permissible level. Poisonous heavy metals such as lead can be left behind after
the cyanide dissipates and can also leech into the soil, he said.
</P>
<P>
	   In Serbia, dozens of volunteers and fisherman wearing protective rubber
gloves removed hundreds of dead fish from the Tisa to bury them. Heaps of fish
littered the river bank.
</P>
<P>
	   Experts and officials estimate that some 80 percent of the fish in the Tisa
have died since the contamination entered the country Friday.

	   ``Everything's dead, cyanide destroyed the entire food chain,'' said local
fisherman Slobodan Krkljes, 43. ``Fishing was my job. I don't know what I'm
going to do now.''
</P>
<P>
	   In Becej, a town on the Tisa about 55 miles north of Belgrade, police were
making sure no contaminated fish were brought to the town's market for sale.
Restaurants in the region have removed fish from their menus.
</P>
<P>
	   Adding to the problem, the fertile plains of Serbia's north are the
country's breadbasket. Water from the Tisa is traditionally used for irrigation.
</P>
<P>
	   Blazic claimed the initial concentration of the cyanide in Romania must have
been enormous if the effects remained so deadly in Yugoslavia, about 300-400
miles down the river.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Had we from Yugoslavia done something like this, we probably would have
been bombed,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
	   Blazic was referring to that NATO bombing of Yugoslavia last year over its
actions in Kosovo -- and a widespread belief here that the West is anti-Serb.
The cyanide spill adds to the ecological damage caused by NATO's bombing of
Serbian oil refineries and factories.

<HEADLINE> Trump Nixes Presidential Run  </HEADLINE>
   By RON FOURNIER AP Political Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- New York tycoon Donald Trump has decided against running
for president, ending a lengthy flirtation with the notion that he could spend
millions of dollars to capture the White House from outside the two major
parties, The Associated Press has learned.
</P>
<P>
	   Sources connected with New York's Independence Party movement, speaking on
condition of anonymity, said Trump has told associates he will announce Monday
that he is not mounting a presidential bid.
</P>
<P>
	   After months of speculation about a possible Reform Party campaign, Trump
decided recently that the third party is too fractured to support a credible
presidential candidate, the officials said.
</P>
<P>
	   He met over the weekend with advisers to consider a second option, running
as an Independence Party candidate, but determined that there is not enough time
to get on state ballots. Trump considered that option out of respect for
Minnesota Gov. Jesse Ventura, who had been the Reform Party's highest elected
official before leaving the ``dysfunctional'' party last week to reinvigorate
his state's Independence Party.
</P>
<P>
	   Ventura and Trump were allies during Reform Party squabbling that culminated
last Friday with the governor's departure and the ouster of a Ventura ally as
the party's chairman.
</P>
<P>
	   A fractious Reform Party meeting Saturday in Tennessee returned power to
allies of party founder Ross Perot, who has not ruled out running for president
a third time.
</P>
<P>
	   Though he had not formally entered the race, Trump made a handful of
campaign trips, hinted broadly for weeks that he would run and issued
comprehensive health care and national debt reduction proposals.
</P>
<P>
	   His decision leaves former Republican Pat Buchanan as the front-running
candidate for the Reform Party's nomination. Buchanan left the GOP after two
failed presidential bids, eying the nearly $13 million in federal money that
will be awarded the Reform Party nominee.
</P>
<P>
	   Many Perot allies encouraged Buchanan to bolt the GOP and join the Reform
Party, in part because they hoped the conservative firebrand could help defy
Ventura's wing of the party. With Ventura out of the way, Perot's allies are now
speculating that the wealthy Texas businessman could seek the nomination
himself.
</P>
<P>
	   Perot has not confirmed or denied the speculation.

<HEADLINE> IMF Chief Proposes G-7 Forum  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
    BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) -- The outgoing director of the International
Monetary Fund proposed Sunday replacing annual meetings of the Group of Seven
industrialized nations with a summit more representative of the world.
</P>
<P>
	   Michel Camdessus suggested that the 30 or so nations that have members on
the board of the IMF, or the World Bank, at any one time meet every two years to
discuss issues affecting world trade and financial systems.
</P>
<P>
	   As board members speak for the IMF's 182 member nations, the meeting would
represent a much broader section of the world than current G-7 meetings, which
usually also include Russia, Camdessus said in a speech to a U.N. trade
conference.
</P>
<P>
	   The U.N. secretary-general and relevant multinational organizations should
also attend, Camdessus said.
</P>
<P>
	   "It would offer a way of establishing a clear and stronger link between the
multinational institutions and a representative grouping of world leaders with
unquestionable legitimacy," he said.
</P>
<P>
	   G-8 leaders meeting in Japan in July could discuss the proposal, Camdessus
suggested.
</P>
<P>
	   The Okinawa summit will first group G-7 nations -- Britain, Canada, France,
Germany, Italy, Japan and the United States -- to discuss financial matters.
</P>
<P>
	   Russia's leaders will join the meeting later.
</P>
<P>
	   Camdessus' speech to the U.N. Conference on Trade and Development -- which
is holding its four-yearly meeting of 190 member nations in Bangkok -- marks his
last official engagement as head of the IMF before he steps down next week.

<HEADLINE> Poll: Bush Strong in Southeast  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   RICHMOND, Va. (AP) -- Gov. George W. Bush leads Sen. John McCain in the
Southeast, according to a new poll that offers a snapshot of where the
candidates stand in the region as the campaign spotlight moves south.
</P>
<P>
	   With support from Republicans and independents who lean toward the GOP, Bush
led the Arizona senator 39 percent to 25 percent and Alan Keyes had 3 percent
among adults interviewed by Media General Research. Media General is based in
Richmond and owns newspapers and broadcast television stations primarily in the
Southeast.
</P>
<P>
	   Among those who said they were Republican or leaned Republican, Bush led 58
percent to 23 percent for McCain.
</P>
<P>
	   While the regional poll shows Bush with a strong standing in the South, Bush
and McCain are deadlocked in polls in South Carolina, which holds a crucial
primary Saturday.
</P>
<P>
	   For Democrats, Vice President Al Gore had the support of 40 percent while
former senator Bill Bradley, had 29 percent. Among Democrats and those who
leaned Democratic, Gore led 68 percent to 22 percent.
</P>
<P>
	   Both Bush and McCain led the Democratic candidates in head-to-head matchups.
</P>
<P>
	   The telephone poll of 824 adults in Alabama, Florida, Georgia, Kentucky,
Mississippi, North Carolina, South Carolina, Tennessee and Virginia was taken
Feb. 2-9. The poll, which included four out of five respondents who were
registered voters, had an error margin of plus or minus 3.5 percentage points.
</P>
<P>
	   The nine states will award almost half the number of delegates needed to win
the GOP nomination.
</P>
<P>
	   The poll was taken as many people in the country are just starting to pay
attention to the presidential campaign, and the results of early state primaries
like South Carolina's often have a significant impact on candidates in future
state primaries.
</P>
<P>
	   For example, McCain closed the gap on Bush in South Carolina almost
immediately after his big win in New Hampshire.
</P>
<P>
	   Virginia holds a GOP primary Feb. 29 while Democrats hold caucuses in
mid-April. Georgia's primary is March 7, and South Carolina Democrats have
scheduled caucuses for March 9. Florida and Tennessee hold primaries March 14.
</P>
<P>
	   When people were asked the top issues, they mentioned health care the most
often, followed by education, Social Security, taxes, crime, the federal deficit
and the economy. Sentiment was fairly well spread among the issues, however.

<HEADLINE> French Probing Mad Cow Control  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   PARIS (AP) -- French police are investigating how a cow showing clear signs
of mad cow disease was not spotted before it arrived at a slaughterhouse for
possible human consumption.
</P>
<P>
	   The milk cow arrived last week at the Gallais slaughterhouse. It was killed
along with its herd last Thursday as a precautionary measure after authorities
confirmed it had ``distinct signs'' of mad cow disease, or bovine spongiform
encephalopathy.
</P>
<P>
	   Louis Rossignol, the head of the slaughterhouse, said Sunday that the cow
appeared to be in good health when purchased along with 27 others at a cattle
market last week in Finistere, northwestern France.
</P>
<P>
	   ``While being transported, the person in charge of receiving the animals
noted that a cow wasn't in a normal condition,'' Rossignol told France-2
television. ``But it had appeared well when leaving the market.''
</P>
<P>
	   The cow did not have a mandatory health certificate. Rossignol said he
didn't know ``what could have happened.''
</P>
<P>
	   Tests were being done on the cow's carcass to determine if it had the
disease. Results were expected later in the week.
</P>
<P>
	   If confirmed, it would be the sixth case of mad cow in France this year and
the 87th since the onset of the disease.
</P>
<P>
	   Scientists have established a link between mad cow disease and a fatal human
brain disease. Authorities say new cases of mad cow will break out in France
until 2001. It has an average five-year incubation period, and precautions were
not taken until 1996.

<HEADLINE> Lawyer: Black Farmers Denied Funds  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, Ga. (AP) -- A lead attorney in a class-action lawsuit filed by black
farmers against the U.S. Department of Agriculture said too many farmers --
about 40 percent -- have been denied compensation in the federal settlement.
</P>
<P>
	   The settlement, approved by a federal judge in April, ended a lawsuit that
accused the USDA of regularly denying subsidies and other assistance to black
farmers because of their race.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The fight is not over,'' lawyer J.L. Chestnut said Saturday to 200 farmers
at a conference here. ``The government is too damn white, and the folks in
charge of this lawsuit are too white for me.''
</P>
<P>
	   Under the settlement, farmers who can show evidence of discrimination are
entitled to $50,000 each and to have outstanding loans forgiven. An additional
$12,500 is being sent to the Internal Revenue Service in the name of each farmer
to cover the federal income taxes he or she would owe on the settlement.
</P>
<P>
	   About 18,000 farmers filed claims under the settlement, and checks began
going out in November. But Chestnut said more than 40 percent of the claims have
been rejected. They can appeal the denials to a court monitor.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We intend to appeal them,'' Chestnut said. ``I've got farmers who might
not make it to next year.''
</P>
<P>
	   Randi Roth, a newly appointed independent monitor, told farmers that her
office has three objectives: to review decisions, to solve problems and to issue
reports.
</P>
<P>
	   ``If you think your decision is wrong in any way, you can request a monitor
reviewing,'' she said. ``But the office cannot overturn a decision. ... We can
only say whoever made the decision should look at it again.''
</P>
<P>
	   The department's civil rights director has said the farmers' claims will be
investigated to determine which Agriculture Department employees were involved
in discrimination.

<HEADLINE> Indians, Police Clash in Colombia  </HEADLINE>
   By VIVIAN SEQUERA Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   LAS CANOAS, Colombia (AP) -- Leaders of a Colombian indigenous tribe said
they will not give in to a U.S. company's plans to drill for oil in their
traditional lands, even after riot police clashed with Indian protesters
blocking a road to the area.
</P>
<P>
	   ``This is our land. We will not leave it,'' Roberto Perez, head of the U'wa
nation's council of leaders, said on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
	   There were reports from tribal leaders that as many as five children fell
into a fast-flowing river and may have drowned in the confusion after a clash.
But the reports could not be confirmed. No bodies have been found, and police
have denied reports of deaths in Friday's violence.
</P>
<P>
	   Reporters visiting the remote area in northeastern Colombia during the
weekend heard conflicting versions of what happened when police broke up the
protest, which highlights the intensity of a long-running dispute over the U'wa
tribe's claim to land it considers sacred.
</P>
<P>
	   For weeks, members of the tribe have occupied land just outside their
reservation on which the U.S. oil company Occidental Petroleum wants to begin
exploratory drilling.
</P>
<P>
	   Although the drilling site lies outside tribal lands, the U'wa say they
believe oil exploration would bring violence and destroy their culture.
</P>
<P>
	   About 150 riot police on Friday flew by helicopter to Las Canoas, 210 miles
northeast of Bogota, to disperse the hundreds of Indians who had blocked the
dusty road leading to the Occidental drilling site.
</P>
<P>
	   The police fired tear gas at the protesters, who were armed with wooden
clubs and bows and arrows. Six Indians suffered cuts and bruises, while two
police agents suffered minor wounds from the tribe's metal-tipped arrows.
</P>
<P>
	   The highway was reopened in the mountainous region near the Venezuelan
border, and on Saturday construction trucks rolled past the scene of the
previous day's violence, heading for the site where Los Angeles-based Occidental
hopes to find up to 2 billion barrels of crude. The company could not
immediately be reached for comment.
</P>
<P>
	   Protesters lined the edge of the road facing a picket of riot police.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I'm not moving. This is my land, and nobody is taking it from me,'' said
Pastor Bocota, who said his four-month-old daughter died after riot police broke
up the protest.
</P>
<P>
	   Communication with the U'wa is sometimes difficult because many of them
don't speak Spanish. But one Indian girl, 9-year-old Kesiowia Bocota, told
reporters through an interpreter that she had lost Pastor Bocota's baby while
trying to cross the river. The girl, who is not related to the man or the baby,
said the infant slipped from her arms.
</P>
<P>
	   Activists from the U.S.-based groups Amazon Watch and Rainforest Action
Network previously told reporters that three children had died during the clash.
</P>
<P>
	   Regional police commander Col. Raul Cepeda, said that the incident would be
investigated, but U'wa leaders were unimpressed.
</P>
<P>
	   ``They can say what they like, but it's their fault. They will have to pay
for these lives,'' said Ebaristo Cobaria, the tribe's legal adviser.
</P>
<P>
	   The clash pits the 8,000-member tribe against the energy needs of an
oil-rich country of 40 million people whose leaders say Colombia will have to
import oil within the next decade if it can't exploit its own reserves.
</P>
<P>
	   The tribe's territory -- one of the largest in the country -- was nearly
quadrupled in August by President Andres Pastrana's government to 850 square
miles stretching across four states.

<TEXT>
<P>
   ROME (AP) -- African-American Pentecostal leaders from the United States
clapped their hands and stamped their feet during a joyful service Sunday in a
Roman Catholic church for Americans living in the Italian capital.
</P>
<P>
	   The Pentecostals are in Rome on a week's pilgrimage stressing their roots
with the Catholic church. Earlier in the week, the delegation attended Pope John
Paul II's general audience at the Vatican.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Pentecostals are celebrating in Rome. We're going to make history,''
Bishop Delano Ellis, president of the Joint College of African-American Bishops,
said Sunday in his cheerful greeting to the congregation at Santa Susanna.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I am delighted that you can come to this house where pilgrims have been
praying for over 1,700 years, to add your prayer to this home,'' said the Rev.
Paul Robichaud, the church's rector. ``You are always welcome to this house.''
</P>
<P>
	   John Paul has made ecumenism -- or efforts for better understanding and
unity among Christian denominations -- one of the major themes of the Vatican's
2000 Holy Year. The Pentecostal leaders have praised the pope's efforts.
</P>
<P>
	   Pentecostalism stresses tangible manifestations of the Holy Spirit, such as
speaking in unknown tongues and healing. Concentrated in inner cities, the
movement experienced rapid growth in the United States in the 1990s, with Asian
and Caribbean immigrants among the newest members.

<HEADLINE> Rushdie Sentence Said in Effect  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON (AP) -- Iranian hard-liners said Sunday that the 1989 death sentence
ordered against British novelist Salman Rushdie remained in effect, despite the
Iranian government's statements more than a year ago that appeared to lift it,
an Iranian radio report said.
</P>
<P>
	   The decree by the late Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini remains in force, ``and
nothing will change that,'' the Islamic Revolution Guards Corps said, according
to the radio report monitored by the British Broadcasting Corp. on the eve of
the anniversary of the ``fatwa,'' or religious edict.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Based on divine principles, ... the ruling against the apostate Salman
Rushdie is still valid and nothing can change this,'' the statement reportedly
said.
</P>
<P>
	   After Khomeini announced the sentence on Feb. 14, claiming Rushdie had
blasphemed Islam in ``The Satanic Verses,'' the 52-year-old Rushdie spent nearly
a decade in hiding under police protection.
</P>
<P>
	   He emerged from his shadowy existence in September 1998 when Iranian Foreign
Minister Kamal Kharrazi announced the country was distancing itself from a $2.5
million reward promised for Rushdie's death.
</P>
<P>
	   Iran had been trying to change its foreign policy since Mohammad Khatami, a
moderate cleric, took over as president in August 1997. He underscored the need
to replace confrontation with dialogue in Iran's relations with the West.
</P>
<P>
	   The Rushdie affair was the main hurdle in Iran's efforts to improve ties
with the European Union.
</P>
<P>
	   Britain and Iran agreed to upgrade their diplomatic relations in May 1999.
</P>
<P>
	   Muslims have said before that the fatwa cannot be lifted formally, but the
Iranian government's decision did ease the threat to Rushdie.
</P>
<P>
	   Powerful hard-liners inside the Islamic regime have always supported the
death sentence and are likely to continue to do so.

<HEADLINE> Study: Poor Countries Marginalized  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) -- The world's 48 poorest countries are failing to
benefit from free trade and globalization and face worsening poverty, inequality
and marginalization, a U.N. report said Sunday.
</P>
<P>
	   Economic production has declined for three straight years in the
least-developed countries while their share of global trade has plunged, said
the report issued by the U.N. Conference on Trade and Development.
</P>
<P>
	   ``There is no greater challenge facing the international community today
than integrating the least developed countries into the world economy,'' said
UNCTAD Deputy Secretary-General Carlos Fortin. ``They are being increasingly
marginalized.''
</P>
<P>
	   Since 1971, the number of countries categorized by the United Nations as
extremely poor has risen from 25 to 48. During that period, only one country,
Botswana, has graduated from the list.
</P>
<P>
	   Thirty-three of the poorest nations are in Africa, nine in Asia, five in the
Pacific and one in Latin America.
</P>
<P>
	   The report, released at an UNCTAD meeting in Bangkok, said rich countries
should remove all tariffs and quotas on products from the poorest countries to
allow them to sell more.
</P>
<P>
	   Developing countries have complained that trade agreements negotiated by the
World Trade Organization have cut tariffs on many products exported by rich
nations, while falling to address agriculture, textiles and garments -- key
products for poorer countries.
</P>
<P>
	   The report also urged donor countries to provide more aid to enable poor
countries to produce more so they can benefit from free trade.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The main problem of the least developed countries today is they don't
produce enough,'' Fortin said.
</P>
<P>
	   In real terms, aid provided to the least-developed countries has fallen by
23 percent in the past decade, the report said.
</P>
<P>
	   Unlike wealthier developing countries, the poorest nations are generally
unable to turn to private investment for capital, and attract less than 1
percent of all foreign direct investment, the report said.

<HEADLINE> Peruvians Promised Fair Elections  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   LIMA, Peru (AP) -- President Alberto Fujimori has promised to comply with
recommendations of a Carter Center delegation that said Peru does not meet
international standards for fair elections.
</P>
<P>
	   Fujimori said he would not inaugurate new public works projects prior to the
April 9 vote and that district attorneys would be assigned to monitor election
campaigns.
</P>
<P>
	   The Carter Center, founded by former President Jimmy Carter, said Friday
that Fujimori's government was abusing public funds to garner votes, had blocked
opposition candidates' access to the media, and had used other irregular
practices to gain an unfair advantage in the April 9 vote.
</P>
<P>
	   U.S. State Department spokesman James P. Rubin welcomed the group's
recommendation and said prompt action to meet its criticisms would help broaden
and deepen democracy in Peru.
</P>
<P>
	   The 61-year-old president, who has denied government involvement in
harassment of his rivals, said a hot line would be installed for citizens to
register complaints about questionable election practices.
</P>
<P>
	   Fujimori, who made his pledges Saturday during a trip to the nation's
central highlands, said the only Carter Center recommendation that could not be
followed was its request for government financing of opposition campaign ads on
privately owned television and radio.
</P>
<P>
	   The request fell outside constitutional provisions, he said.

<HEADLINE> Group To Give $35M for Rain Forest  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   GUATEMALA CITY (AP) -- On the strength of wealthy donors like Harrison Ford,
a U.S. conservationist group said Sunday it will donate $35 million for a
research center in an endangered northern Guatemalan rain forest and wetlands
region.
</P>
<P>
	   The nonprofit Washington, D.C.-based Conservation International announced
the donation at the jungle-ringed Mayan ruin site of Tikal.
</P>
<P>
	   The new center will be built in the Mayan Biosphere, Central America's
largest tropical forest and wetland area. The region covers an area seven times
as large as the U.S. Yosemite National Park. Though it is protected by
Guatemalan law, the environmental group said there are signs that illegal
poaching, careless tourists and slash-and-burn agriculture are damaging it.
</P>
<P>
	   Ford had toured some of the rain forest Saturday to see damage done by
poachers, cattle ranchers and developers. Intel cofounder Gordon Moore and movie
stars Kevin Kline and Michelle Pfeiffer also have contributed to the project.

<HEADLINE> Hometown Mourns Schulz' Death  </HEADLINE>
   By MARY ANN LICKTEIG Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   SANTA ROSA, Calif. (AP) -- Nearly every morning, ``Peanuts'' creator Charles
Schulz appeared in the local ice skating rink, sipping on coffee and reading the
newspaper before heading off to his studio to ink the latest adventures of
Charlie Brown and his dog Snoopy.
</P>
<P>
	   On Sunday, the Redwood Empire Ice Arena was closed for the day, its flag at
half-staff. Friends and fans left a growing pile of flower bouquets outside the
window of the Warm Puppy snack shop, where coffee costs just 25 cents in a cup
decorated with Snoopy.
</P>
<P>
	   At the adjacent Snoopy's Gallery &AMP; Gift Shop, a card tied to the gate read:
``You were a good man, Charlie Brown.''
</P>
<P>
	   The cartoonist, who had battled colon cancer in recent months, died Saturday
night at his home in Santa Rosa, about 60 miles north of San Francisco.
</P>
<P>
	   His eldest son, Monte Schulz, stopped by the rink on Sunday. He said he had
tried to prepare for this day for three or four years but could not comprehend
that his father was gone.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I think it'll take a long time. I think I'll have to be in all the places,
like the ice arena and his studio, and have him not be there for me to realize
he's died,'' Monte Schulz said.
</P>
<P>
	   Trevor Jones, 8, who has been skating at the rink since he was in preschool,
delivered a bouquet decorated with his own drawing of Schulz ice skating. In a
child's scrawl, it read ``I lik you.''
</P>
<P>
	   Trevor said he could relate to Charlie Brown and the constant but
unsuccessful attempts to kick a football -- which Lucy would always yank away at
the last minute. ``Sometimes I miss,'' Trevor said.
</P>
<P>
	   At the ice rink, a potted plant was adorned with a Schulz drawing of
Peppermint Patty, with her head thrown back and the exclamation ``Aaughh!!'' A
hockey stick also was left, reflecting Schulz' love of the sport.
</P>
<P>
	   Mary Welch, manager of the snack shop, said Schulz had skated at the rink on
Friday.
</P>
<P>
	   Most mornings, the cartoonist could be found sitting at the same snack shop
table near the fireplace, looking out over the ice rink. Some days he would lace
up his skates and joined in a game of hockey.
</P>
<P>
	   His studio was within walking distance of the rink.
</P>
<P>
	   Schulz discovered his cancer after abdominal surgery in November and later
suffered a series of small strokes. He announced his retirement in December
after 50 years of drawing Charlie Brown, Snoopy, Linus and Lucy. He had
specified that ``Peanuts'' would not be continued.
</P>
<P>
	   Schulz' last daily strip ran in January. His final farewell comic was
scheduled weeks ago to run in Sunday newspapers.

<HEADLINE> Trump Nixes Presidential Run  </HEADLINE>
   By RON FOURNIER AP Political Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- New York tycoon Donald Trump has decided against running
for president, ending a lengthy flirtation with the notion that he could tap his
political fortune to capture the White House as a third-party candidate, The
Associated Press has learned.
</P>
<P>
	   Sources connected with New York's Independence Party movement, speaking on
condition of anonymity, said Trump has told associates he will announce Monday
that he is not mounting a presidential bid.
</P>
<P>
	   After months of speculation about a possible Reform Party campaign, Trump
decided recently that the party is too fractured to support a credible
presidential candidate, the officials said. The Reform Party operates in New
York under the Independence Party banner.
</P>
<P>
	   He met over the weekend with advisers to consider a second option, running
as an Independence Party candidate, but determined there is not enough time to
get on state ballots. Trump considered that option out of respect for Minnesota
Gov. Jesse Ventura, who had been the Reform Party's highest elected official
before leaving the ``dysfunctional'' party last week to reinvigorate his state's
Independence Party.
</P>
<P>
	   Ventura and Trump were allies during Reform Party squabbling that culminated
last Friday with the governor's departure and the ouster of a Ventura ally as
party chairman.
</P>
<P>
	   A fractious Reform Party meeting Saturday in Tennessee returned power to
allies of party founder Ross Perot, who has not ruled out running for president
a third time.
</P>
<P>
	   Though he had not formally entered the race, Trump made a handful of
campaign trips, hinted broadly for weeks that he would run and issued
comprehensive health care and national debt reduction proposals. He held a
single-digit ranking in most public polls, and was not given much of a chance of
winning the presidency.
</P>
<P>
	   Trump estimates his personal net worth at $5 billion. Though independent
analysis lead to lower estimates, there is no doubt he was wealthy enough to
make inroads toward the Reform Party nomination.
</P>
<P>
	   His decision leaves former Republican Pat Buchanan as the front-running
candidate for the Reform Party's nomination. Buchanan left the GOP after two
failed presidential bids, eying the nearly $13 million in federal money that
will be awarded Reform's nominee.
</P>
<P>
	   Many Perot allies encouraged Buchanan to bolt the GOP and join the Reform
Party, in part because they hoped the conservative firebrand could help defy
Ventura's wing of the party. With Ventura out of the way, Perot's allies are now
speculating that the wealthy Texas businessman could seek the nomination
himself.
</P>
<P>
	   Perot has not confirmed or denied the speculation.
</P>
<P>
	   Steve Forbes, another multimillionaire dabbling in politics, last week
became the seventh GOP candidate to pull out of the race. Vice President Al Gore
and former New Jersey senator Bill Bradley are the sole Democratic combatants.

<HEADLINE> Armed Drug Suspect Visits Newspaper  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   BASSETERRE, St. Kitts (AP) -- Carrying a gun and a grudge, a man wanted by
U.S. drug agents visited a newspaper on the island of St. Kitts to complain
about news coverage and give a rambling interview in which he claimed to be a
former CIA operative.
</P>
<P>
	   Charles ``Little Nut'' Miller walked into The Observer of St. Kitts with
four men unannounced last Monday, the weekly newspaper reported this weekend.
</P>
<P>
	   With a gun tucked into his waistband, Miller complained about coverage of
U.S. efforts to have him extradited on drug trafficking charges. He said he was
angry about The Observer's publication of his picture, then spit on a copy of
the newspaper and threw it into the garbage.
</P>
<P>
	   He then talked to reporters for an hour on the condition that details of the
interview not be published, the newspaper said.
</P>
<P>
	   During the conversation, he claimed to have worked with the U.S. Central
Intelligence Agency fighting leftists in Jamaica in the 1970s.
</P>
<P>
	   He denied U.S. charges that he had given donations to political parties to
prevent his extradition to the United States, but confirmed he had given money
to unnamed individuals.
</P>
<P>
	   Reporters taped the interview, but Miller demanded the tape and took it with
him. He also took pictures of newspaper employees, the Observer said.
</P>
<P>
	   Newspaper staffers called the visit an attempt to intimidate them. The
Observer's publisher has maintained that the newspaper's offices in nearby Nevis
were firebombed in 1997 in retaliation for earlier stories about Miller.
</P>
<P>
	   Miller, whose former name is Cecil Connor, is wanted in the United States on
a 1995 indictment charging him with smuggling more than 1,000 tons of cocaine.
</P>
<P>
	   In 1998, U.S. officials accused him of threatening to kill U.S. students at
St. Kitts' Ross University if he were extradited. A magistrate has twice blocked
his extradition, but the country's High Court recently ordered the case
reconsidered.
</P>
<P>
	   Local police have charged Miller with shooting at farmer Denzil Alexander on
Jan. 21 during an argument. Alexander was not hit.

<HEADLINE> India Denies Plans For Nuke Treaty  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW DELHI, India (AP) -- Next month's visit by President Clinton is not
linked to nuclear nonproliferation issues and there will be no mediation of any
kind over the Kashmir dispute, India's foreign minister Jaswant Singh said
Sunday.
</P>
<P>
	   The United States has pushed for India and Pakistan to sign the
Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty and has imposed sanctions on both countries
because they conducted nuclear tests in 1998, rejecting international nuclear
nonproliferation protocols.
</P>
<P>
	   India will not rush to sign the treaty before or during Clinton's five-day
visit beginning March 20, Singh told reporters. The Indian government has said
it has no need for further tests, but will make a decision on signing the treaty
only after a national consensus is achieved.
</P>
<P>
	   Singh also responded to comments made recently by Clinton, U.S. Secretary of
State Madeleine Albright and Defense Secretary William Cohen that Washington was
prepared to offer assistance or facilitate a resolution of the tension over
Kashmir.
</P>
<P>
	   Both Pakistan and India claim the Himalayan region in its entirety and have
fought two wars over it. Both countries hold part of Kashmir.
</P>
<P>
	   ``There is no possibility of mediation, inter-mediation or facilitation when
it comes to the Indian state of Jammu and Kashmir,'' Singh said after addressing
a conference of People of Indian Origin.

	   Rain spread across much of the eastern third of the nation Sunday, turning
to snow over the Great Lakes.
</P>
<P>
	   Steady showers and occasional thunderstorms moved along the length of the
Ohio Valley and into the central Appalachians.
</P>
<P>
	   Showers and a few thunderstorms also extended southwestward across the
Tennessee and lower Mississippi valleys, reaching the eastern edge of Texas and
coastal areas of Louisiana, Mississippi and Alabama.
</P>
<P>
	   Some of the thunderstorms produced heavy rain, and marble-sized hail was
reported in parts of western Tennessee.
</P>
<P>
	   Farther north, colder air turned the moisture into light to moderate snow
showers that extended from Iowa through Wisconsin and across the Great Lakes
into parts of northern New York.
</P>
<P>
	   The National Weather Service issued winter storm warnings for parts of New
York, northern Pennsylvania and northern New England.
</P>
<P>
	   A storm moving onto the West Coast spread showers across central and
northern California and into western Oregon.
</P>
<P>
	   Rain fell heavily in parts of central California, with up to an inch in
places.
</P>
<P>
	   The rain turned to snow in California's Sierra Nevada, where more than a
foot of snow was possible, and the southern Cascades in Oregon. Snow showers

<HEADLINE> Poll: McCain Leading in Michigan  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Republican presidential candidate John McCain has pulled
slightly ahead of front-runner George W. Bush in Michigan, according to a new
poll released Sunday.
</P>
<P>
	   The Detroit News poll found McCain carrying 43 percent of the voters likely
to participate in the Feb. 22 GOP presidential primary. Bush had 34 percent,
while 5 percent planned to vote for another candidate and 18 percent were
undecided.
</P>
<P>
	   The vote is a turnaround from a poll taken last month where Bush had 51
percent to McCain's 17 percent. At that time 15 percent of voters planned to
choose another candidate and 17 percent were undecided.
</P>
<P>
	   In recent weeks, Sen. Orrin Hatch of Utah, conservative activist Gary Bauer
and publisher Steve Forbes have dropped from the Republican race.
</P>
<P>
	   According to the Detroit News poll, McCain led Bush 57 percent to 21 percent
among independents likely to vote in the primary, while Bush led 44-33 among
core Republicans.
</P>
<P>
	   The poll, conducted Tuesday through Friday by Mitchell Research and
Communications, involved 607 voters likely to participate in the primary, which
is open to Democrats, independents and Republicans. It has an error margin of
plus or minus 4 percentage points.
</P>
<P>
	   The survey also suggests that McCain's ``I'll always tell you the truth''
message is striking a chord in Michigan. Among the 46 percent who listed honesty
as the most important character trait for president, McCain led by a 2-to-1
margin.
</P>
<P>
	   Exit polling four years ago showed one-third of those who voted in the
Michigan primary were independents or Democrats. About one-third of the
respondents to the Detroit News poll were non-Republicans who say they plan to
vote in the primary.

<HEADLINE> 'Peanuts' Creator Schulz Dies at 77  </HEADLINE>
   By MARY ANN LICKTEIG Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   SANTA ROSA, Calif. (AP) -- ``Peanuts'' creator Charles Schulz died at home
following a battle with cancer, just as the last original cartoon of his
half-century career was being published in newspapers worldwide.
</P>
<P>
	   The 77-year-old Schulz was diagnosed with colon cancer in November, and his
spirits recently sagged as he battled the disease and pondered retirement, said
Monte Schulz, his eldest son.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I think maybe he decided that his true passion was in the strip, and when
that was gone, it was over,'' Monte Schulz said Sunday. ``He had done what he
had wanted to do, and that was it for him ...''
</P>
<P>
	   The son said that while the cause of death Saturday wasn't known, ``it
appears he died in his sleep, almost between breaths.'' His wife, Jeannie, was
with him when he died.
</P>
<P>
	   On news of his passing, fans and colleagues across the country hailed Schulz
as an irreplaceable artist whose work over the years had become infused in
American popular culture.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I think 'Peanuts' has been for most of its existence the best comic strip
in history, and nothing's ever approached it,'' said Mell Lazarus, who draws the
``Momma'' and ``Miss Peach'' strips, and knew Schulz for 42 years. ``He's going
to be missed and will clearly never be replaced.''
</P>
<P>
	   The famous strip -- with its gentle humor spiked with a child's-eye view of
human foibles -- had one particularly endearing trait: constancy.
</P>
<P>
	   Year after year, the long-suffering Charlie Brown faced misfortune with a
mild, ``Good grief!'' Tart-tongued Lucy handed out advice at a nickel a pop. And
Snoopy, Charlie Brown's wise-but-weird beagle, still took the occasional flight
of fancy back to the skies of World War I and his rivalry with the Red Baron.
</P>
<P>
	   The strip was an intensely personal effort for Schulz. He had had a clause
in his contract dictating the strip had to end with his death -- no one could
imitate it.
</P>
<P>
	   While battling cancer, he opted to retire it, saying he wanted to focus on
his health and family without the worry of a daily deadline.
</P>
<P>
	   His last daily comic ran in early January, and the final farewell strip
appeared in newspapers on Sunday. Old versions of the strip will continue to be
published.
</P>
<P>
	   The last strip showed Snoopy at his typewriter and other Peanuts regulars
along with a ``Dear Friends'' letter thanking his readers for their support.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I have been grateful over the years for the loyalty of our editors and the
wonderful support and love expressed to me by fans of the comic strip,'' Schulz
wrote. ``Charlie Brown, Snoopy, Linus, Lucy ... how can I ever forget them ...''
</P>
<P>
	   It ended with his signature.
</P>
<P>
	   Fans of all ages mourned his passing.
</P>
<P>
	   In Santa Rosa, 8-year-old Trevor Jones offered a bouquet of flowers
decorated with a drawing of the city's ice skating rink, which Schulz built. The
drawing, delivered to the rink, read in a child's scrawl, ``I lik you.''
</P>
<P>
	   Ikue Kamasugi, 25, arrived from Tokyo Saturday night for the sole purpose of
reading the final ``Peanuts'' strip at the ice arena. Instead, she was mourning
-- and had not yet read the strip.
</P>
<P>
	   At the International Museum of Cartoon Art in Boca Raton, Fla., Schulz fans
who came to see an exhibit featuring his comics became mourners.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I said when they called me, 'It's not true,''' said a tearful Jeanne
Greever, the museum's director of operations.
</P>
<P>
	   Schulz was born in St. Paul, Minn., on Nov. 26, 1922, and studied art after
he saw a ``Do you like to draw?'' ad.
</P>
<P>
	   He was drafted into the Army in 1943 and sent to the European theater,
although he saw little combat.
</P>
<P>
	   After the war, he did lettering for a church comic book, taught art and sold
cartoons to the Saturday Evening Post. His first feature, ``Li'l Folks,'' was
developed for the St. Paul Pioneer Press in 1947. In 1950, it was sold to a
syndicate and the named changed to Peanuts, even though, he recalled later, he
didn't much like the name.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Peanuts'' made its official debut on Oct. 2, 1950. The travails of the
``little round-headed kid'' and his pals eventually ran in more than 2,600
newspapers, reaching millions of readers in 75 countries.
</P>
<P>
	   Although he remained largely a private person, the strip brought Schulz
international fame. He won the Reuben Award, comic art's highest honor, in 1955
and 1964. In 1978, he was named International Cartoonist of the Year, an award
voted by 700 comic artists around the world.
</P>
<P>
	   The 1965 CBS-TV special ``A Charlie Brown Christmas'' won an Emmy and rerun
immortality, and many other specials followed.
</P>
<P>
	   There was a hit musical, ``You're a Good Man, Charlie Brown,'' with Gary
Burghoff, later Radar O'Reilly on ``M-A-S-H,'' playing Charlie. The book ``The
Gospel According to Peanuts'' explored the philosophical and religious
implications of the strip.
</P>
<P>
	   The characters also appeared on sheets, stationery and countless other
products. Schulz several times was listed as one of Forbes magazine's best-paid
entertainers, most recently in 1996, when his 1995-96 income was estiamted at
$33 million, ranking him No. 30 on the magazine's list.
</P>
<P>
	   Despite the success, Schulz struggled with depression and anxiety, according
to his biographer, Rheta Grimsley Johnson. But the struggle only improved his
work, she found, as he poured those feelings of rejection and uncertainty into
the strip and turned Charlie Brown into Everyman.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Rejection is his specialty, losing his area of expertise. He has spent a
lifetime perfecting failure,'' Johnson wrote in her 1989 book, ``Good Grief: The
Story of Charles M. Schulz.''
</P>
<P>
	   Schulz himself left little doubt about the strip's role in his life.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Why do musicians compose symphonies and poets write poems?'' he once said.
``They do it because life wouldn't have any meaning for them if they didn't.
That's why I draw cartoons. It's my life.''
</P>
<P>
	   A private funeral is scheduled for this week.

``Peanuts'' appeared in newspapers weighed heavily Sunday on fans of Charlie
Brown, Snoopy and Lucy.
</P>
<P>
	   ``It's real sad. He did a really neat strip and it really touched a lot of
people's lives. It's really too bad he couldn't enjoy his retirement,'' said
Charles Weier, who lives in the house in St. Paul, Minn., where Schulz spent his
teen-age years.
</P>
<P>
	   Schulz was diagnosed with colon cancer and suffered a series of small
strokes during emergency surgery in November 1999, and announced his retirement
a few weeks afterward.
</P>
<P>
	   In addition to the last appearance of a new ``Peanuts'' strip, Sunday was
officially Charles ``Sparky'' Schulz Day in St. Paul.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We will all miss his daily dose of wisdom,'' St. Paul Mayor Norm Coleman
said Saturday when he proclaimed the observance, before Schulz's death. ``In
each of his characters, we see a little bit of ourselves.''
</P>
<P>
	   About 250 people ignored snow and temperatures in the teens Saturday as
Coleman unveiled an ice sculpture of the Peanuts characters.
</P>
<P>
	   ``It's just ironic that in your last comic strip you're gonna call it all
and ... all of a sudden you die,'' said Rick Micheltree, a cook at Mickey's
Diner in St. Paul.
</P>
<P>
	   At the International Museum of Cartoon Art in Boca Raton, Fla., a red rose
was placed beneath a portrait of Schulz with Snoopy atop a snow-covered doghouse
in the background. Larry Brokahn, 39, of Boca Raton left yellow and purple
daisies at the foot of a Charlie Brown statue.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I've read Peanuts since I was 12,'' Brokahn said.
</P>
<P>
	   Schulz's first feature, ``Li'l Folks,'' was developed for the Saint Paul
Pioneer Press in 1947. In 1950, it was sold to a syndicate and the name changed
to ``Peanuts.''
</P>
<P>
	   ``Nobody thought he was too good, to tell you the truth, because he had a
whole different style,'' Mort Walker, creator of ``Beetle Bailey,'' said Sunday
from Boca Raton, Fla., in an interview with WCCO-TV in Minneapolis. ``He didn't
do the traditional solid cartoon, which was kind of slapstick humor. But he
brought in pathos, failure, rejection, all that stuff and somehow made it
funny.''
</P>
<P>
	   ``It's sad to think that he didn't get the chance to see his last strip
running in the paper,'' Tom Batiuk, cartoonist of ``Funky Winkerbean'' and
``Crankshaft,'' said Sunday from his home in Medina, Ohio. ``It would have been
nice to see him bask in the glory of it a little bit more.''
</P>
<P>
	   ``I am part of that generation of cartoonists that were just devoted to his
work,'' Batiuk added. ``Strips prior to his time reflected the world around us,
he opened a door to the world inside us and allowed us to share feelings that
are common to everyone.''
</P>
<P>
	   Mell Lazarus, who draws the ``Momma'' and ``Miss Peach'' strips, knew Schulz
for 42 years.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I think 'Peanuts' has been for most of its existence the best comic strip
in history, and nothing's ever approached it,'' Lazarus said. ``He's going to be
missed and will clearly never be replaced.''
</P>
<P>
	   ``For 50 years, his keen eye, his good and generous heart, and his active
brush and pen have given life to the most memorable cast of characters ever to
enliven our daily papers,'' President Clinton said in a statement Sunday. ``The
hopeful and hapless Charlie Brown, the joyful Snoopy, the soulful Linus -- even
the 'crabby' Lucy -- give voice, day after day, to what makes us human.''
</P>
<P>
	   Charlie Brown was the favorite ``Peanuts'' character for Don Tansey, 50, of
Short Hills, N.J., because it was so easy for people to relate to him.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The guy's always trying to do the best for others, and he gets left
behind. It's a theme that happens so much in this country. The nice people get
left behind,'' Tansey said.

<HEADLINE> Israel OKs Consulate Marriages  </HEADLINE>
   By LAURIE COPANS Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) -- Israeli Interior Minister Natan Sharansky instituted a
reform Sunday that will allow tens of thousands of Israelis not considered
Jewish by rabbinical courts to get married here.
</P>
<P>
	   Marriages in Israel are under the sole jurisdiction of Jewish, Muslim,
Christian and other religious authorities. But under the new stipulation, dual
citizens not recognized as Jewish will be able to have civil weddings in the
consulate of the country of which they are citizens.
</P>
<P>
	   The new measure is a blow to Orthodox Jews fighting to maintain their
monopoly over marriage, divorce and burial in Israel.
</P>
<P>
	   The change could help hundreds of thousands of Russians who immigrated to
Israel in recent years and have been unable to marry here. Roman Polansky, a
Sharansky aide, said many of those immigrants would be able to take their vows
at the Russian consulate, assuming they retained their Russian citizenship.
</P>
<P>
	   Sharansky, who heads a Russian immigrants party, took over the Interior
Ministry last July promising to institute sweeping reforms that would improve
the legal status of Russian immigrants. His decision is expected to be accepted
by the Foreign Ministry, which would then give its approval to foreign
consulates in Israel, Polansky said.
</P>
<P>
	   Orthodox law says that only a person who has a Jewish mother or who converts
according to strict standards is Jewish. The ruling is particularly problematic
for immigrants from Russia, where religion is determined according to the
father.
</P>
<P>
	   Nissim Zeev, a lawmaker in the ultra-Orthodox Shas party, warned that
Sharansky's decision would threaten the character of the Jewish state by
fostering assimilation.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The rabbinical courts have to know where the non-Jews are,'' Zeev told
Israel TV, referring to Israelis not deemed Jewish by the Orthodox rabbinate.
``Otherwise, things will get out of control.''
</P>
<P>
	   But Yossi Paritsky of the secular rights Shinui party said Sharansky's
decision was a step toward full tolerance of civil marriages.
</P>
<P>
	   ``This is a sign that the state of Israel has now become a member of the
enlightened nations,'' Paritsky told Israel TV.
</P>
<P>
	   One group the new measure would not help is Jewish Israelis who want civil
marriages. Polansky noted that Israelis who are not citizens of a second country
will not be able to marry at the missions unless their spouses-to-be hold
foreign citizenship.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Apologizes for Diallo Comment  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Hillary Rodham Clinton apologized for calling the police
shooting of unarmed immigrant Amadou Diallo a ``murder.''
</P>
<P>
	   ``I misspoke,'' she said on WNBC-TV's ``News Forum,'' which aired Sunday.
``That was just a misstatement on my part.''
</P>
<P>
	   Clinton had used the word on Martin Luther King Day, when she noted that
Sen. Charles Schumer, D-N.Y., had given ``a speech after the tragic murder of
Mr. Diallo in which he said that what every community, but particularly the
African-American community, wants is to be respected and protected.''
</P>
<P>
	   The four officers on trial in the shooting of Diallo have pleaded innocent
to charges of second-degree murder.
</P>
<P>
	   When their trial began two weeks ago, a group of police officers and others
held a news conference saying the first lady had ``prejudged the officers'' and
``poisoned the jury pool.''
</P>
<P>
	   Clinton said on Sunday's show that whether the death was a case of murder
was ``what the jury should decide.''

<HEADLINE> Gore Visits 2 Black Churches in NYC  </HEADLINE>
   By SANDRA SOBIERAJ Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   NEW YORK (AP) -- A week before he debates Bill Bradley at Harlem's Apollo
Theater, Vice President Al Gore squeezed in Sunday services at not one, but two,
black churches and met privately with Rev. Al Sharpton.
</P>
<P>
	   Sharpton, who sharply accused Gore last week of ignoring inner cities in his
presidential campaign, ducked out of the meeting with neither an endorsement for
Gore nor much comment to reporters waiting outside the apartment building of
Gore's eldest daughter, Karenna.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We've had a good meeting and that's all I'm going to say,'' said Sharpton.
Campaign spokesman Chris Lehane said an endorsement was not discussed in the
hourlong meeting, which included campaign manager Donna Brazile.
</P>
<P>
	   In his hasty day of courtship with New York City black activists who can
turn out tens of thousands of votes in the March 7 primary, Gore fared better at
Allen A.M.E. Church in Queens.
</P>
<P>
	   His hand flying to his chest, Gore gasped at the surprise endorsement Rev.
Floyd B. Flake delivered from the pulpit just after Gore addressed the
congregation of New York's fastest-growing church.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I don't do endorsements from across the pulpit because I never know who's
out there watching the types of laws that govern separation of church and state,
but I will say to you this morning and you read it well: This should be the next
president of the United States,'' said Flake, a former Democratic congressman.
</P>
<P>
	   On what was to have been a rare day off, Gore rerouted his flight home
Saturday night from California to New York for the late additions to his
campaign schedule: 8:30 a.m. worship at Calvary Baptist Church, also in Queens,
and the 11:15 a.m. service at Allen, which stretched nearly three hours.
</P>
<P>
	   Gore was returning to New York on Monday for a speech at Medgar Evers
College in Brooklyn. Bradley, the vice president's Democratic opponent in the
hard-fought campaign for March 7 primaries in New York and California, took
Sunday off in California.
</P>
<P>
	   At both churches, Gore quoted a handful of Scriptures and hymns and recited
in rapid, staccato cadence all the top Clinton-Gore administration appointments
that went to blacks.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Just reflect for a moment. ... and the list goes on... We have been a
successful administration not in spite of diversity but because of diversity,''
Gore said to applause.
</P>
<P>
	   Gore's standing among the city's influential black activists was shaken a
week ago when Bradley visited Allen A.M.E. Church and was embraced by Flake and
Sharpton. Both saluted Bradley for his outreach to minority voters -- and
criticized Gore's efforts.
</P>
<P>
	   In particular, Sharpton knocked Gore for not campaigning in many black
neighborhoods, and he threatened to ``mobilize against'' the vice president if
Gore did not agree to debate Bradley in front of a black audience in the city.
That debate is scheduled for Feb. 21 at the Apollo.
</P>
<P>
	   Between services, Gore looked for votes -- and grits and bacon -- at
Carmichael's Diner in southeast Queens.
</P>
<P>
	   At the counter and waiting for his own to-go breakfast order, James McNeill
was perturbed that the fuss over Gore was making him late for his shift driving
a bus at LaGuardia Airport.
</P>
<P>
	   He said he was an undecided voter and he resisted Gore's press for a
commitment of support. ``I got to see what the other guy's got to offer,''
McNeill said.
</P>
<P>
	   After days of stubbornly dodging the question of whether Gore wanted to meet
Sharpton, campaign spokesman Chris Lehane said Sunday: ``We made it clear we're
going to meet with Democrats across New York, including representatives of
important communities.''
</P>
<P>
	   Sharpton garnered between 150,000 and 160,000 votes in the 1997 Democratic
mayoral primary, Lehane noted.
</P>
<P>
	   Sharpton has spoken of lingering ill feelings over Gore's 1988 presidential
campaign when New York Mayor Ed Koch, after endorsing Gore, engaged in a
racially charged feud with the Rev. Jesse Jackson, another Democratic primary
contender that year.
</P>
<P>
	   Gore reminded the Allen congregation of a different anniversary -- the
``Bloody Sunday'' 35 years ago on March 7, when civil rights activists were
brutally blocked in their protest march through Alabama. Martin Luther King Jr.
had pledged that day not to be stopped, Gore said.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Well, we're going to make the final journey to justice together as
Americans,'' Gore said. Quoting a hymn by James Weldon Johnson, Gore added:
``Facing the rising sun of our new day begun, let us march on 'til victory is
won.''

   LINTHICUM, Md. (AP) -- A light rail commuter train arriving at
Baltimore-Washington International Airport hit a safety barrier at the end of
the line and derailed Sunday, injuring the train's conductor and most of its 30
passengers, a transit official said.

<P>

transported to several area hospitals. Their conditions were not immediately
available.

	   The one-car train originated at Baltimore's Penn Station and normally would
have been traveling about 13 miles per hour as it neared the end its trip about
2:45 p.m., Fulton said. Investigators were trying to determine how fast it was
moving when it hit the barrier.
</P>
<P>
	   Witnesses said they heard the train's brakes screeching just before the
crash.

<HEADLINE> British Duke Gives Cross to Dresden  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   DRESDEN, Germany (AP) -- Britain's Duke of Kent marked the 55th anniversary
Sunday of the Allied firebombing that devastated Dresden, giving the city a
gilded orb and cross to place atop a church leveled in the attack.
</P>
<P>
	   The 18-foot handmade ornament is a replica of one that once graced Dresden's
skyline. The original sat atop the Baroque Frauenkirche, or Church of Our Lady,
until the 1945 Anglo-American raid that killed about 35,000 people.
</P>
<P>
	   East Germany's communist rulers left the church in ruins, viewing it as a
reminder of the horrors of war. Work on clearing away the rubble began in 1994,
and a $125 million reconstruction is scheduled to be completed by 2006.
</P>
<P>
	   The cross and orb replica was commissioned by the Dresden Trust, a British
group that raised around $450,000 from individuals, charities and companies. It
was turned over by the duke, Queen Elizabeth II's cousin, at a liturgy attended
by German Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder.

<HEADLINE> Trump Nixes Presidential Run  </HEADLINE>
   By RON FOURNIER AP Political Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- New York tycoon Donald Trump has decided against running
for president, ending a lengthy flirtation with the notion that he could tap his
personal fortune to capture the White House as a third-party candidate, The
Associated Press learned.
</P>
<P>
	   Sources connected with New York's Independence Party movement, speaking on
condition of anonymity, said Trump has told associates he will announce Monday
that he is not mounting a presidential bid.
</P>
<P>
	   After months of speculation about a possible Reform Party campaign, Trump
decided recently that the party is too fractured to support a credible
presidential candidate, the officials said. The Reform Party operates in New
York under the Independence Party banner.
</P>
<P>
	   He met over the weekend with advisers to consider a second option, running
as an Independence Party candidate, but determined there is not enough time to
get on state ballots. Trump considered that option out of respect for Minnesota
Gov. Jesse Ventura, who had been the Reform Party's highest elected official
before leaving the ``dysfunctional'' party last week to reinvigorate his state's
Independence Party.
</P>
<P>
	   Ventura and Trump were allies during Reform Party squabbling that culminated
last Friday with the governor's departure and the ouster of a Ventura ally as
party chairman.
</P>
<P>
	   A fractious Reform Party meeting Saturday in Tennessee returned power to
allies of party founder Ross Perot, who has not ruled out running for president
a third time.
</P>
<P>
	   Though he had not formally entered the race, Trump made a handful of
campaign trips, hinted broadly for weeks that he would run and issued
comprehensive health care and national debt reduction proposals. He held a
single-digit ranking in most public polls, and was not given much of a chance of
winning the presidency.
</P>
<P>
	   Trump estimates his personal net worth at $5 billion. Though independent
analysis lead to lower estimates, there is no doubt he was wealthy enough to
make inroads toward the Reform Party nomination.
</P>
<P>
	   His decision leaves former Republican Pat Buchanan as the front-running
candidate for the Reform Party's nomination. Buchanan left the GOP after two
failed presidential bids, eying the nearly $13 million in federal money that
will be awarded Reform's nominee.
</P>
<P>
	   Many Perot allies encouraged Buchanan to bolt the GOP and join the Reform
Party, in part because they hoped the conservative firebrand could help defy
Ventura's wing of the party. With Ventura out of the way, Perot's allies are now
speculating that the wealthy Texas businessman could seek the nomination
himself.
</P>
<P>
	   Perot has not confirmed or denied the speculation.
</P>
<P>
	   Steve Forbes, another multimillionaire dabbling in politics, last week
became the seventh GOP candidate to pull out of the race. Vice President Al Gore
and former New Jersey senator Bill Bradley are the sole Democratic combatants.

<P>
	   Today is Monday, Feb. 14, the 45th day of 2000. There are 321 days left in
the year. This is Valentine's Day.
</P>
<P>
	   Today's Highlight in History:
</P>
<P>
	   On Feb. 14, 1920, the League of Women Voters was founded in Chicago; its
first president was Maude Wood Park.
</P>
<P>
	   On this date:
</P>
<P>
	   In 1778, the American ship Ranger arrived in France, flying the recently
adopted Stars and Stripes in a foreign port for the first time.
</P>
<P>
	   In 1859, Oregon was admitted to the Union as the 33rd state.
</P>
<P>
	   In 1895, Oscar Wilde's final play, ``The Importance of Being Earnest,''
opened at the St. James's Theatre in London.
</P>
<P>
	   In 1899, Congress approved, and President McKinley signed, legislation
authorizing states to use voting machines for federal elections.
</P>
<P>
	   In 1903, the Department of Commerce and Labor was established.
</P>
<P>
	   In 1912, Arizona became the 48th state of the Union.
</P>
<P>
	   In 1929, the St. Valentine's Day Massacre took place in a Chicago garage as
seven rivals of Al Capone's gang were gunned down.
</P>
<P>
	   In 1945, Peru, Paraguay, Chile and Ecuador joined the United Nations.
</P>
<P>
	   In 1962, First Lady Jacqueline Kennedy conducted a televised tour of the
White House.
</P>
<P>
	   In 1989, Iran's Ayatollah Khomeini called on Muslims to kill Salman Rushdie,
author of ``The Satanic Verses,'' a novel condemned as blasphemous.
</P>
<P>
	   Ten years ago: Ninety-four people were killed when an Indian Airlines
passenger jet crashed while landing at a southern Indian airport.
</P>
<P>
	   Five years ago: A federal judge rejected the Justice Department's proposed
antitrust settlement with Microsoft Corporation; U.S. District Judge Stanley
Sporkin was later overruled by an appeals court. The House passed the

	   KOSOVSKA MITROVICA, Yugoslavia (AP) -- Fighting between peacekeepers and
snipers, along with grenade attacks on ethnic Albanians, killed one person and
reportedly wounded 19 Sunday in Kosovska Mitrovica, a bitterly divided city. Two
of the wounded were French soldiers, hit by ethnic Albanian snipers firing from
the northern, Serb-controlled part of the city, NATO officials said. NATO
peacekeepers launched a counterattack, killing one of the snipers and wounding
five others. Seventeen people were detained by late Sunday, NATO said, but gave
no details. Peacekeepers imposed a curfew from sunset to daybreak.

Democrats are mobilizing behind Sen. John McCain in an effort to skew South

that this was the case. McCain said Bush's allegation that some Democrats are
supporting McCain because they believe he would be the easier candidate to
defeat in the general election in November "flies in the face of the facts." It
was his message that was attracting non-Republicans, McCain said.

apparently sunk to non-lethal levels Sunday after reaching the Danube. Before
that, however, it had devastated the river in Hungary and Serbia. The cyanide
spill originated in northwest Romania, near the border town of Oradea, where a

an Iranian radio report said. After the late Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini
announced the sentence on Feb. 14, claiming Rushdie had blasphemed Islam in "The
Satanic Verses," the 52-year-old Rushdie spent nearly a decade in hiding under
police protection. He emerged in September 1998 when Iran's Foreign Minister

18-under 270 and earned a career-high $540,000. "At least I made it interesting

<HEADLINE> Trump Nixes Presidential Run  </HEADLINE>
   By RON FOURNIER AP Political Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- New York tycoon Donald Trump has decided against running
for president, ending a lengthy flirtation with the notion that he could tap his
personal fortune to capture the White House as a third-party candidate, The
Associated Press learned.
</P>
<P>
	   Sources connected with New York's Independence Party movement, speaking on
condition of anonymity, said Trump has told associates he will announce Monday
that he is not mounting a presidential bid.
</P>
<P>
	   His decision leaves former Republican Pat Buchanan as the front-running
candidate for the Reform Party's nomination. Buchanan left the GOP after two
failed presidential bids, eying the nearly $13 million in federal money that
will be awarded Reform's nominee.
</P>
<P>
	   After months of speculation about a possible Reform Party campaign, Trump
decided recently that the party is too fractured to support a credible
presidential candidate, the officials said. The Reform Party operates in New
York under the Independence Party banner.
</P>
<P>
	   He met over the weekend with advisers to consider a second option, running
as an Independence Party candidate, but determined there is not enough time to
get on state ballots. Trump considered that option out of respect for Minnesota
Gov. Jesse Ventura, who had been the Reform Party's highest elected official
before leaving the ``dysfunctional'' party last week to reinvigorate his state's
Independence Party.
</P>
<P>
	   Ventura and Trump were allies during Reform Party squabbling that culminated
last Friday with the governor's departure and the ouster of a Ventura ally as
party chairman.
</P>
<P>
	   A fractious Reform Party meeting Saturday in Tennessee returned power to
allies of party founder Ross Perot, who has not ruled out running for president
a third time.
</P>
<P>
	   Though he had not formally entered the race, Trump made a handful of
campaign trips, hinted broadly for weeks that he would run and issued
comprehensive health care and national debt reduction proposals. He held a
single-digit ranking in most public polls, and was not given much of a chance of
winning the presidency.
</P>
<P>
	   Trump estimates his personal net worth at $5 billion. Though independent
analysis lead to lower estimates, there is no doubt he was wealthy enough to
make inroads toward the Reform Party nomination.
</P>
<P>
	   Many Perot allies encouraged Buchanan to bolt the GOP and join the Reform
Party, in part because they hoped the conservative firebrand could help defy
Ventura's wing of the party. With Ventura out of the way, Perot's allies are now
speculating that the wealthy Texas businessman could seek the nomination
himself.
</P>
<P>
	   Perot has not confirmed or denied the speculation.
</P>
<P>
	   Steve Forbes, another multimillionaire dabbling in politics, last week
became the seventh GOP candidate to pull out of the race. Vice President Al Gore
and former New Jersey senator Bill Bradley are the sole Democratic combatants.

<HEADLINE> No.19 Temple 73, No. 23 Maryland 65  </HEADLINE>
    By JIM O'CONNELL AP Basketball Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   PHILADELPHIA (AP) -- Temple got what it usually gets from its zone defenses.
The Owls also got some impressive performances from a couple of players who have
been struggling.
</P>
<P>
	   All that meant the 19th-ranked Owls beat No. 23 Maryland 73-65 Sunday in a
February non-conference game played with the intensity of a March tournament
matchup.
</P>
<P>
	   Lamont Barnes, who had scored in double figures only twice in the last nine
games, had 23 points and Lynn Greer, who was 2-for-11 from the field in his last
game and 0-for-5 in the first half of this one, scored all 14 of his points in
the second half as the Owls (18-4) won their ninth straight game overall and
20th in a row at home.
</P>
<P>
	   The defense provided its usual numbers, holding Maryland to 38 percent
shooting (24-for-63) while forcing 27 turnovers.
</P>
<P>
	   "It was good to play a team like this," Temple coach John Chaney said. "You
have to face a team like that to play good defense."
</P>
<P>
	   The Terrapins (17-7), who were coming off their upset win at No. 3 Duke, had
no answer down the stretch as Temple started pulling away.
</P>
<P>
	   "It wasn't our defense that lost this game it was the way we executed our
offense against the zone," Maryland coach Gary Williams said. "Twenty-seven
turnovers, you don't have to look any farther."
</P>
<P>
	   Greer scored 10 straight points for Temple as it took the lead for good. His
consecutive 3-pointers made it 53-49 with 7:23 left.
</P>
<P>
	   Consecutive jumpers by Mark Karcher, who finished with 18 points, gave the
Owls a 59-54 lead with 4:33 left. Maryland got within 64-60 on a rebound basket
by Terence Morris with 59 seconds left, but the Owls went 9-for-10 from the free
throw line over the final 52 seconds.
</P>
<P>
	   "We got some good looks in the first half but maybe we were rushing too
much," Greer said. "In the second half we took our time a lot more. That was a
good test for us. It's a big change from Atlantic 10 teams."
</P>
<P>
	   It was also quite a change for Maryland from what it is used to seeing in
the Atlantic Coast Conference.
</P>
<P>
	   "We never see zones in the ACC and they play a good one," Williams said.
</P>
<P>
	   Morris finished with 17 points -- 11 over final six minutes -- and 12
rebounds for the Terrapins, who had won four straight games and six of seven.
Juan Dixon had 21 points for Maryland, which finished with a 48-30 rebound
advantage, while Lonny Baxter had 11.
</P>
<P>
	   The 27 turnovers were one off Maryland's season high.
</P>
<P>
	   "They played good defense but a lot of our turnovers were careless," Dixon
said. "We played well in the first half and had a little run in the second half
but they had the last run.
</P>
<P>
	   Pepe Sanchez had five points, 11 assists and a career-high nine steals for
the Owls, who lead the nation in scoring defense at 53.9 points per game and are
second in field goal percentage defense at 35.1.
</P>
<P>
	   Temple used a 14-0 run to take a 27-20 lead, but Maryland answered with a
10-0 run. The game was tied 30-30 at halftime, only the third time this season a
team reached 30 points at the half against Temple.
</P>
<P>
	   Chaney has been hard on Barnes in recent weeks and didn't back down after
the senior forward went 7-for-9 from the field and grabbed eight rebounds.
</P>
<P>
	   "He just showed up today. We gave the ball like we always do. He was the old
Lamont today," Chaney said. "He's been wandering through the desert for the last
three years."
</P>
<P>
	   Barnes has his own way of dealing with Chaney's style of criticism.
</P>
<P>
	   "Whenever I leave here and I'm in my dorm, I find myself thinking about the
stuff he says to me," Barnes said. "It makes sense. He's taught me a lot. You
can't just pinpoint one thing."
</P>
<P>
	   Chaney said that before the game the team found out that Steven Wesby, the
older brother of freshman reserve Alex Wesby, had died Saturday night in nearby
Bristol. Steven Wesby died of an "apparent drug overdose" at a party in a
Bristol motel, Bucks County coroner Joseph Campbell said Sunday. Toxicology
tests are scheduled.
</P>
<P>
	   "It was a tough situation for us," Chaney said. "Bill Cosby came in and sat
the kid down and we said some prayers."
</P>
<P>
	   Cosby was the main speaker in a pregame ceremony that saw Temple's building
renamed from the Apollo to the Peter J. Liacouras Center after the school's
president who is retiring on June 30.

<HEADLINE> Tiger Stalls, But Doesn't Stop  </HEADLINE>
    By JIM LITKE AP Sports Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   SAN DIEGO (AP) -- This was a pause, not a full stop.
</P>
<P>
	   Tiger Woods did not win the Buick Invitational on Sunday. But he won it last
year. And he will be the odds-on favorite to win it next year, too.
</P>
<P>
	   Woods will not be the defending champion next week, when the PGA Tour moves
up the coast to Los Angeles for the Nissan Open. He will not have The Streak to
defend, either. But he finished second there last year and he will be the
favorite there this time around, too.
</P>
<P>
	   The same is true for the Match Play Championship the week after that, the
Masters in six weeks after that, and every tournament that Woods' entry fee
arrives postmarked by midnight of the appropriate date. In fact, it was never
more true than at that moment when Phil Mickelson picked up the winner's crystal
and pocketed the $540,000 check, the very same moment that The Streak officially
came to an end.
</P>
<P>
	   "I think," Woods said very matter-of-factly, "it can be done again."
</P>
<P>
	   This was not bragging. What Mickelson accomplished was huge, and perhaps
nobody appreciated it more than Woods himself.
</P>
<P>
	   The left-hander was playing in front of a home crowd and pulled himself out
of a loss that had career-crushing written all over it. In doing so, Mickelson
accomplished what 150 or so other seasoned, hardworking, weightlifting,
thoroughly devoted professionals have been unable to do for weeks. He stood up
to Tiger Woods. He broke his momentum.
</P>
<P>
	   But make no mistake: He did not break Woods. In fact, he barely slowed him
down.
</P>
<P>
	   Instead of having his confidence shaken by the loss, Woods said it had
merely been stirred.
</P>
<P>
	   "I actually feel more confident than I did at the beginning of the week
because of how I played. You saw how poorly I hit it at times," he said. "Just
to scramble and get it around and hang in there, to get up and down as many
times as I did and give myself a chance to win, you've got to be proud of
yourself.
</P>
<P>
	   "I didn't back off, I didn't dog it out there."
</P>
<P>
	   For all its drama, the battle on the back nine at Torrey Pines resembled an
NBA floor at least as much as a golf course. You've seen the same scenario
unfold a hundred times. One team runs out to a big lead, much like Mickelson's
6-stroke advantage at the start of the final round, then stumbles when it's time
to answer the other team's comeback.
</P>
<P>
	   Woods knocked one stroke off the deficit with a birdie at the opening hole.
But he needed a fortuitous bounce off a lawn chair three yards into the rough on
the left side of the fairway to kick his tee shot back into the fairway first.
</P>
<P>
	   Everybody else assumed that was an omen, the prelude to another fantastic
finish. It was an omen, all right, but only Woods interpreted it correctly. He
knew it meant he would be fighting his swing all day, the same way he had over
all four days.

<HEADLINE> Mickelson Ends Woods Winning Streak  </HEADLINE>
    By DOUG FERGUSON AP Golf Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   SAN DIEGO (AP) -- The Streak ended in style.
</P>
<P>
	   Tiger Woods defied the odds once again by erasing a seven-stroke deficit in
just seven holes. Just as quickly, he fell victim to his own mistakes and a
sudden revival by Phil Mickelson.
</P>
<P>
	   The longest PGA Tour winning streak in 52 years stopped Sunday in the Buick
Invitational, where Mickelson won for the first time in 18 months and left Byron
Nelson's record run of 11 straight victories as the standard.
</P>
<P>
	   "At least I made it interesting for Phil," Woods said.
</P>
<P>
	   In a final round packed with as much drama as a major championship,
Mickelson recovered from two double bogeys with back-to-back birdies that
finally gave him a lead too large even for Woods to overcome.
</P>
<P>
	   Mickelson closed with a 2-under 70 for a four-stroke victory over Woods and
Shigeki Maruyama, the 14th of his career. He finished at 18-under 270 and earned
a career-high $540,000.
</P>
<P>
	   "I have a lot of confidence after this week," Mickelson said. "I tackled the
best in the world and I won."
</P>
<P>
	   And so, the guy who started The Streak finally ended it six months later.
</P>
<P>
	   Mickelson was the first victim in a streak that began with Woods' one-stroke
victory in the NEC Invitational in August.
</P>
<P>
	   This time, Woods was seven strokes down with 12 holes to play. Seven holes
later, Woods pointed at the cup as his ball fell to the bottom for a 5-foot
birdie on the 13th hole that gave him a share of the lead at 15-under.
</P>
<P>
	   Shocked at his sudden collapse on a course where he grew up, Mickelson
finally answered. After pushing his tee shot under a eucalyptus tree and having
to lay up, he hit a 116-yard wedge to 2 feet for birdie to regain the lead.
</P>
<P>
	   And then Woods finally blinked.
</P>
<P>
	   With only a 9-iron in his hand, he was 25 feet right of his target, above
the hole on No. 14, blew his putt 6 feet by and missed it coming back -- a
three-putt bogey, after taking only 15 putts on his first 13 holes.
</P>
<P>
	   Mickelson, watching from the fairway as Woods made his first bogey in 44
holes, dropped a wedge into 6 feet for birdie and a three-stroke lead.
</P>
<P>
	   Woods bogeyed the next hole from the bunker, and a smile crept over his
face.
</P>
<P>
	   "It means I came in second," Woods said, who joins Ben Hogan in 1948 with
six-tournament winning streaks.
</P>
<P>
	   And it means Nelson, who set his remarkable record in 1945, can rest easy --
for now.
</P>
<P>
	   It was a heart-pumping end to a streak that captured the imagination of the
entire tour. And it did nothing to diminish the fact that Woods' dominance of
his generation may be greater than any other player's in golf history.
</P>
<P>
	   "It's disappointing I didn't win," Woods said. "I just wasn't hitting it
good enough to give myself a viable chance down the stretch, and it finally
caught up with me. To even be under par ... was kind of a miracle."
</P>
<P>
	   Woods hit only 10 greens in regulation and missed eight fairways, but he
still scraped together a 68, and he still gave Mickelson a major scare.
</P>
<P>
	   Maruyama had a 72 in his quest to become the first Japanese player since
Isao Aoki in 1983 to win on the PGA Tour.
</P>
<P>
	   Mickelson, who was tied for 134th in final-round scoring last year and only
two weeks ago blew a final-round lead in Phoenix with a 40, showed the kind of
courage that may help him win his first major championship down the road.
</P>
<P>
	   Don't be surprised if Woods is there waiting for him. While the streak is
over, Woods still has not finished worse than seventh in a stroke-play
tournament since April.
</P>
<P>
	   Woods has developed such a commanding presence on tour that he was asked on
the eve of the final round which players might make a run at him -- even though
he was six shots out of the lead.
</P>
<P>
	   And while Mickelson had control on a course he calls home, there was enough
tension in the cool, damp air to make the final round of the Buick Invitational
feel like a green jacket would be slipped over the champion's shoulders at the
end of the day.
</P>
<P>
	   A gallery that swelled to 35,000 -- unheard of for this tournament --
desperately wanted to be witness to another Woods comeback.
</P>
<P>
	   It looked early as though luck would be on Woods' side when his drive headed
left for the gallery, struck the leg of an aluminum beach chair and kicked out
in the fairway. From there, Woods laced an approach that landed 7 feet left of
the hole.
</P>
<P>
	   He made the putt and pumped his fist pretty hard for such a short putt,
especially one so early in the round. It was a clear sign that while Woods had
not been wrapped up in the Streak -- he had a high school pal on his bag this
week -- the fire to win burns every week.
</P>
<P>
	   Mickelson had plenty of fire, too, and played like a someone trying to
protect his home turf. He used to play the front nine of Torrey Pines South
three times a week when he was in high school, and he made it look easy.
</P>
<P>
	   After struggling to make three pars, Mickelson smoked his driver 318 yards
down the fourth fairway and his an approach that landed 12 feet past the hole
and spun back to 2 feet for birdie. A 10-foot birdie followed on the next hole,
and his 40-foot eagle putt on No. 6 just dropped below the hole for a tap-in
birdie.
</P>
<P>
	   That put him at 19-under, still seven strokes clear of Woods and four ahead
of a fading Maruyama.
</P>
<P>
	   No problem, right?
</P>
<P>
	   Mickelson was a 13-time winner on the PGA Tour, not a 28-year-old rookie
like Matt Gogel, who ballooned to a 40 on the back nine at Pebble last week that
gave Woods the help he needed to win his sixth in a row.
</P>
<P>
	   Just like that, however, the comfortable margin turned into a
throat-gripping finish.
</P>
<P>
	   From the seventh fairway, Mickelson hit a wild approach that landed just far
enough in front of a tree to restrict his swing. Double bogey.
</P>
<P>
	   On the par-3 11th, he missed the green and chunked his first chip so badly
it stayed in the rough. Double bogey.
</P>
<P>
	   After two par saves, Woods hit his approach into No. 12 to 3 feet for
birdie, then tied Mickelson for the lead with another birdie on No. 13. He
wasn't spectacular, but his presence alone was a factor.
</P>
<P>
	   As Davis Love III said earlier in the week, "Jack Nicklaus won a lot of golf
tournaments by having his name up there, not by how he played coming down the
stretch. Guys believe sometimes more in other people's game than their own."
</P>
<P>
	   Mickelson had every reason to believe in Woods. But the guy who has had
problems closing out tournaments finally believed more in himself.

<HEADLINE> No. 6 Penn St 78, No. 15 Purdue 67  </HEADLINE>
    By DAVID KINNEY Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   STATE COLLEGE, Pa. (AP) -- Maren Walseth had 17 points and a career-high 15
rebounds as No. 6 Penn State beat No. 15 Purdue 78-67 on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
	   The Big Ten-leading Lady Lions (20-3, 11-1) cleared their biggest hurdle to
a conference title. Their remaining games are against four of the five worst
teams in the conference.
</P>
<P>
	   Lisa Shepherd added 16 points, including eight in the final six minutes, and
Helen Darling had 14.
</P>
<P>
	   Katie Douglas scored 20 of her 25 points in the second half to lead Purdue
back from 12 points down. Camille Cooper had 15 points and 11 rebounds.
</P>
<P>
	   After tying the game, the Boilermakers did not make a field goal and had
only four free throws over the final 5:25. Penn State went ahead 71-65 on a
drive by Shepherd, then went 7-of-8 from the line. The Lions were 28-for-33 from
the line overall.
</P>
<P>
	   With their 55-50 victory over Purdue last month, the Lions swept the
Boilermakers (17-6, 9-4) after losing five straight since 1997. The Boilermakers
had an eight-game winning streak snapped.
</P>
<P>
	   It was no wonder Purdue's streak came to an end: Other than a short stretch
in the second half, they played nothing like they had over the past month. They
had been shooting 45 percent from the field, but shot only 39 percent against
the Lions. After grabbing 12.3 more rebounds per game than their opponents, they
were outrebounded 48-32 against Penn State.
</P>
<P>
	   Trailing by nine with 14:55 to play, Purdue came back thanks to four Lions
turnovers in a two-minute stretch. Driving to the basket on every play, the
Boilermakers cut the lead to 50-47 on Kelly Komara's coast-to-coast layup off a
steal. Then Komora and Douglas each hit 3-pointers to tie it at 57-57 with 8:13
to play.
</P>
<P>
	   But Shepherd scored eight of Penn State's next 12 points, driving in for
three baskets and hitting two foul shots to put Penn State ahead 71-65.
</P>
<P>
	   The Lions took a 39-30 lead at halftime behind Walseth's 10 points and 10
rebounds. Walseth came on strong after top scorer Andrea Garner sat with two
fouls for 11 minutes in the first half. Purdue went one-for-10 during a 14-4
Penn State run over almost seven minutes.
</P>
<P>
	   The Lions improved to 12-0 at home and, if they defeat Minnesota Feb. 24,
would finish unbeaten at home for the first time since 1994.

<HEADLINE> Landry Remembered as Man of Faith  </HEADLINE>
    By MIKE CRISSEY Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   DALLAS (AP) -- Tom Landry's friends and fellow churchgoers at Highland Park
United Methodist Church remembered him Sunday as a devout Christian who learned
how to appreciate life and taught others to do the same.
</P>
<P>
	   The Rev. Mark Craig focused his sermon on making memories. The theme was
based on a sermon Landry gave several years ago, one Craig called the best he'd
ever heard.
</P>
<P>
	   "He talked about joys and pain and happiness," Craig told more than 1,000
worshippers. "Through all the good and the bad he said he was thankful God gave
him another day. If you want great memories, you need to live each day fully and
thank God for another day."
</P>
<P>
	   Landry died around 6 p.m. Saturday at Baylor University Medical Center
surrounded by his immediate family. He was 75 and had been fighting a form of
leukemia since May.
</P>
<P>
	   Landry coached the Dallas Cowboys for 29 years, from their birth in 1960
until Jerry Jones bought the team Feb. 25, 1989. He maintained a low profile in
retirement, but he remained one of the most beloved members of the community.
</P>
<P>
	   Faith was more important to Landry than football. He became a born-again
Christian in 1959 and was a member of Highland Park United Methodist for 43
years.
</P>
<P>
	   Craig met with Landry's family early Sunday to discuss memorial and funeral
services. Details are expected to be released Monday.
</P>
<P>
	   Throughout the Dallas area, fans paid their own tributes.
</P>
<P>
	   At team headquarters, several mourners left tributes outside the main
entrance. The makeshift memorial included individual flowers, bouquets, candles
and cards.
</P>
<P>
	   "Coach Landry, Thank you for being so kind," read one card. An index card
placed in the ground behind several candles read: "Coach Landry, We will always
love you. You were a great person first and a great coach. We know you are in
heaven and in peace. Thank you for everything."
</P>
<P>
	   At Texas Stadium -- which one local columnist suggested Sunday should be
renamed Landry Stadium -- another gathering point was beneath a giant photo of
Landry that is among many pictures surrounding the facade.
</P>
<P>
	   Delores Castorena purchased a blue flag featuring the team's helmet at a
concession stand in the parking lot, wrote "A legend never dies" near the star,
signed her name and attached it and a photo to the chain-link fence under
Landry's image.
</P>
<P>
	   The gathering point in Mission, Texas, Landry's hometown, was the downtown
mural located on a street named in his honor.
</P>
<P>
	   "He's one of our heroes," said Marco Ramos, who visited the painting with
his mother and brother. "He's a role model and example for all of us."
</P>
<P>
	   Landry was respected throughout the country so much that when he was fired
by Jones in February 1989, President George Bush was among those who called to
offer their best wishes. On Sunday, his son, Gov. George W. Bush, offered his
condolences to the Landry family.
</P>
<P>
	   "Tom Landry represented what makes Texas great -- faith in God, commitment
to family and a competitive spirit based on character, hard work and
determination," Bush said in a statement. "He touched the heart and soul of
Texas, and he left the world a better place."
</P>
<P>
	   Landry would've blushed at such statements. He often downplayed his success
in football, preferring instead to concentrate on his spiritual life, Craig
said.
</P>
<P>
	   "He talked about his accomplishments in life modestly, which is hard to do,"
Craig said. "He talked of winning one Super Bowl and then a second. And then he
stopped and said it was nothing. He said it wasn't until he realized how great
God was and what God did in his life that he lived."
</P>
<P>
	   Dr. Bryan Frank, 43, who heads up the medical outreach for the church, said
his first memories of Landry were his lectures to members of the Fellowship of
Christian Athletes when Frank was a teen-ager running track.
</P>
<P>
	   "In a world of celebrity and ego, coach Landry was really a man of faith,
character, integrity and dignity," Frank said.

<HEADLINE> Ravens' Lewis Insists He's Innocent  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
    BALTIMORE (AP) -- Ray Lewis declared his innocence in a prison interview
Sunday and said he knew, as his limousine sped from the scene of a double murder
in Atlanta, that he would be the central figure in the case because of his
status as an NFL player.
</P>
<P>
	   Lewis would not discuss the specifics of the case, but said he is innocent
and has been falsely accused.
</P>
<P>
	   The Baltimore Ravens linebacker said in a prison interview with WNUV-TV that
he also feels God is placing obstacles in his way for a reason, the television
station reported. The interview was not taped -- instead, the reporter related
Lewis' comments.
</P>
<P>
	   Lewis also said he is confident he will be released from prison following a
scheduled bond hearing on Monday. If given a chance to speak to the court, Lewis
said he hopes to reach out the victims' families and tell them he feels their
loss. He hopes they will not judge him until all of the facts are known, the
station reported.
</P>
<P>
	   The station also reported that suspect Joseph Sweeting of Miami is in
Atlanta, where he is expected to surrender to authorities.
</P>
<P>
	   Lewis was indicted on Friday for the stabbing deaths of two men at an
Atlanta club following the Super Bowl.
</P>
<P>
	   Lewis, a three-time Pro Bowl linebacker, is being held without bail, pending
the bond hearing. He is charged with the deaths of Richard Lollar, 24, and
Jacinth Baker, 21.
</P>
<P>
	   Lewis' attorneys have maintained his innocence, saying he tried to break up
the Jan. 31 fight. They said he was at least 60 feet away when Richard Lollar,
24, and Jacinth Baker, 21, both of Decatur, Ga., were stabbed and did not see
the crime.
</P>
<P>
	   Authorities have said Lewis drove away in a limousine and later was
uncooperative with investigators, providing misleading statements.

<HEADLINE> Japan Insurers Drop Merger Plans  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
    TOKYO (AP) -- Three insurance companies have abandoned plans for a merger
that would have formed Japan's largest non-life insurer, news reports said
Monday.
</P>
<P>
	   Mitsui Marine and Fire Insurance Co., Japan's third-largest casualty
insurer, has decided not to merge with the smaller Nippon Fire and Insurance Co.
and Koa Fire and Insurance Co., NHK television reported.
</P>
<P>
	   The three companies announced last October plans to combine their businesses
by April 2002, forming an entity that would have surpassed Tokio Marine and Fire
Insurance Co. as Japan's largest non-life insurer.
</P>
<P>
	   Mitsui Marine will instead enter talks to merge with Sumitomo Marine and
Fire Insurance Co., number four among non-life insurers, while Nippon Fire and
Koa Fire will join forces as originally planned, NHK said.
</P>
<P>
	   Mitsui Marine spokeswoman Megumi Onodera said the company is "still
considering its decision" and plans to make an announcement on the matter later
Monday.
</P>
<P>
	   Media reports said the three-way negotiations failed because hopes of
achieving economies of scale proved weaker than loyalties to traditional
industry groups.
</P>
<P>
	   Mitsui Marine is affiliated with an industry group centered around Sakura
Bank Ltd., while Koa Fire and Nippon Fire are in the group affiliated with Sanwa
Bank Ltd.

<HEADLINE> Indonesian General Suspended  </HEADLINE>
   By SLOBODAN LEKIC Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) -- In a surprise reversal, President Abdurrahman
Wahid suspended his powerful security minister, Gen. Wiranto, from the Cabinet
over his alleged role in last year's bloodshed in East Timor, newspapers
reported Monday.
</P>
<P>
	   Upon his return home Sunday following a 16-day overseas tour, Wahid met with
Wiranto and announced that the minister would remain part of the government
while the attorney general's office conducted a new formal inquiry into the
violence that followed East Timor's vote for independence.
</P>
<P>
	   But late Sunday night, the president, who has been known to frequently make
strong statements on issues only to ignore them later or change his stance, told
Indonesian reporters that Wahid would be suspended from the Cabinet during the
new probe.
</P>
<P>
	   ``While waiting for the attorney general's special team to investigate Gen.
Wiranto, I have taken a decision to deactivate him from duty, and (appoint)
interior minister Surjadi Sudirdja as interim coordinating minister for security
and political affairs,'' Wahid said, as quoted by the Kompas newspaper.
</P>
<P>
	   Other Jakarta newspapers carried similar reports.
</P>
<P>
	   Wahid gave no explanation for his unexpected decision. The announcement was
made to reporters from the Indonesian media who had been called to the palace
around midnight Sunday, reporters said.
</P>
<P>
	   Several hours earlier, Wahid had held an impromptu news conference to
announce that he was keeping Wiranto -- who has refused numerous public and
private appeals from Wahid to resign -- in the government until the attorney
general finalized the new investigation of Wiranto's responsibility for the
events in East Timor.
</P>
<P>
	   On Monday morning, presidential spokesman Dharmawan Ronodipuro declined to
comment about the Kompas report but said that Cabinet secretary Marsilam
Simanjuntak would make a formal announcement later in the day.
</P>
<P>
	   Wiranto has been accused by separate Indonesian and U.N. human rights panels
of failing to prevent the East Timor violence in September as commander of the
country's armed forces.
</P>
<P>
	   Hundreds of people were killed and much of the province devastated in
attacks by anti-independence militants following East Timor's vote for
independence on Aug. 30. Indonesian soldiers have been accused of taking part in
some attacks and stepping back and allowing many others.
</P>
<P>
	   On Sunday afternoon, after meeting privately with Wiranto, Wahid told
reporters: ``I asked (Wiranto) to resign, but he said he preferred to be
investigated by law, and I said `Okay'.''
</P>
<P>
	   ``I have ... the right to change my ministers,'' he said. ``After he is
inspected by law, then I will exercise my prerogative.''
</P>
<P>
	   Wahid's trip abroad was to focus on encouraging investment in Indonesia's
moribund economy. But that goal was largely forgotten as the media focused on
the political duel, which sparked fears of a possible military coup in Jakarta.
</P>
<P>
	   U.N. Secretary General Kofi Annan, who met briefly on Saturday with Wahid on
the sidelines of a U.N. trade conference in Bangkok, Thailand, said he was
following ``very closely'' the discussions between Wahid and Wiranto.
</P>
<P>
	   Annan told a press conference in Bangkok on Sunday that he would have a
``long session'' with Wahid when he visits Indonesia this week.
</P>
<P>
	   Two weeks ago -- after Wahid left for Saudi Arabia on the first leg of his
tour -- a government-sponsored human rights probe into the crisis in East Timor
recommended Wiranto be investigated by state prosecutors.
</P>
<P>
	   Soon after the report was made public, Wahid announced he would suspend
Wiranto. But Wiranto defied calls to step down. He denied any wrongdoing, and
insisted he would present his case to the president in person.
</P>
<P>
	   The general was a protege of Suharto, who ruled Indonesia for 32 years until
he was ousted in 1988. Wiranto was given the post of security minister last
October when Wahid took office.
</P>
<P>
	   Since then, Wiranto's relations with the reformist leader have deteriorated
because of the security forces' inability to stem a rising wave of religious and
separatist violence throughout the island nation.
</P>
<P>
	   As well as targeting Wiranto, Wahid also has been taking on Suharto himself.
His administration reopened a corruption probe against the 78-year-old autocrat,
and state lawyers named him as a suspect over allegations that his family got
rich on billions of dollars channeled through charitable foundations he set up
and controlled.

<HEADLINE> Mazda Back on Comeback Trail  </HEADLINE>
    By YURI KAGEYAMA Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   TOKYO (AP) -- Things were so bad at Mazda Motor Co. four years ago that some
thought Ford Motor Co. was throwing away money by taking control of the Japanese
rival in its eagerness to extend its overseas reach.
</P>
<P>
	   Now, Mazda is posting profits after five years of losses, with earnings at
their highest since 1985. And the company is building an image of vigor and
confidence -- personified by its American president, Mark Fields, who at 39 is
the youngest executive ever to head a major automaker in Japan.
</P>
<P>
	   Fields, a former president at Ford's Argentine unit and a Harvard Business
School graduate, is seen as an asset for the company even though his youth bucks
Japanese corporate tradition.
</P>
<P>
	   Since succeeding James Miller, who stepped down for health reasons last
year, he has had no trouble standing out.
</P>
<P>
	   "Under Mr. Fields, Mazda is trying to market a stronger brand image," said
Shinji Kitayama, auto analyst at New Japan Securities Co.
</P>
<P>
	   Considered a marketing expert, Fields has promised to promote the Mazda
brand using new ways such as selling cars over the Internet. He is also expected
to strengthen the company's worker-training program to produce better managers.
</P>
<P>
	   "There's a lot of questions about my capability and my ability to lead. And
that's fair because that's the cultural interpretation," Fields recently told
reporters.
</P>
<P>
	   Japan is so dominated by rigid rules of seniority that the executives at the
nearly 2,500 companies listed on Japan's stock exchanges average 58.9 years old.
Only 18 presidents are under 40, according to Toyo Keizai, a publisher of
business almanacs.
</P>
<P>
	   But the break with tradition didn't start with Fields.
</P>
<P>
	   Mazda's road to recovery began in 1996, when Ford bought a controlling 33.4
percent stake and added Mazda to its global group -- which has since expanded to
include Volvo of Sweden and Jaguar of Britain.
</P>
<P>
	   Henry Wallace, a Scotsman, was named president -- an appointment that was
major news in Japan because he was the first foreigner to head a major Japanese
automaker.
</P>
<P>
	   The Ford-Mazda alliance also proved to be a taste of things to come in the
world auto industry, where international tie-ups have become almost commonplace.
</P>
<P>
	   In January, for instance, General Motors completed its outright acquisition
of Sweden's Saab Automobile and has a 20 percent stake in Subaru of Japan. Last
year, Renault of France bought a 36.8 percent stake in Japan's Nissan and named
Brazilian-born Carlos Ghosn as chief operating officer.
</P>
<P>
	   Tadahiko Takiguchi, a Mazda executive in charge of research and development,
considers the turnaround at the Hiroshima-based automaker remarkable.
</P>
<P>
	   "The Mazda brand was synonymous with being a loser," Takiguchi said,
recalling the poor sales during the hard times. "We learned how crucial a brand
can be. We learned we have to be proud of Mazda."
</P>
<P>
	   Takiguchi and other Mazda executives hope to grow as a distinctive brand
within the Ford group by building a reputation for producing sophisticated,
sporty cars.
</P>
<P>
	   Problems remain.
</P>
<P>
	   Mazda's heavy reliance on exports makes it vulnerable to currency
fluctuations that can send profits plunging if the yen rises. And it remains a
distant also-ran behind Toyota and Honda.
</P>
<P>
	   Like other automakers in Japan, Mazda must woo domestic consumers amid a
nearly decade-long slowdown in the nation's economy. Auto sales in Japan last
year were down 8 percent from the previous year, to 3.99 million vehicles -- the
third straight year of declines.
</P>
<P>
	   Still, Mazda is making some headway:
</P>
<P>
	   --It posted a profit of $121 million in the first half of the current fiscal
year, a 55 percent rise from the same period the previous year. Mazda returned
to profitability in fiscal 1998 for the first time since fiscal 1992.
</P>
<P>
	   --The company has cut its work force by 12 percent since 1995 to about
24,000 without resorting to mass layoffs.
</P>
<P>
	   --It has a program to promote women into upper management and will start
merit-based pay for all managers in April, both relatively novel policies for
Japan.
</P>
<P>
	   At the Los Angeles Auto Show last month, Mazda unveiled its Tribute sport
utility vehicle, the first model jointly developed by Mazda and Ford. The entry
in the fastest growing segment of the U.S. auto market should help Mazda boost
its market share there from last year's 1.4 percent.
</P>
<P>
	   Mazda's cooperation with Ford is a major cost advantage in sharing
technology as well as platforms, or the basic parts on which cars are built. The
Ford Escape has the same platform as the Tribute.

<HEADLINE> Mickelson Ends Woods Winning Streak  </HEADLINE>
    By DOUG FERGUSON AP Golf Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   SAN DIEGO (AP) -- The only thing more amazing than The Streak was the way it
ended -- another spectacular comeback, another stunning collapse.
</P>
<P>
	   Only this time, both belonged to Tiger Woods.
</P>
<P>
	   Woods erased a seven-shot deficit in a matter of seven holes, only to see
his hopes of a seventh straight PGA Tour victory disappear in the cool Pacific
air when he became a victim of his own mistakes and a gutsy revival by Phil
Mickelson.
</P>
<P>
	   The longest PGA Tour winning streak in 52 years ended Sunday in the Buick
Invitational, where Mickelson won for the first time in 18 months and left Byron
Nelson's record run of 11 straight victories as the standard.
</P>
<P>
	   "I didn't back off. I didn't dog it out there," Woods said. "I just hung in
there. For some reason didn't hit the ball as crisp today as I needed to."
</P>
<P>
	   In a final round packed with as much drama as a major championship,
Mickelson recovered from two double bogeys with back-to-back birdies, and went
on to a four-stroke victory over Woods and Shigeki Maruyama.
</P>
<P>
	   He closed with a 70 and finished at 18-under 270 for the 14th victory of his
career, worth a career-high $540,000.
</P>
<P>
	   Fighting his swing all day, Woods clawed his way into a tie with a birdie on
the par-5 13th, only to follow with bogeys on the next two holes. The result was
his first loss in a PGA Tour event since late August at the hands of his first
victim.
</P>
<P>
	   "I wasn't out to end the streak. I don't want to be the bad guy," said
Mickelson, who finished one stroke behind Woods in the NEC Invitational. "I just
wanted to win the tournament."
</P>
<P>
	   He did it with his best two shots of the week -- a 9-iron into 2 feet on No.
13 for birdie that restored his lead, and a wedge to 6 feet for birdie on the
next hole for a three-stroke margin that became too large even for Woods to
overcome.
</P>
<P>
	   "At least I made it interesting for Phil," Woods said.
</P>
<P>
	   Woods' great run ends at six, the same number won by Ben Hogan in 1948 but
still well short of the "untouchable" record that Nelson set in 1945.
</P>
<P>
	   It was only fitting that it was Mickelson who kept Nelson's record safe.
Down on his luck after shooting a 78 in the third round of the 1998 PGA
Championship, he called Lord Byron for some help with his game, and won at
rain-delayed Pebble Beach two days later.
</P>
<P>
	   What a way to return the favor.
</P>
<P>
	   "To go against the best player in the world and come out on top means a
lot," Mickelson said. "I know I can play against the best and win."
</P>
<P>
	   It took everything he could muster, in a town where he grew up, on a course
where he used to play three times a week in high school.
</P>
<P>
	   Woods was seven strokes down with 12 holes to play. Seven holes later, he
pointed at the cup as his ball fell to the bottom for a 5-foot birdie on the
13th hole that gave him a share of the lead at 15-under.
</P>
<P>
	   Mickelson, whose lead vanished with double bogeys on the seventh and 11th
holes, didn't need a scoreboard to tell him what was going on.
</P>
<P>
	   "I knew. Believe me, I knew," he said.
</P>
<P>
	   But instead of cowering at another onslaught by Woods, Mickelson responded.
</P>
<P>
	   His drive on the 13th was blocked to the left, in the rough and under a
eucalyptus tree, leaving him no chance to reach the green in two.
</P>
<P>
	   "I knew I needed to make 4," he said. "I just didn't know how."
</P>
<P>
	   With 116 yards to the pin, he hit a 9-iron that spun back to 2 feet for
birdie.
</P>
<P>
	   "After that, I was back in control of my game," he said.
</P>
<P>
	   And then Woods finally blinked. With only a 9-iron in his hand, he was 25
feet right of his target and three-putted for his first bogey in 44 holes.
Mickelson dropped a wedge into 6 feet for another birdie and command of the
tournament.
</P>
<P>
	   Woods bogeyed the next hole from the bunker, and a smile crept over his face
as if he knew the streak was finally over.
</P>
<P>
	   It was a heart-pumping end to a streak that captured the imagination of the
entire tour. And it did nothing to diminish the fact that Woods' dominance of
his generation may be greater than any other player's in golf history.
</P>
<P>
	   "It's disappointing I didn't win," Woods said. "I just wasn't hitting it
good enough to give myself a viable chance down the stretch, and it finally
caught up with me. To even be under par ... was kind of a miracle."
</P>
<P>
	   Woods hit only 10 greens in regulation and missed eight fairways, but he
still scraped together a 68, and he still gave Mickelson a major scare.
</P>
<P>
	   Maruyama had a 72 in his quest to become the first Japanese player since
Isao Aoki in 1983 to win on the PGA Tour.
</P>
<P>
	   Mickelson, who was tied for 134th in final-round scoring last year and only
two weeks ago blew a final-round lead in Phoenix with a 40, showed the kind of
courage that may help him win his first major championship down the road.
</P>
<P>
	   Don't be surprised if Woods is there waiting for him. While the streak is
over, Woods still has not finished worse than seventh in a stroke-play
tournament since the MCI Classic in April.
</P>
<P>
	   Woods has developed such a commanding presence on tour that he was asked on
the eve of the final round which players might make a run at him -- even though
he was six shots out of the lead.
</P>
<P>
	   A gallery that swelled to 35,000 -- unheard of for this tournament --
desperately wanted to be witness to another Woods comeback.
</P>
<P>
	   It looked early as though luck would be on Woods' side when his drive headed
left for the gallery, struck the leg of an aluminum beach chair and kicked out
in the fairway. From there, Woods laced an approach that landed 7 feet left of
the hole.
</P>
<P>
	   He made the putt and pumped his fist pretty hard for such a short putt,
especially one so early in the round. It was a clear sign that while Woods had
not been wrapped up in the Streak -- he had a high school pal on his bag this
week -- the fire to win burns every week.
</P>
<P>
	   Mickelson had plenty of fire, too, and played like a someone trying to
protect his home turf. He used to play the front nine of Torrey Pines South
three times a week when he was in high school, and he made it look easy.
</P>
<P>
	   After struggling to make three pars, Mickelson smoked his driver 318 yards
down the fourth fairway and his an approach that landed 12 feet past the hole
and spun back to 2 feet for birdie. A 10-foot birdie followed on the next hole,
and his 40-foot eagle putt on No. 6 just dropped below the hole for a tap-in
birdie.
</P>
<P>
	   That put him at 19-under, still seven strokes clear of Woods and four ahead
of a fading Maruyama.
</P>
<P>
	   No problem, right?
</P>
<P>
	   Mickelson was a 13-time winner on the PGA Tour, not a 28-year-old rookie
like Matt Gogel, who ballooned to a 40 on the back nine at Pebble last week that
gave Woods the help he needed to win his sixth in a row.
</P>
<P>
	   Just like that, however, the comfortable margin turned into a
throat-gripping finish.
</P>
<P>
	   From the seventh fairway, Mickelson hit a wild approach that landed just far
enough in front of a tree to restrict his swing. Double bogey.
</P>
<P>
	   On the par-3 11th, he missed the green and chunked his first chip so badly
it stayed in the rough. Double bogey.
</P>
<P>
	   After two par saves, Woods hit his approach into No. 12 to 3 feet for
birdie, then tied Mickelson for the lead with another birdie on No. 13. He
wasn't spectacular, but his presence alone was a factor.
</P>
<P>
	   As Davis Love III said earlier in the week, "Jack Nicklaus won a lot of golf
tournaments by having his name up there, not by how he played coming down the
stretch. Guys believe sometimes more in other people's game than their own."
</P>
<P>
	   Mickelson had every reason to believe in Woods. But the guy who has had
problems closing out tournaments finally believed more in himself.

apparently sunk to non-lethal levels Sunday after reaching the Danube. Before
that, however, it had devastated the river in Hungary and Serbia. The cyanide
spill originated in northwest Romania, near the border town of Oradea, where a

<HEADLINE> Indonesian General Suspended  </HEADLINE>
   By SLOBODAN LEKIC Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) -- In a surprise reversal, President Abdurrahman
Wahid suspended his powerful security minister, Gen. Wiranto, from the Cabinet
over his alleged role in last year's bloodshed in East Timor, newspapers
reported Monday.
</P>
<P>
	   Upon his return home Sunday following a 16-day overseas tour, Wahid met with
Wiranto and announced that the minister would remain part of the government
while the attorney general's office conducted a new formal inquiry into the
violence that followed East Timor's vote for independence.
</P>
<P>
	   But late Sunday night, the president -- who has been known to frequently
make strong statements on issues only to ignore them later or change his stance
-- told Indonesian reporters that Wiranto would be suspended from the Cabinet
during the new probe.
</P>
<P>
	   ``While waiting for the attorney general's special team to investigate Gen.
Wiranto, I have taken a decision to deactivate him from duty, and (appoint)
interior minister Surjadi Sudirdja as interim coordinating minister for security
and political affairs,'' Wahid said, as quoted by the Kompas newspaper.
</P>
<P>
	   Other Jakarta newspapers carried similar reports.
</P>
<P>
	   Wahid gave no explanation for his unexpected decision. The announcement was
made to reporters from the Indonesian media who had been called to the palace
around midnight Sunday, reporters said.
</P>
<P>
	   Several hours earlier, Wahid had held an impromptu news conference to
announce that he was keeping Wiranto -- who has refused numerous public and
private appeals from Wahid to resign -- in the government until the attorney
general finalized the new investigation of Wiranto's responsibility for the
events in East Timor.
</P>
<P>
	   On Monday morning, presidential spokesman Dharmawan Ronodipuro declined to
comment about the Kompas report but said that Cabinet secretary Marsilam
Simanjuntak would make a formal announcement later in the day.
</P>
<P>
	   Wiranto has been accused by separate Indonesian and U.N. human rights panels
of failing to prevent the East Timor violence in September as commander of the
country's armed forces.
</P>
<P>
	   Hundreds of people were killed and much of the province devastated in
attacks by anti-independence militants following East Timor's vote for
independence on Aug. 30. Indonesian soldiers have been accused of taking part in
some attacks and stepping back and allowing many others.
</P>
<P>
	   On Sunday afternoon, after meeting privately with Wiranto, Wahid told
reporters: ``I asked (Wiranto) to resign, but he said he preferred to be
investigated by law, and I said `Okay'.''
</P>
<P>
	   ``I have ... the right to change my ministers,'' he said. ``After he is
inspected by law, then I will exercise my prerogative.''
</P>
<P>
	   Wahid's trip abroad was intended to encourage investment in Indonesia's
moribund economy. But that goal was largely forgotten as the media focused on
the political duel, which sparked fears of a possible military coup in Jakarta.
</P>
<P>
	   U.N. Secretary General Kofi Annan, who met briefly Saturday with Wahid on
the sidelines of a U.N. trade conference in Bangkok, Thailand, said he was
following ``very closely'' the discussions between Wahid and Wiranto.
</P>
<P>
	   Annan told a press conference in Bangkok on Sunday that he would have a
``long session'' with Wahid when he visits Indonesia this week.
</P>
<P>
	   Two weeks ago -- after Wahid left for Saudi Arabia on the first leg of his
tour -- a government-sponsored human rights probe into the crisis in East Timor
recommended Wiranto be investigated by state prosecutors.
</P>
<P>
	   Soon after the report was made public, Wahid announced he would suspend
Wiranto. But Wiranto defied calls to step down. He denied any wrongdoing, and
insisted he would present his case to the president in person.
</P>
<P>
	   The general was a protege of Suharto, who ruled Indonesia for 32 years until
he was ousted in 1988. Wiranto was given the post of security minister last
October when Wahid took office.
</P>
<P>
	   Since then, Wiranto's relations with the reformist leader have deteriorated
because of the security forces' inability to stem a rising wave of religious and
separatist violence throughout the island nation.
</P>
<P>
	   As well as targeting Wiranto, Wahid also has been taking on Suharto himself.
His administration reopened a corruption probe against the 78-year-old autocrat,
and state lawyers named him as a suspect over allegations that his family got
rich on billions of dollars channeled through charitable foundations he set up
and controlled.

<HEADLINE> Mickelson Ends Woods Winning Streak  </HEADLINE>
    By DOUG FERGUSON AP Golf Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   SAN DIEGO (AP) -- The only thing more amazing than The Streak was the way it
ended -- another spectacular comeback, another stunning collapse.
</P>
<P>
	   Only this time, both belonged to Tiger Woods.
</P>
<P>
	   Woods erased a seven-shot deficit in a matter of seven holes, only to see
his hopes of a seventh straight PGA Tour victory disappear in the cool Pacific
air when he became a victim of his own mistakes and a gutsy revival by Phil
Mickelson.
</P>
<P>
	   The longest PGA Tour winning streak in 52 years ended Sunday in the Buick
Invitational, where Mickelson won for the first time in 18 months and left Byron
Nelson's record run of 11 straight victories as the standard.
</P>
<P>
	   "I didn't back off. I didn't dog it out there," Woods said. "I just hung in
there. For some reason I didn't hit the ball as crisp today as I needed to."
</P>
<P>
	   In a final round packed with as much drama as a major championship,
Mickelson recovered from two double bogeys with back-to-back birdies, and went
on to a four-stroke victory over Woods and Shigeki Maruyama.
</P>
<P>
	   He closed with a 70 and finished at 18-under 270 for the 14th victory of his
career, worth a career-high $540,000.
</P>
<P>
	   Fighting his swing all day, Woods clawed his way into a tie with a birdie on
the par-5 13th, only to follow with bogeys on the next two holes. The result was
his first loss in a PGA Tour event since late August at the hands of his first
victim.
</P>
<P>
	   "I wasn't out to end the streak. I don't want to be the bad guy," said
Mickelson, who finished one stroke behind Woods in the NEC Invitational. "I just
wanted to win the tournament."
</P>
<P>
	   He did it with his best two shots of the week -- a 9-iron into 2 feet on No.
13 for birdie that restored his lead, and a wedge to 6 feet for birdie on the
next hole for a three-stroke margin that became too large even for Woods to
overcome.
</P>
<P>
	   "At least I made it interesting for Phil," Woods said.
</P>
<P>
	   Woods' great run ends at six, the same number won by Ben Hogan in 1948 but
still well short of the "untouchable" record that Nelson set in 1945.
</P>
<P>
	   It was only fitting that it was Mickelson who kept Nelson's record safe.
Down on his luck after shooting a 78 in the third round of the 1998 PGA
Championship, he called Lord Byron for some help with his game, and won at
rain-delayed Pebble Beach two days later.
</P>
<P>
	   What a way to return the favor.
</P>
<P>
	   "To go against the best player in the world and come out on top means a
lot," Mickelson said. "I know I can play against the best and win."
</P>
<P>
	   It took everything he could muster, in a town where he grew up, on a Torrey
Pines course where he used to play three times a week in high school.
</P>
<P>
	   Woods was seven strokes down with 12 holes to play. Seven holes later, he
pointed at the cup as his ball fell to the bottom for a 5-foot birdie on the
13th hole that gave him a share of the lead at 15-under.
</P>
<P>
	   Mickelson, whose lead vanished with double bogeys on the seventh and 11th
holes, didn't need a scoreboard to tell him what was going on.
</P>
<P>
	   "I knew. Believe me, I knew," he said.
</P>
<P>
	   But instead of cowering at another onslaught by Woods, Mickelson responded.
</P>
<P>
	   His drive on the 13th was blocked to the left, in the rough and under a
eucalyptus tree, leaving him no chance to reach the green in two.
</P>
<P>
	   "I knew I needed to make 4," he said. "I just didn't know how."
</P>
<P>
	   With 116 yards to the pin, he hit a 9-iron that spun back to 2 feet for
birdie.
</P>
<P>
	   "After that, I was back in control of my game," he said.
</P>
<P>
	   And then Woods finally blinked. With only a 9-iron in his hand, he was 25
feet right of his target and three-putted for his first bogey in 44 holes.
Mickelson dropped a wedge into 6 feet for another birdie and command of the
tournament.
</P>
<P>
	   Woods bogeyed the next hole from the bunker, and a smile crept over his face
as if he knew the streak was finally over.
</P>
<P>
	   It was a heart-pumping end to a streak that captured the imagination of the
entire tour. And it did nothing to diminish the fact that Woods' dominance of
his generation may be greater than any other player's in golf history.
</P>
<P>
	   "It's disappointing I didn't win," Woods said. "I just wasn't hitting it
good enough to give myself a viable chance down the stretch, and it finally
caught up with me. To even be under par ... was kind of a miracle."
</P>
<P>
	   Woods hit only 10 greens in regulation and missed eight fairways, but he
still scraped together a 68, and he still gave Mickelson a major scare.
</P>
<P>
	   Maruyama had a 72 in his quest to become the first Japanese player since
Isao Aoki in 1983 to win on the PGA Tour.
</P>
<P>
	   Mickelson, who was tied for 134th in final-round scoring last year and only
two weeks ago blew a final-round lead in Phoenix with a 40 on the back nine,
showed the kind of courage that may help him win his first major championship
down the road.
</P>
<P>
	   Don't be surprised if Woods is there waiting for him. While the streak is
over, Woods still has not finished worse than seventh in a stroke-play
tournament since the MCI Classic in April.
</P>
<P>
	   Woods has developed such a commanding presence on tour that he was asked on
the eve of the final round which players might make a run at him -- even though
he was six shots out of the lead.
</P>
<P>
	   A gallery that swelled to 35,000 -- unheard of for this tournament --
desperately wanted to be witness to another Woods comeback.
</P>
<P>
	   It looked early as though luck would be on Woods' side when his drive headed
left for the gallery, struck the leg of an aluminum beach chair and kicked out
in the fairway. From there, Woods laced an approach that landed 7 feet left of
the hole.
</P>
<P>
	   He made the putt and pumped his fist pretty hard for such a short putt,
especially one so early in the round. It was a clear sign that while Woods had
not been wrapped up in the Streak -- he had a high school pal on his bag this
week -- the fire to win burns every week.
</P>
<P>
	   Mickelson had plenty of fire, too, and played like a someone trying to
protect his home turf.
</P>
<P>
	   After struggling to make three pars, Mickelson smoked his driver 318 yards
down the fourth fairway and his an approach that landed 12 feet past the hole
and spun back to 2 feet for birdie. A 10-foot birdie followed on the next hole,
and his 40-foot eagle putt on No. 6 just dropped below the hole for a tap-in
birdie.
</P>
<P>
	   That put him at 19-under, still seven strokes clear of Woods and four ahead
of a fading Maruyama.
</P>
<P>
	   No problem, right?
</P>
<P>
	   Mickelson was a 13-time winner on the PGA Tour, not a 28-year-old rookie
like Matt Gogel, who ballooned to a 40 on the back nine at Pebble last week that
gave Woods the help he needed to win his sixth in a row.
</P>
<P>
	   Just like that, however, the comfortable margin turned into a
throat-gripping finish.
</P>
<P>
	   From the seventh fairway, Mickelson hit a wild approach that landed just far
enough in front of a tree to restrict his swing. Double bogey.
</P>
<P>
	   On the par-3 11th, he missed the green and chunked his first chip so badly
it stayed in the rough. Double bogey.
</P>
<P>
	   After two par saves, Woods hit his approach into No. 12 to 3 feet for
birdie, then tied Mickelson for the lead with another birdie on No. 13. He
wasn't spectacular, but his presence alone was a factor.
</P>
<P>
	   As Davis Love III said earlier in the week, "Jack Nicklaus won a lot of golf
tournaments by having his name up there, not by how he played coming down the
stretch. Guys believe sometimes more in other people's game than their own."
</P>
<P>
	   Mickelson had every reason to believe in Woods. But the guy who has had
problems closing out tournaments finally believed more in himself.

<HEADLINE> Landry Leaves Legacy of Victories  </HEADLINE>
    By JAIME ARON AP Sports Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   DALLAS (AP) -- When Tom Landry was fired as coach of the Dallas Cowboys,
many people said there would never be anyone like him again. Eleven years later,
that seems truer than ever.
</P>
<P>
	   Landry's death Saturday night brought new reflection on his legacy. After
dusting off the old stories and statistics, his accomplishments are even more
impressive today.
</P>
<P>
	   It's difficult to imagine one person doing so much, so well for so long.
</P>
<P>
	   Landry was a winner.
</P>
<P>
	   His 270 victories are third most in NFL history. His teams reached five
Super Bowls, winning two. They had a winning record for 20 straight seasons.
</P>
<P>
	   It's also worth noting that two of his Super Bowl losses were to the
Pittsburgh Steelers during their Steel Curtain dynasty. The other was on a field
goal in the final seconds.
</P>
<P>
	   Landry was an innovator.
</P>
<P>
	   He revolutionized defenses by creating the 4-3 formation in 1956, then in
1961 came up with the multiple offense to counter it. Both remain standards in
all levels of football.
</P>
<P>
	   He continued tinkering with ideas and formations. He came up with things
like the "Flex" defense and the chorus line routine that had the offensive line
set, stand and reset.
</P>
<P>
	   He also borrowed from the business world. He took such notions as quality
control and definition of goals and adapted them to football. Those, too, remain
staples from high school through the NFL.
</P>
<P>
	   Landry knew how to persevere.
</P>
<P>
	   He lasted 29 seasons in the same job, an achievement in any field. In the
NFL, it's astounding.
</P>
<P>
	   His first team went 0-11-1, the NFL's worst record in 18 years. He didn't
have a winning record until the seventh year. Then critics said he couldn't win
the big one. The Cowboys became Super Bowl champions in their sixth playoff
season -- and again in their 11th.
</P>
<P>
	   To put his tenure in perspective, consider that the dean of current NFL
coaches is Pittsburgh's Bill Cowher, who is going into his ninth season. Another
good measuring stick is Tom Coughlin, the first and so far only coach of the
Jacksonville Jaguars, who would have to remain in place through 2023 to match
Landry.
</P>
<P>
	   Landry was a born leader.
</P>
<P>
	   He spent two years as a bomber pilot in World War II flying combat missions
in a B-17, the same plane his older brother died in.
</P>
<P>
	   While still a player with the New York Giants, Landry added the duties of
defensive assistant, a job that translates to defensive coordinator today.
</P>
<P>
	   His stoic sideline demeanor was a facade. Landry was an intense competitor,
but he taught himself to control his emotions because he knew he needed a clear
head to make snap decisions. He also was a deeply caring person who forced
himself not to get close to his players for fear it would interfere with
personnel decisions.
</P>
<P>
	   Even the fedora -- symbolic of him as the blue star is of the Cowboys -- was
calculated. It started as a way to stay warm. Then it stayed because it looked
good and fit Landry's plan to project a businesslike attitude.
</P>
<P>
	   Although conservative in manner, Landry managed to handle his share of
wayward players -- from hard-drinking free spirit Don Meredith to troubled Duane
Thomas to cocaine abuser Thomas "Hollywood" Henderson. That's worth remembering
when wondering whether Landry could coach today.
</P>
<P>
	   Landry was a superb judge of talent.
</P>
<P>
	   He's joined in the Pro Football Hall of Fame by five of the players he
drafted, from 1961 pick Bob Lilly to 1977 pick Tony Dorsett. The 1975 Cowboys,
the first wild-card team to reach the Super Bowl, included 12 rookies.
</P>
<P>
	   He also had a knack for surrounding himself with talented assistant coaches.
Dozens of aides went on to coach elsewhere in the NFL, including Dan Reeves and
Mike Ditka, both of whom played for Landry and eventually coached teams into
Super Bowls.
</P>
<P>
	   Landry was a model citizen.
</P>
<P>
	   He didn't smoke or drink or curse. He became a born-again Christian in 1959
and spent the next 40 years working with religious organizations, including the
Fellowship of Christian Athletes and Billy Graham's crusades.
</P>
<P>
	   Times have changed so much that it's probably not possible to have another
figure like Landry.
</P>
<P>
	   Ever since Dick Vermeil made burnout a football term in 1982, there seems to
be another victim of that professional hazard every year. And with coaches
getting seven-figure contracts, there's not much need to stick around as long.
</P>
<P>
	   Landry also was blessed to come along when pro football was still a game
more than a business.
</P>
<P>
	   Imagine an owner today giving a coach a 10-year extension instead of a pink
slip after going 13-38-3 four years into a five-year deal. That's what Clint
Murchison did for Landry.
</P>
<P>
	   He knew what Tom Landry meant. Not only to the Cowboys but all of football.

'Peanuts' Creator Schulz Dies
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
	   SANTA ROSA, Calif. (AP) -- "Peanuts" creator Charles Schulz surrendered to
cancer late last night at age 77, just as his last original cartoon was being
published in newspapers across the world. The signed farewell letter in today's
papers also ran when he ended his daily comic strip on Jan. 3. Schulz's contract
stipulated that no one else will ever draw the strip, which debuted Oct. 2,
1950, and reached an estimated 355 million readers daily in 75 countries. The
last strip shows Snoopy at his typewriter and other Peanuts regulars along with
a "Dear Friends" letter thanking his readers for their support.

	   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) -- President Abdurrahman Wahid suspended his
powerful security minister, Gen. Wiranto, from the Cabinet over his alleged role
in last year's bloodshed in East Timor, newspapers reported Monday. Wahid met
with Wiranto on Sunday and announced that the minister would remain part of the
government while the attorney general's office conducted a new formal inquiry
into the violence that followed East Timor's vote for independence. But late
Sunday night, the president -- who has been known to change his stance -- told
Indonesian reporters that Wiranto would be suspended from the Cabinet during the

NASA Tries To Understand Shuttle Problem

<P>
	   CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. (AP) -- NASA today struggled to understand a thruster
problem with space shuttle Endeavour that could cut short their mapping of the
world. A valve on the end of the 197-foot radar antenna mast jutting out the
craft's cargo bay was not providing thrust, despite a constant flow of nitrogen
gas, and engineers suspected a leak somewhere in the gas line. The problem did
not interfere with the crew's radar scanning or the quality of data being
collected for the most precise and complete 3-D map ever produced of the Earth.
More than 14 million square miles of terrain had been charted as of Sunday

and earned a career-high $540,000. "At least I made it interesting for Phil,"
Woods said.

<HEADLINE> West 137, East 126  </HEADLINE>
    By CHRIS SHERIDAN AP Basketball Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   OAKLAND, Calif. (AP) -- Vince Carter started things off with a dunk worthy
of a contest, Tim Duncan and Shaquille O'Neal played like MVPs and Karl Malone
got involved as little as possible.
</P>
<P>
	   In an All-Star game that was almost a microcosm of the first half of the
season, each star had a chance to show his specialty -- and most of them did.
</P>
<P>
	   Behind 24 points apiece from Duncan and Kevin Garnett, 22 from O'Neal and 14
assists from Jason Kidd, the West defeated the East 137-126 Sunday in the 49th
version of the league's showcase event.
</P>
<P>
	   This was the first All-Star game since 1998 because last year's was canceled
by the lockout, but the players hadn't forgotten how to play one of these games.
Heavy on the fancy stuff and short on fundamentals, the players put on as much
of a show as they could -- and Carter's portion of it happened right off the
bat.
</P>
<P>
	   The first basket for the East was an alley-oop dunk by Carter off a pass
from Allen Iverson, while the second bucket was a breakaway slam by Carter that
closely resembled one of his best from the dunk contest Saturday night.
</P>
<P>
	   Carter did a 360-degree spin to his right, rather than doing it the easy way
by spinning left, and dunked the ball with two hands.
</P>
<P>
	   The East tried to give Carter another spectacular dunk in the first minute,
but Grant Hill's alley-oop pass off the backboard was too hard. Later in the
quarter when Eddie Jones tried to zip a pass to Carter and Iverson deflected it
out of bounds, Jones grimaced at Iverson as if to say "It's him, not you."
</P>
<P>
	   Iverson led the East with 26 points and nine assists, while Ray Allen had 14
and Carter 12.
</P>
<P>
	   O'Neal and Duncan were named co-MVPs, the first time the award has been
shared since 1993.
</P>
<P>
	   O'Neal also had nine rebounds and three blocks, while Duncan had 14 rebounds
and four assists. Kobe Bryant added 15 for the West, while Michael Finley and
Kidd had 11 apiece.
</P>
<P>
	   Malone, who wasn't happy that the NBA threatened him with a five-game
suspension if he failed to show up, played just three minutes -- all in the
first half -- and missed his only shot.
</P>
<P>
	   East leads the series 31-18 but had its three-game winning streak snapped.
</P>
<P>
	   After the breakneck start keyed by Carter's dunks, the pace slowed early in
the second quarter as the reserves got their minutes. Allen and O'Neal injected
some life back into the game -- Allen with a Carteresque drive and dunk; O'Neal
by dribbling coast to coast for a layup and then following with a fast-break
slam and an alley-oop dunk off a pass from Kidd complete with a chin-up on the
rim.
</P>
<P>
	   Carter, who won the slam-dunk contest with a dominant performance Saturday
night, had a pedestrian dunk for the final basket of the first half, cutting the
East's deficit to 64-59.
</P>
<P>
	   The third quarter was showtime again, at least while the starters were in.
Kidd threw an alley-oop pass that banked in (he did not call glass), O'Neal did
a 360-degree slam of his own, cheating on the first 180 degrees (NBC microphones
caught him saying "it wasn't a 360, it was a 257"), and Bryant made a sky hook
reminiscent of something out of Kareem Abdul-Jabbar's repertoire.
</P>
<P>
	   The West started the fourth quarter with a 10-2 run, led by five points from
Finley, to go ahead 109-99, and the East never made a run the rest of the way.
</P>
<P>
	   Kidd came up with the final highlight play of the night with 2:48 left,
tossing an underhanded pass 18 feet up in the air that Bryant converted into an
alley-oop dunk.
</P>
<P>
	   Carter had a chance to close the game with a flourish, but a full-court pass
to him was thrown too far and he ended up trying to shoot the ball from behind
the backboard.

<P>
	   Berdais told The Canadian Press that a shipment of the mines -- he believed
fewer than 100 -- were taken on the same ship carrying Canada's main contingent
to the war-torn region last October.
</P>
<P>
	   He was not sure if they had been used.
</P>
<P>
	   The devices are permitted under a little-publicized loophole in the
international convention to ban land mines, championed by Foreign Affairs
Minister Lloyd Axworthy and the late Princess Diana.
</P>
<P>
	   Claymore mines are different from most land mines because they don't go off
indiscriminately when someone steps on them. They are detonated on command.

Schedules Normal at Dorval Airport
</P>
<P>
	   MONTREAL (AP) --Traffic returned to normal both inside and outside Dorval
airport Sunday following a fire that forced more than 1,000 travelers and
employees to evacuate the building.
</P>
<P>
	   Airlines were left to play catch-up in an effort to transport the frustrated
and confused passengers caught in the chaos, which lasted for more than five
hours Saturday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
	   About 90 flights were canceled or delayed during the incident, said
Jacqueline Richard, an airport spokeswoman.
</P>
<P>
	   On Sunday, only one flight was canceled because the incoming plane did not
arrive Saturday.
</P>
<P>
	   No injuries were reported as a result of the blaze, which began in a
second-floor office at Dorval, one of Canada's largest airports.
Victim's Mother Wants Canada Burial
</P>
<P>
	   TORONTO (AP) -- Eyes filled with tears, Shahida Jabeen vowed to fight to
have her daughter's remains buried in Canada. The girl was found butchered in a
Toronto park.
</P>
<P>
	   Jabeen will ask an Ontario court for the right to hold Farah Khan's funeral
in Toronto. The five-year-old's father and legal guardian -- who is accused in
her murder -- has denied her plea, saying the child should be buried in
Pakistan.
</P>
<P>
	   Speaking publicly about her ordeal for the first time since she arrived from
Pakistan on Friday, Jabeen sobbed and collapsed into her brother's arms at the
end of a news conference.
</P>
<P>
	   Jabeen said she wants Farah's funeral to be held here because Muslim
tradition states it should take place where the death occurred.
</P>
<P>
	   The child's father Muhammad Arsal Khan, 36, and his wife, Kaneez Fatima, 45,
were charged last month with first-degree murder.
</P>
<P>
	   Khan, who gained custody of Farah when she was an infant, brought her to
Canada last April to live with him and his new wife.

Environmentalist Gives Ludwig Credit
</P>
<P>
	   EDMONTON (AP) -- As oilpatch opponent Wiebo Ludwig's trial on
vandalism-related charges resumes Monday, some environmentalists give him part
of the credit for reforms brewing in Alberta's energy sector.
</P>
<P>
	   People have been concerned about emissions from oil- and gas-field
facilities for a long time, says veteran environmentalist Martha Kostuch.
</P>
<P>
	   ``People are becoming more aware that they're not alone and that they're not
nuts,'' says Kostuch, who's currently helping the Alberta Energy and Utilities
Board draft new regulations for sour gas plants.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Wiebo is part of that. Wiebo probably raised (those concerns) to a higher
level nationally. I think his issues are real.''
</P>
<P>
	   But while Greg Gilbertson of the Energy and Utilities Board acknowledges the
energy sector has come under greater scrutiny, he says it's not because of
Ludwig.
</P>
<P>
	   ``What influences the board is members of the public. It has nothing to do
with alleged criminal actions anywhere.''
</P>
<P>
	   Ludwig and his friend Richard Boonstra face 18 charges related to oilpatch
vandalism. Ludwig, the head of a 36-member eco-religious commune in northwestern
Alberta, blames emissions from the energy sector for a variety of human and
animal health problems at his farm, including the stillbirth of a grandson.

<HEADLINE> Alaska Airlines Grounds 8 Planes  </HEADLINE>
   By LEON DROUIN KEITH Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Eight Alaska Airlines jetliners remained grounded Sunday
with tail equipment problems that may be linked to the deadly crash of Flight
261. Other carriers said most of their planes were back in the air.
</P>
<P>
	   The Federal Aviation Administration last week ordered inspections of nearly
1,100 planes, focusing on the jackscrew, a 2-foot-long rod that drives the
horizontal stabilizer flaps in the tail that help keep the plane level.
</P>
<P>
	   Airlines had reported finding jackscrew problems in 22 planes by midday
Sunday. They were given until Monday to complete the checks of all MD-80 series,
MD-90s, DC-9s and Boeing 717s.
</P>
<P>
	   Two of Alaska Airlines' grounded planes have metal shavings around the
jackscrews, a problem FAA officials are most concerned about. The other six, and
many of the 14 planes from other airlines, have a gritty residue around the
jackscrews that may prove to be from normal wear.
</P>
<P>
	   Federal investigators have not yet determined whether the jackscrew on
Flight 261 played a role in the Jan. 31 crash that killed all 88 people aboard.
The jackscrew recovered from the crash site had damaged threads and metal
shavings, and the pilots of Flight 261 had reported stabilizer trouble before
the plane went down in the Pacific Ocean.
</P>
<P>
	   Airlines that found irregularities in jackscrews are replacing them and
examining the rods, and those jackscrews removed are being sent to a National
Transportation Safety Board lab for further examination, FAA spokesman Eliot
Brenner said.
</P>
<P>
	   ``There's a good chance some of what we're discovering is just normal
wear,'' Brenner said.
</P>
<P>
	   Northwest and Alaska had finished their inspections by Sunday morning, and
three others -- American, Delta and TWA -- had inspected about 90 percent of
their planes.
</P>
<P>
	   Brenner said Alaska Airlines may have a higher number of planes with
reported problems because the airline is being extremely cautious.
</P>
<P>
	   The FAA's order also increased the frequency of regular jackscrew
inspections from every eight months to about every three months.
</P>
<P>
	   FAA administrator Jane Garvey on Sunday responded to a U.S. News and World
Report article that said Flight 261's horizontal stabilizer was made in China,
and that quoted a spokesman for the International Association of Machinists and
Aerospace Workers as saying FAA oversight of foreign parts manufacturers is
inadequate.
</P>
<P>
	   Garvey said on CNN that the international organization that oversees
aviation manufacturing ``has some very high standards.'' But she added, ``I
think that's going to be an issue that the NTSB will look at and we may make
some changes.''
</P>
<P>
	   Boeing spokesman John Thom said Sunday that the manufacturer of the part
used on Flight 261 had not yet been determined.
</P>
<P>
	   No matter where the parts are built, they meet the same stringent
specifications, Thom said. ``We insist on that. We'd be stupid if we didn't.''
</P>
<P>
	   Wreckage from Flight 261 -- including a plane seat and surfboards carried
aboard the aircraft -- have washed up as far as 140 miles from the crash site,
San Luis Obispo County sheriff's Lt. Martin Basti said.

<HEADLINE> 'Peanuts' Creator Schulz Dies at 77  </HEADLINE>
   By MARY ANN LICKTEIG Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   SANTA ROSA, Calif. (AP) -- ``Peanuts'' creator Charles Schulz died at home
following a battle with cancer, just as the last original cartoon of his
half-century career was being published in newspapers worldwide.
</P>
<P>
	   The 77-year-old Schulz was diagnosed with colon cancer in November, and his
spirits recently sagged as he battled the disease and pondered retirement, said
Monte Schulz, his eldest son.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I think maybe he decided that his true passion was in the strip, and when
that was gone, it was over,'' Monte Schulz said Sunday. ``He had done what he
had wanted to do, and that was it for him ...''
</P>
<P>
	   The son said that while the cause of death Saturday wasn't known, ``it
appears he died in his sleep, almost between breaths.'' His wife, Jeannie, was
with him when he died.
</P>
<P>
	   On news of his passing, fans and colleagues across the country hailed Schulz
as an irreplaceable artist whose work over the years had become infused in
American popular culture.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I think 'Peanuts' has been for most of its existence the best comic strip
in history, and nothing's ever approached it,'' said Mell Lazarus, who draws the
``Momma'' and ``Miss Peach'' strips, and knew Schulz for 42 years. ``He's going
to be missed and will clearly never be replaced.''
</P>
<P>
	   The famous strip -- with its gentle humor spiked with a child's-eye view of
human foibles -- had one particularly endearing trait: constancy.
</P>
<P>
	   Year after year, the long-suffering Charlie Brown faced misfortune with a
mild, ``Good grief!'' Tart-tongued Lucy handed out advice at a nickel a pop. And
Snoopy, Charlie Brown's wise-but-weird beagle, still took the occasional flight
of fancy back to the skies of World War I and his rivalry with the Red Baron.
</P>
<P>
	   The strip was an intensely personal effort for Schulz. He had had a clause
in his contract dictating the strip had to end with his death -- no one could
imitate it.
</P>
<P>
	   While battling cancer, he opted to retire it, saying he wanted to focus on
his health and family without the worry of a daily deadline.
</P>
<P>
	   His last daily comic ran in early January, and the final farewell strip
appeared in newspapers on Sunday. Old versions of the strip will continue to be
published.
</P>
<P>
	   The last strip showed Snoopy at his typewriter and other Peanuts regulars
along with a ``Dear Friends'' letter thanking his readers for their support.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I have been grateful over the years for the loyalty of our editors and the
wonderful support and love expressed to me by fans of the comic strip,'' Schulz
wrote. ``Charlie Brown, Snoopy, Linus, Lucy ... how can I ever forget them ...''
</P>
<P>
	   It ended with his signature.
</P>
<P>
	   Fans of all ages mourned his passing.
</P>
<P>
	   In Santa Rosa, 8-year-old Trevor Jones offered a bouquet of flowers
decorated with a drawing of the city's ice skating rink, which Schulz built. The
drawing, delivered to the rink, read in a child's scrawl, ``I lik you.''
</P>
<P>
	   Ikue Kamasugi, 25, arrived from Tokyo Saturday night for the sole purpose of
reading the final ``Peanuts'' strip at the ice arena. Instead, she was mourning
-- and had not yet read the strip.
</P>
<P>
	   At the International Museum of Cartoon Art in Boca Raton, Fla., Schulz fans
who came to see an exhibit featuring his comics became mourners.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I said when they called me, 'It's not true,''' said a tearful Jeanne
Greever, the museum's director of operations.
</P>
<P>
	   Schulz was born in Minneapolis, Minn., on Nov. 26, 1922, and studied art
after he saw a ``Do you like to draw?'' ad.
</P>
<P>
	   He was drafted into the Army in 1943 and sent to the European theater,
although he saw little combat.
</P>
<P>
	   After the war, he did lettering for a church comic book, taught art and sold
cartoons to the Saturday Evening Post. His first feature, ``Li'l Folks,'' was
developed for the St. Paul Pioneer Press in 1947. In 1950, it was sold to a
syndicate and the named changed to Peanuts, even though, he recalled later, he
didn't much like the name.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Peanuts'' made its official debut on Oct. 2, 1950. The travails of the
``little round-headed kid'' and his pals eventually ran in more than 2,600
newspapers, reaching millions of readers in 75 countries.
</P>
<P>
	   Although he remained largely a private person, the strip brought Schulz
international fame. He won the Reuben Award, comic art's highest honor, in 1955
and 1964. In 1978, he was named International Cartoonist of the Year, an award
voted by 700 comic artists around the world.
</P>
<P>
	   The 1965 CBS-TV special ``A Charlie Brown Christmas'' won an Emmy and rerun
immortality, and many other specials followed.
</P>
<P>
	   There was a hit musical, ``You're a Good Man, Charlie Brown,'' with Gary
Burghoff, later Radar O'Reilly on ``M-A-S-H,'' playing Charlie. The book ``The
Gospel According to Peanuts'' explored the philosophical and religious
implications of the strip.
</P>
<P>
	   The characters also appeared on sheets, stationery and countless other
products. Schulz several times was listed as one of Forbes magazine's best-paid
entertainers, most recently in 1996, when his 1995-96 income was estiamted at
$33 million, ranking him No. 30 on the magazine's list.
</P>
<P>
	   Despite the success, Schulz struggled with depression and anxiety, according
to his biographer, Rheta Grimsley Johnson. But the struggle only improved his
work, she found, as he poured those feelings of rejection and uncertainty into
the strip and turned Charlie Brown into Everyman.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Rejection is his specialty, losing his area of expertise. He has spent a
lifetime perfecting failure,'' Johnson wrote in her 1989 book, ``Good Grief: The
Story of Charles M. Schulz.''
</P>
<P>
	   Schulz himself left little doubt about the strip's role in his life.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Why do musicians compose symphonies and poets write poems?'' he once said.
``They do it because life wouldn't have any meaning for them if they didn't.
That's why I draw cartoons. It's my life.''
</P>
<P>
	   A private funeral is scheduled for this week.

<HEADLINE> Japanese Trade Shrunk in 1999  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
    TOKYO (AP) -- Japan's broadest measure of trade shrank in 1999 for the first
time in three years as the strong yen depressed demand for Japanese products
overseas, the government announced Monday.
</P>
<P>
	   The current account surplus, measured before adjustment for seasonal
factors, fell 22.7 percent from 1998's record high to $111.9 billion, the
Finance Ministry said.
</P>
<P>
	   The current account measures trade in merchandise, services, tourism and
investment. It is calculated by determining the difference between Japan's
income from foreign sources against payments on foreign obligations. It excludes
net capital investment.
</P>
<P>
	   A huge surplus has been a constant source of friction with the United States
and other trading partners. They have been urging Japan to boost its economy to
stimulate imports. Japan is struggling to emerge from its worst economic
downturn in 50 years.
</P>
<P>
	   In 1998, Japan's trade surplus surged 38.7 percent to a record high of
$139.18 billion.
</P>
<P>
	   During 1999, however, the yen's 10 percent increase against the dollar made
Japanese products, such as steel and computers, more expensive in the United
States and Europe, thus hurting exports.
</P>
<P>
	   Higher oil prices also dented the surplus as Japan had to pay out more for
its energy imports.
</P>
<P>
	   The U.S. dollar started 1999 at 113.86 yen but ended weaker at 102.08 yen.
</P>
<P>
	   For the month of December, Japan's current account surplus fell a
greater-than-expected 39.9 percent from the year-earlier month to $7.99 billion,
the ministry said.
</P>
<P>
	   Economists surveyed by Dow Jones on average had forecast a surplus of $10.2
billion for the month.

<HEADLINE> Britain Plans for Asylum Seekers  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON (AP) -- Seventy-four asylum-seekers from a hijacked Afghan plane could
be dispersed to the United States, India, Pakistan and elsewhere under a new
plan being drafted by Britain, a foreign office spokesman said Monday.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We are in touch with a number of interested countries in case passengers
want to go there,'' the spokesman said on condition of anonymity.
</P>
<P>
	   The asylum-seekers were among the passengers aboard a hijacked Ariana
Airlines Boeing 727 jet diverted to Stansted airport, north of London, last
week. The plane was en route from Kabul to the northern city of Mazar-e-Sharif
when it was hijacked at gunpoint. The hijackers and the passengers left the
plane peacefully on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
	   Another 72 hijacked passengers left Britain early Monday on a flight bound
for Kandahar, Afghanistan, eight days after their ordeal began. Passengers were
to be greeted in Kandahar by representatives of the Geneva-based International
Organization for Migration, who will escort them back to their villages, news
reports said.
</P>
<P>
	   Nineteen people from the aircraft remained in British custody Monday in
connection with the hijacking. Essex police said the detained men were likely to
be charged with hijacking or air piracy, which carries a life sentence, as well
as possession of firearms.
</P>
<P>
	   For the 74 passengers who did not want to go home, British officials have
begun informal discussions with a number of countries with Afghan communities,
the spokesman said. Discussions were also underway with Uzbekistan, Kazakstan
and Russia.
</P>
<P>
	   The spokesman denied reports that Britain had offered to pay expenses to
countries who agreed to take the former hostages.

<HEADLINE> Mickelson Ends Woods Winning Streak  </HEADLINE>
    By DOUG FERGUSON AP Golf Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   SAN DIEGO (AP) -- The only thing more amazing than The Streak was the way it
ended -- another spectacular comeback, another stunning collapse.
</P>
<P>
	   Only this time, both belonged to Tiger Woods.
</P>
<P>
	   Woods erased a seven-shot deficit in a matter of seven holes, only to see
his hopes of a seventh straight PGA Tour victory disappear in the cool Pacific
air when he became a victim of his own mistakes and a gutsy revival by Phil
Mickelson.
</P>
<P>
	   The longest PGA Tour winning streak in 52 years ended Sunday in the Buick
Invitational, where Mickelson won for the first time in 18 months and left Byron
Nelson's record run of 11 straight victories as the standard.
</P>
<P>
	   "I didn't back off. I didn't dog it out there," Woods said. "I just hung in
there. For some reason I didn't hit the ball as crisp today as I needed to."
</P>
<P>
	   In a final round packed with as much drama as a major championship,
Mickelson recovered from two double bogeys with back-to-back birdies, and went
on to a four-stroke victory over Woods and Shigeki Maruyama.
</P>
<P>
	   He closed with a 70 and finished at 18-under 270 for the 14th victory of his
career, worth a career-high $540,000.
</P>
<P>
	   Fighting his swing all day, Woods clawed his way into a tie with a birdie on
the par-5 13th, only to follow with bogeys on two of the next three holes. The
result was his first loss in a PGA Tour event since late August at the hands of
his first victim.
</P>
<P>
	   "I wasn't out to end the streak. I don't want to be the bad guy," said
Mickelson, who finished one stroke behind Woods in the NEC Invitational. "I just
wanted to win the tournament."
</P>
<P>
	   He did it with his best two shots of the week -- a 9-iron into 2 feet on No.
13 for birdie that restored his lead, and a wedge to 6 feet for birdie on the
next hole for a three-stroke margin that became too large even for Woods to
overcome.
</P>
<P>
	   "At least I made it interesting for Phil," Woods said.
</P>
<P>
	   Woods' great run ends at six, the same number won by Ben Hogan in 1948 but
still well short of the "untouchable" record that Nelson set in 1945.
</P>
<P>
	   It was only fitting that it was Mickelson who kept Nelson's record safe.
Down on his luck after shooting a 78 in the third round of the 1998 PGA
Championship, he called Lord Byron for some help with his game, and won at
rain-delayed Pebble Beach two days later.
</P>
<P>
	   What a way to return the favor.
</P>
<P>
	   "To go against the best player in the world and come out on top means a
lot," Mickelson said. "I know I can play against the best and win."
</P>
<P>
	   It took everything he could muster, in a town where he grew up, on a Torrey
Pines course where he used to play three times a week in high school.
</P>
<P>
	   Woods was seven strokes down with 12 holes to play. Seven holes later, he
pointed at the cup as his ball fell to the bottom for a 5-foot birdie on the
13th hole that gave him a share of the lead at 15-under.
</P>
<P>
	   Mickelson, whose lead vanished with double bogeys on the seventh and 11th
holes, didn't need a scoreboard to tell him what was going on.
</P>
<P>
	   "I knew. Believe me, I knew," he said.
</P>
<P>
	   But instead of cowering at another onslaught by Woods, Mickelson responded.
</P>
<P>
	   His drive on the 13th was blocked to the left, in the rough and under a
eucalyptus tree, leaving him no chance to reach the green in two.
</P>
<P>
	   "I knew I needed to make 4," he said. "I just didn't know how."
</P>
<P>
	   With 116 yards to the pin, he hit a 9-iron that spun back to 2 feet for
birdie.
</P>
<P>
	   "After that, I was back in control of my game," he said.
</P>
<P>
	   And then Woods finally blinked. With only a 9-iron in his hand, he was 25
feet right of his target and three-putted for his first bogey in 44 holes.
Mickelson dropped a wedge into 6 feet for another birdie and command of the
tournament.
</P>
<P>
	   Woods bogeyed the 16th hole from the bunker, and a smile crept over his face
as if he knew the streak was finally over.
</P>
<P>
	   It was a heart-pumping end to a streak that captured the imagination of the
entire tour. And it did nothing to diminish the fact that Woods' dominance of
his generation may be greater than any other player's in golf history.
</P>
<P>
	   "It's disappointing I didn't win," Woods said. "I just wasn't hitting it
good enough to give myself a viable chance down the stretch, and it finally
caught up with me. To even be under par ... was kind of a miracle."
</P>
<P>
	   Woods hit only 10 greens in regulation and missed eight fairways, but he
still scraped together a 68, and he still gave Mickelson a major scare.
</P>
<P>
	   Maruyama had a 72 in his quest to become the first Japanese player since
Isao Aoki in 1983 to win on the PGA Tour.
</P>
<P>
	   Mickelson, who was tied for 134th in final-round scoring last year and only
two weeks ago blew a final-round lead in Phoenix with a 40 on the back nine,
showed the kind of courage that may help him win his first major championship
down the road.
</P>
<P>
	   Don't be surprised if Woods is there waiting for him. While the streak is
over, Woods still has not finished worse than seventh in a stroke-play
tournament since the MCI Classic in April.
</P>
<P>
	   Woods has developed such a commanding presence on tour that he was asked on
the eve of the final round which players might make a run at him -- even though
he was six shots out of the lead.
</P>
<P>
	   A gallery that swelled to 35,000 -- unheard of for this tournament --
desperately wanted to be witness to another Woods comeback.
</P>
<P>
	   It looked early as though luck would be on Woods' side when his drive headed
left for the gallery, struck the leg of an aluminum beach chair and kicked out
in the fairway. From there, Woods laced an approach that landed 7 feet left of
the hole.
</P>
<P>
	   He made the putt and pumped his fist pretty hard for such a short putt,
especially one so early in the round. It was a clear sign that while Woods had
not been wrapped up in the Streak -- he had a high school pal on his bag this
week -- the fire to win burns every week.
</P>
<P>
	   Mickelson had plenty of fire, too, and played like a someone trying to
protect his home turf.
</P>
<P>
	   After struggling to make three pars, Mickelson smoked his driver 318 yards
down the fourth fairway and his an approach that landed 12 feet past the hole
and spun back to 2 feet for birdie. A 10-foot birdie followed on the next hole,
and his 40-foot eagle putt on No. 6 just dropped below the hole for a tap-in
birdie.
</P>
<P>
	   That put him at 19-under, still seven strokes clear of Woods and four ahead
of a fading Maruyama.
</P>
<P>
	   No problem, right?
</P>
<P>
	   Mickelson was a 13-time winner on the PGA Tour, not a 28-year-old rookie
like Matt Gogel, who ballooned to a 40 on the back nine at Pebble last week that
gave Woods the help he needed to win his sixth in a row.
</P>
<P>
	   Just like that, however, the comfortable margin turned into a
throat-gripping finish.
</P>
<P>
	   From the seventh fairway, Mickelson hit a wild approach that landed just far
enough in front of a tree to restrict his swing. Double bogey.
</P>
<P>
	   On the par-3 11th, he missed the green and chunked his first chip so badly
it stayed in the rough. Double bogey.
</P>
<P>
	   After two par saves, Woods hit his approach into No. 12 to 3 feet for
birdie, then tied Mickelson for the lead with another birdie on No. 13. He
wasn't spectacular, but his presence alone was a factor.
</P>
<P>
	   As Davis Love III said earlier in the week, "Jack Nicklaus won a lot of golf
tournaments by having his name up there, not by how he played coming down the
stretch. Guys believe sometimes more in other people's game than their own."
</P>
<P>
	   Mickelson had every reason to believe in Woods. But the guy who has had
problems closing out tournaments finally believed more in himself.

<HEADLINE> West 137, East 126  </HEADLINE>
    By CHRIS SHERIDAN AP Basketball Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   OAKLAND, Calif. (AP) -- Vince Carter started things off with a dunk worthy
of a contest, Tim Duncan and Shaquille O'Neal played like MVPs and Karl Malone
got involved as little as possible.
</P>
<P>
	   In an All-Star game that was almost a microcosm of the first half of the
season, each star had a chance to show his specialty -- and most of them did.
</P>
<P>
	   Behind 24 points apiece from Duncan and Kevin Garnett, 22 from O'Neal and 14
assists from Jason Kidd, the West defeated the East 137-126 Sunday in the 49th
version of the league's showcase event.
</P>
<P>
	   This was the first All-Star game since 1998 because last year's was canceled
by the lockout, but the players hadn't forgotten how to play one of these games.
Heavy on the fancy stuff and short on fundamentals, the players put on as much
of a show as they could -- and Carter's portion of it happened right off the
bat.
</P>
<P>
	   The first basket for the East was an alley-oop dunk by Carter off a pass
from Allen Iverson, while the second bucket was a breakaway slam by Carter that
closely resembled one of his best from the dunk contest Saturday night.
</P>
<P>
	   Carter did a 360-degree spin to his right, rather than doing it the easy way
by spinning left, and dunked the ball with two hands.
</P>
<P>
	   The East tried to give Carter another spectacular dunk in the first minute,
but Grant Hill's alley-oop pass off the backboard was too hard. Later in the
quarter when Eddie Jones tried to zip a pass to Carter and Iverson deflected it
out of bounds, Jones grimaced at Iverson as if to say "It's him, not you."
</P>
<P>
	   Iverson led the East with 26 points and nine assists, while Ray Allen had 14
and Carter 12.
</P>
<P>
	   O'Neal and Duncan were named co-MVPs, the first time the award has been
shared since 1993.
</P>
<P>
	   O'Neal also had nine rebounds and three blocks, while Duncan had 14 rebounds
and four assists. Kobe Bryant added 15 for the West, while Michael Finley and
Kidd had 11 apiece.
</P>
<P>
	   Malone, who wasn't happy that the NBA threatened him with a five-game
suspension if he failed to show up, played just three minutes -- all in the
first half -- and missed his only shot.
</P>
<P>
	   East leads the series 31-18 but had its three-game winning streak snapped.
</P>
<P>
	   After the breakneck start keyed by Carter's dunks, the pace slowed early in
the second quarter as the reserves got their minutes. Allen and O'Neal injected
some life back into the game -- Allen with a Carteresque drive and dunk; O'Neal
by dribbling coast to coast for a layup and then following with a fast-break
slam and an alley-oop dunk off a pass from Kidd complete with a chin-up on the
rim.
</P>
<P>
	   Carter, who won the slam-dunk contest with a dominant performance Saturday
night, had a pedestrian dunk for the final basket of the first half, cutting the
East's deficit to 64-59.
</P>
<P>
	   The third quarter was showtime again, at least while the starters were in.
Kidd threw an alley-oop pass that banked in (he did not call glass), O'Neal did
a 360-degree slam of his own, cheating on the first 180 degrees (NBC microphones
caught him saying "it wasn't a 360, it was a 257"), and Bryant made a sky hook
reminiscent of something out of Kareem Abdul-Jabbar's repertoire.
</P>
<P>
	   The West started the fourth quarter with a 10-2 run, led by five points from
Finley, to go ahead 109-99, and the East never made a run the rest of the way.
</P>
<P>
	   Kidd came up with the final highlight play of the night with 2:48 left,
tossing an underhanded pass 18 feet up in the air that Bryant converted into an
alley-oop dunk.
</P>
<P>
	   Carter had a chance to close the game with a flourish, but a full-court pass
to him was thrown too far and he ended up trying to shoot the ball from behind
the backboard.

<HEADLINE> Iverson, Allen Jittery at All-Stars  </HEADLINE>
    By ROB GLOSTER AP Sports Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   OAKLAND, Calif. (AP) -- They are two of the NBA's most talented young
offensive stars, fearless and feared on the court. Yet first-time All-Stars
Allen Iverson and Ray Allen admitted they were scared stiff in Sunday's game.
</P>
<P>
	   "I was sitting up all night, I couldn't go to sleep. I've never been as
nervous in a game before in my life. My first game in the NBA, I know I wasn't
this nervous," said Iverson, an Eastern Conference starter.
</P>
<P>
	   "It's the environment. You don't get to play in front of Magic Johnson and
Bill Russell every night."
</P>
<P>
	   Iverson, of the Philadelphia 76ers, seemed to overcome his case of nerves
pretty well. He scored 26 points and had nine assists, some of them spectacular,
as his East team lost 137-126 to the West.
</P>
<P>
	   Allen also seemed to cope well after some early nervousness. The Milwaukee
Bucks guard had 14 points, though he went just 4-of-13 from the field and made
just one of his six 3-pointers.
</P>
<P>
	   "It was fun. I was sitting there, nervous, on the bench," he said. "When I
got in the game, I said, 'Reggie (Miller), are you rushing your 3's? It's almost
like you're a kid in a candy store. You get the ball and you want to do
something with it."
</P>
<P>
	   ------
</P>
<P>
	   GRANT'S FOCUS: Detroit's Grant Hill played the fewest minutes of any
All-Star starter Sunday, and had the fewest points of any starter. He scored
seven points and had five assists in 19 minutes.
</P>
<P>
	   But those numbers are remarkable, considering that he could hardly see what
was happening on the court.
</P>
<P>
	   Hill lost the contact lens from his right eye in warmups before the game,
and didn't have a backup set of lenses. Detroit's trainer usually carries an
extra set, but he was not at the All-Star Game.
</P>
<P>
	   "It popped out before the game. I couldn't see anything," he said.
"Everything was blurry."
</P>
<P>
	   ------
</P>
<P>
	   ROOTING FROM THE BENCH: Phoenix's Jason Kidd, who grew up in Oakland and
played his college ball at California in nearby Berkeley, got one of the loudest
ovations during pre-game introductions of the All-Star lineups.
</P>
<P>
	   A starter for the Western Conference squad, Kidd saved his applause for
teammates Karl Malone and John Stockton as the two Utah Jazz players executed
one of their trademark pick and roll plays.
</P>
<P>
	   Kidd was caught by a courtside microphone marveling at the Utah duo.
</P>
<P>
	   "You know it's coming, but you can't stop it," Kidd said to West teammates.
</P>
<P>
	   ------
</P>
<P>
	   TIGER WATCH: Before the game, the television in the Western Conference
locker room was tuned to the Buick Invitational as Tiger Woods was making up a
seven-stroke deficit only to fall back and lose by four strokes to Phil
Mickelson.
</P>
<P>
	   Someone made the observation that with everyone at All-Star weekend talking
about which player would be the next Michael Jordan, maybe they were looking at
the wrong sport.
</P>
<P>
	   "If that is Michael Jordan, he's going to have a heck of a golfing career,"
Jason Kidd said. "He's been on a heck of a run. A lead is never safe with Tiger
out there. He's getting that reputation, and it all starts with winning. That's
what he's doing."
</P>
<P>
	   ------
</P>
<P>
	   HOT STUFF: The NBA was hoping excitement on the court would make All-Star
fans forget about the miserable weather outside. Since the start of the All-Star
weekend, there had been nearly non-stop rain in the San Francisco Bay area.
</P>
<P>
	   But perhaps the folks operating the giant scoreboard outside the Oakland
Coliseum Arena were a bit too optimistic. As fans arrived at the game, the
scoreboard flashed: "At 2:47 p.m., it's 150 degrees."
</P>
<P>
	   ------
</P>
<P>
	   MOST OVERRATED?: Fans chose the starters for the All-Star Game and coaches
picked the reserves. The San Jose Mercury News decided to poll the All-Stars
themselves about their peers, and got some interesting answers.
</P>
<P>
	   In a completely unscientific poll that got responses from only about 20
percent of the players, the newspaper asked several questions that fans often
debate.
</P>
<P>
	   Such as: "Who is the most overrated player in the league?"
</P>
<P>
	   There was a tie for first on that one, with Penny Hardaway of the Phoenix
Suns and Washington's Juwan Howard getting five votes apiece. Kobe Bryant of the
Lakers and Sacramento's Jason Williams were right behind, with four votes each.
</P>
<P>
	   Among other results of the survey:
</P>
<P>
	   -- Cedric Ceballos of Dallas and Toni Kukoc of the Bulls tied for the
distinction of being the NBA's worst defender.
</P>
<P>
	   -- Indiana's Reggie Miller was a runaway winner as the best pure shooter,
and Allen Iverson had 36 votes -- compared to four for his nearest challenger --
in the "best 1-on-1 move" category.
</P>
<P>
	   -- And the most underrated player was Shareef Abdur-Rahim of Vancouver.
</P>
<P>
	   ------
</P>
<P>
	   STAR WATCH: Among the non-NBA luminaries sighted at the game: Brandi
Chastain, the star of last summer's Women's World Cup; presidential candidate
(and former NBA star) Bill Bradley; former heavyweight champion Evander
Holyfield; actor Peter Boyle; singer Natalie Cole, and celebrity lawyer Johnnie
Cochran.

<HEADLINE> Islanders 4, Rangers 2  </HEADLINE>
    By IRA PODELL AP Sports Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   NEW YORK (AP) -- Linemates Jorgen Jonsson and Mariusz Czerkawski combined
for five points as the New York Islanders beat the New York Rangers 4-2 Sunday
night.
</P>
<P>
	   Jonsson, who had three assists, has nine points in three games, one goal and
eight assists. The Islanders, with the second lowest point total in the NHL with
39, matched a season high with their third straight victory.
</P>
<P>
	   Czerkawski had two assists and extended his point-scoring streak to a career
best 10 games.
</P>
<P>
	   The Islanders, who got 31 saves from Kevin Weekes, rebounded from a pair of
one-goal deficits and a controversial Rangers score in gaining their 16th
victory.
</P>
<P>
	   They scored three times in the second period and grabbed the lead with 3:40
left in the frame.
</P>
<P>
	   Jonsson skated around Valeri Kamensky down low and fed Mathieu Biron, who
beat Mike Richter from the right side of the net for his fourth goal to make it
3-2.
</P>
<P>
	   Claude Lapointe scored his 11th goal with 43.8 seconds left into an empty
net.
</P>
<P>
	   The Rangers took a 1-0 lead in the opening period, on a perfectly executed
3-on-2 by the Czechmates line, when Jan Hlavac scored his 14th goal.
</P>
<P>
	   Radek Dvorak raced down right wing and moved the puck to Petr Nedved above
the circles. Nedved carried down low and backhanded a pass to Hlavac, who
steered it into the open left side of the net at 7:37.
</P>
<P>
	   Hlavac, who had his first career hat trick Friday night and then became a
father on Saturday, has five goals and an assist in five games against the
Islanders.
</P>
<P>
	   The Islanders tied it 4:18 into the second on Jason Krog's first NHL goal.
Czerkawski slid the puck to Jonsson while being dragged down. Jonsson got the
puck across to Krog, who scored into the upper left corner.
</P>
<P>
	   But the Rangers struck back after just 2:58 passed. Late on a power play,
the game and penalty clocks failed to start after a faceoff. The Rangers got 14
extra seconds with a man advantage before the problem was noticed.
</P>
<P>
	   As a result, Gino Odjick was just getting out of the penalty box and back
into play when Stephane Quintal fired a shot from the point that Weekes kicked
out. The rebound came right to Dvorak, who netted his 13th goal.
</P>
<P>
	   Islanders coach Butch Goring slammed a stick against the boards to alert the
officials of the problem. The goal was allowed to stand and the 14 seconds were
then deducted.
</P>
<P>
	   The Islanders weren't fazed and tied it 1:04 later. Jonsson won a faceoff
and the puck came back to Jamie Heward at the left point. Richter stopped
Heward's drive, but Josh Green converted the rebound for his ninth goal.
</P>
<P>
	   The Rangers were without Tim Taylor and lost Theo Fleury midway through the
second period because of the flu.
</P>
<P>
	   Islanders defenseman Eric Cairns was suspended for the game because of a
hallway fight Saturday with Pittsburgh's Matthew Barnaby.
</P>
<P>
	   The teams split the five-game season series 2-2-1. The Islanders hold a
78-76-17 advantage in 28 seasons.

<HEADLINE> Malone Ends All-Star Holdout  </HEADLINE>
    By DENNIS GEORGATOS AP Sports Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   OAKLAND, Calif. (AP) -- Karl Malone ended his All-Star holdout and then
wondered what all the fuss was about.
</P>
<P>
	   The Utah Jazz star complained his desire for a weekend getaway with his
family was twisted into three-day soap opera pitting him against everyone from
league managers to the NBA's younger generation players.
</P>
<P>
	   "I have no battles to fight," Malone said Sunday.
</P>
<P>
	   Malone, a two-time league MVP and 12-time All-Star, arrived hours before the
league's showcase at the Oakland Coliseum Arena.
</P>
<P>
	   He insisted the test of wills between him and NBA rulers and his distaste
for the way the league is promoting its rising stars over more established
veterans had nothing to do with his absence from most of the weekend activities.
</P>
<P>
	   "I'm here. I'm going to play. I'm fine," said Malone, whose initial attempt
to get out of his All-Star obligations by claiming he had a sore back was
rebuffed by league management. "I just want to go in and break a little sweat."
</P>
<P>
	   He barely did that, playing just three minutes and going scoreless in the
first half and watching from the end of the bench for the rest of the game, won
by the Western Conference 137-126 over the East.
</P>
<P>
	   "That was fine," Malone said. "I've been nursing some injuries. I talked to
coach (Phil Jackson) right before the game and he said you can play as much as
you want or as little as you want. And that's what I wanted to play. I talked to
the guys on the bench and I enjoyed myself. I knew I would once I got here."
</P>
<P>
	   Jackson said he honored Malone's request to play sparingly.
</P>
<P>
	   "He said, 'I don't know if I'm capable of more than 4-5 minutes. I just need
to make the appearance,"' Jackson said. "So we pulled him."
</P>
<P>
	   Malone, whose Jazz played their last game Wednesday before the All-Star
break, said he and his wife and children spent time on their Arkansas ranch and
he also went to Louisiana to see his teen-age son and daughter from a previous
relationship play basketball.
</P>
<P>
	   "And I wouldn't change a thing," Malone said. "I don't know what the big
deal is. It's kind of amazing. We as pro athletes are criticized when you don't
do things with your kids or spend time with your family and I was trying to do
that. It was a great opportunity for me to see my kids play and spend time with
my kids. But I'm here now."
</P>
<P>
	   Malone said he didn't watch any of All-Star Saturday's events, including the
slam dunk contest won by budding superstar Vince Carter, who epitomizes the
league's rising stars.
</P>
<P>
	   Malone added he learned Sunday he had been fined for missing Friday's
mandatory media session but said he didn't care.
</P>
<P>
	   "If I'm going to get fined so I can see my kids, I'll take that," he said,
adding later, "You know what? I wouldn't change a thing."
</P>
<P>
	   The league also had threatened additional fines and a possible five-game
suspension if Malone blew off the whole All-Star weekend.
</P>
<P>
	   Utah teammate John Stockton, a member of the Western Conference all-stars,
said he was relieved Malone showed up not only to bolster the elite squad to
prevent what would be a damaging blow to the Jazz if Malone was suspended.
</P>
<P>
	   "I'm just glad he's here," Stockton said. "He's a good friend and it's good
to share this event with him. I'm just glad this is over and he's here playing."
</P>
<P>
	   Malone never indicated in the days before the All-Star game whether he would
show up. He declined to say if he thought the league might have handled the
matter with a softer touch if he had been more definitive with his plans.
</P>
<P>
	   He also declined to discuss his feelings toward NBA management.
</P>
<P>
	   "I'm going to do a book one day and it will be in there," he said. "Right
now, I don't want to talk about it. I'm still playing."
</P>
<P>
	   As for his past complaints about the younger generation's "disrespect" for
the game, Malone insisted it was overblown and certainly had nothing to do with
his pre-game All-Star absence.
</P>
<P>
	   "Everybody wants to portray me like I'm jealous of the younger guys," Malone
said. "I made my mark in this league and I continue to try to do my own little
thing. There's no ill feelings at all because this changing of the guard, so to
speak, is going to happen to everybody whether it's Karl Malone or whoever. I
have no grudges."

Britain Plans for Asylum Seekers

	   LONDON (AP) -- Seventy-four asylum-seekers from a hijacked Afghan plane
could be dispersed to the United States, India, Pakistan and elsewhere under a
new plan being drafted by Britain, a foreign office spokesman said Monday,
speaking on condition of anonymity. The asylum-seekers were among the passengers
aboard a hijacked Ariana Airlines Boeing 727 jet diverted to Stansted airport,
north of London, last week. The plane was en route from Kabul to the northern
city of Mazar-e-Sharif when it was hijacked at gunpoint. The hijackers and the
passengers left the plane peacefully on Thursday.

Wiranto on Sunday and announced that the minister would remain part of the
government while the attorney general's office conducted a new formal inquiry
into the violence that followed East Timor's vote for independence. But late
Sunday night, the president -- who has been known to change his stance -- told

suffered a series of small strokes during emergency surgery in November 1999,
and announced his retirement a few weeks afterward. "Nobody thought he was too

Spacecraft Approaching Asteroid
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
	   LAUREL, Md. (AP) -- A robot craft that missed its mark a year ago is on
target for a Valentine's Day rendezvous with an asteroid named for the Greek god

asteroid Eros slowly and is expected to slip into orbit around the
mountain-sized space rock at midmorning tomorrow. If successful, NEAR will
become the first spacecraft to orbit an asteroid. Researchers hope data compiled
about Eros could one day help humans defend the Earth against a "killer
asteroid" like one thought to have wiped out the dinosaurs 65 million years ago.

West Beats East 137-126
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
	   OAKLAND, Calif. (AP) -- Vince Carter started things off with a dunk worthy
of a contest, Tim Duncan and Shaquille O'Neal played like MVPs and Karl Malone
got involved as little as possible. In an All-Star game that was almost a
microcosm of the first half of the season, each star had a chance to show his
specialty -- and most of them did. Behind 24 points apiece from Duncan and Kevin
Garnett, 22 from O'Neal and 14 assists from Jason Kidd, the West defeated the
East 137-126 Sunday in the 49th version of the league's showcase event.

<P>
	   DURHAM, N.C. (AP) -- Thomas A. Langford, a former provost of Duke University
and a scholar of religion, died of heart failure Sunday. He was 70.
</P>
<P>
	   From 1991-94, Langford was Duke's provost, the top academic position on
campus. During his tenure, Duke launched new initiatives to recruit black
educators and students and to hone the teaching skills of faculty and graduate
student instructors.
</P>
<P>
	   Langford, an ordained United Methodist minister, received attention for his
scholarship on British theology and philosophical theology before becoming dean
of the Duke Divinity School in 1971. He received a bachelor's degree from the
divinity school and also earned a doctorate from Duke before joining the faculty
in 1956. He retired as a divinity school professor in 1997 but continued writing
on Methodist theology.
Ed Linn
</P>
<P>
	   SAN DIEGO (AP) -- Ed Linn, who worked with baseball owner Bill Veeck on
three books and covered the Jack Ruby trial for The Saturday Evening Post, died
of cancer on Feb. 7. He was 77.
</P>
<P>
	   Linn was working on a book about the Ruby trial at the time of his death.
</P>
<P>
	   He graduated from Boston University in 1950 with a bachelor's degree in
journalism and went on to submit pieces to the Post, Life, Look and sports
magazines.
</P>
<P>
	   But he was best known for collaborating with Veeck on ``Veeck -- As In
Wreck,'' ``The Hustler's Handbook,'' and ``Thirty Tons A Day.''
</P>
<P>
	   Among his first assignments, Linn landed an interview with baseball's Ted
Williams, who was known to brush off reporters, said his son, David Linn.
</P>
<P>
	   A native of Boston, Linn grew up interested in sports. But he also wrote
profiles and covered politics. He also collaborated with the infamous bank
robber Willie Sutton on his autobiography, ``Where the Money Was.''
</P>
<P>
	   His other books include ``Out of the Fire,'' ``Inside the Yankees: The
Championship Season,'' ``Steinbrenner's Yankees,'' and ``The Great Rivalry.''
</P>
<P>
	   Besides his son, survivors include his wife, a daughter, a sister, and two
grandsons.
Charles Schulz
</P>
<P>
	   SANTA ROSA, Calif. (AP) -- ``Peanuts'' creator Charles Schulz died Saturday
following a battle with cancer, just as the last original cartoon of his
half-century career was being published in newspapers worldwide. He was 77.
</P>
<P>
	   Schulz was diagnosed with colon cancer in November, and his spirits recently
sagged as he battled the disease and pondered retirement, said Monte Schulz, his
eldest son.
</P>
<P>
	   The famous strip -- with its gentle humor spiked with a child's-eye view of
human foibles -- had one particularly endearing trait: constancy.
</P>
<P>
	   Year after year, the long-suffering Charlie Brown faced misfortune with a
mild, ``Good grief!'' Tart-tongued Lucy handed out advice at a nickel a pop. And
Snoopy, Charlie Brown's wise-but-weird beagle, still took the occasional flight
of fancy back to the skies of World War I and his rivalry with the Red Baron.
</P>
<P>
	   The strip was an intensely personal effort for Schulz. He had had a clause
in his contract dictating the strip had to end with his death -- no one could
imitate it.
</P>
<P>
	   While battling cancer, he opted to retire it, saying he wanted to focus on
his health and family without the worry of a daily deadline.
</P>
<P>
	   His last daily comic ran in early January, and the final farewell strip
appeared in newspapers on Sunday. Old versions of the strip will continue to be
published.
</P>
<P>
	   The last strip showed Snoopy at his typewriter and other Peanuts regulars
along with a ``Dear Friends'' letter thanking his readers for their support.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I have been grateful over the years for the loyalty of our editors and the
wonderful support and love expressed to me by fans of the comic strip,'' Schulz
wrote. ``Charlie Brown, Snoopy, Linus, Lucy ... how can I ever forget them ...''
</P>
<P>
	   It ended with his signature.
Thomas Sullivan
</P>
<P>
	   NEW ORLEANS (AP) -- Thomas Joseph Sullivan, a retired Navy commander who
oversaw all military sea-lifts in Vietnam, died Thursday of a heart attack. He
was 69.
</P>
<P>
	   Sullivan served as first lieutenant aboard the USS Gatling, executive
officer aboard the USS Luiseno, navigator and operations officer of the USS
Pawcatuck, commanding officer of the USS Penobscot, executive officer aboard the
USS Higbee and chief staff officer of commander, Destroyer Squadron 13.
</P>
<P>
	   He was commanding officer of the Naval Personnel Program Support Activity in
Washington and commanding officer of all military sea-lift activities in Vietnam
until the departure of the U.S. presence in 1973. A sea-lift is a movement of
troops and equipment by sea.

<HEADLINE> 'Peanuts' Creator Schulz Dies at 77  </HEADLINE>
   By MARY ANN LICKTEIG Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   SANTA ROSA, Calif. (AP) -- ``Peanuts'' creator Charles Schulz died at home
following a battle with cancer, just as the last original cartoon of his
half-century career was being published in newspapers worldwide.
</P>
<P>
	   The 77-year-old Schulz was diagnosed with colon cancer in November, and his
spirits recently sagged as he battled the disease and pondered retirement, said
Monte Schulz, his eldest son.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I think maybe he decided that his true passion was in the strip, and when
that was gone, it was over,'' Monte Schulz said Sunday. ``He had done what he
had wanted to do, and that was it for him ...''
</P>
<P>
	   The son said that while the cause of death Saturday wasn't known, ``it
appears he died in his sleep, almost between breaths.'' His wife, Jeannie, was
with him when he died.
</P>
<P>
	   On news of his passing, fans and colleagues across the country hailed Schulz
as an irreplaceable artist whose work over the years had become infused in
American popular culture.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I think 'Peanuts' has been for most of its existence the best comic strip
in history, and nothing's ever approached it,'' said Mell Lazarus, who draws the
``Momma'' and ``Miss Peach'' strips, and knew Schulz for 42 years. ``He's going
to be missed and will clearly never be replaced.''
</P>
<P>
	   The famous strip -- with its gentle humor spiked with a child's-eye view of
human foibles -- had one particularly endearing trait: constancy.
</P>
<P>
	   Year after year, the long-suffering Charlie Brown faced misfortune with a
mild, ``Good grief!'' Tart-tongued Lucy handed out advice at a nickel a pop. And
Snoopy, Charlie Brown's wise-but-weird beagle, still took the occasional flight
of fancy back to the skies of World War I and his rivalry with the Red Baron.
</P>
<P>
	   The strip was an intensely personal effort for Schulz. He had had a clause
in his contract dictating the strip had to end with his death -- no one could
imitate it.
</P>
<P>
	   While battling cancer, he opted to retire it, saying he wanted to focus on
his health and family without the worry of a daily deadline.
</P>
<P>
	   His last daily comic ran in early January, and the final farewell strip
appeared in newspapers on Sunday. Old versions of the strip will continue to be
published.
</P>
<P>
	   The last strip showed Snoopy at his typewriter and other Peanuts regulars
along with a ``Dear Friends'' letter thanking his readers for their support.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I have been grateful over the years for the loyalty of our editors and the
wonderful support and love expressed to me by fans of the comic strip,'' Schulz
wrote. ``Charlie Brown, Snoopy, Linus, Lucy ... how can I ever forget them ...''
</P>
<P>
	   It ended with his signature.
</P>
<P>
	   Fans of all ages mourned his passing.
</P>
<P>
	   In Santa Rosa, 8-year-old Trevor Jones offered a bouquet of flowers
decorated with a drawing of the city's ice skating rink, which Schulz built. The
drawing, delivered to the rink, read in a child's scrawl, ``I lik you.''
</P>
<P>
	   Ikue Kamasugi, 25, arrived from Tokyo Saturday night for the sole purpose of
reading the final ``Peanuts'' strip at the ice arena. Instead, she was mourning
-- and had not yet read the strip.
</P>
<P>
	   At the International Museum of Cartoon Art in Boca Raton, Fla., Schulz fans
who came to see an exhibit featuring his comics became mourners.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I said when they called me, 'It's not true,''' said a tearful Jeanne
Greever, the museum's director of operations.
</P>
<P>
	   Schulz was born in Minneapolis on Nov. 26, 1922, and was raised in St. Paul.
He studied art after he saw a ``Do you like to draw?'' ad.
</P>
<P>
	   He was drafted into the Army in 1943 and sent to the European theater,
although he saw little combat.
</P>
<P>
	   After the war, he did lettering for a church comic book, taught art and sold
cartoons to the Saturday Evening Post. His first feature, ``Li'l Folks,'' was
developed for the St. Paul Pioneer Press in 1947. In 1950, it was sold to a
syndicate and the named changed to Peanuts, even though, he recalled later, he
didn't much like the name.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Peanuts'' made its official debut on Oct. 2, 1950. The travails of the
``little round-headed kid'' and his pals eventually ran in more than 2,600
newspapers, reaching millions of readers in 75 countries.
</P>
<P>
	   Although he remained largely a private person, the strip brought Schulz
international fame. He won the Reuben Award, comic art's highest honor, in 1955
and 1964. In 1978, he was named International Cartoonist of the Year, an award
voted by 700 comic artists around the world.
</P>
<P>
	   The 1965 CBS-TV special ``A Charlie Brown Christmas'' won an Emmy and rerun
immortality, and many other specials followed.
</P>
<P>
	   There was a hit musical, ``You're a Good Man, Charlie Brown,'' with Gary
Burghoff, later Radar O'Reilly on ``M-A-S-H,'' playing Charlie. The book ``The
Gospel According to Peanuts'' explored the philosophical and religious
implications of the strip.
</P>
<P>
	   The characters also appeared on sheets, stationery and countless other
products. Schulz several times was listed as one of Forbes magazine's best-paid
entertainers, most recently in 1996, when his 1995-96 income was estiamted at
$33 million, ranking him No. 30 on the magazine's list.
</P>
<P>
	   Despite the success, Schulz struggled with depression and anxiety, according
to his biographer, Rheta Grimsley Johnson. But the struggle only improved his
work, she found, as he poured those feelings of rejection and uncertainty into
the strip and turned Charlie Brown into Everyman.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Rejection is his specialty, losing his area of expertise. He has spent a
lifetime perfecting failure,'' Johnson wrote in her 1989 book, ``Good Grief: The
Story of Charles M. Schulz.''
</P>
<P>
	   Schulz himself left little doubt about the strip's role in his life.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Why do musicians compose symphonies and poets write poems?'' he once said.
``They do it because life wouldn't have any meaning for them if they didn't.
That's why I draw cartoons. It's my life.''
</P>
<P>
	   A private funeral is scheduled for this week.

<P>
    LONG BEACH, Calif. (AP) -- Stacy Clinesmith scored the final six points of
the game, all from the free-throw line, to lead No. 12 UC Santa Barbara to a
73-63 victory over Long Beach State on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
	   It was the 17th straight win for the Gauchos (21-3, 9-0 Big West).
</P>
<P>
	   The Gauchos held a 67-63 lead with 46 seconds left to play in the game.

<HEADLINE> No. 10 Indiana 86, Michigan 65  </HEADLINE>
    By HARRY ATKINS AP Sports Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   ANN ARBOR, Mich. (AP) -- Start fast, finish strong. Indiana coach Bob Knight
told his team that was the best way to beat Michigan.
</P>
<P>
	   The Hoosiers clearly were paying attention.
</P>
<P>
	   Strong first-half shooting by Kirk Haston and Michael Lewis, coupled with
tight defense, helped No. 10 Indiana cruise to an 86-65 win over the Wolverines
on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
	   "It was absolutely imperative that we get started out well," Knight said.
</P>
<P>
	   Haston scored 10 of his 19 points in the first half and Lewis had 11 of his
15 as the Hoosiers (18-4, 8-3 Big Ten) opened a 16-point halftime lead. A.J.
Guyton led Indiana with 23 points, all but seven in the second half.
</P>
<P>
	   "Kirk Haston is as good a post player as anyone in the league, and they play
off him," Michigan coach Brian Ellerbe said.
</P>
<P>
	   The Hoosiers, coming off a 77-75 loss at Minnesota on Feb. 9, kept their
hopes alive for at least a share of the Big Ten regular season championship.
They can assure themselves at least a tie for the title by winning their last
five games.
</P>
<P>
	   "I think we lost a big game Wednesday night," Knight said. "I thought these
were two games we had to win to set up the last part of our season.
</P>
<P>
	   "I think this was our most important game all year because it gives us a
chance to play (for the title)."
</P>
<P>
	   With filmmaker Spike Lee sitting behind the Michigan bench in a maize and
blue T-shirt, freshman LaVell Blanchard scored 23 points and Chris Young had a
career-high 12 for the Wolverines (12-9, 3-7). But the Wolverines turned the
ball over 18 times on the way to their sixth straight defeat.
</P>
<P>
	   "We made some mental mistakes at the very beginning," Blanchard said. "But
coach settled us down for a little while."
</P>
<P>
	   Michigan freshman Kevin Gaines, playing without backcourt mate Jamal
Crawford, was held scoreless on 0-for-15 shooting. Gaines had been averaging
12.2 points per game.
</P>
<P>
	   Crawford, the Wolverines' leading scorer, was suspended for six games by the
NCAA because of his living arrangements while in high school. He will miss two
more games before he can return Feb. 24 against Purdue.
</P>
<P>
	   "We've got a little bit of the season left," Blanchard said. "It's rough to
go through a stretch like this. But all we can do is go out and play as hard as
we can."
</P>
<P>
	   The Hoosiers, who beat Michigan by 35 points in Bloomington on Jan. 25, took
charge right from the start of this game.
</P>
<P>
	   With baskets by Jeffrey Newton, Lewis and Dane Fife, plus a pair of free
throws by Haston, the Hoosiers broke to an 8-0 lead and never trailed.
</P>
<P>
	   "We played against a very good basketball team and I think our team got a
little bit frustrated," Ellerbe said. "We weren't very patient and the start was
disheartening."
</P>
<P>
	   Successive baskets by Brandon Smith helped Michigan cut the deficit to 20-15
midway through the half. But a jumper in the paint by Fife, followed by two
baskets by Lynn Washington, helped the Hoosiers respond with an 11-2 run for a
26-17 lead with 8:04 left in the half.
</P>
<P>
	   Two free throws by Guyton gave Indiana its biggest lead of the half, 42-25,
with just under a minute left in the half. Blanchard had a three-point play with
35.6 remaining and the Hoosiers led 44-28 at halftime.
</P>
<P>
	   The Wolverines chipped away behind the shooting of Blanchard and Young in
the second half. Two free throws by Young capped a 9-3 burst that closed the gap
to 62-48 with 9:22 left.
</P>
<P>
	   Six straight points by Washington gave the Hoosiers another 20-point lead,
72-52, with 5:22 remaining and both teams began substituting.

<HEADLINE> Shaq, Duncan Share All-Star MVP  </HEADLINE>
    By RICK GANO AP Sports Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   OAKLAND, Calif. (AP) -- Shaq showed his power and glimpses of finesse, too.
And Tim Duncan was his usual long-armed presence in the middle with great touch,
reaching above the pack for inside baskets and stuffs.
</P>
<P>
	   Who was more important for the West in its 137-126 All-Star victory over the
East on Sunday? It was a tossup, so much so that Shaquille O'Neal and Duncan
shared the MVP award in the 49th game.
</P>
<P>
	   "Shaq's a force to deal with night in and night out," Duncan said of his
co-winner.
</P>
<P>
	   "You don't see many MVP guys who can go inside and outside," O'Neal said,
returning the praise.
</P>
<P>
	   It marked just the third time in All-Star history there had been a co-MVP
and first since 1993 when Utah teammates Karl Malone and John Stockton shared
the award following the game at Salt Lake City.
</P>
<P>
	   In 1959, Elgin Baylor of Minneapolis and Bob Pettit of St. Louis were
co-winners.
</P>
<P>
	   O'Neal didn't even play the fourth quarter because he had a sore shoulder.
Before he left, he showed the versatility and the brute strength that on many
nights makes him unstoppable .
</P>
<P>
	   He dribbled coast-to-coast for a finger roll layin in the first half, he
banked in short jumpers and he drove down numerous dunks -- one after he got
alone for a 360-degree spin-and-stuff that the public address announcer summed
up as "Shaq slam."
</P>
<P>
	   "I told Kobe (Bryant) if I got a break, I'd do something nasty. I was going
to windmill but my shoulder gave out, so I just did a little 360," O'Neal said.
</P>
<P>
	   And on his ball-handling exhibition from one end to the other?
</P>
<P>
	   "I saw an opening. I just took a couple of dribbles with long strides and
laid it up," said the 7-foot-1, 315-pound O'Neal.
</P>
<P>
	   Duncan's steady play that led the Spurs to their first title last year was
evident all day as he hit 12-of-14 shots.
</P>
<P>
	   His most pronounced dunk came in the final minutes after the West had pulled
away when he took a nifty blind pass from Kevin Garnett and drove the ball down
with his left hand, punctuating the victory.
</P>
<P>
	   "Kevin just made a great pass to me. I went up and Zo (Alonzo Mourning) was
there and the ball just went down for me," Duncan said.
</P>
<P>
	   "This is the kind of game where you have to get out and run and know the
ball is coming. You have to keep your hands up."
</P>
<P>
	   O'Neal, finished with 22 points and nine rebounds. Duncan had 24 points and
grabbed 14 rebounds, seven on the offensive end.
</P>
<P>
	   "It was our size against their quickness," Duncan said. "On this day size
won."
</P>
<P>
	   O'Neal said he enjoyed his seventh NBA All-Star game and not just because he
shared an MVP award.
</P>
<P>
	   "Watching Vince Carter win the slam dunk contest. I've never seen anybody do
stuff like that," O'Neal said.
</P>
<P>
	   "Now that I've become a veteran, I rested a little more and I took in some
of the festivities. When I was younger, all I did was party, party, party."

<HEADLINE> Corps Accused of Distorting Study  </HEADLINE>
   By MIKE BRANOM Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   DES MOINES, Iowa (AP) -- The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers distorted the
economic impact of a $1 billion river project so it would win congressional
approval, an economist said in an affidavit filed Sunday.
</P>
<P>
	   Donald Sweeney's 44-page affidavit, filed with the U.S. Government's Office
of Special Counsel in Washington, accuses the corps of altering a $50 million
study of whether expanding locks on the Mississippi and Illinois rivers to speed
barge traffic would be economically justified.
</P>
<P>
	   The Office of Special Counsel is an independent agency that supervises
investigations of wrongdoing exposed by federal employees.
</P>
<P>
	   The affidavit and several accompanying memos from corps officials were
posted Sunday on the Web site of Environmental Defense, a national
environmentalist group.
</P>
<P>
	   Ron Fournier, spokesman for the corps' district office in Rock Island, Ill.,
said the corps won't comment on Sweeney's specific allegations until officials
see the affidavit.
</P>
<P>
	   ``If he's claiming there's dirty deeds done, that's totally untrue,''
Fournier said Sunday. ``The study has been above board ever since its
inception.''
</P>
<P>
	   Sweeney's affidavit claims that in the spring of 1998, he and other
economists working for the corps concluded that expensive measures were not
justified, regardless of environmental impacts.
</P>
<P>
	   According to the affidavit, after the recommendation was made, Sweeney was
replaced with a panel of economists.
</P>
<P>
	   An internal memo following a briefing to Maj. Gen. Russell Fuhrman, the
corps' second-ranking official, instructed Sweeney's replacement to, if existing
analysis did not justify expensive improvements, ''... figure out some other way
to do it.''
</P>
<P>
	   The study of the 43 locks and 37 dams along the Mississippi and Illinois
rivers between Minneapolis, Minn., and Cairo, Ill., is expected to be finished
by December.
</P>
<P>
	   Last June, the corps released forecasts that traffic along that stretch
could nearly double from the current 80 million tons a year to 155 million tons
a year by 2050.
</P>
<P>
	   According to the U.S. Department of Agriculture, 1.4 billion bushels of
grain was shipped on the Mississippi from January through mid-October last year,
22 percent higher than during the same period a year earlier.
</P>
<P>
	   Many barge operators along the Upper Mississippi have pressed the corps for
years to take measures to speed the movement of grain through the river's locks
and dams. They say the existing 600-foot-long locks are too short to accommodate
today's typical 1,100-foot-long convoys of 15 barges.
</P>
<P>
	   Except at the two busiest locks, both near St. Louis, barge operators must
de-couple the barges and take two trips through each lock, increasing the
typical one-hour wait to several hours.
</P>
<P>
	   Sweeney and his panel concluded that total delays of even a day or two on
the two-week trip from Minneapolis to New Orleans did not justify a major
expenditure.
</P>
<P>
	   The Midwest Area River Coalition 2000, an industry group, has pushed since
1992 for the corps to reduce congestion on the Mississippi. Its president,
Christopher Brescia, said the group considers it ``critical'' that the Corps
enlarge at least five Mississippi locks and two on the Illinois waterway that
flows into the Mississippi.

<HEADLINE> Md. Commuter Train Hits Barrier  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   LINTHICUM, Md. (AP) -- A light rail commuter train arriving at
Baltimore-Washington International Airport hit a safety barrier at the end of
the line Sunday, injuring the train operator and many of the 22 passengers, a
transit official said.
</P>
<P>
	   Maryland Mass Transit Authority spokesman Frank Fulton said the injured were
transported to several area hospitals.
</P>
<P>
	   One person was in serious condition Sunday night at the University of
Maryland Shock Trauma Center. Six people had been transported by ambulance, said
Chief Wayne Cook of the BWI fire and rescue squad. He said the train operator
suffered minor injuries.
</P>
<P>
	   The one-car train originated at Baltimore's Penn Station and normally would
have been traveling about 13 miles per hour as it neared the end its trip about
2:45 p.m., Fulton said.
</P>
<P>
	   Investigators were trying to determine how fast it was moving when it hit
the barrier.
</P>
<P>
	   Witnesses said they heard the train's brakes screeching just before the
crash. The impact crumpled the front end of the car and derailed it, but the car
train remained upright in the airport train station.

<HEADLINE> West 137, East 126  </HEADLINE>
    By CHRIS SHERIDAN AP Basketball Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   OAKLAND, Calif. (AP) -- A couple nifty dunks from Vince Carter, a little
Showtime from the Lakers, a few bank shots from Tim Duncan and plenty of crisp
passes from Jason Kidd.
</P>
<P>
	   Everybody did what they do best Sunday in the NBA All-Star game, with no
single player stealing the spotlight.
</P>
<P>
	   In a way, it was a fitting first All-Star game of the post-Jordan era:
Nobody is sure who the next superstar is, and none burst forward in this game.
</P>
<P>
	   Behind 24 points apiece from Duncan and Kevin Garnett, 22 from Shaquille
O'Neal and 14 assists from Kidd, the West defeated the East 137-126 Sunday in
the 49th version of the league's showcase event.
</P>
<P>
	   "The league is like a stock," Garnett said. "'You've got to give it a chance
to recover from the lockout, and it's going to keep rising and rising."
</P>
<P>
	   In this case, that meant appreciating the current players for their own
special skills instead of lamenting the lack of a single selfish showman.
</P>
<P>
	   Carter started things off with a dunk worthy of a contest, Duncan and O'Neal
played like MVPs, which they were, and Karl Malone got as little involved as
possible -- as he wished.
</P>
<P>
	   "What was the favorite part?" O'Neal asked rhetorically. "Watching Vince
dunk, of course. I've never seen anybody who dunks like that."
</P>
<P>
	   This was the first All-Star game since 1998 because last year's was canceled
by the lockout, but the players hadn't forgotten how to play one of these games.
</P>
<P>
	   Heavy on the fancy stuff and short on fundamentals, the players put on as
much of a show as they could -- and Carter's portion of it happened right off
the bat.
</P>
<P>
	   The first basket for the East was an alley-oop dunk by Carter off a pass
from Allen Iverson, while the second was a breakaway slam by Carter that closely
resembled one of his best from the dunk contest Saturday night.
</P>
<P>
	   Carter did a 360-degree spin to his right, rather than doing it the easy way
by spinning left, and dunked the ball with two hands.
</P>
<P>
	   The East tried to give Carter another spectacular dunk in the first minute,
but Grant Hill's alley-oop pass off the backboard was too hard. Later in the
quarter when Eddie Jones tried to zip a pass to Carter and Iverson deflected it
out of bounds, Jones grimaced at Iverson as if to say "It's him, not you."
</P>
<P>
	   Iverson led the East with 26 points and nine assists, while Ray Allen had 14
and Carter 12.
</P>
<P>
	   O'Neal and Duncan were named co-MVPs, the first time the award has been
shared since 1993.
</P>
<P>
	   "This award is nice, but I'm trying to get the big-picture award. Tim has
the big picture award," O'Neal said.
</P>
<P>
	   O'Neal also had nine rebounds and three blocks, while Duncan shot 12-for-14
and had 14 rebounds and four assists. Kobe Bryant added 15 for the West, while
Michael Finley and Kidd had 11 apiece.
</P>
<P>
	   "Everybody shared," Finley said.
</P>
<P>
	   Malone, who wasn't happy that the NBA threatened him with a five-game
suspension if he failed to show up, played just three minutes -- all in the
first half -- and missed his only shot.
</P>
<P>
	   "I talked to the coach before the game and he said I could play as much or
as little as I wanted to," Malone said. "All I wanted to get was a little time
to break a sweat, so the minutes I played were fine."
</P>
<P>
	   The East leads the series 31-18 but had its three-game winning streak
snapped.
</P>
<P>
	   After the breakneck start keyed by Carter's dunks, the pace slowed early in
the second quarter as the reserves got their minutes. Allen and O'Neal injected
some life back into the game -- Allen with a Carteresque drive and dunk; O'Neal
by dribbling coast to coast for a layup and then following with a fast-break
slam and an alley-oop dunk off a pass from Kidd complete with a chin-up on the
rim.
</P>
<P>
	   "Any time you're in a game like this it's a free-for-all, so you let it all
go," Allen said. "It's that type of game."
</P>
<P>
	   Carter, who won the slam-dunk contest with a dominant performance Saturday
night, had a pedestrian dunk for the final basket of the first half, cutting the
East's deficit to 64-59.
</P>
<P>
	   The third quarter was showtime again, at least while the starters were in.
Kidd threw an alley-oop pass that banked in (he did not call glass), O'Neal did
a 360-degree slam of his own, cheating on the first 180 degrees (NBC microphones
caught him saying "it wasn't a 360, it was a 257"), and Bryant made a sky hook
reminiscent of something out of Kareem Abdul-Jabbar's repertoire.
</P>
<P>
	   The West started the fourth quarter with a 10-2 run, led by five points from
Finley, to go ahead 109-99, and the East never made a run the rest of the way.
</P>
<P>
	   Kidd came up with the final highlight play of the night with 2:48 left,
tossing an underhanded pass 18 feet up in the air that Bryant converted into an
alley-oop dunk.
</P>
<P>
	   Carter had a chance to close the game with a flourish, but a full-court pass
to him was thrown too far and he ended up trying to shoot the ball from behind
the backboard.

<HEADLINE> Indonesia's Gen. Wiranto Suspended  </HEADLINE>
   By SLOBODAN LEKIC Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) -- In a surprise reversal, President Abdurrahman
Wahid suspended his powerful security minister, Gen. Wiranto, from the Cabinet
over his alleged role in last year's bloodshed in East Timor.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The president made the new decision by himself last night for the sake of
the government's stability and the interests of Gen. Wiranto to allow him to
concentrate on the investigation to be conducted by the attorney general's
special team,'' Cabinet secretary Marsilam Simanjuntak said.
</P>
<P>
	   Upon his return home Sunday following a 16-day overseas tour, Wahid met with
Wiranto and announced that the minister would remain part of the government
while the attorney general's office conducted a new formal inquiry into the
violence that followed East Timor's vote for independence.
</P>
<P>
	   But late Sunday night, the president -- who has been known to frequently
make strong statements on issues only to ignore them later or change his stance
-- told Indonesian reporters that Wiranto would be suspended from the Cabinet
during the new probe.
</P>
<P>
	   Wahid insisted he had not flip-flopped on the issue.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I didn't change my mind,'' Wahid commented to reporters after the
spokesman's statement. ``Yesterday I said there would be an investigation of him
and after that he is going to resign.''
</P>
<P>
	   Wiranto has been accused by separate Indonesian and U.N. human rights panels
of failing to prevent the East Timor violence in September as commander of the
country's armed forces.
</P>
<P>
	   Hundreds of people were killed and much of the province devastated in
attacks by anti-independence militants following East Timor's vote for
independence on Aug. 30. Indonesian soldiers have been accused of taking part in
some attacks and stepping back and allowing many others.
</P>
<P>
	   Wahid's foreign tour was intended to encourage investment in Indonesia's
moribund economy. But that goal was largely forgotten as the media focused on
the political duel, which sparked fears of a possible military coup in Jakarta.
</P>
<P>
	   U.N. Secretary General Kofi Annan, who met briefly Saturday with Wahid on
the sidelines of a U.N. trade conference in Bangkok, Thailand, said he was
following ``very closely'' the discussions between Wahid and Wiranto.
</P>
<P>
	   Two weeks ago -- after Wahid left for Saudi Arabia on the first leg of his
trip -- a government-sponsored human rights probe into the crisis in East Timor
recommended Wiranto be investigated by state prosecutors.
</P>
<P>
	   Soon after, Wahid announced he would suspend Wiranto. But Wiranto defied
calls to step down. He denied any wrongdoing, and insisted he would present his
case to the president in person.
</P>
<P>
	   The general was a protege of Suharto, who ruled Indonesia for 32 years until
he was ousted in 1988. Wiranto was given the post of security minister last
October when Wahid took office.
</P>
<P>
	   As well as targeting Wiranto, Wahid also has been taking on Suharto himself.
His administration reopened a corruption probe against the 78-year-old autocrat,
and state lawyers named him as a suspect over allegations that his family got
rich on billions of dollars channeled through charitable foundations he set up
and controlled.
</P>
<P>
	   In another development, presidential spokesman Simanjuntak announced that
State Secretary Ali Rahman had resigned from the government.
</P>
<P>
	   No explanation was given, but Rahman -- the second member of the 35-person
Cabinet to quit -- last month proposed to scale down his once-powerful ministry.

   LITTLE ROCK, Ark. (AP) -- Strong winds tore through central Arkansas Sunday
night, destroying at least six homes and injuring two people.
</P>
<P>
	   The National Weather Service issued tornado watches and warnings for the
area but had not confirmed that the damage was caused by tornadoes, senior
forecaster John McLeod said.
</P>
<P>
	   Lonoke County Sheriff's dispatcher Dana Burris said Lonoke residents
reported seeing a tornado near the city about 6 p.m. She said the storm
destroyed six homes, knocked down trees and power lines and damaged farm shops
and equipment. McLeod said two injuries were reported in the area, about 20
miles east of Little Rock.
</P>
<P>
	   Twenty miles further east, near Hazen, strong winds knocked down trees and
power lines and damaged a few houses and businesses, said Prairie County
Sheriff's dispatcher Shannon Muse.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We had a trailer blown off a foundation and a tree fell through a house,''
she said. ``We're checking from resident to resident making sure everybody is
OK.''

<HEADLINE> Old Valentine's Day Letter Found  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON (AP) -- It has been more than 500 years since Margery Brews penned a
Valentine's Day letter to her reluctant fiance John Paston, but her message
still resonates today: if you really loved me, you'd marry me.
</P>
<P>
	   Written on Feb. 14, 1477 in Norfolk, central England, Brews' letter was
discovered in the British Library archives. It is to be displayed for the first
time in March.
</P>
<P>
	   ``It seems some things remain the same ... Men still shy away from
commitment, women still take care of the nitty-gritty of wedding arrangements,''
said Dr. Chris Fletcher, who found the letter in a 1930's collection of papers
bought from the Paston family.
</P>
<P>
	   Brews' note begins pleasantly: ``Right reverent and worshipful and my right
well-beloved valentine, I recommend me unto you full heartedly, desiring to hear
of your welfare, which I beseech Almighty God long for to preserve unto his
pleasure and your hearts desire.''
</P>
<P>
	   She explains that her mother is pressuring her father to increase her dowry.
But with pleasantries aside, Brews then resorts to old-fashioned emotional
blackmail.
</P>
<P>
	   ``But if you love me, as I trust verily that you do, you will not leave me
therefore. For even if you had not half the livelihood that you have, for to do
the greatest labor that any woman alive might, I would not forsake you.''
</P>
<P>
	   It would seem Brew's message did the trick. She and Paston went on to marry
and have two sons, said Fletcher.

<HEADLINE> Tigers Withdraw Gonzalez Offer  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
    DETROIT (AP) -- The Detroit Tigers have withdrawn an eight-year, $140
million contract offer to outfielder Juan Gonzalez, general manager Randy Smith
said Sunday.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Neither side was comfortable with the deal that was out there,'' Smith
told WKBD-TV.
</P>
<P>
	   Smith, speaking from Florida, said the Tigers were still interested in
signing the slugger to a long-term deal. Detroit got the two-time AL MVP from
Texas in a nine-player trade in November.
</P>
<P>
	   Gonzalez's contract would have been the richest total package in baseball
history. Ken Griffey Jr.'s $116.5 million, nine-year contract currently holds
that distinction.
</P>
<P>
	   Griffey got far less than his market value to join his hometown Cincinnati
Reds. He agreed to a lower amount in order to clinch the trade that moved him
from Seattle on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
	   Tigers spokesman Tyler Barnes said the team would not comment on any
contract situation involving Gonzalez. Smith did not immediately return
telephone messages left at his home and on his cellular phone.
</P>
<P>
	   Gonzalez has a .295 batting average and 340 home runs after 11 seasons in
the major leagues, all with Texas.
</P>
<P>
	   Gonzalez has reached 100 RBIs in all but four of his 11 seasons. Last year,
he hit .326 with 39 homers and 128 RBIs.

<P>
    TOKYO (AP) -- Tokyo stocks fell Monday morning following a retreat Friday by
U.S. shares. The dollar edged higher against the Japanese yen.
</P>
<P>
	   The benchmark 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average finished morning trading down
75.25 points, or 0.38 percent, at 19,634.77. On Thursday, the Nikkei dropped
1.49 percent to 19,710.02. Japanese markets were closed Friday for a holiday.
</P>
<P>
	   The U.S. dollar was quoted at 108.68 yen at late morning in Tokyo, up 0.16
yen from its level of 108.52 late Thursday but below its level of 108.99 yen in
late New York trading Friday.
</P>
<P>
	   On the stock market, shares in high-tech companies retreated slightly as
investors reacted to falls late last week on Wall Street.
</P>
<P>
	   In New York trading Friday, the Dow Jones industrial average lost 218.42
points, or 2 percent, to 10,425.21 while the tech-laden Nasdaq Composite Index
fell 90.18 points to 4,395.45.
</P>
<P>
	   In Tokyo, shares in retailers slipped on news that supermarket chain
operator Nagasakiya Co. filed for bankruptcy reorganization Sunday with a group
debt of $3.96 billion.
</P>
<P>
	   In currency trading, the dollar gained slightly against the yen as economic
data released early Monday suggested Japan's export-driven economy continues to
struggle.
</P>
<P>
	   The Ministry of Finance said that the nation's unadjusted current account
surplus fell 39.9 percent from the year-earlier month to a less-than-expected
$7.99 billion.
</P>
<P>
	   For all of 1999, the surplus dropped 22.7 percent, the ministry said. That
was the first fall in three years.
</P>
<P>
	   The broader Tokyo Stock Price Index of all issues listed on the first
section fell 11.30 points this morning, or 0.65 percent, to 1,718.17. The TOPIX
fell 18.36 points, or 1.05 percent, to 1,729.47 on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
	   In other currencies, the euro was traded at 107.13 yen, down from 107.85 yen
late Thursday in Tokyo.
</P>
<P>

<HEADLINE> Stars 2, Capitals 1  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
    DALLAS (AP) -- Rookie Brenden Morrow scored twice and Ed Belfour stopped 14
shots for his 300th career victory as the Dallas Stars beat the Washington
Capitals 2-1 on Sunday night.
</P>
<P>
	   Belfour became the 16th goalie in NHL history to reach 300 victories,
improving his career mark to 300-189-79 as he cooled off the Captials with the
help of Morrow's first multiple-goal game.
</P>
<P>
	   Washington began the night with a 14-3-2 record since Jan. 1, the NHL's best
performance over that span. The Stars are 8-2 in their last 10 games.
</P>
<P>
	   Morrow's second-period goal gave the Stars a 1-0 lead. But Richard Zednik
tied it with his 14th goal at 1:40 of the third period.
</P>
<P>
	   Morrow put the Stars in front for good with 9:55 remaining, skating up the
slot to convert Mike Modano's pass. Morrow has 10 goals this season.
</P>
<P>
	   Dallas dominated play over the first 25 minutes with a 15-2 shots advantage,
then Morrow scored the game's first goal at 6:07 of the second period during a
Dallas power play off a goalmouth pass from Sergei Zubov.
</P>
<P>
	   The Stars are without Derian Hatcher, Joe Nieuwendyk, Jere Lehtinen, Brian
Skrudland and Shawn Chambers, all sidelined by injuries. Brett Hull, who missed
one game due to a broken nose, was back in the lineup against the Caps, using an
elaborate faceguard to protect his nose.
</P>
<P>
	   Hatcher and Lehtinen are expected to return this week.
</P>
<P>
	   Joe Murphy, picked up off waivers last week, made his debut for the Caps.

Corps Accused of Distorting Study
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
	   DES MOINES, Iowa (AP) -- The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers distorted the
economic impact of a $1 billion river project so it would win congressional
approval, an economist said in an affidavit filed today. Donald Sweeney's
44-page affidavit, filed with the U.S. Government's Office of Special Counsel in
Washington, accuses the corps of altering a $50 million study of whether
expanding locks on the Mississippi and Illinois rivers to speed barge traffic
would be economically justified. Ron Fournier, spokesman for the corps' district
office in Rock Island, Ill., said the corps won't comment on Sweeney's specific
allegations until officials see the affidavit.

office spokesman said Monday on condition of anonymity. The asylum-seekers were
among the passengers aboard a hijacked Ariana Airlines Boeing 727 jet diverted
to Stansted airport, north of London, last week. The plane was en route from
Kabul to the northern city of Mazar-e-Sharif when it was hijacked at gunpoint.

Serbia Seeks Pollution Compensation
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
	   BECEJ, Yugoslavia (AP) -- Serbia plans to demand compensation from those
responsible for a cyanide spill that contaminated a major river, destroying most
aquatic life. The spill in the Tisa River, which originated in Romania,
apparently sunk to non-lethal levels Sunday after reaching the Danube. Before
that, however, it had devastated the river in Hungary and Serbia. The cyanide
spill originated in northwest Romania, near the border town of Oradea, where a
dam at the Baia Mare gold mine overflowed Jan. 30, causing cyanide to pour into
streams. At the mine, a cyanide solution is used to separate gold ore from
surrounding rock.

'Peanuts' Creator Schulz Remembered

	   NEW YORK (AP) -- The coincidence of Charles Schulz's death one day before
his final "Peanuts" appeared in newspapers weighed heavily Sunday on fans of
Charlie Brown, Snoopy and Lucy. Schulz was diagnosed with colon cancer and
suffered a series of small strokes during emergency surgery in November 1999,
and announced his retirement a few weeks afterward. "Nobody thought he was too
good, to tell you the truth, because he had a whole different style," Mort
Walker, creator of "Beetle Bailey," said today from Boca Raton, Fla., in an
interview with WCCO-TV in Minneapolis.

of love. The Near Earth Asteroid Rendezvous (NEAR) spacecraft is approaching the
asteroid Eros slowly and is expected to slip into orbit around the
mountain-sized space rock at midmorning tomorrow. If successful, NEAR will
become the first spacecraft to orbit an asteroid. Researchers hope data compiled

asteroid" like one thought to have wiped out the dinosaurs 65 million years ago.

West Defeats East 137-126
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
	   OAKLAND, Calif. (AP) -- Vince Carter started things off with a dunk worthy
of a contest, Tim Duncan and Shaquille O'Neal played like MVPs and Karl Malone
got involved as little as possible. In an All-Star game that was almost a
microcosm of the first half of the season, each star had a chance to show his
specialty -- and most of them did. Behind 24 points apiece from Duncan and Kevin
Garnett, 22 from O'Neal and 14 assists from Jason Kidd, the West defeated the
East 137-126 Sunday in the 49th version of the league's showcase event.

<HEADLINE> Coach Denies Knowing Crawford Plans  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
    ANN ARBOR, Mich. (AP) -- Michigan basketball coach Brian Ellerbe denies a
report that suspended freshman guard Jamal Crawford has told him he plans to
turn pro after this season.
</P>
<P>
	   "Coach Ellerbe denies that Jamal Crawford has told him he wants to turn pro
after his season. There is absolutely no truth to it whatsoever," university
spokesman Tom Wywrot said Sunday night.
</P>
<P>
	   WKBD-TV reported Sunday night that Crawford, who is serving a six-game NCAA
suspension, told Ellerbe he would turn pro after the season. Crawford leads
Michigan in scoring with a 16.6 average.
</P>
<P>
	   Last week, the NCAA said Crawford must repay a Seattle businessman about
$15,000 before he completes his college eligibility.
</P>
<P>
	   Barry Henthorn, president of Innovative Communications Technologies, a
long-distance telephone company, has said he doesn't know how the NCAA expects
Crawford to come up with the money. He said he doesn't want to be repaid and
said if he is he is repaid he will give the money to charity.
</P>
<P>
	   The NCAA suspended Crawford for violating its rules concerning amateurism,
based on his relationship with Henthorn. Crawford lived with Henthorn, with
permission of his mother, for three years while he attended Rainier Beach High
School in Seattle, the NCAA said.

<HEADLINE> Islanders 4, Rangers 2  </HEADLINE>
    By IRA PODELL AP Sports Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   NEW YORK (AP) -- Only one New York team came out ready to play and it wasn't
the club fighting for the playoffs.
</P>
<P>
	   The New York Islanders, who with 39 points are the NHL's third-worst team,
got five points from linemates Jorgen Jonsson and Mariusz Czerkawski to beat the
New York Rangers 4-2 Sunday night.
</P>
<P>
	   "I think I'm disappointed more than angry," said coach John Muckler, whose
Rangers are only three points ahead of ninth-place Buffalo in the Eastern
Conference.
</P>
<P>
	   "Obviously we felt those were two must points and I think they have a better
team than the record shows for," said Rangers center Petr Nedved, who assisted
on the game's first goal.
</P>
<P>
	   Kevin Weekes stopped 31 shots to beat the Rangers for the fourth time this
season, twice since joining the Islanders after being traded from Vancouver.
</P>
<P>
	   "Playing at Madison Square Garden and winning, it doesn't get any better
than this," Weekes said.
</P>
<P>
	   Jonsson, who had three assists, has nine points in three games, one goal and
eight assists. The Islanders matched a season high with their third straight
victory.
</P>
<P>
	   "Since Christmas, he's been getting better and better," Islanders coach
Butch Goring said. "He's playing like an All-Star. If you're a winger with this
guy, you have to be thrilled to death."
</P>
<P>
	   Czerkawski knows that good fortune and had two assists, extending his
point-scoring streak to a career best 10 games.
</P>
<P>
	   "It's nice to be on his wing right now," Czerkawski said. "He is more
comfortable and confident."
</P>
<P>
	   The Islanders rebounded from a pair of one-goal deficits and a controversial
Rangers score in gaining their 16th victory.
</P>
<P>
	   They scored three times in the second period and grabbed the lead with 3:40
left in the frame.
</P>
<P>
	   "The second period was probably one of the worst periods we've played all
year," Muckler said. "I fear games like this. If you're not prepared when you
leave the dressing room, it's hard to switch it on when you get out there."
</P>
<P>
	   Jonsson skated around Valeri Kamensky down low and fed Mathieu Biron, who
beat Mike Richter from the right side of the net for his fourth goal to make it
3-2.
</P>
<P>
	   "Right now I feel great skating," Jonsson said. "I'm not tired out there."
</P>
<P>
	   Claude Lapointe scored his 11th goal with 43.8 seconds left into an empty
net.
</P>
<P>
	   The Rangers took a 1-0 lead in the opening period, on a perfectly executed
3-on-2 by the "Czechmates" line, when Jan Hlavac scored his 14th goal.
</P>
<P>
	   Radek Dvorak raced down right wing and moved the puck to Nedved above the
circles. Nedved carried down low and backhanded a pass to Hlavac, who steered it
into the open left side of the net at 7:37.
</P>
<P>
	   Hlavac, who had his first career hat trick Friday night and then became a
father on Saturday, has five goals and an assist in five games against the
Islanders.
</P>
<P>
	   The Islanders tied it 4:18 into the second on Jason Krog's first NHL goal.
Czerkawski slid the puck to Jonsson while being dragged down. Jonsson got the
puck across to Krog, who scored into the upper left corner.
</P>
<P>
	   But the Rangers struck back after just 2:58 passed. Late on a power play,
the game and penalty clocks failed to start after a faceoff. The Rangers got 14
extra seconds with a man advantage before the problem was noticed.
</P>
<P>
	   As a result, Gino Odjick was just getting out of the penalty box and back
into play when Stephane Quintal fired a shot from the point that Weekes kicked
out. The rebound came right to Dvorak, who netted his 13th goal.
</P>
<P>
	   Goring slammed a stick against the boards to alert the officials of the
problem. The goal was allowed to stand and the 14 seconds were then deducted.
</P>
<P>
	   The Islanders weren't fazed and tied it 1:04 later. Jonsson won a faceoff
and the puck came back to Jamie Heward at the left point. Richter stopped
Heward's drive, but Josh Green converted the rebound for his ninth goal.
</P>
<P>
	   "The last week or so has been really great," Jonsson said. "Our line likes
to move their feet and cycle in the corners."
</P>
<P>
	   The Rangers were without Tim Taylor and lost Theo Fleury midway through the
second period because of the flu.
</P>
<P>
	   Islanders defenseman Eric Cairns was suspended for the game because of a
hallway fight Saturday with Pittsburgh's Matthew Barnaby.
</P>
<P>
	   The teams split the five-game season series 2-2-1. The Islanders hold a
78-76-17 advantage in 28 seasons.
</P>
<P>
	   "This is fun for me," said Goring, a star from the Islanders' Stanley Cup
glory days. "The Islanders always enjoy beating the Rangers regardless of our
positions in the standings."

<HEADLINE> Red Wings 4, Avalanche 3  </HEADLINE>
    By JOHN MOSSMAN AP Sports Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   DENVER (AP) -- Brendan Shanahan scored his eighth game-winning goal of the
season, capping a rally from a three-goal deficit as the Detroit Red Wings beat
the Colorado Avalanche 4-3 on Sunday night.
</P>
<P>
	   Shanahan had the decisive goal, his 29th, at 16:07 of the final period.
After Sergei Fedorov got the puck airborne on an apparent attempt to dump it
into the Colorado zone, Shanahan chased after it and beat defenseman Martin
Skoula and goalie Patrick Roy.
</P>
<P>
	   After falling behind 3-0 midway through the second period, Detroit got
second-period goals from Fedorov and Darren McCarty. Pat Verbeek tied it at
12:11 of the third period.
</P>
<P>
	   Detroit's Chris Osgood had 22 saves, and Roy finished with 32.
</P>
<P>
	   It marked the first time this season that Detroit had won after trailing
after two periods; the Red Wings had been 0-12-1 in such situations. It was
Detroit's third straight come-from-behind victory over Colorado this season,
however.
</P>
<P>
	   Colorado was playing without its best offensive player, Peter Forsberg
(concussion), and its best defender, Adam Foote (groin).
</P>
<P>
	   In a chippy game between two the bitter rivals, Chris Drury and Joe Sakic
scored first-period goals to put Colorado ahead 2-0.
</P>
<P>
	   Colorado didn't get its first shot on goal until more than seven minutes
into the game and was outshot 10-2 before Drury scored on a power play at 11:20.
</P>
<P>
	   Drury scored his 17th goal on a shot from the point that ricocheted off
Osgood's left ribs.
</P>
<P>
	   On the ensuing faceoff, Detroit's Martin Lapointe slugged Colorado's Jeff
Odgers, then dropped his gloves and stick and drew a two-minute penalty for
roughing, but the Avalanche couldn't convert. Moments after returning to the
ice, Lapointe leveled Odgers with a blindside hit along the boards.
</P>
<P>
	   Sakic made it 2-0 at 16:23, punching in a rebound.
</P>
<P>
	   In a 4-on-4 situation midway through the second period, Colorado rookie Alex
Tanguay made it 3-0 at 9:35, pushing the puck past defenseman Steve Duchesne
after Chris Chelios failed to clear it from the left boards.
</P>
<P>
	   Just 17 seconds later, Fedorov countered, scoring on a backhander from the
slot on a pass from Duchesne at 9:52. Then, at 12:15, McCarty, returning to the
ice after missing 39 games following hernia surgery, tipped in Duchesne's shot.
</P>
<P>
	   Roy later made a pad save on a breakaway by Fedorov.
</P>
<P>
	   Verbeek tied it from in front of the goal after taking a pass from Nicklas
Lidstrom.

<HEADLINE> Protesters Pack Into Ore. Church  </HEADLINE>
   By CRISTINE GONZALEZ Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   PORTLAND, Ore. (AP) -- More than 1,100 people from different faiths packed
into a Methodist church Sunday to protest a city official's order limiting
another church's attendance to 70.
</P>
<P>
	   Last month, land-use hearing officer Elizabeth Normand told Sunnyside
Centenary United Methodist Church to cut its attendance. She said neighbors had
complained that people leaving the church's twice-a-week meals program sometimes
created a nuisance.
</P>
<P>
	   The Portland city attorney's office on Friday recommended dropping the
attendance limits at services, but it suggested keeping restrictions on other
church activities.
</P>
<P>
	   A hearing on the issue is scheduled for March 1.
</P>
<P>
	   Many of the protesters Sunday said they felt their constitutional rights
were being trampled.
</P>
<P>
	   ``That hearing officer has given us a gift. When was the last time people of
all faiths united here around the right of a local church to reach out and touch
people in need?'' said the Rev. Steve Sprecher, superintendent of the
Oregon-Idaho United Methodist Conference.
</P>
<P>
	   Several religious leaders said the church's fellowship and outreach programs
provide more than government assistance because the services satisfy both basic
and spiritual needs. One man told how his life had improved because of the
church's outreach programs.
</P>
<P>
	   ``For 40 years of my life, I was either under a bridge, in jail, in a mental
institution, or in treatment,'' said Alan Devine of the Recovery Association
Project. ``There were places like Sunnyside where I could go practice what it
was like to be a human being.''
</P>
<P>
	   Pat Schwiebert, a Sunnyside program organizer, said the church had stopped
all services for three months after the Sunnyside Neighborhood Association
complained to city officials two years ago.
</P>
<P>
	   The church met with neighbors and then tripled its budget and organized a
foot patrol of volunteers to keep watch over the neighborhood.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We believed our efforts reduced problems in the neighborhood,'' Schwiebert
said. ``Will there problems in the future? Probably, yes. But it won't be
because we don't care, but because we are imperfect people.''

   LINTHICUM, Md. (AP) -- A light rail commuter train arriving at
Baltimore-Washington International Airport hit a safety barrier at the end of
the line Sunday, sending almost two dozen people to area hospitals.
</P>
<P>
	   The train's operator, who suffered minor injuries, and the 22 passengers
were taken to area hospitals. One passenger was in serious condition, but
details on the others were not available.
</P>
<P>
	   The one-car train originated at Baltimore's Penn Station and normally would
have been traveling about 13 mph as it neared the end its trip about 2:45 p.m.,
Fulton said.
</P>
<P>
	   Investigators were trying to determine how fast it was moving when it hit
the barrier.
</P>
<P>
	   Witnesses said they heard the train's brakes screeching just before the
crash. The impact crumpled the front end of the car and derailed it, but the car
train remained upright in the airport train station.
</P>

	   ``I was knocked completely out,'' passenger Marlene Perry said, wearing a
patch over her eye.

<HEADLINE> Indonesia's Gen. Wiranto Suspended  </HEADLINE>
   By SLOBODAN LEKIC Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) -- In a surprise reversal, President Abdurrahman
Wahid suspended his powerful security minister, Gen. Wiranto, from the Cabinet
on Monday over his alleged role in last year's bloodshed in East Timor, a
spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
	   Upon his return home Sunday following a 16-day overseas tour, Wahid met with
Wiranto and announced that the minister would remain part of the government
while the attorney general's office conducted a new formal inquiry into the
violence that followed East Timor's vote for independence.
</P>
<P>
	   But late Sunday night, the president -- who has been known to frequently
make strong statements on issues only to ignore them later or change his stance
-- told Indonesian reporters that Wiranto would be suspended from the Cabinet.
</P>
<P>
	   ``While waiting for the attorney general's special team to investigate Gen.
Wiranto, I have taken a decision to deactivate him from duty, and (appoint)
Interior Minister Surjadi Sudirdja as interim coordinating minister for security
and political affairs,'' Wahid said, as quoted by several newspapers.
</P>
<P>
	   On Monday, Cabinet secretary Marsilam Simanjuntak said the decree confirming
Wiranto's suspension pending the outcome of the new probe had already been
signed.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The president made the new decision by himself last night for the sake of
the government's stability and the interests of Gen. Wiranto to allow him to
concentrate on the investigation to be conducted by the attorney general's
special team,'' Simanjuntak said.
</P>
<P>
	   Wahid insisted he had not flip-flopped on the issue.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I didn't change my mind,'' Wahid commented to reporters after the
spokesman's statement. ``Yesterday I said there would be an investigation of him
and after that he is going to resign.''
</P>
<P>
	   Wiranto has been accused by separate Indonesian and U.N. human rights panels
of failing to prevent East Timor's violence in September as commander of the
country's armed forces.
</P>
<P>
	   Hundreds of people were killed and much of the province devastated in
attacks by anti-independence militants following East Timor's vote for
independence on Aug. 30. Indonesian soldiers have been accused of taking part in
some attacks and stepping back and allowing many others.
</P>
<P>
	   Wahid's foreign tour was intended to encourage investment in Indonesia's
moribund economy. But that goal was largely forgotten as the media focused on
the political duel, which sparked fears of a possible military coup in Jakarta.
</P>
<P>
	   U.N. Secretary General Kofi Annan, who met briefly Saturday with Wahid on
the sidelines of a U.N. trade conference in Bangkok, Thailand, said he was
following ``very closely'' the discussions between Wahid and Wiranto.
</P>
<P>
	   Two weeks ago -- after Wahid left for Saudi Arabia on the first leg of his
trip -- a government-sponsored human rights probe into the crisis in East Timor
recommended Wiranto be investigated by state prosecutors.
</P>
<P>
	   Soon after, Wahid announced he would suspend Wiranto. But Wiranto defied
calls to step down. He denied any wrongdoing, and insisted he would present his
case to the president in person.
</P>
<P>
	   The general was a protege of Suharto, who ruled Indonesia for 32 years until
he was ousted in 1998. Wiranto was given the post of security minister last
October when Wahid took office.
</P>
<P>
	   As well as targeting Wiranto, Wahid also has been taking on Suharto himself.
His administration reopened a corruption probe against the 78-year-old autocrat,
and state lawyers named him as a suspect over allegations that his family got
rich on billions of dollars channeled through charitable foundations he set up
and controlled.
</P>
<P>
	   On Monday, Suharto failed to show up at the attorney general's office where
prosecutors planned to question him. His lawyers told reporters that the former
strongman was too ill to testify.
</P>
<P>
	   In another development, Simanjuntak announced that State Secretary Ali
Rahman, who runs the president's office, had resigned from the government.
</P>
<P>
	   No explanation was given, but Rahman -- the second member of the 35-person
Cabinet to quit -- last month proposed to scale down his once-powerful ministry.

<HEADLINE> Alaska Airlines Grounds 8 Planes  </HEADLINE>
   By LEON DROUIN KEITH Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Eight Alaska Airlines jetliners remained grounded Sunday
with tail equipment problems that may be linked to the deadly crash of Flight
261. Other carriers said most of their planes were back in the air.
</P>
<P>
	   The Federal Aviation Administration last week ordered inspections of nearly
1,100 planes, focusing on the jackscrew, a 2-foot-long rod that drives the
horizontal stabilizer flaps in the tail that help keep the plane level.
</P>
<P>
	   Airlines had reported finding jackscrew problems in 22 planes by midday
Sunday. They were given until Monday to complete the checks of all MD-80 series,
MD-90s, DC-9s and Boeing 717s.
</P>
<P>
	   Two of Alaska Airlines' grounded planes have metal shavings around the
jackscrews, a problem FAA officials are most concerned about. The other six, and
many of the 14 planes from other airlines, have a gritty residue around the
jackscrews that may prove to be from normal wear.
</P>
<P>
	   Federal investigators have not yet determined whether the jackscrew on
Flight 261 played a role in the Jan. 31 crash that killed all 88 people aboard.
The jackscrew recovered from the crash site had damaged threads and metal
shavings, and the pilots of Flight 261 had reported stabilizer trouble before
the plane went down in the Pacific Ocean.
</P>
<P>
	   Also Sunday, the National Transportation Safety Board said records from a
Sept. 29, 1997, maintenance check on the plane showed that the gimbal nut was to
be replaced. But the next day, the gimbal nut and jackscrew were reinspected and
Alaska Airlines inspectors found that the parts met specified limits.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The significance of this information is continuing to be evaluated by the
NTSB. No determination has been made as to whether this information has any
bearing on the accident,'' the NTSB said in a news release.
</P>
<P>
	   Airlines that found irregularities in jackscrews are replacing them and
examining the rods, and those jackscrews removed are being sent to a National
Transportation Safety Board lab for further examination, FAA spokesman Eliot
Brenner said.
</P>
<P>
	   ``There's a good chance some of what we're discovering is just normal
wear,'' Brenner said.
</P>
<P>
	   Northwest and Alaska had finished their inspections by Sunday morning, and
three others -- American, Delta and TWA -- had inspected about 90 percent of
their planes.
</P>
<P>
	   Brenner said Alaska Airlines may have a higher number of planes with
reported problems because the airline is being extremely cautious.
</P>
<P>
	   The FAA's order also increased the frequency of regular jackscrew
inspections from every eight months to about every three months.
</P>
<P>
	   FAA administrator Jane Garvey on Sunday responded to a U.S. News and World
Report article that said Flight 261's horizontal stabilizer was made in China,
and that quoted a spokesman for the International Association of Machinists and
Aerospace Workers as saying FAA oversight of foreign parts manufacturers is
inadequate.
</P>
<P>
	   Garvey said on CNN that the international organization that oversees
aviation manufacturing ``has some very high standards.'' But she added, ``I
think that's going to be an issue that the NTSB will look at and we may make
some changes.''
</P>
<P>
	   Boeing spokesman John Thom said Sunday that the manufacturer of the part
used on Flight 261 had not yet been determined.
</P>
<P>
	   No matter where the parts are built, they meet the same stringent
specifications, Thom said. ``We insist on that. We'd be stupid if we didn't.''
</P>
<P>
	   Wreckage from Flight 261 -- including a plane seat and surfboards carried
aboard the aircraft -- have washed up as far as 140 miles from the crash site,
San Luis Obispo County sheriff's Lt. Martin Basti said.
</P>
<P>
	   The Ventura County medical examiner reported Sunday that 46 bodies had been
positively identified and that families were being notified.

Corps Engineers Accused of Distorting Study
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
	   DES MOINES, Iowa (AP) -- Officials are accusing the U.S. Army Corps of
Engineers of distorting the economic impact of a $1 billion river project so it
would win congressional approval. Donald Sweeney's 44-page affidavit, filed with
the U.S. Government's Office of Special Counsel in Washington, accuses the corps
of altering a $50 million study of whether expanding locks on the Mississippi
and Illinois rivers to speed barge traffic would be economically justified. Ron
Fournier, spokesman for the corps' district office in Rock Island, Ill., said
the corps won't comment on Sweeney's specific allegations until officials see
the affidavit.

Plan Would Disperse Asylum-Seekers

	   LONDON (AP) -- Under a new plan being drafted by Britain, 74 asylum-seekers
from a hijacked Afghan plane may be dispersed around the world. The passengers
could be sent to the United States, Pakistan, India and elsewhere a foreign
office spokesman said Monday on condition of anonymity. The asylum-seekers were
among the passengers aboard a hijacked Ariana Airlines Boeing 727 jet diverted
to Stansted airport, north of London, last week. The plane was en route from
Kabul to the northern city of Mazar-e-Sharif when it was hijacked at gunpoint.

Fans Remember 'Peanuts' Creator Schulz
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
	   NEW YORK (AP) -- The coincidence of Charles Schulz's death one day before
his final "Peanuts" appeared in newspapers weighed heavily Sunday on fans of
Charlie Brown, Snoopy and Lucy. Schulz was diagnosed with colon cancer and
suffered a series of small strokes during emergency surgery in November 1999,
and announced his retirement a few weeks afterward. "Nobody thought he was too
good, to tell you the truth, because he had a whole different style," Mort
Walker, creator of "Beetle Bailey," said today from Boca Raton, Fla., in an
interview with WCCO-TV in Minneapolis.

'Scream 3' Mutes DiCaprio's 'Beach'
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
	   LOS ANGELES (AP) -- "Scream 3" shouted down Leonardo DiCaprio's new film to
retain the top spot at the box office, according to industry estimates Sunday.
The third movie in the horror franchise took in $16.4 million in its second
weekend. DiCaprio's "The Beach," about an American backpacker's ill-fated search
for paradise, opened in second place with $15 million, according to Exhibitor
Relations Co. Inc., which tracks movie ticket sales. Panned by many critics,
"The Beach" puts DiCaprio in a far darker role than the heroic heartthrob he
played in "Titanic," the all-time box-office leader.

<HEADLINE> Tigers GM: Gonzalez Offer Stands  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
    DETROIT (AP) -- Detroit Tigers general manager Randy Smith dismissed as
``totally inaccurate'' a report the team has withdrawn an eight-year, $140
million contract offer to outfielder Juan Gonzalez.
</P>
<P>
	   Smith said Sunday night that his stance all along has been that neither he,
nor anyone in the organization, will comment on the Gonzalez contract situation.
</P>
<P>
	   Detroit television station WKBD quoted Smith earlier in the night as saying
that the team had withdrawn the offer.
</P>
<P>
	   Smith, speaking from Florida, said ``that's not anything close (to what I
said). I've never even said there was a deal out there.''
</P>
<P>
	   Smith said Detroit is interested in signing Gonzalez to a long-term deal.
</P>
<P>
	   Media reports have said that the Tigers have offered Gonzalez $140 million,
which would be the richest total package in baseball history.
</P>
<P>
	   Ken Griffey Jr.'s $116.5 million, nine-year contract currently holds that
distinction.
</P>
<P>
	   Griffey got far less than his market value to join his hometown Cincinnati
Reds. He agreed to a lower amount in order to clinch the trade that moved him
from Seattle on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
	   Gonzalez, a two-time American League MVP, has a .295 batting average and 340
home runs after 11 seasons in the major leagues, all with the Texas Rangers.
</P>
<P>
	   He was acquired in a nine-player trade with the Rangers in November. In all
but four of his 11 seasons, Gonzalez had driven in over 100 runs.
</P>
<P>
	   Last season, he hit .326 with 39 homers and 128 RBIs.
