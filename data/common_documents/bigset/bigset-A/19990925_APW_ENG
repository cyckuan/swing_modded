<HEADLINE> Ty Cobb's Jersey Fetches $332,500 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- An autographed jersey signed by Ty Cobb fetched  
$332,500 at auction Saturday, a day after one that once belonged to 
Lou Gehrig went for $305,000. 
</P>
<P>
	The Hall of Famers' garments were part of Sotheby's Barry Halper  
Collection of Baseball Memorabilia, which raised $9.3 million in 
its first three days on auction. 
</P>
<P>
	Cobb's jersey, from his 1928 season with the Philadelphia  
Athletics, was thought to be the only one in existence. A 
representative of the Upper Deck Trading Card Company bought it for 
the firm, and the same company purchased Gehrig's 1927 jersey. 
</P>
<P>
	Upper Deck said both items would be used in upcoming promotions.  
</P>
<P>
	In addition to the jerseys, more than 30,000 baseball cards from  
1886-1972 were auctioned off as well. Included was a Honus Wagner 
Proof Strip from 1910, which sold to dealer Steven Verkman for 
$85,000. 
</P>
<P>
	The unique set -- with each card connected to the next in a  
continuous strip -- was discovered years ago in the pants pocket of 
some trousers in Wagner's attic. 
</P>
<P>
	The Halper collection also included rarities like one of Babe  
Ruth's 1914 rookie cards, which sold to a private collector from 
Illinois for $79,500, Sotheby's officials said. 
</P>
<P>
	The baseball memorabilia auction was scheduled to run through  
Thursday. Upcoming lots include Joe DiMaggio's signed San Francisco 
Seals rookie jersey from 1933, and Mickey Mantle's 1956 World 
Series ring.

<HEADLINE> D'Backs Look Beyond Division Title </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SAN FRANCISCO (AP) -- Fireworks exploded in the stadium. Younger  
teammates doused each other with champagne. Randy Johnson and Matt 
Williams stood away from the excitement, talking calmly about the 
task ahead. 
</P>
<P>
	The Arizona Diamondbacks, who went from an expansion team and  
last place to NL West champions in one season, had a mostly subdued 
celebration Friday night after clinching the title with an 11-3 win 
over the San Francisco Giants. 
</P>
<P>
	For experienced players such as Johnson and Williams, the  
temptation to whoop it up was overcome by the need to focus on 
preparing for the playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's a lot of veterans on this club that have been in the  
postseason before, and your motivation now is to get the home field 
advantage,'' said Johnson, who pitched a five-hitter to beat the 
Giants. ``The hard work doesn't stop here. There's still a lot of 
good teams we have to go through.'' 
</P>
<P>
	While Johnson stood calmly at his locker, a few feet away from  
celebrating teammates, Williams sat in front of his cubicle and 
quietly talked about the future. 
</P>
<P>
	``Come tomorrow, we have to start focusing on the next step,''  
Williams said. ``Considering what happened last year, we've come 
through a rough period.'' 
</P>
<P>
	While some of the players didn't react with much emotion, the  
Diamondbacks' fans did. In Arizona, fans gathered in sports bars to 
watch the team's clincher. 
</P>
<P>
	Cheers and chants were mixed with booze and high-fives at  
Jackson's on Third, a popular bar just one block from Bank One 
Ballpark. 
</P>
<P>
	``Randy! Randy! Randy!'' they chanted for Johnson.  
</P>
<P>
	``Gonzo! Gonzo! Gonzo!'' they cheered as a champagne-drenched  
Luis Gonzalez showed up on the screen. 
</P>
<P>
	They repeatedly hollered, ``We Want The Braves,'' a heady  
challenge to the perennial NL powers from Atlanta. 
</P>
<P>
	``Awesome, absolutely thrilling, wonderful,'' said Gina Mallory,  
44, of Tempe, whose eyes never left the screen for every pitch of 
Friday night's game. ``I used to live in St. Louis and I was a 
Cardinals fan for years, but this is awesome.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Much has been made of how there hasn't seemed to be a frenzy for  
the Diamondbacks, but there have been recent signs that the support 
is growing. 
</P>
<P>
	The crowd cheered loudest when, in the ninth inning, the camera  
switched to the Arizona clubhouse for a closeup of the champagne on 
ice. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't think people around the country are taking us  
seriously,'' said Robert Viether, 25, of Phoenix, who wore a 
Diamondbacks jersey with Brian Anderson's No. 34. ``The farther we 
go in the playoffs, the more seriously they'll take us.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Diamondbacks scheduled a celebration Sunday night at Bank  
One Ballpark Plaza. 
</P>
<P>
	Johnson was surrounded by teammates at the front of the mound  
after finishing off his major league-leading 12th complete game of 
the season. 
</P>
<P>
	Johnson, the biggest acquisition during an offseason spending  
spree that turned the expansion Diamondbacks into champions, struck 
out 11 and had an RBI single as Arizona clinched the division title 
a year after losing 97 games. 
</P>
<P>
	As the Diamondbacks celebrated in their clubhouse, fireworks  
went off in the stadium -- part of a promotion scheduled by the 
Giants long before they realized they could be hosting a clinching 
party by Arizona. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's tough to watch,'' Giants manager Dusty Baker said of the  
Diamondbacks celebrating on the field. ``You wish it was you. We 
remember when it was us.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Arizona became the first expansion club to win a division title  
in less than eight years. The Florida Marlins, who won a World 
Series championship in their fifth year, were a wild-card team in 
that 1997 season. 
</P>
<P>
	Johnson allowed three unearned runs, all in the first inning,  
but retired 14 straight batters after that. He increased his major 
league-best strikeout total to 353. 
</P>
<P>
	The 353 strikeouts moved Johnson past Bob Feller (348 for  
Cleveland in 1946) and Rube Waddell (349 for the Philadelphia A's 
in 1904) and into fourth place on the list for strikeouts in a 
season. Only Nolan Ryan and Sandy Koufax have struck out more 
batters in a year. 
</P>
<P>
	Johnson has 22 double-digit strikeout games this year, tying the  
NL record set by Koufax in 1965. 
</P>
<P>
	The Diamondbacks doubled their payroll from $32 million to $65.9  
million during the offseason by signing several key free agents, 
including Johnson and center fielder Steve Finley -- who went to the 
World Series last season as a member of the San Diego Padres. 
</P>
<P>
	``Last year, I got to do this three times,'' Finley said of the  
celebration in the Arizona clubhouse. ``My goal this year is 
four.''

<HEADLINE> U.S. Seeks To Cut Trade Deficit </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Clinton administration appealed Saturday  
to Japan and its other major economic allies to do more to boost 
growth in their countries and relieve pressure from a soaring U.S. 
trade deficit. 
</P>
<P>
	The widening imbalances in global trade, a weakening dollar and  
a falling U.S. stock market were key concerns at a meeting of the 
world's seven largest industrial countries. Their talks came in 
advance of the annual joint meetings of the 182-nation 
International Monetary Fund and the World Bank. 
</P>
<P>
	Treasury Secretary Lawrence Summers and Alan Greenspan, chairman  
of the Federal Reserve, were the hosts for their counterparts from 
Japan, Germany, France, Britain, Italy and Canada. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition to searching for a coordinated approach to bolster  
world growth, those officials expected to endorse creation of a new 
group of 20 rich and poor countries to help develop new financial 
reform proposals to prevent, or at least better handle, any future 
Asian-style currency crises. 
</P>
<P>
	The finance leaders also were looking for further ways to reform  
operations at the IMF. The agency has come under renewed attack for 
its handling of multibillion dollar rescue packages after 
allegations surfaced last month of widespread money laundering in 
Russia, the largest recipient of IMF loans. 
</P>
<P>
	Even with the unfolding Russian investigations, this year's IMF  
and World Bank meetings are taking place in an atmosphere markedly 
improved from a year ago. Then, a botched devaluation of the 
Russian ruble and the near collapse of a large American hedge fund 
threatened to push the United States and the rest of the world into 
recession. 
</P>
<P>
	That calamity was avoided in large part because the U.S. economy  
has continued to outperform expectations, serving as a market for 
crisis-striken Asian nations. 
</P>
<P>
	But with the trade deficit soaring to an annual rate of $247  
billion, 50 percent higher than last year's record, Greenspan and 
Summers both have expressed concerns about sustaining such a huge 
imbalance. 
</P>
<P>
	While noting Japan finally appears to be recovering from its  
worst recession in 50 years, Summers said Tokyo must continue to 
use all available tools to stimulate the economy. 
</P>
<P>
	``Crucial to a sustained and balanced United States expansion  
will be greater balance in global economic growth,'' Summers said 
in a preview of the finance meetings. 
</P>
<P>
	Summers and Greenspan met privately with Japanese Finance  
Minister Kiichi Miyazawa and Masaru Hayami for an hour before the 
G-7 talks. Treasury spokeswoman Michelle Smith described the 
meeting as a ``very good and full discussion'' of economic issues 
facing the two countries. 
</P>
<P>
	Miyazawa told reporters he had described the full range of  
policy actions his government is taking to ensure Japan's fledgling 
recovery does not falter. 
</P>
<P>
	Japan had hoped to get G-7 support for coordinated effort to  
halt a slide in the value of the dollar against the Japanese yen. 
Japan fears the drop could harm its growth prospects by making 
Japanese exports more expensive in relation to American goods. 
</P>
<P>
	The dollar has fallen by 15 percent against the yen over the  
past 10 weeks. The decline has raised worries in the United States 
about higher inflation and a potential sharp correction in the 
stock market if foreign investors begin to cash out their sizable 
U.S. holdings over worries about the dollar's weakness. 
</P>
<P>
	The weak dollar and inflation concerns were chief reasons cited  
in last week's 524-point drop in the Dow Jones industrial average, 
the worst performance in a year. Stock prices now stand 1,047 
points below the record high set on Aug. 25. 
</P>
<P>
	But comments by Summers and U.S. officials in recent days  
indicated the administration has no interest in intervening in 
currency markets to buy dollars. The preference is to keep the 
pressure on Japan to boost its domestic growth rather than rely on 
exports to fuel its economy. 
</P>
<P>
	The world's poorest countries also on the agenda of the finance  
meetings. The G-7 was expected to give its support to an initiative 
to more than double the amount of debt relief offered to those 
countries so they can spend more on health care and education. 
</P>
<P>
	Part of the $27 billion in debt relief, in current dollars,  
would come from the IMF's sale of 14 million ounces of its gold 
reserves.

<HEADLINE> Mites Endanger U.S. Honeybees </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SALOME, Ariz. (AP) -- You can't see them at first, or even hear  
them. The boxes give them away. 
</P>
<P>
	In a dirt lot alongside a field of alfalfa seed plants, hundreds  
of pine containers are stacked on pallets. Inside, 800 colonies of 
honeybees are resting after a hard season in the fields. They 
pollinated almonds and cherries in California, cantaloupe and 
watermelons in Arizona. 
</P>
<P>
	Back in the McMullen Valley, 10,000 acres of farmland 100 miles  
northwest of Phoenix, they're gearing up for another round of work 
come fall. More melons await, along with cotton and alfalfa. 
</P>
<P>
	But some have come home to die.  
</P>
<P>
	Clad in jeans and a T-shirt labeled Bee World Inc., Ken Orletsky  
inspects his lot, prying open boxes and pulling out screens laden 
with thousands of bees. There are four colonies per pallet, each 
colony swarming with as many as 40,000 bees. 
</P>
<P>
	Then Orletsky comes upon a half-empty pallet.  
</P>
<P>
	``Deadout,'' he explains.  
</P>
<P>
	Over the past two decades, 90 percent of the nation's wild  
honeybees have been wiped out by two mites that arrived in the 
United States in the 1980s, transported by insect and man. Managed 
colonies owned by beekeepers such as Orletsky have dwindled from 5 
million to 2.4 million, while the number of US beekeepers has 
fallen from 212,000 to about 125,000. 
</P>
<P>
	The culprits are the tracheal and varroa mites. First detected  
in Great Britain in 1921, the tracheal mite clogs a bee's breathing 
tube. The varroa, native to Asia, feeds on the blood of developing 
bees, which emerge from the hive with deformed wings or missing 
legs. 
</P>
<P>
	Together, these alien creatures are destroying US honeybees,  
themselves a nonnative species first brought to America in the 
1500s by Catholic orders that used them for winemaking and wax. 
</P>
<P>
	Today honeybees account for much of the food in the nation's  
supermarkets. Besides producing an average 210 million pounds of 
honey each year, they pollinate just about all the fruit, nut and 
seed crops -- everything from apples, cherries, cantaloupes, 
watermelons, blueberries and strawberries to almonds, cashews and 
alfalfa seed, which feeds cattle and poultry. 
</P>
<P>
	``Many people do not realize that without the honeybees, their  
diet would be reduced to a few grain crops, potatoes and rice and a 
nut crop or two,'' says Eric Erickson, director of the US 
Department of Agriculture's Carl Hayden Bee Research Center in 
Tucson. 
</P>
<P>
	In the late '80s, when the tracheal mite migrated to Arizona,  
Orletsky began treating his colonies with pesticides. He's never 
stopped, and spends at least $12,000 annually on mite medication. 
</P>
<P>
	Orletsky strives to maintain 4,000 colonies, but each year he'll  
lose up to 50 percent of his bees. He estimates that treating for 
mites and rebuilding colonies have driven his costs up 100 percent, 
and the burden is beginning to trickle down to the growers. 
</P>
<P>
	In California, where 1 million bees are needed annually to  
pollinate the state's almond crop, hives are renting for $40 each 
compared with $18 in the 1980s, says Chico almond grower Dan 
Cummings. 
</P>
<P>
	But Cummings, vice chairman of the state's Almond Board, said  
growers haven't had trouble finding bees to rent. Elsewhere farmers 
haven't been so lucky. 
</P>
<P>
	Joseph Nicolosi, who grows cantaloupes, pickles and zucchini  
squash in Swedesboro, N.J., placed an ad on the Internet looking 
for 80 colonies after mites destroyed the colonies he usually 
rents. 
</P>
<P>
	``We can't work without them,'' Nicolosi says.  
</P>
<P>
	Another problem is that the decimation of European honeybees has  
coincided with the arrival of Africanized bees in the United 
States. These intruders are resistant to the deadly mites. So as 
the bee population recovers, it is a hybrid mix that tends to be 
more Africanized than European, researchers say. 
</P>
<P>
	Africanized bees pollinate just as well as European bees, but  
beekeepers don't want them because they're more aggressive. 
</P>
<P>
	Researchers are trying to develop additional techniques to fight  
the mites, including the use of essential oils and breeding 
mite-resistant bees. But a new threat is already on the horizon. An 
African beetle that first appeared in the United States last year 
is threatening bees along the East Coast. 
</P>
<P>
	``Between man-assisted methods and wind currents, these  
creatures can go virtually anywhere,'' Erickson says. ``People 
traveling from west to east in automobiles, trains and planes -- all 
those conveniences provide an opportunity for creatures to hitch a 
ride.''

</P>
<P>
	ATLANTA (AP) -- Ann Gay Dodson, who made sure seven rooms at the  
White House were filled with flowers from Jimmy Carter's hometown 
when he was sworn in as president, died Thursday of cancer. She was 
87. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Dodson, a horticulturist and national flower show judge,  
made sure that familiar plants and flowers from Plains, Ga., 
surrounded the First Family on Inauguration Day 1977. 
</P>
<P>
	Flowers, fruit, foliage and fruit blossoms were used, including  
roses, delphiniums, irises, snapdragons, forsythia, limes, grapes, 
heather, magnolias, pines, mahonias, quinces and nandinas, 
according to the book ``Flowers from Plains to the White House,'' 
which Mrs. Dodson published about the project. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition to heading the White House Decorating Committee,  
Mrs. Dodson was an accomplished artist who specialized in china 
painting and oils. She was the owner and operator of a beauty shop 
in Plains for more than 40 years. Some of her paintings hang at the 
Carter Center in Atlanta.

 *Judith Exner    	
</P>
<P>
	DUARTE, Calif. (AP) -- Judith Campbell Exner, a reputed mistress  
of John F. Kennedy who claimed to have ferried messages between the 
president and Mafia boss Sam Giancana, died of breast cancer 
Friday. She was 65. 
</P>
<P>
	Exner made waves in 1977 with her autobiography, ``My Story,''  
which included a description of her alleged affair with Kennedy. 
</P>
<P>
	In a 1996 issue of Vanity Fair, Ms. Exner said she ended a  
two-year affair because she hated being ``the other woman,'' and 
also claimed that she aborted Kennedy's child 10 months before he 
was assassinated. 
</P>
<P>
	She also claimed that during Kennedy's presidency she was  
Giancana's lover and carried messages between the president and the 
Chicago mob boss, including details of a plot to assassinate Cuban 
leader Fidel Castro. 
</P>
<P>
	Some have doubted that story, including Giancana's daughter,  
Antoinette, who has said her father had ``utter contempt'' for 
Kennedy and never mentioned any contact with the president during 
his time in the White House. 
</P>
<P>
	In a 1975 appearance before the U.S. Senate intelligence  
committee, Exner said she had an 18-month affair with Kennedy 
before and after he entered the White House, and that she later had 
an affair with Giancana. 
</P>
<P>
	But she said she knew of no ties between the two. Her lawyer,  
James Lesar, said in a statement that Exner lied to the Senate 
committee because she feared she would be killed, as Giancana had 
been months earlier.

</P>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Sigrid de Lima, who burst upon the New York  
literary scene in 1950 but withdrew from public life in mid-career, 
died Sept. 19 in Nyack. She was 77. 
</P>
<P>
	Her 1950 book ``Captain's Beach'' was met with mixed reviews  
that simultaneously proclaimed Ms. de Lima the next Hemingway, 
Dostoyevsky or Woolf or called her writing ``painfully studied and 
windy.'' The book, about threadbare survivors in a shabby New York 
rooming house, was the first published out of editor Hiram Haydn's 
prestigious workshop at the New School for Social Research. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1952 she published ``The Swift Cloud,'' about the murder of a  
disabled boy in a California town, and received the Prix de Rome in 
1953. 
</P>
<P>
	After her next book, ``Carnival by the Sea,'' (1954) critics  
generally agreed on her skills. But after two more books, ``Praise 
a Fine Day'' (1959) and ``Oriane'' (1968), she stopped writing for 
publication to spend time with her family. 
</P>
<P>
	Survivors include her husband and a daughter.

<P>
	DALLAS (AP) -- Ruth Ray Hunt, the second wife of storied Texas  
oil tycoon H.L. Hunt, died Saturday. She was 82. 
</P>
<P>
	Hunt, believed to be one of the richest men in the world when he  
died in 1974, married her in 1957 and adopted her four children 
after the death of his first wife. 
</P>
<P>
	Ruth Ray Hunt raised three daughters and a son. Her husband had  
six children by his first wife. 
</P>
<P>
	Known to her 17 grandchildren and three great-grandchildren as  
``Granny Ruth,'' Mrs. Hunt was known for her strong belief in 
family, deep religious convictions and the generosity of her 
spirit, family spokesman Jim Oberwetter said. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Hunt also was known for her philanthropy.  
</P>
<P>
	She would arrive unexpectedly at the bedside of hospitalized  
Hunt Oil Co. employees or their family members, returning day after 
day for visits that stretched into dozens of hours, Oberwetter 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	After those visits she sometimes stopped at the nurses' station  
to find out who hadn't had a visitor and spent the rest of the day 
with a stranger.

	VIENNA, Austria (AP) -- German linguist Karl H. Menges, who  
gained international recognition as an expert in Central Asian and 
Turkic languages, died Monday, the Austria Press Agency reported. 
He was 91. 
</P>
<P>
	When only 19-years-old, Menges was one of the first Westerners  
to penetrate the barely accessible Volga and Caucasus regions in 
the former Soviet Union. 
</P>
<P>
	He graduated from the University of Berlin in 1932, then moved  
to Czechoslovakia to escape the Nazi dictatorship. He later 
relocated to Turkey. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1940, he began teaching Altaic languages -- a group including  
30 Turkic, five Mongol and six Tungusic subgroups -- at Columbia 
University in New York. He stayed at the university for 36 years.

	Later, in 1976, he moved to Austria to become a professor at the  
University of Vienna.

extended illness. He was 65. 
</P>
<P>
	Pricer never lost a game as a Sooner. Oklahoma was 31-0 during  
Pricer's three varsity seasons. His era was part of the Oklahoma's 
NCAA-record 47-game winning streak. 
</P>
<P>
	Pricer shared the running assignments with halfbacks Tommy  
McDonald and Clendon Thomas. 
</P>
<P>
	He played five seasons in the pros. He was a backup on two of

	SANTA MONICA, Calif. (AP) -- Joe Shapiro, the former general  
counsel for Walt Disney Co. and husband of tennis champion Pam 
Shriver, died Thursday after battling non-Hodgkins lymphoma for 
nearly five years. 
</P>
<P>
	The Harvard-educated lawyer joined Disney in 1985 and worked as  
the chief negotiator in a series of lucrative deals and legal 
settlements. 
</P>
<P>
	Before that, Shapiro was a partner in the Los Angeles office of  
Donovan Leisure Newton &AMP; Irvine, which was Disney's regular outside 
counsel. 
</P>
<P>
	While employed by Disney, one of his most complicated duties was  
negotiating the construction, financing and operation of the $2.3 
billion Disneyland Paris hotel in France. 
</P>
<P>
	Shapiro also earned a reputation as a fierce opponent of the  
unauthorized use of Disney's cartoon characters. 
</P>
<P>
	He eventually became a Disney executive vice president, but left  
the company in 1994 when he was diagnosed with non-Hodgkins 
lymphoma. 
</P>
<P>
	He began dating Shriver, once the No. 3 tennis player in the

establishing quality controls for the food and drug industries, 
died Monday of complications from a stroke. He was 75. 
</P>
<P>
	After receiving his doctorate in food technology from the  
Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Shuster formed his own 
company, Herbert V. Shuster, Inc., in 1955. 
</P>
<P>
	Over the next 40 years, the company became a leader in research  
and development of consumer products, specializing in product 
testing for the food and drug industries. 
</P>
<P>
	Through his company, Shuster also began quality testing and  
control of private label products, which are made for stores to 
sell in competition with national brands. 
</P>
<P>
	The testing helped small- and medium-size food manufacturers  
compete by raising their quality standards and product uniformity. 
</P>
<P>
	Shuster sold his company to Hauser Chemical Research in 1995.  
Hauser named the new division Shuster Labs.

<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Charles Trinkaus, a leading scholar of the  
Renaissance and a longtime history professor, died on Sept. 15. He 
was 87. 
</P>
<P>
	Trinkaus played a role in the growth of Renaissance historical  
scholarship in North America in the 1940s and 1950s. His first 
book, ``Adversity's Noblemen: The Italian Humanists on Happiness,'' 
(1940) was acclaimed by scholars for its criticism of past academic 
views of Renaissance humanism. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1970 he published the two-volume work, ``In Our Image and  
Likeness: Humanity and Divinity in Italian Humanist Thought,'' 
which re-evaluated religious aspects of the Italian Renaissance. 
``Collected Works of Erasmus: Controversies,'' was published this 
year.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Said To Be In Good Health </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BETHESDA, Md. (AP) -- President Clinton has gained 18 pounds  
since his last complete physical examination but is in ``excellent 
health,'' a team of doctors reported Saturday. They said swollen 
vocal cords were causing his recent hoarseness and recommended he 
rest his voice. 
</P>
<P>
	The 53-year-old president, who has enjoyed generally good health  
since entering the White House in 1993, weighs 214 pounds, still 
within the normal range of up to 220 pounds for a 6-foot-2-inch 
man, said Clinton's physician, Dr. Connie Mariano. 
</P>
<P>
	``He would feel best and most fit if he could drop about 10  
pounds,'' White House press secretary Joe Lockhart told reporters 
outside the Bethesda Naval Medical Center. 
</P>
<P>
	Doctors recommended a low-calorie diet and more exercise, which  
Lockhart said Clinton's staff will try to help Clinton maintain. 
</P>
<P>
	Two small skin abnormalities were removed from Clinton's  
forehead in what doctors described as a routine precautionary 
treatment. Such skin conditions, typically caused by sun exposure, 
sometimes can become cancerous. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton's battery of tests took about five hours, and included  
checkups by 14 specialists, including a cardiologist, dermatologist 
and urologist. It was his fifth complete physical examination as 
president. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton has been bothered by a hoarse and raspy voice since  
returning from a trip to New Zealand in mid-September. His voice 
broke twice during a speech Tuesday to the United Nation's General 
Assembly, but seemed to improve a bit after a day with no public 
speaking engagements on Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	By Friday night, Clinton again was noticeably hoarse. He  
repeatedly cleared his throat during two evening political 
speeches. 
</P>
<P>
	The doctors diagnosed the swollen vocal cords caused in part by  
``voice overuse.'' The recommendation: Clinton rest his voice over 
the next 10 days, and no yelling at the television during sporting 
events. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton kept up on the Ryder Cup golf tournament during the  
testing regimen, Lockhart said. There was no word on the calorie 
count of the lunch the doctors shared with Clinton afterward -- 
chicken enchiladas with mango sorbet for dessert. 
</P>
<P>
	During his last physical, in October 1997, the president was  
fitted with in-the-ear hearing aids. They helped with a longtime 
problem that Clinton said made it difficult to understand voices in 
crowded receptions or sometimes even to catch what hecklers were 
shouting at him. 
</P>
<P>
	The 1997 medical team also removed a benign cyst from the  
president's chest and pronounced him fully recovered from an injury 
to his knee that hospitalized him for a few days early in the year. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton used crutches for months after tearing a tendon when he  
stumbled on steps at the Florida home of golf pro Greg Norman. 
</P>
<P>
	Over the years Clinton also has had an additional cyst removed  
from his neck and a precancerous skin lesion removed from his nose. 
Doctors described all of those conditions as common for a man his 
age. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton also has taken prescription medicine to inhibit severe  
heartburn known as acid reflux disease. He also has a number of 
allergies, including sensitivity to household dust and grass and 
weed pollen.

<HEADLINE> Asian Leaders Discuss Investment </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SINGAPORE (AP) -- Political turmoil in East Timor should not  
affect Southeast Asia's economic prospects, despite that the 
International Monetary Fund has effectively suspended aid programs 
to Indonesia, an Association of Southeast Asian Nations official 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have seen the worst in East Timor,'' Tay Thiam Peng of  
Singapore's Ministry for Trade and Industry said, adding that the 
breakaway province represents a ``political problem, not an 
economic one.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Tay's comments came as he announced that economic ministers from  
ASEAN will meet next week in Singapore to discuss how to attract 
investors and speed up implementation of a regional free trade 
area. 
</P>
<P>
	The ministers will meet Sept. 30 through Oct. 2.  
</P>
<P>
	The ministers' last meeting in Vietnam, in December was ``very  
gloomy,'' Tay said, as the region was suffering one of the worst 
economic crises in decades. Since then, most of the countries have 
demonstrated they are on the path to recovery. 
</P>
<P>
	Specifically, they will discuss how to speed up implementation  
of a trade agreement to have tariffs lowered to a maximum of 5 
percent in six founding ASEAN countries -- Thailand, Singapore, 
Malaysia, Indonesia, Brunei and the Philippines -- by 2002. 
</P>
<P>
	In Indonesia, Tay dismissed the role of IMF aid as just ``one of  
the factors'' in the country's economy. Indonesia's agriculture and 
exports have shown signs of marked recovery, he said.

<HEADLINE> Yahoo! Launches China Site </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BEIJING (AP) -- U.S. Internet company Yahoo! has launched a  
China-based Website with a local partner, defying concern about a 
ban on foreign investment in China's Internet companies. 
</P>
<P>
	The site is a Chinese-language version of Yahoo!'s online  
Internet directory and shopping service, according to Yahoo! and 
its partner, Beijing Founder Electronics Co. 
</P>
<P>
	Yahoo! China debuted Friday -- two weeks after China's top  
telecommunications regulator said Beijing would enforce its ban on 
foreign investment in Chinese Internet companies. 
</P>
<P>
	China is reluctant to let outsiders into what it regards as a  
lucrative and politically sensitive industry. 
</P>
<P>
	However, Beijing is expected to be forced to relax its ban to be  
admitted to the World Trade Organization, the global trade 
regulating body that China has been trying to join for 13 years. 
</P>
<P>
	Yahoo! and Beijing Founder would not give any financial details  
of their arrangement or say whether it had been approved by Chinese 
regulators. But they expressed confidence about the legal status of 
Yahoo! China. 
</P>
<P>
	``Certainly what we are proposing to do today is within the  
bounds of the law,'' Yahoo! co-founder Jerry Yang said at a news 
conference. 
</P>
<P>
	Yahoo! is one of the most popular Internet services, used by  
about 80 million people. Beijing Founder is a unit of Founder (Hong 
Kong) Ltd., a Chinese state-controlled electronics publishing 
company.

<HEADLINE> European Rookies Dazzle at Ryder  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BROOKLINE, Mass. (AP) -- The only disappointed Ryder Cup rookie  
was the only one on the American team. 
</P>
<P>
	And David Duval is no mere rookie -- he's the No. 2 ranked golfer  
in the world. 
</P>
<P>
	He was also on the bench as play started today, while Europe's  
rookies went out in search of more wins. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's just a beat off, a beat off,'' American captain Ben  
Crenshaw said of Duval. 
</P>
<P>
	If Duval was off, the European upstarts were more than on.  
</P>
<P>
	Sergio Garcia, the 19-year-old European version of Tiger Woods  
known as ``El Nino,'' wasn't the only rookie to stir the crowd 
Friday as Europe took a 6-2 lead in the first day of the 33rd Ryder 
Cup matches. Rookies contributed to the scoring in every match they 
played. 
</P>
<P>
	Garcia and Miguel Angel Jimenez of Spain, Paul Lawrie of  
Scotland and Padraig Harrington of Ireland helped the Europeans 
take a 2 1/2-1 1/2 lead in the opening foursome matches Friday, and then 
Lawrie, Garcia and Jimenez played key roles in the afternoon. 
</P>
<P>
	``We no longer have seven rookies,'' European team captain Mark  
James said after the morning matches. ``I think it will do the new 
boys some good.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In the most closely followed match of the morning, Garcia and  
Jesper Parnevik of Sweden defeated Woods and Tom Lehman 2 and 1. 
</P>
<P>
	Garcia and Woods, both trained in golf since age 3, were billed  
as the rivalry of the future, a feeling that intensified when 
Garcia and Woods fought it out last month in the PGA Championship. 
But Garcia said that didn't come into play. 
</P>
<P>
	``Here it's Europe against the USA, it's not Sergio against  
Tiger. Everybody needs to understand that,'' Garcia said. 
</P>
<P>
	The Europeans said they were nervous but didn't lose confidence  
even as the heavily favored Americans jumped to leads in three of 
the first four matches. 
</P>
<P>
	``I didn't feel cool inside, but after that first drive, it  
wasn't that bad, really,'' said Lawrie, who played with fellow Scot 
and Ryder Cup veteran Colin Montgomerie in the morning. They 
defeated Duval, America's only rookie, and Phil Mickelson 3 and 2. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're very disappointed,'' Duval said. ``The match certainly  
didn't seem like it should have been a 3 and 2 match.'' 
</P>
<P>
	While Lawrie played well in the match, it was Montgomerie, who  
often has been frustrated playing in the United States, who helped 
his partner allay the jitters by holing several key putts of 
6-to-10 feet. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's like a rock,'' Lawrie said of Montgomerie.  
</P>
<P>
	Payne Stewart and Davis Love III had several chances to put away  
the all-rookie team of Jimenez and Harrington in the morning, but 
managed only a draw worth a half-point. 
</P>
<P>
	``We played good and we got a halve out of it,'' Stewart said.  
``For two rookies, they played extremely well together.'' 
</P>
<P>
	It was more of the same in the afternoon, with European rookies  
playing in three of the four best ball matches. 
</P>
<P>
	Mickelson and Jim Furyk had a combined score of 60, yet lost to  
Garcia and Parvenik. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was very disappointing,'' said Mickelson, who missed an  
8-foot birdie putt on 18 that would have halved the match. 
</P>
<P>
	It was Parnevik, with four birdies and an eagle on the front  
nine, who kept the Europeans in that match until Garcia chipped in 
for eagle on the par-5, 14th for a 1-up lead that stood. 
</P>
<P>
	``A fantastic day,'' Garcia said. ``The rookies have done well.  
Sometimes the people say things that are wrong and we are trying to 
prove that and just trying to play the best we can.''

<HEADLINE> N.Ireland Peace Deal Strategy Sought </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BELFAST, Northern Ireland (AP) -- The two parties at the heart of  
Northern Ireland's political deadlock traveled in opposite 
directions Saturday to discuss, in private and among themselves, 
how to make their peace accord work. 
</P>
<P>
	The Ulster Unionists, who represent much of the province's  
British Protestant majority, traveled east to a Scottish hotel near 
Glasgow for a rare policy-making session outside Northern Ireland. 
Local media thwarted their efforts to keep the meeting 
confidential, though, spotting them at the Belfast ferry terminal. 
</P>
<P>
	Sinn Fein, the Irish Republican Army-linked party supported by  
militant Catholics, fared better with its own secret retreat. 
</P>
<P>
	Before switching off their mobile phones, spokesmen for the  
party -- whose name in Gaelic means ``ourselves alone'' -- described 
their location as somewhere in the remote west of the Irish 
Republic. 
</P>
<P>
	The separate strategy sessions came during a pause in efforts by  
former U.S. Sen. George Mitchell to broker a compromise between the 
two parties. Mitchell, who oversaw the negotiations that produced 
the Good Friday accord of 1998, is scheduled to resume his Belfast 
mission next Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	For more than a year, the Ulster Unionists have refused to form  
a four-party Cabinet for Northern Ireland as proposed by the 
accord. They insist the IRA must start to disarm -- another goal 
contained in the accord -- before they will accept Sinn Fein as 
government colleagues. 
</P>
<P>
	The IRA has rejected the accord's disarmament section. Sinn Fein  
negotiators insist they should receive two of the administration's 
12 posts regardless of IRA policy. 
</P>
<P>
	In a demonstration of the pressures facing Ulster Unionist  
leader David Trimble, several hundred Protestants opposed to Sinn 
Fein marched Saturday through downtown Belfast beneath a banner 
reading ``No terrorists in government.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In Glasgow, the Ulster Unionists were debating whether to form  
an administration that includes Sinn Fein. Moderates within the 
party were floating the idea on the condition that they also 
threatened in advance to resign from the government -- ensuring its 
collapse -- if the IRA did not start disarming within one month. 
</P>
<P>
	Appointing Sinn Fein to administration posts would require  
near-unanimous support from Trimble's 27 Ulster Unionist colleagues 
inside Northern Ireland's legislature, which is the only branch of 
government yet established under terms of the accord. 
</P>
<P>
	Trimble invited all of this party's legislators to the Glasgow  
meeting. But in a sign of simmering divisions, deputy leader John 
Taylor declined to attend. 
</P>
<P>
	Earlier this month Taylor, who had been widely tipped to be a  
Cabinet member, announced he was certain the IRA would not disarm 
and so there was no point in even meeting Mitchell.

<HEADLINE> Rogers Has 'Modest' Home for Sale </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ATHENS, Ga. (AP) -- It's time for a change, so Kenny Rogers is  
putting his modest little home up for sale at auction. 
</P>
<P>
	Beaver Dam Farms, a 360-acre estate about 8 miles northeast of  
Athens, has a 32-room main house that Rogers designed and decorated 
himself, plus a guest house with two separate living quarters. 
</P>
<P>
	It also has its own 18-hole, par-72 golf course, two horse barns  
with a total of 56 stalls, its own lakefront beach and waterfall, 
and a lake house with floating deck. 
</P>
<P>
	Prospective bidders for the Nov. 4 auction will have to produce  
a $250,000 cashier's check to prove they're serious, but there is 
no minimum opening bid. 
</P>
<P>
	``Kenny never expressed any concern over the price,'' said  
William Bone, president of National Auction Group, the Alabama 
company handling the auction. 
</P>
<P>
	Rogers has said he's selling because he and his wife want to  
live closer to Atlanta. 
</P>
<P>
	``As much as I've enjoyed my years here, I've discovered that  
for me the thrill is in the creation,'' he said in a statement. 
``Now I'm anxious to move on and build something else.''

<HEADLINE> Ryder Cup Hecklers Target Monty  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BROOKLINE, Mass. (AP) -- With crowds better suited for Fenway  
Park's boisterous bleachers than fairways at The Country Club, 
Ryder Cup fans targeted Colin Montgomerie on Saturday to try to 
rattle the Scottish sourpuss and revive the struggling American 
side. 
</P>
<P>
	Twice during the day, Montgomerie backed off after lining up  
over a putt when someone in the crowd distracted him. In the 
morning, after being heckled on the sixth green, he sank a six-foot 
putt to win the hole, then thrust his fist toward the bleachers in 
triumph. 
</P>
<P>
	On the 18th hole of the last match, with a crucial point on the  
line, Miguel Angel Jimenez had to step away after someone yelled as 
he prepared to putt. He missed the shot, and the hole and the match 
were halved. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's slightly unfair sometimes before we play our shots, to be  
honest with you,'' Montgomerie said, accusing the American players 
of intentionally ``geeing up'' the crowd. ``But at the same time, 
they have home advantage and you know that's to be expected.'' 
</P>
<P>
	For Montgomerie, who it's more like a given.  
</P>
<P>
	The elder statesman of the European team has been a frequent  
target of galleries throughout his career, and it's been more of 
the same during this Ryder Cup. It doesn't help that he bears an 
uncanny resemblance to Bill Parcells, who coached the hometown New 
England Patriots to the Super Bowl before jilting the team and 
region to join the hated New York Jets. 
</P>
<P>
	Catcalls of ``Tuna!'' -- Parcells' nickname -- and ``Mrs.  
Doubtfire,'' because of Montgomerie's resemblance to the Robin 
Williams movie character, have followed Montgomerie through each of 
his four matches. But if the 36-year-old veteran of five Ryder Cups 
was feeling picked on, one man stationed along the 15th fairway 
tried to set him straight. 
</P>
<P>
	``We don't hate you Monty,'' the fan bellowed. ``We just want  
you to lose.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He did -- in the morning -- as Hal Sutton and Jeff Maggert beat  
Montgomerie and Paul Lawrie 1-up in alternate shot. But the two 
Europeans came back to win in the afternoon, beating Steve Pate and 
Tiger Woods 2 and 1 in fourball to help give the visitors a 10-6 
lead going into the final day; Europe needs just four wins in 12 
singles matches on Sunday to retain the Cup. 
</P>
<P>
	``You know we've won (when) it's silent,'' Montgomerie said.  
``Great. And that's the best thing we can do -- silence the crowd by 
outplaying them.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Golf fans have never been known for their rowdiness -- at least  
not in the way that soccer fans are; the only golf riot of any 
substance was the movie ``Caddyshack.'' In golf etiquette, it's 
considered OK to cheer for a nice shot, but not when an opponent 
makes a bad one. 
</P>
<P>
	But when the nationalistic fervor of the Ryder Cup combines with  
too many gin and tonics, galleries have at times become downright 
rude. 
</P>
<P>
	The low point, at least as far as the Ryder Cup is concerned, is  
generally considered ``The War by the Shore'' in 1991 at Kiawah 
Island, S.C., when U.S. players donned camouflage and fans jeered 
the Europeans at every turn. Since then, though, the captains have 
tried to avoid inflaming the crowds, and there hasn't been any 
trouble of note. 
</P>
<P>
	If anything, the galleries at The Country Club may have been too  
polite. The crowds following the European twosome of teen sensation 
Sergio Garcia and mad hatter Jesper Parnevik may have even been 
slanted toward the visitors' side. 
</P>
<P>
	``They like us and that's very good,'' Garcia agreed after the  
pair improved to 3-0 with a 3 and 2 victory over Payne Stewart and 
Justin Leonard. ``They're taking good care of us.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Sutton did his part to win the crowd back for the American side,  
waving his arms at the gallery on the 13th fairway and drawing a 
big cheer in response. Sutton, from Bossier City, La., said he 
doesn't think there's anything wrong with a little home-course 
advantage, as long as it's not disruptive. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't want them to call out to Colin. What I wanted them to  
do was get behind us,'' he said. ``I want everybody to be treated 
with respect. But it's in the U.S.A., and I guarantee you they 
cheer for them over there.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Many players, reporters and fans who have witnessed Ryder Cups  
in Europe agreed that the U.S. crowd was much more sedate than 
those on the continent. But Lawrie insisted that the European 
crowds always know when, and not just what, to cheer. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Doubtfire, meet Miss Manners.  
</P>
<P>
	``Their behavior was just ridiculous,'' Lawrie said. ``I don't  
mind it when we've both played, but to do it before the next 
opponent his a shot, then it's just not on. 
</P>
<P>
	``If it means that much to them, then all the best to them.''  
</P>
<P>
	In general, though, the cheers were good-natured and at the  
appropriate time. There were far more people shouting ``Nice 
shot,'' and ``U.S.A.,'' than there were hecklers. But there were 
some problems, and many of them revolved around Montgomerie. He had 
to back off a putt on No. 6 in the morning match, and again heard 
catcalls while taking his practice swings on the eighth tee. 
</P>
<P>
	On No. 13, someone yelled, ``Shank it!'' as Montgomerie was  
contemplating a shot from the fairway. After the shot, another fan 
yelled, ``You're going down!'' 
</P>
<P>
	In the afternoon, he backed off a putt on No. 8 after a camera  
flashed in the crowd. Again, he sank it, but this time he merely 
cast a menacing glance in the offending direction. 
</P>
<P>
	Perhaps Montgomerie could take some solace in the fact that the  
hecklers didn't use up all their material on him. Even some of 
Americans were targets: David Duval was jeered on Friday for his 
mediocre performance and for his part in igniting a controversy 
over whether the golfers should be paid for playing for their 
country. 
</P>

<HEADLINE> GOP Restores Ban on Faulty Reactor </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- On second thought, Republicans decided to  
continue barring the reopening of a leaking nuclear reactor in the 
district of a New York congressman who abandoned the GOP for the 
Democratic Party two months ago. 
</P>
<P>
	On Friday morning, a tentative House-Senate compromise bill  
financing next year's federal water and energy projects omitted the 
ban against restarting the Brookhaven National Laboratory's 
experimental reactor on New York's Long Island. The ban has been in 
law the last two years and was included in separate House and 
Senate versions of this year's bill. 
</P>
<P>
	But by afternoon, the prohibition was reinstated. That occurred  
after a private, bipartisan meeting in which Rep. David Obey, 
D-Wis., insisted on its inclusion, said officials who spoke on 
condition of anonymity. 
</P>
<P>
	``We regarded it as highly unusual and punitive for them to take  
out a provision that was in both bills'' earlier this year, Obey 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	The 34-year-old lab is in the district of Rep. Mike Forbes,  
D-N.Y., who said when he left the party last summer that the GOP 
had been captured by ``extremists.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm sure it was a tragic oversight,'' Forbes told a reporter  
when asked if he believed the omission was an attempt at political 
retribution. 
</P>
<P>
	The reactor has been a major issue on Long Island since the  
Energy Department revealed in 1997 that radioactive tritium had 
been leaking and contaminating ground water at least since 1985. 
</P>
<P>
	Forbes, along with former Sen. Alfonse D'Amato, R-N.Y., has long  
sponsored the annual language that has kept the reactor shut. 
</P>
<P>
	Forbes attended Friday's bargaining session and told his  
colleagues that removal of the Brookhaven language left him ``a 
little bit mystified.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Rep. Ron Packard, R-Calif., chairman of the House Appropriations  
subcommittee that wrote the bill, said environmental concerns 
Republicans had about the reactor had been resolved. 
</P>
<P>
	The reactor, used for advanced research in physics, medicine and  
other fields, has been out of commission since December 1996 
because of leaks of radioactive water from a spent fuel tank.

<HEADLINE> NYC Searches Abuser Medical Records </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- City officials plan to start searching welfare  
recipients' medical records for evidence of drug use in an effort 
to funnel abusers into treatment programs, The New York Times 
reported today. 
</P>
<P>
	For such abusers, the treatment program would be a mandatory  
condition for receiving public assistance. 
</P>
<P>
	Officials say checks are needed because the city's current drug  
screening system is finding unrealistically low substance abuse 
rates. 
</P>
<P>
	But Paul N. Samuels, director of the nonprofit advocacy group  
Legal Action Center, said the search would be an invasion of 
privacy, ``that will upset just about everybody.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Violating confidentiality is an ambush that will drive many  
people away from treatment,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Jason A. Turner, commissioner of the city's Human Resources  
Administration, said information would be collected from 
computerized Medicaid insurance bills submitted for applicants who 
have voluntarily sought substance abuse treatment. 
</P>
<P>
	``These are our own records,'' Turner said. ``We are not  
interfering with the doctor-patient relationship. We're helping 
poor people.'' 
</P>
<P>
	No date has been set to begin the review.  
</P>
<P>
	With few exceptions, a federal law passed in the 1970s bars the  
disclosure of information on patients in drug and alcohol treatment 
programs without the patient's narrowly defined written consent. 
That consent does not allow redisclosure for any other purpose. 
</P>
<P>
	Christopher H. Peacock, spokesman for the Federal Health Care  
Financing Administration, which oversees Medicaid records, said he 
had not received official notification of the plan. 
</P>
<P>
	``But there are confidentiality provisions in New York's  
Medicaid plan, and we expect them to be followed,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> Scratch Pad Wins Brave Raj Stakes </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MIAMI (AP) -- Scratch Pad beat favored Fast Dispersal by 4 1/2  
lengths in the co-featured $100,000 Brave Raj Stakes for 2-year-old 
fillies at Calder Race Course on Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
	In the $100,000 Foolish Pleasure Stakes for 2-year-old colts,  
unbeaten U So Bad edged Elite Mercedes. 
</P>
<P>
	Both stakes were one mile on a sloppy track.  
</P>
<P>
	Scratch Pad, ridden by Eibar Coa, was timed in 1:40 3/5 and paid  
$12.40, $5.60 and $3.80. Fast Dispersal, the 2-1 choice, paid $3.80 
and $2.60. Just Right Ashley rallied to finish third and paid 
$5.40. 
</P>
<P>
	U So Bad, ridden by William Henry, caught long shot Elite  
Mercedes in the final strides to win the Foolish Pleasure by a neck 
with Megacles third. 
</P>
<P>
	U So Bad was timed in 1:39 4/5 and paid $17.20, $6.60 and $5.60.  
Elite Mercedes paid $14.60 and $8.20, while Megacles paid $6.60 to 
show. 
</P>
<P>
	Ells End, the 8-5 favorite, finished eighth.  
</P>
<P>
	Miss Vermont Jet set the pace in the Brave Raj. Fast Dispersal  
moved into second on the rail at the half-mile pole. Scratch Pad 
was sixth and Just Right Ashley seventh. 
</P>
<P>
	Turning for home, Miss Vermont Jet led Fast Dispersal by a  
half-length as Scratch Pad rallied between horses. Fast Dispersal 
put away Miss Vermont Jet but was no match for Scratch Pad. The 
latter took the lead on the outside at the eighth pole and drew out 
with every stride. Fast Dispersal was second, 2 1/2 lengths in front 
of Just Right Ashley. 
</P>
<P>
	The winner is a Florida-bred daughter of Notebook owned by Jaime  
Carrion. She finished fourth and third in her first two starts, but 
broke her maiden by 9 3/4 lengths at Calder -- at one mile -- on Sept. 
4, leading all the way. In the Brave Raj she showed she can come 
from off the pace and nearly quadrupled her earnings, from $21,000 
to $81,000. 
</P>
<P>
	Elite Mercedes led almost all the way in the Foolish Pleasure. U  
So Bad was sixth turning down the backstretch and was fourth, six 
lengths off the pace, on the far turn as Elite Mercedes led by 2 1/2 
lengths over Megacles. 
</P>
<P>
	At the top of the stretch, Elite Mercedes led Megacles by two  
lengths and U So Bad was fifth on the outside. 
</P>
<P>
	Elite Mercedes, on the rail, held on gamely through the drive,  
but U So Bad -- in the middle of the track -- caught him at the wire. 
Megacles was 1 1/2 lengths behind Elite Mercedes and a head in front 
of BL's Appeal. 
</P>
<P>
	U So Bad, who ran for a $40,000 claiming price in his first  
start, is 3-for-3, closing strongly each time. The Foolish Pleasure 
was his first stakes and the victory raised his earnings from 
$22,700 to $82,700. The Kentucky-bred daughter of Skywalker is 
owned by Jack Damico, Albert Fleming and William Poston.

<HEADLINE> Georgia Assistant Pat Watson Dies </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ATHENS, Ga. (AP) -- Pat Watson, an offensive line coach for  
11th-ranked Georgia, died Saturday night, apparently of a heart 
attack. 
</P>
<P>
	Watson, 56, died a few hours after Georgia's 24-23 victory over  
Central Florida. 
</P>
<P>
	Watson experienced discomfort at home after the game and was  
taken to St. Mary's Hospital, where he died Saturday night, 
according to Claude Felton, Georgia's associate athletic director. 
</P>
<P>
	Georgia coach Jim Donnan told The Athens Banner-Herald he would  
reserve comment. He spent Saturday night and early Sunday trying to 
track down his players and Watson's friends. 
</P>
<P>
	Georgia cornerback Jeff Harris told the paper he first heard of  
Watson's death from a teammate. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm not sure what happened,'' Harris said. ``It's kind of a  
shock. We've just been calling each other and telling each person 
on the team the news. It's really sad. Not only was he a good coach 
that always thought of the team, but he was a good person. It hurts 
to lose such a guy.'' 
</P>
<P>
	This was Wastson's second season with the team. He joined the  
staff in 1998 as a defensive ends coach. Watson moved over to the 
offensive line this year when Chris Scelfo left for Tulane. 
</P>
<P>
	Watson, a coach for 32 years, was a graduate assistant at North  
Carolina in 1967 and was also an assistant at Furman (1969), 
Mississippi State (1970-71), North Carolina (1972-77), Virginia 
Tech (1978-86), Georgia Tech (1987-91 and 1995-96) and Texas 
(1992-94). 
</P>
<P>
	Watson, a native of Meridian, Miss., was a lineman at  
Mississippi State from 1961-64 and then played two years in the 
CFL. 
</P>
<P>
	Watson is survived by his wife, Freddie, and children, Jane and  
Cal.

                         *Stanley Fleishman    	
</P>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Stanley Fleishman, who championed the rights  
of disabled people and won a ruling in which the state Supreme 
Court found that Henry Miller's book ``Tropic of Cancer'' was not 
obscene, died Thursday of pneumonia and complications from surgery. 
He was 79. 
</P>
<P>
	Fleishman, who was disabled by polio when he was 1, was a  
familiar site in court with his crutches when he stood to argue his 
cases on such divergent subjects as public access rights for the 
disabled and free-speech rights for the makers of adult films. 
</P>
<P>
	Facing deteriorating health, he used a wheelchair for the first  
time two months ago when he took his last case before the 9th U.S. 
Circuit Court of Appeals, said Barry Fisher, his partner in the 
Fleishman &AMP; Fisher public interest law firm. 
</P>
<P>
	The more controversial free-speech cases he took on included  
Miller's once-banned book ``Tropic of Cancer''; the adult movie 
``Deep Throat''; and the rights of the Pussycat adult theater 
chain. 
</P>
<P>
	It was during his work on behalf of ``Deep Throat,'' that he  
observed people in wheelchairs were being excluded from juries for 
not being ``in possession of their faculties.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He argued successfully to have them included in juries, along  
with blind and deaf people, and followed that up with lawsuits 
seeking access for the disabled to jobs, airlines, public 
buildings, restaurants and hotels. 
</P>
<P>
	His work brought him honors from everyone from Playboy  
Magazine's Hugh Hefner to advocates for the disabled.

<P>
	SAN PABLO, Calif. (AP) -- Mignon Garland, a dancer who carried on  
the legacy of Isadora Duncan in the United States, died Sept. 15 at 
the age of 91. 
</P>
<P>
	Duncan helped pioneer modern dance by turning away from ballet  
and looking to ancient Greece for inspiration. She died in 1927. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Garland, born in Brooklyn, N.Y., decided to devote her life  
to dance that year after attending a performance by Duncan's 
disciples. 
</P>
<P>
	In the 1930s and 40s, Ms. Garland toured with the Minneapolis  
Symphony, danced in Moscow and New York, founded several dance 
companies and was dance editor of New Theater magazine.

</P>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Charles Trinkaus, a leading scholar of the  
Renaissance and a longtime history professor, died on Sept. 15. He 
was 87. 
</P>
<P>
	Trinkaus played a role in the growth of Renaissance historical  
scholarship in North America in the 1940s and 1950s. His first 
book, ``Adversity's Noblemen: The Italian Humanists on Happiness,'' 
(1940) was acclaimed by scholars for its criticism of past academic 
views of Renaissance humanism. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1970 he published the two volume work ``In Our Image and  
Likeness: Humanity and Divinity in Italian Humanist Thought,'' 
which reevaluated religious aspects of the Italian Renaissance. 
``Collected Works of Erasmus: Controversies,'' was published this 
year. 
</P>
<P>
	Trinkaus, who received a bachelor's degree from Wesleyan  
University and a doctorate from Columbia University, began teaching 
at Sarah Lawrence College in 1936. A former president of the 
Renaissance Society of America, he taught at the University of 
Michigan from 1970 to 1982.

<HEADLINE> Attack Part of Brewers' Odd Year </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MILWAUKEE (AP) -- A fan's attack on Houston Astros right fielder  
Bill Spiers was the latest event in what has turned out to be a 
strange season for the Milwaukee Brewers. 
</P>
<P>
	The manager has been fired and the general manager replaced. The  
dreams of opening a new stadium next April have crumbled, delayed a 
year after a construction accident killed three ironworkers. 
</P>
<P>
	All this as the Brewers head for their seventh consecutive  
losing season. 
</P>
<P>
	Things turned very strange Friday night during the sixth inning.  
With the Astros leading 2-1, a spectator suddenly went on the field 
and jumped on the unsuspecting Spiers from behind. 
</P>
<P>
	``To run out there and attack a player the way he did was  
unbelievable,'' Brewers interim manager Jim Lefebvre said. 
``Strange things have happened before, like the man stabbing Monica 
Seles. Obviously from now on, we have to think about it. 
</P>
<P>
	``In all my years of baseball, I've never heard or seen anything  
like that. To be honest, it's almost horrifying. It was just a 
terrible, isolated incident.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The fan, a 23-year-old from South Beloit, Ill., approached  
Spiers from behind. According to a Brewers player who was in the 
bullpen, the man grabbed Spiers with his left hand and seemed 
intent on getting a piggyback ride. 
</P>
<P>
	``He jumped on his back,'' Milwaukee pitcher David Weathers  
said. ``He put his left arm around him and started hitting him on 
the behind with his right hand ... like he was riding a horse.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Robert Beaudoin of Milwaukee, who has attended 61 home games  
this year, said Brewers fans have come to expect the unexpected. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't know what's up with a guy like that, but the way this  
season has gone, just about anything can happen here,'' he said. 
``I'll be glad when this season's over.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Laurel Prieb, vice president of corporate affairs for the  
Brewers, said it would be foolish to equate this incident with 
anything that has happened earlier this season. Like Lefebvre, he 
called it ``totally isolated.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``It was unfortunate,'' Preib said. ``It was an isolated  
incident in which the individual jumped over the fence and onto the 
field. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have terrific fans and a very good staff here,'' Prieb  
said. ``Our security reacted as quickly as could be. I won't even 
know what to guess as to why it happened. I just know Bill Spiers 
is one of the nicest guys in the world.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The spectator was taken into custody pending possible charges.  
None had been filed as of Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
	Spiers said the incident left him with a sore neck, and he  
planned to sit out Saturday night's game. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm not going to play because of what happened last night,''  
he said. ``I have a sore neck -- nothing major.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He wasn't certain whether he would play Sunday but was certain  
the incident won't deter the Astros in their drive to the NL 
Central pennant. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't know if I'll play,'' he said. ``We'll see. But this  
won't affect us in any way.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Spiers, who played six seasons with the Brewers, said he didn't  
consider it a personal attack. 
</P>
<P>
	``They're courteous, genuine people here,'' he said. ``I've  
always said they're just like people down south. I enjoyed my years 
here -- definitely -- so I don't think it was aimed specifically at 
me.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Lefebvre added, ``The fans here will boo you, but they're great  
baseball fans and they love their team. You can't blame the 
Milwaukee fans.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Lefebvre said there was a report that the Illinois fan told his  
friends that Milwaukee right fielder Jeromy Burnitz was his target. 
</P>
<P>
	``He apparently wanted to hug and run with Burnie,'' Lefebvre  
said. ``It turned into more than that and the way to stop it is to 
prosecute to the full extent of the law. They (police) will know 
what to do.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Burnitz said, ``I'm glad he didn't do it to me. We've seen it  
before, but never anything like that. Anybody comes near me, I'll 
be sidestepping him.''

<HEADLINE> JFK Jr.'s Will Made Public </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- The three children of Caroline Kennedy  
Schlossberg have inherited John F. Kennedy Jr.'s personal property, 
along with some of his multi-million dollar trust. 
</P>
<P>
	Kennedy's will for his estate, estimated to be worth between $30  
million and $100 million, was filed Friday in Manhattan Surrogate 
Court. 
</P>
<P>
	The document, signed Dec. 19, 1997, leaves Kennedy's personal  
property to the children of Edwin and Caroline Kennedy Schlossberg, 
his brother-in-law and sister. The children are Rose Kennedy 
Schlossberg, 11, Tatiana C. Kennedy Schlossberg, 9, and John B. 
Kennedy Schlossberg, 6. 
</P>
<P>
	There was no mention of his magazine George or how his interest  
in it should be handled. 
</P>
<P>
	Kennedy, 38, his wife Carolyn Bessette Kennedy, 33, and her  
sister Lauren Bessette, 34, died after the single-engine Piper 
Saratoga airplane he was piloting plunged 1,100 feet into the 
waters off Martha's Vineyard on July 16. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition to inheriting all of his personal property, the  
children receive bequests under his 1983 trust. 
</P>
<P>
	Anthony Stanislaus Radziwill, Kennedy's first cousin, was named  
as executor, but another Kennedy cousin, Timothy P. Shriver, was 
named to perform those duties after Radziwill's death last month 
from cancer. 
</P>
<P>
	Kennedy, son of the nation's 35th president, also left financial  
bequests under his 1983 trust to people who had worked for his 
parents. 
</P>
<P>
	They include Ephigenia Pinheiro, the personal assistant to his  
mother, Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis, and Marta Sgubin, a former 
Kennedy family cook and governess to him and Caroline. 
</P>
<P>
	Another beneficiary under the trust is Rosemarie Terenzio,  
Kennedy's assistant at George, the social and political-interest 
magazine he founded. 
</P>
<P>
	Kennedy also left money to charities and institutions, including  
Reaching Up Inc., a New York organization for the mentally 
disabled, and the John Fitzgerald Kennedy Library Foundation Inc. 
in Boston.

<HEADLINE> Teen Gunman Could Be Free by Age 42 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	EUGENE, Ore. (AP) -- Teen-aged gunman Kip Kinkel, who killed his  
parents and gunned down two classmates at school, could be set free 
from prison by age 42 under a plea deal reached with prosecutors. 
</P>
<P>
	Kinkel on Friday dropped an insanity defense and pleaded guilty  
to four counts of murder and 26 counts of attempted murder. 
</P>
<P>
	``My mind is clear and I am not sick,'' read the text of the  
plea agreement signed by the 17-year-old Kinkel. He sat slumped in 
a chair in court and never lifted his head as he read each 
paragraph silently and initialed it ``KK.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Kinkel was to go to trial Monday for the May 21, 1998, attack at  
Springfield's Thurston High School -- one in a string of school 
shootings that include Pearl, Miss., Paducah, Ky., Jonesboro, Ark., 
and Littleton, Colo. 
</P>
<P>
	Under the agreement, he will get a total of 25 years for the  
murders. Prosecutors have recommended 7 1/2 years for each attempted 
murder count for the 25 students he wounded and a detective he 
attacked with a knife. The judge will decide whether those 
sentences will be tacked onto the end of the 25-year sentence or 
run concurrently. 
</P>
<P>
	If he had been convicted as charged, he could have faced life in  
prison without parole. Because Kinkel was 15 at the time of the 
slayings, he could not have faced the death penalty. 
</P>
<P>
	Lawyers are to meet Monday to set a date for a sentencing  
hearing that could last one to three weeks. 
</P>
<P>
	Defense lawyers had hoped to spare Kinkel a life sentence by  
proving he was mentally disturbed. If they had succeeded, Kinkel 
would have been confined to a mental hospital until he was no 
longer deemed a danger to society. 
</P>
<P>
	District Attorney Doug Harcleroad called the deal ``the best  
thing for the community'' and refused to comment on the possibility 
of a 25-year sentence. He noted that survivors of the attack will 
get a chance to speak before Kinkel is sentenced. 
</P>
<P>
	Among those in court for Friday's proceedings was Teresa  
Miltonburger, who was shot in the head during the rampage. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's going to jail,'' she said. ``It works for me.''  
</P>
<P>
	She had planned to attend every day of the trial, but the guilty  
pleas came as a relief. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is my senior year. This is my year to have fun. I'm glad  
to have it over,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	Kinkel told investigators he had ``no choice'' but to kill  
because he had embarrassed his parents by getting expelled for 
having a gun in his locker. He said he thought he was a 
disappointment to his parents. 
</P>
<P>
	``I had to be 100 percent,'' Kinkel told a psychologist. ``No  
one is perfect though. Lots of times, life sucked. With my parents, 
if I didn't do the best, I was an embarrassment to my parents.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Kinkel shot his parents in their home. The following morning, he  
dressed in a trench coat, walked into the cafeteria just before 
classes and opened fire with a semiautomatic rifle. He squeezed off 
50 rounds in 90 seconds, killing Ben Walker, 16, and Mikael 
Nickolauson, 17. 
</P>
<P>
	Several classmates tackled Kinkel as he tried to reload. Later,  
in a jail interview room, Kinkel lunged at a detective with a knife 
that had been taped to his leg and begged police to kill him. 
</P>
<P>
	In a statement released Friday by her lawyer, Kinkel's sister,  
Kristin, 22, said she hoped the plea agreement will mean her 
brother will get the help he needs. 
</P>
<P>
	``I am very sad, but relieved,'' the statement said. ``Sad that  
this day had to even happen. Sad that there are so many innocent 
victims. Sad that I lost another member of my family. But relieved 
that the painful memories of those tragic events of 16 months ago 
will not be revived by a trial.''

<HEADLINE> Bob Barker Recovers From Surgery </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Game show host Bob Barker is ready to head  
back home to California after undergoing surgery to clear a blocked 
artery in his neck. 
</P>
<P>
	The ``Price Is Right'' host planned to check out today from  
George Washington University Hospital, where he was admitted Sept. 
16 after complaining of fatigue. Tests later revealed his left 
carotid artery was 85 percent blocked. 
</P>
<P>
	Barker, 75, underwent the surgery Monday.  
</P>
<P>
	``Mr. Barker is experiencing a good recovery from surgery and  
will now need to go home and rest,'' his neurosurgeon, Dr. Anthony 
Caputy, said in a statement. 
</P>
<P>
	A longtime animal rights activist, Barker was in Washington to  
lobby for a bill that would ban circuses from using elephants. 
</P>
<P>
	His illness is not expected to interfere with production of his  
CBS daytime show because it is taped well in advance. Barker has 
been host of the program since 1972.

<HEADLINE> Firefighters Battle Calif. Blazes </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BIG SUR, Calif. (AP) -- Hot weather and drier conditions had  
firefighters stepping up efforts to battle large wildfires on the 
central coast and in Northern California. 
</P>
<P>
	In the Trinity Alps Wilderness, about 200 miles north of San  
Francisco, two fires had burned 57,265 acres as of Saturday 
morning. 
</P>
<P>
	Heavy smoke was restricting air operations, and steep, rugged  
terrain was hampering firefighters' efforts to construct fire 
lines, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
	Firefighters were working in high temperatures to widen fire  
lines in anticipation of a cold front, which was expected to bring 
winds of 30-40 mph on Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	The fires, started by lightning strikes, threaten several Native  
American cultural sites. Firefighters have agreed not to build fire 
lines through an area considered sacred by the Hupa Nation. 
</P>
<P>
	To the south in Big Sur, three fires in the Ventana Wilderness  
of the Los Padres National Forest had burned 40,197 acres by 
Saturday morning, fire officials said. 
</P>
<P>
	Firefighters were aided Friday by cooler temperatures and high  
humidity, gaining 30 percent containment over the largest blaze, 
dubbed the Tassajara Fire. It had burned 26,059 acres. 
</P>
<P>
	But warmer and drier weather Saturday threatened to bring  
increased fire activity, especially in the late afternoon, 
officials said.

<HEADLINE> Pentathlon Champ Gets Olympic Spot </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SYDNEY, Australia (AP) -- World men's modern pentathlon champion  
Sebastien Deleigne of France assured himself of a place at next 
year's Olympics with a victory in the World Cup final Saturday at 
Homebush Bay. 
</P>
<P>
	Deleigne won the 1997 and 1998 world titles, but finished fifth  
in Budapest last July when Hungarian Gabor Balogh won the world 
championship. 
</P>
<P>
	The 32-year-old Deleigne became the third to qualify for the  
Olympics after Balogh and another Hungarian, Peter Sarfalvi, the 
European champion. 
</P>
<P>
	Deleigne notched the highest score in the next-to-last riding  
discipline and the second-best total in the closing 3-kilometer run 
at the Olympic test event. 
</P>
<P>
	He started the run in third place, 22 seconds and 91 points  
behind competition leader Per-Olov Danielsson of Sweden, but caught 
the 30-year-old Swede after two of the four laps and won by 40 
seconds. 
</P>
<P>
	Deleigne had 5,408 points to finish ahead of Danielsson with  
5,339 and Russian Alexei Tourkin with 5,286.

<HEADLINE> Excerpt From Reagan Biography </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	Ronald Reagan's diary entry from July 18, 1985, when he lay in  
hospital recovering from colon cancer surgery and by some accounts 
authorized national security adviser Robert ``Bud'' McFarlane to 
make secret contact with Iranians in what later became known as the 
Iran-Contra affair. 
</P>
<P>
	The entry is in ``Dutch: A Memoir of Ronald Reagan,'' an  
authorized biography written by Edmund Morris and published by 
Random House. A copy of the book was obtained by The Associated 
Press. It is being released Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	``What a morning -- the Dr. took the metal clips out of my  
incision -- what an improvement that made ... he told me he'd take 
the feeding tubes out before lunch and he did. Such a feeling of 
freedom. ... 
</P>
<P>
	``Nancy and I had lunch, I find that I can only eat a few  
mouthfuls. A lot of cards and messages to look at. Then around 4:30 
p.m. a wave out of the window to the press and down to X-Ray.

<HEADLINE> Atwood Wins Crash-Filled MBNA Gold </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DOVER, Del. (AP) -- When the green flag drops Sunday to start the  
MBNA Gold 400, Rusty Wallace might take off and establish a 
substantial lead. 
</P>
<P>
	But no one should be mistaken about his intentions. He'll be  
doing what every driver knows is necessary at Dover Downs 
International Speedway. 
</P>
<P>
	The other 42 cars will not be the immediate competition for the  
polesitter. What Wallace will need to concern himself with is The 
Monster Mile. 
</P>
<P>
	``You have to race the track and the track changes,'' Wallace  
said. ``It generally gets tighter as the day goes on and you have 
to keep up with it, keep making changes throughout the race.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Wallace, seeking a career milestone 50th victory and fourth on  
the high-banked oval, knows attrition and late-race problems might 
mean those who were strong at the start might not be in contention 
at the end. 
</P>
<P>
	``You don't know who the real competition is until late in the  
race,'' he said. ``Bobby Labonte didn't think he had a chance to 
win the last time we were here, but he did.'' 
</P>
<P>
	After suffering though some difficult times with ill-handling  
and unreliable cars the past two seasons, the 1989 Winston Cup 
champion is starting to show some of the qualities that made him 
one of the most dominant cars just a few seasons ago. 
</P>
<P>
	The pole Sunday, the result of a track-record qualifying speed  
of 159.964 mph, is the second in a row for Wallace. He dominated 
the first half of the Dura Lube 300 a week ago in New Hampshire, 
but wound up sixth. 
</P>
<P>
	Even with most of the agonizing problems of the past little more  
than a bad memory now, Wallace still doesn't run strong near the 
end. 
</P>
<P>
	``The handling goes away, and we know it,'' Wallace said. ``We  
used to have trouble qualifying and then run great, and now we're 
qualifying well and not running like we want. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're trying to figure it out. We're trying new shocks and  
springs, and we're working on it very hard.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Having probably fewer problems now than any driver in the series  
is rookie Tony Stewart. He got his first career victory two weeks 
ago at Richmond, Va., and hung on for second with an ailing engine 
in New Hampshire. 
</P>
<P>
	But that's history to Stewart, who starts third Sunday.  
</P>
<P>
	``I don't think about the last time we were here, like how well  
we ran,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Although Stewart qualified third and has been as fast as anybody  
the past month, he won't try to show off his speed. 
</P>
<P>
	``If somebody's good at the beginning of the race and takes off,  
we've got to let him go,'' he said. ``We can't use up our equipment 
trying to run him down.'' 
</P>
<P>
	It's called sticking to a game plan, and now that the problems  
almost inherent to an all-rookie team have eased up as the season 
has progressed, Stewart is filled with confidence. 
</P>
<P>
	Regardless of all the positive media attention he's had this  
year, the former Indy Racing League champion thinks success is a 
merger of efforts. In that endeavor, he feels like the junior 
partner. 
</P>
<P>
	``I feel it's 99 percent the team and one percent the driver,  
but that's not important.'' he said. ``The goal is always the same. 
</P>
<P>
	``Every time you leave the race track, the next time you come  
back you want to be better. Now, we only have a couple of rough 
spots to get over to make it better.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But not many. No one has scored more points since the halfway  
mark of the season. 
</P>
<P>
	Between Wallace and Stewart on the starting grid had been Jerry  
Nadeau, finishing out the season for the retired Ernie Irvan before 
moving next year to Hendrick Motorsports. 
</P>
<P>
	Although the second position on the grid matched his career  
best, Nadeau will have to drop to the rear of the field on the pace 
lap because he went to a backup after totaling his primary car in 
the final practice session. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think the car's very capable of maintaining itself Sunday,''  
he said earlier. ``The car ran great since it rolled off the truck. 
</P>
<P>
	``We'll be good tomorrow.''

<HEADLINE> Food Costs To Rise Just 2 Percent </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Tough times for livestock producers mean good  
news for consumers. 
</P>
<P>
	Food costs will rise just 2 percent this year, the smallest  
increase in seven years, and by about the same amount in 2000 
because of abundant meat supplies and relatively stable costs for 
processors and supermarkets, the government says. 
</P>
<P>
	The estimates include both the cost of eating out and the prices  
shoppers pay at the grocery store. 
</P>
<P>
	Supermarket prices will rise an estimated 1.7 percent this year,  
while restaurant prices are expected to go up 2.6 percent, 
according to a new report by the Agriculture Department. 
</P>
<P>
	Heavy production of beef, poultry and pork has reduced the  
income of many farmers and ranchers in recent years; pork producers 
are expected to see their income fall nearly 20 percent in 1999. 
</P>
<P>
	Although cattle producers are cutting back on their herds, it is  
unlikely beef prices will rise significantly until supplies of pork 
and poultry tighten, said Annette Clauson, a department economist. 
</P>
<P>
	Consumers often switch from one meat to another, depending on  
the price. ``If there are small supplies of one but not the other, 
that holds down price increases,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	Pork prices dropped nearly 5 percent last year and more than 2  
percent this year. They would have fallen even more except that 
consumer demand is so strong supermarkets have not had to offer big 
discounts, according to the report. 
</P>
<P>
	Commercial pork production is up 1 percent this year and  
consumption is expected to reach a record 53.5 pounds per person 
</P>
<P>
	``There's a good healthy demand. Our message that pork is ... a  
lot healthier and lower in fat cholesterol, is reaching people. 
People are becoming aware of the qualities of modern pork,'' said 
Steve Cohen, a spokesman for the National Pork Producers 
Federation. 
</P>
<P>
	Hurricane Floyd, which may have destroyed as many as 3 million  
chickens and more than 100,000 hogs in North Carolina, is unlikely 
to have any impact on prices. That is only a fraction of the 
poultry and pork production nationwide; about 150 million chickens 
are slaughtered very week, Clauson said. 
</P>
<P>
	Egg prices also will be down this year, more than 3 percent,  
while the cost of most other foods are up: 2.5 percent for cereal 
and bakery products, about 2 percent for both fresh and processed 
fruits and vegetables, and nearly 5 percent for milk and other 
dairy products. 
</P>
<P>
	Coffee drinkers also are getting good news. The cost of  
nonalcoholic beverages is rising just 1.1 percent this year largely 
because of a near-record coffee crop in Brazil, the largest 
producer of Arabica beans. The trees finally have recovered from 
the effects of a freeze in 1994 and weather was excellent this 
year, USDA said. 
</P>
<P>
	The overall increase in food costs will be the lowest since  
prices rose just 1.2 percent in 1992 during a recession. 
</P>
<P>
	Depressed prices for wheat and other grains has had little  
effect on what consumers are paying because the cost of those raw 
commodities account for a small fraction of the price of processed 
foods. 
</P>
<P>
	``Your highly processed foods, your cereals, your breads ...  
those items are very highly driven by the overall inflation rate,'' 
Clauson said. 
</P>
<P>
	Farmers get 21 cents of each dollar Americans spend on food, and  
that share has fallen steadily. A decade ago, the farmers' share 
was 32 cents on the dollar.

<HEADLINE> Ryder Cup Notebook  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BROOKLINE, Mass. (AP) -- How's the view, Jean Van de Velde?  
Enjoying the rest, Jarmo Sandelin? Don't wear yourself out, Andrew 
Coltart. 
</P>
<P>
	Those three members of the European Ryder Cup team share the  
dubious distinction of not having played in any of the team matches 
on Friday and Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
	Only two other players sat out all the team matches in the  
previous 10 Ryder Cups since the present format was changed from a 
United States-Britain competition to a United States-Europe 
competition in 1979. 
</P>
<P>
	Each player could compete in a maximum of four team matches.  
Fortunately for Van de Velde, Sandelin and Coltart, all 12 members 
of each team play in head-to-head competition Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	Despite the inactivity, ``I think they'll be ready,'' European  
captain Mark James said. ``It's been difficult for them to get 
in.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The other nine team members played so well as Europe went out to  
an 8-4 lead after Saturday morning's alternate-shot matches that 
``to leave them out would have been very dangerous,'' James said. 
</P>
<P>
	Van de Velde, the first Frenchman to play in the Ryder Cup,  
understood. 
</P>
<P>
	``You have to remember, it's a team effort. It's not an  
individual effort,'' he said. ``I'll be a little tense (Sunday). 
That's for sure. But I'll be fresh.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Van de Velde's triple bogey on the 18th hole of the fourth round  
of the British Open put him into a playoff that he lost to Paul 
Lawrie, a Ryder Cup teammate, who was paired with Colin Montgomerie 
in all four team matches. 
</P>
<P>
	Sandelin has won this year's Spanish Open and German Open.  
Coltart was one of two captain's choices. 
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	 *RELATIVE-LY SPEAKING:* The great niece of seed merchant Samuel  
Ryder, who founded the event that bears his name, was amazed with 
the way the event has grown. 
</P>
<P>
	``If my great uncle was alive today, I'm sure he would be  
equally amazed,'' said Gweneth Ryder McKenzie, 71, who attended 
Friday's matches with her sister, Alice Ryder Andrews. They had 
attended two previous Ryder Cups in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
	``My first Ryder Cup was in 1981 at Walton Heath (in England).  
The crowds were large then, but nothing compared to this,'' 
McKenzie said. 
</P>
<P>
	She also felt Ryder would have liked the change made in 1979 to  
having the Americans face a team from Europe rather than one from 
Britain. 
</P>
<P>
	``My great uncle would have agreed to do all that is possible to  
keep the matches alive and in good shape,'' McKenzie said. ``When 
we attended the matches in 1979 and saw Europe win on American 
soil, we knew that the matches would endure.'' 
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	 *THE SHIRT ON HIS BACK:* U.S. captain Ben Crenshaw is a partner  
in a clothing company that outfitted his team's members, according 
to a published report. 
</P>
<P>
	``Ben is not about to make a fortune out of this,'' Preston  
Piermattei, vice president of Jeff Rose and Co., was quoted as 
saying by the Daily Telegraph, a London newspaper. 
</P>
<P>
	Crenshaw had been upset when some of his team members wanted a  
say in how proceeds from the Ryder Cup would be distributed. 
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	 *THE NUMBERS GAME:* The 33rd Ryder Cup is the biggest event held  
at The Country Club since it was the site of the 1988 U.S. Open. 
There have been plenty of changes in those 11 years. 
</P>
<P>
	At the Open, there were about 400 media members, 33 corporate  
customers and six multiunit deluxe restrooms. At the Ryder Cup, 
there are about 1,300 media members with thousands more turned 
away, more than 250 corporate customers and 31 deluxe restrooms. 
</P>

<HEADLINE> House Wants Notice for Monuments </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Over White House objections, the House voted  
overwhelmingly Friday for a measure encouraging presidents to 
consult with local officials before creating new national 
monuments. 
</P>
<P>
	The bill, sponsored by Rep. Jim Hansen, R-Utah, is the latest  
congressional fallout from President Clinton's 1996 creation of the 
1.7 million-acre Grand Staircase-Escalante National Monument in 
southern Utah. Hansen and other Utah officials were angered that 
Clinton did not consult them beforehand. 
</P>
<P>
	The House voted 408-2 for the bill, which says the president  
should consult with local residents and notify the state's governor 
and congressional delegation 60 days before declaring a new 
national monument -- a designation that puts restrictions on an area 
akin to those in a national park. That notice and consultation 
could be bypassed, however, if it was not ``consistent with the 
protection'' of the proposed monument. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's the best we could get,'' said Rep. Greg Walden, R-Ore.,  
who opposes a proposal to create a national monument in 
southeastern Oregon and is a co-sponsor of the bill. 
</P>
<P>
	Many Western Republicans say they are nervous about proposals  
for several possible national monuments, saying they could hamper 
mining, grazing and logging and bring more tourists to remote 
areas. Interior Secretary Bruce Babbitt has said he has a ``no 
surprises'' policy about new national monuments, but also said he 
would recommend that Clinton create a monument if an area needed 
protection and Congress refused to act. 
</P>
<P>
	A 1906 law allows a president to create a national monument to  
protect an area of historic, archaeological or geologic 
significance. President Theodore Roosevelt used it to protect the 
Grand Canyon before it became a national park; other national 
monuments include the Statue of Liberty and part of what is now 
Grand Teton National Park in Wyoming. 
</P>
<P>
	Hansen said that despite the law's loophole, it should ensure  
that local officials know about future national monument plans. 
</P>
<P>
	``The president may not skip the public participation phase  
simply because it may take time,'' Hansen said. 
</P>
<P>
	Critics say the measure is useless.  
</P>
<P>
	``The bill doesn't really do anything,'' said Brett Heimov,  
spokesman for New York Rep. Jerrold Nadler, one of two Democrats 
who voted against the bill. Nadler ``said, 'Why should I vote for a 
bill that's just going to embarrass the White House?''' 
</P>
<P>
	The White House's Office of Management and Budget sent a Memo to  
the House this week opposing the bill, saying that if it passed, 
Clinton's senior advisors would recommend a veto. The memo said the 
measure ``would undermine the president's authority to move 
decisively to protect and preserve the nation's treasures for 
future generations.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``I think it is outrageous that they oppose this legislation at  
a time they are supposedly advocating for public participation in 
these processes,'' Walden said.

<HEADLINE> Cards' Holdouts Practice With Team </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TEMPE, Ariz. (AP) -- Mark Smith and L.J. Shelton, the business  
end of football finally out of the way, turned their attention 
Saturday to trying to help the Arizona Cardinals return to the 
playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
	Both have a long way to go.  
</P>
<P>
	Smith, a defensive tackle who led Cardinals' linemen in sacks  
last season, may play Monday night against San Francisco, but 
Shelton, projected to start at left tackle when he was drafted No. 
21 overall last April, will sit, coach Vince Tobin said. 
</P>
<P>
	``The main thing we're concerned with is the mental part of  
it,'' Tobin said. ``He (Smith) acts like he wants to play, but how 
good of condition he's in, how many plays he'd be able to play, I 
have no way of knowing. 
</P>
<P>
	``Lonnie's got what we call a commissioner's exemption, so he  
wouldn't even be an inactive guy.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Both players practiced after ending their their holdouts Friday  
-- Smith by accepting the Cardinals' minimum offer, and Shelton by 
agreeing to a five-year contract that averages $1 million a season. 
</P>
<P>
	Minus a $40,625 deduction for missing two games, Smith will make  
$284,375 this year. 
</P>
<P>
	The seventh-round draft pick said he came to terms with the  
team's refusal to recognize his value after two years of 
overachievement, but remained defiant about general manager Bob 
Ferguson's suggestion in June that he would be flipping hamburgers 
if not for the NFL. 
</P>
<P>
	Ferguson later sent Smith a written apology, and he offered  
Friday to apologize in person. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't intend to speak to him,'' Smith said. ``I don't  
usually speak to the people in the front office anyway, and I don't 
see any reason to start now.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Smith said he would still reject the team's $500,000 offer --  
half of what he demanded before training camp -- if he had to do it 
over again. He will be a restricted free agent next year. 
</P>
<P>
	``They can trade me or do whatever they need to do, but when  
it's time for me to go back to the table again, I'm going to plan 
well and ask for what I'm worth,'' Smith said. 
</P>
<P>
	Shelton also was in a bitter contract battle, because he wanted  
a four-year contract. Agent Mark Smith accused the Cardinals of 
unfair bargaining, but the grievance was dismissed last week, and 
Shelton agreed to a deal with no voidable year or incentives. 
</P>
<P>
	The son of former NBA player Lonnie Shelton declined to comment  
on his signing bonus, reportedly about $3 million, but said he was 
satisfied and anxious to contribute. 
</P>
<P>
	``Wherever they need me to line up and help out -- defense, the  
secondary, first team, second team -- it doesn't matter,'' Shelton 
said. ``(Offensive coordinator) Marc Trestman's system is 
definitely complicated, but the good thing is that I don't have to 
run routes.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The defense is still minus Eric Swann, who is recovering from  
offseason knee surgery after playing in seven games last season. 
Although Tobin listed Swann as doubtful for the 49ers game, Smith 
snorted at the suggestion that his fellow defensive tackle would 
play. 
</P>
<P>
	``Swann ain't going out there,'' he said. ``I don't know when  
Swann will be back.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Whenever that is, the Cardinals will have a complete roster.  
</P>
<P>
	``I think my situation was a little different, but it's always  
tough when you're away from the family, so to speak,'' said 
franchise player Rob Moore, who missed training camp, got an 
interim deal just before the opener, and signed a lucrative new 
contract last week. 
</P>
<P>
	``Any time you have a guy of Mark's caliber and character not  
being with us, his absence is definitely going to be felt,'' Moore 
said.

<HEADLINE> NASA Station May Go to Private Co. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- NASA efforts to encourage commercial space  
ventures may eventually include turning over operation of the new 
international space station to private enterprise. 
</P>
<P>
	NASA Administrator Daniel Goldin told members of the Space  
Frontier Foundation on Friday the agency would consider private 
control of the space station after five or 10 years of steady 
operation. 
</P>
<P>
	In an age of shrinking budgets NASA can no longer afford to  
manage orbiting operations, such as the space station now under 
construction, and also reach out to explore the solar system, 
Goldin said. 
</P>
<P>
	``Our hope is to turn the keys of the station over to an  
entrepreneur, if the private sector sees opportunity,'' Goldin 
said. ``The government would become just one of many tenants and 
users of the station. The entrepreneurs could make money as we wave 
good-bye to low-earth orbit to explore the far frontier.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In an interview following his speech, Goldin said any private  
company that wants the job must demonstrate that it has the 
necessary expertise and financial clout necessary for such an 
undertaking. 
</P>
<P>
	``We've made the offer,'' he said.  
</P>
<P>
	Goldin spoke to about 400 engineers, scientists and aspiring  
space entrepreneurs attending the foundation's annual conference. 
The group is among several private organizations that has been 
lobbying the National Aeronautics and Space Administration and 
Congress for greater opportunity for private companies to pursue 
commercial ventures in space. 
</P>
<P>
	``Our NASA people want to design missions that open up the space  
frontier. They don't want to sit holding the hands of customers, 
watching dials and turning knobs,'' Goldin said. 
</P>
<P>
	For years, space exploration was considered the exclusive domain  
of NASA and a few big contractors such as Boeing Co. and Lockheed 
Martin Corp. that built spacecraft and provided services to the 
agency. 
</P>
<P>
	That practice has changed in recent years as the demand for  
commercial satellite launches have far exceeded NASA's launch 
capability. French, Russian and Chinese entities have become strong 
competitors in the launch market. U.S. aerospace companies are 
working to develop inexpensive launch vehicles. 
</P>
<P>
	Although the satellite market has softened in recent months, it  
is expected to remain a key aerospace market. 
</P>
<P>
	The prospect of turning the station entirely over to private  
management goes far beyond a plan NASA has adopted that would allow 
private companies to share the space station. Goldin said the 
existing plan would make 30 percent or more of the station 
available to companies while NASA retains control. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is a chance for the private sector to own a piece of the  
rock, make money from it and show there is life in the commercial 
sector, not just talk,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> 2 Die in Nashville Plane Crash </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NASHVILLE, Tenn. (AP) -- A vintage plane circled a downtown  
neighborhood Saturday and clipped trees before crashing between two 
houses and bursting into flames. Two men in the plane died. 
</P>
<P>
	Fire Chief Buck Dozier said it was miraculous that no one on the  
ground was killed. The plane lost a wing as it crashed and tumbled 
up against an unoccupied home a few blocks from a crowded farmers 
market. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is a heavily populated area and an historic area of  
Nashville. It came down between two houses and just burst into 
flames,'' Dozier said. 
</P>
<P>
	Killed were the pilot, 52-year-old Charles Richard Loudermilk,  
and Stephen Paul Canaday, 55. 
</P>
<P>
	``We got real, real lucky,'' said Sgt. Jack Klotzback of the  
Metro Nashville Police Department. ``Somehow, he set it down into a 
vacant lot.''

	YONKERS, N.Y. (AP) -- Magic Textile, which went off at 43-1, beat  
99-1 long shot Ribbon Man by three-quarters of a length to win the 
pace for 3-year-old colts and geldings at Yonkers Raceway on 
Saturday night, one of eight races in the $1.2 million New York 
Sires Stakes. 
</P>
<P>
	Walley Hennessy dominated the night, driving four winners.  
</P>
<P>
	Driven by Mike Sorrentino Jr., Magic Textile covered the mile in  
1:57 3-5 and ended the five-race winning streak of Teeth of the 
Dog, which finished a badly beaten sixth. 
</P>
<P>
	Driver-trainer John Stark guided Wallingford to victory in the  
race for 3-year-old colt and gelding trotters in 2:01. 
</P>
<P>
	Master Levac, with driver-trainer Dan Daley, covered the mile in  
2:01 1-5 to win the trot for 2-year-old colts and geldings, while 
Rae, driven by Jan Johnson, won the trot for 3-year-old fillies in 
2:01 4-5. 
</P>
<P>
	Hennessy's first winner was Dominatricks, which took the  
3-year-old filly pace in 1:58. He also won with Its Made to Order 
in the trot for 2-year-old fillies (2:02), unbeaten Gallo Blue Chip 
in pace for 2-year-old colts and geldings (1:56), and Hatsoff 
Hanover in the pace for 2-year-old fillies (1:58 3-5).

<HEADLINE> NYC Searches Abuser Medical Records </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- City officials plan to start searching welfare  
recipients' medical records for evidence of drug use in an effort 
to funnel abusers into treatment programs, The New York Times 
reported today. 
</P>
<P>
	For such abusers, the treatment program would be a mandatory  
condition for receiving public assistance. 
</P>
<P>
	Officials say checks are needed because the city's current drug  
screening system is finding unrealistically low substance abuse 
rates. 
</P>
<P>
	But Paul N. Samuels, director of the nonprofit advocacy group  
Legal Action Center, said the search would be an invasion of 
privacy, ``that will upset just about everybody.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Violating confidentiality is an ambush that will drive many  
people away from treatment,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Jason A. Turner, commissioner of the city's Human Resources  
Administration, said information would be collected from 
computerized Medicaid insurance bills submitted for applicants who 
have voluntarily sought substance abuse treatment. 
</P>
<P>
	``These are our own records,'' Turner said. ``We are not  
interfering with the doctor-patient relationship. We're helping 
poor people.'' 
</P>
<P>
	No date has been set to begin the review.  
</P>
<P>
	With few exceptions, a federal law passed in the 1970s bars the  
disclosure of information on patients in drug and alcohol treatment 
programs without the patient's narrowly defined written consent. 
That consent does not allow redisclosure for any other purpose. 
</P>
<P>
	Christopher H. Peacock, spokesman for the Federal Health Care  
Financing Administration, which oversees Medicaid records, said he 
had not received official notification of the plan. 
</P>
<P>
	``But there are confidentiality provisions in New York's  
Medicaid plan, and we expect them to be followed,'' he said.

<HEADLINE>  2002 Winter Olympic Mascots Named </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SALT LAKE CITY (AP) -- A rabbit named Powder, a coyote named  
Copper and a bear called Coal are the new mascots for the 2002 
Winter Olympics. 
</P>
<P>
	And Salt Lake organizers hope the furry critters, whose names  
were announced Saturday, bring the kind of money to the games that 
Utah's skiing, copper industry, coal mining have brought the state. 
</P>
<P>
	The names were revealed just a day after the Salt Lake  
Organizing Committee announced that toy maker Mattel Inc. would 
make stuffed versions of the mascots in a deal guaranteed to 
generate at least $1 million. The stuffed animals will go on sale 
as early as this holiday season in Utah for $10 to $40. 
</P>
<P>
	The snowshoe hare, coyote and bear, all characters in western  
Indian myth, first appeared in May. They were scheduled to debut in 
February, but the scandal of excessive wooing of International 
Olympic Committee members by Salt Lake bidders to win the games 
stalled the festivities. 
</P>
<P>
	After the unveiling, SLOC took suggestions for names from 42,000  
Utah schoolchildren, whittled the selections down, and opened them 
up to a nationwide vote. The other options were Sky, Cliff and 
Shadow or Arrow, Bolt and Rocky. 
</P>
<P>
	SLOC President Mitt Romney said the chosen names represent Utah,  
with ``Powder'' symbolizing the state's claim to ``the greatest 
snow on earth'' and ``Copper'' and ``Coal'' representing the land. 
</P>
<P>
	But the mascots are also meant to represent the Latin Olympic  
motto: ``Citius, Altius, Fortius,'' or ``Swifter, Higher, 
Stronger,'' with the rabbit moving swiftly, the coyote climbing 
high, and the bear representing strength. In addition, each mascot 
wears a charm around its neck modeled after the rock drawings of 
Utah's ancient tribes. 
</P>
<P>
	The mascots' names were announced during halftime at BYU's  
football game against Virginia in Provo.

<HEADLINE> Clintons Said To Abandon Loan Offer </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Clinton and Hillary Rodham Clinton  
have abandoned plans to accept a friend's loan guarantee and are 
seeking a conventional mortgage for the $1.7 million home they want 
to buy in suburban New York, a source said Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
	The Clintons hope to complete a new financing arrangement by  
Nov. 1, their original closing date, said the source, who is 
familiar with the Clinton's financial planning and who spoke on 
condition of anonymity. 
</P>
<P>
	They were reported to be considering options from several  
lending institutions to enable them to purchase the five-bedroom 
home in Chappaqua, N.Y., about an hour north of New York City. Mrs. 
Clinton is considering a Senate run from New York in 2000 and must 
establish residency before election day. 
</P>
<P>
	Under the original financing plan, the Clintons agreed to use  
their own money for the $350,000 down payment. Terry McAuliffe, a 
Clinton friend and one of his chief fund raisers, put up $1.35 
million as collateral to guarantee the money the Clintons are 
borrowing. 
</P>
<P>
	The Clintons and the White House said there was nothing illegal  
or unethical with the arrangement. 
</P>
<P>
	But public interest groups and some Republican said the  
arrangement was troubling and improper because of McAuliffe's 
political ties with the Democratic party. 
</P>
<P>
	A conservative group, in a complaint filed Sept. 10 with the  
Federal Election Commission, alleged that personal loans and 
guarantees for personal loans have always been treated the same as 
campaign contributions and are subject to the same $1,000 limit. 
</P>
<P>
	An FEC spokeswoman, while not commenting on the complaint  
itself, said generally the law mandates that loans and loan 
guarantees for candidates are subject to campaign limits if they 
are related to the campaign. 
</P>
<P>
	The Conservative Campaign Fund contends that because Mrs.  
Clinton must establish residency in the state to run for a Senate 
seat the home loan was campaign related. 
</P>
<P>
	McAuliffe was quoted in Saturday's editions of The Washington  
Post as saying, ``I'm there if the president and first lady need 
me. However, at the end of the day, if the guarantee is not needed, 
I'm sure there will be plenty of people to help me figure out how 
to spend my money -- including a few Democratic politicians.''

War, die in a firefight on American soil? Why did Melissa Morrison, 
a 6-year-old with a charming smile, perish 51 days later in an 
inferno? 
</P>
<P>
	What explanation is there for some 90 deaths on a 77-acre spread  
in central Texas? 
</P>
<P>
	And why, after 6 1/2 years, are we still asking these questions?  
</P>
<P>
	The facts seem simple. On Feb. 28, 1993, agents of the federal  
Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms tried to serve members of 
the Branch Davidians, an apocalyptic sect, with search and arrest 
warrants. A furious gunfight ensued; four agents and six Davidians 
died that day. 
</P>
<P>
	The standoff began. On one side, the Davidians and their leader,  
David Koresh. On the other, the FBI. 
</P>
<P>
	On April 19, an FBI tank rammed the Davidian headquarters,  
knocking down walls and breaking open holes and then pouring tear 
gas inside. At around noon, fires broke out -- ignited, the 
government says, by the Davidians -- and the compound burned to the 
ground. Koresh died, along with about 80 of his followers. 
Seventeen of them were children. 
</P>
<P>
	End of story.  
</P>
<P>
	But it wasn't.  
</P>
<P>
	Since the moment the ATF sent 76 agents to storm David Koresh's  
home, there have been those who have accused the government of 
abuse of power, lying and even murder in Waco. Some are extremists, 
like Timothy McVeigh, who is said to have timed the bombing of the 
Oklahoma federal building to coincide with the anniversary of the 
Waco fire. 
</P>
<P>
	But others are less easily dismissed, and they were buoyed by  
the FBI's admission this month that it had, in fact, fired two 
pyrotechnic tear gas grenades at the Davidian compound, despite 
previously denying it used anything that might have sparked a fire. 
</P>
<P>
	The FBI insisted the grenades were fired hours before the fire,  
and bounced harmlessly off a concrete bunker. And it turned out the 
Justice Department had revealed the information to Congress in 
1995, but it was buried in 100,000 documents, and even Attorney 
General Janet Reno appeared unaware of it. 
</P>
<P>
	Reno appointed former Missouri Sen. John Danforth to examine the  
FBI's conduct at Waco -- to answer, he said, ``the dark questions'' 
of Waco. 
</P>
<P>
	But where Waco is concerned, there are nothing but dark  
questions. 
</P>
<P>
	For one: Was the government justified in its campaign against  
David Koresh -- rock 'n' roller, polygamist and self-proclaimed 
Christ. 
</P>
<P>
	Born Vernon Wayne Howell, the illegitimate son of a 15-year-old  
girl, Koresh took full control of the Branch Davidians in 1988. The 
Davidians, an offshoot of the Seventh-Day Adventists, have 
repeatedly predicted the end of the world from Waco, where they 
have lived since 1935. 
</P>
<P>
	It is widely known that Koresh had wives as young as 14, and had  
sex with others even younger. He had appropriated the wives of all 
the Davidian men; his children, he claimed, would rule the world. 
</P>
<P>
	But the ATF said Koresh was depraved in other ways. It alleged  
that he was running a methamphetamine lab. None was ever found. 
</P>
<P>
	David B. Kopel and Paul H. Blackman, in their book ``No More  
Wacos,'' say the drug allegations were a ruse -- the only legal 
pretext whereby the ATF could seek the military's help. 
</P>
<P>
	The military helped train ATF agents for the first assault on  
Mount Carmel, as the Davidian compound was known; it was revealed 
this month that three Army special operations officers were there 
on April 19, though the Pentagon insisted they were merely passive 
observers. 
</P>
<P>
	The main charges against Koresh and his followers were that he  
was breaking firearms laws -- more specifically, converting guns 
into machine guns. The ATF said Koresh had spent $199,715 in the 
previous year to buy guns, gun parts and other components, enough 
to build a fearsome arsenal. 
</P>
<P>
	There were many guns at Mount Carmel, but Koresh's supporters  
and lawyers argue that most were made or bought for profit. 
</P>
<P>
	``All gun dealers stockpile weapons,'' Dick Reavis, author of  
``The Ashes of Waco: An Investigation,'' told a congressional 
hearing. 
</P>
<P>
	Warrants in hand, the ATF decided to arrest Koresh at Mount  
Carmel with a major flourish. The reason, agents said, was that he 
was a recluse, rarely seen outside of the compound. But local 
newspapers and others reported that he had been seen at an auto 
repair shop, at two local bars, at a junkyard and jogging down the 
road. 
</P>
<P>
	At 9:48 a.m. on Feb. 28, ATF agent Roland Ballesteros approached  
Mount Carmel's door and shouted ``Police! Lay down!'' 
</P>
<P>
	But the Davidians knew they were coming.  
</P>
<P>
	Earlier that day, a KWTX-TV cameraman James Peeler encountered a  
postman and asked for directions to the Branch Davidians' place. 
Reportedly, Peeler told the mailman he'd ``better get out of here 
because ... they're going to have a big shootout with the religious 
nuts.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Peeler did not know that he was speaking to a Branch Davidian --  
David Jones, Koresh's brother-in-law. 
</P>
<P>
	An ATF agent who had infiltrated the Davidians, realizing that  
the secret was out, excused himself and reported that the ATF had 
lost the element of surprise. 
</P>
<P>
	Nonetheless, field commander Charles Sarabyn pressed forward,  
and would insist later that he was not aware that the secret was 
blown. 
</P>
<P>
	``I do not know what went on in the man's mind when he made the  
decision'' that was ``in absolute violation of the instructions,'' 
Treasury Secretary Lloyd Bentsen later said, after his department, 
which runs ATF, issued its report on the raid. 
</P>
<P>
	Todd McKeehan and three other agents -- Conway LeBleu, Robert  
Williams and Steven Willis -- were killed in a 45-minute gun battle. 
Six Branch Davidians died. Twenty eight agents were injured, along 
with an unknown number of Davidians, including Koresh himself. 
</P>
<P>
	Who started the shooting?  
</P>
<P>
	The government has always insisted that the Davidians did.  
``They were throwing everything at us,'' ATF agent Jim Cavanaugh 
told Congress. ``Their guns sounded like cannons and our guns 
sounded like pop guns.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Koresh certainly was willing to tangle. ``I don't care who they  
are,'' he said in a taped conversation with a lawyer. ``Nobody is 
going to come into my home, with my babies around, shaking guns 
around, without a gun back in their face. That's just the American 
way.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But during the shootout, members of Koresh's group called 911.  
</P>
<P>
	``We ain't firing. That's not us. That's them,'' cried Steve  
Schneider, Koresh's top aide. Wayne Martin, another member, made 
the first call: ``Tell them there's women and children in here and 
to call it off.'' 
</P>
<P>
	(Nearly a year later, a jury would acquit 11 Branch Davidians of  
murder in the shootout, convicting five of voluntary manslaughter, 
instead. ``The federal government was absolutely out of control 
there,'' forewoman Sarah Bain said. ``We spoke in the jury room 
about the fact that the wrong people were on trial, that it should 
have been the ones who planned the raid and orchestrated it and 
insisted on carrying out the plan who should have been on trial.'') 
</P>
<P>
	After the shooting, the FBI took the lead role for the  
government. Actually, there were two FBI presences: the hostage 
negotiators, who tried to calm Koresh and make deals with him, and 
the elite Hostage Rescue Team, which was intent on ratcheting up 
the pressure. 
</P>
<P>
	Koresh frustrated the negotiators. He would bend their ears for  
hours with what they called his ``Bible babble.'' He promised an 
end to the siege, and then changed his mind -- or rather, he said 
God had changed his mind. 
</P>
<P>
	The rescue team, meanwhile, was hitting the compound with bright  
lights and noise: the squeal of rabbits being slaughtered, the 
high-pitched tone of a phone off the hook, dentist's drills, 
helicopters. They turned off the Davidians' electricity and refused 
to deliver milk for the children. 
</P>
<P>
	Some argue that these may not have been the best tactics to use  
against a group programmed to embrace the apocalypse. And the good 
cop-bad cop conflicts convinced the Davidians ``that the 
negotiators had no influence over the decision makers and that the 
FBI was not trustworthy,'' said Edward S.G. Dennis Jr., who led a 
government investigation into the FBI's actions. 
</P>
<P>
	Twenty-three Davidians left the compound in the first week. More  
might have left, but the government rejected Koresh's conditions. 
</P>
<P>
	He offered to send out 6-year-old Melissa Morrison, if he could  
talk to Robert Rodriguez, the undercover agent who had warned the 
ATF of the lost element of surprise; the FBI refused, and Melissa 
died with her mother, Rosemary, on April 19. 
</P>
<P>
	April 19 gives rise to the darkest questions of all.  
</P>
<P>
	Koresh's attorneys are convinced that they had a deal; Koresh  
would finish his magnum opus -- an explanation of the Book of 
Revelations' Seven Seals -- and then surrender. 
</P>
<P>
	But the FBI believed Koresh was stalling, and would backpedal  
once more. The bureau convinced Janet Reno that more must be done. 
</P>
<P>
	Her reasons: Koresh was becoming more erratic. There were  
reports that the children were being beaten (though these reports 
were never substantiated). There was concern that the FBI's hostage 
rescue team was getting fatigued. 
</P>
<P>
	Reno and the FBI insisted the plan was not to end the standoff  
then and there. The action was ``not an indication that our 
patience has run out,'' said bureau spokesman Bob Ricks. It was 
instead ``the next logical step in a series of actions to bring 
this episode to a conclusion.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Reno authorized the use of CS gas -- actually a fine powder that  
burns the eyes and skin. It was known that the Davidians did not 
have children's gas masks; it was hoped that the ``maternal 
instinct'' would lead mothers to bring their children out. 
</P>
<P>
	Reno says she was assured that CS was safe and not flammable.  
Critics argue that it is neither, that it could harm or even kill 
children in high concentrations, that it could feed a 
conflagration, and that when it burns, it gives off deadly cyanide. 
</P>
<P>
	``Obviously, if I had thought that the chances were great for  
mass suicide, I never would have approved the plan,'' Reno said. 
</P>
<P>
	The nine Davidians who escaped the fire denied any such suicide  
took place. They claimed the FBI's tank squashed containers of 
propane and other fuels. Perhaps, they say now, the pyrotechnic 
grenade or some other projectile set off the fire. 
</P>
<P>
	But that morning, FBI surveillance picked up troubling  
conversations at Mount Carmel: ``I already poured it. ... It's 
already poured.'' ``Don't pour it all out, we might need some 
later.'' ``So we only light 'em at first if they come in with that 
tank, right?'' 
</P>
<P>
	The FBI says its snipers saw a Davidian start a fire, and that  
an infrared camera in a plane overhead detected three fires 
beginning in three separate parts of the compound, almost 
simultaneously. 
</P>
<P>
	Not all of the Davidians burned to death, however. Twenty-three,  
including Koresh, died of gunshot wounds. Investigators said they 
killed themselves or each other or both. 
</P>
<P>
	``The FBI never fired one shot at the Davidians,'' said Dick  
Rogers, head of the hostage rescue team. 
</P>
<P>
	But Michael McNulty, maker of the Oscar-nominated documentary  
``Waco: Rules of Engagement,'' says the same overhead infrared 
footage that showed the fires igniting shows something else: 
automatic weapons fire into the compound, out of journalists' view. 
</P>
<P>
	And the Texas Rangers say 12 .308-caliber rifle shell casings  
and 24 .223 caliber casings were found in a house used by the 
Hostage Rescue Team. 
</P>
<P>
	The FBI says the shell casings could have come from ATF agents  
who used the house during the Feb. 28 shootout. It has been noted 
that the FBI agent in charge of the post was Lon Horiuchi, who 
killed the wife of white separatist Randy Weaver at a 1992 standoff 
in Ruby Ridge, Idaho. 
</P>
<P>
	Dr. Nizam Peerwani, the Tarrant County medical examiner, would  
like to revisit his autopsies of the Davidians. ``The focus at the 
time was not whether the FBI was doing the shooting.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The corpses themselves will be of little use. Weeks after they  
were autopsied, the morgue's refrigeration failed. The bodies 
liquefied. 
</P>
<P>
	There are other concerns about the investigation and the  
evidence. 
</P>
<P>
	There were no independent ballistics tests. The Texas Rangers  
complained that the FBI confiscated their photographs, and returned 
just a few. Spent illumination flares have turned up in the store 
of government evidence -- again, devices that could set off a fire, 
though the government says they were used long before, to 
illuminate the compound. 
</P>
<P>
	Mount Carmel's door, which the Davidians believe would prove the  
ATF was the aggressor, has vanished. Cars and tracks at the scene 
were destroyed by FBI armored vehicles. A cap worn by one of the 
Davidians who died that day disappeared and has only recently been 
found; it may show that he was executed, shot point blank, the 
Davidians say. 
</P>
<P>
	Nearly six in 10 Americans now say they believe the FBI lied  
about Waco, according to a ABC News poll -- an indication of the 
skepticism that Danforth will encounter as he tries to answer 
Waco's dark questions, 6 1/2 years after these sad events.

<HEADLINE> Rogers Has 'Modest' Home for Sale </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ATHENS, Ga. (AP) -- It's time for a change, so Kenny Rogers is  
putting his modest little home up for sale at auction. 
</P>
<P>
	Beaver Dam Farms, a 360-acre estate about 8 miles northeast of  
Athens, has a 32-room main house that Rogers designed and decorated 
himself, plus a guest house with two separate living quarters. 
</P>
<P>
	It also has its own 18-hole, par-72 golf course, two horse barns  
with a total of 56 stalls, its own lakefront beach and waterfall, 
and a lake house with floating deck. 
</P>
<P>
	Prospective bidders for the Nov. 4 auction will have to produce  
a $250,000 cashier's check to prove they're serious, but there is 
no minimum opening bid. 
</P>
<P>
	``Kenny never expressed any concern over the price,'' said  
William Bone, president of National Auction Group, the Alabama 
company handling the auction. 
</P>
<P>
	Rogers has said he's selling because he and his wife want to  
live closer to Atlanta. 
</P>
<P>
	``As much as I've enjoyed my years here, I've discovered that  
for me the thrill is in the creation,'' he said in a statement. 
``Now I'm anxious to move on and build something else.''

<HEADLINE> Woman Subpoenaed in Gingrich Case </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ATLANTA (AP) -- Divorce lawyers for Newt Gingrich's wife have  
subpoenaed cards, e-mail, phone records and other documents from a 
woman who has been romantically linked to the former House speaker. 
</P>
<P>
	Callista Bisek, a staff member of the House Agriculture  
Committee, is scheduled to give a videotaped deposition Wednesday 
in the Gingriches' divorce case. 
</P>
<P>
	Gingrich filed for divorce July 29 from Marianne Gingrich. The  
couple married 18 years ago. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Gingrich's lawyers are trying to establish whether Gingrich  
gave Ms. Bisek funds or spent the couple's money on her. Earlier 
this month, the Gingriches reached an agreement on how to 
temporarily split their assets until the divorce is final. 
</P>
<P>
	The subpoena requests documents and other items dating to  
January 1995, when Gingrich was installed as House Speaker. Those 
include: cards, letters, e-mail and other correspondence between 
Ms. Bisek and Gingrich; gifts; Ms. Bisek's home and cellular phone 
records; records of loans, payments or gifts from Gingrich; 
photographs showing the two together; and any audio or video 
recordings of the two. 
</P>
<P>
	The subpoena also requests any clothes or other personal items  
belonging to Gingrich that Ms. Bisek has in her possession. 
</P>
<P>
	Neither attorney in the case was available for comment Friday,  
The Atlanta Journal-Constitution reported in today's editions.

<HEADLINE> Clinton, GOP Spar Over Tax Bill </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- In the aftermath of President Clinton's veto  
of the GOP tax-cut package, the president and the House's top 
Republican found little common ground Saturday as they took the tax 
fight to the airwaves. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton wants negotiations on tax cuts less than the $792  
billion he vetoed Thursday and on money for debt reduction and 
programs the GOP wants eliminated. Speaker Dennis Hastert calls 
that ``a fool's choice'' that defies ``plain Midwestern common 
sense.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Common sense and the federal government are not often used in  
the same sentence, but we are working hard to bring some 
old-fashioned common sense to the way government works,'' Hastert, 
R-Ill., said in the GOP's weekly radio message. 
</P>
<P>
	He said the vetoed bill would have ``put fairness back in the  
tax code.'' It would have helped two-income married couples, people 
who have a death in the family or care for aging parents, and 
parents who want to save for their children's education. 
</P>
<P>
	``These are common-sense changes in a tax code that often defies  
common sense,'' Hastert said. ``Mr. President, I think you made a 
mistake by vetoing this tax fairness package.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In his radio address, Clinton said he rejected the tax plan  
because ``it was just too big, too bloated. It would place too big 
a burden on our economy and run the risk of higher interest rates 
and lower growth.'' 
</P>
<P>
	At the same time, he said, ``It would have created an untenable  
choice for the Congress: these irresponsible cuts on the one hand, 
or on the other diverting ever more funds from the Social Security 
surplus and from debt reduction.'' 
</P>
<P>
	New battle lines already are being drawn.  
</P>
<P>
	On Friday, the House Ways and Means Committee began moving a  
five-year, $23.3 billion bill to renew expiring tax credits and 
ensure that millions of middle-class taxpayers do not become liable 
for the alternative minimum tax. 
</P>
<P>
	The bill has enthusiastic backing from both parties' members.  
But Treasury Secretary Lawrence Summers privately told Democratic 
leaders he would urge the president to veto it in its current form 
because the tax breaks are not paid for. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton and Hastert each promoted his approach to saving Social  
Security, the financially endangered national retirement program 
facing the huge baby-boom generation's imminent retirement. 
</P>
<P>
	``It is plain common sense to put the trust back in the Social  
Security trust fund,'' Hastert said. ``Paying off your debts also 
makes sense to people in the heartland of America. We propose to 
pay down $2.2 trillion public debt accrued by the federal 
government ... We in the common-sense Congress have chosen this 
path, but we need the president's cooperation'' by accepting 
reduced government spending. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton said ``the congressional majority continues on a track  
that doesn't adequately fund America's real priorities, while 
already spending large amounts of the Social Security surplus.'' 
</P>
<P>
	While using ``budget gimmicks'' to spend Social Security money  
clandestinely, the president said, ``they're still not providing 
nearly enough for education and other vital priorities.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``The Republicans should work with us to create a budget that  
pays for itself with straightforward proposals,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Hastert countered: ``Some have said that we should negotiate  
with the president, that we should have a grand compromise where 
American families get minimal tax relief while the White House gets 
more Washington spending. That is a fool's choice,'' Hastert said.

<HEADLINE> Beggars Really Can't Be Choosy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Four prison inmates who claimed they earned  
money as beggars found out they can't be choosers -- at least when 
it comes to claiming federal tax credits. 
</P>
<P>
	The U.S. Tax Court ruled Friday that Miguel Bauta, Alfredo  
Dominguez, Floyd Daniel Jr. and John Walter Wolf could not claim 
earned income tax credits in 1996 and 1997 because they had no 
actual income. The earned income tax credit is available for 
low-income wage earners and is aimed at giving people incentives to 
keep working. 
</P>
<P>
	While in prison in Immokalee, Fla., the four filed income tax  
returns listing their occupations as ``beggar'' and claiming income 
of around $1,000 in each of those years. They also claimed earned 
income tax credits intended for the working poor of less than $100 
apiece in each year. 
</P>
<P>
	The Tax Court said the claimed ``begging'' money was actually  
gifts from family and friends and, as such, couldn't be counted as 
income. So the inmates had no right to claim the credits.

 *Bahamian officials searching for dozens of escaped Cuban illegal  
immigrants	
</P>
<P>
	NASSAU, Bahamas (AP) -- Bahamian authorities were searching on  
Saturday for dozens of illegal Cuban immigrants who broke out of a 
temporary detention area in a prison where they have been staying 
since Hurricane Floyd hit last week. 
</P>
<P>
	The 47 Cuban immigrants escaped by chipping away the bathroom  
bars in their Fox Hill Prison cells last week. Once outside, they 
scaled the barbed wire-lined fence, Acting Assistant Director of 
Immigration Samuel Moss said Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
	Authorities have recaptured 14 of them, but 27 were still on the  
run. 
</P>
<P>
	Authorities have beefed up security, particularly near the  
women's prison, where those who were recaptured have been housed, 
Moss said. The female prisoners were moved to another section of 
the prison to make room. 
</P>
<P>
	Nearly 400 detainees from different countries have been living  
in the island country's only prison since Hurricane Floyd rendered 
the Carmichael Road Detention Center ``uninhabitable,'' Moss said. 
</P>
<P>
	Floyd hit the Bahamas with 135-mph winds on Sept. 14.

<HEADLINE> Riots Break Out in Guadeloupe </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	POINTE-A-PITRE, Guadeloupe (AP) -- Police appeared to have  
restored peace in Guadeloupe's capital Saturday afternoon, ending 
nearly three days of looting and rioting over a labor leader's jail 
sentence. 
</P>
<P>
	Residents awoke Saturday to deserted streets littered with  
dozens of burned-out vehicles and other debris left over from the 
three days of riots, in which crowds set cars ablaze, pulled down 
traffic signs and broke into clothing shops. 
</P>
<P>
	Police fought them off with tear gas and batons. Some shops and  
schools on this French Caribbean island were closed to avoid the 
violence. 
</P>
<P>
	The crowds were angered that labor leader Armand Goto had been  
sentenced to four months in jail for allegedly beating up a police 
officer and threatening another. The incident allegedly occurred 
when Goto was negotiating on behalf of a union electrician, who had 
lost his job at a local auto dealership. 
</P>
<P>
	At least 27 people were arrested Friday night and early Saturday  
morning, police said. Earlier in the week, 15 people were arrested 
on charges ranging from firearm violations to theft. It was not 
clear how many have been released. 
</P>
<P>
	Six police officers were injured in the violence, which started  
Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	French officials said they would send 91 officers to assist in  
establishing and maintaining peace.

<HEADLINE> McCain Criticizes Bush On Buchanan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Republican presidential hopeful Sen. John  
McCain accused George W. Bush, the party's front-runner, of 
``sacrificing our principles'' by refusing to condemn Pat 
Buchanan's views on Adolf Hitler and Nazi Germany. 
</P>
<P>
	``Like Governor Bush, I want to see a united Republican Party,''  
McCain said in a statement Saturday. ``But no political campaign is 
worth sacrificing our principles.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In an interview Friday with The Associated Press, Bush said he  
does not want Buchanan to leave the Republican Party and seek the 
Reform Party nomination for president. 
</P>
<P>
	Bush did not join other Republican and conservative leaders who  
have attacked Buchanan over his campaign book, ``A Republic, Not an 
Empire.'' The book questions the timing of the United States' entry 
into World War II because, Buchanan said, Germany was no threat to 
the United States after 1940. 
</P>
<P>
	``America has always stood ready to fight tyranny and  
oppression. The Republican Party has always stood for freedom,'' 
said McCain, R-Ariz. 
</P>
<P>
	``I urge all of the Republican presidential candidates to let it  
be known that there is no place in our party for anyone who would 
reject these principles. Our party must take a strong and forceful 
stand against the kind of language that threatens our commitment to 
freedom and democracy for all.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Mindy Tucker, a Bush spokeswoman, denied that the Texas governor  
has coddled Buchanan. 
</P>
<P>
	``Governor Bush has made it clear that he strongly disagrees  
with Pat Buchanan on this issue,'' she said. ``He believes we were 
fighting on the side of freedom and justice, and Republican voters 
will have a chance to express their opinion in the primaries.'' 
</P>
<P>
	McCain said he was disappointed by the reaction of his fellow  
candidates. ``By continuing to appease Buchanan, several of our 
candidates appear to have put politics ahead of our party's 
principles.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Asked whether the statement was aimed primarily at Bush, McCain  
spokesman Dan Schnur said while the statement covered all the 
candidates, ``You'll note that in the third paragraph he mentioned 
Governor Bush by name.'' 
</P>

	ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) -- Hillary Rodham Clinton still is not an  
official U.S. Senate candidate, but she seemed Saturday to drop any 
pretense that she might not be in the race. 
</P>
<P>
	``I want you to know that if I was leaning any more toward it, I  
would fall over right in front of you,'' Mrs. Clinton told a crowd 
in Albany's Washington Park chanting, ``Run, Hillary, run.'' 
</P>
<P>
	This came hours after the first lady debuted that line and gave  
a campaign-style speech to the Schenectady County Democratic 
Committee, which in April became the first such organization to 
endorse her possible candidacy. 
</P>
<P>
	``The kind of candidate I would be, the kind of senator I would  
be, is one who would represent the entire state and everyone who 
lives here,'' she told cheering Democrats at the Schenectady 
Museum. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Clinton is looking at the Senate seat being vacated next  
year by Democrat Daniel Patrick Moynihan. On the Republican side, 
New York City Mayor Rudolph Giuliani is considering a run. 
</P>
<P>
	In New York City, about 100 Republicans held a ``Go Home  
Hillary'' rally Saturday on Fifth Avenue. 
</P>
<P>
	------	 
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Teamsters leader James P. Hoffa ruled himself  
out Saturday as a running mate for Pat Buchanan if the Reform Party 
should choose Buchanan as its presidential candidate. 
</P>
<P>
	Buchanan, a television commentator, is seeking the Republican  
nomination but is widely expected to quit the GOP and seek the 
Reform Party nod. 
</P>
<P>
	In a statement, Hoffa said he told Buchanan Saturday that ``I am  
not interested at this time in playing a role in presidential 
politics, except as an advocate for Teamster members.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Before the workers of America need a Teamster leader involved  
in presidential politics, they need a Teamsters union restored to 
its former strength,'' said Hoffa, the Teamsters president. 
</P>
<P>
	Hoffa's name came up a couple of weeks ago as Buchanan was  
reported considering possible running mates. Hoffa spokesman Chip 
Roth said no offer had been made at the time.

<HEADLINE> UN Tests Y2K Emergency Power Supply </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	GENEVA (AP) -- Anxious to avoid any disruption Jan. 1, the U.N.  
European headquarters tested its standby electricity supplies 
Saturday to check systems for the millennium bug. 
</P>
<P>
	A U.N. circular ordered all staff to switch off computers for  
the entire day to prevent damage from surges during the power 
checks. 
</P>
<P>
	``In the context of eventual disruptions due to a possible year  
2000 bug, one of the possible scenarios might be a general 
breakdown in electricity in Geneva while an important conference 
was in progress at the United Nations,'' said the circular. 
</P>
<P>
	There are no conferences currently scheduled for Jan. 1, but  
Geneva often hosts important diplomatic negotiations called at 
short notice. 
</P>
<P>
	Emergency generators were used to supply lighting and other  
services to key assembly rooms, but much of the sprawling U.N. 
complex was in darkness. Given the weekend, there were no 
conferences in progress.

<HEADLINE> Columbine Victim Is Homecoming King </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LITTLETON, Colo. (AP) -- The boy in the window during the  
Columbine High School massacre has become a king. 
</P>
<P>
	Pat Ireland, whose perilous escape from last spring's deadly  
attack was nationally televised, was elected the school's 1999 
homecoming king Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	Ireland, 18, was shot in the head and right foot during the  
attack in which 14 students and a teacher died, but managed to pull 
himself across the library floor and tumble out a second-story 
window to SWAT team members. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's a strong kid, an inspiration for all of us,'' said Mike  
Sheehan, Columbine's student body president and a finalist for 
homecoming king. 
</P>
<P>
	Ireland still has some paralysis on his right side. He takes  
three classes each morning and then undergoes three hours of 
therapy. 
</P>
<P>
	Another survivor, Richard Castaldo, still uses a wheelchair but  
played drum with the Columbine band at halftime Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	Columbine won the homecoming game 31-3 over Eaglecrest.

<HEADLINE>  Russian Warplanes Pound Chechnya </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	GROZNY, Russia (AP) -- Russia's air force pumped up the pressure  
on breakaway Chechnya on Saturday, knocking local television and 
radio off the air and sending tens of thousands of civilians 
fleeing toward neighboring regions. 
</P>
<P>
	It was the third day of punishing airstrikes on the capital,  
Grozny. Russia's air campaign had been focused on bombing suspected 
rebel bases, but now it is targeting economic installations and 
civilian communications facilities as well. 
</P>
<P>
	Warplanes bombed the republic's television station in Grozny on  
Friday and early Saturday and damaged the equipment beyond repair, 
Russian media reported. Chechen officials said seven people were 
killed and 24 wounded in the overnight air raid on the television 
station, the Interfax news agency reported. 
</P>
<P>
	The Russian military says it is trying to prevent incursions of  
Islamic militants from Chechnya into neighboring Dagestan. 
</P>
<P>
	The militants, who want to establish an independent Islamic  
state in southern Russia, entered Dagestan and fought Russian 
forces in August and September. They have been linked to terrorist 
bombings that have killed 300 people in Moscow and other Russian 
cities this month. 
</P>
<P>
	Saturday's airstrikes also knocked out a radio tower in the  
village of Goyskoye, 12 miles southwest of Grozny, Chechen 
officials said. Interfax reported that Chechnya's cellular 
communications station was also destroyed, but that report was not 
officially confirmed. 
</P>
<P>
	The air raids took out Grozny's oil refinery on Friday, and  
energy officials told Interfax that all refinery operations had 
come to a standstill Saturday. The refinery was burning out of 
control, said Bekhan Islamov, head of the Grozny fire department, 
and a thick pall of smoke hung over the city. 
</P>
<P>
	``There are no means to stop the fire,'' Islamov said.  
</P>
<P>
	As Russia has shifted its air attacks from outlying villages to  
Grozny, tens of thousands of civilians have tried to leave the 
republic. 
</P>
<P>
	An estimated 100,000 Chechens crowded the border crossing  
between Chechnya and the neighboring Russian republic of Ingushetia 
on Saturday. The line of cars and trucks waiting at the border 
stretched for miles. Russian border guards only occasionally opened 
the crossing. 
</P>
<P>
	Ingush authorities said some 20,000 Chechens had sought refuge  
there by Saturday -- most of them arriving by foot, crossing the 
border away from official checkpoints -- and that Ingushetia could 
not cope with the huge number. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are on the verge of a humanitarian disaster,'' said Akhmed  
Malsagov, the acting head of the Ingush government. 
</P>
<P>
	Russia's Air Force commander, Col. Gen. Anatoly Kornukov, told  
reporters Saturday that Russian airstrikes beginning in early 
August had killed more than 2,000 militants and destroyed some 250 
rebel strongholds and training centers in Chechnya and Dagestan. 
</P>
<P>
	Russia has put an estimated 13,000 troops along the breakaway  
republic's border with Dagestan. The air raids and the 
concentration of Russian troops have fanned fears of a full-scale 
war in Chechnya. 
</P>
<P>
	Chechnya has run its own affairs since winning de facto  
independence in a war with Russia that ended in 1996. But Moscow 
still claims it is a part of Russia and has struggled to keep 
violence from spreading to the rest of the Caucasus region. 
</P>
<P>
	Russian police have tried to seal the borders of Chechnya. They  
detained two Russian converts to Islam who allegedly searched for 
sites for future terrorist bombings in Russia and were trying to 
re-enter Chechnya, Russian media reported Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
	The two admitted that they had been trained for sabotage at a  
camp run by Khattab, an Arab warlord based in Chechnya, the reports 
said. They did not say when the men were detained. 
</P>
<P>
	Elsewhere, Georgian authorities denied Russian accusations that  
Chechen and Dagestani militants had used Georgian territory to 
cross into Chechnya.

<HEADLINE>  E.Timor Refugees Holed Up in Convent </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DILI, East Timor (AP) -- The pro-Indonesian militiamen barged  
into the convent and lined up the children. ``Where are your 
fathers? Where are your brothers?'' they barked. 
</P>
<P>
	The terrified kids wept and glanced at the Salesian sisters  
standing nearby, begging silently for guidance on how to reply. In 
the end, they remained silent, and their frustrated interrogators 
drifted off in search of houses to loot and burn. 
</P>
<P>
	Most residents fled Dili, East Timor's capital, during the  
recent deadly backlash against an Aug. 30 overwhelming vote for 
independence from Indonesia. Among those who remained were more 
than 100 women and children who survived a two-week ordeal holed up 
in the Abalide Convent. 
</P>
<P>
	The besieged occupants slept in their clothes with their bags  
packed in case they were forced to flee, and recited prayers loudly 
in hopes of warding off militiamen. 
</P>
<P>
	By day, the women drew pictures with the children to lend them a  
sense of normalcy, despite the crackle of gunfire outside and the 
smoke wafting into their walled compound. 
</P>
<P>
	They finally emerged on Monday when the first contingents of an  
Australian-led peacekeeping force arrived to take over from the 
Indonesian military, which tolerated and even took part in the 
destruction of Dili and other towns. 
</P>
<P>
	Hundreds, perhaps thousands, of people were killed and hundreds  
of thousands fled their homes in the violence that savaged the 
mostly Roman Catholic former Portuguese colony, which was invaded 
by Indonesia in 1975. The Indonesian military is now withdrawing 
its troops. 
</P>
<P>
	Sister Marlene Bautista, a 38-year-old Philippines-born  
American, said Saturday the militiamen were punctual in their daily 
routine. The rampages usually began early afternoon and ebbed at 
about 3:30 a.m. 
</P>
<P>
	``I was still able to go out in the car in the morning,'' said  
Bautista, who has lived in East Timor for 11 years. ``I just made 
sure I was back by 12 because at 2 p.m. they started shooting.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The looting was hierarchical, she said. Soldiers burst into  
homes and had the pick of any electronic goods. Then the militia 
entered and salvaged valuables before burning the houses. 
</P>
<P>
	Some 400 people, including seven nuns, sought shelter in the  
convent when the militiamen launched their rampage Sept. 4. The 
violence began shortly after U.N. officials announced that the 
territory of 800,000 people voted overwhelmingly in favor of 
independence. 
</P>
<P>
	Militiamen stopped by several times to search in vain for men  
and boys whom they likely planned to abduct and possibly kill. But 
they were reluctant to assault the convent as long as women and 
children were inside. 
</P>
<P>
	``They would say, 'Why are you still here? You have to get out  
because we're going to burn the place down,''' Bautista said. 
</P>
<P>
	Yet the armed men of East Timorese origin never did, partly  
because Bautista and other nuns talked to them in the local 
dialect, Tetum, and persuaded them to move on. 
</P>
<P>
	``We really got good at ducking,'' said Bautista. One convent  
window was shattered by a bullet. 
</P>
<P>
	They survived on food stocks in the compound and rice delivered  
by the United Nations. 
</P>
<P>
	Now that U.N.-authorized peacekeepers have arrived, those  
sheltering at the convent roam freely and smiles abound. On Friday, 
peacekeepers arrested three unarmed militiamen who were asking for 
rice handouts outside the convent gate. 
</P>
<P>
	There was a small crisis Saturday: Sister Bautista had to rush  
to the hospital to care for a child who was bitten on the hand by a 
pig.

<HEADLINE> Floyd Forces Daily Flood Cleanup </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BOUND BROOK, N.J. (AP) -- For years, Stanley and Jenny Jeskie  
would rise each day at 6 a.m., dress and take a mile-long walk 
together, circling the heart of the town where they spent the last 
40-plus years. 
</P>
<P>
	After tea and toast at Leo's Luncheonette on Main Street, they'd  
head back to the century-old, brown-with-yellow-trim house where 
they raised six children 
</P>
<P>
	Their routine is horribly different since Tropical Storm Floyd  
brought a flood that filled their basement and rose 2 1/2 feet deep on 
the first floor. They lost furniture and appliances in the living 
room, kitchen and bedroom. Leo's Luncheonette is closed until 
further notice. 
</P>
<P>
	Now, Stanley, 72, and Jenny, 69, awaken each morning in their  
daughter's bed in Middlesex, about 4 miles away. The rest of each 
day they spend at home, scrubbing away layers of mud and coughing 
dust from the ruined plaster that has to be torn from their walls. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's like starting all over,'' Mrs. Jeskie said Thursday,  
looking around her empty first floor. 
</P>
<P>
	When Floyd struck earlier this month, the Jeskies were in  
Pennsylvania at a funeral. By the time they got back a couple of 
days later, their television was afloat and food was ruined. 
Presents they had just received for their 50th anniversary were 
covered with mud, although a vase of sunflowers from a celebration 
dinner remained untouched on the kitchen table. 
</P>
<P>
	``I couldn't even speak. I felt like crying,'' said Stanley  
Jeskie. 
</P>
<P>
	This past week, instead of following their old routine, the  
Jeskies have a new one: They wake up in Middlesex at the home of 
their oldest daughter, Rosanne, and her husband, Tim Stewart, and 
their two teen-age children. To make room for her parents, Rosanne 
sleeps in her daughter's room and Tim sleeps on a couch. 
</P>
<P>
	At about 7:30 a.m., the Jeskies drive to their home. Their son,  
Jimmy, is already there, hammering away at sodden plaster. Five of 
the couple's six children live within about an hour's drive. Many 
have been helping to cart out mud-covered furniture and rip out 
flood-ruined plaster and other parts that must be replaced. 
</P>
<P>
	``People say `oh, don't have big families,'' Mrs. Jeskie said.  
``Where would I be now if I only had one kid?'' 
</P>
<P>
	One recent morning, a Federal Emergency Management Agency  
inspector arrived to check the empty first floor, telling them of 
the forms necessary to apply for aid. They should receive a check 
within two weeks, enough to cover ``minimal repair.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A few hours later, the Red Cross arrived with bottled water and  
cleanup kits. 
</P>
<P>
	Then a niece of the woman next door showed up, saying ``I don't  
know what to do. I don't know who to call.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Jeskie gives her FEMA's number.  
</P>
<P>
	Jeskie, a retired roofer from Johnson Manville, used to love to  
work on his house. And he planted tomatoes and peppers in the back 
garden, where the vegetable plants now are all covered with brown 
water. 
</P>
<P>
	``I have to pull all of them out and tie them up and put them  
out for garbage,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	A bright orange sign on the Jeskies' front window says  
``HABITABLE,'' since the second floor is relatively undamaged 
although there are no appliances or electricity. Other homes in the 
neighborhood have signs reading ``SAFE,'' meaning they need repairs 
to be habitable, and some have been condemned. 
</P>
<P>
	The Jeskies collect about $2,000 a month in Social Security and  
pensions. They don't have flood insurance. They have some savings, 
``but nothing fabulous,'' Mrs. Jeskie said. 
</P>
<P>
	``I just hope I can have enough assistance to try to do the  
three rooms,'' Jeskie said. ``Enough just to get it livable. 
</P>
<P>
	``We just hope for the best.''

<HEADLINE> 14 Killed in S. Africa Bus Crash </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	KOKSTAD, South Africa (AP) -- A bus went off a highway in foggy  
weather and crashed into a tree, killing 14 people and injuring 
about 20, police said today. 
</P>
<P>
	The accident was the latest in a series of bus crashes that the  
government has vowed to halt. In a three-day period this week, 32 
people have been killed and more than 100 injured in three separate 
collisions involving buses. 
</P>
<P>
	Transportation Minister Dullah Omar plans to meet with bus  
company representatives and try to see how stop these accidents, 
his spokesman Mike Mabasa said today. 
</P>
<P>
	The latest crash happened late Friday on a highway near Kokstad,  
a town in KwaZulu-Natal province in eastern South Africa, police 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Earlier Friday, two buses, one carrying a school cross-country  
team, collided on a highway 155 miles south of Johannesburg, 
killing six people and injuring about 60. 
</P>
<P>
	On Wednesday, a bus and a truck crashed about 240 miles north of  
Cape Town, killing 12 people.

<HEADLINE> Mexico Doesn't Feel U.S. Prosperity </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CIUDAD JUAREZ, Mexico (AP) -- Signs of U.S. prosperity are  
everywhere in this sprawling border city: cast-off Buicks and Fords 
piled high in the shadow of brand-new shopping malls filled with 
American goods from Church's Fried Chicken to jeans by Guess?. 
</P>
<P>
	Packing crates from the fast-multiplying maquiladoras, assembly  
plants run largely by U.S. companies, form the walls of shacks, 
while housing developments for low-level managers bloom in the 
desert nearby. 
</P>
<P>
	Old U.S. school buses rented by the maquiladoras haul workers  
from shanty towns to the broad new boulevards laid out in front of 
landscaped factory complexes. The buses are a perk since employers 
acknowledge that wages are too low for workers to pay their own 
transport. Meanwhile, at the end of the day, American managers in 
the maquiladoras zip home to El Paso along cross-border commuter 
lanes. 
</P>
<P>
	It's hard to talk about good times on $35 a week, the average  
starting wage of most maquiladoras. But even if this doesn't match 
U.S. prosperity, there's no arguing that the U.S. economic boom is 
having its effect along the Mexican border. 
</P>
<P>
	Juarez is exploding, with newly built shopping malls and factory  
complexes; cavernous Tex-Mex dance halls (75-cent drinks, no 
cover), and with some 40,000 people streaming into the city of 1.3 
million each year. 
</P>
<P>
	Because of the U.S. economic boom, the number of maquiladora  
jobs in Mexico has more than doubled in the 1990s to 1.1 million, 
some 250,000 in Juarez alone. But the pay is subsistence, even by 
Mexican standards, and few workers benefit from their employers' 
profits. 
</P>
<P>
	Starting wages, $6 for a nine-hour day, haven't increased much  
in the 35 years since the first maquiladoras opened. In fact, they 
have declined in real terms from levels of 20 years ago. 
</P>
<P>
	The maquiladoras say comparing the success of American managers  
and the misery of Mexican workers is invalid. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is a different economy,'' says Michael Hissam, spokesman  
for Delphi Automotive Systems. Delphi is one of Mexico's largest 
private employers, with 70,000 workers at 53 plants, where, he 
says, ``we're competitive in terms of wages.'' 
</P>
<P>
	U.S. prosperity has fueled the hand-me-down economy along  
Mexico's border, worsening problems of crime in the process. It has 
also had the unexpected consequence of creating new tension between 
rich and poor, government and governed, those who leave and those 
who stay. 
</P>
<P>
	Of course, there are success stories among the workers. The  
maquiladoras were built in the 1970s with enough parking for 
managers only. Now they are creating parking lots for droves of 
Mexican supervisors who buy cars, usually second-hand from 
neighboring Texas. 
</P>
<P>
	Some lower management and skilled workers are also taking out  
loans on small houses. In an economy that has always had surplus 
labor, there is now a shortage of skilled workers. Welders, 
carpenters and electricians are in demand. 
</P>
<P>
	Paulo Moncado's bearded face lights up when he describes his  
move from a shantytown with no running water to a tidy 
400-square-foot, four-room house in a development sponsored by his 
company. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's such a big change,'' he says. ``We can have furniture  
now, and a tape recorder.'' And electricity. In the shantytown, 
illegal electrical hookups burned out appliances. 
</P>
<P>
	Moncado's house, just a block from General Motors Boulevard,  
came with the help of Delphi, his employer. Three years ago, Delphi 
started underwriting loans to reward low-level managers and loyal 
workers. After 10 years as a warehouse worker, Moncado now earns 
$11 a day. 
</P>
<P>
	For some, U.S. prosperity has literally rolled across the  
border. In addition to the junked cars that are scavenged for 
parts, the used car business is moving up. The newfound wealth of 
one dealer, Ricardo Camarona, is apparent from his gold medallion 
and finely tooled leather boots and belt. 
</P>
<P>
	American used cars have always drifted across the border, but in  
the last few years they've been newer and in better condition, 
Camarona says. He stands beside a line of shiny 1994 and 1995 Grand 
Marquis at a street-side lot, for sale at $3,000 to $5,000 apiece. 
</P>
<P>
	``When I started in this business 10 years ago, I only had cars  
that were 15, 20 years old,'' he says. ``I've definitely moved 
up.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The quality of other American hand-me-downs also has improved.  
Peruse the six square blocks of downtown Juarez where vendors sell 
cast-offs, from appliances to stuffed animals. 
</P>
<P>
	David Lozano sits on the sidewalk in front of a pile of used  
stereos. ``It's basically all considered garbage in the United 
States,'' he says. ``We fix it up and sell it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But many, perhaps most, are not faring better.  
</P>
<P>
	Through the border fence, 50,000 residents of Ciudad Juarez's  
Anapra shantytown can see new buildings of the University of Texas 
and $1 million homes in El Paso's Wildcat Hill. 
</P>
<P>
	Anapra has been spilling out from the city into the desert for  
25 years. Despite endless promises from politicians, little has 
changed. The neighborhood still doesn't have a paved road or a 
sewer line. 
</P>
<P>
	Yet residents don't place much of the blame on the maquiladoras  
where they work -- in part because nobody would listen: unions here 
are weak and employers wield the threat to pull up stakes and 
leave. 
</P>
<P>
	Besides, says Lourdes Cera, a former employee who has lived here  
for six years, ``The maquiladoras come here just like anybody else, 
to try and make a buck. It's our government that doesn't do 
anything.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Local officials complain that tax money from the border plants  
goes straight to the federal government, not local coffers, and 
that can trigger bureaucratic wars. 
</P>
<P>
	In September, the feds took the unusual step of fining Chihuahua  
state $95,000 for registering junk cars from the United States. In 
Tamaulipas state to the east, local officials have accused the feds 
of undercounting tourists who cross the border, reducing local 
revenue and trickle-down from U.S. prosperity. 
</P>
<P>
	Immigration increased dramatically this decade as labor  
shortages opened up new jobs in the United States, while at the 
same time beefed-up border patrols forced Mexicans to use every 
trick -- no matter how dangerous -- to cross. 
</P>
<P>
	About 40,000 workers stream into Ciudad Juarez every year from  
southern Mexico, lured by factory jobs and proof of steady 
employment required for U.S. tourist visas. 
</P>
<P>
	In Ciudad Juarez, the paperwork for a visa is a constant  
preoccupation and illicit industry. ``A guy offered me false 
papers, even a passport, for $500,'' says Alberto Benitez, a former 
maquiladora worker. ``But I'd rather do things legally.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Benitez may not get his visa soon. He doesn't have the required  
military service, though he hears he can get a letter excusing him 
because he's now 34. 
</P>
<P>
	Constant immigration, both legal and illegal, also strains  
Mexico's social fabric. 
</P>
<P>
	Claudia Rosario Cordero, who crosses the border to buy used  
refrigerators to resell here, hates the attitude of 
recently-immigrated Mexicans. ``The ones who treat us worst in the 
United States are the 'nopaleros.' They act like they've won the 
lottery.'' 
</P>
<P>
	It's not just Juarez. Every border city feels an impact from the  
United States and faces its own problems. 
</P>
<P>
	In the extreme west, in Mexicali, millions of U.S. tires  
discarded throughout this decade have created an enormous and 
dangerous mountain. 
</P>
<P>
	Farther east in Nogales and Agua Prieta, the twin city of  
Douglas, Ariz., so many thwarted border-crossers and deported 
immigrants have concentrated on the Mexican side that Arizona Gov. 
Jane Hull quotes a Mexican official as saying he feared riots 
there. 
</P>
<P>
	All along the border, smugglers move drugs to feed U.S. demand  
fueled in part by the heady economy. And cities like this become 
battlegrounds in the drug wars. 
</P>
<P>
	In the peak years of 1997 and early 1998, at least two dozen  
people died in killings tied to drugs in Ciudad Juarez alone. In 
one shooting, gunmen brandishing semiautomatic weapons in a 
restaurant mowed down six people. 
</P>
<P>
	In the mid-1990s, smugglers took in so much money from U.S.  
markets, and paid so many bribes in Mexico, that they didn't count 
the dollars, they weighed them. Approximately $1 million in $100 
bills equals a kilogram (2.2 pounds), one drug trafficker said. 
</P>
<P>
	``The more drugs that move across the border, the more stay  
behind here to increase the local consumption,'' says Javier De 
Anda, spokesman for the Ciudad Juarez government. 
</P>
<P>
	As U.S. fashion magazines fueled ``heroin chic'' in the 1990s,  
there have been more heroin seizures here; local police say a dose 
of the drug now cost $5 or $6 in Juarez. 
</P>
<P>
	Illegal immigration, drug smuggling and violence are  
inextricably interwoven. 
</P>
<P>
	The men who raped and murdered young women here in a six-year  
spree found the perfect place to drop 57 bodies -- along lonely 
desert trails laid out by smugglers of immigrants. 
</P>
<P>
	Many of those arrested admitted using cocaine, and police  
investigator Irma Rodriguez says using drugs made the murderers 
more brutal. 
</P>
<P>
	Esther Chavez, a women's rights advocate in Ciudad Juarez,  
suspects that the real culprits behind some of the rape-murders of 
the Juarensas -- often poor girls from southern Mexico who came to 
work at the maquiladoras -- are shielded by wealth or influence. 
</P>
<P>
	The question is not really how Mexicans in this border city are  
enjoying prosperity. Most of it remains out of their grasp. Rather 
it is this: What keeps this wide disparity of rich and poor from 
spinning into chaos? 
</P>
<P>
	Emigration or drug use serve as an escape valve for some, while  
others attempt to keep their lives intact by using systems of 
beliefs they brought with them from rural Mexico: family, hard 
work, self-reliance and religion. 
</P>
<P>
	The largely female workforce at the maquiladoras turns out at  
the dance halls, despite the crime and violence, as Chavez says, 
``to forget the mechanical, dehumanizing work they do.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The song played on a recent summer night -- Cindy Lauper's  
``Girls Just Want to Have Fun'' -- reflects the poignancy: the 
hopelessness and the hope.

<HEADLINE> No End Yet to Kaiser Labor Dispute </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SPOKANE, Wash. (AP) -- Stan White is spending more time  
housecleaning these days, and he's looking for work. His daughter 
had to transfer to a college closer to home to save money. 
</P>
<P>
	White is among nearly 3,000 United Steelworkers who have been  
off the job since Sept. 30, 1998 because of a labor dispute with 
Kaiser Aluminum &AMP; Chemical Corp. 
</P>
<P>
	``I was the prime breadwinner, now my wife is,'' said White, 58.  
``Our income was chopped down 60 percent.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Workers at five Kaiser aluminum plants around the country went  
on strike in a dispute over wages, benefits and job security. On 
Jan. 13, the workers offered to return to their jobs while 
negotiations continued, but the company refused and locked them 
out. 
</P>
<P>
	Since then, the plants have operated with managers and  
replacement workers. The latest round of talks broke up in 
mid-August and no new meetings are scheduled. 
</P>
<P>
	In the midst of the nation's economic boom, this labor dispute  
has drawn little attention. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's odd for me to read in newspapers about how the average  
wage in the nation is going up and employers are more desperate for 
skilled employees,'' said Larry Strom, a 19-year employee and union 
leader. 
</P>
<P>
	More than 2,000 of the striking employees work at two plants in  
the Spokane area. Much smaller plants are in Tacoma, Wash.; 
Gramercy, La.; and Newark, Ohio. 
</P>
<P>
	Kaiser has lost millions of dollars since the strike began.  
Numerous replacement workers have been injured and the Gramercy 
plant was heavily damaged by an accidental explosion in July. But 
it isn't planning to capitulate. 
</P>
<P>
	``We can run indefinitely in the way we are running today,''  
Kaiser President Ray Milchovich said. ``A number of these 
operations, especially in Spokane, are at all-time record 
performance levels.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In its latest offer, Kaiser proposed pay increases of $3.13 per  
hour over a 5-year contract, plus some benefits improvements. 
</P>
<P>
	Kaiser says pay and benefits for most workers cost the company  
about $62,000 per year. Union officials said that translates to 
take-home pay of about $15 an hour. 
</P>
<P>
	But Kaiser also is demanding that 700 workers be laid off. And  
it wants 239 jobs covered by the old contract -- including janitors 
and groundskeepers -- to be ``outsourced'' to nonunion workers. 
</P>
<P>
	``That's union-busting,'' said Jon Youngdahl, a steelworkers  
official in Auburn. 
</P>
<P>
	The dispute contrasts with generally good management-labor  
relations in the aluminum industry, said David Foster, the union's 
chief negotiator. 
</P>
<P>
	``Kaiser is fighting over tenths-of-a-penny per pound in labor  
cost savings,'' Foster said. 
</P>
<P>
	But company negotiator Jeremy Sherman said the issues total  
millions of dollars per year and jeopardize the company's survival. 
</P>
<P>
	``The Steelworkers would like to create the myth that it would  
have been more favorable to accept a Steelworker contract. That is 
untrue,'' Sherman said. ``It's analogous to a shakedown artist who 
says `pay me this money, because if you don't I'll burn down your 
store.''' 
</P>
<P>
	Foster said the dispute is preventing Kaiser, the nation's fifth  
largest aluminum producer, from merging with some of the other 
major players in the industry. In August, Alcoa Inc. struck a deal 
to buy Reynolds Metals Inc. in a $4 billion-plus agreement that 
would join the world's No. 1 and No. 3 aluminum companies. 
</P>
<P>
	Many workers were prepared for a lengthy walkout, and a union  
strike fund has paid them $90 to $125 a week depending on need. 
</P>
<P>
	But unemployment benefits ran out in mid-August, noted Strom,  
vice president of Steelworkers Local 329. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'd like people to understand things are getting more tense as  
folks run out of unemployment,'' Strom said.

<HEADLINE> Whales May Create Chaos at Olympics </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SYDNEY, Australia (AP) -- Migrating whales could create chaos for  
Olympic sailing events in Sydney Harbour, a National Parks and 
Wildlife Service official said Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	NPWS Olympic operations coordinator Robert Bird said up to 3,000  
whales could migrate through the harbor during September as they 
return to Antarctica from their warmer breeding grounds off 
Queensland state. 
</P>
<P>
	Bird said while most whales pass through relatively unnoticed,  
some, like the southern-right whale nicknamed Alex who recently 
spent several weeks frolicking in the harbor, could cause problems 
for Olympic sailing events. 
</P>
<P>
	``The NPWS has spent the past 12 months developing contingency  
plans with the Waterways Authority and SOCOG (the Sydney Organizing 
Committee for the Olympic Games) to ensure there is minimal 
disruption to Olympic sailing events,'' Bird said. 
</P>
<P>
	He said whales had the right of way in the water and were  
protected, but their presence in the harbor could mean some Olympic 
sailing events are delayed or even canceled. 
</P>
<P>
	Bird said the NPWS used the Sydney Harbour Regatta, which ended  
Sunday, to fine tune its plans for the 2000 Olympics. 
</P>
<P>
	The wildlife service conducted an air, land and sea  
reconnaissance over the harbor, reporting marine mammal activity 
that may affect sailing events, particularly on offshore courses. 
</P>
<P>
	He said the visit by Alex last month and the presence of a  
humpback whale offshore last weekend during racing showed how 
easily an animal could enter an area of competition. 
</P>
<P>
	Bird said authorities were preparing as best they could for any  
such interruptions, but it could not be guaranteed that sailing 
events would run smoothly. 
</P>
<P>
	``In the instance of the humpback a race was delayed and the  
start shifted because of the presence of the whale,'' Bird said. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a natural process and we'll have to deal with each  
arrival as it comes. But essentially we will be making sure that 
the sailing events don't have any adverse impact on marine 
animals.''

<HEADLINE> Golden Gate Ad Bid Stirs Debate </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SAN FRANCISCO (AP) -- An Internet company has stirred debate by  
proposing to pay all tolls on the Golden Gate Bridge for one day a 
month in exchange for a large advertising banner strung across the 
span's toll plaza. 
</P>
<P>
	Supporters suggest the plan by carOrder.com would be a boon for  
commuters who fork out the $3 toll. Critics say it would desecrate 
an icon.

price now? And what's next? Half Dome?'' asked San Francisco 
Supervisor Michael Yaki, referring to the Yosemite National Park

staff members to study the plan and come up with possible 
guidelines by next month.

<HEADLINE> No. 1 Fla. St. 42, N. Carolina 10 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHAPEL HILL, N.C. (AP) -- The main problem for No. 1 Florida  
State on Saturday was staying interested for four quarters after 
its lightning-quick start. 
</P>
<P>
	The Seminoles (4-0, 3-0 Atlantic Coast Conference) put this one  
away early, scoring four touchdowns before the first quarter was 
half over en route to a 42-10 victory over North Carolina. 
</P>
<P>
	It was Florida State's fastest start in its seven-plus seasons  
in the ACC. 
</P>
<P>
	``It looked like in the first quarter they simply were not going  
to be able to stop us,'' Seminoles coach Bobby Bowden said. ``Then 
we substituted a lot of people and we lost continuity.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Bowden played a whopping 52 players in the first quarter and 70  
in the game. 
</P>
<P>
	``As soon as we started substituting the engine cut off,''  
Bowden said of his offense. ``We just shut down and never could get 
the thing cranking again.'' 
</P>
<P>
	It's a good thing for the Tar Heels (1-2), who are off to their  
first 0-2 ACC start in a decade with games at Clemson and No. 10 
Georgia Tech next on the schedule. 
</P>
<P>
	Sophomore quarterback Ronald Curry had three passes intercepted,  
fumbled once and was sacked five times. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was like a nightmare we couldn't wake up from,'' North  
Carolina coach Carl Torbush said. ``By the time we got out of it we 
were down 28-0. It was just boom, boom, boom, boom.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Seminoles ran their record to 32-4 as the nation's  
top-ranked team and Bowden moved within four victories of 300. 
</P>
<P>
	Many of the Florida State players said they wanted to prove a  
point with a quick start. 
</P>
<P>
	``Nobody (in the country) is really playing like they're No.  
1,'' said Florida State's star receiver Peter Warrick. ``So, we 
went out there with an attitude that we've going to play like No. 1 
today.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Tailback Travis Minor, who scored twice, agreed.  
</P>
<P>
	``We wanted to come out and set ourselves apart from everybody  
else,'' Minor said. ``You know how it is with people saying we have 
potential but we really haven't reached that potential.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Chris Weinke, who threw for 272 yards, marched the Seminoles 80  
yards on their opening drive, completing passes of 28, 20 and 19 
yards before Minor scored on a 14-yard run -- the first of his two 
first-quarter TDs. 
</P>
<P>
	Curry played giveaway on the next two possessions as the Tar  
Heels fell into a deep hole against one of the nation's better 
defenses. 
</P>
<P>
	Three plays after Minor's score, Curry was stripped of the ball  
by Jerry Johnson. David Warren recovered at the North Carolina 25 
and the Seminoles were in business again. Forty-five seconds later, 
Minor was in the end zone on a 5-yard TD run. 
</P>
<P>
	Curry's first pass on North Carolina's next series was returned  
25 yards for a score by Sean Key, who stepped in front of tight end 
Alge Crumpler and raced down the right sideline untouched for a 
21-0 lead less than five minutes into the game. 
</P>
<P>
	The Tar Heels received a mock cheer from their crowd when Curry  
finally completed a pass for a first down, but the drive stalled 
and more bad news was on the way. 
</P>
<P>
	Warrick, Florida State's flashy receiver and equally elusive  
return man, raced 75 yards with a punt return for a score, helping 
his cause in the Heisman Trophy race. 
</P>
<P>
	``You have to have 10 great guys blocking for you,'' Warrick  
said of his long return. ``Those 10 guys did the job and I thank 
them for it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	It was the first time a team had scored four TDs against the Tar  
Heels in a quarter since Florida in 1969. 
</P>
<P>
	``That would have been a good time for them to crumble but they  
kept fighting and matched us from then on,'' Bowden said of the Tar 
Heels. 
</P>
<P>
	North Carolina picked up the pace and closed to 28-3 on a  
36-yard field goal, but allowed the Seminoles to strike quickly 
again at the end of the half. 
</P>
<P>
	Weinke drove Florida State 92 yards in 90 seconds, capping the  
drive with a 25-yard pass to former walk-on and fourth-string 
receiver Atrews Bell. 
</P>
<P>
	Florida State intercepted a third pass off Curry on North  
Carolina's opening possession of the second half, and Warrick's 
spectacular 28-yard catch over a defender set up a 1-yard run by 
backup quarterback Marcus Outzen. 
</P>
<P>
	``You can't expect to spot the No. 1 team in the country 28  
points and then just come back on them,'' Curry said. ``Florida 
State did everything we expected and more.''

<HEADLINE> Kazak Parliament Rejects Budget </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ALMATY, Kazakstan (AP) -- The Kazak parliament on Saturday  
rejected the government's draft budget, prompting the prime 
minister to call for a vote of confidence in his administration 
just two weeks ahead of elections. 
</P>
<P>
	Members of the two houses of parliament accused the government  
of anti-social policies, and objected to the draft budget 
provisions to reduce pensions for invalids and to limit retirement 
pensions for civilians. 
</P>
<P>
	``We acted in the framework of the constitution when we rejected  
the draft budget, in which the government tried once again to cut 
spending on social needs,'' said Marat Ospanov, the speaker of the 
Central Asian nation's lower house of parliament. 
</P>
<P>
	Prime Minister Nurlan Balgimbayev told the legislators that his  
government should not bear the blame for austerity measures 
prescribed by the International Monetary Fund, and called for a 
vote of confidence. 
</P>
<P>
	Legislators could hold that vote no earlier than Monday, two  
days after the proposal was put forward. If two-thirds of 
parliament votes no-confidence, President Nursultan Nazarbayev must 
decide whether to dismiss the government or dissolve the 
parliament. 
</P>
<P>
	Sidakhmet Kuttykadam, the leader of the Prosperity opposition  
movement, said it was ``a political show when the issue of 
dissolving either the government or the parliament is raised five 
minutes before the elections.''

<HEADLINE> Deal Made in Drugged Teacher Case </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CINCINNATI (AP) -- An 18-year-old pupil who said he put a capsule  
of LSD in the soft drink of a favorite teacher as a joke has agreed 
to a deal that would put him in jail for a year. 
</P>
<P>
	Jarod Maier admitted in court on Friday that he spiked the drink  
before class began on May 3 at Colerain High School. Sentencing 
will be in November. 
</P>
<P>
	``I did not think that amount of LSD would have this much  
effect,'' he said in a statement to police. 
</P>
<P>
	``I would never do anything to hurt him,'' he told police. ``I  
screwed up and I'm sorry.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He pleaded guilty to one count of attempting to corrupt another  
with drugs. He could have received up to five years in prison. 
</P>
<P>
	Prosecutor Mike Allen said the original charge, corrupting  
another with drugs, could have carried a life sentence if the 
teacher had been seriously injured. 
</P>

	The teacher, Timothy Hicks, felt sick soon after drinking the  
soda but has not had lasting health problems.

<HEADLINE> GOP Planning Tax Breaks in HMO Bill </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- House Republican leaders are crafting a plan  
to add tax breaks for long-term care insurance and health insurance 
for the self-employed to legislation regulating managed care 
companies, according to congressional sources. 
</P>
<P>
	The move is part of a broader effort to leave a GOP stamp on  
legislation granting patients the right to sue their HMOs -- a bill 
the White House favors and appears headed for passage over the 
opposition of many Republicans. 
</P>
<P>
	These sources, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said the GOP  
leadership also is expected to try for approval of an amendment 
limiting damage awards in medical malpractice lawsuits. A bill that 
contains both the right to sue and limits on malpractice awards 
could confront Democrats with a difficult political choice as they 
decide how to vote on final approval. 
</P>
<P>
	House Speaker Dennis Hastert, R-Ill., has pledged the House will  
debate the HMO legislation the first week in October. 
</P>
<P>
	``This will allow members of the House to fairly express their  
views on the important subjects of patient protections and access 
to quality health care,'' he said in a recent statement. 
</P>
<P>
	The GOP leadership has been debating privately how to shape the  
outcome of the debate, and is expected to unveil its proposed tax 
add-ons on Tuesday. While final decisions have not been made, 
several officials said these proposals are under discussion and 
likely to be included: 
</P>
<P>
	--A new deduction to offset part of the cost of long-term care  
insurance. 
</P>
<P>
	--A new deduction for caretakers of elderly family members;  
</P>
<P>
	--An increased deduction to offset the cost of health insurance  
expenses for the self-employed, as well as for individuals who not 
offered insurance at their place of employment. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition, the leadership is expected to embrace expansion of  
an existing demonstration program for medical savings accounts, 
which are high deductible plans. Many Democrats oppose these 
accounts, saying they fear younger, healthier individuals will opt 
out of traditional policies, and drive up the cost of insuring the 
older, sicker population that is left. 
</P>
<P>
	Most of the tax proposals were included in a broader $792  
billion tax cut measure that President Clinton vetoed Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	It was unclear whether the GOP plan was to offer the tax  
provisions as amendments to the HMO measure, or bring them to the 
floor in a companion bill that would be debated simultaneously. 
</P>
<P>
	The decision to attempt to inject them onto the HMO debate  
follows a decision to try and attach several components of the 
vetoed tax bill onto a minimum wage measure expected on the House 
floor later this fall. 
</P>
<P>
	Both steps come as the leadership grapples this fall with a  
series of items on the Democratic legislation agenda. 
</P>
<P>
	The health care measure has bedeviled the GOP leadership for  
months. Dissident Republicans, led by Rep. Charles Norwood, R-Ga., 
joined forces with Democrats in August behind a measure containing 
the right to sue HMOs. The bill contains several other guarantees 
for patients and covers all 161 million Americans with health 
insurance; it drew the immediate opposition of the health insurance 
industry. 
</P>
<P>
	A second measure, containing a more limited right to sue, has  
circulated, as well. One of its sponsors, Rep. Tom Coburn, R-Okla., 
said on Friday he may withdraw it. 
</P>
<P>
	Rep. John Boehner, R-Ohio, chairman of a key subcommittee on the  
issue, introduced a third bill last week. It establishes a system 
for an independent review of coverage disputes, and prescribes 
penalties for HMOs defying the rulings of the independent arbiters. 
But patients would not be allowed to sue. 
</P>
<P>
	``Patients don't want lawsuits. They want a system that punishes  
HMOs severely if they refuse to provide the treatment physicians 
prescribe,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	But many leadership aides concede a majority of the House seems  
ready to vote for a right to sue. That means the White 
House-supported measure is likely to pass, leaving Hastert and 
other top Republicans in the position of attempting to reshape it 
through amendment. 
</P>
<P>
	The Senate approved legislation earlier this year that made  
changes in certain health plans, but drew a swift veto threat from 
the White House for failing to do enough.

<HEADLINE> Ex-State Senator From Md. Innocent </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ANNAPOLIS, Md. (AP) -- A former state senator was found innocent  
Friday of charges that he accepted bribes from the owner of a 
health care company who was seeking state approval to serve 
Medicaid patients. 
</P>
<P>
	The circuit court jury returned a verdict about 5 1/2 hours after a  
state prosecutor argued that former state Sen. Larry Young accepted 
cash bribes under the table and was a public official ``who did not 
serve you well.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The prosecution alleged that Young accepted about $72,000 in  
cash from Dr. Christian Chinwuba at a time when he was trying to 
get his struggling company certified to insure patients in the 
state Medicaid program. 
</P>
<P>
	Gregg Bernstein, Young's lawyer, argued that the state did not  
prove the two legal requirements for bribery -- that Young accepted 
money and that he accepted it with the intention that it would 
influence his performance as a senator. 
</P>
<P>
	Young was indicted on four counts of bribery, four of extortion  
and one of filing a false tax return. The judge threw out the 
extortion charges Thursday, ruling that there was not enough 
evidence to submit the question to the jury, and he was acquitted 
of the others.

<HEADLINE> Excerpt From Reagan Biography </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	Ronald Reagan's diary entry from July 18, 1985, when he lay in  
hospital recovering from colon cancer surgery and by some accounts 
authorized national security adviser Robert ``Bud'' McFarlane to 
make secret contact with Iranians in what later became known as the 
Iran-Contra affair. 
</P>
<P>
	The entry is in ``Dutch: A Memoir of Ronald Reagan,'' an  
authorized biography written by Edmund Morris and published by 
Random House. A copy of the book was obtained by The Associated 
Press. It is being released Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	``What a morning -- the Dr. took the metal clips out of my  
incision -- what an improvement that made ... he told me he'd take 
the feeding tubes out before lunch and he did. Such a feeling of 
freedom. ... 
</P>
<P>
	``Nancy and I had lunch, I find that I can only eat a few  
mouthfuls. A lot of cards and messages to look at. Then around 4:30

	``Gorbachev has passed the word he'd like to establish a private  
channel of communications. ... ``I watched a TV press round table

<HEADLINE> Man Sues for Drug Removal Surgery </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- A West African man in prison for drug smuggling  
is suing doctors who surgically removed heroin-filled balloons from 
his stomach and intestines. 
</P>
<P>
	William Meequaye Kanyi, 40, of Ghana, contends the surgery  
amounted to an illegal search and seizure. His federal lawsuit is 
seeking $5 million in damages. 
</P>
<P>
	Kanyi, serving time at a federal prison in Pennsylvania,  
contends U.S. Customs Service agents at Kennedy Airport and doctors 
at Mary Immaculate Hospital forced him to undergo unnecessary 
surgery, ignoring his pleas to let the balloons pass through his 
system. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's an excessive invasion of a person,'' Kanyi's lawyer,  
Velly Polycarpe, said Friday. ``You don't go inside someone and 
search their internal organs.'' 
</P>
<P>
	U.S. Customs and the hospital declined comment Friday.  
</P>
<P>
	Officials previously have said Kanyi, upon arriving at Kennedy  
Airport, consented to an X-ray search that revealed he had 
swallowed the balloons and that customs ``had no control over the 
actions of the medical personnel at the hospital.''

<HEADLINE> Reagan Biographer Inserts Fiction </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- In the fourth year after Ronald Reagan left  
office, his authorized biographer was feeling stuck on the book he 
was supposed to write. It was then, Edmund Morris says, that he 
decided to weave fiction into his facts. 
</P>
<P>
	Reagan ``was eluding me even as he eluded everyone else,''  
Morris tells Newsweek magazine. ``When you asked him a question 
about himself, it was like dropping a stone into a well and not 
hearing a splash.'' 
</P>
<P>
	So seven years after being granted frequent access to Reagan and  
under a $3 million contract for the book with Random House, Morris 
decided to break his biographer's block by inserting himself as a 
sometimes-fictional character in the narrative. 
</P>
<P>
	Newsweek excerpts 10,000 words of the book, ``Dutch: A Memoir of  
Ronald Reagan,'' in magazines on newsstands Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	Morris said he got the idea as he walked the campus of Reagan's  
alma mater, Eureka College, in 1992. ``I thought of Reagan. If only 
I could have been there in the fall of 1928! I could describe him 
as vividly as I could describe him as president.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He said: ``My idea was to give physical form to the biographer's  
mind. It was already there. I just gave it flesh.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Morris reinvents himself and others around him a way that allows  
him to interact with Reagan and other real people in the former 
president's distant past. The Associated Press obtained an advance 
copy of the book, which goes on sale Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	Some historians and others have been critical of Morris'  
technique, in advance of seeing the book. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've never understood the patronizing neurosis among our print  
editors and our television producers that everything these days, 
whether it be a report from Chechnya or a new series on 
`Masterpiece Theatre,' has to be announced, introduced, explained, 
`made easy,' by some authoritative figure,'' Morris told Newsweek. 
</P>
<P>
	``Why can't an original approach be allowed to explain itself?''

<HEADLINE>  IMF, World Bank Talks Get Started </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The global economy seems a much calmer place  
compared with a year ago, when a prolonged currency crisis in Asia 
and a collapsing Russian ruble roiled financial markets worldwide. 
</P>
<P>
	But that does not mean finance officials will not have a lot to  
discuss as they gather for the annual meetings of the 182-nation 
International Monetary Fund and its sister lending organization, 
the World Bank. 
</P>
<P>
	A sharp decline in the value of the U.S. dollar against the  
Japanese yen, allegations of widespread money laundering in Russia 
and a crushing burden of debt being carried by the world's poorest 
countries are expected to be top agenda items this year. 
</P>
<P>
	The discussions were getting under way today with talks among  
the finance ministers and central bank presidents of the world's 
seven largest economies -- the United States, Japan, Germany, 
France, Britain, Italy and Canada. 
</P>
<P>
	Before the G-7 talks began, Treasury Secretary Lawrence Summers  
and Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan met with Japanese 
Finance Minister Kiichi Miyazawa and Masaru Hayami, head of the 
Bank of Japan. 
</P>
<P>
	Afterwards, Treasury spokeswoman Michelle Smith described the  
one-hour meeting as a ``very good and full discussion of the range 
of issues on the agenda.'' 
</P>
<P>
	She refused to elaborate on positions taken by either country.  
But before the talks, Summers had made it clear U.S. officials 
would raise concerns that even though Japan's economy has finally 
begun to show signs of emerging from its worst recession in 50 
years, the Japanese must continue to push stimulative policies to 
keep the fledgling recovery on track. 
</P>
<P>
	With the prospects for the global economy looking better than  
the darkest days of the currency crisis, finance officials said it 
would be important to keep pressing ahead with various ideas to 
reform the world's financial architecture, primarily by putting in 
place tougher standards in such areas as banking and release of 
timely economic data. 
</P>
<P>
	``There is a unanimous view that there is no time for  
complacency,'' Canadian Finance Minister Paul Martin told reporters 
today. 
</P>
<P>
	Summers was making his maiden appearance as the Clinton  
administration's top economic spokesman at these gatherings, 
although he attended many previous G-7 sessions as top deputy to 
his predecessor, Robert Rubin. 
</P>
<P>
	In a pre-meeting briefing, Summers told reporters that the  
United States continues to believe that the proper policy response 
to keeping the dollar in proper relation to the yen was for the 
United States and Japan to focus on getting their underlying 
economic fundamentals correct, rather than resorting to government 
intervention in currency markets. 
</P>
<P>
	``A continued Japanese commitment to continued stimulus, using  
all available tools, will be critical until a solid, 
self-sustaining recovery led by domestic demand is firmly 
entrenched,'' Summers said. 
</P>
<P>
	Japan had hoped for more support on the side of currency  
intervention, fearing that without efforts to prop up the dollar, 
Japanese exporters could suffer competitively in global markets. 
</P>
<P>
	But Summers contends Japan needs to worry more about boosting  
demand at home rather than relying on exports to lift it out of its 
worst recession in 50 years. 
</P>
<P>
	The G-7 countries were likely to have more agreement on debt  
relief. The administration asked Congress this week for nearly $1 
billion to support the U.S. share of a plan to provide up to $90 
billion in debt relief for the world's 41 poorest nations in coming 
years. 
</P>
<P>
	One sticking point has been how the IMF would finance its share  
of this effort. Summers and IMF Managing Director Michel Camdessus 
have indicated that agreement is close on a proposal to allow the 
IMF to revalue 14 million ounces of its gold reserves at world 
prices, freeing up money for the debt effort. 
</P>
<P>
	Russian officials will join the G-7 group at the end of the  
discussions and are certain to face questions about unfolding 
investigations into allegations that Russian mobsters laundered 
money through Western banks. 
</P>
<P>
	The IMF, however, has indicated that its checking has uncovered  
no evidence that IMF funds were misused and Camdessus told 
reporters Thursday that the Russian government is exceeding IMF 
guidelines for economic performance and will likely receive the 
next installment of a $4.5 billion loan program in October. 
</P>
<P>
	Today's G-7 discussions will be followed with meetings Sunday  
through Thursday of the IMF and World Bank. One of the topics will 
be continued reforms of the two institutions so they will be able 
to better cope with future Asian-style currency crises. 
</P>
<P>
	Among the items to be considered are requirements for greater  
transparency by the international lending institutions, so 
investors aren't caught by surprise, and codes of good practice for 
nations in such areas as banking.

<P>
	The discussions were getting under way today with talks among  
the finance ministers and central bank presidents of the world's 
seven largest economies -- the United States, Japan, Germany, 
France, Britain, Italy and Canada. 
</P>
<P>
	Before the G-7 talks began, Treasury Secretary Lawrence Summers  
and Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan met with Japanese 
Finance Minister Kiichi Miyazawa and Masaru Hayami, head of the 
Bank of Japan. 
</P>
<P>
	Afterwards, Treasury spokeswoman Michelle Smith described the  
one-hour meeting as a ``very good and full discussion of the range 
of issues on the agenda.'' 
</P>
<P>
	She refused to elaborate on positions taken by either country.  
But before the talks, Summers had made it clear U.S. officials 
would raise concerns that even though Japan's economy has finally 
begun to show signs of emerging from its worst recession in 50 
years, the Japanese must continue to push stimulative policies to 
keep the fledgling recovery on track. 
</P>
<P>
	With the prospects for the global economy looking better than  
the darkest days of the currency crisis, finance officials said it 
would be important to keep pressing ahead with various ideas to 
reform the world's financial architecture, primarily by putting in 
place tougher standards in such areas as banking and release of 
timely economic data. 
</P>
<P>
	``There is a unanimous view that there is no time for  
complacency,'' Canadian Finance Minister Paul Martin told reporters 
today. 
</P>
<P>
	Summers was making his maiden appearance as the Clinton  
administration's top economic spokesman at these gatherings, 
although he attended many previous G-7 sessions as top deputy to 
his predecessor, Robert Rubin. 
</P>
<P>
	In a pre-meeting briefing, Summers told reporters that the  
United States continues to believe that the proper policy response 
to keeping the dollar in proper relation to the yen was for the 
United States and Japan to focus on getting their underlying 
economic fundamentals correct, rather than resorting to government 
intervention in currency markets. 
</P>
<P>
	``A continued Japanese commitment to continued stimulus, using  
all available tools, will be critical until a solid, 
self-sustaining recovery led by domestic demand is firmly 
entrenched,'' Summers said. 
</P>
<P>
	Japan had hoped for more support on the side of currency  
intervention, fearing that without efforts to prop up the dollar, 
Japanese exporters could suffer competitively in global markets. 
</P>
<P>
	But Summers contends Japan needs to worry more about boosting  
demand at home rather than relying on exports to lift it out of its 
worst recession in 50 years. 
</P>
<P>
	The G-7 countries were likely to have more agreement on debt  
relief. The administration asked Congress this week for nearly $1 
billion to support the U.S. share of a plan to provide up to $90 
billion in debt relief for the world's 41 poorest nations in coming 
years. 
</P>
<P>
	One sticking point has been how the IMF would finance its share  
of this effort. Summers and IMF Managing Director Michel Camdessus 
have indicated that agreement is close on a proposal to allow the 
IMF to revalue 14 million ounces of its gold reserves at world 
prices, freeing up money for the debt effort. 
</P>
<P>
	Russian officials will join the G-7 group at the end of the  
discussions and are certain to face questions about unfolding 
investigations into allegations that Russian mobsters laundered 
money through Western banks. 
</P>
<P>
	The IMF, however, has indicated that its checking has uncovered  
no evidence that IMF funds were misused and Camdessus told 
reporters Thursday that the Russian government is exceeding IMF 
guidelines for economic performance and will likely receive the 
next installment of a $4.5 billion loan program in October. 
</P>
<P>
	Today's G-7 discussions will be followed with meetings Sunday  
through Thursday of the IMF and World Bank. One of the topics will 
be continued reforms of the two institutions so they will be able 
to better cope with future Asian-style currency crises. 
</P>
<P>
	Among the items to be considered are requirements for greater  
transparency by the international lending institutions, so 
investors aren't caught by surprise, and codes of good practice for 
nations in such areas as banking.

<HEADLINE> No End Yet to Kaiser Labor Dispute </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SPOKANE, Wash. (AP) -- Stan White is spending more time  
housecleaning these days, and he's looking for work. His daughter 
had to transfer to a college closer to home to save money. 
</P>
<P>
	White is among nearly 3,000 United Steelworkers who have been  
off the job since Sept. 30, 1998 because of a labor dispute with 
Kaiser Aluminum &AMP; Chemical Corp. 
</P>
<P>
	``I was the prime breadwinner, now my wife is,'' said White, 58.  
``Our income was chopped down 60 percent.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Workers at five Kaiser aluminum plants around the country went  
on strike in a dispute over wages, benefits and job security. On 
Jan. 13, the workers offered to return to their jobs while 
negotiations continued, but the company refused and locked them 
out. 
</P>
<P>
	Since then, the plants have operated with managers and  
replacement workers. The latest round of talks broke up in 
mid-August and no new meetings are scheduled. 
</P>
<P>
	In the midst of the nation's economic boom, this labor dispute  
has drawn little attention. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's odd for me to read in newspapers about how the average  
wage in the nation is going up and employers are more desperate for 
skilled employees,'' said Larry Strom, a 19-year employee and union 
leader. 
</P>
<P>
	More than 2,000 of the striking employees work at two plants in  
the Spokane area. Much smaller plants are in Tacoma, Wash.; 
Gramercy, La.; and Newark, Ohio. 
</P>
<P>
	Kaiser has lost millions of dollars since the strike began.  
Numerous replacement workers have been injured and the Gramercy 
plant was heavily damaged by an accidental explosion in July. But 
it isn't planning to capitulate. 
</P>
<P>
	``We can run indefinitely in the way we are running today,''  
Kaiser President Ray Milchovich said. ``A number of these 
operations, especially in Spokane, are at all-time record 
performance levels.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In its latest offer, Kaiser proposed pay increases of $3.13 per  
hour over a 5-year contract, plus some benefits improvements. 
</P>
<P>
	Kaiser says pay and benefits for most workers cost the company  
about $62,000 per year. Union officials said that translates to 
take-home pay of about $15 an hour. 
</P>
<P>
	But Kaiser also is demanding that 700 workers be laid off. And  
it wants 239 jobs covered by the old contract -- including janitors 
and groundskeepers -- to be ``outsourced'' to nonunion workers. 
</P>
<P>
	``That's union-busting,'' said Jon Youngdahl, a steelworkers  
official in Auburn. 
</P>
<P>
	The dispute contrasts with generally good management-labor  
relations in the aluminum industry, said David Foster, the union's 
chief negotiator. 
</P>
<P>
	``Kaiser is fighting over tenths-of-a-penny per pound in labor  
cost savings,'' Foster said. 
</P>
<P>
	But company negotiator Jeremy Sherman said the issues total  
millions of dollars per year and jeopardize the company's survival. 
</P>
<P>
	``The Steelworkers would like to create the myth that it would  
have been more favorable to accept a Steelworker contract. That is 
untrue,'' Sherman said. ``It's analogous to a shakedown artist who 
says `pay me this money, because if you don't I'll burn down your 
store.''' 
</P>
<P>
	Foster said the dispute is preventing Kaiser, the nation's fifth  
largest aluminum producer, from merging with some of the other 
major players in the industry. In August, Alcoa Inc. struck a deal 
to buy Reynolds Metals Inc. in a $4 billion-plus agreement that 
would join the world's No. 1 and No. 3 aluminum companies. 
</P>
<P>
	Many workers were prepared for a lengthy walkout, and a union  
strike fund has paid them $90 to $125 a week depending on need. 
</P>
<P>
	But unemployment benefits ran out in mid-August, noted Strom,  
vice president of Steelworkers Local 329. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'd like people to understand things are getting more tense as  
folks run out of unemployment,'' Strom said.

<HEADLINE> DiCaprio Settles $10M Suit </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Leonardo DiCaprio and fellow actor Tobey  
Maguire have settled a $10 million lawsuit that accused them of 
trying to block the release of an independent film they appeared 
in. 
</P>
<P>
	Under the agreement announced Friday, the film will be  
distributed outside the United States, Canada and their 
territories, but will not be shown commercially in the United 
States and Canada. 
</P>
<P>
	David Stuman, who produced the low-budget, black-and-white film  
titled ``Don's Plum,'' alleged that DiCaprio and Maguire used 
DiCaprio's superstar status to block distribution of the 1995 film 
because Maguire, who starred in ``Pleasantville,'' was displeased 
with his performance. 
</P>
<P>
	Through a publicist's statement last year, the defendants said  
they made the film as a ``favor to a friend'' and did so under the 
agreement that it would never be promoted as a ``feature-length 
motion picture.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The short film is about a group of young people who meet at a  
diner one night for coffee to discuss various subjects.

	Clinton Said To Be In Good Health  
</P>
<P>
	BETHESDA, Md. (AP) -- President Clinton has gained 18 pounds  
since his last complete physical examination but is in ``excellent 
health,'' a team of doctors reported today. They said swollen vocal 
cords were causing his recent hoarseness and recommended he rest 
his voice. The 53-year-old president, who has enjoyed generally 
good health since entering the White House in 1993, weighs 214 
pounds, still within the normal range of up to 220 pounds for a 
6-foot-2-inch man, said Clinton's physician, Dr. Connie Mariano.

	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The United States and its wealthy allies told  
Russian authorities today there was a ``critical need'' for that 
country to attack corruption and money laundering. Russian Finance 
Minister Mikhail Kasyanov met with financial leaders from the 
world's seven largest industrial countries in an effort to answer 
questions that have been raised in the wake of the money laundering 
probes. Kasyanov said that Russia had already begun taking measures 
to control capital flight from the country, a term that covers both 
the legal transfer of money and illegal transfers.

	Firms Vie for Baghdad Oil Contracts  
</P>
<P>
	BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) -- More than 50 international firms lobbied  
furiously today for contracts to revamp Iraq's ailing oil industry. 
The firms hope to sell Iraq spare parts under its U.N.-approved oil 
program, which allows Iraq to spend $900 million to rehabilitate 
its production and export facilities. The U.N. program is an 
exemption from sanctions imposed on Iraq for invading Kuwait in 
1990. Baghdad has said the sanctions have hindered its oil program 
by holding up contracts for spare parts and equipment.

	WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Clinton and the House's top  
Republican found little common ground today as they took the tax 
cut fight to the airwaves. Clinton wants negotiations on tax cuts 
less than the $792 billion package he vetoed Thursday and on money 
for debt reduction and programs the GOP wants eliminated. Speaker

<HEADLINE> GOP Planning Tax Breaks in HMO Bill </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- House Republican leaders are crafting a plan  
to add tax breaks for long-term care insurance and health insurance 
for the self-employed to legislation regulating managed care 
companies, according to congressional sources. 
</P>
<P>
	The move is part of a broader effort to leave a GOP stamp on  
legislation granting patients the right to sue their HMOs -- a bill 
the White House favors and appears headed for passage over the 
opposition of many Republicans. 
</P>
<P>
	These sources, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said the GOP  
leadership also is expected to try for approval of an amendment 
limiting damage awards in medical malpractice lawsuits. A bill that 
contains both the right to sue and limits on malpractice awards 
could confront Democrats with a difficult political choice as they 
decide how to vote on final approval. 
</P>
<P>
	House Speaker Dennis Hastert, R-Ill., has pledged the House will  
debate the HMO legislation the first week in October. 
</P>
<P>
	``This will allow members of the House to fairly express their  
views on the important subjects of patient protections and access 
to quality health care,'' he said in a recent statement. 
</P>
<P>
	The GOP leadership has been debating privately how to shape the  
outcome of the debate, and is expected to unveil its proposed tax 
add-ons on Tuesday. While final decisions have not been made, 
several officials said these proposals are under discussion and 
likely to be included: 
</P>
<P>
	--A new deduction to offset part of the cost of long-term care  
insurance. 
</P>
<P>
	--A new deduction for caretakers of elderly family members;  
</P>
<P>
	--An increased deduction to offset the cost of health insurance  
expenses for the self-employed, as well as for individuals who not 
offered insurance at their place of employment. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition, the leadership is expected to embrace expansion of  
an existing demonstration program for medical savings accounts, 
which are high deductible plans. Many Democrats oppose these 
accounts, saying they fear younger, healthier individuals will opt 
out of traditional policies, and drive up the cost of insuring the 
older, sicker population that is left. 
</P>
<P>
	Most of the tax proposals were included in a broader $792  
billion tax cut measure that President Clinton vetoed Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	It was unclear whether the GOP plan was to offer the tax  
provisions as amendments to the HMO measure, or bring them to the 
floor in a companion bill that would be debated simultaneously. 
</P>
<P>
	The decision to attempt to inject them onto the HMO debate  
follows a decision to try and attach several components of the 
vetoed tax bill onto a minimum wage measure expected on the House 
floor later this fall. 
</P>
<P>
	Both steps come as the leadership grapples this fall with a  
series of items on the Democratic legislation agenda. 
</P>
<P>
	The health care measure has bedeviled the GOP leadership for  
months. Dissident Republicans, led by Rep. Charles Norwood, R-Ga., 
joined forces with Democrats in August behind a measure containing 
the right to sue HMOs. The bill contains several other guarantees 
for patients and covers all 161 million Americans with health 
insurance; it drew the immediate opposition of the health insurance 
industry. 
</P>
<P>
	A second measure, containing a more limited right to sue, has  
circulated, as well. One of its sponsors, Rep. Tom Coburn, R-Okla., 
said on Friday he may withdraw it. 
</P>
<P>
	Rep. John Boehner, R-Ohio, chairman of a key subcommittee on the  
issue, introduced a third bill last week. It establishes a system 
for an independent review of coverage disputes, and prescribes 
penalties for HMOs defying the rulings of the independent arbiters. 
But patients would not be allowed to sue. 
</P>
<P>
	``Patients don't want lawsuits. They want a system that punishes  
HMOs severely if they refuse to provide the treatment physicians 
prescribe,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	But many leadership aides concede a majority of the House seems  
ready to vote for a right to sue. That means the White 
House-supported measure is likely to pass, leaving Hastert and 
other top Republicans in the position of attempting to reshape it 
through amendment. 
</P>
<P>
	The Senate approved legislation earlier this year that made  
changes in certain health plans, but drew a swift veto threat from 
the White House for failing to do enough.

</P>
<P>
	The firms hope to sell Iraq spare parts under its U.N.-approved

rehabilitate its production and export facilities. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are so happy to see so many firms are interested to supply  
Iraq with its needs despite these circumstances,'' Taha Hmoud, oil 
ministry undersecretary, told reporters as he opened an oil and gas 
technology exhibition, the first in Baghdad in 10 years. 
</P>
<P>
	The U.N. program is an exemption from sanctions imposed on Iraq  
for invading Kuwait in 1990. Baghdad has said the sanctions have 
hindered its oil program by holding up contracts for spare parts 
and equipment. 
</P>
<P>
	Most of the firms participating in the exhibition came from  
Britain, France, Italy and Canada. U.S. businesses stayed away 
because ``of the pressure by the American administration on these 
companies,'' Hmoud said. He said Iraq was prepared to buy from the 
United States if American companies wanted to sell. 
</P>
<P>
	At the fair, executives argued prices and specifications with  
Iraqi officials and handed out glossy brochures. 
</P>
<P>
	The oil deal was first initiated in December 1996 and is meant  
to serve the country's humanitarian needs. 
</P>
<P>
	Iraq currently exports an average of 2.2 million barrels a day  
and Hmoud said his ministry was determined to boost that output.

<HEADLINE> Bill Would Double Anti-Spying Funds </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Angered by allegations of Chinese spying,  
Senate and House negotiators more than doubled the amount to be 
spent on counterintelligence next year at the nation's nuclear 
weapons laboratories. 
</P>
<P>
	A House-Senate conference committee set aside $39 million for  
operations against spying in the fiscal year beginning Friday, 
compared with $19 million in the current budget year. 
</P>
<P>
	In all, the $21.3 billion Energy and Water Development  
Appropriations bill sets aside more than $4.4 billion for the 
Department of Energy to operate the three laboratories, Sen. Pete 
Domenici, R-N.M., said Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
	That is an increase of $102.2 million in DOE funding.  
</P>
<P>
	``This has been a very difficult year for DOE and our national  
laboratories, but these hardships should serve as a clarion call to 
reform and move away from a complacency that has compromised our 
national security,'' Domenici, chairman of the Senate 
Appropriations energy subcommittee, said in a statement. 
</P>
<P>
	Just Thursday, Attorney General Janet Reno said the Justice  
Department and FBI are expanding an almost 4-year-old investigation 
into an alleged theft of weapons secrets by Chinese agents. She 
said the FBI had new information but did not elaborate. 
</P>
<P>
	So far, the investigation into alleged Chinese theft of secrets  
involving one of the most advanced U.S. nuclear warheads has 
centered on the National Weapons Laboratory at Los Alamos, N.M. 
</P>
<P>
	A Los Alamos employee, Wen Ho Lee, was suspected for years and  
fired in March, although the government admits it lacks evidence to 
charge him. 
</P>
<P>
	China has denied stealing U.S. nuclear secrets  
</P>
<P>
	The largest chunk of the Energy Department's funding in the  
appropriations bill, $4.2 billion, goes for computer monitoring, 
storing, maintaining and dismantling the U.S. nuclear stockpile. 
</P>
<P>
	The bill also includes money for helping Russia keep its  
weapons-grade weapons materiel away from terrorists. 
</P>
<P>
	The House and Senate had been at odds over the bill for months  
and at one time were more than $1.1 billion apart in how much to 
appropriate for the national laboratories in New Mexico and 
California.

<P>
	TARBORO, N.C. (AP) -- Barbara Pittman dragged water-logged carpet  
from her husband's church on Saturday, past walls where the Tar 
River had left a dark line more than a foot above her head. 
</P>
<P>
	``Through it all I didn't cry, but this morning I saw all the  
work we had to do,'' she said from the steps of His Majesty Church 
Saturday. ``I sat down and said, 'Lord, we just need some help.' 
Then we heard the knock on the door. That was the first time I 
cried.'' 
</P>
<P>
	As floodwaters receded Saturday and people began scrubbing mud  
and debris from homes and stores across eastern North Carolina, 
volunteers by the busloads made their way into ravaged communities 
like Tarboro to lend a hand. 
</P>
<P>
	The Rev. James Hight was waiting outside Mrs. Pittman's door  
Saturday morning with seven members of his Axton, Va., congregation 
and a trailer of supplies. Across town, Asheville telephone 
repairman Mike Wright was rewiring a darkened law office for an 
attorney he had never met. 
</P>
<P>
	``Everybody's opened their heart, and it's just poured out,''  
said John Jenkins, 57. He leaned against the doorway of his real 
estate office and watched strangers pull water-damaged equipment 
from neighboring businesses onto downtown sidewalks to be hauled 
away. 
</P>
<P>
	Twenty-nine emergency shelters remained open Saturday with 2,790  
residents, and parts of the state were still under water. About 
7,800 homes and businesses were still without power, and more than 
790 North Carolina homes had been destroyed. The state revised its 
death toll attributed to Hurricane Floyd to 47. 
</P>
<P>
	Federal officials have estimated the destruction wrought by  
Floyd will top the $6 billion in damaged caused in the state three 
years ago by Hurricane Fran. 
</P>
<P>
	``For the most part, this region is not wealthy by any stretch  
of the imagination,'' said Tad Boggs, a spokesman for Gov. Jim 
Hunt. ``You see people who didn't have much who have lost it all.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Since the governor went on national television Tuesday pleading  
for help for his battered state, more than $329,000 has poured into 
a state relief fund. 
</P>
<P>
	Churches and schools have become collection centers for  
clothing, cleaning supplies and other items. And corporate 
donations have rolled in to supplement federal grants and loans to 
help flood victims get back on their feet. 
</P>
<P>
	Other gifts have been more creative. At Tarboro's shelters,  
people left homeless by the floodwaters munched on 400 pounds of 
ribs, chicken and sandwiches donated by the Community Culinary 
School of Charlotte, a job-training program for the unemployed. 
</P>
<P>
	Across Tarboro, there were little signs of thanks for the  
volunteers. On a road leading to the Edgecombe County emergency 
operations center, someone had taped up a piece of cardboard with 
the message: ``Thank you to the USA for all your help. Tarboro 
loves you.''

<HEADLINE> US Rescuers Find Trouble in Taiwan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TAIPEI, Taiwan (AP) -- American rescuers who freed a man from the  
rubble of Taiwan's killer quake said Saturday the wrecked buildings 
here were even more shoddily constructed than those they 
encountered in last month's killer earthquake in Turkey. 
</P>
<P>
	``These are probably the worst buildings we've seen in a long  
time,'' said Dewey Perks, a firefighter who lives in Leesburg, Va., 
but travels the world to save people in disasters like the 
7.6-magnitude earthquake that struck Taiwan on Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Members of the elite Fairfax County Urban Search and Rescue Team  
flew in the day after the quake with a few colleagues from 
Miami-Dade, Fla. Their mission was called off Friday when they 
stopped finding signs of life. 
</P>
<P>
	The rescuers said support pillars of the wrecked buildings had  
been made of concrete that was poured around empty oil cans, 
creating huge bubbles of air within that easily collapsed when the 
quake struck. 
</P>
<P>
	``Maybe they were trying to save some money on concrete,'' said  
Robert Rojas, a firefighter from the Metro Dade squad in Miami. 
``That's horrendous.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Taiwanese authorities have reportedly arrested several building  
contractors. Sixteen more have been prevented from leaving the 
island as authorities probe the construction irregularities that 
outraged Taiwan. 
</P>
<P>
	Some 2,000 people died in the quake.  
</P>
<P>
	The U.S. rescuers said they saw similar corner-cutting just last  
month in cheap Turkish buildings that were built using salty sea 
sand in the concrete. Many collapsed during the Aug. 17 quake that 
killed more than 15,000 people in Turkey. 
</P>
<P>
	But even the crumbly concrete in Turkey was ``a heck of a lot  
better than newspapers and oil cans'' that contractors in Taiwan 
used to put up the buildings that crumpled, Rojas said. 
</P>
<P>
	The Taiwan quake was the Virginia team's ninth mission. Other  
assignments have included an earthquake in Armenia, the Oklahoma 
City bombing and bombings of the U.S. embassies in Tanzania and 
Kenya. 
</P>
<P>
	Within hours of arriving in Taiwan, they had found and rescued  
33-year-old survivor Hsu Tse-kai from a ruined building in Touliu 
in earthquake-rocked central Taiwan. They kept working, using 
sniffing dogs and sonar listening devices, but found no more signs 
of life. 
</P>
<P>
	Rescuers said the decision to stop digging is made more  
difficult by the grief of people at the scene who are still 
clinging to hopes -- however slim -- that a loved one in the rubble 
might still be alive. 
</P>
<P>
	``You always hope that you can save more than you ever end up  
saving,'' Perks said.

<HEADLINE> AL Umpire Suspended Three Games </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- For the second time this season, baseball has  
called an umpire out. 
</P>
<P>
	American League president Gene Budig suspended John Shulock for  
three games Friday and fined him an undisclosed amount for ``overly 
aggressive behavior, display of temper, inappropriate remarks and 
physical contact'' with Tampa Bay catcher Mike DeFelice. 
</P>
<P>
	Budig, whose job is being eliminated by commissioner Bud Selig,  
acted on the blowup that occurred in a game between Anaheim and 
Tampa Bay on Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	Earlier in the season, National League umpire Tom Hallion was  
suspended for three games without pay for allegedly bumping 
Colorado catcher Jeff Reed and pitching coach Milt May. 
</P>
<P>
	Terry Tata, working the game with Hallion, denied Hallion had  
made contact with Reed and May. 
</P>
<P>
	Working behind the plate in the game at Anaheim, Shulock was  
struck in the mask in the third inning by a pitch from Tampa Bay's 
Wilson Alvarez that sailed past DeFelice. The umpire thought he was 
hit deliberately and headed out for the mound to confront Alvarez. 
</P>
<P>
	DeFelice intercepted Shulock and Devil Rays manager Larry  
Rothschild came out of the dugout to protect his players. 
</P>
<P>
	An argument ensued and Shulock apparently made contact with  
DeFelice as he yelled at Alvarez, who was not ejected but was 
removed from the game by Rothschild. After the game, won by Anaheim 
10-5, Shulock said he believed the pitcher had thrown at him on 
purpose and the catcher made no effort on the ball. 
</P>
<P>
	``The more I think about it, I think he (Alvarez) did it  
intentionally,'' Shulock said. ``I can't prove it, but I'm upset, 
and I have a right to be.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Shulock said the Devil Rays had been complaining about ball and  
strike calls during the game and he thought that was behind the 
pitch which struck him. 
</P>
<P>
	Alvarez, DeFelice and Rothschild all refused to discuss the  
matter before the Devil Rays played the New York Yankees on Friday 
night. 
</P>
<P>
	Shulock, who was working the Chicago-Minnesota game Friday night  
at Minneapolis, also refused comment. 
</P>
<P>
	On Monday night, Alvarez said there was no intent on the pitch.  
</P>
<P>
	``Mike called for a fastball away, and I threw one that went  
down the middle,'' he said. ``I wasn't trying to hit him. Those 
things happen.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Shulock wasn't convinced.  
</P>
<P>
	``The catcher called for a curve, and he throws a fastball,'' he  
said. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm not going to call strikes on pitches that are outside just  
to make someone look good. If he can't throw strikes, it's not my 
fault. He had a bad night. I didn't. The only thing he could hit 
all night were the Angels' bats, and my mask. 
</P>
<P>
	``If that's the way he wants to be, what goes around comes  
around. He'll get his.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Shulock is not a member of the umpires union. He was hired as a  
replacement umpire in 1979 when the regular umps struck major 
league baseball for seven weeks. Shulock was retained after the 
strike ended. 
</P>
<P>
	Even though he is not a member, the union said if he chose to  
file a grievance over the suspension, it would pursue the matter 
for him. 
</P>
<P>
	Budig said Shulock would not work the final three games of the  
season with his crew. 
</P>
<P>
	At the time of Hallion's suspension, baseball officials couldn't  
recall another time an umpire was sanctioned in such a way for an 
on-field dispute. 
</P>
<P>
	Hallion was one of 22 umpires whose resignations were accepted  
by baseball and who lost their jobs Sept. 2.

<HEADLINE> Hospitals Treating Floyd Victims </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	RALEIGH, N.C. (AP) -- Lacerations, bee stings and sick stomachs  
from contaminated water are keeping emergency room doctors busy as 
floodwaters recede in eastern North Carolina. 
</P>
<P>
	But so far, there have been no outbreaks of infectious disease,  
health officials said. The federal Centers for Disease Control and 
Prevention is helping the state health department keep an eye on 
illnesses so they can corral any possible outbreak. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're seeing people whose lives have just been devastated.  
What's remarkable is that we haven't seen more'' illnesses and 
injuries, said Dr. Herb Garrison of Pitt County Memorial Hospital. 
</P>
<P>
	Flooding caused sewage treatment plants and hog waste lagoons to  
overflow and contaminate drinking water supplies. Farming and 
industrial chemicals have worsened the problem. In some areas, 
people must drink bottled water or boil tap water, probably for 
weeks to come. 
</P>
<P>
	``Now, especially due to the flooding, we are seeing more nausea  
and diarrhea, from drinking contaminated water, most likely,'' Dr. 
Cathy Dover of Lenoir County Memorial Hospital said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're also seeing a lot of rashes, poison ivy, a lot of fire  
ant (bites). We've seen a few individuals bitten by dogs over the 
past several days.'' 
</P>
<P>
	More problems are expected to emerge over the weekend,  
especially mosquitoes. 
</P>
<P>
	In some areas, they are already thick enough that a person  
standing still will be bitten 200 times in one minute, said Johanna 
Reese of the state Division of Environmental Health. Planes are 
scheduled to start spraying pesticides next week. 
</P>
<P>
	Mosquitoes can spread a deadly encephalitis. While encephalitis  
is rare, health officials are stepping up efforts to watch for the 
disease in horses and chickens. 
</P>
<P>
	``Normally if you're going to have an outbreak of encephalitis,  
you see it in the animals first and then the humans,'' said Dr. 
Christopher Ohl of Pitt County Memorial Hospital. 
</P>
<P>
	Molds growing in soaked furniture and carpeting could intensify  
asthma and allergy problems. Infections borne by molds can cause 
fever, coughing and wheezing, Ohl said. 
</P>
<P>
	Hundreds of thousands of dead hogs, chickens and turkeys still  
pose a health threat because they attract swarms of flies. 
</P>
<P>
	State health officials are trying to stop flies from spreading  
by sprinkling piles of carcasses with insecticides that kill 
maggots, Reese said.

<HEADLINE> Injuries Give Browns Have New Look </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BEREA, Ohio (AP) -- The Cleveland Browns aren't the same team  
that got shut out by Pittsburgh in Week 1 or lost at Tennessee last 
weekend. Experience has changed them. 
</P>
<P>
	So have injuries.  
</P>
<P>
	Going into just their third NFL game, the expansion Browns are  
banged up. 
</P>
<P>
	Cleveland is down five regulars because of injuries following  
last week's loss at Tennessee. Losing that many players would hurt 
any team, never mind one in its first year and one with such little 
depth. 
</P>
<P>
	``That happens during the course of the year,'' Browns coach  
Chris Palmer said. ``You look around the league at what has 
happened, everyone has had key injuries. You just have to keep 
going and hope your young players step up.'' 
</P>
<P>
	On defense, safety Tim McTyer (broken left arm), cornerback  
Antonio Langham (fractured thumb) and tackle John Jurkovic (bruised 
clavicle) are out. While on offense, tight end Irv Smith (sprained 
knee) and right guard Steve Zahursky (sprained knee) will miss 
Sunday's game. 
</P>
<P>
	``Everyone has nicks and bruises,'' he said. ``The strong teams  
survive.'' 
</P>
<P>
	With only seven defensive backs dressing, Palmer said he will  
continually substitute to keep his players fresh and to counter 
anything Ravens coach Brian Billick runs on offense. 
</P>
<P>
	Marlon Forbes will replace McTyer as the starter in the base  
defense, and Ray Jackson, inactive against Pittsburgh and 
Tennessee, will see his first playing time this season. 
</P>
<P>
	Forbes said the Browns DBs will have to play harder and smarter.  
</P>
<P>
	``We look around and see that there will be no one behind us,''  
Forbes said. ``That's all right. We're just going to have to go out 
there and fly around.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Fuller expects Billick, who directed Minnesota's offense to an  
NFL scoring record last year, to try and exploit the Browns' 
inexperience in the secondary. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's got a lot of offensive plays in his mind,'' said Fuller,  
who faced Billick's offense every day in practice last year with 
the Vikings. ``He uses them all and puts his guys in position to 
make plays. Make plays down the field. I'm going to miss my man 
McTyer out there.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Cleveland's defensive line will also shuffle in players after  
Jurkovic came up hurting in practice this week. Darius Holland, 
Marcus Spriggs and Mike Thompson will rotate in along with Jerry 
Ball as the Browns try to make an inside rush at Baltimore 
quarterback Stoney Case. 
</P>
<P>
	Smith's injury will give Mark Campbell his first NFL start. Not  
bad for an undrafted tight end who didn't even start in college at 
Michigan. 
</P>
<P>
	Zahursky, a local kid, made his first NFL start last weekend,  
replacing Scott Rehberg. But Zahursky hurt his knee in practice on 
Thursday, moving Rehberg back up to starting status. 
</P>
<P>
	``You have to prepare everyday because you never know when your  
time is going to come,'' Rehberg said. ``It's unfortunate it had to 
happen. I was hoping to get my job back. I didn't want it to happen 
this way.''

<P>
	ISTANBUL, Turkey (AP) -- A bomb exploded late Saturday at the  
entrance of a clinic of the Turkish Red Crescent without causing 
any injuries, the Anatolia news agency reported. 
</P>
<P>
	The explosion shattered the windows on the ground floor of the  
five-story building on the European side of Istanbul. There was no 
immediate claim of responsibility. 
</P>
<P>
	Police were searching for two people seen running away from the  
building, Anatolia said. 
</P>
<P>
	The Turkish Red Crescent has been severely criticized for  
failing to provide adequate aid and housing for victims of the Aug.

<HEADLINE> Shuttle Columbia in Shop for Tuneup </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PALMDALE, Calif. (AP) -- Space shuttle Columbia, the oldest  
orbiter in the four-ship fleet, landed here Saturday for a 
long-overdue tuneup. 
</P>
<P>
	Columbia, which was bolted to the top of a modified Boeing 747,  
landed at a U.S. Air Force plant at 10:19 a.m., said Lynne Van 
Trieste, spokeswoman for Boeing. 
</P>
<P>
	The overhaul, expected to last until next July, is months late  
because of delays in launching the Chandra Observatory aboard 
Columbia, a mission that took place in July. 
</P>
<P>
	Columbia left its home port, the Kennedy Space Center in  
Florida, at 12:15 p.m. Friday followed by a scheduled overnight at 
Whiteman Air Force Base southeast of Kansas City. 
</P>
<P>
	Technicians at Boeing's Orbiter Assembly Facility will inspect  
thousands of components and make major improvements to Columbia, 
which has flown 122.2 million miles during 26 missions. 
</P>
<P>
	This will be Columbia's fourth inspection and overhaul since  
entering service in 1981.

<HEADLINE> Gore, Bradley Face 'Real Contest' </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Al Gore and Bill Bradley squared off Saturday  
for the first time, previewing a ``real contest with real choices'' 
between the sitting vice president and his surging challenger 
seeking the Democratic presidential nomination in 2000. 
</P>
<P>
	Addressing powerful Democrats from across the country, Gore  
promised to ``work my heart out'' for their support. Bradley urged 
them to embrace -- not shirk from -- a fight for the party's 
nomination. 
</P>
<P>
	``What better way to energize voters ... than a contest that  
brings two people together for a spirited debates of ideas -- a real 
contest with real choices decided by voters in caucuses and 
primaries throughout this nation,'' Bradley told the Democratic 
National Committee. 
</P>
<P>
	Gore walked from behind the lectern to wander the stage.  
Unusually informal and emotional, he energized the crowd with 
criticism of Republican front-runner George W. Bush. 
</P>
<P>
	Attacking Bush's pro-gun views, the vice president asked of  
Bush, ``Why don't you join us to take the weapons of evil out of 
the hands of evildoers?'' 
</P>
<P>
	In back-to-back speeches, neither candidate mentioned the other  
by name, though they slipped in subtle digs. It marked the first 
time the two foes made a joint appearance to court the same crowd, 
both campaigns said. 
</P>
<P>
	The 428 DNC members, most of whom are allies of Gore and  
President Clinton, cast votes at the Democratic presidential 
convention. 
</P>
<P>
	Though he is the party's front-runner, Gore had the biggest need  
for a solid speech. Even in the DNC's bastion of Gore allies, the 
perception is taking hold that his campaign is lackluster and 
suffering from ties to Clinton's scandal-plagued presidency. 
</P>
<P>
	Gore did not mention Clinton in his remarks.  
</P>
<P>
	In hallway and barroom conversations, the activists talked about  
new polls in New Hampshire showing Bradley in a dead heat with 
Gore. Independents and moderate Democrats are especially drawn to 
the former New Jersey senator in that first-in-the-nation primary 
state and in neighboring New York. 
</P>
<P>
	Gore holds big leads elsewhere.  
</P>
<P>
	``I'm telling people this is a long process and he's committed  
to working for America's families. We're solid in Iowa. We're solid 
in California,'' Gore campaign chairman Tony Coelho said. 
</P>
<P>
	Bradley hoped to continue mending relations with some hardcore  
Democrats who recall that he left the Senate in 1996 after calling 
the political system -- and, by implication, his party -- ``broken.'' 
</P>
<P>
	With an understated delivery, Bradley tried to spell out why  
Democrats should consider rejecting Gore and giving him a serious 
look. He gave the Clinton administration credit for improving race 
relations and the economy, but he said more needed to be done on 
those and other issues. 
</P>
<P>
	``We've accomplished so much,'' he said in an implicit  
recognition of the Clinton-Gore successes, but, ``What else is 
there to do?'' 
</P>
<P>
	Gun control, poverty, health care and campaign finance reform  
were among the topics he promised to champion, eventually drawing 
contrasts with Gore. He spent little or no time on other issues 
critical to the Democratic base -- abortion, Medicare and Social 
Security. Gore talked about all three. 
</P>
<P>
	In the end, perhaps recognizing the audience was stacked in  
Gore's favor, Bradley struck a civil tone. ``I want you to know 
that whether you are for me or against me that we share that same 
goal of mutual respect,'' Bradley said. 
</P>
<P>
	Gore, accused of being too stiff for presidential politics, used  
his hands for emphasis. He echoed Bradley's call for gun control 
but focused more on family and education issues. 
</P>
<P>
	He, too, offered veiled criticism of his challenger. ``I have  
never been for (school) vouchers,'' Gore said, recognizing that 
most of the activists know that Bradley once supported limited 
programs. 
</P>
<P>
	Gore's campaign clearly wants to make the case that Bradley  
abandoned the party in 1996 and Gore is the race's true Democrat. 
The vice president's supporters wore buttons that read, ``ALways a 
Democrat'' -- with ``AL'' in blue letters and the rest in red. 
</P>
<P>
	The flashy, expensive Gore campaign and ploddingly efficient  
Bradley campaigns showed their stuff. 
</P>
<P>
	Bradley made a non-descript entry to the room, spoke with  
reading glasses perched atop his nose and waded through the crowd 
afterward. Gore sped through the crowd, flanked by Secret Service 
agents, with rock music blaring throughout the hall. 
</P>
<P>
	They were interrupted by applause in roughly the same numbers.  
Afterward, activists said both performed well but not great. 
</P>
<P>
	Both campaigns played their share of backroom games. The Bradley  
team e-mailed supporters urging them to attend the meeting. The 
work paid off with crowds of mostly young, sign-toting supporters 
that nearly rivaled the impressive showing produced by Gore's team. 
</P>
<P>
	Gore, who had been scheduled to speak before Bradley, abruptly  
sought and secured the final speaking slot -- making his the last 
impression left with activists. Gore deployed more staff and spent 
more time at the three-day meeting than Bradley.

<HEADLINE> Bulls GM Defends Rebuilding Effort </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	VANCOUVER, British Columbia (AP) -- Jerry Krause knows everyone  
around the NBA is watching him, whispering that his secret plan for 
rebuilding the Chicago Bulls might be fundamentally flawed. 
</P>
<P>
	Fifteen months after the team's sixth championship, eight months  
after the retirement of Michael Jordan and the dismantling of 
Chicago's dynasty, Krause's Bulls are a bad team that can expect to 
remain wretched for at least another year, probably more. 
</P>
<P>
	Is he nervous? Yes. Will he panic? No.  
</P>
<P>
	``I know people are saying: `The Sleuth' must have something up  
his sleeve.' But they give me too much credit,'' Krause said. 
``We're just taking it slow. 
</P>
<P>
	``Everybody has to do things his own way, and I'm taking it  
little by little.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Krause didn't play his hand this summer, hoarding his salary cap  
space, opting not to make a draft night trade and adding three 
aging veterans -- Will Perdue, Hersey Hawkins and B.J. Armstrong -- 
instead of one of the young studs, such as Toronto's Tracy McGrady, 
he coveted. 
</P>
<P>
	Vin Baker might have helped, and was available on the free agent  
market. Same with Penny Hardaway, Mitch Richmond, Jermaine O'Neal, 
Gary Trent, Corliss Williamson, Lorenzen Wright and Shandon 
Anderson, but Krause passed on all of them. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was a question of whether the players who were available in  
this market or in trades were going to fit into our plans down the 
line,'' Krause said. ``We felt that the players who were out there 
wouldn't. Once you spend the money, it's gone.'' 
</P>
<P>
	It was a finicky approach that was surprising in a league that  
has quickly discovered how the new collective bargaining agreement 
doesn't favor teams with salary cap space quite as much as it used 
to. 
</P>
<P>
	With its limit on high-end salaries, the labor agreement  
prevents the Bulls from simply outbidding someone else. And the 
league's youngest players, their earning ability restricted, have 
overwhelmingly been opting to take the safe route and re-sign with 
their current teams. Examples last season included Allen Iverson, 
Stephon Marbury, Shareef Abdur-Rahim, Ray Allen, Marcus Camby, 
Antoine Walker, Kerry Kittles and Kobe Bryant. 
</P>
<P>
	Krause stands poised to be a major player on the free agent  
market next summer, when Tim Duncan and Grant Hill could be 
available, and he'll have five draft picks among the top 40. 
</P>
<P>
	But the Orlando Magic also will have some $16-18 million in  
salary cap space, as well as a recruiting edge that could make all 
the difference. 
</P>
<P>
	``Now, in this league, the money is the same,'' Orlando coach  
Doc Rivers said. ``So the only reason a guy might want to leave is 
so he can play in a better city. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're a city that people want to move to. Tiger Woods, Ken  
Griffey Jr. and Shaquille O'Neal live there. There's no state 
income tax, there's great weather, great golf. Players know that if 
they come play for us, they're coming to a better place.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Players also know that if they sign in Chicago, they'll be going  
to a team with a history of acrimonious relationships with its best 
players. 
</P>
<P>
	Krause also had the overall No. 1 draft choice last June, and  
after weeks of fielding offers he decided to retain the pick and 
selected Elton Brand of Duke, a player he expects to be manning the 
power forward spot in Chicago for the next 10-12 years. 
</P>
<P>
	It was the safe choice, but it gave the Bulls only one player  
when they could have come up with two or three. 
</P>
<P>
	Again, some thought it was too conservative a strategy given  
Chicago's many needs. But Krause insists it was the right one. 
</P>
<P>
	``It took us a long while to build a championship team, and if  
we hadn't done it that way we'd have never won,'' he said at the 
NBA's league meetings. ``There's no set way to do this, and it 
won't happen overnight.'' 
</P>
<P>
	No amount of prodding can get Krause to reveal his timetable for  
making the Bulls respectable again, and a deep dip in the 
popularity of his team won't force him to make what might be the 
wrong move. 
</P>
<P>
	``I won't make predictions,'' he said. ``I'm not smart enough.  
The real rock-solid Chicago Bulls fans, the ones who were there 
pre-Michael and early-Michael, they support us in what we're 
doing.''

<HEADLINE> NHL Adds a Team, but Loses Gretzky </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	The Great One's gone, The Dominator's going and Super Mario's  
coming back. 
</P>
<P>
	The 1999-00 NHL season is full of changes, involving players,  
coaches, rules and teams. 
</P>
<P>
	Yet the league might have a hard time topping the drama of last  
season, when Wayne Gretzky retired and the Dallas Stars won the 
Stanley Cup with a foot in the crease against the Buffalo Sabres. 
</P>
<P>
	The ingredients are there for a good plot, though, starting with  
the Dominik Hasek Farewell Tour. He announced this will be his last 
season and vowed to win his final game. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's going to be my 19th season, so I feel it's enough. I just  
want to change my life,'' said Hasek, who played nine seasons in a 
Czech league before making his NHL debut at Chicago in November 
1990. 
</P>
<P>
	The All-Star goaltender and his Buffalo teammates are taking the  
season personally after losing the Cup when Brett Hull scored in 
the third overtime of Game 6 with his skate in Hasek's crease, the 
type of goal that often was disallowed. 
</P>
<P>
	The Sabres won't be the only team seeking redemption.  
</P>
<P>
	The Detroit Red Wings failed to defend their Stanley Cup title  
following two straight championships. Scotty Bowman again will try 
to win his record ninth Cup as a coach. 
</P>
<P>
	Mario Lemieux will try to win his first as an owner after  
getting two as a player. He turned around the Pittsburgh Penguins 
during the '80s, and this time kept them from leaving town, or 
leaving hockey altogether. 
</P>
<P>
	Lemieux heads a group of owners that put up $52 million to help  
keep the Penguins in Pittsburgh after the team went bankrupt last 
season. The Penguins were able to maintain their payroll and place 
in the league with a bank loan. 
</P>
<P>
	Super Mario, who led the Penguins to Stanley Cup titles in 1991  
and 1992, is the first retired player to become owner of a major 
sports team for which he played. 
</P>
<P>
	The city of Atlanta also is coming back.  
</P>
<P>
	The Thrashers fill a void created when the Flames left for  
Calgary after the 1979-80 season. They are the seventh expansion 
team to join the NHL during the '90s, increasing the league total 
to 28. Two more teams will be added next season: the Minnesota Wild 
and Columbus Blue Jackets. 
</P>
<P>
	The New York Rangers, meanwhile, were busy adding players over  
the summer in a desperate attempt to make the playoffs after two 
straight years of failure. They were the busiest team in the 
free-agent market, spending about $67 million in contracts to six 
players, including 40-goal scorer Theo Fleury. 
</P>
<P>
	Fleury isn't the only glamour player skating in a new city.  
Zigmund Palffy, a one-time 40-goal scorer with the New York 
Islanders, was traded to the Los Angeles Kings over the summer. 
</P>
<P>
	And Gretzky wasn't the only great player to retire. Dino  
Ciccarelli, one of only 10 skaters in NHL history with 600 goals, 
quit during the summer, as did veterans Dale Hunter and Bob 
Carpenter. 
</P>
<P>
	``He basically took the league and carried it on his back for 20  
years,'' Mark Messier said of Gretzky, his former teammate. 
``Obviously, the onus now goes on a lot of the younger players, to 
learn from what he did.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Those players include Pittsburgh's Jaromir Jagr, Philadelphia's  
Eric Lindros, Anaheim's Paul Kariya and Teemu Selanne, and 
Colorado's Peter Forsberg. 
</P>
<P>
	The Rangers not only went into the free agent market with a  
vengeance following Gretzky's retirement, but also signed Brian 
Leetch to a four-year contract worth about $8.75 million a year to 
make him the highest paid defenseman in the league. Nicklas 
Lidstrom was another all-star defenseman who got a big payoff, 
signing a three-year, $22 million deal with the Red Wings. 
</P>
<P>
	Elsewhere, the Stars trimmed their payroll by cutting veterans  
Pat Verbeek, Dave Reid and Craig Ludwig. 
</P>
<P>
	``Despite the fact we lost some players from last year, we have  
a lot of talent left,'' Dallas center Guy Carbonneau said. ``The 
goal is still to win the Stanley Cup. Even if we don't have the 
same kind of regular season we had, we're going to put a lot of 
pressure on ourselves to win again.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Stars will have much of the same group that finished with  
the best record in the NHL for the second straight season. Included 
are Mike Modano, Derian Hatcher and Hull, whose Cup-winning goal 
stirred controversy well into the offseason. 
</P>
<P>
	This season, however, the NHL has decided it will no longer use  
videotape replays to decide disputed goals when a player is in the 
crease. That will be decided by the on-ice officials. 
</P>
<P>
	And a goal no longer will be nullified just because a player is  
in the crease when the puck crosses the line. The modified rule 
says a player can be in the crease as long as he doesn't interfere 
with the goaltender. 
</P>
<P>
	Videotape replay will remain in use for all other existing  
circumstances, such as to determine if a puck was kicked into the 
net, crossed the goal line or a high stick was used to score a 
goal. 
</P>
<P>
	The change had nothing to do with Hull's goal, NHL commissioner  
Gary Bettman said. Officials were concerned the game would lose 
spontaneity when play is stopped for a video review of a goal. 
</P>
<P>
	While Stars coach Ken Hitchcock, among others, has expressed  
support for the new rule, others are not so sure. 
</P>
<P>
	``The tradeoff for fewer reviews and more excitement in the  
building is that some goals are going to be scored that wouldn't 
have been allowed,'' said Brian Burke, general manager of the 
Vancouver Canucks. ``And whether that's a good tradeoff or not, I 
reserve judgment.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The NHL also will go to an overtime format using only four  
skaters instead of five to open the ice and give teams a better 
chance to break ties. Under the new rule, teams will get one point 
for the tie in regulation and an extra point if they win in 
overtime. There were 220 overtime games in the NHL last season, 161 
of them ending in ties. 
</P>
<P>
	``Our fans are going to love it,'' Burke said. ``It favors the  
high-skilled teams.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The NHL's board of governors also has approved an increase in  
the number of games officiated under the two-referee system to 50 
games per team, up from 20 last season. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, six teams will have new head coaches this season --  
Kevin Lowe in Edmonton, Andy Murray in Los Angeles, Bobby Francis 
in Phoenix, Steve Ludzik in Tampa Bay, Butch Goring with the New 
York Islanders and Curt Fraser with the Thrashers.

<HEADLINE> Brewers 3, Astros 2  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MILWAUKEE (AP) -- Mark Loretta and Brian Banks drove in runs and  
Scott Karl won his third straight game Saturday night as the 
Milwaukee Brewers beat the Houston Astros 3-2. 
</P>
<P>
	With the loss, Houston's lead over second-place Cincinnati in  
the NL Central fell to 1 1/2 games. The Reds beat St. Louis 6-1 
Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
	Karl (11-11), who won for the first time in seven outings  
against the Astros, scattered 10 hits and allowed two runs in seven 
innings with two walks and two strikeouts. 
</P>
<P>
	Shane Reynolds (16-13), who won two of his last three starts  
after losing four straight, allowed three runs and eight hits in 
six innings. He walked two and struck out three. 
</P>
<P>
	Bob Wickman pitched a perfect ninth for his 36th save, tying  
Doug Jones' franchise record set in 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	An error by second baseman Craig Biggio allowed the Brewers to  
extend their lead to 3-1 in the sixth. 
</P>
<P>
	After Geoff Jenkins singled and Ron Belliard walked, Kevin  
Barker hit a fly ball to deep center. Biggio let the relay from 
center fielder Carl Everett get by him, allowing Jenkins to score 
from third, where he advanced after tagging up. 
</P>
<P>
	The Brewers broke a 1-1 tie in the fifth on an RBI single by  
Loretta, who extended his hitting streak to 10 games. Banks, who 
singled to open the inning and advanced to second on a sacrifice 
bunt by Karl, scored from second. 
</P>
<P>
	Milwaukee took a 1-0 lead in the second when Belliard, who hit a  
leadoff single, scored on a groundout by Banks. 
</P>
<P>
	Houston made it 3-2 in the seventh on a sacrifice fly to center  
by pinch-hitter Russ Johnson. He drove in Tim Bogar, who led off 
with a double. 
</P>
<P>
	The Astros tied it 1-1 in the third inning on a groundout by  
Biggio to score Bogar, who led off with a double and advanced to 
third on a groundout. 
</P>
<P>
 *Notes:* Houston's Bill Spiers, attacked by a fan during Friday  
night's game, pinch-hit in the ninth and flied out to left. He 
still has a sore neck. ... Milwaukee had inning-ending double plays 
in the first, fifth, sixth and seventh. ... Karl is the first 
Milwaukee pitcher to hit two home runs in one season. ... In its 
first 155 games heading into Saturday night's game, Houston went to 
its bullpen 324 times, lowest in the major leagues.

<HEADLINE> Clintons Said To Abandon Loan Offer </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Clinton and Hillary Rodham Clinton  
have abandoned plans to accept a friend's loan guarantee and are 
seeking a conventional mortgage for the $1.7 million home they want 
to buy in suburban New York, a source said Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
	The Clintons hope to complete a new financing arrangement by  
Nov. 1, their original closing date, said the source, who is 
familiar with the Clinton's financial planning and who spoke on 
condition of anonymity. 
</P>
<P>
	They were reported to be considering options from several  
lending institutions to enable them to purchase the five-bedroom 
home in Chappaqua, N.Y., about an hour north of New York City. Mrs. 
Clinton is considering a Senate run from New York in 2000 and must 
establish residency before election day. 
</P>
<P>
	Under the original financing plan, the Clintons agreed to use  
their own money for the $350,000 down payment. Terry McAuliffe, a 
Clinton friend and one of his chief fund raisers, put up $1.35 
million as collateral to guarantee the money the Clintons are 
borrowing. 
</P>
<P>
	The Clintons and the White House said there was nothing illegal  
or unethical with the arrangement. 
</P>
<P>
	But public interest groups and some Republican said the  
arrangement was troubling and improper because of McAuliffe's 
political ties with the Democratic party. 
</P>
<P>
	A conservative group, in a complaint filed Sept. 10 with the  
Federal Election Commission, alleged that personal loans and 
guarantees for personal loans have always been treated the same as 
campaign contributions and are subject to the same $1,000 limit. 
</P>
<P>
	An FEC spokeswoman, while not commenting on the complaint  
itself, said generally the law mandates that loans and loan 
guarantees for candidates are subject to campaign limits if they 
are related to the campaign. 
</P>
<P>
	The Conservative Campaign Fund contends that because Mrs.  
Clinton must establish residency in the state to run for a Senate 
seat the home loan was campaign related. 
</P>
<P>
	McAuliffe was quoted in Saturday's editions of The Washington  
Post as saying, ``I'm there if the president and first lady need 
me. However, at the end of the day, if the guarantee is not needed, 
I'm sure there will be plenty of people to help me figure out how 
to spend my money -- including a few Democratic politicians.''

<HEADLINE> Wake Forest 31, No. 25 N.C. St. 7 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WINSTON-SALEM, N.C. (AP) -- Morgan Kane rushed for 147 yards and  
three touchdowns and Wake Forest added to No. 25 North Carolina 
State's turnover woes with a 31-7 victory over the Wolfpack on 
Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
	The Demon Deacons (2-1, 1-1 Atlantic Coast Conference) forced  
two turnovers and converted them into 14 points. Defensive end 
Kelvin Jones led Wake Forest's defensive effort by recovering two 
fumbles, both of which produced touchdowns, and getting one of the 
Demon Deacons' three sacks. 
</P>
<P>
	Kane, who came in averaging an ACC-best 138 rushing yards,  
carried 31 times and scored on runs of 3, 1 and 6 yards as Wake 
Forest defeated the Wolfpack (3-2, 0-2) for just the second time in 
12 games. 
</P>
<P>
	The Demon Deacons, who went up 14-0 and stretched it to 24-7 at  
halftime, finished with 266 yards on 66 carries. Reserve tailback 
Kito Gary, a senior, added 30 yards on seven carries before leaving 
early in the fourth quarter with a fractured left arm. 
</P>
<P>
	What made Wake Forest's rushing success all the more impressive  
was that most of it came without right guard Sam Settar, who was 
sidelined by a sprained left knee just past the midway point of the 
first quarter. The injury meant that for the first time since 1997, 
the Wake Forest offense had to operate without Settar on the field 
-- a streak of 1,729 consecutive plays. 
</P>
<P>
	N.C. State was coming off a 31-point loss to Florida State a  
week earlier. Wolfpack quarterback Jamie Barnette had four passes 
intercepted and lost two fumbles in that game, and he had more 
problems against Wake Forest, fumbling three times and losing one. 
</P>
<P>
	Any questions about how Barnette might respond to his troubles  
against the Seminoles were answered when he fumbled on the 
Wolfpack's first two possessions against the Demon Deacons. 
</P>
<P>
	The first fumble set up a 3-yard scoring run by Kane that capped  
Wake Forest's first possession, a 53-yard drive in which the Demon 
Deacons set the tone by averaging more than 5 yards per rush. 
</P>
<P>
	Barnette's second fumble was recovered by Jones at the N.C.  
State 4. On the next play, Ben Sankey found tight end Willie Lam 
alone in the right corner of the end zone to make it 14-0 less than 
seven minutes into the game. 
</P>
<P>
	N.C. State responded with a 10-play, 80-yard drive capped by a  
19-yard scoring pass to Rahshon Spikes, but the Wolfpack got no 
closer. 
</P>
<P>
	The Demon Deacons pushed the lead to 17 at halftime and to 24  
early in the third quarter when Kane capped a 64-yard drive with a 
6-yard burst up the middle.

<HEADLINE> Super Bowl Champs Could Fall to 0-3 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	If the Denver Broncos seem panicky after their 0-2 start, wait  
until next week. 
</P>
<P>
	That's because this week, the schedule puts them in Tampa Bay  
against a defense that's the best in the NFL statistically and 
hasn't allowed a touchdown. Anyone in Denver for 0-3? 
</P>
<P>
	``If I was on another team and the two-time world champions came  
to my stadium, I'd want to embarrass them,'' Denver linebacker 
Glenn Cadrez said. ``I'd want to make a highlight tape of them. 
That should be motivation enough for us, because we're not going to 
get any breaks. No one's going to feel sorry for the Super Bowl 
champs.'' 
</P>
<P>
	There are two asterisks to the Bucs' defensive dominance.  
</P>
<P>
	One is they've played two of the league's worst offenses, the  
Giants and Eagles. 
</P>
<P>
	The other is that despite the defense, they lost to the Giants  
because Trent Dilfer threw an interception for one touchdown and 
fumbled for another. So Dilfer was called to pass only 14 times in 
last week's 19-5 win at Philadelphia. 
</P>
<P>
	Dilfer had four turnovers in the Giants' debacle and was benched  
for Eric Zeier, who was just as bad. Brian Griese demonstrated his 
inexperience in Denver's 26-10 loss in Kansas City, and Bubby 
Brister, like Zeier, was no better in relief. 
</P>
<P>
	There are other problems for the Broncos, such as the  
season-ending injury to linebacker John Mobley. Cadrez moves from 
the middle to the outside and rookie Al Wilson takes over in the 
middle, a move that would have happened sooner or later regardless. 
</P>
<P>
	This game is huge for the Bucs. Their next two games are at  
Minnesota and Green Bay, trips that will go a long way toward 
deciding their destiny this season. 
</P>
<P>
	``If we can win ugly the next 14 games, then that'll be fine,''  
coach Tony Dungy said. ``But I think this stretch will tell us what 
we're made of. We're playing one very good team at home and two 
good teams on the road.'' 
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	In other games Sunday, Atlanta is at St. Louis, Cincinnati at  
Carolina, Cleveland at Baltimore, Detroit at Kansas City, 
Philadelphia at Buffalo, Seattle at Pittsburgh, Washington at the 
New York Jets, Tennessee at Jacksonville, Indianapolis at San 
Diego, Chicago at Oakland, Minnesota at Green Bay, and the New York 
Giants at New England. 
</P>
<P>
	San Francisco is at Arizona Monday night.  
</P>
<P>
	Dallas, Miami and New Orleans are off.  
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
                  *Minnesota (1-1) at Green Bay (1-1)    	
</P>
<P>
	This is where Randy Moss first showcased his wares to the nation  
last October. Moss is one reason the Packers drafted three 
defensive backs early in last April's draft. 
</P>
<P>
	This year's Vikings have scored only 34 points in two games  
after averaging 34.8 per game last season. Want another 34? How 
about 34 yards rushing last week in a 22-17 loss to the Raiders at 
the Metrodome? 
</P>
<P>
	The Packers nearly lost to the Raiders before Brett Favre  
rallied them to victory in Week 1. Then they lost in Detroit, 
leaving themselves looking up at the Lions in what might be a 
four-team NFC Central Division race. 

</P>
<P>
                  *Detroit (2-0) at Kansas City (1-1)    	
</P>
<P>
	Some people are suggesting Barry Sanders hurt the Lions because  
he sandwiched 2- or 3-yard losses around 80-yard runs. 
</P>
<P>
	Cool that a little. Detroit's three touchdowns in the win over  
the Packers resulted from big plays: a 45-yard TD pass from Charlie 
Batch to Johnnie Morton, a 78-yard TD pass from Batch to David 
Sloan, and a 91-yard kickoff return by Terry Fair that set up the 
third score. Who's to say that Sanders couldn't have augmented 
that? 
</P>
<P>
	Kimble Anders, who ran for 142 yards in the Chiefs' win over  
Denver, is gone for the season with a torn Achilles' tendon. 

</P>
<P>
           *San Francisco (1-1) at Arizona (1-1) (Monday night)    	
</P>
<P>
	Bill Walsh will watch this game knowing the 49ers could have  
taken Jake Plummer ln the 1997 draft rather than Jim Druckenmiller. 
</P>
<P>
	If they had, the 49ers would own an alternative if Steve Young  
keeps getting battered the way he was by New Orleans last week. He 
was sacked five times, hit 15 more and came off the field looking 
more like he was 57 than 37. 
</P>
<P>
	The Cardinals still have injury problems, but played  
surprisingly well in a 3-point loss at Miami, even though Plummer 
didn't. 

</P>
<P>
                  *Cleveland (0-2) at Baltimore (0-2)    	
</P>
<P>
	Cleveland at Cleveland? The Ravens, after all, are Art Modell's  
ex-Browns. 
</P>
<P>
	It took only two games for Brian Billick to make the same  
decision about Scott Mitchell that other coaches have made, 
benching him for Stoney Case, who's getting his first real shot at 
starting in his five NFL seasons. 
</P>
<P>
	Tim Couch got his first NFL touchdown pass, a 39-yarder that  
also represented the new Browns' first TD, in a 26-10 loss at 
Nashville last week. 

</P>
<P>
                   *Atlanta (0-2) at St. Louis (1-0)    	
</P>
<P>
	Two injuries and the Falcons could be headed from Super Bowl to  
the lower middle class. That's because the injuries are to Chris 
Chandler (hamstring) and Jamal Anderson, whose torn ACL has ended 
his season. 
</P>
<P>
	In their one game, the Rams were the beneficiary of an injury --  
to Trent Green, who was supposed to be their starting QB. Kurt 
Warner, his replacement, threw for 309 yards and three touchdowns 
in the 27-10 opening-week win over the Ravens. 

</P>
<P>
                *Washington (1-1) at New York Jets (0-2)    	
</P>
<P>
	The Redskins come right back to the Meadowlands, where they  
shocked the Giants 50-21 last week. That win might have saved Norv 
Turner's job from ``win-now'' owner Dan Snyder. 
</P>
<P>
	Bill Parcells is in no danger of being fired, now or ever. But  
he's having trouble trying to put back the pieces of his offense 
now that Vinny Testaverde is gone. Rick Mirer wasn't allowed to do 
much in the 17-3 loss at Buffalo. 

</P>
<P>
               *New York Giants (1-1) at New England (2-0)    	
</P>
<P>
	With John Elway retired, Drew Bledsoe might be the NFL's best  
active escape artist (apologies to Brett Favre and Dan Marino). 
Last week, he brought the Patriots back from a 28-7 halftime 
deficit against the Colts after rallying them to an opening-day win 
over the Jets. 
</P>
<P>
	The Giants defense, which scored both TDs in a win against  
Tampa, was shocked by Washington's 50-point game. New York finally 
gets back Jason Sehorn at cornerback after missing a year and two 
games with knee and hamstring injuries. 

</P>
<P>
                *Tennessee (2-0) at Jacksonville (2-0)    	
</P>
<P>
	An early-season showdown in the AFC Central, although  
Tennessee's wins were over Cincinnati and Cleveland. Neil 
O'Donnell, filling in for Steve McNair, makes the Titans one of the 
few NFL teams with a competent and experienced backup quarterback. 
</P>
<P>
	The Jaguars weren't impressive last week, escaping 22-20 at  
Carolina after beating the 49ers 41-3. But it was a rivalry game 
between the 1995 expansion teams and reality sometimes doesn't 
count in those. 

</P>
<P>
                  *Seattle (1-1) at Pittsburgh (2-0)    	
</P>
<P>
	Pittsburgh found it's harder to overwhelm the old Browns (now  
Ravens) than the new Browns. Jon Kitna is back at quarterback for 
the Seahawks, although Glenn Foley got hot in the second half at 
Chicago last week. 
</P>
<P>
	Kordell Stewart is back in form: he ran for 51 yards in nine  
carries last week. 

</P>
<P>
                 *Indianapolis (1-1) at San Diego (1-0)    	
</P>
<P>
	Peyton Manning at Ryan Leaf?. Leaf will be holding a clipboard  
watching Jim Harbaugh play quarterback, with Erik Kramer in the 
wings. 
</P>
<P>
	The Chargers are the only unbeaten team in the AFC West after a  
bye and a 34-7 win at Cincinnati. They might be legitimate -- the 
defense is very good, Harbaugh and Kramer are a huge upgrade over 
Leaf and Craig Whelihan, and Mike Riley is providing coaching 
stability. 

</P>
<P>
 *Chicago (1-1) at Oakland (1-1)    	
</P>
<P>
	The Raiders' third straight game against the NFC Central, after  
a last-second loss at Green Bay and an upset victory at Minnesota. 
Rich Gannon has been steady and the defense good for the Raiders, 
who also seem to have straightened out Tyrone Wheatley, who 
couldn't make it with the Giants or Dolphins. 
</P>
<P>
	Shane Matthews has done reasonably well at QB for the Bears,  
with rookie Cade McNown getting a series in each game. 

</P>
<P>
                 *Philadelphia (0-2) at Buffalo (1-1)    	
</P>
<P>
	``I will continue to bring Donovan along slowly,'' Eagles coach  
Andy Reid said of Donovan McNabb, who was sacked six times last 
week in the Bucs' 19-5 win at Philadelphila. McNabb could learn 
from watching Doug Flutie, a smaller and older version or what he'd 
like to be. 

</P>
<P>
                  *Cincinnati (0-2) at Carolina (0-2)    	
</P>
<P>
	With Jeff Blake out, the Bengals will go with Akili Smith, who  
missed training camp. Not good against a team that scared 
Jacksonville.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Says Tax Bill Just Too Big </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- It seems that this year, every time  
Republicans make a move on taxes, the Clinton White House starts 
talking about vetoes. 
</P>
<P>
	It happened again Friday when the House Ways and Means Committee  
began moving a five-year, $23.3 billion measure to renew expiring 
tax credits and ensure that millions of middle-class taxpayers 
don't become liable for the alternative minimum tax. 
</P>
<P>
	The individual items in the package have strong bipartisan  
support, but Treasury Secretary Lawrence Summers told Democrats 
privately he would recommend a veto by President Clinton because 
the measure would consume part of the projected budget surplus 
before other priorities are met. 
</P>
<P>
	Today, Clinton described the package he vetoed as ``just too  
big, too bloated.'' He said in his weekly radio address that the 
GOP package would have put ``too big a burden on our economy and 
run the risk of higher interest rates and lower growth.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``At the same time, they're still not providing nearly enough  
for education and other vital priorities,'' he said. Among programs 
he said would have been endangered were expansion of Head Start, a 
tutoring reading project, provision of Interconnect connections to 
the nation's classrooms and others. 
</P>
<P>
	That infuriated House Republicans, who accused Clinton and  
Democrats of using the ``extenders'' package as a bargaining chip 
in larger spending and tax battles. The president vetoed the GOP's 
centerpiece 10-year, $792 billion tax cut Thursday but said he 
might sign a smaller package. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm terribly confused,'' said Rep. Bill Archer, R-Texas,  
chairman of the Ways and Means Committee. ``It is becoming 
painfully clear that the only specific priority for the president 
this fall is higher and higher Washington spending.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In today's Republican radio address, House Speaker Dennis  
Hastert, R-Ill., said the GOP this fall will focus on keeping 
Social Security money from being diverted into more spending, 
paying down the national debt and tax relief. 
</P>
<P>
	``Some have said that we should negotiate with the president,  
that we should have a grand compromise where Americans get minimal 
tax relief while the White House gets more Washington spending,'' 
Hastert said. ``That is a fool's choice. Getting minimal tax relief 
for a maximum increase in spending is a bad deal for the American 
people.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The top Ways and Means Democrat, Rep. Charles Rangel of New  
York, said Clinton was rightly holding the line on spending the 
budget surplus until the future solvency of Social Security and 
Medicare is ensured and the elderly gain a new prescription drug 
benefit. 
</P>
<P>
	``This bill is not paid for,'' Rangel said. ``These are very,  
very popular items, but they don't want to work it out with the 
president.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Ways and Means Committee approved the extenders package on a  
strict party-line vote after defeating a Democratic alternative 
that would have paid the costs by closing several corporate tax 
shelters. The bill next moves to the full House. 
</P>
<P>
	Originally part of the larger tax cut, the package includes a  
five-year extension of the research and development tax credit 
popular with high-tech industry and manufacturers. In addition, it 
would permanently ensure that middle-class taxpayers who claim 
credits such as the $500-per-child credit do not become entangled 
in the complex, costly alternative minimum tax, or AMT. 
</P>
<P>
	The measure also renews credits encouraging businesses to hire  
former welfare recipients and people from groups who traditionally 
have trouble keeping jobs. It extends an oil and gas provision and 
one exempting from taxes certain foreign corporate income from 
banking, insurance or financing business. 
</P>
<P>
	Most of the bill would be paid for by using projected budget  
surpluses, but its $1.5 billion cost in fiscal 2000 would be offset 
by raising taxes on high-income individuals for that year only. 
Also to save money, companies would be ``suspended'' from taking 
the research and development credit until Oct. 1, 2000. 
</P>
<P>
	The veto rhetoric aside, the sheer popularity of the extenders  
and the need to get them done quickly -- the Internal Revenue 
Service says it needs guidance by Oct. 7 to do the proper AMT forms 
-- means they will likely win final approval. 
</P>
<P>
	However, the package is one more bit leverage the White House  
can use to push through at least its Medicare reform and 
prescription drug benefit, if not a Social Security fix. 
</P>
<P>
	Toward that end, Summers and White House chief of staff John  
Podesta met Friday with Senate Finance Committee Chairman William 
Roth, R-Del., to begin exploring common ground on these issues as 
well as tax relief.

<HEADLINE> Ex-Fugitive Returns Home </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LEBANON, Ore. (AP) -- When Katherine Ann Power is released from  
prison next week, the ex-fugitive will come home with a new 
identity: her own. 
</P>
<P>
	The last time she was here, residents knew her as Alice  
Metzinger, wife, mother, chef and teacher -- not the student radical 
who drove the getaway car in a 1970 Boston bank robbery that left 
one police officer dead. 
</P>
<P>
	Her surrender to authorities in 1993 came as a shock to this  
small town, which has largely taken a forgiving attitude now that 
its most notorious resident is ready to return. 
</P>
<P>
	``She has done her penance,'' said Scott Timm, 32, owner of Blue  
Frog Books on Main Street. ``The degree to which a person will be 
welcomed back depends on the crime -- it's not like she's a child 
molester.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Power, 50, will be released Oct. 2 from a Massachusetts women's  
prison where she served less than six years of an eight- to 12-year 
sentence. She pleaded guilty to manslaughter in the fatal shooting 
of Walter Schroeder, a Boston police officer. Schroeder was trying 
to stop Power and three ex-cons who stole $26,000 from a bank to 
fund an anti-war campaign. 
</P>
<P>
	She dropped her request for parole after one of Schroeder's nine  
children, Claire, presented emotional testimony at the hearing. The 
family maintains that Power has been punished too lightly for her 
crime. 
</P>
<P>
	Out of deference for them, Power intends to keep a low profile  
after her release, said Steven Black, the attorney who helped 
negotiate Power's surrender. Black said he is withholding details 
of her return, but did say she may study philosophy at University 
of Oregon or Oregon State University. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is where her support group is,'' he said. ``I would hope  
they would receive her like anyone else who has served their time 
and paid their dues.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Lebanon, 85 miles south of Portland, is undergoing an identity  
change of its own. Once a working class town with a thriving, 
timber-based economy, it is now struggling to come to terms with 
its new image as a bedroom community. 
</P>
<P>
	Many of its residents are new arrivals who work in neighboring  
cities like Salem and Albany with bigger industry. Power herself 
commuted to Corvallis, where she worked as a chef at M's Tea and 
Coffeehouse and taught at Linn-Benton Community College, and to 
Eugene, where she co-owned Napoli Restaurant and Bakery. 
</P>
<P>
	Power's former life here has changed. The restaurant where she  
worked has closed. Her son, Jaime Lee Duncan, 20, has plans to 
marry. She has a grandchild she's never met. 
</P>
<P>
	Her husband, bookkeeper Ron Duncan, did not return phone calls  
seeking comment. 
</P>
<P>
	Power has given few interviews from prison. But in a previous  
interview with the Corvallis Gazette-Times, she said she was using 
the time to face her past. 
</P>
<P>
	While incarcerated, the former high school valedictorian  
finished her bachelor's degree at Brandeis University. She wrote 
poetry, publishing a poem for her son in Best American Poetry 1996. 
She attended group and individual therapy to deal with her lifelong 
battle with depression. 
</P>
<P>
	The fact that Power turned herself in and has shown remorse is  
something that sits well with residents of her adopted hometown, 
which has a population of about 12,850. 
</P>
<P>
	Many residents say her crime is something that needs to be put  
in perspective, taking into consideration the era in which it was 
committed, and Power's youth. 
</P>
<P>
	``Who among us doesn't have something they did in their twenties  
they wouldn't love for people to forget or forgive,'' said Susan 
Tipton, program manager at Lebanon Senior Center. 
</P>
<P>
	``It would be very easy for someone who didn't have a clear  
sense of self -- and no one in their twenties does -- to be linked 
with the wrong people's ideas of what's the right thing to do.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Even police officers said they were satisfied justice was  
served. 
</P>
<P>
	``She was a good citizen when she lived here and I expect she  
will be when she comes back,'' said Detective Sgt. John Atchley. 
``She was so quiet when she lived here that a lot of people don't 
really know who she is.''

<HEADLINE> No. 2 Penn State 45, Indiana 24 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	STATE COLLEGE, Pa. (AP) -- With clutch passing and sensational  
running, Penn State's Rashard Casey stole the show from Indiana 
phenom Antwaan Randle El. 
</P>
<P>
	Casey completed 13 of 15 passes for 196 yards and two  
touchdowns, and ran for 66 yards and a spectacular, scrambling 
touchdown as No. 2 Penn State beat Indiana 45-24 Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
	Casey dashed to his left and dodged two tacklers, reversed field  
and sprinted up the right sideline, then tiptoed the sideline and 
dove into the end zone for the 31-yard score. 
</P>
<P>
	The No. 2 man in Penn State's quarterback platoon was on the  
field for all five of the team's offensive scores as the Nittany 
Lions (5-0, 1-0 Big Ten) beat Indiana (1-3, 0-1) for the fifth 
straight time. 
</P>
<P>
	Randle El kept Indiana within striking distance with two passing  
TDs in the second half. He finished 11-of-23 for 204 yards, and ran 
for 67 yards and a touchdown. 
</P>
<P>
	Casey countered each time. He hit Eric McCoo for a 20-yard score  
in the third quarter, then found Sam Crenshaw for a 9-yard TD with 
6:18 left to put the Lions ahead 45-24. 
</P>
<P>
	Special teams helped Penn State pull away in the third quarter.  
</P>
<P>
	Bruce Branch returned a punt 90 yards for a TD, the Lions'  
longest since Mark Robinson's 92-yarder against Rutgers in 1982. 
</P>
<P>
	Askari Adams recovered a fumbled punt at the 31 to set up  
Casey's run that put the Lions ahead 31-10 with 8:00 left in the 
third quarter. 
</P>
<P>
	Adams also had Penn State's first score, intercepting Randle  
El's pass in the first quarter and returning it 37 yards. 
</P>
<P>
	Randle El twice engineered scoring drives with Penn State  
threatening to blow the Hoosiers out in the second half. He hit 
Jerry Dorsey with a 34-yard TD to cap an eight-play, 81-yard drive. 
Then he found Versie Gaddis for a 27-yard TD that pulled Indiana 
within 38-24 with 11:17 left. 
</P>
<P>
	Thompson, Penn State's starter, was 7-of-12 for 86 yards.  
</P>
<P>
	The Lions led only 17-10 at halftime despite outgaining Indiana  
232 yards to 97. 
</P>
<P>
	Casey's 30-yard pass to John Gilmore over the middle set up Penn  
State's second touchdown, a 1-yard run by Harris. They combined for 
26 yards on the next drive, but the Lions stalled at the 9 and 
settled for a 26-yard field goal from Travis Forney. 
</P>
<P>
	Stewart caught five passes for 89 yards.  
</P>
<P>
	Randle El scored from the 1 for Indiana's only first-half  
touchdown. 
</P>
<P>
	O.J. Spencer sacked Thompson at the Lions 1 on the first series  
of the game, leading to Andy Payne's 40-yard field goal.

<HEADLINE> Ore. Dust Storm Causes Fatal Pileup </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PENDLETON, Ore. (AP) -- A blinding dust storm blowing across a  
desert stretch of Interstate 84 set off three deadly collisions 
between semitrailers and cars Saturday that left six dead and 
injured at least a dozen more. 
</P>
<P>
	Dozens of vehicles were involved in the three pileups in the  
eastbound lanes, said Lt. Gregg Hastings, an Oregon State Police 
spokesman. 
</P>
<P>
	The Oregon Department of Transportation said two crashes in the  
westbound lane, each involving semitrailers and passenger vehicles, 
killed one person each. 
</P>
<P>
	At the same location in the eastbound lane, a crash involving  
five semitrailers and 11 vehicles claimed four lives. 
</P>
<P>
	Visibility was reduced to near zero, police said.  
</P>
<P>
	The accidents in the wheat and sagebrush country 175 miles east  
of Portland happened late Saturday morning. 
</P>
<P>
	The highway was closed in both directions, backing up traffic  
for miles and forcing lengthy detours through Walla Walla, Wash. 
The westbound lanes were reopened in the evening. 
</P>
<P>
	Nine people were sent to Good Shepherd Hospital in Hermiston,  
with two admitted, while another three were being treated at St. 
Mary's Hospital in Walla Walla, officials said.

<HEADLINE> Ecologists Fighting Exotic Species </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BLACKWATER NATIONAL WILDLIFE REFUGE, Md. (AP) -- Bill Geise has  
met the enemy. It's a swamp rat as big as a pit bull, and about as 
affable. A quartet of orange buckteeth jut from its pinched face 
like a mouthful of Doritos. 
</P>
<P>
	Those chisels are good for one thing: tearing out acres of  
tender salt marsh plants by the roots. 
</P>
<P>
	The nutria is native to South America but has invaded this  
tranquil, tawny fringe of Chesapeake Bay where Geise wandered as a 
boy. 
</P>
<P>
	Safe from predators a hemisphere away, flotillas of the  
web-footed rodents are defoliating one of America's richest 
preserves. One-third of the refuge's original 23,000 acres of 
whispering bull rush and cordgrass now are silent mud flats and 
sterile bays that stretch for miles into the hazy horizon. 
</P>
<P>
	The nutria is killing the place Geise loves. He aims to return  
the favor. ``To me,'' complains Geise, now the Blackwater's fire 
warden, ``nutria are no different than somebody taking a bulldozer 
to the marsh.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ecologists estimate that more than 6,000 alien plant and animal  
species like the nutria have invaded the United States with dozens 
more arriving each year. 
</P>
<P>
	A few arrived with the first European settlers 500 years ago,  
but the increase in global trade and tourism in the jet age has 
turned the trickle of previous centuries into a torrent. 
</P>
<P>
	They cross oceans and continents in the shoes and luggage of  
tourists, in shipping ballast, in packing materials, even in bald 
tires heading to recapping plants. Most are stowaways; some are 
brought in deliberately. 
</P>
<P>
	Aliens are redrawing the global landscape in ways no one  
imagined. They crowd out native plants and animals, spread disease, 
damage crops and threaten drinking water supplies. At Yellowstone 
Lake, alien sport fish introduced by fishermen munch on endangered 
cutthroat trout. In large parts of San Francisco Bay, aliens 
account for nine out of 10 species. 
</P>
<P>
	Exotic species are a parasite on the U.S. economy, sapping an  
estimated $138 billion annually according to a Cornell University 
study. That's nearly twice the annual state budget of New York, or 
a third more than Bill Gates' personal fortune. 
</P>
<P>
	Aliens have contributed to the decline of 42 percent of the  
country's endangered and threatened native species, according to 
the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service. 
</P>
<P>
	Nor is it a one-way street. The North American gray squirrel is  
wiping out native red squirrels in Europe. An Atlantic jellyfish 
contributed to the collapse of Black Sea fisheries already weakened 
by pollution. 
</P>
<P>
	Ecologists warn that, collectively, this ``biological  
pollution'' poses nearly as great an environmental threat as 
habitat losses generated by more familiar enemies of nature 
including development, clear-cut logging, overgrazing and oil 
spills. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have inaugurated a new era of ecological chaos,'' said  
Chris Bright of the Worldwatch Institute in Washington, D.C. ``When 
an exotic establishes a new beachhead, it can spread to new areas 
and adapt. This is happening all the time, virtually everywhere.'' 
</P>
<P>
	So far, like human immigration control, the battle against alien  
species has been spotty, expensive and largely ineffective. 
</P>
<P>
	Two dozen federal agencies have stitched together a crazy quilt  
of detection and eradication efforts with state and local 
authorities. But much of the effort is aimed at ports, borders and 
threats to crops. There is little leftover to combat emergencies. 
</P>
<P>
	In February, President Clinton formed a Cabinet-level task force  
to more strenuously defend against exotic species. Three 
departments -- Interior, Agriculture and Commerce -- are seeking 
$28.8 million in fiscal year 2000 for a wider battle. 
</P>
<P>
	The Agriculture Department alone spends $30 million annually on  
weed management. But Randy Westbrooks, the federal government's 
noxious-weed coordinator, has just $450,000 to counter new 
outbreaks. 
</P>
<P>
	Westbrooks' latest foe is a Brazilian native known as floating  
fern, discovered in the Toledo Bend Reservoir in east Texas. He 
complains he lacks emergency funding to eradicate the aquatic weed 
while the outbreak is small. To do the job himself would exceed his 
annual budget. 
</P>
<P>
	``It'll spread through every waterway in the South,'' Westbrooks  
predicts. ``When it starts clogging pipes and burning out 
irrigation pumps, we'll pay attention to it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Florida has already been particularly hard hit by alien species.  
Ecologists estimate that one in every four plant and animal species 
there is not native. 
</P>
<P>
	The alien species invasion -- Interior secretary Bruce Babbitt  
calls it an ``explosion in slow motion'' -- is turning even staunch 
conservationists into stone cold killers. 
</P>
<P>
	They're trapping nutria. Poisoning sport fish. Spraying weeds  
from aircraft like it was Vietnam, not North Dakota. Ripping out 
saltcedar with bulldozers and chains. 
</P>
<P>
	``Restoring the wilderness means bringing some land under  
tighter human control in the short term,'' said ecologist Greg 
Aplet of the Wilderness Society. 
</P>
<P>
	Waiting for nature to heal itself has failed miserably, many  
environmental groups acknowledge. Within a few years, people wake 
up to find unfamiliar plants and animals growing like kudzu, the 
alien plant that ate the South. 
</P>
<P>
	They're in national parks and monuments. In wildlife refuges and  
coastal marine sanctuaries. In wilderness areas that were intended 
to remain living dioramas of our American paradise lost. 
</P>
<P>
	Alien species are invading cities, too.  
</P>
<P>
	The Formosan termite, a stowaway in crates that brought  
equipment back from the Pacific during World War II, has infested 
90 percent of New Orleans' gracious French Quarter, where it is 
causing an estimated $300 million a year in damage, repairs and 
pest control. The super-termite's jaws have put the area on the 
National Trust for Historic Preservations' list of the 11 most 
endangered historical sites. It's the only site on the list because 
of a bug. 
</P>
<P>
	The Asian longhorned beetle is destroying thousands of hardwood  
trees in Chicago and New York City, threatening to turn shady 
neighborhoods into urban deserts. The treatment has been as painful 
as the invasion: chopping down infected trees. The U.S. Department 
of Agriculture says the insect could cause about $130 billion in 
damage if it breaks out of it beachheads in the two cities and 
becomes widely established. 
</P>
<P>
	In some places, researchers are turning to high-tech and  
unorthodox weapons. 
</P>
<P>
	University of Kentucky scientists fly a radar-equipped airplane  
over the Ohio River Valley to find the Asian tiger mosquito. The 
mosquitoes don't make a radar blip, but the radar can spot hidden 
mounds of scrap tires, where the insects breed. Tiger mosquitoes 
love tires. They arrived in 1985 in a Japanese container shipment 
headed for a Houston recapping plant. 
</P>
<P>
	They have spread to 25 states and followed trade routes to  
Africa and South America, too. Aggressive biters, tiger mosquitoes 
transmit 17 potentially fatal tropical viruses, including dengue 
fever, yellow fever and forms of encephalitis. One dengue epidemic 
linked to the tiger mosquito in Rio de Janeiro infected 1 million 
people. 
</P>
<P>
	Outbreaks have not been reported in the United States, but  
public officials were concerned enough to spend $2 million removing 
a swampy tire dump next to Disney World after the tiger mosquito 
was found deep within the piles. 
</P>
<P>
	In the Great Lakes and Mississippi River basins, zebra mussels  
are expected to cause $5 billion in damages to shipping and power 
plants by 2002, according to the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service. 
Biologists believe the Black Sea natives were stowaways in ballast 
water of cargo ships that was discharged into Lake St. Clair near 
Detroit in the late 1980s. 
</P>
<P>
	Damage by the thumbnail-sized mollusk represents only a fraction  
of the costs being rung up by invasive species. The total is $138 
billion annually and growing according to a study by Cornell 
University economist David Pimentel. His study, the most 
comprehensive of its kind, considered such factors as crop losses, 
depressed land values, eradication programs and medical bills 
covering everything from invasive pathogens like AIDS to emergency 
room treatments for feral dog bites. 
</P>
<P>
	As a last resort, scientists are taking the risky step of  
fighting aliens with aliens. They travel to the exotics' homelands 
to recruit natural born killers -- predators, parasites and 
pathogens -- that previously held the pests in check. 
</P>
<P>
	Unfortunately, some biological agents turn traitor and attack  
native species after being released here. 
</P>
<P>
	In Hawaii, for example, the carnivorous rosy wolf snail was  
imported to kill the giant African tree snail. Instead, it has 
pounced on 800 local mollusk species, driving more than 50 to 
extinction since the mid-1950s. 
</P>
<P>
	Such eco-disasters are prompting more rigorous testing.  
</P>
<P>
	On the Pine Butte Swamp preserve in Montana and other northern  
plains sites, managers have cautiously released a cavalry of tiny 
flea beetles in patches of leafy spurge since 1994. So far, the 
flea beetles bugs appear to be devouring only the alien weed, but 
it could take years before scientists can be sure. 
</P>
<P>
	The leafy spurge, a Eurasian herb that infests 5 million acres  
from California to Maine, is believe to have hitchhiked in sacks of 
grain seed brought from Russia in 1827 by Mennonite immigrants. 
Give an alien species two centuries to spread and, experts say, 
eradication may be impossible. 
</P>
<P>
	Some have been here longer still. Spanish conquistadors brought  
horses -- as well as smallpox and other alien diseases -- to the 
Americas 500 years ago. 
</P>
<P>
	Some pests have grown so familiar that people don't realize  
they're aliens. For example, American colonists brought the 
dandelion from Europe. 
</P>
<P>
	By those measures, leafy spurge is a newcomer. Still, states  
spend $144 million annually to fight it with little success. In 
Ashley National Forest in Utah, crews have drenched one patch with 
herbicides for 13 years. At Pine Butte, spurge is overtaking the 
last prairie wetland visited by grizzly bears. 
</P>
<P>
	Perhaps the flea beetle will crawl to the rescue since it  
co-evolved with the weed in Eurasia. Nothing else works. 
</P>
<P>
	``There are buds in the weed's roots,'' explains Keith Fletcher  
of the Nature Conservancy's Iowa chapter, who released flea beetles 
last summer at the Broken Kettle Grasslands Preserve in the Loess 
Hills near Sioux City. ``If you pull it, mow it, burn it, if you 
take a disc and cut it up into one-inch pieces, it stimulates these 
buds to make new seeds.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In the Blackwater's fetid, brackish wetlands, nutria are the  
furry equivalent of leafy spurge. 
</P>
<P>
	Swamp ranchers, who once envisioned selling their pelts as a  
middle-class mink, brought the rodents to 22 states in the 1930s 
and 1940s. In Louisiana, for example, E.A. McIlhenney of Tabasco 
sauce fame imported 13 nutria from Argentina. 
</P>
<P>
	But nutria chic was doomed by fickle fashion tastes. Set free in  
the Blackwater and elsewhere, the rodents started doing what comes 
naturally -- gorging and mating. 
</P>
<P>
	Over 16 months, a single female and her progeny can produce 150  
offspring. 
</P>
<P>
	In Louisiana, the Tabasco family's baker's dozen now number at  
least 3 million in the bayous. Maryland's population is 50,000 and 
growing rapidly. The Blackwater is the epicenter of the boom, but 
nutria now infest the entire Eastern Shore. 
</P>
<P>
	``They are furry cockroaches!'' state biologist Robert Colona  
shouts over the racket of a motorboat. He gestures with his 
cigarette at a ragged stretch of half-eaten Blackwater salt marsh 
over the bow. 
</P>
<P>
	``You might not see nutria very often, but their signs are  
everywhere -- their tracks, their droppings.'' 
</P>
<P>
	They are devastating habitat for rare native species like bald  
eagles and eliminating nurseries for the crabs and oysters that 
have paid the mortgages of tidewater families for generations. 
</P>
<P>
	Nutria scatter into the heart of a wetland, and randomly chew  
into its thick carpet of starchy roots. Biologists call those 
``eat-outs.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Aerial photos show the marsh damage blistering until the  
eat-outs merge into open bays. Then saltier water from the 
Chesapeake seeps in with the tide, strangling stands of loblolly 
pine and accelerating erosion. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a cancer,'' said refuge biologist Keith Weaver.  
</P>
<P>
	To these researchers, the only question is how best to kill  
nutria. 
</P>
<P>
	Louisiana's eradication program failed despite extensive  
trapping and poisoning campaigns; now it's motto is population 
control. One agency posts Cajun recipes on its Internet site. 
(Nutria gumbo? Pass the Tabasco.) A sheriff's SWAT team blasts the 
rodents for nocturnal target practice. 
</P>
<P>
	But the nutria are growing cagey. ``They've gotten real  
suspicious of a boat motor,'' Colona said. ``The dumb ones already 
have been weeded out.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Next year, Blackwater and state agencies will launch a $2.9  
million eradication campaign over three years. 
</P>
<P>
	Geise still relies on the paths and false channels he memorized  
as a boy to navigate the refuge. He'll guide biologists who plan to 
fit males with radio transmitters to map their wanderlust. They'll 
test traps, poisons and some unconventional biological lures -- 
vocalizations and sex hormone scents -- that put a modernist twist 
on the Pied Piper legend. 
</P>
<P>
	Their ace-in-the-hole? Cold weather. A nutria in Brazil rarely  
encounters a snowflake. 
</P>
<P>
	Geise hankers for a winter like 1978, when much of the  
Chesapeake froze solid. Out on the marsh, he would find nutria 
huddling 15 or 20 deep. 
</P>
<P>
	``Kick the piles apart, and underneath you could find a few  
still alive, trying to keep warm,'' Geise recalled. 
</P>
<P>
	Hardhearted? Geise offers no apology. The South American  
interlopers have forded a creek to infest the swamp behind his 
ancestral farm, too. 
</P>
<P>
	``I grew up on the Blackwater,'' he declares, ``and I'm watching  
it disappear. It's really sad.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Spoken like a true native.

<HEADLINE> Small Russian Banks Audited </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MOSCOW (AP) -- Russia's Tax Ministry has audited several small,  
Moscow-based banks to check whether they have taken part in 
money-laundering, and will soon start audits of larger banks, the 
tax minister reportedly told the Interfax news agency. 
</P>
<P>
	Media have reported that Russian business may have illegally  
laundered billions of dollars through the Bank of New York, the 
15th largest bank in the United States. No one has been charged and 
U.S. law enforcement agencies have refused to discuss the 
investigation. 
</P>
<P>
	The Tax Ministry launched the audits after U.S. officials failed  
to provide a list of Russian companies that should be checked, Tax 
Minister Alexander Pochinok said, according to Interfax. 
</P>
<P>
	He said that the ministry auditors had obtained bank orders for  
money transfers abroad that were worth hundreds of millions of 
dollars, and that they were now checking on whether the transfers 
were legal.

        PASADENA, Calif. (AP) -- A.J. Wood and Clint Peay scored to  
extend D.C. United's winning streak to a team-record 11 games with 
a 2-0 victory over the Los Angeles Galaxy Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
        Wood scored his eighth goal in the 17th minute and Peay in  
the 56th. 
</P>
<P>
        Wood took a pass from Jason Moore and, from 25 yards out, put  
a shot just inside the left goalpost, past goalkeeper Kevin Hartman. 
</P>
<P>
        Peay got his first goal of the season when his shot from 30  
yards deflected off the right goalpost into the net. It was his second 
goal in 43 MLS matches over four seasons. 
</P>
<P>
        United goalkeepers Tom Presthus and Mark Simpson shared the  
shutout, with Presthus making three saves in the first half and Simpson 
two in the second. 
</P>
<P>
        Hartman made three saves before a Rose Bowl crowd announced  
at 29,161. 
</P>
<P>
        Los Angeles led 16-12 in shots, with both teams taking five  
shots on goal. 
</P>
<P>
        United, which has clinched the Eastern Conference championship,  
improved to 23-7. The Galaxy fell to 18-11, as its lead over Colorado 
(19-9) for the Western Conference lead fell to one point.

<HEADLINE> Reagan Biographer Inserts Fiction </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- In the fourth year after Ronald Reagan left  
office, his authorized biographer was feeling stuck on the book he 
was supposed to write. It was then, Edmund Morris says, that he 
decided to weave fiction into his facts. 
</P>
<P>
	Reagan ``was eluding me even as he eluded everyone else,''  
Morris tells Newsweek magazine. ``When you asked him a question 
about himself, it was like dropping a stone into a well and not 
hearing a splash.'' 
</P>
<P>
	So seven years after being granted frequent access to Reagan and  
under a $3 million contract for the book with Random House, Morris 
decided to break his biographer's block by inserting himself as a 
sometimes-fictional character in the narrative. 
</P>
<P>
	Newsweek excerpts 10,000 words of the book, ``Dutch: A Memoir of  
Ronald Reagan,'' in magazines on newsstands Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	Morris said he got the idea as he walked the campus of Reagan's  
alma mater, Eureka College, in 1992. ``I thought of Reagan. If only 
I could have been there in the fall of 1928! I could describe him 
as vividly as I could describe him as president.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He said: ``My idea was to give physical form to the biographer's  
mind. It was already there. I just gave it flesh.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Morris reinvents himself and others around him a way that allows  
him to interact with Reagan and other real people in the former 
president's distant past. The Associated Press obtained an advance 
copy of the book, which goes on sale Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	Some historians and others have been critical of Morris'  
technique, in advance of seeing the book. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've never understood the patronizing neurosis among our print  
editors and our television producers that everything these days, 
whether it be a report from Chechnya or a new series on 
`Masterpiece Theatre,' has to be announced, introduced, explained, 
`made easy,' by some authoritative figure,'' Morris told Newsweek. 
</P>
<P>
	``Why can't an original approach be allowed to explain itself?''

<HEADLINE> Forbes Blasts Bush As 'Silent' </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ANAHEIM, Calif. (AP) -- Presidential candidate Steve Forbes  
lashed out at fellow Republicans, accusing congressional leaders, 
George W. Bush and two other governors Saturday of failing to stand 
up for principle on crucial issues facing them. 
</P>
<P>
	Forbes denounced Texas Gov. Bush and Gov. John Engler of  
Michigan for failing to support a ballot measure in Michigan to 
create a school voucher system. Engler has said the measure, which 
would let public money pay children's private and parochial school 
expenses, has ``no hope of passing.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Leadership means acting from principle,'' Forbes told  
reporters. ``I spoke out in favor of that referendum. Governor Bush 
has been silent.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Forbes criticized Tennessee Gov. Don Sundquist, another  
Republican, for saying he would sign a bill creating a state income 
tax if the Tennessee Legislature passes it. Tennessee and eight 
other states have no income tax. 
</P>
<P>
	``That goes against Republican principles,'' Forbes said. ``I  
spoke out against that tax increase, because I think it's what 
politics does too often -- always finds new ways to pick your 
pockets.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Governor Bush has been silent,'' he said.  
</P>
<P>
	Both Sundquist and Engler are Bush supporters.  
</P>
<P>
	Forbes also castigated Republican congressional leaders for  
``indicating they're going to leave the field'' after President 
Clinton vetoed their tax-cut proposal last week. 
</P>
<P>
	``They should show principle and gumption and verve and nerve  
and do precisely the opposite,'' Forbes said. ``They should break 
that bill up into five or six different bills so people could 
actually understand what's in the thing, such as getting rid of the 
marriage penalty.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Then Republican leaders should send the separate bills to  
Clinton, Forbes said, ``and let him veto each and every one.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``I came out in favor of that. Governor Bush has been silent,''  
Forbes said. 
</P>
<P>
	A spokeswoman for Bush's California campaign, Margita Thompson,  
said she did not know what the Texas governor's position was on the 
Michigan and Tennessee issues Forbes cited. 
</P>
<P>
	Responding to Forbes' attack, she said: ``It's fine for some  
candidates to talk about things. What Governor Bush has done is act 
on Republican principles and deliver results, such as signing the 
two largest tax cuts in Texas history.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Another Republican candidate, Elizabeth Dole, told convention  
attendees that her husband, former Sen. Bob Dole, was helping her 
raise money. Her comment appeared to be a response to a Washington 
Post story Saturday that reported her husband is aggressively 
calling his network of political supporters on her behalf. 
</P>
<P>
	``It is reciprocal,'' Dole said at a keynote dinner speech. ``I  
was out for 14 months for him in 1996, and he's doing the same for 
me.'' She campaigned for her husband in his 1996 presidential run. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Dole told reporters after her remarks that her campaign is  
healthy, despite being dwarfed by the fund-raising of front-runner 
George W. Bush. 
</P>
<P>
	``We don't feel it is struggling at all,'' Mrs. Dole said.  
</P>
<P>
	The Post suggested her husband may have broken federal election  
law by combing Bush's fund-raising list for names of potential 
donors to his wife. Mrs. Dole referred a question on that to her 
spokesman, David Manns, who said he wasn't aware of any such 
impropriety. 
</P>
<P>
	Unlike Forbes, Mrs. Dole did not mention her GOP rivals,  
reserving her criticism for the current Democratic administration. 
</P>
<P>
	``I believe the Clinton-Gore administration has truly lulled us  
into a sense that the health of our economy is somehow a barometer 
of the state of our society. I could not disagree more,'' she said, 
listing drug use, high taxes and the decline of civility and 
personal responsibility as examples. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Dole said an evacuation forced her to leave her hotel  
Saturday morning. She said hotel officials did not say why they 
cleared the facility out. 
</P>
<P>
	Mei Wang, a manager at the Hyatt Regency Alicante in Garden  
Grove, said a bomb threat forced the evacuation. Police checked the 
hotel and after about an hour guests and staff were allowed to 
re-enter the building, she said.

	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Timothy Westmoreland, a lawyer and leading  
expert on AIDS policy, has been named to run Medicaid, the national 
health insurance program for poor and disabled Americans. 
</P>

<HEADLINE> Mexicans Step Out of Rural Poverty </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CIUDAD JUAREZ, Mexico (AP) -- Eight years ago, Maria Santos  
traveled 600 miles north from the bone-dry state of Zacatecas, 
looking for ``mas modo,'' literally, some way to get by. 
</P>
<P>
	She landed among the packing-crate shacks of Colonia Anapra,  
where she lives with her eight children in a two-room hovel with no 
plumbing. 
</P>
<P>
	She no longer fears going hungry because she earns $35 a week  
trimming electrical wires on an assembly line. The plant is one of 
the hundreds of maquiladoras, or factories owned by U.S. companies 
and operated on cheap labor. 
</P>
<P>
	Santos' salary isn't enough to care for her family. ``It's  
really very little,'' she says. 
</P>
<P>
	But it's cash -- something hard to come by in rural Mexico, where  
subsistence farming is being devastated by free trade and cheap 
imported grain. ``In Zacatecas, sometimes it rained and we had 
harvests,'' Santos recalls. ``Sometimes it didn't.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Life in Anapra, on the forgotten west side of Ciudad Juarez, is  
capitalism at its most basic: few stores, no government services. 
Roving entrepreneurs hawk $6 pieces of roofing tin and 60-cent 
packages of tortillas. A water truck comes once a week, charging 
$1.50 to fill the discarded 50-gallon industrial drums most people 
here use for cisterns. 
</P>
<P>
	Only solidarity keeps such a place, known as Cartolandia --  
Cardboard City -- moderately livable. ``We look out for each 
other,'' Santos says. ``Sometimes the water runs out at the end of 
the week, and my neighbors lend me some.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Santos' day starts at 4 a.m. She gets her children ready for  
school and begins work at 6:30 a.m. 
</P>
<P>
	The 33-year-old Santos is lucky. Her husband, Jesus Lopez, works  
dirtier construction jobs that pay a bit better. Her daughter, 
Marta, helps at home. At 15, she is old enough to look after her 
siblings, ages 4 to 13. 
</P>
<P>
	Life in Anapra is tougher for other women. ``There are a lot of  
single mothers here, and there's no day care,'' says Santos' 
neighbor, Juana Picaso. Like many women here, she had to quit her 
maquiladora job last year to take care of her two youngsters. 
</P>
<P>
	Picaso misses the home she left in the impoverished central  
state of Durango, even though she says ``the soil is all worn 
out.'' Most of all, she misses relatives who kept her company and 
helped the family. 
</P>
<P>
	Now child care is a major problem. Only 10 public centers serve  
Ciudad Juarez's 1.3 million residents. 
</P>
<P>
	Shantytowns like Anapra multiply along with the number of  
migrants to border towns. So many people come to Ciudad Juarez -- 
40,000 per year, according to city spokesman Javier De Anda -- that 
the city doubles in population every two decades. So many come, in 
fact, that the mayor of Ciudad Juarez recently petitioned the 
governor of the Gulf coast state of Veracruz to discourage 
migration. 
</P>
<P>
	Certainly, there's no shortage of work. At the current rate of  
Anapra's growth, just paving the dirt paths would take another 30 
years. ``Help wanted'' signs are permanent at plants. 
</P>
<P>
	Santos stayed home one day in August to take her son Jaime to  
the doctor. While she hoped her bosses would forgive her unapproved 
absence, she wasn't terribly worried because jobs are so plentiful. 
</P>
<P>
	There are few complainers in Anapra, where the United States is  
visible through a chain-link fence. There's nobody to listen: no 
real unions, or ``none that I ever knew about,'' Picaso says. The 
union battles were lost long ago, between 1966 and 1974. 
</P>
<P>
	``The defeat of the union movements demonstrated that the  
maquiladoras were not willing to accept strong and combative 
unions,'' writes Cirilia Quintero of the Mexican Labor University 
in Mexico City. 
</P>
<P>
	Tim Beatty, director of the AFL-CIO Solidarity Center in Mexico  
City, describes how ``employers work together to keep wages down by 
keeping unions weak'' in major border cities. 
</P>
<P>
	Occasional efforts by local government to improve conditions in  
areas like Anapra have been almost comical. Representatives sent 
heavy equipment to level dirt streets, but the earthmovers piled 
dirt in a dry stream bed, blocking natural drainage and opening the 
settlement to floods. 
</P>
<P>
	Only ingenuity -- the genius of the poor -- seems effective.  
</P>
<P>
	Fences and walls rise everywhere, from everything: discarded  
campaign placards, trunk lids of old cars, plastic trays for parts 
from the maquiladoras. Barbed wire is occasionally used for 
electricity hookups. 
</P>
<P>
	And the strong-willed women of Anapra have learned to band  
together -- an accomplishment in itself, though results have been 
meager. They tried, without success, to get money to buy utility 
poles for the illegal wires. They tried, without success, to get 
running water. 
</P>
<P>
	``They called a meeting of the neighbors and asked everybody to  
contribute 600 pesos ($60) to drill a well,'' says Juana Picaso. 
``But a lot of people couldn't get that much money.'' 
</P>
<P>
	So Anapra looks to the U.S. Despite the tantalizing sight of  
prosperity in El Paso, people here aren't particularly resentful of 
the wealth that's so close yet so far. Picaso speaks fondly of Don 
Ricardo, an American railroad worker she knows through chain links. 
</P>
<P>
	``Every time he works in this section,'' she says, ``he passes  
us a few gallons of drinking water over the fence.''

<HEADLINE> UN Chief Counts World Bank Failures </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan chided world  
financial leaders Saturday for paying too little attention to jobs 
for the poor and even causing increased unemployment with some 
economic programs. 
</P>
<P>
	He recommended ``major policy changes'' that focus on increasing  
jobs, especially among the young. 
</P>
<P>
	Half the young people in poor countries -- close to 450 million --  
are ``neither at school nor at work,'' Annan said in remarks 
prepared for delivery Saturday at the annual meeting of the World 
Bank and the International Monetary Fund. Another 20 million youth 
also are unemployed in the rich countries, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	``What is needed is not just growth, but growth that creates  
jobs,'' Annan said. 
</P>
<P>
	He said financial leaders seem to have lost sight of people's  
key needs: to send their children to school, to have enough money 
to feed their families, to have a piece of land. 
</P>
<P>
	Using the language of financial experts, Annan said structural  
adjustment programs, privatization and enterprise restructuring 
have increased unemployment levels in Latin America. 
</P>
<P>
	In Asia, the continent-wide financial crisis wiped out 25  
million jobs, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Even in the best of times, he said, millions of people are  
surviving with very low pay for very long hours. 
</P>
<P>
	He cited double-digit unemployment rates in Europe, widespread  
joblessness in former Soviet republics, a decline in the demand in 
Latin America for unskilled labor, families torn apart across 
Africa by men seeking jobs far away from home, a job-seeking 
migration into the cities of South Asia and the inability of 
recovering East Asian economies to absorb newcomers to the work 
force. 
</P>
<P>
	``Yes, it is important to remove barriers to trade and financial  
flows, and to give the private sector a bigger role in the 
economy,'' Annan said, speaking of the keystones of the market 
economy. ``But these are means to an end, not an end in 
themselves.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He said world economic policies should be aimed both ``to ensure  
that everyone who wants to work has the chance to do so and to 
provide for the basic needs of all the population.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Market-based reforms have had many successes but more needs to  
be done,'' he said. ``So far they have not contributed 
significantly to the growth of employment worldwide.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He said the World Bank, IMF and other multinational lenders need  
to increase long-term capital flows into the poorest countries and 
direct public funds in all countries towards projects that create 
the most jobs. 
</P>
<P>
	Annan, a native of Ghana and the first United Nations chief born  
in Africa, said improvements in communication let many of the 
planet's poorest and least-educated glimpse through film and 
television the lifestyles of the most affluent. 
</P>
<P>
	``That makes it naive to imagine,'' he said, ``that people in  
the remotest villages or the worst urban shantytowns regard their 
own deprivation as anything but exceptional, unnecessary, and -- 
above all -- profoundly unjust.''

<HEADLINE> Taliban Jets Bomb N. Afghanistan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ISLAMABAD, Pakistan (AP) -- Fighter planes belonging to  
Afghanistan's Taliban army pounded an opposition-controlled 
northern province Saturday, killing at least 16 civilians and 
wounding 51 others, an opposition spokesman said. 
</P>
<P>
	The Taliban jets attacked Taloqan, the capital of northern  
Takhar province, and its nearby villages several times Saturday, 
Mohammed Abil said in a satellite telephone interview. 
</P>
<P>
	At least 12 civilian were killed and 45 others wounded in  
Taloqan, 155 miles north of the capital Kabul, he said. Four 
civilians were killed and six were injured when a bomb hit a nearby 
village, he added. 
</P>
<P>
	There was no immediate comment from the Taliban.  
</P>
<P>
	The Taliban planes also targeted opposition positions near the  
front-line at Bangi, 18 miles west of Taloqan. But no casualties 
have been reported so far, Abil said. 
</P>
<P>
	Afghanistan's opposition says scores of civilians have died in  
air strikes by the Taliban in recent weeks. 
</P>
<P>
	``People have started fleeing to villages from the city to  
escape the air strikes,'' Abil said. ``Our hospitals are full of 
civilians, who have been wounded in these attacks.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, the Taliban attacked the district of Dasht-e-Archi in  
Takhar province from neighboring Kunduz province, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	The Taliban, or the students of Islam, rule 90 percent of  
Afghanistan, including Kabul and are battling their northern-based 
opposition in a bid to extend control over the entire country. 
</P>
<P>
	They are Sunni Muslims and mostly Pashtuns -- Afghanistan's  
majority ethnic group. The opposition, which controls the remaining 
10 percent of Afghanistan, comprises ethnic and religious 
minorities.

<HEADLINE> Packers Put Chmura on Injured List </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	GREEN BAY, Wis. (AP) -- The Green Bay Packers placed Pro Bowl  
tight end Mark Chmura, one of Brett Favre's favorite targets, on 
injured reserve, meaning he will miss the rest of the season. 
</P>
<P>
	Chmura, who has been selected to the Pro Bowl three times and  
ranks fourth in team history among tight ends with 188 receptions, 
was deactivated because of ``some recurrent symptoms from his neck 
injury,'' general manager Ron Wolf said Saturday in a news release. 
</P>
<P>
	Chmura has been plagued by a bulging disc, and he had numbness  
in his hands and arms last Sunday for the third time in six weeks. 
A hit by Detroit rookie linebacker Chris Claiborne gave Chmura a 
concussion and a stinger in the first quarter of the Lions' 23-15 
win. 
</P>
<P>
	In August it was reported that Chmura's wife and agent urged him  
to retire after two training camp incidents of numbness and partial 
paralysis. At the time Chmura said: ``Believe me, if the doctors 
said I should retire, then I would. But everything I hear is great, 
so I'm continuing.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Chmura has been undergoing tests, and the team said Thursday  
that the tight end would undergo two additional weeks of tests 
before he makes a decision on his future. 
</P>
<P>
	Linebacker Jude Waddy was activated to replace Chmura for  
Sunday's game against the Minnesota Vikings. Waddy has just 
completed a four-game suspension, begun at the end of the 1998 
season, for violation of the NFL's steroids policy. 
</P>
<P>
	Chmura had five catches for 55 yards in the first two games.  
</P>
<P>
	Before Chmura's injuries, the Packers had depth at tight end.  
With the blocking skills of Chmura, the pass receiving ability of 
Tyrone Davis and the toughness of Jeff Thomason, Green Bay had 
perhaps the best three-man combination in the league. 
</P>
<P>
	Now Davis and Thomason will be sharing time and will often be on  
the field together in some of offensive coordinator Sherman Lewis' 
sets. 
</P>
<P>
	Green Bay signed Lamont Hall as a third tight end after waiving  
him earlier in the season. 
</P>
<P>
	Chmura is the third receiver Favre has lost this season. Robert  
Brooks retired shortly after training camp began, citing a history 
of back and knee problems, while Derrick Mayes was traded to 
Seattle for a draft pick.

<HEADLINE> Clinton, GOP Spar Over Tax Bill </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- In the aftermath of President Clinton's veto  
of the GOP tax-cut package, the president and the House's top 
Republican found little common ground Saturday as they took the tax 
fight to the airwaves. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton wants negotiations on tax cuts less than the $792  
billion he vetoed Thursday and on money for debt reduction and 
programs the GOP wants eliminated. Speaker Dennis Hastert calls 
that ``a fool's choice'' that defies ``plain Midwestern common 
sense.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Common sense and the federal government are not often used in  
the same sentence, but we are working hard to bring some 
old-fashioned common sense to the way government works,'' Hastert, 
R-Ill., said in the GOP's weekly radio message. 
</P>
<P>
	He said the vetoed bill would have ``put fairness back in the  
tax code.'' It would have helped two-income married couples, people 
who have a death in the family or care for aging parents, and 
parents who want to save for their children's education. 
</P>
<P>
	``These are common-sense changes in a tax code that often defies  
common sense,'' Hastert said. ``Mr. President, I think you made a 
mistake by vetoing this tax fairness package.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In his radio address, Clinton said he rejected the tax plan  
because ``it was just too big, too bloated. It would place too big 
a burden on our economy and run the risk of higher interest rates 
and lower growth.'' 
</P>
<P>
	At the same time, he said, ``It would have created an untenable  
choice for the Congress: these irresponsible cuts on the one hand, 
or on the other diverting ever more funds from the Social Security 
surplus and from debt reduction.'' 
</P>
<P>
	New battle lines already are being drawn.  
</P>
<P>
	On Friday, the House Ways and Means Committee began moving a  
five-year, $23.3 billion bill to renew expiring tax credits and 
ensure that millions of middle-class taxpayers do not become liable 
for the alternative minimum tax. 
</P>
<P>
	The bill has enthusiastic backing from both parties' members.  
But Treasury Secretary Lawrence Summers privately told Democratic 
leaders he would urge the president to veto it in its current form 
because the tax breaks are not paid for. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton and Hastert each promoted his approach to saving Social  
Security, the financially endangered national retirement program 
facing the huge baby-boom generation's imminent retirement. 
</P>
<P>
	``It is plain common sense to put the trust back in the Social  
Security trust fund,'' Hastert said. ``Paying off your debts also 
makes sense to people in the heartland of America. We propose to 
pay down $2.2 trillion public debt accrued by the federal 
government ... We in the common-sense Congress have chosen this 
path, but we need the president's cooperation'' by accepting 
reduced government spending. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton said ``the congressional majority continues on a track  
that doesn't adequately fund America's real priorities, while 
already spending large amounts of the Social Security surplus.'' 
</P>
<P>
	While using ``budget gimmicks'' to spend Social Security money  
clandestinely, the president said, ``they're still not providing 
nearly enough for education and other vital priorities.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``The Republicans should work with us to create a budget that  
pays for itself with straightforward proposals,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Hastert countered: ``Some have said that we should negotiate  
with the president, that we should have a grand compromise where 
American families get minimal tax relief while the White House gets 
more Washington spending. That is a fool's choice,'' Hastert said.

<HEADLINE> No. 4 Mich. 21, No. 20 Wisc. 16 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MADISON, Wis. (AP) -- Ron Dayne's Heisman Trophy hopes are buried  
somewhere under a big pile of Michigan defenders. 
</P>
<P>
	Tom Brady threw two touchdown passes and the No. 4 Wolverines'  
hard-nosed defense held Dayne to zero rushing yards in the second 
half as Michigan beat 20th-ranked Wisconsin 21-16 Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
	Michigan (4-0) won its 18th consecutive Big Ten Conference  
opener with another tenacious performance against a running team. A 
week after holding Syracuse to 59 rushing yards, Dayne managed zero 
net yards on eight carries in the second half and twice failed to 
get critical first downs for the Badgers. 
</P>
<P>
	Dayne, who did nothing to quiet doubters who say he disappears  
in big games, finished with 88 rushing yards on 22 attempts. He 
didn't carry the ball in the last 10 minutes of the game as the 
Badgers tried to catch up. 
</P>
<P>
	He needs 1,105 yards in Wisconsin's seven remaining games to  
beat Ricky Williams' Division I-A rushing record. 
</P>
<P>
	Wisconsin coach Barry Alvarez, his right knee awaiting  
replacement surgery, coached the game from the press box. 
</P>
<P>
	The loss snapped an eight-game winning streak for the Badgers at  
Camp Randall Stadium. Wisconsin's last home loss also came to the 
Wolverines, who have beaten the Badgers three straight times. 
</P>
<P>
	The Wolverines weren't much more impressive than the Badgers on  
offense, but Brady directed two scoring drives and Michigan scored 
on a double-reverse while leaning on its imposing defense. 
</P>
<P>
	An exuberant crowd at Camp Randall Stadium became increasingly  
quiet as the Badgers' offensive struggles continued in the second 
half. 
</P>
<P>
	Michigan made a 10-play, 91-yard drive late in the third quarter  
that ended when DiAllo Johnson beat double coverage to snare 
Brady's 23-yard touchdown pass in the end zone with 1:02 left, 
giving Michigan a 21-9 lead. 
</P>
<P>
	David Terrell had seven catches for 88 yards, and he also scored  
on the 45-yard double-reverse in the first quarter. Marquise Walker 
had five catches for 49 yards, while Brady was 17-of-27 for 217 
yards and Drew Henson was 5-of-8. 
</P>
<P>
	Backup quarterback Brooks Bollinger led Wisconsin on a 10-play,  
80-yard in the closing minutes of the game and scored on a 13-yard 
bootleg with 1:29 left, but Michigan tailback Anthony Thomas 
recovered the onside kick, and the Wolverines ran out the clock. 
</P>
<P>
	Wisconsin (2-2) lost its second straight game and wasted a  
strong defensive performance with inept offensive play. Dayne's 
linemen weren't much better than their star back, and quarterbacks 
Scott Kavanagh and Bollinger couldn't get the Badgers moving. 
</P>
<P>
	On fourth-and-1 from the Wolverines' 25 with 11:32 to play,  
Bollinger pitched to Dayne on the option, but he was swarmed by 
three Wolverines for a 2-yard loss. Dayne had just 53 yards on 16 
carries in Michigan's 27-10 win over Wisconsin last season, the 
Badgers' only loss of 1998. 
</P>
<P>
	Wendell Bryant sacked Brady twice to kill Michigan's first two  
drives of the second half, but Kavanagh threw an interception. 
Wisconsin linebacker Chris Ghidorzi knocked Brady out of the game 
on a savage sack with 10:56 left, but a holding penalty on the 
ensuing punt stranded Wisconsin at its own 25, and the Badgers were 
forced to punt again. 
</P>
<P>
	Dayne looked much better when he scored on a 34-yard run with  
3:27 left in the second quarter. In typical Dayne fashion, he took 
two hits at the line of scrimmage before righting himself and 
running the rest of the way untouched. 
</P>
<P>
	Wisconsin mistakes aided the Wolverines throughout the game. A  
personal foul on Badgers defensive lineman John Favret kept 
Michigan's opening drive alive, and the Wolverines went in for a 
score. 
</P>
<P>
	Brady, who was 7-of-7 on the drive, hit fullback Aaron Shea with  
an 8-yard touchdown pass less than eight minutes into the game. 
</P>
<P>
	The Wolverines went up 14-0 on a graceful double-reverse shortly  
before the end of the first quarter. Terrell ran 45 yards for the 
score with great blocks from Shea and Anthony Thomas. 
</P>
<P>
	Wisconsin got its first points on a 32-yard field goal by Vitaly  
Pisetsky early in the second quarter, but the kick came one play 
after Chris Chambers, blinded by the afternoon sun, dropped a 
potential touchdown pass in the end zone with no defenders within 
20 yards. 
</P>
<P>
	Chambers, who missed Wisconsin's last two games with a broken  
hand, had nine catches for 93 yards.

<HEADLINE> Diamondbacks 11, Giants 3 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SAN FRANCISCO (AP) -- A year after losing 97 games in their debut  
season, the Arizona Diamondbacks are headed to the playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
	Randy Johnson, the biggest acquisition in an offseason spending  
spree that turned the expansion Diamondbacks into NL West 
champions, got the biggest win in Arizona baseball history Friday 
night. 
</P>
<P>
	Johnson pitched a five-hitter, struck out 11 and added an RBI  
single as the Diamondbacks clinched the division title with an 11-3 
victory over the San Francisco Giants. 
</P>
<P>
	Johnson was surrounded by teammates at the front of the mound  
after finishing off his major league-leading 12th complete game of 
the season. He then led his team into the clubhouse for a series of 
champagne showers. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's been a great honor to pitch in a game like this, but  
everyone contributed,'' Johnson said. ``The work has just begun. 
Now we've taken the first step to where this team wants to go.'' 
</P>
<P>
	As the Diamondbacks celebrated, fireworks went off in the  
stadium -- part of a promotion scheduled by the Giants long before 
they realized they could be playing host to a clinching party by 
Arizona. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's tough to watch,'' Giants manager Dusty Baker said of the  
Diamondbacks' celebration. ``You wish it was you. We remember when 
it was us.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Diamondbacks doubled their payroll in the offseason by  
signing several key free agents, including Johnson and center 
fielder Steve Finley -- who went to the World Series last season as 
a member of the San Diego Padres. 
</P>
<P>
	``Last year, I got to do this three times,'' Finley said of the  
celebration in the Arizona clubhouse. ``My goal this year is 
four.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Arizona became the first expansion club to win a division title  
in less than eight years. The Florida Marlins, who won a World 
Series championship in their fifth year, were a wild-card team in 
that 1997 season. 
</P>
<P>
	``To think that we could even compete for this thing in two  
years in this division is something you don't expect,'' 
Diamondbacks manager Buck Showalter said. 
</P>
<P>
	Johnson (16-9) allowed three unearned runs, all in the first  
inning, but retired 14 straight batters after that. He increased 
his major league-best strikeout total to 353. 
</P>
<P>
	The 353 strikeouts moved Johnson past Bob Feller (348 for  
Cleveland in 1946) and Rube Waddell (349 for the Philadelphia A's 
in 1904) and into fourth place on the list for strikeouts in a 
season. Only Nolan Ryan and Sandy Koufax have struck out more 
batters in a year. 
</P>
<P>
	Johnson has 22 double-digit strikeout games this year, tying the  
NL record set by Koufax in 1965. 
</P>
<P>
	The Diamondbacks scored four in the first off Shawn Estes  
(11-10) on an RBI single by Jay Bell, an RBI double by Bernard 
Gilkey, a sacrifice fly by Finley and an error by Giants left 
fielder Barry Bonds. 
</P>
<P>
	The Giants responded in their half of the first with a three-run  
homer by Ellis Burks, his 30th. The runs were unearned because of 
an error by third baseman Matt Williams. 
</P>
<P>
	But Johnson then took command, and the Diamondbacks added two  
runs in the third on an error by third baseman Bill Mueller and 
Johnson's sixth RBI of the year. 
</P>
<P>
	Kelly Stinnett and Tony Womack hit solo homers in the fifth to  
make it 8-3. In the eighth, pinch-hitter Erubiel Durazo had an RBI 
single and Gilkey added a sacrifice fly. 
</P>
<P>
	The Diamondbacks debuted last year by losing 31 of their first  
39 games, and spent the entire season in last place in the NL West. 
They went on a spending spree in the offseason, increasing the club 
payroll from $32 million to $65.9 million. 
</P>
<P>
	The most expensive of their free-agent acquisitions was Johnson,  
who got $52.4 million for four years. But even Johnson didn't 
expect such success so soon. 
</P>
<P>
	``I didn't know we were going to win this quickly, but the hard  
work doesn't stop here,'' he said. ``There's still a lot of good 
teams we have to go through.'' 
</P>
<P>
 *Notes:* Johnson matched his career high with his 34th start of the  
season. ... Johnson has allowed two earned runs or fewer in 17 of 
his last 18 starts. ... Johnson also doubled in the seventh. ... 
The Diamondbacks have won 26 of their last 32 road games. ... The 
Giants had a five-game home winning streak snapped. ... Estes 
allowed eight runs and 10 hits in five innings. ... Giants catcher 
Scott Servais left the game after the sixth inning with a cut toe 
on his left foot. He was injured on a play at the plate.

<P>
	BETHESDA, Md. (AP) -- President Clinton, who has remained in  
generally good health throughout his two terms, flew by helicopter 
today to the National Navy Medical Center for a complete physical 
examination. 
</P>
<P>
	It is his first physical since 1997 and his fifth since entering  
the White House. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton has been bothered by a hoarse and raspy voice since  
returning from a trip to New Zealand last week but there has been 
no word of any other pressing medical complaint. 
</P>
<P>
	During his last physical, in October 1997, the president was  
fitted with an in-the-ear hearing aid to deal with a longtime 
hearing problem. Also, doctors removed a benign cyst from his 
chest. 
</P>
<P>
	Over the years Clinton also has had a cyst removed from his neck  
and a precancerous skin lesion removed from his nose. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1997 the president's doctors also pronounced Clinton fully  
recovered from an injury to his knee that spring. He used crutches 
for months after tearing a tendon when he stumbled on steps at the 
Florida home of golf pro Greg Norman.

<HEADLINE> Encephalitis Confirmed in Manhattan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- A strain of encephalitis never before seen in  
the Western Hemisphere has been found in dead birds here, raising 
the possibility that the new strain, and not St. Louis 
encephalitis, has killed three residents and afflicted 15 more. 
</P>
<P>
	The newly discovered strain of encephalitis is called the West  
Nile, and is typically found in Africa and England. It has never 
before been documented in the United States, said the U.S. Centers 
for Disease Control and Prevention. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is an interesting development from the perspective of  
people who study viruses, but it's really not an interesting 
development from the perspective of public health,'' said Barbara 
Reynolds, a CDC spokeswoman. ``There's no reason to cause any alarm 
here.'' 
</P>
<P>
	All the encephalitis cases confirmed in humans are believed to  
have resulted from the St. Louis strain, Reynolds said. She said 
researchers were re-testing to look for the new strain. 
</P>
<P>
	Two more victims of encephalitis, believed to be the St. Louis  
strain, were reported Friday. That brings to 14 the number of city 
residents affected since August. 
</P>
<P>
	Among the cases Friday was a 90-year-old woman who lives near  
Central Park -- the first confirmed case in Manhattan. She was in 
critical condition, Mayor Rudolph Giuliani said. 
</P>
<P>
	Pesticide spraying that was undertaken to combat the mosquito  
that carries the St. Louis virus should also work against two 
additional species that carry the West Nile virus, health officials 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Spraying continued Friday night in the city and in Westchester  
County, where four other cases of the St. Louis virus have been 
confirmed. 
</P>
<P>
	Westchester County Health Commissioner Harold Adel described the  
West Nile encephalitis as a ``variant'' so similar to St. Louis 
that it is sometimes called ``Old World St. Louis encephalitis.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The viral infection is transmitted by mosquitoes. Symptoms  
include fever, headaches, stiff neck, disorientation and tremors.

	Russia Told To Attack Corruption  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The United States and its wealthy allies told  
Russian authorities today there was a ``critical need'' for that 
country to attack corruption and money laundering. Meanwhile, 
financial leaders from the world's seven largest industrial 
countries saw encouraging signs that the global economy was 
beginning to stabilize after nearly two years of severe financial 
turmoil. In an 11-page joint statement, they cautioned, however, 
that ``a number of challenges remain'' including a widening trade 
deficit in the United States.

	Over 40,000 Rally Against Milosevic  
</P>
<P>
	BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) -- In the biggest rally turnout of  
late, at least 40,000 people marched today through downtown 
Belgrade and several thousand more protested in other cities to 
press for President Slobodan Milosevic's resignation. The 
opposition group Alliance for Democratic Change has been holding 
daily rallies recently. A Belgrade march yesterday attracted nearly 
30,000 people, but attendance has generally been much lower than 
organizers had hoped. Uniformed police kept a low profile.

	Clinton, GOP Spar Over Tax Bill  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- In the aftermath of President Clinton's veto  
of the GOP tax-cut package, the president and the House's top 
Republican found little common ground today as they took the tax 
fight to the airwaves. Clinton wants negotiations on tax cuts less 
than the $792 billion he vetoed Thursday and on money for debt 
reduction and programs the GOP wants eliminated. Speaker Dennis 
Hastert calls that ``a fool's choice'' that defies ``plain 
Midwestern common sense.''

	Peacekeepers Ignore E.Timor Looting  
</P>
<P>
	DILI, East Timor (AP) -- Hundreds of East Timorese looted the  
capital Saturday, after spending weeks hiding in the hills from 
rampaging pro-Indonesia militias. They had returned to find their 
homes razed and were searching for materials to build makeshift 
shelters. Meanwhile, the United Nations admitted that the 
humanitarian crisis in East Timor is much worse than expected.

	Taiwan Probes Contractors in Quake Aftermath  
</P>
<P>
	TAIPEI, Taiwan (AP) -- Taiwanese authorities have reportedly  
arrested several building contractors as they probe the 
construction irregularities that outraged Taiwan following 
Tuesday's 7.6-magnitude earthquake. Sixteen more have been 
prevented from leaving the island. American rescuers said today the 
wrecked buildings here were even more shoddily constructed than 
those they encountered in last month's killer earthquake in Turkey. 
Some 2,000 people died in the Taiwan quake.

	McCain Criticizes Bush On Buchanan

<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Republican presidential hopeful Sen. John  
McCain accused George W. Bush, the party's front-runner, of 
``sacrificing our principles'' by refusing to condemn Pat 
Buchanan's views on Adolf Hitler and Nazi Germany. In an interview 
yesterday with The Associated Press, Bush said he does not want 
Buchanan to leave the GOP and seek the Reform Party nomination for 
president.

	Yemen President Wins Re-Election  
</P>
<P>
	SAN`A, Yemen (AP) -- Yemeni President Ali Abdullah Saleh was  
re-elected president as expected today, garnering the vast majority 
of the votes in an election that was boycotted by opposition 
groups. Saleh won 96.3 percent of the vote, while his opponent 
Najeeb Qahtan al-Shaabi, got 3.7 percent, an electoral official 
said. Authorities said the elections --Yemen's first direct 
presidential polls -- were a success. But critics said they were an 
expensive farce put on to give an illusion of democracy.

	IMF Says Ecuador Could Get Aid  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Ecuador could obtain substantial financing  
from the International Monetary Fund if the country moves to 
resolve its financial problems and seeks the support of its 
creditors, a senior IMF official said today. But there appear to be 
disagreements between Ecuador's president, Jamil Mahuad, and his 
economy minister over what course to follow, an aide to Mahaud 
said. In Quito, Ecuador's capital, Mahuad said today no decision 
has been made on whether the country will default on $96 million in 
bond payments due this week.

	Packers Put Chmura on Injured List  
</P>
<P>
	GREEN BAY, Wis. (AP) -- The Green Bay Packers today placed Pro  
Bowl tight end Mark Chmura, one of Brett Favre's favorite targets, 
on injured reserve, meaning he will miss the rest of the season. 
Chmura, who ranks fourth in team history among tight ends with 188 
receptions, was deactivated because of recurrent neck injury 
symptoms, general manager Ron Wolf said in a news release. 
Linebacker Jude Waddy will replace Chmura for tomorrow's game 
against the Minnesota Vikings.

<HEADLINE> NHL Skates Past Language Barrier </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SUNRISE, Fla. (AP) -- When Pavel Bure broke into the NHL in 1991,  
he spoke no English but was fluent in hockey. 
</P>
<P>
	``The coach told me where to go and what to do on the  
chalkboard,'' Bure said. ``It was simple.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Russian Rocket scored 34 goals, became the league's rookie  
of the year and showed that the best way to get past the language 
barrier is to skate around it. 
</P>
<P>
	Today more players than ever must do just that. Bure's success  
helped to accelerate the influx of foreigners, and as a result, the 
NHL now has a greater mix of languages than any other professional 
league. 
</P>
<P>
	There's Czech, Finnish, French, German, Russian, Swedish and  
even English. The ice rink has become a melting pot, raising the 
quality of play but complicating communication. 
</P>
<P>
	``When you're with a team that has guys who speak seven  
different languages, you usually communicate in two ways,'' 
Vancouver Canucks coach Marc Crawford said. ``First, you start in 
English. And second, you end in profanities.'' 
</P>
<P>
	NHL now stands for Numerous Hockey Languages, and several teams  
have introduced rules requiring their players to speak only English 
on the ice, on the bench and in the locker room. The Florida 
Panthers, whose training camp roster included 12 Europeans, adopted 
the rule for this season. 
</P>
<P>
	``What happened here sometimes is if three Czech players are  
sitting together and talking Czech between periods, other guys 
don't understand what they're talking about,'' general manager 
Bryan Murray said. ``We're asking our guys to be a team, and to 
respect that if you're going to be a team, you have to have a 
common way to communicate. If you're calling for a pass, you'd 
better do it in a way the guy understands.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Panthers players, including Europeans, express unanimous support  
for the rule. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't think there's going to be any controversy,'' said  
Bure, the Panthers' star forward. 
</P>
<P>
	Florida forward Peter Worrell, a French Canadian, said: ``It was  
weird sometimes last season. You'd look in the dressing room and 
have guys speaking Russian in one corner and Czech in another, and 
me and somebody else speaking another language.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``When you can't understand what a person is saying, some guys  
might be worried when they make a bad play and people are 
talking,'' Worrell added. ``They get a little paranoid about it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Tampa Bay Lightning and Washington Capitals also adopted an  
English-only policy this season. Lightning coach Steve Ludzik, the 
son of Polish immigrants, said the rule will make his job easier. 
</P>
<P>
	``We've got 22 artists, and they're all painting on the same  
canvas,'' Ludzik said. ``It's a team thing. I'm doing it because 
when I describe a play in the last minute, I don't want someone 
sitting there going, `Yah, yah, yah, I do understand,' when he 
means, `No, no, no, I don't.' '' 
</P>
<P>
	Lightning defenseman Petr Svoboda, a Czech, said Europeans will  
learn English faster if they're forced to speak it. 
</P>
<P>
	``When I started 16 years ago, there weren't that many  
Europeans,'' he said. ``It was actually easier for me, because I 
had no other choice than to speak English on a daily basis. I think 
that's the way to go.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Capitals' roster includes five nationalities, and yet the  
players instituted the English-only rule themselves in an attempt 
to improve unity. Their kangaroo court fines violators up to $100. 
</P>
<P>
	But some hockey officials say such a rule means a more difficult  
adjustment for young immigrants who don't speak English well. 
</P>
<P>
	``If someone's going to help (a player) by speaking Chinese or  
whatever it is, then that's better than a poor kid sitting there 
not knowing what's going on,'' Toronto Maple Leafs coach Pat Quinn 
told the Toronto Sun. 
</P>
<P>
	Hall of Famer Denis Potvin, another French Canadian, said the  
unspoken policy in the NHL always has been English first. But his 
preferred method of communication is body language. 
</P>
<P>
	``I could play with a guy and look at his eyes and see his  
movement and tell where he was going,'' the former Islanders 
defenseman said. ``It was never an issue of, `OK, pass me the puck 
NOW!' '' 
</P>
<P>
	Proving Potvin's point is Ottawa Senators left wing Petr  
Schastlivy, a shy 20-year-old Russian. He scored five points in his 
first five preseason games without knowing any English. 
</P>
<P>
	Young European players generally speak better English than a  
decade ago, NHL veterans say. Virtually all Finnish and Swedish 
players speak English well because of their education systems, and 
the typical Russian, Czech and Slovakian has developed a better 
grasp of English since the Cold War ended. 
</P>
<P>
	But hockey's language barrier can still be daunting.  
</P>
<P>
	Tampa Bay defenseman Pavel Kubina, a Czech, spoke no English  
when he began his North American career in a junior league in 
remote Moose Jaw in Canada. Three years later, he can describe the 
experience in concise English: ``Worst year in my life,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	``It happens to everyone who comes here from Europe,'' said  
Buffalo Sabres goaltender Dominik Hasek, a Czech who now speaks 
three languages. ``It takes at least a year. My wife and I hired a 
teacher; I had tapes in my car. 
</P>
<P>
	``The best thing is for a player to come over here single and  
find an American girlfriend. That way you learn very fast.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In any language, that advice makes sense.

<HEADLINE> Egyptians To Give Mubarak 4th Term </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CAIRO, Egypt (AP) -- Portraits of Egypt's president dress up  
dingy government buildings and crowded Cairo streets. Messages of 
support for Hosni Mubarak fill the Saturday newspapers. Over the 
Nile, a tow-plane pulls a banner urging ``Yes to Mubarak with 
Loyalty.'' 
</P>
<P>
	With no other candidates in Sunday's yes-or-no referendum,  
enough Egyptians are expected to say ``yes'' to Mubarak to easily 
grant the 71-year-old president his fourth, six-year term. 
</P>
<P>
	``Who am I going to vote for?'' Hussein Mohammed, a 42-year-old  
shoeshine man, asked rhetorically. ``Is there anyone else?'' 
</P>
<P>
	Of Egypt's 64 million people, 24 million are eligible to vote.  
</P>
<P>
	Although past referendums have been peaceful, security around  
the country has been beefed up. More policemen than usual are 
patrolling major streets in the capital. Security chiefs in Egypt's 
26 provinces held meetings Saturday about measures to guard against 
referendum-day trouble. Their plans were not released. 
</P>
<P>
	In the past three referendums, Mubarak has been approved by more  
than 95 percent of the electorate. 
</P>
<P>
	Mubarak's economic reforms -- an ambitious privatization program  
begun in 1991 -- seem to be pleasing some Egyptians, who say their 
support for the president goes beyond a lack of options. 
</P>
<P>
	``I will vote for the president, of course, and the reason is  
economic -- because of all the development that has happened in the 
country since he took office,'' said Taha Ibrahim, the 32-year-old 
owner of a flower shop. 
</P>
<P>
	International observers have hailed the reforms, which have made  
Egypt an important emerging market. The reforms have transformed a 
state-controlled economy to a largely free-market system. 
</P>
<P>
	``There isn't anyone better than him, and we have no one other  
than him,'' said Aziza Mohammed, 65, while selling newspapers in 
Cairo's Tahrir Square. ``He will do good things for the new 
generation and will develop the country.''

<HEADLINE> No. 12 Ohio St. 34, Cincinnati 20 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	COLUMBUS, Ohio (AP) -- Ken-Yon Rambo caught two long bombs from  
Steve Bellisari -- one for a 59-yard touchdown and another to set up 
a score -- as 12th-ranked Ohio State overcame yet another rocky 
start to hold off Cincinnati 34-20 Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
	In the first meeting of the teams in 68 years, the Bearcats  
(2-2) played as if last week's 17-12 upset of then-No. 9 Wisconsin 
-- the school's first victory ever over a ranked opponent -- was no 
fluke. 
</P>
<P>
	The Bearcats built a 17-3 second-quarter lead that muzzled a  
crowd of 93,407 at Ohio Stadium. Even though Ohio State (3-1) took 
command by scoring 31 straight points, Cincinnati still finished 
with the upper hand in first downs (26-19) and yards (525-496) and 
had an 11 1/2-minute advantage in time of possession. 
</P>
<P>
	Rambo, who had 181 receiving yards in last week's  
come-from-behind 40-16 victory over Ohio University, totaled three 
catches for 164 yards. 
</P>
<P>
	Ohio State continued to have problems in the opening half. In  
their last two games -- both at home -- the Buckeyes trailed 10-0 to 
UCLA and 10-3 to Ohio. 
</P>
<P>
	The Buckeyes' 34-17 lead midway through the fourth quarter  
wasn't even that secure. Cincinnati added a field goal and had a 
touchdown pass called back that would have cut the lead to seven 
points with 2:49 remaining. 
</P>
<P>
	The Bearcats' Deontey Kenner completed 39-of-55 passes for 343  
yards with two interceptions and added 64 yards on eight rushes. 
Robert Cooper added 100 yards on 22 carries before leaving the game 
with a sprained knee. Jason Collins-Baker had 11 catches for 87 
yards and LaDaris Vann had five receptions for 106 yards. 
</P>
<P>
	Vann's 75-yard TD reception from Kenner, and Kenner's 35-yard  
run up the middle on a quarterback draw put Cincinnati ahead 17-3. 
The Bearcats then intercepted a pass off backup quarterback Austin 
Moherman on Ohio State's next possession and drove to a first down 
at the Buckeyes 17 before things started to turn around. 
</P>
<P>
	Two Cooper runs and an incompletion forced the Bearcats to  
settle for a field goal attempt, but Jon Ruffin's 33-yard attempt 
sailed wide right. 
</P>
<P>
	Four plays later, Bellisari froze the defense with a play-action  
fake and threw deep for Rambo for the 59-yard touchdown that cut 
the lead to 17-10. 
</P>
<P>
	Late in the second quarter, Ohio State took over at its 31 after  
a punt. 
</P>
<P>
	Bellisari kept for 11 yards around right end. Bellisari avoided  
an onrushing defender and lobbed a long pass that Rambo pulled down 
between defenders Jeff Burrow and Tinker Keck for a 55-yard gain. 
Michael Wiley then pounded the right side and reached the ball over 
the goal line for the tying score with less than a minute left in 
the half. 
</P>
<P>
	Derek Combs, spelling Wiley, came in to set up his own 5-yard  
touchdown run with a 39-yard gain on a draw play early in the third 
quarter. Bellisari added an insurance score with an 11-yard run. 
</P>
<P>
	Bellisari was just 8-of-22 for 197 yards, and four of his passes  
went through the hands of defenders. 
</P>
<P>
	The victory was coach John Cooper's 100th at Ohio State. He is  
100-33-4 in 12 seasons.

<HEADLINE> Lost Probe Won't Alter NASA Plans </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PASADENA, Calif. (AP) -- The celebratory Mars candy bars lay  
uneaten on a desktop, not far from the computers that would have 
monitored the heartbeat of NASA's latest Martian probe -- if it had 
survived. 
</P>
<P>
	Sam Thurman, flight operations director for the lost Mars  
Climate Orbiter, fought back tears in a control room decorated with 
pictures of the probe and a globe of its target. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's tough to find the words,'' he said. ``I guess  
`devastated' would be one. And `embarrassed.' These are publicly 
funded missions and everybody on the team is keenly aware that a 
spacecraft paid for by the taxpayers has been lost.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But Thursday's disappearance of the $125 million Mars Climate  
Orbiter, while a sting to its scientists, isn't likely to change 
the agency's direction or delay future missions, NASA Administrator 
Daniel Goldin said. 
</P>
<P>
	Orbiter -- built in about four years on what for space  
exploration was a shoestring budget -- was a poster probe for NASA's 
policy of faster, better and cheaper solar system missions. The 
Mars Observer probe that vanished in 1993 cost nearly $1 billion, 
eight times as much as this week's loss. 
</P>
<P>
	``When we went forward with faster, better and cheaper, we said  
we were going to push the boundaries and be prepared for failure -- 
maybe one or two failures out of 10,'' Goldin said. ``And that's 
about where we are.'' 
</P>
<P>
	NASA has launched more than 20 missions over the last five years  
and lost three -- including the Mars Climate Orbiter. 
</P>
<P>
	Agency officials believe the probe burned up in the red planet's  
atmosphere as it reached its orbit Thursday. They suspect a 
software glitch or human error brought the probe too close to the 
planet, and investigators are trying to figure out how to prevent 
it from happening again. 
</P>
<P>
	Another probe, the Mars Polar Lander, is scheduled to reach Mars  
Dec. 3. 
</P>
<P>
	``When there are so many missions being launched, there are  
going to be some failures,'' said Carl Pilcher, NASA's science 
director for solar system exploration. ``It's probably an 
inevitable part of pushing the envelope.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But some question whether the long hours, tight deadlines and  
slim budgets mandated by the agency contribute to mistakes and 
failures. 
</P>
<P>
	``Whether in addition to cutting costs they're cutting corners,  
that's the obvious question at this point,'' said John Pike, 
director of space policy at the Federation of American Scientists. 
</P>
<P>
	Before Orbiter disappeared, NASA was considering some changes in  
its program, including creating a team to think up potential 
problems. On Friday, Goldin said employee workload probably should 
be reviewed as well. 
</P>
<P>
	``These people are working unbelievably intense and hard,'' he  
said. ``We ought to take a look and see if maybe people are working 
a little too hard.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Space exploration is a challenging business, and the number of  
probes lost under NASA's new policy is comparable to those lost in 
previous years, Goldin said. 
</P>
<P>
	During the 1970s and 1980s, NASA launched a few behemoth probes  
that cost billions of dollars to develop, launch and operate. The 
Viking Mars missions cost $2 billion and employed about 500 people. 
</P>
<P>
	When the Mars Observer probe vanished in 1993, it wiped out Mars  
exploration for years because it was carrying all NASA's scientific 
eggs in one basket. 
</P>
<P>
	Now, there are more probes. ``When we lose one, it won't be a  
catastrophe,'' said Bruce Murray, a California Institute of 
Technology planetary scientist and former director of NASA's Jet 
Propulsion Laboratory. ``There is enough going on so that the 
overall program remains robust.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The climate monitoring instruments lost with the Mars Climate  
Orbiter could be resent with future missions, launched every 26 
months when the planet's positions are favorable. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's not an all-or-nothing program anymore,'' Goldin said.  
``It's not the last ship out of port. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a question of how fast we're going to recover from this,  
not will we recover.''

<HEADLINE> Firms Vie for Baghdad Oil Contracts </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) -- More than 50 international firms lobbied  
furiously on Saturday for contracts to revamp Iraq's ailing oil 
industry. 
</P>
<P>
	The firms hope to sell Iraq spare parts under its U.N.-approved  
oil program, which allows Iraq to spend $900 million to 
rehabilitate its production and export facilities. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are so happy to see so many firms are interested to supply  
Iraq with its needs despite these circumstances,'' Taha Hmoud, oil 
ministry undersecretary, told reporters as he opened an oil and gas 
technology exhibition, the first in Baghdad in 10 years. 
</P>
<P>
	The U.N. program is an exemption from sanctions imposed on Iraq  
for invading Kuwait in 1990. Baghdad has said the sanctions have 
hindered its oil program by holding up contracts for spare parts 
and equipment. 
</P>
<P>
	Most of the firms participating in the exhibition came from  
Britain, France, Italy and Canada. U.S. businesses stayed away 
because ``of the pressure by the American administration on these 
companies,'' Hmoud said. He said Iraq was prepared to buy from the 
United States if American companies wanted to sell. 
</P>
<P>
	At the fair, executives argued prices and specifications with  
Iraqi officials and handed out glossy brochures. 
</P>
<P>
	The oil deal was first initiated in December 1996 and is meant  
to serve the country's humanitarian needs. 
</P>
<P>
	Iraq currently exports an average of 2.2 million barrels a day  
and Hmoud said his ministry was determined to boost that output.

<HEADLINE>  Clinton Said To Be In Good Health </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BETHESDA, Md. (AP) -- President Clinton has gained 18 pounds  
since his last complete physical examination but is in ``excellent 
health,'' a team of doctors reported Saturday. They said swollen 
vocal cords were causing his recent hoarseness and recommended he 
rest his voice. 
</P>
<P>
	The 53-year-old president, who has enjoyed generally good health  
since entering the White House in 1993, weighs 214 pounds, still 
within the normal range of up to 220 pounds for a 6-foot-2-inch 
man, said Clinton's physician, Dr. Connie Mariano. 
</P>
<P>
	``He would feel best and most fit if he could drop about 10  
pounds,'' White House press secretary Joe Lockhart told reporters 
outside the Bethesda Naval Medical Center. 
</P>
<P>
	Doctors recommended a low-calorie diet and more exercise, which  
Lockhart said Clinton's staff will try to help Clinton maintain. 
</P>
<P>
	Two small skin abnormalities were removed from Clinton's  
forehead in what doctors described as a routine precautionary 
treatment. Such skin conditions, typically caused by sun exposure, 
sometimes can become cancerous. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton's battery of tests took about five hours, and included  
checkups by 14 specialists, including a cardiologist, dermatologist 
and urologist. It was his fifth complete physical examination as 
president. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton has been bothered by a hoarse and raspy voice since  
returning from a trip to New Zealand in mid-September. His voice 
broke twice during a speech Tuesday to the United Nation's General 
Assembly, but seemed to improve a bit after a day with no public 
speaking engagements on Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	By Friday night, Clinton again was noticeably hoarse. He  
repeatedly cleared his throat during two evening political 
speeches. 
</P>
<P>
	The doctors diagnosed the swollen vocal cords caused in part by  
``voice overuse.'' The recommendation: Clinton rest his voice over 
the next 10 days, and no yelling at the television during sporting 
events. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton kept up on the Ryder Cup golf tournament during the  
testing regimen, Lockhart said. There was no word on the calorie 
count of the lunch the doctors shared with Clinton afterward -- 
chicken enchiladas with mango sorbet for dessert. 
</P>
<P>
	During his last physical, in October 1997, the president was  
fitted with in-the-ear hearing aids. They helped with a longtime 
problem that Clinton said made it difficult to understand voices in 
crowded receptions or sometimes even to catch what hecklers were 
shouting at him. 
</P>
<P>
	The 1997 medical team also removed a benign cyst from the  
president's chest and pronounced him fully recovered from an injury 
to his knee that hospitalized him for a few days early in the year. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton used crutches for months after tearing a tendon when he  
stumbled on steps at the Florida home of golf pro Greg Norman. 
</P>
<P>
	Over the years Clinton also has had an additional cyst removed  
from his neck and a precancerous skin lesion removed from his nose. 
Doctors described all of those conditions as common for a man his 
age. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton also has taken prescription medicine to inhibit severe  
heartburn known as acid reflux disease. He also has a number of 
allergies, including sensitivity to household dust and grass and 
weed pollen.

<HEADLINE> Caskets Taken by Floods Retrieved </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TARBORO, N.C. (AP) -- Seven caskets unearthed by floodwaters from  
Hurricane Floyd were moved to a makeshift morgue Saturday after the 
recovery team held a brief prayer service. 
</P>
<P>
	Retrieving the coffins touched not only the volunteers but those  
who deal with death every day. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've been to many funerals in my life, and this was a very  
emotional time for all of us,'' said Draughon Cranford, a funeral 
director from Mebane. 
</P>
<P>
	It was the first task of the Disaster Mortuary Operational  
Response Team, a group of about 50 morticians, archeologists, DNA 
experts and others from across the country who started arriving in 
Edgecombe County on Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	As the mortuary team now begins identifying the caskets,  
officials still must retrieve at least 70 more that were pushed to 
the surface after Tar River flooding kept cemeteries under water 
for days. 
</P>
<P>
	All coffins found so far were sealed, and the situation posed no  
health risk, said Buddy Bell, a mortuary liaison officer for the 
U.S. Public Health Service. 
</P>
<P>
	It was unclear how long identification would take.

<HEADLINE> Woman Subpoenaed in Gingrich Case </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ATLANTA (AP) -- Divorce lawyers for Newt Gingrich's wife have  
subpoenaed cards, e-mail, phone records and other documents from a 
woman who has been romantically linked to the former House speaker. 
</P>
<P>
	Callista Bisek, a staff member of the House Agriculture  
Committee, is scheduled to give a videotaped deposition Wednesday 
in the Gingriches' divorce case. 
</P>
<P>
	Gingrich filed for divorce July 29 from Marianne Gingrich. The  
couple married 18 years ago. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Gingrich's lawyers are trying to establish whether Gingrich  
gave Ms. Bisek funds or spent the couple's money on her. Earlier 
this month, the Gingriches reached an agreement on how to 
temporarily split their assets until the divorce is final. 
</P>
<P>
	The subpoena requests documents and other items dating to  
January 1995, when Gingrich was installed as House Speaker. Those 
include: cards, letters, e-mail and other correspondence between 
Ms. Bisek and Gingrich; gifts; Ms. Bisek's home and cellular phone 
records; records of loans, payments or gifts from Gingrich; 
photographs showing the two together; and any audio or video 
recordings of the two. 
</P>
<P>
	The subpoena also requests any clothes or other personal items  
belonging to Gingrich that Ms. Bisek has in her possession. 
</P>
<P>
	Neither attorney in the case was available for comment Friday,  
The Atlanta Journal-Constitution reported in today's editions.

<HEADLINE> Golden Gate Ad Bid Stirs Debate </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SAN FRANCISCO (AP) -- An Internet company has stirred debate by  
proposing to pay all tolls on the Golden Gate Bridge for one day a 
month in exchange for a large advertising banner strung across the 
span's toll plaza. 
</P>
<P>
	Supporters suggest the plan by carOrder.com would be a boon for  
commuters who fork out the $3 toll. Critics say it would desecrate 
an icon. 
</P>
<P>
	``I understand the economic need. But does everything have a  
price now? And what's next? Half Dome?'' asked San Francisco 
Supervisor Michael Yaki, referring to the Yosemite National Park 
peak. 
</P>
<P>
	Bridge directors initially voted down the proposal, but ordered  
staff members to study the plan and come up with possible 
guidelines by next month.

<HEADLINE> Chavez Wins Vosburgh Handicap </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Artax, racing on or near the lead throughout,  
won the Vosburgh Handicap by 3 1/2 lengths Saturday, the fourth 
straight year Jorge Chavez rode the winner in the $250,000, Grade I 
race. 
</P>
<P>
	Stormin Fever finished second, a head in front of Mountain Top,  
in the field of six horses 3 years old and up. 
</P>
<P>
	Chavez's previous Vosburgh winners were Langfuhr in 1996, Victor  
Cooley and Affirmed Success last year. 
</P>
<P>
	It was the second win in 13 starts this year for Artax whose  
only previous victory came when he established a track record for 
seven furlongs in the Grade I Carter Handicap at Aqueduct on May 2. 
</P>
<P>
	Artax, a 4-year-old colt by Marquetry, went seven furlongs in  
1:21:3 while carrying 126 pounds as did all starters. 
</P>
<P>
	The winner earned $150,000 for Paraneck stable and returned  
$10.60, $6.40 and $7.10. Stormin Fever paid $4.50 and $8.10, while 
Mountain Top was $7.20 to show. 
</P>
<P>
	With the Flow held desperately to a diminishing lead over the  
final yards for a half-length victory in the co-featured $212,700, 
Grade II Belmont Breeders' Cup Handicap for horses 3 and older. 
</P>
<P>
	Comic Strip came from far back with a furious rally that fell  
just short to be runner-up in the nine-horse field. It was another 
length to Wised Up. 
</P>
<P>
	It was the first stakes victory for With the Flow since taking  
the Grade III Prix de Fontainbleau at Longchamp, in France on April 
20, 1998. It was also the third time in the last seven runnings of 
the Belmont Breeder's Cup that Jose Santos rode the winner. He was 
aboard Fourstars Allstar in 1993 and repeated on Gentleman Beau in 
1996. 
</P>
<P>
	With the Flow carried 114 pounds over 1 1/8 miles in 1:49.39 on the  
firm inner turf course and earned $127,620 for Derry Meeting Farm. 
It was the second win in four starts this year for the 
Pennsylvania-bred 4-year-old colt by Irish River. 
</P>
<P>
	With the Flow returned $36, $11.40 and $7.10. Comic Strip paid  
$4.20 and $3.20, while Wised Up was $15.20 to show. 
</P>
<P>
	In the Schenectady Handicap, John Valentino's Common Objective  
remained undefeated in four career starts with a 2 1/4-length victory. 
The 3-year-old filly by Missionary Ridge-Special Date went six 
furlongs in 1:09:3 to earn the $34,350 winner's share of the 
$57,250 purse and returned $5.20 to win.

<HEADLINE> UN Tests Y2K Emergency Power Supply </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	GENEVA (AP) -- Anxious to avoid any disruption Jan. 1, the U.N.  
European headquarters tested its standby electricity supplies 
Saturday to check systems for the millennium bug. 
</P>
<P>
	A U.N. circular ordered all staff to switch off computers for  
the entire day to prevent damage from surges during the power 
checks. 
</P>
<P>
	``In the context of eventual disruptions due to a possible year  
2000 bug, one of the possible scenarios might be a general 
breakdown in electricity in Geneva while an important conference 
was in progress at the United Nations,'' said the circular. 
</P>
<P>
	There are no conferences currently scheduled for Jan. 1, but  
Geneva often hosts important diplomatic negotiations called at 
short notice. 
</P>
<P>
	Emergency generators were used to supply lighting and other  
services to key assembly rooms, but much of the sprawling U.N. 
complex was in darkness. Given the weekend, there were no 
conferences in progress.

<HEADLINE> Martin Sheen Plays the President </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BURBANK, Calif. (AP) -- The Oval Office never looked like this:  
furniture of all kinds crammed into the room, filling every bit of 
space on the huge oval rug -- like an upscale garage sale. 
</P>
<P>
	``We had to stack the furniture in here while we were building  
another White House office next door,'' explained John Wells. He is 
co-producer of NBC's new series, ``The West Wing,'' which offers 
drama, romance, comedy and yes, some statesmanship from 9-10 p.m. 
EDT on Wednesday nights. 
</P>
<P>
	The Oval Office and its anterooms, hallways, reception areas and  
the vice president's office occupy two full sound stages at Warner 
Bros. studio. 
</P>
<P>
	``The dimensions of the Oval Office are not exact, but they're  
very close,'' Wells commented. ``It was originally built for the 
feature film 'The American President,' which our series creator and 
co-producer, Aaron Sorkin, also wrote.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A caravan of makeup trailers surround both stages to accommodate  
``The West Wing's'' ensemble cast, including veteran Hollywood 
activist Martin Sheen as the president; John Spencer, chief of 
staff; Allison Janney, press secretary; Richard Schiff, 
communications director, and Rob Lowe as his assistant. 
</P>
<P>
	Standing near Sheen's trailer is a man in a suit with a tiny  
receiver in his ear. No, it's not the controversial actor's 
personal security -- just a bit-player waiting for his next walk-on 
as a Secret Service agent. 
</P>
<P>
	Sheen, looking unpresidential in baggy casual clothes, told how  
he became involved in the series: 
</P>
<P>
	``When you make a deal for a series pilot, you have to sign for  
the whole first year. My deal was to appear once a month; that was 
appealing to me. I had done miniseries, but never a series. 
</P>
<P>
	``We started, and I had a lot of fun and was very impressed with  
the pilot. Then John and Aaron called and said, 'Would you 
reconsider the contract? We're thinking the president should be 
more involved. All we're seeing is the administration reflected in 
the staff.''' Sheen acquiesced. 
</P>
<P>
	Sheen is no stranger to the presidency. He played John F.  
Kennedy in the 1983 miniseries ``Kennedy.'' He has also appeared as 
such power figures as Robert F. Kennedy (``The Missiles of 
October,'' 1974) and chief of staff to Michael Douglas in ``The 
American President.'' 
</P>
<P>
	As proof that ``The West Wing'' is fiction -- if not fantasy --  
Sheen's character, Josiah Bartlet, is not only president, he's a 
Nobel Prize winner in economics. 
</P>
<P>
	``The series came up so fast that we don't know much about him  
yet,'' Sheen said. ``We talk about the first lady and the children, 
but we haven't cast them yet. 
</P>
<P>
	``We do know that he's a Democrat, he's very conservative on  
economics and the military, but on domestic policy, he's very 
liberal. He's Catholic, long married to the same woman, he's a 
grandfather -- and they'll be no fooling around,'' Sheen insisted. 
</P>
<P>
	``He was governor of New Hampshire, the second president from  
New Hampshire, following Franklin Pierce (1853-57). I researched 
it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Unlike Martin Sheen, Josiah Bartlet is not a pacifist. In an  
early episode, Bartlet wants a massive retaliation for a terrorist 
attack in the Middle East. Sheen admitted that the script made him 
``very uncomfortable.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He added that the series is planning to tackle such hot-button  
issues as gun control, abortion and gay rights. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's not going to be a smooth ride,'' he admitted. ``I think  
we're going to draw a lot of heat. That's fine.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Sheen has drawn plenty of heat during his pacifistic crusades.  
Just last month he was among 75 protesters police led away in 
plastic handcuffs during a demonstration at the Los Alamos National 
Laboratory in New Mexico on the 54th anniversary of the bombing of 
Nagasaki. 
</P>
<P>
	The actor, marking his 59th birthday, told reporters it was his  
59th arrest at a protest location. Before signing his series 
contract, he insisted on furloughs for the Los Alamos protest, plus 
another on Nov. 21 at Fort Benning, Ga., where the School of the 
Americas trains Latin American soldiers. 
</P>
<P>
	Despite all the politicking, on- and off-screen, producer Wells  
insists that the goal of ``West Wing'' goal is not to defend anyone 
or attack anyone. The show isn't about political views or issues. 
The show is about people who work in the White House.''

<HEADLINE> Forbes Blasts Bush As 'Silent' </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ANAHEIM, Calif. (AP) -- Presidential candidate Steve Forbes  
lashed out at fellow Republicans, accusing congressional leaders, 
George W. Bush and two other governors Saturday of failing to stand 
up for principle on crucial issues facing them. 
</P>
<P>
	Forbes denounced Texas Gov. Bush and Gov. John Engler of  
Michigan for failing to support a ballot measure in Michigan to 
create a school voucher system. Engler has said the measure, which 
would let public money pay children's private and parochial school 
expenses, has ``no hope of passing.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Leadership means acting from principle,'' Forbes told  
reporters. ``I spoke out in favor of that referendum. Governor Bush 
has been silent.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Forbes criticized Tennessee Gov. Don Sundquist, another  
Republican, for saying he would sign a bill creating a state income 
tax if the Tennessee Legislature passes it. Tennessee and eight 
other states have no income tax. 
</P>
<P>
	``That goes against Republican principles,'' Forbes said. ``I  
spoke out against that tax increase, because I think it's what 
politics does too often -- always finds new ways to pick your 
pockets.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Governor Bush has been silent,'' he said.  
</P>
<P>
	Both Sundquist and Engler are Bush supporters.  
</P>
<P>
	Forbes also castigated Republican congressional leaders for  
``indicating they're going to leave the field'' after President 
Clinton vetoed their tax-cut proposal last week. 
</P>
<P>
	``They should show principle and gumption and verve and nerve  
and do precisely the opposite,'' Forbes said. ``They should break 
that bill up into five or six different bills so people could 
actually understand what's in the thing, such as getting rid of the 
marriage penalty.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Then Republican leaders should send the separate bills to  
Clinton, Forbes said, ``and let him veto each and every one.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``I came out in favor of that. Governor Bush has been silent,''  
Forbes said. 
</P>
<P>
	A spokeswoman for Bush's California campaign, Margita Thompson,  
said she did not know what the Texas governor's position was on the 
Michigan and Tennessee issues Forbes cited. 
</P>
<P>
	Responding to Forbes' attack, she said: ``It's fine for some  
candidates to talk about things. What Governor Bush has done is act 
on Republican principles and deliver results, such as signing the 
two largest tax cuts in Texas history.''

<HEADLINE> Packers Put Chmura on Injured List </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	GREEN BAY, Wis. (AP) -- The Green Bay Packers placed Pro Bowl  
tight end Mark Chmura, one of Brett Favre's favorite targets, on 
injured reserve, meaning he will miss the rest of the season. 
</P>
<P>
	Chmura, who has been selected to the Pro Bowl three times and  
ranks fourth in team history among tight ends with 188 receptions, 
was deactivated because of ``some recurrent symptoms from his neck 
injury,'' general manager Ron Wolf said Saturday in a news release. 
</P>
<P>
	Chmura has been plagued by a bulging disc, and he had numbness  
in his hands and arms last Sunday for the third time in six weeks. 
A hit by Detroit rookie linebacker Chris Claiborne gave Chmura a 
concussion and a stinger in the first quarter of the Lions' 23-15 
win. 
</P>
<P>
	In August it was reported that Chmura's wife and agent urged him  
to retire after two training camp incidents of numbness and partial 
paralysis. At the time Chmura said: ``Believe me, if the doctors 
said I should retire, then I would. But everything I hear is great, 
so I'm continuing.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Chmura has been undergoing tests, and the team said Thursday  
that the tight end would undergo two additional weeks of tests 
before he makes a decision on his future. 
</P>
<P>
	Linebacker Jude Waddy was activated to replace Chmura for  
Sunday's game against the Minnesota Vikings. Waddy has just 
completed a four-game suspension, begun at the end of the 1998 
season, for violation of the NFL's steroids policy. 
</P>
<P>
	Chmura had five catches for 55 yards in the first two games.  
</P>
<P>
	Before Chmura's injuries, the Packers had depth at tight end.  
With the blocking skills of Chmura, the pass receiving ability of 
Tyrone Davis and the toughness of Jeff Thomason, Green Bay had 
perhaps the best three-man combination in the league. 
</P>
<P>
	Now Davis and Thomason will be sharing time and will often be on  
the field together in some of offensive coordinator Sherman Lewis' 
sets. 
</P>
<P>
	Green Bay signed Lamont Hall as a third tight end after waiving  
him earlier in the season. 
</P>
<P>
	Chmura is the third receiver Favre has lost this season. Robert  
Brooks retired shortly after training camp began, citing a history 
of back and knee problems, while Derrick Mayes was traded to 
Seattle for a draft pick.

<HEADLINE> Lawmaker's Taping Case Will Proceed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Appeals judges ruled Friday that a  
congressman-versus-congressman lawsuit can go to trial. 
</P>
<P>
	A three-judge panel of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the  
District of Columbia reversed a lower court's decision quashing the 
suit filed by Rep. John Boehner, R-Ohio, against Rep. Jim 
McDermott, D-Wash. 
</P>
<P>
	In a case that grew out of House leadership intrigue, an ethics  
case and a pirated cellular phone conversation, the judges said 
McDermott had a duty to refrain from disclosing contents of a 
secretly recorded phone call -- a duty that stemmed ``from every 
citizen's responsibility to obey the law.'' 
</P>
<P>
	One of the judges added a harsh description of McDermott's  
actions in light of his position as senior Democrat on the House 
ethics committee at the time. 
</P>
<P>
	McDermott was given, and was accused of leaking, a tape of a  
cell phone call in which then-Speaker Newt Gingrich and other 
members of the House leadership discussed strategy involving 
announcement of an ethics committee finding against Gingrich. 
Because of committee's decision, Gingrich was reprimanded by the 
House and paid a $300,000 penalty for ethics lapses. 
</P>
<P>
	Despite McDermott's committee position, Judge Eric Sentelle  
wrote, he ``willfully dealt with felons and knowingly received 
unlawfully obtained evidence on the chance that he might be able to 
use something contained therein to embarrass one of the colleagues 
whose ethics he was charged with policing.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Gingrich's strategizing conference call took place while Boehner  
was on a 1996 vacation in Florida. Since it was the transmission to 
Boehner's cell phone that was intercepted, Boehner is the one 
suing. 
</P>
<P>
	The Ohio congressman issued a statement Friday expressing  
gratification that ``the court agreed to uphold the 
constitutionality of our laws that protect U.S. citizens from 
invasions of their privacy.'' 
</P>
<P>
	McDermott spokesman David Schaefer described that lawmaker as  
surprised and disappointed at losing the appeal. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's discussing with his attorney what his options are, what  
to do next,'' Schaefer said. 
</P>
<P>
	McDermott raised First Amendment free-speech questions in  
fighting the appeal, and that inspired several news media companies 
to file briefs in the case. 
</P>
<P>
	Lawyer Theodore J. Boutrous Jr., who represented media in the  
case, said he believed majority and dissenting opinions together 
``will create great confusion and cry out for clarification from 
(the full appeals court) or from the Supreme Court.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In the suit, Boehner alleged that McDermott broke the law by  
leaking the contents of the illegally intercepted conversation. 
</P>
<P>
	Boehner, in seeking to reverse dismissal of his case, argued in  
his appeal that grounds exist to overturn the lower court and to 
punish McDermott for violating federal wiretap laws. 
</P>
<P>
	A Florida couple using a scanner heard the Boehner call, taped  
it and gave the tape to McDermott. Soon afterward, newspapers wrote 
about the contents of the tape, and Boehner accused McDermott of 
leaking it. 
</P>
<P>
	The Florida couple pleaded guilty to using a radio scanner to  
intentionally intercept the call and were fined $500 each.

<HEADLINE> NBA To Be Less Physical </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	VANCOUVER, British Columbia (AP) -- No more grabbing a player's  
jersey as he tries to come around a screen. No more hip-bumping, 
forearm-checking or excessive banging. 
</P>
<P>
	The NBA will not be as physical in the upcoming season, and the  
players will just have to adapt. That was the word that went out to 
the league's referees Friday as the NBA told them to wield their 
whistles aggressively in an effort to open up the flow of the game 
and crack down on the off-the-ball contact that has contributed to 
the slowing down of offenses. 
</P>
<P>
	``When you talk about physical play, we're not talking about the  
problem of flagrant fouls anymore. We solved that,'' NBA vice 
president of operations Rod Thorn said. ``But the problem of 
grabbing and holding and the impeding of progress is where the game 
has gotten much more physical over the past 5-6 years than it ever 
was.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Four official rules changes are being adopted for the 1999-00  
season, but the crackdown on overly physical play is not among 
them. The league will simply instruct its referees to keep a 
vigilant eye out for clutching, grabbing and banging away from the 
ball, or players being hindered running around screens. 
</P>
<P>
	``Rules that were always on the books we are now going to  
enforce,'' Thorn said. 
</P>
<P>
	Of course, what constitutes a foul in one ref's mind might not  
in another's, and Thorn acknowledged there will be a gray area 
regarding exactly how much contact will be allowed away from the 
ball. But he said the league office will work with referees in an 
effort to develop a consistent standard. 
</P>
<P>
	``We expect all our refs to know what to call and what not to  
call. We don't want a lot of ticky-tack fouls called,'' Thorn said. 
</P>
<P>
	``Pressing out with the forearm, or using a hip, knee or leg to  
impede a player running through a screen -- that'll all be called,'' 
supervisor of officials Ed Rush said. 
</P>
<P>
	The meeting between the referees and the league's competition  
committee was one of several held among NBA personnel on a full day 
of activity in the league meetings, which are held every two years. 
</P>
<P>
	The day began with a general session, including a speech by  
commissioner David Stern, attended by team employees. The league's 
29 general managers will meet this morning, and a league-wide 
dinner will be held in the evening. 
</P>
<P>
	With trade talk at a relative lull -- although Scottie Pippen and  
Glen Rice rumors refused to die -- much of the focus was on the 
rules changes, be they official or unofficial. 
</P>
<P>
	Thorn, in a candid admission of what's ailing the game  
aesthetically, said the league wants to encourage fast breaks and a 
more wide-open style of play. The NBA is coming off the 
lowest-scoring season in its history, one in which just the 
Sacramento Kings averaged 100 points. The league-wide average of 91 
points a game was the lowest since the shot clock was introduced in 
1954-55. 
</P>
<P>
	``Of the 29 teams, 25 of the offenses are basically the same,''  
Thorn said, ``and I dare say that the majority of teams don't have 
a secondary fast break in their play book anymore. We're hoping 
this will get offenses to do some different things. We want to see 
some different looks and attacks.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The officials rules changes are:  
</P>
<P>
	--A prohibition on forearm checking, except below the free-throw  
line. 
</P>
<P>
	--A 5-second rule limiting the amount of time an offensive player  
not facing the basket can control the ball below the free-throw 
line before he must pass, shoot or pick up his dribble. 
</P>
<P>
	--Resetting the shot clock to 14 seconds instead of 24 on certain  
stoppages of play. 
</P>
<P>
	--An exemption from illegal defense rules for players positioned  
on the strong side of the court. 
</P>
<P>
	The change in the illegal defense rule will amount to allowing a  
zone defense in the low post. Theoretically, it will encourage 
defenses to use double-teams to guard against entry passes into the 
low post, thereby deterring offenses from dumping the ball into the 
big man and then standing around waiting for him to either make a 
move or pass the ball out to the 3-point line. The result, 
hopefully, will be more cutting, passing and mid-range jump 
shooting. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's going to be harder to score in a set, half-court offense,  
so it'll be in teams' best interests to run, push the ball upcourt 
and shoot the ball early,'' Thorn said. 
</P>
<P>
	Coaches and team executives said they will take a wait-and-see  
attitude toward the rules changes, which were first enforced during 
summer league games and resulted in an inordinate number of fouls. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think there will be a transitional period where things are  
called real literally for a while, and it'll take time for both the 
players and officials to figure out what's too physical and what's 
not,'' Indiana president Donnie Walsh said. 
</P>
<P>
	New Jersey Nets coach Don Casey wondered whether the referees  
might crack down too much on incidental contact in their zeal to 
rid the game of physical play. 
</P>
<P>
	``They will have it in their minds that if they allow incidental  
contact it will get bigger, so that one bothers me,'' Casey said.

<HEADLINE> McCain Criticizes Bush on Buchanan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Republican presidential hopeful Sen. John  
McCain accused George W. Bush, the party's front-runner, of 
``sacrificing our principles'' by refusing to condemn Pat 
Buchanan's views on Adolf Hitler and Nazi Germany. 
</P>
<P>
	``Like Governor Bush, I want to see a united Republican Party,''  
McCain said in a statement Saturday. ``But no political campaign is 
worth sacrificing our principles.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In an interview Friday with The Associated Press, Bush said he  
does not want Buchanan to leave the Republican Party and seek the 
Reform Party nomination for president. 
</P>
<P>
	Bush did not join other Republican and conservative leaders who  
have attacked Buchanan over his campaign book, ``A Republic, Not an 
Empire.'' The book questions the timing of the United States' entry 
into World War II because, Buchanan said, Germany was no threat to 
the United States after 1940. 
</P>
<P>
	``America has always stood ready to fight tyranny and  
oppression. The Republican Party has always stood for freedom,'' 
said McCain, R-Ariz. 
</P>
<P>
	``I urge all of the Republican presidential candidates to let it  
be known that there is no place in our party for anyone who would 
reject these principles. Our party must take a strong and forceful 
stand against the kind of language that threatens our commitment to 
freedom and democracy for all.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Mindy Tucker, a Bush spokeswoman, denied that the Texas governor  
has coddled Buchanan. 
</P>
<P>
	``Governor Bush has made it clear that he strongly disagrees  
with Pat Buchanan on this issue,'' she said. ``He believes we were 
fighting on the side of freedom and justice, and Republican voters 
will have a chance to express their opinion in the primaries.'' 
</P>
<P>
	McCain said he was disappointed by the reaction of his fellow  
candidates. ``By continuing to appease Buchanan, several of our 
candidates appear to have put politics ahead of our party's 
principles.'' 
</P>

	ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) -- Hillary Rodham Clinton still is not an  
official U.S. Senate candidate, but she seemed Saturday to drop any 
pretense that she might not be in the race. 
</P>
<P>
	``I want you to know that if I was leaning any more toward it, I  
would fall over right in front of you,'' Mrs. Clinton told a crowd 
in Albany's Washington Park chanting, ``Run, Hillary, run.'' 
</P>
<P>
	This came hours after the first lady debuted that line and gave  
a campaign-style speech to the Schenectady County Democratic 
Committee, which in April became the first such organization to 
endorse her possible candidacy. 
</P>
<P>
	``The kind of candidate I would be, the kind of senator I would  
be, is one who would represent the entire state and everyone who 
lives here,'' she told cheering Democrats at the Schenectady 
Museum. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Clinton is looking at the Senate seat being vacated next  
year by Democrat Daniel Patrick Moynihan. On the Republican side, 
New York City Mayor Rudolph Giuliani is considering a run. 
</P>
<P>
	In New York City, about 100 Republicans held a ``Go Home  
Hillary'' rally Saturday on Fifth Avenue.

	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Teamsters leader James P. Hoffa ruled himself  
out Saturday as a running mate for Pat Buchanan if the Reform Party

</P>
<P>
	Buchanan, a television commentator, is seeking the Republican  
nomination but is widely expected to quit the GOP and seek the 
Reform Party nod. 
</P>

	In a statement, Hoffa said he told Buchanan Saturday that ``I am  
not interested at this time in playing a role in presidential 
politics, except as an advocate for Teamster members.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Before the workers of America need a Teamster leader involved  
in presidential politics, they need a Teamsters union restored to 
its former strength,'' said Hoffa, the Teamsters president. 
</P>
<P>
	Hoffa's name came up a couple of weeks ago as Buchanan was  
reported considering possible running mates. Hoffa spokesman Chip 
Roth said no offer had been made at the time.

<HEADLINE> Texas Town Not Thrilled by Letterman </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TURKEY, Texas (AP) -- Not everyone in this Texas Panhandle town  
is thrilled at the chance to yuk it up on ``Late Show with David 
Letterman.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Biff Henderson, stage manager for the CBS show and a regular  
on-screen foil for Letterman, was in town with a crew this past 
week to interview residents for a segment on the program. 
</P>
<P>
	``A lot of people didn't want to be subjected to it,'' said Gary  
Johnson, who owns the Hotel Turkey. ``But my theory is, if you live 
in Turkey, Texas, you need to have a sense of humor anyway.''

<HEADLINE> Marlins Owner Wants Money for Park </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MIAMI (AP) -- Reversing his earlier position, Florida Marlins  
owner John Henry now says he must have taxpayer help if the team is 
to build a new ballpark. Otherwise, he says, ``Baseball in South 
Florida is doomed.'' 
</P>
<P>
	While campaigning this year for a new stadium, Henry repeatedly  
said he would pay the cost himself if necessary. But the 
multimillionaire commodities trader says he changed his mind in the 
past month. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's not feasible for the Marlins to build their own  
ballpark,'' he said. ``I'm not sure anyone would loan us the money. 
And I don't believe baseball would say, `That's fine. Build your 
own ballpark. You won't be competitive for the next 30 years, but 
we don't care.''' 
</P>
<P>
	Henry, who bought the Marlins in January from Wayne Huizenga,  
proposes a $400 million ballpark. Without taxpayer help, the 
project would saddle the franchise with debt for decades, making it 
impossible to finance a contending team, Henry said. 
</P>
<P>
	This year the Marlins have a $19 million payroll, second  
smallest in baseball, and Henry said they will still lose $5 
million. The Marlins began the weekend with the worst record in the 
major leagues, and this week against Montreal, they established 
franchise attendance lows for one game and a series. 
</P>
<P>
	The Marlins' bad record is only partly to blame for poor  
attendance this season. They've also been hampered by bad weather, 
with 13 home games delayed by rain and three others postponed. A 
new ballpark would include a retractable roof. 
</P>
<P>
	``That's $100 million right there,'' Henry said. ``I know we  
need a roof. We can't sit here in the rain with a thousand people 
showing up.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Henry made his comments Friday night while watching the team's  
final homestand of the season from the front row at Pro Player 
Stadium. His stadium campaign will intensify during the offseason, 
and he admitted the odds are against him. 
</P>
<P>
	``If you ask any elected officials, they'll tell you we won't be  
successful,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	If the campaign fails, Henry said, the Marlins have four  
alternatives: 
</P>
<P>
	-- Build a $400 million ballpark without taxpayer help;  
</P>
<P>
	-- Build a smaller, less expensive stadium, which would limit  
potential revenue; 
</P>
<P>
	-- Remain at Pro Player Stadium;  
</P>
<P>
	-- Move the team.  
</P>
<P>
	``I don't think any of those options are viable,'' Henry said.  
``If we can't get a public-private partnership, we don't have any 
options. You're basically saying that baseball in South Florida is 
doomed.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Henry has repeatedly promised not to move the team, and that  
pledge has left him with little leverage while lobbying for a new 
ballpark. He is popular with Marlins fans, but his stadium campaign 
has encountered widespread skepticism. 
</P>
<P>
	``The biggest problem South Florida has is too much cynicism,''  
said Henry, who lives in Boca Raton. ``It's a tremendously vital 
region. I love this area. But because there has been corruption and 
problems with violence, people are skeptical and cynical. It 
prevents action.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But Henry remains optimistic.  
</P>
<P>
	``I feel very strongly that we will be successful,'' he said.  
``I have to convince the community that having baseball is 
worthwhile. If I fail, then I've failed our baseball fans, I've 
failed the entire community, and I've failed major league 
baseball.''

<HEADLINE> Sergio Leaps Into Ryder Cup History  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BROOKLINE, Mass (AP) -- Sergio got the last leap.  
</P>
<P>
	One of the most entertaining Ryder Cup matches ever ended  
Saturday with teen-age phenom Sergio Garcia leaping into partner 
Jesper Parnevik's arms on the 18th green, and into Ryder Cup 
history. 
</P>
<P>
	And that was only for a halve.  
</P>
<P>
	The 7-footer he made to split his team's match with David Duval  
and Davis Love III capped an afternoon of spectacular shots, 
leaping golfers and more emotion on display than a year's worth of 
PGA tournaments combined. 
</P>
<P>
	When it was finally over, Garcia was hoarse and the Americans  
were drained. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm just glad we don't have to play them again together,''  
Love said. 
</P>
<P>
	This was a match so good that there didn't have to be a winner.  
This was a match so good that even Duval leaped into the air. 
</P>
<P>
	Well, sort of.  
</P>
<P>
	Duval's gleeful attempt at a twisting pyramid after sinking a  
long birdie putt on the 10th hole to put his team ahead didn't win 
any style points, but it was more emotion than the stoic American 
had ever shown on a golf course. 
</P>
<P>
	He pumped his fist four times and growled something at Love.  
</P>
<P>
	``We were in a bad spot, and anything I could do to help got me  
excited,'' Duval said. ``Especially after my lack of a stellar 
performance yesterday.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The best leaping, though, was still out there.  
</P>
<P>
	It came on the 12th hole when Parnevik holed a miracle pitch to  
salvage a half-point. It came on the 16th hole when Love ran in a 
long birdie putt to take the lead, sending captain Ben Crenshaw 
skipping across the green with his arms held high. 
</P>
<P>
	Finally, it came on the 18th hole when Europe needed a birdie to  
tie and Garcia had seven feet between his ball and the hole. 
</P>
<P>
	Parnevik was actually away and could have putted first, but his  
putt was a tricky downhiller, and he didn't want his young charge 
to putt if he had missed. So he told the Spaniard to putt first, 
and Garcia knocked the slightly curling putt right into the hole. 
</P>
<P>
	``I didn't want any bad thoughts in my mind,'' Garcia said. ``I  
just wanted to hit it. I felt like I had a lot of chances to make 
it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The U.S. team had cut the European lead to 8-5 and seemed on the  
verge of cutting it further after Love's putt on the par-3 16th 
hole dropped in. 
</P>
<P>
	The match was not only critical, it was coming against the  
unlikely pairing of the eccentric Swede with the rookie Garcia that 
until that point had won three straight matches against the 
Americans. 
</P>
<P>
	``That's their best team,'' Love said. ``I don't know why. But  
every time they both get on a green, it seems someone makes it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	At times, over four matches in two days, neither player needed  
to be on the green. 
</P>
<P>
	Parnevik put a 9-iron in the cup from 131 yards Friday on No. 8  
against Phil Mickelson and Jim Furyk, and Garcia followed six holes 
later by pitching in on the 14th hole for an eagle. 
</P>
<P>
	But when Parnevik hacked it around on the tough par-4 12th and  
was playing his fourth shot from 50 yards away in the deep rough, 
it may have been the duo's sweetest shot yet. 
</P>
<P>
	``I made a mess that hole,'' Parnevik said. ``I just told my  
caddie that I feel like I have to hole this. To see it go in was 
just unbelievable.'' 
</P>
<P>
	When the shot for par dropped, Parnevik leaped in the air and  
ran toward Garcia, expecting yet another embrace. Garcia, though, 
had already run leaping past him in jubilation. He had to turn back 
and get his hug. 
</P>
<P>
	``The Americans all played great. It's just that we have done  
very special things,'' Parnevik said. 
</P>
<P>
	It started out like Love and Duval would do some special things  
too, and for the most part they did. Duval, coming off a miserable 
0-2 day Thursday, hit his first iron to tap-in range on No. 1, and 
the Americans were 2-up through four. 
</P>
<P>
	Garcia made a birdie on the next hole, though, and Parnevik ran  
in a long birdie on No. 6 to tie things up. 
</P>
<P>
	A birdie on No. 8 gave the Europeans their only lead of the day,  
but Love, hitting from atop a rock outcropping, hit a long iron to 
the edge of the hole, nearly making it for double eagle on the 
ninth to even things back up. 
</P>
<P>
	Love was so excited he went running down the outcropping, and  
nearly slipped and fell. 
</P>
<P>
	It was just that kind of day.  
</P>
<P>
	``It feels like a loss to us, and I'm sure it feels like a win  
to them,'' Love said. 
</P>
<P>
	It certainly was a win to the Ryder Cup, which had never seen  
anything like this before.

<HEADLINE> Frentzen Grabs European GP Pole </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NUERBURGRING, Germany (AP) -- Heinz-Harald Frentzen was the top  
qualifier for the European Grand Prix, setting the fastest lap 
shortly before today's session ended. 
</P>
<P>
	Frentzen, who won the Italian Grand Prix at Monza two weeks ago,  
gambled by waiting until the end to take his Jordan onto the track, 
and the strategy paid off. 
</P>
<P>
	The German, who gained the second pole position of his career,  
edged the two McLaren-Mercedes drivers, David Coulthard and Mika 
Hakkinen, a co-leader in the driver standings. 
</P>
<P>
	Coulthard will start from the second position, while Hakkinen,  
the defending champion, will start from the second row of the grid, 
in third place. 
</P>
<P>
	Frentzen's fastest lap around the 2.831-mile Nuerburgring was  
one minute, 19.910 seconds, .266 seconds faster than Coulthard and 
.466 seconds ahead of Hakkinen. 
</P>
<P>
	It was only the third time in 14 attempts this year that  
Hakkinen had not taken the pole. 
</P>
<P>
	Eddie Irvine, who shares the standings' lead with Hakkinen, was  
far back in ninth place in his Ferrari. 
</P>
<P>
	Hakkinen and Irvine are tied at 60 points with three races left  
in the season. 
</P>
<P>
	Frentzen has 50, while Coulthard is just behind at 48.  
</P>
<P>
	By qualifying ahead of Hakkinen, Coulthard could be expected to  
drive his own race, rather than help Hakkinen fend off his rivals. 
</P>
<P>
	A shower drenched the track just before the qualifying session  
and many teams waited until the end of the hour to send their 
drivers out. 
</P>
<P>
	All leading times were set during the last five minutes.  
</P>
<P>
	``You don't know whether it's going to rain or not, you don't  
know whether to change tires or not,'' Frentzen said. 
</P>
<P>
	``I had too much fuel on my qualifying lap. But I came in to get  
fresh tires,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's the first time I get pole this year and it's great that  
it happened at Nuerburgring, especial after the chaos that we had 
the last two days,'' Frentzen said. 
</P>
<P>
	Frentzen, who has two victories this season, missed one of the  
two free practice sessions Friday with a oil pressure problems in 
his gear box. 
</P>
<P>
	In this morning's warmups before the qualifying, a new Honda  
engine had to be installed in his car, but an oil tank problem 
delayed his practice.

<HEADLINE> US Needs Help To Regain Ryder Cup  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BROOKLINE, Mass. (AP) -- For all the problems big government  
can't solve, here's one the bureaucrats in Washington might want to 
try their luck at: Helping America get the Ryder Cup back. 
</P>
<P>
	That's right.  
</P>
<P>
	Enough with relying on overpriced, overhyped, homegrown talent.  
It's time to try something different. It's time to give the U.S. 
Immigration and Naturalization Service a chance. 
</P>
<P>
	One way or another, America needs to find a dozen golfers like  
the ones Europe keeps packing its squads with. Golfers with nerves 
as steady as their skills. Who will sacrifice their own games or 
egos, when needed, to set a teammate up with a better chance. Who 
understand the difference between overlooked and undervalued. 
</P>
<P>
	At the close of play Saturday, Europe rolled out to a 10-6 lead  
and needed only four points from the dozen singles matches Sunday 
to hang onto the cup for a third straight meeting. This is how 
daunting the mission is: No winning side has ever made up a deficit 
of more than two points in the history of the competition. 
</P>
<P>
	``We knew coming in here it was going to be tough,'' said Davis  
Love III, one of the few Americans to get in the way of Europe's 
juggernaut. ``I'm just hoping that we wore these guys out, that 
some of them got rusty and some of them got tired.'' 
</P>
<P>
	That was the main talking point among members of the U.S. side.  
They were reduced to hoping that Europe's decidedly undemocratic 
approach to the matches would boomerang in the singles and 
ultimately cost them the cup. 
</P>
<P>
	Unlike his U.S. counterpart, European captain Mark James has  
kept three of his players -- rookies Andrew Coltart of Scotland, 
Swede Jarmo Sandelin and Frenchman Jean Van de Velde -- glued to the 
bench through the first two days of matches. He set up his four 
pairs and sent them out both days with exactly one change. 
</P>
<P>
	That means seven players have played all four matches and two  
others -- Spaniard Jose Maria Olazabal and Irishman Padraig 
Harrington -- have alternated playing alongside Miguel Angel 
Jimenez. But when someone asked James whether his players were 
fatigued, he simply shrugged. 
</P>
<P>
	``I didn't ask anyone if they were a little tired,'' James said.  
``I asked if they wanted to play. Two different things.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Some days,'' he added, ``I feel tired as soon as I get up.''  
</P>
<P>
	The better question to ask James might be where the European  
team keeps finding the tough, tireless components to fill out its 
team. 
</P>
<P>
	The disappearance of the ``Fab Five'' -- Seve Ballesteros, Nick  
Faldo, Bernhard Langer, Ian Woosnam and Sandy Lyle -- was supposed 
to signal the end of Europe's dominance in the Ryder Cup. After 
all, it was the emergence of that group, which won 16 majors 
between them, some two decades ago that enabled Europe to win or 
hold onto the cup through five of the last seven meetings. 
</P>
<P>
	Replacing them was supposed to be impossible. So Europe reloaded  
instead. 
</P>
<P>
	Scot Colin Montgomerie has stepped forward to replace  
Ballesteros as the team's lightning rod, challenging the Americans 
verbally and absorbing the hostile gallery's best shots. He's 
collected 2 1/2 of a possible four points. 
</P>
<P>
	Eccentric Swede Jesper Parnevik and the charismatic Spanish  
teen-ager, 19-year-old Sergio Garcia, have combined to become the 
unshakable anchor that the Ballesteros-Olazabal duo used to be. In 
four matches, they've won three times and tied the fourth. 
</P>
<P>
	Young Brits and close friends Lee Westwood and Darren Clarke  
have provided the steadying influence of Faldo and whichever Anglo 
he happened to be paired with at the time. Jimenez, Harrington and 
Olazabal, no longer the dominant Ryder Cup force he was once, have 
filled in admirably as role players -- taking the place of 
Costantino Rocca, Philip Walton and Ignacio Garrido. 
</P>
<P>
	The American resurgence on Saturday kept some slim hope alive.  
After digging themselves a four-point hole on opening day, they 
played Europe even Saturday and now approach the one format -- 
singles -- where their clear superiority in the world rankings and 
on the money list might translate into some serious points. 
</P>
<P>
	The question is whether that advantage will come too late to  
make up the difference. 
</P>
<P>
	U.S. captain Ben Crenshaw admitted he had no idea why the  
Europeans always play the team game so mystifyingly good. ``We're 
still trying to figure that out,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Either way, he looked obviously pleased to send out his players  
one time without any concern for chemistry. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think that the Americans ... I don't know ... but we feel  
good about singles,'' Crenshaw said. ``We really do.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Then he fixed his questioners for one last moment.  
</P>
<P>
	``I'm going to leave y'all with one thought. I'm a big believer  
in fate. I have a good feeling about this.'' 
</P>
<P>
	And if that doesn't work, well, there's always the INS.

<HEADLINE> Book: Reagan At Best Facing Soviets </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- In the soon-to-recede darkness of the Cold  
War, Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev looked at Ronald Reagan and 
saw ``sunshine and clear sky.'' Reagan looked back, at a man he was 
trying not to like, and thought he saw his first communist leader 
interested in peace. 
</P>
<P>
	Reagan's authorized biography, an advance copy of which was  
obtained by The Associated Press, provides a close-up view of the 
clouds that descended on Reagan in the final years of his 
presidency, thanks to the Iran-Contra scandal and apparent mental 
strain. 
</P>
<P>
	But when it came to the Soviet Union, at least, his blend of  
toughness and optimism seemed to carry him through. ``Of course,'' 
he told biographer Edmund Morris when asked if he believes in the 
power of human goodness. ``That's what it's all about.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Dutch: A Memoir of Ronald Reagan,'' will be on bookshelves  
Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	Americans have had to wait a long time to see the results of  
Morris' unusual access to Reagan during his second term from 1985 
to 1989. 
</P>
<P>
	In large measure, Reagan up close looks about the same as he has  
looked to skillful biographers a little farther from the action: a 
man who knew what he believed and wanted, sold it to the people, 
and both for better and worse, ``was not interested in anyone 
else's dreams,'' as Morris puts it. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think I'm an open book,'' Reagan said simply when Morris  
tried to plumb his psychological depths. 
</P>
<P>
	The book unwraps an interview with Reagan just as he was about  
to leave office, when, in Morris' opinion, the president was 
exhausted and no longer thinking straight. Yet Reagan spoke with 
the same mix of resolve and callousness that endeared him to fans 
and infuriated critics for years. 
</P>
<P>
	Disdainful of Lyndon Johnson's old worry that a misstep could  
start a nuclear conflagration, Reagan exclaimed that a show of 
military force when needed came with the territory. ``That's part 
of what this job is all about!'' he said. ``How could he have sat 
there, living in fear that somehow he might trigger a war?'' 
</P>
<P>
	Turning to the homelessness that marred the economic growth of  
his decade, Reagan said dismissively that ``more than 40 percent of 
them are retarded, mentally deficient people'' who choose that way 
of life. 
</P>
<P>
	Morris writes that when the Reagans decided in November 1994 to  
tell the public of the former president's recent diagnosis of 
Alzheimer's Disease, family, friends and doctors impressed upon him 
the need to write the letter himself and in his own handwriting. 
</P>
<P>
	Sullen at first, then resigned, Morris said, Reagan shut himself  
in his study and penned the haunting note about ``the journey that 
will lead me into the sunset of my life.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Morris quotes Nancy Reagan as telling him her husband went  
downhill quickly after that letter. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Reagan, caring for her husband in California, has so far  
declined comment on material leaked from the book. 
</P>
<P>
	Reagan is presented as largely surefooted with Gorbachev,  
despite a long-known episode of breathtaking spontaneity at the 
1986 Reykjavik, Iceland, summit, when the leaders almost talked 
themselves into giving up nuclear weapons altogether. 
</P>
<P>
	Asked what he saw in Reagan's eyes when they first met at Geneva  
arms talks in 1985, Gorbachev told the author: ``Sunshine and clear 
sky. We shook hands like friends. He said something, I don't know 
what. But at once I felt him a very authentic human being.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Reagan, for his part, mused: ``You could almost get to like the  
guy. I keep telling myself I mustn't do it, because he could 
turn.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Rough, often angry, but ultimately successful negotiations  
followed in Geneva, with Reagan holding firm on his Strategic 
Defense Initiative, as he would throughout his term to the enduring 
opposition of the Soviets. 
</P>
<P>
	``Why don't you believe us when we say we will not use weapons  
against you?'' Morris quotes Gorbachev as asking, building the 
account from aides who were inside the room. 
</P>
<P>
	``Why don't you believe that all I want is a shield?'' Reagan  
responded.

<P>
	``Please answer me -- what is your answer?'' Gorbachev said.  
</P>
<P>
	``I am answering,'' said Reagan, ``with a question for you.''  
</P>
<P>
	A muddled Reagan is portrayed in the Iran-Contra matter. Morris  
attended a November 1986 session where aides prepared Reagan for a 
news conference where he attempted to explain away the unfolding 
controversy over the gambit to win the release of hostages with 
secret arms sales to Iran -- a news conference later rated a 
disaster. 
</P>
<P>
	In the prep session, Reagan stated the CIA was not involved.  
``Yes, sir, they were,'' Adm. John Poindexter corrected him. 
</P>
<P>
	Reagan estimated the sales to be worth $1 billion. ``Much less,  
Mr. President,'' a worried Poindexter is quoted as saying. ``Don't 
get into specifics.'' 
</P>
<P>
	At the news conference, Reagan denied Israel's involvement as an  
intermediary, prompting the White House to issue a clarification 
later. 
</P>
<P>
	Morris reached no firm conclusions on Reagan's role in the  
illicit transfer of money to the Nicaraguan Contras from the arms 
sales, saying he suspects the president ``did authorize the 
transfer, not having the smallest comprehension of the laws he was 
subverting.''

	SINGAPORE (AP) -- Political turmoil in East Timor should not  
affect Southeast Asia's economic prospects, despite that the 
International Monetary Fund has effectively suspended aid programs 
to Indonesia, an Association of Southeast Asian Nations official 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have seen the worst in East Timor,'' Tay Thiam Peng of  
Singapore's Ministry for Trade and Industry said, adding that the 
breakaway province represents a ``political problem, not an 
economic one.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Tay's comments came as he announced that economic ministers from  
ASEAN will meet next week in Singapore to discuss how to attract 
investors and speed up implementation of a regional free trade 
area. 
</P>
<P>
	The ministers will meet Sept. 30 through Oct. 2.  
</P>
<P>
	The ministers' last meeting in Vietnam, in December was ``very  
gloomy,'' Tay said, as the region was suffering one of the worst 
economic crises in decades. Since then, most of the countries have 
demonstrated they are on the path to recovery. 
</P>
<P>
	Specifically, they will discuss how to speed up implementation  
of a trade agreement to have tariffs lowered to a maximum of 5 
percent in six founding ASEAN countries -- Thailand, Singapore, 
Malaysia, Indonesia, Brunei and the Philippines -- by 2002. 
</P>
<P>
	In Indonesia, Tay dismissed the role of IMF aid as just ``one of  
the factors'' in the country's economy. Indonesia's agriculture and 
exports have shown signs of marked recovery, he said.

	DOVER, Del. (AP) -- Tony Stewart will hear all the accolades that  
go to the Rookie of the Year when that designation becomes official 
two months from now, at the end of the Winston Cup season. 
</P>
<P>
	But Stewart, the best first-year driver in the circuit's 29  
years, won't take much time to bask in the limelight. He'll spend 
most of the offseason getting ready to take the Joe Gibbs Racing 
Pontiac beyond the unexpected heights he reached in 1999. 
</P>
<P>
	Another off-season interest will be putting together teams not  
involved in the Winston Cup. 
</P>
<P>
	``I still have interest in the IRL as a car owner,'' said  
Stewart, the 1997 champion of the Indy Racing League. ``I've even 
got my eye on the World of Outlaws.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Both open-wheel and dirt cars are a great fit for Stewart, who  
became the biggest star in USAC before moving to the IRL. 
</P>
<P>
	But Stewart's overriding concern remains driving for Gibbs. In  
May, Stewart became the second driver in history to race on the 
same day in the IRL's Indy 500 and Winston Cup's Coca-Cola 600, but 
has no immediate plans for an encore. 
</P>
<P>
	He finished ninth at Indy and fourth at Concord, N.C., but  
believes he should have done better at Lowe's Motor Speedway. 
</P>
<P>
	``If the car was capable of winning that race, then I was the  
weak link,'' Stewart said. ``If I had won instead of finishing 
fourth, I would have another 15 points.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Stewart, almost a certainty to become the highest-finishing  
rookie ever, is fourth going into the MBNA Gold 400 Sunday at Dover 
Downs International Speedway. He is 17 points behind third-place 
Mark Martin. 
</P>
<P>
	``It just goes to show how much every position matters in every  
race,'' Stewart said. ``I have to give it a 100 percent effort.'' 
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	 *BASEBALL CAR:* If fans at Dover Downs International Speedway  
believe the number they saw on the sides and roof of Wally 
Dallenbach's Chevrolet showcar appeared to be superimposed on a 
baseball, they weren't seeing things. 
</P>
<P>
	Primary sponsor Budweiser -- a longtime backer of Winston Cup  
racing and major league baseball -- is marking the final World 
Series of the 1900s with a special paint scheme for the No. 25 car 
of Hendrick Motorsports. 
</P>
<P>
	The car will have a baseball theme -- including the logos of both  
the National and American leagues for all races during the month of 
October. 
</P>
<P>
	Those will be among Dallenbach's final rides for Hendrick. He  
said Friday that he will drive for Butch Mock Motorsports for the 
next three seasons. A formal announcement is expected in a few 
weeks. 
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	 *AND THE REST:* Winston Cup points leader Dale Jarrett is mired  
in a slump of sorts -- losing 60 points from his lead in the past 
month. He will start 26th in the MBNA 400 at Dover Downs 
International Speedway Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	Jarrett posted only the 38th-fastest qualifying time Friday and  
had to make the field in the second round Saturday. He also will be 
ailing behind the wheel. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've got a lot of back pain,'' Jarrett said. ``It got bad  
Friday afternoon, and I got very little sleep Friday night. 
</P>
<P>
	``But they've been working with me and at least I'm able to move  
around and tie my shoes now.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Three-time Winston Cup champion Darrell Waltrip failed to  
qualify for the fourth time this year and second in a row. Others 
failing were Dick Trickle, Derrike Cope, Andy Belmont and Todd 
Bodine. 
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	 *PIT STOPS:* Ricky Rudd -- seeking to extend his modern NASCAR  
record of winning at least once in 17 consecutive seasons -- and 
Bill Elliott top the active drivers with four victories each at 
Dover. ... Both Richard Petty and Bobby Allison won seven times at 
the Monster Mile. ... A victory by Jeff Gordon, Terry Labonte or 
Wally Dallenbach would give Hendrick Motorsports seven at Dover, 
tying the Wood Brothers for the most in track history. The Woods 
haven't been to the winner's circle at Dover since the late Neil 
Bonnett won the 1981 fall race. ... Ken Schrader, a winner of the 
spring race in 1991, hasn't won anywhere since -- a drought of 261 
starts. ... Elliott's losing streak is 153 races. ... Six times in 
track history -- most recently by Gordon in 1996 -- a driver has won 
both the spring and fall events. ... Labonte will extend his series 
record for consecutive starts to 629.

<HEADLINE> Seles in Japan Tennis Final </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TOKYO (AP) -- Monica Seles is in a familiar place, the finals of  
the Toyota Princess Cup. 
</P>
<P>
	Seles, a five-time champion and winner of the event the last  
three years, defeated eighth-seeded Ai Sugiyama of Japan 6-3, 7-6 
(7-3) in the semifinals Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
	The second-seeded Seles will play top-seeded Lindsay Davenport,  
who yielded only 11 points on her own serve in an easy 6-2, 6-1 
victory over seventh-seeded Amy Frazier in the other semifinal. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm the huge underdog here in Tokyo,'' Davenport joked of  
Seles' winning streak. Seles, ranked fifth in the world, has a 5-0 
record in the tournament, also capturing the trophy in 1991 and 
1992. 
</P>
<P>
	``I haven't played her almost a year since last November,'' said  
Davenport, the world's No. 2 player. ``It's going to be a difficult 
match. She's never going to give up.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Lindsay has been playing some terrific tennis last week in the  
Fed Cup and again here,'' Seles said. ``So, it would be a very 
difficult match.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Both players were members of the U.S. Fed Cup team which  
captured its 16th title with a 4-1 win against Russia last weekend. 
</P>
<P>
	``The winner will be the one who plays more aggressively and  
drives the ball deeper,'' said Davenport, who counts herself and 
Seles as two of the top five women's tennis players this season, 
along with top-ranked Martina Hingis and the Williams sisters, 
Venus and Serena. 
</P>
<P>
	Seles generally agreed with Davenport's list of top players. ``I  
think it's been the way this year.'' But she added, ``I would 
probably put Mary Pierce in there. I think she's been playing very 
well, although maybe not as consistently as in the previous year.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Seles was broken in the first game of the opening set after  
serving two double faults. But she came back quickly to break 
Sugiyama in the next game after a couple of deuces. 
</P>
<P>
	Seles broke Sugiyama again in the eighth game for a 5-3 lead,  
and held serve to close out the set in 41 minutes. 
</P>
<P>
	The 25-year-old Seles, winner of 12 Grand Slam events, built a  
5-3 lead in the second set with good serves and her double-fisted 
groundstrokes. 
</P>
<P>
	But Sugiyama, who shared in the mixed doubles title at the U.S.  
Open two weeks ago, saved two match points on her serve with a 
backhand winner down the line and a couple of service winners, then 
broke to tie it 5-5. 
</P>
<P>
	After both players held serve, Seles overcame a 3-1 deficit in  
the tiebreaker and won five straight points to take the second set 
in 58 minutes. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was a bit of a struggle,'' Seles said. ``I definitely was  
not a happy camper, especially after having two match points at 
5-3.''

<HEADLINE> No. 22 Texas 62, Baylor 0 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WACO, Texas (AP) -- Major Applewhite passed for 333 yards and  
three touchdowns and Hodges Mitchell scored three TDs to spark No. 
22 Texas' 62-0 whipping of Baylor on Saturday night. 
</P>
<P>
	Chris Robertson added to TD runs for Texas (4-1 overall, 1-0 Big  
12), which amassed 586 yards. 
</P>
<P>
	Texas' first shutout since 1991 was the worst loss for Baylor  
since a 77-0 Texas blowout in 1913. 
</P>
<P>
	Baylor (0-4, 0-2) has lost 10 straight and is off to its worst  
start since 1978 under first-year coach Kevin Steele. 
</P>
<P>
	When Texas last came to Waco two years ago, fans rushed the  
field and tore down the goal posts after a 23-21 Baylor victory. 
Baylor students have kept those posts on campus as a reminder of 
the upset. 
</P>
<P>
	Baylor fans were more likely to rush out of Floyd Casey Stadium  
in frustration this time. The Longhorns built a 42-0 halftime lead, 
scoring six touchdowns on their first nine possessions. 
</P>
<P>
	Texas led 14-0 in the first quarter after Robertson capped the  
Longhorns' opening drive with a 1-yard run and Mitchell ended the 
quarter with a 3-yard scoring run. 
</P>
<P>
	Mitchell scored his second touchdown less than a minute later,  
running in from 13 yards one play after Texas linebacker De'Andre 
Lewis intercepted a pass from Baylor quarterback Odell James. 
</P>
<P>
	James had just been put in the game to jump-start a Baylor  
offense which gained just 11 yards on its first three possessions 
behind starter Jermaine Alfred. 
</P>
<P>
	Robertson scored on a 1-yard run after Baylor lost a fumble on  
its 17. Applewhite connected with tight end Chris Smith from 14 
yards and wideout Ryan Nunez from 8 yards before halftime. 
</P>
<P>
	Applewhite, who was 26-of-37, connected with Mitchell for a  
10-yard score in the third quarter before leaving with Texas up 
52-0. 
</P>
<P>
	After losing its first two games to Boston College in overtime  
and Nevada-Las Vegas on a fluke 100-yard fumble return as time ran 
out, Baylor has been outscored 103-10 in losses to Oklahoma and 
Texas. 
</P>
<P>
	Baylor rushed for 12 yards on 20 carries and had more return  
yards (167) than offensive yards (159) against Texas.

<HEADLINE> Russia Urged To Attack Corruption </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The United States and its wealthy allies told  
Russian authorities on Saturday there was a ``critical need'' for 
that country to attack corruption and money laundering. 
</P>
<P>
	Financial leaders from the world's seven largest industrial  
countries saw encouraging signs that the global economy was 
beginning to stabilize after nearly two years of severe financial 
turmoil although there was discussion among the group about the 
threats posed from a potentially overheated U.S. economy. 
</P>
<P>
	In an 11-page joint statement, the finance ministers and central  
bank presidents of the Group of Seven countries noted that Japanese 
authorities had given assurances that they intended to supply 
necessary government stimulus until ``domestic-demand-led-growth is 
solidly in place.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Treasury Secretary Lawrence Summers, briefing reporters after  
the talks concluded, stressed that language as key to understanding 
the G-7 position. 
</P>
<P>
	``Japan was a key focus of discussion,'' Summers said. The  
United States has been stressing the need for Japan not to relent 
in its efforts to lift its economy from its worst recession in 50 
years. 
</P>
<P>
	The communique was issued at the end of more than five hours of  
discussions among financial leaders of the world's biggest 
economies -- the United States, Japan, Germany, France, Britain, 
Italy and Canada. 
</P>
<P>
	Russian Finance Minister Mikhail Kasyanov met with the group at  
the end of their afternoon discussions in an historic mansion near 
the White House in an effort to answer questions that have been 
raised in the wake of the money laundering probes. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are committed to cooperate with any investigation,''  
Kasyanov told reporters after emerging from the meeting. He said 
that Russia had already begun taking measures to control capital 
flight from the country, a term that covers both the legal transfer 
of money and illegal transfers. 
</P>
<P>
	The communique said prospects looked good for both the United  
States and Canada to continue with ``another year of solid growth 
and job creation in a low-inflation environment.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But German Finance Minister Hans Eichel told reporters that the  
finance officials had discussed worries that the U.S. economy could 
overheat, with growth so strong that it ignites inflation 
pressures. 
</P>
<P>
	Eichel said that Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan, who  
also participated in the discussions, ``made it clear that he is 
monitoring the situation.'' The Fed has already raised interest 
rates twice since June 30 and some economists believe a third rate 
hike may occur at the Fed's next meeting on Oct. 5. 
</P>
<P>
	Japanese Finance Minister Kiichi Miyazawa told reporters he had  
assured Summers and Greenspan that the Japanese government is 
committed to continuing efforts to boost government spending as 
needed to make sure that Japan's efforts to emerge from worst do 
not falter. 
</P>
<P>
	The G-7 communique did not include language Japan had wanted on  
keeping the yen from strengthening further against the dollar. 
Instead, the group merely pledged to ``monitor developments in 
exchange markets and cooperate as appropriate.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But Italian Finance Minister Giuliano Amato said the G-7  
officials had not ruled out the possibility of joint intervention 
in currency markets at some point in the future. He said such 
action would be taken ``when and how it is deemed appropriate.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The G-7 discussions were being held in advance of the annual  
meetings of the 182-nation International Monetary Fund and the 
World Bank, sessions that are expected to be focused on ways to 
promote further reforms in the world financial system to prevent, 
or at least better manage, future Asian-style currency crises. 
</P>
<P>
	In that regard, the G-7 said they had set up a new Group of 20  
nations, including both wealthy and poor countries, who will hold 
their first meeting in Berlin in December with Canadian Finance 
Minister Paul Martin as chairman. 
</P>
<P>
	The Group of 20, which was strongly pushed by the United States,  
is seen by the administration as a way to include relevant 
policy-makers in brainstorming sessions to come up with more 
far-reaching financial reform proposals. 
</P>
<P>
	The G-7 officials indicated that the upcoming IMF and World Bank  
meetings would produce a comprehensive strategy to greatly expand 
the amount of debt relief provided the world's poorest nations, 
something that officials have been trying to implement for more 
than two years. 
</P>
<P>
	Even with the unfolding Russian investigations, this year's IMF  
and World Bank meetings are taking place in an atmosphere markedly 
improved from a year ago. Then, a botched devaluation of the 
Russian ruble and the near collapse of a large American hedge fund 
threatened to push the United States and the rest of the world into 
recession. 
</P>
<P>
	That calamity was avoided in large part because the U.S. economy  
has continued to outperform expectations, serving as a market for 
crisis-striken Asian nations. 
</P>
<P>
	But with the trade deficit soaring to an annual rate of $247  
billion, 50 percent higher than last year's record, U.S. officials 
are growing more concerned about the sustainability of that huge 
imbalance. 
</P>
<P>
	The dollar has fallen by 15 percent against the yen over the  
past 10 weeks. The decline has raised worries in the United States 
about higher inflation and a potential sharp correction in the 
stock market if foreign investors begin to cash out their sizable 
U.S. holdings over worries about the dollar's weakness. 
</P>
<P>
	The Dow Jones industrial average fell by 524 points over the  
past week with stock prices now standing 1,047 points below the 
record high set on Aug. 25.

<P>
	RALEIGH, N.C. (AP) -- Lacerations, bee stings and sick stomachs  
from contaminated water are keeping emergency room doctors busy as 
floodwaters recede in eastern North Carolina. 
</P>
<P>
	But so far, there have been no outbreaks of infectious disease,  
health officials said. The federal Centers for Disease Control and 
Prevention is helping the state health department keep an eye on 
illnesses so they can corral any possible outbreak. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're seeing people whose lives have just been devastated.  
What's remarkable is that we haven't seen more'' illnesses and 
injuries, said Dr. Herb Garrison of Pitt County Memorial Hospital. 
</P>
<P>
	Flooding caused sewage treatment plants and hog waste lagoons to  
overflow and contaminate drinking water supplies. Farming and 
industrial chemicals have worsened the problem. In some areas, 
people must drink bottled water or boil tap water, probably for 
weeks to come. 
</P>
<P>
	``Now, especially due to the flooding, we are seeing more nausea  
and diarrhea, from drinking contaminated water, most likely,'' Dr. 
Cathy Dover of Lenoir County Memorial Hospital said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're also seeing a lot of rashes, poison ivy, a lot of fire  
ant (bites). We've seen a few individuals bitten by dogs over the 
past several days.'' 
</P>
<P>
	More problems are expected to emerge over the weekend,  
especially mosquitoes. 
</P>
<P>
	In some areas, they are already thick enough that a person  
standing still will be bitten 200 times in one minute, said Johanna 
Reese of the state Division of Environmental Health. Planes are 
scheduled to start spraying pesticides next week. 
</P>
<P>
	Mosquitoes can spread a deadly encephalitis. While encephalitis  
is rare, health officials are stepping up efforts to watch for the 
disease in horses and chickens. 
</P>
<P>
	``Normally if you're going to have an outbreak of encephalitis,  
you see it in the animals first and then the humans,'' said Dr. 
Christopher Ohl of Pitt County Memorial Hospital. 
</P>
<P>
	Molds growing in soaked furniture and carpeting could intensify  
asthma and allergy problems. Infections borne by molds can cause 
fever, coughing and wheezing, Ohl said. 
</P>
<P>
	Hundreds of thousands of dead hogs, chickens and turkeys still  
pose a health threat because they attract swarms of flies. 
</P>
<P>
	State health officials are trying to stop flies from spreading  
by sprinkling piles of carcasses with insecticides that kill 
maggots, Reese said.

<HEADLINE> Six Elected to US Ski Hall of Fame </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ISHPEMING, Mich. (AP) -- Renowned French ski racer and instructor  
Emile Allais, longtime journalist John Henry Auran and the late ski 
jumping champion Merrill ``Mezzy'' Barber of Brattleboro, Vt., led 
a group of seven inducted Saturday night into the U.S. National Ski 
Hall of Fame. 
</P>
<P>
	Allais, bronze medalist in combined in the 1936 Winter Olympics  
at Garmisch-Partenkirchen, Germany, was the first French world 
champion, capturing both ends of the combined event -- downhill and 
slalom -- in the 1937 World Championships at Chamonix. He also took 
the silver medal in slalom in the 1938 world championships at 
Engelberg, Switzerland, but a broken ankle ended his racing career 
in 1939. 
</P>
<P>
	He went on to an illustrious career as an instructor, devising  
the parallel-ski method, and ski resort designer. His 1937 book on 
``The French Method'' was a sensation and he later helped design 
Squaw Valley, Calif., site of the 1960 Winter Games, as well as 
Courchevel, LaPlagne and other French resorts. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition, Allais taught for many years at Portillo, Chile,  
and was alpine Olympic coach for Canada in 1948 and the United 
States in 1952. 
</P>
<P>
	Barber, made an honorary citizen of Norway because of the  
affection he generated while training and competing there before 
World War II, was the 1952 U.S. ski jumping champion. He was a 
member of the 1940 U.S. Olympic Team, which did not get to compete 
because of the approaching world war, and spent years working with 
young skiers in southern Vermont before his death in 1989. 
</P>
<P>
	Auran, a veteran of four decades covering skiing in this  
country, is a former managing editor of Ski Magazine and senior 
editor of Skiing Magazine. 
</P>
<P>
	Other inductees were veteran alpine racing official Dr. J.  
Leland Sosman of Waterville Valley, N.H.; jumping official Fritz 
Mittelstadt of Rothschild, Wis.; ski pole designer Edward Scott of 
Ketchum, Idaho; and Pacific Northwest ski resort pioneer Webb 
Moffett of Snoqualmie, Wash.

<HEADLINE> Lost Probe Won't Alter NASA Plans </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PASADENA, Calif. (AP) -- The celebratory Mars candy bars lay  
uneaten on a desktop, not far from the computers that would have 
monitored the heartbeat of NASA's latest Martian probe -- if it had 
survived. 
</P>
<P>
	Sam Thurman, flight operations director for the lost Mars  
Climate Orbiter, fought back tears in a control room decorated with 
pictures of the probe and a globe of its target. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's tough to find the words,'' he said. ``I guess  
`devastated' would be one. And `embarrassed.' These are publicly 
funded missions and everybody on the team is keenly aware that a 
spacecraft paid for by the taxpayers has been lost.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But Thursday's disappearance of the $125 million Mars Climate  
Orbiter, while a sting to its scientists, isn't likely to change 
the agency's direction or delay future missions, NASA Administrator 
Daniel Goldin said. 
</P>
<P>
	Orbiter -- built in about four years on what for space  
exploration was a shoestring budget -- was a poster probe for NASA's 
policy of faster, better and cheaper solar system missions. The 
Mars Observer probe that vanished in 1993 cost nearly $1 billion, 
eight times as much as this week's loss. 
</P>
<P>
	``When we went forward with faster, better and cheaper, we said  
we were going to push the boundaries and be prepared for failure -- 
maybe one or two failures out of 10,'' Goldin said. ``And that's 
about where we are.'' 
</P>
<P>
	NASA has launched more than 20 missions over the last five years  
and lost three -- including the Mars Climate Orbiter. 
</P>
<P>
	Agency officials believe the probe burned up in the red planet's  
atmosphere as it reached its orbit Thursday. They suspect a 
software glitch or human error brought the probe too close to the 
planet, and investigators are trying to figure out how to prevent 
it from happening again. 
</P>
<P>
	Another probe, the Mars Polar Lander, is scheduled to reach Mars  
Dec. 3. 
</P>
<P>
	``When there are so many missions being launched, there are  
going to be some failures,'' said Carl Pilcher, NASA's science 
director for solar system exploration. ``It's probably an 
inevitable part of pushing the envelope.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But some question whether the long hours, tight deadlines and  
slim budgets mandated by the agency contribute to mistakes and 
failures. 
</P>
<P>
	``Whether in addition to cutting costs they're cutting corners,  
that's the obvious question at this point,'' said John Pike, 
director of space policy at the Federation of American Scientists. 
</P>
<P>
	Before Orbiter disappeared, NASA was considering some changes in  
its program, including creating a team to think up potential 
problems. On Friday, Goldin said employee workload probably should 
be reviewed as well. 
</P>
<P>
	``These people are working unbelievably intense and hard,'' he  
said. ``We ought to take a look and see if maybe people are working 
a little too hard.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Space exploration is a challenging business, and the number of  
probes lost under NASA's new policy is comparable to those lost in 
previous years, Goldin said. 
</P>
<P>
	During the 1970s and 1980s, NASA launched a few behemoth probes  
that cost billions of dollars to develop, launch and operate. The 
Viking Mars missions cost $2 billion and employed about 500 people. 
</P>
<P>
	When the Mars Observer probe vanished in 1993, it wiped out Mars  
exploration for years because it was carrying all NASA's scientific 
eggs in one basket. 
</P>
<P>
	Now, there are more probes. ``When we lose one, it won't be a  
catastrophe,'' said Bruce Murray, a California Institute of 
Technology planetary scientist and former director of NASA's Jet 
Propulsion Laboratory. ``There is enough going on so that the 
overall program remains robust.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The climate monitoring instruments lost with the Mars Climate  
Orbiter could be resent with future missions, launched every 26 
months when the planet's positions are favorable. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's not an all-or-nothing program anymore,'' Goldin said.  
``It's not the last ship out of port. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a question of how fast we're going to recover from this,  
not will we recover.''

<HEADLINE> Da Devil Wins Kentucky Cup Classic </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	FLORENCE, Ky. (AP) -- The duel between trainers Bob Baffert and  
D. Wayne Lukas failed to materialize Saturday at Turfway Park as 
60-1 long shot Da Devil won the $500,000 Kentucky Cup Classic. 
</P>
<P>
	Da Devil, ridden by Calvin Borel, circled horses at the top of  
the stretch and maintained a half-length lead over Social Charter 
the rest of the way. Cat Thief was third, another head back. 
</P>
<P>
	Borel said Da Devil had not run well during a morning workout on  
Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	``He really didn't impress me at all,'' Borel said. ``We were  
going into the race like we really didn't have a shot.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Borel, who picked up the mount because of an injury to regular  
rider Joseph Judice, said trainer Forrest Kaelin had only one piece 
of advice before the race. 
</P>
<P>
	``The first thing he told me was, `Whatever you do, please go  
around,''' Borel said, meaning keep the Da Devil out of trouble on 
the rail. 
</P>
<P>
	The race had shaped up as a duel between Classic Cat, trained by  
Baffert, and Cat Thief, trained by Lukas. Cat Thief finished third, 
and Classic Cat faded to seventh in the eight-horse field. 
</P>
<P>
	Cat Thief broke to the lead and maintained a half-length  
advantage over Nite Dreamer for the first half-mile. Social Charter 
swept by them on the outside at the top of the second turn and Da 
Devil went widest of all to take a short lead at the top of the 
stretch. 
</P>
<P>
	Even though the track was listed as fast, Da Devil's winning  
time of 1:50 2-5 for 1 1/8 miles was the slowest in the six-year 
history of the race. Hansel set the track record of 1:46 3-5 in the 
Jim Beam Stakes in 1991. Silver Charm and Wild Rush equaled the 
Classic record of 1:47 2-5 in a dead heat last year. 
</P>
<P>
	Da Devil returned $132.80, $36.20 and $6.60. Social Charter paid  
$4.20 and $2.60, while Cat Thief was $2.40 to show. 
</P>
<P>
	There were three other graded stakes on the card.  
</P>
<P>
	Successful Appeal, trained by John Kimmel and ridden by Edgar  
Prado, won the Grade II Sprint, finishing six lengths ahead of Five 
Star Day. 
</P>
<P>
	Ruby Surprise, trained by Robert Holthus and ridden by Willie  
Martinez, won the Grade III Turfway Breeders' Cup, beating Let by a 
length. 
</P>
<P>
	And Millencolin, trained by Lukas and ridden by Pat Day, won the  
Grade III Juvenile by two lengths over Personal First.

<HEADLINE> UN Chief Counts World Bank Failures </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan chided world  
financial leaders Saturday for paying too little attention to jobs 
for the poor and even causing increased unemployment with some 
economic programs. 
</P>
<P>
	He recommended ``major policy changes'' that focus on increasing  
jobs, especially among the young. 
</P>
<P>
	Half the young people in poor countries -- close to 450 million --  
are ``neither at school nor at work,'' Annan said in remarks 
prepared for delivery Saturday at the annual meeting of the World 
Bank and the International Monetary Fund. Another 20 million youth 
also are unemployed in the rich countries, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	``What is needed is not just growth, but growth that creates  
jobs,'' Annan said. 
</P>
<P>
	He said financial leaders seem to have lost sight of people's  
key needs: to send their children to school, to have enough money 
to feed their families, to have a piece of land. 
</P>
<P>
	Using the language of financial experts, Annan said structural  
adjustment programs, privatization and enterprise restructuring 
have increased unemployment levels in Latin America. 
</P>
<P>
	In Asia, the continent-wide financial crisis wiped out 25  
million jobs, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Even in the best of times, he said, millions of people are  
surviving with very low pay for very long hours. 
</P>
<P>
	He cited double-digit unemployment rates in Europe, widespread  
joblessness in former Soviet republics, a decline in the demand in 
Latin America for unskilled labor, families torn apart across 
Africa by men seeking jobs far away from home, a job-seeking 
migration into the cities of South Asia and the inability of 
recovering East Asian economies to absorb newcomers to the work 
force. 
</P>
<P>
	``Yes, it is important to remove barriers to trade and financial  
flows, and to give the private sector a bigger role in the 
economy,'' Annan said, speaking of the keystones of the market 
economy. ``But these are means to an end, not an end in 
themselves.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He said world economic policies should be aimed both ``to ensure  
that everyone who wants to work has the chance to do so and to 
provide for the basic needs of all the population.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Market-based reforms have had many successes but more needs to  
be done,'' he said. ``So far they have not contributed 
significantly to the growth of employment worldwide.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He said the World Bank, IMF and other multinational lenders need  
to increase long-term capital flows into the poorest countries and 
direct public funds in all countries towards projects that create 
the most jobs. 
</P>
<P>
	Annan, a native of Ghana and the first United Nations chief born  
in Africa, said improvements in communication let many of the 
planet's poorest and least-educated glimpse through film and 
television the lifestyles of the most affluent. 
</P>
<P>
	``That makes it naive to imagine,'' he said, ``that people in  
the remotest villages or the worst urban shantytowns regard their 
own deprivation as anything but exceptional, unnecessary, and -- 
above all -- profoundly unjust.''

<HEADLINE> NBA Mulling Minor League Overseas </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	VANCOUVER, British Columbia (AP) -- In a shift in strategy on  
international expansion, commissioner David Stern said the NBA 
might place a developmental league overseas within five years. 
</P>
<P>
	``We might be the first league that decides to have a minor  
league that will move lock, stock and barrel to another continent 
for another season,'' Stern said Saturday. ``An NBA developmental 
league, once it exists, has enormous potential for international 
play.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Stern said such a venture would be modeled after the WNBA -- with  
the league owning all franchises, setting salary levels and 
centralizing business operations. 
</P>
<P>
	The biggest impediment, Stern said, is the lack of  
state-of-the-art arenas outside North America. 
</P>
<P>
	``The United States is far and away ahead in arena development  
in every kind of city, while those kind of activities are just now 
getting under way outside the U.S,'' he said. ``There are new 
buildings in Sheffield, Birmingham, Turin and Cologne. But by and 
large most of the buildings are older and don't have the amenities 
that we have become accustomed to.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Stern's comments, made in a nearly hour-long meeting with  
reporters on the final day of the league meetings, marked a 
significant shift in the league's position on expanding overseas. 
Previously, the NBA insisted it preferred to support the 
development of foreign leagues and would not want to place its own 
product into those markets for fear of diminishing the home-grown 
commodity. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have to evaluate it more seriously than we have in the  
past,'' he said. ``We see nothing but opportunity, and the 
marketplace is calling.'' 
</P>
<P>
	On other subjects, Stern:  
</P>
<P>
	-- expressed dismay that many people in Vancouver have taken it  
as a foregone conclusion that the Grizzlies, who were sold 
Thursday, will be moved to St. Louis. 
</P>
<P>
	-- said increased scoring need not be an ``essential'' by-product  
of the new rules changes. 
</P>
<P>
	-- conceded that the NBA as a product, is ``not as enjoyable to  
watch as it was meant to be.'' 
</P>
<P>
	-- said that, at age 57, he has no plans to step aside as  
commissioner or retire. 
</P>
<P>
	-- divulged that efforts aimed at establishing a minimum age or  
otherwise deterring high schoolers and college underclassmen from 
entering the league have not progressed. 
</P>
<P>
	-- disclosed that his major piece of unfinished business is  
harnessing the power of his players' popularity to affect positive 
changes in society. 
</P>
<P>
	The NBA has vowed to move forward in establishing a minor league  
that would serve as more of a farm system for its 29 teams, and 
talks have been held with new Continental Basketball Association 
owner Isiah Thomas about an increased role in that league for the 
NBA. 
</P>
<P>
	``The CBA has not been as impactful as it might have been, and  
we sort of have an obligation post-lockout to look at this issue, 
especially as it pertains to players being able to develop better, 
and players who are younger who would benefit from playing in a 
structured situation,'' Stern said. 
</P>
<P>
	The NFL has been a pioneer in expanding overseas, including the  
old World League that has evolved into a developmental league known 
as NFL Europe. 
</P>
<P>
	``In the next couple of years we will be getting some  
interesting opportunities for the NBA to affiliate in some way with 
the foreign operations of leagues in Europe, Latin America and 
Asia,'' Stern said. 
</P>
<P>
	``There seems to be an increasing sentiment on the part of our  
business and broadcast partners that there's a strong contribution 
to the growth of basketball that the NBA can make by being more 
involved internationally than we are now.''

<HEADLINE>  Clinton Said To Be In Good Health </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BETHESDA, Md. (AP) -- President Clinton has gained 18 pounds  
since his last complete physical examination but is in ``excellent 
health,'' a team of doctors reported Saturday. They said swollen 
vocal cords were causing his recent hoarseness and recommended he 
rest his voice. 
</P>
<P>
	The 53-year-old president, who has enjoyed generally good health  
since entering the White House in 1993, weighs 214 pounds, still 
within the normal range of up to 220 pounds for a 6-foot-2-inch 
man, said Clinton's physician, Dr. Connie Mariano. 
</P>
<P>
	``He would feel best and most fit if he could drop about 10  
pounds,'' White House press secretary Joe Lockhart told reporters 
outside the Bethesda Naval Medical Center. 
</P>
<P>
	Doctors recommended a low-calorie diet and more exercise, which  
Lockhart said Clinton's staff will try to help Clinton maintain. 
</P>
<P>
	Two small skin abnormalities were removed from Clinton's  
forehead in what doctors described as a routine precautionary 
treatment. Such skin conditions, typically caused by sun exposure, 
sometimes can become cancerous. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton's battery of tests took about five hours, and included  
checkups by 14 specialists, including a cardiologist, dermatologist 
and urologist. It was his fifth complete physical examination as 
president. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton has been bothered by a hoarse and raspy voice since  
returning from a trip to New Zealand in mid-September. His voice 
broke twice during a speech Tuesday to the United Nation's General 
Assembly, but seemed to improve a bit after a day with no public 
speaking engagements on Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	By Friday night, Clinton again was noticeably hoarse. He  
repeatedly cleared his throat during two evening political 
speeches. 
</P>
<P>
	The doctors diagnosed the swollen vocal cords caused in part by  
``voice overuse.'' The recommendation: Clinton rest his voice over 
the next 10 days, and no yelling at the television during sporting 
events. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton kept up on the Ryder Cup golf tournament during the  
testing regimen, Lockhart said. There was no word on the calorie 
count of the lunch the doctors shared with Clinton afterward -- 
chicken enchiladas with mango sorbet for dessert. 
</P>
<P>
	During his last physical, in October 1997, the president was  
fitted with in-the-ear hearing aids. They helped with a longtime 
problem that Clinton said made it difficult to understand voices in 
crowded receptions or sometimes even to catch what hecklers were 
shouting at him. 
</P>
<P>
	The 1997 medical team also removed a benign cyst from the  
president's chest and pronounced him fully recovered from an injury 
to his knee that hospitalized him for a few days early in the year. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton used crutches for months after tearing a tendon when he  
stumbled on steps at the Florida home of golf pro Greg Norman. 
</P>
<P>
	Over the years Clinton also has had an additional cyst removed  
from his neck and a precancerous skin lesion removed from his nose. 
Doctors described all of those conditions as common for a man his 
age. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton also has taken prescription medicine to inhibit severe  
heartburn known as acid reflux disease. He also has a number of 
allergies, including sensitivity to household dust and grass and 
weed pollen.

	6.5-Magnitude Aftershock Rattles Taiwan  
</P>
<P>
	TAIPEI, Taiwan (AP) -- A 6.5-magnitude aftershock rattled central  
Taiwan Sunday morning, killing two motorists in a landslide and 
collapsing several buildings already weakened from Tuesday's quake. 
Meanwhile, Taiwan's president signed a rare emergency decree that 
gives the military increased powers to maintain order and creates 
severe sentences for black-marketeers who try to overcharge for 
scarce necessities.

	UNITED NATIONS (AP) -- Facing potential sanctions if it does not  
extradite war crimes suspect Mladen Naletilic, Croatia complained 
today that the International War Crimes Tribunal was ignoring 
atrocities committed against Croats. Naletilic has been indicted 
for atrocities he allegedly committed against Bosnian Muslims in

	GROZNY, Russia (AP) -- Russia's air force pumped up the pressure  
on breakaway Chechnya Saturday, knocking local television and radio 
off the air and sending tens of thousands of civilians fleeing 
toward neighboring regions. It was the third day of punishing 
airstrikes on the capital, Grozny. Russia's air campaign had been 
focused on bombing suspected rebel bases, but now it is targeting 
economic installations and civilian communications facilities as 
well.

<P>
	DUARTE, Calif. (AP) -- Judith Campbell Exner, a reputed mistress  
of John F. Kennedy who claimed to have ferried messages between the 
president and Mafia boss Sam Giancana, died of breast cancer 
Friday. She was 65. Exner made waves in 1977 with her 
autobiography, ``My Story,'' which included a description of her 
alleged affair with Kennedy. In a 1996 issue of Vanity Fair, Ms. 
Exner said she ended a two-year affair because she hated being 
``the other woman,'' and also claimed that she aborted Kennedy's 
child 10 months before he was assassinated.

	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The United States and its wealthy allies told  
Russian authorities today there was a ``critical need'' for that 
country to attack corruption and money laundering. Russian Finance 
Minister Mikhail Kasyanov met with financial leaders from the 
world's seven largest industrial countries in an effort to answer 
questions that have been raised in the wake of the money laundering 
probes. Kasyanov said that Russia had already begun taking measures 
to control capital flight from the country, a term that covers both 
the legal transfer of money and illegal transfers.

	Clinton, GOP Spar Over Tax Bill  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Clinton and the House's top  
Republican found little common ground today as they took the tax 
cut fight to the airwaves. Clinton wants negotiations on tax cuts 
less than the $792 billion package he vetoed Thursday and on money 
for debt reduction and programs the GOP wants eliminated. Speaker 
Dennis Hastert calls that ``a fool's choice'' that defies ``plain

	Reagan Biographer Inserts Fiction  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Ronald Reagan biographer Edmund Morris said he  
weaved fiction into his facts when writing Reagan's authorized 
biography, Morris told Newsweek Magazine. ``When you asked him a 
question about himself, it was like dropping a stone into a well 
and not hearing a splash.'' So seven years after being granted 
frequent access to Reagan and under a $3 million contract for the 
book with Random House, Morris decided to break his biographer's 
block by inserting himself as a sometimes-fictional character in 
the narrative.

	No. 6 Nebraska Defeats Missouri 40-10  
</P>
<P>
	COLUMBIA, Mo. (AP) -- The No. 6 Nebraska Cornhuskers capitalized  
on two high punt snaps and an interception to take a 16-point 
first-quarter lead en route to a 40-10 victory over Missouri 
tonight. Missouri, which has lost 36 straight games to top-10 
opponents since 1981, had two punts blocked for touchdowns in its 
opener against Alabama-Birmingham Sept. 4.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Threatens Tax Credit Veto </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- It seems that this year, every time  
Republicans make a move on taxes, the Clinton White House starts 
talking about vetoes. 
</P>
<P>
	It happened again Friday when the House Ways and Means Committee  
began moving a five-year, $23.3 billion measure to renew expiring 
tax credits and ensure that millions of middle-class taxpayers 
don't become liable for the alternative minimum tax. 
</P>
<P>
	The individual items in the package have strong bipartisan  
support, but Treasury Secretary Lawrence Summers told Democrats 
privately he would recommend a veto by President Clinton because 
the measure would consume part of the projected budget surplus 
before other priorities are met. 
</P>
<P>
	That infuriated House Republicans, who accused Clinton and  
Democrats of using the ``extenders'' package as a bargaining chip 
in larger spending and tax battles. The president vetoed the GOP's 
centerpiece 10-year, $792 billion tax cut Thursday but said he 
might sign a smaller package. 
</P>
<P>
	Today, Clinton described the package he vetoed as ``just too  
big, too bloated.'' He said in his weekly radio address that the 
GOP package would have put ``too big a burden on our economy and 
run the risk of higher interest rates and lower growth.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``At the same time, they're still not providing nearly enough  
for education and other vital priorities,'' he said. Among programs 
he said would have been endangered were expansion of Head Start, a 
tutoring reading project, provision of Interconnect connections to 
the nation's classrooms and others. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm terribly confused,'' Rep. Bill Archer, R-Texas, chairman  
of the Ways and Means Committee, said after Clinton vetoed the tax 
package. ``It is becoming painfully clear that the only specific 
priority for the president this fall is higher and higher 
Washington spending.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The top Ways and Means Democrat, Rep. Charles Rangel of New  
York, said Clinton was rightly holding the line on spending the 
budget surplus until the future solvency of Social Security and 
Medicare is ensured and the elderly gain a new prescription drug 
benefit. 
</P>
<P>
	``This bill is not paid for,'' Rangel said. ``These are very,  
very popular items, but they don't want to work it out with the 
president.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Ways and Means Committee approved the extenders package on a  
strict party-line vote after defeating a Democratic alternative 
that would have paid the costs by closing several corporate tax 
shelters. The bill next moves to the full House. 
</P>
<P>
	Originally part of the larger tax cut, the package includes a  
five-year extension of the research and development tax credit 
popular with high-tech industry and manufacturers. In addition, it 
would permanently ensure that middle-class taxpayers who claim 
credits such as the $500-per-child credit do not become entangled 
in the complex, costly alternative minimum tax, or AMT. 
</P>
<P>
	The measure also renews credits encouraging businesses to hire  
former welfare recipients and people from groups who traditionally 
have trouble keeping jobs. It extends an oil and gas provision and 
one exempting from taxes certain foreign corporate income from 
banking, insurance or financing business. 
</P>
<P>
	Most of the bill would be paid for by using projected budget  
surpluses, but its $1.5 billion cost in fiscal 2000 would be offset 
by raising taxes on high-income individuals for that year only. 
Also to save money, companies would be ``suspended'' from taking 
the research and development credit until Oct. 1, 2000. 
</P>
<P>
	The veto rhetoric aside, the sheer popularity of the extenders  
and the need to get them done quickly -- the Internal Revenue 
Service says it needs guidance by Oct. 7 to do the proper AMT forms 
-- means they will likely win final approval. 
</P>
<P>
	However, the package is one more bit leverage the White House  
can use to push through at least its Medicare reform and 
prescription drug benefit, if not a Social Security fix. 
</P>
<P>
	Toward that end, Summers and White House chief of staff John  
Podesta met Friday with Senate Finance Committee Chairman William 
Roth, R-Del., to begin exploring common ground on these issues as 
well as tax relief.

	PENDLETON, Ore. (AP) -- A blinding dust storm blowing across a  
desert stretch of Interstate 84 set off three deadly collisions 
between semitrailers and cars Saturday that left six dead and 
injured at least a dozen more. 
</P>
<P>
	Dozens of vehicles were involved in the three pileups in the

<HEADLINE>  Gore, Bradley Face 'Real Contest' </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Al Gore and Bill Bradley squared off Saturday  
for the first time, previewing a ``real contest with real choices'' 
between the sitting vice president and his surging challenger 
seeking the Democratic presidential nomination in 2000. 
</P>
<P>
	Addressing powerful Democrats from across the country, Gore  
promised to ``work my heart out'' for their support. Bradley urged 
them to embrace -- not shirk from -- a fight for the party's 
nomination. 
</P>
<P>
	``What better way to energize voters ... than a contest that  
brings two people together for a spirited debates of ideas -- a real 
contest with real choices decided by voters in caucuses and 
primaries throughout this nation,'' Bradley told the Democratic 
National Committee. 
</P>
<P>
	Gore walked from behind the lectern to wander the stage.  
Unusually informal and emotional, he energized the crowd with 
criticism of Republican front-runner George W. Bush. 
</P>
<P>
	Attacking Bush's pro-gun views, the vice president asked of  
Bush, ``Why don't you join us to take the weapons of evil out of 
the hands of evildoers?'' 
</P>
<P>
	In back-to-back speeches, neither candidate mentioned the other  
by name, though they slipped in subtle digs. It marked the first 
time the two foes made a joint appearance to court the same crowd, 
both campaigns said. 
</P>
<P>
	The 428 DNC members, most of whom are allies of Gore and  
President Clinton, cast votes at the Democratic presidential 
convention. 
</P>
<P>
	Though he is the party's front-runner, Gore had the biggest need  
for a solid speech. Even in the DNC's bastion of Gore allies, the 
perception is taking hold that his campaign is lackluster and 
suffering from ties to Clinton's scandal-plagued presidency. 
</P>
<P>
	Gore did not mention Clinton in his remarks.  
</P>
<P>
	In hallway and barroom conversations, the activists talked about  
new polls in New Hampshire showing Bradley in a dead heat with 
Gore. Independents and moderate Democrats are especially drawn to 
the former New Jersey senator in that first-in-the-nation primary 
state and in neighboring New York. 
</P>
<P>
	Gore holds big leads elsewhere.  
</P>
<P>
	``I'm telling people this is a long process and he's committed  
to working for America's families. We're solid in Iowa. We're solid 
in California,'' Gore campaign chairman Tony Coelho said. 
</P>
<P>
	Bradley hoped to continue mending relations with some hardcore  
Democrats who recall that he left the Senate in 1996 after calling 
the political system -- and, by implication, his party -- ``broken.'' 
</P>
<P>
	With an understated delivery, Bradley tried to spell out why  
Democrats should consider rejecting Gore and giving him a serious 
look. He gave the Clinton administration credit for improving race 
relations and the economy, but he said more needed to be done on 
those and other issues. 
</P>
<P>
	``We've accomplished so much,'' he said in an implicit  
recognition of the Clinton-Gore successes, but, ``What else is 
there to do?'' 
</P>
<P>
	Gun control, poverty, health care and campaign finance reform  
were among the topics he promised to champion, eventually drawing 
contrasts with Gore. He spent little or no time on other issues 
critical to the Democratic base -- abortion, Medicare and Social 
Security. Gore talked about all three. 
</P>
<P>
	In the end, perhaps recognizing the audience was stacked in  
Gore's favor, Bradley struck a civil tone. ``I want you to know 
that whether you are for me or against me that we share that same 
goal of mutual respect,'' Bradley said. 
</P>
<P>
	Gore, accused of being too stiff for presidential politics, used  
his hands for emphasis. He echoed Bradley's call for gun control 
but focused more on family and education issues. 
</P>
<P>
	He, too, offered veiled criticism of his challenger. ``I have  
never been for (school) vouchers,'' Gore said, recognizing that 
most of the activists know that Bradley once supported limited 
programs. 
</P>
<P>
	Gore's campaign clearly wants to make the case that Bradley  
abandoned the party in 1996 and Gore is the race's true Democrat. 
The vice president's supporters wore buttons that read, ``ALways a 
Democrat'' -- with ``AL'' in blue letters and the rest in red. 
</P>
<P>
	The flashy, expensive Gore campaign and ploddingly efficient  
Bradley campaigns showed their stuff. 
</P>
<P>
	Bradley made a non-descript entry to the room, spoke with  
reading glasses perched atop his nose and waded through the crowd 
afterward. Gore sped through the crowd, flanked by Secret Service 
agents, with rock music blaring throughout the hall. 
</P>
<P>
	They were interrupted by applause in roughly the same numbers.  
Afterward, activists said both performed well but not great. 
</P>
<P>
	Both campaigns played their share of backroom games. The Bradley  
team e-mailed supporters urging them to attend the meeting. The 
work paid off with crowds of mostly young, sign-toting supporters 
that nearly rivaled the impressive showing produced by Gore's team. 
</P>
<P>
	Gore, who had been scheduled to speak before Bradley, abruptly  
sought and secured the final speaking slot -- making his the last 
impression left with activists. Gore deployed more staff and spent 
more time at the three-day meeting than Bradley.

<HEADLINE> No. 3 Florida 38, Kentucky 10 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LEXINGTON, Ky. (AP) -- Doug Johnson threw for 241 yards and two  
touchdowns and Robert Gillespie ran for 108 yards and a pair of 
scores as No. 3 Florida beat Kentucky 38-10 on Saturday night. 
</P>
<P>
	Despite losing tailback Earnest Graham to a severe thigh bruise  
on the second play of the game, the Gators (4-0, 2-0 Southeastern 
Conference) had little difficulty extending their winning streak 
over the Wildcats (2-2, 0-1) to 13 games. 
</P>
<P>
	Just as it did two years ago in a 55-28 victory at Commonwealth  
Stadium, Florida jumped to a 28-0 first-half lead and coasted, 
rolling up 476 yards of offense. 
</P>
<P>
	Though Johnson burned the Wildcats badly on a couple pass plays,  
it was the Florida running game that did the most damage. With the 
Gators' line opening wide holes, Gillespie and Bo Carroll had 
little trouble picking up for Graham, averaging nearly 8 yards per 
carry as Florida rushed for 224 yards. 
</P>
<P>
	There were few highlights for Kentucky coach Hal Mumme's ``Air  
Raid'' offense, which didn't score until the final possession of 
the first half. Sophomore quarterback Dusty Bonner had his worst 
day as a starter, completing 36 of 46 attempts for 254 yards, no 
touchdowns and an interception. 
</P>
<P>
	Gillespie keyed Florida's first touchdown with a short catch  
that he broke for a 47-yard gain. That set up Carroll's 14-yard 
scoring run with 10:22 left in the first quarter. 
</P>
<P>
	On the next Florida scoring drive, it was Carroll running up a  
seam in the Kentucky defense for 25 yards, then John Capel going 14 
yards on an end around. 
</P>
<P>
	That set up Johnson's play-action fake and deep throw to Darrell  
Jackson, who streaked 49 yards to the end zone for a 14-0 lead. 
</P>
<P>
	Bonner looked shaky in the first half, struggling to find open  
receivers and overthrowing a couple. Florida made him pay for his 
most serious mistake, a second-quarter overthrow that was easily 
intercepted by Bennie Alexander. Five plays later, Gillespie bulled 
into the end zone for a 21-0 Florida lead with 9:57 left in the 
half. 
</P>
<P>
	The Gators pushed the advantage to 28-0 with a 10-play, 80-yard  
drive that ended with Johnson finding Brian Haugabrook in the left 
corner of the end zone. 
</P>
<P>
	Bonner led Kentucky on a 10-play, 80-yard drive near the end of  
the half, as the Wildcats got on the scoreboard on Derek Homer's 
5-yard run with 1:24 left. 
</P>
<P>
	When the Wildcats drove to a 37-yard field goal by Marc Samuels  
to start the second half, they were within 18 points, but that was 
as close as they would get. 
</P>
<P>
	Florida answered with Jeff Chandler's career-best 49-yard field  
goal to make it 31-10. 
</P>
<P>
	Homer, benched after fumbling twice in the Wildcats' first three  
games, ran for 83 yards but fumbled deep in Florida territory late 
in the third quarter. 
</P>
<P>
	It was the sixth straight year in which Florida beat Kentucky by  
double digits, but the Gators' point total was their lowest against 
the Wildcats since a 24-20 thriller in 1993.

<HEADLINE> Court Nixes Late-Term Abortion Laws </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ST. LOUIS (AP) -- A federal appeals court has struck down laws in  
three states that banned a type of late-term abortion, calling the 
statutes unconstitutional. 
</P>
<P>
	A panel of the 8th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals ruled  
separately Friday on cases from Nebraska, Arkansas and Iowa, 
issuing all three rulings the same day because the cases were so 
similar. The cases involve what opponents call ``partial-birth 
abortion.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The late-term procedure involves partially extracting a fetus,  
legs first, through the birth canal, cutting the skull and draining 
the contents. 
</P>
<P>
	The three states are among 28 that have adopted late-term  
abortion bans since 1995, although the courts have blocked or 
limited enforcement in 19 of those states. 
</P>
<P>
	In Friday's decisions, the court cited concerns about the  
vagueness of the laws -- measures that the judges believed could be 
read to prohibit common abortion procedures. 
</P>
<P>
	``The central difficulty with the Arkansas statute is that it  
covers too much,'' Chief Judge Richard Arnold wrote. 
</P>
<P>
	In the Nebraska case, Arnold wrote that the law ``would prohibit  
in many circumstances the most common method of second-trimester 
abortion. Such a prohibition places an undue burden on the right of 
women to choose whether to have an abortion.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Janet Benshoof, president of Center for Reproductive Law and  
Policy, said the court's rulings represented a rebuke to lawmakers 
who sought the bans. 
</P>
<P>
	``The court's ruling confirms that the entire campaign to ban  
partial-birth abortion -- a campaign that has consumed Congress and 
the federal courts for over three years -- is nothing but a fraud 
designed to rob American women of their right to abortion,'' she 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	The ruling did not sit well with anti-abortion organizations,  
which urged the states to appeal. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's disappointing whenever a court finds that this type of  
killing is protected by law,'' said Mary Spaulding Blach, director 
of state legislation for the National Right to Life Committee. 
</P>
<P>
	Nebraska Attorney General Don Stenberg said his state would  
appeal.

<HEADLINE> Fans Go 'Gonzo' Over D'Backs Title </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PHOENIX (AP) -- In a city where just about everyone seems to be  
from somewhere else, the fever finally is rising for Arizona's 
newest home team. 
</P>
<P>
	Fans gathered in sports bars across the Valley of the Sun on  
Friday night to watch as the Diamondbacks clinched the NL West 
title with an 11-3 victory over the Giants in San Francisco. 
</P>
<P>
	Cheers and chants mixed with booze and high-fives at Jackson's  
on Third, a popular sports bar just one block from Bank One 
Ballpark. 
</P>
<P>
	``Randy! Randy! Randy!'' they chanted for Randy Johnson.  
</P>
<P>
	``Gonzo! Gonzo! Gonzo!'' they cheered as a champagne-drenched  
Luis Gonzalez showed up on the screen. 
</P>
<P>
	They hollered ``We Want The Braves'' over and over again, a  
heady challenge to the perennial NL powers from Atlanta. 
</P>
<P>
	``Awesome, absolutely thrilling, wonderful,'' said Gina Mallory,  
44, of Tempe, whose eyes never left the screen for every pitch of 
Friday night's game. ``I used to live in St. Louis and I was a 
Cardinals fan for years, but this is awesome.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Much has been made of how there hasn't seemed to be a frenzy for  
the Diamondbacks, who became the first baseball team to clinch a 
playoff berth in just its second season. 
</P>
<P>
	But there have been recent signs that the support is growing.  
</P>
<P>
	In downtown, the Bank One Tower had office lights on to signify  
the magic number of Arizona wins or San Francisco losses needed to 
clinch the crown. 
</P>
<P>
	A big white ``one'' shone across the desert sky Friday night as  
the game began. 
</P>
<P>
	As the game wore on, and Arizona's lead grew, fans cheered ever  
more loudly, when Kelly Stinnett and Tony Womack homered, when 
Giants' third baseman Bill Mueller threw the ball away twice, and 
when Randy Johnson did just about anything. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are sooooo good,'' said Carl Mosher, 21, of Phoenix,  
sharing several pitchers of beer with his buddies. 
</P>
<P>
	The crowd cheered loudest when, in the ninth inning, the camera  
switched to the Arizona clubhouse for a closeup of the champagne on 
ice. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't think people around the country are taking us  
seriously,'' said Robert Viether, 25, of Phoenix, who wore a 
Diamondbacks jersey with Brian Anderson's No. 34. ``The farther we 
go in the playoffs, the more seriously they'll take us.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Wearing a purple team jersey and matching hat, Darryl Brown, 34,  
of Phoenix, said he has been a Diamondbacks fan from the start, a 
whole two years ago, and he rooted for the team that lost 97 games 
last year. 
</P>
<P>
	This year, he's not sure how far the Diamondbacks can go. For  
now, this is far enough. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think Atlanta can beat us,'' he said, ``and Cincinnati has  
owned us. Just getting to the playoffs in the second year, that's 
history. No matter how we do in the playoffs, nobody can take that 
from us.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Diamondbacks scheduled a celebration Sunday night at Bank  
One Ballpark Plaza. The team is to make an appearance at the event 
when they arrive back from San Francisco, the Diamondbacks said in 
a news release issued late Friday night.

<HEADLINE> Spanish Festival Honors French Film </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SAN SEBASTIAN, Spain (AP) -- A love story set in the French  
countryside won best picture honors Saturday at Spain's San 
Sebastian Film Festival. 
</P>
<P>
	The French production ``C'est Quoi la Vie?'' (What's Life About)  
by director Francois Dupeyron took the Golden Shell award, while 
Jacque Dufilho was named best actor for his work in the film. 
</P>
<P>
	In a controversial vote, Spain's Aitana Sanchez Gijon was named  
best actress for ``Volaverunt,'' which traces the life of 
18th-century artist Francisco de Goya. Some audience members booed 
the decision, apparently agreeing with Spanish critics who had 
panned the film. 
</P>
<P>
	The award for contribution to cinema was shared by  
English-language actresses Angelica Huston and Vanessa Redgrave, 
along with veteran Spanish star Fernando Fernan Gomez. Past winners 
included Bette Davis and Gregory Peck. 
</P>
<P>
	Two men shared the best director honors. Michel Deville of  
France won for ``La Maladie de Sachs'' (Sach's Illness), about the 
life of a doctor. And Zhang Yang of China was awarded for 
``Xizhou'' (Shower), which explores the importance of bathing in 
Chinese society. 
</P>
<P>
	The prize for best new director went to Frenchman Laurent Cantet  
for his emotionally charged social drama about unemployment titled 
``Ressources Humaines,'' (Human Resources).

<HEADLINE> TV Host Bob Barker Out of Hospital </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Game show host Bob Barker was released  
Saturday from George Washington University Hospital following a 
nine-day stay for treatment of a blocked artery. 
</P>
<P>
	``I am feeling fine and looking forward to resting so I can soon  
return to work,'' the host of television's ``The Price is Right,'' 
said in a statement. 
</P>
<P>
	Doctors ordered Barker, 75, to rest for a few weeks but gave him  
permission to fly home to Los Angeles on Sunday, said hospital 
spokeswoman Lisa Saisselin. 
</P>
<P>
	Barker was hospitalized Sept. 16 while visiting Washington.  
Tests revealed his left carotid artery was 85 percent blocked. He 
underwent a procedure Monday to clear the blockage. 
</P>
<P>
	During his hospital stay, Barker received a flood of calls,  
cards and gifts, said Saisselin. 
</P>
<P>
	``Bob Barker has received more attention than any congressman or  
senator hospitalized,'' she said.

<HEADLINE> No End Yet to Kaiser Labor Dispute </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SPOKANE, Wash. (AP) -- Stan White is spending more time  
housecleaning these days, and he's looking for work. His daughter 
had to transfer to a college closer to home to save money. 
</P>
<P>
	White is among nearly 3,000 United Steelworkers who have been  
off the job since Sept. 30, 1998 because of a labor dispute with 
Kaiser Aluminum &AMP; Chemical Corp. 
</P>
<P>
	``I was the prime breadwinner, now my wife is,'' said White, 58.  
``Our income was chopped down 60 percent.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Workers at five Kaiser aluminum plants around the country went  
on strike in a dispute over wages, benefits and job security. On 
Jan. 13, the workers offered to return to their jobs while 
negotiations continued, but the company refused and locked them 
out. 
</P>
<P>
	Since then, the plants have operated with managers and  
replacement workers. The latest round of talks broke up in 
mid-August and no new meetings are scheduled. 
</P>
<P>
	In the midst of the nation's economic boom, this labor dispute  
has drawn little attention. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's odd for me to read in newspapers about how the average  
wage in the nation is going up and employers are more desperate for 
skilled employees,'' said Larry Strom, a 19-year employee and union 
leader. 
</P>
<P>
	More than 2,000 of the striking employees work at two plants in  
the Spokane area. Much smaller plants are in Tacoma, Wash.; 
Gramercy, La.; and Newark, Ohio. 
</P>
<P>
	Kaiser has lost millions of dollars since the strike began.  
Numerous replacement workers have been injured and the Gramercy 
plant was heavily damaged by an accidental explosion in July. But 
it isn't planning to capitulate. 
</P>
<P>
	``We can run indefinitely in the way we are running today,''  
Kaiser President Ray Milchovich said. ``A number of these 
operations, especially in Spokane, are at all-time record 
performance levels.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In its latest offer, Kaiser proposed pay increases of $3.13 per  
hour over a 5-year contract, plus some benefits improvements. 
</P>
<P>
	Kaiser says pay and benefits for most workers cost the company  
about $62,000 per year. Union officials said that translates to 
take-home pay of about $15 an hour. 
</P>
<P>
	But Kaiser also is demanding that 700 workers be laid off. And  
it wants 239 jobs covered by the old contract -- including janitors 
and groundskeepers -- to be ``outsourced'' to nonunion workers. 
</P>
<P>
	``That's union-busting,'' said Jon Youngdahl, a steelworkers  
official in Auburn. 
</P>
<P>
	The dispute contrasts with generally good management-labor  
relations in the aluminum industry, said David Foster, the union's 
chief negotiator. 
</P>
<P>
	``Kaiser is fighting over tenths-of-a-penny per pound in labor  
cost savings,'' Foster said. 
</P>
<P>
	But company negotiator Jeremy Sherman said the issues total  
millions of dollars per year and jeopardize the company's survival. 
</P>
<P>
	``The Steelworkers would like to create the myth that it would  
have been more favorable to accept a Steelworker contract. That is 
untrue,'' Sherman said. ``It's analogous to a shakedown artist who 
says `pay me this money, because if you don't I'll burn down your 
store.''' 
</P>
<P>
	Foster said the dispute is preventing Kaiser, the nation's fifth  
largest aluminum producer, from merging with some of the other 
major players in the industry. In August, Alcoa Inc. struck a deal 
to buy Reynolds Metals Inc. in a $4 billion-plus agreement that 
would join the world's No. 1 and No. 3 aluminum companies. 
</P>
<P>
	Many workers were prepared for a lengthy walkout, and a union  
strike fund has paid them $90 to $125 a week depending on need. 
</P>
<P>
	But unemployment benefits ran out in mid-August, noted Strom,  
vice president of Steelworkers Local 329. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'd like people to understand things are getting more tense as  
folks run out of unemployment,'' Strom said.

	OKLAHOMA CITY (AP) -- Billy Pricer, a fullback on Oklahoma's  
national championship teams in 1955 and 1956, has died. He was 65. 
</P>
<P>
	Pricer died Friday at his home in Oklahoma City after an  
extended illness. 
</P>
<P>
	He never lost a game as a Sooner. Oklahoma was 31-0 during  
Pricer's three varsity seasons. His era was part of the Oklahoma's 
NCAA-record 47-game winning streak. 
</P>
<P>
	Pricer shared the running assignments with halfbacks Tommy  
McDonald and Clendon Thomas. 
</P>
<P>
	He played five seasons in the pros. He was a backup on two of  
the Baltimore Colts' NFL title teams led by Johnny Unitas, Lenny 
Moore and Alan Ameche. He played one season with the Dallas Texans 
of the AFL.

<HEADLINE> High-Resolution Satellite Launched </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	VANDENBERG AIR FORCE BASE, Calif. (AP) -- The first commercial  
satellite capable of taking pictures approaching the detail of spy 
satellites has roared into orbit, five months after an identical 
spacecraft was destroyed in an unsuccessful launch. 
</P>
<P>
	Space Imaging Inc.'s Ikonos satellite lifted off Friday aboard a  
Lockheed Martin Athena II rocket and entered a near-polar orbit 
some 400 miles high. 
</P>
<P>
	Pictures produced by the satellite are expected to be useful in,  
among other things, urban planning, environmental monitoring, 
mapping, assessing the scope of natural disasters, oil and gas 
exploration, and planning communication networks. 
</P>
<P>
	The company said Ikonos can distinguish objects on the ground as  
small as one meter square, or about 3 feet by 3 feet. Such detail 
would include individual trees, boats, ships and roads -- but not 
individual people, the company said. 
</P>
<P>
	Such high resolution means the images cannot be sold to just  
anybody. But Space Imaging doesn't expect the government to 
restrict the pictures and customers to such an extent that the 
project is not commercially viable. 
</P>
<P>
	``We obviously can't sell any kind of product to people who are  
identified as terrorist countries,'' said John Copple, chief 
executive of the Denver-based company. 
</P>
<P>
	``The government, under our license, has the ability to do three  
things: limit the distribution of imagery, tell us specific spots 
in the world they would not like us to collect (images) or actually 
require us to turn the system off.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The new Ikonos was built as a backup for Ikonos 1, which failed  
to reach orbit after launch aboard an Athena II on April 27. 
Lockheed Martin said the aerodynamic covering over the payload 
failed to come off properly because of an electrical problem. 
</P>
<P>
	Ikonos is expected to begin producing imagery for sale in 60 to  
90 days.

<HEADLINE> Trekker Found After Two Months </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	POWELL RIVER, British Columbia (AP) -- A 47-year-old man was  
found weak with hypothermia and barely able to speak after trekking 
for weeks without food. 
</P>
<P>
	Police said the man, who was not identified, nearly died during  
his two-month journey across the Toba Glacier, located in the Coast 
Mountains of southwestern British Columbia. 
</P>
<P>
	The man was spotted Thursday on a logging road, about six miles  
northeast of Powell River, said Sgt. Andy Brinton. He was carrying 
two rifles and wearing a black garbage bag over several layers of 
clothing. 
</P>
<P>
	When police reached him, he could hardly speak or walk, Brinton  
said. 
</P>
<P>
	The man told police he'd left his cabin on Toba Inlet on July  
17, but ran out of food supplies about a month ago. He survived on 
berries and trout caught in creeks, and slept in the bush under 
trees and in crevices. 
</P>
<P>
	He was taken to Powell River General Hospital, and was listed in  
stable condition Friday.

<TEXT>
<P>
	Michigan made Ron Dayne disappear in the second half. Dayne's  
Heisman Trophy hopes may have disappeared in the process. 
</P>
<P>
	Tom Brady threw two touchdown passes and the fourth-ranked  
Wolverines held Dayne to 88 yards, all in the first half, as the 
Wolverines beat No. 20 Wisconsin 21-16 Saturday in a Big Ten 
opener. 
</P>
<P>
	Dayne carried 22 times, but not at all in the last 10 minutes of  
the game as the Badgers tried to catch up. He needs 1,105 yards in 
Wisconsin's seven remaining games to break Ricky Williams' Division 
I-A rushing record. 
</P>
<P>
	Michigan (4-0), which held Syracuse to 59 rushing yards last  
week, shut down its opponent's ground game for the second straight 
week. Dayne ran eight times in the second half for no net yardage 
and twice failed to get critical first downs for the Badgers (2-2), 
who couldn't rebound from last week's loss to Cincinnati. 
</P>
<P>
	In other Top 25 games, it was No. 1 Florida State 42, North  
Carolina 10; No. 2 Penn State 45, Indiana 24; No. 5 Texas A&AMP;M 23, 
Southern Mississippi 6; No. 7 Tennessee 17, Memphis 16; No. 11 
Georgia 24, Central Florida 23; No. 12 Ohio State 34, Cincinnati 
20; No. 13 Purdue 31, Northwestern 23; Alabama 35, No. 14 Arkansas 
28; No. 15 Kansas State 35, Iowa State 28; Stanford 42, No. 18 UCLA 
32; Wyoming 10, No. 19 Michigan State 27, Illinois 10; No. 24 Air 
Force 7; and Wake Forest 31, No. 25 North Carolina State 7. 
</P>
<P>
	With Wisconsin's Barry Alvarez coaching from the press box  
because of an ailing right knee that will have to be replaced, the 
Badgers saw their eight-game home winning streak snapped by 
Michigan. 
</P>
<P>
	The Wolverines took a 14-0 lead in the first quarter on Brady's  
8-yard TD pass to Aaron Shea and a 45-yard run off a double-reverse 
by David Terrell. Wisconsin closed to 14-9 at halftime on a 32-yard 
field goal by Vitaly Pisetsky and Dayne's 34-yard TD run in the 
second quarter. 
</P>
<P>
	Michigan made it 21-9 on Brady's 23-yard TD pass to DiAllo  
Johnson in the third quarter. Wisconsin scored on a 13-yard bootleg 
by backup quarterback Brooks Bollinger with 1:29 left in the game 
and then tried an onside kick, but Michigan recovered and ran out 
the clock. 
</P>
<P>
                 *No. 1 Florida St. 42, North Carolina 10    	
</P>
<P>
	At Chapel Hill, N.C., Florida State scored four touchdowns in  
the first seven minutes and the Seminoles (4-0, 3-0 ACC) made life 
miserable for North Carolina quarterback Ronald Curry. 
</P>
<P>
	Curry, who was recruited by Florida State, had three passes  
intercepted, fumbled once and was sacked five times. North Carolina 
(1-2, 0-2) has lost its first two ACC games for the first time in a 
decade. 
</P>
<P>
                    *No. 2 Penn State 45, Indiana 24    	
</P>
<P>
	At State College, Pa., Rashard Casey completed 13 of 15 passes  
for 196 yards and two touchdowns, and ran for 66 yards and a 
spectacular touchdown to lead Penn State over Indiana. 
</P>
<P>
	Rashard, the No. 2 man in Penn State's quarterback platoon, was  
on the field for all five of the team's offensive scores as the 
Nittany Lions (5-0, 1-0 Big Ten) beat Indiana (1-3, 0-1) for the 
fifth straight time. 
</P>
<P>
                   *No. 5 Texas A&AMP;M 23, Southern Miss 6    	
</P>
<P>
	At College Station, Texas, Jay Brooks and Michael Jameson  
returned interceptions for touchdowns in the second half and 
Terence Kitchens kicked three field goals, including one from 62 
yards. 
</P>
<P>
	Brooks' 41-yard return for a score midway through the third  
period gave the Aggies (3-0) a 16-0 lead. Southern Miss (2-2) 
scored the only offensive touchdown of the game, a 54-yard pass 
play from Cable Davis to Todd Pinkston, on the second play of the 
fourth quarter. 
</P>
<P>
                    *No. 7 Tennessee 17, Memphis 16    	
</P>
<P>
	At Knoxville, Tenn., Tee Martin hit Cedrick Wilson with a  
15-yard touchdown pass with a minute left to give Tennessee (2-1) a 
victory over Memphis (1-3). 
</P>
<P>
	Tennessee, trying to avoid a repeat of the Tigers' 1996 upset of  
the Vols in Memphis, had to mount a 78-yard drive to pull out the 
victory. It was the first meeting between the teams since that game 
three years ago. 
</P>
<P>
                 *No. 11 Georgia 24, Central Florida 23    	
</P>
<P>
	At Athens, Ga., Georgia (3-0) escaped with a win after 28-point  
underdog Central Florida missed an extra point with 5:21 left. 
</P>
<P>
	Javier Beorlegui missed the PAT after a touchdown pass from Vic  
Penn to Page Sessoms. The Golden Knights (0-4) still had a chance 
to pull off the upset after driving to the Georgia 20 in the final 
minute. But two costly penalties, including a questionable 
offensive pass interference call, knocked Central Florida out of 
field-goal range. 
</P>
<P>
                   *No. 12 Ohio St. 34, Cincinnati 20    	
</P>
<P>
	At Columbus, Ohio, Ken-Yon Rambo caught two long passes from  
Steve Bellisari -- one for a 59-yard touchdown and another to set up 
a score -- as Ohio State rallied to beat Cincinnati. 
</P>
<P>
	In the first meeting of the teams in 68 years, the Bearcats  
(2-2) played as if last week's 17-12 upset of then-No. 9 Wisconsin 
was no fluke. They built a 17-3 second-quarter lead before Ohio 
State (3-1) scored 31 straight. 
</P>
<P>
                   *No. 13 Purdue 31, Northwestern 23    	
</P>
<P>
	At West Lafayette, Ind., Drew Brees' 99-yard TD pass to Vinny  
Sutherland with 6:20 left gave Purdue a victory over Northwestern. 
</P>
<P>
	Purdue (4-0, 1-0 Big Ten) was protecting a 24-23 lead when  
Sutherland got behind the defense on a third-down play, caught the 
ball near his own 40 and outraced two defenders to the end zone for 
the longest play in school history. 
</P>
<P>
                    *Alabama 35, No. 14 Arkansas 28    	
</P>
<P>
	At Tuscaloosa, Ala., Freddie Milons caught a touchdown pass and  
threw another for Alabama, which overcame six turnovers to beat 
Arkansas. 
</P>
<P>
	Alabama (3-1, 2-0 SEC) snapped a two-game losing streak against  
Arkansas (2-1, 0-1). The Crimson Tide played a sloppy game -- 
Arkansas scored 25 points off turnovers -- but made the big plays 
when needed. 
</P>
<P>
                    *No. 15 Kansas St. 35, Iowa St. 28    	
</P>
<P>
	At Ames, Iowa, David Allen returned a punt 94 yards for a  
touchdown and quarterback Adam Helm scored on a 1-yard run with 
2:34 left as Kansas State (3-0, 1-0 Big 12) overcame a 19-point 
halftime deficit against Iowa State (3-1, 0-1). 
</P>
<P>
	It was Kansas State's biggest comeback in coach Bill Snyder's 11  
seasons. The Wildcats also avoided their first loss to an unranked 
team in the regular season since a 27-23 setback to Iowa State in 
1993. 
</P>
<P>
                      *Stanford 42, No. 18 UCLA 32    	
</P>
<P>
	At Stanford, Calif., backup QB Joe Borchard threw five TD  
passes, including a Pac-10 record 98-yarder to Troy Walters, as 
Stanford (3-1) held off UCLA (2-2). 
</P>
<P>
	Walters, who also caught scoring passes of 30 and 18 yards, had  
nine receptions for 278 yards -- a Stanford record for receiving 
yardage in a game. Borchard was 15-of-19 for 324 yards after 
relieving the injured Todd Husak in the second quarter. 
</P>
<P>
                  *No. 19 Michigan St. 27, Illinois 10    	
</P>
<P>
	At Champaign, Ill., Lloyd Clemons rushed for 141 yards, T.J.  
Duckett ran for two touchdowns and Ivory McCoy had a 22-yard TD 
reception as Michigan State defeated Illinois in a Big Ten opener. 
</P>
<P>
	Michigan State improved to 4-0 for the first time since 1966.  
It's the Spartans' fifth straight victory over the Illini (3-1), 
the longest Michigan State winning streak in the series. 
</P>
<P>
                     *Wyoming 10, No. 24 Air Force 7    	
</P>
<P>
	At Air Force Academy, Colo., Jay Stoner threw a 60-yard TD pass  
to Kofi Shuck as Wyoming snapped the Falcons' 11-game winning 
streak, the longest in Division I-A. 
</P>
<P>
	Wyoming (2-1, 1-0 Mountain West) avenged frustrating losses to  
Air Force (2-1, 0-1) the past two seasons, including last year's 
10-3 defeat that foiled the Cowboys' bid for a conference title and 
bowl berth. 
</P>
<P>
                    *Wake Forest 31, No. 25 NC State 7    	
</P>
<P>
	At Winston-Salem, N.C., Morgan Kane rushed for 147 yards and  
three touchdowns as Wake Forest upset North Carolina State. 
</P>
<P>
	The Demon Deacons (2-1, 1-1 ACC) forced two turnovers and  
converted them into 14 points. Kelvin Jones led Wake Forest's 
defensive effort by recovering two fumbles, both of which produced 
touchdowns, and getting one of Wake's three sacks. The Deacons 
defeated the Wolfpack (3-2, 0-2) for just the second time in 12 
games.

<HEADLINE> IMF Says Ecuador Could Get Aid </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Ecuador could obtain ``substantial amounts of  
financing'' from the International Monetary Fund if the country 
moves to resolve its financial problems and seeks the support of 
its creditors, a senior IMF official said Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
	But there appear to be disagreements between Ecuador's  
president, Jamil Mahuad, and his economy minister over what course 
to follow, an aide to Mahaud said. 
</P>
<P>
	The IMF's deputy managing director, Stanley Fischer said,  
``We're looking for a serious investment program by Ecuador that 
would ensure that domestic policies contribute what they should to 
resolving the country's problems.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``And we are looking for Ecuador to seek to solve its financing  
problems in a cooperative way, in direct discussions with its 
creditors,'' he added. 
</P>
<P>
	``We don't know precisely what this involves ... but it should  
be broad in scale and not just involve one class of creditor.'' 
Fischer spoke at a seminar held in conjunction with the annual 
meetings of the IMF and the World Bank. 
</P>
<P>
	In Quito, Ecuador's capital, Mahuad said Saturday no decision  
has been made on whether the country will default on $96 million in 
payments due this week. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have to think about and analyze the consequences ... of the  
possible actions we can take,'' Mahuad said in a national radio 
address. 
</P>
<P>
	He commented amid published reports that Economy Minister  
Guillermo Lasso had resigned because of policy disagreements with 
Mahuad, including whether to default on the bonds. 
</P>
<P>
	A spokesman for Mahuad, who asked not to be identified, said he  
could not confirm the resignation but added that ``it seems 
disagreements do exist between Mahuad and Lasso. 
</P>
<P>
	Lasso was not available for comment.  
</P>
<P>
	Ecuador has struggled with what Mahuad has called the country's  
``worst economic crisis in 70 years.'' IMF officials have been 
involved in discussions with Ecuador on a proposed $400 million 
loan to help the country restructure its banking system. 
</P>
<P>
	Last month, Ecuador failed to make payments on Brady bonds  
totaling $96 million. It has until this week to make the payment or 
officially be in default. 
</P>
<P>
	Ecuador has said it will present proposals soon to restructure  
its entire Brady bond debt of $6 billion. The bonds, named after 
former U.S. Treasury Secretary Nicholas Brady, were created to 
resolve the Latin American debt crisis of the 1980s. They are 
partly backed by U.S. Treasury securities. 
</P>
<P>
	Ecuador faces about $500 million in external debt obligations  
for the remainder of the year on top of the $96 million in Brady 
debt due to be repaid this week.

<HEADLINE> Unearthed Coffins Collected in N.C. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TARBORO, N.C. (AP) -- The ugly aftermath of Hurricane Floyd is  
beginning to become more visible as floodwaters slowly recede in 
eastern North Carolina. 
</P>
<P>
	Searches for the missing continue in areas still submerged, and  
a team of funeral home directors was preparing to begin today the 
grim task of identifying as many as 100 coffins unearthed by the 
flood. 
</P>
<P>
	``Nobody's laid eyes on the main streets of Princeville for  
eight days, and we have other areas like that,'' Richard Moore, the 
state's public safety secretary, said Friday. ``It's going to be 
catastrophic in some places.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Search crews used dogs trained to detect bodies to look for  
victims of the floodwaters that swallowed Princeville, a town of 
1,900 across the Tar River from Tarboro, a week ago. 
</P>
<P>
	At least 42 deaths have been blamed on Hurricane Floyd in  
eastern North Carolina alone, and the numbers could rise as 
floodwaters recede. 
</P>
<P>
	Emergency officials do not have a list of the missing, and they  
urged anyone who might have left after the floods to contact family 
or neighbors in order to account for all the residents. 
</P>
<P>
	Coast Guard crews, meanwhile, snagged floating coffins that had  
come popping up from a cemetery in Princeville. Too heavy to pull 
onto boats, the caskets were either towed to shore or tied to trees 
as the crews recorded their locations. All appeared to be sealed. 
</P>
<P>
	Manufacturers' numbers on the caskets can be traced to funeral  
homes and ultimately the families who bought them, but the bodies 
still must be identified and the coffins repaired before they are 
reburied, said Buddy Bell, a mortuary liaison officer for the U.S. 
Public Health Service. 
</P>
<P>
	Identifying the bodies could be as simple as a relative  
describing the clothing the person was buried in or it could 
require the use of dental records, officials said. Family members 
won't be asked to make visual identifications. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have to be able to positively identify the person and  
assure the family they are getting their loved ones back,'' Bell 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Twenty-nine emergency shelters remained open in the state,  
housing 2,790 people, and 400 roads were still closed. The number 
of homes and businesses without electricity fell below 7,800, down 
from the peak of 1.2 million. 
</P>
<P>
	State officials say it could be at least two weeks before  
classes resume in all the school districts affected by the 
flooding. Eleven districts with about 176,000 students remained 
closed. 
</P>
<P>
	Despite the gloom, strain and stench brought by the flood, many  
people were glad to get back to their homes and businesses. 
</P>
<P>
	In downtown Tarboro, Rex Browning, 66, remained upbeat as he  
cleaned up his jewelry store five blocks from the river. The 
paneling was wilted 4 feet up the wall, marking the floodwaters' 
high point. 
</P>
<P>
	``I started here 42 years ago with nothing, so I guess I have  
more than that now,'' Browning said as he examined broken watches.

<HEADLINE>  Gore, Bradley Face 'Real Contest' </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Al Gore and Bill Bradley squared off Saturday  
for the first time, previewing a ``real contest with real choices'' 
between the sitting vice president and his surging challenger 
seeking the Democratic presidential nomination in 2000. 
</P>
<P>
	Addressing powerful Democrats from across the country, Gore  
promised to ``work my heart out'' for their support. Bradley urged 
them to embrace -- not shirk from -- a fight for the party's 
nomination. 
</P>
<P>
	``What better way to energize voters ... than a contest that  
brings two people together for a spirited debates of ideas -- a real 
contest with real choices decided by voters in caucuses and 
primaries throughout this nation,'' Bradley told the Democratic 
National Committee. 
</P>
<P>
	Gore walked from behind the lectern to wander the stage.  
Unusually informal and emotional, he energized the crowd with 
criticism of Republican front-runner George W. Bush. 
</P>
<P>
	Attacking Bush's pro-gun views, the vice president asked of  
Bush, ``Why don't you join us to take the weapons of evil out of 
the hands of evildoers?'' 
</P>
<P>
	In back-to-back speeches, neither candidate mentioned the other  
by name, though they slipped in subtle digs. It marked the first 
time the two foes made a joint appearance to court the same crowd, 
both campaigns said. 
</P>
<P>
	The 428 DNC members, most of whom are allies of Gore and  
President Clinton, cast votes at the Democratic presidential 
convention. 
</P>
<P>
	Though he is the party's front-runner, Gore had the biggest need  
for a solid speech. Even in the DNC's bastion of Gore allies, the 
perception is taking hold that his campaign is lackluster and 
suffering from ties to Clinton's scandal-plagued presidency. 
</P>
<P>
	Gore did not mention Clinton in his remarks.  
</P>
<P>
	In hallway and barroom conversations, the activists talked about  
new polls in New Hampshire showing Bradley in a dead heat with 
Gore. Independents and moderate Democrats are especially drawn to 
the former New Jersey senator in that first-in-the-nation primary 
state and in neighboring New York. 
</P>
<P>
	Gore holds big leads elsewhere.  
</P>
<P>
	``I'm telling people this is a long process and he's committed  
to working for America's families. We're solid in Iowa. We're solid 
in California,'' Gore campaign chairman Tony Coelho said. 
</P>
<P>
	Bradley hoped to continue mending relations with some hardcore  
Democrats who recall that he left the Senate in 1996 after calling 
the political system -- and, by implication, his party -- ``broken.'' 
</P>
<P>
	With an understated delivery, Bradley tried to spell out why  
Democrats should consider rejecting Gore and giving him a serious 
look. He gave the Clinton administration credit for improving race 
relations and the economy, but he said more needed to be done on 
those and other issues. 
</P>
<P>
	``We've accomplished so much,'' he said in an implicit  
recognition of the Clinton-Gore successes, but, ``What else is 
there to do?'' 
</P>
<P>
	Gun control, poverty, health care and campaign finance reform  
were among the topics he promised to champion, eventually drawing 
contrasts with Gore. He spent little or no time on other issues 
critical to the Democratic base -- abortion, Medicare and Social 
Security. Gore talked about all three. 
</P>
<P>
	In the end, perhaps recognizing the audience was stacked in  
Gore's favor, Bradley struck a civil tone. ``I want you to know 
that whether you are for me or against me that we share that same 
goal of mutual respect,'' Bradley said. 
</P>
<P>
	Gore, accused of being too stiff for presidential politics, used  
his hands for emphasis. He echoed Bradley's call for gun control 
but focused more on family and education issues. 
</P>
<P>
	He, too, offered veiled criticism of his challenger. ``I have  
never been for (school) vouchers,'' Gore said, recognizing that 
most of the activists know that Bradley once supported limited 
programs. 
</P>
<P>
	Gore's campaign clearly wants to make the case that Bradley  
abandoned the party in 1996 and Gore is the race's true Democrat. 
The vice president's supporters wore buttons that read, ``ALways a 
Democrat'' -- with ``AL'' in blue letters and the rest in red. 
</P>
<P>
	The flashy, expensive Gore campaign and ploddingly efficient  
Bradley campaigns showed their stuff. 
</P>
<P>
	Bradley made a non-descript entry to the room, spoke with  
reading glasses perched atop his nose and waded through the crowd 
afterward. Gore sped through the crowd, flanked by Secret Service 
agents, with rock music blaring throughout the hall. 
</P>
<P>
	They were interrupted by applause in roughly the same numbers.  
Afterward, activists said both performed well but not great. 
</P>
<P>
	Both campaigns played their share of backroom games. The Bradley  
team e-mailed supporters urging them to attend the meeting. The 
work paid off with crowds of mostly young, sign-toting supporters 
that nearly rivaled the impressive showing produced by Gore's team. 
</P>
<P>
	Gore, who had been scheduled to speak before Bradley, abruptly  
sought and secured the final speaking slot -- making his the last 
impression left with activists. Gore deployed more staff and spent 
more time at the three-day meeting than Bradley.

<HEADLINE> Md. Gas Companies Plan Ad Blitz </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BALTIMORE (AP) -- Energy companies are preparing marketing  
campaigns to woo potential customers when deregulation begins to 
take effect and customers are able to choose their supplier of 
natural gas. 
</P>
<P>
	In November, about 535,000 residential customers in central  
Maryland will be free to choose their natural gas supplier, 
according to Mike Delaney, spokesman for Constellation Energy 
Group, parent company of BGE and BGE Home. 
</P>
<P>
	By next summer, another 1.1 million residents will be able to  
choose an electric supplier. 
</P>
<P>
	Independent power companies are designing elaborate marketing  
campaigns to corner a share of Constellation's $3.4 billion market. 
Baltimore Gas and Electric Co., meanwhile, which has held a 
monopoly for more than a century, has to figure out how to sell its 
product. 
</P>
<P>
	``For many of these firms, it's learning the basics of how do  
you sell,'' said Seth Dunbar, spokesman for the Advertising 
Association of Baltimore. ``The electrics have to go through 
marketing 101.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``You have to educate your salespeople, and you need to  
establish marketing budgets where there weren't marketing 
budgets,'' he said. ``These guys have never had to do that before, 
which is the biggest challenge.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The sate is starting a public education campaign in January to  
help consumers understand what deregulation means. But that may be 
too late for natural gas consumers. 
</P>
<P>
	About 18 utility companies already are starting media campaigns,  
with some buying up print, radio and television spots and 
billboards. Some are going door-to-door to sign up customers before 
Nov. 1. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are competing with ... gas markets from as far away as the  
Mid-West,'' said Stephen Mormann, vice president, business 
development for BGE Home, central Maryland's current supplier of 
natural gas. ``We are running a very comprehensive campaign. We are 
using every sales channel we can that touches our customer base.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Marketing natural gas is not unlike starting a new product.  
Consumers have to know what it is and then why they should buy it 
from a given supplier. 
</P>
<P>
	``We know far more about buying a car than we do about  
electricity,'' Dunbar said. ``We know more about buying Internet 
service than we do about buying electricity. And that's a 
$200-a-year investment vs. a $2,000-a-year investment.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Public Service Commission is scheduled next month to approve  
the terms of the electric deregulation settlement. 
</P>
<P>
	Unlike electricity, there are no rules surrounding natural gas  
marketing. 
</P>
<P>
	``Gas has gone right along and hasn't jumped through all the  
hoops of legislation,'' said Delaney. Gas and electric ``have not 
taken parallel paths. People are just discovering that they can 
shop around.''

<HEADLINE> Indians 9, Blue Jays 6  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TORONTO (AP) -- Manny Ramirez drove in two runs to reach 159  
RBIs, the most in the major leagues in 50 years, as the Cleveland 
Indians beat the Toronto Blue Jays 9-6 Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
	A day after driving in a career-high eight, Ramirez hit a  
two-run double down the left-field line in the first inning to give 
him the most RBIs since Ted Williams and Vern Stephens had 159 in 
1949. 
</P>
<P>
	Bartolo Colon (17-5), who has won seven of his last eight  
decisions, allowed four runs, three earned, on six hits in six 
innings. Mike Jackson pitched the ninth for his 38th save in 42 
opportunities. 
</P>
<P>
	Ramirez's double, and Travis Fryman's two-run double gave the  
Indians an 4-0 lead after the first. 
</P>
<P>
	Cleveland's Einar Diaz scored on a run-scoring wild pitch in the  
second. The Indians added two more in the third on shortstop Tony 
Batista's throwing error, and on Kenny Lofton's RBI single. 
</P>
<P>
	David Justice hit his 21st homer, a solo shot in the fifth, to  
make it 8-2. 
</P>
<P>
	Wil Cordero's RBI double in the sixth made it 9-2.  
</P>
<P>
	Paul Spoljaric (2-1), making his first start in the AL this  
year, gave up nine runs, seven earned, in 5 2-3 innings. 
</P>
<P>
	The Blue Jays, who have lost seven straight at home, cut it to  
9-4 in the sixth on Shawn Green's RBI double and Darrin Fletcher's 
run-scoring single. 
</P>
<P>
	Jose Cruz Jr.'s RBI double and Brian McRae's pinch-hit  
run-scoring single in the seventh made it 9-6. 
</P>
<P>
 *Notes:* Ramirez's 159 RBIs left him three short of the club record  
set by Hal Trosky in 1936. He went 1-for-4 on Saturday. ... Colon 
struck out two and walked three. ... Third baseman Casey Blake 
replaced Tony Fernandez in the third inning after Fernandez hurt 
himself sliding into third. ... The Indians have scored a major 
league-leading 974 runs this season.

<HEADLINE> Bauer Welcomes Buchanan Departure </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ST. LOUIS (AP) -- Republican presidential candidate Gary Bauer  
said Saturday he would be the obvious beneficiary should Pat 
Buchanan leave the GOP to run under the Reform Party banner. 
</P>
<P>
	But Bauer, who spoke at the annual meeting of the conservative  
Eagle Forum, urged Buchanan not to leave because the party needs 
``every conservative we can get to stay in.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't believe the majority of people will leave with him,''  
Bauer said. ``I think most of them will stay in the party, and I'm 
the natural person to support. If he leaves, there's still going to 
be a Republican primary held. Those people are going to do 
something on that primary day, and I think there's a chance they'll 
vote for me.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Bauer said he, like Buchanan, has been frustrated with his party  
during the last two elections, sometimes ``running out of shoes to 
throw at the television.'' 
</P>
<P>
	During his speech, he took several shots at Texas Gov. George W.  
Bush, criticizing the Republican front-runner for supporting 
favored trade status with China and not requiring that all judicial 
appointees oppose abortion rights. 
</P>
<P>
	``Our front-runner is looking more and more like the likely  
nominee of the Democratic Party, Al Gore,'' Bauer said. 
</P>
<P>
	Bauer said he would remain a Republican even if he fails in his  
quest for the nomination. But he refused to speculate as to whether 
he would support Buchanan's Reform Party candidacy instead of Bush 
should that happen. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm not going to go there,'' Bauer said. ``I expect to be the  
nominee, and I just hope George W. Bush doesn't walk out and form a 
moderate third party when I get the nomination.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Bauer's policy initiatives struck a chord with the audience at  
the Eagle Forum's 28th annual meeting. The group was also to hear 
from independent candidate Bob Smith and Republican Steve Forbes 
via satellite.

<HEADLINE> German Wins 154-Mile Ultramarathon </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SPARTA, Greece (AP) -- Jens Lukas of Germany was the surprise  
winner Saturday of the 154-mile run from Athens to Sparta. 
</P>
<P>
	Lukas, battling the heat and exhaustion, completed the  
round-the-clock journey in 25 hours, 38 minutes and 3 seconds. 
</P>
<P>
	``I tried to keep my tempo low in the day and run fast at  
night,'' said the 33-year-old Lukas after being crowned with an 
olive wreath -- the prize for every runner who finished. 
</P>
<P>
	``People were exhausted with the heat during the day ... I don't  
look at the kilometers, just pieces of the road.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Lukas finished 90 minutes in front of the second runner,  
Frenchman Jean Pierre Guyomarch. Japan's Jun Onoki was third, 
finishing in 27:16.36. 
</P>
<P>
	Organizers said only 54 of the 190 runners taking part completed  
the course, the last athlete finishing four seconds before the race 
deadline at nightfall Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
	Only two of the 12 women reached Sparta. France's Anny Monot  
finished in 35:38.08, three minutes in front of Kimie Funada of 
Japan. 
</P>
<P>
	The runners followed a route that tradition says was taken  
nearly 2,500 years ago by Pheidippides, a messenger on a mission to 
get Sparta to help Athens fend off a Persian invasion. The route 
was plotted by a group of British air force officers in 1982, 
following the writings of the ancient historian Herodotus, and has 
been run as a race each year since. 
</P>
<P>
	Many of the Spartathlon favorites dropped out in the early  
stages due to the heat or during an exhausting mountain run at 
night.

<HEADLINE> Bulls GM Defends Rebuilding Effort </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	VANCOUVER, British Columbia (AP) -- Jerry Krause knows everyone  
around the NBA is watching him, whispering that his secret plan for 
rebuilding the Chicago Bulls might be fundamentally flawed. 
</P>
<P>
	Fifteen months after the team's sixth championship, eight months  
after the retirement of Michael Jordan and the dismantling of 
Chicago's dynasty, Krause's Bulls are a bad team that can expect to 
remain wretched for at least another year, probably more. 
</P>
<P>
	Is he nervous? Yes. Will he panic? No.  
</P>
<P>
	``I know people are saying: `The Sleuth' must have something up  
his sleeve.' But they give me too much credit,'' Krause said. 
``We're just taking it slow. 
</P>
<P>
	``Everybody has to do things his own way, and I'm taking it  
little by little.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Krause didn't play his hand this summer, hoarding his salary cap  
space, opting not to make a draft night trade and adding three 
aging veterans -- Will Perdue, Hersey Hawkins and B.J. Armstrong -- 
instead of one of the young studs, such as Toronto's Tracy McGrady, 
he coveted. 
</P>
<P>
	Vin Baker might have helped, and was available on the free agent  
market. Same with Penny Hardaway, Mitch Richmond, Jermaine O'Neal, 
Gary Trent, Corliss Williamson, Lorenzen Wright and Shandon 
Anderson, but Krause passed on all of them. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was a question of whether the players who were available in  
this market or in trades were going to fit into our plans down the 
line,'' Krause said. ``We felt that the players who were out there 
wouldn't. Once you spend the money, it's gone.'' 
</P>
<P>
	It was a finicky approach that was surprising in a league that  
has quickly discovered how the new collective bargaining agreement 
doesn't favor teams with salary cap space quite as much as it used 
to. 
</P>
<P>
	With its limit on high-end salaries, the labor agreement  
prevents the Bulls from simply outbidding someone else. And the 
league's youngest players, their earning ability restricted, have 
overwhelmingly been opting to take the safe route and re-sign with 
their current teams. Examples last season included Allen Iverson, 
Stephon Marbury, Shareef Abdur-Rahim, Ray Allen, Marcus Camby, 
Antoine Walker, Kerry Kittles and Kobe Bryant. 
</P>
<P>
	Krause stands poised to be a major player on the free agent  
market next summer, when Tim Duncan and Grant Hill could be 
available, and he'll have five draft picks among the top 40. 
</P>
<P>
	But the Orlando Magic also will have some $16-18 million in  
salary cap space, as well as a recruiting edge that could make all 
the difference. 
</P>
<P>
	``Now, in this league, the money is the same,'' Orlando coach  
Doc Rivers said. ``So the only reason a guy might want to leave is 
so he can play in a better city. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're a city that people want to move to. Tiger Woods, Ken  
Griffey Jr. and Shaquille O'Neal live there. There's no state 
income tax, there's great weather, great golf. Players know that if 
they come play for us, they're coming to a better place.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Players also know that if they sign in Chicago, they'll be going  
to a team with a history of acrimonious relationships with its best 
players. 
</P>
<P>
	Krause also had the overall No. 1 draft choice last June, and  
after weeks of fielding offers he decided to retain the pick and 
selected Elton Brand of Duke, a player he expects to be manning the 
power forward spot in Chicago for the next 10-12 years. 
</P>
<P>
	It was the safe choice, but it gave the Bulls only one player  
when they could have come up with two or three. 
</P>
<P>
	Again, some thought it was too conservative a strategy given  
Chicago's many needs. But Krause insists it was the right one. 
</P>
<P>
	``It took us a long while to build a championship team, and if  
we hadn't done it that way we'd have never won,'' he said at the 
NBA's league meetings. ``There's no set way to do this, and it 
won't happen overnight.'' 
</P>
<P>
	No amount of prodding can get Krause to reveal his timetable for  
making the Bulls respectable again, and a deep dip in the 
popularity of his team won't force him to make what might be the 
wrong move. 
</P>
<P>
	``I won't make predictions,'' he said. ``I'm not smart enough.  
The real rock-solid Chicago Bulls fans, the ones who were there 
pre-Michael and early-Michael, they support us in what we're 
doing.''

<HEADLINE> IMF, World Bank Talks Get Started </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The global economy seems a much calmer place  
compared with a year ago, when a prolonged currency crisis in Asia 
and a collapsing Russian ruble roiled financial markets worldwide. 
</P>
<P>
	But that does not mean finance officials will not have a lot to  
discuss as they gather for the annual meetings of the 182-nation 
International Monetary Fund and its sister lending organization, 
the World Bank. 
</P>
<P>
	A sharp decline in the value of the U.S. dollar against the  
Japanese yen, allegations of widespread money laundering in Russia 
and a crushing burden of debt being carried by the world's poorest 
countries are expected to be top agenda items this year. 
</P>
<P>
	The discussions were getting under way today with talks among  
the finance ministers and central bank presidents of the world's 
seven largest economies -- the United States, Japan, Germany, 
France, Britain, Italy and Canada. 
</P>
<P>
	Before the G-7 talks began, Treasury Secretary Lawrence Summers  
and Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan met with Japanese 
Finance Minister Kiichi Miyazawa and Masaru Hayami, head of the 
Bank of Japan. 
</P>
<P>
	Afterwards, Treasury spokeswoman Michelle Smith described the  
one-hour meeting as a ``very good and full discussion of the range 
of issues on the agenda.'' 
</P>
<P>
	She refused to elaborate on positions taken by either country.  
But before the talks, Summers had made it clear U.S. officials 
would raise concerns that even though Japan's economy has finally 
begun to show signs of emerging from its worst recession in 50 
years, the Japanese must continue to push stimulative policies to 
keep the fledgling recovery on track. 
</P>
<P>
	With the prospects for the global economy looking better than  
the darkest days of the currency crisis, finance officials said it 
would be important to keep pressing ahead with various ideas to 
reform the world's financial architecture, primarily by putting in 
place tougher standards in such areas as banking and release of 
timely economic data. 
</P>
<P>
	``There is a unanimous view that there is no time for  
complacency,'' Canadian Finance Minister Paul Martin told reporters 
today. 
</P>
<P>
	Summers was making his maiden appearance as the Clinton  
administration's top economic spokesman at these gatherings, 
although he attended many previous G-7 sessions as top deputy to 
his predecessor, Robert Rubin. 
</P>
<P>
	In a pre-meeting briefing, Summers told reporters that the  
United States continues to believe that the proper policy response 
to keeping the dollar in proper relation to the yen was for the 
United States and Japan to focus on getting their underlying 
economic fundamentals correct, rather than resorting to government 
intervention in currency markets. 
</P>
<P>
	``A continued Japanese commitment to continued stimulus, using  
all available tools, will be critical until a solid, 
self-sustaining recovery led by domestic demand is firmly 
entrenched,'' Summers said. 
</P>
<P>
	Japan had hoped for more support on the side of currency  
intervention, fearing that without efforts to prop up the dollar, 
Japanese exporters could suffer competitively in global markets. 
</P>
<P>
	But Summers contends Japan needs to worry more about boosting  
demand at home rather than relying on exports to lift it out of its 
worst recession in 50 years. 
</P>
<P>
	The G-7 countries were likely to have more agreement on debt  
relief. The administration asked Congress this week for nearly $1 
billion to support the U.S. share of a plan to provide up to $90 
billion in debt relief for the world's 41 poorest nations in coming 
years. 
</P>
<P>
	One sticking point has been how the IMF would finance its share  
of this effort. Summers and IMF Managing Director Michel Camdessus 
have indicated that agreement is close on a proposal to allow the 
IMF to revalue 14 million ounces of its gold reserves at world 
prices, freeing up money for the debt effort. 
</P>
<P>
	Russian officials will join the G-7 group at the end of the  
discussions and are certain to face questions about unfolding 
investigations into allegations that Russian mobsters laundered 
money through Western banks. 
</P>
<P>
	The IMF, however, has indicated that its checking has uncovered  
no evidence that IMF funds were misused and Camdessus told 
reporters Thursday that the Russian government is exceeding IMF 
guidelines for economic performance and will likely receive the 
next installment of a $4.5 billion loan program in October. 
</P>
<P>
	Today's G-7 discussions will be followed with meetings Sunday  
through Thursday of the IMF and World Bank. One of the topics will 
be continued reforms of the two institutions so they will be able 
to better cope with future Asian-style currency crises. 
</P>
<P>
	Among the items to be considered are requirements for greater  
transparency by the international lending institutions, so 
investors aren't caught by surprise, and codes of good practice for 
nations in such areas as banking.

<HEADLINE> Engine Problems Delay Forbes </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ANAHEIM, Calif. (AP) -- GOP presidential candidate Steve Forbes,  
flying to Southern California for the state Republican convention, 
was forced to land in Las Vegas because of engine trouble, aides 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Forbes was en route from Washington to Anaheim late Friday  
aboard a twin-engine Westwind jet when the problem occurred, said 
John Herrington, the chairman of Forbes' California campaign. 
</P>
<P>
	The jet landed without incident, he said. It wasn't clear  
whether Forbes got onto another plane or whether mechanics fixed 
the Westwind, but he arrived in California about three hours late. 
</P>
<P>
	Forbes was heading to the marquee event of the convention, a  
swing dance party in his honor. 
</P>
<P>
	As the crowd of hundreds of Republicans waited for him, a woman  
was wheeled out on a stretcher. She broke her leg while dancing 
with her husband, said Matt Cunningham, a Forbes spokesman. 
</P>
<P>
	``Other than that, it was a great event,'' Cunningham said of  
the injury and the delay.

<HEADLINE> Teen Gunman Could Walk Free </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	EUGENE, Ore. (AP) -- Teen-aged gunman Kip Kinkel, who killed his  
parents and gunned down two classmates at school, could be set free 
from prison by age 42 under a plea deal reached with prosecutors. 
</P>
<P>
	Kinkel on Friday dropped an insanity defense and pleaded guilty  
to four counts of murder and 26 counts of attempted murder. 
</P>
<P>
	``My mind is clear and I am not sick,'' read the text of the  
plea agreement signed by the 17-year-old Kinkel. He sat slumped in 
a chair in court and never lifted his head as he read each 
paragraph silently and initialed it ``KK.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Kinkel was to go to trial Monday for the May 21, 1998, attack at  
Springfield's Thurston High School -- one in a string of school 
shootings that include Pearl, Miss., Paducah, Ky., Jonesboro, Ark., 
and Littleton, Colo. 
</P>
<P>
	Under the agreement, he will get a total of 25 years for the  
murders. Prosecutors have recommended 7 1/2 years for each attempted 
murder count for the 25 students he wounded and a detective he 
attacked with a knife. The judge will decide whether those 
sentences will be tacked onto the end of the 25-year sentence or 
run concurrently. 
</P>
<P>
	If he had been convicted as charged, he could have faced life in  
prison without parole. Because Kinkel was 15 at the time of the 
slayings, he could not have faced the death penalty. 
</P>
<P>
	Lawyers are to meet Monday to set a date for a sentencing  
hearing that could last one to three weeks. 
</P>
<P>
	Defense lawyers had hoped to spare Kinkel a life sentence by  
proving he was mentally disturbed. If they had succeeded, Kinkel 
would have been confined to a mental hospital until he was no 
longer deemed a danger to society. 
</P>
<P>
	District Attorney Doug Harcleroad called the deal ``the best  
thing for the community'' and refused to comment on the possibility 
of a 25-year sentence. He noted that survivors of the attack will 
get a chance to speak before Kinkel is sentenced. 
</P>
<P>
	Among those in court for Friday's proceedings was Teresa  
Miltonburger, who was shot in the head during the rampage. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's going to jail,'' she said. ``It works for me.''  
</P>
<P>
	She had planned to attend every day of the trial, but the guilty  
pleas came as a relief. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is my senior year. This is my year to have fun. I'm glad  
to have it over,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	Kinkel told investigators he had ``no choice'' but to kill  
because he had embarrassed his parents by getting expelled for 
having a gun in his locker. He said he thought he was a 
disappointment to his parents. 
</P>
<P>
	``I had to be 100 percent,'' Kinkel told a psychologist. ``No  
one is perfect though. Lots of times, life sucked. With my parents, 
if I didn't do the best, I was an embarrassment to my parents.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Kinkel shot his parents in their home. The following morning, he  
dressed in a trench coat, walked into the cafeteria just before 
classes and opened fire with a semiautomatic rifle. He squeezed off 
50 rounds in 90 seconds, killing Ben Walker, 16, and Mikael 
Nickolauson, 17. 
</P>
<P>
	Several classmates tackled Kinkel as he tried to reload. Later,  
in a jail interview room, Kinkel lunged at a detective with a knife 
that had been taped to his leg and begged police to kill him. 
</P>
<P>
	In a statement released Friday by her lawyer, Kinkel's sister,  
Kristin, 22, said she hoped the plea agreement will mean her 
brother will get the help he needs. 
</P>
<P>
	``I am very sad, but relieved,'' the statement said. ``Sad that  
this day had to even happen. Sad that there are so many innocent 
victims. Sad that I lost another member of my family. But relieved 
that the painful memories of those tragic events of 16 months ago 
will not be revived by a trial.''

<TEXT>
<P>
	SAN SEBASTIAN, Spain (AP) -- Anjelica Huston was relaxed and  
animated as she talked about two key people in her film career: her 
father, the late director John Huston, and her former lover, actor 
Jack Nicholson. 
</P>
<P>
	The actress was here Friday to receive the San Sebastian Film  
Festival's Donostia award for her contribution to film. She shares 
the prize with Vanessa Redgrave and Spanish actor and director 
Fernando Fernan Gomez-Gomez. 
</P>
<P>
	Huston said she learned the most from her father.  
</P>
<P>
	``For the first twelve years of my life I lived in Ireland and I  
was raised exclusively on his films. Obviously he was my first 
teacher,'' said Huston. 
</P>
<P>
	She won an Oscar for best supporting actress for her role in  
``Prizzi's Honor,'' which also starred Nicholson. Huston and 
Nicholson had broken up by the time they starred together in 1995's 
``The Crossing Guard.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``In my mind the relationship was unresolved because of outside  
elements, but after doing that film with Jack I felt that noone 
else could have done that film, I don't regret it,'' Huston said.

<HEADLINE> Two Killed in Ohio Mine Collapsed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CLARINGTON, Ohio (AP) -- A week after state inspectors gave a  
mine a passing safety grade, its roof collapsed, killing two miners 
and injuring at least two others who were working 700 feet 
underground. 
</P>
<P>
	The roof fell about 2 p.m. Friday at the Powhatan No. 4 mine in  
southeast Ohio. The Consolidation Coal Co. mine, once one of the 
state's largest, is in the process of being closed. 
</P>
<P>
	The Ohio Division of Mines and Reclamation inspected the mine  
Sept. 14-16 and deemed it safe for workers, said Jim Lynch, 
spokesman for the Ohio Department of Natural Resources, which 
includes the division. 
</P>
<P>
	Another routine inspection was scheduled for Friday, and the  
inspector was en route to the mine when its roof collapsed, Lynch 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're searching through records, but looking through now it  
doesn't appear there were any problems,'' Lynch said. 
</P>
<P>
	Lynch said workers were removing drainage pipes from the mine  
Friday, but he did not believe that caused the collapse. 
</P>
<P>
	Tom Hoffman, a vice president for parent company Consol Energy  
in Pittsburgh, said authorities had not determined what caused the 
collapse, which affected a ``very small portion'' of the mine. 
</P>
<P>
	The two workers killed in the collapse were identified as  
William Florence, 49, and Gerald Eble, 57. 
</P>
<P>
	The Monroe County Sheriff's Department said at least two people  
were injured. A nursing supervisor at Wetzel County Hospital in New 
Martinsville, W.Va., where some of the miners were taken, refused 
to release any information early today. 
</P>
<P>
	In the past, three million tons of coal a year was mined at  
Consolidated Coal. 
</P>
<P>
	Consol stopped mining coal in March, but has had a small crew on  
duty since then to ship the remaining inventory and to close the 
mine. Thirty-four people now work at the mine, which was 
established in 1971. 
</P>
<P>
	Clarington is in southeast Ohio, about 22 miles south of  
Wheeling, W.Va.

<HEADLINE> Ore. Dust Storm Causes Fatal Pileup </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PENDLETON, Ore. (AP) -- A blinding dust storm blowing across a  
desert stretch of Interstate 84 set off three deadly collisions 
between semitrailers and cars Saturday that left six dead and 
injured at least a dozen more. 
</P>
<P>
	At least 50 vehicles were involved in one pileup in the  
eastbound lanes, said Lt. Gregg Hastings, an Oregon State Police 
spokesman. 
</P>
<P>
	The Oregon Department of Transportation said two crashes in the  
westbound lane, each involving semitrailers and passenger vehicles, 
killed one person each. 
</P>
<P>
	At the same location in the eastbound lane, a crash involving  
five semitrailers and 11 vehicles claimed four lives. 
</P>
<P>
	Visibility was reduced to near zero, police said.  
</P>
<P>
	The accidents in the wheat and sagebrush country 175 miles east  
of Portland happened late Saturday morning. 
</P>
<P>
	The highway was closed in both directions, backing up traffic  
for miles and forcing lengthy detours through Walla Walla, Wash. 
The westbound lanes were reopened in the evening. 
</P>
<P>
	Nine people were sent to Good Shepherd Hospital in Hermiston,  
with two admitted, while another three were being treated at St. 
Mary's Hospital in Walla Walla, officials said.

<HEADLINE> North Korea Says U.S. Must Do More </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	UNITED NATIONS (AP) -- Even with the easing of U.S. sanctions  
against North Korea, the United States still has to do more to 
improve relations and end the ``hostile power politics'' it exerts 
on the peninsula, North Korea's foreign minister said Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
	Washington must lift all sanctions and remove all its troops  
from South Korea before there will be true peace and stability, 
Foreign Minister Paek Nam Sun told reporters during a visit to the 
United Nations. 
</P>
<P>
	``We want the United States to respect the sovereign rights of  
my country,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	In a speech to the General Assembly, the foreign minister  
repeated an announcement Friday by North Korea, referred to as the 
Democratic People's Republic of Korea, that it would freeze 
test-launches of its long-range missiles during talks with the 
United States. 
</P>
<P>
	``If the United States stops pursuing its hostile policy against  
the DPRK and moves towards improved relations, we will also respond 
with good faith,'' he said. ``For the present, we will have 
high-level talks for the settlement of pending issues between the 
DPRK and the U.S. in response to the U.S. requests and suspend 
missile launches while the talks are under way.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But he warned Washington against trying to test North Korea's  
offer in any way, saying, ``Such reckless acts will surely be 
inviting our strong self-defense measures, causing catastrophic 
consequences after all.'' 
</P>
<P>
	There has been no official U.S. response to North Korea's  
announcement, which came a week after President Clinton removed 
restrictions on trade, travel and banking. The move was the most 
significant gesture toward the communist North since the 1950-53 
Korean War. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton said he took the steps after Pyongyang agreed during  
U.S.-North Korea talks in Berlin not to test missiles as long as 
dialogue continues on improving ties. 
</P>
<P>
	North Korea rattled nerves in East Asia and the West after  
firing a new Taepodong-I long-range missile over Japan last year. 
It is believed to have a range of more than 930 miles. 
</P>
<P>
	Paek said his country had a right to defend itself against what  
he called the ``hostile power politics of the United States and its 
subordinating forces,'' -- Japan and South Korea. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have no other alternative but to strengthen our national  
defense capabilities only by ourselves though it requires us to 
tighten our belts,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> Detroit Teachers Ratify Contract </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DETROIT (AP) -- Teachers in the city school district have  
ratified a three-year contract nearly a month after a strike 
delayed the start of the school year and derailed plans to reform 
the city's struggling schools. 
</P>
<P>
	Union members Friday voted 6,328 to 2,058 to accept the  
contract, which gives all teachers a 2 percent raise each year for 
the next three years, a union representative said. Teachers with 
more seniority and education will receive higher raises to keep up 
with wages in suburban districts. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm satisfied. I'm encouraged by the vote and the margin of  
the yes and no,'' union President John Elliott said. ``Quite 
frankly, the members voted in their best interests.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Elliott said nearly 11,000 of the Detroit Federation of  
Teachers' 11,500 members were eligible to vote. Teachers secretly 
voted at their work locations. 
</P>
<P>
	On Aug. 30, the day before classes were to begin, teachers  
rejected their union's proposal for a contract extension during 
negotiations and went on strike. 
</P>
<P>
	Approximately 180,000 students missed six days of school during  
the dispute until teachers voted overwhelmingly to return to work 
nine days later. 
</P>
<P>
	The teachers had walked off the job because they were not happy  
about proposals made by the school reform board appointed this 
spring, including a longer school day and merit pay. 
</P>
<P>
	Ultimately, the school board dropped both reform proposals, for  
the time being at least. 
</P>
<P>
	The new contract includes a plan to reduce class size in  
kindergarten through third grade. The deal also includes more 
restrictions on unexcused absences of teachers, which was a board 
priority. 
</P>
<P>
	Steve Conn, a math teacher who was one of the most vocal  
teachers during the strike, said teachers approved the contract by 
such a large margin because of the way the ballot was worded. 
</P>
<P>
	The ballot asked teachers to either accept the agreement or  
reject the contract and ``withhold'' services starting Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's flat out untrue that we would be on strike. There's  
nothing that requires that we walk out on Monday,'' Conn said. ``I 
think if it was a fair yes-no vote, it would have been much 
closer.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Elliott said the union used the same ballot language it has used  
since the 1970s. He denied that the language was aimed at ensuring 
the contract would be approved.

<HEADLINE> No. 6 Nebraska 40, Missouri 10 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	COLUMBIA, Mo. (AP) -- This time, Nebraska needed no last-second  
heroics against Missouri. Not by a long shot. 
</P>
<P>
	The No. 6 Cornhuskers capitalized on two high punt snaps and an  
interception to take a 16-point first-quarter lead en route to a 
40-10 victory over Missouri on Saturday night. Missouri, which has 
lost 36 straight games to top-10 opponents since 1981, had two 
punts blocked for touchdowns in its opener against 
Alabama-Birmingham Sept. 4. 
</P>
<P>
	Eric Crouch threw for two touchdowns and ran for one as Nebraska  
(4-0) won its 100th game of the 1990s -- one fewer than the decade's 
top team, Florida State. Nebraska has won 21 straight over Missouri 
since 1978, has won 25 straight conference openers and has 
outscored opponents 126-23, thanks mostly to its defense. 
</P>
<P>
	Nebraska held Missouri (2-1) to a second-quarter field goal and  
Julius Jackson had an interception and a fumble recovery, both 
setting up touchdowns. 
</P>
<P>
	Crouch also hit former quarterback Bobby Newcombe for a 53-yard  
score in the second half and Correll Buckhalter ran for 132 yards 
on 14 carries with a touchdown. Crouch had 92 yards rushing on 15 
carries and was 10-for-17 for 143 yards. 
</P>
<P>
	Nebraska played at Missouri for the first time since Matt  
Davison's miracle catch forced overtime and preserved an unbeaten 
season in 1997, and the game drew a sellout crowd of 68,174. 
Davison, a junior, caught a 7-yard scoring pass in the first 
quarter Saturday night. 
</P>
<P>
	The first two snap from Ben Davidson, both from the Missouri 35,  
sailed over the head of punter Jared Gilpin. The first was about 10 
feet too high and Gilpin bobbled it once in full retreat before 
slapping it out of the end zone for a safety with 13:13 left in the 
first quarter. 
</P>
<P>
	Gilpin leaped to get his hands on the second snap but it got  
away, and he finally threw a desperate pass that fell incomplete. 
Five plays later, Crouch hit Davison for a 9-0 lead. 
</P>
<P>
	Jackson intercepted Kirk Farmer's pass to give Nebraska the ball  
at the Missouri 31 with two seconds left in the quarter. On the 
next play, Crouch ran around right end on the option to make it 
16-0. 
</P>
<P>
	Jackson recovered a fumble by wide receiver Brandon Ford at the  
Missouri 30 in the third quarter to set up a 10-yard scoring run by 
Correll Buckhalter, who became the first Nebraska back in six games 
to run for 100 yards. 
</P>
<P>
	Nebraska led 19-3 at the break, the first time in 21 games that  
Missouri did not lead at halftime. The Cornhuskers had a whopping 
196-52 advantage in yardage. 
</P>
<P>
	Missouri was held to a 47-yard field goal by Brad Hammerich in  
the second quarter before Travis Garvin's 26-yard catch from Farmer 
with 2:13 to go. 
</P>
<P>
	Jim Doughtery, who shares the job with Farmer and got the start,  
left with a sprained knee in the third quarter. Dougherty 
originally hurt the knee in the opener.

<HEADLINE> Reputed JFK Mistress Exner Dies </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 *AP Photo NY26    	
</P>
<P>
	DUARTE, Calif. (AP) -- Judith Campbell Exner, a reputed mistress  
of John F. Kennedy who claimed to have ferried messages between the 
president and Mafia boss Sam Giancana, has died of breast cancer. 
She was 65. 
</P>
<P>
	Exner died Friday night at the City of Hope Cancer Center,  
hospital officials said. She had suffered from the illness since 
1978, according to her attorney, James Lesar of Washington, D.C. 
</P>
<P>
	Exner made waves in 1977 with her autobiography, ``My Story,''  
that included a description of her alleged affair with Kennedy. 
</P>
<P>
	In a 1996 issue of Vanity Fair, Ms. Exner said she ended a  
two-year affair because she hated being ``the other woman,'' and 
also claimed that she aborted Kennedy's child 10 months before he 
was assassinated. 
</P>
<P>
	She also claimed that during Kennedy's presidency she was  
Giancana's lover and carried messages between the president and the 
Chicago mob boss, including details of a plot to assassinate Cuban 
leader Fidel Castro. 
</P>
<P>
	Some have doubted that story, including Giancana's daughter,  
Antoinette, who has said her father had ``utter contempt'' for 
Kennedy and never mentioned any contact with the president during 
his time in the White House. 
</P>
<P>
	In a 1975 appearance before the U.S. Senate intelligence  
committee, Exner said she had an 18-month affair with Kennedy 
before and after he entered the White House, and that she later had 
an affair with Giancana. 
</P>
<P>
	But she said she knew of no ties between the two.  
</P>
<P>
	Lesar, in a statement, said Exner lied because she feared she  
would be killed, as Giancana had been months earlier. 
</P>
<P>
	Exner was born Judith Katherine Inmoor on January 11, 1934 in  
New York but grew up primarily in the Los Angeles, her attorney 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	At 18, she married actor William Campbell and moved with him in  
entertainment circles. After their 1958 divorce, she briefly dated 
singer Frank Sinatra, Lesar said. 
</P>
<P>
	At a 1960 Las Vegas performance of Sinatra and other members of  
the famous ``Rat Pack,'' Sinatra introduced her to Kennedy, who was 
in town on a presidential campaign swing, Lesar said.

<P>
	BLACKWATER NATIONAL WILDLIFE REFUGE, Md. (AP) -- Bill Geise has  
met the enemy. It's a swamp rat as big as a pit bull, and about as 
affable. A quartet of orange buckteeth jut from its pinched face 
like a mouthful of Doritos. 
</P>
<P>
	Those chisels are good for one thing: tearing out acres of  
tender salt marsh plants by the roots. 
</P>
<P>
	The nutria is native to South America but has invaded this  
tranquil, tawny fringe of Chesapeake Bay where Geise wandered as a 
boy. 
</P>
<P>
	Safe from predators a hemisphere away, flotillas of the  
web-footed rodents are defoliating one of America's richest 
preserves. One-third of the refuge's original 23,000 acres of 
whispering bull rush and cordgrass now are silent mud flats and 
sterile bays that stretch for miles into the hazy horizon. 
</P>
<P>
	The nutria is killing the place Geise loves. He aims to return  
the favor. ``To me,'' complains Geise, now the Blackwater's fire 
warden, ``nutria are no different than somebody taking a bulldozer 
to the marsh.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ecologists estimate that more than 6,000 alien plant and animal  
species like the nutria have invaded the United States with dozens 
more arriving each year. 
</P>
<P>
	A few arrived with the first European settlers 500 years ago,  
but the increase in global trade and tourism in the jet age has 
turned the trickle of previous centuries into a torrent. 
</P>
<P>
	They cross oceans and continents in the shoes and luggage of  
tourists, in shipping ballast, in packing materials, even in bald 
tires heading to recapping plants. Most are stowaways; some are 
brought in deliberately. 
</P>
<P>
	Aliens are redrawing the global landscape in ways no one  
imagined. They crowd out native plants and animals, spread disease, 
damage crops and threaten drinking water supplies. At Yellowstone 
Lake, alien sport fish introduced by fishermen munch on endangered 
cutthroat trout. In large parts of San Francisco Bay, aliens 
account for nine out of 10 species. 
</P>
<P>
	Exotic species are a parasite on the U.S. economy, sapping an  
estimated $138 billion annually according to a Cornell University 
study. That's nearly twice the annual state budget of New York, or 
a third more than Bill Gates' personal fortune. 
</P>
<P>
	Aliens have contributed to the decline of 42 percent of the  
country's endangered and threatened native species, according to 
the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service. 
</P>
<P>
	Nor is it a one-way street. The North American gray squirrel is  
wiping out native red squirrels in Europe. An Atlantic jellyfish 
contributed to the collapse of Black Sea fisheries already weakened 
by pollution. 
</P>
<P>
	Ecologists warn that, collectively, this ``biological  
pollution'' poses nearly as great an environmental threat as 
habitat losses generated by more familiar enemies of nature 
including development, clear-cut logging, overgrazing and oil 
spills. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have inaugurated a new era of ecological chaos,'' said  
Chris Bright of the Worldwatch Institute in Washington, D.C. ``When 
an exotic establishes a new beachhead, it can spread to new areas 
and adapt. This is happening all the time, virtually everywhere.'' 
</P>
<P>
	So far, like human immigration control, the battle against alien  
species has been spotty, expensive and largely ineffective. 
</P>
<P>
	Two dozen federal agencies have stitched together a crazy quilt  
of detection and eradication efforts with state and local 
authorities. But much of the effort is aimed at ports, borders and 
threats to crops. There is little leftover to combat emergencies. 
</P>
<P>
	In February, President Clinton formed a Cabinet-level task force  
to more strenuously defend against exotic species. Three 
departments -- Interior, Agriculture and Commerce -- are seeking 
$28.8 million in fiscal year 2000 for a wider battle. 
</P>
<P>
	The Agriculture Department alone spends $30 million annually on  
weed management. But Randy Westbrooks, the federal government's 
noxious-weed coordinator, has just $450,000 to counter new 
outbreaks. 
</P>
<P>
	Westbrooks' latest foe is a Brazilian native known as floating  
fern, discovered in the Toledo Bend Reservoir in east Texas. He 
complains he lacks emergency funding to eradicate the aquatic weed 
while the outbreak is small. To do the job himself would exceed his 
annual budget. 
</P>
<P>
	``It'll spread through every waterway in the South,'' Westbrooks  
predicts. ``When it starts clogging pipes and burning out 
irrigation pumps, we'll pay attention to it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Florida has already been particularly hard hit by alien species.  
Ecologists estimate that one in every four plant and animal species 
there is not native. 
</P>
<P>
	The alien species invasion -- Interior secretary Bruce Babbitt  
calls it an ``explosion in slow motion'' -- is turning even staunch 
conservationists into stone cold killers. 
</P>
<P>
	They're trapping nutria. Poisoning sport fish. Spraying weeds  
from aircraft like it was Vietnam, not North Dakota. Ripping out 
saltcedar with bulldozers and chains. 
</P>
<P>
	``Restoring the wilderness means bringing some land under  
tighter human control in the short term,'' said ecologist Greg 
Aplet of the Wilderness Society. 
</P>
<P>
	Waiting for nature to heal itself has failed miserably, many  
environmental groups acknowledge. Within a few years, people wake 
up to find unfamiliar plants and animals growing like kudzu, the 
alien plant that ate the South. 
</P>
<P>
	They're in national parks and monuments. In wildlife refuges and  
coastal marine sanctuaries. In wilderness areas that were intended 
to remain living dioramas of our American paradise lost. 
</P>
<P>
	Alien species are invading cities, too.  
</P>
<P>
	The Formosan termite, a stowaway in crates that brought  
equipment back from the Pacific during World War II, has infested 
90 percent of New Orleans' gracious French Quarter, where it is 
causing an estimated $300 million a year in damage, repairs and 
pest control. The super-termite's jaws have put the area on the 
National Trust for Historic Preservations' list of the 11 most 
endangered historical sites. It's the only site on the list because 
of a bug. 
</P>
<P>
	The Asian longhorned beetle is destroying thousands of hardwood  
trees in Chicago and New York City, threatening to turn shady 
neighborhoods into urban deserts. The treatment has been as painful 
as the invasion: chopping down infected trees. The U.S. Department 
of Agriculture says the insect could cause about $130 billion in 
damage if it breaks out of it beachheads in the two cities and 
becomes widely established. 
</P>
<P>
	In some places, researchers are turning to high-tech and  
unorthodox weapons. 
</P>
<P>
	University of Kentucky scientists fly a radar-equipped airplane  
over the Ohio River Valley to find the Asian tiger mosquito. The 
mosquitoes don't make a radar blip, but the radar can spot hidden 
mounds of scrap tires, where the insects breed. Tiger mosquitoes 
love tires. They arrived in 1985 in a Japanese container shipment 
headed for a Houston recapping plant. 
</P>
<P>
	They have spread to 25 states and followed trade routes to  
Africa and South America, too. Aggressive biters, tiger mosquitoes 
transmit 17 potentially fatal tropical viruses, including dengue 
fever, yellow fever and forms of encephalitis. One dengue epidemic 
linked to the tiger mosquito in Rio de Janeiro infected 1 million 
people. 
</P>
<P>
	Outbreaks have not been reported in the United States, but  
public officials were concerned enough to spend $2 million removing 
a swampy tire dump next to Disney World after the tiger mosquito 
was found deep within the piles. 
</P>
<P>
	In the Great Lakes and Mississippi River basins, zebra mussels  
are expected to cause $5 billion in damages to shipping and power 
plants by 2002, according to the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service. 
Biologists believe the Black Sea natives were stowaways in ballast 
water of cargo ships that was discharged into Lake St. Clair near 
Detroit in the late 1980s. 
</P>
<P>
	Damage by the thumbnail-sized mollusk represents only a fraction  
of the costs being rung up by invasive species. The total is $138 
billion annually and growing according to a study by Cornell 
University economist David Pimentel. His study, the most 
comprehensive of its kind, considered such factors as crop losses, 
depressed land values, eradication programs and medical bills 
covering everything from invasive pathogens like AIDS to emergency 
room treatments for feral dog bites. 
</P>
<P>
	As a last resort, scientists are taking the risky step of  
fighting aliens with aliens. They travel to the exotics' homelands 
to recruit natural born killers -- predators, parasites and 
pathogens -- that previously held the pests in check. 
</P>
<P>
	Unfortunately, some biological agents turn traitor and attack  
native species after being released here. 
</P>
<P>
	In Hawaii, for example, the carnivorous rosy wolf snail was  
imported to kill the giant African tree snail. Instead, it has 
pounced on 800 local mollusk species, driving more than 50 to 
extinction since the mid-1950s. 
</P>
<P>
	Such eco-disasters are prompting more rigorous testing.  
</P>
<P>
	On the Pine Butte Swamp preserve in Montana and other northern  
plains sites, managers have cautiously released a cavalry of tiny 
flea beetles in patches of leafy spurge since 1994. So far, the 
flea beetles bugs appear to be devouring only the alien weed, but 
it could take years before scientists can be sure. 
</P>
<P>
	The leafy spurge, a Eurasian herb that infests 5 million acres  
from California to Maine, is believe to have hitchhiked in sacks of 
grain seed brought from Russia in 1827 by Mennonite immigrants. 
Give an alien species two centuries to spread and, experts say, 
eradication may be impossible. 
</P>
<P>
	Some have been here longer still. Spanish conquistadors brought  
horses -- as well as smallpox and other alien diseases -- to the 
Americas 500 years ago. 
</P>
<P>
	Some pests have grown so familiar that people don't realize  
they're aliens. For example, American colonists brought the 
dandelion from Europe. 
</P>
<P>
	By those measures, leafy spurge is a newcomer. Still, states  
spend $144 million annually to fight it with little success. In 
Ashley National Forest in Utah, crews have drenched one patch with 
herbicides for 13 years. At Pine Butte, spurge is overtaking the 
last prairie wetland visited by grizzly bears. 
</P>
<P>
	Perhaps the flea beetle will crawl to the rescue since it  
co-evolved with the weed in Eurasia. Nothing else works. 
</P>
<P>
	``There are buds in the weed's roots,'' explains Keith Fletcher  
of the Nature Conservancy's Iowa chapter, who released flea beetles 
last summer at the Broken Kettle Grasslands Preserve in the Loess 
Hills near Sioux City. ``If you pull it, mow it, burn it, if you 
take a disc and cut it up into one-inch pieces, it stimulates these 
buds to make new seeds.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In the Blackwater's fetid, brackish wetlands, nutria are the  
furry equivalent of leafy spurge. 
</P>
<P>
	Swamp ranchers, who once envisioned selling their pelts as a  
middle-class mink, brought the rodents to 22 states in the 1930s 
and 1940s. In Louisiana, for example, E.A. McIlhenney of Tabasco 
sauce fame imported 13 nutria from Argentina. 
</P>
<P>
	But nutria chic was doomed by fickle fashion tastes. Set free in  
the Blackwater and elsewhere, the rodents started doing what comes 
naturally -- gorging and mating. 
</P>
<P>
	Over 16 months, a single female and her progeny can produce 150  
offspring. 
</P>
<P>
	In Louisiana, the Tabasco family's baker's dozen now number at  
least 3 million in the bayous. Maryland's population is 50,000 and 
growing rapidly. The Blackwater is the epicenter of the boom, but 
nutria now infest the entire Eastern Shore. 
</P>
<P>
	``They are furry cockroaches!'' state biologist Robert Colona  
shouts over the racket of a motorboat. He gestures with his 
cigarette at a ragged stretch of half-eaten Blackwater salt marsh 
over the bow. 
</P>
<P>
	``You might not see nutria very often, but their signs are  
everywhere -- their tracks, their droppings.'' 
</P>
<P>
	They are devastating habitat for rare native species like bald  
eagles and eliminating nurseries for the crabs and oysters that 
have paid the mortgages of tidewater families for generations. 
</P>
<P>
	Nutria scatter into the heart of a wetland, and randomly chew  
into its thick carpet of starchy roots. Biologists call those 
``eat-outs.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Aerial photos show the marsh damage blistering until the  
eat-outs merge into open bays. Then saltier water from the 
Chesapeake seeps in with the tide, strangling stands of loblolly 
pine and accelerating erosion. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a cancer,'' said refuge biologist Keith Weaver.  
</P>
<P>
	To these researchers, the only question is how best to kill  
nutria. 
</P>
<P>
	Louisiana's eradication program failed despite extensive  
trapping and poisoning campaigns; now it's motto is population 
control. One agency posts Cajun recipes on its Internet site. 
(Nutria gumbo? Pass the Tabasco.) A sheriff's SWAT team blasts the 
rodents for nocturnal target practice. 
</P>
<P>
	But the nutria are growing cagey. ``They've gotten real  
suspicious of a boat motor,'' Colona said. ``The dumb ones already 
have been weeded out.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Next year, Blackwater and state agencies will launch a $2.9  
million eradication campaign over three years. 
</P>
<P>
	Geise still relies on the paths and false channels he memorized  
as a boy to navigate the refuge. He'll guide biologists who plan to 
fit males with radio transmitters to map their wanderlust. They'll 
test traps, poisons and some unconventional biological lures -- 
vocalizations and sex hormone scents -- that put a modernist twist 
on the Pied Piper legend. 
</P>
<P>
	Their ace-in-the-hole? Cold weather. A nutria in Brazil rarely  
encounters a snowflake. 
</P>
<P>
	Geise hankers for a winter like 1978, when much of the  
Chesapeake froze solid. Out on the marsh, he would find nutria 
huddling 15 or 20 deep. 
</P>
<P>
	``Kick the piles apart, and underneath you could find a few  
still alive, trying to keep warm,'' Geise recalled. 
</P>
<P>
	Hardhearted? Geise offers no apology. The South American  
interlopers have forded a creek to infest the swamp behind his 
ancestral farm, too. 
</P>
<P>
	``I grew up on the Blackwater,'' he declares, ``and I'm watching  
it disappear. It's really sad.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Spoken like a true native.

<HEADLINE> Reputed JFK Mistress Exner Dies </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 *AP Photo NY26    	
</P>
<P>
	DUARTE, Calif. (AP) -- Judith Campbell Exner, a reputed mistress  
of John F. Kennedy who claimed to have ferried messages between the 
president and Mafia boss Sam Giancana, has died of breast cancer. 
She was 65. 
</P>
<P>
	Exner died Friday night at the City of Hope Cancer Center,  
hospital officials said. She had suffered from the illness since 
1978, according to her attorney, James Lesar of Washington, D.C. 
</P>
<P>
	Exner made waves in 1977 with her autobiography, ``My Story,''  
that included a description of her alleged affair with Kennedy. 
</P>
<P>
	In a 1996 issue of Vanity Fair, Ms. Exner said she ended a  
two-year affair because she hated being ``the other woman,'' and 
also claimed that she aborted Kennedy's child 10 months before he 
was assassinated. 
</P>
<P>
	She also claimed that during Kennedy's presidency she was  
Giancana's lover and carried messages between the president and the 
Chicago mob boss, including details of a plot to assassinate Cuban 
leader Fidel Castro. 
</P>
<P>
	Some have doubted that story, including Giancana's daughter,  
Antoinette, who has said her father had ``utter contempt'' for 
Kennedy and never mentioned any contact with the president during 
his time in the White House. 
</P>
<P>
	In a 1975 appearance before the U.S. Senate intelligence  
committee, Exner said she had an 18-month affair with Kennedy 
before and after he entered the White House, and that she later had 
an affair with Giancana. 
</P>
<P>
	But she said she knew of no ties between the two.  
</P>
<P>
	Lesar, in a statement, said Exner lied because she feared she  
would be killed, as Giancana had been months earlier. 
</P>
<P>
	Exner was born Judith Katherine Inmoor on January 11, 1934 in  
New York but grew up primarily in the Los Angeles, her attorney 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	At 18, she married actor William Campbell and moved with him in  
entertainment circles. After their 1958 divorce, she briefly dated 
singer Frank Sinatra, Lesar said. 
</P>
<P>
	At a 1960 Las Vegas performance of Sinatra and other members of  
the famous ``Rat Pack,'' Sinatra introduced her to Kennedy, who was 
in town on a presidential campaign swing, Lesar said.

<HEADLINE> Martin Sheen Plays the President </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BURBANK, Calif. (AP) -- The Oval Office never looked like this:  
furniture of all kinds crammed into the room, filling every bit of 
space on the huge oval rug -- like an upscale garage sale. 
</P>
<P>
	``We had to stack the furniture in here while we were building  
another White House office next door,'' explained John Wells. He is 
co-producer of NBC's new series, ``The West Wing,'' which offers 
drama, romance, comedy and yes, some statesmanship from 9-10 p.m. 
EDT on Wednesday nights. 
</P>
<P>
	The Oval Office and its anterooms, hallways, reception areas and  
the vice president's office occupy two full sound stages at Warner 
Bros. studio. 
</P>
<P>
	``The dimensions of the Oval Office are not exact, but they're  
very close,'' Wells commented. ``It was originally built for the 
feature film 'The American President,' which our series creator and 
co-producer, Aaron Sorkin, also wrote.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A caravan of makeup trailers surround both stages to accommodate  
``The West Wing's'' ensemble cast, including veteran Hollywood 
activist Martin Sheen as the president; John Spencer, chief of 
staff; Allison Janney, press secretary; Richard Schiff, 
communications director, and Rob Lowe as his assistant. 
</P>
<P>
	Standing near Sheen's trailer is a man in a suit with a tiny  
receiver in his ear. No, it's not the controversial actor's 
personal security -- just a bit-player waiting for his next walk-on 
as a Secret Service agent. 
</P>
<P>
	Sheen, looking unpresidential in baggy casual clothes, told how  
he became involved in the series: 
</P>
<P>
	``When you make a deal for a series pilot, you have to sign for  
the whole first year. My deal was to appear once a month; that was 
appealing to me. I had done miniseries, but never a series. 
</P>
<P>
	``We started, and I had a lot of fun and was very impressed with  
the pilot. Then John and Aaron called and said, 'Would you 
reconsider the contract? We're thinking the president should be 
more involved. All we're seeing is the administration reflected in 
the staff.''' Sheen acquiesced. 
</P>
<P>
	Sheen is no stranger to the presidency. He played John F.  
Kennedy in the 1983 miniseries ``Kennedy.'' He has also appeared as 
such power figures as Robert F. Kennedy (``The Missiles of 
October,'' 1974) and chief of staff to Michael Douglas in ``The 
American President.'' 
</P>
<P>
	As proof that ``The West Wing'' is fiction -- if not fantasy --  
Sheen's character, Josiah Bartlet, is not only president, he's a 
Nobel Prize winner in economics. 
</P>
<P>
	``The series came up so fast that we don't know much about him  
yet,'' Sheen said. ``We talk about the first lady and the children, 
but we haven't cast them yet. 
</P>
<P>
	``We do know that he's a Democrat, he's very conservative on  
economics and the military, but on domestic policy, he's very 
liberal. He's Catholic, long married to the same woman, he's a 
grandfather -- and they'll be no fooling around,'' Sheen insisted. 
</P>
<P>
	``He was governor of New Hampshire, the second president from  
New Hampshire, following Franklin Pierce (1853-57). I researched 
it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Unlike Martin Sheen, Josiah Bartlet is not a pacifist. In an  
early episode, Bartlet wants a massive retaliation for a terrorist 
attack in the Middle East. Sheen admitted that the script made him 
``very uncomfortable.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He added that the series is planning to tackle such hot-button  
issues as gun control, abortion and gay rights. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's not going to be a smooth ride,'' he admitted. ``I think  
we're going to draw a lot of heat. That's fine.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Sheen has drawn plenty of heat during his pacifistic crusades.  
Just last month he was among 75 protesters police led away in 
plastic handcuffs during a demonstration at the Los Alamos National 
Laboratory in New Mexico on the 54th anniversary of the bombing of 
Nagasaki. 
</P>
<P>
	The actor, marking his 59th birthday, told reporters it was his  
59th arrest at a protest location. Before signing his series 
contract, he insisted on furloughs for the Los Alamos protest, plus 
another on Nov. 21 at Fort Benning, Ga., where the School of the 
Americas trains Latin American soldiers. 
</P>
<P>
	Despite all the politicking, on- and off-screen, producer Wells  
insists that the goal of ``West Wing'' goal is not to defend anyone 
or attack anyone. The show isn't about political views or issues. 
The show is about people who work in the White House.''

<HEADLINE> 1 Missing As Drilling Rig Capsizes </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PORT ARANSAS, Texas (AP) -- A 122-foot drilling rig capsized in  
the Gulf of Mexico early Saturday, leaving 11 crewmembers to be 
rescued and one man missing, the Coast Guard said. 
</P>
<P>
	The jack-up rig DL-Hanson collapsed about 1:30 a.m. when one of  
its four legs gave way in 150-180 feet of water about 30 miles 
northeast of Aransas Pass, said Coast Guard Lt. Michael Beliveua 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	There were 12 crew members aboard.  
</P>
<P>
	``Some went in the water, some held onto the rig,'' Beliveua  
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Scores of rescue craft, including three Navy minesweepers, three  
boats, five helicopters and a jet from Air Station Corpus Christi 
were dispatched to the rig. 
</P>
<P>
	Four crew members were airlifted to Spohn Memorial Hospital in  
Corpus Christi, where they were treated for minor injuries and 
released. Seven others were rescued by boats and delivered to other 
nearby rigs. 
</P>
<P>
	One man remained missing Saturday afternoon.  
</P>
<P>
	The DL-Hanson is operated by Cardinal Services of New Iberia,  
La. A spokesman did not return a telephone call from The Associated 
Press early Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
	The Coast Guard's Marine Safety Office is investigating the  
accident. 
</P>
<P>
	Jack-up rigs are platforms used for drilling for oil and for  
other sub-surface exploration. They can be floated into place and 
jacked up on retractable legs to the proper height.

<HEADLINE> Grander Hendrix Memorial Planned </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	RENTON, Wash. (AP) -- For nearly three decades, Jimi Hendrix's  
flat, simple gravestone on a grassy hillside has drawn visitors 
from around the world. 
</P>
<P>
	Within a year, the Hendrix family hopes to have a far grander  
memorial built at Greenwood Memorial Park for the guitarist who 
seared eardrums worldwide with hits such as ``Purple Haze,'' ``Hey 
Joe'' and ``Foxey Lady.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``So many people were behind it that we just decided to do it,''  
said Hendrix's father, James ``Al'' Hendrix. ``So many people come 
from all over the world (and) when they come here to Seattle, it's 
one of the first things they look for.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Drawings unveiled Friday depicted a granite dome supported by  
nine pillars. Beneath the dome, surrounded by benches, would be a 
life-size 5-foot, 11 1/2-inch bronze statue of Hendrix as he appeared 
at the Woodstock music festival in 1969, the year before he died in 
London from an overdose of sleeping pills. 
</P>
<P>
	The tentative dedication date is Sept. 18, 2000, the 30th  
anniversary of Hendrix's death.

<HEADLINE> Food Costs To Rise Just 2 Percent </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Tough times for livestock producers mean good  
news for consumers. 
</P>
<P>
	Food costs will rise just 2 percent this year, the smallest  
increase in seven years, and by about the same amount in 2000 
because of abundant meat supplies and relatively stable costs for 
processors and supermarkets, the government says. 
</P>
<P>
	The estimates include both the cost of eating out and the prices  
shoppers pay at the grocery store. 
</P>
<P>
	Supermarket prices will rise an estimated 1.7 percent this year,  
while restaurant prices are expected to go up 2.6 percent, 
according to a new report by the Agriculture Department. 
</P>
<P>
	Heavy production of beef, poultry and pork has reduced the  
income of many farmers and ranchers in recent years; pork producers 
are expected to see their income fall nearly 20 percent in 1999. 
</P>
<P>
	Although cattle producers are cutting back on their herds, it is  
unlikely beef prices will rise significantly until supplies of pork 
and poultry tighten, said Annette Clauson, a department economist. 
</P>
<P>
	Consumers often switch from one meat to another, depending on  
the price. ``If there are small supplies of one but not the other, 
that holds down price increases,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	Pork prices dropped nearly 5 percent last year and more than 2  
percent this year. They would have fallen even more except that 
consumer demand is so strong supermarkets have not had to offer big 
discounts, according to the report. 
</P>
<P>
	Commercial pork production is up 1 percent this year and  
consumption is expected to reach a record 53.5 pounds per person 
</P>
<P>
	``There's a good healthy demand. Our message that pork is ... a  
lot healthier and lower in fat cholesterol, is reaching people. 
People are becoming aware of the qualities of modern pork,'' said 
Steve Cohen, a spokesman for the National Pork Producers 
Federation. 
</P>
<P>
	Hurricane Floyd, which may have destroyed as many as 3 million  
chickens and more than 100,000 hogs in North Carolina, is unlikely 
to have any impact on prices. That is only a fraction of the 
poultry and pork production nationwide; about 150 million chickens 
are slaughtered very week, Clauson said. 
</P>
<P>
	Egg prices also will be down this year, more than 3 percent,  
while the cost of most other foods are up: 2.5 percent for cereal 
and bakery products, about 2 percent for both fresh and processed 
fruits and vegetables, and nearly 5 percent for milk and other 
dairy products. 
</P>
<P>
	Coffee drinkers also are getting good news. The cost of  
nonalcoholic beverages is rising just 1.1 percent this year largely 
because of a near-record coffee crop in Brazil, the largest 
producer of Arabica beans. The trees finally have recovered from 
the effects of a freeze in 1994 and weather was excellent this 
year, USDA said. 
</P>
<P>
	The overall increase in food costs will be the lowest since  
prices rose just 1.2 percent in 1992 during a recession. 
</P>
<P>
	Depressed prices for wheat and other grains has had little  
effect on what consumers are paying because the cost of those raw 
commodities account for a small fraction of the price of processed 
foods. 
</P>
<P>
	``Your highly processed foods, your cereals, your breads ...  
those items are very highly driven by the overall inflation rate,'' 
Clauson said. 
</P>
<P>
	Farmers get 21 cents of each dollar Americans spend on food, and  
that share has fallen steadily. A decade ago, the farmers' share 
was 32 cents on the dollar.

<HEADLINE> Forbes Blasts Bush As 'Silent' </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ANAHEIM, Calif. (AP) -- Presidential candidate Steve Forbes  
lashed out at fellow Republicans, accusing congressional leaders, 
George W. Bush and two other governors Saturday of failing to stand 
up for principle on crucial issues facing them. 
</P>
<P>
	Forbes denounced Texas Gov. Bush and Gov. John Engler of  
Michigan for failing to support a ballot measure in Michigan to 
create a school voucher system. Engler has said the measure, which 
would let public money pay children's private and parochial school 
expenses, has ``no hope of passing.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Leadership means acting from principle,'' Forbes told  
reporters. ``I spoke out in favor of that referendum. Governor Bush 
has been silent.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Forbes criticized Tennessee Gov. Don Sundquist, another  
Republican, for saying he would sign a bill creating a state income 
tax if the Tennessee Legislature passes it. Tennessee and eight 
other states have no income tax. 
</P>
<P>
	``That goes against Republican principles,'' Forbes said. ``I  
spoke out against that tax increase, because I think it's what 
politics does too often -- always finds new ways to pick your 
pockets.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Governor Bush has been silent,'' he said.  
</P>
<P>
	Both Sundquist and Engler are Bush supporters.  
</P>
<P>
	Forbes also castigated Republican congressional leaders for  
``indicating they're going to leave the field'' after President 
Clinton vetoed their tax-cut proposal last week. 
</P>
<P>
	``They should show principle and gumption and verve and nerve  
and do precisely the opposite,'' Forbes said. ``They should break 
that bill up into five or six different bills so people could 
actually understand what's in the thing, such as getting rid of the 
marriage penalty.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Then Republican leaders should send the separate bills to  
Clinton, Forbes said, ``and let him veto each and every one.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``I came out in favor of that. Governor Bush has been silent,''  
Forbes said. 
</P>
<P>
	A spokeswoman for Bush's California campaign, Margita Thompson,  
said she did not know what the Texas governor's position was on the 
Michigan and Tennessee issues Forbes cited. 
</P>
<P>
	Responding to Forbes' attack, she said: ``It's fine for some  
candidates to talk about things. What Governor Bush has done is act 
on Republican principles and deliver results, such as signing the 
two largest tax cuts in Texas history.''

<HEADLINE> Ryder Cup Turns Unknowns Into Stars  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BROOKLINE, Mass. (AP) -- The Ryder Cup is where stars are born.  
</P>
<P>
	Sergio Garcia, the youngest player in Ryder Cup history, made a  
smashing debut at The Country Club with leaps and smiles, along 
with a magnificent display of shotmaking and two victories in his 
matches with Jesper Parnevik. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, this 19-year-old Spaniard didn't exactly come out of  
nowhere. His stage was Medinah, where Garcia hit a shot out of a 
tree and nearly stole the PGA Championship from Tiger Woods. 
</P>
<P>
	The same can't be said for the rest of the European rookies -- at  
least not yet. 
</P>
<P>
	``They want it badly,'' captain Mark James said. ``They want to  
do well. They want to win points and they want to be the next Ryder 
Cup superstars.'' 
</P>
<P>
	They were off to a good start.  
</P>
<P>
	Meet Padraig Harrington, the Irishman with only one European  
tour victory. He never backed down against PGA champion Davis Love 
III and two-time U.S. Open champion Payne Stewart in an 
alternate-shot match Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	Harrington was paired with Miguel Angel Jimenez, a 35-year-old  
rookie and at least the fourth most famous golfer in Spain, a 
country where golf never has been terribly popular. All Jimenez did 
in his Ryder Cup debut was contribute 1 1/2 points. 
</P>
<P>
	Then there's Paul Lawrie of Scotland, who wasn't known much  
outside the British Isles and remains an enigma despite winning the 
British Open. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm new on the scene, and no one knows who I am over here,''  
Lawrie said. ``I don't have a problem with it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Like Jimenez, Lawrie contributed a halved match and a decisive  
victory, pairing with Colin Montgomerie for a 3 and 2 victory over 
David Duval and Phil Mickelson. 
</P>
<P>
	To continue this pace for the rest of the matches would only  
follow a long line of European players who showed up for the 
matches as unknowns in the United States, but left the Americans 
wondering not only what hit them, but who hit them. 
</P>
<P>
	``For some reason, they raise the level of play for this  
tournament,'' Love said. ``Seven rookies doesn't seem to matter.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Love only has to look back to 1997 to realize that. Europe  
brought five Ryder Cup rookies to Valderrama, Spain, to face a U.S. 
team that included three of the year's major championship winners. 
Ignacio Garrido, Thomas Bjorn, Lee Westwood, Darren Clarke and 
Parnevik contributed eight points to the European cause in a 
14 1/2-13 1/2 victory. 
</P>
<P>
	At Oak Hill in 1995, Europe trailed 9-7 going into the final day  
but won four matches that were decided at the 18th hole. Three of 
the victories came from Howard Clark, David Gilford and Philip 
Walton, who scored the decisive point. 
</P>
<P>
	If the Cup is decided Sunday, history points toward Harrington  
getting the glory. 
</P>
<P>
	Not only did Walton get the final point in 1995, but Eamonn  
Darcy holed a 10-foot birdie at the 18th at Muirfield Village in 
1987 to beat Ben Crenshaw, the pivotal match in Europe's first 
Ryder Cup victory on American soil. 
</P>
<P>
	And two years later, Christy O'Connor Jr. laced a 2-iron onto  
the 18th green at The Belfry to clinch his crucial match against 
Fred Couples. 
</P>
<P>
	``The history of the Ryder Cup in Ireland is huge,'' Harrington  
said. ``Any amateur is brought up with that and with Eamonn Darcy's 
putt in 1987, Christy O'Connor's shot in 1989 and Philip Walton 
winning the cup in 1995.'' 
</P>
<P>
	And what about Peter Baker? Even though Europe didn't win the  
1993 Ryder Cup, the 26-year-old Englishman beat Corey Pavin, Paul 
Azinger and Fred Couples in winning three of his four matches.

	Just as amazing is how some of these unknown Ryder Cup stars

<HEADLINE> D'Backs Look Beyond Division Title </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SAN FRANCISCO (AP) -- Fireworks exploded in the stadium. Younger  
teammates doused each other with champagne. Randy Johnson and Matt 
Williams stood away from the excitement, talking calmly about the 
task ahead. 
</P>
<P>
	The Arizona Diamondbacks, who went from an expansion team and  
last place to NL West champions in one season, had a mostly subdued 
celebration Friday night after clinching the title with an 11-3 win 
over the San Francisco Giants. 
</P>
<P>
	For experienced players such as Johnson and Williams, the  
temptation to whoop it up was overcome by the need to focus on 
preparing for the playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's a lot of veterans on this club that have been in the  
postseason before, and your motivation now is to get the home field 
advantage,'' said Johnson, who pitched a five-hitter to beat the 
Giants. ``The hard work doesn't stop here. There's still a lot of 
good teams we have to go through.'' 
</P>
<P>
	While Johnson stood calmly at his locker, a few feet away from  
celebrating teammates, Williams sat in front of his cubicle and 
quietly talked about the future. 
</P>
<P>
	``Come tomorrow, we have to start focusing on the next step,''  
Williams said. ``Considering what happened last year, we've come 
through a rough period.'' 
</P>
<P>
	While some of the players didn't react with much emotion, the  
Diamondbacks' fans did. In Arizona, fans gathered in sports bars to 
watch the team's clincher. 
</P>
<P>
	Cheers and chants were mixed with booze and high-fives at  
Jackson's on Third, a popular bar just one block from Bank One 
Ballpark. 
</P>
<P>
	``Randy! Randy! Randy!'' they chanted for Johnson.  
</P>
<P>
	``Gonzo! Gonzo! Gonzo!'' they cheered as a champagne-drenched  
Luis Gonzalez showed up on the screen. 
</P>
<P>
	They repeatedly hollered, ``We Want The Braves,'' a heady  
challenge to the perennial NL powers from Atlanta. 
</P>
<P>
	``Awesome, absolutely thrilling, wonderful,'' said Gina Mallory,  
44, of Tempe, whose eyes never left the screen for every pitch of 
Friday night's game. ``I used to live in St. Louis and I was a 
Cardinals fan for years, but this is awesome.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Much has been made of how there hasn't seemed to be a frenzy for  
the Diamondbacks, but there have been recent signs that the support 
is growing. 
</P>
<P>
	The crowd cheered loudest when, in the ninth inning, the camera  
switched to the Arizona clubhouse for a closeup of the champagne on 
ice. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't think people around the country are taking us  
seriously,'' said Robert Viether, 25, of Phoenix, who wore a 
Diamondbacks jersey with Brian Anderson's No. 34. ``The farther we 
go in the playoffs, the more seriously they'll take us.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Diamondbacks scheduled a celebration Sunday night at Bank  
One Ballpark Plaza. 
</P>
<P>
	Johnson was surrounded by teammates at the front of the mound  
after finishing off his major league-leading 12th complete game of 
the season. 
</P>
<P>
	Johnson, the biggest acquisition during an offseason spending  
spree that turned the expansion Diamondbacks into champions, struck 
out 11 and had an RBI single as Arizona clinched the division title 
a year after losing 97 games. 
</P>
<P>
	As the Diamondbacks celebrated in their clubhouse, fireworks  
went off in the stadium -- part of a promotion scheduled by the 
Giants long before they realized they could be hosting a clinching 
party by Arizona. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's tough to watch,'' Giants manager Dusty Baker said of the  
Diamondbacks celebrating on the field. ``You wish it was you. We 
remember when it was us.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Arizona became the first expansion club to win a division title  
in less than eight years. The Florida Marlins, who won a World 
Series championship in their fifth year, were a wild-card team in 
that 1997 season. 
</P>
<P>
	Johnson allowed three unearned runs, all in the first inning,  
but retired 14 straight batters after that. He increased his major 
league-best strikeout total to 353. 
</P>
<P>
	The 353 strikeouts moved Johnson past Bob Feller (348 for  
Cleveland in 1946) and Rube Waddell (349 for the Philadelphia A's 
in 1904) and into fourth place on the list for strikeouts in a 
season. Only Nolan Ryan and Sandy Koufax have struck out more 
batters in a year. 
</P>
<P>
	Johnson has 22 double-digit strikeout games this year, tying the  
NL record set by Koufax in 1965. 
</P>
<P>
	The Diamondbacks doubled their payroll from $32 million to $65.9  
million during the offseason by signing several key free agents, 
including Johnson and center fielder Steve Finley -- who went to the 
World Series last season as a member of the San Diego Padres. 
</P>
<P>
	``Last year, I got to do this three times,'' Finley said of the  
celebration in the Arizona clubhouse. ``My goal this year is 
four.''

<HEADLINE> IOC Reform Panel Expresses Optimism </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	GENEVA (AP) -- A key panel charged with overhauling the Olympic  
movement finalized its main recommendations Saturday amid optimism 
-- at least in public -- about the prospects for genuine reform. 
</P>
<P>
	The high-level meeting endorsed proposals from working groups on  
age limits, terms of office and selection of IOC members; financial 
transparency; visits to bidding cities and the host city selection 
process, according to an IOC statement. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have no intention of whitewashing,'' former U.S. Secretary  
of State Henry Kissinger said after the meeting. ``Our 
recommendations will have to stand the test of scrutiny. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are optimistic that we will succeed,'' he said in a  
telephone interview from IOC headquarters in Lausanne. 
</P>
<P>
	Kissinger is on the 26-member executive body of the IOC 2000  
reform committee set up in the wake of the Salt Lake City 
vote-buying scandal which plunged the Olympic movement into its 
worst ever crisis. 
</P>
<P>
	The executive board, which includes other dignitaries like  
former U.N. Secretary-General Boutros Boutros-Ghali, is due to 
present its recommendations on changes in the IOC to the full 
80-member reform committee at the end of October. The IOC's entire 
membership will have the final say at a special session in 
December. 
</P>
<P>
	``Today the IOC 2000 Executive Committee has placed a priority  
on key structural reforms that will help the IOC evolve into a more 
contemporary organization,'' IOC President Juan Antonio Samaranch 
said in a statement. 
</P>
<P>
	Despite the brave public words, no reprieve for the IOC is in  
sight. 
</P>
<P>
	A report delivered to Congress last week said the successful  
Atlanta bidders for the 1996 Summer Games lavished gifts, 
scholarships, job offers and other inducements on IOC members -- 
alleged tactics copied by Salt Lake City which won the 2002 Winter 
Games. This was coupled with stinging attacks by the White House 
drug chief, Barry McCaffrey, who said the IOC was ``Byzantine'' and 
its planned international anti-doping agency lacked independence 
and credibility. 
</P>
<P>
	Kissinger said he had met McCaffrey and was confident that ``the  
reformed structure will be able to deal with the doping issue.'' He 
said he would be briefed by IOC representatives Sunday about the 
campaign to combat performance-enhancing drugs. 
</P>
<P>
	Asked about the Atlanta bribery allegations, Kissinger said he  
was ``no expert on the past practices of the IOC.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``We are certainly making a serious and determined effort to  
remove these shortcomings,'' he added. 
</P>
<P>
	The IOC statement said the meeting had ``reviewed and accepted  
with some changes more than 100 preliminary recommendations,'' by 
three working groups to reform the movement. It did not elaborate 
on the changes and Kissinger would not go into details. 
</P>
<P>
	However, officials involved in the reform process indicated in a  
series of interviews with the AP prior to the meeting that one of 
the most sensitive issues was the age limit. 
</P>
<P>
	A working group proposed lowering the limit to 70, but  
apparently only for future members rather than current ones. In 
1995, the IOC voted to raise the limit from 75 to 80 in order to 
allow Samaranch to win another term in office. 
</P>
<P>
	Officials indicated that other recommendations by the working  
groups included limiting the IOC presidency to a single eight-year 
term. Samaranch has been in office since 1980 and is due to step 
down in 2001. 
</P>
<P>
	They also proposed the creation of a special committee to screen  
potential candidates and put names forward to the executive board 
for consideration, and the inclusion of 15 contemporary athletes 
and the heads of 15 international sports federations on the IOC, 
which would have a maximum of 115 members. 
</P>
<P>
	On the Olympic site-selection process, visits of IOC members to  
bid cities would be in organized groups without family members and 
paid for by the IOC in order to stamp out the scope for corruption 
and vote-buying, the working groups suggested. 
</P>
<P>
	The final decision on the host city would continue to be made in  
a vote of all IOC members rather than a smaller body.

<HEADLINE> Invasive Marine Life Targeted </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LONG BEACH, Calif. (AP) -- Huge cranes tower over a ship to  
unload its cargo from Asia onto awaiting trucks. And from a hole in 
the stern, water spouts into the Pacific. 
</P>
<P>
	The water, called ballast, comes from thousands of miles away.  
It was scooped up off foreign shores to help stabilize the ship for 
its ocean journey. The problem is that it can contain a stew of 
alien creatures -- crabs, clams, worms, sea squirts, you name it -- 
that would never make it this far on their own. 
</P>
<P>
	These invaders arrive every day here at the nation's busiest  
harbor and at ports around the country. Once here, they sometimes 
explode in numbers, crowd out native marine animals, dramatically 
alter habitats and threaten fisheries. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is a problem that's only getting worse,'' said Gretchen  
Lambert, a University of Washington marine biologist who has 
documented alien species in waters off California, Washington 
state, Alaska and Hawaii. 
</P>
<P>
	This summer, the U.S. Coast Guard asked ship captains coming  
from foreign ports to reverse a century-old practice and swap their 
ballast in the open sea, so that whatever alien critters are stowed 
away die in the nutrient-poor, salty ocean. 
</P>
<P>
	The California legislature recently past a bill to make the  
exchange mandatory. The bill, which would make California the first 
to require ballast exchange, has been sent to the governor for his 
signature. This has California ports worried that shipping 
companies will take their billion-dollar business northward to 
Oregon and Washington rather than comply. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a very simple equation for shippers,'' said Tim Schott,  
lobbyist for the California Association of Port Authorities. ``If 
the restrictions cost a significant amount of time or money, or if 
it slows me down because I have to manage my ballast water, I'm 
going to go to another state.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Shippers, although trying to work out a compromise, oppose the  
bill. 
</P>
<P>
	``Our concern is that No. 1, it's an international issue, No. 2  
a national issue,'' said Jay Winter of the Los Angeles-based 
Steamship Association of Southern California. ``If we end up with a 
patchwork of laws from every state that has a coastline, it's going 
to be a mess and probably not very effective.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, 40,000 gallons of foreign ballast water slip into the  
nation's harbors each minute according to James Baker, 
administrator of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric 
Administration. 
</P>
<P>
	A cargo ship parked here, the 984-foot Maersk Dorthe, can alone  
carry up to 22,000 tons of ballast water. It had just arrived from 
Hong Kong. 
</P>
<P>
	Beneath the Maersk Dorthe, 30 to 40 alien species already lurk  
in the San Pedro Bay, which includes the port of Los Angeles, said 
Bob Kanter, Long Beach port's director of planning and 
environmental affairs. 
</P>
<P>
	It's worse up north. The San Francisco Bay-Delta, with its  
inviting estuary, is now dominated by some 240 exotic species, 
including the rapidly reproducing Chinese mitten crab. Last fall, 
workers scooped up some 20,000 of them clinging to the screens used 
to prevent small fish from getting into irrigation diversions, said 
Andy Cohen, a marine biologist with the San Francisco Estuary 
Institute. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't know frankly how to get rid of any of the exotics that  
have already become established,'' said Lambert. 
</P>
<P>
	``Biologists at the University of California-Santa Barbara,  
however, recently reported that they have eradicated a microscopic 
worm from 17 abalone farms and surrounding waters. The worm, 
discovered in California six years ago, appears to have been 
unwittingly imported in abalone from South America. The biologists 
believe this was the first successful eradication of an 
established, nonnative marine pest. 
</P>
<P>
	Chesapeake Bay, home to several ports, is troubled by fewer  
alien species than San Francisco but has become ``the site of the 
most compelling marine exotic,'' said James Carlton, a marine 
biologist. He called the rapa whelk. an Asian snail the size of a 
bread loaf, a ``kick-butt'' species that eats native clams and 
oysters. 
</P>
<P>
	``The last thing we want is a species that eats commercial  
shellfish. We're waiting with bated breath to see how abundant they 
get, and there's very little we can do to stop it,'' he said, 
speaking from Long Island Sound, where the nation's largest oyster 
industry fears the onset of the snail, first discovered last year 
off New Jersey. 
</P>
<P>
	Coast Guard rules, a result of the National Invasive Species Act  
of 1996, require reports on ballast samples for nearly all vessels 
entering U.S. waters after voyages from foreign ports. 
</P>
<P>
	Based on those reports, the voluntary ballast exchange could  
become mandatory in another three years, Lt. Cmdr. John Meehan 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're facing more invasions, there's no question about it,''  
said Carlton, who chairs a federal committee on ballast water 
exchange. ``Who wants to gamble?''

<HEADLINE> Book: Reagan At Best Facing Soviets </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- In the soon-to-recede darkness of the Cold  
War, Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev looked at Ronald Reagan and 
saw ``sunshine and clear sky.'' Reagan looked back, at a man he was 
trying not to like, and thought he saw his first communist leader 
interested in peace. 
</P>
<P>
	Reagan's authorized biography, an advance copy of which was  
obtained by The Associated Press, provides a close-up view of the 
clouds that descended on Reagan in the final years of his 
presidency, thanks to the Iran-Contra scandal and apparent mental 
strain. 
</P>
<P>
	But when it came to the Soviet Union, at least, his blend of  
toughness and optimism seemed to carry him through. ``Of course,'' 
he told biographer Edmund Morris when asked if he believes in the 
power of human goodness. ``That's what it's all about.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Dutch: A Memoir of Ronald Reagan,'' will be on bookshelves  
Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	Americans have had to wait a long time to see the results of  
Morris' unusual access to Reagan during his second term from 1985 
to 1989. 
</P>
<P>
	In large measure, Reagan up close looks about the same as he has  
looked to skillful biographers a little farther from the action: a 
man who knew what he believed and wanted, sold it to the people, 
and both for better and worse, ``was not interested in anyone 
else's dreams,'' as Morris puts it. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think I'm an open book,'' Reagan said simply when Morris  
tried to plumb his psychological depths. 
</P>
<P>
	The book unwraps an interview with Reagan just as he was about  
to leave office, when, in Morris' opinion, the president was 
exhausted and no longer thinking straight. Yet Reagan spoke with 
the same mix of resolve and callousness that endeared him to fans 
and infuriated critics for years. 
</P>
<P>
	Disdainful of Lyndon Johnson's old worry that a misstep could  
start a nuclear conflagration, Reagan exclaimed that a show of 
military force when needed came with the territory. ``That's part 
of what this job is all about!'' he said. ``How could he have sat 
there, living in fear that somehow he might trigger a war?'' 
</P>
<P>
	Turning to the homelessness that marred the economic growth of  
his decade, Reagan said dismissively that ``more than 40 percent of 
them are retarded, mentally deficient people'' who choose that way 
of life. 
</P>
<P>
	Morris writes that when the Reagans decided in November 1994 to  
tell the public of the former president's recent diagnosis of 
Alzheimer's Disease, family, friends and doctors impressed upon him 
the need to write the letter himself and in his own handwriting. 
</P>
<P>
	Sullen at first, then resigned, Morris said, Reagan shut himself  
in his study and penned the haunting note about ``the journey that 
will lead me into the sunset of my life.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Morris quotes Nancy Reagan as telling him her husband went  
downhill quickly after that letter. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Reagan, caring for her husband in California, has so far  
declined comment on material leaked from the book. 
</P>
<P>
	Reagan is presented as largely surefooted with Gorbachev,  
despite a long-known episode of breathtaking spontaneity at the 
1986 Reykjavik, Iceland, summit, when the leaders almost talked 
themselves into giving up nuclear weapons altogether. 
</P>
<P>
	Asked what he saw in Reagan's eyes when they first met at Geneva  
arms talks in 1985, Gorbachev told the author: ``Sunshine and clear 
sky. We shook hands like friends. He said something, I don't know 
what. But at once I felt him a very authentic human being.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Reagan, for his part, mused: ``You could almost get to like the  
guy. I keep telling myself I mustn't do it, because he could 
turn.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Rough, often angry, but ultimately successful negotiations  
followed in Geneva, with Reagan holding firm on his Strategic 
Defense Initiative, as he would throughout his term to the enduring 
opposition of the Soviets. 
</P>
<P>
	``Why don't you believe us when we say we will not use weapons  
against you?'' Morris quotes Gorbachev as asking, building the 
account from aides who were inside the room. 
</P>
<P>
	``Why don't you believe that all I want is a shield?'' Reagan  
responded. 
</P>
<P>
	``Please answer me -- what is your answer?'' Gorbachev said.  
</P>
<P>
	``I am answering,'' said Reagan, ``with a question for you.''  
</P>
<P>
	A muddled Reagan is portrayed in the Iran-Contra matter. Morris  
attended a November 1986 session where aides prepared Reagan for a 
news conference where he attempted to explain away the unfolding 
controversy over the gambit to win the release of hostages with 
secret arms sales to Iran -- a news conference later rated a 
disaster. 
</P>
<P>
	In the prep session, Reagan stated the CIA was not involved.  
``Yes, sir, they were,'' Adm. John Poindexter corrected him. 
</P>
<P>
	Reagan estimated the sales to be worth $1 billion. ``Much less,  
Mr. President,'' a worried Poindexter is quoted as saying. ``Don't 
get into specifics.'' 
</P>
<P>
	At the news conference, Reagan denied Israel's involvement as an  
intermediary, prompting the White House to issue a clarification 
later. 
</P>
<P>
	Morris reached no firm conclusions on Reagan's role in the  
illicit transfer of money to the Nicaraguan Contras from the arms 
sales, saying he suspects the president ``did authorize the 
transfer, not having the smallest comprehension of the laws he was 
subverting.''

<HEADLINE> Rarely Seen JFK Notes on Display </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BOSTON (AP) -- Before selecting the title ``Profiles in  
Courage,'' John F. Kennedy considered naming his book on political 
heroism the considerably less inspiring ``Call the Roll'' and 
``Eight were Courageous.'' 
</P>
<P>
	As he prepared his famous ``Berlin Wall'' speech, he  
phonetically spelled out what would become memorable words: ``Ish 
bin ein Bearleener.'' 
</P>
<P>
	And, with a last-minute scratch of the pen, the nation's 35th  
president spontaneously turned the turgid line, ``When power 
intoxicates, poetry restores sobriety,'' into the more lyrical, 
``When power corrupts -- poetry cleanses.'' 
</P>
<P>
	These and other first drafts of history are among the original  
documents and memorabilia featured in ``Treasures of the John F. 
Kennedy Library'' an upcoming exhibit at the John F. Kennedy 
Library and Museum. 
</P>
<P>
	Organized to celebrate the 20th anniversary of the presidential  
museum, the exhibit of Kennedy's handwritten notes, personal 
effects and gifts from other world leaders will run Oct. 9 through 
May 1. 
</P>
<P>
	The exhibit of rarely displayed artifacts includes an original  
copy of a handwritten pep-talk to the young president from former 
President Harry S. Truman. 
</P>
<P>
	``Mr. President don't let these damned columnists and editorial  
writers discourage you ... You meet 'em, cuss 'em and give 'em hell 
and you'll win in 1964,'' Truman wrote in an August 1962 note. 
</P>
<P>
	The museum will also display the original draft of Kennedy's  
legendary ``Ask not what your country can do for you...'' inaugural 
speech, as well as two pages of notes that show the president 
tweaked with text that had read, ``Ask not what your country is 
going to do for you.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In a letter to his sister, Eunice Kennedy Shriver, Kennedy was  
uncertain what to name his book about elected officials who made 
unpopular political stands. 
</P>
<P>
	``Dear Eunice: Would you and Sarge (husband Sargent Shriver) and  
your friends mull over the following suggested titles for the book 
and let me know as soon as possible which you think is the best: 1. 
Men of Courage, 2. Eight were Courageous, 3. Call the Roll, 4. 
Profiles of Courage,'' Kennedy wrote in July 1955, shortly before 
the book was published. 
</P>
<P>
	It's unclear what counsel his sister provided, but ``Profiles in  
Courage'' earned Kennedy the Pulitzer Prize in 1956. 
</P>
<P>
	Jewels and gifts from other world leaders are also included.  
</P>
<P>
	One prize is a ruby and diamond broach, bought by Kennedy at  
Tiffany's in New York City for his wife, Jacqueline, who wore it at 
his inauguration. Mrs. Kennedy's emerald and diamond engagement 
ring is also on display. 
</P>
<P>
	A tea set presented to Mrs. Kennedy by Nina Khrushchev, wife of  
the Soviet premier, as well as a jeweled bracelet given to the 
first lady by King Hassan II of Morocco will also be shown. 
</P>
<P>
	And above the jewels and priceless documents, exhibition  
organizers said, will hang an enlarged copy of a poignant symbol 
drawn by Kennedy himself -- a whimsical doodle of the presidential 
seal.

	After his poor play contributed to two American losses on the  
first day of play, he sat out on Saturday morning. But in the 
afternoon, he teamed with Tom Lehman to give the United States its 
only victory in the four best-ball matches. 
</P>
<P>
	That was surprising for a golfer who long had been considered an  
outstanding putter, was 4-1-2 in his two previous Ryder Cups and is 
the world's 13th-ranked player. 
</P>
<P>
	He had to change something.  
</P>
<P>
	So he decided to go back to a putter he had used in the past.  
</P>
<P>
	``I hadn't used it for the last eight months, but I needed a  
different look,'' he said. ``I needed a little more confidence.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Mickelson's putting performance Friday was enough to shatter the  
confidence of even a weekend duffer. It hardly seemed appropriate 
for a golfer who had finished second in the U.S. Open and tied for 
sixth in the Masters this year. 
</P>
<P>
	Paired with David Duval in the alternate-shot round, Mickelson  
missed three putts inside 6 feet in a 3 and 2 loss to Colin 
Montgomerie and Paul Lawrie. In the afternoon, Mickelson twice had 
a chance to tie a best-ball match, but he missed a 4-foot birdie 
putt on the 16th, and an 8-foot putt on the final hole. 
</P>
<P>
	Yet he minimized the importance of Saturday's improved play on  
his attitude. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't know,'' Mickelson said. ``It was just important to get  
off to a good start.'' 
</P>
<P>
	That's what he and Lehman did as they won the third hole to go  
1-up on Darren Clarke and Lee Westwood then won the eighth and 
10th. They were 3-up after 15, lost the 16th but closed out the 
match by halving the 17th to win 2 and 1. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, the Americans were in a big hole going into Sunday's 12  
head-to-head matches. The Europeans, leading 10-6 after two days, 
need to win just four of them to retain the Cup they won in 
Valderrama in 1997. To take it away, the Americans must have at 
least 14 1/2 of the total 28 points. 
</P>
<P>
	The United States actually goes into the final day in better  
shape than it did two years ago when it trailed 10 1/2-5 1/2. At first, 
Mickelson didn't recall that score. 
</P>
<P>
	``So we're worse off than we were at Valderrama?'' he asked  
after Saturday's match. 
</P>
<P>
	He was told that was incorrect.  
</P>
<P>
	``Nice,'' he said.  
</P>
<P>
	On Sunday, he should be fresh since, after playing two matches  
Friday, he took Saturday morning's alternate-shot match off. 
</P>
<P>
	Shortly before Mickelson's afternoon match, U.S. captain Ben  
Crenshaw tried to pump him up. 
</P>
<P>
	``I told Phil this afternoon to trust his putting stroke,''  
Crenshaw said. ``I told him, `Make it sweep and hit it solid.' All 
he needs to do is for one or two to go down, and he's off.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The advice -- and the morning rest -- apparently helped.  
</P>
<P>
	``It wasn't hard to sit. I anticipated sitting one match  
anyway,'' Mickelson said. ``There's a lot of pressure on every hole 
in alternate shot to make a four-footer for your partner. I didn't 
want to deal with that yet. I feel like after making a few putts 
today that I'm ready for singles.''

<HEADLINE> McCain Criticizes Bush on Buchanan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Republican presidential hopeful Sen. John  
McCain accused George W. Bush, the party's front-runner, of 
``sacrificing our principles'' by refusing to condemn Pat 
Buchanan's views on Adolf Hitler and Nazi Germany. 
</P>
<P>
	``Like Governor Bush, I want to see a united Republican Party,''  
McCain said in a statement Saturday. ``But no political campaign is 
worth sacrificing our principles.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In an interview Friday with The Associated Press, Bush said he  
does not want Buchanan to leave the Republican Party and seek the 
Reform Party nomination for president. 
</P>
<P>
	Bush did not join other Republican and conservative leaders who  
have attacked Buchanan over his campaign book, ``A Republic, Not an 
Empire.'' The book questions the timing of the United States' entry 
into World War II because, Buchanan said, Germany was no threat to 
the United States after 1940. 
</P>
<P>
	``America has always stood ready to fight tyranny and  
oppression. The Republican Party has always stood for freedom,'' 
said McCain, R-Ariz. 
</P>
<P>
	``I urge all of the Republican presidential candidates to let it  
be known that there is no place in our party for anyone who would 
reject these principles. Our party must take a strong and forceful 
stand against the kind of language that threatens our commitment to 
freedom and democracy for all.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Mindy Tucker, a Bush spokeswoman, denied that the Texas governor  
has coddled Buchanan. 
</P>
<P>
	``Governor Bush has made it clear that he strongly disagrees  
with Pat Buchanan on this issue,'' she said. ``He believes we were 
fighting on the side of freedom and justice, and Republican voters 
will have a chance to express their opinion in the primaries.'' 
</P>
<P>
	McCain said he was disappointed by the reaction of his fellow  
candidates. ``By continuing to appease Buchanan, several of our 
candidates appear to have put politics ahead of our party's 
principles.'' 
</P>

	ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) -- Hillary Rodham Clinton still is not an  
official U.S. Senate candidate, but she seemed Saturday to drop any 
pretense that she might not be in the race. 
</P>
<P>
	``I want you to know that if I was leaning any more toward it, I  
would fall over right in front of you,'' Mrs. Clinton told a crowd 
in Albany's Washington Park chanting, ``Run, Hillary, run.'' 
</P>
<P>
	This came hours after the first lady debuted that line and gave  
a campaign-style speech to the Schenectady County Democratic 
Committee, which in April became the first such organization to 
endorse her possible candidacy. 
</P>
<P>
	``The kind of candidate I would be, the kind of senator I would  
be, is one who would represent the entire state and everyone who 
lives here,'' she told cheering Democrats at the Schenectady 
Museum. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Clinton is looking at the Senate seat being vacated next  
year by Democrat Daniel Patrick Moynihan. On the Republican side, 
New York City Mayor Rudolph Giuliani is considering a run. 
</P>
<P>
	In New York City, about 100 Republicans held a ``Go Home  
Hillary'' rally Saturday on Fifth Avenue. 
</P>

<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Teamsters leader James P. Hoffa ruled himself  
out Saturday as a running mate for Pat Buchanan if the Reform Party 
should choose Buchanan as its presidential candidate. 
</P>
<P>
	Buchanan, a television commentator, is seeking the Republican  
nomination but is widely expected to quit the GOP and seek the 
Reform Party nod. 
</P>
<P>
	In a statement, Hoffa said he told Buchanan Saturday that ``I am  
not interested at this time in playing a role in presidential 
politics, except as an advocate for Teamster members.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Before the workers of America need a Teamster leader involved  
in presidential politics, they need a Teamsters union restored to 
its former strength,'' said Hoffa, the Teamsters president. 
</P>
<P>
	Hoffa's name came up a couple of weeks ago as Buchanan was  
reported considering possible running mates. Hoffa spokesman Chip 
Roth said no offer had been made at the time.

	SYDNEY, Australia (AP) -- World men's modern pentathlon champion  
Sebastien Deleigne of France assured himself of a place at next 
year's Olympics with a victory in the World Cup final Saturday at 
Homebush Bay. 
</P>
<P>
	Deleigne won the 1997 and 1998 world titles, but finished fifth  
in Budapest last July when Hungarian Gabor Balogh won the world 
championship. 
</P>
<P>
	The 32-year-old Deleigne became the third to qualify for the  
Olympics after Balogh and another Hungarian, Peter Sarfalvi, the 
European champion. 
</P>
<P>
	Deleigne notched the highest score in the next-to-last riding  
discipline and the second-best total in the closing 3-kilometer run 
at the Olympic test event. 
</P>
<P>
	He started the run in third place, 22 seconds and 91 points  
behind competition leader Per-Olov Danielsson of Sweden, but caught 
the 30-year-old Swede after two of the four laps and won by 40 
seconds. 
</P>
<P>
	Deleigne had 5,408 points to finish ahead of Danielsson with  
5,339 and Russian Alexei Tourkin with 5,286.

<HEADLINE> Anti-Apartheid Fighter Seeks Amnesty </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	JOHANNESBURG, South Africa (AP) -- In a high-profile test for  
South Africa's reconciliation process, a panel this week hears the 
amnesty plea of a senior government official who waged a deadly 
bombing campaign when he was an anti-apartheid guerrilla. 
</P>
<P>
	Robert McBride, a director in the Foreign Ministry, is seeking  
amnesty for the 1986 bombing of a beachfront bar in Durban that 
killed three people and wounded 73, the bombing of an electrical 
substation that killed one policeman and injured four and a raid -- 
in which one person was killed and five wounded -- on a hospital 
that freed a wounded African National Congress guerrilla. 
</P>
<P>
	Underscoring how sensitivities remain raw five years after white  
rule ended with South Africa's first all-race elections, McBride's 
father Derrick McBride -- who also was an ANC guerrilla -- withdrew 
his amnesty application for the hospital raid. 
</P>
<P>
	In a letter to the Truth and Reconciliation Commission, Derrick  
McBride complained that some of the commission's judges had served 
under the former apartheid government. 
</P>
<P>
	``I will not allow them to stand in judgment over me,'' the  
letter said, the South African Press Association reported. ``I will 
never be judged by the same standards as those who maintained and 
supported apartheid,'' 
</P>
<P>
	``I ask the public and the (Truth Commission) to consider what  
their attitude would have been to the establishment of a court, or 
quasi court, which judged the actions of the Nazis in the same way 
it judged the actions of those who resisted in the concentration 
camps,'' the elder McBride was quoted as saying. 
</P>
<P>
	The argument hits the crux of complaints from many leaders of  
the ANC, which led the anti-apartheid struggle and which governs 
South Africa today. When the Truth Commission in its report last 
year criticized the ANC for torturing suspected spies and 
dissidents and planting explosives that killed innocent civilians, 
the ANC argued that it had fought ``a just war'' against the evil 
of apartheid and that it was wrong to equate its actions with those 
of the white security forces. 
</P>
<P>
	As president, Nelson Mandela had preached reconciliation and  
gave full backing to the Truth Commission's work, putting him at 
odds with some fellow party leaders. 
</P>
<P>
	Robert McBride, who is of mixed race, remains a controversial  
figure. He had few words for the meida on Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm busy because there are 13 years of records we're going  
through,'' McBride told The Associated Press. He said he was 
meeting with his lawyer and didn't have time to talk further. 
</P>
<P>
	In March 1998 he was arrested in neighboring Mozambique and  
charged gunrunning and espionage. After spending six months in a 
Mozambican jail he was acquitted, claiming he had been working 
undercover with South Africa's National Intelligence Agency to 
investigate gunrunning. NIA officials denied McBride was working 
for the spy agency. 
</P>
<P>
	At the time, McBride headed the Foreign Ministry's Asian desk.  
He is now a director in the Foreign Ministry's Operational Center, 
which handles crises worldwide for the ministry. 
</P>
<P>
	McBride spent six years on death row in South Africa for the  
Durban bar bombing but was freed under a 1992 amnesty. 
</P>
<P>
	Eight other former members of the ANC's military wing are  
seeking amnesty along with McBride for a series of attacks, most of 
which occurred in and around Durban. 
</P>
<P>
	The amnesty hearings begin on Monday in the port city on the  
Indian Ocean. 
</P>
<P>
	The Truth Commission can grant amnesty to those who fully  
confess to politically motivated crimes.

<HEADLINE> Red Sox 4, Orioles 1  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BOSTON (AP) -- Brian Daubach became just the third left-handed  
batting rookie in Red Sox history to reach 20 homers, and Ramon 
Martinez pitched seven strong innings as Boston moved closer to the 
AL wild card with a 4-1 win over the Baltimore Orioles on Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
	The victory snapped Boston's three-game losing streak and cut  
its magic number in the wild-card race to four over Oakland, which 
played at Texas later. 
</P>
<P>
	The Orioles, who lost for just the second time in 17 games, had  
a 10-game road winning streak halted. Baltimore's club record was 
11, set in 1978. 
</P>
<P>
	Scott Hatteberg hit a solo homer leading off the third and added  
an RBI single the eighth. Butch Huskey also homered for the Red 
Sox. 
</P>
<P>
	Martinez (1-1), making just his third start since shoulder  
surgery cut short his season last June with Los Angeles, gave up 
four hits and one run in a bid to make the club's postseason 
roster. 
</P>
<P>
	Martinez, the older brother of Red Sox ace Pedro, was signed  
during spring training as a free agent. He was a longshot to make 
the team's postseason staff when he made his first start Sept. 2, 
but now is a candidate to start Game 3 or 4 of the division series. 
</P>
<P>
	Rich Garces pitched two perfect innings for his second save,  
striking out four. 
</P>
<P>
	Doug Linton (1-3) gave up three runs and four hits in six-plus  
innings. 
</P>
<P>
	Nomar Garciappara went 0-for-2 with a walk and a hit by pitch to  
drop his league-leading average to .355. 
</P>
<P>
	Daubach homered into the left-field screen in the fourth to give  
Boston a 2-1 lead, joining Fred Lynn (1975) and Hall of Famer Ted 
Williams (1931) as left-handed batting rookies with 20 or more 
homers. He was just 2-for-32 in September before the homer. 
</P>
<P>
	Hatteberg's first homer of the year put Boston in front 1-0.  
Huskey's 22nd made it 3-1 in the seventh. 
</P>
<P>
	The Orioles tied the game 1-1 in the fourth when Mike Bordick  
singled, went to third on B.J. Surhoff's single and scored on 
Albert Belle's double-play grounder. 
</P>
<P>
	Martinez also escaped a jam in the seventh when the Orioles had  
a runner on third with one out. 
</P>
<P>
 *Notes:* Boston general manager Dan Duquette said right-hander Mark  
Portugal, released unexpectedly Friday night, was let go because of 
``his performance the second half of the season.'' Portugal lost 
his last four decisions and was 7-12 with a 5.51 ERA. He also 
allowed a team-high 28 homers. ... Red Sox right-hander Tom Gordon, 
sidelined most of the year with recurring elbow pain, was recalled 
from injury rehabilitation, but remains on the DL. He is expected 
to rejoin the club Sunday, but the team's future plans for him are 
uncertain. ... The Orioles' 10 straight road wins matched the 
second-most in team history, set in 1969 and '75. ... Baltimore was 
attempting to reach .500 for the first time this season.

<HEADLINE> Invasive Plant Threatens Flowers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Plant specialist Joan Feely once delighted in  
the variety of native wildflowers as she walked along the C&AMP;O Canal 
in suburban Montgomery County, Md. 
</P>
<P>
	Her mood has changed in the past 10 to 15 years. ``I'm so tense  
by the end of the walk because I'm thinking, 'Where are all the 
native plants?''' said Feely, curator of the native plant 
collection at the National Arboretum in Washington, D.C. 
</P>
<P>
	Plants from Europe and Asia are destroying native wildflowers  
``like a steam roller,'' Feely said. A top offender locally is 
garlic mustard, native to Europe and first recorded in the United 
States in 1868 on Long Island. It has spread as far south as 
Virginia and out west to Colorado and Oregon. Once garlic mustard 
moves into an area, Feely said, it steals light, water and space 
from spring beauty, wild ginger, bloodroot, toothworts, trilliums 
and other native wildflowers. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's almost no habitat you can go to in the spring of the  
year where you don't find it,'' said Stanwyn Shetler, curator of 
botany emeritus at the Smithsonian Institution's National Museum of 
Natural History. ``Each year there's a bit more of it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Garlic mustard appears in the spring as a rosette of leafy green  
leaves and blooms the following year with several small, white 
flowers. Each plant grows anywhere from 2- to 3 1/2-feet tall and 
produces thousands of seeds that are forcibly ejected when the pods 
split. 
</P>
<P>
	``If you walk through a patch when the pods are dry,'' Shetler  
said, ``you can hear the seeds popping out all over.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Jill Swearingen, a botanist and entomologist with the National  
Park Service, says you might find ``some sweet cicely, toothworts 
or other natives trying to poke their heads up. But for every one 
of those, there are several hundred garlic mustard.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The alien is killing more than just plants, Swearingen said. The  
West Virginia White Butterfly, unable to find its favorite 
toothwort to lay its eggs, is depositing them on garlic mustard. 
But garlic mustard is toxic to the butterfly, and its eggs are not 
hatching. 
</P>
<P>
	Several conservation groups are trying to rid natural areas of  
garlic mustard and other alien plants. 
</P>
<P>
	Marc Imlay, invasive exotic plants committee chairman for the  
Maryland Native Plant Society, said he's optimistic all five acres 
of garlic mustard can be pulled from the 20-acre Swann Memorial 
Park in Charles County, Md. In one day, he said, 12 volunteers 
pulled out about half of all the garlic mustard. 
</P>
<P>
	New seeds, however, already are in the ground, Imlay said. ``We  
know that it's going to come back,'' he said. ``It's a long-term 
commitment.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Shetler is not so optimistic. ``I'm afraid it's here to stay,''  
he said. ``The general task of ridding even one area of it is 
beyond imagination.''

<HEADLINE> 2002 Winter Olympic Mascots Named </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SALT LAKE CITY (AP) -- A rabbit named Powder, a coyote named  
Copper and a bear called Coal are the new mascots for the 2002 
Winter Olympics. 
</P>
<P>
	And Salt Lake organizers hope the furry critters, whose names  
were announced Saturday, bring the kind of money to the games that 
Utah's skiing, copper industry, coal mining have brought the state. 
</P>
<P>
	The names were revealed just a day after the Salt Lake  
Organizing Committee announced that toy maker Mattel Inc. would 
make stuffed versions of the mascots in a deal guaranteed to 
generate at least $1 million. The stuffed animals will go on sale 
as early as this holiday season in Utah for $10 to $40. 
</P>
<P>
	The snowshoe hare, coyote and bear, all characters in western  
Indian myth, first appeared in May. They were scheduled to debut in 
February, but the scandal of excessive wooing of International 
Olympic Committee members by Salt Lake bidders to win the games 
stalled the festivities. 
</P>
<P>
	After the unveiling, SLOC took suggestions for names from 42,000  
Utah schoolchildren, whittled the selections down, and opened them 
up to a nationwide vote. The other options were Sky, Cliff and 
Shadow or Arrow, Bolt and Rocky. 
</P>
<P>
	SLOC President Mitt Romney said the chosen names represent Utah,  
with ``Powder'' symbolizing the state's claim to ``the greatest 
snow on earth'' and ``Copper'' and ``Coal'' representing the land. 
</P>
<P>
	But the mascots are also meant to represent the Latin Olympic  
motto: ``Citius, Altius, Fortius,'' or ``Swifter, Higher, 
Stronger,'' with the rabbit moving swiftly, the coyote climbing 
high, and the bear representing strength. In addition, each mascot 
wears a charm around its neck modeled after the rock drawings of 
Utah's ancient tribes. 
</P>
<P>
	The mascots' names were announced during halftime at BYU's  
football game against Virginia in Provo.
