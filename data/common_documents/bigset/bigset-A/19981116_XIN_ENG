<HEADLINE> Zimbabwean Students Leader Willing to Work </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, November 15 (Xinhua) -- Zimbabwe's student leader
Edwin Mwanza Sunday said he will strive to change the negative
image of the country's students during his term of office.
</P>
<P>
In an interview with the Zimbabwe News Agency, Edwin Mwanza,
newly-elected Leader of the Students Representative Council, said
he will strive to change the society's perception that students
are not interested in academic pursuit, but in causing trouble.
</P>
<P>
During the past few months, students from the institutions of
higher learning have engaged in various demonstrations and
protests, some of them violent, over a number of issues of
concern to them.
</P>
<P>
Mwanza said, "Our main thrush will be to change the image of
students by steering it in a new direction, away from the
commonly held view that students are merely hooligans bent on
disrupting the fabric of society."
</P>
<P>
"We would also like to change the hostile nature of the
relationship between students and our mother ministry so that we
can come together and attack common problems," he said.
</P>
<P>
Mwanza, however, pointed out that students have a role to play
in ensuring good governance and will not refrain from commenting
on the country's socio-political issues whenever necessary.

<HEADLINE> India Calls for Int'l Consensus on Banning Landmines </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, November 15 (Xinhua) -- India Sunday called for
building an international consensus on banning anti-personnel
landmines while pledging its support for an eventual ban on the
landmines as favored by Ottawa Treaty in 1997.
</P>
<P>
Ajit Kumar, director of disarmament and international security
affairs under the Ministry of External Affairs, explained Indian
policy on landmine ban and Ottawa Treaty, according to the Press
Trust of India.
</P>
<P>
India had reservations on the treaty, which calls for
prohibition on use, stockpiling, production and transfer of
anti-personnel landmines, since some developed nations including
the United States do not subscribe to the treaty due to security
reasons, said the official.
</P>
<P>
However, India would strive for an eventual ban on the
landmines, Kumar said at a national meeting on anti-personnel
landmines jointly organized by Indian Center for Humanitarian Laws
and Research and the International Committee of the Red Cross
which was opened Saturday in Hyderabad, 1,500 kilometers south of
here.
</P>
<P>
India favored a step by step approach which would involve a ban
on all transfers of the landmines, thus institutionalizing the
present unilateral export moratorium announced by several
countries, he said.
</P>
<P>
He said India was prepared to take part in the negotiations in
the conference on disarmament in Geneva next year to negotiate a
ban on transfer of landmines and was in process of ratifying
amended protocol (II) of the 1980 Inhuman Weapon Convention.

International Trade and Industry Minister.

<HEADLINE> Security Council to Meet Again on Iraq After </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, November 15 (Xinhua) -- The U.N. Security
Council decided to meet again on Iraq on Sunday afternoon
following the rare weekend closed-door consultations, which ran
some six hours into Saturday night, failed to produce any
agreement on how to solve the current Iraqi standoff.
</P>
<P>
The president of the Security Council for the month of
November, Peter Burleigh of the United States, said the 15 council
members would begin to meet again behind closed doors at 3:30 p.m.
EST on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
During Saturday's council session, Nizar Hamdoon, Iraqi
permanent representative to the United Nations, submitted three
drafts of a letter on approval from his government that said
previous decisions restricting cooperation with the inspectors
"have become void." His letters are being considered by council
member overnight and studied in the capitals.
</P>
<P>
However, Washington was seeking a clear statement that Iraq had
rescinded its August 5 and October 31 decisions to ban all U.N.
arms inspectors from their disarmament mission.
</P>
<P>
As the Security Council met on Saturday afternoon with most
of its members still hoping to seek a peaceful solution, the
United States is stepping up its efforts to increase the
military buildup in the Gulf.
</P>
<P>
The present crisis with Iraq, which came on the heels of a year
of confrontations, has its roots in a decision by Iraq on August 5
to curtail cooperation with inspectors who are supposed to scrap
Iraq's biological, chemical and prohibited missile systems.
</P>
<P>
In early September, the Security Council responded with a
resolution that ended all further sanctions reviews, and therefore
hopes of having the embargo lifted, until weapons inspections
resumed.
</P>
<P>
In the meantime, the Security Council and U.N.
Secretary-General Kofi Annan were working on plans for a
comprehensive review of Iraq's relations with the United Nations,
going back to 1990 invasion of Kuwait, when sanctions were
imposed.
</P>
<P>
Iraq has also made demands about how the review should be conducted.
</P>
<P>
On October 30, the Security Council laid out its plans for
conducting a comprehensive review. It did not promise more than
a new look at sanctions after Iraq had met all its disarmament
requirements.
</P>
<P>
The next day, Baghdad announced a decision to shut down the
inspection systems entirely. The U.N. Special Commission, known as
UNSCOM in charge of disarming Iraq, decided to pull its staff out
Iraq on "strong recommendation" from the U.S. Government.

<HEADLINE> SADC's Macro-Economic Situation Improving </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, November 15 (Xinhua) -- Despite high interest rates,
inflation and unstable exchange rates in some southern African
economies, the macro-economic situation in the region is
improving, Says a Zimbabwean business magazine.
</P>
<P>
The opening up of markets as well as globalisation have
created new opportunities for domestic and international
investors, says the November issue of Megabuck, a Zimbabwean
business magazine released here Sunday.
</P>
<P>
"A number of Southern African Development Community (SADC)
governments now understand the necessity to make strategic
alliances with the private sector as partners in development," it
says.
</P>
<P>
"Clear-cut rulers and fair laws are, however, needed to govern
this partnership," says Megabuck.
</P>
<P>
According to the magazine, almost half of SADC's 400
development projects were in transport and communications which
are central to a competitive region.
</P>
<P>
"While a basic network of transport and communication is now
linking all SADC member states, there are opportunities to create
a more efficient and cost effective infranstructure which will
lead to a high level of regional economic development and
integration," says the magazine.
</P>
<P>
To effectively exploit opportunities, it said, it is important
to be competitive for the SADC states through market-based
economic policies, appropriate legal and institutional frameworks
and deepening financial and capital markets.
</P>
<P>
it is also crucial to improve the quality and efficience of
infrstructure, increase spending on resourch and development and
allocate more resources to human resource development, the
magazine says.

although Iraq rescinded its decision to halt cooperation with

He said that there was a unprecedented consensus on

<TEXT>
<P>
MOGADISHU, November 15 (Xinhua) -- More than 26 children under
six years have died for cerebral malaria and measles in the past
four days in Galgudud Region, central Somalia, reports reaching
here said Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Ali Geddi Afrah, a traditional leader in Adado district, told
reporters via VHF radio that more than 37 people mainly children
and pregnant women are in critical condition after they were hit
by serious malaria which emerged immediately after the rainy Deyr
season began.
</P>
<P>
Afrah also said the pregnant women can not take the
chloroquine tablets mainly used for treating malaria and there
are no alternative medicines.
</P>
<P>
Another obstacle which is also increasing the death toll is
the shortage of medicine accompanied by the traditional behavior
which prohibits the use of all kinds of medicines against the
measles especially in its embryonic stages.
</P>
<P>
Governor of Galgudud Region, Yussuf Hassan Eyow, also spoke
about the health problems which his people are facing at this
particular time.
</P>
<P>
Eyow said that local authorities in different districts of the
region are also complaining about serious skin diseases such as
scabies but people have no dermatologists to tackle this problem.
</P>
<P>
The governor and the traditional leaders in the region are
calling on the international humanitarian agencies to intervene
in the plight in central Somalia.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Pulls Back from Military Confrontation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, November 15 (Xinhua) -- U.S. President Bill Clinton
pulled back Sunday from a military confrontation but demanded Iraq
live up to all its obligations.
</P>
<P>
He told a press conference at the White House before noon that
Iraq had backed down from its defiance of U.N. weapons inspectors
but Iraqi unconditional cooperation with the UNSCOM must
be assured.
</P>
<P>
"Iraq has backed down, but that is not enough. Now Iraq must
live up to its obligations," Clinton announced over 10 hours
after Iraqi President Saddam Hussein made public the decision to
resume cooperation with the U.N. weapons inspectors.
</P>
<P>
Clinton said that Iraq must allow the inspectors to do their
work without restrictions or conditions, warning "We remain ready
to act."
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, U.S. military buildup continued with more troops
and aircraft being sent to the Persian Gulf.
</P>
<P>
President Clinton said that Iraq must grant "unfettered access"
to any site that the inspectors wish to review and turn over all
documents relevant to the chemical and biological weapons
production.
</P>
<P>
With Defense Secretary William Cohen and General Hugh Shelton,
chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff standing by his side, the
president said:" Our willingness to strike together with the
overwhelming weight of world opinion produced the outcome we
preferred -- Saddam Hussein reversing course."
</P>
<P>
"The return of the inspectors, if they can operate in an
unfettered way, is the best outcome," Clinton added.

<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, November 15 (Xinhua) -- U.S. President Bill Clinton
said here Sunday that to resume unfettered U.N. weapons inspection
without using force against Iraq is "the best outcome."
</P>
<P>
"The return of the inspectors, if they can operate in an
unfettered way, is the best outcome," Clinton told a press
conference at the White House before noon.
</P>
<P>
Iraq halted its cooperation with the UNSCOM two weeks ago and
rescinded its decision Saturday in response to calls by U.N. chief
Koffi Annan and some other world leaders. The U.S. military has
been building up in the Persian Gulf over the past week.
</P>
<P>
Clinton said:"Iraq has backed down, but that is not enough. Now
Iraq must live up to its obligations."
</P>
<P>
Iraq must allow the inspectors to do their work without
restrictions or conditions, warning "We remain ready to act."
</P>
<P>
Despite the deep skepticism that President Saddam Hussein of
Iraq would end his "cat and mouse" game with the U.S., President
Clinton believed that holding back from a military strike was the
smart long-term strategy.
</P>
<P>
"If we take military action, we can significantly degrade Saddam
Hussein's ability to develop weapons of mass destruction and to
deliver them, but that would also mark the end of UNSCOM's
inspections," Clinton argued.
</P>
<P>
President Clinton said that Iraq must grant "unfettered access"
to any site that the inspectors wish to review and turn over all
documents relevant to the chemical and biological weapons
production.
</P>
<P>
The president said that it was more important to continue
gathering information about Iraq's weapons program because he
believed "over the next 10 to 20 years this whole issue of
chemical and biological weapons will be one of the major threats
facing the world."
</P>
<P>
With Defense Secretary William Cohen and General Hugh Shelton,
chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff standing by his side, the
president said:" Our willingness to strike together with the
overwhelming weight of world opinion produced the outcome we
preferred -- Saddam Hussein reversing course."
</P>
<P>
The U.N. Security Council is to meet this afternoon to continue
reviewing the situation. Its last night deliberation failed to
reach a consensus with the U.S. and Britain rejecting the Iraqi
offer.
</P>
<P>
It was believed that Clinton's latest statement would make it
easier to find a way out of the current Gulf crisis.

<HEADLINE> Hoax Emergency Call Costs UK Dearly </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>

<P>
LONDON, November 15 (Xinhua) -- Up to 80 percent of emergency
calls in Britain are made unnecessarily, putting lives at risk every
day, the Association of Chief Police Officers said Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Misuse of Britain's emergency services telephone number --
including hoaxes and non-urgent inquiries -- is also costing
millions of pounds every year, according to the figures revealed by
the association.
</P>
<P>
Of 7.6 million calls made to police last year, about six million
did not require an immediate response, it said.
</P>
<P>
The figures come two months after Kent Police threatened to cut
off the phones of callers who frequently abuse the emergency call
999 service.
</P>
<P>
Chief Constable of Sussex Paul Whitehouse said misuse of the
service creates a "very grave danger".
</P>
<P>
"It is possible that lives could be put in danger if a
significant number of improper 999 calls are made at the same time,"
he said.
</P>
<P>
The cost of the 100,000 hoax calls made nationally every year is
estimated at 20 million pounds (33 million U.S. dollars).

<HEADLINE> UNSCOM to Go Back to Iraq with Ripe Conditions, </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW YORK, November 15 (Xinhua) -- U.N. arms inspectors,
currently waiting in Bahrain, would return to Iraq on their job
within some 24 hours if "conditions are ripe for us to move
forward," a chief weapons inspector said on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Richard Burtler, chairman of the U.N. Special Commission
(UNSCOM), told the Cable News Network (CNN), if the Security
Council makes a decision to resume arms inspections in Iraq, "I'll
proceed immediately to plan getting our people back into Iraq, I
wrote to the (U.N. Security) Council a few days ago, saying that
"Once we get the word of green light, we'll get back and begin
running again within about 24 hours."
</P>
<P>
The chief arms inspector made the remarks following an Iraqi
announcement on Saturday to engage in unconditional cooperation
with the U.N. inspection teams and a latest statement by U.S.
President Bill Clinton that "Iraq has backed down, but that is not
enough."
</P>
<P>
Butler has turned down an appeal from most Security Council
members that UNSCOM should resume its work in Iraq at once, saying
he had to wait for a decision by the Security Council, U.N.
sources said, implying he is waiting for an Okay signal from
Washington.
</P>
<P>
The Security Council, ending some six hours of closed-door
consultations on Saturday night without any agreement, would meet
again in rare weekend meeting on Iraq at 3:30 p.m. EST on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Butler, on what he said the "strong recommendation" from the
U.S. Government, decided in the middle of last week to evacuate
his staff out of Iraq in anticipation of imminent possible U.S.
military strikes.
</P>
<P>
The withdrawal decision, taken without consultations with 15
Security Council members, had come under fire from China, France
and Russia, three permanent Council members, who have been
intensifying their efforts to seek a peaceful solution and strongly
opposing the U.S. efforts to continue to increase its military
buildup in the Gulf.
</P>
<P>
Iraq made a show of backing down on Saturday in a letter to
U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan, saying that it would resume
full cooperation with arms inspectors.

<HEADLINE> Burkina Faso's Presidential Poll Ends Without </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, November 15 (Xinhua)-- Voting in Burkina Faso's
presidential election passed off without incident on Sunday and
President Blaise Compaore seemed almost certain to win because of
a poll boycott by the main opposition parties.
</P>
<P>
Around 4.2 million people were eligible to vote in the poll,
which began at 0600 gmt and ended at 1800 gmt, said a report
reaching here from Ouagadougou, capital of Burkina Faso.
</P>
<P>
Provisional results are likely to be announced early on Monday
with definitive figures due on November 18, the report quoted
election officials as saying.
</P>
<P>
Compaore, 47, in power since since 1987, faced opposition in
the polls for the first time, as two candidates have broken with
the opposition boycott to stand against him.
</P>
<P>
However, the report said, Ram Ouedraogo of the Greens Party
and Frederic Fernand Guirma of the Front of Refusal of the
Democratic African Assembly were expected to pose little threat,
so attention centred on how many people turned out for Compaore.
</P>
<P>
Turnout on Sunday in the capital Ouagadougou was described by
witnesses as low, especially in central areas, but national radio
reported a better turnout elsewhere in the west african country.
</P>
<P>
Compaore is running for a new seven-year term. He is backed by
the ruling Congress for Democracy and Progress which took 101 of
111 seats in the assembly in parliamentary elections in 1997.
Eight small parties also support him.

<HEADLINE> Pakistan to Urge Japan for Relaxing Economic </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, November 16 (Xinhua) -- Foreign Minister Sartaj Aziz
said Monday that Japan would be urged to relax economic
restrictions imposed on the flow of bilateral assistance to
Pakistan.
</P>
<P>
Talking to the media before his departure for Tokyo at
Islamabad airport, Aziz said Pakistan considers Japan as very
important country in total political and economic relationships.
</P>
<P>
The purpose of the visit is to brief Japan the background in
which Pakistan was forced to carry out nuclear tests, he added.
</P>
<P>
Answering a question, Aziz said he would avail the opportunity
to explain Pakistan's nuclear policy in the context of responding
international concerns and moratorium on further testing and
progress on negotiations with the U.S. about various aspects of
nuclear issues.
</P>
<P>
Sartaj said Japan would be urged to relax economic restriction
on bilateral assistance and its participation in multilateral
assistance to Pakistan.
</P>
<P>
Japan is believed to announce lifting of restriction on
bilateral assistance and participation in multilateral assistance
for Pakistan during Aziz's visit.
</P>
<P>
In the light of the U.S decision to lift economic sanctions
imposed on Pakistan, Japan will respond positively during Aziz's
three-day visit, diplomatic sources here said.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. announced last week lifting some of the sanctions
imposed on Pakistan and India in the wake of their nuclear blasts
in May this year.
</P>
<P>
The decision would clear the way for Pakistan and India to
receive aid from U.S. agencies and remove Washington's opposition
to annual aid to the two countries from the World Bank and
International Monetary Fund.

<P>
COLOMBO, November 16 (Xinhua) -- The Sri Lanka's New Leftist
Front plans to conduct talks with the Liberation Tigers of Tamil
Eelam (LTTE) to restore peace in the country.
</P>
<P>
The General Secretary of the newly formed front L. Jayathileka
said Monday that they have extended an invitation to the LTTE to
enter into a dialogue with them.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a news conference here, he said they were of the
view that the ethnic conflict should be settled with peace talks
with the LTTE.
</P>
<P>
W. B. Karunarathne, leader of the Nawa Sama Samaja Party
(NSSP), expressed hope that the LTTE might enter into negotiations
with the New Leftist Front.
</P>
<P>
The National Democratic Moment (NDM) leader Patrick Fernando is
of the view that the present peace process was highly unsuccessful
as the government initiative is inadequate.
</P>
<P>
The New Leftist Front recently formed here by the NSSP, NDM and
other left parties.
</P>
<P>
A seminar to create an awareness on the peace program of the
front among the people will take place in Colombo on Wednesday,
the front sources said.
</P>
<P>
Sri Lanka has long been plagued by problems between the
Sinhalese and Tamil -- the major ethnic groups in the country.
</P>
<P>
The LTTE has been fighting a war against the government since
1983 for a separate Tamil state in the north and east of the
country. Over 55,000 people have been killed in the war.

<HEADLINE> China's Aviation Administration Predicts Market Growth </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ZHUHAI, November 16 (Xinhua) -- The '98 China International Air
Show, which opened on Sunday, has brought Boeing, Airbus,
BMW-Rolls Royce, Daimler-Benz, and many other big companies to the
southern city of Zhuhai, Guangdong Province.
</P>
<P>
An official of the Civil Aviation Administration of China
(CAAC) says this is a proof that they are optimistic about China's
aviation market. CAAC estimates that air transport will grow at an
annual rate of 10 percent over the next two decades and will need
another 600 airplanes.
</P>
<P>
The two largest aircraft producers in the world, Boeing and
Airbus, have also shown confidence in China's market. In a market
report published earlier this year, Boeing said it expects to see
the world's fastest annual air transportation growth in China, at
9.5 percent, and the market expansion will mean the purchase of
1,800 planes, valued at 125 billion U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
A similar forecast was made by Airbus, Boeing's major
competitor. Annual growth in the Chinese market will be 6.8
percent in the next 20 years, compared with 5.1 percent in the
rest of the world, and 1,300 passenger planes will be needed.
</P>
<P>
Airbus had 11 aircraft on display at the show, which it is
either manufacturing or developing, with the A340-600 being
showcased.
</P>
<P>
Boeing had a new image at the show after the merger with
McDonnnell Douglas. Its focus was on the Boeing 717-200.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Premier Emphasizes Importance Of Grain Market Reform </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, November 16 (Xinhua) -- Premier Zhu Rongji said at a
national forum sponsored by the State Development Planning
Commission and the State Grain Reserve Bureau, from November
13-15, that restructuring the grain market system is a major
reform and that it is currently at a crucial stage.
</P>
<P>
Zhu asked all areas and departments to push the reforms in
accordance with the guideline of the recent Third Plenary Session
of the Fifteenth Central Committee of the Communist Party of China
(CPC).
</P>
<P>
He emphasized the importance of increasing farmers' initiative
and said that the country's success in maintaining rapid economic
growth, a stable Chinese currency, and social stability depended a
great deal on the success of the Party's agriculture policy.
</P>
<P>
The restructuring of the grain marketing system and developing
a new marketing system responding to the needs of the socialist
market economy and the country's particular situation will protect
and encourage the enthusiasm of farmers and reinforce the
agricultural base, and help the development of agriculture and
grain production, Zhu said.
</P>
<P>
He blamed some localities who have failed to implement the
policy of purchasing grain from farmers at protective prices, take
an effective control over local grain markets, crack down on
illegal private grain-dealers, and solve the problem of
money-losing and overstaffed state grain-purchasing stations.
</P>
<P>
"Grain is a key strategic goods related to the national
stability and people's daily life," he says, "there isn't any
country which dares to open up its grain market completely."

<P>
WASHINGTON, November 16 (Xinhua) -- The following are major
news items in leading U.S. newspapers Monday.
</P>
<P>
The New York Times
</P>
<P>
-- President Clinton said Sunday that President Saddam Hussein
has backed down, but that is not enough. Now Iraq must live up to
its obligations. He added that American and British forces that
nearly struck Iraq on Saturday will remain poised to act.
</P>
<P>
-- The Japanese government has ratcheted up to a monumental 195
billion dollar the size of a new economic stimulus package that it
announced this Saturday morning, making this the largest package
Japan has drawn up in eight years of economic malaise.
</P>
<P>
The Washington Post
</P>
<P>
-- President Clinton's decision on Saturday to abort planned
airstrikes against Iraq came over the recommendations of some of
his top national security advisers, who pressed to go ahead with
the attack despite initial reports of an Iraqi offer to surrender
to U.S. and the U.N. demand, administration officials said.
</P>
<P>
-- President Clinton's first explicit call for a "new
government" in Baghdad and his pledge to implement a new plan for
arming opponents of Iraqi President Saddam Hussein heartened
opposition leaders. But Clinton's comments appeared to signal more
of a heightened political effort to destabilize the Iraqi regime
over time than any immediate military strategy for overthrowing
it.
</P>
<P>
The Wall Street Journal
</P>
<P>
-- Delegates from 160 nations settled on a deadline at the end
of 2000 for completing most parts of a global-warming treaty.
Southern Co., an earlier opponent, shifted gears and said it
favored the pact despite reservations.
</P>
<P>
-- Rival Cambodian parties agreed to form a coalition
government, but strongman Hun Sen will remain the sole prime
minister. The deal, which excludes opposition leader Sam Rainsy,
was struck Friday by the regime and the royalist party of Prince
Ranariddh.

CAIRO, November 16 (Xinhua) -- The following are economic
briefs from Middle East countries.
</P>
<P>
DAMASCUS -- The Syrian government is working on a project
proposed by the Ministry of Economy to set up an office through
which shares of joint stock companies operating in Syria may be
traded, in view of the absence of a share trading market.
</P>
<P>
The office will encourage investment to such companies once it
undertakes duties. By classifying and monitoring these companies,
the office will reassure the share holders.
</P>
<P>
MUSCAT -- The EU countries have agreed to lift the ban on the
import of Omani fish by the end of December.
</P>
<P>
The "ban which obstructed the export of Omani fish to EU
markets constituted a great challenge," said Omani Minister of
Agriculture and Fisheries Khalfan Bin Saleh Al Na'ie.
</P>
<P>
Oman had taken a series of measures to meet the export
requirements and to confront the challenge, he added.
</P>
<P>
Khalfan said that an overall review of the law, systems and
procedures relating to fishing was conducted in order to conform
with and maintain the proficiency standards as required by the EU.
</P>
<P>
RABAT -- Morocco exported 1 billion dollar-worth of textiles
and ready-to-wear products during the first eight months of this
year, despite of intense competitions from southeast Asian
countries and the continuing loss of markets in the Middle East.
</P>
<P>
Export volume of textiles, leather and ready-to-wear clothes
stood at 9.16 billion Moroccan dirhams (nearly 1 billion
U.S. dollars), up by 4 per cent over the corresponding period of
last year, said an official statistics report.
</P>
<P>
Export volume of clothes accounted for about 22 percent of the
total.
</P>
<P>
TUNISIA -- The volume of direct foreign investments in Tunisia
hit 360 million U.S. dollars in 1997, as compared to 250 million
dollars in 1996.
</P>
<P>
Tunisia is considered to be the most attractive among North
African countries to direct foreign investment, said a report on
world investments by the U.N. Trade and Development conference.
</P>
<P>
TEHRAN -- The average daily consumption of gasoline in Iran
registered an increase of 5.6 percent during the first seven
months of the current Iranian year starting in March, according to
the latest official figures from the oil ministry.
</P>
<P>
The average daily consumption of gasoline during the seven
months reached 37.5 million liters.
</P>
<P>
To meet the high demand for gasoline in the country, the
government imported 900 million liters of gasoline during the
seven months.
</P>
<P>
The official attributed the high consumption of gasoline in
the country to inefficiency of fuel consumption by automobiles and
the relative low prices of oil products in Iran.

<HEADLINE> WHO Launches Program to Fight Malaria in Africa </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, November 16 (Xinhua) -- The World Health Organization
(WHO) is launching a program to fight malaria, especially in
Africa, according to a Kenyan government source here Monday.
</P>
<P>
The program, Roll Back Malaria (RBM), is the brainchild of Dr.
Gro Harlem Brundtland, who was elected the new WHO
director-general in May.
</P>
<P>
It is said malaria kills more than 2.7 million people
worldwide annually.
</P>
<P>
The WHO, United Nations Children's Fund, the United Nations
Development Program (UNDP) and the World Bank, have all joined
forces to launch the unique campaign against the tropical killer
scourge that causes an estimated 300 to 500 million acute cases
of disease annually.
</P>
<P>
Most of the deaths occur among children in Africa and nearly
3,000 die every day.
</P>
<P>
Experts estimate that Malaria accounts for about 10 percent of
the disease burden in Africa. In Kenya, said Beth Rapuonda, the
program manager of the National Malaria Control Program in the
Ministry of Health, the disease kills about 72 children daily.
</P>
<P>
According to a press release issued by the WHO, the new
program seeks to reduce substantially the human suffering and
economic losses incurred due to the scourge.
</P>
<P>
"Malaria is the number one health priority of people and
leaders in affected communities and countries, but their voices
have not been heard, " said Brundtland.
</P>
<P>
"The human suffering is unacceptable and so is the economic
burden and impediment to progress. Africa and other regions with
malaria are responding and we must answer their call," he noted.
</P>
<P>
The RBM campaign is different from previous efforts to fight
malaria, said the statement, adding "RBM will work not only
through new tools for controlling malaria but also by
strengthening the health services to affected populations."

<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, November 16 (Xinhua) -- Both Chinese and Russian
foreign ministers expected Monday the forthcoming visit by Chinese
President Jiang Zemin to Russia would further the two countries'
bilateral relations.
</P>
<P>
Chinese Foreign Minister Tang Jiaxuan and his Russian
counterpart Igor Ivanov, both in Malaysia to attend APEC meetings,
held bilateral talks here Monday.
</P>
<P>
Tang said President Jiang Zemin's visit to Russia and his talks
with Russian President Boris Yeltsin on bilateral ties and
international issues of common concern would bear fruits and
promote the cooperation between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
Ivanov said Chinese President's visit to Russia will be a new
landmark in the development of the two countries' ties. The Russian
side is now actively preparing for the visit to ensure its success.
</P>
<P>
President Jiang is scheduled to visit Russia from November 22

On the issue of arms inspection in Iraq, Tang and Ivanov shared

<HEADLINE> Israel, Palestinians Continue War of Words </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, November 16 (Xinhua) -- In a continuation of war of
rhetoric, Israel and the Palestinians accused each other Monday of
hindering the implementation of the Wye agreement, which has been
behind the schedule.
</P>
<P>
Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu warned Monday that Israel
will not carry out further redeployment in the West Bank if the
Palestinians do not revoke those statements "contradicting" to the
deal, Israel Radio reported.
</P>
<P>
Netanyahu and Palestinian National Authority (PNA) President
Yasser Arafat signed the agreement in October in Washington on
Israeli troops redeployment.
</P>
<P>
Under the accord, which should have gone into effect on
November 2, Israel will pull out its troops from another 13.1
percent of the West Bank in three months in return for
Palestinians' tougher actions against Islamic militants.
</P>
<P>
Arafat renewed a vow on Sunday to declare an independent
Palestinian state on May 4, 1999, when the five-year interim
period under the Oslo accords expires, and warned Israel that "our
rifle is ready."
</P>
<P>
Netanyahu responded quickly and sharply Sunday to the
statements, saying they were a declaration of war toward the Oslo
peace process and cast a "very dark shadow" over the Wye agreement.
</P>
<P>
But the Palestinian news agency Wafa said Monday that Arafat's
statements were "misunderstood," noting that the PNA is committed
to the path of peace.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Arafat's adviser Ahmed Tibi accused Netanyahu and
Foreign Minister Ariel Sharon Monday of violating the Wye
agreement by threatening to annex West Bank areas and encouraging
the Jewish settlers to seize lands there.
</P>
<P>
Netanyahu has threatened to annex the parts of the West Bank
still under Israeli control if the Palestinian side takes
"unilateral steps," such as the declaration of independence in the
future.
</P>
<P>
Israeli media reported Monday that, at a meeting with Jewish
settler leaders Sunday, Sharon said the settlers should grab as
many land as they can in the West Bank before the Israeli
redeployment takes place.
</P>
<P>
Tibi said these statements will give green lights to the
settlers to take actions harmful to the Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
Palestinian officials have indicated that Arafat's renewal of
his pledge to declare an independent state came in response to
Netanyahu's annexation threats and as an expression of
frustration over Israel's delay in carrying out the redeployment
agreement.
</P>
<P>
According to the Wye agreement, Israel should have begun to
withdraw its troops Monday. But Israel said the withdrawal will be
delayed for several days until the agreement get approval from
the Knesset (parliament), which is to begin the debate later
Monday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
The accord, ratified by the cabinet last week by a narrow
majority with a string of conditions attached, is expected to be
easily approved Tuesday by the Knesset due to opposition parties'
pledge to back it.

<P>
BONN, November 16 (Xinhua)-- The German-French Economic Council
began talks Monday near Bonn on the possibility of linking the
euro to the U.S. dollar and the Japanese yen within a tight
exchange corridor.
</P>
<P>
But chances are dim for such a system as sources said the
French still had reservations about the proposal from German
Finance Minister Oskar Lafontaine.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the German central bank is also opposed to the idea,
fearing a loss of control over money supply developments.
</P>
<P>
Under the linkage system proposed by Lafontaine, the euro will
be pegged in tight exchange corridors to the U.S. dollar and the
yen to help stabilize world currency markets.
</P>
<P>
During the council meeting, the finance ministers and central
bank chiefs from the two countries were also expected to discuss
their ideas on European economic and fiscal policies ahead of the
European Union finance ministers' talks next week and the
Franco-German summit in November.
</P>

BUCHAREST, November 15 (Xinhua) -- Romania is to shut down some
big loss-making state-run companies which have no chance of
recovery, Radu Sarbu, president of Romanian State Ownership Fund

</P>
<P>
Sarbu said the FPS would try first to privatize all such
companies. "Should the privatization of these companies fail, the
FPS would initiate liquidation procedures," he added.
</P>
<P>
An analysis by the Finance Ministry showed, as many as 150
companies were suffering huge losses. They cost the economy around
1,800 billion lei (225 million U.S. dollars) in 1997 and 1,000
billion lei (125 million dollars) in the first half of this year.
</P>
<P>
According to local analysts, the chances of these companies
turning private was almost nil, taking into consideration the fact
that they have been put up for privatization for more than two
years, and FPS had found no buyers.

MANILA, November 16 (Xinhua) -- A fighting between Philippine
government troops and Moro Islamic Liberation Front (MILF) rebels
entered its third day Monday in Southwestern Mindanao, with one
civilian killed and another wounded.
</P>
<P>
Reports from Mindanao said that the two sides have been engaged
in a fighting since Saturday in the Talayan-Datu Piang-Shariff
Agwak complex in Maguindanao.
</P>
<P>
The government and the rebel group accused each other of
provoking the fresh encounters, the reports said.
</P>
<P>
"Our troops are conducting reconnaissance patrols in the area
when they suddenly fired at us," Ricardo Torrevillas, spokesman of
the government troops, was quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
But MILF Vice Chairman Al Haj Murad said: "Our agreement (with
the government troops) is for them to keep away from the perimeter
defense line of our Camp Omar in the area, but they encroached,
resulting to the firefight."
</P>
<P>
There were no reports of casualties from both sides. However, a
guard of the Buldon-based Cotabato Timberland Company was killed
while another was wounded during a clash with MILF forces in Upper
Minabay.
</P>
<P>
Despite a truce agreement reached between the two sides a week
ago, Murad said that skirmishes in the area would not stop unless
the government recognizes their territories.
</P>
<P>
"The military seems to be putting us in a situation where there
should always be bloodshed as they continue encroach our
territories," Murad said.
</P>
<P>
The MILF is fighting for the identification of their 13 major
camps in Mindanao, and the recognition of its 33 satellite camps
scattered all over the region. The government is still carefully

<HEADLINE> Former Nigerian Leader Defends Huge Donations to </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, November 16 (Xinhua) -- Former Nigerian leader and
presidential aspirant of the Peopel's Democratic Party (PDP),
General Olusegun Obasanjo, has explained that his recent huge
donation to the party was sourced from friends and supporters.
</P>
<P>
In a statement issued in Abuja Sunday, Obasanjo said "all
pledges for donations for my campaign which are repledged to the
party emanated from friends and supporters."
</P>
<P>
Last week, the former military leader donated 130 million
Naira (about 1.53 million U.S. Dollars) to the PDP at a meeting
between its presidential aspirants and national executive
committee.
</P>
<P>
The party collected a total of 301 million Naira (3.54 million
Dollars) at the meeting, including 20 million Naira (240,000
Dollars) from former vice president Alex Ekwueme.
</P>
<P>
Obasanjo's huge donations immediately sparked off wide
criticism, as of the source of the fund and whether the
presidency is up for sale to the highest bidder.
</P>
<P>
According to Obasanjo, the money was for his presidential
campaign but he donated it to the party, because "a strong party
structure from the ward level to the national level" is "the only
basis for the construction of any viable presidential campaign."
</P>
<P>
He refused to disclose the names of donors but assured that
they were "wholesome credible and Nigerian-based," adding that he
is willing to comply if the elections agents decide to scrutinize
the sources of donations to parties and candidates.

<TEXT>
<P>
YANGON, November 16 (Xinhua) -- Myanmar and Laos border
authorities at the central level held their first meeting here
Monday, according to the official Myanmar News Agency.
</P>
<P>
The meeting was jointly chaired by Myanmar Deputy Foreign
Minister U Khin Maung Win and his visiting Lao counterpart
Phongsavath Boupha who arrived here Sunday evening for the
meeting.
</P>
<P>
Reporting that the meeting discussed the two countries' border
affairs, the agency gave no further details about it.
</P>
<P>
The meeting was a follow-up of the first meeting of Myanmar-Lao
regional border authorities held earlier in Tachilek, eastern Shan
state of Myanmar, in October this year.
</P>
<P>
In September last year, Boupha met then Myanmar deputy foreign
minister U Nyunt Swe in Yangon and discussed the implementation of
the two countries' agreement on border areas management and
cooperation.
</P>
<P>
The agreement was one of the two signed during the visit to
myanmar by the then Lao prime minister Khamtay Siphandone in March
last year. The other was on drug control.

Also in August last year, Lao Foreign Minister Somsavat
Lengsavad came to Yangon and co-chaired the third meeting of the
two countries' Joint Commission for Bilateral Cooperation with
then Myanmar foreign minister U Ohn Gyaw, during which a wide
range of bilateral issues were discussed.

<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, November 16 (Xinhua) -- With its strong commitment to
free trade and an economy showing signs of an early recovery from
the Asian crises, the Philippines is likely to emerge as an
investment haven in Southeast Asia, said an official.
</P>
<P>
In a statement issued here Monday by the Philippine
presidential office, Trade Secretary Jose Pardo said the
Philippines could become an investment haven in the region because
of its commitment to the trade liberalization.
</P>
<P>
"There are many good reasons to consider investing in the
Philippines," he said. "While we were not spared from the
financial storm, damage was not as severe as the other."
</P>
<P>
Pardo said the following factors all point to the country's
rise as Southeast Asia's new investment haven in the midst of the
regional financial squeeze:
</P>
<P>
-- The country's banking and financial sectors remain sound.
Reforms continue in providing higher degrees of transparency in
bank loan transactions, encouraging smaller banks to merge, and
raising loan loss provisions.
</P>
<P>
-- Numerous incentives, like duty-free imports and tax
holidays, are in store for investors who wish to operate in the
country's 53 operating economic zones.
</P>
<P>
-- The country has competitive and highly skilled
English-speaking workforce.
</P>
<P>
-- The deregulation of banking, telecommunications, airlines,
and other basic sectors has encouraged higher efficiency among
domestic players, thus offering new investment opportunities.

<HEADLINE> 1 Israeli Soldier Killed in South Lebanon </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, November 16 (Xinhua) -- One Israeli soldier was killed
and five others wounded in south Lebanon Monday by a roadside
bomb, the Orient radio reported.
</P>
<P>
The bomb was detonated by anti-Israeli Lebanese guerrillas
when an armored Israeli patrol passed by on a road in the Markab
area, in the central sector of the Israeli occupied south Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
In Beirut, the Iranian-backed Hezbollah, or Party of God,
claimed responsibility for the attack, saying one of its units
planted a bomb and killed and wounded all soldiers of an Israeli
patrol.
</P>
<P>
The bombing raised to 15 the number of Israeli soldiers killed
in south Lebanon since the start of this year. Some 94 others were
wounded over the same period.
</P>
<P>
Israel set up a self-declared security zone in south Lebanon in
1985 with the claimed aim of protecting its north from
cross-border attacks by Lebanese guerrillas.
</P>
<P>
Lebanon's resistance movement spearheaded by Hezbollah has
since been fighting against Israeli occupation.

<HEADLINE> Kenya, S. Africa Beer Wars Turn into Trade </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, November 16 (Xinhua) -- The beer war between Kenya
Breweries (KBL) and South Africa's Castle Brewing has developed
into a broader trade dispute, with allegations that South Africa
is using unfair tariffs to lock Kenyan goods out of its markets.
</P>
<P>
Kenya has already protested to the South African government
and warned that if need be, it will use similar tactics to keep
out South African goods, the East African weekly reported Monday.
</P>
<P>
Permanent Secretary at the Trade Ministry Francis Awuor told
the newspaper the two governments had agreed to set up a joint
committee to draw up an agreement that will create a conducive
environment for their two-way trade.
</P>
<P>
"We want a solution by the end of next month," he said,
warning that Kenya will retaliate by reviewing the tariffs
charged on South African imports.
</P>
<P>
Kenya's protest comes in the wake of Kenya Breweries crying
foul over what it sees as an export embargo on its products
destined for the South African market over its trademark -- the
elephant.
</P>
<P>
The brewer has been barred from selling its leading Tusker and
Tusker Premium brands in South Africa as this would infringe a
trademark registered by Sabmark International Inc, the holding
firm of South African Breweries which is the majority shareholder
in Castle Brewing Kenya Ltd.
</P>
<P>
Michael Karanja, the KBL managing director, has declared that
KBL will take the beer war to South Africa, with a view to
forging a common front with another South African beer company,
Mitchells Brewery.
</P>
<P>
Latest data from Kenya's Export Promotion Council (EPC) show
the trade deficit in favor of South Africa has widened over the
past two years.
</P>
<P>
The value of Kenya exports to South Africa dropped to 17
million U.S. Dollars in 1997 from 42 million Dollars in 1996
while its imports from South Africa shot up to 374 million
Dollars last year from 226 million Dollars in 1996.
</P>
<P>
An EPC official also publicly blamed the trade tariffs facing
Kenya's goods in South Africa for the rising trade deficit
against Kenya.
</P>
<P>
"There is a huge market, especially for flowers and food
produce during South Africa's winter, and the tariffs appear
deliberately created to block our produce," he said.
</P>
<P>
Among the Kenyan products heavily affected by these tariffs
are tea, wines, flowers, French beans, avocadoes, canned foods
and chemicals, which in most cases cost less than South
African-made alternatives, according to the report.

<HEADLINE> Britain Launches New Strategy to Help Nepal Reduce </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KATHMANDU, November 16 (Xinhua) -- Britain has launched a new
strategy for its efforts to help Nepal reduce poverty, visiting
British Secretary of State for International Development Clare
Short said here Monday.
</P>
<P>
She told a press conference that the Ninth Five-Year Plan
(1997-2002) developed by successive governments in Nepal sets
ambitious goals for poverty elimination.
</P>
<P>
"The challenge now is to implement this plan, when previous
plans have failed, frustrated by corruption and inefficiency," she
stressed in a press statement read at the press conference.
</P>
<P>
She said that there are many projects as well as good policies
in Nepal but the implementation is weak.
</P>
<P>
About 47 percent of the total population in Nepal are still
living below the poverty line despite efforts in the past decades.
</P>
<P>
"As a sign of our seriousness about our role in achieving these
shared objectives, we have launched a new strategy for Britain's
development efforts in Nepal," she noted.
</P>
<P>
Under the Country Strategy Paper for Nepal prepared by the
British Department for International Development (DFID), the
future program should address the main causes of poverty and focus
on the needs for better governance, more coordinated approaches to
human development, strengthened approaches to rural livelihoods,
better physical access in remote areas and building pressure for
change through better awareness and more empowered communities.
</P>
<P>
Short said that during her visit here, she discussed the
challenge of eliminating poverty with a wide range of people from
civil society, political parties, the government and other
development partners including the World Bank.
</P>
<P>
"These discussions have made it clear to me that we need a new
partnership between government, donors and civil society if we are
to bring about real change," she stressed.
</P>
<P>
She said that "we will also be opening an office in Nepal early
next year so that we can do our job better and work
collaboratively with other donors, the World Bank, Asian
Development Bank and IMF (International Monetary Fund) to do
better."
</P>
<P>
"We are prepared to increase our spending in Nepal but only if
we can agree on more effective strategies to systematically reduce
poverty in Nepal," she added.
</P>
<P>
According to DFID's Country Strategy Paper for Nepal, the
British department will aim to increase the size of its
development assistance program in Nepal toward a figure of 21
million pounds (35 million U.S. dollars) per annum by the year
2000/2001 from the present 16 million pounds (26 million dollars)
per annum.
</P>
<P>
Short arrived here on November 12 for a five-day visit at the
invitation of Nepali Finance Minister Ram Sharan Mahat.

<HEADLINE> Rwanda, Uganda Urged to Withdraw from DRC </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, November 16 (Xinhua) -- The Democratic Republic
of Congo (DRC) Monday urged South Africa to press for the
withdrawal of Ugandan and Rwandan forces from the DRC.
</P>
<P>
Once troops from the two countries had retreated, an African
peacekeeping force should be deployed along the DRC borders
during its transition to democracy, visiting DRC Foreign Minister
Jean-Charles Okotololakombe told reporters in Pretoria, capital
of South Africa, after meeting with his South African counterpart
Alfred Nzo.
</P>
<P>
Okotololakombe called on South African President Nelson
Mandela, chairman of the Southern African Development Community,
"to play his true role and ask these countries to leave our
country," press reports here said.
</P>
<P>
Nzo indicated that South Africa would not take sides in the
DRC conflict, saying the problem in that country was a political
one that should be solved by the people of the DRC themselves.
</P>
<P>
He said a peacekeeping force was a something for the future
that should involve organizations such as the United Nations.
Conditions for the deployment of such a force had to be created
first. Once that had happened, countries would be approached to
take part in such a force.
</P>
<P>
"If South Africa is approached, it will play a role," Nzo
said, but declined to give more details.
</P>
<P>
Nzo and Okotololakombe met for more than an hour Monday
morning to discuss bilateral ties and efforts to restore peace in
the DRC, which fell into a civil war since early August.
</P>
<P>
DRC rebels backed by forces from Uganda and Rwanda are
fighting to overthrow DRC President Laurent Kabila's government.
Meanwhile, troops from Angola, Zimbabwe and Namibia are
supporting Kabila's forces.
</P>
<P>
Nzo said a recent admission by Rwanda that it was fighting in
the DRC had opened up new possibilities to achieve a peaceful
settlement in the DRC.
</P>
<P>
Okotololakombe reiterated the DRC's stance that Rwanda and
Uganda were the aggressors in violation of the Charter of the
Organization of African Unity.
</P>
<P>
But he welcomed Rwanda's admission about its military presence
in the DRC, saying this signaled that the foreign forces were
starting to accept responsibility for their action.

<HEADLINE> China Stopping Irregular Electricity Fees </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, November 16 (Xinhua) -- Bi Jingquan, director-general
of the State Development Planning Commission's Pricing Department,
told a press conference today that China will abolish 560 fees
that local governments have levied on electricity.
</P>
<P>
Unwarranted fees amount to 21.7 billion yuan annually, he said,
and the government will merge other remaining charges to reduce
the financial burden on enterprises and farmers, to increase the
market for electricity, and to make room for normal prices
adjustment.
</P>
<P>
In the past decade, China has encouraged various social sectors
and individuals to invest in the power industry to help remove the
bottleneck in electricity supplies in China. But, this has also
led to the collection of unwarranted fees that local governments
have imposed without Central Government approval.
</P>
<P>
In some rural areas, electricity prices are 0.2 yuan per kwh
higher than in urban areas.
</P>
<P>
Bi says that more costly electricity has limited the
development of a consumer market in electric appliances in rural
areas, which account for two-thirds of the country's population,
and China's electric appliance manufacturers say they operate at
only half their capacity.
</P>
<P>
The Central Government has stipulated that power companies are
the only organizations authorized to collect electricity fees and
that local governments can not do this.

<HEADLINE> U.N. Relief Workers to Return to Iraq </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BAGHDAD, November 15 (Xinhua) -- U.N. relief workers evacuated
to Jordan last week amid the lastest Iraq-U.N. standoff will
return to Iraq Monday to resume their operations, said a
U.N. official here Monday.
</P>
<P>
Eric Falt, spokesman for the U.N. Office of Humanitarian
Coordinator in Iraq, told reporters that 30 relief workers will
arrive by plane at Habbaniya airport, 80 kilometers west of
Baghdad at 1:30 p.m. local time (1030 GMT).
</P>
<P>
And 121 more staff members are expected to return via the
Amman-Baghdad highway, the major land route to and from Iraq.
</P>
<P>
Some 150 U.N. humanitarian staff pulled out from Iraq last
Wednesday and Thursday as "precautionary measure" to ensure their
safety as the U.S. threatened to strike against Iraq.
</P>
<P>
The threat came after Iraq on October 31 announced to halt all
cooperation with the U.N. Special Commission (UNSCOM), which
oversees Iraq's disarmament.
</P>
<P>
Iraq had said it would not resume cooperation with UNSCOM until
the U.N. Security Council promised to work toward the lifting of
the U.N. sanctions, imposed on Iraq following its invasion of
Kuwait in 1990.
</P>
<P>
The council maintains that the sanctions will not be removed
unless UNSCOM certifies that Baghdad has eradicated all weapons of
mass destruction.
</P>
<P>
The crisis was eased Saturday after Baghdad accepted an appeal
from U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan and announced to
unconditionally resume cooperation with UNSCOM.
</P>
<P>
But U.S. President Bill Clinton said Sunday in a statement that
"Iraq has backed down," but it must live up to its obligations.
</P>
<P>
U.S. officials hinted that if Iraq fails to comply fully with
the U.N. resolutions in the future, the U.S. launch punishing
attacks without prior warning.

<HEADLINE> Hong Kong's Jobless Rate Edges Up to 5.3 Percent </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, November 16 (Xinhua) -- Hong Kong's unemployment
rate climbed up to 5.3 percent for the three-month period between
August and October, the government announced Monday.
</P>
<P>
The jobless rate for the July-September period was 5.0 percent,
according to the Census and Statistics Department.
</P>
<P>
The latest underemployment rate remained at 2.7 percent.
</P>
<P>
A government economist said Monday that the rise in the
unemployment rate occurred mainly in the construction sector,
reflecting a temporary lull in private construction activities. A
slowdown in exports and subdued local consumption were also
responsible for the worsening employment situation.
</P>
<P>
The number of the unemployed was estimated at 188,000 for the
period between August and October, compared to 179,400 for
July-September period.
</P>
<P>
Joseph W P Wong, Secretary for Manpower and Education, Monday
reiterated the Government's determination to do its utmost
to help the unemployed return to the workforce as soon as
possible.
</P>
<P>
He said that the Special Administrative Region (SAR)
government will launch a massive program of infrastructure and
public works projects over the coming few years to boost the labor
demand.
</P>
<P>
Wong said that some 11,500 jobs will be created in the
construction industry during the next two to three months as the
government awards some 90 public works and housing contracts worth
15 billion HK dollars (about two billion U.S. dollars).

<HEADLINE> New Axle Load Rule to Push Cargo Charges up in </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, November 16 (Xinhua) -- Transporters in Kenya and
Uganda are considering an upward revision of tariffs for transit
cargo following last month's imposition of new axle load limit
regulations by Kenya and Uganda.
</P>
<P>
The regulation limiting maximum weight to eight tons per axle
came into force last month after the World Bank linked further
funding of road repairs to observance of load limits, the East
African weekly reported Monday.
</P>
<P>
Experts predicted that light cargo would remain largely
unaffected by the new rules while tariffs for heavy cargo, which
constitutes up to 80 percent of shipments, would attract higher
freight charges.
</P>
<P>
Freight agents in Kampala said they were complying with the
new axle load limits and revising their tariffs because they did
not expect governments in the east African region to deviate from
the World Bank-driven directive.
</P>
<P>
"We are complying, we're revising our tariffs and the economy
is going to feel the pinch because I don't see how the economies
of Uganda and Kenya can absorb the increase," Patrick Adengo,
chief of Interfreight Panalpina Uganda, was quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
Adengo said most heavy cargo was being shifted to rail in the
interim but the railway corporations also lacked sufficient
capacity to cope with the volumes.
</P>
<P>
Kenya Railways Corporation and Uganda Railways Corporation
have been experiencing shortages of wagons and locomotives.
</P>
<P>
A source at the Uganda Cooperative Central Union said they had
not taken any action yet regarding freight charges although they
had withdrawn from the Kampala-Mombasa route partly as a result
of the new rules.
</P>
<P>
"We are consulting with government and other transporters
because you can't increase rates without looking at other factors
in the market," the source added.
</P>
<P>
Shippers are asking the Kenyan government to allow a six-month
moratorium before enforcement of the new rules so that cargo
already shipped can be cleared.
</P>
<P>
The key roads which donors are asking governments to protect
from heavy vehicles fall along the TransAfrica Highway starting
from Kenya's Indian Ocean port of Mombasa and ending in the
Ugandan capital.

<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, November 16 (Xinhua) -- Chinese President Jiang
Zemin said here this afternoon that China attaches great
importance to the role the APEC (Asia Pacific Economic
Cooperation) is playing in promoting regional economic
development .
</P>
<P>
"We hope that APEC will play a positive and effective role in
promoting the development and cooperation of regional economy and
reducing the disparity between member economies," Jiang said while
meeting with Chile President Eduardo Frei.
</P>
<P>
Jiang said that China is willing to strengthen consultations
with Chile within APEC, so that the cooperation between the two
countries in this field will be enhanced to a new level.
</P>
<P>
The two presidents also exchanged views on the current
financial crisis.
</P>
<P>
Noting that the financial crisis, which started in Southeast
Asia this time, has already affected Latin American countries,
Jiang said that given the situation, it is particularly important
for the developing countries to try to curb the excessive
speculative activities by the international floating capital.
</P>
<P>
Frei briefed Jiang on the economic developments in Chile and
Latin America. He said that although Chile has been affected by
the financial crisis, its economy is still developing steadily due
to the proper measures it has taken.
</P>
<P>
The two presidents also expressed their satisfaction with the
bilateral relationship, especially the fact that bilateral trade
still enjoys fast increase despite the effect of the regional
financial turmoil.

<HEADLINE> Macao Airport Plans to Open More Services </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MACAO, November 16 (Xinhua) -- The Macao International Airport
(CAM) is planning to expand its services on the basis of booming
operation in the past three years, Joao Manuel, CAM chairman of
the board of directors, told Xinhua in an exclusive interview here
Monday.
</P>
<P>
"The airport will open private jet service so that businessmen
can shuttle between Macao and other big cities more conveniently
and quickly and they will not be constrained by normal flights,"
he said.
</P>
<P>
The parking apron of private planes will have special customs
checking and a personal passage, Joao Manuel said, adding the
service will be put into use in May next year.
</P>
<P>
"CAM is also discussing with two express delivery companies in
Macao and will choose one in the end to establish an express cargo
hub in the airport, which will take charge of collecting and
distributing express goods," the chairman said.
</P>
<P>
Macao is situated in the central place among some major cities
in Southeast Asia. Its advantageous location will help Southeast
Asia countries and regions forge contacts with other areas of the
world. On the other hand, express delivery companies will find
more business opportunities in Macao, he said.
</P>
<P>
In addition, the airport hotel invested by Macao businessman Ng
Fok will be put into use in next April.
</P>
<P>
Statistics show that both passenger and freight services have
been increasing steadily since the airport went into operation in
November of 1995. Its Passenger handling capacity in 1997 rose by
50 percent over the previous year, and cargo transport increased
82 percent.
</P>
<P>
During the first ten months of this year, the airport handled
more than 1.84 million passengers, an increase of 11.75 percent
over the same period last year. Freight service exceeded 52,000
tons, a rise of 49.81 percent over the first ten months of 1996.
</P>
<P>
On October 9, the airport welcomed its five millionth passenger
 coming to Macao via a Singapore Airlines flight.
</P>
<P>
In particular, the airport has played an important role in
personnel linkage between Taiwan and the Chinese mainland. Figures
show that passengers from and to Taiwan account for over 60
percent of the total.
</P>
<P>
Now, 13 airline companies are using the airport. Macao is
linked up with 28 cities around the world, 15 of which are in the
inland areas of China.
</P>
<P>
The Macao Civil Aviation Authority has signed air service
agreements with 25 countries in the world.

<HEADLINE> EDS-Repeat with correction in para. 9 hke -- Mounting Excitement in Anticipation of APEC Leaders Meeting </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Chinese President Jiang Zemin, whose special airplane touched
down in heavy rain at 8:40 pm Sunday, is going to deliver a
keynote speech calling for acceleration of economic and technical
cooperation and concerted efforts in dealing with the Asian
economic crisis.
</P>
<P>
Jiang will also have a series of meetings with leaders of other
countries and regions from Monday.
</P>
<P>
Hong Kong Chief Executive Tung Chee-hwa arrived an hour earlier
than Jiang and he waited at the VIP lounge and greeted Jiang at
the airport.
</P>
<P>
In a statement issued by his office, Tung said, "Amidst the
current economic situation, it is important for APEC to
demonstrate that it is getting its act together to address the
financial turmoil, and that it is firmly committed to progressive
trade and investment liberalization."
</P>
<P>
The absence of U.S. President Bill Clinton and Russian
President Boris Yeltsin, however, have not diminished the
excitements that surrounds this event. Vice President Al Gore and
Prime Minister Yevgeni Primakov will be their representatives.
</P>
<P>
South Korean President Kim Dae-jung and his wife arrived Sunday
afternoon after he concluded a state visit to China. Kim is
expected to deliver a keynote speech which will highlight current
reform measures under way in South Korea to enhance confidence in
the country's economy and address ways for regional and global
cooperation to overcome the current financial and economic crisis.
</P>
<P>
Philippine President Joseph Estrada, who is expected to arrive
here Monday, will make his international debut at the APEC meeting.
</P>
<P>
Other leaders who will be at the meeting include Australian
Prime Minister John Howard, Brunei Darussalam Sultan Haji Hassanal
Bolkiah, Canadian Prime Minister Jean Chretien, Chilean
President Eduardo Tagle, Indonesian President B.J. Habibie,
Japanese Prime Minister Keizo Obuchi, Mexican President Ernesto
Zedillo, New Zealand Prime Minister Jenny Shipley, Papua New
Guinea Prime Minister Bill Skate, Singapore Prime Minister Goh Chok
Tong, Dr. Chiang Pin-kung of Chinese Taipei, Thai Prime Minister
Chuan Leekpai, Peruvian President Alberto Fujimori and Vietnamese
Prime Minister Phan Van Khai.
</P>
<P>
Meticulous preparations have been made so far to ensure the
meeting a success. The biggest of it is believed to be
security. At the Palace of Golden Horses, the main venue of the
meeting, "newsmen roam the plushly carpeted corridors under the
watchful eyes of the police," according to the local New Straits
Times.
</P>
<P>
As for the meeting itself, the current economic crisis will
challenge APEC economies to respond directly to the financial
problems. The newly cropped-up Iraq crisis has also become a hot
topic among the ministers and the media although it is not on the
agenda of the meeting.
</P>
<P>
A Brunei corporate leader, Timothy Ong, was quoted as saying,
"There is a great need for something like APEC to provide us with
a framework in which economically, politically and culturally very
diverse society can seek a common path of world economic
cooperation."

COLOMBO, November 16 (Xinhua)-- The president of the Vavuniya
Multi Purpose Cooperative Society (MPCS) in Northern Sri Lanka was
shot Sunday night by suspected Tamil rebels and was hospitalized
in critical condition, said the reports reaching here Monday.
</P>
<P>
Police believe that this could be a start of a series of

Thinam" (Heroes Day), which falls on November 27, said the
reports.
</P>
<P>

and had called him out to have a chat.
</P>
<P>
After the attempt failed, two youth had forcibly entered the
house and led him out and fired two shots, according to the

<P>
He said that China's grain distribution, housing, social
security, finance, and banking reforms and resource management
will lay the foundation for sustainable long-term growth.

<HEADLINE> Namibian Lozi People Free to Decide Fate: </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, November 16 (Xinhua) -- A Zambian opposition party
leader has said that the Lozi people from Namibia's Caprivi
region have a right to decide their own fate,
government-controlled Times of Zambia reported Monday.
</P>
<P>
Akashambatwa Mbikusita-Lewanika, president of Agenda for
Zambia which has been advocating secession of the Barotseland, or
Western Province in Zambia, said people from Caprivi, one of
Namibia's 13 administrative regions, have the right to decide
whether to rejoin a free Barotseland, establish their own
self-rule or remain part of Namibia.
</P>
<P>
Reacting Sunday in Lusaka to reports in a Namibian newspaper,
The Namibian, of last Friday that top figures in the Caprivi
secessionist movement had in recent months been meeting Lozi
separatists in Zambia, Mbikusita-Lewanika, also called Aka,
argued there was a solid historical and political basis for
self-determination of the Caprivi Strip.
</P>
<P>
He explained that the Lozi people from the Caprivi Strip in
the north-eastern part of Namibia and those of Barotseland of
Zambia were one people and they had been meeting "since God
create us."
</P>
<P>
He added that the Zambezi River which separates them had never
been an "iron curtain".
</P>
<P>
Aka, who has resolved to use Zambia's forthcoming local
government elections as a referendum on whether or not to make
Barotseland an independent country, expressed his support for the
cause of the Caprivi people.
</P>
<P>
According to The Namibian, Mishake Muyongo, president of
Namibia's largest opposition Democratic Turnhalle Alliance and
leader of the Caprivi secessionist movement, and Chief Boniface
Malili had recently held several meetings with Agenda for Zambia
and the Barotse Patriotic Front, which has been also advocating
the independence of Barotseland.
</P>
<P>
In another development, both Muyongo and Malili fled Namibia
last week to seek asylum in neighboring Botswana, claiming
persecution at home.
</P>
<P>
A report from the United Nations Humanitarian Information Unit
(IRIN) said Namibian President Sam Nujoma had demanded in a
nationwide address at the weekend that Botswana return the two to
face charges of treason and murder.
</P>
<P>
In his national address, Nujoma accused all the Caprivians of
treason and murder.
</P>
<P>
IRIN also said the Namibian government has since ordered
security sweeps in the area by the army and para-military Special
Field Force.

<HEADLINE> Tyson Comeback News Conference Postponed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW YORK, November 16 (Xinhua) -- Former world champion Mike
Tyson has postponed his comeback news conference Tuesday because
all the details have not been worked out.
</P>
<P>
"We haven't got everything finished yet," Shelly Finkel,
Tyson's boxing advisor, said Sunday. "We just want to get it all
finished. There are no problems at all. It's just not done. We
thought it would be done now."
</P>
<P>
Steve Brener, a spokesman for Showtime, the American cable
television outlet which will televise Tyson's comeback fight,
expected to be against Francois Botha of South Africa Jan. 16 at
the MGM Grand in Las Vegas, agreed with Finkel.
</P>
<P>
Finkel said a news conference would be held after the American
Thanksgiving holiday, November 26.
</P>
<P>
Tyson has not fought since being disqualified for biting
Evander Holyfield's ears June 28, 1997, at the MGM Grand for
which he was fined three million U.S. dollars and had his license
revoked by the Nevada State Athletic Commission. The commission
restored his license by a 4-1 vote October 19.
</P>
<P>
Tyson is scheduled to go to trial December 1 in Montgomery
Country, Maryland, on misdemeanor assault charges following an
August 31 traffic accident in the Washington suburb of
Gaithersburg. Tyson has denied the charges.
</P>
<P>
Botha has a 37-1 record. His loss came when he was stopped in
the 12th round by Mike Moorer in an IBF title fight November 9,
1996.

<HEADLINE> News Analysis: Bangladesh Ruling Party Announces Early </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, November 16 (Xinhua) -- Amid escalating tension between
the ruling and the opposition, Prime Minister and President of the
ruling Bangladesh Awami League (BAL) Sheikh Hasina announced
Sunday that the country's next general elections would be held in
the year 2000, one year ahead of her government's five-year
tenure.
</P>
<P>
"We want to begin our journey in the new millennium with new
hopes and aspirations under a new government," she said, turning
down the opposition's demand for her government's immediate
resignation to pave the way for a mid-term election.
</P>
<P>
Hasina also announced Sunday that her party would "never call
hartals," either in power or in opposition in the future.
</P>
<P>
"I am making this announcement unilaterally both as the prime
minister and as the president of the Awami League," she told
editors of Bangladeshi newspapers and news agencies the other day.
</P>
<P>
Hasina's announcement came in the wake of the three-day
non-stop hartal of the seven-party opposition alliance between
November 9 and 11, which put the whole country at a standstill,
and prior to the opposition's scheduled march towards the Jatiya
Sangsad (parliament) Monday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
The BAL's decision to hold an early election was apparently
aimed at taking the advantage of Article 65 (3) of the
Constitution, a provision which goes to the benefit of the
majority in the parliament, observers here said.
</P>
<P>
The provision, which will automatically expire by April 2001
with the tenure of the country's 7th parliament, stipulates that
30 female members of parliament shall be hand-picked by the 300
directly-elected law-makers.
</P>
<P>
The BAL won just over 150 seats in the 330-seat parliament in
the 1996 general elections, but its number of seats immediately
rose to more than 180 after hand-picking 30 female
parliamentarians, all from the BAL, by the BAL-dominated
parliament.
</P>
<P>
The BAL has targeted a two-thirds majority in the next
parliament, originally slated for the year 2001, so that it would
have a free hand in amending the constitution suitably, a report
in the latest issue of the Holiday weekly said.
</P>
<P>
As the ruling and the opposition parties have confronted each
other both on the street and in the parliament, the BAL pins no
hope of possible cooperation with the opposition in amending the
crucial provision, which gave it a comfortable majority in the 7th
parliament, the observers pointed out.
</P>
<P>
The ruling party has no option but to go for early elections,
so that it could take the benefit of inducting the 30 women
members in the country's 8th parliament, according to the
observers.
</P>
<P>
The BAL has an agenda to constitutionalize a provision of
calling Sheikh Mujibur Rahman, father of Sheikh Hasina and the
first prime minister of independent Bangladesh, "the father of the
nation," and its next target could be to amend the constitution
suitably to the advantage of their politics, the Holiday weekly
report said.
</P>
<P>
A simple majority would not be enough for the party to meet
such targets, and that is why it has such a bent for securing a
two-thirds majority in the next parliament, by winning at least
190 seats in general elections and then hand-picking 30 female
members, the observers said.
</P>
<P>
The BAL president said her party decided to "shun the politics
of hartals ... in the greater interest of economic development of
the country" and "for the people and country's interest,"
justifying the BAL-led hartals when in opposition as "fighting for
the people's democratic rights."
</P>
<P>
The announcement of "no hartal" was simply designed to put
pressure on the opposition parties, which, if continuing their
"hartal" programs, would be easily held responsible by the
government for failures in conducting post-flood rehabilitation
and reconstruction programs and in maintaining law and order
situation in the country, the observers said.
</P>
<P>
What the prime minister did not spell out is that the
"no-hartal" declaration is noting but a strategy of the ruling
party to prepare for the next general elections, the observers
added.

<HEADLINE> Sino-U.S. Relations to Grow Further: Jiang </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, November 16 (Xinhua)-- Chinese President Jiang
Zemin said here Monday morning that the successful exchange of
visits between the leaders of China and the United States will
help bring the Sino-U.S. relationship to a new high.
</P>
<P>
"When President Clinton visited China in June, we decided to
make concerted efforts to establish a constructive strategic
partnership between China and the United States and set the goals
for the development of the Sino-U.S. relations in the new
century," said Jiang in a meeting with U.S. Vice President Al Gore.
</P>
<P>
Jiang and Gore are here to attend the 6th informal leaders
meeting of the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) forum
which is expected to start Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
"Historical experience told us that mutual respect for
integrity and sovereignty and non-interference into each other's
internal affairs are an indispensable condition for a steady
development of the Sino-U.S. relationship," Jiang said.
</P>
<P>
"It is only natural that there exist differences between
countries. The correct attitude toward these differences is to
respect each other, consult on an equal basis, seek common ground
while reserving differences, build up common understanding and
develop cooperation," said the Chinese president.
</P>
<P>
Jiang hoped that both China and the United States will seize
the current opportunities and establish a constructive strategic
partnership on the basis of the three joint communiques and the
joint statement between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
Jiang said he is confident that the Sino-U.S. relationship will
grow further over the next 20 years.
</P>
<P>
Gore conveyed warm greetings to Jiang from President Bill
Clinton, saying that the exchange of visits between the two
presidents have laid a solid foundation for the relationship
between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
The United States and China have a wide range of common
interests, said Gore, who believed that their relationship will
undoubtedly make further progress in the future.
</P>
<P>
Reiterating China's policy on Taiwan, Jiang said that properly
dealing with the Taiwan issue is a key point to guarantee a
healthy and steady development of the relationship between the two
countries.
</P>
<P>
"If both of us can abide by the three joint communiques and the
joint declaration between China and the United States and act
strictly according to the relevant commitments, we can surely rid
the Sino-U.S. relationship of the interference of the Taiwan
issue," said Jiang.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the Chinese president also called on the United
States to follow a "wise and far-sighted policy" on Tibet and act
strictly according to its commitment that Tibet is a part of China
and the United States will not support its independence.
</P>
<P>
"The policy of the Chinese government toward Dalai Lama is
clear and consistent," said Jiang, who had exchanged views with
President Clinton on this matter when he visited China.
</P>
<P>
"Dalai Lama must truly give up the claim for the independence
of Tibet, stop the activities designed to split the motherland and
declare openly that Tibet is a part of China, Taiwan is a
province of China and the government of the People's Republic of
China is the sole legitimate one of the country," Jiang said.
</P>
<P>
The fact is that Dalai and his clique have never given up their
claim for the independence of Tibet and have never stopped the
activities to split the country, Jiang noted.
</P>
<P>
"They are still propagandizing their cause and deceiving public
opinion in the world by making use of the discussions on contacts
with the central government," Jiang stressed.
</P>
<P>
According to the Chinese president, the Dalai issue is not a
religious matter but a political one. The Dalai clique is a
separatist political group with its own organization and
program. Dalai himself is not a religious figure but a political
figure in exile who has been engaged in the activities of
splitting the motherland.
</P>
<P>
Jiang said that the so-called Tibet issue was in fact a product
of imperialist aggression against China. Some anti-China forces in
the world have been using the issue to exert pressure on the
Chinese government and their intention is quite obvious.
</P>
<P>
Gore promised Jiang that the U.S. stand on the issues of Taiwan
and Tibet are consistent and will not change.
</P>
<P>
Jiang also discussed with Gore China's entry into the World
Trade Organization.
</P>
<P>
They both hoped that with the joint efforts of the two
countries, their negotiations on this issue will be concluded
early next year.

<HEADLINE> Mounting Excitement in Anticipation of APEC Leaders Meeting  by Liu Jiang and Peng Shujie </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Chinese President Jiang Zemin, whose special airplane touched
down in heavy rain at 8:40 pm Sunday, is going to deliver a
keynote speech calling for acceleration of economic and technical
cooperation and concerted efforts in dealing with the Asian
economic crisis.
</P>
<P>
Jiang will also have a series of meetings with leaders of other
countries and regions from Monday.
</P>
<P>
Hong Kong Chief Executive Tung Chee-hwa arrived an hour earlier
than Jiang and he waited at the VIP lounge and greeted Jiang at
the airport.
</P>
<P>
In a statement issued by his office, Tung said, "Amidst the
current economic situation, it is important for APEC to
demonstrate that it is getting its act together to address the
financial turmoil, and that it is firmly committed to progressive
trade and investment liberalization."
</P>
<P>
The absence of U.S. President Bill Clinton and Russian
President Boris Yeltsin, however, have not diminished the
excitements that surrounds this event. Vice President Al Gore and
Prime Minister Yevgeni Primakov will be their representatives.
</P>
<P>
South Korean President Kim Dae-jung and his wife arrived Sunday
afternoon after he concluded a state visit to China. Kim is
expected to deliver a keynote speech which will highlight current
reform measures under way in South Korea to enhance confidence in
the country's economy and address ways for regional and global
cooperation to overcome the current financial and economic crisis.
</P>
<P>
Philippine President Joseph Estrada, who is expected to arrive
here Monday, will make his international debut at the APEC meeting.
</P>
<P>
Other leaders who will be at the meeting include Australian
Prime Minister John Howard, Brunei Darussalam Sultan Haji Hassanal
Bolkiah, Canadian Prime Minister Joseph Chretien, Chilean
President Eduardo Tagle, Indonesian President B.J. Habibie,
Japanese Prime Minister Keizo Obuchi, Mexican President Ernesto
Zedillo, New Zealand Prime Minister Jenny Shipley, Papua New
Guinea Prime Minister Bill Skate, Singapore Prime Minister Goh Chok
Tong, Dr. Chiang Pin-kung of Chinese Taipei, Thai Prime Minister
Chuan Leekpai, Peruvian President Alberto Fujimori and Vietnamese
Prime Minister Phan Van Khai.
</P>
<P>
Meticulous preparations have been made so far to ensure the
meeting a success. The biggest of it is believed to be
security. At the Palace of Golden Horses, the main venue of the
meeting, "newsmen roam the plushly carpeted corridors under the
watchful eyes of the police," according to the local New Straits
Times.
</P>
<P>
As for the meeting itself, the current economic crisis will
challenge APEC economies to respond directly to the financial
problems. The newly cropped-up Iraq crisis has also become a hot
topic among the ministers and the media although it is not on the
agenda of the meeting.
</P>
<P>
A Brunei corporate leader, Timothy Ong, was quoted as saying,
"There is a great need for something like APEC to provide us with
a framework in which economically, politically and culturally very
diverse society can seek a common path of world economic
cooperation."

<HEADLINE> U.N. Official: U.N. Relief Workers to Return to Iraq Monday </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BAGHDAD, November 15 (Xinhua) -- The U.N. relief workers, who
were evacuated to Amman, Jordan last week amid the Iraq-U.N.
standoff over arms inspections, will return to Iraq on Monday
afternoon to resume their mandate.
</P>
<P>
Eric Falt, spokesman for the U.N. Office of Humanitarian
Coordinator in Iraq (UNOHCI), told reporters Monday that 30
U.N. humanitarian staff will arrive by plane at Habbaniya
airport, 80 kilometers west of Baghdad at 1:30 p.m. local time.
</P>
<P>
Falt said that 121 others are arriving via Amman-Baghdad
highway, the major land route to and from Iraq.
</P>
<P>
Some 150 U.N. humanitarian staff pulled out of Iraq last
Wednesday and Thursday, which was a "precautionary measure" to
ensure their safety as the United States threatened to strike Iraq
to force it to resume cooperation with the U.N. arms inspectors.
</P>
<P>
Eric said that 45 personnel of Lloyds Company, a private
British company, were supposed to have already resumed their work
of supervising the arrival of foodstuff in Iraq border city of Um
Qasr.
</P>
<P>
Lloyds Company withdrew its personnel from Iraq without prior
notice to UNOHCI last Thursday and Friday when fears were widening
that U.S. and British military strikes against Iraq were imminent.
</P>
<P>
U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan on Saturday asked for the
return of humanitarian program monitors to Iraq so as to resume
their mandate, but their return were postponed on Sunday because
it was unclear at that moment whether the U.S. would drop its
military threat against Iraq or not.
</P>
<P>
Baghdad agreed to resume cooperation unconditionally with the
U.N. arms inspectors in a letter sent to Annan Saturday from Iraqi
Deputy Prime Minister Tariq Aziz, a move that narrowly averted
possible U.S. and British military strikes.
</P>
<P>
U.S. President Bill Clinton on Sunday said that "Iraq has
backed down," and that if Iraq violates U.N. resolutions again,
the U.S. will strike it without prior warning.
</P>
<P>
Iraqi leadership decided on October 31 to halt all forms of
cooperation with the U.N. Special Commission for disarming Iraq
(UNSCOM) until the U.N. Security Council moves toward lifting

<HEADLINE> hke111638 - Regional Roundtable on ASEAN Role Opens in Phnom Penh </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PHNOM PENH, November 16 (Xinhua) -- A two-day conference of
think- tanks from across Southeast Asia on the role of ASEAN
opened here Monday at the Hotel Sofitel Cambodiana.
</P>
<P>
The conference is devoted to examining the role of ASEAN
(Association of Southeast Asian Nations) and to assessing whether
it has abided by its long-held policy of non-interference in
members' internal affairs; or whether it has shifted to what is
termed "flexible engagement."
</P>
<P>
Among the discussions are also issues such as the challenge to
ASEAN posed by the Asian economic crisis and Cambodia's future
with the regional body.
</P>
<P>
The conference was organized by the Cambodian Institute for
Cooperation and Peace (CICP). About 50 people participated in the
conference, among them are diplomats of foreign corps and
representatives of the government.
</P>
<P>
Cambodia's Finance Minister Keat Chhon in his opening speech,
elaborated the nation's position on ASEAN cooperation and
non-interference.
</P>
<P>
He said," Cambodia considers ASEAN's policy of non-interference
as one of the "Golden Rules" on which the group's progress has
been founded. This principle has served ASEAN well through many
difficult periods of economic turmoil, regional strife and social
changes."
</P>
<P>
"In our view, as long as ASEAN remains a grouping of sovereign
states, non-interference is the principle that best respects this
condition. Cambodia hopes that ASEAN's vision of a united
Southeast Asia will be realized soon," he added.
</P>
<P>
Mushahid All, Singapore ambassador to Cambodia, said in his
welcoming address that it is sure ASEAN is currently going through
an extremely difficult phase in its history.
</P>
<P>
"ASEAN's primary challenge today is to overcome the economic
difficulties. In today's world of globalized markets and
production locations, the only way to succeed is to continue to
keep its economies open," he pointed out.
</P>
<P>
Singapore currently holds the chair of the ASEAN Standing
Committee.

and agreed to give Iraq the chance to keep its promises of

<HEADLINE> Italian Priest Released by Philippine Kidnappers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, November 16 (Xinhua) -- The Moro Islamic Liberation
Front (MILF) rebels handed over Italian priest Luciano Benedetti
to Philippine government officials in Maguindanao, Mindanao on
Monday, several hours after he was released by his captors to MILF
forces.
</P>
<P>
The Philippine news agency reported that a military helicopter
brought Benedetti of the Pontical Institute for Foreign Mission to
Awang Airport in Datu Odin Sinsuat, Maguindanao, where he was
checked for blood pressure before being whisked away to Simuay,
Maguindanao, for the formal turnover.
</P>
<P>
The agency quoted Ghadzali Jaafar, MILF vice-chairman, as
saying that no ransom was paid for Benedetti's release and his
organization has no nothing to do with the kidnapping.
</P>
<P>
"If we were accused of a hundred times of being involved in the
Benedetti kidnapping, I also deny a hundred times the
accusations," he told reporters at the airport.
</P>
<P>
A kidnap-for-ransom group, which snatched the missionary on
September 8 in Zamboanga del Norte, had demanded 10 million pesos
(250,000 U.S. dollars) for the priest's safe release.
</P>
<P>
But Jaafar reiterated that Benedetti was freed without ransom
due to "constant pressure" the MILF applied to his captors.

<HEADLINE> Australian Dollar Slides Higher in Inactive Session </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, November 16 (Xinhua) -- The Australian dollar made
slender gains after a feeble day of trading as market participants
failed to react to the Japanese rescue package and held their
breath over U.S. interest rates.
</P>
<P>
"Today has been as bad as it gets - nothing has happened,"
Macquarie Bank head of trading Guy Reynolds said.
</P>
<P>
At the close of the session, the Australian dollar was at 63.79
U.S. cents, from 63.78 at Friday's close.
</P>
<P>
Reynolds said "today's lack of action had been a surprise. I
actually thought it would be bought up aggressively and it hasn't
been, there's a good offer at 63.90 U.S. cents and on the down
side there's some Swiss banks around."
</P>
<P>
The trader said the release of a 24-trillion-yen (196 billion
U.S. dollars) economic stimulus package for Japan had failed to
impact on the markets.
</P>
<P>
"It's more of the same from Japan, there's been nothing
startling there," Reynolds said.
</P>
<P>
"I think people were focusing on that and because nothing new
has really come out of it, they've just hung up their boots for
the day."
</P>
<P>
Reynolds said he expected the local currency to continue its
journey upwards but there may be some pull-backs over the next
couple of days to about 63.20 U.S. cents.
</P>
<P>
The Australian dollar finished the local session at 78.12
Japanese yen from 77.28 and 1.0700 German marks from 1.0738.

<HEADLINE> Clinton's China Visit Transforms Village Into Tourism Site </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
XI'AN, November 16 (Xinhua) -- Yang Xi'an, a farmer from
northwest China's Shaanxi Province, has seemed more like a tourist
guide in recent months.
</P>
<P>
Yang lives in the village of Xiahe near the terra cotta warrior
venue in the ancient city of Xi'an.
</P>
<P>
However, Yang's talks with tourists center more on the recent
visit by U.S. President Bill Clinton than on the terra cotta
warriors which date back well over 2,000 years.
</P>
<P>
A large colorful photograph of Yang shaking hands with
President Clinton sits prominently in Yang's yard. Yang recounts
his conversation with the president while tourists pose beside the
special photo.
</P>
<P>
A sign in front of Yang's house notes that it was the site of
Clinton's "round-table meeting" when he visited the village on
June 26 this year.
</P>
<P>
The Clinton's and six villagers talked for over 40 minutes,
with Xiahe residents answering questions raised by the American first
family.
</P>
<P>
Two classrooms in the Xiahe Primary School where Clinton
presented a speech have been rebuilt into exhibition halls. Visitors
can learn more about Clinton's visit to the small village by
viewing well over 30 photographs on display.
</P>
<P>
The exhibition halls also feature gifts the American entourage
presented to villagers, including business cards, Clinton's signature
and a letter of gratitude the president sent after returning home.
</P>
<P>
Travel agencies were quick to cash in on Clinton's visit.
</P>
<P>
"President Clinton's China Visit," a special tour route
organized by a group of travel agencies, has attracted some 1,000
tourists from Singapore, Thailand, Malaysia, the United States and
the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region.
</P>
<P>
The tourists see the same big banners which welcomed Clinton,
and the same group of children welcome them with the very same
song which reads: "Please take my song back to your home and
please leave your smiles here..."
</P>
<P>
The Xiahe village leader said that more than 6,000 people from
both at home and abroad have visited the village since June
26. Xiahe has indeed emerged as a booming tourism site in Xi'an.

<HEADLINE> Kenya Imposes New Ban on Trawling in Lake </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, November 16 (Xinhua) -- A fresh ban on trawling in
Lake Victoria was imposed recently by west Kenya's Nyanza
Province along the lake shore so as to protect fisheries
resources in the lake, a national paper said Monday.
</P>
<P>
Trawling is a method of fishing whereby large nets with small
holes dragged from boats along the bottom of a water body to
catch fish.
</P>
<P>
It has been identified as one of the major causes of the
decline of fisheries resources in Lake Victoria, the world's
second largest fresh water lake, through destruction of breeding
and spawning ground, and catching of juvenile fish.
</P>
<P>
The local government has called on chiefs, assistant chiefs,
the police and fisheries scouts to step up patrol along the
Kenyan beaches of the lake.
</P>
<P>
Under the country's Fisheries Act, trawling in Lake Victoria
is prohibited within five nautical miles from the entire
shoreline.
</P>
<P>
The ban followed compliants by fishermen and dealers that it
has resulted in the decline of catchment, put the fish processors
under utilization of their plants and rendered some workers
jobless.

<HEADLINE> Quick Privatization of Zambian Copper Mines Urged </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, November 16 (Xinhua) -- The Zambia Investment Center
(ZIC) has asked the Zambia Privatization Agency (ZPA) to quickly
privatize the Zambia Consolidated Copper Mines (ZCCM) for this
year's pledged investment of 994 million U.S. Dollars to be well
implemented.
</P>
<P>
Times of Zambia Monday quoted ZIC Director-General Margaret
Mwanakatwe as saying at the weekend that the country recorded the
highest investment pledges this year but the process of
implementation has slowed down due to the delay in privatizing
the ZCCM.
</P>
<P>
This year's investment pledge has been rated the highest with
a total of 4,700 jobs created compared with last year when the
country only got a 100 million Dollars investment pledge, she
said.
</P>
<P>
She said once ZCCM is sold, the country will be poised for an
economic boom.
</P>
<P>
More people are coming to invest in Zambia but are still
holding on to their money awaiting the sale of ZCCM, she noted,
adding "The mines should be sold quickly in a bid to build
confidence in our investors."
</P>
<P>
The Zambian government has been trying to quicken the
privatization of ZCCM but failed to complete the process in the
first half of this year as planned.
</P>
<P>
Due to disagreement over the selling price of Nkana and
Nchanga mines, two biggest mines of the country, Zambia suspended
the negotiations with the Kafue Consortium last April on the sale
of the two mines, which account for 65 percent of ZCCM assets.
</P>
<P>
The delayed privatization process has made donors withhold the
financial support to country.

<HEADLINE> Jiang Urges U.S. to Be Far-sighted on Tibet Issue </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, November 16 (Xinhua)-- Chinese President Jiang
Zemin on Monday urged the United States to follow a "wise and
far-sighted policy" on Tibet and act strictly according to its
commitment that Tibet is a part of China and the United States
will not support its independence.
</P>
<P>
"When President Clinton visited China, I exchanged views with
him on this matter," said Jiang while meeting with U.S. Vice
President Al Gore here Monday morning.
</P>
<P>
Jiang and Gore are here attending the 6th informal leaders
meeting of the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) forum
which is expected to start on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
"The policy of the Chinese government toward Dalai Lama is
clear and consistent," Jiang said. "Dalai Lama must truly give up
his claim for the independence of Tibet, stop the activities
designed to split the motherland and declare publicly that Tibet
is a part of China, Taiwan is a province of China and the
government of the People's Republic of China is the sole
legitimate one of the country."
</P>
<P>
The fact is that Dalai and his clique have never given up their
claim for the independence of Tibet and have never stopped the
activities to split the country, Jiang noted.
</P>
<P>
"They are still propagandizing their cause and deceiving public
opinion in the world by making use of the discussions on contacts
with the central government," Jiang stressed.
</P>
<P>
According to the Chinese president, the Dalai issue is not a
religious matter but a political one. The Dalai clique is a
separatist political group with its own organization and
program. Dalai himself is not a religious figure but a political
figure in exile who has been engaged in the activities of
splitting the motherland.
</P>
<P>
Gore promised Jiang that the U.S. stand on Tibet is consistent
and will not change.

<P>
CAIRO, November 16 (Xinhua) -- The following are economic
briefs from Middle East countries.
</P>
<P>
AMMAN -- The growth rate of Jordan's gross domestic product
based on fixed price reached 2.2 percent in 1997, failing to meet
the target of 5.0 percent, said a report from the Central Bank of
Jordan Monday.
</P>
<P>
The bank attributed the lower-than-expected growth rate to the
poor performance of the sectors except transport, communication
and manufacturing.
</P>
<P>
AMMAN -- Jordan's foreign reserves reached 1.69 billion U.S.
dollars in 1997, said a report issued by the Central Bank of
Jordan Monday.
</P>
<P>
The amount of the foreign reserves can cover 5.4 months of
imports, compared with 2.1 months in 1996, the report said.
</P>
<P>
TEHRAN -- Iran's average daily consumption of gasoline in the
first seven months of the current Iranian year starting March 20
reached 37.5 million liters, an increase of 5.6 percent as against
the same period of last Iranian year.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a press conference, Iranian Deputy Oil Minister
Mohammad Aqa'ie said that the daily gasoline consumption in the
month of Mehr ending October 22 was 38.5 million liters, showing
an increase of 7.9 percent compared with the same month last year,
the official news agency IRNA reported.
</P>
<P>
To meet the high demand in the country, the government imported
900 million liters of gasoline during the seven months.
</P>
<P>
The official attributed the high consumption to fuel
inefficiency resulting from automobiles' poor designs and the
relative low prices of oil products in Iran.
</P>
<P>
CAIRO -- Egypt has decided to carry out 323 projects in the
villages around Cairo and the northern port city of Alexandria in
the 1998-99 fiscal year ending June 30, Minister of Rural
Development Mahmoud Sherif said Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The projects will cover drinking water, sanitary systems and
those to improve environment and infrastructural facilities,
including road, power supply and manpower development.
</P>
<P>
The projects are estimated to cost 45.5 million Egyptian pounds
(13.38 million U.S. dollars), of which 33.3 million pounds (9.79
million dollars) are provided by the government and the rest
contributed by the villagers.
</P>
<P>
BEIRUT -- The profits of Solidere, Lebanon's biggest company,
in the first half of this year fell to 2.02 million dollars, a
drop of 84 percent from the same period last year.
</P>
<P>
Solidere is entrusted with rebuilding Beirut's commercial
district that was destroyed in Lebanon's 1975-90 civil war.
</P>
<P>
The reconstruction of the district of 1.6 million square meters
will be completed by the year 2018.

<HEADLINE> Measures Proposed to Boost Singapore Manufacturing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SINGAPORE, November 16 (Xinhua) -- A Singapore sub-committee
Monday made public its seven-point recommendations aimed at
sharpening the long-term competitive edge of the country's
manufacturing sector.
</P>
<P>
Kwa Chong Seng, chairman of the Manufacturing Sub-Committee of
the Committee on Singapore's Competitiveness, told a press
conference that while cost-cutting measures can help businesses
become competitive in the short-term, "it is critical that
strategies and policies which strengthen Singapore long-term
competitiveness be put in place."
</P>
<P>
On the recommended long-run measures, Kwa placed the priority
on the upgrading of skills and capabilities which he said "will
ensure Singapore continues to be a viable, strategic manufacturing
center in Asia into the next millennium."
</P>
<P>
His sub-committee recommended that companies take a larger and
more proactive role in attracting and retaining employees in
addition to increasing the engineering intake of the institutes of
higher learning.
</P>
<P>
In this regard, the sub-committee proposed setting up dual
career paths in management and technical areas for engineers to
attract foreign talents on a large scale to meet the manpower and
skill shortage, to increase intake of institutes of higher
learning for science and technology-related courses, to promote
strongly on-the-job training and the Skill Redevelopment Program,
to deter job hop of foreign professionals, and to fund training of
both local and foreign workforce.
</P>
<P>
Other measures set forth by the sub-committee include a
fundamental review of the industrial land pricing mechanism to
keep land prices internationally competitive, more aggressive
government funding of science, technology and innovation
activities, greater technology collaboration and linkages with
other countries, lower electricity tariffs and back-up charges for
companies, establishment of world-class companies and capable
local enterprises to become niche players in their own fields and
less dependent on multi-national companies.
</P>
<P>
The sub-committee also asked the government and
quasi-government agencies to pass down cost-savings to the private
sector and not to aim for high surpluses, and to allow group tax
consolidation and ease cash flow constraints.
</P>
<P>
Singapore's manufacturing sector provides 23 percent of the
country's total employment and its foreign exchange earnings
account for 60 percent of the country's total.
</P>
<P>
In the first nine months of 1998, Singapore's manufacturing
sector shrank by 4.5 percent.

<HEADLINE> S. African Artillery Flows to Middle East </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, November 16 (Xinhua) -- A large number of South
African-developed G-6 and G-5 artillery systems have been
purchased by three Middle East countries, with two other
countries still considering the deal, a local daily reported
Monday.
</P>
<P>
The total cost of the purchases significantly increased the
defense industry's current 1.8-billion-Rand (316-million-U.S.
Dollar) contribution to foreign exchange earnings, said the Star
daily.
</P>
<P>
Oman and the United Arab Emirates have each bought unspecified
numbers of self-propelled G-6 155mm howitzers -- at a cost of
more than 26 million Rand (4.6 million Dollars) per item -- while
Qatar has purchased the G-5 and plans to increase this order at a
later date, according to the paper.
</P>
<P>
Kuwait has short-listed the G-6 as part of a
three-billion-Rand (526-million-Dollar) artillery program despite
U.S. claims that Kuwait had opted to buy the Paladin M109
howitzer system, which is still in the prototype stage.
</P>
<P>
Iraq already has G-5s which it acquired from European arms
dealers and used them with deadly affect on allied troops during
the 1990 Gulf War, the paper said.
</P>
<P>
Saudi Arabia is also in discussion with South Africa to buy
G-6s.
</P>
<P>
South African Deputy President Thabo Mbeki and Defense
Minister Joe Modise were in Saudi Arabia last week for
discussions on possible arms-for-oil deal.
</P>
<P>
South Africa is competing against world's leading arms
suppliers for the Saudi order and according to Modise's spokesman
Puso Tladi, there was interest shown in South African weapons.
</P>
<P>
The purchases by Middle East countries are part of a
commitment by Arab nations to standardize equipment in the wake
of the Gulf War and the Iran-Iraq war of 1980-88, the paper said.
</P>
<P>
Defense sources were quoted as saying that South Africa had
been "a big winner in artillery systems sales" in the region
since the Gulf War.

<HEADLINE> Iran Welcomes Easing of Iraq-U.N. Tension </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, November 16 (Xinhua) -- Iran welcomes the easing of
tension between Iraq and the United Nations over arms inspections
in Iraq, local daily Hamshahri reported on Monday.
</P>
<P>
Foreign Minister Kamal Kharrazi on Sunday expressed
satisfaction with Iraq' decision to resume cooperation with the
U.N. weapons inspectors, the daily reported, but it did not
mention on what occasion Kharrazi made the remark.
</P>
<P>
"We are pleased that the tension between Iraq and the U.N. has
been reduced," Kharrazi said, "and we hope the tension would be
solved finally through diplomatic ways."
</P>
<P>
And resorting to the use of force would only cause instability and
insecurity in the region, he added.
</P>
<P>
"From the very beginning, Iran, as the chairman of the
Organization of the Islamic Conference and Iraq's neighbor, has
been making efforts to use political means to avert further
escalation and to solve the crisis as soon as possible."
</P>
<P>
Iraq halted its cooperation with U.N. arms inspectors two
weeks ago and rescinded its decision on Saturday in response to
calls by U.N. chief Kofi Annan and some other world leaders.
</P>
<P>
The move ended its showdown with the U.N. and averted a
possible military attack threatened by the United States, which
has stepped up its military buildup in the Gulf.

Residents in Nanjing and Shanghai in east China are optimistic

</P>
<P>
More than 10,000 people in the two cities have registered to
watch the LMS, but only several hundred lucky people have received
invitations from local astronomical stations.
</P>
<P>
Nanjing Purple Mountain Observatory, the main station for
national observations of the LMS, will provide live reports on the
event via the international computer networks. Shanghai Hot Line,
a Chinese computer network station, will also broadcast live
reports on the event within China.
</P>
<P>
Changchun, capital of northeast China's Jilin Province, is
regarded as the best LMS observation site in China. Books on
astronomy are selling like hot cakes and over 200 people have
registered to observe the LMS at a suburban satellite station.
</P>
<P>
People have been told that the event can be seen with the naked
eye, many are still queuing to purchase telescopes and binoculars
in hope of "reducing" the distance between them and the sky.
</P>
<P>
American scientists with the National Aeronautic and Space
Administration (NASA) will not need to worry about either the
weather or "distance". The agency will fly two research aircraft
loaded an array of scientific instruments to fly at altitudes of
20,000-30,000 feet above the Japanese Sea in order to observe the
meteor storm.

<HEADLINE> Container Shipping Grows in East China Port </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
QINGDAO, November 16 (Xinhua) -- Qingdao port, one of the
oldest in east China, had handled one million TEUs (Twenty-foot
Equivalent Units) by November 10 this year, equal to the figure
for 1997, despite the negative impact of the lingering financial
crisis in Asia.
</P>
<P>
Since the second half of last year, with much of its cargo
destined for Southeast Asian countries, the port has been hurt by
the financial turmoil.
</P>
<P>
To offset the negative impact, the port has gone all out to
develop its container business both at home and abroad, and so
far this year 50 percent of the port's container business has came
from new clients.
</P>
<P>
Measures have also been taken by the port authorities to
improve management and increase efficiency, with round-the-clock
handling capacity reaching a record high of 4,367 TEUs.
</P>
<P>
To date, Qingdao, with 14 docks and 70 berths, has
established trade ties with more than 400 ports in 130 countries
and regions. About 15 of the world's top 20 container companies
are now operating container shipping in the port.
</P>
<P>
The port is expected to handle 1.2 million TEUs by the end of
this year.

<HEADLINE> Kenya on Course to Post Budget Surplus </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, November 16 (Xinhua) -- Kenya is on course to post a
budget surplus, with the 5.6 billion Shillings (93.3 million U.S.
Dollars) surplus, making up 0.8 percent of gross domestic product
(GDP), between July and September 1998 on a commitment basis.
</P>
<P>
On a cash basis, the surplus in the first quarter of the
fiscal 1998/99 year (July/June) was turned into a deficit of 2.7
billion Shillings (45 million Dollars) or 0.4 percent of GDP due
to previously unpaid bills.
</P>
<P>
However, even then, the deficit was lower than the expected
3.7 billion Shillings (61.6 million Dollars), the East African
weekly reported Monday.
</P>
<P>
The quarter's figures were an improvement compared with the
same period of 1997/98 when the government chalked up a budget
deficit, on a commitment basis, of 1.7 billion Shillings (28
million Dollars).
</P>
<P>
The November issue of Monthly Economic Review by the central
bank attributes the surplus to the adoption of stringent
expenditure measures from July to September this year.

<HEADLINE> Tanzania Fears Economy Controlled by Foreigners </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, November 16 (Xinhua) - Tanzania has raised
concern over the possibility of the nation's economy falling in
the hands of a few foreigners for their personal benefit as
Tanzanians fail to take hold of the privatization exercise.
</P>
<P>
The Minister for Industries and Trade Iddi Simba told a
meeting here Sunday night that Tanzania will not allow its
economy to fall in the hands of foreigners "who can't develop the
economy".
</P>
<P>
Simba, according to press reports Monday, told members of the
Association of Owners of Small Businesses and Industries that the
problem is that there are very few Tanzanians with the academic
capability to participate in the informal sector.
</P>
<P>
"Ever since I was appointed Minister for Industries and Trade,
I have been expecting Tanzanians to take hold of the private
sector.... However, they are nowhere to be seen," he said.
</P>
<P>
He called on the entrepreneurs to learn knowledge concerning
their development and their cooperation with foreign investors.
</P>
<P>
The minister also pledged government assistance and commitment
to stepping in whenever the businessmen and traders are denied
their rights by a few unscrupulous government officials.
</P>
<P>
On their part, most of some 500 attendants complained over
government officials for destroying their businesses without
giving them alternative spaces.
</P>
<P>
They also blamed many financial institutions for refusing to
give them loans because they lacked land as collateral.

<HEADLINE> Jiang Urges U.S. to Be Far-sighted on Tibet Issue </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, November 16 (Xinhua)-- Chinese President Jiang
Zemin on Monday urged the United States to follow a "wise and
far-sighted policy" on Tibet and act strictly according to its
commitment that Tibet is a part of China and the United States
will not support its independence.
</P>
<P>
"When President Clinton visited China, I exchanged views with
him on this matter," said Jiang while meeting with U.S. Vice
President Al Gore here Monday morning.
</P>
<P>
Jiang and Gore are here attending the 6th informal leaders
meeting of the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) forum
which is expected to start on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
"The policy of the Chinese government toward Dalai Lama is
clear and consistent," Jiang said. "Dalai Lama must truly give up
his claim for the independence of Tibet, stop the activities
designed to split the motherland and declare publicly that Tibet
is a part of China, Taiwan is a province of China and the
government of the People's Republic of China is the sole
legitimate one of the country."
</P>
<P>
The fact is that Dalai and his clique have never given up their
claim for the independence of Tibet and have never stopped the
activities to split the country, Jiang noted.
</P>
<P>
"They are still propagandizing their cause and deceiving public
opinion in the world by making use of discussion on contacts with
the central government," Jiang stressed.
</P>
<P>
According to the Chinese president, the Dalai issue is not a
religious matter but a political one. The Dalai clique is a
separatist political group with its own organization and
program. Dalai himself is not a religious figure but a political
figure in exile who has been engaged in the activities of
splitting the motherland.
</P>
<P>
Gore promised Jiang that the U.S. stand on Tibet is consistent
and will not change.

<HEADLINE> Iran Closes Down 12 Diplomatic Missions Abroad </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, November 16 (Xinhua) -- Iran closed down 12 embassies
and consulates abroad in line with the government's austerity
plan, local daily Iran News reported on Monday.
</P>
<P>
The closed diplomatic missions are mainly in European and
Latin American countries, said the newspaper.
</P>
<P>
The report did not give details about the closure, but said
that the Iranian consulate in Munich, Germany is among the closed
ones.
</P>
<P>
In August, Foreign Ministry spokesman Mahmoud Mohammadi said
Iran would shut down diplomatic missions in countries "which do
not have very friendly relations with Iran and those which do not
have significant economic cooperation with our country."
</P>
<P>
Earlier reports say Tehran has decided to close embassies in
Sierra Leone, Burkina Faso, Tanzania, Gabon, Nicaragua,
Afghanistan and the consulate in Hyderabad, India.
</P>
<P>
Iran is facing serious financial problems as the country's
economy has been hit hard by slumping oil prices this year.
</P>
<P>
The government decided to cut its expenditures and launched
emergency economic measures including selling bonds, borrowing
from the central bank and advance sale of crude oil to make ends
meet.

NAIROBI, November 16 (Xinhua) -- The East African Co-operation
(EAC) summit, originally set for this month, has been put off to
January 1999 or even later, a senior official with the Kenyan
Foreign Ministry told Xinhua Monday.
</P>
<P>
Presidents of Kenya, Tanzania and Uganda -- the three members
of EAC, were supposed to ratify the draft East African Community
Treaty at the November summit, said the official.
</P>
<P>
However, the treaty, aimed at a political federation and a
single market in the region, has not been passed by any
parliament of the region and now is likely to be signed by the
presidents around March next year, he said.
</P>
<P>
Earlier, Executive Secretary of the EAC Secretariat Francis
Muthaura also said the summit will be postponed "because of the
busy schedules of the heads of states," and the exact date is yet
to be decided.
</P>
<P>
According to Muthaura, the summit will also discuss a progress
report on the work of the Secretariat based in Arusha, northern
Tanzania, and an application by Rwanda for membership in the EAC.
</P>
<P>
The East African weekly Monday quoted sources as saying that
Uganda, which is Rwanda's close ally, thinks the application
shouldn't be ignored, but should wait for a solution to the
on-going conflict in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC).
</P>
<P>
Both Rwanda and Uganda reportedly have troops in the DRC in
support of rebels.

<P>
This is one of the three ways the province plans to use to find

Sending them abroad and developing the service sector are the
other two measures. Some 100,000 redundant workers will be sent
abroad over the coming three years, and at least 10,000 are
expected to get jobs in the service sector every year.
</P>
<P>
The province is also looking for ways to help the jobless by
establishing commercial outlets and re-employment service centers.
</P>
<P>
Vice-governor Guo Tingbiao says that the province plans to offer
jobs for 800,000 unemployed workers in the next three years.

<HEADLINE> Inner Mongolia Reduces Poverty </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HOHHOT, November 16 (Xinhua) -- Some 660,000 people living in
the Ulanquab League (Prefecture), in north China's Inner Mongolia
Autonomous Region, have escaped the jaws of poverty since 1994
when local authorities introduced a strategy of planting forests
and grass to halt desertification on once cultivatable land.
</P>
<P>
The league has planted trees on 123,000 hectares and grass on
additional 400,000 hectares. Ulanquab has also improved 104,600
hectares of existing pastoral areas and harnessed small river
valleys. The projects, completed at a cost of 25 million yuan, have
effectively curbed desertification in the league.
</P>
<P>
The league has witnessed a 33.3 percent drop in total
cultivatable land, but has nonetheless enjoyed a 50 percent rise
in total grain output and a 33.3 percent increase in its livestock
herd over the past four years. The total grain output for 1997
stood at 1.08 billion kilograms.
</P>
<P>
Implementation of the plans has benefitted over 660,000 people
who lived under the official poverty line of 500 yuan four
years ago, and substantially reduced the number of poor to only
100,000 by end of 1997. The per capita net income of farmers and
herdsmen has grown to 700 yuan.
</P>
<P>
A local leading official pledged to redouble efforts and plant
trees and grass on an additional 1.2 million hectares by the end
of the century in order to ensure all poverty-stricken people have
access to sufficient food and clothing by the year 2000.

<HEADLINE> Shanghai Regulations On International Freight Agents </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, November 16 (Xinhua) -- Shanghai has recently decided to
crack down on illegal international freight agents as part of a
national effort to regulate the freight business.
</P>
<P>
The city has penalized 10 overseas freight agents who were
engaged in illegal activities, according to Hu Zhonghua,
Vice-director of the Shanghai Foreign Trade and Economic
Cooperation Commission.
</P>
<P>
Shanghai has had 238 agents in the international shipping
business since 1984, more than 40 percent of whom are backed by
overseas companies and who handled three-fourths of the foreign
trade business in Shanghai.
</P>
<P>
But problems with agents have occurred. Hu says,
some representative offices act as agents and some of them do
business with licenses that were borrowed or bought from agents.
</P>
<P>
This is against the law and has caused problems in the freight
transport business and has involved tax evasion, Hu explains.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, November 16 (Xinhua) -- Tens of thousands of people
have kept their fingers crossed in hopes of clear weather early
Wednesday morning to provide a good view of the Leonid
Meteor Storm (LMS).
</P>
<P>
Scientists note that Leonid Meteors formed in the trail of dust
and debris behind the Tempel-Tuttle Comet which orbits the Sun
every 33 years. The Earth crosses the trail every November with
meteor storms occurring when the debris is especially dense.
</P>
<P>
Scientists predict that the year's storm will be particularly
dense, with the best viewing offered in Eastern Asia and the
Western Pacific Region.
</P>
<P>
Sun Kefeng, a student at Beijing University, plans to escape
the heavily polluted urban area and watch the astronomical event at
the Miyun Reservoir in suburban Beijing. Sun selected a site on a
small hill next to the reservoir.
</P>
<P>
About 2,000 Beijing stargazers, including astronomers,
scholars and astronomical novices, will visit the Xinglong, Miyun
and Shahe stations under the Beijing Astronomical Observatory to
watch the LMS.
</P>
<P>
Clear skies will enable people to observe more than 10,000
"shooting stars" an hour between 02:00-04:00 Wednesday morning.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese Central Meteorological Station forecasts that a
cold front from Mongolia will move into northeast and east China
tonight lowering temperatures by 10-14 degrees Celsius over the
next several days. They noted that the weather conditions will
most likely bring clear skies.
</P>
<P>
Stargazers in suburban Beijing and mountainous areas in Hebei
Province will face low temperatures 7-10 degrees below zero, while
their counterparts in northeast China will spend even cold night
outdoors on Wednesday morning.

<HEADLINE> Japan Unveils Largest Package to Spur Economy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TOKYO, November 16 (Xinhua) -- The Japanese government on
Monday unveiled a record 24 trillion yen (196.7 billion U.S.
dollars) package in a fresh effort to boost the country's economy.
</P>
<P>
With some 17 trillion yen (139.3 billion dollars) in actual
stimulus spending as its centerpiece, the package is Japan's
biggest push so far to tackle the severe economic situation. It
is far greater than the 16.65 trillion yen (136.4 billion dollars)
package released in April.
</P>
<P>
"The emergency measures were compiled with a strong resolve to
achieve a clear growth in fiscal 1999," Japanese Prime Minister
Keizo Obuchi told a press conference.
</P>
<P>
Japan's Economic Planning Agency chief Taichi Sakaiya told a
separate news conference that the package would push up the
country's gross domestic product (GDP) by more than 3 percentage
points over the next 12 months.
</P>
<P>
The fiscal spending portion of the package includes
infrastructure spending of 8.1 trillion yen (66.4 billion dollars)
and more than 6 trillion yen (49.2 billion dollars) in income and
corporate tax cuts.
</P>
<P>
Other major items in the package include 5.9 trillion yen (48.4
billion dollars) earmarked to ease the credit crunch by helping
companies obtain loans through such measures as expanded lending
by the Japan Development Bank.
</P>
<P>
The new package, Japan's eighth since the burst of the
country's "bubble" economy in the early 1990s, aims to achieve a
positive economic growth rate in the next fiscal year starting on
April 1.

<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, November 16 (Xinhua) -- Kenyan Minister of Energy
Chirs Okemo said his government has established an anti-dumping
committee to reduce purchase of oil products from illegal
sources, a national newspaper reported Monday.
</P>
<P>
Addressing a three-day Kobil/Kenol annual dealers and
distribution seminar at Mombasa, a coastal city in southern
Kenya, Okemo said the dumping of duty-free products had denied
the country millions of Shillings in revenue.
</P>
<P>
The government has taken necessary measures to ensure that
dumping and sales of oil products were completely eradicated, he
said.
</P>
<P>
The minister also warned unscrupulous traders who mixed motor
fuel with other cheaper products for quick rip-offs that it is
illegal and perpetrators risked prosecution.
</P>
<P>
He said the liberalization of the industry has challenged
dealers and distributors of oil products to invest in quality and
efficient delivery.
</P>
<P>
The government will continue with its support, the minister
said, adding the national long-term welfare depends on continued
investment in modern technology and resources.

<TEXT>
<P>
NANNING, November 16 (Xinhua) -- Chinese scientists say that
the rise in sea temperatures has led to the death of more than 20
species of coral in a 40-square-kilometer area around Weizhou
Island off China's Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region.
</P>
<P>
Environmental protection specialists did a several-month study
of a two-degree change caused by the El Nino phenomenon and found
a large number of corals and fish dead at Weizhou.
</P>
<P>
They found no evidence of pollution in the waters around Weizhou
Island and say that the ecosystem of coral is very fragile and
that continued high temperatures may affect the amount of brown
algae.
</P>
<P>
The death of coral around Weizhou Island has caused a
disruption of the ecological balance of the waters there.
</P>
<P>
The city of Beihai has asked the State Oceanic Administration
and State Environmental Protection Administration for solutions to
the problem.

<HEADLINE> PNG Government to Cut 7,000 Public Service Jobs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, November 16 (Xinhua) -- Papua New Guinea's (PNG)
government will reduce its 65,000 public servant force by 7,000 in
sweeping public service reforms announced in its 1999 budget
Monday.
</P>
<P>
Fifteen statutory authorities, agencies and committees will be
abolished and 21 national departments will be restructured, PNG
Treasurer Iairo Lasaro said.
</P>
<P>
The retrenchment exercise, which is expected to cost 65 million
kina (30 million U.S. dollars) in 1999 and another 60 million kina
(27 million dollars) in the two years after, will be financed
through the sale of state assets, according to budget papers.
</P>
<P>
Money saved through the public service retrenchments, totaling
more than 96 million kina (44 million dollars) in 1999, would be
redirected to much needed development projects in neglected rural
areas.
</P>
<P>
"The 1999 budget is a revolutionary budget," Lasaro said in his
budget speech.
</P>
<P>
"It is about a leaner but more effective government."
</P>
<P>
Lasaro announced a 1999 budget deficit of 80.1 million kina (37
million dollars), or 0.9 percent of PNG's annual gross domestic
product, compared to a revised 1998 budget deficit of 124.3
million kina (57 million dollars), or 1.6 percent of its GDP.
</P>
<P>
GDP is expected to grow in 1999 by 2.9 percent, compared to 2.5
percent in the financial year of 1998, Lasaro was quoted Monday by
the Australian Associated Press as saying.
</P>
<P>
The budget papers said the average inflation was projected to
decline to 8.0 percent in 1999, from 10 percent estimated for
1998.

<HEADLINE> Zimbabwean Dollar Showing Signs of Stabilizing: </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, November 16 (Xinhua) -- The Zimbabwean Dollar is
showing signs of stabilizing in response to the measures recently
put in place by the government to halt further depreciation of
currency, Minister of Finance Herbert Murerwa has said.
</P>
<P>
Speaking on the Zimbabwe TV Insight program Sunday night, the
minister said the cabinet sub-committee formed last week had
begun wide consultations with other stakeholders to put in place
measures that would ensure the stabilization of the Zimbabwean
Dollar.
</P>
<P>
"The governor of the Reserve Bank of Zimbabwe Leonard Tsumba
told me that the measures we put in place in September are
beginning to take effect as imports have declined. Our
Zimbabwean Dollar is now overvalued and it ought to firm up a
little further," said the minister.
</P>
<P>
The Zimbabwean Dollar was pegged at 37 to the U.S. Dollar at
the weekend. This year, the local currency was devalued by 60
percent.
</P>
<P>
But after recovering for a while, the Dollar came under
intense pressure again from importers as a result of the negative
sentiment that fed on the turmoil in the world financial markets
and the speculative fiscal repercussions of the Zimbabwe's
involvement in the conflict in the Democratic Republic of Congo
(DRC).
</P>
<P>
On how much Zimbabwe was spending in the DRC conflict and the
impact of the cost on the national fiscal budget, Murerwa said it
was minimal.
</P>
<P>
However, he emphasized the need for stability and peace in the
region as of paramount importance.

<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, November 16 (Xinhua) -- Shanghai has been making
progress in turning itself into an international shipping center,
according to an official of the Shanghai International Shipping
Center Leading Group.
</P>
<P>
Xu Baizhang, director of the office of the leading group, told
an international seminar here recently that Shanghai has basically
become an international shipping center in the years since 1995,
when the Chinese government came up with this ambitious goal.
</P>
<P>
Its port now has an annual handling capacity of 160 million
tons of cargo and 2.52 million TEUs (twenty-foot equivalent units)
and ranks 11th in the world in the container shipping business.
</P>
<P>
Several shipping services have been established like the
Shanghai International Shipping Service Center, and the Shanghai
Shipping Exchange which was set up in 1996, and publishes the
China Containerized Freight Index once a week.
</P>
<P>
The Combined Shanghai Port Administrative Commission opened

and Jiangsu into the international shipping center. And, more than
80 overseas shippers have subsidiaries or offices in Shanghai, and
China's three largest oceangoing shippers have moved their
headquarters to the metropolis.
</P>
<P>
In January of this year, a massive dredging project began at
the mouth of the Yangtze River to increase the depth of the
navigation channel from 7 meters now to 12.5 meters in 10 years
and more container berths are under construction in Shanghai, and
the metropolis is looking for a site for a new deep-water
container wharf.

<HEADLINE> Pastoral Land Transformed into Grain Base </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HOHHOT, November 16 (Xinhua) -- Inner Mongolia in north China,
one of the country's main pastoral regions, has emerged as a major
grain base and exporter in recent years.
</P>
<P>
The autonomous region has harvested a record 15.75 billion kg
of grain this year, after successive bumper harvests in the past
two years, according to Tan Zhaohua, an official of the regional
agricultural department.
</P>
<P>
The province also supplies several billion kg of grain to other
parts of the country on an annual basis, he said.
</P>
<P>
The region's per capita grain consumption has jumped to 600 kg,
ranking the third place in the country, compared with 26th in 1978.
</P>
<P>
Tan attributed the achievements to the implementation of the
household contract responsibility system introduced in 1981, the
development of the regional irrigation network and the
popularization of modern agricultural science.
</P>
<P>
The per-hectare grain output has jumped to 2,640 kg, twice the
1978 figure, and the acreage of high yield wheat, corn, beans and
rice has jumped annually.
</P>
<P>
In addition, the central and regional governments have invested
two billion yuan to construct 60 grain bases and comprehensively
develop agriculture since the 1980s. The efforts have effectively
raised the region's production capacity by two billion kg.
</P>
<P>
The region does not increase grain production at the expense of
animal husbandry, noted Tan, adding that the region's livestock
herd has continued to grow over the past 14 years, with this
year's figure climbing to a record 73 million head.

<HEADLINE> India to Get Russian Air Defense System Soon </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, November 16 (Xinhua) -- India will sign a long-term
defense cooperation pact with Russia that includes the sale of
S-300 air defense system, the Business Standard said here Monday.
</P>
<P>
The 1-billion-U.S.-dollar system is capable of targeting 10
missiles and 40 aircraft simultaneously to protect New Delhi,
capital of India, from missile and aircraft attacks. The U.S.-made
Patriot missile can track only 10 missiles at a time.
</P>
<P>
The pact is scheduled to be signed by the two countries when
Russian President Boris Yeltsin visits India early next month. The
pact was discussed between India and Russia when Indian Defense
Secretary Ajit Kumar visited Moscow last Monday. During the visit,
the two sides also discussed extending the current cooperation
pact between the two countries, which is to expire in 2000, till
2010.
</P>
<P>
The draft of the pact aims to give a political nod to
cooperation, at the forces and defense production agencies level,
for weapons sale, technology transfer and joint ventures. Speedy
clearances of pending proposals for weapons upgradation and
initiation of new modernization projects worth 2 billion dollars
are also envisaged in the pact.
</P>
<P>
Around 40 percent of Indian Army's artillery, cavalry and small
arms are of Russian origin. The figure is 80 percent for the Air
Force and 60 percent for the Navy.

<HEADLINE> Mounting Excitement in Anticipation of APEC Leaders Meeting </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Chinese President Jiang Zemin, whose special airplane touched
down in heavy rain at 8:40 pm Sunday, is going to deliver a
keynote speech calling for acceleration of economic and technical
cooperation and concerted efforts in dealing with the Asian
economic crisis.
</P>
<P>
Jiang will also have a series of meetings with leaders of other
countries and regions from Monday.
</P>
<P>
Hong Kong Chief Executive Tung Chee-hwa arrived an hour earlier
than Jiang and he waited at the VIP lounge and greeted Jiang at
the airport.
</P>
<P>
In a statement issued by his office, Tung said, "Amidst the
current economic situation, it is important for APEC to
demonstrate that it is getting its act together to address the
financial turmoil, and that it is firmly committed to progressive
trade and investment liberalization."
</P>
<P>
The absence of U.S. President Bill Clinton and Russian
President Boris Yeltsin, however, have not diminished the
excitements that surrounds this event. Vice President Al Gore and
Prime Minister Yevgeni Primakov will be their representatives.
</P>
<P>
South Korean President Kim Dae-jung and his wife arrived Sunday
afternoon after he concluded a state visit to China. Kim is
expected to deliver a keynote speech which will highlight current
reform measures under way in South Korea to enhance confidence in
the country's economy and address ways for regional and global
cooperation to overcome the current financial and economic crisis.
</P>
<P>
Philippine President Joseph Estrada, who is expected to arrive
here Monday, will make his international debut at the APEC meeting.
</P>
<P>
Other leaders who will be at the meeting include Australian
Prime Minister John Howard, Brunei Darussalam Sultan Haji Hassanal
Bolkiah, Canadian Prime Minister Joseph Chretien, Chilean
President Eduardo Tagle, Indonesian President B.J. Habibie,
Japanese Prime Minister Keizo Obuchi, Mexican President Ernesto
Zedillo, New Zealand Prime Minister Jenny Shipley, Papua New
Guinea President Joseph Estrada, Singapore Prime Minister Goh Chok
Tong, Dr. Chiang Pin-kung of Chinese Taipei, Thai Prime Minister
Chuan Leekpai, Peruvian President Alberto Fujimori and Vietnamese
Prime Minister Phan Van Khai.
</P>
<P>
Meticulous preparations have been made so far to ensure the
meeting a success. The biggest of it is believed to be
security. At the Palace of Golden Horses, the main venue of the
meeting, "newsmen roam the plushly carpeted corridors under the
watchful eyes of the police," according to the local New Straits
Times.
</P>
<P>
As for the meeting itself, the current economic crisis will
challenge APEC economies to respond directly to the financial
problems. The newly cropped-up Iraq crisis has also become a hot
topic among the ministers and the media although it is not on the
agenda of the meeting.
</P>
<P>
A Brunei corporate leader, Timothy Ong, was quoted as saying,
"There is a great need for something like APEC to provide us with
a framework in which economically, politically and culturally very
diverse society can seek a common path of world economic
cooperation."

<HEADLINE> Chirac Welcomes Iraq's Resumption of Cooperation With UN </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MEXICO CITY, November 15 (Xinhua) -- Visiting French President
Jacques Chirac said on Sunday in Guatemala that he welcomed Iraq's
decision on unconditional resumption of cooperation with the U.N.
arms inspectors.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a joint press conference with Guatemalan President
Arzu Irigoyev, Chirac said an impending military conflict was
warded off thanks to Iraq's decision to allow the U.N. weapons
inspectors to return and resume their mission.
</P>
<P>
However, the French president warned that the Iraqi government
should understand if it fails to keep its word another time and
breaks off cooperation with the U.N. Special Commission (UNSCOM)
on Iraq's disarmament, it may face military strikes any time.
</P>
<P>
The consequences, he said, would be beyond imagination.
</P>
<P>
Chirac reiterated that there is nothing negotiatable over the
U.N. arms inspections on Iraq. Iraq must unconditionally allow
the inspectors to return.
</P>
<P>
The French president, who has come to Guatemala to inspect the
aftermath of the hurricane Mitch, said the international community
would never allow Iraq to tear off its new agreement with the
United Nations.
</P>
<P>
He said he consulted with the U.S. President Bill Clinton and
British Prime Minister Tony Blair over the settlement of the Iraq
crisis for 55 minutes over the telephone on Saturday night.
</P>
<P>
Chirac, the first French president to visit Guatemala, arrived
in the Central American country last Friday after a three-day
state visit to Mexico.
</P>
<P>
He is scheduled to head for Honduras Tuesday to continue his
Latin American trip.

<HEADLINE> Bangladesh's Ruling Party Decides Never to Call Strike </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, November 16 (Xinhua) -- Bangladeshi Prime Minister
Sheikh Hasina Sunday declared that her Awami League would never
call hartal (strike), even it returned to the opposition, media
reports said Monday.
</P>
<P>
"My party will never call hartal," she said categorically while
exchanging views with editors of national dailies and news
agencies in the capital Sunday.
</P>
<P>
"I am making this announcement unilaterally both as the prime
minister and the president of the Awami League," she added.
</P>
<P>
Her announcement was made at the heels of main opposition the
Bangladesh National Party's (BNP's) 60-hour hartal enforced across
the country from November 9.
</P>
<P>
She tried hard to justify the past hartals called by the Awami
League while in opposition, saying that those hartals were "to
establish people's rights".
</P>
<P>
Hasina also told the editors that the government has already
announced that general election will be held in 2000, one year
ahead of the schedule, she said, replying to a question about the
opposition's demand for a mid-term election.
</P>
<P>
Leaders of other political parties expressed mixed reaction
over Hasina's announcement. Some hailed it while others refrained
from giving any reaction.
</P>
<P>
Leader of the BNP Begum Khaleda Zia has refrained from
immediate reaction to Hasina's offer to renounce hartal by the
parties, saying "I am not aware anything about the statement", The
New Nation daily reported.
</P>
<P>
Business leaders also hailed Hasina's announcement, observing
that the prime minister's call to avoid hartal created an
opportunity to ensure political stability which is urgently needed
to achieve desired economic growth, the report added.

BONN, November 15 (Xinhua) -- German Vice-chancellor and
Foreign Minister Joschka Fischer Sunday welcomed U.S. President
Bill Clinton's statement which averted an imminent military strike
on Iraq.
</P>
<P>
Fischer said in a statement that the new development has
created condition for effective and continued supervisions over the
production of weapons of mass destruction in Iraq.
</P>
<P>
Clinton announced earlier Sunday in a statement in Washington
that Iraq had "backed down" on weapons inspections and
"unconditionally" allowed United Nations weapons inspectors to
return to Baghdad.
</P>
<P>
Fischer said Iraq must "unconditionally and fully" comply with
U.N. resolutions on weapons inspections.
</P>
<P>
"Only in this way can the Persian Gulf keep peace and stability
and the international sanctions against Iraq be called off," he
said.
</P>
<P>
The new German foreign minister said last Monday in Moscow that
his country hoped the Iraq crisis would be resolved through
diplomatic efforts and declined to comment on such questions as
how Germany would react if the United States struck Iraq.
</P>
<P>
German media blamed Fischer for not offering sufficient support
to the U.S.
</P>
<P>
Observers here said the new German government has been cautious
on the Iraq crisis, maintaining a stance between the tough one of
the United States and Britain on one side, and the mild one of
France on the other. enditem

<HEADLINE> One Third of Babies Unregistered in World </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, November 16 (Xinhua) -- One in every three babies in
the world, or 40 million, are denied their "first right" of birth
registration, a representative attending the Fourth Ministerial
Consultation on Child and Development in East Asia and the Pacific
said Monday.
</P>
<P>
According to an NGO forum parallel to the ministerial meeting,
organized by the United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF) last
week, one in every three babies born in the world goes
unregistered each year.
</P>
<P>
It is estimated that 24 million children born in Southeast Asia
and the Pacific are not registered.
</P>
<P>
Children without registration are legally non-person and are
therefore denied access to privileges and protection provided to
citizens of a country.
</P>
<P>
They also become more vulnerable to exploitation, the
representative said.
</P>
<P>
In most cases, proof of identity and age is required in
transactions such as applying for employment, marriage, claims and
benefits, travel and adoption.
</P>
<P>
In addition, documented children will be less likely victims of
sex traffickers.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. Convention on Rights of the Child stipulates that
"the child shall be registered immediately after birth to a name
(and) the right to acquire nationality."

<HEADLINE> Thai Consumer Protection Groups Call For Non-Buying Day </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, November 16 (Xinhua) -- Consumer-protection groups of
Thailand urged the public to only buy essential goods on the
National Non-buying Day, set to coincide with the National
Consumer Protection Day on April 30, in an attempt to encourage
sensible buying and responsible selling, the Nation said Monday.
</P>
<P>
The 26 consumer advocates also called on government departments
to allocate budgets for consumer protection as well as for private
businesses, and to take strong and effective measures to protect
consumers.
</P>
<P>
The groups said April 30 was chosen as the National Non-Buying
Day because it is already known as the National Consumer
Protection Day.
</P>
<P>
The groups are expected to call on people to refrain from
buying goods which are not necessary on that day.
</P>
<P>
On Sunday, the consumer groups held their first consumer forum,
where about 60 items of low quality, sub-standard products and
services were demonstrated to the public.
</P>
<P>
The object of the meeting was to encourage consumers to become
more aware of their rights, and to speak out against violation.
</P>
<P>
A lack of awareness among consumers and irresponsible
advertising of products with exaggerated claims have created an
unnecessary demand and led to over consumption, according to the
groups.

NEW DELHI, November 16 (Xinhua) -- India's plastic processing
industry plans to introduce a new coding system to facilitate
recycling of plastic waste in the country, official sources said

</P>
<P>
Polybags with a gauge of 20-25 microns would be used for virgin
plastic material while those of 25 microns and above would be
recycled. This would help check littering of polybags after single
use.
</P>
<P>
The plastic industry has also drawn up a coloring code. Under
this new code, natural colors would be used for virgin plastic
which would be used for packing edible items, while colored
recycled polybags would be used for other items.
</P>
<P>
At the same time, the plastic industry has also set up an
Indian center for plastics in environment in a bid for advancement

<HEADLINE> Waterfalls Discovered in World's Largest Canyon </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
RONGZA (Tibet), November 16 (Xinhua) -- A team of Chinese
scientists recently reported the discovery of seven waterfalls
which formed only some 20 years ago in the Yarlong Zangbo River
Canyon, the world largest canyon on the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau.
</P>
<P>
The grand canyon is locally known as the Yarlong Zangbo Daxiagu.
</P>
<P>
Expedition leader Gao Dengyi said that large multi-level
waterfalls are rarely found along the mainstreams of the world's
major.
</P>
<P>
The largest of the seven so-called Rongza Waterfalls is some 30
meters in height and 50 meters wide.
</P>
<P>
The waterfalls are found at an elevation of 1,680 meters above
sea level along the mainstream of the Yarlong Zangbo River.
</P>
<P>
Gao said the relatively recent formation of the waterfalls
indicates the strong movement of the canyon's geological
structures during the upheaval on the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau.
</P>
<P>
He added that more waterfalls will likely form along with the
continuing movement of geological structures.
</P>
<P>
The canyon is 496 km in length and has an average depth of
5,000 meters.
</P>
<P>
The team commenced its 50-day expedition in late October.

<HEADLINE> Myanmar May Flower Bank Opens 11 Branch Offices </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
YANGON, November 16 (Xinhua) -- The Myanmar May Flower Bank,
one of the three leading private financial institutions, has
opened 11 branch offices throughout the country.
</P>
<P>
The bank is providing banking services efficiently with the use
of modern equipment and system, Myanmar Minister of Finance and
Revenue U Khin Maung Thein was quoted by Monday's official
newspaper The New Light of Myanmar as saying.
</P>
<P>
At an opening ceremony of the bank's new branch office in
Mandalay Sunday, U Khin Maung Thein noted that the country's
financial sector plays a key role in practicing the
market-oriented economic system.
</P>
<P>
There are 21 private banks in Myanmar with the Asia Wealth Bank
(AWB), the Yoma Bank and the May Flower Bank leading in banking
activities.
</P>
<P>
The AWB has 16 branch offices having the highest number of
branches operating across the country.
</P>
<P>
According to official statistics, people's savings at the
private banks constituted 38 percent of the total which reached
101.35 billion kyats (337 million U.S. dollars) at the end of
1997, increasing by 13 percent over the previous year.
</P>
<P>
In order to strengthen the ties among the private banks, six of
them reached an accord in June 1997 on internal remittances among
them.
</P>
<P>
Among the private banks, seven are allowed to conduct foreign
exchange transactions in the wake of the country's expanding
foreign trade activities.
</P>
<P>
The country's financial reform has now entered the second phase
after memorandums of understanding on setting up joint venture
banks were signed respectively between six Myanmar private banks
and six foreign ones, which have already opened representative
offices in the country.
</P>
<P>
A total of 49 foreign banks from 16 countries and regions,
mostly from Japan, Thailand, France, Singapore, Malaysia and the
Republic of Korea, have set up representative offices in Myanmar
since the country reformed its financial management system in line
with the market-oriented economic policy introduced in late 1988.

UNDP spokesman S. A. Madsen here was quoted as saying that the
radio equipment, which is necessary for landmine clearing
activities, was being programmed in Colombo and it would take
three weeks to ship the equipment to Jaffna where it will be
subjected to testing.
</P>
<P>
He said the UNDP hoped to embark on a full-scale landmine
removal program in the Jaffna peninsula early next year.
</P>
<P>
Phase one of the project is to gather information from Jaffna
residents as to where these landmines are located.
</P>
<P>
The landmine clearing project will concentrate on resettlement
areas with an aim to boost civilian settlement in the peninsula.
</P>
<P>
The Jaffna peninsula was once the stronghold of the Tamil
rebels, who have been waging a 15-year war against the Sri Lankan
government for a separate state in the north and east of the
country.
</P>
<P>
Sri Lankan government troops recaptured the Jaffna peninsula in
May 1996.

<HEADLINE> Thai Government to Cut Spending Through Reform </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, November 16 (Xinhua) -- Up to 18.27 billion baht (490
million U.S. dollars) could be saved if government agencies
implement the bureaucratic reform plans they have proposed, a
government official said Monday.
</P>
<P>
If the so-called re-engineering plan goes ahead, the Education
Ministry will be the agency to cut spending most, up to 7 billion
baht (189 million dollars), while the Public Health Ministry would
cut 5.55 billion baht (150 million dollars), the official said.
</P>
<P>
The planned re-engineering is part of the implementation of a
cabinet resolution last year.
</P>
<P>
The resolution requires government agencies to eliminate
redundant operations, increase efficiency and reduce expenses,
endorsing a proposal of the Civil Services Commission.
</P>
<P>
Each ministry is required by the resolution to regularly update
their study on these issues to the Civil Service Commission, the
Finance Ministry and the Budget Bureau and the three agencies will
evaluate the studies and present reports to the cabinet.
</P>
<P>
The commission would cooperate with the Finance Ministry and
Budget Bureau to organize public hearings in each ministry about
the plan starting this month and lasting till March next year.

<HEADLINE> Ecuador's Banana Exports Drop Sharply </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
QUITO, November 15 (Xinhua) -- Ecuador's banana exports during
the first 10 months of this year plummeted 19.2 percent to 2.81
million tons, from 3.47 million tons in the same period of 1997.
</P>
<P>
According to the latest statistics of the Association of
Ecuadoran Banana Planters, banana exports this year, except for
February and July, declined by varying degrees in comparison with
the corresponding months of last year, with May seeing the largest
decline of 32 percent.
</P>
<P>
From January to October, Ecuador's banana exports to China fell
to 75,000 tons, or by 74 percent, from 291,000 tons in the same
period last year, while to Russia down by 33.3 percent, from 4.72
million to 3.15 million tons.
</P>
<P>
It is estimated that banana exports to Asia for the full year
of 1998 would sag to 300,000 tons from 400,000 in 1997, mainly due
to the effects of the El Nino and the world financial chaos.
</P>
<P>
However, analysts here predicted that during the last two
months this year and in the next year the country's banana exports
would be expected to pick up rapidly because of the crushing blow
dealt by the hurricane Mitch at the banana productions in Central
American states.

<HEADLINE> LDP-Backed Candidate Wins Okinawa Gubernatorial Election </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TOKYO, November 16 (Xinhua) -- Keiichi Inamine, a candidate
backed by Japan's ruling Liberal Democratic Party (LDP), won
Okinawa gubernatorial election on Sunday, bringing the prefecture
under conservative rule for the first time in eight years.
</P>
<P>
Inamine's victory over incumbent Governor Masahide Ota is
expected to help Prime Minister Keizo Obuchi's cabinet proceed
with its policy of reorganizing and reducing U.S. military
presence in Okinawa, Kyoto News reported.
</P>
<P>
Ota, 73, backed by the Democratic Party of Japan, the Communist
Party, the Social Democratic Party and two other smaller parties,
was seeking his third four-year term as governor.
</P>
<P>
Final results showed that Inamine garnered 374,833 votes
against Ota's 337,369.
</P>
<P>
The main issue in the election was a government proposal to
build a sea-based heliport off Nago, about 50 kilometers northeast
of the Okinawa capital Naha, to replace the heliport functions of
the U.S. Marine Corps' Futenma Air Station in Ginowan, which is
to be closed.
</P>
<P>
Inamine, 65, an adviser to a group of local business leaders,
has proposed building a military-commercial airport in northern
Okinawa that would be used by the U.S. military for a limited
period of time.
</P>
<P>
Ota, however, called for relocation of Futenma's facilities
outside the prefecture, either in or outside Japan, including Guam
and Hawaii.
</P>
<P>
The central government hopes that Inamine's victory will help
break the current deadlock between the central and local
governments over the relocation site of the Futenma base.
</P>
<P>
During the 15-day election campaign, Inamine focused his
attacks on the serious unemployment situation in Okinawa and on
Ota's economic policies, instead of the base issues.
</P>
<P>
Okinawa has the highest unemployment rate in Japan, or 9.2
percent, and the lowest per-capita income.
</P>
<P>
Voters of the economically depressed prefecture apparently
chose Inamine's aggressive economic policy rather than Ota's
steadfast opposition to the presence of U.S. bases, observers
said.

<HEADLINE> China Welcomes Positive Developments Over Iraq Crisis </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, November 15 (Xinhua) -- China welcomes the
positive developments in the past few days towards a peaceful
solution of the Iraq crisis, Ambassador Qin Huasun said here
Sunday.
</P>
<P>
"We wish to see a comprehensive implementation of the relevant
(security) council resolutions by Iraq and an early lifting of
sanctions against Iraq," he told the press soon after the Security
Council ended informal consultations on the Iraqi issue.
</P>
<P>
Qin, China's permanent representative to the United Nations,
said China hopes that the U.N. Special Commission in charge of
Iraq's disarmament (UNSCOM) and the International Atomic Energy
Agency (IAEA) will immediately resume their work in Iraq.
</P>
<P>
"We also hope that UNSCOM, which remains the subsidiary body of
the council and should be solely responsible to the council, will
work strictly according to its mandate given by the relevant
council resolutions and according to the MOU (Memorandum of
Understanding) which includes respect for the sovereignty and
dignity of Iraq," he said.
</P>
<P>
The MOU, signed by U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan and the
Iraqi Government on February 23, serves as a guidance for
U.N. arms inspection and monitoring activities in Iraq.
</P>
<P>
The disarmament of Iraq is a prerequisite for lifting sanctions
against Iraq. The sanctions have remained since Iraq's invasion
of Kuwait in 1990.

<HEADLINE> Sino-Vietnamese Border Trade Doing Better Now </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NANNING, November 16 (Xinhua) -- Sino-Vietnamese border trade,
which began in 1952, was cut off in 1978 and then resumed in 1989,
has developed rapidly in the recent nine years.
</P>
<P>
An official from the Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region bordering
Viet Nam, said that they did 3.1 billion yuan worth of trade with
Viet Nam in 1997, which was 6.9 times that the 1989 figure.
</P>
<P>
Guangxi and Viet Nam share a 1,020-kilometer border and the
Chinese have four state-level ports of entry in Pingxiang,
Youyiguan, Dongxing and Shuikou, eight local-level ports of entry,
and 25 outlets for border trade, which mainly deals with Chinese
light industrial products and Vietnamese agricultural by-products.
</P>
<P>
The border trade has increased local revenues and the standard
of living. In the city of Pingxiang, about 13,000 people are
involved in the border trade, and some have got out of poverty
this way. Average annual income of peasants there has risen from
551 yuan in 1992 to 1,830 yuan at present, and the number of
people living in poverty has fallen from 300,000 in 1992 to
5,800.

<P>
SHANGHAI, November 16 (Xinhua) -- The United States' Butler,
the large light steel structure manufacturer, recently began
purchasing steel plate from Shanghai's Baoshan Iron and Steel
Group.
</P>
<P>
Butler moved its Asian-Pacific regional headquarters to
Shanghai last year. The U.S. company, which used to get steel
products only from Japan and the Republic of Korea, supplies light
steel structures for some of Shanghai's foreign-funded firms.
</P>
<P>
It turned to Baoshan this June with the first purchase of
nearly 6,000 tons of light steel plate. Orders for 2,000 tons are
likely in the remainder of this year, according to well-informed
sources.
</P>
<P>
In related news, the China New Star Petroleum Company, which
has been developing oilfields in the Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous
Region, has purchased 675 drill rods, worth over 2.6 million yuan,
from Baoshan.
</P>
<P>
This makes New Star the first company to buy these products
from Baoshan and means an end to dependence on imported drill rods
by local oil drillers.

XI'AN, November 16 (Xinhua) -- Zhao Yang, 31, lost his

but now works as a vice-president for a private enterprise with
400 million yuan (48.19 million US dollars) in total assets.
</P>

Zhao is only one example of the 200,000 laid-off workers who

businesses growing by 26 percent to 694,000 and the number of
private enterprises rising by 67 percent to over 32,000 within
only nine months.

<HEADLINE> Indonesian Opposition Leaders Questioned by Police </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, November 16 (Xinhua) -- Several Indonesian opposition
figures were picked up by police on Sunday for questioning in
connection with alleged conspiracy against the government, Antara
News Agency reported Monday.
</P>
<P>
Kemal Idris, chief of the opposition National Front group,
former Jakarta governor Ali Sadikin and other 15 opposition
leaders last Thursday issued a joint communique, calling for the
establishment of a "Provisional People's Consultative Assembly"
and, eventually, a presidium which would serve as a provisional
government.
</P>
<P>
Retired Army lieutenant general Kemal Idris was taken in for
questioning at police headquarters early Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Retired marine lieutenant general Ali Sadikin, who is also a
member of the National Front, was picked up later in the day.
</P>
<P>
It was reported that government officials have tacitly spread
the news that the National Front is behind the student
demonstrations that have rocked Jakarta for three days since
Thursday. They hinted that the signatories of the joint communique
could be charged for attempting to overthrow the government.
</P>
<P>
According to Hidayat of the National Front presidium, the joint
communique is only an idea or moral movement as a contribution to
the nation although he admitted that it could be a political
power. The communique has nothing to do with the mass movements
occurring after the People's Consultative Assembly (MPR) special
session, he added.
</P>
<P>
Kemal Idris himself openly told private television station SCTV
on Saturday that "I am behind the student demonstrations."
However, it's not clear whether he meant that he personally or the
National Front was providing funds for the movement.
</P>
<P>
Other figures questioned by police on Sunday were Indonesian
United Democracy Party Chairman Sri Bintang Pamungkas, retired
military officer Roch Basoeki and head of the University of
Indonesia Alumni Association Hariadi Dharmawan. Dharmawan is also
the in-law of former vice president Try Sutrisno.
</P>
<P>
Following last week's mass demonstrations in the capital city,
President B.J. Habibie said it was seen that certain groups in the
society had tried to act against the law and constitution by
mobilizing the masses to force their will.
</P>
<P>
At least 14 persons including several students were killed in
violent clashes with security forces during the demonstrations
against the special session on Friday and Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Habibie has instructed Minister of Defense and
Security/Commander of the Armed Forces on Saturday to take stern
measures against those violating the law.

</P>
<P>
Council members expressed support for a full, immediate and
effective implementation of the humanitarian program in Iraq.
</P>
<P>
Council members reaffirmed their readiness to proceed with a
comprehensive review, once the Secretary-General has confirmed, on
the basis of reports form the Special Commission and the IAEA,
that Iraq has returned to full cooperation, on the basis of

HANOI, November 15 (Xinhua) -- The Vietnamese government will
step up administrative reform as one of the major measures to
achieve the targets of socio-economic development set for 1999, a
media report said.
</P>
<P>
Vietnam News Agency (VNA) reported Sunday that "administrative

have still shown bureaucracy in conducting public affairs and that
they should be responsible for their weaknesses and quickly
improve their conduct of public affairs.

According to Pham Si Danh, chief of the office of the Ministry
of Finance, the ministry is focusing on reforming administrative
policies, administrative apparatus, and administrative procedures.

</P>
<P>
The capital city of Hanoi and Ho Chi Minh City's authorities

<P>
Signed by Coordinating Minister for Economy, Finance and
Industry Ginandjar Kartasasmita on Friday, the letter said there
is increasing evidence that macro stability is being restored and
that the economy's decline may finally be bottoming out.
</P>
<P>
The government as well as the IMF expect a deflation in
November and December, meaning the full-year inflation could fall
below the IMF-set target of 80 percent.
</P>
<P>
The crisis-hit economy is expected to contract 15 percent in
1998.
</P>
<P>
The country said in the letter that the economy has shown
clearer signs of recovery -- the strengthening of the rupiah
against the U.S. dollar, slowing inflation and a
lower-than-expected budget deficit.
</P>
<P>
"Inflation has subsided, helped by the strengthening rupiah and
improved food availability. Inflation would fall towards 10
percent during 1999," it said.
</P>
<P>
On the much-debated capital monitoring plan, the government
said it remains committed to a free foreign exchange system.
</P>
<P>
The government pledged no surrender or repatriation
requirements or capital controls, it said.

<P>
YANGON, November 16 (Xinhua) -- Myanmar and Laos are due to
hold their first meeting of border authorities at the central
level here later Monday.
</P>
<P>
A Lao delegation, led by Vice-Minister of Foreign Affairs
Phongsavath Boupha, arrived here Sunday evening for the meeting.
</P>
<P>
In September last year, Boupha met his former Myanmar

<TEXT>
<P>
TIRANA, November 15 (Xinhua) -- The North Atlantic Treaty
Organization (NATO) is making preparations for deploying forces in
Macedonia as part of its operation Eagle Eye to conduct airborne
surveillance over the Yugoslav province of Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
Dozens of NATO military personnel are laying groundwork in
Macedonia, the southern neighbor of Kosovo, for the deployment of
forces, news reports from Skopjie said.
</P>
<P>
Under the airborne mission plan, NATO will send 1,500 to 1,800
troops to Macedonia, of whom 900, including the commander, are
French.
</P>
<P>
The Macedonian Defense Ministry said most of the forces, which
will serve as a rapid "extraction" force to pluck Kosovo monitors
to safety in case of a threat, will be stationed in the Kumanovo
garrison.
</P>
<P>
The time for the NATO forces' stationing in Macedonia is not
yet known. The organization is reportedly waiting to see the
attitude of the new Macedonian government to be formed soon.

<HEADLINE> China's Industrial Investment Growth Expected to Slow Down </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, November 16 (Xinhua) -- China's industrial investments
is expected to grow by about 10 percent next year, the lowest
ratio in the national economy, according to the State Information
Center.
</P>
<P>
The low rate is predicted on the basis of the current situation
under which supplies of major industrial goods exceed
demand. Therefore, the government is likely to reduce the ratio of
its industrial investments and emphasize technological upgrades,
an official with the center.
</P>
<P>
Investments in the energy sector, especially in the
construction or transformation of rural power grids, will remain
at the average rate for the industry.
</P>
<P>
The raw materials sector had a negative growth of 16.3 percent
in 1997. Therefore, the growth rate of government investments in
the sector for both this year and 1999 will not exceed three
percent.
</P>
<P>
Next year's investments in the machinery and electronic
products sector will remain roughly the same as this year, while
investment in the construction sector is expected to grow at a
rate of more than 30 percent growth due to fast increasing demand
especially for commercial housing.

<HEADLINE> U.N. Ready to Review Iraq's Compliance </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, November 15 (Xinhua) -- The U.N. Security
Council reaffirmed its readiness to proceed with a comprehensive
review of Iraq's compliance with the U.N. resolutions, council
President Peter Burleigh said in a statement on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
But the review will be based on condition that the U.N. Special
Commission for disarmament of Iraq (UNSCOM) and the International
Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) have confirmed that Iraq has resumed
full cooperation with the U.N. agencies, Burleigh said at the end
of closed-door consultations of the council.
</P>
<P>
"Council members expressed support for a full, immediate and
effective implementation of the humanitarian program in Iraq," the
president said.
</P>
<P>
The council has since Friday tried to reach consensus on
resuming arms inspections in Iraq, and that was reached only after
long consultations and diplomatic efforts involving U.N. Secretary
General Kofi Annan and the Security Council.
</P>
<P>
Earlier Sunday, U.S. President Bill Clinton acknowledged that
Iraq had backed down unconditionally, but said Iraqi President
Saddam Hussein could not be trusted.
</P>
<P>
If the Iraqi government fails to keep its word, overwhelming
force remains an option, Clinton warned.
</P>
<P>
Iraq halted U.N. inspections on October 31, saying it would
resume cooperation with the arms experts only if the council moved
to lift sanctions imposed after Iraq's 1990 invasion of
Kuwait. The sanctions have paralyzed Iraq's oil exports, the
country's economic mainstay.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Doctors Operate on Baby with Malformed Head </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, November 16 (Xinhua) -- An eight-month-old boy with a
triangular-shaped head has been given a normal appearance with the
help of doctors at the No. 9 People's Hospital of Shanghai's No.2
Medical Science University.
</P>
<P>
Song Dehao's head stopped growing and remained in the
triangular shape when he was five months old. Doctors said that
the baby was suffering from a disease called congenital early
closure of multiple cranial sutures, which harms the proper growth
of the brain.
</P>
<P>
Doctors cut off the complete top of the boy's skull and
reshaped 10 pieces of frontal bone, orbital bone, and other bones
to get them to conform to their proper shape. The orbital bone was
moved forward 1.5 centimeters, leaving enough space for the growth
of the brain.
</P>
<P>
The baby is now in good condition one month of the operation.

<HEADLINE> Lawmakers Block Government Fuel Tax Plan (2) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The government has expressed its ardent desire to see the bill
approved in order to ensure that reform can be introduced on
January 1, 1999. The transportation and finance ministers
explained the content of the bill during one legislative session.
</P>
<P>
One legislator said the rate event indicated that the NPC
Standing Committee is playing an ever more active role in China's
political and economic life, as well as in other aspects of
social development.
</P>
<P>
He said that unlike western style government and parliament
relations, China's NPC Standing Committee and the State Council
are both under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and
tend to engage in close cooperation, according to the legislator.
</P>
<P>
He added that the two bodies are free of conflicts related to
partisan interests and instead work to ensure the common interests
of Chinese citizens, according to aspiration of servicing the
people, he said.
</P>
<P>
The NPC Standing Committee and related departments under the
State Council will be required to provide detailed plans for
reimbursing farmers for non-highway fuel consumption. In
addition, the method of distributing tax funds to local
governments must be refined in order to protect local interests.
</P>
<P>
Officials noted that the NPC Standing Committee must properly
handle related work during its next session in late December. They
also noted that amendments will quite likely be adopted and the
"tax versus fee" reform plan will be implemented as planned.
</P>
<P>
Government statistics show that for 1996, 249 kinds of highway
and automobile fees produced annual revenue of 116 billion
yuan. "The heavy burden on the public is posing a serious threat
to social stability," according to one legislator.
</P>
<P>
The new government plan calls for the cancellation of 216 kinds
of fees, which will reduce the economic burden on Chinese
citizens by as much as 15.1 billion yuan.

BEIJING, November 16 (Xinhua) - China's State Council will be
forced to start from scratch to mend the reform plan designed to
replace highway fees with a new tax within less than two months or
reforms scheduled for next year will be put on hold.
</P>
<P>
The National People's Congress Standing Committee met recently
and failed to approve the government bill for amending the highway
law and pave the way for reform.
</P>
<P>
The government told the lawmakers that a highly centralized
taxation system managed by the central government would operate
much more effectively than the existing unregulated system which
allows the unreasonable or illegal levies along the highways and
will in turn help to "reduce financial burdens on Chinese citizens."
</P>
<P>
Lawmakers reaffirmed the necessity for related reform. However,
they noted that reforms will increase burdens on farmers who will
be required to pay more for farm machinery. They noted that the
conflict of interests between localities and the central government
must also be considered.
</P>
<P>
The NPC Standing Committee postponed the vote on the government
bill at the last minute and noted that legislators need more time
to consider constructive opinions. The bill will be tabled once
again during the committee's next session.

"It is a victory for diplomacy and resolve.

"For the crisis to be put permanently behind us, Iraq must move

for the people of Iraq," he said.
</P>
<P>
Replying to questions, Annan said he "cannot give any guarantee
that this agreement would work."
</P>
<P>
"I sincerely hope that there will not be a next time as you
know, I've been in lots of meetings, lots of discussions, both

if there is a next time we would even have time for further
diplomatic initiatives and appeals," he added.

<P>
A Steve Froggatt thunderbolt after quarter of an hour flew
past Thomas Myhre into the visitors' goal and set the tone for
the entire match.
</P>
<P>
Everton, without a win in their last five league matches now,
rarely threatened and showed almost no imagination. When Darren
Huckerby struck Coventry's second goal three minutes after the
break the match was effectively over.
</P>
<P>
Former Leeds striker Noel Whelan was finally rewarded for his
persistence when he slammed the ball high into the net at the
second chance for Coventry's third goal seconds before the final
whistle.
</P>
<P>
The defeat left Everton 17th in the 20-team league.

<HEADLINE> Financial Policy to Remain China's Economic Leverage Next Year </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CHANGSHA, November 16 (Xinhua) -- Lu Benqiang, deputy director
of the Development Research Center of China's State Council, said
here recently that financial leverage will continue to play an
important role in China's economic growth next year, but that it
will be a short-term rather than long-term policy.
</P>
<P>
China has increased investment in infrastructure and boosted
demand especially in rural area, he said, adding that the Central
Government is discussing how to increase these policies next year.
</P>
<P>
Sustained economic growth needs healthy small and medium-sized
enterprises, which are the majority of China's businesses, he
said, and suggested more loans and investment, and tax and fare
cuts for these enterprises.
</P>
<P>
According to a report from the center, a central government
think tank, China will quite likely reach its goal of eight
percent growth this year.
</P>
<P>
But, Lu pointed out that growth does not guarantee efficiency,
and he warned about projects that were started simply for the sake
of growth, saying they would pose a threat to economic development
in the long run.

<HEADLINE> Davenport to Defend Her World No. 1 Ranking </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
"Getting to No. 1 was such a huge step in my career after
winning the U.S. Open," Davenport said. "To try and finish the
year No.1 would be amazing."
</P>
<P>
Davenport, who lost to Steffi Graf of Germany in today's final
at the Advanta Championships in Philadelphia, dominated the Corel
WTA Tour this summer.
</P>
<P>
The Chase Championships begin Monday and conclude next Sunday
with a best-of-5 sets final, the only time during the year women
play more than three sets. The top 16 female players in the world
are competing in the tournament with the winner's check is
500,000 dollars.
</P>
<P>
"Staying at No.1 is probably going to be the hardest thing
that I've ever tried to do in my tennis career," Davenport said.
"But I'm going to try." Davenport will face Sandrine Testud in
the opening match. Davenport is leading the first ranking spot to
Martina Hingis of Switzerland by 266 points. Hingis lost the
place on October 12.
</P>
<P>
Besides Davenport, also seeking the Chase title are Hingis,
French Open champion Arantxa Sanchez-Vicario of Spain, runner-up
Monica Seles of the United States, Wimbledon winner Jana Novotna
of the Czech Republic, former world No. 1 Graf.
</P>
<P>
"It's great for women's tennis. It's great for the players,
"defending champion Novotna said of the strong competition. "Th
ere was a period when a player dominated when they won
everything. Now it's wide open. Anybody can win any tournament."
</P>
<P>
Novotna will face Graf, who hit her best form recently after
two years of injuries.

<HEADLINE> Retail Sales Expected to Rise 9 Percent in China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, November 16 (Xinhua) -- China's retail sales are
expected to rise by about nine percent and prices to continue to
drop in 1998, according to the State Administration of Internal
Trade.
</P>
<P>
In its latest prediction, the administration said that consumer
goods sales will reach 2.9 trillion yuan (353 billion
U.S. dollars) this year, a year-on-year rise of nine percent.
</P>
<P>
When adjusted for inflation, this will be the same as or a
little higher than that for 1997.
</P>
<P>
Because of an oversupply of basic materials and other fallout
from international financial turmoil, the retail price index is
expected to drop by 2-2.5 percent on a year-on-year basis, and the
consumer price index to fall about 0.5 percentage points from last
year's level.
</P>
<P>
Factors affecting prices in the coming months include a stable
macro-economic situation, sufficient supplies of major commodities
and industrial goods, and a guaranteed grain supply.

<HEADLINE> Gasoline Consumption in Iran Up 5.9 Percent </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, November 15 (Xinhua) -- The average daily consumption
of gasoline in Iran increased by 5.6 percent during the first
seven months of the current Iranian calendar year (March 21, 1988
- March 20, 1999), a senior Iranian official announced Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a press conference, Iranian deputy oil minister for
refinement and distribution of oil products, Mohammad Aqa'ie, said
that the volume averaged 37.5 million liters each day, 5.6 percent
more than the same period last year.
</P>
<P>
He said that in the month of Mehr (ending October 22) the daily
volume reached 38.5 million liters, showing an increase of 7.9
percent from a year earlier, according to the official news agency
IRNA.
</P>
<P>
To meet the growing demand, the government imported a total of
900 million liters of gasoline during the seven months.
</P>
<P>
The official attributed the high consumption to fuel
inefficiency of automobiles, some due to aging and some because of
deficient design, and the relative low prices of oil products.
</P>
<P>
The gasoline price in Iran, 200 rials (about three cents) per
liter, is 20 percent of that on world markets; and kerosene and
gas oil are sold at only 5 percent of their worth on world
markets, he said.
</P>
<P>
Iran's domestic consumption of oil products currently equals
2.35 million barrels of oil per day (bpd), Aqa'ie said, adding
that the country will need some 3.43 million bpd to meet the
domestic demands by the end of the third economic development
plan in 2004.
</P>
<P>
Iran's crude output is currently around 3.6 million bpd and
some 2.4 million barrels are exported.
</P>
<P>
Experts and officials have repeatedly warned that there would
be no excessive crude oil for export if the current growth of
domestic consumption continues.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Aqa'ie said that the average daily output of oil
products during the seven months stood at 207.9 million liters,
up 10.1 percent from a year earlier.

<HEADLINE> Iran's State Revenue Fails to Reach Budgeted Level </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, November 15 (Xinhua) -- Iran shot short of its budgeted
revenue by a third in the first six months of the current Iranian
calendar year (March 21, 1998 - March 20, 1999) due to the oil
prices slump.
</P>
<P>
State revenue stood at 27,292 billion rials (about 15.95
billion U.S. dollars), about 67 percent of the target for the
period, a Persian-language daily Zan (women) reported on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, total expenditures during the six-month period
reached 28,934.4 billion rials (about 16.53 billion dollars), or
68.2 percent of the budget projection, down 3.6 percent from the
same period of last year.
</P>
<P>
If the current trend continues, Iran is expected to be 26,750
billion rials (about 15.29 billion dollars) shy of budgeted
revenue for the entire year, said the newspaper.
</P>
<P>
During the half-year period, oil and gas incomes stood at
8,653.8 billion rials (about 4.95 billion dollars), accounting for
60.7 percent of the budget projection, down 37 percent from that
of the same period last year.
</P>
<P>
In January, the Iranian Majlis, or the parliament, approved the
country's general budget at 231,000 billion rials (about 132
billion dollars) based on a 16-dollar-per-barrel oil price, out of
which 81,000 billion rials (about 46.3 billion dollars) for
government budget.
</P>
<P>
Oil experts here believed that Iran's oil revenue of this
Iranian calendar year would not exceed 10 billion dollars as world
oil market showed little sign of recovery.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Iran's State Revenue Fails to Reach Budgeted Level </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, November 15 (Xinhua) -- Iran shot short of its budgeted
revenue by a third in the first six months of the current Iranian
calendar year (March 21, 1998 - March 20, 1999) due to the oil
prices slump.
</P>
<P>
State revenue stood at 27,292 billion rials (about 15.95
billion U.S. dollars), about 67 percent of the target for the
period, a Persian-language daily Zan (women) reported on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, total expenditures during the six-month period
reached 28,934.4 billion rials (about 16.53 billion dollars), or
68.2 percent of the budget projection, down 3.6 percent from the
same period of last year.
</P>
<P>
If the current trend continues, Iran is expected to be 26,750
billion rials (about 15.29 billion dollars) shy of budgeted
revenue for the entire year, said the newspaper.
</P>
<P>
During the half-year period, oil and gas incomes stood at
8,653.8 billion rials (about 4.95 billion dollars), accounting for
60.7 percent of the budget projection, down 37 percent from that
of the same period last year.
</P>
<P>
In January, the Iranian Majlis, or the parliament, approved the
country's general budget at 231,000 billion rials (about 132
billion dollars) based on a 16-dollar-per-barrel oil price, out of
which 81,000 billion rials (about 46.3 billion dollars) for
government budget.
</P>
<P>
Oil experts here believed that Iran's oil revenue of this
Iranian calendar year would not exceed 10 billion dollars as world
oil market showed little sign of recovery.
</P>
<P>
Iranian government said earlier that it would make up the
income losses through advance sale of oil and borrowing from the
Central Bank of Iran.

<P>
JERUSALEM, November 15 (Xinhua) -- Israeli Prime Minister
Benjamin Netanyahu said Sunday Israel will "keep its eyes open" on
Iraq since Baghdad's pledged compliance with United Nations arms
inspections is doubtful.
</P>
<P>
Netanyahu made the remark in reaction to U.S. President Bill
Clinton's response to Iraq's offer that it will resume cooperation
with U.N. weapons inspectors without conditions.
</P>
<P>
Clinton said Baghdad has backed down from its previous
positions but it has to live up to its obligations undertaken in
agreements with the U.N..
</P>
<P>
Netanyahu added Israel "has no illusion" about the intention of
Iraqi President Saddam Hussein and therefore will keep on high
alert for the development in the region.
</P>
<P>
In a separate statement, Israeli Defense Minister Yitzhak
Mordechai said Israel hopes the resumption of U.N. weapons
inspection will prevent Iraq from developing weapons of mass
destruction, which Israel regards as a main threat from Iraq and
other nations hostile to the Jewish state.
</P>
<P>
Israel has reiterated in the last few days that it was not a
party to the conflict but will do everything possible to defend
its people against a possible Iraqi attack.

<HEADLINE> Arafat: Palestinian State Benefits Regional </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, November 15 (Xinhua) -- Palestinian leader Yasser
Arafat reiterated Sunday that a Palestinian state will reinforce
regional peace.
</P>
<P>
Explaining the purpose of establishing such a state, Arafat
stated that an independent Palestinian state could be the bridge
of love and peace and one of the pillars of stability in the
Middle East.
</P>
<P>
Arafat made the remarks when addressing a mass rally in the
West Bank city of Ramallah to mark the 10th anniversary of the
declaration of independence of Palestine.
</P>
<P>
Arafat said that for many years, through the Palestinian
National Authority (PNA) and under the leadership of the Palestine
Liberation Organization (PLO), the Palestinian people had been
striving hard to realize this goal -- the establishment of an
independent Palestinian state on the holy land.
</P>
<P>
He said he sent a letter to the Israelis Sunday, affirming to
them that the future Palestinian state will only work for peace,
economic development and stability and be a threshold for good
relations, understanding and love among the people living on this
holy land of the whole region.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Arafat once again asked all peace-loving countries
in the world to support the future Palestinian state, with
Jerusalem as its capital.
</P>
<P>
Arafat urged all palestinian factions, parties and social
forces to start an open national dialogue that could boost the
Palestinian unity and Palestinian positions in realizing the goal
of establishing an independent state.
</P>
<P>
But he also warned all Palestinian factions not to take
measures to sabotage implementation of signed peace agreements.
</P>
<P>
He said the "PNA will not allow anyone, through ignorance,
immaturity or collaboration, to provide the Israeli side with any
excuses to evade the commitments or to take measures that harm the
interests of the Palestinian people."
</P>
<P>
He also declared that the Palestinian people are committed to
one cause under one leadership and one authority, and everybody
must realize that the the PNA will not allow any blow to the
Palestinian dream or the destruction of the national project.
</P>
<P>
This was the clear message Arafat sent to the radical groups
such as Islamic Resistance Movement (Hamas) that they could not
conduct terrorist activities against the Israelis in the
implementation of signed peace accords.
</P>
<P>
The Palestinians hold that after the final status talks with
the Israelis, which should end before May 4, 1999 under the
Oslo Agreement between the two sides, an independent Palestinian
state should be established.

<HEADLINE> Israel Not Player in Iraqi-U.N. Crisis: Cabinet </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, November 15 (Xinhua) -- Unknowning how the
Iraqi-U.N. crisis will develop next, Israel reiterated Sunday
that it is not a party in the conflict, but it "will know how to
defend its people" against a possible Iraqi attack.
</P>
<P>
Israel reiterated the position at its inner cabinet meeting
Sunday, Israel Radio reported.
</P>
<P>
The inner cabinet comprises Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu
Defense Minister Yitzhak Mordechai, Foreign Minister Ariel Sharon
and Industry and Trade Minister Natan Sharansky.
</P>
<P>
At a special meeting held Friday on the Iraq crisis, the
mini-cabinet expressed similar position.
</P>
<P>
Iraq apparently backed down Saturday night from its October 31
decision by announcing that it will unconditionally resume
cooperation with U.N. Special Commission (UNSCOM), which oversees
Iraq's disarmament.
</P>
<P>
But Washington has rejected Iraq's offer, continuing its
military buildup in the Gulf and saying military strike remained
an option.
</P>
<P>
Israeli officials, however, expressed relief following Iraq's
decision to allow U.N. weapons inspectors to resume their work.
</P>
<P>
"Obviously, everyone wants a resolution without bloodshed,"
said David Bar-Illan, senior adviser of Netanyahu, Saturday night.
</P>
<P>
Iraq fired 39 Scud missiles armed with conventional warheads
at Israel during the 1991 Gulf War, killing one person and
wounding scores of others in the Tel Aviv area.
</P>
<P>
Israeli government has said since the beginning of the latest
crisis, resulting from Iraq's suspension of all its cooperation
with UNSCOM, that the chance of a retaliatory attack on Israel by
Iraq was close to zero, but the Israeli army has opened more than
60 gas mask distribution centers around the country as a
precautionary measure.
</P>
<P>
Although the Iraq crisis appears to have eased, Israeli
army reopened the gas mask distribution centers Sunday and said
it intends to keep them open around the clock for the next
week.

BAGHDAD, November 15 (Xinhua) -- The Return of U.N. relief
workers, who were evacuated to Amman, Jordan last week amid
the Iraq-U.N. standoff over arms inspections, has been postponed,
said U.N. official here Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Eric Falt, spokesman for the U.N. Office of Humanitarian

<P>
U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan on Saturday asked for the
return of humanitarian program monitors to Iraq so as to resume
their mandate.
</P>
<P>
Some 150 U.N. humanitarian staff pulled out from Iraq last
Wednesday and Thursday as "precautionary measure" to ensure their
safety as the U.S. threatened to launch military strikes against
Iraq to force it to resume cooperation with U.N. arms inspectors.
</P>
<P>
Iraqi Deputy Prime Minister Tariq Aziz on Saturday sent a
letter to U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan which promised that
Iraq would resume cooperation unconditionally with U.N. arms
inspectors, a move many observers believe that will possibly
ward off an imminent U.S. military strike.
</P>
<P>
Annan termed the Iraqi decision as "positive", saying that he
believed it met U.N. requirements in resolving the latest crisis.
</P>
<P>
However, U.S. National Security Adviser Sandy Berger said on
Saturday Iraq's offer to allow U.N. inspections to resume was
"unacceptable," and the U.S. remained poised for military action
against Iraq.
</P>
<P>
Iraqi offer was "neither unequivocal nor unconditional," said
Berger, referring to the two-page annex attached to the letter
to Annan.
</P>
<P>
In response, Iraqi envoy to the U.N. Nazar Hamdoun said in New
York Saturday the annex was not linked with the letter, and it was
just what Iraq hoped to see after it resumed cooperation with
U.N. weapons inspectors. He reiterated that the Iraqi decision
was unconditional.
</P>
<P>
Iraqi leadership On October 31 decided to halt all forms of
cooperation with the U.N. Special Commission for disarming Iraq
(UNSCOM) until the U.N. Security Council moves toward lifting the
U.N. trade sanctions imposed on it for about eight years.

the Gulf in preparation for an attack to force Iraq to
reverse course.

<HEADLINE> Israel Sees Record Rise in Consumer Price Index </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, November 15 (Xinhua) -- Israel's Consumer Price
Index (CPI), an important inflation indicator, rose by 3 percent
in October, the highest monthly growth in 13 years.
</P>
<P>
The expected high rate, announced by Israel Radio Sunday,
foils efforts of economic leaders to keep the annual inflation of
this year to a very low level.
</P>
<P>
Israeli government had set the inflation target for this year
between 7-10 percent. But since inflation rate for the first nine
months was only 4 percent, the central bank and the Finance
Ministry had had high hopes that the annual inflation for 1998
would be around 3 percent, the lowest rate since 1968.
</P>
<P>
With the CPI rising dramatically in October and being expected
to be high in November, the annual inflation rate is likely to end
at 9 to 11 percent, experts said.
</P>
<P>
Many experts and officials also described the government's
inflation target for 1999, which is set at 4 percent, as
unrealistic in light of the recent economic slowdown.
</P>
<P>
The October CPI reflected the price rises in the aftermath of a
wave of devaluations of the Israeli currency shekel during the
month. The currency devaluated by 10.5 percent to 4.25 shekels
against the dollar in October.
</P>
<P>
The sharp devaluation was triggered by the turmoil in the
international financial market and speculations in Israel's
foreign currency market.
</P>
<P>
The central Bank of Israel had to change its non-intervention
approach and raised the key interest rate twice.
</P>
<P>
The bank announced Thursday to raise the interest rate by a
further 2 percentage points to 13.5 percent, the second time in
less than two weeks.
</P>
<P>
The rate stood at 9.5 percent in August after several cuts
since the beginning of the year.
</P>
<P>
Bank of Israel Governor Jacob Frenkel has been criticized for
taking the "panic move" by raising the interest rate. Some say
that the high interest rate, which discourages loans and
consumption, would deepen the economic slowdown and worsen
unemployment, which stands at a record high of about 9.5 percent.
</P>
<P>
Frenkel was under fire in a cabinet meeting Sunday from a
number of ministers led by Industry and Trade Minister Natan
Sharansky, who said the 4 percent inflation target for 1999 was
"not suitable" and had to be changed.
</P>
<P>
But Frenkel insisted that inflation would be brought down by
the hike in the interest rate, saying the 4 percent inflation
target for 1999 "is an attainable level."

<HEADLINE> Greek Speaker Visits Cyprus </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, November 15 (Xinhua) -- Efforts should be made to
achieve the goal of Cyprus' accession to the European Union,
visiting Greek Parliament Speaker Apostolos Kaklamanis said here
Sunday.
</P>
<P>
"Succeeding this goal is of great strategic importance to the
solution of the Cyprus problem, so that Greek Cypriots and
Turkish Cypriots will be able to together build a better common
future in a free Cyprus without foreign occupation troops,"
Kaklamanis said upon his arrival for a two-day official visit to
Cyprus.
</P>
<P>
"The European community will then recognize that in the future
the Cyprus Republic will continue its course as a united
independent entity," he added.
</P>
<P>
During his visit, Kaklamanis is expected to hold talks with
his Cypriot counterpart Spyros Kyprianou on the Cyprus issue and
bilateral ties.
</P>
<P>
He will address an anti-occupation gathering held Monday to
protest against the Turkish Cypriots' declaration of the breakaway
state in 1983 in the northern part of the island.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus has remained divided since 1974 when Turkey landed its
troops and took over the northern third of the island in the wake
of a failed pro-Athens coup in Nicosia.
</P>
<P>
The Turkish Cypriots declared unilaterally on November 15,
1983 a breakaway "Turkish Republic," recognized only by Turkey.

<HEADLINE> Two Israeli Suspects Further Remanded in Cyprus </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, November 15 (Xinhua) -- Cyprus' Larnaca District
Court Sunday renewed a remand order for another five days for two
Israelis held on suspicion of espionage against the island's armed
forces.
</P>
<P>
Udi Hargov, 27 and Igal Damari, 49, were arrested on November 7
after a police staked out of their leased apartment in the
southern coastal village of Zygi which is close to a sensitive
military area.
</P>
<P>
They were remanded in custody for eight days pending
investigations.
</P>
<P>
Investigating police officer, Andreas Naoum, told the court
Sunday that after the suspects' arrival in Cyprus "there were
several phone calls by mobile phones to a telephone belonging to a
specific intelligence service, based in Tel Aviv."
</P>
<P>
He said two mobile phones were found in the two suspects'
apartment, one carrying a British card and another a Dutch card.
</P>
<P>
Naoum said preliminary investigations show the frequency
scanners found in the suspects' leased apartment are high-tech and
may interfere with the police and National Guard frequencies.
</P>
<P>
"They can also receive Fire-Brigade, Civil Aviation and other
essential services' messages," the police officer added.
</P>
<P>
Naoum said the two suspects were extensively interrogated but
they refused to cooperate with the police.
</P>
<P>
The Israeli Foreign Ministry said the two arrested men were not
spying on behalf of Turkey, and were not doing anything to harm
Cyprus.

<HEADLINE> Turkey Urges Italy to Extradite PKK Leader </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, November 15 (Xinhua) -- Turkish Deputy Prime Minister
Bulent Ecevit on Sunday urged Italy to extradite the captured
Kurdish rebel leader Abdullah Ocalan.
</P>
<P>
Ecevit warned European countries, especially Italy, that any
tolerance shown to the Kurdish Workers' Party (PKK), labeled by
Turkey as a terrorist group, will mean "opening their doors to
terrorism."
</P>
<P>
Ocalan was detained by Italian police Thursday night upon his
arrival in Rome aboard a Russian airlines passenger plane from
Moscow.
</P>
<P>
Many PKK supporters in European countries held demonstrations
and hunger strikes in protest against the arrest of the PKK
leader in Italy.
</P>
<P>
Turkey is now very concerned with negative signals coming from
Rome that PKK leader Ocalan will not be extradited and is in fact
being treated with sympathy by the Italian government.
</P>
<P>
The PKK led by Ocalan has been fighting a separatist war for in
southeastern Turkey since 1984. Over 37,000 people lost their
lives in the independent campaign.
</P>
<P>
It was reported that Franco Corleone, a state secretary of the
Italian Justice Ministry, said it is "out of the question" for
Ocalan to be handed over to Turkish authorities.
</P>
<P>
Before leaving here for Rome to attend a ministerial meeting of
the Western European Union (WEU), Turkish Foreign Minister Ismail
Cem criticized Corleone said he will "express his concerns" to his
Italian counterpart Lamberto Dini.
</P>
<P>
Cem said Turkey expects Italy to take a "serious and just"
approach to the possible extradition of Ocalan to Turkey.
</P>
<P>
Ocalan is expected to sign a formal request for political
asylum in Italy on Monday at the latest, Italian Interior
Minister Jervolino said in Rome on Saturday.

<HEADLINE> Egypt, Austria Discuss Iraqi Crisis, Mideast Peace </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, November 15 (Xinhua) -- Despite encouraging developments
in solving the Iraqi crisis, Egyptian and Austrian foreign
ministers said Sunday that Baghdad must comply with the United
Nations Security Council resolutions.
</P>
<P>
Egyptian Foreign Minister Amr Moussa and visiting Austrian
Foreign Minister Wolfgang Schuessel called for a prompt and
peaceful solution that will secure the implementation of the
U.N. resolutions and Iraq's cooperation with the arms inspectors.
</P>
<P>
Moussa and Schuessel were speaking to the press after a
meeting between Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak and the Austrian
foreign minister, whose country is holding EU's rotating
presidency.
</P>
<P>
Iraq decided Saturday to unconditionally resume cooperation
with the U.N. Special Commission, charged with eliminating the
country's weapons of mass destruction, averting a possible
military attack by the United States.
</P>
<P>
Moussa said Mubarak and Schuessel also discussed the latest
developments in the Palestinian-Israeli peace process following
their latest peace accord signed last month in Washington.
</P>
<P>
The peace accord calls on Israel to pull out from another 13
percent of the West Bank in exchange for tougher Palestinians
measures against anti-Israeli violence.
</P>
<P>
Terming the meeting as "very useful," Schuessel said Mubarak
briefed him on Egypt's views on the Wye Plantation agreement and
how Egypt and the European Union join hands in helping establish
peace in the Middle East.
</P>
<P>
The Austrian foreign minister arrived here Saturday for a
two-day visit within a regional tour, which has taken him to
Israel, the Palestinian self-rule areas, Syria and Lebanon.

<HEADLINE> Russia Announces Anti-Crisis Measures </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, November 15 (Xinhua) -- The Russian government and
Central Bank on Sunday released an official version of its
anti-crisis measures that call for stronger state control and
"controlled" printing of rubles.
</P>
<P>
The measures, came almost two months after Yevgeny Primakov
took over as prime minister, coincided with the expiration of a
90-day moratorium on Russia's foreign debts imposed by the
previous government.
</P>
<P>
Most of the steps outlined in the joint statement, entitled "On
Measures to Stabilize the Socioeconomic Situation in the Country,"
were reported by the Russian media and are already being
implemented.
</P>
<P>
According to the statement, administrative bans and all kinds
of restrictions can be used as means to bail the country out of
the crisis, but "such measures will not prevail," and state
regulation will rely on regulative laws and effective control,
Interfax reported.
</P>
<P>
The statement reiterated the government's main tasks in the
short run -- to ensure the functioning of life-support systems, to
reduce social tensions, to revamp state finances and the banking
system and to restore the flow of goods and market mechanisms in
the real sector of the economy.
</P>
<P>
It said that keeping inflation below 30 percent next year will
be crucial to keeping the Russian economy afloat.
</P>
<P>
Since August 17, when former prime minister Kiriyenko announced
an effective devaluation of the ruble and the moratorium, the
ruble has shed some 65 percent.
</P>
<P>
Observers say that the government and the country's troubled
commercial banks may not be able to resume payments as the
moratorium expired Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Many foreign creditors threatened to seize Russian assets
overseas as collateral.
</P>
<P>
Some of the country's larger banks now will be able to pay
their debts, but many others will face lawsuits and see their
foreign assets seized, Interfax said.
</P>
<P>
Russian banks will probably be able to pay off no more than 2
billion dollars of their 6 billion dollar debt on forward currency
contracts to foreign banks, it said.
</P>
<P>
The government also pledged to ensure full and regular payment
of salaries and pensions, but with the mounting wage and pension
arrears, it is not clear where it will find the money to do so.
</P>
<P>
Deputy Prime Minister Valentina Matviyenio said in mid-October
that the government owed 70.5 billion rubles (about 4.4 billion
U.S. dollars) to its citizens.
