<HEADLINE> SIB's Proposals to Safeguard Compensation Arrangements </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, October 15 (Xinhua) - The Securities and Investment
Board (SIB) today published a Consultative Paper on proposals to
change the Investors Compensation Scheme (ICS) 100 million pounds
(160 million US dollars) annual compensation limit.
</P>
<P>
This change will enable investors to receive compensation in
the event that claims exceed the current annual limit.
</P>
<P>
Andrew Winckler, the SIB's Chief Executive, said: "The current
proposals are being made as a precautionary measure in the
interests of investor protection."
</P>
<P>
The proposals seek to remove a risk that the current method of
applying the annual limit could exclude investors from
compensation otherwise due to them.
</P>
<P>
The proposals also aim to raise the amount of the limit from
100 million pounds to 200 million pounds (320 million US dollars).
</P>
<P>
The Investors Compensation Scheme limited is the management
company established to operate the Financial Services
(Compensation of Investors) Rules which are made by the SIB under
the Financial Services Act 1986.
</P>
<P>
The Scheme enables investors to claim compensation of up to
48,000 pounds (76,800 US dollars) for loss of money or investments
due to the negligence or fraud of failed UK investment companies.

<HEADLINE> US Retail Sales Continue to Increase in September </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, October 15 (Xinhua) -- U.S. Retail sales rose by
0.3 percent in September, the fourth consecutive increase, U.S.
Commerce Department reported today.
</P>
<P>
The department said that retail sales increased to a seasonally
adjusted 215.5 billion dollars last month following stronger gains
in June, July and August.
</P>
<P>
Receipts at U.S. department stores and other general
merchandisers fell by 0.6 percent, while sales dropped 0.7 percent
at clothing and accessory shops. Both were the sharpest declines
in five months.
</P>
<P>
Auto sales last month rose 0.6 percent, the fourth consecutive
advance but not nearly as strong as increases in the previous
three months. Furniture dealers also reported a 0.6 percent
increase in September, the sixth month without a decline.
</P>
<P>
The report didn't contradict analysts' belief that U.S.
economic growth is moderating. They say that the question is
whether the moderation is enough to persuade the U.S. Federal
Reserve to refrain from raising short-term interest rates to cool
growth and squelch any incipient inflation pressures.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: East Asia Economic Summit Successful </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, October 15 (Xinhua) -- After three days of heated
work and discussions, the World Economic Forum's Sixth East Asia
Economic Summit closed its doors in the Hong Kong Convention and
Exhibition Center (HKCEC) tonight, with a number of notable
results.
</P>
<P>
Leaving the HKCEC building, many of the 1,000 delegates from
over 50 countries described the meeting as successful and
beneficial not only to the economic growth in East Asia but also
to global economic growth.
</P>
<P>
China's economic development and prospects was one of the three
topics at the three-day meeting.
</P>
<P>
Addressing the plenary session of the summit, Chairman of
China's
State Economic and Trade Commission Wang Zhongyu noted that China
had made great progress in its economic development since 1979,
under the policy of reform and opening to the outside world
initiated by the late Chinese leader Deng Xiaoping.
</P>
<P>
Its annual growth rate of gross domestic product (GDP) reached
12.1 percent in the 1991-1996 period, he said, adding that its
economy will grow at an annual rate of 8 percent in the remaining
years of the current century, while the country's annual inflation
rate will be kept below 5 percent.
</P>
<P>
China could maintain a 7 percent growth rate in the first 10
years of
the next century, he said, predicting that "a more open and
prosperous
China will become an important participant in the world economy,
particularly in the East Asian economy, and a cooperation partner
to be
trusted."
</P>
<P>
Most of the participants shared the view that China had
embarked on a track of continuous, rapid and healthy economic
development and would become a more open and prosperous country
and play a more important role in global economic growth in the
coming century.
</P>
<P>
As to the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region of China,
many delegates including Philippine President Fidel Ramos said
everything has been good in the region since it returned to the
motherland on July 1. The fact that Hong Kong was chosen as the
summit's venue indicates that the world says OK to its situation
after its return, they noted.
</P>
<P>
The economic situation and prospects in the Southeast Asian
countries and the East Asian region as a whole was another topic
of the summit.
</P>
<P>
Ramos told the meeting that he expected the Southeast Asian
countries to resume its high growth after the recent currency
turmoil, noting that their economic fundamentals remain strong.
</P>
<P>
He stressed the need to "turn this financial crisis into a
possibility," although the next year or two will be difficult for
some
countries in the Southeast Asian region.
</P>
<P>
In his address, Prime Minister of Singapore Goh Chok Tong also
expressed his optimism about the Southeast Asian economies, saying
countries affected by the recent financial turbulence in the
region will be able to recover fairly quickly.
</P>
<P>
The recent financial turmoil represents only a temporary,
though painful, setback to the onward march of Southeast Asian
economies, he said, voicing his faith that while near-term growth
in East Asia will
likely slow down, the economies in the region will not stall
because of
good economic fundamentals.
</P>
<P>
"Growth in foreign direct investment in the region will
continue," he
said.
</P>
<P>
However, a number of influential bankers present at the meeting
pointed out that the recent financial crisis had not broken out
overnight, and instead it was an inescapable result of
accumulation of economic strains after years of high growth.
</P>
<P>
The crisis will bring about an adjustment policy to be
implemented for
at least a year, they said, predicting that the regional economy
will
return to the fast growth track in the second half of 1999 as a
result of
good economic fundamentals and a long tradition of high savings
rate.
</P>
<P>
The world will enter into the next millennium with the bulk of
East Asia seeing better and stronger growth, they said.
</P>
<P>
The third major topic for discussion was whether or not it is
necessary to build networks for growth among East Asia, West
Europe and North America in the coming years.
</P>
<P>
"The three regions together generate almost 80 percent of
global GNP
(gross national product) and some 70 percent of world trade. There
are
strong synergetic possibilities in their leading industries," the
Philippine president said.
</P>
<P>
But some speakers pointed out the need to do things step by
step, urging every country to both seek for a broad international
cooperation and stand on its own feet.
</P>
<P>
In his concluding remarks, Managing Director of the World
Economic Forum Claude Smadja emphasized that the Geneva-based
organization will make further efforts to stimulate the economic
growth in East Asia and other parts of the world.
</P>
<P>
He announced that the forum had decided to hold its 7th East
Asia Economic Summit in Singapore on October 19 next year, and had
planned an East Asia-Pacific Economic Summit in Australia in the
year 2000.

<HEADLINE> Three Scientists Share Nobel Chemistry Prize </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
STOCKHOLM, October 15 (Xinhua) -- The Royal Swedish Academy of
Sciences decided today to award the 1997 Nobel Chemistry Prize to
three scientists of different nationalities.
</P>
<P>
They are Professor Paul D. Boyer from the United States, Doctor
John E. Walker from Britain and Professor Jens C. Skou from
Denmark.
</P>
<P>
The Academy said: "The three laureates have performed
pioneering work on enzymes that participate in the conversion of
the 'high-energy' compound adenosine triphosphate (ATP)."
</P>
<P>
It said the first two scientists received half the prize "for
their work on how the enzyme ATP synthase catalyses the formation
of ATP." and Jens C. Skou received the other half of the prize
"for the discovery of the enzyme sodium, potassium-stimulated
adenosine triphosphatase."
</P>
<P>
This enzyme maintains the balance of sodium and potassium ions
in the living cell.
</P>
<P>
Both enzymes are bound to membranes in the cell and linked with
the transport of ions through these but for different reasons.
</P>
<P>
Born in the U.S. in 1918, Boyer is now a professor of chemistry
and biochemistry in California University. Walker, 56, is a
researcher at the Medical Research Council Laboratory of Molecular
Biology in Cambridge, Britain while Skou is a professor at the
Aarhus University of Denmark.
</P>
<P>
The chemistry prize is the last in the 1997 Nobel season. The
1997 Nobel prize winners will receive their awards on December 10,
the anniversary of Alfred Nobel's death in 1896.

<HEADLINE> McAleese Remains Favorite to Win Irish Presidency Race </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, October 15 (Xinhua) -- Mary McAleese remains the
favorite candidate to win the Irish presidential election due to
be held on October 30, according to an opinion poll showed on
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The survey of 1,000 Irish voters, conducted by the MRBI
research company, revealed that McAleese, the candidate of the
ruling Fianna Fail party, remained ahead of the other four
contenders by commanding a "first preference" vote of 32 percent
under the country's proportional representation system.
</P>
<P>
The main opposition Fine Gael party candidate Mary Banotti,
grand-niece of the country's founding father Michael Collins,
snatched a 24-percent support, according to press reports from
Dublin.
</P>
<P>
However, the poll also showed a slip in support for the Labour
Party's anti-nuclear campaigner Adi Roche, who received just 13
percent support in the poll, down from 22 percent two weeks ago.
</P>
<P>
Roche, who heads a charity to help children from the region
devastated by the 1986 Chernobyl nuclear disaster, saw her
favorable position losing after some of her former employees
accused her of a ruthless management style.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the only male candidate Derek Nally and well-known
singer Dana, whose real name is Rosemary Scallon, enjoyed a
seven-percent support respectively. The survey also indicated that
some 17 percent voters remained undecided.

<HEADLINE> Pak Approves New Package for Offshore Oil Exploration </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, October 15 (Xinhua) -- The Pakistani government
approved today a new incentive package to activate the petroleum
exploration in the country's offshore areas.
</P>
<P>
Proposed by the Ministry of Petroleum and Natural Resources,
the package includes low tax rate of 40 percent compared with the
existing tax capped at 50 percent under the concession system and
accelerated depreciation for capital facilities, according to
official sources.
</P>
<P>
Under the package, the government will not share any rise in
the exploration or development.
</P>
<P>
But it will capture the revenues through profit oil/profit gas
on a slicing scale after recovery of cost which has an upper limit
of 85 percent.
</P>
<P>
The package also includes payment or rentals, production bonus,
marine research fee as well as training obligations, the sources
said.
</P>
<P>
They said the package would be applicable for five years and
would come into force immediately after making necessary changes
in the relevant laws.
</P>
<P>
It is hoped that the new package will attract private
investment in petroleum exploration in the offshore area, where
no drilling activity has been undertaken for seven years.
</P>
<P>
The sources said that the volume of sediments in offshore
Pakistan is huge and the existing information indicates the
presence of numerous structures which could contain major oil and
gas reserves.
</P>
<P>
The proposed package will enable the petroleum industry to
re-evaluate the possibilities for offshore exploration, said the
sources, adding that a major oil and gas discovery in the offshore
area will have a significant impact on the economy.

<TEXT>
<P>
ROME, October 15 (Xinhua) -- A confidence vote for the revived
Prodi Government will be taken tomorrow, Italian Lower House
Speaker Luciano Violante announced today after Prodi made his
opening speech in the confidence debate.
</P>
<P>
Prime Minister Romano Prodi stressed the role of collective
bargaining in enacting both pension reforms and the key move to a
35-hour work week by the year 2001.
</P>
<P>
He emphasized that work-week reductions will be applied
variably in different regions, taking into account economic
discrepancies between the North and the South.
</P>
<P>
The confidence crisis erupted when the government presented the
1998 budget to the parliament, with the aim of helping Italy to
become one of the charter members to the European economic and
monetary union.
</P>
<P>
The Communist Refoundation party, holding the balance of power
in the lower house of parliament, complained that the budget had
too many deep cuts in social and welfare spending, and few
measures to stimulate employment. It vowed to back away from it.
</P>
<P>
As a comprise with the Communist Refoundation, the government
said yesterday that industrial workers will be shielded from cuts
in seniority pensions (those taken after 35 years' work regardless
of age).
</P>
<P>
The move put the Prodi government back into Parliament with a
newly compact majority.

<HEADLINE> Mugabe Sets Date for Final Land Acquisition for </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, October 15 (Xinhua) -- Zimbabwean president Robert
Mugabe today said the Zimbabwe government will finalise acquiring
land for the resettlement exercise next year, adding that people
should be offered land before the end of 1998.
</P>
<P>
Addressing the midlands provincial leadership, Mugabe said
commercial farmers who have more than one farm would have one of
their farms designated for resettlement purposes.
</P>
<P>
He added the Zimbabwe government would not go back to the
negotiating table with Britain to discuss about the land issue
since the U.K. had indicated during the Lancaster house talks
that it would compensate farmers whose farms would be acquired.
</P>
<P>
He reiterated that the government would never pay compensation
to farmers who would lose their land as this was the
responsibility of the British government which colonised
Zimbabwe.
</P>
<P>
Zimbabwe had sent a delegation to the U.K. stating its
position that if funds were not forthcoming the government would
acquire land without paying compensation.
</P>
<P>
National land acquisition committee chairman Joseph Msika said
five million hectares were targetted for acquisition.
</P>
<P>
He said the target was to identify underutilised and derelict
land, and farms owned by absentee landlords.
</P>
<P>
At least 62,000 people have been resettled since independence
but another 100,000 still wait for the land which the government
has been promising for the past 17 years.

<HEADLINE> UK's Lowest Jobless Figures for 17 Years </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, October 15 (Xinhua) - September's unemployment figures
in Britain showed a fall of 27,800 to 1,467,600, at an annual rate
of 5.2 percent.
</P>
<P>
It was the lowest figure for 17 years, according to official
figures released here today.
</P>
<P>
It also was the 19th consecutive monthly fall in the jobless
total although economists had been predicting a steeper drop.
</P>
<P>
Unemployment in Britain, as measured by the official
statistics, is running at under half the European average of
10.8 percent.
</P>
<P>
Britain compares favorable with the rest of Europe with an ILO
unemployment rate of under 7 percent.
</P>
<P>
More importantly, one economist said, while unemployment in
Britain is falling, it is still on an upward trend in Europe.
</P>
<P>
However, the release of the figures coincided with a report
from the Bank of England warning of the possibility of rapidly
rising wage costs in Britain.
</P>
<P>
Philip Shaw, analyst of Investec said: "The pace of decline in
the claimant count measure of unemployment has eased back somewhat
and earnings growth has remained steady.... "
</P>
<P>
"Nevertheless it is unlikely to ease the Bank of England's
concerns over the potentially inflationary implications of the
tightness of the labor market," he added.

<HEADLINE> Pak Govt Announces Safeguards to Counter Adverse </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, October 15 (Xinhua) -- The Pakistani government
today announced substantial safeguards to protect common men from
the adverse impact of rupee adjustment against the U.S. dollar.
</P>
<P>
The State Bank of Pakistan today adjusted the dollar-rupee
(buying) rate by 8.71 percent from 40.52 rupees to a dollar to
44.05 rupees.
</P>
<P>
Addressing a press conference, Finance Minister Sartaj Aziz
said that "realignment" of exchange rate will improve exports and
competitive position of local industry which is facing adverse
conditions in the international market.
</P>
<P>
He said the resultant increase in petroleum prices following
the exchange rate adjustment is not being passed onto items like
kerosene, high speed diesel, light diesel oil and furnace oil.
</P>
<P>
"As a result there should be no increase in bus fare, transport
charges or tractor hire charges," he said, adding that similarly
stable prices of furnace oil will ensure more stable electricity
prices.
</P>
<P>
However the prices of motor spirit, super and high octane have
recorded increases ranging from 50 to 61 paisas per liter.
</P>
<P>
There will be no increase in the release price of wheat, even
though the price of imported wheat goes up, said Aziz.
</P>
<P>
The minister also brushed aside any increase in the budgeted
cost of debt servicing, saying "We are now borrowing from the
local market at the lower rate and partly due to more revenues
from enhanced customs duties."
</P>
<P>
To subside the impact of adjustment on the agricultural sector,
the minister announced that there will be no upward revision in
the prices of fertilizers.
</P>
<P>
In overall terms, the exchange rate adjustment will have
positive impact on the agricultural sector. Cotton growers will
receive higher prices for cotton in rupees, sugar surplus will
become exportable at more competitive prices and rice exports will
be stimulated, he added.
</P>
<P>
However, the most important impact of realignment of exchange
rate will be on manufactured exports, particularly high value
textile and non-traditional exports, said Aziz.
</P>
<P>
He said the exchange rate adjustment is necessitated by
external or internal factors and in case of Pakistan both have
been unfavorable.
</P>
<P>
Explaining the external factor, he said the Pakistani currency
is linked to the U.S. dollar and the dollar has gained
considerable strength in terms of other currencies.
</P>
<P>
He termed the currency upheaval in Southeast Asia since July as
another external factor of some urgency for making adjustment in
rupee value.
</P>
<P>
As a result of the currency crisis in Southeast Asia, the Thai
baht has been devalued by 30 percent against the U.S. dollar and
the Malaysian ringgit and the Indonesia rupiah by 17 percent.
</P>
<P>
The minister observed that since many of Pakistan's exports
like textile and rice compete with these countries, "our
competitive advantage had been further eroded."
</P>
<P>
"Because of these two external factors, the need for an
exchange rate adjustment was in any case necessary but its
compulsion was further accentuated by internal factor - inflation,
a rate of inflation that is higher than that in our main trading
partners," he added.
</P>
<P>
In the nine month period from October 1996 to June 1997, he
said, the rate of inflation in Pakistan was 8.35 percent, while
the annual rate of inflation now stands at 11.2 percent.
</P>
<P>
He noted that inflation rates of Pakistan's major trading
partners like South Korea, Japan, the U.S., Germany and China are
much lower. That is also the major reason for today's exchange
rate readjustment.
</P>
<P>
To a question about the impact of rupee adjustment on the
defense budget, Aziz said, "It will have no impact on it as the
adjustment is less than the cushion available in the budget".

<HEADLINE> Southeast European Parliament Summit Opens in Athens </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ATHENS, October 15 (Xinhua) -- A two-day meeting of the
presidents of Parliament from the countries of southeastern Europe
opened here today with the aim of exploring possibilities for
further cooperation between the legislatures in the region.
</P>
<P>
The first top-level meeting of the parliaments of the region is
being attended by the Parliament Presidents of Albania, Bosnia,
Bulgaria, Yugoslavia, the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia
(FYROM), Romania, Croatia and Slovenia, with observers from the
parliamentary assemblies of international organizations.
</P>
<P>
Addressing the meeting, Greek Parliament President Apostolos
Kaklamanis said that cooperation should be strengthened on a more
permanent basis within the framework of a "parliamentary advisory
assembly," the first aim of which would be to organize meetings of
house presidents on a regular, rotating basis along the lines of
similar meetings in the European Union (EU).
</P>
<P>
Yugoslav Parliament Speaker Milomir Milic proposed Belgrade as
the venue for the first meeting of the parliamentary advisory
assembly of the southeastern countries in Europe in June next
year.
</P>
<P>
Romanian Parliament President Petre Roman hoped that the image
of southeastern Europe could be enhanced through greater contact
between the parliaments of the region.
</P>
<P>
Moldovan Parliament President Timitru Motpan stressed that
weight should be placed on efforts to combat arms smuggling and
narcotics trafficking, while specific initiatives should be
undertaken against terrorism and national isolationism.
</P>
<P>
He added that cooperation should also be advanced on ecological
matters and the protection of the environment.

<HEADLINE> Zambian Government Accused of Ill-Treating Kaunda </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, October 15 (Xinhua) -- The United National
Independence Party (UNIP), Zambia's main opposition party, today
accused the government of ill-treating former President Kenneth
Kaunda and threatened to take the government to court.
</P>
<P>
At a regular news briefing held here at the UNIP headquarters
in the capital, Bwendo Mwengela, publicity and information
secretary, told reporters that as early as in March 1994, the
government has decided to give Kaunda a choice "to allow
government either to build him a house or buy a house for him"
and provide him with three vehicles, three drivers as well as
several servants and a secretary.
</P>
<P>
However, the government refused to pay a total of 500,000 U.S
Dollars' rent arrears that Kaunda owes his landlord and failed to
provide vehicles, according to Mwengela.
</P>
<P>
He threatened to take the Multi-Party Movement for Democracy
(MMD) government to court because of its "lukewarm attitude"
towards the housing and transport of Kaunda, president of UNIP
and the first president who led the country to independence from
Britain in 1964 and ruled Zambia until 1991 when MMD came into
power.
</P>
<P>
"The party and Kaunda is now left with no choice but to take
the MMD government to court," said Mwengela in a front-page story
in Times of Zambia published today.
</P>
<P>
The paper said the government will not pay rent arrears for
the house Kaunda rents from a businessman since the act provides
for provision of a house by way of buying or building one instead
of paying house rent for a former president.
</P>
<P>
It quoted Richard Sakala, President Frederick Chiluba's press
aide as saying that there is no such a provision in Kaunda's
retirement benefits act and the government is not responsible
for paying the rent.
</P>
<P>
The dispute between UNIP and the government over housing of
Kaunda came up recently after the former president's landlord
threatened to evict him from his house if the rent which has
accrued from July 1993 is not paid.

<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, October 15 (Xinhua) -- South African president
Nelson Mandela today ruled out mediating in the civil war in the
Republic of Congo.
</P>
<P>
Asked by reporters in Cape Town whether South Africa would be
willing to help in resolving the conflict, Mandela said there
were existing structures to address those issues.
</P>
<P>
Both parties involved in the conflict in Congo had wanted to
visit South Africa about two months ago to consult Mandela, but
he had refused and referred them to Zimbabwean president Robert
Mugabe, who is chairman of the Organisation of African Unity
(OAU).
</P>
<P>
"He is the man they should put their problems to," said
Mandela.
</P>
<P>
"I did not think it would be correct--so soon after i'd been
involved in what is now the Democratic Republic of Congo--to be
involved in a neighbouring country,"he added.
</P>
<P>
According to reports reaching here earlier today, forces
backing Congo's former military strongman, Denis Sassou Nguesso,
had seized control of the centre of the main oil town and port,
Pointe-Noire.
</P>
<P>
A spokesman for Nguesso's democratic and popular forces,
speaking from the Gabonese capital Libreville, said the
movement's troops had captured Pointe-Noire's airport, and
resistance by forces loyal to president Lissouba was expected to
end towards midday.

ensure welfare of neglected children and that they gain their
self respect."
</P>
<P>
"Once this center is complete, we hope to be able to offer not
only food, clothing and shelter, but also to put the children
through school, afford them some skills training and make sure
they are adequately prepared to fend for themselves in dignified
ways," she added.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Kohl's Party Adopts 1998 Election Platform </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LEIPZIG, October 15 (Xinhua) -- Under the mottos of "jobs for
all", and "zero tolerance to crime", German Chancellor Helmut
Kohl's Christian Democratic Union (CDU) today set out a party
agenda with which it will start the campaign for general elections
scheduled for September next year.
</P>
<P>
Under a party platform adopted before the end of its three-day
congress in the eastern German city of Leipzig, the CDU called for
liberalization and structural reforms in the German economy in
order to cure the country's main malaise at present -- a
record-high jobless total of about 4.5 million.
</P>
<P>
More part-time jobs, flexible working hours, more temporary
jobs and modest wage increases were among the main remedies
proposed by the CDU.
</P>
<P>
A cut of work week to 32 hours, as suggested by the main
opposition Social Democratic Party (SPD) and trade unions, has
been firmly rejected by Kohl's party.
</P>
<P>
Describing anti-crime battle as another top policy priority,
the CDU pledged tougher measures to crack down on the country's
increasing offenses.
</P>
<P>
"With 6.7 million criminal offenses, over two million criminal
suspects and a crime clear-up rate of only 49 percent in 1996, the
interior security of Germany is under threat everyday," the CDU
anti-crime paper said.
</P>
<P>
The CDU today also pledged reforms to improve the country's
education system. On the European issues, it vowed to hold on to
the target of a punctual start of the single European currency and
called for stronger coordination in Europe to combat organized
crime.
</P>
<P>
Besides adopting the party agenda, the three-day CDU congress
also confirmed Kohl as its chancellor candidate for the next
general elections scheduled on September 27, 1998.

<HEADLINE> Angolan Peace Process Comes to An End, Official </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUANDA, October 15 (Xinhua) -- Joao Lourenco, senior official
of the People's Movement for the Liberation of Angola, said here
today that the Angolan Peace Process has now nearly come to an
end, with peace almost becoming a reality.
</P>
<P>
Lourenco made the statement in a speech at the National
Assembly.
</P>
<P>
According to him, although the peace process is slow in its
progress, it nearly comes to an end. The Angolan people have
enjoyed rights to peace, which is a fact irreversible to
politicians' wishes.
</P>
<P>
Lourenco believed that the two signatories of the Lusaka Peace
Accord have participated in the peace process and made their
contributions to peace, although the National Union for the Total
Independence of Angola (UNITA) got engaged in the process under
pressures from the international community.
</P>
<P>
The No. 1127 resolution passed recently by the United Nations
Security Council rules that it will impose sanctions on UNITA if
the former rebel movement fails to accomplish the tasks
stipulated in the peace agreement within the prescribed deadline.
</P>
<P>
It's only 15 days before the UN deadline, but there are still
certain tasks unfinished by UNITA, said Lourenco, who urged UNITA
leaders to make efforts for the realization of final peace.
</P>
<P>
Referring to the drafting of new constitution for Angola,
Lourenco noted, a modern constitution should reflect the
historical, political and economic situations in the country so
as to adapt to challenges facing the 21st century.

MOSCOW, October 15 (Xinhua) -- The Russian State Duma decided
today to postpone the vote of no-confidence in the Russian
government until next Wednesday, according to the Itar-Tass news
agency.
</P>
<P>
The State Duma made the decision following an appeal of the
president Boris Yeltsin to drop the no-confidence vote.
</P>
<P>
During today's debates on the vote at the plenary session of
the State Duma Speaker of the Duma Gennady Seleznyov contacted
twice through telephone with the president.
</P>
<P>
According to Seleznyov, Yeltsin called on the deputies not to
carry the issue through to the resignation of the government
today. The president said "I don't want confrontation, I don't
want new early elections."
</P>
<P>
Yeltsin also showed readiness to start the work of a 'round
table' with the participation of political parties and movements
on the most important issues.
</P>
<P>
The proposal to postpone the voting was put forward by Russian
Communists' leader Gennady Zyuganov and backed by the Agrarian and
Power To People factions in the lower house of the State Duma.
</P>
<P>
The decisive backing came from leader of the ultranationalist
Liberal Democratic Party of Russia (LDPR) Vladimir zhirinovsky who
is firmly in command of 51 voted of his faction, the report said.
</P>
<P>
Leaders of both pro-governmental Our Home Is Russia faction and
liberal Yabloko Alexander Shokhin and Grigory Yavlinsky insisted
on voting the no-confidence motion today, but slight majority of
deputies, 228 deputies, voted for the postponement of the
non-confidence vote.
</P>
<P>
Russian Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin today also urged the
State Duma to drop its no-confidence vote, saying that "We need to
work on the main documents today. I accept any criticism."
</P>
<P>
According to the premier, the last week of "tough talk" between
the government and the Duma, the federal budget lost over 500
million US dollars and oil and gas companies even more.
</P>
<P>
Chernomyrdin admitted that the draft tax code really needs
correction, and agreed that the number of taxes should be reduced.
He said the president hopes that common sense and responsibility
will prevail in the Duma, adding the executive branch is open to
cooperation with legislators.

<HEADLINE> Russian FM to Visit Egypt on Peace Mission </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, October 15 (Xinhua) -- Russian Foreign Minister Yevgeny
Primakov will start his three-day visit to Egypt on October 29 as
part of his six-leg Mideast tour to push forward the peace
process, Russian Ambassador to Egypt Vladimir Gudev said today.
</P>
<P>
The visit was agreed upon during the talks between Egyptian
President Hosni Mubarak and his Russian counterpart Boris Yeltsin
in Moscow in September, he said, quoted by the Middle East News
Agency.
</P>
<P>
Egypt will be the last leg of the Russian foreign minister's
trip in the region which will take him to Lebanon, Syria, Israel,
Jordan and the Palestinian self-rule areas starting from October
24.
</P>
<P>
Primakov is expected to carry with him fresh ideas on
activating the deadlocked Middle East peace process, Gudev added.
</P>
<P>
Russia has mainly been absent from the Middle East arena over
the past few years, leaving the United States as the sole broker
whose role was often criticized by many Arabs as leaning toward
Israel.
</P>
<P>
It was Mubarak who in his recent visit to Moscow asked Yeltsin
to revive Russia's role as one of the co-sponsors of the peace
process.
</P>
<P>
As to whether Russia will attend the mid-November Arab-Israeli
economic conference in Doha, Qatar, Gudev said that Moscow has
received an invitation in the capacity as one of the co-sponsors
of the peace march that started in 1991.
</P>
<P>
The ambassador said he believes there are no obstacles
hindering Russia's participation in the conference with the aim of
improving Arab-Israeli ties.
</P>
<P>
"Strenuous efforts should be exerted to allow both sides to
reach tangible results regarding the peace process," he added.
</P>
<P>
This process came to a halt since Israel began construction of
a Jewish settlement in Arab East Jerusalem in March. The Doha
conference, controversially symbolic of an Arab-Israeli rapport,
has been opposed by a number of Arab countries.

<HEADLINE> Swaziland's Strike Enters Third Day </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, October 15 (Xinhua) -- A strike of more than
40,000 wokers in Swaziland entered its third day today, with no
solution in sight, reports reaching here from Mbabane said.
</P>
<P>
The industrial action, which began on Monday, is over a wide
range demands,including wage rises and constitutional changes in
the kingdom.
</P>
<P>
Local media reported on Tuesday that the strike's
organiser,the Swaziland Federation of Trade Unions, might call
off the action in view of growing signs that workers were
ambivalent about the strike.
</P>
<P>
Swaziland's major foreign exchange earner,sugar,is among the
worst affected sectors of the economy by the current labour
dispute.
</P>
<P>
The sugar industry was paralysed in February when employees
laid down thier tools over improved working conditions.
</P>
<P>
Swaziland is the only country in southern Africa which has not
introduced political reforms.
</P>
<P>
But memebers of a constitutional review commission are visiting the
kingdom to get people's views on whether they want a new system or
remain under a traditional monarchy.

<HEADLINE> GCC Joint Naval Exercises End </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ABU DHABI, October 15 (Xinhua) -- The Gulf Cooperation
Council (GCC) states ended today their annual joint naval
maneuvers which began on October 4, the Bahraini news agency
monitored here reported.
</P>
<P>
The 11-day exercises, codenamed "Solidarity-5", were aimed at
strengthening military cooperation among the GCC members, which
include Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, Kuwait, Bahrain,
Qatar and Oman, GCC military officials said.
</P>
<P>
The maneuvers which took place off the coast of Bahrain came
days after Iran bombed two Iranian rebel bases inside southern
Iraq, causing tensions in the Gulf region.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. has accused Iran of violating the "no-fly zone" over
southern Iraq and warned against further violations. The
U.S. aircraft carrier Nimitz, which arrived in the Gulf Sunday
and armed with 75 warplanes and six other warships, has been
deployed in northern Gulf waters.
</P>
<P>
The U.S., Britain and France imposed a "no-fly" ban in
southern Iraq after the Gulf War in 1991.
</P>
<P>
A day before the arrival of the Nimitz, the Iranian navy also
launched military exercises along its coasts. More than 50
warships, including two Russia-made submarines, and scores of
planes and helicopters took part in the 10-day war games, which
covered 24,000 square kilometers.
</P>
<P>
Iran strongly opposes the U.S. military presense in the Gulf
region, where some 20,000 U.S. troops and 29 warships are
deployed.

<HEADLINE> Angola Can't Meet Demand for Food: Minister </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUANDA, October 15 (Xinhua) -- Angolan Minister of Agriculture
Carlos Fernandes said today that despite its great potentials in
agriculture, fishery and mineral industries, Angola is still
incapable of meeting the people's needs for food at present.
</P>
<P>
He made the remarks here at a press conference to mark
tomorrow's World Food Day.
</P>
<P>
According to him, statistics from the United Nations Food and
Agriculture Organization show that 45 percent of Angolans are
mal-nutritioned, and the per capita consumption of food is merely
1,740 calorie, which fail to reach the health standard.
</P>
<P>
The minister attributed the situation to two-decade long
civil war, which brought about severe social and economic
damages.
</P>
<P>
Under the circumstances, Angola should take up incentive
measures to promote public and private investments and personnel
training, so as to achieve sustainable development in
agriculture, forestry and the whole rural areas to meet people's
needs for food.
</P>
<P>
Fernandes also announced October 15 will be observed as Rural
Women's Day in Angola to encourage women, who have been a vital
force for the country's agriculture, to make further contributions
to the country.

<HEADLINE> Israeli FM to Visit Jordan to Remedy Ties </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, October 15 (Xinhua) -- Israeli Foreign Minister
David Levy is to visit Jordan next month as part of Israeli
government's damage-control efforts to remedy the strained ties
with Amman.
</P>
<P>
Israeli Radio reported today that Levy's visit was announced
after Amman expressed satisfaction with the recent actions taken
by Israel to restore friendly relationship with Jordan damaged
by the failed attempt of Israeli secret service Mossad to
assassinate a Hamas leader Khaled Mashaal last month.
</P>
<P>
Jordanian Ambassador to Israel Omar Rafai met with Israeli
Foreign Ministry's Director-General Eitan Ben-Tsur Tuesday to
discuss ways to get the bilateral ties back on track.
</P>
<P>
Jordan was reported to be pleased with Levy for his
handling of the Mashaal affair. This was evident in Rafai's
statement that Jordan wanted to work closely with Israeli
Foreign Ministry to advance the peace.
</P>
<P>
Jordan was angered by the Mossad operation in its capital,
denouncing Israel for infringing of its sovereignty and
territorial integrity. Under the Jordanian presure, Israel was
forced to release jailed Hamas founder Sheikh Ahmed Yassin early
October, who returned to his home in Gaza, and 70 other
Jordanian and Palestinian prisoners.
</P>
<P>
Israel is especially concerned about the suspension of security
cooperation with Jordan, which provided crucial intelligence
information on some of Israel's Arab enemies. Jordan has demanded
Israeli embassy in Amman to reduce the number of security
personnels following the Mashaal affair.
</P>
<P>
To allay Jordanian anger over the lack of economic benefits
from the 1994 peace treaty, Israeli government has ordered the
acceleration of negotiations on constructing a joint international
airport in Jordan's Red Sea resort city Aqaba in order to
promote tourism.

<HEADLINE> Palestinians Accuse Israel of Stalling in Talks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, October 15 (Xinhua) -- Palestinian permanent
representative to the Arab League (AL) said today Israel has been
stalling in its current talks with the Palestinian side, the
Middle East News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
Mohamed Sobeih today delivered a message from Palestinian
leader Yasser Arafat to AL's Secretary General Esmat Abdel Meguid
on the latest developments in the Mideast peace process and the
ongoing Palestinian-Israeli negotiations as well as other Arab
issues.
</P>
<P>
"The Israeli side so far made no positive step and only speaks
about issues that have nothing to do with the essence of the peace
process," Sobeih complained following his meeting with Abdel
Meguid.
</P>
<P>
Israeli intransigent practices do not contribute to pushing
forward the peace process, he said, adding that the aim of
stalling is to serve the Israeli government.
</P>
<P>
Eight Palestinian-Israeli committees resumed talks two weeks
ago on implementing interim agreements under which Israel should,
among other things, release Palestinian prisoners and permit the
operation of an airport and a sea port.
</P>
<P>
The Palestinian diplomat also voiced dissatisfaction with the
U.S. mediation role, which he said fell short of taking a resolute
stance upon Israel's non-compliance with its peace commitments.
</P>
<P>
"The credibility of the U.S. as a co-sponsor of the peace
process is at stake," he said. "The U.S. ought to bring pressure
to bear on Israel to abide by the agreements signed."
</P>
<P>
He said the U.S. had reaffirmed the land for peace principle,
implementation of U.N. Security Council resolutions 242 and 338
and rejection of unilateral actions and this is why the Arab
countries and Palestinian leadership support the recent American
mediation.
</P>
<P>
He stressed the importance of coordination and efforts of the
Arab countries especially inside the U.N. and its Security Council
to restore the Palestinian rights.
</P>
<P>
U.S. Mideast Coordinator Dennis Ross will return to the region
this week to follow up the low-level Palestinian-Israeli talks.
Israeli Foreign Minister David Levy and Arafat's deputy Mahmoud
Abbas are scheduled to meet in Washington by the end of this month
to discuss broader issues such as settlements and troop
withdrawal.

<HEADLINE> Kuwait to Expand Petrochemical Industry </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUWAIT CITY, October 15 (Xinhua) -- Kuwait would expand and
upgrade existing domestic refineries and build new plants to
promote petrochemicals industry, according a Kuwaiti
petrochemicals industries official here today.
</P>
<P>
Deputy chairman of Kuwait state-owned Petrochemicals Industries
Company (PIC) Abdel Latif Al-Hadad told a press conference that
the Kuwait Petroleum Corporation (KPC) has put forward a 10-point
ambitious strategy to promote the oil refining industry.
</P>
<P>
He added the strategy involves several projects, including the
founding of a aromatics factory which will cost between 1.5
billion and 1.7 billion U.S. dollars, along with other projects.
</P>
<P>
He also said a two-billion-dollar Equate petrochemical project
which is a joint venture between PIC and Union Carbide Corp. of
the United States would be inaugurated on November 12 and reach
design capacity of 1.45 million tonnes of petrochemicals within
weeks.
</P>
<P>
Kuwait achieved crude refining capacity of 890,000 barrel per
day in February this year following a program to repair and
upgrade Kuwait's three refineries that were damaged during the
1990-1991 Iraqi occupation.
</P>
<P>
It is now planning to boost domestic refining to 1 million
barrels per day from the figure under a current four-year plan.
</P>
<P>
KPC reported record profits in 1996-97 fiscal year (July 1 to
June 30) of 4.5 billion dollars, the highest figure since the
corporation was founded in 1980, according to a statement issued
by the corporation in September.
</P>
<P>
The corporation is now also improving the export facilities at
the refineries.

<HEADLINE> ECOMOG Bombards Freetown Telecom Installations </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, October 15 (Xinhua) -- Fighting renewed today between
the west African peacekeeping force (ECOMOG) and the military
junta of Sierra Leone with ECOMOG jet dropping bombs at
telecommunications installations in Freetown, capital of S.Leone.
</P>
<P>
According to the British Broadcasting Corporation, a bomb hit
the installations operating on a hill overlooking the city and
appeared to affect at least the international phone line between
Freetown and Abidjan of Cote d'Voire.
</P>
<P>
Some houses in the surrounding area were also damaged. But no
casualty was reported.
</P>
<P>
Witnesses said that the bombing is one of a series of
fightings between the two sides since last weekend.
</P>
<P>
Last week, ECOMOG bombarded a helicopter gunship and the
military headquarters of the junta, which followed attacks by
the junta on an ECOMOG base in the suburb town of Jui.
</P>
<P>
Fighting was also reported in southeastern Sierra Leone,
especially around Bo, the second largest city of the country.
</P>
<P>
Today's bombing might be a follow-up of fighting in Jui, where
Freetown residents reportedly said heavy gunfire could be heard
through last evening till this morning.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the state radio was quoted as saying that over 117
Nigerian soldiers had been taken prisoners by this morning.
</P>
<P>
The junta earlier claimed it had captured some 400 Nigerian
soldiers and taken the ECOMOG position in Jui, which was denied
by the multinational peacekeeping force led by Nigeria.
</P>
<P>
ECOMOG, in a statement today, also denied that it acquired
poisonous gas to counter the aggression of the junta's forces as
aired on the state radio in Freetown on Friday.
</P>
<P>
Describing the allegation as the junta's plot to justify
aggression of ECOMOG, the statement said, "ECOMOG strongly
believes that the junta has acquired poisonous gas which it
probably hope to unleash on the peacekeepers and the thousands of
civilians taking refuge with them in their various locations."
</P>
<P>
"It did so in th case of landmines when it accused ECOMOG but
later began a massive use of the prohibited weapon which
eventually killed several ECOMOG soldiers," the statement added.
</P>
<P>
ECOMOG also accused the junta of holding citizens of other
west African countries in Freetown hostage and using them as
human shield.
</P>
<P>
The fresh exchanges of fire followed a United Nations Security
Council sanctions on Sierra Leone announced last Wednesday aimed
at reinstating the legitimate government led by President Ahmed
Tejan Kabbah which was ousted in the coup last May.

<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, October 15 (Xinhua) -- The Ankara Security Court today
sentenced a former mayor to four years and seven months in prison
for supporting extremist organizations.
</P>
<P>
The court found Bekir Yildiz, former mayor of an Ankara suburb,
guilty for "aiding armed gangs and provoking hatred and animosity
among people," the Anatolia News Agency said.
</P>
<P>
Yildiz, a member of the Islamic Welfare Party, was arrested
for organizing a commemoration of "Al-Quds (Jerusalem) Night" on
February 1 and calling for a state system based on Shariah
(Islamic Law).
</P>
<P>
Then TV reports showing the rally hall was decorated with
pictures of leaders of the radical Islamic groups Hamas and
Hezbollah touched off strong protests from secularists and caused
him his post three days later.
</P>
<P>
The Constitution and laws of Turkey, a predominantly Muslim but
politically secular country, ban anyone from calling for the
implementation of Islamic law.
</P>
<P>
Yildiz also invited then Iranian Ambassador Muhammed Reza
Bagheri to the rally, where the Iranian envoy made a controversial
speech leading to a bitter diplomatic row between the two
countries.
</P>
<P>
Turkey's powerful military, which favors secular rule, has
helped bring the downfall of the previous pro-Islamic
government. Now the pro-secular government under Mesut Yilmaz
government is working hard to arrest the rapidly growing
fundamentalist tendency in the country.

<HEADLINE> Minnesota Welfare Reform Law Sued </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, October 15 (Xinhua) -- Five families, a single man
and a community organization are challenging the constitutionality
of the welfare reform law of Minnesota in the United States.
</P>
<P>
The suit filed in Minneapolis circuit court Wednesday says it
is unconstitutional for the state to deny new residents the same
stipend provided longer-term residents. The reduced grant levels
were designed to keep welfare recipients from moving into the
state.
</P>
<P>
Mid-Minnesota Legal Assistance spokesman Tim Thompson says the
law discriminates against newcomers, United Press International
reported.
</P>
<P>
The law provides that families and individuals applying for Aid
to Families with Dependent Children (AFDC) less than 12 months
after moving to Minnesota will receive grants equal only to the
amount paid by the state in which they previously had lived.
</P>
<P>
The standard AFDC grant in Minnesota for a mother and two
children is 532 dollars per month. Thompson said if a family comes
from a state with no AFDC program, that family would receive no
money from Minnesota for a year under the law.
</P>
<P>
The law is similar to one passed in 1991 that applied to the
General Assistance program, which subsequently was struck down.
The Minnesota Supreme Court ruled that the law violated newcomers'
constitutional "right to travel."

<HEADLINE> US Sending Team to Congo for Alleged Massacre Probe </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, October 15 (Xinhua) -- The United States is sending
a three-person team to the Democratic Republic of Congo in an
attempt to give a push to a stalled U.N. probe into alleged
massacres of Rwandan refugees there, the State Department said
today.
</P>
<P>
"The mission is intended to bridge the differences between the
United Nations and the government of Congo so a human rights team
of the U.N. can conduct a full investigation," State Department
spokesman James Rubin told reporters. "We're trying to see what we
can do to break the impasse."
</P>
<P>
The team includes Bill Richardson, the U.S. ambassador to the
United Nations, Representative Donald Payne and former
Representative Howard Wolpe. Rubin said they were picked for the
team because of "their availability, their familiarity with the
situation and all three met and know (Congo's President Laurent)
Kabila."
</P>
<P>
Rubin repeated previous warnings that if Kabila's Congolese
government failed in cooperation with the probe, the United States
would oppose its acceptance into the "community of nations" and
its access to international financial institutions, and he also
indicated Washington might thus consider supporting the imposition
of sanctions on Congo.

<HEADLINE> Netherlands Gives Tanzania $7m Tech-Aid </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, October 15 (Xinhua) -- The Netherlands has
committed 45.6 billion shillings (about 7.4 million US Dollars)
in financial and technical support for Tanzania in the next five
years, said a statement from the Royal Netherlands Embassy.
</P>
<P>
The support will go into development programs in five
districts in Kagera Region, four in Shinyanga and one in Arusha,
Daily News reported today.
</P>
<P>
Some 17 billion shillings more have been embarked for various
projects, including women, children and environmental
development, this year.
</P>
<P>
The statement, issued in the wake of a three-day working visit
by the Dutch Premier, Wim Kok, further said that an additional
7.5 billion shillings grant would be disbursed to Tanzania for
mixed credit financing.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the Dutch premier Tuesday reassured Tanzania of his
country's support in social and economic development, calling for
further bilateral ties between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
Kok told a press conference in Dar es Salaam that the
Netherlands will strengthen the macro-economic assistance
effective next year.
</P>
<P>
Tanzania is the largest recipient of Dutch aid in Africa and
the third in the world.
</P>
<P>
Kok and his entourage held talks at the State House with
Tanzanian government officials, touching on a myriad of
socio-economic issues, including long-term plans to ease the
power shortage currently plaguing the country.
</P>
<P>
Kok, who left Dar es Salaam Tuesday for Kagera Region, plans
to visit various development projects funded by the Netherlands
in the region before proceeding to Kigoma Region later for
another tour.
</P>
<P>
He will wind up his three-day working visit Thursday after an
informal meeting with the Netherlands Development Organization
project aimed at supporting small entrepreneurs in Arusha.

<HEADLINE> Canada's Deficit Falls to 8.9 Billion Dollars </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, October 15 (Xinhua) -- Canada's deficit for 1996-97
fell to 8.9 billion dollars (6.4 billion US dollars), Finance
Minister Paul Martin said in Vancouver today.
</P>
<P>
The figure is almost 20 billion dollars down from the previous
fiscal year, and the largest year-over-year improvement in
Canadian history.
</P>
<P>
"This represents the smallest federal government deficit in
over two decades -- indeed, as a proportion of our economy, at 1.1
percent of the gross domestic product, it is the lowest deficit
recorded since 1970-71," Martin said.
</P>
<P>
The minister made the announcement in releasing the
government's annual Economic and Fiscal Update to the House of
Commons Standing Committee on Finance in Vancouver today.
</P>
<P>
The deficit in the current fiscal year is continuing to decline
and the government is committed to achieve a balanced budget no
later than the next fiscal year, which starts April 1, 1998.
</P>
<P>
And it will be the first year that Canada's federal
government's books have been balanced since 1969-70, he said.
</P>
<P>
Martin attributed the deficit decline to several factors,
including the government's restraint measures in the past several
years, a strong economy that generates more revenues.
</P>
<P>
As a result of the falling deficit, Canada's debt-to-GDP ratio
fell to 73.1 percent, the first meaningful decline in some 25
years.
</P>
<P>
Martin ruled out any general tax cuts once the deficit is
eliminated, because it would run the risk of "plunging us back
into deficit, or else forcing crippling cuts to essential
programs."
</P>
<P>
The government said earlier that any surplus would be split
between economic and social needs, and tax cuts and debt
reduction.
</P>
<P>
The 50-50 allocation would be used as a guideline when it is
time to spend any surplus, Martin said.

<HEADLINE> Turkish PM to Visit France for Its EU Bid </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, October 15 (Xinhua) -- Turkish Prime Minister Mesut
Yilmaz is to fly to Paris Thursday to rally French support for
Ankara's bid for European Union (EU) membership, local newspaper
reports said today.
</P>
<P>
Yilmaz will persuade French President Jacques Chirac to give a
push to Turkey drive in the coming EU summit in December, the
reports said.
</P>
<P>
Turkey has been eager for full EU membership, but made little
progress on this track due to its differences with the EU on the
Kurdish issue, its human rights record and weak economy.
</P>
<P>
During the Council of Europe summit in Strasburg, France last
week, Yilmaz held talks with his French counterpart Lionel Jospin
to express Turkey's views over the EU membership issue.
</P>
<P>
Early this month, the Turkish prime minister flew to Bonn to
seek support from German Chancellor Helmut Kohl.
</P>
<P>
As part of Ankara's efforts for EU membership, Turkish Deputy
Prime Minister Bulent Ecevit started his Scandinavian tour Monday
to solicit Swedish and Finnish support for Turkey's bid.
</P>
<P>
A report prepared by the European Commission, EU's executive
body, earlier this year excluded Turkey from the ranks of the
prospective candidates for the EU enlargement process.
</P>
<P>
However, the paper listed Cyprus, a traditional rival of
Turkey, as a candidate, to the great upset of Ankara.
</P>
<P>
Turkey had repeatedly criticizing the EU for adopting a
discriminative policy towards it.

<HEADLINE> White House OMB Chief: 1997 Deficit Down Sharply </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, October 15 (Xinhua) -- Chief of the White House's
Office of Management and Budget (OMB) Franklin Raines said today
that the U.S. federal deficit for the fiscal year 1997 will be
below 30 billion dollars.
</P>
<P>
Raines made the remarks at a meeting of the U.S. National
Association of Manufacturers. It was the latest in a string of
estimates in which U.S. government budget analysts have lowered
their expectations on the deficit for the fiscal 1997 which ended
on September 30.
</P>
<P>
Clinton administration and U.S. Congressional budget officials
had said the 1997 deficit would be about 125 billion dollars when
the fiscal year started. Just last month, the OMB said it expected
a 37 billion-dollar shortfall for fiscal 1997.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. Congressional Budget Office also forecast earlier this
month that the deficit would be 23 billion dollars in last fiscal
year.
</P>
<P>
The real U.S. federal budget deficit of 1997 will be announced
later this month.
</P>
<P>
Raines also said that there was no indication that the U.S.
federal budget will be balanced in 1998 and cautioned the U.S.
Congress against planning new spending or tax cuts.
</P>
<P>
Both the White House and the U.S. Congress have said that they
expected a higher deficit in 1998 than the year of 1997 because of
the balanced-budget package which enacted last August. Many of the
tax cuts in that agreement take effect this year but few of the
spending cuts do.

South African Press Association reported.
</P>

The sugar workers told their branch leaders that they were not
prepared to sacrifice their salaries and possibly their jobs
because of a mainly political dispute.

<HEADLINE> European AIDS Conference Ends in Hamburg </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BONN, October 15 (Xinhua) -- The sixth European conference on
acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS) concluded today in the
northern German port city of Hamburg, urging further efforts in
developing new treatments of the deadly epidemic.
</P>
<P>
Some 2,500 AIDS experts from 40 countries attended the five-day
meeting, during which they discussed issues including the kind of
side effects a cocktail of drugs was having on many persons
infected with the Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV).
</P>
<P>
Drug treatment remains so far the chief method against AIDS.
Conference chairman Professor Manfred Dietrich said that the
achievements were outstanding and treatments proved lasting longer
than were assumed a year ago.
</P>
<P>
However, in treatment, scientists are still uncertain about the
timing and length of a course of combined drugs, according to
Dietrich.
</P>
<P>
Another problem is that the mutability of HIV may make the
treatment ineffective at any time.
</P>
<P>
World-renowned AIDS researchers like Professor David Ho, head
of the Diomand AIDS Center in New York, and Professor Rolf
Zinknagel, laureate of last year's Nobel Prize for Medicine,
delivered special lectures at the meeting.
</P>
<P>
Ho voiced optimism about continued progress in developing drugs
designed to inhibit the mutability of HIV. Dietrich noted it was
just a matter of time before a new generation of such drugs was
available.
</P>
<P>
The next European AIDS conference is scheduled for 1999 in
Lisbon.

WASHINGTON, October 15 (Xinhua) -- Dan Rostenkowski, formerly a
powerful member of the U.S. House of Representatives, was freed
today after serving nearly 15 months of a mail fraud sentence.
</P>
<P>
Rostenkowski was released from a Salvation Army half-way house
in Chicago shortly after midnight. He drove away in a car with two
men, ignoring three television crews and a number of reporters who
had staked out the facility, news reports said.
</P>
<P>
He had been staying at the Salvation Army facility since his
release from a minimum-security prison camp in Wisconsin on August
19.
</P>
<P>
The former chairman of the tax-writing House of Representatives
Ways and Means Committee was indicted on 17 counts of embezzling
and misusing hundreds of thousands of dollars of government money
in the operation of his congressional office.
</P>
<P>
He had denied any wrongdoing, but in April 1996 pleaded guilty
to two felony counts of mail fraud. He was sentenced to 17 months
in prison and ordered to pay 100,000 dollars in fines and
restitution.
</P>
<P>
He will remain under probation for two years.
</P>
<P>
The 69-year-old Chicago Democrat, who served 18 House terms
before he was defeated after being indicted, entered jail in July
1996.

<HEADLINE> Africa to Keep Abreast With Information Age </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, October 15 (Xinhua) -- A senior official of the Kenya
Posts and Telecommunications Corporation (KPTC) said that "Africa
will not be marginalized in the emerging information society".
</P>
<P>
The KPTC Managing Director J. Mutai told the third
International Advertising Association (IAA) Africa Congress which
closed here today that his optimism was based on on-going
technological development and positive structural changes
currently being implemented in the sector of the continent.
</P>
<P>
He acknowledged that the communications infrastructure in
Africa was the least developed in the world, saying that the
tele-density in Africa was less than 2 percent as compared to the
world average of 20 percent.
</P>
<P>
There are more telephones in New York or in Tokyo than the
whole of Africa, he said, adding that quite a number of African
countries have no direct communication links with each other and
the intra-African traffic is invariably transited via Europe.
</P>
<P>
But, the Kenyan official noted, owing to the low tele-density
and rapidly growing population, Africa constituted the largest
demand and the world's biggest market for improved communication
facilities.
</P>
<P>
Manufacturers of communication equipment throughout the world
have increasingly focused their attention on this vast market, he
added.
</P>
<P>
Mutai pointed out that the telecommunications sector in Africa
was undergoing fundamental change with more and more governments
liberalizing the sector and adopting multi-operator regulatory
regimes.
</P>
<P>
In addition to the existing Pan-African Telecommunication
Network connecting within Africa and with the rest of the world,
the majority of African countries are routing their traffic
through satellite communications, he said,
</P>
<P>
Many African countries have a growing desire to launch a
regional satellite system and have already set up the Regional
African Satellite Communication Organization which is based in
Abidjan, Mutai added.
</P>
<P>
Some telecommunication corporations are developing low and
medium earth orbiting satellite systems to connect Africa with
the rest of the world, and Iridium, one of the corporations,
plans to be first to launch its service by September 1998,
according to Mutai.
</P>
<P>
At the same time, he pointed out, international connectivity
is also provided through submarine cables, adding that plans are
now underway to implement an Optical Fiber Submarine Cable around
the African continent, which is known as "Africa One".
</P>
<P>
He stressed at the four-day meeting that the challenge now was
to maintain this impetus for change if the sector was to attract
the substantial financial investments for Africa's
telecommunications and to ensure its connectivity to the rest of
the world.

CANBERRA, October 16 (Xinhua) -- Spain played a 1-1 draw to
Pakistan Thursday in a match marred by countroversy over a
disallowed goal at the Champions' Trophy hockey tournament in
Adelaide, Australi.
</P>
<P>
Spain led 1-0 at halftime thanks to a neat goal by forward
Javier Arnau from a penalty corner set piece.
</P>
<P>
After the break, the Pakistanis piled on pressure in search of
an equaliser, but were unable to convert any of four four penalty
corners.
</P>
<P>
Then, from Pakistan's fifth penalty corner in the 62nd minute,
Naveed Alam appeared to flick the ball into the top right corner
of the net.
</P>
<P>
Danish umpire Henrik Ehlers at first allowed the goal but after
consulting Australian umpire Murray Grime, the decision was
reversed.
</P>
<P>
The action was replayed on the large video screen, and one
side-angle shot showed the ball entering the goal and hitting the
top back rail before rebounding out.
</P>
<P>
Minutes later, Pakistan had another goal disallowed for foot
obstruction but in the final minute a converted penalty corner
earned its first point of the tournament.
</P>
<P>

<HEADLINE> S. Korea's NKP Mounts Legal Action against Opposition Leader </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SEOUL, October 16 (Xinhua) -- South Korea's ruling New Korea
Party (NKP) today filed with prosecutors allegations of bribery,
tax evasion and libel against opposition leader Kim Dae-jung.
</P>
<P>
The NKP also handed the prosecution "concrete evidence" to back
its claims of corruption against Kim, the leader of the main
opposition National Congress for New Politics (NCNP).
</P>
<P>
The NKP charged that Kim had taken illegal bribes amounting to
more than 13 billion won (about 15 million U.S. dollars) from 10
business groups and had evaded taxes by stashing over 100 billion
won (about 110 million U.S. dollars) in secret funds kept in the
bank accounts of relatives and in-laws.
</P>
<P>
While the NKP is pushing hard to start an investigation into
its allegations about Kim's alleged slush funds, the prosecution
has not decided whether to begin an investigation.
</P>
<P>
A top prosecutor said his office will make the decision after a
very careful review of the NKP allegations, and repeated that a
probe would be launched only if concrete evidence emerged.
</P>
<P>
Officials of Kim's NCNP, however, said they had decided not to
file any counter-complaint against the NKP for the time being.
</P>
<P>
But one official said the party will file complaints against
President Kim Young-sam over his 1992 presidential campaign
spending, and against NKP presidential candidate Lee Hoi-chang for
his spending during the July NKP nomination contest if the
prosecution begins investigation of Kim.
</P>
<P>
The NCNP official said its counter-action may turn the
presidential race into a "war of character assassination."
</P>
<P>
Despite the aggressive allegations of corruption by the NKP,
Kim is still comfortably leading all opinion polls, well ahead of
the NKP's Lee, who is in a distant third place.
</P>
<P>
South Korea will hold presidential election in December this
year.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, October 16 (Xinhua) -- At the third Australia-China
Science and Technology Commission meeting here today, Li Xueyong,
China's Vice-Minister of the State Science and Technology
Commission, and Professor John Stocker, head of an Australian
Science and Technology delegation signed an agreement on
agriculture, pharmaceuticals, information technology,
environmental protection, new materials, energy resources,
semiconductors, and chemistry.
</P>
<P>
Prof. Stocker told Xinhua that priority is being given to
collaboration in satellite remote sensing technology, used for
studying crop output and plant diseases, and for environmental
protection projects.
</P>
<P>
Australian scientists and technologists discussed the progress
on projects started after the 2nd Commission meeting in Canberra
in 1994 with their Chinese counterparts during this four-day
meeting, Stocker said.
</P>
<P>
Vice-Minister Li said that China and Australia have much in
common because agriculture occupies an important place in their
economies. Both also have long coastlines and give priority to
high technology use.
</P>
<P>
He expressed the hope that the two will promote scientific and
technological co-operation in the Asia-Pacific Region.
</P>
<P>
In 1985, China and Australia signed a scientific and
technological co-operation agreement, and since then have
co-operated in agriculture, forestry, animal husbandry, nuclear
technology, communications, environmental protection, and other
areas.
</P>
<P>
Commission meeting are held every three years. The first was
held in June 1991 in Beijing, and the next is scheduled for
Australia in the year 2000.

<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, October 16 (Xinhua) -- Hong Kong Telecom has
announced a series of upgrades to its earth station facilities,
the largest in Asia, to further improve its satellite services,
including the introduction of a service level of close to 100
percent availability.
</P>
<P>
The move is aimed at satisfying the rapidly growing volume and
rising standards of satellite communications customers.
</P>
<P>
Among the many facility and service enhancements is the
installation of remote-controllable video/audio and Intermediate
Frequency switches at Hong Kong Telecom's earth station and
International TV centers.
</P>
<P>
The company will also install additional dedicated TV equipment
to meet the rising number of international broadcasters to the
region, as well as a new restoration antenna to ensure tighter
monitor and network security.
</P>
<P>
The upgrades are estimated to be close to 50 million HK dollars
(6.4 million U.S. dollars).
</P>
<P>
"As a first step, we are upgrading our facilities to continue
providing services of the highest quality, complemented by a
sophisticated digital infrastructure, advanced equipment and
reliable management and support," said K.W. Chan, manager of
Broadcast and Fixed Satellite Services at Hong Kong Telecom.
</P>
<P>
The next step is to introduce new services and facilities from
the existing Hong Kong Telecom portfolio for customers, Chan
added.

<HEADLINE> Yeltsin Vows not to Change Government </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, October 16 (Xinhua) -- Russian President Boris Yeltsin
is not going to change the present government despite pressure by
some deputies of the State Duma, the lower house of the
parliament, a government official said today.
</P>
<P>
The official, a high-ranking representative of the Presidential
Administration, told reporters the president did not even intend
to discuss the issue with the opposition.
</P>
<P>
In no case would the president use First Deputy Prime Minister
Anatoly Chubais as an exchange card at talks with the opposition,
the official said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin today denied the
allegation by senior officials that he would have resigned if the
State Duma had voted no-confidence in the government, the Interfax
news service reported.
</P>
<P>
Chernomyrdin told reporters that his personal rules of conduct
forbade him to intimidate anybody, even by the threat of his own
resignation.
</P>
<P>
The Federal government has "sufficient possibilities within the
bounds of the constitution and other laws to avoid a situation
whereby the government would hang in suspense for three months",
he said. The government, he added, would not work under such
circumstances.
</P>
<P>
Chernomyrdin also ruled out the possibility of any government
member leaving his or her post in the near future. He said: "There
is no need for sacking any ministers. All of them are working with
overload."
</P>
<P>
Under the Russian constitution, the president proposes his
candidate for prime minister to the Duma. The prime minister in
his turn proposes Cabinet members, and finally the president
approves the government composition by decree.

<HEADLINE> News Analysis: Pak Rupee Depreciation, Inevitable to </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, October 16 (Xinhua) -- The State Bank of Pakistan
has depreciated the value of Pak rupee by a massive 8.71 percent
against the U.S. dollar in a bid to stimulate the stagnant
industrial sector.
</P>
<P>
This downward adjustment of rupee value is believed to be the
highest-ever devaluation of the local currency in one go during
the last 20 years. It was the sixth downward adjustment of rupee
against the dollar by the present government.
</P>
<P>
The announcement made by the government Wednesday came just
days before the executive board meeting of the International
Monetary (IMF) to consider the Enhanced Structural Adjustment
Facility/Extended Fund Facility program for Pakistan.
</P>
<P>
Economists here are of the view that the Pakistani government
was reluctant to go for devaluation and argued with the IMF that
as the mark up rates are being reduced and the inflation rate has
been contained, there is no need to devalue the local currency.
</P>
<P>
However, the continuous decline in exports and unsatisfactory
results of the reforms have forced the government to follow the
IMF suggestion.
</P>
<P>
It is also believed that the latest devaluation was spurred by
the Pak rupee appreciation against the regional currencies which
was causing decline in Pakistan's exports.
</P>
<P>
A report today in the major English daily, The Nation, said the
mounting pressure for devaluation was coming from exporters on the
plea that exports were not picking up because of the inflation
differential between Pakistan and its major trading partners,
especially those in Europe.
</P>
<P>
However, there remains a long and inconclusive debate in
Pakistan for and against devaluation of the local currency.
</P>
<P>
The pro camp argues that the inflation differential between
Pakistan and its major markets, as well as between Pakistan and
its major competitors in those markets, necessitates periodic
readjustment of rupee to keep the exports competitive, thereby
easing pressure on the balance of trade.
</P>
<P>
The anti camp, however, argues that the inherited structural
bias of Pakistan's economy towards an import substitution strategy
of industrialization means that Pakistan's dependence on imported
plant and raw materials for such industry will always negate or
nullify whatever healthy impact devaluation may have on exports.
</P>
<P>
The trade and industry organizations have shown concern over
the large-scale devaluation as, according to them, the cost of
Pakistan's imports especially that of the industrial raw material
will go up and lead to higher prices of the finished products.
</P>
<P>
The consumers associations have condemned the action as all the
consumer durables will go out of reach of common man. They are
skeptical of the rise in exports as all the past devaluation
failed to boost exports.
</P>
<P>
Defending the decision, Finance Minister Sartaj Aziz said that
the Pak rupee is linked with the dollar, the latter has gained
considerable strength in terms of other currencies, and the rupee
has thus effectively been appreciated against these currencies.
</P>
<P>
Another external factor of some urgency was created by the
currency upheaval in Southeast Asia since July, said Aziz, adding
that any further delay would have put Pakistan into trouble.
</P>
<P>
He claimed that Pakistan would not depreciate its currency any
more during the current fiscal year. He also asserted the
devaluation would neither affect the common man nor flame
inflation.
</P>
<P>
The cost of transportation, electricity and food items will
remain the same which would not put any additional burden on the
common man, he said.
</P>
<P>
However, there is no doubt the exchange rate adjustment has
consequences in terms of higher prices of imported goods,
including petroleum, and higher debt-servicing costs.
</P>
<P>
Economists here believe that the most important impact of the
exchange rate adjustment will be on manufactured exports,
particularly high-valued textiles and many non-traditional
exports.
</P>
<P>
However, as the finance minister claims, the latest move will
enable greater exports when Pakistan is likely to have larger
exportable surpluses due to improved agricultural outlook which
provides the basis for export-led growth in the economy.
</P>
<P>
It is also believed that the exchange rate adjustment will
encourage Pakistan's import-substituting activities. Coupled with
the other measures, this action is expected to provide a major
boost to industrial and agriculture production and promote greater
employment and investment in Pakistan.

<HEADLINE> Heavy Fighting Breaks out in Northern Afghanistan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, October 16 (Xinhua) -- Heavy fighting has broken out
in Mazar-e-Sharif, capital of the northern Afghan province of
Balkh, between forces of northern Uzbek warlord Rashid Dostum and
General Abdul Malik.
</P>
<P>
According to reports reaching here this evening, Commander Juma
Khan of Hezb-Islami Hikmatyar and Hezb-i-Wahdat (Khalili group)
supported Malik's forces in the fighting, while Hezb-i-Wahdat
Akbari group and former defense minister Ahmad Shah Masood's
fighters supported Dostum, who was ousted by his one-time
supporter Malik in May.
</P>
<P>
Malik briefly sided with the Taliban militia in May to oust
Dostum, but later joined the anti-Taliban alliance.
</P>
<P>
The reports said the clashes took place in the center of the
city this morning. But so far there have been no reports on the
losses in the fighting.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, forces of the Afghan Taliban militia captured
Shaekhali district of the northern province of Parwan, where
Masood's forces faced a defeat, said the reports.
</P>
<P>
At the same time, Masood's forces launched a heavy attack in
Takhar province on the Taliban positions and claimed a success in
the fighting, the reports said.

<HEADLINE> Seoul Prosecution Appeals President's Son's Sentence </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SEOUL, October 16 (Xinhua) -- South Korean prosecutors filed an
appeal today against the three-year sentence handed down by a
district court to Kim Hyun-chul, the second son of President Kim
Young-sam.
</P>
<P>
The prosecution asked for a firmer punishment for the junior
Kim, and claimed he should have been found guilty on one
additional count which the court deemed him innocent of.
</P>
<P>
Kim was sentenced Monday for bribery and tax evasion, and fined
1.44 billion won (1.57 million U.S. dollars).
</P>
<P>
Prosecutors, who had earlier demanded that Kim serve seven-year
imprisonment, said the charge involved money Kim allegedly
received from the Dooyang Group in return for business favors.
</P>
<P>
But the district court said there was no evidence to support
the prosecution's accusation.
</P>
<P>
In another move, the president's son also appealed his sentence
to the Seoul District Court Wednesday, arguing that it was
unreasonable for the court to find him guilty of evading taxes
which he was never asked to pay.
</P>
<P>
It is the first case in South Korea in which someone has been
sentenced over tax payments in connection with "political funds"
received.

government support to promote their businesses, according to
financial experts.
</P>

<P>
SHANGHAI, October 16 (Xinhua) -- World and Olympic champion
Deng Yaping retained her singles title in the women's table tennis
tournament at the Eighth National Games here on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese veteran paddler with four Olympic golds beat Wang
Hui of Heilongjiang province to award the gold to her native Henan
province in straight sets 21-12, 21-7, 21-15.
</P>
<P>
With defensive tactics, Wang Hui surprised her opponents by
entering the finals after victories over ninth-ranked Wu Na and
eighth-ranked Wang Chen.
</P>
<P>
However, Deng Yaping, the top player in the world, sacrificed
her fast attacks for loops and ripped the rhythm of Wang Hui
through cunning drops en route to her final victory.
</P>
<P>
Wang Hui still remained as a phenomenon in the tournament after
she won her singles title in the National Championships last year,
the first time in a decade for a chopper to achieve such a feat.
</P>
<P>
Liaoning's Wang Nan won the women's bronze medal by defeating
world number two Li Ju of Jiangsu 21-10, 21-13 and 21-12, who was
eliminated by Wang Hui in the semifinals.
</P>
<P>
Olympic men's singles champion Liu Luoliang paired with veteran
Wang Tao to retain the doubles title for the Chinese Army by
ousting local tandem Feng Zhe and Wang Liqin 21-13, 21-10, 20-22,
21-13.
</P>
<P>
Chen Longcan, who won China's first men's doubles Olympic gold
with Wei Qingguang in the Seoul Games in 1988, paired with Zhang
Yu to take the bronze for Sichuan.
</P>
<P>
In the mixed doubles finals, Jiangsu's Qin Zhijian and Yang
Ying captured the gold by beating Henan's Meng Xianjian and Zhang
Hui 21-13, 21-18, 17-21, 21-9.

<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, October 16 (Xinhua) -- Two previously unidentified
viruses have been found in pig organs, raising a new hurdle for
pig-to-human transplants.
</P>
<P>
The viruses, which were reported today in the science journal,
Nature, form part of the pig's own genetic complement, meaning
that it will be very difficult to get rid of them.
</P>
<P>
They can cause leukaemia in monkeys, cats and birds and are
thought to be able to infect humans.
</P>
<P>
Tens of millions of pounds have been invested in attempts to
raise pigs genetically so that their organs can be transplanted to
humans.
</P>
<P>
The new findings are published by scientists from the Institute
for Medical Research in Mill Hill, northwest London.
</P>
<P>
They concluded that, because the viruses were so common in a
wide range of pigs, "the breeding of virus-free pigs, if at all
feasible, will represent a complex task."

Menuhin told the press earlier that the special thing about the
performance is that the violinist can show his feelings as a
Chinese about this musical piece. Their close co-ordination could
be seen throughout the entire two-hour performance.
</P>
<P>
Hu entered the Menuhin Music Academy in Gstaad in 1984 and has
worked together with Menuhin up to the present.
</P>
<P>
Menuhin said that the members of the National Symphony

feeling that we can share musical thoughts and experiences
together," he said.

<HEADLINE> EU Seeks WTO Ruling on Chilean Liquor Tax </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, October 16 (Xinhua) -- The European Commission, the
European Union's executive body, today asked the World Trade
Organization (WTO) to rule whether Chilean taxation of alcoholic
beverages violates world trade rules.
</P>
<P>
The Commission is complaining about the wide gap between the
tax rates imposed on imported spirits compared with local produce.
</P>
<P>
Imported whisky faces a 70-percent tax and vodka and the
majority of other imported spirits face a 30 percent tax, whereas
local alcoholic beverage face only a 25 percent tax.
</P>
<P>
A local product, pisco, represents about 80 percent of the
total market for spirits inside the country.
</P>
<P>
Surveys on consumption of imported whisky and pisco between
1982 and 1995 showed that the market share of European whisky
fell from 19 percent to less than 3 percent while the market share
of pisco more than trebled.
</P>
<P>
The EC argued that the difference Chile effectively
discriminates against imported spirits and therefore breaches WTO
rules.
</P>
<P>
As a WTO member, Chile is committed to not discriminate against
imported products by internal taxation.
</P>
<P>
The Chilean case bears a striking resemblance to the case
levied against Japan in 1995.
</P>
<P>
The United States and Canada jointly resorted to the WTO
dispute settlement mechanism against the Japanese liquor tax
regime which was found to be incompatible with WTO rules.
</P>
<P>
As a result, Japan announced a reform of its liquor tax regime
so that it no longer taxes imported products significantly higher
than the domestic produce.
</P>
<P>
European global exports of spirits amount to about four billion
ECUs (4.4 billion U.S. dollars) a year and employs 50,000 people
among EU countries.

<P>
MANILA, October 16 (Xinhua) -- A united opposition party was

Ramos in next year's presidential polls.
</P>
<P>
The party, Struggle of the Nationalist Filipino Masses, was

led by Vice President Joseph Estrada, the Struggle of the
Democratic Filipino chaired by Senator Edgardo Angara and the
Nationalist People's Coalition headed by Senate President Ernesto
Maceda.
</P>
<P>
At the founding ceremony, the leaders and more than 3,000
members of the party ratified a covenant of unity, vowing to
support whoever is chosen as the party's presidential candidate.
</P>
<P>
A convention to choose the new party's candidate in the 1998
polls will be held on November 27, about six months before the
country's national elections.
</P>
<P>
At today's meeting, the participants elected Maceda the party's
interim national chairman, Angara the interim national president
and Senator Oriando Mercado the secretary general.
</P>

<HEADLINE> China Needs To Exploit More Overseas Oil </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, October 16 (Xinhua) -- China's petroleum and natural
gas production can no longer meet the needs of its rapidly growing
economy and needs to exploit more foreign oil, an official in
charge of the country's overseas oil engineering programs said
here today.
</P>
<P>
Qin Anmin, manager of the China Petroleum Engineering
Construction Co., told the 15th World Petroleum Congress that
China was an oil exporter a few years ago but is now an
importer. It produced 157 million tons of crude oil last year and
imported some 20 million tons.
</P>
<P>
It is possible to do this for a short period of time, he said,
but not for long, not only because of the cost, but also because
a stable oil supply is hard to guarantee.
</P>
<P>
So, China has no choice but to open up more and make a greater
effort in developing overseas oilfields to share the world oil
resources. This is a strategic option for sustainable
growth. Building stable petroleum and gas production bases is also
necessary for improved distribution of China's oil and gas
resources, he said.
</P>
<P>
The China National Petroleum Corp. and his engineering
construction company have bought into oilfields in Canada, Peru,
Thailand, Kazakhstan, Venezuela, Malaysia, and Pakistan. Last
year, China had 700,000 tons of crude oil coming from overseas
co-operative oilfields.
</P>
<P>
The China Petroleum Engineering Construction Co. has signed 230
overseas oil and technological service contracts. The company has
completed 1.6 billion US dollars worth of contracts, and has been
selected during 1994-1997 as one of the most important oil
engineering contractors in the world, the manager said.

SHANGHAI, October 16 (Xinhua) -- Shanghai's first International
Arts Fair that opened here today, has 5,000 paintings from
Switzerland, the United States, China and other countries in an
8,200-sq.m. area in the World Trade Plaza.
</P>
<P>
The six-day fair has oil paintings, traditional Chinese
paintings, watercolors, calligraphy, and sculptures on display.
</P>
<P>
Switzerland's Galerie Sagg Arah brought 26 paintings, including

gallery's owner, said they are looking for potentially successful
young Chinese artists and give them worldwide exposure.
</P>
<P>
In addition to the works of Picasso, one can find works of
Renoir, Chagall, and some great Chinese artists like Wu Changshuo,
Xu Beihong, Zhang Daqian, Fu Baoshi, Pan Tianshou, Qi Baishi, and
Feng Zikai.
</P>
<P>
Ding Shaoguang, a famous Chinese-American painter, rented a
showroom for himself. "Many foreigners have listed Shanghai at the
top of the most prosperous cities in the 21st century because of
its cultural background," said the artist, who was born in China's
Shaanxi province.
</P>
<P>
Professor Wang Dawei, vice dean of the Arts College at Shanghai
University, said, "As an international metropolis, Shanghai
improves its cultural function along with rapid economic
development."
</P>
<P>
Some of the works will be auctioned during the fair, according
to the organizers.

<P>
BEIJING, October 16 (Xinhua) -- Chinese Vice-Premier Wu
Bangguo, in a meeting with David J. Law-Smith, chairman and CEO of
the U.S.'s Caltex Petroleum Corp., who is here for the 15th World
Petroleum Congress, said the world's petroleum producers have
expressed a willingness to increase co-operation with Chinese
counterparts.
</P>
<P>
Caltex has co-operated with the Chinese for a decade or more,
Wu said, adding that he hopes this can be increased.
</P>
<P>
Wu said that in nearly 20 years, China has made tremendous
progress and that Deng Xiaoping Theory has proven that it can lead
China to prosperity and strength. China will adhere to the reform
and opening-up policy and improve the economic structure and
opening-up for greater economic progress.
</P>
<P>
"We are fully confident of the future and, in the next century,
China will become stronger and even more prosperous," he said.
</P>
<P>
Law-Smith said that China has huge market and a bright future
for development. He said he believes that Caltex's co-operation
with China will be even more successful.

<P>
Caltex has invested some 200 million U.S. dollars in China,
including a 40-million-dollar wholly-owned lubricant factory,
which is under construction in the bonded area in Tianjin, the
coastal port city near to Beijing.

<HEADLINE> Italian Government Wins Confidence Vote </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ROME, October 16 (Xinhua) -- The Italian government won a
confidence vote in the lower house this afternoon, restoring its
majority and formally ending the political crisis triggered by the
resignation of Prime Minister Romano Prodi a week ago.
</P>
<P>
Prodi announced his resignation on October 9, following the
Communist Refoundation Party's refusal to soften its opposition to
rewriting the deficit-cutting draft.
</P>
<P>
Prodi's government depended on the Communist Refoundation Party
in the lower house to pass legislation.
</P>
<P>
In today's vote, the left-wing Communist Refoundation voted
with the Olive Tree governing alliance in the confidence test.
</P>
<P>
The result of the vote was seen as a foregone conclusion as the
government and Communist Refoundation reached an agreement earlier
this week.
</P>
<P>
Under the agreement, the party was to support the
16.6-billion-U.S.-dollar budget. And in exchange, the government
was to reduce the working week to 35 hours by 2001, reduce
spending cuts by 330 million U.S. dollars, protect pensions for
blue-collar workers, and open consultations on economic and social
policy.
</P>
<P>
The confidence debate will move to the Senate later this
afternoon followed by a confidence motion in the evening.

<HEADLINE> Security Tightened in Sri Lanka's Capital </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
COLOMBO, October 16 (Xinhua) -- The Sri Lankan Defense Ministry
said today that security in the capital Colombo has been
strengthened and contingency plans have been put into operation to
meet any further Tamil rebel attacks.
</P>
<P>
The ministry in a press release declared that measures have
been taken by the security forces to ensure the safety of life and
property of all citizens and visitors residing in Colombo and
other areas of the island nation.
</P>
<P>
The ministry said the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE)
carried out Wednesday morning's bombing attack because it has
become "extremely desperate" with regard to its losses in the
battle field in the north.
</P>
<P>
Over 2,500 rebels have been killed and a large number injured
in fighting since government troops launched the military
operation "Jayasikuru" (Certain Victory) on May 13, the ministry
noted.
</P>
<P>
The ministry also said that the explosion came in the wake of
the declaration by the United States that the LTTE and other 29
organizations were on its terrorist organization list.
</P>
<P>
"In desperation, the LTTE has chosen to explode a vehicle bomb
at the car park of a tourist hotel without giving any
consideration to the fact that there were many foreign nationals,"
the ministry said.
</P>
<P>
A truck loaded with explosives rammed into the car park of the
Galadari Hotel in the business center of Colombo Wednesday morning
before it exploded.
</P>
<P>
So far 16 people were killed in the incident, including five
rebels shot dead by security forces in crossfire after the
explosion. A total of 108 people were injured.

XIAOLANGDI, October 16 (Xinhua) -- Three diversion tunnels for
the Xiaolangdi water project on the Yellow River in central
China's Henan province were cleared on Wednesday and are ready for the
damming of the river on October 26.
</P>
<P>
The tunnels will be used to redirect water flow when the river
is dammed.
</P>
<P>
Because October is the dry season, only one tunnel is needed,
said Zhang Ziwei, deputy chief supervisor of the flood relief
project.
</P>
<P>
Work is also under way on a 152-meter-high cofferdam, which will be
283 meters high by the year 2001. So far, 16.6 million cubic
meters of earth and stones, or 32 percent of the amount needed,
have been used at the site.
</P>
<P>
The Xiaolangdi project is 40 km northwest of Luoyang, an
ancient city in central China. It will play an important role in
controlling flooding, reducing silt deposits, and dealing with the
ice menace.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: Colombo Returns to Normal After Bombing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
COLOMBO, October 16 (Xinhua) -- The Sri Lankan capital of
Colombo returned to normal today after a powerful bombing ripped
through a downtown district Wednesday morning, and repair work has
been underway in the shattered business district.
</P>
<P>
The explosion site in the car park of Galadari Hotel, a
five-star landmark in business district Colombo 1, was still
cordoned off. Though there are still many heavily armed soldiers
and policemen, their number has been reduced greatly.
</P>
<P>
Senior officials of the hotels and other damaged buildings
surrounding the park were reckoning the losses. Employees were
allowed to return to their smashed offices to clear up the mess
after they showed their ID cards at the check points.
</P>
<P>
Most of the debris on the main road near the affected area has
been removed, and trucks were called in to take rubbles and
destroyed vehicles away.
</P>
<P>
In other parts of the city, offices, shops and markets opened
as usual and people went about their business as if nothing had
happened in this city.
</P>
<P>
Police sources confirmed a total of 16 people died in the
incident, including five rebels shot dead by security forces.
Among the dead was a foreigner whose nationality was not disclosed
yet.
</P>
<P>
A total of 108 people, including 32 foreigners, were injured in
the incident, police said. Among them, 24 were hospitalized.
</P>
<P>
One terrorist suspect was captured alive by the security
forces, police said.
</P>
<P>
Both the Galadari Hotel and the Hilton Hotel are closed
temporarily and their guests have been transferred to other hotels
in Colombo.
</P>
<P>
Yasmin Cader, public relations manager of Hilton, said her
hotel could have to be closed for at least three to four months
for repairs.
</P>
<P>
World Trade Center sources said their technical staff could not
carry out their survey in detail at the rear side of the building
due to fear of falling glass and windows. A large section of the
rear wall, about 10 meters high, collapsed in the explosion.
</P>
<P>
The Colombo Stock Exchange housed in the trade center suspended
trading today.
</P>
<P>
Police investigations are still underway.

<HEADLINE> World Record Holder Liu Crashed in National Games </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, October 16 (Xinhua) -- World record holder Liu Limin
made an early exit in the preliminaries of the women's 100 meters
butterfly, creating the biggest upset in the pool at the Eighth
National Games here on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The event was won by Qu Yun of the Chinese Army with a time of
59.36 seconds, followed by Shanghai's Cai Huijue in 59.47 and
Liaoning's Ning Bo in 1:00.08.
</P>
<P>
Liu, silver medalist in the event in the Atlanta Olympic Games,
finished fourth in the group eight heats, failing to qualify for
the final eight.
</P>
<P>
"In fact, she has made full preparation for the National Games.
Maybe she took it too easy for the preliminaries which eventually
became a fatal mistake," said Zhou Ming, vice head coach of the
Chinese national swimming team.
</P>
<P>
"It's a pity. But she still has a chance in the 200m butterfly.
She is the best Chinese swimmer in the event," Zhou said of the
veteran, member of the world record holders in the women's 4X100m
team medley in both long and short course with He Cihong, Dai
Guohong and Le Jingyi.
</P>
<P>
Liu also established a world record in the 100m butterfly in
the World Short Course Swimming Championships in Rio de Janeiro,
Brazil, in 1995.
</P>
<P>
In the men's 400m freestyle, Jin Hao took a sweet revenge over
local favorite Xiong Guoming to win the gold.
</P>
<P>
Jin, 18, who finished second after Xiong in the 400m individual
medley on Tuesday, clocked a new national mark of three minutes
54.78.
</P>
<P>
Xiong won the silver with 3:55.13 while former national mark
holder Deng Qingsong settled for the third with 3:55.48.
</P>
<P>
Jin, who stands 1.85 meters, trailed Deng in the first 300
meters, but made a spectacular dash in the last 100 meters to take
the gold.
</P>
<P>
"I'm excited to win the first gold for Shandong since this is
the first time I have won a gold in a major competition," Jin
said. "I am confident I can achieve good results in other events."

<HEADLINE> Over 1,500 Steles Discovered in Southern Ethiopia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ADDIS ABABA, October 16 (Xinhua) -- Over 1,500 steles have
been discovered in various localities of southern Ethiopia, a
report from the Ethiopian News Agency said today.
</P>
<P>
The report quoted the culture and information bureau of the
South Ethiopian People's National State as saying that the
steles, estimated to be up to 1,200 years old, were erected to
commemorate wars, transition of tribal authority and war heroes.
</P>
<P>
Metasebiya Bekele, an expert from the bureau, was quoted as
saying that the tradition of erecting stone steles is almost a
bygone practice, and is now exercised only by the Konos
nationality, which observed a transfer of authority by erecting a
two-meter stone last year.
</P>
<P>
About 1,000 of the afore-mentioned steles have been recognized
by the state's trade, industry and tourism bureau and are being
visited by tourists, the expert noted.

delegation. Algeria's energy minister also said that co-operation

<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, October 16 (Xinhua) -- Indonesia's ruling Golkar party
nominated Soeharto as its candidate for the country's next
president.
</P>
<P>
General Chairman of the Golkar Harmoko said a number of inputs
have been received by the party saying there is no other figure
that can be nominated for presidency but Chairman of the Golkar
Board of Patron Soeharto.
</P>
<P>
"It is people's wish, an aspiration for democracy. Therefore,
we will take this aspiration as the party's deciding factor," said
Harmoko in his speech at the opening of Golkar's 4th leaders'
meeting here today.
</P>
<P>
He said that with the decision, Golkar, in accordance with the
party's rules, has now a name that will be endorsed in the
People's Consultative Assembly (MPR) general session in March
1998.
</P>
<P>
"Let us pray to god that H. Muhammad Soeharto (present
president) will continue to be well and has the moral force to
lead the nation towards the 21st century," Harmoko said.
</P>
<P>
On the party's nominee for vice president, Harmoko said Golkar
is still preparing one.

The newly inducted 1,000 members of the MPR will meet next
March to elect a president and a vice president and establish the

<HEADLINE> Israeli Opposition Camp Launching New Campaign </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, October 16 (Xinhua) -- Israeli opposition parties
are launching a new campaign to oust Prime Minister Benjamin
Netanyahu over the current diplomatic and coalition crises caused
by Netanyahu's policies.
</P>
<P>
Leading opposition Labor Party's head Ehud Barak has been
holding meetings with party leaders within the ruling coalition
and even key figures from the Netanyahu-led Likud Party, in an
attempt to gain support from 80 lawmakers needed to oust
Netanyahu without holding new election for the Knesset
(Parliament).
</P>
<P>
Under the Basic Law that went into effect in last year's
elections, 80 Knesset members can automatically oust the prime
minister without holding new election for the Knesset; If 61
Knesset members vote against the government, it has to step down
to pave the way for holding new elections both for the prime
minister and the Knesset.
</P>
<P>
Israel Radio quoted Labor sources as saying that Barak had
found "broad support" both within the coalition and the Likud
camp. The report did not elaborate on the number of supporters,
but it is believed to be difficult for Barak to garner the
support of 80 Knesset members.
</P>
<P>
In his own initiative, Yossi Sarid, leader of another major
opposition party Meretz, today issued a call to 97 Knesset
members, who do not belong to the religious bloc, to make public
declaration against the proposed conversion law and religious
council law that discriminate against the secular community.
</P>
<P>
Barak's campaign to oust Netanyahu came following the
diplomatic crisis triggered by the failed attempt to assassinate
Islamic Resistance Movement (Hamas) leader Khaled Mashaal in
Jordan last month, which has strained Israeli diplomatic
relations with Jordan and Canada.
</P>
<P>
Netanyahu was responsible for ordering the attack by two
Israeli agents who used forged Canadian passports and has been
widely criticized for his arrogance and misjudgement.
</P>
<P>
Following the Mashaal affair, some centrist coalition parties
such as The Third Way and Yisrael Ba'aliya Party, have called for
setting up a national unity government between Likud and the
Labor.
</P>
<P>
The latest government crisis centered over the impending
passing by the Knesset of the conversion law and religious
council law, which only recognize conversions conducted by
Orthodox Rabbis and will exclude non-Orthodox Jews from local
religious councils.
</P>
<P>
The influential religious bloc within the current coalition
has threatened to topple the government if it refuses their
demand to enact the proposed laws.
</P>
<P>
American Jewry, mostly belonging to the non-Orthodox Reform
and Conservative movements, are especially angered by the
discriminating laws, threatening to withhold financial support to
Israel.
</P>
<P>
If the proposed conversion law and religious council law are
passed under the pressure of the Orthodox parties, it will
further deepen the rift within the Israeli society and have wide
repercussions on the current government.
</P>
<P>
Labor and Meretz, which consider them to be protectors of the
secular interests, are expected to escalate their pressure on
the government so to force it to step down.

<P>
CANBERRA, October 16 (Xinhua) -- Australia announced today it
is to begin emergency aid flights into the worst-affected areas of
famine-stricken Papua New Guinea (PNG) early next week.
</P>
<P>
Australian Foreign Affairs Minister Alexander Downer said the
flights would begin early next week to areas which can only be
reached by air after Australia's offer was accepted by the PNG
government.
</P>
<P>
"Like many in Australia I am concerned to learn that 500,000
people are facing immediate hardship from the country's widespread
frosts and drought," Downer said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
"The flights will carry high priority food aid, like rice and
flour, to the areas at greatest risk," Downer said.
</P>
<P>
But the foreign minister did not say how much food the
Australian government will provide to PNG, which gained
independence from Australia in 1975.
</P>
<P>
The emergency aid flights will concentrate on the worst
affected areas where the situation is described as extreme with no
food available at all, water very short, widespread illness and
young children and older people dying.

China's implementation of Deng Xiaoping's diplomatic thinking and
the nation's independent foreign policy of peace. China will carry
out the guidelines in the following manner:
</P>
<P>
First, China will pursue an independent foreign policy. Deng
Xiaoping consistently reiterated that developing countries cannot
develop without self-respect and national independence, and that
state sovereignty and security should be regarded as the top
priority.
</P>
<P>
The steady enhancement of China's international status and its
growing influence and prominence in international arena can be
attributed to its persistence in independence and self-reliance
and proceeding from the fundamental interests of the Chinese
people and of the world's people in dealing with international
affairs.
</P>
<P>
Second, opposing hegemony and safeguarding world peace
represent China's consistent stand and are a long-term task facing
the world's progressive forces.
</P>
<P>
The Cold War has ended, but hegemony and power politics still
pose a threat to world peace and stability. Superpowers play power
politics with small countries from time to time and it is nothing
new that strong nations bully smaller nations, and rich countries
bully poor countries. Superpowers continue to wantonly interfere
in the internal affairs of and aggravated the situation in other
countries.
</P>
<P>
China upholds the equality of all countries, regardless of
whether a nation is large or small, rich or poor, strong or
weak. China will unremittingly oppose hegemony and power politics,
and will safeguard world peace and development. China, a permanent
member of the United Nations Security Council, will continue to
play a positive role toward this end.

<P>
Fourth, efforts to improve and develop relations with all
countries should be carried out on the basis of the Five
Principles of Peaceful Coexistence.
</P>
<P>
China's foreign policy based on strengthening its solidarity
and cooperation with other developing countries is determined by
historical experience and the needs of future development.
</P>
<P>
China and other developing countries share the same historical
experiences, and face the common task of safeguarding their
independence and sovereignty, as well as promoting economic
development.
</P>
<P>
China and other developing countries, which have shared a
common fate for many years, have supported each other, united
closely and effectively maintained their political and economic
interests.
</P>
<P>
Despite dramatic changes in the international situation, China
cannot and will not change its policy on strengthening its
solidarity and cooperation with other developing countries. China
will forever belong to the Third World.
</P>
<P>
China and western countries have different social systems,
ideology, histories and cultures. However, all sides share
extensive common interests, and there are broad prospects for
mutually beneficiary cooperation.
</P>
<P>
China has consistently held that it is normal for different
countries to have different viewpoints on certain issues. However,
it is more important for all countries to focus on long-term
interests, while seeking mutual respect, equality and benefits, as
well as noninterference in internal affairs of other nations,
friendly coexistence and common development.
</P>
<P>
Facts prove that threatening or imposing sanctions on other
countries, or otherwise frequently exerting unilateral pressure,
are no way conducive to resolving issues, but instead will sharpen
contradictions and damage the interests of all parties concerned.

<P>
Mankind's progress depends on recognizing and respecting the
diversity of the world and on peaceful co-existance among the
peoples in various countries with different social system,
ideology and lifestyles.
</P>
<P>
Any nation's attempt to ignore the diversity of the world and
to impose a self-proclaimed superior mode, social system, ideology
or lifestyle on others will arouse disgust and opposition from
other nations.
</P>
<P>
Third, China will work diligently for the establishment of a
peaceful, stable, fair and rational new world political and
economic order. The people of the world have long been demanding
the dismantling of the old international order and the
establishment of a new order.
</P>
<P>
China's has maintained a clear-cut position on the issue.
</P>
<P>
China holds that the new international order should be
established on the basis of the Five Principles of Peaceful
Coexistence and should conform with the purposes and principles of
the UN Charter.
</P>
<P>
The new international order should be based on the following
contents: All countries should have the right to select their own
development mode according to their own national conditions, with
other countries having no right to interfere; All countries should
be equal members of the international community and no country
should seek hegemony or practice power politics; Conflicts between
different countries should be resolved through peaceful means, and
no country should resort to force or threat to use force;
Economic, scientific, technological and cultural exchanges and
cooperation should be strengthened and expanded on the basis of
equality and mutual benefit in an effort to promote common
development and prosperity; Unequal and discriminative policies,
practices and economic sanctions related to economic and trade
ties should be opposed.
</P>
<P>
The international economy is becoming increasingly
interdependent and the economies of the North and South are
closely linked. Developed countries should create favorable
conditions to ensure the growth of developing countries. This will
be also conducive to the economic development of the developed
countries.

<P>
Fifth, for economic growth, China needs a wide range of
co-operation with the rest of the world on an equal footing. One
of its policies is to open up to the outside world more. Since the
reforms and opening-up started nearly 20 years ago, economic
exchanges with other countries have been growing and playing an
important role in improving its economy and the economy of other
countries.
</P>
<P>
With the intense competition and the rapid development of
science and technology, China should look at the outside world in
an even more positive way, perfect the opening-up, make effective
use of resources both at home and abroad, expand international
markets, and actively participate in regional economic
co-operation and global trade. Diplomacy should continue to serve
all of these.
</P>
<P>
The Communist Party of China has always placed great importance
on external relations and has paid close attention to one-on-one
diplomacy and the role of trade unions and young people's and
women's organizations in promoting mutual understanding,
friendship, and co-operation.
</P>
<P>
Some people are saying that China's development will pose a
threat to the world, and this has lead to the "China Threat"
theory, but it is totally groundless, because of the following
reasons:
</P>
<P>
A. China for a long time was subjected to acts of aggression,
oppression and humiliation by foreign powers, and it does indeed
know the true meaning of the expression: don't do to others what
you don't want done to yourself.
</P>
<P>
B. It will take several decades to modernize China to the level
of moderately-developed countries because of its large population
and poor economy, so it needs a peaceful international environment.
</P>
<P>
C. China has always had a positive defense-oriented military
strategy, and its military expenditures are very low. The expenses
for 1997 stand at 9.71 billion US dollars, or about 3.6 percent of
the American expenditures. Jiang Zemin said in his report to the
15th Party Congress that China will cut the armed forces by
another 500,000 men over the next three years and will pose no
threat to other countries.
</P>
<P>
D. China has an independent foreign policy of peace, and all
its actions are intended to maintain that peace.

<P>
The Sino-US relationship concerns the fundamental interests of
peoples in both countries, as well as peace and development in the
Asian-Pacific Region and the world as a whole.
</P>
<P>
China and the United States will enter the 21st century with a
comparatively stable relationship so long as the two sides control
the overall situation, look to the future, firmly abide by the
three Sino-US joint communiques and properly handle the Taiwan
issue.
</P>
<P>
China and Japan should draw lessons from history, observe the
Sino-Japanese Joint Statement and the Sino-Japanese Treaty of
Peace and Friendship, follow the correct road for the development
of bilateral relations, engage in joint efforts to ensure the
fundamental interests of the peoples in the two countries, and
promote peace and development in the Asian-Pacific Region.
</P>
<P>
We should practice mutual respect while seeking common ground,
equality and mutual benefits and reserving differences and should
work with Western European countries to build a new cooperative
relationship geared to the 21st century. We should also continue
to improve and develop friendly relations with Canada, Australia
and other developed countries.
</P>
<P>
President Jiang Zemin's report at the 15th National Congress of
 Communist Party of China emphasized: "We should adhere to the
good-neighborly policy. Our consistent stand will never change."
President Jiang's statement was a solemn declaration of policy.
</P>
<P>
In recent years, China has worked hard to develop mutually
beneficial friendly cooperation with neighboring
countries. Efforts have also centered on maintaining a sound and
peaceful environment.
</P>
<P>
Historical factors and various other reasons have sparked some
differences or disputes between China and surrounding
countries. This is quite understandable and the key point centers
on how to properly treat related issues. We should peacefully
resolve the issues through friendly consultations and negotiations
in an effort to maintain the overall peaceful and stable
situation. We should put aside differences for the time being and
seek common ground while reserving differences.
</P>
<P>
China is currently concentrating on economic construction and
it is therefore important to maintain a peaceful and stable
surrounding environment in order to guarantee a smooth development
of the modernization drive. This will in turn promote better
relations between China and surrounding countries.

<HEADLINE> China Sets World Record With Its Dam Work </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
YICHANG, October 16 (Xinhua) -- For 24 hours, heavy-duty trucks
Wednesday lined both sides of two coffer-dams and dumped hundreds
of tons of rocks into the Yangtze River for the Three Gorges Dam,
while a line of ships did their part to fill the river with rocks.
</P>
<P>
The Yangtze will be officially blocked on November 8.
</P>
<P>
The 1,800 workers who were part of the exercise said that they
are resolved to challenge the record set in 1978 by Brazil and
Paraguay at the Itaipu Hydro-Electric Power Station, which is the
world's largest. Workers there dumped 146,000 cu.m. of rock into
the river in a 24 hour-period.
</P>
<P>
In a 24-hour period, 170,000 cu.m. of water passed through the
Yangtze every second, compared with 9,000 cu.m. in other large dam
projects.
</P>
<P>
The dam work narrowed the openings on the two coffer-dams to
190 meters and 255 meters, from the 260 meters and 270 meters
during the second stage of the project.

<HEADLINE> Trade Surplus Reported in Nigeria </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, October 16 (Xinhua) -- Nigeria recorded a trade surplus
of 1.31 billion U.S. dollars in the first two months of this
year, according to latest statistics of the Central Bank of
Nigeria.
</P>
<P>
Bank figures show that foreign exchange inflow to the economy
stood at 2.75 billion dollars, compared with the outflow of 1.44
billion dollars during the two months.
</P>
<P>
Crude oil is still the chief foreign exchange earner as
receipt from oil increased to 1.3 billion dollars in February
from 1.22 billion dollars in January.
</P>
<P>
Analysts said the favorable balance of trade position was
equally responsible for the increase in the country's external
reserve during the two months.
</P>
<P>
Nigeria's foreign reserve stood at 5.86 billion dollars in
February, compared to 5.15 billion dollars in January.
</P>
<P>
To cater to the needs of domestic production and consumption,
Nigeria also spent a total of 482.3 million dollars on importing
raw materials and finished goods in the January-February period.
</P>
<P>
The figure accounts for 35 percent of the total foreign
exchange outpayment for both visible and invisible imports during

<HEADLINE> Adherence to Theory of Primary Stage of Socialism  (2) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
-- The people are concentrating on building material wealth and
promoting ethical and moral progress in line with the common goal
of building socialism with Chinese characteristics and;
</P>
<P>
-- The gap between China and the advanced world levels will
gradually narrow and China will accomplish national revitalization
on the basis of socialism.
</P>
<P>
Jiang noted that "accomplishing the historical process will
require at least 100 years". He quoted Deng Xiaoping's words that
"consolidating and developing the socialist system will require a
long historical period, and the persistent efforts of several, or
even dozens of generation."
</P>
<P>
He went on to say that the conditions of socialism will require
China to undergo a long primary stage in order to realize
industrialization and perfect a modern market economy.
</P>
<P>
"We cannot skip this historical period," said Jiang.
</P>
<P>
Jiang's report to the 15th Party congress reiterated that the
fundamental task for the primary stage is to develop social
productity. Therefore, the Party and country must focus on
economic construction, with all other work subject to and serving
the central task.
</P>
<P>
One sociologist said that productivity is the deciding force
for any social development. He noted that the development of
productivity is vital for consolidating and developing socialism,
as well as for lifting socialism from a lower to a higher stage
and ensuring the ultimate realization of Communism.
</P>
<P>
He reasoned that anything conducive to developing social
productivity should conform to the fundamental interests of the
people, and should therefore fulfil all requirements and be
accepted by socialism, and vice versa.
</P>
<P>
He stressed that it has a direct bearing on and is decisively
important with regard to developing socialist productivity as
the starting pointing for all work under the present historical
conditions".
</P>
<P>
The theory of the primary stage of socialism has been accepted
as the Party's guideline for leading the people to advance the
cause of building socialism with Chinese characteristics from now
through the middle of the next century.

<HEADLINE> Adherence to Theory of Primary Stage of Socialism (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, October 16 (Xinhua) -- The 15th National Congress of
the Communist Party of China (CPC) ended last month with a call
for persevering adherence to the theory of the primary stage of
socialism.
</P>
<P>
People from all social strata responded positively to the call
by noting that adherence to the important theory will have
far-reaching significance on China's future development.
</P>
<P>
An authoritative theoretician regarded the theory of the
primary stage of socialism serves as an ideological weapon for
unifying thinking, clarifying doubt and eliminating
interference. He said that adherence to the theory is vital for
China's reform, opening-up and modernization.
</P>
<P>
The concept of the primary stage of socialism was advanced 10
years ago during the 13th National Party Congress. Jiang Zemin
re-iterated the theory and outlined basic guidelines during the
15th congress.
</P>
<P>
The theory of the primary stage of socialism includes two major
implications: China practices socialism and must adhere to the
system; Chinese socialism is still in the primary stage and cannot
overstep this primary stage.
</P>
<P>
Nine main features mark the historical period:
</P>
<P>
-- The underdeveloped economic status will gradually be cast
aside and China will basically realize modernization;
</P>
<P>
-- China will be transformed from an agricultural country which
depends heavily on manual labor to an industrial nation featuring
modern agriculture and a highly developed service industry;
</P>
<P>
-- The existin natural or semi-natural economy will move
steadily to a highly-developed market economy.
</P>
<P>
-- The high proportion of illiteracy and semi-illiteracy will
be replaced by a relatively developed advanced science, technology
education and culture, and;
</P>
<P>
-- All Chinese people will gradually gain wealth, compared to
the current situation in which people living in need account for a
high proportion of the total population and living standards as a
whole are rather low;
</P>
<P>
-- Gaps in regional economic and cultural development will
gradually be narrowed;
</P>
<P>
-- Reforms will lead to the establishment and perfection of a
socialist market economy and socialist democratic political system;

<HEADLINE> News Analysis: Colombo Bombing, Multi-purpose Action </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
COLOMBO, October 16 (Xinhua) -- The powerful blast which ripped
through a downtown district of Sri Lanka's capital Colombo
Wednesday was aimed at retaliating the U.S. announcement of
listing the Tamil tigers as terrorists, local analysts said today.
</P>
<P>
The rebels of the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE),
which was declared as a terrorist group by the U.S. government on
October 8, chose the downtown business center as their target of
bombing because there were some 12 American military officers
living in the adjoining Hilton Hotel, which was badly damaged in
the explosion, sources close to the military told Xinhua.
</P>
<P>
The suicidal truck bombing took place early Wednesday morning
in downtown Colombo, killing at least five including one foreigner
and wounding another 105 including 29 foreigners.
</P>
<P>
Military sources said the rebels planned to kill those
Americans in this bombing attack after they got learned of the
American officers' whereabouts through their intelligence network
in the army.
</P>
<P>
The sources said the Americans were on a secret trip in Colombo
to help the Sri Lankan government troops bring an end to the
14-year-long ethnic war, which has claimed more than 55,000 lives.
They arrived last week.
</P>
<P>
Industrial Development Minister C.V. Gunaratna Wednesday
denounced the bombing and pointed out that the attack was an
attempt to retaliate the U.S. government's declaration to put the
LTTE on the terrorist organization list.
</P>
<P>
U.S. Secretary of State Madelene Albright on October 8
announced that the LTTE, along with 29 other organizations in the
world, would be barred from entering and raising funds in the U.S.
 Anybody who contributes to the LTTE in the U.S. will be charged
with criminal offense under the ban.
</P>
<P>
The wider consequence beyond the announcement is that "other
governments would be requested by the U.S. government to take due
heed to this declaration and to take supportive measures in their
own countries," said Foreign Minister Lakshman Kadirgamar.
</P>
<P>
The bombing could serve other purposes as well, observers said.
</P>
<P>
The 39-story World Trade Center, the highest building in Sri
Lanka, was seriously damaged with almost all windows broken and a
large section of wall collapsed.
</P>
<P>
The twin-tower was opened by Sri Lankan President Chandrika
Kumaratunga three days before the bombing and was regarded as a
sign of the country's economic recovery. The majority of the
investment came from a Singaporean businessman.
</P>
<P>
The bombing could deter other foreign businessmen from
investing in Sri Lanka, which is eager to see more influx of
overseas investment for its development program, analysts said.
</P>
<P>
They added that the bombing could foil the government's efforts
to bring in more funds since businessmen could hardly convince
themselves to invest their money in unsafe land.
</P>
<P>
The explosion also dealt a blow to Sri Lanka's tourism
industry, one of the cornerstones in the nation's economy. Luxury
hotel facilities, as well as confidence of tourists, were
destroyed. Many foreign travelers cut short their stay and took
the earliest flights to leave the country Wednesday night.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the blast was a clear signal that the rebels would
by no means lay down their guns and accept the peace package of
the government.
</P>
<P>
The fighting in the north and east is still going on, though
the rebels have been cornered into the jungles after they lost
many of their major positions to the government troops.
</P>
<P>
Government officials said it might take months for the World
Trade Center, the Galadari Hotel, the Hilton Hotel, the Bank of
Ceylon and other buildings to clear the tons of rubbles and repair
the damages.
</P>
<P>
As to how long it will take for the country to end the war,
there is still no ready answer.

He said the companies, which were largely foreign owned, were
opposed to his government's proposal because they wanted to
maintain a monopoly.
</P>
<P>
Federal Communications Minister Richard Alston also attacked
major multinational record companies like Sony, EMI, Polygram,
Warner, Universal and BMG for spreading misinformation on the
government's proposal to scrap import restrictions on CDs, the
Australian Associated Press said in a separate story.
</P>
<P>
Local artists have warned that the loosening of import
restrictions on CDs would encourage piracy and lead to loss of
jobs in Australia.
</P>
<P>
Asked why some Australian artists were protesting the proposal
and if only the record companies benefited from the current
arrangements, the prime minister said: "they have close
associations, don't they, with the recording companies."
</P>
<P>
He said the issue was not about protection against piracy and
of copyright, which already existed.
</P>
<P>
It centered on the price of CDs, which would fall by five U.S.
dollars under the proposal, he said.
</P>
<P>
He explained that the Australian public is entitled to know
that this is a contest between the interests of ordinary
Australian consumers and those of large record companies with very
large profits which are trying to maintain an essentially monopoly
position.
</P>
<P>
Alston argued that the music industry's claim of increased CD
piracy was a "red herring" when it came to opening the market to
imported CDs.
</P>
<P>
"Japan imports twice the quantity of English language
recordings as Australia and yet they don't have a piracy problem,
they allow parallel imports," he said.
</P>
<P>
The record companies' threat to withdraw investment in
Australian music talent was hollow, having provided little support
for it except when it suited their commercial interests, he said.

<HEADLINE> Britain to Introduce Electronic Auto Speed Controls </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, October 16 (Xinhua) -- The British government has
published a document to include automatic speed controls in a list
of measures likely to be introduced to make roads safer.
</P>
<P>
Made public on Wednesday, the document marked a step closer to
taking the futuristic move to enlist the so-called "electronic
roadside brake" as a weapon for reducing road deaths.
</P>
<P>
The proposed system would operate through roadside beacons to
send speed limit information to in-car computers and enforce the
restriction via an engine management device.
</P>
<P>
Officials were quoted as saying by a Times report today that
the system was not a short-term option and more of the kind for
automatic speed control would be discussed.
</P>
<P>
Other measures listed in the document, more of short-term
solutions to road accidents, are further curbs on drink-driving,
better training and improved car design.
</P>
<P>
The government document was out in response to increasing
pressures on authorities for effective traffic-calming schemes and
better protection for the most vulnerable road users, such as
cyclists.

<HEADLINE> Australian Dollar Ends Stronger on US Name Buying </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, October 16 (Xinhua) -- The Australian dollar ended
stronger today, on the back of solid buying by a U.S. bank.
</P>
<P>
The buying was believed to be related to U.S. energy company
GPU Inc. purchase of the Victorian government's PowerNet
electricity transmission network.
</P>
<P>
The network is being purchased by GPU for 2.55 billion
Australian dollars (1.87 billion U.S. dollars).
</P>
<P>
The Australian dollar closed here at 73.79 U.S. cents, up from
73.51 Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
"The Aussie has looked pretty sound with the same guy buying,"
said SBC Warburg Australia foreign exchange executive director
John Radinoff.
</P>
<P>
The currency had started the session with a weaker tone
following a slip in the gold price.
</P>
<P>
"It has been pretty quiet and just softer on the U.S.," said a
trader at a U.S. investment bank. "People are looking to the
Consumer Price Index (CPI) next week and are watching the U.S. in
the meantime."
</P>
<P>
The third quarter CPI report due next Wednesday is expected to
show inflation pressures subside from the previous quarter.
</P>
<P>
With economic growth improving, but not enough to make
significant inroads into unemployment, and inflation currently
below the target level, there is ample reason for the Reserve Bank
to cut interest rates, traders held.
</P>
<P>
Australian dollar was at 88.82 from 89.23 against the Japanese
yen, and at 1.2897 from 1.2863 against the German mark.

<HEADLINE> Bulgarian Press Calls for Sanction Against German Group </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SOFIA, October 16 (Xinhua) -- A group of Bulgarian journalists
and publishers has called on the country's newspapers to join a
sanction against German press group Westdeutsche Allegemeine.
</P>
<P>
Representatives from 31 Bulgarian newspapers told a seminar
sponsored by the Bulgarian Association of Newspaper Publishers
that the German group is taking over their country's press market.
</P>
<P>
The outcry is prompted by Westdeutsche Allegemeine's local
acquisition of the "168 Hours" press group's printing house and
Bulgaria's top two daily papers, known as "Labor" and "24 Hours."
</P>
<P>
In addition, the Bulgarian publishers said, the German group is
also attempting to control the country's newspaper distribution
system through its own local distribution operation.
</P>
<P>
Now owned by Westdeutsche Allegemeine, "Labor" and "24 Hours"
had a combined circulation of 419,000 as of October 15, equivalent
to 68 percent of the total of Bulgaria's top 10 national dailies.
</P>
<P>
The representatives of the locally-owned Bulgarian newspapers
further alleged that the German group is trying to reduce the
share of profit entitled to local distribution outlets.
</P>
<P>
At the seminar, they agreed to submit an appeal to the
Bulgarian parliament and government in protest against what they
called "illegal operations" of German press group in Bulgaria.

NAIROBI, October 16 (Xinhua) -- Kenyan President Daniel arap

dismissing the claims by a major opposition lobby group that the
political situation in Kenya is "almost out of hand."
</P>

Local reports today quoted Moi as saying that the freedom of
speech enshrined in the constitution should not be used by
disgruntled people to spread fear that the country will fall
apart.
</P>

The government is in full control in protecting the lives and
property of peace-loving Kenyans, he stressed on Wednesday when
addressing a public rally in Nyambene District. He is widely
believed to win the coming general elections.

On the day, Kivutha Kibwana, a leader of the opposition
National Convention Executive Council (NCEC), said that the NCEC
decided to foment civil disobedience after suffering a stinging
rebuff by the Inter-Parties Parliamentary Group.

All Kenyans have no alternative but to prepare themselves for
the worst as the IPPG agenda has locked out other stake holders
in the constitutional reforms process, he said.

The IPPG reform bill is now being debated in parliament and

At a two-day workshop held here on management of fire

The minister warned that the government will ruthlessly deal
with industries that seem to have abandoned their safety
procedures because such tendencies have caused loss of property

He urged the fire services association of Zambia to work hand
in hand with various government ministries so that the
association can be assisted in their needs.

Harrington said that it is the government's duty to protect
the national infrastructures from fire destruction, thereby
attracting foreign investors.

<HEADLINE> Local Firms Optimistic about Business Prospects </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, October 16 (Xinhua) -- A survey has found that local
companies have strong confidence in Hong Kong's business
environment and are optimistic about their business prospects in
the five years through to 2001.
</P>
<P>
The survey, titled "How Businessmen See 1997 and Beyond", was
conducted by the Federation of Hong Kong Industries during a
period between May and July. 446 firms in the manufacturing,
support services and trading sectors responded.
</P>
<P>
The survey found that the firms expected most of the economic
and social factors affecting the Special Administrative Region
(SAR)'s business environment in 1997 to remain unchanged or even
to be improved. These factors included the availability of land,
labor and technology, the legal system, freedom of information,
labor productivity, infrastructure and trade.
</P>
<P>
Many firms expected an overall improvement in land and labor
availability, access to technology and better infrastructure
during the period from 1997 to 2001. But concern over the legal
system, freedom of information and corruption was expressed by a
significant number of the firms.
</P>
<P>
Regarding the prospects for investment growth, the survey found
that 42 percent expected their investment to increase while 49
percent staying the same in 1997. In the years to 2001, 62 percent
believed their investments would grow while 27 percent staying the
same.
</P>
<P>
As for investment destinations, 70 percent chose China's
interior areas in 1997. Beijing, Shanghai and Dongguan of
Guangdong Province were the most popular investment locations. 41
percent had investments in the SAR and 12 percent elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
However, the survey showed that investment in Hong Kong would
increase substantially in the years to 2001 with 62 percent of the
respondents indicating their intention to invest in the SAR by
the year 2001, 34 percent in China's interior and 12 percent in
other parts of the world.
</P>
<P>
As for expectations of turnover and profits, 86 percent of
respondents expected their turnover to increase or remain constant
 in the near future whilst a growth in profits was also
anticipated by over three quarters of the respondents.

<HEADLINE> Campaign Launched in HK for Film Relics Preservation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, October 16 (Xinhua) -- A Hong Kong Film Archive
collection campaign has been launched here for the preserving of
film heritage, with the public urged to search through their
drawers for any film oldie.
</P>
<P>
The Provisional Urban Council, organizer of the campaign,
appealed Wednesday to the public to support this worthy course by
donating or depositing their collections to the care of the Hong
Kong Film Archive.
</P>
<P>
With the support of film organizations, film makers and their
family members, the archive, since its establishment in early
1990s, has managed to collect 2,000 prints and tens of thousands
of film-related materials in the form of scripts, photographs and
magazines, according to the council.
</P>
<P>
The archive has recently obtained more precious artifacts from
the film industry. Among the donors is David Quan, son of the late
kung fu master Kwan Tak-hing, who donated numerous stills,
scripts, costumes and props.
</P>
<P>
But the council wants to tap a rich vein, that is, momentous
movies hoarded by fans for decades.
</P>
<P>
Selected materials from the collection campaign will be
displayed in April 1998 during the 22nd Hong Kong International
Film Festival.

<HEADLINE> Air Macao Expects First Net Profit This Year </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Leonel Miranda, president of the Executive Committee of Air
Macao, told the Portuguese News Agency Lusa today that the
company's business is unexpectedly "very good."
</P>
<P>
Having started commercial operation in November 1995, Air Macao
reported a loss of 37 million patacas (about 4.68 million
U.S. dollars) last year.
</P>
<P>
The company had expected a loss of 22 million patacas (about
2.78 million U.S. dollars) for this year, he said.
</P>
<P>
The unexpected good business is a result of surging number of
passengers this year, plus a stricter control of the company's
expenditure, he said.
</P>
<P>
The company has carried a total of 1.3 million passengers
since its commercial operation.
</P>
<P>
Air Macao plans to launch a new daily service to Fuzhou,
capital of coastal Fujian Province on October 26. By then, its
weekly fights will increase to 105 and its fleet will fly between
Macao and ten other destinations.

firms to help implement China's economic reform programs.
</P>
<P>
Tung made the remarks while meeting Shoichiro Toyoda, chairman
of Japan's Federation of Economic Organizations, locally known as
Keidanren, and other leaders of the Japanese business community.
</P>
<P>
People's lives in the HKSAR have not been changed since its
return to the motherland, Tung noted, adding that they are
confident of the region's future under the "one country, two
systems" principle.
</P>
<P>
He said the HKSAR has accumulated know-how on corporate
management, and hopes Japanese firms could join in the efforts to
deepen the on-going economic reforms in China's inland areas.
</P>
<P>
Having large foreign reserves, Hong Kong's currency will keep
pegging with the U.S. dollar, Tung said.
</P>
<P>
Currency stability is the key to further prosperity of Hong
Kong's economy, Toyoda said, stressing that it is the most
important factor for the business sector.
</P>
<P>
Tung arrived here Wednesday for a three-day visit to Japan, his
first trip to the country as chief executive of the HKSAR.
</P>
<P>
Earlier in the day, Tung also met Japanese Finance Minister
Hiroshi Mitsuzuka and the two sides agreed to further strengthen
their relations to forge a "new partnership."
</P>
<P>
During the 30-minute meeting, Mitsuzuka praised Hong Kong's
stable economic and political situation since its handover to
China.

<HEADLINE> ASEAN Economic Ministers Endorse Agreements to </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SUBANG JAYA, Malaysia, October 16 (Xinhua) -- ASEAN economic
ministers endorsed at their 29th annual meeting here today several
agreements in a move towards liberalizing trade which would
accelerate the achievement of the ASEAN Free Trade Area (AFTA).
</P>
<P>
The 29th ASEAN Economic Ministers (AEM) meeting initialed the
protocol on the Notification Procedure (NP) which requires member
countries to inform each other of any modifications in their AFTA
commitments which might impair or nullify any benefit of the
Common Effective Preferential Tariff (CEPT) scheme to members.
</P>
<P>
The protocol on the NP, which is expected to be signed early
next year when the ministers meet informally, provides that
members must notify each other at least 60 days in advance to any
changes to the measures with acceptance given if the changes were
made because of a "national emergency".
</P>
<P>
The ministers endorsed the first package of offers under the
Framework Agreement on Services on which negotiations started
early last year on seven priority sectors -- financial services,
tourism, telecommunications, construction, business services, air
and maritime transport.
</P>
<P>
The first package of commitments covering mainly the tourism,
maritime and air transport services is scheduled to be implemented
simultaneously by ASEAN members.
</P>
<P>
The liberalization measures in tourism include visa exemption
and waiver of exit taxes which will further facilitate movements
of travelers and tourists within the region.
</P>
<P>
Air and maritime transport services liberalization would
contribute to the ease of movements of goods and smoothen the flow
of sea and air traffic in the region.
</P>
<P>
The negotiations covering the remaining sectors, namely,
financial services, telecommunications, business services and
construction are scheduled to be completed at the end of next
year.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, new members of the regional grouping -- Laos and
Myanmar also signed the protocol of accession to the remaining
agreements in ASEAN which would include their participation in
AFTA and other economic cooperation arrangements in ASEAN.
</P>
<P>
Laos and Myanmar, both admitted into ASEAN in July, have given
assurances that they could meet AFTA commitments in the 10 year
time-frame beginning January 1, 1998.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: Chinese State-Owned Enterprises Enhance Competitiveness (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, October 16 (Xinhua) -- An increasing number of large
State-owned enterprises in China are joining hands to sharpen their
competitive edge in the market.
</P>
<P>
Chinese economists believe the merger as a new channel for
restructuring the assets of the country's State-owned
enterprises. The new approach has aroused great attention amongst
China's economic circles, and State-owned businesses have emerged
as the centerpiece of the country's economic reform.
</P>
<P>
In his report to the 15th National Congress of the Communist
Party of China held recently in Beijing, Chinese President Jiang
Zemin called for the establishment of inter-industrial, inter-regional
and multinational consortia based on the market. Economists say
the merging of strong enterprises is of strategic significance in
promoting the establishment of consortia.
</P>
<P>
A petrochemical group consisting of the Jinlin Petrochemical
Corp., the Yangtze Petrochemical Corp., the Yizheng Chemical Fiber
Corp. and the Nanjing Chemical Industrial Co. was formed in Nanjing,
capital of east China's Jiangsu Province, on August 26.

Pan Yue, deputy director of the State Property
Administration, said the mergers of large enterprises are "an
important method for restructuring assets and an efficient way
to promote development."
</P>
<P>
The achievements made by highly competitive enterprises which
restructured at an early date verify the feasibility of mergers.
</P>
<P>
The total output of the Zhejiang Medical Joint-Stock Corp. Ltd
rose by 16.5 percent in the first half of this year, compared with
the same period of 1996, with its net profits rising by 57
percent. Three interregional industrial and commercial enterprises
merged to form the company.
</P>
<P>
The Jiuzhitang (Group) Corp. Ltd, a venture formed by two major
pharmaceutical manufacturers in central China, recorded total sales
of 300 million yuan in 1996, a 46 percent rise on 1995.
</P>
<P>
Chinese economists note that
mergers and annexations should adhere to principles of the market
economy. They pointed out that behavior based on the demands
of enterprises themselves and laws governing market operations
generate profits.
</P>
<P>
They also noted that cooperation between strong enterprises
should be in line with local conditions.

</P>
<P>
In addition, six major airlines in different localities have
established the Beijing-based Aviation Federation. The China
Eastern Airlines and the China General Airlines are planning to
merge.
</P>
<P>
A common feature of the mergers is that all
the parties involved hope to absorb the advantages of their new
partners and be engaged in mutual promotion efforts.
</P>
<P>
Previously, mergers of State-owned enterprises in China were
based on the concept of "the stronger annexing the weaker", and
were subject to the interference from governments at various
levels. The expanded scale of assets did not necessarily lead to
rising profits.
</P>
<P>
A symposium held in Beijing on October 7 focused on the
restructuring of assets and cooperation between large enterprises.

<HEADLINE> New ADB Fishery Policy Focuses on Sustainability </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, October 16 (Xinhua) -- The Asian Development Bank (ADB)
today approved a new fishery policy which will protect the
Asia-Pacific region's rapidly-declining fishery resources.
</P>
<P>
In a statement issued here today, the bank said that its new
fishery policy focuses on equity, efficiency and sustainability.
</P>
<P>
"From now on, the ADB will concentrate efforts to protect the
Asian and Pacific region's rapidly declining fishery resources by
helping governments develop policies for long-term sustainable
fishery management and to build up their institutional capability
for resource management," it said.
</P>
<P>
The bank said it will also encourage more private sector
involvement, especially in production, processing and marketing.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, it said, the bank will foster regional cooperation,
especially on matters relating to fish that migrate between
different territorial waters.
</P>
<P>
Because of changing circumstances, the new policy represents a
significant change from the bank's 1979 fishery policy which
emphasized production, the bank said.
</P>
<P>
According to the bank, the new policy will have an important
implication on the type of fishery projects that the bank approves
for its developing member countries.
</P>
<P>
The bank said that overfishing, excessively large fishing
fleets, a high wastage rate in fish caught and extensive
degradation of coral reefs and mangrove forests are the major
causes of the fish depletion crisis facing the Asian and pacific
region.
</P>
<P>
At present, the bank said, nearly 70 percent of the world's
marine stocks need urgent corrective conservation and management
measures.
</P>
<P>
The bank said that another major problem is the considerable
quantity of fish lost after being caught and before reaching the
consumer.
</P>
<P>
"Up to 20 percent is lost through spoilage due to insufficient
care in handling and transport and poor processing, packaging and
storage," it said.
</P>
<P>
The bank added that Asia has the largest fishing fleet which
accounts for 42 percent of the world's gross registered tonnage,
and twice the capacity needed to extract what the oceans can
sustainably produce.

<HEADLINE> Private Enterprise Helps Salvage State Ones </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CHENGDU, October 16 (Xinhua) -- Xiwang Group, one of the
largest private enterprises in China's inland areas, has helped
turn around more than 40 money-losing State-run enterprises.
</P>
<P>
The Chengdu-based group, founded by four Liu brothers and a
major fodder producer in China, produces 2.5 million tons a year,
accounting for 5.4 percent of the national output.
</P>
<P>
One of the State firms salvaged by Xiwang is the Bengbu Fodder
Company in Anhui Province, which had lost 1.5 million yuan
(180,720 U.S. dollars) since 1990.
</P>
<P>
In 1994, Xiwang injected technology, trademarks and funds
worth 6 million yuan to form a joint venture with Bengbu. In two
years, the venture turned out pre-tax profits of 12.7 million
yuan.
</P>
<P>
Another money-losing fodder producer in Wuhan, Hubei Province, was
able to turn out a profit of 740,000 yuan in the first month after
signing a co-op agreement with Xiwang.
</P>
<P>
"The convening of the 15th National Congress of the Communist
Party of China has provided us with new opportunities for further
development," said Liu Yonghao, the Xiwang's general manager.

<HEADLINE> Sassou's Militia Control Pointe-Noire </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, October 16 (Xinhua) -- Forces loyal to Former
Congolese President Sassou Nguesso are reported to have
controlled the oil town Point-Noire in Congo, Kenya's newspaper
Daily Nation reported today.
</P>
<P>
A diplomat in Pointe-Noire said that pro-Sassou Angolan troops
with tanks had entered the oil-producing town after dawn and
foreign residents there reported looting.
</P>
<P>
"We control the center of the town and we are heading toward
the outskirts where there is some resistance," Isidore Mvouba,
the spokesman of Sassou, claimed.
</P>
<P>
Radio France International quoted the top President Pascal
Lissouba's commander in Point-Noire as saying that he had ordered
his men to surrender, since they lacked the means to defend
themselves against the Angolans.
</P>
<P>
A diplomat reported that Angolan troops have been in the town
since 6 a.m.
</P>
<P>
The radio said that Lissouba's forces had been placed on
evacuation standby following the reports of looting in
Pointe-Noire, which is home to 1,600 foreign nationals, most of
them French.
</P>
<P>
Sassou's camp also proclaimed victory in the battle for the
capital. Mvouba told Reuters that they had totally controlled the
city of Brazzaville.
</P>
<P>
Sassou's militiaa have reached the bridge at Djoue on the south
fringe of Brazzaville and its capture would indicate the whole
capital is now under Sassou's control.
</P>
<P>
Reports say Sassou's militia gained the upper hand in
Brazzaville yesterday, capturing Lissouba's presidential palace.
Earlier they took the airport that had been held by Lissouba's
forces for most of the four-month power struggle.
</P>
<P>
Even though, according to Reuters, Lissouba insisted that he
still regarded himself as the legitimate Head of State.
</P>
<P>
"I can only regard myself as president, since I have not seen
in front of me any successor, elected democratically as I was,"
Lissouba told Radio France in a telephone interview today from an
undisclosed hideout.
</P>
<P>
The whereabouts of Lissouba were not clear.
</P>
<P>
About 800,000 civilian population have fled the capital of
Congo Brazzaville since fighting broke out in June between forces
of Lissouba and those of his rival Sassou. More than 4,000 people
in the city are reported to have been killed.
</P>
<P>
Point-Noire is close to President Lissouba's southern
power basecally and the Angolan enclave of Cabinda, separated from the
main part of former Zaire. It was former French colony's
Atlantic port city.

<HEADLINE> New Fodder Crop Set to Revolutionize Zero-Grazing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, October 16 (Xinhua) -- A crop scientist at Nairobi
University has developed an improved indigenous variety of the
three-leafed clover plant that will revolutionize the country's
dairy industry, the Daily Nation newspaper reported today.
</P>
<P>
The new clover, developed by Prof. Levi Akundabweni, is a
fast-growing, high yielding, protein-rich and disease/pest-free
fodder crop that will replace protein supplement in zero-grazing
enterprises, said the report.
</P>
<P>
Two small-scale dairy farmers from Githunguri who attended the
unveiling of the new forage recently said the clover would ease
their animal feed problems.
</P>
<P>
"What we have been shown will help us a lot because feeding
cattle in a zero-grazing setup is difficult. If the clover is to
be used with nappier grass, which we thought was the best, it
will be very useful for small-scale enterprises," a farmer said.
</P>
<P>
All parts of the new clover variety, Trifolium quartinanium
which matures in 120 to 130 days, were found to be highly
digestible without any side-effects, said Akundabweni.
</P>
<P>
The purple-flowered stemmy variety of the African Clover which
grows to knee-height "is without any bloat-causing and
cyanogenetic factors," he noted.
</P>
<P>
He added the results of feed trials undertaken in Ethiopia,
where his studies on the plant were initiated, indicated that
Trifolium quartinanium presented "no obvious problems" in cattle.
</P>
<P>
Of some 1,000 strains of the clover plant collected from the
wild, Trifolium quartinanium, with its leafy palatable stems
showed the greatest promise under cultivation as an annual
fodder-bank crop, as well as a soil cover crop in fallow areas.
</P>
<P>
With 10 kilograms of seeds, and under optimal experimental
conditions, the scientist harvested some 10 to 15 tons (fresh
weight) of the plant which upon drying came to six to seven tons
of dry matter per hectare.
</P>
<P>
With this kind of bulk, the professor claimed a farmer would
not only benefit from the nutritional value of the new crop but
also considerably save on the amount of nappier grass with that
he feeds cow every day.
</P>
<P>
High-producing dairy breeds consume up to 15 kilograms of
nappier grass to produce eight liters of milk per day.
</P>
<P>
Even sheep what were fed on dry crop residues such as maize
stover mixed with the clover recorded live weight gains four to
five times more than those fed on the crop residues alone, said
the scientist.
</P>
<P>
In a mixed-farming enterprise, the farmer will also save on
nitrogen fertilizers because this leguminous forage fixes
nitrogen into the soil via its root nodules, he added.

to make health service affordable and accessible to all
Nigerians. He expressed the hope that the scheme will greatly
accelerate the drive toward "health for all by the year 2000 and
beyond".
</P>
<P>
He pledged the government's commitment to the success of the
scheme, saying that both the federal and state governments will
provide take-off grants for the scheme and that an enabling
decree will be soon promulgated.
</P>
<P>
The head of state promised maximum autonomy for the scheme and
said that private sectors will be encouraged to take part in it.
</P>
<P>
The establishment of the NHIS has been in discussion since
1962, however, several attempts to launch it has failed at the
last minute.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, soaring costs of medical services are depriving
more and more people of the accesses to basic health services.
There have been many reports of patients being denied treatment
for failing to pay huge deposits.
</P>
<P>
According to media reports, eight states, namely, Borno,
Kaduna, Rivers, Enugu, Kano, Ogun, Plateau, Lagos and Abuja, the
Federal Capital Territory will pilot the NHIS.
</P>
<P>
All civil servants, the police, armed forces and employees of
organizations with more than 10 employees will be involved in the
first phase of the scheme, Health Minister Ihechukwu Madubuike
said at the launching ceremony.
</P>
<P>
According to him, workers will have to pay only 45 (about 0.55
U.S. Dollars) to 464 Naira (about 5.66 Dollars) a month to be
covered by the scheme.

<HEADLINE> Nyerere Urges SADC to Take Part in Africa's </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, October 16 (Xinhua) -- Former Tanzanian
president Julius Nyerere has urged the Southern African
Development Community (SADC) to take part in efforts to stop
regional conflicts.
</P>
<P>
The veteran African politician urged South Africa and other
SADC states to "take serious interest" in allegations that the
army of one of its member countries, Angola, has invaded the
Republic of Congo.
</P>
<P>
Nyerere arrived in South Africa yesterday for a private visit.
</P>
<P>
Local media today quoted Nyerere as saying in an interview
that SADC, currently chaired by President Nelson Mandela, could
not simply say the Congo conflict was "none of our business".
</P>
<P>
He stressed the region can't just ignore that problem. "We are
all saying that Africa should solve Africa's problems. We can't
solve them by ignoring them."
</P>
<P>
He was responding to a question about what the SADC should do
for reports that Angolan forces had captured Congo's important
city of Pointe-Noire, entering the war on the side of rebel
leader Denis Sassou-Nguesso.
</P>
<P>
He said citizens of Africa should not stand back and leave the
resolution of conflicts to the Organization of African Unity
only.
</P>
<P>
Nyerere came out strongly in favor of South Africa playing a
more active role in the continent.
</P>
<P>
The African statesman will launch his Dar es Salaam-based
"Mwalimu Nyerere Foundation" in Johannesburg, which aims to
promote peace, unity and people-centered development in Africa.
</P>
<P>
He is scheduled to hold talks with Mandela and Deputy
President Thabo Mbeki, and to address members of South African
parliament in Cape Town.

<HEADLINE> Overseas Investors Benefit from Changes in Urbanization </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, October 16 (Xinhua) -- With the aim of improving the
process of urbanization, China is to adjusting the growth patterns
to provide more opportunities for overseas investors, People's
Daily Overseas Edition has reported.
</P>
<P>
Urban areas are expected to account for 42.6 percent of the
country's total by 2010, a gain of 16.3 percent from current
figures, a recent report on city planning said.
</P>
<P>
The proportion of metropolis and medium-sized cities has
dropped, and cities in regions in west China are required to
greatly improve their infrastructure.
</P>
<P>
The number of cities increased to 666 in 1996 with the urban
population accounting for 29 percent of the country's total.
</P>
<P>
Statistics show that the Gross Domestic Product (GDP) and
sales volume in cities have accounted for 67.8 percent and 64.4
percent of the country's total respectively.
</P>
<P>
Cities are mainly distributed along China's coastal areas. The
average GDP of large cities is up 86.7 percent over that of
medium-sized cities and 1.5 times the figure for small cities.
</P>
<P>
Major efforts to developing the economy and raising
the GDP of China's cities are necessary to adjust the country's
city distribution, the report said.
</P>
<P>
China's cities, especially those in central and west China,
should improve their infrastructures, such as roads, water and
electricity. The sluggish development of city infrastructures is
due to the shortage of funds, according to the report.
</P>
<P>
Now, foreign investors are allowed to invest in the
construction of highways, schools and hospitals.
</P>
<P>
During the adjustment of urban distribution, more new cities
are appearing, which provide more investment opportunities. Since
the 1980s, China has established special economic zones, bonded
areas and new high-technology development zones.

<HEADLINE> U.S Sanctions Hurt Business Relations: Chevron Official </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, October 16 (Xinhua)-- Amid positive global business
trends, the U.S sanctions against various countries seldom resolve
political concerns, but often hurt the business relationships that
form the bridge for positive interaction on those concerns, a
Chevron official said here today.
</P>
<P>
In a keynote speech at the 15th World Petroleum Congress (WPC),
Kenneth T. Derr, chairman of the board and chief executive officer
of Chevron Corporation, said he hoped more leaders will see that
active business relationships contribute far more to human
progress than sanctions ever could.
</P>
<P>
He made the remarks in his speech titled "Competitive
Imperatives and Critical Challenges for the Global Oil Industry",
which values partnership and cooperation in the sound development
of oil industry as well as the whole global economy.

<HEADLINE> Two Strongwomen Caught of Unfair Behaviors in Doping Tests </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, October 16 (Xinhua) -- Two Chinese strongwomen were
disqualified from the National Games as they were caught of unfair
behaviors in the doping tests, officials of the Games' Organizing
Committee said here on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Under the anti-doping rules of the Chinese State Physical
Culture and Sports Commission (CSPCS), the Games' Competition
Department ruled the two cases as positive tests against the two
women lifters.
</P>
<P>
Jin Chunlan of Ning Xia autonomous region was caught on spot on
Wednesday of submitting her prepared tube of urine after the
competitions in the women's 70-kg class where she finished fifth.
</P>
<P>
And Chen Xiaomin of Guangdong province was also caught of
cheating right-handedly last Saturday prior to her competitions in
the 59-kg category.
</P>
<P>
The CSPCS rules stipulate that those who either refuse for or
have unfair behaviors in the doping tests will be considered as
positive tests.
</P>
<P>
Accordingly, Jin was stripped of her fifth-place finish while
Chen was prevented from competing in the tournament.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese Weightlifting Association will conduct further
investigation into the cases, and will carry out the punishment
measures against those two athletes in accordance with the rules
of the International Weightlifting Federation, the officials said.
</P>
<P>
The officials said all the gold medalists and record-breakers
are eligible for the doping tests while random tests are being
conducted among those top eight finishers in the on-going National
Games.
</P>
<P>
The CSCPC urged all the participating delegations and members
concerned to further enhance the anti-doping campaign with strict
measures to ensure a successful and clean National Games.

<HEADLINE> China's Religious Affairs Are Not Subject to Foreign Domination </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, October 16 (Xinhua) -- China's religious affairs and
religious bodies are not subject to any foreign domination,
according to an official white paper entitled "Freedom of
Religious Belief in China" issued by the Information Office of
the State Council here today.
</P>
<P>
The white paper said that China's religious affairs are handled
by the various religious bodies, their clergy and followers
themselves. China's religious affairs and religious bodies are not
subject to any foreign domination.
</P>
<P>
"The Chinese government supports the management of religious
affairs by the various religions themselves according to the
Constitution and laws," it said.
</P>
<P>
The principle of independence and taking the initiative in their
own hands in the management of churches is a historical choice made
by the Chinese religious believers of their own accord as part of
the Chinese people's struggle against colonialist and imperialist
aggression and enslavement, according to the white paper.
</P>
<P>
It said that following the Opium War of 1840 China declined to
a semi-feudal and semi-colonial country. During this process
Western Protestantism and Catholicism were used by colonialism and
imperialism as a tool for aggression against China, and a number
of Western missionaries played an inglorious part in this.
</P>
<P>
The white paper said that these people participated in the
opium trade and in plotting the Opium War unleashed by Britain
against China. And they also participated in the war of 1900
launched by the allied forces of eight powers against China.
</P>
<P>
They directly took part in plotting and drafting unequal
treaties, they enjoyed extraterritoriality, and were not governed
by China's laws. They strengthened the control of the Western
powers over China on the pretext of "religious cases". They
obstructed and opposed China's struggle against fascism and the
Chinese people's revolution. They adopted a hostile attitude
toward New China and plotted sabotage, the white paper pointed out.
</P>
<P>
Since the founding of New China in 1949, the Chinese
Protestantism and Catholicism have adhered to the principle of
independence and self-management, which has met with assent and
support from the vast majority of believers and enabled the church
and its religious activities to develop soundly, the white paper
said.
</P>
<P>
It added that now the total number of Chinese Christians is 14
times as many as in 1949. Chinese Catholicism has 115 parishes
under the direction of Chinese bishops or priests.
</P>
<P>
While adhering to the principle of independence and self
administration, Chinese religions are active in making exchanges
and contacts with their counterparts all over the world on the
basis of equality and friendship, it said.
</P>
<P>
China is always open to foreign religious organizations and
individuals who are friendly to China, respect China's sovereignty
and Chinese religions' principle of independence and
self-administration. China's Protestantism and Catholicism have
maintained friendly contacts with churches in many countries,
according to the white paper.
</P>
<P>
In February 1991, the China Christian Council officially joined
the World Council of Churches. The Chinese Catholic Church has
sent representatives to attend some international religious
conferences successively, such as the Fifth World Conference on
Religion and Peace and the World Catholic Youth Day. In recent
years, Chinese churches have sent quite a number of students to
study abroad and invited foreign lecturers and scholars to teach
in China's theological seminaries. Friendly international
exchanges are also increasing in the areas of China's Buddhism,
Taoism and Islam, according to the white paper.

<HEADLINE> China Highly Respects Ethnic Minorities' Religious Beliefs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, October 16 (Xinhua) -- The Chinese government has paid
special attention to religious beliefs among enhinic minorities,
according to the White Paper on Freedom of Religious Beliefs in
China issued here today by the Information Office of the State
Council.
</P>
<P>
The White Paper says that while making great efforts to promote
progress in economy, culture, education and other undertakings in
the areas where ethnic minorities live in compact communities, so
as to improve the material and cultural well-being of the broad
masses of the ethnic minorities (including believers in various
religions), the Chinese government pays special attention to their
religious beliefs and the protection of their cultural heritages.
</P>
<P>
Special programs have been carried out to survey, collect,
classify, study and publish the cultural heritages, including
religious cultures, and folk arts of all the ethnic groups.
</P>
<P>
In addition, the State has made huge investments in the
maintenance and reconstruction of temples, mosques and other
religious facilities of important historical and cultural value in
ethnic-minority areas.
</P>
<P>
The White Paper points out that China is a united country of
many ethnic groups. The Chinese government pursues a policy of
equality, unity and mutual assistance among all the ethnic groups,
respects and protects the right to freedom of religious belief and
the folk customs of the ethnic minorities.
</P>
<P>
The Law of the People's Republic of China on National Regional
Autonomy stipulates: ``Organs of self-government in ethnic
regional autonomous areas protect the right to freedom of
religious belief of the citizens of all ethnic groups.''
</P>
<P>
The White Paper says that Tibet is one of China's ethnic
autonomous regions, and the Tibetans mostly believe in Tibetan
Buddhism.
</P>
<P>
Since the peaceful liberation of Tibet in 1951, and
particularly since the introduction of the reform and opening
policies in 1979, citizens' right to freedom of religious belief
has been thoroughly carried out in Tibet.
</P>
<P>
Since the 1980s the central government has allocated more than
200 million yuan in special funds for the maintenance and
reconstruction of the famous Potala Palace and the Jokhang,
Tashilhunpo and Samye monasteries.
</P>
<P>
The State has also established special funds to support the
work of compiling and publishing the Tripitaka in the Tibetan
language and other major Tibetan Buddhist classics as well as the
work of establishing the Advanced Buddhism College of Tibetan
Language Family of China in Beijing and the Tibet College of
Buddhism in Lhasa.
</P>
<P>
The White Paper continues that at present, there are in Tibet
over 1,700 places for Buddhist activities and a total of 46,000
resident monks and nuns. Small prayer halls or shrines are
virtually universal in the homes of believers, and pilgrims coming
to Lhasa number well over one million each year.
</P>
<P>
Believers performing Buddhist rituals, and prayer umbrellas and
Mani rocks carved with Buddhist sutras can be found all over the
Tibet Autonomous Region, says the White Paper.
</P>
<P>
It notes that the Chinese government also respects and protects
the Moslems' freedom of religious belief as well as their folk
customs.
</P>
<P>
The departments concerned in the government have provided
special pilgrimage-related services for Moslem pilgrims, to the
acclaim of the latter. Since the 1980s the number of Chinese
Moslems going to Mecca on pilgrimages has exceeded 40,000.
</P>
<P>
In the Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region alone, there are now
more than 23,000 mosques, with 29,000 clergymen, having thus met
the needs of believers' religious life.
</P>
<P>
It says that out of full consideration for the dietary habits
and funeral rites of those ethnic-minority people who believe in
Islam, the Chinese government has enacted regulations on the
production of halal food and opened Moslems-only cemeteries.
</P>
<P>
In recent years Chinese judicial organs have provided legal
protection for the lawful rights of the Moslems. Some cases
concerning publications badly hurting the religious feelings of
the Moslems have been handled according to law, says the White
Paper.

<HEADLINE> China Opposes Attempts to Split China by Using Religious Fanaticism </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, October 16 (Xinhua) -- The Chinese government
resolutely opposes attempts to split the country along ethnic
lines, and any use of religious fanaticism to divide the people,
split the country or harm the unity among all ethnic groups, an
official white paper said.
</P>
<P>
According to the white paper entitled "Freedom to Religious
Belief in China", which was issued by the Information Office of
the State Council today, the Chinese government resolutely opposes
any illegal activities and terrorist actions under the signboard
of religion.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the white paper said, the Chinese government firmly
upholds national unity and social stability in areas where ethnic
minorities live in compact communities, and safeguards the normal
religious activities of the ethnic-minority believers.
</P>
<P>
It added that the Chinese government respects the generally
accepted principles regarding religious faiths in the
international community, and holds that these principles must be
applied in accordance with the concrete conditions and be carried
out according to the domestic law of each country.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese government opposes creating confrontations in
religion or interfering in the internal affairs of another country
under the pretext of religion, according to the white paper.

<P>
SEOUL, October 16 (Xinhua) -- Alarmed by recent corporate
bankruptcies and failures, South Korea's 30 top business groups
are vigorously pushing restructuring and managerial reforms.
</P>
<P>
The efforts, said the Fair Trade Commission (FTC), are focused
on disposal of unprofitable units, intersubsidiary mergers, real
estate sell-offs, and entry into state-of-the-art and high
value-added fields.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, management reforms undertaken by these groups
include freezing wages, streamlining organizations, improving
productivity and cutting costs, the FTC said in a report.
</P>
<P>
The biggest conglomerates, said an FTC official, "are waking up
to the need to improve their corporate health, particularly in
this rapidly changing business environment at home and abroad."
</P>

The content of managerial reforms differs, depending on the

SEOUL, October 16 (Xinhua) -- Alarmed by recent corporate
bankruptcies and failures, South Korea's 30 top business groups
are vigorously pushing restructuring and managerial reforms.
</P>
<P>
The efforts, said the Fair Trade Commission (FTC), are focused
on disposal of unprofitable units, intersubsidiary mergers, real
estate sell-offs, and entry into state-of-the-art and high
value-added fields.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, management reforms undertaken by these groups
include freezing wages, streamlining organizations, improving
productivity and cutting costs, the FTC said in a report.
</P>
<P>
The biggest conglomerates, said an FTC official, "are waking up
to the need to improve their corporate health, particularly in
this rapidly changing business environment at home and abroad."
</P>
<P>
The content of managerial reforms differs, depending on the
size of the conglomerate, he said.
</P>
<P>
The top 15 conglomerates, while paying attention to disposal of
unprofitable business lines, cost reduction and other conventional
restructuring methods, tend to give top priority to expansion into
state-of-the-art and high value-added fields, such as
semiconductors, telecommunications and aerospace.
</P>
<P>
In contrast, the "minor" groups, ranked between 16th and 30th
in the corporate hierarchy, are trying to improve their financial
structure through various cost reduction measures and
concentrating investments in a few key strategic fields.
</P>
<P>
The FTC report said the Hyundai Group will increase technology
investments by 10 percent and reduce costs by 10 percent annually,
while the Samsung Group will scale down its planned investments
from 70 trillion won (about 77.8 billion U.S. dollars) to 40
trillion won (44.4 billion dollars) by 2000 and cut costs by 30
percent over the next three years.
</P>
<P>
The LG Group's restructuring drive calls for pumping about 23
trillion won (25.6 billion dollars) into the telecom sector and
production of next-generation chips by 2000.
</P>
<P>
The Daewoo Group intends to suspend acquisition of new real
estate, while the Sunkyong Group has merged seven subsidiaries and
is planning to liquidate two loss-making units.
</P>
<P>
The ongoing restructuring moves is likely to help boost the
slow economy as well as the competitivenesses of the conglomerates
in the second half of 1998, said the FTC report.

<HEADLINE> Boeing to Expand Cooperation with China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, October 16 (Xinhua) -- Michael Zimmerman, president of
Boeing China Inc., expressed confidence recently that his company
would be China's partner in the country's next major aircraft
manufacturing project.
</P>
<P>
Boeing suffered two setbacks in China. In the 1980s, Boeing
lost out to McDonnell Douglas Corp. in the competition for China's
trunk line aircraft project, and in the 1990s it lost a bid for
China's 100-seat aircraft plan to the European manufacturer of the
Airbus.
</P>
<P>
"In spite of the failures, Boeing has never lost its confidence
in the Chinese market," Zimmerman said. Boeing, which merged last
year with McDonnell Douglas, will carry out the contracts the two
companies had signed with China and attempt to increase market
share.
</P>
<P>
Zimmerman said Boeing plans to bring more technology, personnel
resources and funds into China, the second largest aviation
market in the world.
</P>
<P>
In an interview with Xinhua prior to Chinese President Jiang
Zemin's visit to the United States, Zimmerman said that Boeing has
been working on Sino-US relations for years, including launching a
grassroots movement to persuade U.S. legislators to grant China
the most-favored-nation trade status.
</P>
<P>
Zimmerman said good political ties will spur two-way trade, and
that setbacks and difficulties in bilateral relations would
adversely affect economic cooperation. He said Sino-U.S. ties
appear to be improving after many ups and downs.
</P>
<P>
President Jiang's U.S. visit will be important for the
development of political and economic ties between the two
countries, he said.
</P>
<P>
To show Boeing's confidence in China, the firm made its first
direct investment in China this year when it poured 11 million
U.S. dollars into an aircraft maintenance joint venture in Xiamen.
</P>
<P>
"This is Boeing's first step of direct investment in China,"
said Jiande Chen, director of public affairs of Boeing China. "The
step will be larger in the future."
</P>
<P>
Boeing signed its first contracts with China for processing
aircraft components in the early 1970s. Now, more than 2,000
Boeing aircraft are equipped with parts built in
China, including vertical fins, horizontal stabilizers and
trailing edge ribs for the Boeing 737, as well as cargo doors for
the 757.
</P>
<P>
Beginning in 1998, Boeing will cooperate with aircraft
manufacturers in Xi'an, Shenyang and Shanghai to produce more
aircraft parts.
</P>
<P>
"The quality of Chinese products is high and delivery is on
time," Zimmerman said, adding that the good reputation helped
Boeing's partners in China win the opportunity to take part in the
design and manufacture of parts for the next-generation
737.

<HEADLINE> Canadian Ambassador to Israel Returns Following </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, October 16 (Xinhua) -- Canadian ambassador to
Israel David Berger has returned to his post in Tel Aviv after
Israel promised that Israeli intelligence agents would stop
using forged Canadian passports, Israel Radio reported today.
</P>
<P>
Canada recalled Berger on October 4 in protest against the
botched Mossad (Israeli intelligence agency) operation in Amman
in which two Israeli agents, carrying false Canadian passports,
attempted to kill Islamic Resistance Movement (Hamas) political
leader Kahled Mashaal.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the Ben-Gurion airport after his arrival
Wednesday, Berger said that only after his government had
considered the Mashaal affair closely and got promise from
Israel, he was sent back to his post.
</P>
<P>
He also noted that he was satisfied with the assurance from
Israel and he was ready to return to business as usual.
</P>
<P>
Berger's return was attributed by the Canadian Embassy in Tel
Aviv to Israeli Foreign Minister David Levy's assurance that
"steps will be taken to prevent more incidents like the one in
Jordan in the future."
</P>
<P>
Levy's efforts to repair the damage done to the normally
cordial links with Canada began the day after Berger's
departure. He telephoned his Canadian counterpart Lloyd Axworthy
immediately after the incident.
</P>
<P>
Levy also sent a letter to Axworthy, in which he reiterated
his deep regret that the safety of Canadians traveling aboard
may have been compromised by the Mossad action.
</P>
<P>
He assured Axworthy that Israel fully appreciates "the
concern" of the Canadian government and people, saying the
Israeli authorities have taken steps to prevent the recurrence of
such incidents.
</P>
<P>
After Axworthy received Levy's letter last Friday, he
immediately announced that Ambassador David Berger would be sent
back to his post in Tel Aviv.

<HEADLINE> Oil Experts Expect Fast Growth in the Industry </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, October 16 (Xinhua) -- Oil experts at the 15th World
Petroleum Congress (WPC) forecast flat oil prices in real terms
for the next 15 years, and they hope to see oil demand growing to
nearly 100 million barrels a day.
</P>
<P>
In the speech titled "Competitive Imperatives and Critical
Challenges for the Global Oil Industry", Kenneth T. Derr, chairman
of the board and chief executive officer of Chevron Corporation,
noted that "the world is sharing an enormous anticipation for oil
growth".
</P>
<P>
He said that major oil growth is expected worldwide, mainly in
Canada and Kuwait, at Bombai High and in Bakersfield, at Kutubu
and Malongo, around the Persian Gulf and in the Pearl River Mouth
Basin.
</P>
<P>
According to the senior oil official, Venezuela wants to double
its oil production by 2006. Statoil wants to add 200,000 barrels
per day outside Norway by 2005.
</P>
<P>
By the year 2000, Petrobras seeks a 50 percent rise in crude
production and Ecopetrol aims to boost production to one million
barrels per day. Also by 2000, LUK oil plans to invest in new
production at twice today's spending level. Meanwhile, BP wants to
grow production 60 percent in the next 10 years.
</P>
<P>
China has new deals with Kazakhstan, Venezuela and Iraq -- plus
an alliance with Agip, he acknowledged. They are also looking for
onshore growth at home through ventures like the deep exploration
project with Chevron at the Shengli Oilfield in east China.
</P>
<P>
He added that it is right to call China "a new star on the
world oil stage."
</P>
<P>
More than anything else, the world oil industry is more driven,
because it is standing on the threshold of a great expansion, he
said.

<HEADLINE> Badminton Youngesters Urged to Treasure Sports Career </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, October 16 (Xinhua) -- Former badminton king Zhao
Jianhua Wednesday appealed to the young stars to treasure their
sports career by taking every match seriously both at home and
abroad.
</P>
<P>
Zhao, a super star in the late 1980s, paced his native Jiangsu
province to the team title at the ongoing Eighth National Games.
</P>
<P>
The former world champion had been studying in a college and
working as a part-time coach in Singapore after retiring in 1993.
</P>
<P>
He was called up by Jiangsu province to take part in the Eighth
National Games, as a spiritual pillar other than a top shuttler in
the team, which was mainly composed of youngsters.
</P>
<P>
The 33-year-old competed in the men's doubles and team events.
Although he was exhausted and failed to make the finals in
doubles, the vetaran had displayed his never-say-loss nerves in
the fifth-place elimination match.
</P>
<P>
"Although I'm tired and not battling for the title, I treasure
the oppoturnity," he said. "This might be the last chance for me
to compete in the Games as a player."
</P>
<P>
"For a shuttler, his sports career is very short. Please work
hard when you are still young or you would regret for the rest of
your life," he warned the young shuttlers.

<HEADLINE> PM Howard Defends Australia's Asia Policy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, October 16 (Xinhua) -- Australian Prime Minister John
Howard defended today his government's Asia-first policy and
described the Asia-only policy pursued by the former government as
misplaced and shortsighted.
</P>
<P>
Responding to criticism by Melbourne leading businessman Lloyd
Williams of his government's Asia policy, the prime minister said
Williams was wrong.
</P>
<P>
Earlier today, Williams said he wished Paul Keating were still
prime minister as he accused the government of being out of step
in its attitude to Asia.
</P>
<P>
"His claim that we're out of step with Asia is totally wrong,"
Howard was quoted by the Australian Associated Press as telling
journalists in Sydney.
</P>
<P>
"What I think the events in Asia of the last few weeks have
demonstrated is that the Asia-only policy followed by the former
government was misplaced and shortsighted," Howard said.
</P>
<P>
The prime minister was clearly referring to the financial
crisis going on in some Southeast Asian countries, including
Thailand, Indonesia and Malaysia.
</P>
<P>
"We are following an Asia-first policy, we're not following an
Asia-only policy," he said.
</P>
<P>
"Criticism I had of the Keating government's approach to Asia
policy is that it put all of its economic and political eggs in
the Asian basket instead of recognizing the importance of
understanding that we live in a world of different parts and we
have to have economic and political linkages with all parts of the
globe," the prime minister said.
</P>
<P>
Williams was talking to media today after the annual meeting of
a construction company in Melbourne.
</P>
<P>
"I do think Paul Keating had a wonderful vision. I only wish
Paul Keating was here because he would have got rid of the Hanson
factor," Williams said.
</P>
<P>
The Howard government was accused of being late in launching
counterattacks against the anti-Asian immigration views
represented by independent MP Pauline Hanson and her One Nation
Party.
</P>
<P>
"Some of the younger conservatives realize Australia needs to
be embracing Asia. They (the government) have got to get to the
stage of recognizing where their markets are," he said.
</P>
<P>
Asia is Australia's largest overseas market, accounting for
about 60 percent of its total export.

<HEADLINE> China's Northwest Border Area Benefits from Opening-up Policy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
URUMQI, October 16 (Xinhua) -- Nearly 20,000 foreign
traders had visited a frontier market at the Horgas Port and
bought various goods worth 170 million yuan in the first half of
1997.
</P>
<P>
The port, located in the Yili Prefecture of northwest China's
Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region bordering Kazakhstan, has become
a showcase of cross-border trade between China and Central Asian
countries.
</P>
<P>
Before China opened its border area in
1992, the prefecture's trade relations with the outside were
limited. Now it boasts more than 30 million U.S. dollars annually
in foreign trade.
</P>
<P>
The market has been expanded to 1,500 stands which can
accommodate 8,000 people.
</P>
<P>
Traders from Zhejiang Province, east China, sell textile
products worth 200 U.S. dollars annually, along with 1 billion
yuan of household electrical appliances.
</P>
<P>
Booming foreign trade has in turn promoted local economic
growth. The Border Economic Cooperation Zone, set up in
1992, has accounted for 36 million U.S. dollars in exports and
imports.

<HEADLINE> Northeast Asian Countries Plan Transnational Pipeline Project (2) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Ott Victor Logancsvich, Russian vice-minister of fuel and
energy, told local media Wednesday at the WPC that Russia and
China have spent three years on a feasibility study of two
pipelines connecting the two countries.
</P>
<P>
According to Zhang Chengwu, chief representative of the China
National Petroleum Corporation (CNPC) in Moscow, one project is to
link the natural gas fields in Russia's Irkutsk with Rizhao of
east China's Shangdong Province, and will extend to the Republic
of Korea (ROK) and Japan at its final stage.
</P>
<P>
The other pipeline, running from West Siberia to China's
Shanghai via the Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region, is slated to
ease the energy bottleneck in the booming east and southeast areas
of China.
</P>
<P>
When completed, the two projects will pump a maximum of 5
percent of Russia's gas output to the target countries, said one
gas expert.
</P>
<P>
According to sources, Russia and ROK also held bilateral talks
amid Sino-Russian negotiations and reached initial agreements on
sharing gas transmitted from Mongolia and China.
</P>
<P>
Japanese energy authorities and petroleum corporations also
applied to China and Russia to join the program.
</P>
<P>
The whole project, with a combined truck pipeline length of
3,500 kilometers, could cost 8-10 billion U.S. dollars, according
to Chen Jiqing, director of CNPC's Pipeline Bureau.
</P>
<P>
The whole project could take 8-10 years for construction. Upon
completion, the peak transporting capacity could reach 20 billion
cubic meters annually, Chen said, and the pipelines are designed
to last 20 to 30 years.
</P>
<P>
Annual gas demand worldwide should reach 2.5 trillion cubic
meters by the year 2000 and 3 trillion cubic meters by 2010,
compared to 2.2 trillion cubic meters in 1995, according to
official statistics released at the conference.

<P>
BEIJING, October 16 (Xinhua) -- Countries in northeast Asia are
planning to build several transnational pipeline projects linking
the natural gas-rich Russia with Mongolia, China, the Republic of
Korea and Japan, according to sources at the 15th World Petroleum
Congress (WPC) here.
</P>
<P>
According to Gao Tangui, chief engineer of the China Oil and
Gas Pipeline Bureau, Russia's East Siberia, the Far East region
and Sakhalin (Kuye Island) boast abundant natural gas
resources. Experts estimated reserves in the region at 56 trillion
cubic meters, of which 57 percent is in East Siberia and 19
percent in its Far East region.
</P>
<P>
According to a development program mapped out by a Russian
energy research institute, the gas export in the above two regions
could hit 49 billion cubic meters by 2010, becoming a steady gas
supplier for Northeast Asia countries.
</P>
<P>
Economists around the world shared the view that the northeast
Asian countries could provide an economic boost to the global
economy. The rising energy demand and high pressure from
environmentalists may force more countries to increase the use of
clean, energy-efficient gas in their energy consumption and
chemical development.
</P>
<P>
Some experts have predicted that the gas demand in China, Japan
and the Republic of Korea may hit 100 to 150 billion cubic meters
between the year 2000 and 2010.

<HEADLINE> China Ensures Religious Belief in Line with World Conventions: White Paper </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, October 16 (Xinhua) -- The legal protection of
citizens' right to the freedom of religious belief in China is
basically in accordance with the main contents of the concerned
international documents and conventions, according to an official
white paper entitled "Freedom of Religious Belief in China",
issued today by the Information Office of the State Council.
</P>
<P>
The following stipulations in the United Nations Charter, the
Universal Declaration of Human Rights, the International Covenant
on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights, the International
Convenant on Civil and Political Rights, the United Nations

<HEADLINE> White Paper on Relationship between China And Vatican </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, October 16 (Xinhua) -- In the first place, the
relationship between China and the Vatican is one between two
countries. Therefore, only when the relations between the two
countries improve can religious issues be discussed, an official
white paper said today.
</P>
<P>
According to the white paper entitled "Freedom of Religious
Belief in China" which was issued today by the Information Office
of the State Council, the Chinese government has consistently
adhered to a peaceful foreign policy of independence and taking
initiative in its own hands, and is willing to improve the
relations with the Vatican.
</P>
<P>
However, the white paper said, such improvement requires two
basic conditions:
</P>
<P>
First, the Vatican must end its so-called diplomatic relations
with Taiwan and recognize that the government of the People's
Republic of China is the sole legal government in China and that
Taiwan is an inalienable part of China's territory; second, the
Vatican must not interfere in China's internal affairs on the
pretext of religious affairs.
</P>
<P>
The white paper stressed that in the first place, the
relationship between China and the Vatican is one between two
countries. Therefore, only when the relations between the two
countries improve can religious issues be discussed.
</P>
<P>
Whether the relations between China and the Vatican change or
not, the Chinese government will, as always, support Chinese
Catholicism which holds aloft the banner of patriotism, sticks to
the principle of independence and self-management, and stands for
selection and ordination of bishops by itself, the white paper
stressed.

<HEADLINE> 2,000-meter Water Depth Drilling Technology Announced at WPC </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, October 16 (Xinhua) -- The French petroleum engineers
has launched a new-generation of drilling technology at the
2,000-meter-deep sea bottom, and thus lay the foundation for the
technical progress in offshore oil industry in the 21st century.
</P>
<P>
According to a report issued by the French Association of
Professional Petroleum Technicians, the drilling technology,
nicknamed "slim hole," is developed jointly by Forasol-Foramer
Corporation and Elf, one of the global oil producers.
</P>
<P>
By using the technology, offshore oil producers can made a
3,000-meter drilling well in water depth of 2,000 meters or beyond
within 45 days, and can reduce the costs by 46 percent.
</P>
<P>
The "Slim Hole" is expected to overcome the technical
challenges, such as kick detection, kick control, mechanical
behavior of drill-string and rheological behavior of the mud, in
the present offshore oil industry.
</P>
<P>
Industrial analysts said that the technology will be put into
commercial development in oilfield of 2,000-meter water depth by
the year 2000, and will be available to offshore oil projects
2,500 meters below the sea level in 2005.
</P>
<P>
The drilling well built by Petrobras, the state-owned oil
company of Brazil, in Campos Basin this year now keeps the water
depth record of 1,709 meters.
</P>
<P>
Dirk van der Meer, president of WPC, said that the breakthrough
in drilling technology for the deeper water exploration will
expand the width and depth of offshore development of global oil
industry.
</P>
<P>
So far the output of offshore oil accounts for about one third
of the total of the global oil industry. The proportion will
further expand in the next century, according to the president.

<P>
The white paper said that the Chinese government has
promulgated the Regulations on the Administration of Sites for
Religious Activities so as to protect the lawful rights and
interests of such sites. The Regulations specify: Sites for
religious activities shall be run independently by the
administrative organizations thereof, whose lawful rights and
interests and normal religious activities at the sites shall be
protected by law. No organization or individual may violate or
interfere with such rights, interests or activities. Anyone who
encroaches on the lawful rights and interests of the sites for
religious activities shall bear legal responsibilities. Religious
activities conducted at the sites, however, must conform to laws
and regulations.
</P>
<P>
The whiter paper pointed out that the Chinese government has
promulgated the Provisions on the Administration of Religious
Activities of Aliens Within the Territory of the People's Republic
of China. China respects the freedom of religious belief of aliens
within Chinese territory and protects their friendly contacts and
cultural and academic exchanges with Chinese religious circles
with respect to religion. Aliens may participate in religious
activities at recognized sites for religious activities within
Chinese territory. They may also preach at the invitation of
Chinese religious bodies at or above the provincial level. Aliens
may hold religious activities attended by aliens at sites approved
by people's governments at or above the county level. They may
invite Chinese clerical personnel to conduct such religious
rituals as baptisms, weddings, funerals and prayer meetings, and
may bring with them printed religious matter, audio-visual
religious material and other religious articles for personal use
while entering Chinese territory. Aliens who conduct religious
activities within Chinese territory shall abide by Chinese laws
and regulations.

<HEADLINE> Number of Roman Catholics in China Inreases </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, October 16 (Xinhua) -- Fu Tieshan, Vice-Chairman
of the Chinese Patriotic Catholic Association, told Xinhua recently
that there are now 4 million Catholics including 1,200 priests in China.
</P>
<P>
They are active in the country, involved in various activities like
disaster relief work, social services, and international religious
events, Fu said.
</P>
<P>
The 66-year-old bishop said that Catholicism has entered its
golden age in China as a result of the religious policy of the
Communist Party of China (CPC).
</P>
<P>
"The CPC has always attached great importance to protecting and
respecting the freedom in religious beliefs. Since the Third
Plenary Session of the 11th CPC Central Committee in 1978, the
religious policy has had satisfactory results," Fu said.
</P>
<P>
"Communists believe in Marxism and Leninism, we Catholics
believe in God. Differences in beliefs do not hinder our
co-operation and mutual respect," he noted.
</P>
<P>
Fu graduated from a Beijing Catholic college in 1941, and he
has served as bishop of the Beijing parish since 1979.
</P>
<P>
He said that 1,700 people are studying to become priests in 31
monasteries across the country. China now has 115 parishes, 40 of
which have convents with a total of 2,000 nuns.
</P>
<P>
His association is calling on the Catholics in China to
love the country and contribute to it, and to safeguard China's
sovereignty and national unity, he said, adding religions in
China will have an even brighter future after the 15th CPC National
Congress.

<HEADLINE> UK Consortium to Build Container Depot in Bangladesh </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, October 16 (Xinhua) -- Some leading UK-based companies
have formed a consortium recently to construct with private
investment a new container terminal near Chittagong seaport, the
economy lifeline of Bangladesh, informed sources said here today.
</P>
<P>
Port Ventures Limited (PVL), the company set up by the
consortium, has already selected a suitable site at the mouth of
river Karnaphuli to build the terminal with an estimated cost of
300 to 350 million U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
This will be the first private sector container-handling port
in Bangladesh, which is designed with a handling capacity of 0.5
million TEU containers annually by 2010, said a senior official of
the PVL.
</P>
<P>
TEU is abbreviated from tweentyfoot equivalent unit that is a
standard container.
</P>
<P>
He said the feasibility study is expected to be completed by
the end of December this year. PVL will then make a cost
evaluation of the project in order to confirm the private sector
finance and relevant concession from the government for proposal.
</P>
<P>
The detailed engineering design and development would be
completed in 1998 and the construction is expected to commence
early 1999, said the official, adding that the construction of the
project would be completed by the year 2002.
</P>
<P>
By the year of 2005, the new port's capacity will stand at
200,000 to 250,000 TEUs.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Vice-Premier, Exxon CEO Discuss Petrochemical Pact </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, October 16 (Xinhua) -- Revitalizing China's
petrochemical industry is an important step in further opening up
the country's economy, Vice-Premier Wu Bangguo said here today.
</P>
<P>
In a meeting with Lee R. Raymond, chairman and chief executive
officer of Exxon, the U.S. petroleum giant, Wu said the demand for
petrochemical products is on the rise in China. Petrochemical
industry will be one of China's economic pillars because of the
broad prospects for its development.
</P>
<P>
Wu praised Exxon's cooperation with the country's enterprises,
including China Petrochemical Corporation (Sinopec).
</P>
<P>
On October 13, Sinopec signed an agreement with Exxon and
Aramco of Saudi Arabia for a joint feasibility study for a
refinery and petrochemical complex in east China's coastal
province of Fujian which will involve a total investment of three
billion U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
After completing the project, Fujian will become a
10-million-ton refinery center for processing high-sulphur crude
oil with an annual capacity of manufacturing 600,000 tons of
ethylene.
</P>
<P>
Wu said the agreement indicates bilateral cooperation has made
major strides. Exchanges and cooperation between Chinese and
U.S. enterprises are expanding, he said, which helps improve
governmental relations between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
Chinese President Jiang Zemin will soon pay a state visit to
the U.S. at the invitation of his U.S. counterpart, Bill Clinton,
who will visit China next year.
</P>
<P>
"This high-level exchange of visits will serve to further
promote the understanding of the two peoples, and to enhance the
economic cooperation and development of the two nations," Wu said.
</P>
<P>
During the meeting, Raymond said his company is determined to
set up a long-term cooperative relationship with Chinese
enterprises and is confident of making such cooperation successful.
</P>
<P>
Exxon will join Sinopec to set up two more joint ventures in
China: one for lubricant additives in Jinzhou, a city in
northeastern China's Liaoning Province, and the other for
petrochemical carbon 5 resin in Shanghai.
</P>
<P>
These joint ventures will begin this year.
</P>
<P>
Zeng Peiyan, vice-minister of the State Planning Commission,
and some noted figures in China's petroleum sector also were
present at today's meeting.

<HEADLINE> Gov't Doesn't Interfere in Internal Affairs of Religious Groups </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, October 16 (Xinhua) -- China's religious affairs
departments shall not interfere in the internal affairs of
religious organizations and sites, said a white paper entitled
"Freedom of Religious Belief in China", which was issued here
today by the Information Office of the State Council.
</P>
<P>
With respect to administrative guarantee, governments at
different levels have set up religious affairs departments to
administer and supervise the implementation of the laws and
statutes pertaining to religion and to put the policy ensuring the
freedom of religious belief into effect.
</P>
<P>
"These departments shall not interfere in the internal affairs
of religious organizations and sites," the white paper said.
</P>
<P>
In China, religious organizations and sites for religious
activities must register with the government in accordance with
the law, which is the case in some other countries as well.
</P>
<P>
Applications for such registration must meet the following
basic requirements: a permanent site and name; regular attendance;
a management organization composed of adherents to the relevant
religion; clerical personnel for officiating religious activities
or personnel with qualifications stipulated in regulations of
various religions; and management regulations and lawful income.
</P>
<P>
Government departments shall defer the registration or
only approve temporary registration of religious sites which
cannot completely satisfy these basic requirements or have
prominent management problems.
</P>
<P>
Government departments shall not permit the registration of,
for example, sites for religious activities which illegally occupy
land or violate the statutes of city planning, which have been set
up without authorization or which promote superstitious
activities, such as exorcising evil spirits under the pretext of
religious activities.
</P>
<P>
Once a site for religious activities is registered according to
law it has legal status and its lawful rights and interests shall
be protected. If its rights and interests are infringed upon, the
organization in charge of the site is entitled to seek
administrative and legal protection by appealing to the relevant
government organ or taking the case to a people's court.
</P>
<P>
There is no registration requirement for, to quote from Chinese
Christians, ``house services,'' which are mainly attended by
relatives and friends for religious activities such as praying and
Bible reading, the white paper pointed out.

<HEADLINE> Rupee Adjustment to Boost Exports: Pak PM </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, October 16 (Xinhua) -- Pakistani Prime Minister
Nawaz Sharif said here today that the eight percent adjustment in
rupee value would boost exports and improve the overall economic
situation in the country.
</P>
<P>
"Our exports will increase and we will be able to compete in
the international markets," Sharif told reporters this morning at
the Islamabad Airport prior to his departure for Turkmenistan on a
day-long visit.
</P>
<P>
The State Bank of Pakistan on Wednesday adjusted the
dollar-rupee (buying) rate by 8.71 percent from 40.52 rupees to a
U.S. dollar to 44.05 rupees.
</P>
<P>
"It is a timely decision which will benefit the country,"
Sharif said.
</P>
<P>
To a question, Sharif said that the government had given wheat
farmers a much better per acre price for their crop than before to
increase the production.
</P>
<P>
The government is also expecting a good harvest of cotton, rice
and sugarcane, he said.
</P>
<P>
He said the government had decided to extend 90 billion rupees
(about 2.05 billion U.S. dollars) credit to farmers.
</P>
<P>
"This is a bold step which will provide a lot of incentives to
our farmers," he said.
</P>
<P>
In response to a another question, Sharif said that the Swiss
government had frozen the bank accounts of former Pakistani prime
minister Benazir Bhutto and her relatives after the Pakistani
government provided solid evidences.
</P>
<P>
This is for the first time in the history of Pakistan that such
a step has been taken, said Sharif, adding that all the looted
money will be brought back to the national exchequer.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Sharif said the revenue collection targets set by
the Central Board of Revenue had been achieved during the first
quarter of current fiscal year starting from July 1, 1997.

enjoy oil resources for several more centuries, according to noted
experts attending the 15th World Petroleum Congress.
</P>
<P>
Statistics showed that mankind has consumed roughly 500 billion
barrels (80 billion tons of oil), or 85 percent of proven deposits
at in the early in 1973.
</P>
<P>
The discovery of new oilfields has almost doubled the figure
for proven reserves. Experts note that known oil reserves will
last for 44 years in line with the current production capacity.
</P>
<P>
However, reports indicate a continuous rise in global oil
deposits.
</P>
<P>
Expers note the difficulty in accurately projecting the figure
because of large-scale investments required for geological
prospecting, and the fact that earning profits requires many years
of exploration efforts.
</P>
<P>
Scientists recently completed an extensive investigation which
found massive liquefied methane deposits in the earth's permafrost
belt and in the oceans. The scientists estimated said reserves
will last for several hundred years.
</P>
<P>
Major countries are currently planning to drill wells to depths
of ten km in preparation for large-scale development in the next
century.

<HEADLINE> Zambia Not to Privatize Public Media </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, October 16 (Xinhua) -- The Zambian government has said
it will not privatize public media as demanded by a back-bencher,
"Times of Zambia" reported today.
</P>
<P>
Tourism Minister Amusaa Mwanamwambwa told parliament here on
Wednesday that Times of Zambia, Zambia Daily Mail, Zambia
National Broadcasting Corporation (ZNBC), Zambia News Agency
(ZANA) and Zambia Information Service (ZIS) are not for sale.
</P>
<P>
During a heated debate on the proposal by an opposition
parliament member for media liberalization, Mwanamwambwa said,
"it is totally untrue that MMD (the ruling Movement for
Multi-Party Democracy) government ever declared at any time that
the government was going to or intends to sell public owned
media."
</P>
<P>
"Nowhere in the manifesto does it say the MMD would sell the
mass media," he declared.
</P>
<P>
MMD parliament member Sikota Wina said it is imperative for
the government to fund and control the media as it is its last
line of defense.
</P>
<P>
But the opposition parliament member charged that the public
media has persistently given favorable coverage to the ruling MMD
officials while blacking out opposition political parties.
</P>
<P>
He said the state media belong to all as they are funded by
tax payers.

The Chinese government has promulgated the Regulations on the
Administration of Sites for Religious Activities so as to protect
the lawful rights and interests of such sites. It also promulgated
the Provisions on the Administration of Religious Activities of
Aliens Within the Territory of the People's Republic of
China. China respects the freedom of religious belief of aliens
within Chinese territory and protects their friendly contacts and
cultural and academic exchanges with Chinese religious circles
with respect to religion.
</P>
<P>
According to Chinese law, while all citizens enjoy the right to
freedom of religious belief, they must also carry out duties
prescribed by law. In China, all individuals and organizations,
including all religions, must safeguard the people's interests,
the sanctity of the law, ethnic unity and unification of the
nation. This is in conformity with the relevant clauses of the UN
documents and conventions on human rights.
</P>
<P>
Citizens who believe in religion and those who do not believe
in religion are equal before the law. This is a basic requirement
for modern civilization and nations subject to the rule of law.
</P>
<P>
Each country has its own history, culture and national
conditions, which decide that each country's protection of freedom
of religious belief has its own characteristics, the white paper
said.
</P>
<P>
While stressing the protection of freedom of religious belief,
China pays equal attention to the protection of the freedom not to
believe in religion, thus ensuring freedom of religious belief in
a complete sense. This is a more complete and more comprehensive
protection of citizens' basic rights.

<HEADLINE> Northeast China Province Targets Illiteracy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CHANGCHUN, October 16 (Xinhua) -- The young and middle-aged in
northeast China's Jilin Province have made remarkable progress
toward eliminating illiteracy.
</P>
<P>
One provincial official in charge of illiteracy elimination
said that approximately 10,000 people in Jilin are still
illiterate, as against 93,183 in 1993. The literacy rate of the
young and middle-aged in the province tops 99.5 percent, and more
than 95 percent of the rural villages have wiped out illiteracy.
</P>
<P>
The province, after passing the literacy check by the State
Education Commission in late 1993, has expanded its achievements
and raised the quality of life for its rural population. Seventy
percent of its 25.5 million residents are rural in this major
grain-growing area of China.
</P>
<P>
Jilin has been effective in carrying out the nine-year
compulsory education program. The enrolment and graduation rate
of its school-age children remains steady at 99 percent since
1987. Ninety-one percent of the population in Jilin has undergone
the nine-year compulsory education training.
</P>
<P>
Adult education has also received a boost from the literacy
campaign. Schools of culture and technology training have been
established all over Jilin and over 70 percent of the rural work
force in the province have received various forms of training in
these schools.

<P>
Religion should be adapted to the society in which it is
prevalent. This is a universal law for the existence and
development of religion, the white paper said.
</P>
<P>
Now the Chinese people are building China into a modern
socialist country with Chinese characteristics. The Chinese
government advocates that religion should adapt to this
reality. However, such adaptation does not require citizens to
give up religious belief, nor does it require any religion to
change its basic doctrines.
</P>
<P>
Instead, it requires religions to conduct their activities
within the sphere prescribed by law and adapt to social and
cultural progress. This conforms to the fundamental interests of
religious believers as well as to those of the various religions
themselves.
</P>
<P>
Since the 1980s, some pernicious organizations have sprung up
in certain areas of China, which engage in illegal and even
criminal activities under the signboard of religion.
</P>
<P>
The broad masses of the people and personages of the religious
circles detest this phenomenon. It is precisely for the purpose of
safeguarding the public interest and the sanctity of the law and
better protecting the people's right to freedom of religious
belief and normal religious activities that China's judicial
organs punish such kind of law-breakers and criminals who severely
endanger the society and the public interest in accordance with
the law.
</P>
<P>
The punishment of criminals by China's judicial organs in
accordance with the law has nothing to do with religious
belief. No one in China is punished because of his or her
religious belief. But no country that practices the rule of law in
the world today would tolerate illegal and criminal activities
being carried out under the banner of religion, according to the
white paper.
</P>
<P>
With respect to judicial guarantee, China stipulates clearly
the penalties for the infringement of citizens' right to freedom
of religious belief.
</P>
<P>
In recent years the Chinese judiciary, in accordance with the
law, has tried several cases of infringing upon relevant laws of
the state and seriously hurting the religious feelings of certain
believers, and has meted out punishments to persons responsible
for the offenses.
</P>
<P>
With respect to administrative guarantee, governments at
different levels have set up religious affairs departments to
administer and supervise the implementation of the laws and
statutes pertaining to religion and to put the policy ensuring the
freedom of religious belief into effect. These departments shall
not interfere in the internal affairs of religious organizations
and sites.

<TEXT>
<P>
According to the white paper, there are about 17,000 religious
personages who are deputies to people's congresses or members of
political consultative conferences at different levels.
</P>
<P>
On behalf of religious circles they participate in the
discussions of important State and social affairs at the people's
congresses and political consultative conferences, and offer
comments, suggestions and criticisms, or submit proposals and
motions relating to the government's work on religion.
</P>
<P>
China's religious affairs are handled by the various religious
bodies, their clergy and followers themselves. China's religious
affairs and religious bodies are not subject to any foreign
domination. The Chinese government supports the management of
religious affairs by the various religions themselves according to
the Constitution and laws.
</P>
<P>
The white paper stressed that the principle of independence and
taking the initiative in their own hands in the management of
churches is a historical choice made by the Chinese religious
believers of their own accord as part of the Chinese people's
struggle against colonists and imperialist aggression and
enslavement.
</P>
<P>
Following the Opium War of 1840, Western Protestantism and
Catholicism were used by colonialism and imperialism as a tool for
aggression against China, and a number of Western missionaries
played an inglorious part in this.
</P>
<P>
For example, in the 19th century, some Western missionaries
participated in the opium trade and in plotting the Opium War
unleashed by Britain against China. In the war of 1900 launched by
the allied forces of eight powers against China, a number of
Western missionaries served as guides, interpreters and
information officers, took part in the slaughter of Chinese
civilians and the robbing of money and property.
</P>
<P>
In the 19th century, some Western missionaries directly took
part in plotting and drafting unequal treaties, such as the
Sino-British Treaty of Nanking, the Sino-American Treaty of
Wanghsia, the Sino-American and Sino-French treaties of Tientsin
and the Sino-French Convention of Peking.
</P>
<P>
They also enjoyed extraterritoriality, and were not governed by
China's laws. Taking advantage of extraterritoriality some Western
missionaries, backed by the aggressive imperialist forces, went to
inland China to build churches and set up parishes. They forcibly
occupied land, bullied and oppressed Chinese officials and
civilians, and interfered in Chinese judicial authority.
</P>
<P>
Some Western missionaries incurred popular indignation by doing
evil deeds under the protection of the unequal treaties, and
conflicts and disputes between Chinese people and the Western
missionaries broke out.
</P>
<P>
On the pretext of these religious cases the Western powers
imposed military and political pressure on the Chinese
government. They put forward various unreasonable demands,
compelled the Chinese government to pay indemnities, and arrested
and executed innocent people. Moreover, they even launched
wars of aggression on such a pretext.

<HEADLINE> India Calls for Universal Extradition Treaty </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, October 16 (Xinhua) -- Indian Prime Minister Inder
Kumar Gujral called on Wednesday for a universal extradition
treaty and suggested that an internationally acceptable code of
conduct for governments should be evolved to check various crimes
around the world, local press reported today.
</P>
<P>
"The bilateral extradition treaties may not work in the ongoing
globalization of crimes," Gujral told the 66th annual general
assembly session of the International Criminal Police Organization
(Interpol) which opened here on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The prime minister stated that though a universal extradition
treaty could form part of the United Nations agenda, some
international conventions will have to be built to save the
countries from the agonizing negotiations in seeking the
extradition of wanted criminals.
</P>
<P>
Referring to the new forms of corruption taking place at the
international level, Gujral said that money-laundering and other
inter-related crimes in drug-trafficking and arms smuggling had
led to a kind of race between the law-breakers and law enforcing
agencies.
</P>
<P>
White-collared crimes can only be controlled by greater
cooperation among the nations in high-tech crime detection and
speedy communication, Gujral noted.
</P>
<P>
The week-long general assembly session of the Interpol, hosted
by India for the first time, is being attended by over 500
delegates, including interior ministers and top police officers
and investigators from 177 countries.

They obstructed and opposed China's struggle against fascism
and the Chinese people's revolution. They adopted a hostile
attitude toward new China and plotted sabotage. After the founding
of new China in 1949, the Vatican issued papal encyclicals several
times instigating hatred against the new people's political power
among the converts.
</P>
<P>
Western Catholicism and Protestantism also manipulated and
controlled Chinese churches turning them into the appendages to
Western religious orders and mission societies. Under these
circumstances Chinese clergymen and the vast majority of their
followers had no rights.
</P>
<P>
After the founding of the People's Republic of China in 1949,
the Chinese Protestantism and Catholicism have stuck to the
principle of independence and self-management, which has met with
assent and support from the vast majority of believers and enabled
the church and its religious activities to develop soundly.
</P>
<P>
While adhering to the principle of independence and
self-administration, Chinese religions are active in making
exchanges and contacts with their counterparts all over the world
on the basis of equality and friendship.
</P>
<P>
China's Protestantism and Catholicism have maintained friendly
contacts with churches in many countries. Friendly international
exchanges are also increasing in the areas of China's Buddhism,
Taoism and Islam.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese government has consistently adhered to an
independent foreign policy of peace and taking initiative in its
own hands, and is willing to improve the relations with the
Vatican, the white paper said.
</P>
<P>
However, it noted that such improvement requires two basic
conditions: First, the Vatican must end its so-called diplomatic
relations with Taiwan and recognize that the government of the
People's Republic of China is the only legal government in China
and that Taiwan is an inalienable part of China's territory.
</P>
<P>
Second, the Vatican must not interfere in China's internal
affairs on the pretext of religious affairs. In the first place,
the relationship between China and the Vatican is one between two
countries. Therefore, only when the relations between the two
countries improve, can religious issues be discussed.
</P>
<P>
Whether the relations between China and the Vatican change or
not, the Chinese government will, as always, support Chinese
Catholicism which holds aloft the banner of patriotism, sticks to
the principle of independence and self-management, and stands for
selection and ordination of bishops by itself.

China is a united country of many ethnic groups. The Chinese
government pursues a policy of equality, unity and mutual
assistance among all the ethnic groups, respects and protects the
right to freedom of religious belief and the folk customs of the
ethnic minorities, according to the white paper.
</P>
<P>
While making great efforts to promote progress in economy,
culture, education and other undertakings in the areas where
ethnic minorities live in compact communities, so as to improve
the material and cultural well-being of the broad masses of the
ethnic minorities (including believers in various religions), the
Chinese government pays special attention to their religious
beliefs and the protection of their cultural heritages.
</P>
<P>
At present, there are in Tibet over 1,700 places for Buddhist
activities and a total of 46,000 resident monks and nuns. Small
prayer halls or shrines are virtually universal in the homes of
believers, and pilgrims coming to Lhasa number well over one
million each year.
</P>
<P>
Believers performing Buddhist rituals, and prayer umbrellas and
Mani rocks carved with Buddhist sutras can be found all over the
Tibet Autonomous Region. In addition, religious activities during
the annual Sholton Festival and the traditional practice of
circling Mount Kangrinboqe in the Year of the Horse and circling
Lake Namco in the Year of the Sheep along pilgrim paths have been
carried on and respected by society at large.
</P>
<P>
The reincarnation of holy men, or "Living Buddhas," is a unique
form of succession in Tibetan Buddhism which has long been
recognized and respected by the State. In 1992 the Religious
Affairs Bureau of the State Council approved the succession of the
17th Karmapa Living Buddha.
</P>
<P>
In 1995, China successfully concluded the search for and
identification of the reincarnation of the 10th Panchen Lama and
the title-conferring and enthronement of the 11th Panchen Lama
after lot-drawing from a golden urn according to the established
religious rituals and historical conventions of Tibetan Buddhism,
and with the approval of the State Council.
</P>
<P>
These actions won endorsement and support from the converts of
Tibet.

The Chinese government also respects and protects the Moslems'
freedom of religious belief as well as their folk customs. The
departments concerned in the government have provided special
pilgrimage-related services for Moslem pilgrims, to the acclaim of
the latter, the white paper said.
</P>
<P>
Since the 1980s, the number of Chinese Moslems going to Mecca
on pilgrimages has exceeded 40,000. In the Xinjiang Uygur
Autonomous Region alone, there are now more than 23,000 mosques,
with 29,000 clergymen, having thus met the needs of believers'
religious life.
</P>
<P>
Out of full consideration for the dietary habits and funeral
rites of those ethnic-minority people who believe in Islam, the
Chinese government has enacted regulations on the production of
halal food and opened Moslems-only cemeteries.
</P>
<P>
In recent years, Chinese judicial organs have provided legal
protection for the lawful rights of the Moslems. Some cases
concerning publications badly hurting the religious feelings of
the Moslems have been handled according to law.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese government resolutely opposes attempts to split the
country along ethnic lines, and any use of religious fanaticism to
divide the people, split the country or harm the unity among all
ethnic groups or engage in illegal activities and terrorist
actions under the signboard of religion, according to the white
paper.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the Chinese government firmly upholds national unity
and social stability in areas where ethnic minorities live in
compact communities, and safeguards the normal religious
activities of the ethnic-minority believers.
</P>
<P>
The white paper noted that the Chinese government respects the
generally accepted principles regarding religious faiths in the
international community, and holds that these principles must be
applied in accordance with the concrete conditions and be carried
out according to the domestic law of each country.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese government opposes creating confrontations in
religion or interfering in the internal affairs of another country
under the pretext of religion.
</P>
<P>
The facts make it fully clear that remarkable improvements have
been achieved in the situation of human rights of the Chinese
people, and the freedom of religious belief has enjoyed full
respect and legal protection since the founding of new China,
particularly in the recent two decades following the
implementation of the reform and opening-up policies.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese government will, as always, make ever-greater
efforts to safeguard human rights and specifically to protect the
freedom of religious belief, the white paper said.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, October 16 (Xinhua) -- Being a country with a great
diversity of religious beliefs, China has over 100 million
followers of various religious faiths, said an official white
paper which was issued here today.
</P>
<P>
According to the White Paper entitled "Freedom of Religious
Belief in China", issued by the Information Office of the State
Council, the main religions are Buddhism, Taoism, Islam,
Catholicism and Protestantism.
</P>
<P>
Citizens of China may freely choose and express their religious
beliefs, and make clear their religious affiliations. Statistics
show that there are over 85,000 sites for religious activities,
some 300,000 clergy and over 3,000 religious organizations
throughout China.
</P>
<P>
In addition, there are 74 religious schools and colleges run by
religious organizations for training clerical personnel.
</P>
<P>
There are about 200,000 Buddhist monks and nuns, more than
25,000 Taoist priests and nuns, four million Catholics, 4,000
clergy of Catholicism, about ten million Protestants and more than
18,000 clergy of Protestantism.
</P>
<P>
Islam is the religion of people belonging to Hui and Uygur
ethnic minorities with a total population of 18 million, and there
are more than 40,000 Imams and Akhunds.
</P>
<P>
China has the following national religious organizations:
Buddhist Association of China, Taoist Association of China,
Islamic Association of China, Chinese Patriotic Catholic
Association, Chinese Catholic Bishops' College, Three-Self
Patriotic Movement Committee of the Protestant Churches of China,
and China Christian Council.
</P>
<P>
Religious leaders and leading organs of the various religious
bodies are selected and ordained in accordance with their own
regulations, according to the white paper.
</P>
<P>
Since the 1980s, approximately 600 Protestant churches have
been reopened or newly built each year in China. By the end of
1996, a total of more than 18 million copies of the Bible had been
re-printed and distributed, with special tax exemption treatment
speeding their publication, the white paper said.
</P>
<P>
In addition, more than eight million copies of a hymn book
have been published and distributed by the China Christian Council
since 1983. From 1958 to 1995, a total of 126 Catholic bishops
were selected and ordained by the Chinese Catholic church itself.
</P>
<P>
In the past dozen years, more than 900 young Catholic priests
have been trained and consecrated by Chinese Catholicism. More
than 3,000 Protestants attend the Sunday service at Chongwenmen
church in Beijing each week.
</P>
<P>
The Beijing Nantang Catholic Cathedral observes Mass four times
each week with an attendance of more than 2,000. Of these, one
Mass is held in English specially for foreigners in Beijing.
</P>
<P>
The white paper noted that in China all religions have equal
status and coexist in tranquillity. Religious disputes are
unknown in China. Religious believers and non-believers respect
each other, are united and have a harmonious relationship.
</P>
<P>
This shows, on the one hand, the influence of traditional
Chinese compatibility and tolerance, and, on the other, the fact
that since the founding of the People's Republic of China in 1949
the Chinese government has formulated and carried out the policy
of freedom of religious belief and established a politico-religious
relationship that conforms to China's national conditions, the
white paper said.

BEIJING, October 16 (Xinhua) -- China pays equal attention to
the protection of the freedom not to believe in religion while
stressing the protection of freedom of religious belief, according
to the White Paper entitled "Freedom of Religious Belief in
China", which was issued today by the Information Office of the
State Council.
</P>
<P>
Each country has its own history, culture and national
conditions, which decide that each country's protection of freedom
of religious belief has its own characteristics. While stressing
the protection of freedom of religious belief, China pays equal
attention to the protection of the freedom not to believe in
religion, thus ensuring freedom of religious belief in a complete
sense. This is a more complete and more comprehensive protection
of citizens' basic rights, the white paper said.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese government maintains that religious belief is a
citizen's personal affair. However, the construction of a
prosperous, powerful, democratic modern socialist country with
advanced culture, and the safeguarding of the country's
sovereignty and national dignity are the common goals and in the
fundamental interest of Chinese people of all ethnic groups,
including those who believe in a religion and those who do not.
</P>
<P>
Therefore, the people who believe in a religion and those who
do not can unite and cooperate politically, and respect each
other's beliefs, the white paper said.
</P>
<P>
Religion should be adapted to the society in which it is
prevalent. This is a universal law for the existence and
development of religion. Now the Chinese people are building
China into a modern socialist country with Chinese
characteristics. The Chinese government advocates that religion
should adapt to this reality.
</P>
<P>
However, such adaptation does not require citizens to give up
religious belief, nor does it require any religion to change its
basic doctrines. Instead, it requires religions to conduct their
activities within the sphere prescribed by law and adapt to social
and cultural progress. This conforms to the fundamental interests
of religious believers as well as to those of the various
religions themselves, the white paper stressed.

<HEADLINE> None in China Punished Because of Religious Belief: White Paper </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, October 16 (Xinhua) -- The punishment of criminals by
China's judicial organs has nothing to do with religious belief,
and no one in China is punished because of his or her religious
belief, an official white paper said today.
</P>
<P>
The White Paper entitled "Freedom of Religious Belief in China"
was issued today by the Information Office of the State Council,
said that since the 1980s, some pernicious organizations have
sprung up in certain areas of China, which are engaged in illegal
and even criminal activities under the religious signboard.
</P>
<P>
Some of the heads of these pseudo-religions distort religious
doctrines, create heresies, deceive the masses, refuse to obey the
State's laws and decrees, and incite people to overthrow the
government. Some pretend to be supernatural beings, and have
killed or injured people; others organize promiscuity, or defraud
people of money or property. They are a serious danger to the
normal life and productive activities of the people, according to
the white paper.
</P>
<P>
"The broad masses of the people and personages of the religious
circles detest this phenomenon," the white paper said.
</P>
<P>
In order to safeguard the public interest and the sanctity of
the law, and to better protect the people's right to freedom of
religious belief and normal religious activities, China's judicial
organs punish law-breakers and criminals who severely endanger the
society and the public interest in accordance with the law, said
the white paper.
</P>
<P>
The punishment of criminals by China's judicial organs has
nothing to do with religious belief, and no one in China is
punished because of his or her religious belief.
</P>
<P>
"No country that practices the rule of law in the world today
would tolerate illegal and criminal activities being carried out
under the banner of religion," the white paper said.

<TEXT>
<P>
SHENYANG, October 16 (Xinhua) -- An automatic device for
locating and extinguishing fires has been developed in Northeast
China's Liaoning Province.
</P>
<P>
The device, produced by the Liaoning Branch of the China Fire
Control Society, can locate a fire after three seconds of scanning
and spray the blaze until it is extinguished.
</P>
<P>
Compared with present automatic fire-control systems in use
worldwide, the device is not only water-saving but also can spray
all around, experts say.
</P>
<P>
A logic control system allows the device to distinguish fire
from sunlight, lamps, photography flashes and lighters. It can be
easily linked to fire hydrant networks and other water networks.
</P>
<P>
In addition, it costs only one third of current fire-control
devices.

<HEADLINE> China Issues White Paper on Freedom of Religious Belief (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, October 16 (Xinhua) -- The Information Office of the
State Council today issued a White Paper on Freedom of Religious
Belief in China, which indicates with large quantities of facts
that the freedom of religious belief of the Chinese people has
been well respected and protected since the founding of the
People's Republic of China in 1949, particularly in the recent two
decades following the implementation of the reform and opening-up
policies.
</P>
<P>
The white paper, with more than 10,000 Chinese characters,
consists of five parts: The Present Conditions of Religion in
China, Legal Protection of the Freedom of Religious Belief,
Judicial and Administrative Guarantees and Supervision of the
Freedom of Religious Belief, Support for Independence and
Initiative in Management of Religious Affairs, and Protection of
the Right to Freedom of Religious Belief for Ethnic Minorities.
</P>
<P>
According to the white paper, China is a country with a great
diversity of religious beliefs. The main religions are Buddhism,
Taoism, Islam, Catholicism and Protestantism. Citizens of China
may freely choose and express their religious beliefs, and make
clear their religious affiliations.
</P>
<P>
Statistics show that there are over 100 million followers of
various religious faiths, more than 85,000 sites for religious
activities, and over 3,000 religious organizations throughout
China. In addition, there are 74 religious schools and colleges
run by religious organizations for training clerical personnel.
</P>
<P>
Among the 300,000 clergy in China, there are some 200,000
Buddhist monks and nuns, more than 25,000 Taoist priests and nuns,
over 40,000 Imams and Akhunds, 4,000 clergy of Catholicism, and
more than 18,000 clergy of Protestantism, the white paper said.

<TEXT>
<P>
Religious organizations in China run their own affairs
independently and set up religious schools, publish religious
classics and periodicals, and run social services according to
their own needs. As in many other countries, China practices the
principle of separating religion from education; religion is not a
subject taught in schools of the popular education in China,
although some institutions of higher learning and research
institutes do teach or conduct research into religion, the white
paper said.
</P>
<P>
The various religious schools and institutes set up by the
different religious organizations teach religious knowledge in
line with their own needs.
</P>
<P>
All normal clerical activities conducted by the clergy and all
normal religious activities held either at sites for religious
activities or in believers' own homes in accordance with usual
religious practices are protected by law as the affairs of
religious bodies and believers themselves.
</P>
<P>
The white paper said that in the course of the country's long
history, the various religions in China have become part of the
traditional Chinese thinking and culture. It is traditional for
Chinese religious believers to love their country and religions.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese government supports and encourages the religious
circles to unite the religious believers to actively participate
in the construction of the country.

<TEXT>
<P>
In China, all religions have equal status and coexist in
tranquillity. Religious disputes are unknown in China. Religious
believers and nonbelievers respect each other, are united and have
a harmonious relationship.
</P>
<P>
This shows, on the one hand, the influence of traditional
Chinese compatibility and tolerance, and, on the other, the fact
that since the founding of the People's Republic of China in 1949
the Chinese government has formulated and carried out the policy
of freedom of religious belief and established a
politico-religious relationship that conforms to China's national
conditions.
</P>
<P>
According to the white paper, Chinese citizens' right to the
freedom of religious belief is protected by the Constitution and
laws.
</P>
<P>
In the Constitution of the People's Republic of China, freedom
of religious belief is a basic right enjoyed by all citizens.
Article 36 of the Constitution stipulates, "Citizens of the
People's Republic of China enjoy freedom of religious belief." It
also goes on to say, "No State organ, public organization or
individual may compel citizens to believe in, or not to believe
in, any religion; nor may they discriminate against citizens who
believe in, or do not believe in, any religion." Again, "the State
protects normal religious activities," and "No one may make use of
religion to engage in activities that disrupt public order, impair
the health of citizens or interfere with the educational system of
the State." In addition, "Religious bodies and religious affairs
are not subject to any foreign domination."
</P>
<P>
China's Law on National Regional Autonomy, General Principles
of the Civil Law, Education Law, Labor Law, Compulsory Education
Law, Electoral Law of the People's Congresses, Organic Law of the
Villagers' Committees, Advertisement Law, and other laws stipulate
that all citizens, regardless of their religious beliefs, have the
right to vote and stand for election; the legitimate property of
religious bodies is subject to legal protection; education is
separate from religion, and all citizens, regardless of their
religious beliefs, enjoy equal educational opportunities in
accordance with the law; the people of all ethnic groups should
respect each other's languages, customs and habits, and religious
beliefs; citizens shall not be discriminated against in terms of
employment because of different religious beliefs; and no
advertisements or trade marks shall include discriminatory
contents against any ethnic group or religion.

<HEADLINE> Ma Junren Clouds Legendary Ego in National Games </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, October 16 (Xinhua) -- Ma Junren, a controversial
coach with world record-breaking protegees years ago, has a
legendary model to follow at the on-going Eighth National Games --
Ma Junren himself.
</P>
<P>
Four years ago, Ma orchestrated his "Ma's Family" to stun the
world with three world records in Beijing, vaulting China to an
athletics giant overnight.
</P>
<P>
Such a happy hunting ground is unlikely to be resurrected this
time in Shanghai where he himself was echoing a down-noted message
about his newly-recruited disciples as the track competitions
which will unveil on Friday.
</P>
<P>
"No miracle will be created before the 2000 Olympic Games," Ma
said, joking that "I am not in charge of coaching the athletes.
I'm only a chef and driver here."
</P>
<P>
Last November, he gave up full-time coaching due to poor
health. But nobody is to believe his funny words except those
dumb fools.
</P>
<P>
Admist smoking screens, the mysterious coach eventually shew up
at the Shanghai Stadium along with his 31 proteges and four
assistant coaches.
</P>
<P>
Hiding away from the star-rated hotel designated by the Games's
Organizing Committee, Ma himself booked a small and unknown hotel
in a corner of Shanghai instead, signalling to the press that he
has be fed up with the spotlight.
</P>
<P>
In 1993, Wang Junxia, Qu Yunxia and Liu Dong whipped up an
Oriental storm in the World Athletics Championships in Stuttgart
by winning three gold medals in the middle and long-distances
finals.
</P>
<P>
One year later, the Ma's Family created a more surprising feat
in the Seventh National Games, stomping three world records, and
made a clean sweep of the top four places in the Spain marathon.
</P>
<P>
The gust of the Ma's protegees made the world aghast as the
track competitions became meaningless to their opponents of other
countries.
</P>
<P>
Without any doubt, the aurae of the Ma dynasty will last for one
decade at least.
</P>
<P>
But the world is like the pot mixed with joy and sorrow. When
all a-growing and a-blowing, Ma Junren was plunged into his worst
moments after Wang Junxia and Qu Yunxia shedded their last shines
under his charge in the Hiroshima Asian Games in 1994.
</P>
<P>
Wang, his most glittering star disciple and Jesse Owens Award
winner, broke away from Ma Junren with Liu Dong, declaring the
break-down the Ma's Family as the coach was reportedly refused to
give them the Mercedes Benz cars, which they won as gifts from the
Stuttgart Worlds. The two found a new coach Mao Dezhen.
</P>
<P>
Ma lamented that Wang and Liu had put a brake upon his efforts
to train younger runners. "They should have stayed in the camp
for themselves and for the younger runners as well, but they
choosed to go away. There was nothing I could do."
</P>
<P>
Misfortunes knocked ajar the door of coach Ma Junren further as
he was hospitalized for months after a car accident and an ailment
to his kidneys.
</P>
<P>
However, Ma remains as a man of stamina. Against the doubts
upon his prospect, he began to recamp the Ma Family with many a
teenage runners.
</P>
<P>
"I am setting my sights upon the 2000 Olympic Games and I'm
confident that my girls will be good enough to create miracles in
Sydney."
</P>
<P>
To prepare for the National Games, Ma led his 31 disciples to
the Duoba Center in Qinghai province for altitude trainning, the
ninth time he visited the camp before major competitions.
</P>
<P>
He shut his door closed all the time to the reporters as his
proteges trained from early morning to late night.
</P>
<P>
On February 26, the 52-year-old coach toured to Hong Kong for
the first race for his athletes after the 1994 Asian Games, saying
"my health is only Ok."
</P>
<P>
His new recruits Yin Lili and Wang Xiaoxia won the women's King
of the Road race in Hong Kong as expected.
</P>
<P>
Coach Ma is full of confidence that a new generation of long
distance runners is maturing in China as other provinces are
learning his training tactics.
</P>
<P>
"China will cherish its new champions at the 2000 Olympics in
Sydney," he vowed.

<HEADLINE> Dhaka's Revenue Short of Target in 1st Quarter </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, October 16 (Xinhua) -- The revenue collection of the
Bangladesh government during the first quarter of the 1997-98
fiscal year stood at 30.78 billion taka (about 690 million U.S.
dollars), 2.2 billion taka (about 50 million dollars) behind the
target.
</P>
<P>
According to the National Board of Revenue (NBR), the
collection for the period of July to September was, however, up by
12.27 percent over a year earlier.
</P>
<P>
In September, 98.02 percent of the target was achieved with a
shortfall of 232 million taka (about 5.27 million dollars) while
in July and August, only 90.97 percent of the target was
fulfilled.
</P>
<P>
Although the NBR managed to stem a drastic downward slide
during the quarter, it received a big blow when importers of
reconditioned cars took it to the court on a series of writs
challenging the imposition of duties, a senior NBR official said.
</P>
<P>
It clipped at least 2 billion taka (about 45 million dollars)
from the government's coffers, keeping the collection sluggish,
and this may strain the beleaguered NBR to achieve its projected
150 billion taka (about 3.4 billion dollars) collection for the
year, claimed the NBR official.

<HEADLINE> Drought death toll Rises in Irian Jaya, Indonesia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, October 16 (Xinhua) -- The death toll from drought in
eastern Indonesia has climbed to 445 people, the local press
reported today.
</P>
<P>
Malaria and cholera have been ravaging the people in Irian Jaya
Province as well as lack of food, the reports said.
</P>
<P>
Seven people who died from cerebral malaria were the latest
victims in the isolated district of Jayawijaya in the central
mountain range of the province, the Kompas Daily said.
</P>
<P>
Severe malnutrition following crop failures and a lack of clean
water in the province since April has led to outbreaks of several
diseases such as diarrhea and malaria.
</P>
<P>
Of the victims, 398 were in Jayawijaya District, 23 in the
neighboring district of Merauke to the south and 24 in Puncakjaya
District to the west, Kompas said.
</P>
<P>
Jayawijaya District head J. B. Nenas said that so far a relief
operation has dropped 20 tons of rice to several drought-hit areas
as well as noodles, yam and medicine.
</P>
<P>
The prolonged drought has also triggered forest fires in
several islands, such as Sumatra, Kalimantan and Irian Jaya in the
country.
</P>
<P>
An estimated 1.7 million hectares of forest have been razed by
this year's forest fires, causing a health-threatening haze and an
estimated loss of 6.2 trillion rupiah (1.7 billion U.S. dollars),
according to the Indonesian Forum for Environment (WALHI). The
estimate was much higher than those given by government officials.
</P>
<P>
Some local experts predicted that the long-awaited monsoon rain
would come in November, but some ecologists forecast that the rain
would come in January.

<HEADLINE> Private Businesses Participate In State Enterprise Reform </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
FUJIAN, October 16 (Xinhua) -- Fujian Province, a model in
China's economic reform, has been taking its private sector into
account while renovating state-owned enterprises.
</P>
<P>
The eastern province has been guiding the successful merger of
some private businesses with state-owned enterprises.
</P>
<P>
The management of a state-owned tinned food producer, employing
more than 500 people in Xianyuo County, was entrusted to a private
Zhongmao Group Co. in 1993. The merged company, formerly in debt,
now turns out an annual pre-tax profit of 5 million yuan.
</P>
<P>
The province's private businesses are expanding rapidly. The
added industrial value by the private sector constitutes 50
percent of the province's total added industrial value.
</P>
<P>
So far, there are 138 privately owned companies with sales from
50 to 100 million yuan each, and 60 firms with sales exceeding 100
million yuan each.
</P>
<P>
The province offers assistance to individually owned
enterprises undergoing reform in such areas as finances,
management, social security and property rights.

<HEADLINE> Two Oil Tankers Collide in Singapore Strait </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SINGAPORE, October 16 (Xinhua) -- Two oil tankers collided in
the Singapore Strait last night, resulting in an oil spill of
3,000 to 4,000 tons with no reports of injuries to crew members,
the Maritime Port Authority of Singapore (MPA) said today.
</P>
<P>
The collision occurred between an empty very large crude
carrier (VLCC) and an oil tanker in the Singapore Strait at about
9 p.m. last night, at a location just off the Singapore port
limits, where visibility then was about eight kilometers.
</P>
<P>
The Thai-registered VLCC "Orapin Global" of 129,702 gross tons
was transiting the Singapore Strait from east to west while the
Cyprus-flagged oil tanker "Evoikos," 75,428 gross tons, was
eastward-bound for Singapore from the United Arab Emirates. They
had been both warned of the impending collision by the Vessel
Traffic Information Service, the MPA said.
</P>
<P>
The MPA said the extent of damage to the Orapin Global, which
was empty at the time of the collision, has yet to be established.
But the damage to the Evoikos, which was carrying about 120,000
tons of marine fuel oil, is assessed to be two tanks, which caused
an oil spill of 3,000 to 4,000 tons.
</P>
<P>
Both vessels are in no danger of sinking and there were no
reports of injuries to crew members, the MPA said, adding that
investigations are under way to identify the cause of the
collision and clean-up operations are being conducted.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Optimistic About Serbs' Give-up of Heavy Weapons </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, October 15 (Xinhua) -- The United States is
optimistic that Bosnian Serbs will give up their heavy weapons and
comply more with the terms of an arms control agreement, a senior
U.S. administration official said today.
</P>
<P>
"The gap between what is expected of them and what they're
doing has reduced dramatically from the projections of a few
months ago," said the official, who spoke to a group of reporters
on condition of anonymity at the Foreign Press Club.
</P>
<P>
"Six months ago, the projections were a kind of alarming. It
looked as if the parties would be far out of line with the
ceilings, particularly the Bosnian Serbs," he said.
</P>
<P>
According to the Dayton peace accord, the Muslim-Croat
federation can have 273 tanks and 1,000 artillery pieces while the
Serbs, who have some 1,000 tanks and cannons over the limit, was
allowed to have 137 tanks and 500 guns.
</P>
<P>
The deadline for the cut is November 1. The Bosnian Serbs
reportedly refused to part with their overwhelming advantage in
tanks and artillery.

<HEADLINE> Mahathir Calls for More ASEAN Economic Integration </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SUBANG JAYA (Malaysia), October 16 (Xinhua) -- Malaysian Prime
Minister Mahathir Mohamad today stressed the need for the
Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) to move toward
greater economic integration.
</P>
<P>
"To make ASEAN relevant in the next millennium we need to have
a longer term vision of what we want to be as an Association... We
need to set our sights higher... What is certain is that we need
to make the bold move toward greater economic integration, as we
will have to face an uncertain environment," he said when
officiating the 29th ASEAN Economic Ministers (AEM) meeting here.
</P>
<P>
He said that in moving toward greater economic integration,
ASEAN may need to look at the way the members cooperate with a new
perspective.
</P>
<P>
ASEAN must acknowledge that during the process, the members are
more exposed to the occurrence of disputes among themselves in
implementing the economic initiatives and have to resolve such
disputes swiftly and effectively, he said.
</P>
<P>
"While we implement initiatives toward greater economic
integration in ASEAN, we need to review regulatory and
administrative procedures at the national and ASEAN levels with a
view to making them more simple and transparent and ensure that
new measures introduced have the effect of facilitating decisions
and approvals," Mahathir said.
</P>
<P>
Mahathir acknowledged that ASEAN will have to face enormous
challenges. "While standing together to face problems may not
amount to much, it is much safer than isolating ourselves in the
hope that we may not be noticed and thus left alone."
</P>
<P>
While ASEAN integrates economically, he said, the grouping
should also harness the benefits of information technology at a
very early stage before the enormity and speed of these
developments render it impossible for the region to catch up.
</P>
<P>
Mahathir spoke highly of ASEAN's "commendable achievements,"
which he said have made ASEAN an important player in international
economic relations.
</P>
<P>
He pointed out that for ASEAN's long-term prosperity, member
countries need to cooperate in macroeconomic policy formulation to
ensure the achievement of stable, sustainable economic growth for
the region.
</P>
<P>
The two-day meeting, chaired by Malaysian International Trade
and Industry Minister Rafidah Aziz, is being attended by trade and
economic ministers of the nine ASEAN countries -- Brunei,
Indonesia, Malaysia, the Philippines, Singapore, Thailand,
Vietnam, Laos and Myanmar.

<HEADLINE> Guangxi Successful in Dealing with Drug Crimes </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NANNING, October 16 (Xinhua) -- The Guangxi Zhang Autonomous
Region, south China, stepped up crackdown on drug-related crimes
and settled altogether 7,447 cases in the first nine months of
this year, representing a 54.4 percent increase over 1996 same
period.
</P>
<P>
Local police seized from January to September a total of 149
kilograms drugs and arrested some 9,000 people involved in drug
trafficking or drug abuse. and 235 of them have been sentenced to
varying prison terms.
</P>
<P>
With long coastal and border lines, Guangxi has witnessed an
rise in drug-related crimes over recent years. The autonomous
regional authorities therefore have taken a series of coercive
measures to stem the spreading of drugs, including launching a
large-scale educational campaign to help raise the people's
awareness against drugs.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, the autonomous region has established 89 drug
rehabilitation centers where hundreds of experts, doctors and
instructors and, as a result, over 10,000 addicts have abandoned
drug addiction.

<HEADLINE> Freedom of Religious Belief in China (8) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Each country has its own history, culture and national
conditions, which decide that each country's protection of freedom
of religious belief has its own characteristics. While stressing
the protection of freedom of religious belief China pays equal
attention to the protection of the freedom not to believe in
religion, thus ensuring freedom of religious belief in a complete
sense. This is a more complete and more comprehensive protection
of citizens' basic rights. The Chinese government maintains that
religious belief is a citizen's personal affair. However, the
construction of a prosperous, powerful, democratic modern
socialist country with advanced culture, and the safeguarding of
the country's sovereignty and national dignity are the common
goals and in the fundamental interests of the Chinese people of
all ethnic groups, including those who believe in a religion and
those who do not. Therefore the people who believe in a religion
and those who do not can unite and cooperate politically, and
respect each other's beliefs.
</P>
<P>
Religion should be adapted to the society in which it is
prevalent. This is a universal law for the existence and
development of religion. Now the Chinese people are building
China into a modern socialist country with Chinese
characteristics. The Chinese government advocates that religion
should adapt to this reality. However, such adaptation does not
require citizens to give up religious belief, nor does it require
any religion to change its basic doctrines. Instead, it requires
religions to conduct their activities within the sphere prescribed
by law and adapt to social and cultural progress. This conforms to
the fundamental interests of religious believers as well as to
those of the various religions themselves.

<HEADLINE> Freedom of Religious Belief in China (9) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Nevertheless, since the 1980s some pernicious organizations
have sprung up in certain areas of China, which engage in illegal
and even criminal activities under the signboard of religion. Some
of the heads of these pseudo-religions distort religious
doctrines, create heresies, deceive the masses, refuse to obey the
State's laws and decrees, and incite people to overthrow the
government. Some pretend to be supernatural beings, and have
killed or injured people; others organize promiscuity, or defraud
people of money or property. They are a serious danger to the
normal life and productive activities of the people. The broad
masses of the people and personages of the religious circles
detest this phenomenon, and so, in order to safeguard the public
interest and the sanctity of the law, and to better protect the
people's right to freedom of religious belief and normal religious
activities, China's judicial organs punish law-breakers and
criminals who severely endanger society and public interest in
accordance with the law. The punishment of criminals by China's
judicial organs in accordance with the law has nothing to do with
religious belief. No one in China is punished because of his or
her religious belief. But no country that practices the rule of
law in the world today would tolerate illegal and criminal
activities being carried out under the banner of religion.

III. Judicial and Administrative Guarantees and Supervision of
the Freedom of Religious Belief
</P>
<P>
With respect to judicial guarantee, China stipulates clearly
the penalties for the infringement of citizens' right to freedom
of religious belief. For instance, Article 251 of the Criminal Law
states: ``State personnel who unlawfully deprive citizens of their
freedom of religious belief and infringe upon the customs and
habits of minority ethnic groups, when the circumstances are
serious, are to be sentenced to not more than two years of
fixed-term imprisonment or criminal detention.'' In the Decisions
on the Standards for Filing Directly Received Cases of
Infringement Upon Citizens' Democratic and Personal Rights and
Those of Malfeasance, it is stipulated that a people's
procuratorate shall place on file a case in which a State
functionary illegally deprives anyone of his or her legitimate
freedom of religious belief -- such as by interfering in normal
religious activities, forcing a believer to give up his/her
membership of a religion or compelling a citizen to profess a
certain religion or adherence to a certain religious sect -- and
in which the offense is of an abominable nature and has brought
about serious consequences and undesirable effects. A people's
procuratorate shall also put on record cases of illegally closing
or destroying lawful religious sites and other religious
facilities. In recent years the Chinese judiciary, in accordance
with the law, has tried several cases of infringing upon relevant
laws of the State and seriously hurting the religious feelings of
certain believers, and has meted out punishments to persons
responsible for the offenses.
</P>
<P>
With respect to administrative guarantee, governments at
different levels have set up religious affairs departments to
administer and supervise the implementation of the laws and
statutes pertaining to religion and to put the policy ensuring the
freedom of religious belief into effect. These departments shall
not interfere in the internal affairs of religious organizations
and sites.

</P>
<P>
The aid agreement, which is intended to help rebuild roads,
bridges and homes damaged in the Banja Luka region during the war,

<P>
The U.S. and its allies have voiced support for Plavsic's
decision to cooperate with the Western countries.
</P>

In China religious organizations and sites for religious
activities must register with the government in accordance with
the law, which is the case in some other countries as
well. Applications for such registration must meet the following
basic requirements: a permanent site and name; regular attendance;
a management organization composed of adherents to the relevant
religion; clerical personnel for officiating religious activities
or personnel with qualifications stipulated in regulations of
various religions; management regulations and lawful
income. Government departments shall defer the registration or
only approve temporary registration of religious sites which
cannot completely satisfy these basic requirements or have
prominent management problems. Government departments shall not
permit the registration of, for example, sites for religious
activities which illegally occupy land or violate the statutes of
city planning, which have been set up without authorization or
which promote superstitious activities, such as exorcising evil
spirits under the pretext of religious activities. Once a site for
religious activities is registered according to law it has legal
status and its lawful rights and interests shall be protected. If
its rights and interests are infringed upon, the organization in
charge of the site is entitled to seek administrative and legal
protection by appealing to the relevant government organ or taking
the case to a people's court. There is no registration requirement
for, to quote from Chinese Christians, ``house services,'' which
are mainly attended by relatives and friends for religious
activities such as praying and Bible reading.

<HEADLINE> Myanmar Urges More Investment in Food Production </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
YANGON, October 16 (Xinhua) -- The Myanmar government today
urged local and foreign entrepreneurs to make more investment in
the country's food production program and ensure food security.
</P>
<P>
In a ceremony marking the World Food Day, Myint Aung, minister
for agriculture and irrigation, said the government is making
efforts to boost food production and ensure sufficiency for
domestic consumption and for export.
</P>
<P>
He said Myanmar, as a member of the Association of Southeast
Asian Nations (ASEAN), is working closely with other nations in
the region in numerous areas including food production sectors
such as agriculture, livestock and fishery.
</P>
<P>
Today's official paper The New Light of Myanmar also said in
its commentary that the ministry has formed five working groups of
water supply, cultivation, agricultural education, finance and
supervision in the present fiscal year (1997-98) to help farmers
achieve the target of 20 million tons of rice production.
</P>
<P>
The ministry has been working to put 6.48 million hectares
under paddy yearly to realize the output target since the 1994-95
fiscal year, it noted.
</P>
<P>
The paper disclosed that the total output of Myanmar's
agricultural sector accounted for 36 percent of the gross domestic
product (GDP) and 35 percent of exports in fiscal 1996-97 with the
employment of 64 percent of the nation's labor force.
</P>
<P>
Of the country's total amount of exports of more than 883.3
million U.S. dollars, nearly 313.3 million were from the sector,
it pointed out.
</P>
<P>
Agriculture is the country's main economic sector with rice,
beans and pulses, cotton and sugarcane as its chief export items.
</P>
<P>
According to official statistics, Myanmar's rice production in
the 1996-97 fiscal year was 17.08 million tons with 93,100 tons
exported.
</P>
<P>
The latest statistics also show that Myanmar's rice export in
the first six months of 1997 reached merely 1,200 tons, down from
241,700 tons in the previous year.
</P>
<P>
Myanmar's GDP grew by 5.8 percent in the 1996-97 fiscal year,
in which agricultural production increased by 3.7 percent.

IV. Support for Independence and Initiative in Management of
Religious Affairs
</P>
<P>
China's religious affairs are handled by the various religious
bodies, their clergy and followers themselves. China's religious
affairs and religious bodies are not subject to any foreign
domination. The Chinese government supports the management of
religious affairs by the various religions themselves according to
the Constitution and laws.
</P>
<P>
The principle of independence and taking the initiative in
their own hands in the management of churches is a historical
choice made by the Chinese religious believers of their own accord
as part of the Chinese people's struggle against colonialist and
imperialist aggression and enslavement. Following the Opium War of
1840 China declined to a semi-feudal and semi-colonial country.
</P>
<P>
During this process Western Protestantism and Catholicism were
used by colonialism and imperialism as a tool for aggression
against China, and a number of Western missionaries played an
inglorious part in this.
</P>
<P>
They participated in the opium trade and in plotting the Opium
War unleashed by Britain against China. In the 19th century Robert
Morrison, a British missionary, and Karl Friedrich August Gutz, a
German missionary, both working for the East India Company,
participated in dumping opium in China.
</P>

Some missionaries strongly advocated resort to force by Western
powers to make the Qing government open its coastal ports, saying
that it was only war that could open China to Christianity, and
directly participated in the British military activities to invade
China.

According to Mark Twain, the renowned American writer, some of
the missionaries imposed on the poor Chinese peasants fines 13
times the amount they were supposed to pay, driving their wives
and innocent children to lingering death from starvation, so that
they were thus able to use the money gained through such murder to
propagate the Gospel.
</P>
<P>
They directly took part in plotting and drafting unequal
treaties, such as the Sino-British Treaty of Nanking of 1842, the
Sino-American Treaty of Wanghea of 1844, the Sino-American and
Sino-French treaties of Tientsin of 1858 and the Sino-French
Convention of Peking of 1860.
</P>
<P>
According to these unequal treaties, Western Catholic and
Protestant missionaries could lease land for building their own
places of worship in trade ports and enjoyed the protection of
local officials; missionaries could also freely lease or buy land
for construction and other purposes in the provinces; local
Chinese officials must treat them kindly and protect those
missionaries who came to inland regions to preach their religions;
Chinese officials must not impose prohibitions on Chinese who
professed a religious faith; etc.
</P>
<P>
They enjoyed extraterritoriality, and were not governed by
China's laws. The Western powers gave their missionaries in China
protection on the strength of the consular jurisdiction they
enjoyed.
</P>
<P>
Taking advantage of extraterritoriality some Western
missionaries, backed by the aggressive imperialist forces, went to
inland China to build churches and set up parishes.
</P>
<P>
They forcibly occupied land, and bullied and oppressed Chinese
officials and civilians. These missionaries even wilfully extended
the extraterritoriality to Chinese converts and interfered in
Chinese judicial authority.

They strengthened the control of the Western powers over China
on the pretext of "religious cases," -- conflicts and disputes
between Chinese people and the Western missionaries who incurred
popular indignation by doing evil deeds under the protection of
the unequal treaties.
</P>
<P>
In the period between 1840 and 1900, some 400 such cases
occurred in China. On the pretext of these religious cases the
Western powers imposed military and political pressure on the
Chinese government.
</P>
<P>
They put forward various unreasonable demands, compelled the
Chinese government to pay indemnities, and arrested and executed
innocent people. Moreover, they even launched aggressive wars on
such a pretext.
</P>
<P>
In a case in Tianjin in 1870 alone, the Western powers
compelled the Qing government to execute 20 people and exile 25.
</P>
<P>
They obstructed and opposed China's struggle against fascism
and the Chinese people's revolution. After Japan invaded Northeast
China, the Vatican Romana took a stand which was, in fact,
supporting the Japanese aggression.
</P>
<P>
It took the lead in recognizing the puppet Manchukuo regime set
up by the Japanese and sent a representative there. After the
victory in the War of Resistance Against Japan some Western
missionaries stirred up hostility against the people's revolution
among the converts and even organized armed forces to help the
Kuomintang fight in the civil war.
</P>
<P>
They adopted a hostile attitude toward New China and plotted
sabotage. After the founding of New China in 1949 the Vatican
issued papal encyclicals several times instigating hatred against
the new people's political power among the converts.

<P>
While playing an inglorious role in modern Chinese history,
Western Catholicism and Protestantism manipulated and controlled
Chinese churches turning them into the appendages to Western
religious orders and mission societies.
</P>
<P>
Under these circumstances Chinese clergymen and the vast
majority of their followers had no rights. In the 1940s among the
20 archbishops in China there were 17 foreigners and only three
Chinese; in the 143 parishes there were some 110 foreign bishops
but only about 20 Chinese bishops.
</P>
<P>
Some Chinese Christians early on expressed their wish to cast
off such control and began establishing their own independent
Christian organizations.
</P>
<P>
However, in the semi-colonial and semi-feudal old China it was
absolutely impossible for Chinese churches to maintain real
independence and realize self-management.
</P>
<P>
The founding of the People's Republic of China put an end to
the era of semi-colonial and semi-feudal society in China, thus
providing the historical conditions for Chinese Catholicism and
Protestantism to become independent and self-managing.
</P>
<P>
In July 1950, 40 leading figures from various religious
denominations headed by Wu Yaozong published the "Three-Self
Declaration," titled "The Way in Which the Chinese Christianity
Works for New China's Construction," expressing the attitude of
Chinese Christians who supported New China, and their
determination to cast off imperialist influence and achieve the
"Three Selfs" (self-administration, self-support and
self-propagation) of Chinese churches.

<P>
While adhering to the principle of independence and
self-administration, Chinese religions are active in making
exchanges and contacts with their counterparts all over the world
on the basis of equality and friendship.
</P>
<P>
China is always open to foreign religious organizations and
individuals who are friendly to China, respect China's sovereignty
and Chinese religions' principle of independence and
self-administration. China's Protestantism and Catholicism have
maintained friendly contacts with churches in many countries.
</P>
<P>
In February 1991, the China Christian Council officially joined
the World Council of Churches. The Chinese Catholic Church has
sent representatives to attend some international religious
conferences successively, such as the Fifth World Conference on
Religion and Peace, and the World Catholic Youth Day.
</P>
<P>
In recent years Chinese churches have sent quite a number of
students to study abroad and invited foreign lecturers and
scholars to teach in China's theological seminaries. Friendly
international exchanges are also increasing in the areas of
China's Buddhism, Taoism and Islam.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese government has consistently adhered to a peaceful
foreign policy of independence and taking initiative in its own
hands, and is willing to improve the relations with the Vatican.
</P>
<P>
However, such improvement requires two basic conditions: First,
the Vatican must end its so-called diplomatic relations with
Taiwan and recognize that the government of the People's Republic
of China is the only legal government in China and that Taiwan is
an inalienable part of China's territory.
</P>
<P>
Second, the Vatican must not interfere in China's internal
affairs on the pretext of religious affairs. In the first place,
the relationship between China and the Vatican is one between two
countries.
</P>
<P>
Therefore, only when the relations between the two countries
improve can religious issues be discussed. Whether the relations
between China and the Vatican change or not, the Chinese
government will, as always, support Chinese Catholicism which
holds aloft the banner of patriotism, sticks to the principle of
independence and self-management, and stands for selection and
ordination of bishops by itself.

In September 1950, 1,527 leading Christians signed the
declaration. Three or four years later the number of Christians
who had signed the document reached more than 400,000, about
two-thirds of the total number of Christians in the
country. Christians have since then adhered to the principles of
the "Three Selfs."
</P>
<P>
In November 1950, more than 500 Catholics in Guangyuan County,
Sichuan, published the Declaration on the Catholic Reform Movement
of Self-Support, advocating cutting off the relationship with
imperialism in all aspects and setting up new churches on the
basis of self-administration, self-support and self-propagation.
</P>
<P>
The declaration was welcomed by the leading Catholic clergymen
and other converts in all parts of China. Though the Vatican took
repeated political actions of hostility against New China, the
Chinese church reported the appointment of one acting bishop and
two full bishops, selected in 1957 and 1958, to the Vatican.
</P>
<P>
However, the Vatican refused to recognize them threatening to
mete out extraordinary punishments, greatly hurting the feelings
of the Chinese Catholics. Since then the Chinese Catholic church
has firmly taken the way of selecting and ordaining its own
bishops and independently managing the churches.
</P>
<P>
In religious belief Chinese Catholicism is the same as
Catholicisms anywhere else in the world, while in church
administration all the internal affairs are handled according to
decisions made by the Chinese Catholic church independently.
</P>
<P>
In the past few decades the Chinese Protestantism and
Catholicism have stuck to the principle of independence and
self-management, which has met with assent and support from the
vast majority of believers and enabled the church and its
religious activities to develop soundly.
</P>
<P>
Now the total number of Chinese Christians is 14 times as many
as in 1949. Chinese Catholicism has 115 parishes under the
direction of Chinese bishops or priests.

V. Protection of the Right to Freedom of Religious Belief for
Ethnic Minorities
</P>
<P>
China is a united country of many ethnic groups. The Chinese
government pursues a policy of equality, unity and mutual
assistance among all the ethnic groups, respects and protects the
right to freedom of religious belief and the folk customs of the
ethnic minorities.
</P>
<P>
The Law of the People's Republic of China on National Regional
Autonomy stipulates: "Organs of self-government in ethnic regional
autonomous areas protect the right to freedom of religious belief
of the citizens of all ethnic groups."
</P>
<P>
While making great efforts to promote progress in economy,
culture, education and other undertakings in the areas where
ethnic minorities live in compact communities, so as to improve
the material and cultural well-being of the broad masses of the
ethnic minorities (including believers in various religions), the
Chinese government pays special attention to their religious
beliefs and the protection of their cultural heritages.
</P>
<P>
Special programs have been carried out to survey, collect,
classify, study and publish the cultural heritages -- including
religious cultures -- and folk arts of all the ethnic groups. In
addition, the State has made huge investments in the maintenance
and reconstruction of temples, mosques and other religious
facilities of important historical and cultural value in
ethnic minority areas.
</P>
<P>
Tibet is one of China's ethnic autonomous regions, and the
Tibetans mostly believe in Tibetan Buddhism. Since the peaceful
liberation of Tibet in 1951, and particularly since the
introduction of the reform and opening policies in 1979, citizens'
right to freedom of religious belief has been thoroughly carried
out in Tibet.
</P>
<P>
Since the 1980s the central government has allocated more than
200 million yuan in special funds for the maintenance and
reconstruction of the famous Potala Palace and the Jokhang,
Tashilhunpo and Samye monasteries.
</P>
<P>
The State has also established special funds to support the
work of compiling and publishing the Tripitaka in the Tibetan
language and other major Tibetan Buddhist classics as well as the
work of establishing the Advanced Buddhism College of Tibetan
Language Family of China in Beijing and the Tibet College of
Buddhism in Lhasa.

<P>
At present, there are in Tibet over 1,700 places for Buddhist
activities and a total of 46,000 resident monks and nuns. Small
prayer halls or shrines are virtually universal in the homes of
believers, and pilgrims coming to Lhasa number well over one
million each year.
</P>
<P>
Believers performing Buddhist rituals, and prayer umbrellas and
Mani rocks carved with Buddhist sutras can be found all over the
Tibet Autonomous Region.
</P>
<P>
In addition, religious activities during the annual Sholton
Festival and the traditional practice of circling Mount
Kangrinboqe in the Year of the Horse and circling Lake Namco in
the Year of the Sheep along pilgrim paths have been carried on and
respected by society at large.
</P>
<P>
The reincarnation of holy men, or ``Living Buddhas,'' is a
unique form of succession in Tibetan Buddhism which has long been
recognized and respected by the State.
</P>
<P>
In 1992 the Religious Affairs Bureau of the State Council
approved the succession of the 17th Karmapa Living Buddha.
</P>
<P>
In 1995 China successfully concluded the search for and
identification of the reincarnation of the 10th Panchen Lama and
the title-conferring and enthronement of the 11th Panchen Lama
after lot-drawing from a golden urn according to the established
religious rituals and historical conventions of Tibetan Buddhism,
and with the approval of the State Council.
</P>
<P>
These actions highlight the fact that the Tibetan people's
right to religious freedom is respected and protected, thus
winning endorsement and support from the converts of Tibet.
</P>
<P>
Considering the special place of the Grand Living Buddhas in
Tibetan Buddhism of past generations in Tibetan social life, the
Ming (1368-1644) and Qing (1644-1911) dynasties gradually put the
identifying of the reincarnation of the Living Buddhas within the
jurisdiction of the central government and into the framework of
the State's laws and statutes.
</P>
<P>
In 1792 the Qing government issued an order that the
reincarnation of the Grand Living Buddhas above the Hutuktu rank
be determined through drawing lots from the golden urn, which
later developed into a historical institution and was accepted as
a permanent religious ritual in Tibetan Buddhism.

<TEXT>
<P>
The lot-drawing may be dispensed with under special
circumstances, but this must also be reported to the central
government in advance for approval. The practice of lot-drawing
from the golden urn not only upholds the central government's
supreme authority and the sovereignty of the State, but
religiously displays the "decision by Sakyamuni's Dharma" as well.
</P>
<P>
Since 1792, in the reincarnation system of the Grand Living
Buddhas of Tibetan Buddhism over 70 "soul boys" have been
identified by confirmation through lot-drawing from the golden urn
and with the approval of the central government.
</P>
<P>
Therefore, the approval of the reincarnation of the Grand
Living Buddhas by the central government is a religious ritual and
historical convention of Tibetan Buddhism, and is the key to
safeguarding the normal order of Tibetan Buddhism.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese government also respects and protects the Moslems'
freedom of religious belief as well as their folk customs. The
departments concerned in the government have provided special
pilgrimage-related services for Moslem pilgrims, to the acclaim of
the latter.
</P>
<P>
Since the 1980s the number of Chinese Moslems going to Mecca on
pilgrimages has exceeded 40,000. In the Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous
Region alone, there are now more than 23,000 mosques, with 29,000
clergymen, having thus met the needs of believers' religious life.
</P>
<P>
Out of full consideration for the dietary habits and funeral
rites of those ethnic-minority people who believe in Islam, the
Chinese government has enacted regulations on the production of
halal food and opened Moslems-only cemeteries.
</P>
<P>
In recent years Chinese judicial organs have provided legal
protection for the lawful rights of the Moslems. Some cases
concerning publications badly hurting the religious feelings of
the Moslems have been handled according to law.

The Chinese government resolutely opposes attempts to split the
country along ethnic lines, and any use of religious fanaticism to
divide the people, split the country or harm the unity among all
ethnic groups or engage in illegal activities and terrorist
actions under the signboard of religion.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the Chinese government firmly upholds national unity
and social stability in areas where ethnic minorities live in
compact communities, and safeguards the normal religious
activities of the ethnic-minority believers.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese government respects the generally accepted
principles regarding religious faiths in the international
community, and holds that these principles must be applied in
accordance with the concrete conditions and be carried out
according to the domestic law of each country.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese government opposes creating confrontations in
religion or interfering in the internal affairs of another country
under the pretext of religion.
</P>
<P>
The facts make it fully clear that remarkable improvements have
been achieved in the situation of human rights of the Chinese
people, and the freedom of religious belief has enjoyed full
respect and legal protection since the founding of New China,
particularly in the recent two decades following the
implementation of reform and opening policies.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese government will, as always, make ever-greater
efforts to safeguard human rights and specifically to protect the
freedom of religious belief.

BEIJING, October 16 (Xinhua) -- Western multinational
corporations have begun to channel their capital into Central
Asian countries, mainly in local energy industries.
</P>
<P>
Kazakhstan, Uzbekistan, Kyrgyzstan, and Turkmenistan -- rich in
oil and natural gas resources -- are especially attractive to
Western investors because of increasing political stability in the

<HEADLINE> Thailand to See Only 1.6-Percent Growth in 1998 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, October 16 (Xinhua) -- Thailand's economic growth for
fiscal 1998 could reach only 1.6 percent following massive cuts in
the budget for fiscal 1998, according to a Budget Bureau source
today.
</P>
<P>
For fiscal 1997, which ended on September 30, the bureau
expects the country's gross domestic product (GDP) to grow by 2.1
percent, compared with about 6.8 percent for 1996.
</P>
<P>
The bureau's forecasts contrast with those announced by Deputy
Prime Minister Virabongsa Ramangkura on Tuesday, when he said the
country's economic growth for 1997 would be 2.5 percent and 3.5
percent for 1998.
</P>
<P>
On Tuesday the cabinet approved cuts of 100 billion baht (2.75
billion U.S. dollars) in the fiscal 1998 budget, reducing it to
823 billion baht (22.64 billion dollars).
</P>
<P>
The cuts were made as required by the International Monetary
Fund (IMF) to achieve a budget surplus of 1 percent of GDP in
1998.
</P>
<P>
The current account deficit will improve from 5.6 percent of
GDP this year to 2.6 percent in 1998, the source quoted Budget
Bureau Director-General Seri Suksathaporn as saying.

<HEADLINE> Asia to Become World's Top Auto Producer and Consumer by 2015 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, October 16 (Xinhua) -- Asia will replace North America as
the world's largest motor vehicle manufacturing area by year 2015,
while its market share will be the same as the combined amount of the
United States and Canada.
</P>
<P>
Addressing the on-going 15th World Petroleum Congress, Tsutomu
Kagawa, managing director of the Japan Automobile Manufacturers
Association, said here today that Asia is expected to account for
36 percent of the world output of four-wheeled vehicles by 2015,
compared with North America and Western Europe at 25 percent and
19 percent, respectively.
</P>
<P>
According to Kagawa, production output worldwide is projected
at 92.3 million in 2015, with corresponding sales figures being
just about the same. In the past two decades, production of motor
vehicles has grown by about 18 million.
</P>
<P>
In sales, Asia is expected to grow rapidly, especially from the
year 2000. By 2015, it should account for 36 percent of worldwide
sales also, again surpassing North America and Western Europe by a
wide margin.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, similar trends are seen in the increase of the market
share or ownership of four-wheeled vehicles worldwide. Asia is to
gain 28 percent of the market in 18 years' time from 19 percent in
1995. In the meantime, North America and Western Europe, currently
largest and second largest consumers, will register steady
decline, from 1995's 35 percent and 29 percent to 2015's 28
percent and 22 percent of the market scale respectively.
</P>
<P>
The shares of Eastern Europe and other regional markets are
also expected to grow, but at a slower pace, said Kagawa.
</P>
<P>
Because of the growth of the population of motor vehicles, fuel
consumption worldwide is expected to grow by 1.6 folds.

<HEADLINE> Thailand to Speed Up Privatization </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, October 16 (Xinhua) -- The Thai government is to speed
up the privatization of 66 state enterprises so that the process
can be completed within five years.
</P>
<P>
The five-year plan will be considered today by a committee
supervising policy for state enterprises, chaired by Deputy Prime
Minister Thaksin Shinawatra, press reports said today.
</P>
<P>
Thaksin was quoted as saying the main purpose of privatization
would be to increase the efficiency of the enterprises since they
play a significant role in economic development.
</P>
<P>
The economic slowdown has forced the government to cut expenses
and falling revenues mean that the sale of state enterprises will
be the main source of cash for the country, he said.
</P>
<P>
In order to speed up privatization, Thaksin said, the
government would soon issue a corporatization act which covers
guidelines of privatization processes.
</P>
<P>
He said that over the next one to two years, state enterprises
will be required to implement conduct-clear plans for
privatization.

<HEADLINE> Economist: IMF to Ask Indonesia to Reform Economy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, October 16 (Xinhua) -- The International Monetary Fund
(IMF) will likely require Indonesia to reform its banking sector
and trade regime and revise its state budget as part of a scheme
to restore confidence in the country's economy, a noted economist
said.
</P>
<P>
"Standard IMF reforms to restore a country's economy are
banking sector, trade and state budget," Mari Pangestu, managing
director of the Center for Strategic and International Studies,
said here Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Indonesia will need at least two years to recover from the
current economic crisis, even with IMF help, Pangestu was quoted
as saying by the local press today.
</P>
<P>
The Indonesian government decided last week to seek
international assistance in face of continued weakening of the
rupiah.
</P>
<P>
Indonesian officials and IMF team members began closed-door
meeting on Monday to work out reform policies and possible loans.
</P>
<P>
Pangestu has joined those who say Indonesia will likely obtain
funds of some 12 billion U.S. dollars from the IMF, in the form of
stand-by loans.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the Indonesian rupiah, the national currency, fell
past 3,500 against the dollar in late trading Wednesday on
continued local dollar demand.
</P>
<P>
"Domestic dollar buying interest seems to continue. Sporadic
intervention by the central bank at the 3,500 and 3,560 levels had
not helped," a U.S. dealer said.
</P>
<P>
Spot rupiah dropped to a low of 3,595 in the afternoon before
profit-taking and the central bank emerged, sending the dollar
back to 3,560/80.
</P>
<P>
At the same time, the Jakarta Stock Exchange Composite Index
went down by 1.9 percent to 518.19 points on closing Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
State Secretary Moerdiono said Tuesday that an IMF mission here
was discussing "technical assistance" for Indonesia's efforts to
overcome the crisis that followed the fall of the rupiah.
</P>
<P>
However, reports have said the IMF was preparing an aid package
that would include billions of dollars in loans.
</P>
<P>
Government officials here said earlier that the value of the
rupiah has dropped by 46 percent against the dollar since the
beginning of this year.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, October 16 (Xinhua) -- The Information Office of the
State Council today released a White Paper on freedom of religious
belief in China.
</P>
<P>
The following is the full text of the White Paper:
</P>
<P>
I. The Present Conditions of Religion in China
</P>
<P>
China is a country with a great diversity of religious
beliefs. The main religions are Buddhism, Taoism, Islam,
Catholicism and Protestantism. Citizens of China may freely
choose and express their religious beliefs, and make clear their
religious affiliations. According to incomplete statistics, there
are over 100 million followers of various religious faiths, more
than 85,000 sites for religious activities, some 300,000 clergy
and over 3,000 religious organizations throughout China. In
addition, there are 74 religious schools and colleges run by
religious organizations for training clerical personnel.
</P>
<P>
Buddhism has a history of 2,000 years in China. Currently China
has 13,000-some Buddhist temples and about 200,000 Buddhist monks
and nuns. Among them are 120,000 lamas and nuns, more than 1,700
Living Buddhas, and 3,000-some temples of Tibetan Buddhism and
nearly 10,000 Bhiksu and senior monks and more than 1,600 temples
of Pali Buddhism. Taoism, native to China, has a history of more
than 1,700 years. China now has over 1,500 Taoist temples and
more than 25,000 Taoist priests and nuns.
</P>
<P>
Islam was introduced into China in the seventh
century. Nowadays in China there are ten national minorities,
including the Hui and Uygur, with a total population of 18
million, whose faith is Islam. Their 30,000-odd mosques are
served by 40,000 Imams and Akhunds. Catholicism was introduced
into China intermittently in the seventh century, but it had not
spread widely until after the Opium War in 1840. At present, China
has four million Catholics, 4,000 clergy and more than 4,600
churches and meeting houses.

<P>
BEIJING, October 16 (Xinhua) -- The Information Office of the
State Council today issued a White Paper on Freedom of Religious
Belief in China.
</P>
<P>
The white paper, with more than 10,000 Chinese characters,
consists of five parts: The Present Conditions of Religion in
China, Legal Protection of the Freedom of Religious Belief,
Judicial and Administrative Guarantees and Supervision of the
Freedom of Religious Belief, Support for Independence and
Initiative in Management of Religious Affairs, and Protection of
the Right to Freedom of Religious Belief for Ethnic Minorities.

<TEXT>
<P>
Protestantism was first brought to China in the early 19th
century and spread widely after the Opium War. There are about 10
million Protestants, more than 18,000 clergy, more than 12,000
churches and 25,000-some meeting places throughout China.
</P>
<P>
China has the following national religious
organizations: Buddhist Association of China, Taoist Association
of China, Islamic Association of China, Chinese Patriotic Catholic
Association, Chinese Catholic Bishops' College, Three-Self
Patriotic Movement Committee of the Protestant Churches of China,
and China Christian Council.
</P>
<P>
Religious leaders and leading organs of the various religious
bodies are selected and ordained in accordance with their own
regulations. Religious organizations in China run their own
affairs independently and set up religious schools, publish
religious classics and periodicals, and run social services
according to their own needs. As in many other countries, China
practices the principle of separating religion from education;
religion is not a subject taught in schools of the popular
education in China, although some institutions of higher learning
and research institutes do teach or conduct research into
religion. The various religious schools and institutes set up by
the different religious organizations teach religious knowledge in
line with their own needs. All normal clerical activities
conducted by the clergy and all normal religious activities held
either at sites for religious activities or in believers' own
homes in accordance with usual religious practices, such as
worshipping Buddha, reciting scriptures, going to church, praying,
preaching, observing Mass, baptising, monkhood initiation,
fasting, celebrating religious festivals, observing extreme
unction, and holding memorial ceremonies, are protected by law as
the affairs of religious bodies and believers themselves and may
not be interfered with.

<P>
The ``cultural revolution'' (1966 to 1976) had a disastrous
effect on all aspects of the society in China, including
religion. But in the course of correcting the errors of the
``cultural revolution'' governments at all levels made great
efforts to revive and implement the policy of freedom of religious
belief, redressed the unjust, false or wrong cases imposed on
religious personages, and reopened sites for religious
activities. Since the 1980s, approximately 600 Protestant churches
have been reopened or rebuilt each year in China. By the end of
1996 more than 18 million copies of the Bible had been printed,
with special tax exemption treatment speeding their publication.
In addition, more than eight million copies of a hymn book
published by the China Christian Council in 1983 have been
distributed. From 1958 to 1995, a total of 126 Catholic bishops
were selected and ordained by the Chinese Catholic church
itself. In the past dozen years more than 900 young Catholic
priests have been trained or consecrated by Chinese
Catholicism. More than 3,000 Protestants attend the Sunday service
at Chongwenmen church in Beijing each week. The Beijing Nantang
Catholic Cathedral observes Mass four times each week with an
attendance of more than 2,000. Of these, one Mass is held in
English specially for foreigners in Beijing.
</P>
<P>
In the course of the country's long history, the various
religions in China have become part of the traditional Chinese
thinking and culture. It is traditional for Chinese religious
believers to love their country and religions. The Chinese
government supports and encourages the religious circles to unite
the religious believers to actively participate in the
construction of the country. The various religions all advocate
serving the society and promoting people's well-being, such as the
Buddhists' ``honoring the country and benefiting the people,'' the
Catholics and Protestants' ``glorifying God and benefiting the
people,'' the Taoists' ``being benevolent, peaceful and
harmonious, saving the world and benefiting the people,'' and the
Islam's ``praying to allah to give great reward in this world and
hereafter.''

In China all religions have equal status and coexist in
tranquillity. Religious disputes are unknown in China. Religious
believers and non-believers respect each other, are united and
have a harmonious relationship. This shows, on the one hand, the
influence of traditional Chinese compatibility and tolerance, and,
on the other, the fact that since the founding of the People's
Republic of China in 1949 the Chinese government has formulated
and carried out the policy of freedom of religious belief and
established a politico-religious relationship that conforms to
China's national conditions.
</P>
<P>
II. Legal Protection of the Freedom of Religious Belief
</P>
<P>
Chinese citizens' right to the freedom of religious belief is
protected by the Constitution and laws.
</P>
<P>
In the Constitution of the People's Republic of China freedom
of religious belief is a basic right enjoyed by all
citizens. Article 36 of the Constitution stipulates, ``Citizens of
the People's Republic of China enjoy freedom of religious
belief.'' It also goes on to say, ``No State organ, public
organization or individual may compel citizens to believe in, or
not to believe in, any religion; nor may they discriminate against
citizens who believe in, or do not believe in, any religion.''
Again, ``the State protects normal religious activities,'' and
``No one may make use of religion to engage in activities that
disrupt public order, impair the health of citizens or interfere
with the educational system of the State.'' In addition,
``Religious bodies and religious affairs are not subject to any
foreign domination.''

China's Law on National Regional Autonomy, General Principles
of the Civil Law, Education Law, Labor Law, Compulsory Education
Law, Electoral Law of the People's Congresses, Organic Law of the
Villagers' Committees, Advertisement Law, and other laws stipulate
that all citizens, regardless of their religious beliefs, have the
right to vote and stand for election; the legitimate property of
religious bodies is subject to legal protection; education is
separate from religion, and all citizens, regardless of their
religious beliefs, enjoy equal educational opportunities in
accordance with the law; the people of all ethnic groups should
respect each other's languages, customs and habits, and religious
beliefs; citizens shall not be discriminated against in terms of
employment because of different religious beliefs; and no
advertisements or trade marks shall include discriminatory
contents against any ethnic group or religion. The Chinese
government has promulgated the Regulations on the Administration
of Sites for Religious Activities so as to protect the lawful
rights and interests of such sites. The Regulations specify: Sites
for religious activities shall be run independently by the
administrative organizations thereof, whose lawful rights and
interests and normal religious activities at the sites shall be
protected by law. No organization or individual may violate or
interfere with such rights, interests or activities. Anyone who
encroaches on the lawful rights and interests of the sites for
religious activities shall bear legal responsibilities. Religious
activities conducted at the sites, however, must conform to laws
and regulations.

religion. Aliens may participate in religious activities at
recognized sites for religious activities within Chinese
territory. They may also preach at the invitation of Chinese
religious bodies at or above the provincial level. Aliens may hold
religious activities attended by aliens at sites approved by
people's governments at or above the county level. They may invite
Chinese clerical personnel to conduct such religious rituals as
baptisms, weddings, funerals and prayer meetings, and may bring
with them printed religious matter, audio-visual religious
material and other religious articles for personal use while
entering Chinese territory. Aliens who conduct religious
activities within Chinese territory shall abide by Chinese laws

The legal protection of citizens' right to the freedom of
religious belief in China is basically in accordance with the main
contents of the concerned international documents and conventions
in this respect. The following stipulations in the United Nations
Charter, the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, the
International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights,
the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, the
United Nations Declaration on the Elimination of All Forms of
Intolerance and of Discrimination Based on Religion or Belief, and
the Vienna Declaration and Action Program are all included in
China's laws and legislation in explicit terms and are being put
into practice: that freedom of religion or belief is a basic human
right; people should enjoy freedom of religion or belief; no one
should be discriminated against because of religious affiliation
or belief; people should enjoy freedom of religious service and
assembly, and the freedom to set up and maintain places of
worship; they should have the freedom to compile and distribute
printed materials pertaining to religion or belief; they should
have the freedom to celebrate religious festivals and hold
religious rites based on their faiths and morals; and they should
have the right to promote and protect the rights pertaining to
only a small number of people ethnically, racially, religiously
and linguistically. According to Chinese law, while all citizens
enjoy the right to freedom of religious belief they must also
carry out duties prescribed by law. In China, all individuals and
organizations, including all religions, must safeguard the
people's interests, the sanctity of the law, ethnic unity and
unification of the nation. This is in conformity with the relevant
clauses of the UN documents and conventions on human rights. The
Declaration on the Elimination of All Forms of Intolerance and of
Discrimination Based on Religion or Belief states: ``Freedom to
manifest one's religion or belief may be subject only to such
limitations as are prescribed by law and are necessary to protect
public safety, order, health or morals or the fundamental rights
and freedom of others.'' The International Covenant on Civil and
Political Rights notes: ``Any advocacy of national, racial or
religious hatred that constitutes incitement to discrimination,
hostility or violence shall be prohibited by law.'' Citizens who
believe in religion and those who do not believe in religion are
equal before the law. This is a basic requirement for modern
civilization and nations subject to the rule of law.

<HEADLINE> OPEC Urges More Technology Transfer in Global Oil Industry </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, October 16 (Xinhua) -- OPEC should have access to the
best facilities in order to maximize the value of their natural
resources, though its member countries are blessed highly
competitive costs for both exploration and development, said
Rilwanu Lukman, secretary general of OPEC, at the plenary meeting
of 15th World Petroleum Congress today.
</P>
<P>
The global oil industry has undergone considerable development
since 1970s, he said. however, "the transfer of technology to
developing countries is still very much an issue of concern," he
added.
</P>
<P>
The OPEC member countries have thus far implemented legislation
that encourages sustainable and economic exploration of their
existing oil reserves as well as the search for new reserves,
according to the secretary general.
</P>
<P>
He said it is now generally recognized that the transfer of
technology in the oil industry is most likely to take the form of
joint ventures or other types of partnership between OPEC members
and the western oil companies.
</P>
<P>
Some of the OPEC members have increased the level of foreign
participation in their oil industries in order to improve their
access to the advanced upstream and downstream petroleum
technology, said Lukman.

<HEADLINE> ASEAN Opens Economic Ministers Meeting in Malaysia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SUBANG JAYA (Malaysia), October 16 (Xinhua) -- The 29th ASEAN
Economic Ministers (AEM) meeting opened here today at a time when
most ASEAN economies are tested due to the speculative attacks on
their currencies.
</P>
<P>
The two-day meeting was inaugurated by Malaysian Prime Minister
Mahathir Mohamad and is attended by Laos and Myanmar, both
admitted into ASEAN last July, for the first time, and by all the
other members -- Brunei, Indonesia, Malaysia, the Philippines,
Singapore, Thailand and Vietnam. Cambodia is present as an
observer.
</P>
<P>
The meeting is expected to mainly focus on the currency and
stock market turmoil that has swept the region as host Malaysia's
proposal to study the impact of the currency attack on regional
economies is included in the agenda for the AEM.
</P>
<P>
The turmoil affected Malaysia, Indonesia, Thailand and the
Philippines most, and to a lesser extent Singapore, with the
currencies of the first four having depreciated by between 25-35
percent against the U.S. dollar since July.
</P>
<P>
Malaysia wants the inputs to assess the impact of currency
changes on trade within and outside ASEAN to complement efforts by
the International Monetary Fund and World Bank to rethink the
effects speculative currency trading is having on domestic and
regional economies.
</P>
<P>
Expected to be reviewed at the meeting are the ASEAN Free Trade
Area (AFTA) where tariffs would be between only zero and 5 percent
by the year 2003, the ASEAN Industrial Cooperation scheme, the
framework for the proposed ASEAN Investment Area which seeks to
reduce barriers to the free flow of capital and the adoption of
similar and more transparent rules to complement the AFTA scheme.
</P>
<P>
Other issues the ministers would likely deliberate on include
the soon to be endorsed Trade and Customs Tariff Notification
Procedure which requires member countries to inform each other of
any modifications in the AFTA commitments and obligations which
might impair or nullify any benefit to members.
</P>
<P>
During the meeting, AEM dialogues would be held with the Closer
Economic Relations countries of Australia and New Zealand, the
Southern African Development Community and Japan's Ministry of
International Trade and Industry.

<HEADLINE> Three European States End Talks With China on Market </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, October 15 (Xinhua) -- Hungary, the Czech Republic and
Slovakia have ended bilateral talks with China on mutual market
access under the World Trade Organization (WTO), China's deputy
trade minister Long Yongtu announced here today.
</P>
<P>
Hungary signed the agreement of mutual market access with China
in July, becoming the first European country to make such a deal
with China during the negotiations on China's accession to the
WTO. The two sides agreed that the deal be made public today.
</P>
<P>
Long met with Hungary's representative to the WTO, Ambassador
Istvan Major, here today to extend thanks to Hungary for its
contribution to the ongoing process of China's WTO accession.
</P>
<P>
Major told Long that the Hungarian government holds that the
WTO needs China and the relationship between the WTO and China are
mutually beneficial.
</P>
<P>
Although the talks on China's accession to the WTO are somewhat
difficult, Major pointed out, their ultimate smooth conclusion
will make a significant impact on the formation of world trade and
the existing multilateral trade system itself.
</P>
<P>
Long and his delegation have been in Geneva for a series of
talks since October 5. Earlier this week, he signed agreements
respectively with representatives of the Czech Republic and
Slovakia, ending bilateral talks on market access.
</P>
<P>
During their stay in Geneva, the Chinese delegation also had
bilateral talks with more than 20 developing countries like
Argentina, Brazil, Mexico, India and Indonesia, and some developed
countries like Norway. Most of the countries have been close to
the conclusion of the negotiations over market access with China,

<HEADLINE> OECD, Asia to Rely More on Oil Imports: IEA </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, October 16 (Xinhua) -- The Organization for Economic
Cooperation and Development (OECD) countries and the Asian region
will witness a significant rise in dependence on oil imports in
the coming decade, the International Energy Agency (IEA) said
today.
</P>
<P>
The OECD's dependence on oil imports will not change remarkably
by the year 2000, but will rise considerably over the following
decade, IEA executive director Robert Priddle said at the 15th
World Petroleum Congress here this morning.
</P>
<P>
The OECD will rely on imports to meet around 60 percent of its
total oil demand by 2010, compared to about 50 percent at present,
Priddle said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, since oil production in the developing Asian region is
expected to be sluggish, high oil demand growth there indicates a
sharp increase in their import requirements, he said.
</P>
<P>
The Asian countries currently import around 40 percent of their
oil consumption and the figure is expected to jump to 65 percent
in 2010, Priddle predicted.
</P>
<P>
The bulk of oil imports will come from the Middle East and world
oil supplies will become increasingly reliant on OPEC countries, he
said.
</P>
<P>
"The significant required inflow of oil to Asia from the Middle
East will be a key aspect of world trade patterns and changing
energy security considerations," Priddle said.

the skies over Yunnan on December 20, 1941, and crippled the other
4.
</P>
<P>
The first victory caused them to be known as the "Flying
Tigers", and they became war heroes who have long been remembered
by the Chinese people. The people of Kunming rushed into the
streets to celebrate the victory.
</P>
<P>
Historians say the Flying Tigers played a very important role
in the Allied effort in the Second World War, and were taking on
the supposedly invincible Japanese Air Force, a much stronger
force.
</P>
<P>
Some 56 years later, the local people decorated the streets
with flowers to pay their respect to these war heroes, who had
fought to protect the city. Robert F. Layher, who shot down five
Japanese aircraft, told Xinhua that he continued to think of the
friendly people of Kunming, after having left China for so many
years.
</P>
<P>
He was 24 years old when he left China, but says that Kunming
is becoming younger and more charming 56 years later, although he
has gotten old.
</P>
<P>
He said that it was very impressive to see many high buildings
near the site of the military airport of 56 year ago, where there
used to be bombed-out houses.
</P>
<P>
The visitors will also make a trip to Guilin and to Chongqing,
and tour the Command Office of the U.S. 14th Air Fleet in the
1940s.

BEIJING, October 16 (Xinhua) -- Western multinational
corporations have begun to channel their capital into Central
Asian countries, mainly in local energy industries.
</P>

oil refineries.
</P>
<P>
A Malaysian oil company also signed an agreement to develop

<HEADLINE> Clinton Ends Brazil Visit Without Progress in FTAA Agreement </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
RIO DE JANEIRO, October 15 (Xinhua) -- U.S. President Bill
Clinton ended his visit to Brazil today without making significant
progress in the process of setting up the Free Trade Area of the
Americas (FTAA) even though he managed to reach several accords.
</P>
<P>
Clinton left here for Buenos Aires, capital of Argentina, the
last leg of a week-long trip that also took him to Venezuela and
Brazil. He will return to Washington on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
During Clinton's two-day visit to Brazil, the two countries
signed seven cooperation agreements on education, space,
environment, peaceful use of nuclear energy, the fight against
drug trafficking and the extradition process.
</P>
<P>
But he left unsolved some issues, such as the FTAA and the
U.S. commercial barriers against 100 Brazilian products.
</P>
<P>
At a joint press conference, Brazilian President Fernando
Henrique Cardoso said his country needs time to prepare its
entrance to FTAA, a hemispheric trade bloc proposed for 2005.
</P>
<P>
Brazil fears that the creation of a free trade zone would wreck
its industrial sector, already shaken by a first round of tariff
reductions earlier this decade.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. president said the United States is willing to support
the Southern Common Market (Mercosur) which consists of Brazil,
Argentina, Uruguay and Paraguay.
</P>
<P>
Clinton insisted that Mercosur should not be in contradiction
with the setting up of FTAA.
</P>
<P>
However, the two presidents said they agreed to talk about the
issue in March 1998 in Santiago, Chile, at the 2nd summit of the
Americas.

<HEADLINE> World Oil Demand to Grow 30 Percent by 2010: IEA </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, October 16 (Xinhua) -- World oil demand is expected to
grow by about 30 percent in the 15 years to 2010, the
International Energy Agency (IEA) predicted here today.
</P>
<P>
Oil demand will total between 92 and 97 million barrels a day
in the year 2010, compared to 72 million barrels a day in 1996,
Robert Priddle, executive director of the agency, told the 15th
World Petroleum Congress (WPC) this morning.
</P>
<P>
"The locus of world oil demand growth will be in the non-OECD
countries, with growth rates double those of the OECD," he said.
</P>
<P>
By the year 2010, he noted, the OECD countries will account for
only 50 percent of world oil demand, down from 57 percent at
present.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the demand growth will be mainly driven by the
strong economies of the Asian region, Priddle said, adding that
Asian demand will have doubled from its 1995 level of 11 million
barrels a day to at least 22 million barrels a day.
</P>
<P>
Asian demand will account for over 40 percent of the total
increase in world demand during the same period, with east Asia
expected to take a 25 percent share in world demand growth, he
said.
</P>
<P>
He went on to say that "China alone will account for 13 percent
of global demand growth during the period."
</P>
<P>
"As the major part of energy demand increase will occur outside
the OECD region, the future pattern of energy demand in the
non-OECD countries will be a determining factor of long-term
global energy demand," Priddle said.

<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, October 16 (Xinhua) -- Pakistani President Farooq
Leghari and Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif today reaffirmed their
country's commitment to eradicate poverty, hunger and
malnutrition.
</P>
<P>
In their messages on the occasion of World Food Day, which is
observed today, Leghari and Sharif stressed it has been Pakistan's
continuing effort to attain food self-sufficiency.
</P>
<P>
"This day provides an opportunity to highlight the importance
of food and agriculture and to focus on the vital issue of food
security which is of paramount concern to the entire world," said
Leghari in his message.
</P>
<P>
He noted that Pakistan is essentially an agricultural country
with about two-thirds of its population directly or indirectly
connected with this sector.
</P>
<P>
It has been Pakistan's continuing effort to attain
self-sufficiency in food and also to provide agricultural
surpluses for the world to cater to the ever-rising demand, the
president said.
</P>
<P>
Congratulating the Food and Agriculture Organization of the
United Nations on the 52nd anniversary of its founding, Sharif
said in his message that the selection of the theme "Investing in
Food Security" for this occasion is very appropriate.
</P>
<P>
Sharif said that the government of Pakistan has launched an
"Agricultural Incentive Package" with a view to boosting
agricultural produce by providing various incentives to encourage
both public and private sector investments.
</P>
<P>
As a short-term measure, he said, "we have declared year 1998
as Wheat Year to improve wheat production."
</P>
<P>
"I am sure that these steps will go a long way in providing
food security, on a sustained basis, not only to cater for our
domestic needs but also for the world food grains pool," he said.
</P>
<P>
He described the Food and Agriculture Organization as an active
partner in Pakistan's endeavors to improve both production and
productivity in the agricultural sector.
</P>
<P>
"I am confident that this partnership would continue to our
mutual benefit and will help in resolving the prevalent problem of
hunger and malnutrition in the Third World countries," the prime
minister said.

Diego Maradona claimed on Tuesday here that he would lead a
football players' strike against the new law brought in by the

</P>
<P>
The law led to a two-year suspension for Albeiro Usuriaga of

Another player Diego Latorre said in a television discussion
that the players should get together to discuss the ramifications
of the law and if it was felt necessary then they should strike.
</P>
<P>
Maradona could also face a term in prison after Argentina's
Appeal Court turned down his appeal in September challenging a
four-year prison sentence imposed by a provincial court after
shooting incident,
</P>
<P>
Maradona's offer to do "community service" instead of serve a
prison sentence, was rejected.

<HEADLINE> Consumer Price Index Rises in NZ </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WELLINGTON, October 16 (Xinhua) -- The Consumer Price Index
(CPI) rose 0.5 percent in New Zealand in the third quarter this
year, Statistics NZ announced in a media release received today.
</P>
<P>
The rate is higher than expected, but in line with Reverse Bank
forecasts. It brings the annual inflation rate for the year ending
September 30 to 1 percent, the lowest yearly rise for the past
four and half years.
</P>
<P>
Contributing to most of the quarterly rise were higher housing
costs, which went up 1.4 percent in the quarter. Dearer tobacco
and alcohol were also blamed for the CPI rise.
</P>
<P>
But lower mortgage costs, which fell 1.7 percent in the three
months, partly offset the rise, Statistics NZ said.
</P>
<P>
Commenting on the figures, economists predicted that interest
rates and the NZ dollar might continue to ease in the coming
months.
</P>
<P>
But they cautioned that money borrowers should not expect a big
drop in lending rates after the announcement of the inflation
figures.

<HEADLINE> Vehicle Sales Decline in Philippines </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, October 16 (Xinhua) -- Total sales of vehicles in the
Philippines dropped 2.86 percent in the first nine months of the
year due to soaring interest rates and depreciation of the peso.
</P>
<P>
Auto sales from January to September of the year fell to
116,490 units from 119,992 in the same period of last year, latest
data released by the Chamber of Automotive Manufacturers showed.
</P>
<P>
Sales of passenger cars went down 7.2 percent while commercial
vehicle sales fell 2.4 percent, according to the data.
</P>
<P>
The high cost of borrowing money in the country and the weak
peso jacked up production costs and made the cost of leasing a
motor vehicle prohibitive, it said.
</P>
<P>
The auto industry's biggest loser was Toyota Motor Philippines
Corp., which suffered a 16.5-percent sales drop to 25,408 units
from 30,427 units it sold in the first nine months of 1996.

<HEADLINE> Pak Confirms Benazir's Swiss Bank Accounts Blocked </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, October 15 (Xinhua) -- The Swiss authorities have
blocked accounts worth 13.7 million U.S. dollars belonging to
former Pakistani Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto and her family
members, a senior official confirmed here today.
</P>
<P>
The Swiss authorities also froze the accounts of "at least six
other companies of Benazir and her husband, Asif Ali Zardari,"
said Saif-ur-Rehman, chairman of Ehtesab (anti-corruption) Cell of
the Prime Minister Secretariat.
</P>
<P>
"The blockade has been the result of the efforts of the Ehtesab
Cell team which has worked day and night for 15 days in
Switzerland and provided the authorities there with solid proofs
that they siphoned off money from Pakistan," he said.
</P>
<P>
He said the cell has further documentary evidence against
Bhutto and her family members that "they transferred the money to
foreign banks through illegal means."
</P>
<P>
Earlier today, reports from Geneva, Switzerland, said the Swiss
authorities had blocked bank accounts belonging to Benazir and her
relatives containing around 20 million Swiss francs (about 13.7
million dollars).
</P>
<P>
The reports quoted a spokesman for the Bern Police Ministry,
Folco Galli, as saying that "there is a possibility that other
Bhutto accounts would be frozen."
</P>
<P>
"It depends on whether we get more information from Pakistan.
It's not excluded we'll freeze more money," the spokesman said.

<HEADLINE> Gene Factor in Brain Development Discovered </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW YORK, October 15 (Xinhua) -- A unique interaction between
proteins produced by two genes is believed to play a key role in
normal brain development, according to a team of U.S. scientists.
</P>
<P>
The discovery of the genes, called mdab1 and reelin, may help
in the search for cancer cures and more effective treatments for
brain disorders, said scientists at the Tennessee-based St. Jude
Children's Research Hospital.
</P>
<P>
Their findings are carried by the Nature magazine in its latest
issue, the hospital reported today.
</P>
<P>
According to the findings, mdab1 is in brain cells while reelin
acts as a guidepost outside brain cells. Their interaction results
in a signal relay activated insided cells, allowing intercellular
communication or brain development to proceed.
</P>
<P>
For the brain to develop normally, newly generated neurons in
the cerebral cortex must migrate outward, past layers of
preexisting cells. When this process is disrupted, the brain fails
to become fully organized, the scientists believed.
</P>
<P>
The report suggests that mutations in one of both of the mdab1
and reelin genes are at least partially responsible for the
devastating effects arising from abnormal brain development.
</P>
<P>
Brain disorders like schizophrenia and childhood epilepsy are
possibly caused by mutations of these genes.
</P>
<P>
The scientists said their findings are based on biochemical
studies of mice which have identical phenotypes and mutations in
these genes.

<HEADLINE> CIA Budgets 26.6 Billion US Dollars in 1997 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, October 15 (Xinhua) -- The Central Intelligence
Agency (CIA) of the United States disclosed today that it budgeted
26.6 billion U.S. dollars in 1997, the first time for the agency
to declassify its spending on spy in its 50-year operation.
</P>
<P>
"The aggregate amount appropriated for intelligence and
intelligence-related activities for fiscal year 1997 is 26.6
billion dollars," CIA Director George Tenet said in response to a
Freedom of Information lawsuit.
</P>
<P>
About 10 billion dollars of the total goes for tactical
military intelligence, serving battlefield commanders; about 3
billion dollars spends on the CIA itself; the National Security
Agency, which conducts electronic eavesdropping and decoding
operations, gets about 4 billion dollars; the National
Reconnaissance Office, which builds and operates spy satellites,
gets about 6 billion dollars.
</P>
<P>
The rest is divided among a variety of intelligence analysis
agencies such as the National Imagery and Mapping Agency, and
intelligence offices at the FBI, the State Department, the Energy
Department and elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
The spending is smaller than the 34.5 billion dollars in 1989
and is about the average for the last decade of the Cold War.
</P>
<P>
Tenet also said the administration would decide on a
year-by-year basis whether to reveal overall intelligence
spending.

Broader stock measures also slipped as interest rates rose in

ATHENS, October 15 (Xinhua) -- Greek traffic police will step
up efforts to reduce alcohol-related road accidents by extending
breathalyser testing for drunk driving to toll posts along the
national highways throughout the country.

Public Order Minister George Romeos said today that with the

"The point is that we do not support their involvement there,

Pointe Noire, the Congo's oil and economic capital, is the seat

<HEADLINE> Turkey Accused of Aggravating Regional Tensions </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, October 15 (Xinhua) -- Visiting Greek Defense Minister
Akis Tsohatzopoulos today accused Turkey of aggravating regional
tensions, and defended Greek-Cypriot defense cooperation.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a joint press conference together with his Cypriot
counterpart Costas Eliades, Tsohatzopoulos urged the international
community to pressurize Turkey to withdraw its troops from Cyprus.
</P>
<P>
The Greek minister, who was here to review a Cypriot military
exercise jointly participated by Greek naval and air forces,
contended that the Greek-Cypriot defense agreement had not led to
any tension in the region.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus and Greece signed in 1993 a defense pact, under which
Greece would provide Cyprus with military assistance in case the
island was attacked.
</P>
<P>
He said that Greece and Cyprus would again launch joint
military exercises next year.
</P>
<P>
Greece and Turkey, both members of the North Atlantic Treaty
Organization, have long been at odds over a number of issues
concerning the Aegean Sea as well as Cyprus.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus' defense minister told reporters that the defense
cooperation between Cyprus and Greece was irreversible, unless the
demilitarization of the island was agreed upon or the Cyprus
problem was resolved.
</P>
<P>
Eliades said that Cyprus was ready and determined to face any
situation or threat posed by Turkey.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus has been divided since 1974 when Turkish troops seized
the northern third following an abortive pro-Athens coup by Greek
Cypriots.
</P>
<P>
Turkey maintains 35,000 troops in northern Cyprus, which was
declared by Turkish Cypriots in 1983 as the "Turkish Republic of
Northern Cyprus," recognized only by Ankara.

<HEADLINE> Kohl Suggests Future Successor </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LEIPZIG, October 15 (Xinhua) -- German Chancellor Helmut Kohl
today surprisingly made clear that he wants his party's
parliamentary group leader, Wolfgang Schaeuble, to be his future
successor.
</P>
<P>
"It is known to everybody that I hope Schaeuble would once
become chancellor," Kohl said in an television interview at the
end of a three-day congress of his Christian Democratic Union
(CDU) party.
</P>
<P>
But he was also careful not to specify when this should happen.
</P>
<P>
Kohl, who has been German chancellor since 1982, has already
decided to seek an unprecedented fifth term by runing for the next
general elections due in September next year.
</P>
<P>
Schaeuble, 55, has been regarded as Kohl's closest ally and a
strategist behind the chancellor. He has been confined to a
wheelchair since being attacked by a mentally disturbed man at a
1990 election rally.
</P>
<P>
Some analysts suggested that by announcing Schaeuble as his
future successor, Kohl might not prepare to serve a full four-year
term if being re-elected next year.
</P>
<P>
In reaction to Kohl's remarks, the main opposition Social
Democratic Party (SPD) said that Schaeuble did not need to nourish
any hope for the chancellor post because Kohl's party would be
defeated next year.
</P>
<P>
An opinion poll published today by the Frankfurt Allgemeine
newspaper also showed that Kohl's party continued to trail the SPD
in support rates.
</P>
<P>
Kohl, however, said earlier that it was not polls but election
results that counted.
</P>
<P>
Closing the CDU congress in the eastern German city of Leipzig
today, Kohl declared that his party had "an excellent chance" to
win the next elections.
</P>

<HEADLINE> US Acknowledges Difficulties of Doha Summit </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, October 15 (Xinhua) -- The United States today
acknowledged difficulties to make the fourth Middle East economic
summit a real summit because of the deadlocked Middle East peace
process.
</P>
<P>
"We do recognize reality. And the reality is that in the
absence of continued improvements in the Middle East peace
process, it will be difficult to get the best possible summit,"
State Department spokesman James Rubin said at a regular briefing.
</P>
<P>
The fourth Middle East economic summit, scheduled for November
16-18 in Doha, the Qatar capital, was intended by the United
States to pull Arab nations and Israel together to strengthen
their economic relations.
</P>
<P>
But some Arab nations made it clear during U.S. Secretary of
State Madeleine Albright's visit to the region that whether and at
what level they would attend the conference would be determined by
progress in U.S.-sponsored Israeli-Palestinian peace talks, which
went aground in March when Israel started construction of Jewish
housing units in Arab East Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
Rubin told reporters that a conference steering committee met
Tuesday in Washington to discuss preparations for the summit, with
delegations from Qatar, Egypt, Tunisia, Russia, Jordan, Morocco,
Israel, Canada, the European Union and Japan.
</P>
<P>
"Representatives affirmed participation in the event and
discussed logistical preparations. It was a productive meeting,"
Rubin said.
</P>
<P>
But he said he did not think all countries had yet decided at
what level they would be represented, although some foreign
ministers were expected. Albright also plans to attend.
</P>
<P>
He believed Saudi Arabia, which has been critical of the
summit, would have "some kind" of representation there.
</P>
<P>
U.S. Middle East mediator Dennis Ross has been shuttling
between Israel and Arab nations in recent days in an effort to
revive peace talks between Israel and the Palestinians, and he
will leave for the region again at the weekend to continue his
difficult mission.
</P>
<P>
Rubin said he hoped Ross's effort and Albright's Middle East
trip could improve the situation there and thus "improve the
representation (at Doha) and therefore improve the success of the
conference."
