<HEADLINE> Path of Furrow's Gun </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	The path of a 9 mm Glock Model 26 semiautomatic pistol that  
police say Buford O. Furrow Jr. used to kill a postal worker in 
California: 
</P>
<P>
	--Purchased from Glock Inc. in 1996 by the Cosmopolis, Wash.,  
police department. The gun didn't meet their needs, so department 
officials traded the weapons for a larger Glock of similar value 
from Don's Gun Shop in Cosmopolis. 
</P>
<P>
	--The gun shop's records show the gun was sold to David Wright of  
Aberdeen, Wash. After owning it for two years, Wright asked gun 
collector Andy Palmer to sell it for him at a gun show. 
</P>
<P>
	--The Glock's paper trail ends at the gun show because sales  
between private individuals are unregulated. 
</P>
<P>
	--On Aug. 10, the gun was used to shoot Los Angeles postal worker  
Joseph Santos Ileto nine times. Authorities say Furrow used another 
weapon in a shooting rampage that injured five at a Jewish 
community center.

<HEADLINE> Puerto Ricans Demand Pardons </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SAN JUAN, Puerto Rico (AP) -- Shouting ``Freedom for the  
patriots!'', thousands of Puerto Ricans marched in San Juan on 
Sunday to demand that President Clinton give unconditional pardons 
to 16 independence fighters jailed for sedition. 
</P>
<P>
	The demonstrators carried photos of the activists, members of  
the Armed Forces for National Liberation (FALN) and the Macheteros 
guerrilla groups. The two organizations carried out more than 130 
bomb attacks in the United States between 1974 and 1983 to demand 
independence for this Caribbean territory. 
</P>
<P>
	Trucks with loudspeakers blared patriotic music as marchers  
guided floats through San Juan's banking district to a rally in 
front of the U.S. Federal Building. A protester costumed as the 
Statue of Liberty walked on stilts carrying a Puerto Rican flag and 
photographs of the prisoners. 
</P>
<P>
	``President Clinton should listen to this (protest) and bring  
them home,'' said protesting college student Juan Carlos Colon. 
</P>
<P>
	Police said the demonstration was peaceful.  
</P>
<P>
	Clinton offered on Aug. 11 to reduce the sentences of all 16  
prisoners, including releasing 11. But Clinton demanded that those 
11 ask for clemency in writing, renounce violence, and abide by 
parole conditions that would bar them from meeting with other 
convicted criminals. 
</P>
<P>
	Independence activists say those conditions are humiliating and  
would forbid them from meeting with pro-independence comrades, 
since many activists on the island have criminal records. Twelve 
were convicted in Illinois and four in Connecticut and are jailed 
in prisons in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
	``The (conditions) are onerous, an insult to the dignity of a  
people that has an inalienable right to fight for its liberation,'' 
said Lolita Lebron, who spent 25 years in prison for leading a 
shooting attack on the House of Representatives in 1954. 
</P>
<P>
	In the United States, Clinton's clemency offer has outraged  
victims of the FALN bombings and some politicians. 
</P>
<P>
	U.S. House of Representatives Majority Leader Dick Armey,  
R-Texas, said Sunday that Congress might consider a resolution 
condemning the action. Rep. Dan Burton, R-Ind., said it ``sends the 
wrong signal to terrorists around the world.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In New York City, Mayor Rudolph Giuliani on Friday urged Clinton  
to revoke the offer. The FALN is suspected of planting 49 bombs in 
New York between 1974 and 1977; and in 1975 it bombed Greenwich 
Village's historic Fraunces Tavern, killing four people and 
wounding 60. 
</P>
<P>
	The 3.8 million residents of Puerto Rico, a U.S. territory since  
1898, are U.S. citizens and can be drafted into the military, but 
they cannot vote for president and have no vote in Congress. They 
do not pay federal taxes but receive limited federal benefits. 
</P>
<P>
	Support for independence has waned since the 1980s, when a wave  
of arrests broke up the movement's more radical groups. In a 
December referendum, less than three percent of Puerto Ricans voted 
to become a separate country.

<HEADLINE>  Cowboys Owner Jerry Jones Arrested </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HIGHLAND PARK, Texas (AP) -- Dallas Cowboys owner Jerry Jones was  
arrested Sunday after he drove away with his family before a police 
officer had finished writing a speeding ticket. 
</P>
<P>
	Jones said late Sunday the arrest was a misunderstanding. He  
said he and his family were trying to get to church in time for the 
christening of his grandson. 
</P>
<P>
	Jones was in one vehicle and his family was in a Suburban around  
10:30 a.m. on their way to church services. Jones' employees drove 
both vehicles. 
</P>
<P>
	Highland Park Police Chief Darrell Fant said an officer pulled  
over the Suburban for going 45 mph in a 30 mph zone. 
</P>
<P>
	The car carrying Jones was not stopped, but his driver also  
pulled over. Jones went to where an officer was questioning the 
driver of the other car, in which Jones' mother, mother-in-law and 
several other family members were riding. 
</P>
<P>
	``He said he was in a rush and asked if he could go ahead and  
take the family members on to church. The officer told him, `I'll 
just be a minute. I'll do this as fast as I can.' He made some 
remark and then did not follow the order of the officer and took 
the vehicle anyway,'' Fant told WFAA-TV. 
</P>
<P>
	The Cowboys released a statement during their exhibition game  
Sunday night with the Denver Broncos. 
</P>
<P>
	``I am sorry this has become an issue,'' Jones said. ``This  
matter occurred because of my very sincere effort to get all of my 
family to the christening of our grandson.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Jones said he understood the matter was being handled by the  
police officer, the Suburban driver and the driver of his car, whom 
he said he had asked to stay behind at the scene of the citation. 
</P>
<P>
	Officials said the officer radioed ahead and another police  
vehicle tried to pull Jones over, but he did not stop. 
</P>
<P>
	With the police vehicle following at a slow pace, Jones  
proceeded to the Highland Park United Methodist Church on the 
Southern Methodist University campus, about a mile from where the 
traffic stop took place. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was after the Suburban was unloaded that I became aware of  
a police officer who had pulled behind me while I was unloading,'' 
Jones said. 
</P>
<P>
	To avoid further traffic congestion and confusion, Jones said,  
he drove away from the church and into the first available private 
driveway to answer any questions the officer might have had. 
</P>
<P>
	WFAA said Jones was taken to the Highland Park Department of  
Public Safety. Shortly later, Jones' youngest son, Jerry Jones Jr., 
was seen pacing outside, talking on a cell phone. A while later, a 
car with the two inside pulled out of a back parking lot of the 
police station, tires squealing. 
</P>
<P>
	Jones was charged with fleeing the scene, a Class B misdemeanor  
punishable by up to a $2,000 fine and six months in jail. 
</P>
<P>
	Two years ago, Jones fined Barry Switzer, then the Cowboys head  
coach, $75,000 for his arrest on a gun charge, saying he wanted to 
show he was serious about repairing the Cowboys' tarnished image. 
</P>
<P>
	Switzer had a loaded .38-caliber pistol in his luggage at  
Dallas-Fort Worth International Airport. Switzer said he put the 
gun in his bag to hide it from children visiting his home, but 
forgot to remove it before going to the airport. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have to send the message that we really do get it,'' Jones  
said at the time he fined Switzer. ``That although you make a 
mistake, it still can very negatively impact a lot of people in our 
organization.''

<HEADLINE> Indonesia Bank Bali Probe Too Slow </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SINGAPORE (AP) -- An investigation into a corruption scandal at  
Indonesia's Bank Bali is progressing too slowly and will be 
extended to the country's central bank, a senior World Bank 
official said Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	Indonesian authorities have given PriceWaterhouseCoopers the  
go-ahead to audit Bank Indonesia, the country's central bank, 
</P>
<P>
	``The government auditing body has given PriceWaterhouseCoopers  
the mandate to investigate'' Bank Indonesia, the country's central 
bank, said Jean-Michel Severino, the World Bank's vice president 
for East Asia and the Pacific. 
</P>
<P>
	Official investigations have so far been ``too slow -- that is  
why the pressure has increased,'' Severino said on the sidelines of 
a conference in Singapore. 
</P>
<P>
	The scandal broke last month after an audit found that Bank  
Bali's directors had used government bailout money to pay a $80 
million fee to a debt collection company controlled by the ruling 
Golkar Party's deputy treasurer. 
</P>
<P>
	Golkar opponents allege the money -- which has since been  
returned -- was intended to bankroll Indonesian President B.J. 
Habibie's campaign to remain in power when an electoral college 
selects the next head of state in November. 
</P>
<P>
	The disclosure of the affair caused an uproar, unnerving  
investors in the currency and equity markets for weeks. 
</P>
<P>
	The World Bank earlier threatened to halt funding for Indonesia  
if it doesn't swiftly and satisfactorily conclude an investigation. 
</P>
<P>
	Last week, the IMF called for an audit of the central bank to  
ascertain how the funds were lost. 
</P>
<P>
	Bank Indonesia's Deputy Gov. Miranda Goltom said that the  
government is fully aware of the concerns shown by the 
international agencies regarding the investigation and will do 
anything within the law to ensure the investigation is fair and 
transparent. 
</P>
<P>
	Habibie's government will make a statement on the progress of  
the investigation in Parliament Sept. 4, said Severino, who was in 
Singapore for a 14-nation ``Manila Framework'' conference of 
finance and central bank officials.

<HEADLINE> Furrow Attorney May Claim Insanity </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- How does a lawyer defend a case that seems  
indefensible? 
</P>
<P>
	The problem may prove especially vexing in the trial of Buford  
O. Furrow Jr., the white supremacist who allegedly confessed to 
shooting up a Jewish community center full of children, then 
killing a Filipino-American postman -- all in the name of hate. 
</P>
<P>
	Furrow now sits in prison. Finding a jury to judge him  
dispassionately will be a daunting challenge. 
</P>
<P>
	Surprisingly, finding a lawyer for his federal trial was  
relatively easy. With no money to pay his own counsel, Furrow 
became a client of the federal public defender's office, perhaps 
the best representation he could have hoped for. 
</P>
<P>
	With intimate knowledge of the federal system and wide  
experience with unpopular defendants, federal public defenders have 
the resources to handle cases that many private lawyers might avoid 
for personal or professional reasons. 
</P>
<P>
	``All of these cases are hard,'' said Quinn Denvir, the chief  
federal public defender in Sacramento who represented Unabomber 
Theodore Kaczynski. ``There are always victims and a lot of 
sadness. But that's what we sign on for. You don't focus on your 
feelings. You have a job to be done and you do it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Denvir, like others, suspects some form of mental illness  
defense will be offered for Furrow, who turned himself into the FBI 
in Las Vegas the day after the shooting. He allegedly told 
authorities the shooting was ``a wake-up call to America to kill 
Jews.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Furrow had tried to check himself into a mental hospital near  
Seattle last year but wound up pulling a knife on staff members and 
went to jail for second-degree assault. 
</P>
<P>
	Because of the alleged confession and the overwhelming evidence  
in the case -- and because both the state and federal charges carry 
the death penalty -- Denvir said lawyers could have one overriding 
consideration: ``Maybe all you try to do is save his life.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The federal public defender's office in Los Angeles has assigned  
one of its top attorneys, Deputy Public Defender Sean Kennedy, to 
represent Furrow. Senior Litigator Marilyn Bednarski has joined the 
effort and more lawyers may be coming on board. 
</P>
<P>
	The U.S. Attorney's office has assigned a veteran of its major  
crimes unit, Michael Terrell, to the case along with the head of 
the civil rights division, Michael Gennaco. 
</P>
<P>
	Although the only crime now involved in the federal case is the  
killing of Filipino postman, Joseph Ileto, the government could add 
hate crimes allegations that would encompass the Aug. 10 shooting 
that wounded five people, including three children, at the Jewish 
Community Center in suburban Granada Hills. 
</P>
<P>
	Furrow faces state charges of attempted murder in that shooting.  
</P>
<P>
	The law offers Furrow assorted potential defenses, but Laurie  
Levenson, Loyola University Law School associate dean, said the 
only viable one is a claim of mental illness. Whether he wants to 
invoke such a claim is unknown. 
</P>
<P>
	The public defender's office declined comment on strategy. With  
Furrow's post-indictment arraignment set for Monday, they see the 
case as barely at the starting gate. 
</P>
<P>
	``The available defenses are insanity and diminished capacity or  
lack of intent,'' said Levenson. ``Everything else is implausible. 
There is no alibi; it was not self-defense.'' 
</P>
<P>
	She said that Furrow's confession to the FBI makes it impossible  
to argue that he was not involved unless he can prove the 
confession was coerced, and physical evidence found in his van 
seems to link him to the crimes. 
</P>
<P>
	``His only hope is a mental defense,'' she said. ``Or he can  
plead guilty and go directly to the penalty phase.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ira Glasser, executive director of the American Civil Liberties  
Union in New York, said the legal defense of white supremacists is 
familiar territory for the ACLU. To preserve the rights of many, 
the rights of the most unpopular must be protected, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	``Lawyers represent people all the time whom they wouldn't enjoy  
inviting home for dinner,'' Glasser said. ``It goes against human 
nature to defer your disgust. But it's for larger principles.''

<HEADLINE> Y2K Expert Warns of Minor Problems </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Americans should keep a supply of food and  
water on hand and save their bank records, but they needn't worry 
about major disruptions -- or inadvertent nuclear war -- when 
computer clocks reach the year 2000, the White House's top official 
on the Y2K problem says. 
</P>
<P>
	The federal government's computer systems have been fixed, the  
nation's aviation and railroad systems are safe, power grids and 
communications systems will hold and banks are in good shape, John 
Koskinen, President Clinton's chief Y2K adviser, said Sunday on 
CNN's ``Late Edition'' 
</P>
<P>
	The administration is satisfied that only humans, not computers,  
could launch nuclear weapons, he said. The one concern -- that 
Russia's early warning systems would fail and leave the Russians in 
a heightened state of anxiety -- was being addressed, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	But Koskinen said Americans shouldn't become too complacent,  
because some local communities are lagging behind in ensuring their 
utility and communications systems are ready. ``We are worried 
about some of the smaller or not so small educational facilities, 
some health care facilities,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	He said his office is encouraging Americans to contact local  
utilities and other public services to make sure they are working 
on any Y2K problems. 
</P>
<P>
	Americans should also take commonsense precautions, including  
saving financial records and making sure they have battery-powered 
flashlights and radios and a three-day supply of water and food. 
``It's going to be a long weekend in the middle of winter,'' he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Koskinen said Americans should also note future State Department  
assessments about the risks of traveling to foreign countries, 
because they will include updates on possible Y2K-related 
disruptions. 
</P>
<P>
	Developed countries are generally doing well in fixing  
computers, but some developing countries lack the resources and 
time to get ready before Jan. 1. 
</P>
<P>
	The concern is that many computers that use only two digits to  
read dates will mistake the year 2000, or ``00,'' as 1900, causing 
computers to malfunction or break down. 
</P>
<P>
	The good news is that 99 percent of banks, including smaller  
ones, are ready, Koskinen said, and a report next month will say 
that 95 percent of the mission-critical computer systems in the 
federal government are Y2K compliant.

<HEADLINE> Libya-Iraq Match Marred by Rioting </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	AMMAN, Jordan (AP) -- Police fired tear gas and beat Libyan fans  
with clubs Sunday after violence broke out with Libya on the verge 
of losing a soccer match to Iraq in the Arab Games. 
</P>
<P>
	With five minutes left in the match, fans ripped out seats and  
threw them on the field. 
</P>
<P>
	About 45 people including some policemen, sustained minor  
injuries and were given first aid, according to Dr. Bassem Tamimi 
at Al Bashir Hospital. None of the injured, identified as being 
from Libya and Jordan, required hospitalization. 
</P>
<P>
	As the referee suspended the game, police moved in and cleared  
the stands. Fans were seen scuffling with police, and at least one 
policeman was seen clutching his head. 
</P>
<P>
	After about 10 minutes, the referee blew the final whistle and  
awarded the match to Iraq with the score at 3-1. Libyan players 
embraced their Iraqi counterparts and applauded when the decision 
was announced. 
</P>
<P>
	Policemen chased fans away from the stands and hundreds more  
officers, many with dogs, ringed the stadium outside. 
</P>
<P>
	Scuffles also broke out in the field between security forces and  
soccer officials wearing Libya's green track suits. Many fans were 
seen attacking television cameramen. One spectator scuffled with a 
policeman, trying to snatch his club. Other men rushed in and beat 
the spectator. 
</P>
<P>
	During the trouble, policemen led Libyan leader Moammar  
Gadhafi's son, Al-Saadi Gadhafi, out of the stands along with his 
aides. Television commentators said he was being removed for his 
own safety. Gadhafi earlier got into an altercation with security 
forces who were standing in front of him. 
</P>
<P>
	Similar rioting occurred during Libya's match against the  
Palestinian territories Wednesday. At least 20 people, including 
three Palestinian players, were hospitalized.

<HEADLINE> Storm, Evacuations Thwart Vacations </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	RODANTHE, N.C. (AP) -- Hundreds of cars streamed off Hatteras  
Island on Sunday ahead of Hurricane Dennis after officials issued 
an evacuation order, fearful that people could be trapped if the 
storm made roads impassable. 
</P>
<P>
	The evacuation threw into turmoil vacation plans like those of  
nine people who had planned a week in this Outer Banks village. 
</P>
<P>
	Liz Schramm of Hackettstown, N.J., and her sister Ellen Jahns of  
Richmond, Va., and seven others -- husbands, children and relatives 
-- leaned on their cars in a parking lot as they pondered what to 
do. 
</P>
<P>
	``We can't get there from here,'' Schramm said of the beachfront  
house the family had planned to rent in Rodanthe, the first village 
on Hatteras Island. 
</P>
<P>
	``Now, we're trying to decide if the island is going to be  
closed for more than a day. So, we've got to decide whether to 
drive back to Virginia or find a motel.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The family's vacation was the victim of an evacuation order for  
22,000 residents and visitors on Hatteras and Ocracoke islands 
because of Dennis. State troopers have not set up road blocks on 
the island, so visitors can still drive there despite being unable 
to check into hotels or rented homes. No evacuations were ordered 
for northern beach towns on the Outer Banks. 
</P>
<P>
	Officials were concerned that wind-driven water could wash sand  
over portions of N.C. 12, the only north-south road on the island, 
and trap people trying to flee if Dennis came near. 
</P>
<P>
	Officials estimated as many as 20,000 people on Hatteras,  
including 8,000 permanent residents, and as many as 2,400 on 
Ocracoke, could be in Dennis' way. 
</P>
<P>
	In Rodanthe, rental beach houses were empty, as were parking  
lots at businesses that normally would be booming on the weekend 
before Labor Day weekend, one of the busiest times of the summer. 
</P>
<P>
	While tourists fled the lower Outer Banks, merchant and county  
commissioner Mac Midgett fumed about the evacuation, saying it came 
too soon. The parking lot of his convenience store and restaurant 
were nearly empty, but had been packed a day earlier with surfers 
enjoying waves. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think it's the stupidest thing I've seen,'' said Midgett,  
who was born here in 1940 and has been through scores of storms. 
``I don't want anybody to get hurt, but why don't they start 
(evacuating) at Southern Shore and work south so these people won't 
run into traffic?''

<HEADLINE> Britons Unsure How To Remember Diana </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LONDON (AP) -- As the second anniversary of Princess Diana's  
death approaches, Britain seems uncertain about how to commemorate 
the date -- or whether to mark it at all. 
</P>
<P>
	No official memorials are planned Tuesday, in contrast to last  
year's anniversary, when the royal family held a prayer service and 
London's Westminster and St. Paul's cathedrals staged special 
services for the public. 
</P>
<P>
	At Kensington Palace, once the focus of extraordinary public  
grief, it will be business as usual. The book of condolences has 
been put away and the state rooms and gift shop will be open to 
tourists. 
</P>
<P>
	``(Public interest) has died down an awful lot -- remarkably,  
actually,'' said Rachel Whitburn, the palace's press officer. 
``Though there may well still be a few bunches of flowers left at 
the front gates.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Prince Charles and Diana's sons, Princes William and Harry, will  
attend private prayers on Sunday at Crathie Church near Queen 
Elizabeth II's Balmoral estate in Scotland, but the royal family 
plans nothing formal on the day of the anniversary. 
</P>
<P>
	Earl Spencer plans a private gathering Tuesday at Althorp House,  
the family estate where his sister is buried, but the vicar of the 
local parish has decided not to hold an anniversary service this 
year. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think people move on,'' said David Horton-Fawkes, manager of  
Althorp House. ``It is a natural process. They don't make a 
decision to move on, it just happens.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Visitors touring Kensington Palace recently seemed to approve of  
the scaled-down approach. 
</P>
<P>
	``For whatever reason, it was an amazing event at the time. But  
at this stage, it's just maudlin to carry on,'' said Kennedy 
Andrews, a tourist from Winnipeg, Canada. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's not necessary to commemorate it every year,'' said  
another tourist, Judy Dobles of New York City. ``People should just 
celebrate it in their own way.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Last year, 147,000 paying visitors made the pilgrimage to  
Althorp. This year, final attendance is expected to be somewhat 
lower, at 142,000, when the gates close for the year Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	The Althorp Web site also has seen a slide in interest, with  
about 470,000 visitors in July 1998, compared with about 360,000 
last month. 
</P>
<P>
	That mirrors the decline in donations to the Diana, Princess of  
Wales Memorial Fund. The charity has collected more than $159 
million since its inception but, after the initial outpouring, 
donations have leveled off. They are now about $48,000 a month, 
down from $110,000 a month in August 1998. 
</P>
<P>
	Seventy percent of revenue is now derived from royalties on  
merchandise sales. 
</P>
<P>
	In the past weeks, Britain's Mirror tabloid newspaper has been  
trying to drum up public support for a permanent Diana memorial, 
attempting to shame the royal family with a front-page photo of the 
queen's elaborate stone memorials for her dogs. 
</P>
<P>
	The Mirror claims to have had 60,000 calls of support, but it's  
unclear just how much public appetite exists for such a monument. 
</P>
<P>
	A special memorial committee set up last year had proposed a  
commemorative garden near Diana's former Kensington Palace home 
but, after local residents vociferously objected, the plan was 
quietly and indefinitely put on hold. 
</P>
<P>
	The only official commemorations are a coin bearing Diana's  
likeness and a few community service and charity awards and 
projects established in her name. 
</P>
<P>
	New York City resident Leon Zervas, also touring Kensington  
Palace, said he believed tourists would appreciate a monument as a 
focal point to pay their respects, along with a memorial service to 
dedicate it. 
</P>
<P>
	``She was a very generous person. She gave to the poor and we  
don't have enough people like that,'' he said. ``People like her 
should be remembered with monuments. We already have enough statues 
of military leaders.''

</P>
<P>
	WAKE FOREST, N.C. (AP) -- The Rev. Olin T. Binkley, a former  
president of Southeastern Baptist Theological Seminary who spoke 
out for racial integration early in the civil rights era, died 
Friday. He was 91. 
</P>
<P>
	Binkley, a Yale Divinity School graduate, served as president of  
the Southern Baptist school from 1963 until his retirement in 1974. 
He was also president of the Association of Theological Schools in 
the United States and Canada from 1964-66. 
</P>
<P>
	Binkley served at Chapel Hill Baptist Church from 1933-38.  
</P>
<P>
	He later taught at Wake Forest College and Southern Baptist  
Theological Seminary in Louisville, Ky. before coming to 
Southeastern Seminary in 1952. He became the dean of faculty in 
1958. 
</P>
<P>
	Members of Chapel Hill Baptist Church, inspired by Binkley's  
stand on civil rights, formed a new congregation in 1958 dedicated 
to integration and named it in his honor, said the Rev. Jim Pike, a 
Binkley church pastor. 
</P>
<P>
	Olin T. Binkley Baptist Church was expelled from the Southern  
Baptist Convention and Baptist State Convention in 1992 for giving 
a preaching license to gay divinity student.

<P>
	PHILADELPHIA (AP) -- David Kipnis, a former Temple University  
social psychology professor popular for his work on the uses of 
power and how technology affects society, died Friday from 
congestive heart failure. He was 74. 
</P>
<P>
	Kipnis' influence in the psychology world spanned three books  
about power and technology and several articles in such 
publications as the Journal of Applied Psychology and Psychology 
Today. 
</P>
<P>
	After retiring from Temple in 1986, he retained his office at  
the university and continued to write. 
</P>
<P>
	Kipnis' son Elliot said he thought his father's interest in  
social psychology developed after a long recovery in the hospital 
after being injured in World War II. He served in the Army and 
participated in the Normandy invasion. A few months later he was 
severely wounded in the right leg by a grenade. 
</P>
<P>
	Kipnis began his career at Temple in 1967 as an associate  
professor of psychology. From 1983 to 1986, he served as chairman 
of the psychology department.

</P>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Wallace Rosenwach, builder of rooftop water  
tanks that dot Manhattan's skyline, died Aug. 23 after a brief 
illness. He was 77. 
</P>
<P>
	Rosenwach, who inherited his grandfather's Rosenwach Tank  
Company, stunned the competition by constructing water tanks in 
just 10 hours, a fraction of the time residents used to have to go 
without water while their tanks were replaced. 
</P>
<P>
	The mini wooden silos perched atop hundreds of New York  
buildings are capped with tin hats that look like upside-down 
funnels. They're a crucial part of city life, storing at least 
8,500 gallons of water and ensuring that occupants of higher floors 
have proper water pressure. They cost around $25,000. 
</P>
<P>
	Sometimes the tanks aren't just for water. Rosenwach once built  
a two-story version for a customer to live in, and used to supply 
them to winemakers as well.

<HEADLINE> Barak Renews Lebanon Troops Pledge </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	JERUSALEM (AP) -- Prime Minister Ehud Barak told his command  
staff he still intends to withdraw Israeli soldiers from southern 
Lebanon within a year, his office said Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	During a recent briefing, Barak -- a former military chief -- said  
that in the meantime he expected the army to continue to protect 
Israeli towns along the northern border with Lebanon. 
</P>
<P>
	On Sunday, Israeli warplanes and ground troops attacked  
suspected guerrilla hideouts in Lebanon and the Israel-allied 
militia shelled a village, Lebanese security officials said. A 
rebel was killed and six people, including five civilians, were 
wounded. 
</P>
<P>
	Barak won May elections campaigning for a withdrawal from  
Lebanon within a year -- a plan his opponent, then-Prime Minister 
Benjamin Netanyahu, said was unrealistic. 
</P>
<P>
	All parties believe Syria, the powerbroker in Lebanon, is key to  
a withdrawal because it is the only side able to contain the 
guerrillas fighting Israel in southern Lebanon. Peace talks between 
Israel and Syria broke down in 1996. 
</P>
<P>
	Barak told his Cabinet on Sunday that it was only ``a matter of  
weeks until a formula will be struck for the renewal of talks with 
the Syrians,'' a statement said. 
</P>
<P>
	Syria has welcomed Barak's recent efforts to restart the peace  
process, and his apparent willingness to cede land on the strategic 
Golan Heights, which Israel captured in 1967. 
</P>
<P>
	Israel carved out a ``security zone'' in southern Lebanon in  
1985 to protect settlements along its border from attack by 
anti-Israel groups, including the Iranian-backed Hezbollah 
guerrillas. 
</P>
<P>
	Since then about 250 soldiers have died in southern Lebanon.  
Many Israelis -- among them, leaders of Barak's Labor Party -- argue 
that the cost of securing the zone is too high and the northern 
settlements are defensible from the international border. 
</P>
<P>
	Israeli jets fired two air-to-surface missiles Sunday at a  
valley near the villages of Yater and Kafra, nine miles southeast 
of the port city of Tyre, Lebanese security officials said, 
speaking on customary condition of anonymity. One Hezbollah fighter 
was killed and another was wounded, they said. 
</P>
<P>
	An Israeli army statement said the air force attacked  
``terrorist targets'' in the Kafra area before returning safely to 
base. 
</P>
<P>
	The airstrike came less than two hours after Hezbollah  
guerrillas opened fire on an Israeli position near the border that 
faces the villages, according to a Hezbollah statement issued in 
Beirut. 
</P>
<P>
	More than a dozen mortar shells from the Israel-allied South  
Lebanon Army hit the village of Mansouri, six miles north of 
Israel's border, following attacks in the area by pro-Syrian Amal 
guerrillas. Four civilians suffered shrapnel injuries, Lebanese 
officials said. 
</P>
<P>
	They also said a 50-year-old woman was wounded near the village  
of Yohmor by sniper fire from Israeli forces. 
</P>
<P>
	A 1996 agreement between Israel and guerrillas to spare  
civilians frequently has been violated.

<HEADLINE> NC State 23, No. 17 Texas 20 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	AUSTIN, Texas (AP) -- There is life in North Carolina State after  
Torry Holt. It's just on the other side of the ball. 
</P>
<P>
	North Carolina State continued its tear of early-season upsets  
Saturday night, using three blocked punts and a stingy second-half 
defense to pull out a 23-20 victory over No. 17 Texas in the Black 
Coaches Association Classic. 
</P>
<P>
	Terrence Holt, younger brother of the departed All-American wide  
receiver, blocked one punt and scored a touchdown on another for 
North Carolina State. 
</P>
<P>
	With the Wolfpack trailing 20-15 with 3:32 left in the game,  
Holt sprinted in from the right side to get a piece of Ryan Long's 
punt. Eric Leak, who blocked a punt in the first half that led to a 
safety, picked up the loose ball and ran 48 yards for the go-ahead 
touchdown. 
</P>
<P>
	With NC State leading 21-20, quarterback Jamie Barnette found  
Chris Coleman in the corner of the end zone for the 2-point 
conversion. 
</P>
<P>
	Texas drove to midfield looking for a possible tying field goal,  
but came up short when Applewhite was stuffed on fourth-and-inches. 
</P>
<P>
	Texas played its first game in four years without Division I-A  
career rushing leader Ricky Williams. Applewhite passed for 316 
yards and one touchdown and ran for one. 
</P>
<P>
	NC State pulled off its third early-season upset in as many  
years after victories over Syracuse 1997 and Florida State in 1998. 
It also was NC State coach Mike O'Cain's first victory over Texas 
coach Mack Brown. O'Cain was 0-5 against Brown's North Carolina 
teams.

<HEADLINE> V.Williams a Favorite To Win Open </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Venus Williams is ready to win the U.S. Open.  
</P>
<P>
	``I've been ready since the first time,'' she said.  
</P>
<P>
	That was two years ago, when she made her U.S. Open debut and  
landed spectacularly in the final -- only to fall victim to the 
pressure and the near perfect play of top-ranked Martina Hingis. 
</P>
<P>
	``I guess it wasn't the right time,'' Williams said.  
</P>
<P>
	The right time might be now.  
</P>
<P>
	Williams cast herself as the favorite with a straight-sets  
thrashing Saturday of reigning U.S. Open and Wimbledon champion 
Lindsay Davenport in the final of a tune-up tournament in New 
Haven, Conn. 
</P>
<P>
	``In the past, Lindsay overpowered me,'' the 19-year-old  
Williams said. ``But I've gotten older and stronger, and I have 
better technique.'' 
</P>
<P>
	That was evident in Williams' blistering groundstrokes, huge  
serves and quicker court coverage, all too much for the 23-year-old 
Davenport to handle. 
</P>
<P>
	``Venus is going to be tough to beat,'' Davenport said of  
Williams' chances at the Open. ``She's athletic and extremely fast. 
Those are some great assets to have.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Williams, who has won five titles this year, will enter the Open  
at a career- best No. 3 ranking. 
</P>
<P>
	Though there will be four former U.S. Open champions -- Hingis,  
Davenport, Monica Seles and Arantxa Sanchez-Vicario -- in the field 
when play starts Monday, Williams now knows she has the game and 
disposition to beat them all. Just as important, her rivals know 
it, too. 
</P>
<P>
	Williams, who routed Seles before taking on Davenport in New  
Haven, has overcome her tendency to rush on the court and succumb 
to a flurry of errors. She doesn't let the pressure of big matches 
get to her as much anymore. She has broadened her arsenal to the 
point where she can win with long rallies as confidently as she win 
with her serve. 
</P>
<P>
	The men's draw has all the usual suspects as potential champions  
-- No. 1 Pete Sampras going for his fifth U.S. Open title and a 
record 13th Grand Slam championship; No. 2 Andre Agassi seeking to 
build on his French Open victory and runner-up finish at Wimbledon; 
and Patrick Rafter looking for a third straight U.S. Open win. 
</P>
<P>
	But there are newcomers who could topple any of them, and none  
are more dangerous than the tall young Russian, Marat Safin, who 
faces Sampras in the first round. 
</P>
<P>
	Mark Philippoussis, who played in his first Grand Slam final at  
last year's U.S. Open, withdrew from this year's tournament 
Saturday because of a knee injury. 
</P>
<P>
	Felix Mantilla will be moved into the 11th-seeded Philippoussis'  
place in the draw and will be seeded 17th. 
</P>
<P>
	Philippoussis injured the cartilage in his left knee in June  
during his quarterfinal match at Wimbledon with Sampras. After 
resting for about six weeks, he returned at Indianapolis two weeks 
ago and lost his first match. He withdrew from the Hamlet Cup last 
week. 
</P>
<P>
	Last year, in the first all-Australian men's final at the U.S.  
Open since 1970, Philippoussis lost to Rafter in four sets.

<HEADLINE> Appeal by Rabin's Assistant Denied </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	JERUSALEM (AP) -- The Supreme Court rejected an appeal by Yitzhak  
Rabin's assassin Sunday to overturn a conspiracy conviction he 
received together with his brother and a friend, choosing instead 
to stiffen his sentence. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition to the life sentence he received for the  
assassination, Yigal Amir had received a separate, five-year 
sentence for conspiracy to commit the murder and for plotting 
attacks against Arabs. 
</P>
<P>
	On Sunday, the court increased the sentence to eight years. It  
also increased the sentence of his brother Hagai, from 12 to 16 
years for the charge, Court spokesman Moshe Goralli said. The 
sentence of the third man, Dror Adani, was not changed. The three 
were convicted in October 1996. 
</P>
<P>
	Yigal Amir, an extreme right-wing religious Jew, said he wanted  
to put an end to Rabin's peacemaking policies with the Palestinians 
when he fired three bullets into Rabin as he left a peace rally on 
Nov. 4, 1995.

<HEADLINE> Debate Persists Over Net Birthday </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Was the Internet born in 1969? It depends on  
whom you ask. 
</P>
<P>
	On Sept. 2 of that year, the first two machines were connected  
to form ARPANET, the network that grew into the Internet. The same 
principles behind that initial connection remain part of the 
foundation of today's Internet. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is the box out of which the magic genie of the Internet  
came,'' said UCLA professor Len Kleinrock, standing next to the 
first ARPANET computer that was connected inside his lab 30 years 
ago. ``This is where it all began.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Vinton Cerf, an Internet pioneer who is now a vice president at  
MCI Worldcom, disagrees, saying the connection was significant but 
not a birth. 
</P>
<P>
	``There were no other people to connect to. It was like being  
the first guy on the block with a telephone but nobody to talk 
to,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	By the early 1970s, the ARPANET consisted of 10 sites scattered  
across the United States. But it connected different computers -- 
not different networks as meant by the word ``Internet.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``It's like saying in 1776, could you imagine Seattle being the  
kind of city it is today,'' said Bob Kahn, president of the 
Corporation for National Research Initiatives. ``It would have been 
hard when it wasn't even part of the United States.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Kahn and Cerf's 1974 proposal of a protocol that would allow  
ARPANET to talk with other networks also could be considered the 
conception of today's Internet. Their protocol, called TCP/IP, 
became the standard on Jan. 1, 1983 -- another possible birthday.

	Hard To Predict Hurricane's Path  
</P>
<P>
	CHARLESTON, S.C. (AP) -- Hurricane Dennis continued to gather  
might early today on its steady but indeterminate path toward the 
United States after its move through the northern Bahamas. The 
hurricane, which had left the islands heading northwest yesterday 
afternoon, should be packing winds up to 130 mph by Monday, 
forecasters projected. But Dennis' trajectory remained unclear. 
Forecasters said it could make landfall around Tuesday, most likely 
somewhere in the Carolinas, but could also veer away. ``There's 
some glimmer of hope,'' said Jerry Jarrell, director of the 
National Hurricane Center in Miami. ``Some of the models are 
beginning to show that it may miss the coast.''

	West Bank Pullback in Negotiations

	JERUSALEM (AP) -- Israeli and Palestinian negotiators are trying

accord ahead of a visit to the region by U.S. Secretary of State 
Madeleine Albright. Differences over Israel's promised release of 
Palestinian prisoners has been holding up a long-delayed deal to 
turn over more of the West Bank to Yasser Arafat's Palestinian 
Authority. But after yesterday's meetings, the two sides apparently 
have ironed out most of the details to clear the way for Israel's 
withdrawal from 11 percent of the West Bank.

	Ariz. Assessing Abortion Appeal  
</P>
<P>
	PHOENIX (AP) -- A 14-year-old foster girl who says she was raped  
is reportedly expected to travel to Kansas for a late-term abortion 
unless Arizona officials succeed in winning a court ruling to stop 
her. There has been no direct word from the girl because of foster 
care confidentiality requirements and a court seal on the case. 
She's said to be about 24 weeks into the pregnancy now, past the 
stage at which abortions are performed in Arizona. The Arizona 
Republic quoted sources yesterday as saying Gov. Jane Hull had 
changed direction on Thursday about an appeal and had decided to 
have the girl's competency re-evaluated. But a judge on Friday 
reaffirmed his decision to allow the abortion, the newspaper said.

visit. The exiled spiritual leader of the world's Tibetan Buddhists 
also spoke in New York and in Bloomington, Ind., where his brother

	Clinton Puts Indonesia on Notice

<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Clinton put Indonesia on notice that

administration spokesman said yesterday. ``We expect a free, fair 
and credible election,'' National Security Council spokesman David 
Leavy said. Residents of the former Portuguese colony will vote 
tomorrow on whether to become an independent nation or an

	Panama Downplays Chinese-Owned Co.  
</P>
<P>
	PANAMA (AP) -- Panamanian officials have dismissed American fears  
that a Hong Kong-based company managing Panama Canal ports will 
give China control over the waterway after the U.S. departs. Two 
years ago, Hutchison Whampoa Ltd., known here as the Panama Port 
Co., won a 20-year concession to control the access ports at the 
Pacific and Atlantic entrances to the Canal. Senate Majority leader 
Trent Lott, R-Miss., has said that will give Beijing undue 
influence over the canal's operation. But a statement by the Hong 
Kong-based company, owned by billionaire Li Ka-Shing, denied Li had 
``any connections whatsoever to the People's Liberation Army of 
China.''

	SYDNEY, Australia (AP) -- Jenny Thompson won her sixth gold medal  
of the Pan Pacific swim championships today, leading the United 
States to a narrow victory over Australia in the pool which will

team's three golds out of four on the final day, while Grant 
Hackett got the other for Australia. For the first time in eight 
days, no world record records were broken, leaving the final tally

<HEADLINE> Sharon Stone Plays Auctioneer </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	FORT MYERS, Fla. (AP) -- Actress Sharon Stone took on the role of  
celebrity auctioneer and helped raise a record amount for an abused 
women's shelter. 
</P>
<P>
	Stone was one of the auctioneer's who helped sell dozens of  
pieces of donated art to raise money for Abuse Counseling and 
Treatment Inc. on Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
	The star of ``The Muse'' egged on the crowd of about 1,400 in  
Fort Myers to spend generously. Her appearance was a major reason 
for the large turnout, with many showing up in tuxedos and evening 
gowns. The event raised more than $250,000, nearly twice as much as 
last year's auction. 
</P>
<P>
	``Don't make me have a little actress fit up here,'' she said  
when prodding the crowd to bid. ``I'm very good at them you know.'' 
</P>
<P>
	She poked fun at herself and mingled with the crowd, sitting on  
men's laps to get them to bid more. When auctioning a piece of 
jewelry, she quipped, ``I've slept with almost everyone who gave me 
a diamond necklace, but those days are over now.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Stone agreed to serve as an auctioneer after meeting artist  
Robert Rauschenberg, who lives on nearby Captiva Island, at an AIDS 
fund-raiser in Texas last year. The 41-year-old actress is married 
to San Francisco Examiner Executive Editor Phil Bronstein.

<HEADLINE> Hurricane Dennis Soaks S.C. Coast </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHARLESTON, S.C. (AP) -- The fringes of Hurricane Dennis brushed  
the South Carolina coast with squalls Sunday, flooding streets and 
creating rip currents that kept many people out of the surf. 
</P>
<P>
	Despite a hurricane watch from Savannah, Ga., to Cape Hatteras,  
N.C., dozens of people came out Sunday to watch 10-foot waves at 
the Washout on Folly Beach on Folly Island, just south of 
Charleston. 
</P>
<P>
	But most surfers managed only short rides on the crashing waves.  
</P>
<P>
	``The conditions right now are extremely dangerous,'' said Dale  
Horne, a surfer from North Charleston who was content to watch. 
``The sets are coming in too close together. Some of these crazy 
fools are still going out anyway.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The rip currents were especially dangerous, he said. The best  
surfing is when a hurricane is well offshore and just sends swells 
into the coast, Horne said. 
</P>
<P>
	Few homes on Folly Island were boarded up. All are new since  
Hurricane Hugo blasted the barrier island 10 years ago. 
</P>
<P>
	Dennis was headed north along the coast Sunday, with a  
possibility it would turn out to sea, but Ed Yarborough was not 
convinced the storm would miss land. 
</P>
<P>
	``Seeing is believing,'' he said as he boarded up a house a  
block from the beach. ``You must board up and be safe rather than 
be sorry.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Harold Holt of Mount Pleasant was more trusting of the  
forecasts. ``I think it's going to come close but turn north,'' he 
said as he watched the surfers. 
</P>
<P>
	``As Yogi Berra said, 'It's not over 'til it's over,''' said  
Charleston Mayor Joseph P. Riley Jr. 
</P>
<P>
	Squalls in the hurricane's outer bands produced blinding rain  
squalls at times Sunday, heavy enough to produce some street 
flooding, with periods of brighter sky. 
</P>
<P>
	Gov. Jim Hodges said after meeting with emergency preparedness  
officials that he did not think an evacuation order was necessary. 
However, people living in beach homes and in low-lying areas should 
be cautious because of the possibility of flooding and wind damage, 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Officials planned to open 13 shelters around Charleston for  
people who wanted to leave low-lying areas.

<HEADLINE> Seahawks 41, Cardinals 7 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SEATTLE (AP) -- Jon Kitna threw a touchdown pass and Ahman Green  
had a TD run in the first half as the Seahawks gave new coach Mike 
Holmgren his first victory in Seattle, 41-7 over Arizona in an 
exhibition game Saturday night. 
</P>
<P>
	Kitna, the Seahawks' starting quarterback, was 12-of-23 for 147  
yards, including a 3-yard TD to tight end Itula Mili in the first 
quarter. He was not intercepted. 
</P>
<P>
	Green, Ricky Watters' backup at running back, gave the Seahawks  
a 17-0 halftime lead with a 2-yard TD run in the second quarter. 
</P>
<P>
	Glenn Foley, Seattle's backup quarterback who had a shaky  
training camp, threw two touchdown passes after replacing Kitna in 
the second half. He had a 23-yard scoring pass to running back 
Michael Black in the third quarter and a 15-yarder to fullback 
Oscar Gray in the fourth. 
</P>
<P>
	Foley, obtained in an offseason trade from the New York Jets,  
was 4-of-5 for 67 yards and two touchdowns with no interceptions. 
</P>
<P>
	Seattle (1-2) dominated Cardinals quarterback Dave Brown, who  
started in place of the injured Jake Plummer. Brown was 3-for-9 for 
23 yards and had two passes intercepted. The Seahawks sacked the 
former New York Giants starter five times, and finished with eight 
sacks. 
</P>
<P>
	Plummer suffered a sprained right thumb in Arizona's second  
exhibition game against Tennessee last week. He is expected to be 
ready for the regular season opener. 
</P>
<P>
	The Cardinals (1-2) got a strong game from Adrian Murrell, who  
had 47 yards on 10 carries. 
</P>
<P>
	The Seahawks' first team held the Cardinals to two first downs  
and 46 total yards, all by passing, in the first half. 
</P>
<P>
	On its second possession, Seattle took a 7-0 lead on the 3-yard  
pass from Kitna to Mili with 3:04 left in the opening quarter. 
</P>
<P>
	The Seahawks went 51 yards in eight plays with Watters  
accounting for 48 of the yards on three runs for 15 and one catch 
for 33. Watters finished the game with 44 yards on 10 carries. 
</P>
<P>
	In the second quarter, Todd Peterson made it 10-0 with a 24-yard  
field goal and the Seahawks added their second touchdown on the 
2-yard run by Green, the former Nebraska star expected to get more 
playing time from Holmgren. The second TD was set up by Jay 
Bellamy's interception and 22-yard return on a pass from Brown 
intended for Frank Sanders. 
</P>
<P>
	When Seattle went to a third quarterback in the fourth quarter,  
Holmgren used training camp quarterback Kevin Kreinhagen instead of 
Brock Huard, the team's third-round draft choice from Washington. 
Huard threw three interceptions in the second half at San Francisco 
last week. 
</P>
<P>
	Arizona got its touchdown on a 19-yard swing pass from Chris  
Greisen to Michael Pittman with 1:14 to go.

<HEADLINE>  Cowboys Owner Jerry Jones Arrested </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HIGHLAND PARK, Texas (AP) -- Dallas Cowboys owner Jerry Jones was  
arrested Sunday after he drove away with his family before a police 
officer had finished writing a speeding ticket. 
</P>
<P>
	Jones was in one vehicle and his family was behind him in a  
Suburban around 10:30 a.m. Sunday on their way to church services, 
WFAA-TV reported. An employee of Jones' was driving the Suburban. 
</P>
<P>
	Highland Park police chief Darrell Fant said an officer pulled  
over the Suburban for going 45 mph in a 30 mph zone. Jones was not 
stopped, but pulled over on his own and went to where an officer 
was questioning the driver of the other car. 
</P>
<P>
	``He said he was in a rush and asked if he could go ahead and  
take the family members on to church,'' Fant said. ``The officer 
told him, `I'll just be a minute. I'll do this as fast as I can.' 
He made some remark and then did not follow the order of the 
officer and took the vehicle anyway.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Officials said the officer radioed ahead and another police  
vehicle tried to pull Jones over, but he did not stop. 
</P>
<P>
	With the police vehicle following at a slow pace, Jones  
proceeded to the Highland Park United Methodist Church on the 
Southern Methodist University campus, about a mile from where the 
traffic stop took place. 
</P>
<P>
	Jones let his family out at the church, then drove off again.  
Around the corner, he pulled into a private drive, where police 
arrested him. 
</P>
<P>
	WFAA said Jones was taken to the Highland Park Department of  
Public Safety. Shortly later, Jones' youngest son, Jerry Jones Jr., 
was seen pacing outside, talking on a cell phone. A while later, a 
car with the two inside pulled out of a back parking lot of the 
police station, tires squealing. 
</P>
<P>
	Jones was unavailable for comment. KDFW-TV, which was televising  
the Cowboys' exhibition game Sunday night with the Denver Broncos, 
said in a pregame show it would have an interview with Jones during 
the evening. 
</P>
<P>
	Later, KDFW reported that club officials had said someone ``may  
have gotten their signals crossed'' about the interview and that 
Jones might not be available. He had no comment before Sunday's 
game. 
</P>
<P>
	Jones was charged with fleeing the scene, a Class B misdemeanor  
punishable by up to a $2,000 fine and six months in jail. 
</P>
<P>
	Two years ago, Jones fined Barry Switzer, then the Cowboys head  
coach, $75,000 for his arrest on a gun charge, saying he wanted to 
show he was serious about repairing the Cowboys' tarnished image. 
</P>
<P>
	Switzer had a loaded .38-caliber pistol in his luggage at  
Dallas-Fort Worth International Airport. Switzer said he put the 
gun in his bag to hide it from children visiting his home, but 
forgot to remove it before going to the airport. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have to send the message that we really do get it,'' Jones  
said at the time he fined Switzer. ``That although you make a 
mistake, it still can very negatively impact a lot of people in our 
organization.''

<HEADLINE> Clintons To Visit Mostly Rep. Town </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SKANEATELES, N.Y. (AP) -- Residents of this upscale, mostly  
Republican lakeside town won't exactly be rolling out the red 
carpet for Bill and Hillary Clinton when they vacation here this 
week. 
</P>
<P>
	``I hope the Clintons ... stay out of the village,'' said Johnny  
Angyal, who owns ``Johnny Angel's,'' a popular local restaurant. 
</P>
<P>
	In honor of the First Lady's visit, Angyal recently dubbed a  
sandwich ``The Hillary Special'' -- a grilled roll stuffed with 
``mostly baloney,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Fellow restaurateur Doug Clark has said flat out the first  
couple isn't welcome in his ``Doug's Fish Fry,'' another village 
hotspot. 
</P>
<P>
	Clark calls the president untrustworthy and Mrs. Clinton  
insincere. 
</P>
<P>
	``I would refuse them service because they are intoxicated with  
power,'' Clark said. ``I just don't want them in my restaurant.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Clintons are expected to spend five days at developer Thomas  
B. McDonald's $1.4 million waterfront home, an 8,200-square-foot 
estate that sits in the heart of GOP territory where enrolled 
Republicans outnumber Democrats nearly 3-1. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't think they will be welcomed warmly,'' said Janet  
Besse, who lives down the road from the McDonalds and will be the 
Clintons' closest Democratic neighbor. 
</P>
<P>
	Closer yet will be J. Patrick Barrett, one of the state's most  
influential Republicans. Barrett has vowed to back any party member 
opposing Mrs. Clinton should she seek to succeed retiring U.S. Sen. 
Daniel Patrick Moynihan. 
</P>
<P>
	The Clintons will be surrounded by other high-profile  
Republicans who own property around the glittering Skaneateles -- 
pronounced Skan-e-atlas -- Lake, where a ferry offers nightly dinner 
cruises and a waterborne view of the multimillion-dollar homes that 
ring the lake's northern end. 
</P>
<P>
	There are, however, some in this town of 2,700 who are prepared  
to put their politics aside and be hospitable for such a historic 
occasion. 
</P>
<P>
	``There are people who are taking this a little too seriously,''  
said Town Republican Chairman Donald Stanford. ``I think it's 
great. We haven't had anything this fun to talk about since the 
last village election.''

<HEADLINE> Dick Clark Pitches 'Millenios' </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	GOLDEN VALLEY, Minn. (AP) -- Dick Clark, the ageless king of New  
Year's Eve, is pitching a new breakfast cereal celebrating the end 
of the millennium. 
</P>
<P>
	Clark will soon introduce Millenios, a sweetened whole grain oat  
and corn cereal made into 2s and 0s to mark the upcoming calendar 
switch to 2000. 
</P>
<P>
	``Everyone knows Dick Clark is synonymous with New Year's Eve,''  
said Pam Becker, a spokeswoman for General Mills Inc. 
</P>
<P>
	The limited-time offering will hit store shelves in September.  
General Mills likely will sell the cereal through January.

<HEADLINE> NFL Camps Roundup </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NFL trainer's rooms were busier than usual during Saturday  
night's exhibition games as a number of teams took some major 
lumps. 
</P>
<P>
	The St. Louis Rams lost starting quarterback Trent Green with a  
season-ending knee injury. Cleveland linebacker Chris Spielman, 
attempting a comeback from neck fusion surgery in 1997, might 
retire after a violent helmet-on-helmet collision sent him to the 
hospital. 
</P>
<P>
	New Orleans starting quarterback Billy Joe Hobert is expected to  
miss the Saints' final preseason game after fracturing one of his 
ribs. 
</P>
<P>
	Miami was relieved to learn tests showed running back Cecil  
Collins had no new break in his injured right ankle, giving him a 
chance to heal in time for the season opener. 
</P>
<P>
	New York Giants center Brian Williams, attempting a comeback  
after missing two seasons with an eye injury, sprained his left 
knee in the first half of a 16-10 loss to the New York Jets. 
</P>
<P>
	In the Rams' 24-21 victory over San Diego, Green tore the  
anterior cruciate ligament, sustained a third-degree sprain of the 
medial collateral ligament in his left knee and also had cartilage 
damage. 
</P>
<P>
	Reconstructive surgery will be scheduled when the swelling  
subsides, in about 2-3 weeks. Dr. Robert Shively, the team 
physician, estimated the recovery period at 13 months. 
</P>
<P>
	The injury occurred when Chargers strong safety Rodney Harrison,  
blitzing on the play, lunged at the back of Green's knees just 
after a pass was thrown. Green had completed all 11 of his attempts 
before the injury. 
</P>
<P>
	Kurt Warner, who has one quarter of NFL experience, became St.  
Louis' starter by default. The team also acquired Paul Justin from 
Oakland as insurance Sunday, giving up a seventh-round pick in next 
year's draft. 
</P>
<P>
	Warner, 28, led NFL Europe in passing yards, attempts,  
completions and touchdowns in 1998 for the Amsterdam Admirals. 
Before that, he passed for 10,164 yards and 183 touchdowns in three 
seasons with the Iowa Barnstormers of the Arena Football League. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm confident in my ability and the coaches are confident in  
my ability,'' Warner said. ``Now it's time to go out and prove to 
the rest of the world that I can be successful.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Spielman could announce his retirement Monday after sustaining a  
``stinger'' during the Browns' 35-24 win over Chicago when he was 
blindsided by Bears center Casey Wiegmann while trying to cut back 
on a screen play. 
</P>
<P>
	After shedding and spinning off one blocker, Spielman turned and  
before he could get his feet planted, Wiegmann crushed him. 
</P>
<P>
	Spielman stayed on the ground for several moments, and later  
told Cleveland offensive tackle Lomas Brown, who also played with 
him in Detroit, that he had been momentarily paralyzed. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's exploring all of his options,'' said Browns coach Chris  
Palmer, who spoke to Spielman twice on Sunday. ``He's going to look 
at everything and go from there. What we want to do is sit back 
take a look at things, let things settle down for 24 hours both 
emotionally and physically and then talk about the subject at that 
time.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He got a scare in training camp when he was blasted by fullback  
Tarek Saleh, a blow that sent him to the hospital for an MRI. 
</P>
<P>
	Chicago lost backup defensive tackle Jimmy Herndon for the  
season with a torn ACL in his left knee. 
</P>
<P>
	Hobert completed 10 of 15 passes for 179 yards and two  
touchdowns before a helmet to his right side fractured one of his 
ribs. 
</P>
<P>
	``It shouldn't be that big a deal,'' Hobert said, although he  
admitted he was in pain just standing still. ``If they wanted me to 
play in the next game, I could as long as I wore a protective rib 
vest.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Saints plan to hold Hobert out of Thursday's preseason game  
against Tennessee and have him ready for the opener against 
Carolina. 
</P>
<P>
	Collins, the Dolphins' fifth-round draft pick, will be on  
crutches for a few days and miss Thursday's game at Green Bay. 
There's a possibility he could be ready when Miami opens the season 
Sept. 13 at Denver. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm glad it wasn't serious,'' said Collins, who leads the team  
with 34 carries and 144 yards. ``I'm going to work hard with the 
trainers to do everything I can to try and get ready as soon as 
possible.'' 
</P>
<P>
	An MRI exam showed Collins aggravated an injury Collins  
sustained two years ago at LSU. Collins broke his right leg and 
damaged ankle ligaments in an October 1997 game against Vanderbilt. 
</P>
<P>
	Williams' injury doesn't appear to be that serious, coach Jim  
Fassel said Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	The veteran center had an MRI and there appears to be no  
structural damage. While Fassel is optimistic, he would not say 
when Williams will be back until he speaks with Dr. Russell Warren, 
the team's orthopedic surgeon.

	Baltimore isn't making much headway in their contract talks with  
Pro Bowl defensive end Michael McCrary, who reportedly left the 
team over the weekend after discussions over a possible extension 
reached an impasse. The Ravens, however, insisted that McCrary 
never informed them of that decision. 
</P>
<P>
	McCrary underwent offseason knee surgery and wasn't supposed to  
play Saturday anyway. The players were given Sunday off, so McCrary 
won't be considered AWOL until Monday, when he is scheduled to

	``It feels great,'' said Pederson, following treatment on his

<HEADLINE> Y2K Expert Warns of Minor Problems </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The White House pointman on the Y2K computer  
glitch said Sunday that Americans shouldn't worry about accidental 
nuclear launches or erased bank records, but should prepare for 
some minor inconveniences. 
</P>
<P>
	John Koskinen, head of the White House panel on the year 2000  
computer problem, emphasized that with four months left before the 
new year, federal government computers were ready and the national 
infrastructure was in good shape. People should know that it was 
safe to take planes or trains on Jan. 1, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	He said a report due out next month would find that 95 percent  
of the federal government's mission-critical computer systems were 
fixed. ``If there are any major problems, it won't come from a 
failure of a federal system,'' Koskinen said on CNN's ``Late 
Edition.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But he said he was still concerned about utilities and phone  
systems in some communities and ``we are worried about some of the 
smaller or not so small educational facilities, some health care 
facilities.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Koskinen said his office is encouraging people across the  
country to engage in conversations with local utilities and public 
services, to make sure they are taking action to correct Y2K 
problems. 
</P>
<P>
	The concern is that many computers that use only two digits to  
read dates will mistake the year 2000, or ``00,'' as 1900, causing 
computers to malfunction or break down. 
</P>
<P>
	Koskinen said that as a common-sense precaution Americans should  
have on hand at least battery-powered radios and flashlights and a 
three-day supply of water and food. ``It's going to be a long 
weekend in the middle of winter.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The administration is satisfied, he said, that nuclear weapons  
around the world are safe because they can only be launched through 
human intervention. 
</P>
<P>
	The one concern with the Russians is a breakdown in their  
nuclear weapons early warning system. ``If it goes down and they go 
blind in effect, then the level of anxiety could increase so we are 
trying to make sure that doesn't happen.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Koskinen said banks and financial firms are ready, and there is  
no chance of bank accounts being lost, although people should keep 
paper copies of recent financial transactions. 
</P>
<P>
	He also said that State Department, in future updates about the  
risks of visiting foreign nations, would offer advice about 
possible Y2K problems. While developed countries are generally 
making progress in fixing their computers, some developing 
countries are not coping as well.

<HEADLINE> Cop Dilemma: Disposing of Old Guns </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SEATTLE (AP) -- With nearly 600 old Smith &AMP; Wesson service  
revolvers they no longer need, Seattle police face a quandary. 
</P>
<P>
	They can sell the .38-caliber handguns to licensed dealers and  
hope they don't end up in the hands of killers or thieves, or 
destroy them and shrug off the loss of thousands of dollars of 
taxpayers' money. 
</P>
<P>
	Given those options, the revolvers have remained locked in  
storage since 1994. 
</P>
<P>
	It's a familiar dilemma to police nationwide, and one that has  
come under scrutiny following an Aug. 10 shooting spree in Los 
Angeles. Authorities say the gun Buford O. Furrow Jr. allegedly 
used to kill a postal worker after spraying a Jewish community 
center with gunfire was traced to the police department in 
Cosmopolis, Wash. 
</P>
<P>
	Gary Eisenhower, chief of the five-member Cosmopolis police  
force, was sickened to learn of the connection. But he said his 
department cannot afford to destroy old service weapons that can 
bring the department hundreds of dollars each. 
</P>
<P>
	Eisenhower had traded the Glock semiautomatic pistol to a store  
for a new service weapon, a common industry practice that saves 
money but also floods the secondhand market with relatively cheap 
firearms. 
</P>
<P>
	Government data obtained by The Wall Street Journal showed at  
least 1,100 former police guns were among the 193,203 guns used in 
crimes and traced last year by the federal Bureau of Alcohol, 
Tobacco and Firearms. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think the last thing the everyday citizen wants to know is  
that the police department is recirculating guns and selling them 
to the general public,'' said Pamela Eakes, founder of Mothers 
Against Violence in America, based in suburban Seattle. 
</P>
<P>
	``If you couldn't sell them to another police department or  
sheriff's department, then I think the only alternative is to melt 
them down,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	Gun rights advocates counter that police guns accounted for less  
than 1 percent of guns used in crimes last year. 
</P>
<P>
	And some advocates complain that cities suing the gun industry  
for allegedly failing to control the distribution of firearms -- 
including New Orleans, Chicago and Detroit -- have themselves 
contributed to the number of guns on the street via police 
trade-ins. 
</P>
<P>
	``New Orleans has probably sold more guns back through the chain  
than any city in the country,'' said Alan Gottlieb, chairman of the 
Bellevue, Wash.-based Citizens Committee for the Right to Keep and 
Bear Arms. ``The bottom line is the exact thing they're charging 
the manufacturers with you could charge them with.'' 
</P>
<P>
	New Orleans police acknowledged in January that they agreed to  
trade almost 10,000 confiscated and used weapons to Glock Inc. in a 
deal for new weapons. 
</P>
<P>
	City officials said the deal stipulated that the guns were not  
to be sold in Louisiana and the transaction netted the department a 
credit of more than $400,000 toward $772,000 in new guns. 
</P>
<P>
	Other examples of the practice:  
</P>
<P>
	--In Detroit, Police Chief Benny Napoleon acknowledged some of  
the 7,000 guns sold by his department to a wholesaler may have 
ended up in the city's gun shops. The sales between 1992 and 1997 
earned about $800,000 toward the purchase of new weapons for the 
4,000-member department, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	--The sheriff's department in Jefferson County, Colo., the agency  
investigating the Columbine High School massacre, sold more than 
100 of its own guns to a gun store in 1995 and used the money to 
buy weapons for a SWAT team. 
</P>
<P>
	--In Boston, police Commissioner Paul Evans said guns the  
department recently traded in for new Glock pistols were resold in 
the United States -- a violation of city policy that only allows the 
wholesaler to sell the guns overseas. 
</P>
<P>
	Ken Jorgensen, spokesman for Massachusetts-based Smith &AMP; Wesson,  
said police trade-ins have slowed due to the recent public 
attention. 
</P>
<P>
	Glock hasn't noticed a slowdown, yet, said Paul Jannuzzo, vice  
president and general counsel for the gunmaker. 
</P>
<P>
	Glock may trade 25,000 guns to police agencies in ``a really  
good year,'' Jannuzzo said. But eliminating those police-issued 
guns from the secondhand market won't quell strong consumer demand 
for firearms, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Larry Todd, chief of police in the Silicon Valley cities of Los  
Gatos, Calif., and Monte Sereno, Calif., said police leaders are 
realizing the consequences of the trade-in practices, which caught 
on in the 1980s as law enforcers switched from revolvers to 
semiautomatic handguns. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1995, Todd and fellow members of the California Police Chiefs  
Association approved a resolution recommending that police agencies 
destroy all their unnecessary guns -- police-issue or confiscated. 
</P>
<P>
	The International Association of Chiefs of Police endorsed the  
concept last October after concluding the costs of gun violence far 
outweigh the cost of throwing guns away, Todd said. 
</P>
<P>
	``I take the philosophical position that we as public servants  
ought not to be introducing weapons of any kind into society,'' he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Officials in Seattle, which passed an ordinance in the early  
1990s prohibiting police from offering guns to the public, agree. 
</P>
<P>
	``It just seems to me it's a small price to pay to keep these  
guns out of circulation,'' City Councilwoman Margaret Pageler said.

<HEADLINE> Jospin Disappointed Over Megabank </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PARIS (AP) -- French Prime Minister Lionel Jospin expressed his  
disappointment Sunday over the failure of efforts to create a 
French megabank, saying that a fusion would have been desirable. 
</P>
<P>
	However, Jospin said efforts to force a merger between the  
Banque Nationale de Paris and Societe Generale, which opposed its 
rival's hostile takeover bid, would have created instability in the 
French financial system. 
</P>
<P>
	French regulators on Saturday ruled that BNP could not keep its  
stake in Societe Generale, leaving BNP with the investment bank 
Paribas, the smaller of its two targets in a hostile takeover bid. 
</P>
<P>
	``One could wish that a regrouping of BNP, Societe Generale and  
Paribas be implemented,'' Jospin told a meeting of the Socialist 
Party in La Rochelle in western France. 
</P>
<P>
	``But it could only happen in an ordered and mutually agreed  
upon way without causing great risks of instability for the French 
financial system, for the economy and for employment,'' he added. 
</P>
<P>
	Jospin also said he hoped that his government could continue to  
assist in the consolidation of the French banking sector. 
</P>
<P>
	In March, BNP launched a hostile takeover bid for both Societe  
Generale and Paribas, which were in the process of a friendly 
merger. While BNP won a comfortable majority in Paribas, it won 
only 31.8 percent of the voting rights of Societe Generale. 
</P>
<P>
	BNP claimed it had a big enough stake to effectively control  
Societe Generale, which fiercely rejected the claim. When both 
banks refused to compromise, regulators were forced to step in. 
</P>
<P>
	The regulators ruled that BNP's stake was insufficient to  
guarantee it effective control over Societe Generale. 
</P>
<P>
	Michel Pebereau, the chairman of BNP said in an interview  
published Sunday in the Journal du Dimanche that he still believed 
that BNP had enough shares to exercise effective control over 
Societe Generale, but that he did not intend to try again. 
</P>
<P>
	``For us, this operation is finished. We prefer to devote our  
efforts to putting in place BNP-Paribas which is the first French 
bank, the third in Europe in terms of assets and the eighth in 
terms of market capitalization.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The BNP chief also said he would seek out new partners in  
Europe. 
</P>
<P>
	``BNP by itself wanted to develop its banking activities in Asia  
and Eastern Europe,'' Pebereau said. ``With our increased means, we 
want to seek partnerships in Europe.''

<HEADLINE> Penn State Had the Better QB's </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	STATE COLLEGE, Pa. (AP) -- Watching all that tape of Arizona's  
quarterback duo must have gotten Joe Paterno thinking. 
</P>
<P>
	Facing a team that went 12-1 last year, while splitting snaps  
between two quarterbacks, Paterno swiped his opponents' game plan. 
Kevin Thompson and Rashard Casey led an offense that rolled up 506 
yards, burying Arizona in big plays on the way to a 41-7 victory in 
the Pigskin Classic on Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
	Casey, a frustrated backup all last season, was thrilled.  
Thompson -- the top guy last season who admitted before this game 
that two-quarterback systems can be awkward -- insisted he was 
comfortable. 
</P>
<P>
	``Hey, we won,'' he said with a wide smile. ``That's all the  
comfort I need.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Paterno, a devout one-quarterback guy, will have to decide  
whether or not to stick with the new plan. He might be inclined to 
play both quarterbacks against the Akron Zips next Saturday and 
Pittsburgh Sept. 11. The test will be whether he does the same 
against powers Miami, Ohio State or Michigan. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't know what we're going to do the rest of the year,'' he  
said after the game. 
</P>
<P>
	On Saturday, Casey was already making his case.  
</P>
<P>
	``If I keep doing what I'm doing, I don't see why not,'' he  
said. 
</P>
<P>
	For at least one week, it worked. Paterno sent Thompson out for  
the first drive. Three minutes later, he hit wideout Chafie Fields 
for a 37-yard touchdown. 
</P>
<P>
	The next drive, out came Casey. Two plays later, Penn State had  
another TD on a 70-yard reverse to Fields. 
</P>
<P>
	Two series later, Thompson found tailback Larry Johnson with a  
screen pass that went 60 yards for another touchdown. Seven minutes 
into the second quarter, the Lions led 24-0. 
</P>
<P>
	Casey ended up playing seven series, going 6-for-10 for 107  
yards. He added 23 yards rushing. Thompson went 5-for-8 for 135 
yards with two TDs in five series. 
</P>
<P>
	What's not to like?  
</P>
<P>
	``We've got plenty of weapons,'' said Lions middle linebacker  
Brandon Short. ``They didn't surprise me at all. They move the ball 
against us. They go out there and move the ball every day in 
practice. Obviously, some days are better than others -- I mean, we 
have a pretty good defense ourselves.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The offense had to feel good about unburdening themselves of  
their lousy reputation: a unit that would be lucky to score a few 
points and hope the fabulous Penn State defense could keep the 
score down. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is great for our offense coming off last season and all  
the criticism we received,'' Fields said, ``about how we needed to 
make plays, how we needed to do this, how the defense carried the 
team. I think this was a first step for us to show everybody that 
the guys on the offense can play the game, too.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Paterno considered going to two QBs last season. In the end, he  
decided that Thompson made better reads and better understood the 
offense. 
</P>
<P>
	He stuck with him despite fans' demands that he play Casey after  
Penn State scored 12 points in three games against Top 25 teams. 
Fans complained that Paterno had a guy on the bench with a strong 
arm and lots of speed. 
</P>
<P>
	After Casey threw three touchdowns in the spring game -- Thompson  
threw three interceptions -- the coach finally decided he deserved a 
shot at playing with the first team with the game on the line. 
</P>
<P>
	``We didn't know how we were going to do it. He said he'd go  
with the flow of the game,'' Casey said. ``He did a great job of 
splitting time.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Paterno said he was pleased with Casey's performance. Except for  
one play. 
</P>
<P>
	With 54 seconds left in the first half and Penn State facing  
third-and-31 from its own 10-yard line, he dashed a few yards up 
the sideline and out of bounds, stopping the clock and giving 
Arizona more time to work with after the Penn State punt. A 
red-faced Paterno screamed at Casey as he came off the field. 
</P>
<P>
	He had plenty more to be unhappy about. Big plays aside, Penn  
State's offense had problems. They didn't run the ball very 
consistently, Thompson threw an interception and the offensive line 
was penalized a number of times for false starts. 
</P>
<P>
	``We still have a lot of work to go,'' Thompson said. ``This is  
only the first game of the year. We fooled them on a couple of 
plays and that's what set the tone.''

	WRIGHTSVILLE BEACH, N.C. (AP) -- The National Hurricane Center  
said the track of Hurricane Dennis was far from certain as it 
wallowed along the coast toward the Carolinas today, prompting 
evacuation orders for the fragile Outer Banks barrier islands. The 
hurricane was less than 200 miles south of the North Carolina coast 
by late afternoon, with its top wind revved up slightly to 105 mph, 
and it had edged slightly toward the east. Dennis was expected to 
continue turning toward the northeast, with a chance the worst of 
it would miss land.

	PHOENIX (AP) -- The Arizona Supreme Court today opened the way

late-term abortion. The high court voted 3-2 to overturn a state 
appeals judge's ruling yesterday that blocked the girl from heading

<HEADLINE> Bullfight Law Broken in Portugal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BARRANCOS, Portugal (AP) -- Two Latin American matadors delighted  
spectators in this remote Portuguese town Sunday by killing the 
bulls they had just fought, defying legislation banning the 
practice. 
</P>
<P>
	Unlike in the Spanish bullfighting tradition, where killing the  
animal culminates the fight, in Portugal the bulls are normally led 
away to be slain later in an abattoir. 
</P>
<P>
	But not in Barrancos. Only 6 miles from Spain, residents here  
say neither a 1928 law nor more recent court orders against killing 
bulls in public will stop their 300-year-old traditional bullfight, 
held during the town's annual summer festival. 
</P>
<P>
	Hundreds of people sat in the specially constructed wooden ring  
in high-spirited tension before the two bulls were killed. Dozens 
more watched from a balcony overlooking the town's main square, 
where the arena stood. 
</P>
<P>
	``Tradition should be acknowledged by law,'' said 60-year-old  
Barrancos resident Jose Francisco Lima before the fight. 
</P>
<P>
	And it was the town's insistence on flouting the law last year,  
despite interior ministry warnings, that prompted parliament to 
debate an exemption to the legislation that would allow a handful 
of places like Barrancos to stage bull-killing fights. 
</P>
<P>
	But the vote was postponed, and the lead up to this year's  
festival was once again marked by heated discussions between animal 
rights activists and sympathizers of the Barrancos bullfight. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a brutal thing that parents shouldn't leave as a legacy  
to their children,'' the president of the Society for the 
Protection of Animals told daily Publico. ``It's medieval.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, sitting in the arena, 23-year-old Hugo Alves said he  
was committed to keeping the tradition alive. 
</P>
<P>
	``Why would we be fighting (for the bullfight) if we didn't want  
it to exist in 10 years time?'' asked the Barrancos-born student of 
Lisbon University. 
</P>
<P>
	Some locals harassed cameramen and photographers in an effort to  
prevent them capturing the moment when the matadors killed the 
bulls. 
</P>
<P>
	After the fight the foreign matadors, whose identity was not  
revealed, were whisked away to Spain -- although it seemed unlikely 
they would be arrested before crossing the frontier. 
</P>
<P>
	Barrancos, some 250 kilometers southeast of Lisbon, sits on a  
hilltop deep in the Alentejo province, an arid region of olive-tree 
plantations and white-brick farmhouses.

<HEADLINE> Radioactive Ooze Found Outside Plant </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Federal officials confirmed that a radioactive  
black ooze found seeping outside the fence of a Kentucky uranium 
enrichment plant led workers to a burial ground for radioactive 
debris. 
</P>
<P>
	Contract workers chanced upon the material near an unused  
sanitary landfill at the Gaseous Diffusion Plant in Paducah, Ky., 
The Washington Post reported Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	Preparing to install wells to monitor another possible  
contamination site near the landfill, which closed in 1996, the 
workers found the ooze July 15. 
</P>
<P>
	The workers dug beneath a tar-like liquid found in a track left  
by their drilling truck and turned up what appeared to be bits of 
tar paper and asphalt shingles. 
</P>
<P>
	An Energy Department report said ``observations indicated  
possible roofing debris.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Not until three weeks later, after further excavation, did plant  
officials learn the material was contaminated, the newspaper said. 
Radioactivity readings were hundreds of times above levels found 
naturally in soil and almost nine times higher than the plant's 
``action level,'' which would trigger immediate action to seal 
contaminated areas inside the plant. 
</P>
<P>
	Lab tests confirmed the presence of uranium and technetium.  
Technetium, a radioactive metal that travels quickly through soil, 
was brought into the plant inadvertently in the 1950s, '60s and 
'70s in shipments of recycled uranium from government nuclear 
reactors used to produce plutonium. 
</P>
<P>
	Energy Department officials fenced off the site and reported the  
discovery to Kentucky's environmental regulators. 
</P>
<P>
	Both the Department of Energy and the plant's current manager,  
U.S. Enrichment Corp., have contended that they are unaware of 
radioactive waste going into the sanitary landfill. Documents 
prepared by former contractors list the contents of the dump as 
``uncontaminated trash and garbage.'' The landfill is ``permitted 
and operated according to Kentucky regulations,'' according to 
plant records. 
</P>
<P>
	An Energy Department investigation is in the second week at the  
plant, which for 47 years has produced enriched uranium for nuclear 
weapons, Navy submarines and commercial power plants. Reports of 
contamination and sloppy waste management at the plant, including 
worker exposure to plutonium and other highly radioactive 
materials, prompted the investigation.

<HEADLINE> Sales Slow for Electronic Books </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SAN JOSE, Calif. (AP) -- Americans just aren't opting to curl up  
before a cozy fire with an electronic book these days. 
</P>
<P>
	Less than a year after the first two of the portable devices  
arrived on the market, sales are slow, funding is tough to find and 
potential competitors are dropping out. 
</P>
<P>
	``These e-reader companies now have a pretty sober understanding  
that this market is going to take some time,'' said Glenn Sanders, 
a founder of eBooknet.com, an online site with information about 
electronic books. 
</P>
<P>
	Electronic books are about the same size as a regular book, but  
can hold more than 10 conventional books, magazines or newspapers 
at a time. New texts can be downloaded, and stories can be 
annotated and searched for words or phrases. Pages are turned with 
a push of a button. 
</P>
<P>
	As many as a dozen companies have tried to bring some form of  
electronic book to market for years. Only two have made it: Rocket 
eBook, now selling for $349, and SoftBook, which costs $599. 
</P>
<P>
	Neither SoftBook nor NuvoMedia will disclose actual figures, but  
Sanders estimates that only a few thousand of the devices have sold 
so far. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's been disappointing, but we think this market is going to  
take off, and when it does, we'll still be here,'' said Martin 
Eberhard, co-founder and CEO of NuvoMedia, the company making 
Rocket eBooks. 
</P>
<P>
	It's not that people don't want to read. U.S. sales of  
conventional books rose 6.4 percent to $23 billion in 1998, 
according to the Association of American Publishers. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is a new industry, and it's taking some time before it's  
widely accepted, said Sanders. ``It's going to happen, but it could 
take four or five years.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The biggest challenge, electronic book makers agree, is getting  
publishers to convert lots of books to their format. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a bit of a Catch-22,'' said SoftBook Press, CEO Jim Sachs  
in Menlo Park, Calif. ``We can't sell an electronic book without a 
lot of content, but publishers aren't going to produce a lot of 
content if there aren't people using it on electronic books.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Publishers have been concerned that electronic versions of their  
material would be pirated and flood the Internet like illegally 
distributed music and software. 
</P>
<P>
	In June, the AAP released a study indicating that electronic  
books are technically secure -- a basic requirement for publishers 
and authors, said AAP president Pat Schroeder. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, publishers have been slow to respond. Only 1,000 titles --  
mostly older classics -- are available for electronic books, well 
below the approximately 45,000 new titles released in paper last 
year alone. 
</P>
<P>
	While Rocket eBook and SoftBook struggle to survive in the still  
limited market, several other electronic book companies have 
recently failed. 
</P>
<P>
	GemBook Inc. in Sunrise, Fla., was out of business just three  
months after it sent notices to reviewers saying it was offering 
``a new innovative type of reading.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``You can just say that GemBook has withdrawn from the race, and  
we give no explanation of why,'' a company spokesman said last 
week. 
</P>
<P>
	Last month, another company -- Librius.com Inc. in Bellevue,  
Wash., -- also gave up, pulling its Millennium eReader off its 
business plan, which focuses on selling digital copies of books to 
consumers via the Internet. 
</P>
<P>
	``When we started Librius two years ago we knew that the device  
aspect of this business would be volatile,'' vice president Don 
Ledford said in a letter to consumers. 
</P>
<P>
	Librius' investors were wary of the electronic reader, some  
fearing that it would be a liability to their existing online 
sales. 
</P>
<P>
	``In essense, the ``consumer electronics or Internet'' dichotomy  
froze investment in the company,'' he said. ``An improved 
Millennium eReader was ready for manufacture, but we were unable to 
close adequate financing to go forward with production.'' 
</P>
<P>
	At the SummerWood Partnership in Stewart, Fla., Cynthia Gurin  
said their e-books -- LunchBOOK and The Reader -- work very well, but 
still aren't ready to launch. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're literally waiting for the right venture capital, and  
improved screen technology,'' said Ms. Gurin. ``There's a procedure 
you need to go through in order to be at the point where it's time 
to grab the ball and go for the touchdown, and it's just not that 
time yet.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Despite the tough market, not all electronic book makers are  
shying away. GlassBook in Waltham, Mass., and EveryBook Inc. in 
Middletown, Penn., still plan to release their books this year. 
</P>
<P>
	EveryBooks are two-screened, mimicking an open book. They are  
also in color, and can hold 200 books -- more than ten times most of 
their competition. They cost $1,600 and are aimed at doctors, 
lawyers, engineers and others who spend thousands a year on 
professional manuals. 
</P>
<P>
	EveryBook spokeswoman Jeanne Quinn Lowing said they're planning  
to sell 25,000 units next year, dismissing concerns that other 
companies haven't sold nearly that many. 
</P>
<P>
	``Quite candidly, we position our product differently than they  
do,'' she said. ``There is no doubt we are going to make it. It 
just takes time.''

<HEADLINE> Red Sox 7, Angels 4  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BOSTON (AP) -- Pat Rapp posted another impressive pitching  
performance and Trot Nixon had three hits and scored three runs as 
the Boston Red Sox beat the Anaheim Angels 7-4 Sunday for a 
three-game sweep. 
</P>
<P>
	Boston, which entered the day tied with Oakland for the AL  
wild-card lead, won for the fifth time in six games. The Red Sox 
went 9-1 against the Angels this season, winning all six at Fenway 
Park. 
</P>
<P>
	Rapp (6-5) allowed one run and six hits in six innings. He is  
4-0 with a 3.07 ERA in seven starts since being reinserted into the 
rotation July 28. 
</P>
<P>
	Jim Edmonds went 4-for-4, including two doubles for the Angels.  
Mo Vaughn went 2-for-5 with a double and a two-run single in the 
ninth, finishing the year 3-for-20 against his former team. 
</P>
<P>
	Derek Lowe struck out Tim Salmon, the only batter he faced, for  
his ninth save. 
</P>
<P>
	Unlike the first two games of the series, when the Red Sox  
pulled out wins in their last at-bat, they didn't need any 
late-inning heroics. 
</P>
<P>
	With the score tied at 1, Boston broke through with three runs  
against Tim Belcher (5-8) in the fifth. 
</P>
<P>
	Darren Lewis hit a bases-loaded, two-run single and Brian  
Daubach broke a 3-for-27 slump with an RBI single to make it 4-1. 
</P>
<P>
	The Red Sox increased it to 7-1 in the sixth. Donnie Sadler and  
Scott Hatteberg had RBI singles and Jose Offerman added a sacrifice 
fly. 
</P>
<P>
	Matt Walbeck's RBI single gave Anaheim a 1-0 lead in the second.  
Nixon's sacrifice fly tied it in the third. 
</P>
<P>
 *Notes:* Red Sox RHP Bret Saberhagen, currently on the 15-day DL  
with weak shoulder, tried to throw on the side but stopped because 
of soreness. ... Edmonds tied a career high for hits. ... ... 
Boston 3B John Valentin, hitting .158 (9-for-57) in his last 15 
games, was given the day off. ... The Angels were swept in a season 
series in Fenway for the third time in club history, going 0-6 in 
1993 and 0-5 in '78. ... The Red Sox surpassed the 2 millon mark in 
attendance for the 13th time in 14 years. ... Anaheim is just 10-33 
since the All-Star break.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Ends Fund-Raising Weekend </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BRIDGEHAMPTON, N.Y. (AP) -- President Clinton wound up a New York  
weekend devoted to fund raising for Democrats with a plug for one 
Democrat in particular -- his wife. 
</P>
<P>
	``Of all the people I have ever known in public life, the  
ablest, the smartest, the most passionately dedicated and 
committed, is the person who wants to be the next United States 
senator from New York,'' Clinton said at a fund-raising dinner 
Sunday night on Long Island. 
</P>
<P>
	Officially, Hillary Rodham Clinton is only exploring a run in  
New York in 2000, but the president's words were just one clue that 
she intends to go ahead with the campaign. 
</P>
<P>
	Another sign was the first family's destination today. They were  
bound for upstate New York for five days at a borrowed estate in 
Skaneateles in the scenic Finger Lakes region. The venue will allow 
Mrs. Clinton to do a little politicking in a heavily Republican 
part of the state. 
</P>
<P>
	The first scheduled outing today was a visit to the New York  
State Fair in Syracuse. 
</P>
<P>
	Sunday's dinner at the estate of film producer Jane Rosenthal  
brought in about $1 million for the Democratic National Committee 
and Mrs. Clinton's expected campaign. 
</P>
<P>
	For $25,000 a couple, attendees heard rock singer Jon Bon Jovi  
and ate lobster salad with organic greens. 
</P>
<P>
	The dinner was the last event in a busy weekend of Democratic  
fund raising in the Hamptons, a swank group of towns on the Long 
Island seashore. 
</P>
<P>
	The Clintons used the Hamptons home of filmmaker Steven  
Spielberg as a base while attending five Democratic events. Four 
brought in cash for Mrs. Clinton's presumed race, or for Democratic 
candidates generally. 
</P>
<P>
	Howard Wolfson, spokesman for Mrs. Clinton's exploratory  
committee, said the campaign expected to collect about $400,000 
during the weekend. That is about half the total she expected to 
bring in during the entire vacation trip, which began with 
fund-raisers on the Massachusetts resort islands of Nantucket and 
Martha's Vineyard, and will end with two events near Skaneateles on 
Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	Earlier Sunday, the president golfed while Mrs. Clinton raised  
money at a $5,000-a-plate luncheon at the home of fashion designer 
Vera Wang. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton made two passes around a nine-hole golf course in the  
Hamptons with a party that included a local teen-age champ. 
</P>
<P>
	He also posed for a photo spread for George magazine. The  
pictures will appear in the October issue of the late John F. 
Kennedy Jr.'s politics-and-pop culture magazine, in a feature about 
people Kennedy admired. 
</P>
<P>
	The Clintons squeezed in a house-hunting visit Saturday to  
Westchester County, N.Y., north of New York City, where Mrs. 
Clinton has said she would like to settle after her family leaves 
the White House in 17 months. If she decides to run for the New 
York seat, she must establish residency before Election Day 2000.

for the ninth time this season after arguing a checked-swing call 
on Mark McGwire in the eighth inning of Sunday night's game against

<HEADLINE> Experts Fear Complacency About HIV </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ATLANTA (AP) -- There is a growing complacency about HIV,  
especially among some people most at risk, health officials said 
Sunday at the first ever national conference addressing efforts to 
monitor and prevent the spread of the virus. 
</P>
<P>
	More than 2,000 scientists, doctors, researchers and advocates  
are in Atlanta this week for the National HIV Prevention Conference 
organized by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and 17 
other sponsoring organizations. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's becoming increasingly difficult to get people to pay  
attention to HIV prevention and that in and of itself is a primary 
reason for this conference,'' said Dr. Helene Gayle, director of 
the CDC's National Center for HIV, STD, and TB Prevention. 
</P>
<P>
	``Despite a growing complacency about the need for HIV  
prevention, HIV remains a serious disease that is still very much 
with us and there is a greater need for HIV prevention today more 
than ever,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	During the four-day conference, federal officials will release  
the latest national data on trends in HIV and AIDS deaths and 
infection rates for the general population. Statistics on 
prisoners, unrecognized factors contributing to the spread of HIV, 
and results from a new HIV test will also be released. 
</P>
<P>
	In the nearly two decades since the first cases of AIDS were  
reported, the deadly virus has claimed more than 300,000 lives. The 
good news is that the number of new HIV infections has dropped from 
about 100,000 a year to 40,000. 
</P>
<P>
	But at the same time, the epidemic is taking a greater toll on  
women and minorities, especially blacks who are becoming infected 
with AIDS at record rates, federal health officials said. 
</P>
<P>
	In the mid 1980s, blacks represented about 25 percent of the new  
cases of AIDS reported, Hispanics about 14 percent and women 8 
percent, U.S. Surgeon General David Satcher said. By 1997-98, 
blacks made up 45 percent of the cases, Hispanics 22 percent and 
women 23 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	``One of the major concerns we have about the AIDS epidemic is  
that increasingly it is affecting communities that tend to be left 
out of the health care and public health system,'' Satcher said. 
``We know that in order to be successful we have to find a new way 
to reach these communities.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Much of the effort now being made to fight the epidemic is  
devoted to care and treatment when more needs to be directed toward 
prevention in order to control the epidemic, experts say. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have demonstrated that prevention works and deserves  
support,'' said Dr. Jeffrey Koplan, head of the CDC. 
``Nevertheless, as in most areas of public health, support for 
prevention is frequently more rhetorical than substantive.''

<HEADLINE> Y2K Expert Warns of Minor Problems </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The White House pointman on the Y2K computer  
glitch said Sunday that Americans shouldn't worry about accidental 
nuclear launches or erased bank records, but should prepare for 
some minor inconveniences. 
</P>
<P>
	John Koskinen, head of the White House panel on the year 2000  
computer problem, emphasized that with four months left before the 
new year, federal government computers were ready and the national 
infrastructure was in good shape. People should know that it was 
safe to take planes or trains on Jan. 1, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	He said a report due out next month would find that 95 percent  
of the federal government's mission-critical computer systems were 
fixed. ``If there are any major problems, it won't come from a 
failure of a federal system,'' Koskinen said on CNN's ``Late 
Edition.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But he said he was still concerned about utilities and phone  
systems in some communities and ``we are worried about some of the 
smaller or not so small educational facilities, some health care 
facilities.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Koskinen said his office is encouraging people across the  
country to engage in conversations with local utilities and public 
services, to make sure they are taking action to correct Y2K 
problems. 
</P>
<P>
	The concern is that many computers that use only two digits to  
read dates will mistake the year 2000, or ``00,'' as 1900, causing 
computers to malfunction or break down. 
</P>
<P>
	Koskinen said that as a common-sense precaution Americans should  
have on hand at least battery-powered radios and flashlights and a 
three-day supply of water and food. ``It's going to be a long 
weekend in the middle of winter.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The administration is satisfied, he said, that nuclear weapons  
around the world are safe because they can only be launched through 
human intervention. 
</P>
<P>
	The one concern with the Russians is a breakdown in their  
nuclear weapons early warning system. ``If it goes down and they go 
blind in effect, then the level of anxiety could increase so we are 
trying to make sure that doesn't happen.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Koskinen said banks and financial firms are ready, and there is  
no chance of bank accounts being lost, although people should keep 
paper copies of recent financial transactions. 
</P>
<P>
	He also said that State Department, in future updates about the  
risks of visiting foreign nations, would offer advice about 
possible Y2K problems. While developed countries are generally 
making progress in fixing their computers, some developing 
countries are not coping as well.

<HEADLINE> Clintons Campaign Side by Side </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HAUPPAUGE, N.Y. (AP) -- Bill and Hillary Clinton were on familiar  
yet foreign terrain during a fund-raising weekend in New York. They 
were comfortably campaigning side by side -- but this time she, not 
he, was the candidate. 
</P>
<P>
	For the first time, the Clintons jointly spoke to New Yorkers  
about Hillary Rodham Clinton's exploratory bid for New York's open 
Senate seat, and together they raised some $400,000 for her 
expected run. 
</P>
<P>
	President Clinton, noting twice in one speech that ``I'm not  
running for anything,'' urged New Yorkers to vote for his wife as 
the pair campaigned with an ease born of more than two decades' 
practice. 
</P>
<P>
	And while still officially coy about whether she is really a  
candidate for the 2000 race, Mrs. Clinton drank in the enthusiasm 
of Democratic donors at four mostly big-dollar events over two 
days. 
</P>
<P>
	``Mrs. Clinton is happy to have the president join with her this  
weekend,'' Mrs. Clinton's campaign spokesman, Howard Wolfson, said 
Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Clinton expects to bring in about $800,000 from a two-week  
string of events attached to the family's vacation, Wolfson said. 
</P>
<P>
	First came a pair of $1,000-a-plate events on the Massachusetts  
resort islands of Nantucket and Martha's Vineyard last weekend. The 
vacation money hunt will end with two events Thursday in 
Skaneateles, N.Y. 
</P>
<P>
	The Clintons also squeezed in a house-hunting visit in  
Westchester County, N.Y., where Mrs. Clinton has said she would 
like to settle after her family leaves the White House. If she 
decides to run for the New York seat, she must establish residency 
before Election Day. 
</P>
<P>
	A president's spouse has never run for independent office. Mrs.  
Clinton has never held public office, and she has never lived in 
New York. Her candidacy here is predicated on opportunity -- 
Democratic Sen. Daniel Patrick Moynihan is retiring, and the state 
has welcomed big-name outsiders before. 
</P>
<P>
	Yet what began months ago as far-fetched idea has apparently  
grown on both the president and Mrs. Clinton. 
</P>
<P>
	Until now, Clinton has endorsed Mrs. Clinton's candidacy only  
from afar. He has called her well qualified, and said he would 
support her choice whether she runs or not. 
</P>
<P>
	On Saturday, he called her the most talented person he had ever  
met in public life, and fondly described a commitment to public 
service shared over their 28 years together. 
</P>
<P>
	``You ought to send her to the Senate and give her a chance to  
serve,'' Clinton told supporters who paid $1,000 apiece for a 
barbecue supper with the Clintons. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Clinton beamed as young Democrats chanted ``Hill-a-ry,  
Hill-a-ry,'' at one party, and reminded supporters of her 
independent record of public service. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton smiled, too, and whispered excitedly with his wife.  
</P>
<P>
	Clinton has 17 months left in his second term, and is already  
campaigning to make Vice President Al Gore his White House 
successor. He will also campaign more for Mrs. Clinton, although 
there is nothing specific scheduled, Wolfson said. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm not running for anything,'' a rueful Clinton said Saturday  
night. ``I kind of hate it, actually, and I wish I still could, but 
I can't.'' 
</P>
<P>
	As if to underscore that point, Clinton went golfing the next  
afternoon while his wife was the top draw at a $5,000-a-person 
fund-raising lunch for 75 at the Long Island home of fashion 
designer Vera Wang. 
</P>
<P>
	The lunch menu included chilled melon soup and striped bass.  
Clinton popped into a market for a doughnut en route to the golf 
course. 
</P>
<P>
	Proceeds from the lunch benefit Mrs. Clinton's exploratory  
campaign and Democratic candidates generally, Wolfson said. 
</P>
<P>
	She will need an estimated $20 million if she runs. Mrs.  
Clinton, who formed her exploratory committee on July 6, does not 
have to report to the Federal Election Commission until later in 
the year. 
</P>
<P>
	Her likely Republican opponent, New York City Mayor Rudolph  
Giuliani, has reported raising $2.6 million by June 30.

<HEADLINE> Warner Rams' Starter by Default </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ST. LOUIS (AP) -- The St. Louis Rams' best-laid plans for a  
turnaround season are in the hands of a quarterback known only for 
his exploits in the Arena Football League and NFL Europe. 
</P>
<P>
	Kurt Warner, who has one quarter of NFL experience, became the  
starter by default when Trent Green suffered a season-ending knee 
injury in a 24-21 preseason victory over the San Diego Chargers on 
Saturday night. 
</P>
<P>
	Green tore the anterior cruciate ligament, sustained a  
third-degree sprain of the medial collateral ligament in his left 
knee and also had cartilage damage. 
</P>
<P>
	Reconstructive surgery will be scheduled when the swelling  
subsides, in about 2-3 weeks. Dr. Robert Shively, the team 
physician, estimated the recovery period at 13 months. 
</P>
<P>
	``I knew it was gone,'' Green said. ``I just felt it grind and  
snap. I heard the whole thing. It was a very uncomfortable 
situation.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Rams acquired quarterback Paul Justin from the Oakland  
Raiders as insurance Sunday, giving up a seventh-round pick in next 
year's draft. 
</P>
<P>
	But for now it's ``Kurt Who?'' in the most visible spot as the  
Rams try to field a winning team for the first time this decade. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm confident in my ability and the coaches are confident in  
my ability,'' Warner said. ``Now it's time to go out and prove to 
the rest of the world that I can be successful.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Warner, 28, led NFL Europe in passing yards, attempts,  
completions and touchdowns in 1998 for the Amsterdam Admirals. 
Before that, he passed for 10,164 yards and 183 touchdowns in three 
seasons with the Iowa Barnstormers of the Arena Football League. 
</P>
<P>
	Last season, he beat out Will Furrer for the third-string job  
with the Rams. He was inactive the first 14 games and his only 
action came in the season finale, a 38-19 loss at San Francisco, in 
which he was 4-for-11 for 39 yards. 
</P>
<P>
	Now, suddenly, he's the man. He was in for only four plays in  
the second half Saturday night before coach Dick Vermeil, who had 
the second stringers in by that point, took him out to protect the 
new meal ticket. Rookie Joe Germaine, a fourth-round pick, went the 
rest of the way. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's paid his dues,'' Vermeil said.  
</P>
<P>
	``He's going to do a great job,'' Green said. ``He's had an  
outstanding offseason and I've spent a lot of time working with 
him. I'm going to be in his corner 100 percent and help him however 
I can.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Warner has huge shoes to fill even though Green, 29, has only  
one year experience as a starter. Green signed a four-year, $16.5 
million free-agent deal with the Rams after a breakthrough season 
with the Washington Redskins. 
</P>
<P>
	Green threw for 3,441 yards and 23 touchdowns in 14 starts last  
year, and led Washington to a 6-3 finish. In the preseason, he was 
28-of-32 for 406 yards with two touchdowns and one interception, 
and showed much better pocket presence than his predecessor, Tony 
Banks. 
</P>
<P>
	That all changed after Chargers strong safety Rodney Harrison,  
blitzing on the play, lunged at the back of Green's knees just 
after a pass was thrown. It wasn't a late hit, but Green's 
teammates felt it was unnecessary. 
</P>
<P>
	Offensive tackle Fred Miller, who went after Harrison and drew a  
personal foul, hoped the NFL would fine Harrison. Miller noted 
Harrison also took a couple of shots to the head of wide receiver 
Isaac Bruce, drawing an unnecessary roughness call on one of them. 
</P>
<P>
	``You could totally tell the guy was truly out to hurt  
somebody,'' Miller said. ``That's just the type of player he is and 
that we saw on film. He likes to come up and give a couple cheap 
shots.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Harrison made the Pro Bowl last year, but he also has a  
reputation as a dirty player. He said, however, that if he had it 
to do over again he wouldn't have even blitzed. 
</P>
<P>
	``Sometimes the way I play is judged in a different light,''  
Harrison said. ``I know in my heart that when I'm out there I try 
to play fair, try to play hard and do anything for my team to win. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't try to do anything intentional. I'm sorry he's injured  
and everything, but I was just playing football.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Green, who played with Harrison in San Diego in 1994, was  
critical of the play. But he didn't call for the league to fine or 
suspend him. 
</P>
<P>
	``I wasn't real happy with the way it turned out once I saw  
it,'' Green said. ``No matter what they decide, it's not going to 
make my knee heal any faster.'' 
</P>
<P>
	For Green, it's time to move on.  
</P>
<P>
	``It's another hurdle, it's another obstacle,'' he said. ``I'm  
just going to work my tail off and get ready for next year.'' 
</P>
<P>
	For Warner, it's time for a crash course.  
</P>
<P>
	``I'm willing to take anything anybody can give to me and I'm  
ready to learn,'' Warner said. ``I feel good with the skills I've 
got that I'm ready to keep fine-tuning every day, every minute, 
every hour.''

<HEADLINE> Parents Told To Study Sportsmanship </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Fed up with bad behavior in the stands, some  
youth sports leaders are requiring parents to get training in 
sportsmanship. 
</P>
<P>
	It's an attempt to suppress outbursts that have ranged from  
berating referees, coaches and even the parent's own kids to 
joining in full-fledged brawls on the field. 
</P>
<P>
	``We all live through our kids, whether we think so or not, and  
therefore we do some very strange things,'' said Fred Engh, 
president of the National Alliance for Youth Sports, West Palm 
Beach, Fla., an organization of coaches, sports officials and 
parents in varied sports. 
</P>
<P>
	Pressure to win at all costs is taking the joy out of youth  
sports, Engh said. The anxiety increases as organizations lose 
track of the value of simply having kids play. Youth leagues are 
modeling themselves after high-stakes pro teams and making the 
championship game the point of the season, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	And parents are approaching their children's leagues with the  
same venom that adults show at pro sports, where stadiums are being 
built with holding cells, Engh said. 
</P>
<P>
	``Because sports are so popular in our society, it's anathema  
for us to think our child will sit in the dugout,'' he said. ``We 
desperately have to have our child be the star.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Game tension, coupled with parents' seeming lack of  
understanding of how to control themselves, can turn a kids' game 
into a pressure-cooker, Engh said. So his organization has 
developed a method to teach parents, among other things, 
self-control. 
</P>
<P>
	The Parents Association for Youth Sports program is being tested  
before being launched to national alliance affiliates, said 
Kathleen Avitt, the parents association's national program 
director. 
</P>
<P>
	The new program is an upgrade from the current method of having  
a coach talk with parents and give them educational material, Avitt 
said. Parents will join the association, take training and possibly 
face being discharged from membership if they fail to meet 
standards. ``We are trying to hold them responsible for their 
actions,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition to meeting with coaches, parents will view a video,  
receive a handbook, wear buttons that promote sportsmanship and 
sign a code of ethics, Avitt said. 
</P>
<P>
	Among the handbook's advice: ``Make only positive, encouraging  
comments to the players on both teams. Remember, making mistakes is 
part of the learning process -- don't criticize.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Among the points in the code of ethics: ``I will place the  
emotional and physical well-being of my child ahead of a personal 
desire to win. I will remember that the game is for youth -- not for 
adults.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Other organizations also target parental behavior, although they  
do not go so far as to require membership in an additional 
organization. 
</P>
<P>
	As far as he knows, no other youth sports group would require  
parents to join a separate organization that allows the possibility 
of being dismissed from membership for bad behavior, said Jon 
Butler, executive director of the Pop Warner football national 
organization in Langhorne, Pa. 
</P>
<P>
	Pop Warner lets its individual league handle parental education  
in sportsmanship, Butler said. 
</P>
<P>
	Butler was dubious about the value of having parents join an  
organization that is not one in which their children play. The 
parents' bottom line is whether their children are in the game, so 
the possibility of disciplining parents through an auxiliary group 
may not be that big a threat, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	At the American Youth Soccer Organization, team officials start  
educating parents of children in the under-6 and under-8 leagues, 
said Doug Semark, director of education at the group's Hawthorne, 
Calif., headquarters. 
</P>
<P>
	Among the tools is a parent's code that tells parents they ``are  
not participants on their child's team.'' It advises them: 
``Support all efforts to remove verbal and physical abuse from 
youth sporting activities.'' 
</P>
<P>
	How to handle issues of sportsmanship is left up to the  
organization's regions, spokeswoman Amy Williams said. She has 
heard of officials requiring parents to sign the code. 
</P>
<P>
	But the soccer organization does not see a need for separate  
parental education, Semark said. Coaches, referees and other 
officials are trained in how to defuse confrontations involving 
parents, he said. And sportsmanship should be taught as part of the 
entire sports experience, not in isolation, he said.

<HEADLINE> Foreign Automakers Go After Trucks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DETROIT (AP) -- Detroit's sales cliche of the '90s sums it up:  
Trucks are hot, cars are not. 
</P>
<P>
	Oh, Detroit automakers still sell plenty of coupes and sedans.  
But the big bucks are in sport utility vehicles, pickups and 
minivans. 
</P>
<P>
	That's why General Motors Corp., Ford Motor Co. and the Chrysler  
unit of DaimlerChrysler AG have quietly tolerated the way Asian and 
European automakers have steadily increased their share of the car 
market in the last few years. When it comes to high-profit trucks, 
Detroit still rules -- for now. 
</P>
<P>
	But with light truck sales approaching half of the U.S. market,  
Asian and European automakers are aggressively going after a larger 
piece of that profit pie. 
</P>
<P>
	Toyota Motor Corp., having learned some lessons from its  
underpowered and overpriced T100 pickup, replaced it in June with 
the larger, V8-powered Tundra. Toyota also plans to begin producing 
a full-size SUV late next year at its new plant near Princeton, 
Ind. 
</P>
<P>
	Honda Motor Co. announced plans in May for a new plant in  
Alabama to build SUVs, minivans or both. The Japanese automaker 
can't produce enough of its new Odyssey minivans to meet demand. 
</P>
<P>
	Nissan Motor Co.'s new Xterra SUV is selling well. Nissan's  
expected to produce a sport utility-pickup combo and is thinking 
about a full-size pickup, too. Mitsubishi Motors Corp. and Hyundai 
Motor Co. have plans to export new SUVs to the U.S. market. 
</P>
<P>
	Among European automakers, Volkswagen has said it may build a  
big pickup for the U.S. market, probably from the SUV it's 
developing with Porsche. BMW plans to start production of its first 
SUV next year. 
</P>
<P>
	Consumers already are benefitting from the increased competition  
by way of rebates and discount financing from some U.S. 
manufacturers. 
</P>
<P>
	The Tundra is generating the most attention in Detroit because  
it represents the first credible challenge to the only segment that 
Chevrolet, GMC, Ford and Dodge still own outright: full-size 
pickups. Reviewers have praised the American-built Tundra for its 
car-like ride and Toyota-level attention to detail. 
</P>
<P>
	Toyota sold 11,818 Tundras in June and July, the fastest U.S.  
start of any new Toyota. That compares with only 7,959 T100s sold 
in all of 1998. Nevertheless, Tundra's initial splash generated but 
a ripple in the pickup market. 
</P>
<P>
	During those same two months, Ford sold 151,649 F-series pickups  
-- the nation's top-selling vehicle -- and GM unloaded 133,862 of its 
big pickups. 
</P>
<P>
	But based on Toyota's track record in cars, Detroit has reason  
to be nervous. 
</P>
<P>
	``Each of the domestics is taking a good, hard look at the  
Tundra to determine if it really does represent a big threat,'' 
said George Peterson, who heads the industry consulting firm 
AutoPacific Inc. ``It could almost be a Trojan horse, because 
Princeton is only starting off with 100,000-unit capacity but it 
could go up to 600,000 over the decade.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Japan's big automakers have a history of starting out modestly  
and ratcheting up the pressure. When Toyota built its Camry plant 
in Georgetown, Ky., a decade ago, its initial capacity was 150,000 
cars. Today it churns out about 500,000, and the Camry has become 
nation's best-selling car. 
</P>
<P>
	Donald Esmond, general manager of Toyota Motor Sales USA Inc.'s  
Toyota division, said Toyota needed a strong entry in the big truck 
market to retain customers who have been trading in their cars for 
``personal use'' pickups. 
</P>
<P>
	``With our current lineup, only about 38 percent of our products  
are in trucks,'' he said. ``We're just adjusting to where the 
market is going.'' 
</P>
<P>
	So is Detroit worried? Not especially.  
</P>
<P>
	GM still sells fewer trucks than cars in the United States, but  
is boosting capacity to meet the demand for its new full-size 
pickups and SUVs. President G. Richard Wagoner Jr. said the shift 
of foreign automakers into the big truck market hasn't been felt 
yet. 
</P>
<P>
	``But it puts more of an edge on what we need to do,'' Wagoner  
said. ``We've got to innovate more with product, we've got to make 
sure we've got enough capacity, we've got to keep working the cost 
and quality side. We're doing all that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Another threat from overseas is in the minivan market, now  
dominated by DaimlerChrysler. All three Detroit automakers have 
been forced to offer sizable discounts on their minivans, in part 
because of Honda's fast-selling Odyssey. 
</P>
<P>
	``The Odyssey's a real threat,'' Peterson said. ``Honda doesn't  
have enough capacity at the moment, but they're adding it very 
quickly.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Kevin Tourneur, senior product planner for DaimlerChrysler's  
minivan operations, notes that Chrysler, Dodge and Plymouth 
minivans are selling at about the same rate as last year, before 
the Odyssey hit the market. 
</P>
<P>
	``We outsell them 10 to 1,'' Tourneur said. ``We don't focus on  
them.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But as other foreign makes jump into the market, DaimlerChrysler  
may have to shift its focus. 
</P>
<P>
	``Where they're at risk is when you get maybe three or four  
competitors that are only taking 30,000 to 50,000 units away 
annually,'' Andrea said. ``Then, all of a sudden 
(DaimlerChrysler's) volume's down to where they can no longer 
support two full assembly plants for minivans. That's a problem.''

<HEADLINE> China To Raise Unemployment Funds </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BEIJING (AP) -- China will raise stipends to unemployed workers  
by 30 percent as part of a series of measures intended to arrest 
the economic slide and brighten public sentiment ahead of the 
country's 50th anniversary of communist rule. 
</P>
<P>
	Labor and Social Security Minister Zhang Zuoji promised that  
increased payments would begin before the Oct. 1 anniversary. 
</P>
<P>
	Pensions are also to be raised by varying degrees, Zhang told  
the executive committee of China's legislature, according to state 
media. 
</P>
<P>
	The announcements were made as Beijing prepared its second  
large-scale rehearsal of the planned Oct. 1 parade and performance 
by a half-million people on Tiananmen Square. Police closed off 
streets leading to the square late Saturday, and buses brought in 
students and others for the practice session. 
</P>
<P>
	Unemployment has soared as once centrally planned industries  
trim bloated payrolls to cope with free-market reforms. With 
millions of Chinese trying to survive on meager stipends, the 
communist leadership has worried about the potential for unrest. 
</P>
<P>
	Zhang told the Standing Committee of the National People's  
Congress that more than 7.4 million urban workers lost their jobs 
in the first half of the year, and 5.4 million of them have not 
found new work. 
</P>
<P>
	Prices have fallen for 22 months in a row, unaffected by  
interest rate cuts that have failed to ignite consumer spending. 
</P>
<P>
	Before the welfare increases, the average jobless worker  
received a $20 stipend and another $10 for life, medical and 
unemployment insurance, the Xinhua News Agency reported. 
</P>
<P>
	But Zhang said 300,000 workers laid off this year never received  
their stipends. He noted that many local governments had been 
unable to collect sufficient revenues to cover the payments. 
</P>
<P>
	The government also has announced a 30 to 40 percent pay  
increase for civil servants, and halved a tax on fixed-asset 
investments.

<HEADLINE> Strike at Detroit Schools Looms </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DETROIT (AP) -- Hoping to stave off a threatened strike by  
teachers, officials of Detroit Public Schools and the union backing 
its educators pressed contract talks Sunday just two days from the 
scheduled start of classes in the state's largest district. 
</P>
<P>
	Administrators of the 172,000-student district -- under new  
management -- and Detroit Federal of Teachers bargainers have 
negotiated throughout the weekend over a new contract. 
</P>
<P>
	The union' old agreement expires Monday, with the union  
threatening a possible strike. 
</P>
<P>
	Issues mentioned as discussion topics have included merit pay,  
extended work days, class sizes and a plan by the district's newly 
appointed interim chief executive to give principals permission to 
``redeploy resources'' by terminating teachers. 
</P>
<P>
	Bargainers for both sides were negotiating Sunday night and  
could not be reached for comment. 
</P>
<P>
	The contract would be the first under the district's new  
management -- a ``reform board'' appointed by Mayor Dennis Archer 
after the GOP-controlled state Legislature dumped the district's 
former school board. 
</P>
<P>
	That move -- pushed by Gov. John Engler and signed into law in  
March -- followed what critics had called decades of declining 
performance, mismanagement and pork-barrel politics in Detroit 
schools. 
</P>
<P>
	The reform board has endorsed recommendations by David Adamany,  
hired in May as the district's interim CEO. But some of the 
proposals -- including merit pay -- require approval by the teachers' 
union, which has endorsed some parts of the plan and is hostile 
toward others. 
</P>
<P>
	A state law passed in 1994 restricts strikes by public school  
workers. The law imposes fines equal to a day's pay on public 
school employees who strike, bars walkouts over unfair labor 
practices and removes a number of items from the list of things 
that can be bargained, such as the number of days in the school 
year.

<HEADLINE> Tokyo Stocks Rise in Early Trading / Japanese Stocks  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TOKYO (AP) -- The dollar fell against the yen early Monday as  
U.S. funds sold the greenback. Japanese stocks rose moderately. 
</P>
<P>
	The dollar bought 110.88 yen, down 0.52 yen from late Friday in  
Tokyo and also below its late New York level of 111.56 yen on 
Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	The benchmark 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average gained 93.35  
points, or 0.53 percent, to 17,692.72 in the first 30 minutes of 
trading. On Friday, the average closed down 66.92 points, or 0.38 
percent. 
</P>
<P>
	In currency dealings, the dollar slid in early Asian trading on  
selling by U.S. funds that let go of the currency on a belief that 
Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan seems concerned about stock 
values. 
</P>
<P>
	In a speech at a Federal Reserve meeting in Jackson Hole,  
Wyoming, on Friday, Greenspan said the extraordinary rise in U.S. 
stock prices the last five years has been mostly inexplicable. 
Those remarks pushed the Dow Jones industrial average down on 
Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	The Dow closed down 108.28 points, or 1 percent, to 11,090.17 on  
Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	Market players were also watching the outcome of a meeting of  
deputy finance ministers of the Group of Seven industrialized 
countries, scheduled for Aug. 30-31 in Berlin. 
</P>
<P>
	In other currencies, the euro was traded at 116.41 yen, up from  
116.38 yen late Friday in Tokyo. 
</P>
<P>
	On the stock market, prices started higher on buying by foreign  
investors. But trading remained light as players waited to see 
whether the Berlin G-7 meeting would affect the dollar-yen exchange 
rate. 
</P>
<P>
	The broader Tokyo Stock Price Index of all issues listed on the  
first section was up 6.45 points, or 0.44 percent, to 1,484.83. The 
TOPIX closed down 2.70 points, or 0.18 percent, on Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	The yield on the benchmark No. 214 10-year Japanese government  
bond was unquoted early Monday. On Friday, it settled at 1.9400 
percent, with its price at 99.66 yen.

<P>
	CONWAY, Ark. (AP) -- Marketing services company Acxiom Corp. said  
it plans to reduce its work force by 5 percent, or about 250 
employees, in mid-September. 
</P>
<P>
	Acxiom spokesman Dale Ingram said the cuts will come from across  
the company's divisions. 
</P>
<P>
	``It will be our lowest contributors. We realize we have set the  
bar high, but that is why we are a successful company,'' Ingram 
said. ``We are also looking at other areas to improve our 
efficiency. We have a responsibility to our stockholders.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Acxiom, headquartered in Little Rock, also has branches in  
Conway, Chicago, Phoenix, England and Spain. The company has 5,000 
employees. 
</P>
<P>
	Acxiom provides marketing information, data warehousing and  
integration services, mailing list services, analysis and 
information technology services. 
</P>
<P>
	The cuts will not affect Acxiom's expansion project on its  
Conway campus or its new downtown Little Rock building that is 
expected to open in mid-2001, Ingram said. Acxiom officials said 
the two expansion projects would add 1,200 jobs in central 
Arkansas. 
</P>
<P>
	``We will continue to hire and recruit and grow,'' Ingram said.  
</P>
<P>
	Acxiom reported a fiscal 1999 loss of $16 million, but sales  
grew 57 percent to $730 million.

<HEADLINE> Oil Output Reductions Kept in Place </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CARACAS, Venezuela (AP) -- Venezuela, Mexico and Saudi Arabia  
will keep in place cuts in oil production aimed at lowering 
supplies and raising prices. 
</P>
<P>
	Oil ministers Ali Rodriguez of Venezuela, Luis Tellez of Mexico  
and Ali Naimi of Saudi Arabia said in a joint statement issued late 
Saturday that cuts agreed to earlier this year will remain intact 
through March 2000. 
</P>
<P>
	Prices for Venezuelan oil hit a 12-year low last year, provoking  
one of the country's worst recessions in years. Prices since then 
have nearly doubled, partly due to the countries' cutbacks. 
</P>
<P>
	The three nations agreed to a first round of cuts in March 1998  
and a second round last March. 
</P>
<P>
	Saudi Arabia, the world's largest oil producer, has reduced  
production by 1.3 million barrels a day, while Venezuela has cut 
back by 650,000 barrels a day, or 19.3 percent of its total 
previous output. Mexico has reduced its output by 200,000 barrels a 
day. 
</P>
<P>
	Venezuela and Saudi Arabia are members of the Organization of  
Petroleum Exporting Countries.

<HEADLINE> Striped Bass Are Back </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The fish guts covering the rocks along a  
secluded stretch of the Potomac River are a gruesome tribute to the 
return of the striped bass. 
</P>
<P>
	During the spring spawning run, poachers came by the hundreds to  
catch, clean and steal away with the prized stripers, known as 
rockfish in the Chesapeake Bay region. Washington Harbor Police 
Officer Dennis Hance worked himself ragged trying to catch the 
illegal fishermen, and even charged two men with having 138 striped 
bass. 
</P>
<P>
	``They were stuffing them in coolers, in bags; they had 'em  
hidden all over the boat,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Hance hates poachers but says there is good news behind all the  
arrests: ``The rockfish have come back.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Up and down the Atlantic Coast -- from the Potomac to the Hudson  
River, Chesapeake Bay to Narragansett Bay -- striped bass have 
returned in unprecedented numbers since the mid-1980s, when 
overfishing had plunged their populations to record lows. 
</P>
<P>
	For fisheries experts who have seen cod, swordfish, tuna and  
virtually every desirable fish species decline, striped bass are 
the only success story. For recreational fishermen, who dream about 
striped bass and watch videos such as ``Striper Magic,'' it's never 
been better. 
</P>
<P>
	``Years ago, if somebody caught a 5-pound striper up here,  
people would come running to see it,'' said Dan Ward, who has sold 
bait and rented boats at Fletcher's Boathouse on the Potomac since 
1969. This spring, fishermen hauled 15-pounders out of the water 
near Fletcher's. 
</P>
<P>
	Weekend fishermen who went years without any striped bass --  
prized because of their size, fight and taste -- have been renting 
charter boats, skipping out of work early and dusting off their 
rods. Bait and tackle shops say business is booming. 
</P>
<P>
	``There are so many rockfish in Chesapeake Bay. The fishing has  
been great,'' said Kitty Raver, who runs a charter boat out of 
Deltaville, Va., with her husband. 
</P>
<P>
	The striper boom has created some hot fishing spots in unlikely  
places. 
</P>
<P>
	``The Statue of Liberty is one of the best spots in New York  
Harbor,'' Manhattan charter boat captain Tony DiLernia said. 
</P>
<P>
	Businessmen in suits come to his boat after work, change into  
fishing clothes and reel in 25-pound stripers from beneath the 
Brooklyn Bridge. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a shock to some people. They say, `My God, what is this  
beautiful creature doing here?''' DiLernia said. 
</P>
<P>
	Striped bass can grow as large as 60 or 70 pounds; several  
125-pounders were landed in North Carolina in 1891. They are a 
weekend angler's dream because they hug the coastline, making them 
easy to catch from shore. They range from northern Florida to Nova 
Scotia. 
</P>
<P>
	The hardy anadromous fish (they live in fresh and salt water)  
have even been introduced in numerous inland lakes and to the 
Pacific Coast, where they can now be found from Mexico to Canada. 
</P>
<P>
	Chesapeake Bay is the nursery for the Atlantic. Most Atlantic  
striped bass spawn in the Chesapeake's tributaries, such as the 
Potomac, then swim up the coast in search of migrating schools of 
menhaden and other bait fish before returning south to spend their 
winters in warmer waters. 
</P>
<P>
	In the 1970s, the striped bass population was robust:  
Recreational fishermen filled their freezers and commercial 
fishermen netted large schools, taking even the fish that were too 
young to spawn. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1973, nearly 15 million pounds of striped bass were harvested  
commercially, according to a Marine Fisheries report. ``It seemed 
like they were endless,'' said Dick Schaefer of the National Marine 
Fisheries Service. 
</P>
<P>
	But by 1983, the commercial catch had dropped to less than 3  
million pounds. The recreational catch also dropped dramatically. 
</P>
<P>
	``I remember as a kid watching my father reel in enormous  
stripers in Narragansett Bay in the '70s, but by the time I was old 
enough to fish for them myself they were gone,'' said John Torgan, 
spokesman for the Narragansett Bay environmental group Save the 
Bay. 
</P>
<P>
	Because striped bass were so popular among recreational  
fishermen, including many politicians, Congress was able to enact 
the Emergency Striped Bass Study and enact restrictions. 
</P>
<P>
	``The smoking gun was overfishing,'' Schaefer said.  
</P>
<P>
	Despite loud cries from the commercial industry, fishing for  
striped bass was eliminated in federal waters. Maryland took strong 
action by implementing a moratorium on the recreational and 
commercial catch. Other states from Virginia to Maine followed. 
</P>
<P>
	As more fish were allowed to spawn, the stocks rose. The  
four-year moratorium in the Chesapeake was lifted, but this time 
stringent restrictions were left in place. States now have fishing 
seasons, size restrictions and limit people to one ``keeper'' per 
day. 
</P>
<P>
	Today, rockfish are more plentiful in Chesapeake Bay than at any  
time since researchers began assessing the stock 50 years ago. Some 
researchers are even concerned the population may be too large. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a success story. I've been in this business over 40 years  
and this is probably the only major success story I've ever been 
involved in,'' Schaefer said. ``We as a nation have found it very 
difficult to keep a hard line on conservation, but I think that's 
starting to change. People are realizing that the oceans are not 
infinite.''

<HEADLINE> Islands Evacuated As Dennis Nears </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WRIGHTSVILLE BEACH, N.C. (AP) -- Hurricane Dennis wallowed along  
the coast toward the Carolinas on Sunday, prompting evacuation 
orders for the fragile Outer Banks barrier islands and giving 
conflicting signals on whether it would hit land. 
</P>
<P>
	The hurricane was less than 200 miles south of the North  
Carolina coast by late afternoon, with its top wind revved up 
slightly to 105 mph, and it had edged slightly toward the east. A 
hurricane warning was posted for much of the coast of North 
Carolina. 
</P>
<P>
	Dennis was expected to continue turning toward the northeast,  
with a chance the worst of it would miss land. But its track was 
far from certain, the National Hurricane Center said. 
</P>
<P>
	``It weaves and bobs as it goes along,'' Jerry Jarrell, the  
center's director. ``It's been holding its own, but I've noticed 
the eye is very large, it's huge, and if that eye goes through one 
of those cycles where it contracts, it certainly could intensify, 
and that would bring it closer to the coast and even over the 
coast.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He also cautioned that because of the hurricane's size, with  
tropical storm-force wind extending up to 175 miles from the center 
on Sunday, ``it doesn't have to come across the coastline to cause 
pretty strong winds.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Forecasters said wind approaching hurricane force could reach  
the Cape Fear area near North Carolina's southernmost tip by early 
Monday afternoon. 
</P>
<P>
	Well in advance of the storm, Gov. Jim Hunt on Sunday afternoon  
declared both a state of emergency and a state of disaster, which 
aides said allowed him to activate any resources necessary to cope 
with the storm. 
</P>
<P>
	Wrightsville Beach declared an 8 p.m. curfew Sunday, and Seymour  
Johnson Air Force Base sent aircraft to bases in Ohio to escape the 
storm. New Hanover County at Wilmington said schools, courts and 
offices would be closed Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	The storm was already kicking up high waves Sunday for surfers  
on the Outer Banks. 
</P>
<P>
	``Today was really, really big,'' Brian Schwartz said after  
surfing before going to work at Bert's Surf Shop on Nags Head. 
``You had to be a little cautious, but we had a lot of fun rides.'' 
</P>
<P>
	At 5 p.m. EDT Sunday, Dennis was centered 195 miles south of  
Wilmington, N.C. It had turned slightly east of due north and had 
quickened its pace to 13 mph, with maximum sustained wind near 105 
mph, up from 100 mph during the night. 
</P>
<P>
	A hurricane warning was in effect for the North Carolina coast  
from the South Carolina state line to Oregon Inlet, near Nags Head. 
A tropical storm warning extended from Oregon Inlet northward to 
Chincoteague, Va., and southward as far as Savannah, Ga. 
</P>
<P>
	Along North Carolina's sandy, low-lying Outer Banks chain of  
barrier islands, evacuations started at 1 p.m. Sunday south of 
Oregon Inlet and at noon on Ocracoke Island. Ocracoke is accessible 
only by boat, and ferry service will continue as long as the 
weather permits, said Peter Stone at the Ocracoke ferry office. 
</P>
<P>
	There weren't many people on the island, said Terry Gray at the  
Hatteras Island ferry office. ``We haven't been haulin' a whole 
lot,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Red flags were posted along Wrightsville Beach, warning swimmers  
of possible rip currents. Last year, a 10-year-old swimmer at 
Atlantic Beach drowned in a rip current before Hurricane Bonnie 
arrived. 
</P>
<P>
	Out of the water, the approaching storm hadn't slowed business  
yet for Kitty Hawk Kites, which operates hang-gliding classes on 
the huge Jockey's Ridge sand dune on the Outer Banks, about 50 
miles north of Cape Hatteras. Melissa Lim said several people went 
hang gliding Sunday morning and classes were held during the day. 
</P>
<P>
	``The winds right here are not really that strong,'' she said  
early in the afternoon. 
</P>
<P>
	Georgia's emergency management officials began to relax Sunday  
as forecasts showed Hurricane Dennis bypassing the state. ``We're 
starting to uncross our fingers very slowly,'' said Phillip Webber, 
the Chatham County Emergency Management Agency director. 
</P>
<P>
	Dennis blew through the northern Bahamas on Saturday. Few homes  
were severely damaged, but several boats sank at marinas, said 
James Sweeting, assistant manager of the Divers Down dive shop on 
Treasure Cay. 
</P>
<P>
	Silt stirred up by the storm will likely kill parts of the coral  
reefs that draw divers to the islands, he said. ``It'll grow back, 
but it's not going to look as pretty for a couple of months,'' said 
Sweeting.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Wins Pan Pacific Swim Meet </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SYDNEY, Australia (AP) -- Even after winning six golds at the Pan  
Pacific championships, Jenny Thompson hasn't decided how many 
events she will enter in next year's Olympics. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm not sure what I'll do,'' Thompson said after helping the  
United States to a narrow victory over Australia. ``It was pretty 
tough coming right out of the medal ceremony and into the swim, but 
I'm sure other people will be in the same situation.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Thompson was involved in two of the U.S. team's three golds on  
Sunday's final day, while Australia's Grant Hackett won the other. 
</P>
<P>
	The United States and Australia finished with 13 golds each, but  
the U.S. team won on points -- 391 to 372 -- and had 35 medals 
overall to Australia's 32. 
</P>
<P>
	The Olympics are returning to Australia, and the same pool where  
the Pan Pacific's were held, next year for the first time since the 
1956 Melbourne Olympics. That was the last time the Aussies won 
more golds than the United States at a major meet. 
</P>
<P>
	For the first time in eight days, no world record records were  
broken, leaving the final tally at 12. 
</P>
<P>
	The American men's 400 medley team got the final gold of the  
meet, finishing ahead of an Australian team later disqualified. 
</P>
<P>
	Hackett fought a cold to win the 1,500 gold medal and extend  
Australia's lead to two golds with the two medley relays remaining. 
</P>
<P>
	Thompson, who won the 50 freestyle, also helped the U.S. team,  
which included Barbara Bedford, Megan Quann and Liesl Kolbisen, win 
the butterfly leg in a U.S. team. 
</P>
<P>
	Then Lenny Krayzelburg, Kurt Grote, Dod Wales and Neil Walker  
pressured the Australian team into a false start between Geoff 
Huegill's butterfly leg and Michael Klim's freestyle for the final 
100 meters. 
</P>
<P>
	Hackett overcame a severe head cold to post the third-fastest  
time in history in the 1,500 freestyle. His 14 minutes, 45.6 
seconds was just 4.06 outside Kieren Perkin's 1994 world record. 
</P>
<P>
	The victory continued Australia's unbeaten run in the event at  
major championships since German Jorg Hoffmann won the 1991 world 
title, and Hackett said he was now ready to take the time under 
14:40. 
</P>
<P>
	``I haven't had a fantastic week,'' Hackett said. ``I was a bit  
sick. I just wanted to get up and win that event and then, to do 
that, the world record's not that far off now.'' 
</P>
<P>
	South African Ryk Neethling narrowly missed breaking the  
15-minute barrier, but clocked his fastest of 15:02.40 for silver. 
</P>
<P>
	Chris Thompson finished in 15:04.68, sixth-fastest by an  
American and best since 1988.

<HEADLINE> Clintons Campaign Side by Side </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HAUPPAUGE, N.Y. (AP) -- Bill and Hillary Clinton were on familiar  
yet foreign terrain during a fund-raising weekend in New York. They 
were comfortably campaigning side by side -- but this time she, not 
he, was the candidate. 
</P>
<P>
	For the first time, the Clintons jointly spoke to New Yorkers  
about Hillary Rodham Clinton's exploratory bid for New York's open 
Senate seat, and together they raised some $400,000 for her 
expected run. 
</P>
<P>
	President Clinton noted twice in one speech Saturday that ``I'm  
not running for anything,'' and urged New Yorkers to vote for his 
wife. 
</P>
<P>
	Repeating the line in another speech Sunday, Clinton added:  
``That was before Hillary started running for something, and I have 
to be here in a different role.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Clinton has trolled for votes alongside her husband since  
his earliest campaigns in the 1970s in Arkansas. And while still 
officially coy about whether she is really a candidate for her own 
race in 2000, Mrs. Clinton drank in the enthusiasm of Democratic 
donors at four mostly big-dollar events over two days. 
</P>
<P>
	Campaigning together with an ease born of more than two decades'  
practice, the Clintons attended a $25,000-a-couple dinner Sunday 
night at a Bridgehampton mansion. 
</P>
<P>
	As she often does, Mrs. Clinton introduced her husband to the  
crowd of about 100. 
</P>
<P>
	He closed his speech with a plug for her campaign.  
</P>
<P>
	``Mrs. Clinton is happy to have the president join with her this  
weekend,'' Mrs. Clinton's campaign spokesman, Howard Wolfson, said 
Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Clinton expects to bring in about $800,000 from a two-week  
string of events attached to the family's vacation, Wolfson said. 
</P>
<P>
	First came a pair of $1,000-a-plate events on the Massachusetts  
resort islands of Nantucket and Martha's Vineyard last weekend. The 
vacation money hunt will end with two events Thursday in 
Skaneateles, N.Y. 
</P>
<P>
	The Clintons also squeezed in a house-hunting visit in  
Westchester County, N.Y., where Mrs. Clinton has said she would 
like to settle after her family leaves the White House. If she 
decides to run for the New York seat, she must establish residency 
before Election Day. 
</P>
<P>
	A president's spouse has never run for independent office. Mrs.  
Clinton has never held public office, and she has never lived in 
New York. Her candidacy here is predicated on opportunity -- 
Democratic Sen. Daniel Patrick Moynihan is retiring, and the state 
has welcomed big-name outsiders before. 
</P>
<P>
	Yet what began months ago as far-fetched idea has apparently  
grown on both the president and Mrs. Clinton. 
</P>
<P>
	Until now, Clinton has endorsed Mrs. Clinton's candidacy only  
from afar. He has called her well qualified, and said he would 
support her choice whether she runs or not. 
</P>
<P>
	On Saturday, he called her the most talented person he had ever  
met in public life, and fondly described a commitment to public 
service shared over their 28 years together. 
</P>
<P>
	``You ought to send her to the Senate and give her a chance to  
serve,'' Clinton told supporters who paid $1,000 apiece for a 
barbecue supper with the Clintons. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Clinton beamed as young Democrats chanted ``Hill-a-ry,  
Hill-a-ry,'' at one party, and reminded supporters of her 
independent record of public service. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton smiled, too, and whispered excitedly with his wife.  
</P>
<P>
	Clinton has 17 months left in his second term, and is already  
campaigning to make Vice President Al Gore his White House 
successor. He will also campaign more for Mrs. Clinton, although 
there is nothing specific scheduled, Wolfson said. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm not running for anything,'' a rueful Clinton said Saturday  
night. ``I kind of hate it, actually, and I wish I still could, but 
I can't.'' 
</P>
<P>
	As if to underscore that point, Clinton went golfing the next  
afternoon while his wife was the top draw at a $5,000-a-person 
fund-raising lunch for 75 at the Long Island home of fashion 
designer Vera Wang. 
</P>
<P>
	The lunch menu included chilled melon soup and striped bass.  
Clinton popped into a market for a doughnut en route to the golf 
course. 
</P>
<P>
	Proceeds from the lunch benefit Mrs. Clinton's exploratory  
campaign and Democratic candidates generally, Wolfson said. 
</P>
<P>
	She will need an estimated $20 million if she runs. Mrs.  
Clinton, who formed her exploratory committee on July 6, does not 
have to report to the Federal Election Commission until later in 
the year. 
</P>
<P>
	Her likely Republican opponent, New York City Mayor Rudolph  
Giuliani, has reported raising $2.6 million by June 30.

<HEADLINE> Running Stag Wins Saratoga Feature </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SARATOGA SPRINGS, N.Y. (AP) -- Running Stag staged a determined  
rally to post a half-length victory over Catienus on Sunday in the 
$300,000, Grade II Saratoga Breeders' Cup. 
</P>
<P>
	Ridden by Shane Sellers and carrying 122 pounds, Running Stag  
covered 1 1/4 miles in 2:01, the fastest clocking in the five times 
the race has been run at that distance. 
</P>
<P>
	Golden Missile was another half-length back in third.  
</P>
<P>
	Owned by Richard J. Cohen and trained by Philip Mitchell,  
Running Stag made his U.S. debut at Suffolk Downs on May 29 in the 
Grade II Mass 'Cap, finishing second to Behrens. He won his next 
start, the Grade II Brooklyn Handicap at Belmont Park on June 12, 
winning by 7 1/4 lengths. 
</P>
<P>
	Following a fifth-place finish in Great Britain's Grade I  
Eclipse Stakes at Sandown, Running Stag jetted back for this race. 
</P>
<P>
	After shadowing Early Warning and Nite Dreamer through the first  
seven furlongs, Running Stag moved to challenge assuming the lead 
as he neared the quarter-pole. He widened his lead to two lengths 
in midstretch and then held off Catienus. 
</P>
<P>
	Running Stag earned $180,000 and returned $4, $2.80 and $2.30.  
Catienus paid $3.60 and $2.70, while Golden Missile was $3 to show.

	ATLANTA (AP) -- There is a growing complacency about HIV,  
especially among some people most at risk, health officials said 
Sunday at the first ever national conference addressing efforts to 
monitor and prevent the spread of the virus. 
</P>
<P>
	More than 2,000 scientists, doctors, researchers and advocates  
are in Atlanta this week for the National HIV Prevention Conference 
organized by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and 17 
other sponsoring organizations. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's becoming increasingly difficult to get people to pay  
attention to HIV prevention and that in and of itself is a primary 
reason for this conference,'' said Dr. Helene Gayle, director of 
the CDC's National Center for HIV, STD, and TB Prevention. 
</P>
<P>
	``Despite a growing complacency about the need for HIV  
prevention, HIV remains a serious disease that is still very much 
with us and there is a greater need for HIV prevention today more 
than ever,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	During the four-day conference, federal officials will release  
the latest national data on trends in HIV and AIDS deaths and 
infection rates for the general population. Statistics on 
prisoners, unrecognized factors contributing to the spread of HIV, 
and results from a new HIV test will also be released. 
</P>
<P>
	In the nearly two decades since the first cases of AIDS were  
reported, the deadly virus has claimed more than 300,000 lives. The 
good news is that the number of new HIV infections has dropped from 
about 100,000 a year to 40,000. 
</P>
<P>
	But at the same time, the epidemic is taking a greater toll on  
women and minorities, especially blacks who are becoming infected 
with AIDS at record rates, federal health officials said. 
</P>
<P>
	In the mid 1980s, blacks represented about 25 percent of the new  
cases of AIDS reported, Hispanics about 14 percent and women 8 
percent, U.S. Surgeon General David Satcher said. By 1997-98, 
blacks made up 45 percent of the cases, Hispanics 22 percent and 
women 23 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	``One of the major concerns we have about the AIDS epidemic is  
that increasingly it is affecting communities that tend to be left 
out of the health care and public health system,'' Satcher said. 
``We know that in order to be successful we have to find a new way 
to reach these communities.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Much of the effort now being made to fight the epidemic is  
devoted to care and treatment when more needs to be directed toward 
prevention in order to control the epidemic, experts say. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have demonstrated that prevention works and deserves  
support,'' said Dr. Jeffrey Koplan, head of the CDC. 
``Nevertheless, as in most areas of public health, support for 
prevention is frequently more rhetorical than substantive.''

<HEADLINE> Carey Shoots Scenes at NFL Stadium </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CLEVELAND (AP) -- It was an easy assignment: Fans of the  
Cleveland Browns just had to show up at the team's football arena -- 
and act rowdy. 
</P>
<P>
	More than 5,000 fans did just that Sunday at the new Cleveland  
Browns Stadium while Drew Carey shot scenes for a Sept. 29 episode 
of his ABC television show. 
</P>
<P>
	Many fans wore the team's brown and orange colors and some even  
had their faces painted as they barked in the stadium's ``Dawg 
Pound,'' the bleacher section that is home to the team's loudest 
fans. 
</P>
<P>
	Carey is a Cleveland native and a big sports fan. ``The Drew  
Carey Show'' has a Cleveland flavor, including opening dance scenes 
shot on city streets and a bar with a working-class attitude. 
</P>
<P>
	Carey owns his childhood home in the city's Old Brooklyn  
neighborhood, where you can get a Carey-style flattop haircut for 
$6.

<HEADLINE> Deere Launches Internet Service </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MOLINE, Ill. (AP) -- Deere and Co. wants to dig some furrows in  
cyberspace. 
</P>
<P>
	The company is launching an Internet service aimed at the  
agricultural industry. Officials hope it will become the America 
Online of agriculture. 
</P>
<P>
	The plan is for the public to be able to obtain such things as  
commodities prices and weather updates. Officials say another 
service will allow farmers to store their data, which can be 
managed and analyzed by the service. 
</P>
<P>
	Deere's agriculture expansion plans also include increasing its  
share of the overseas farm equipment market. The company plans to 
look especially at India and China. It has already expanded into 
such countries as Mexico and Brazil.

<HEADLINE> High Hopes for US-North Korea Talks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SEOUL, South Korea (AP) -- An upcoming meeting between the United  
States and North Korea is expected to serve as a ``turning point'' 
in resolving Cold War tensions on the divided Korean peninsula, a 
South Korean government official said Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	Unification Minister Lim Dong-won made the remarks after  
returning from a weeklong trip to the United States, during which 
he met with William Perry, Washington's point man on North Korea 
</P>
<P>
	``I expect the U.S.-North Korea meeting in Berlin next month to  
be a turning point in resolving Korea issues,'' Lim told reporters. 
``It's difficult to predict, but I'm hopeful of the results of the 
meeting.'' 
</P>
<P>
	U.S. envoy Charles Kartman and North Korean Vice Foreign  
Minister Kim Gye Gwan will meet in Berlin Sept. 7-11. Washington's 
top priority in the talks, meanwhile, is to persuade North Korea to 
forgo testing a long-range missile. 
</P>
<P>
	North Korea sent shock waves through the region a year ago by  
firing a three-stage rocket that sailed over Japan and landed in 
the Pacific. 
</P>
<P>
	``For now, there are no new signs that North Korea would go  
ahead with plans to test-launch a missile,'' Lim said. 
</P>
<P>
	Apparently bowing to threats of economic and diplomatic  
penalties by the United States, Japan and South Korea, North Korea 
said last week it was willing to resolve the missile dispute 
through negotiations. 
</P>
<P>
	On Saturday, North Korea announced plans to participate in the  
Berlin talks and said it would use them to urge the United States 
to lift economic sanctions in place against it for nearly a 
half-century. 
</P>
<P>
	U.S., South Korean and Japanese officials warned North Korea  
that it faced economic and diplomatic penalties if it test fires 
the missile. But they also stress that North Korea will get aid and 
other benefits if it suspends its missile program. 
</P>
<P>
	A North Korean promise to forgo a missile test launch could lead  
to discussion of wide-ranging measures to improve ties between 
Washington and Pyongyang, Lim said. 
</P>
<P>
	Perry, a former defense secretary, has been assigned to review  
Washington's North Korea policy. He visited the country in May and 
presented what the United States was willing to do to improve ties 
if Pyongyang curbs missile and nuclear weapons programs. 
</P>
<P>
	The United States promised to improve diplomatic relations and  
ease economic sanctions against North Korea under a 1994 agreement 
that required the North to freeze and eventually dismantle its 
nuclear weapons program. 
</P>
<P>
	Under the deal, the United States, South Korea and Japan are  
building two safer nuclear reactors worth $4.6 billion in North 
Korea. 
</P>
<P>
	But the agreement did not cover the North's new missiles. This  
has put the Clinton administration in the difficult position of 
making a separate appeal to Pyongyang. 
</P>
<P>
	The United States fought on South Korea's side in the 1950-53  
Korean War.

<HEADLINE> Firefighter Dies in Calif. Blaze </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	Firefighters battling flames on thousands of acres of Western  
brushland on Sunday had a grim reminder of the danger after a 
California firefighter died fighting a blaze north of Santa 
Barbara. 
</P>
<P>
	Rescuers found Stephen Joseph Masto, 28, in steep terrain of the  
Los Padres National Forest on Saturday after he didn't return to 
camp. Officials said it wasn't clear how he died and there was no 
evidence of burns. 
</P>
<P>
	``This may have been his first wildfire,'' said Michael  
Kotowski, a battalion chief with the Santa Barbara city fire 
department were Masto was stationed. He said Masto had volunteered 
to help fight the 180-acre blaze. 
</P>
<P>
	Despite strong, shifting winds Sunday, fire officials across the  
West expressed cautious hope of controlling fires that have been 
raging for the last week in several states. 
</P>
<P>
	More than 200,000 acres have burned.  
</P>
<P>
	``The best news is that we're very slowly getting containment  
around most of the fires,'' said Alleah Haley, a fire information 
officer for the California Department of Forestry in Butte County. 
</P>
<P>
	``The bad news is that we're expecting 20-30 mph winds. We're  
holding all our resources, hoping for the best and being prepared 
for the worst,'' Haley said. 
</P>
<P>
	Blazes in the Northern California county charred 32,879 acres.  
Two major fires were surrounded, and firefighters were gaining the 
upperhand on three others. 
</P>
<P>
	In the mountains northeast of Los Angeles, high, erratic winds  
caused the evacuation of two sparsely populated desert communities 
north of a 6,000-acre fire burning near the resort town of Lake 
Arrowhead, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
	A fire in the Stanislaus National Forest that forced the closure  
of Highway 120 into Yosemite National Park was contained after 
burning 4,028 acres, but officials kept about 1,000 firefighters on 
the scene for fear of flareups. The highway was reopened Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	Several small fires in Southern California closed some mountain  
highways but caused little damage and no injuries, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
	In Nevada, crews had contained the largest fire, 45,000 acres  
north of Reno, but a blaze 80 miles southwest of Ely had burned 
10,000 acres and was still raging. And in Washington State, smaller 
fires near the Columbia River and Major Creek were under control 
Sunday afternoon. 
</P>
<P>
	Light rain in Oregon lessened the threat of several small  
lightning-sparked fires. A 1,500-acre grass fire on the Warm 
Springs Indian Reservation in north-central Oregon was contained, 
officials said. 
</P>
<P>
	Even with the dangers they face, firefighters from Masto's Santa  
Barbara department line up to help fight the big wildfires, 
Kotowski said. 
</P>
<P>
	``Everyone loves to go. It's a great assignment, very  
exciting,'' he said. ``In fact, it's such a popular assignment that 
we have a formal rotation. Steve was next up. You can decline to 
go, but he certainly didn't. He wanted to go.''

<HEADLINE> P&AMP;G Chair To Raise Money for Museum </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CINCINNATI (AP) -- John Pepper, who is retiring as chairman of  
Procter &AMP; Gamble Co. Wednesday, said his next endeavor is to be a 
fund-raiser for the National Underground Railroad Freedom Center. 
</P>
<P>
	``My role in this is certainly going to be to raise money,''  
Pepper told the Cincinnati Enquirer for Sunday's editions. ``But 
I'm also involved in this ... to try to help ensure that we achieve 
our mission.'' 
</P>
<P>
	That mission is to build not just a museum, but an interactive  
learning center where visitors can experience the stories of 
escaped slaves and white abolitionists. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's one thing to say we're going to put the historical  
artifacts in and have re-creations of runaway slave stories,'' 
Pepper said. ``But it's another to say we're not only going to do 
that, but we're going to find a way for visitors to interact around 
that experience in a way they can then project into their own 
life.'' 
</P>
<P>
	So far, about $25 million has been raised for the center, set to  
open in 2003 on the Cincinnati waterfront. Beginning in early 
October, Pepper will help lead a nationwide fund-raising tour to 
tap corporate contributions. The goal is to raise about $90 
million. 
</P>
<P>
	Pepper, 61, said the initiative will consume much of his time  
after he retires as head of P&AMP;G's board. He will be replaced by 
Durk I. Jager, who also succeeded Pepper as Cincinnati-based P&AMP;G's 
president and chief executive Jan. 1. 
</P>
<P>
	Procter &AMP; Gamble is the maker of the household mainstays Tide,  
Crest, Pringles and Pampers. As president of the company, Pepper 
helped expand P&AMP;G's U.S. business and push average annual growth to 
14 percent and shareholder return to 37 percent annually.

<HEADLINE> Jospin Disappointed Over Megabank </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PARIS (AP) -- French Prime Minister Lionel Jospin expressed his  
disappointment Sunday over the failure of efforts to create a 
French megabank, saying that a fusion would have been desirable. 
</P>
<P>
	However, Jospin said efforts to force a merger between the  
Banque Nationale de Paris and Societe Generale, which opposed its 
rival's hostile takeover bid, would have created instability in the 
French financial system. 
</P>
<P>
	French regulators on Saturday ruled that BNP could not keep its  
stake in Societe Generale, leaving BNP with the investment bank 
Paribas, the smaller of its two targets in a hostile takeover bid. 
</P>
<P>
	``One could wish that a regrouping of BNP, Societe Generale and  
Paribas be implemented,'' Jospin told a meeting of the Socialist 
Party in La Rochelle in western France. 
</P>
<P>
	``But it could only happen in an ordered and mutually agreed  
upon way without causing great risks of instability for the French 
financial system, for the economy and for employment,'' he added. 
</P>
<P>
	Jospin also said he hoped that his government could continue to  
assist in the consolidation of the French banking sector. 
</P>
<P>
	In March, BNP launched a hostile takeover bid for both Societe  
Generale and Paribas, which were in the process of a friendly 
merger. While BNP won a comfortable majority in Paribas, it won 
only 31.8 percent of the voting rights of Societe Generale. 
</P>
<P>
	BNP claimed it had a big enough stake to effectively control  
Societe Generale, which fiercely rejected the claim. When both 
banks refused to compromise, regulators were forced to step in. 
</P>
<P>
	The regulators ruled that BNP's stake was insufficient to  
guarantee it effective control over Societe Generale. 
</P>
<P>
	Michel Pebereau, the chairman of BNP said in an interview  
published Sunday in the Journal du Dimanche that he still believed 
that BNP had enough shares to exercise effective control over 
Societe Generale, but that he did not intend to try again. 
</P>
<P>
	``For us, this operation is finished. We prefer to devote our  
efforts to putting in place BNP-Paribas which is the first French 
bank, the third in Europe in terms of assets and the eighth in 
terms of market capitalization.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The BNP chief also said he would seek out new partners in  
Europe. 
</P>
<P>
	``BNP by itself wanted to develop its banking activities in Asia  
and Eastern Europe,'' Pebereau said. ``With our increased means, we 
want to seek partnerships in Europe.''

<HEADLINE>  Islands Evacuated As Dennis Nears </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WRIGHTSVILLE BEACH, N.C. (AP) -- Hurricane Dennis moved along the  
coast toward the Carolinas on Sunday, prompting evacuation orders 
for the fragile Outer Banks barrier islands. Conditions were 
expected to worsen overnight, but it looked like the brunt of the 
storm might miss land. 
</P>
<P>
	The hurricane was about 160 miles south of the North Carolina  
coast by the evening, with its top wind revved up slightly to 105 
mph, and it had edged slightly toward the east. A hurricane warning 
was posted for much of the coast of North Carolina. 
</P>
<P>
	Dennis was expected to continue turning toward the northeast.  
The storm's track was far from certain, the National Hurricane 
Center said. 
</P>
<P>
	``It weaves and bobs as it goes along,'' Jerry Jarrell, the  
center's director. ``It's been holding its own, but I've noticed 
the eye is very large, it's huge, and if that eye goes through one 
of those cycles where it contracts, it certainly could intensify, 
and that would bring it closer to the coast and even over the 
coast.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He also cautioned that because of the hurricane's size, with  
tropical storm-force wind extending up to 175 miles from the center 
on Sunday, ``it doesn't have to come across the coastline to cause 
pretty strong winds.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Forecasters said winds approaching hurricane force could pass  
off the coast of Cape Fear near North Carolina's southernmost tip 
at sunrise Monday. Hurricane force winds were expected to remain 
offshore. 
</P>
<P>
	Well in advance of the storm, Gov. Jim Hunt on Sunday afternoon  
declared both a state of emergency and a state of disaster, which 
aides said allowed him to activate any resources necessary to cope 
with the storm. 
</P>
<P>
	Wrightsville Beach declared an 8 p.m. curfew Sunday, and Seymour  
Johnson Air Force Base sent aircraft to bases in Ohio to escape the 
storm. New Hanover County at Wilmington said schools, courts and 
offices would be closed Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	The storm was already kicking up high waves Sunday for surfers  
on the Outer Banks. 
</P>
<P>
	``Today was really, really big,'' Brian Schwartz said after  
surfing before going to work at Bert's Surf Shop on Nags Head. 
``You had to be a little cautious, but we had a lot of fun rides.'' 
</P>
<P>
	At 9 p.m. EDT Sunday, Dennis was centered 150 miles south of  
Wilmington, N.C. It had turned slightly east of due north and had 
quickened its pace to 13 mph, with maximum sustained wind near 105 
mph. 
</P>
<P>
	A hurricane warning was in effect for the North Carolina coast  
from the South Carolina state line to Oregon Inlet, near Nags Head. 
A tropical storm warning extended from Oregon Inlet northward to 
Chincoteague, Va., and southward as far as Savannah, Ga. 
</P>
<P>
	Along North Carolina's sandy, low-lying Outer Banks chain of  
barrier islands, evacuations started at 1 p.m. Sunday south of 
Oregon Inlet and at noon on Ocracoke Island. Ocracoke is accessible 
only by boat, and ferry service will continue as long as the 
weather permits, said Peter Stone at the Ocracoke ferry office. 
</P>
<P>
	There weren't many people on the island, said Terry Gray at the  
Hatteras Island ferry office. ``We haven't been haulin' a whole 
lot,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Red flags were posted along Wrightsville Beach, warning swimmers  
of possible rip currents. Last year, a 10-year-old swimmer at 
Atlantic Beach drowned in a rip current before Hurricane Bonnie 
arrived. 
</P>
<P>
	Out of the water, the approaching storm hadn't slowed business  
yet for Kitty Hawk Kites, which operates hang-gliding classes on 
the huge Jockey's Ridge sand dune on the Outer Banks, about 50 
miles north of Cape Hatteras. Melissa Lim said several people went 
hang gliding Sunday morning and classes were held during the day. 
</P>
<P>
	``The winds right here are not really that strong,'' she said  
early in the afternoon. 
</P>
<P>
	Georgia's emergency management officials began to relax Sunday  
as forecasts showed Hurricane Dennis bypassing the state. ``We're 
starting to uncross our fingers very slowly,'' said Phillip Webber, 
the Chatham County Emergency Management Agency director. 
</P>
<P>
	Dennis blew through the northern Bahamas on Saturday. Few homes  
were severely damaged, but several boats sank at marinas, said 
James Sweeting, assistant manager of the Divers Down dive shop on 
Treasure Cay. 
</P>
<P>
	Silt stirred up by the storm will likely kill parts of the coral  
reefs that draw divers to the islands, he said. ``It'll grow back, 
but it's not going to look as pretty for a couple of months,'' said 
Sweeting.

	Georgia's emergency management officials began to relax Sunday  
as forecasts showed Hurricane Dennis bypassing the state. ``We're 
starting to uncross our fingers very slowly,'' said Phillip Webber, 
the Chatham County Emergency Management Agency director. 
</P>
<P>
	Dennis blew through the northern Bahamas on Saturday. Few homes  
were severely damaged, but several boats sank at marinas, said 
James Sweeting, assistant manager of the Divers Down dive shop on 
Treasure Cay. 
</P>
<P>
	Silt stirred up by the storm will likely kill parts of the coral  
reefs that draw divers to the islands, he said. ``It'll grow back, 
but it's not going to look as pretty for a couple of months,'' said 
Sweeting.

<HEADLINE> V.Williams a Favorite To Win Open </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Venus Williams is ready to win the U.S. Open.  
</P>
<P>
	``I've been ready since the first time,'' she said.  
</P>
<P>
	That was two years ago, when she made her U.S. Open debut and  
landed spectacularly in the final -- only to fall victim to the 
pressure and the near perfect play of top-ranked Martina Hingis. 
</P>
<P>
	``I guess it wasn't the right time,'' Williams said.  
</P>
<P>
	The right time might be now.  
</P>
<P>
	Williams cast herself as the favorite with a straight-sets  
thrashing Saturday of reigning U.S. Open and Wimbledon champion 
Lindsay Davenport in the final of a tune-up tournament in New 
Haven, Conn. 
</P>
<P>
	``In the past, Lindsay overpowered me,'' the 19-year-old  
Williams said. ``But I've gotten older and stronger, and I have 
better technique.'' 
</P>
<P>
	That was evident in Williams' blistering groundstrokes, huge  
serves and quicker court coverage, all too much for the 23-year-old 
Davenport to handle. 
</P>
<P>
	``Venus is going to be tough to beat,'' Davenport said of  
Williams' chances at the Open. ``She's athletic and extremely fast. 
Those are some great assets to have.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Williams, who has won five titles this year, will enter the Open  
at a career- best No. 3 ranking. 
</P>
<P>
	Though there will be four former U.S. Open champions -- Hingis,  
Davenport, Monica Seles and Arantxa Sanchez-Vicario -- in the field 
when play starts Monday, Williams now knows she has the game and 
disposition to beat them all. Just as important, her rivals know 
it, too. 
</P>
<P>
	Williams, who routed Seles before taking on Davenport in New  
Haven, has overcome her tendency to rush on the court and succumb 
to a flurry of errors. She doesn't let the pressure of big matches 
get to her as much anymore. She has broadened her arsenal to the 
point where she can win with long rallies as confidently as she win 
with her serve. 
</P>
<P>
	The men's draw has all the usual suspects as potential champions  
-- No. 1 Pete Sampras going for his fifth U.S. Open title and a 
record 13th Grand Slam championship; No. 2 Andre Agassi seeking to 
build on his French Open victory and runner-up finish at Wimbledon; 
and Patrick Rafter looking for a third straight U.S. Open win. 
</P>
<P>
	But there are newcomers who could topple any of them, and none  
are more dangerous than the tall young Russian, Marat Safin, who 
faces Sampras in the first round. 
</P>
<P>
	Mark Philippoussis, who played in his first Grand Slam final at  
last year's U.S. Open, withdrew from this year's tournament 
Saturday because of a knee injury. 
</P>
<P>
	Felix Mantilla will be moved into the 11th-seeded Philippoussis'  
place in the draw and will be seeded 17th. 
</P>
<P>
	Philippoussis injured the cartilage in his left knee in June  
during his quarterfinal match at Wimbledon with Sampras. After 
resting for about six weeks, he returned at Indianapolis two weeks 
ago and lost his first match. He withdrew from the Hamlet Cup last 
week. 
</P>
<P>
	Last year, in the first all-Australian men's final at the U.S.  
Open since 1970, Philippoussis lost to Rafter in four sets.

<HEADLINE> Holbrooke Urges Multiethnic Society </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) -- Emphasizing the magnitude of  
rebuilding Kosovo, Richard Holbrooke on Sunday commended U.N. peace 
efforts and stressed the need to work toward a multiethnic and 
democratic society. 
</P>
<P>
	Calling Kosovo ``the ultimate test of the U.N.'s capability and  
potential,'' Holbrooke underlined the complexity of the problems 
that continue to plague the province, some 2 1/2 months after the 
arrival of international peacekeepers. 
</P>
<P>
	The three-day trip is Holbrooke's first abroad since being  
confirmed U.S. ambassador to the United Nations earlier this month. 
He helped broker the 1995 Dayton accord that ended the 3 1/2-year war 
in Bosnia and later served as President Clinton's special envoy to 
Yugoslavia. 
</P>
<P>
	``This place has been a mess for a long time, but a different  
kind of mess. The war was messy, the decade that preceded the war 
was messy, the history back to 1912 was messy ... and the task is 
immense,'' said Holbrooke, following a meeting with Bernard 
Kouchner, the top U.N. official in Kosovo. 
</P>
<P>
	Holbrooke congratulated Kouchner on improving security in the  
province, but also voiced concern over continuing ethnic-based 
attacks on Kosovo's minorities. 
</P>
<P>
	Since the arrival of NATO-led peacekeepers, revenge killings and  
violence by ethnic Albanians targeting Serbs have derailed 
international attempts to establish normality. 
</P>
<P>
	Following his meeting with Serb leaders, Holbrooke expressed  
concern over attacks on Serbian Orthodox religious buildings. 
</P>
<P>
	``These are world heritage sites and anyone destroying them,  
whatever their reasons, whatever their religion, whatever their 
motivation should know that is a criminal vandal act and people 
must respect religious sites,'' Holbrooke said, following a meeting 
with Kosovo's Serb leaders. 
</P>
<P>
	But he rejected a Serb proposal to create separate enclaves for  
Kosovo's dwindling Serb population. 
</P>
<P>
	Holbrooke also met with Hashim Thaci, the leader of the Kosovo  
Liberation Army. Thaci said that he and Holbrooke agreed on ``the 
complete demilitarization of the KLA ... We believe that by the 
19th of September, the KLA will be completely demilitarized.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Holbrooke also met with moderate ethnic Albanian leader Ibrahim  
Rugova. 
</P>
<P>
	In Belgrade, the Beta news agency reported that peacekeepers on  
Sunday blocked the road leading from southern Serbia to Gnjilane in 
Kosovo, turning back a number of Serbs trying to reach their 
relatives. American peacekeepers in the area could not immediately 
confirm the report. 
</P>
<P>
	BETA quoted a peacekeeping source as saying the roadblock was a  
security measure because of possible attacks by the KLA. The 
situation has deteriorated in the area since two Serbs disappeared 
earlier in the week. 
</P>
<P>
	Serb sources in Gnjilane, as quoted by BETA, said a group of  
Serb farmers was attacked, beaten and robbed on Saturday by Kosovo 
Albanians when they tried to bring their produce to a market in the 
town.

<HEADLINE> Study Finds Exec's Pay Rises Faster </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Top American corporate executives have seen  
their paychecks more than quadruple during the 1990s while factory 
workers' wage increases only slightly outpaced inflation, says a 
study by liberal advocacy groups. 
</P>
<P>
	Average worker pay rose from $22,952 a year in 1990 to $29,267  
in 1998, up 28 percent compared with the 22.5 percent inflation 
rate, said the report released Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, average compensation packages for the top two  
executives at the nation's 365 biggest public companies -- including 
manufacturing and other industries -- rose from $1.8 million in 1990 
to $10.6 million in 1998. That is equivalent to a 481 percent 
raise. 
</P>
<P>
	The study compared Labor Department statistics tracking wages of  
nonsupervisory workers in the manufacturing industry during the 
1990s with trends in compensation packages for corporate executives 
as reported by Business Week magazine and other private sources. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's a big fairness problem here. While the headlines are  
saying the economy is doing so wonderfully, the benefits of that 
are not being spread around equitably,'' said Sarah Anderson, one 
of the report's authors. 
</P>
<P>
	``A Decade of Executive Excess: The 1990s'' was a joint project  
of the Institute for Policy Studies in Washington and United for a 
Fair Economy, a Boston-based group that targets economic 
inequality. 
</P>
<P>
	A business critic of the report said it was flawed because it  
included stock options for executives, whose value can fluctuate 
depending on the market. 
</P>
<P>
	But he acknowledged there are differences in compensation.  
</P>
<P>
	``Obviously there is a considerable distinction between the  
lowest and the highest paid, and my reaction to that is, `So what? 
It's a market-driven society,''' said Charles Peck, an executive 
compensation specialist at The Conference Board, a New York-based 
research and networking organization supported by the memberships 
of corporate executives. 
</P>
<P>
	The Conference Board keeps its own statistics on executive  
compensation. By its latest count of salaries and cash bonuses 
only, executive pay in the manufacturing industry averaged $783,000 
in 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	The pay disparities may hurt morale and the spirit of teamwork  
at a company, said Chuck Collins, co-director of United for a Fair 
Economy. He also suggested that CEOs holding huge stock options 
have a financial incentive to base management decisions 
disproportionately on what will please investors in the short term 
rather than what's best for the company, workers or communities.

<HEADLINE> General Challenge Wins at Del Mar </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DEL MAR, Calif. (AP) -- General Challenge followed in Best Pal's  
big hoofprints in winning Sunday's $1 million Pacific Classic at 
Del Mar. 
</P>
<P>
	General Challenge became the first 3-year-old to win Del Mar's  
biggest race since Best Pal won the first running in 1991, powering 
into the lead going into the far turn and winning the 1 1/4-mile race 
by three lengths over River Keen. 
</P>
<P>
	And like Best Pal, General Challenge was bred at Golden Eagle  
Farm in nearby Ramona. 
</P>
<P>
	General Challenge's victory came nine months after Best Pal died  
of an apparent heart attack at Golden Eagle Farm, where he had 
stood since his retirement from racing in early 1996. Best Pal was 
seventh in career earnings among thoroughbreds -- and first among 
California-breds -- with $5,668,245. 
</P>
<P>
	``The original was something special with Best Pal,'' said John  
Mabee, owner of Golden Eagle Farm and chairman of the board at Del 
Mar. ``Maybe there's a little bit less joy here, and tears. 
</P>
<P>
	``But this is a special race for the Mabees. Like I told Bob  
(Baffert), I'd rather win this race than the Kentucky Derby.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``He did say that,'' the trainer interjected. ``I'm telling you,  
he's crazy.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Baffert had a 1-2 finish, as he also trains River Keen.  
</P>
<P>
	Then again, given General Challenge's rough ride in the Kentucky  
Derby, perhaps Mabee's right. Rattled after being sandwiched 
between horses on the first turn, General Challenge finished 11th 
in the Derby. 
</P>
<P>
	But he was strong Sunday even though he broke slowly out of the  
gate and found himself in traffic on the first turn as Smile Again 
and Barter Town led the field of eight. 
</P>
<P>
	``I didn't rush him,'' jockey David Flores said. ``I was just  
trying to be in a good position. That first turn was a little 
tight. I was just playing it by ear. On the back side I just let 
him roll.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Flores said General Challenge, the 5-2 second betting choice who  
earned $700,000, lives up to name. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's not an easy horse. I can feel it that he was really,  
really going. There's no way he was going to stop,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	General Challenge beat a field that was more notable for the  
horses that were missing rather those who did reach the starting 
gate. In the last few weeks, injuries knocked out Mazel Trick, Real 
Quiet and Victory Gallop. 
</P>
<P>
	General Challenge won in 2:00 2-5.  
</P>
<P>
	``This is truly a gifted horse,'' Baffert said. ``One day, when  
he gets it together, he'll be something special. He's that good.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Mabee said he plans to enter General Challenge in the Breeders'  
Cup Classic. 
</P>
<P>
	River Keen finished 2 1/4 lengths ahead of Barter Town, with  
another two lengths back to Lazy Lode. Malek, the 6-5 favorite, 
never got into the race and finished fifth, a head behind Lazy 
Lode. Rounding out the field were the long shots Smile Again, Jack 
Grandi and Such Charisma. 
</P>

	General Challenge paid $7.20, $5.20 and $4.40. River Keen, a 7-1  
choice ridden by Chris Antley, returned $6.80 and $5.20, while 
Barter Town, ridden by Kent Desormeaux, was $6.20.

	Baffert and Flores scored another big victory when top  
2-year-old filly Chilukki won the $250,000 Vinery Del Mar 
Debutante. In winning her fifth straight race, Chilukki beat Spain 
by a length and paid $2.40 to win.

<P>
	In a mishap early in the race, Princess Melissa ducked in  
sharply and went over the inner rail, throwing rider Garrett Gomez. 
Princess Melissa sustained lacerations on her right shoulder and 
Gomez was taken to a clinic for X-rays after complaining about 
soreness in his neck.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Enjoys Donuts, Dollars, Golf </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	EAST HAMPTON, N.Y. (AP) -- Golf and doughnuts, Sunday dinner for  
$900,000 and a magazine photo shoot. Just another day of vacation, 
Clinton style. 
</P>
<P>
	President Clinton, who is spending the weekend with his family  
at the home of filmmaker Steven Spielberg, began a leisurely day by 
sitting for a photo spread for George magazine and strolling 
through the center of this posh Long Island town. 
</P>
<P>
	Later Sunday, Clinton was the featured speaker at a dinner that  
raised about $1 million for the Democratic National Committee and 
first lady Hillary Rodham Clinton's exploratory committee for the 
2000 Senate race. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton ended a stock speech about Democratic commitment to  
education, the elderly and good economic stewardship by calling his 
wife ``the ablest, the smartest, the most passionately committed'' 
public servant he has known. 
</P>
<P>
	A Suffolk County, N.Y., police officer took a spill on his  
motorcycle as the president's motorcade made its way to dinner, at 
the Bridgehampton estate of film producer Jane Rosenthal and her 
husband, Craig Hatkoff. The officer got up quickly and appeared to 
be fine, but the ambulance that travels in the motorcade paused to 
check on him. 
</P>
<P>
	Rock singer Jon Bon Jovi entertained for a crowd of about 100  
that included model Christie Brinkley and actor Robert de Niro. 
</P>
<P>
	White House officials said the photo shoot was for a George  
piece in memory of its creator, John F. Kennedy Jr., that was 
focusing on people Kennedy had admired. Other figures included 
Muhammad Ali and Madeleine Albright. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton then took his motorcade into the center of East Hampton,  
bringing the town to a standstill as he shook hands with passersby 
and picked up a dozen donuts from Dreesen's, a local market. 
</P>
<P>
	Continuing up the street, the president popped into Babette, a  
bistro featuring a mix of Asian and nouvelle American dishes, 
including truffled halibut. But he didn't stay to eat, returning to 
chat out of earshot of the press with a few dozen well-wishers who 
had gathered outside. 
</P>
<P>
	In full vacation mode, the president headed to the links,  
ignoring questions from reporters about the violence surrounding 
the referendum overseas Monday on East Timor's independence from 
Indonesia and recent revelations about the standoff between the FBI 
and the Branch Davidians near Waco, Texas. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton, whose golf occasionally was frustrated by inclement  
weather during the first week of his family vacation on Martha's 
Vineyard, teed off strong and straight Sunday under sunny skies at 
the nine-hole South Fork Country Club. 
</P>
<P>
	Accompanying Clinton were the club's pro and the 18-year-old  
winner of a club tournament -- both of whose first shots skipped 
into the long grass by a water hazard -- and businessman Fred Mack.

<HEADLINE> Elton John Call for Diana Memorial </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LEEDS, England (AP) -- Sir Elton John has called for a permanent  
memorial to Princess Diana, saying it was ``about time someone did 
something.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Sir Elton, performing less than two months after having a heart  
pacemaker fitted, spoke to thousands of fans Sunday, two days 
before the second anniversary of Diana's death in a Paris car crash 
Aug. 31, 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	The singer, who was knighted after he moved the world when he  
sang a reworked version of his hit ``Candle in the Wind'' at 
Diana's funeral, was one of the late princess' close friends. They 
met in 1981. 
</P>
<P>
	The princess is buried on the Spencer family's Althorp estate,  
though there is no monument at her grave site. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's this weekend two years ago a friend of mine, a friend of  
ours, was tragically killed,'' John said Sunday as rain poured down 
during his outdoor concert. ``It's about time someone did something 
to remember her by way of a permanent memorial.'' 
</P>
<P>
	During the show, John, dressed in a purple suit and wearing red  
tinted glasses, joked about the pacemaker, patting his chest and 
said, ``Me and my mate say hello.''

<HEADLINE> Montana Upset Over New License Plate </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HELENA, Mont. (AP) -- In a land of shining mountains, rolling  
prairies and a legendary big sky, a state committee trying to build 
a better license plate finds itself mired in a swamp. 
</P>
<P>
	Criticism has poured in -- verbally, in print, by letter and  
e-mail -- since officials decided to do away with Montana's current 
plate in favor of a simpler one that's easier for law officers to 
read. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's dull, dead, ugly,'' Mary O'Bryan, of Harlem, said of the  
new plate. 
</P>
<P>
	The proposed plate is tinted light blue with stylized white  
streaks that are meant to suggest clouds. Plate numbers are black, 
with the words ``Montana'' and ``Big Sky Country'' printed above in 
dark blue. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are not a pastel population, nor are we burdened with a  
passive geography,'' wrote Michael Dunlap of Great Falls. ``We are 
rich in color, vista and history. Let's see some of that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Wrote Robert and Linda Sleight of Bigfork: ``Montana is robust,  
stunningly beautiful and full of character and color. The new plate 
should be all of these and it is none.'' 
</P>
<P>
	And a recent editorial in the Great FallsTribune added to the  
furor: ``Considering how much money we Montanans have to pay for 
our plates, we deserve nothing less than a captivating, 
heart-stirring image that will make us proud, by God, to climb 
behind the wheel.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``We're taking a lot of heat,'' acknowledged Dean Roberts, head  
of the state Motor Vehicle Division. 
</P>
<P>
	The current plate, in use for more than a decade, features a  
jagged mountain ridge topped with bands of orange and yellow 
suggesting a sunset. 
</P>
<P>
	Committee members figured most residents would like the new  
design. They, along with the graphic artist behind the design, were 
stunned by the outpouring of criticism. 
</P>
<P>
	``What's going on here?'' artist Annette Finstad asked when she  
saw a crowd of reporters and TV cameras at a meeting last week. 
``Hasn't anyone had a car wreck or a house burn down in the state 
of Montana?'' 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, the panel faces an Oct. 1 deadline to begin producing  
the plates at a state prison factory. Larry Fasbender, the 
committee chairman, doubts the perfect plate will be found. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's no way everyone is going to be pleased with this,'' he  
said.

<HEADLINE> Nicaragua Destroys 5,000 Mines </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MANAGUA, Nicaragua (AP) -- For the second time this year,  
Nicaragua destroyed 5,000 anti-personnel land mines from the 
country's arsenal Sunday, a step toward complying with an 
international land mine ban. 
</P>
<P>
	With Organization of American States Secretary-General Cesar  
Gaviria looking on, the mines were destroyed at a military base 11 
miles west of the capital, Managua. 
</P>
<P>
	Nicaragua has destroyed 10,000 of the 130,000 anti-personnel  
land mines in its arsenal as it seeks to comply with a land mine 
convention signed by 125 countries Dec. 4, 1997, in Ottawa. The 
first batch of 5,000 was destroyed in April. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition to destroying the mines in its arsenal, Nicaragua is  
working with the OAS to destroy thousands of mines planted in the 
1980's during the country's civil war between the leftist 
Sandinista government and U.S.-backed Contra rebels. 
</P>
<P>
	Nicaraguan army Maj. Jorge Castro told reporters that 54,000 of  
those mines have been destroyed, but 80,000 remain.

<HEADLINE> Dolphin RB's Injury Not Too Bad </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DAVIE, Fla. (AP) -- Miami Dolphins running back Cecil Collins got  
encouraging news Sunday when tests showed no new break in his 
injured right ankle, giving him a chance to heal in time for the 
season opener. 
</P>
<P>
	Coach Jimmy Johnson worried about a slight crack in the ankle  
after beating Detroit 31-10 in an exhibition Saturday night. But an 
MRI exam showed Collins aggravated an injury Collins sustained two 
years ago at LSU. 
</P>
<P>
	``He irritated it,'' Johnson said Sunday. ``I'm not too sure if  
they're going to cast it. He's in pretty good spirits. Everybody's 
optimistic.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Collins broke his right leg and damaged ankle ligaments in an  
October 1997 game against Vanderbilt. That turned out to be his 
last game at LSU. 
</P>
<P>
	The Dolphins' fifth-round draft pick will be on crutches for a  
few days and miss Thursday's exhibition finale at Green Bay. But 
there's a possibility he could be ready when Miami opens the season 
Sept. 13, a Monday-night showdown at Denver. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm glad it wasn't serious,'' Collins said. ``I'm going to  
work hard with the trainers to do everything I can to try and get 
ready as soon as possible.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Considered a first-round talent, Collins' draft stock fell  
because of legal problems that included a sex-abuse charge and a 
failed drug test. The Dolphins took him with the first pick of the 
fifth round. 
</P>
<P>
	Before the injury, he appeared to have wrested the starting job  
from Karim Abdul-Jabbar with his natural instinct and 
explosiveness. Despite gaining just 17 yards Saturday night, 
Collins leads the team with 34 carries for 144 yards -- more than 
double the yardage for any other Miami back.

<HEADLINE> Western Wildfires Still a Threat </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	Firefighters in the Western states were making progress Saturday  
on blazes that have burned more than 200,000 acres, though hot 
weather and frequent lightning strikes continued to pose a threat. 
</P>
<P>
	``It seems like things are stabilizing,'' said Janelle Smith, of  
the National Interagency Fire Center in Boise, Idaho. ``There are a 
lot of new lightning strikes but we are getting to them as best we 
can.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A week's worth of effort paid off Saturday, as firefighters  
approached containment on the largest fires. Crews then did a 
largely successful job of concentrating their efforts on new and 
remaining fires. 
</P>
<P>
	Nineteen large fires were burning in California, Nevada, Oregon  
and Texas, though nine were expected to be contained Sunday. Over 
200,000 acres had been consumed. 
</P>
<P>
	More than half of the fires were in Northern California, drawing  
more than 7,000 firefighters. The fires took up most of the state's 
firefighting budget only two months into the fiscal year. 
</P>
<P>
	Late Saturday, winds fanned flames of three California fires  
that began earlier in the day, burning thousands of acres in the 
San Bernardino National Forest, about 85 miles east of Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
	One blaze moved to within miles of a resort community near Lake  
Arrowhead, but evacautions had not been ordered early Sunday. 
Another area blaze caused the evacuation of a trailer park. 
</P>
<P>
	Nevada's biggest blaze, north of Reno, blackened 40,000 acres.  
Full containment was expected by Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	A fire near Oregon's Sheldon-Hart National Wildlife Refuge  
charred 30,000 acres and was expected to be contained by Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
	Texas National Guard helicopters were called out to battle a  
1,700-acre fire west of Lampasas. 
</P>
<P>
	A 600-acre blaze near Okanogan, Wash., was completely contained  
Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	Northern California's weekend weather was expected to be hot,  
but tempered by lower winds. Montana, eastern Idaho and Wyoming 
were to see some scattered thunderstorms. That would mean dangerous 
lightning but also rain.

<HEADLINE> Taiwan Nationalists Careful on China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TAIPEI, Taiwan (AP) -- Taiwan's Nationalists Sunday nominated  
Vice President Lien Chan to succeed President Lee Teng-hui and 
moved delicately to back Lee's controversial new affirmation of 
Taiwanese sovereignty without stoking a war of words with Beijing. 
</P>
<P>
	Debate at a weekend party convention was lively between Lee  
supporters and the party's more conservative pro-China wing, who 
call the president's July 9 call for ``state-to-state'' relations 
with China an unnecessary provocation of the mainland. 
</P>
<P>
	Ultimately, the issue was pushed to the sidelines as the badly  
divided party sought to convey the appearance of unity behind the 
ticket of Lien and vice presidential running mate Vincent Siew. 
</P>
<P>
	Lien, who has been seen as slow to capitalize on the positive  
public response to Lee's gambit, echoed but did not specifically 
mention Lee's call for parity with China in his acceptance address. 
</P>
<P>
	``If only China were to accord us respect and equal treatment,  
there would be nothing we couldn't negotiate, no area in which we 
couldn't cooperate,'' Lien told more than 1,000 party delegates 
gathered at Taipei's International Conference Center. 
</P>
<P>
	Taiwan wants ``equality, not enmity; symmetry, not opposition''  
in relations with China, Lien said. 
</P>
<P>
	Lien was running unopposed and his nomination to seek the  
presidency in next March's polls was a foregone conclusion. 
</P>
<P>
	But the gathering also displayed deep divisions among the  
Nationalist's leadership over the succession to Lee, with the 
marked absence of several top leaders who have either been 
cold-shouldered by the Lien camp or thrown in their lot with 
Nationalist renegade James Soong's rival presidential campaign. 
</P>
<P>
	The friction among party rivals largely overshadowed discussion  
of Lee's statement on China relations, which has infuriated the 
mainland and drawn concern from Washington over increased military 
tensions. 
</P>
<P>
	Lee's declaration scrapped language used in the past that  
described the sides more ambiguously as equal ``political 
entities,'' a move he said would help strengthen Taiwan's position 
ahead of talks with China touching on their political status. 
</P>
<P>
	China saw it as a move toward formal independence and renewed  
its threat to use force to block such a development. China, from 
which Taiwan split politically amid civil war in 1949, considers 
the island's leaders the illegitimate government of a breakaway 
province. 
</P>
<P>
	Overall though, party support for Lee's statement was ``very  
clear'' and a paragraph backing it appeared in the party's 
political mission statement to be adopted at the close of the 
congress, Nationalist Secretary General John Chang was quoted as 
saying Taiwan's mass market China Times. 
</P>
<P>
	But a separate draft resolution urging constitutional changes  
firming up Taiwan's sovereignty was eliminated to avoid 
``speculation by the outside world,'' Chang was quoted saying by 
the reports. 
</P>
<P>
	Government officials have said their basic policies toward China  
-- including eventual reunification with the mainland -- remain 
unchanged and have said they would not alter the island's laws or 
constitution to reflect Lee's statement.

<HEADLINE> Study Finds Exec's Pay Rises Faster </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The nation's economic boom is fattening the  
wallets of top corporate executives faster than ordinary workers' 
paychecks. 
</P>
<P>
	American factory workers have seen raises averaging 28 percent  
since 1990 -- just outpacing the 22.5 percent inflation rate. But 
compensation for the highest-level corporate executives has more 
than quadrupled, according to a report. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's a big fairness problem here. While the headlines are  
saying the economy is doing so wonderfully, the benefits of that 
are not being spread around equitably,'' said Sarah Anderson, one 
of the report's authors. 
</P>
<P>
	``A Decade of Executive Excess: The 1990s'' was a joint project  
of Washington's liberal Institute for Policy Studies and United for 
a Fair Economy, a grass-roots Boston-based organization dedicated 
to spotlighting economic inequality. 
</P>
<P>
	A critic of the report said it was flawed because it included  
stock options, whose value can fluctuate. But he acknowledged there 
are differences in compensation. 
</P>
<P>
	``Obviously there is a considerable distinction between the  
lowest and the highest paid, and my reaction to that is, `So what? 
It's a market-driven society,''' said Charles Peck, an executive 
compensation specialist at The Conference Board, a New York-based 
research and networking organization supported by the memberships 
of corporate executives. 
</P>
<P>
	The report compares Labor Department statistics tracking wages  
of nonsupervisory workers in the manufacturing industry during the 
1990s with trends in compensation for corporate executives as 
reported by Business Week magazine and other private sources. 
</P>
<P>
	Average worker pay rose from $22,952 a year in 1990 to $29,267  
in 1998, the report said. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, average compensation packages for the top two  
executives at the nation's 365 biggest public companies -- including 
manufacturing and other industries -- rose from $1.8 million in 1990 
to $10.6 million in 1998. That's the equivalent of a 481 percent 
raise. 
</P>
<P>
	The executive pay figures include salaries, bonuses and the  
value of stock options exercised by CEOs and their deputies. 
</P>
<P>
	Comparisons of annual compensation that include the exercise of  
stock options aren't entirely fair, Peck argued. 
</P>
<P>
	For one thing, he said, stock options can be worth a lot or a  
little, depending on when they're exercised. During the recent Wall 
Street boom, they've been worth a lot to many executives, but 
that's never a sure thing. 
</P>
<P>
	``If a CEO from company X happened to exercise a stock option in  
1998 and either through luck or acumen managed to get a great 
return, it's going to show up on that person's personal income, but 
it really has nothing to do with pay for performance for that 
year,'' he said. 
</P>

<HEADLINE> Jump in Prescription Sales Expected </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Americans are delving deeper than ever into  
their medicine chests, with nearly 3 billion prescriptions expected 
to be filled this year, according to a pharmacy trade group. 
</P>
<P>
	Consumers will buy an estimated 2.97 billion prescriptions this  
year, 9 percent more than the 2.73 billion they picked up last 
year, the National Association of Chain Drug Stores said in a 
report issued Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	Prescription sales could jump to 4 billion before 2005, said  
Robert W. Hanna, the group's interim president and chief executive. 
</P>
<P>
	Pharmacists, drug makers and consumer groups attribute the rise  
to an aging population, increased advertising and an expanding 
array of medicines that target ``lifestyle'' ailments such as 
insomnia. 
</P>
<P>
	Among new drugs sold this year are American Home Products'  
Sonata sleeping pill, a Glaxo Wellcome influenza fighter called 
Relenza, the Hoffman La Roche fat-blocker Xenical, and Plan B, a 
``morning-after'' anti-pregancy pill to be distributed by the 
Women's Capital Corp. 
</P>
<P>
	Community pharmacies account for 63 percent of prescription drug  
sales in dollar terms -- a projected $76.6 billion this year. 
Prescription drugs also are sold at nursing homes, hospitals, 
prisons and via mail order. 
</P>
<P>
	``We've been absolutely deluged,'' said Lowell McNichol, who  
mans the Safeway drug counter in Petaluma, Calif. ``We have drugs 
available now for things we couldn't treat five, 10, 15 years ago. 
So we use them.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Among the fastest-selling new drugs are so-called cox-2  
inhibitors, a new class of painkillers often referred to as 
``super-aspirins.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Antidepressants are among the top-selling drugs, with 17 percent  
more prescriptions this June than in June 1998, according to NDC 
Health Information Services, which tracks drug sales. Nearly one 
out of every three anti-depressants sold is Eli Lilly &AMP; Co.'s 
Prozac, one of the oldest drugs of its class. 
</P>
<P>
	The increase in prescriptions continues a long-term trend.  
Americans bought 2 billion prescriptions in 1992 and 2.6 billion in 
1997, an increase of about 30 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	But Americans spent 64 percent more on drugs in 1997 than in  
1993, according to IMS Health, a Plymouth Meeting, Pa.-based 
industry research company that helped formulate the 1999 estimates.

<HEADLINE> Lewinsky Moving to New York City </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Ex-White House intern Monica Lewinsky has rented  
an apartment in a Greenwich Village building where one-bedrooms 
fetch around $4,000 a month, according to news reports. 
</P>
<P>
	The New York Post and Daily News reported the move in their  
Sunday editions and ABCNEWS.com posted it Saturday night. 
</P>
<P>
	An owner of the building, K. Thomas Elghanayan, confirmed that  
Ms. Lewinsky signed a lease, the Post said. He did not immediately 
return calls to his home and office Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	The apartment near the Hudson River is in a 10-story renovated  
1899 brick building with a roof garden, arched windows and 
cathedral ceilings. Michael Chan, a real estate agent with Citi 
Habitats, said one-bedroom places in the building range from $3,800 
to $4,200. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Lewinsky, whose mother lived in midtown Manhattan, recently  
earned a $600,000 advance for her book, ``Monica's Story.''

<HEADLINE> Report: Brewers Interview Stewart </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MILWAUKEE (AP) -- The Milwaukee Brewers have interviewed Toronto  
assistant general manager Dave Stewart as part of a search to 
replace former general manager Sal Bando, according to the 
Milwaukee Journal Sentinel. 
</P>
<P>
	The paper, citing unidentified sources, also said that Wendy  
Selig-Prieb, the Brewers' president and chief executive officer, 
will interview former Cleveland Indians assistant general manager 
Dan O'Dowd on Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	Selig-Prieb has refused to comment on the search process for a  
new GM, the Journal Sentinel reported in Sunday's editions. 
</P>
<P>
	Manager Phil Garner was fired and Bando was reassigned Aug. 12,  
as the Brewers appeared headed to their seventh straight losing 
season. 
</P>
<P>
	Stewart, who was interviewed by Selig-Prieb on Thursday, said he  
was the first candidate interviewed. 
</P>
<P>
	``I answered questions, told her what I thought of their club,  
their minor league system and scouting,'' Stewart said. ``There is 
a lot to build on there as they move into their new park.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Brewers currently are building a new stadium, called Miller  
Park. 
</P>
<P>
	Stewart, 42, was a four-time 20-game winner during a 15-year  
major league career with five clubs. He played on three World 
Series championship teams. 
</P>
<P>
	After finishing his playing career with Oakland in 1995, he  
worked for a year as the A's assistant general manager before 
moving to San Diego. After one year as an assistant to general 
manager Kevin Towers, he moved into the dugout as the pitching 
coach and helped guide the Padres to the World Series. 
</P>
<P>
	He then moved to Toronto.  
</P>
<P>
	O'Dowd, 41, has spent 17 seasons in professional baseball, most  
recently in Cleveland, where he helped build the Indians farm 
system into one of the strongest in baseball. 
</P>
<P>
	Baseball sources said last week that the Brewers had compiled a  
list of 12 potential candidates, including Stewart, O'Dowd, former 
Dodgers general manager Fred Claire, New York Mets assistant GM 
Omar Minaya, Chicago White Sox director of baseball operations Dan 
Evans; and Cincinnati Reds assistant GM Darrell ``Doc'' Rodgers, 
the Journal Sentinel reported. 
</P>
<P>
	Former Yankees GM Bob Watson and Cleveland scout Ted Simmons  
also are believed to be on the list, the Journal Sentinel reported.

<HEADLINE> Indonesia Bank Bali Probe Too Slow </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SINGAPORE (AP) -- An investigation into a corruption scandal at  
Indonesia's Bank Bali is progressing too slowly and will be 
extended to the country's central bank, a senior World Bank 
official said Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	Indonesian authorities have given PriceWaterhouseCoopers the  
go-ahead to audit Bank Indonesia, the country's central bank, 
</P>
<P>
	``The government auditing body has given PriceWaterhouseCoopers  
the mandate to investigate'' Bank Indonesia, the country's central 
bank, said Jean-Michel Severino, the World Bank's vice president 
for East Asia and the Pacific. 
</P>
<P>
	Official investigations have so far been ``too slow -- that is  
why the pressure has increased,'' Severino said on the sidelines of 
a conference in Singapore. 
</P>
<P>
	The scandal broke last month after an audit found that Bank  
Bali's directors had used government bailout money to pay a $80 
million fee to a debt collection company controlled by the ruling 
Golkar Party's deputy treasurer. 
</P>
<P>
	Golkar opponents allege the money -- which has since been  
returned -- was intended to bankroll Indonesian President B.J. 
Habibie's campaign to remain in power when an electoral college 
selects the next head of state in November. 
</P>
<P>
	The disclosure of the affair caused an uproar, unnerving  
investors in the currency and equity markets for weeks. 
</P>
<P>
	The World Bank earlier threatened to halt funding for Indonesia  
if it doesn't swiftly and satisfactorily conclude an investigation. 
</P>
<P>
	Last week, the IMF called for an audit of the central bank to  
ascertain how the funds were lost. 
</P>
<P>
	Bank Indonesia's Deputy Gov. Miranda Goltom said that the  
government is fully aware of the concerns shown by the 
international agencies regarding the investigation and will do 
anything within the law to ensure the investigation is fair and 
transparent. 
</P>
<P>
	Habibie's government will make a statement on the progress of  
the investigation in Parliament Sept. 4, said Severino, who was in 
Singapore for a 14-nation ``Manila Framework'' conference of 
finance and central bank officials.

<HEADLINE> Strike at Detroit Schools Looms </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DETROIT (AP) -- Hoping to stave off a threatened strike by  
teachers, officials of Detroit Public Schools and the union backing 
its educators pressed contract talks Sunday just two days from the 
scheduled start of classes in the state's largest district. 
</P>
<P>
	Administrators of the 172,000-student district -- under new  
management -- and Detroit Federation of Teachers bargainers have 
negotiated throughout the weekend over a new contract. 
</P>
<P>
	The union' old agreement expires Monday, with the union  
threatening a possible strike. 
</P>
<P>
	Issues mentioned as discussion topics have included merit pay,  
extended work days, class sizes and a plan by the district's newly 
appointed interim chief executive to give principals permission to 
``redeploy resources'' by terminating teachers. 
</P>
<P>
	Bargainers for both sides were negotiating Sunday night and  
could not be reached for comment. 
</P>
<P>
	The contract would be the first under the district's new  
management -- a ``reform board'' appointed by Mayor Dennis Archer 
after the GOP-controlled state Legislature dumped the district's 
former school board. 
</P>
<P>
	That move -- pushed by Gov. John Engler and signed into law in  
March -- followed what critics had called decades of declining 
performance, mismanagement and pork-barrel politics in Detroit 
schools. 
</P>
<P>
	The reform board has endorsed recommendations by David Adamany,  
hired in May as the district's interim CEO. But some of the 
proposals -- including merit pay -- require approval by the teachers' 
union, which has endorsed some parts of the plan and is hostile 
toward others. 
</P>
<P>
	A state law passed in 1994 restricts strikes by public school  
workers. The law imposes fines equal to a day's pay on public 
school employees who strike, bars walkouts over unfair labor 
practices and removes a number of items from the list of things 
that can be bargained, such as the number of days in the school 
year.

<HEADLINE> Judge Blocks Ariz. Teen's Abortion </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PHOENIX (AP) -- The Arizona Supreme Court on Sunday opened the  
way for a 14-year-old foster girl to receive a late-term abortion. 
</P>
<P>
	The high court voted 3-2 to overturn a state appeals judge's  
ruling Saturday that blocked the girl from heading to Kansas to 
abort her 24-week-old fetus, said John MacDonald, the supreme 
court's spokesman. No Arizona clinics currently provide abortions 
after 20 weeks. 
</P>
<P>
	The court's chief justice and vice chief justice dissented, and  
would later explain their reasoning, MacDonald said. 
</P>
<P>
	The girl, a ward of the state since she was 5 and now a ward of  
Maricopa County Superior Court, told the state she was raped. She 
requested an abortion 14 weeks into the pregnancy but then ran 
away, showing up again only recently. 
</P>
<P>
	Appeals Court Judge Michael Ryan's ruling came after Gov. Jane  
Hull and state Attorney General Janet Napolitano argued the 
pregnancy may be too advanced to terminate, The Arizona Republic 
said Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	The newspaper, which confirmed the ruling through sources, said  
it was not clear why the judge decided to overturn an earlier 
decision allowing the abortion to go through. Rulings related to 
the case have been kept secret because the girl is a juvenile. 
</P>
<P>
	The case was brought before the appeals court after Maricopa  
County Superior Court Judge William Sargeant on Saturday reaffirmed 
an earlier decision to permit the abortion. 
</P>
<P>
	But the high court's majority on Sunday said Sargeant did not  
``abuse his discretion'' nor was his ruling ``clearly erroneous,'' 
said MacDonald, reading a copy of the court's order. 
</P>
<P>
	Officials said the girl should be required to see a doctor to  
determine whether her fetus can survive outside the womb. They also 
questioned her competency.

<HEADLINE> Montana Upset Over New License Plate </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HELENA, Mont. (AP) -- In a land of shining mountains, rolling  
prairies and a legendary big sky, a state committee trying to build 
a better license plate finds itself mired in a swamp. 
</P>
<P>
	Criticism has poured in -- verbally, in print, by letter and  
e-mail -- since officials decided to do away with Montana's current 
plate in favor of a simpler one that's easier for law officers to 
read. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's dull, dead, ugly,'' Mary O'Bryan, of Harlem, said of the  
new plate. 
</P>
<P>
	The proposed plate is tinted light blue with stylized white  
streaks that are meant to suggest clouds. Plate numbers are black, 
with the words ``Montana'' and ``Big Sky Country'' printed above in 
dark blue. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are not a pastel population, nor are we burdened with a  
passive geography,'' wrote Michael Dunlap of Great Falls. ``We are 
rich in color, vista and history. Let's see some of that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Wrote Robert and Linda Sleight of Bigfork: ``Montana is robust,  
stunningly beautiful and full of character and color. The new plate 
should be all of these and it is none.'' 
</P>
<P>
	And a recent editorial in the Great FallsTribune added to the  
furor: ``Considering how much money we Montanans have to pay for 
our plates, we deserve nothing less than a captivating, 
heart-stirring image that will make us proud, by God, to climb 
behind the wheel.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``We're taking a lot of heat,'' acknowledged Dean Roberts, head  
of the state Motor Vehicle Division. 
</P>
<P>
	The current plate, in use for more than a decade, features a  
jagged mountain ridge topped with bands of orange and yellow 
suggesting a sunset. 
</P>
<P>
	Committee members figured most residents would like the new  
design. They, along with the graphic artist behind the design, were 
stunned by the outpouring of criticism. 
</P>
<P>
	``What's going on here?'' artist Annette Finstad asked when she  
saw a crowd of reporters and TV cameras at a meeting last week. 
``Hasn't anyone had a car wreck or a house burn down in the state 
of Montana?'' 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, the panel faces an Oct. 1 deadline to begin producing  
the plates at a state prison factory. Larry Fasbender, the 
committee chairman, doubts the perfect plate will be found. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's no way everyone is going to be pleased with this,'' he  
said.

<HEADLINE> Study Finds Exec's Pay Rises Faster </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The nation's economic boom is fattening the  
wallets of top corporate executives faster than ordinary workers' 
paychecks. 
</P>
<P>
	American factory workers have seen raises averaging 28 percent  
since 1990 -- just outpacing the 22.5 percent inflation rate. But 
compensation for the highest-level corporate executives has more 
than quadrupled, according to a report. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's a big fairness problem here. While the headlines are  
saying the economy is doing so wonderfully, the benefits of that 
are not being spread around equitably,'' said Sarah Anderson, one 
of the report's authors. 
</P>
<P>
	``A Decade of Executive Excess: The 1990s'' was a joint project  
of Washington's liberal Institute for Policy Studies and United for 
a Fair Economy, a grass-roots Boston-based organization dedicated 
to spotlighting economic inequality. 
</P>
<P>
	A critic of the report said it was flawed because it included  
stock options, whose value can fluctuate. But he acknowledged there 
are differences in compensation. 
</P>
<P>
	``Obviously there is a considerable distinction between the  
lowest and the highest paid, and my reaction to that is, `So what? 
It's a market-driven society,''' said Charles Peck, an executive 
compensation specialist at The Conference Board, a New York-based 
research and networking organization supported by the memberships 
of corporate executives. 
</P>
<P>
	The report compares Labor Department statistics tracking wages  
of nonsupervisory workers in the manufacturing industry during the 
1990s with trends in compensation for corporate executives as 
reported by Business Week magazine and other private sources. 
</P>
<P>
	Average worker pay rose from $22,952 a year in 1990 to $29,267  
in 1998, the report said. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, average compensation packages for the top two  
executives at the nation's 365 biggest public companies -- including 
manufacturing and other industries -- rose from $1.8 million in 1990 
to $10.6 million in 1998. That's the equivalent of a 481 percent 
raise. 
</P>
<P>
	The executive pay figures include salaries, bonuses and the  
value of stock options exercised by CEOs and their deputies. 
</P>
<P>
	Comparisons of annual compensation that include the exercise of  
stock options aren't entirely fair, Peck argued. 
</P>
<P>
	For one thing, he said, stock options can be worth a lot or a  
little, depending on when they're exercised. During the recent Wall 
Street boom, they've been worth a lot to many executives, but 
that's never a sure thing. 
</P>
<P>
	``If a CEO from company X happened to exercise a stock option in  
1998 and either through luck or acumen managed to get a great 
return, it's going to show up on that person's personal income, but 
it really has nothing to do with pay for performance for that 
year,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	The Conference Board keeps its own statistics on executive  
compensation. By its latest count of salaries and cash bonuses 
only, executive pay in the manufacturing industry averaged $783,000 
in 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	Some say the disparities are damaging.  
</P>
<P>
	They may hurt morale and the spirit of teamwork at a company,  
said Chuck Collins, co-director of United for a Fair Economy. Also, 
CEOs holding huge stock options have a financial incentive to base 
management decisions disproportionately on what will please 
investors in the short term, he said, instead of what's best for 
the company, workers or communities in the long run. 
</P>
<P>
	``This canyon between the pay of top executives and ordinary  
workers for a lot of people symbolizes a sort of betrayal,'' 
Collins said.

auditors say. 
</P>
<P>
	State regulators reported a 91 percent increase between 1996 and  
1998 in complaints about the practice known as ``slamming,'' the 
switching of phone service without the customer's consent. They 
received 39,688 complaints in 1998. Federal authorities saw a 57 
percent rise, from 12,795 complaints in 1996 to 20,154 in 1998, 
according to the study by the General Accounting Office, the 
investigative arm of Congress. 
</P>
<P>
	At the same time, the report found that ``cramming,'' or  
slipping into phone bills unauthorized charges, typically from 
third parties, is drawing significant consumer attention. In 1996, 
state regulators fielded 800 complaints about the practice. That 
number leaped to 20,000 in 1998. 
</P>
<P>
	Two regulatory agencies -- the Federal Communications Commission  
and the Federal Trade Commission -- rank cramming among the most 
common types of complaints they receive. 
</P>
<P>
	Sen. Susan Collins, R-Maine, who chairs the Senate Governmental  
Affairs' subcommittee on permanent investigations, said the report 
confirms that both practices continue to be significant consumer 
problems. 
</P>
<P>
	``We need stronger consumer protection efforts by regulatory  
agencies, and the Congress must provide regulators with the tools 
they need to fight this growing problem,'' Collins said. She has 
introduced legislation that would create new civil penalties for 
cramming and require minimum fines for both practices against 
companies who violate the rules. 
</P>
<P>
	Last year, the FCC adopted new rules that give telephone  
customers broader remedies for slamming, including a 30-day period 
in which they can avoid paying long-distance charges to allow time 
to resolve the problem. 
</P>
<P>
	But the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia  
indefinitely halted enforcement of the rules at the request of 
long-distance companies, who want the FCC to consider an industry 
plan. 
</P>
<P>
	The industry coalition has been meeting with consumer groups to  
discuss its proposal and is preparing to resubmit it in September, 
according to Sprint spokesman James Fisher. 
</P>
<P>
	The FTC has proposed cramming rules, which would require a  
consumer's express consent before third-party charges -- those other 
than for local or long-distance service-- can be placed on a bill. 
It also would allow consumers to dispute unauthorized charges. 
</P>
<P>
	FCC rules adopted this spring also could help address cramming.  
They require phone companies to reorganize phone bills to flag new 
charges and service providers, give clear descriptions of all 
charges and information about how to contest them. 
</P>
<P>
	According to the GAO report, all states have implemented some  
protections against slamming, and most have set up some consumer 
remedies for cramming as well. 
</P>
<P>
	In the two years cited by the study, regulators in 35 states  
reported completing 219 formal enforcement actions for companies 
accused of slamming or cramming. Violators were ordered to pay at 
least $27 million in restitution and penalties.

<HEADLINE> Diamondbacks 5, Mets 3 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PHOENIX (AP) -- Jay Bell, whose error opened the way for two  
unearned runs in the sixth inning, went 3-for-4 with two RBIs as 
the Arizona Diamondbacks rallied to beat the New York Mets 5-3 
Saturday night. 
</P>
<P>
	Bell's two-out double into the left-field corner scored Tony  
Womack from first for the go-ahead run in the seventh. 
</P>
<P>
	It was the second time in four games that Bell had atoned for a  
costly error with the game-winning hit. Bell's two errors in one 
play against Florida allowed the tying two runs to score last 
Wednesday, then he hit the game-winning home run the next time 
Arizona came to bat. 
</P>
<P>
	Matt Williams hit his 31st home run on a 3-0 pitch off reliever  
Pat Mahomes in the eighth. 
</P>
<P>
	Ex-Met Armando Reynoso (10-2) allowed one earned run on six hits  
in six innings. He struck out three, walked two, had a balk and a 
wild pitch. 
</P>
<P>
	Matt Mantei pitched a perfect ninth for his 24rd save in 28  
tries. He is 14-for-16 in saves since being traded to Arizona from 
Florida. 
</P>
<P>
	Dennis Cook (10-4) took the loss in relief as the Mets fell 2 1/2  
games behind first-place Atlanta in the NL East. 
</P>
<P>
	Arizona has won 11 of its last 13 and stayed 8 1/2 games ahead of  
second-place San Francisco in the NL West. 
</P>
<P>
	With the score tied at 3 and Womack safe at first on a fielder's  
choice, Bell lined a shot past Rickey Henderson in left field. 
</P>
<P>
	New York took a 3-1 lead with the two unearned runs in the  
sixth. Second baseman Bell, playing on the outfield grass far 
deeper than he normally would, had to charge John Olerud's ground 
ball and booted it. 
</P>
<P>
	Olerud took second on Reynoso's wild pitch and scored on Robin  
Ventura's double down the right-field line. Roger Cedeno, who was 
2-for-3 with two RBIs, drove in Ventura with a two-out single. 
</P>
<P>
	The Diamondbacks scored twice with two outs in the sixth to tie  
it at 3. With one out, Bell and Gonzalez singled. Williams struck 
out, but Erubiel Durazo lined a single to center to drive in Bell. 
</P>
<P>
	Cook, a lefty, relieved starter Orel Hershiser to face the  
left-handed Steve Finley. Finley broke his bat on a soft grounder 
that bounded past the mound, leaving everyone safe as Gonzalez 
scored the tying run from third. 
</P>
<P>
	Each team scored its first run in the fourth. The Mets' Mike  
Piazza walked, moved to second on a balk and scored on Cedeno's 
two-out single. 
</P>
<P>
	Womack led off Arizona's fourth with a walk, went to second on  
his major league-leading 59th steal, and scored on Bell's single to 
center, Arizona's first hit off Hershiser. 
</P>
<P>
 *Notes:* Cedeno, who entered the game tied with Womack for the major  
league lead in stolen bases, was thrown out by catcher Damian 
Miller trying to steal second in the fourth inning. In the fourth, 
Arizona's Luis Gonzalez grounded to the first baseman Olerud for 
what looked to be a sure double play, but Olerud couldn't get the 
ball out of his glove because the string in the webbing came loose. 
... Gonzalez extended his hitting streak to 12 games, his fourth 
double-digit streak of the year. ... The crowd of 47,076 was 
Arizona's sixth sellout of the season. ... Arizona is 6-2 against 
the Mets this season.

<HEADLINE> Military Computers Vulnerable </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Auditors who investigated the Defense  
Department's information networks found security vulnerabilities in 
computer systems controlling critical operations that range from 
weapons design to soldiers' payrolls. 
</P>
<P>
	The General Accounting Office, following up on cyber security  
recommendations it has made since 1996, warned Friday that 
``weaknesses in DOD information security continue to provide both 
hackers and hundreds of thousands of authorized users the 
opportunity to modify, steal, inappropriately disclose and destroy 
sensitive DOD data.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The recommendation from the GAO -- Congress' investigative arm --  
that DOD put together a comprehensive, departmentwide information 
security program is not new; the report noted that the Pentagon has 
already made limited progress on some computer security fronts. 
</P>
<P>
	Pentagon spokeswoman Susan Hansen said the GAO's report was  
welcomed as a way of helping to raise awareness of the problem and 
that it was ``right in line with the types of things that we are 
ready to do.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Defense Department, perhaps the largest user of such  
information systems in the world, spends roughly $1 billion a year 
on computer system security, and has requested more money from 
Congress. 
</P>
<P>
	``To put the kinds of corrections in will require consistent  
efforts, and those cost,'' Hansen said. The office of Defense 
Secretary William Cohen and other DOD operations within the 
Pentagon itself recently set up additional firewalls and password 
protection for information systems, she noted. 
</P>
<P>
	The GAO said that while some corrective efforts have been  
undertaken in response to its earlier recommendations, progress has 
been ``inconsistent across the various DOD components,'' including 
controls over who can physically or electronically gain access to 
sensitive computer systems. 
</P>
<P>
	``Users were granted access to computer resources that exceeded  
what they required to carry out their job responsibilities,'' the 
report said. 
</P>
<P>
	Hansen said the Defense-wide Information Assurance Program, a  
security effort aimed at consolidating such control protection 
efforts across the DOD, is on schedule. 
</P>
<P>
	The GAO report said it was too early to assess the success of  
this program, and recommended that the program define how it will 
work with other security initiatives already in place.

<HEADLINE> Rams' QB Trent Green Injured </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ST. LOUIS (AP) -- St. Louis Rams quarterback Trent Green tore a  
left knee ligament near the end of the first half of Saturday 
night's exhibition against the San Diego Chargers. 
</P>
<P>
	Green, who completed all 11 passes for 166 yards and a 52-yard  
touchdown pass to Isaac Bruce, suffered a torn medial collateral 
ligament and also sustained possible damage to the anterior 
cruciate ligament. An MRI was scheduled later Saturday night at 
Barnes Hospital. 
</P>
<P>
	Green was injured on a late hit by safety Rodney Harrison after  
completing his 11th pass, making him 28 of 32 for 406 yards in the 
preseason. He was carted off the field holding the knee with 1:31 
to go in the half. 
</P>
<P>
	It was the second dangerous hit of the night by Harrison, who  
took a personal-foul penalty for a hit on wide receiver Isaac Bruce 
in the first quarter. Harrison played at Western Illinois in 
Macomb, Ill., where the Rams hold training camp. 
</P>
<P>
	Green, 29, signed a four-year, $16.5 million free-agent deal  
with the Rams after a breakthrough season with the Washington 
Redskins in his first year as a starter. He threw for 23 touchdowns 
and 3,441 yards in 14 starts, and led Washington to a 6-3 finish. 
</P>
<P>
	The Rams' backup quarterback is Kurt Warner, who has played in  
one game as a reserve in his career. The third-stringer is rookie 
Joe Germaine of Ohio State.

<HEADLINE> Forced Labor Common in Amazon </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	GUARAI, Brazil (AP) -- These days, Lazo Martins dos Santos and  
his son know better than to accept offers of easy money clearing 
Amazon rain forest. They did last year, and had to be rescued by 
federal agents. 
</P>
<P>
	Not all their companions were so lucky.  
</P>
<P>
	``Six men tried to escape and only three were ever seen again,''  
says Santos' 17-year-old son, Jose. ``If it wasn't for the federals 
we'd probably still be there.'' 
</P>
<P>
	More than a century after slavery was abolished in Brazil,  
forced labor remains widespread, especially in the sparsely settled 
Amazon. 
</P>
<P>
	In dirt-poor towns like Guarai (pronounced gwar-aah-EE) in  
Tocantins state, 1,000 miles northwest of Rio de Janeiro, men like 
Ze Maria earn their living recruiting workers for big ranchers and 
plantation owners. Brazilians call such a gang boss a ``gato,'' 
Portuguese for cat. 
</P>
<P>
	Santos, Jose and 18 other men accepted job offers from Ze Maria  
back in January 1998. He gave each an advance of 30 reals ($18) -- 
to tide their wives over while they were away -- then they climbed 
into a cattle truck for the ride to the Estrela de Maceio ranch 200 
miles away in the neighboring state of Para. 
</P>
<P>
	Once out in the jungle, where roads are few and some ranches are  
the size of small nations, promises of good conditions disappeared. 
The men lived in a lean-to, drank muddy water and had to buy on 
credit everything from food to the tarpaulin they slept under. 
</P>
<P>
	When Santos asked for his pay at the end of the month, he was  
told that his advance plus the things he had purchased cost more 
than he had earned cutting trees. And, Ze Maria added, no one was 
leaving without paying off his debts. He faced down complainers at 
gunpoint. 
</P>
<P>
	``In the city he's a Christian; out there he's got a gun up your  
rear end,'' Santos says. 
</P>
<P>
	Six workers fled anyway -- two came back, and only one of the  
other four was seen again. After spending nights in the jungle and 
slipping past three armed checkpoints, he reached federal 
authorities, who sent officers to free the rest. 
</P>
<P>
	Since 1995, when President Fernando Henrique Cardoso created the  
Special Mobile Enforcement Group to combat labor abuses, 790 
workers have been rescued from slavery-like conditions. But human 
rights defenders say the government has barely scratched the 
surface. 
</P>
<P>
	``For us to even learn of a slave labor situation a worker has  
to escape,'' says the Rev. Henri Burin des Roziers, a French lawyer 
and priest with the Catholic Church's Pastoral Land Commission. 
``This can mean walking 125 miles through the jungle with armed men 
on your back.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Debt servitude goes back to 1888, when Brazil became the last  
nation in the Western Hemisphere to outlaw slavery. Sugar and 
coffee plantation owners began bringing in European immigrants -- 
many of whom spent the rest of their lives paying off the cost of 
the trans-Atlantic voyage. 
</P>
<P>
	In the late 1960s, the practice resurfaced in the Amazon.  
Ranchers lured destitute manual laborers from Brazil's 
drought-ridden northeast to cut down the jungle under a 
government-sponsored drive to develop the region. 
</P>
<P>
	The Pastoral Land Commission estimates 100,000 people a year  
were used as ``slave labor'' from the late 1960s until the 
mid-1980s, when pressure from environmentalists put an end to 
government financial incentives for cutting down jungle. 
</P>
<P>
	Although it is generally believed forced labor declined  
dramatically with the end of the incentives, activists say an 
upswing in logging has revived the practice. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think there is less slavery than there once was, but there's  
still so, so, so much. It's part of the culture,'' says Neide 
Cardoso Oliveira, the first federal prosecutor to win conviction of 
a rancher on slavery charges. 
</P>
<P>
	During her 18 months in Para, Oliveira managed two more  
convictions for slavery, which Brazilian law defines as any 
situation in which a worker is not paid and is physically impeded 
from leaving. 
</P>
<P>
	Although slavery is punishable by two to eight years in prison,  
no rancher has spent a single day in jail. Instead, their sentences 
were reduced to fines on appeal. 
</P>
<P>
	Worker advocates liken the punishment to a slap on the wrist and  
say it mocks the efforts of the Special Mobile Enforcement Group. 
</P>
<P>
	``If you talk to the landowners, they don't think there's  
anything wrong with what they're doing,'' says Claudia Ribeiro, one 
of the agency's four regional coordinators. ``The sad thing is most 
of the workers don't either.'' 
</P>
<P>
	That was the case with Manoel Luis Martins Moreira, who was  
freed from the Pantera ranch along with 12 others by Ribeiro's unit 
on May 7. 
</P>
<P>
	``When I got there, some of the men took one look at the  
situation and left, but I felt that wasn't right,'' Moreira says. 
``After all, they fed us and gave us the advance.'' 
</P>
<P>
	However, when he decided nine days later that he wanted to  
leave, the gato threatened Moreira's life and forced him to stay. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's just how things are done around here,'' shrugs Diva  
Barbosa, who runs the Pantera ranch with her husband, Nivaldo. 
</P>
<P>
	Barbosa says laws requiring housing with running water and  
electricity for the workers just aren't practical on a ranch the 
size of hers. To comply, they would have to build several barracks 
around the property, or else just one barracks from which the 
workers would spend most of the day just getting to work. Neither 
approach is workable, she contends. 
</P>
<P>
	Besides, she says, the workers don't appreciate what they get  
now. 
</P>
<P>
	``We give them an advance. We pay to bring them here and we give  
them lunch, and in the middle of the night they leave.''

<HEADLINE> Microworkz President To Quit </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SEATTLE (AP) -- The chief executive and president of  
Microworkz.com, the low-priced computer maker overwhelmed by 
orders, is vacating those posts to make way for ``more seasoned 
leadership.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Rick Latman, who led the company into the national spotlight  
with the recent launch of its Webzter line of PCs, said Thursday 
he'll step down by Nov. 15 to become chairman of the privately held 
company's board of directors. 
</P>
<P>
	No replacement has been named.  
</P>
<P>
	The publicity generated by the Webzter line, priced between $299  
and $699, quickly swamped the fledgling company, which was deluged 
with more orders than it could handle. 
</P>
<P>
	Complaints from customers angered by late orders and other  
issues began flooding into the Washington Attorney General's Office 
and the Better Business Bureau serving Oregon and Western 
Washington. 
</P>
<P>
	The volume of complaints ``definitely hasn't slowed down from a  
couple of months ago,'' said bureau spokeswoman Angela Gamba. 
</P>
<P>
	``We've been working closely with this company to help them, and  
I think they're trying to make a good-faith effort, but we'd like 
to see the complaints decrease,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	Latman admitted he blew it with the Webzter launch but asserted  
in June that ``every single consumer complaint has been 
addressed.'' 
</P>
<P>
	With enough work space and computer assemblers to produce  
200,000 machines a month, the company appears better-equipped to 
deal with the launch of its latest bargain-basement PC, the 
iToaster, which began shipping this week. 
</P>
<P>
	At $199.95, the Pentium machine comes with keyboard, mouse,  
monitor and free Internet access. 
</P>
<P>
	The company, based in Lynnwood, Wash., plans to go public before  
year's end.

	There would be no more games for NL umpire Bill Hohn after this  
Wednesday at Dodger Stadium. The league had sent him a final plane 
ticket, from Los Angeles back to Philadelphia. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was a way of them telling me it's over,'' he said from his  
home in Blue Bell, Pa., 
</P>
<P>
	On Thursday, the 22 umpires whose resignations were accepted by  
major league baseball are to lose their jobs. That's an off-day for 
Hohn's crew -- Terry Tata and Tom Hallion also are affected -- 
meaning a three-game series between the Dodgers and Milwaukee might 
be their final one. 
</P>
<P>
	``We just don't know what's going to happen,'' Hohn said.  
``Nobody in baseball has talked to me since the decision was made, 
giving me any explanation or reason.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Hohn, 44, joined the NL staff in 1989. An off-season players'  
survey ranked him 13th among the 36 NL umpires in overall capacity 
and seventh in physical condition, and placed him 19th in general. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is what I have trained over half my life to be, a good  
umpire,'' he said. ``This is what I wanted to do for another 12 or 
13 years. I want to stay in baseball.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Hohn reached the majors after a long trek through the Gulf  
Coast, Florida State, Southern and Pacific Coast leagues. Plus 
there was a stop in the Puerto Rico winter league, where he 
recalled ducking chicken bones thrown by irate fans. 
</P>
<P>
	An umpire of his experience makes about $145,000, including  
postseason bonuses. But it was not always that way -- when he 
started out in the 1970s, he made $600 a month during the baseball 
season, and had to pay his own food and hotel costs. 
</P>
<P>
	``It came out to about $7 a day for meals, and there were no  
guarantees that you'd ever make it to the majors,'' he said. ``But 
that's what all umpires go through. You have to really want it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	That all changed last month when, like most of his colleagues,  
he followed the plan of umpires' union chief Richie Phillips to 
submit mass resignations. 
</P>
<P>
	``Not one person at that meeting on July 14 thought it would  
come to this,'' he said. ``We wanted to show that we were serious 
about getting a new contract. That's what the average umpire was 
being told and understood.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``I never, ever dreamed this would happen,'' he said.  
</P>
<P>
	Once several umps started rescinding their resignations,  
however, the strategy broke down. 
</P>
<P>
	``I felt totally betrayed by the umpires who defected, for what  
they did to me and my family,'' Hohn said. 
</P>
<P>
	Hohn's wife, Grace, admitted there were concerns.  
</P>
<P>
	``I was worried at the time,'' she said. ``There were too many  
politics involved for it to go smoothly. 
</P>
<P>
	``Bill just thought if he was a good employee he'd be fine. But  
it doesn't work that way.'' 
</P>
<P>
	This week, umpires hope to get a reprieve from the National  
Labor Relations Board. Also, the courts will be tested. And 
privately, baseball officials say some of the 22 umpires will 
probably work again. 
</P>
<P>
	For now, though, the Hohns' future is uncertain.  
</P>
<P>
	Grace spends her nights on the computer, checking job listings.  
She once was employed in accounting at a computer company and, 
halfway to her M.B.A., is looking to return to the work force. 
</P>
<P>
	Hohn, who would have been calling games in Montreal this  
weekend, will wait to see how the next month or so plays out. He's 
not unwilling to start another career, if necessary -- he just knows 
that, at his age, it would not be easy. 
</P>
<P>
	``I didn't go to college. My college education is minor league  
ball,'' he said. ``It's not like I can go from one corporation to 
the next.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Hohns' immediate concern is for their family. Son Elek, 2,  
is too young to understand the situation. But 13-year-old Meredith 
is caught in the middle. 
</P>
<P>
	A few days ago, Meredith asked Hohn whether the family would  
have to give up its house. And next week, she starts 7th grade. 
</P>
<P>
	``She can't wait to see her friends, but she's worried about  
what some of the boys are going to say,'' he said. ``She wants to 
know what she's supposed to say when the first kid tells her, `Your 
dad got fired.'''

<HEADLINE> Bomb Kills Three in India </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW DELHI, India (AP) -- A bomb exploded in the house of a  
government minister in southern India, killing three of the 
minister's campaign coordinators, according to a news report today. 
</P>
<P>
	With federal elections a week away, Kodela Sivaprasad Rao was  
away on a campaign trip Saturday when the explosion ripped through 
his house in the southern Andhra Pradesh state, United News of 
India quoted police as saying. The three men were members of his 
campaign team. 
</P>
<P>
	A fourth man was wounded in the explosion in Narasaraopet, 870  
miles south of India's capital New Delhi, police said. Officials 
did not say who was suspected. 
</P>
<P>
	Andhra Pradesh is the hub of Maoist guerrilla outfits fighting  
landowners and police. 
</P>
<P>
	Rao is the Minister for Village Councils in the government of  
Chandrababu Naidu, the state's top elected official. Naidu's ruling 
Telugu Desam party is fighting the main opposition Congress party 
in the provincial elections in an alliance with Prime Minister Atal 
Bihari Vajpayee's Bharatiya Janata Party. 
</P>
<P>
	Election campaigns in several Indian states are often marred by  
violence between members of rival political groups. Ballot rigging 
is often reported from rural areas.

<HEADLINE> Indiana Newspaper Suspends TV Writer </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	INDIANAPOLIS (AP) -- The Indianapolis Star and News has suspended  
and reassigned its television writer for plagiarizing a story 
written by a writer at another newspaper. 
</P>
<P>
	Steve Hall admitted he made a ``stupid mistake'' and received a  
three-week, unpaid suspension. When he returns, he will be assigned 
to reporting duties that do not involve opinion writing, according 
to a statement by Executive Editor Frank Caperton. 
</P>
<P>
	``He also has been warned that if any further lapses in honesty  
come to light he will be dismissed,'' Caperton said in the 
statement, which was printed on the front page of today's editions 
and posted on the newspaper's Web site Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	Hall's story was not published but ``he submitted it for  
publication with every intention of having it appear in the 
paper,'' Caperton said today. He said there were no indications 
that this had happened in the past. 
</P>
<P>
	A telephone call by The Associated Press to Hall was not  
returned Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	In the statement, Hall, who has been a television writer at the  
newspaper for 13 years, apologized. 
</P>
<P>
	``Because of time pressures, I made a stupid mistake and  
violated a sacred law of our profession,'' he said. ``I apologize 
to our readers and my family, co-workers and friends.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The plagiarism was discovered when an editor at the newspaper  
noticed a story submitted by Hall was similar to one written by a 
television writer at another newspaper. 
</P>
<P>
	No details were given about Hall's story, and the other  
newspaper and writer were not identified. 
</P>
<P>
	The newsroom staffs of the Star and News merged in 1995 and the  
News is due to close Oct. 1.

<HEADLINE> Strike at Detroit Schools Looms </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DETROIT (AP) -- Hoping to stave off a threatened strike by  
teachers, officials of Detroit Public Schools and the union backing 
its educators pressed contract talks Sunday just two days from the 
scheduled start of classes in the state's largest district. 
</P>
<P>
	Administrators of the 172,000-student district -- under new  
management -- and Detroit Federal of Teachers bargainers have 
negotiated throughout the weekend over a new contract. 
</P>
<P>
	The union' old agreement expires Monday, with the union  
threatening a possible strike. 
</P>
<P>
	Issues mentioned as discussion topics have included merit pay,  
extended work days, class sizes and a plan by the district's newly 
appointed interim chief executive to give principals permission to 
``redeploy resources'' by terminating teachers. 
</P>
<P>
	Bargainers for both sides were negotiating Sunday night and  
could not be reached for comment. 
</P>
<P>
	The contract would be the first under the district's new  
management -- a ``reform board'' appointed by Mayor Dennis Archer 
after the GOP-controlled state Legislature dumped the district's 
former school board. 
</P>
<P>
	That move -- pushed by Gov. John Engler and signed into law in  
March -- followed what critics had called decades of declining 
performance, mismanagement and pork-barrel politics in Detroit 
schools. 
</P>
<P>
	The reform board has endorsed recommendations by David Adamany,  
hired in May as the district's interim CEO. But some of the 
proposals -- including merit pay -- require approval by the teachers' 
union, which has endorsed some parts of the plan and is hostile 
toward others. 
</P>
<P>
	A state law passed in 1994 restricts strikes by public school  
workers. The law imposes fines equal to a day's pay on public 
school employees who strike, bars walkouts over unfair labor 
practices and removes a number of items from the list of things 
that can be bargained, such as the number of days in the school 
year.

<HEADLINE> Colorado Indy 200 Notebook </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	FOUNTAIN, Colo. (AP) -- Colorado drivers continued to be shut out  
on their home track, and Vail native Buddy Lazier is convinced he 
let one get away Sunday in the Colorado Indy 200. 
</P>
<P>
	Lazier, who finished fourth, consistently ran among the leaders  
and turned in the fastest lap of the day of 172.084 mph on lap 198. 
</P>
<P>
	He will remain haunted, however, by a miscalculation on fuel  
consumption earlier in the race. 
</P>
<P>
	Lazier reduced Greg Ray's lead to three seconds on the 160th lap  
but almost immediately ran out of fuel, having to coast into the 
pits. 
</P>
<P>
	``I was dead stick coming into the pits,'' Lazier said. ``We ran  
out of fuel. There was air in the line. We threw away what we 
worked all day for. 
</P>
<P>
	``We kept making the car better and better. We've been strong  
all year. We just keep falling a little short.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Lazier's fourth place was the best finish by a Colorado driver  
in four races at Pikes Peak International Raceway. Lazier was fifth 
in a race here two months ago, and Buzz Calkins of Denver was fifth 
in 1997. 
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	 *OUTPOINTED:* Scott Goodyear entered the weekend leading the IRL  
point standings. He left PPIR trailing race winner Greg Ray by 44 
points (246-202). 
</P>
<P>
	Goodyear spent 15 laps in the pits with mechanical problems,  
including a faulty water line plug. He finished 21st in a 24-car 
field. 
</P>
<P>
	``My crew did a great job of keeping me out there,'' Goodyear  
said. ``I was just trying to make up time and stay out of the way 
so I wouldn't affect the outcome of the race. 
</P>
<P>
	``After we got the fitting replaced, I had a car I could take  
all over the track. We had a good race car by the end of the day.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Asked about the championship, Goodyear said, ``I'm disappointed,  
but at this point we've got to take it race by race. Keep in there 
and aim for the win.'' 
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	 *SCHMIDT SLOWED:* After tying Greg Ray for the fastest  
qualifying time, Sam Schmidt was confident in Sunday's race. 
</P>
<P>
	He led 38 laps early in the race but was crippled by handling  
problems after that, finishing fifth. 
</P>
<P>
	``It really was the best we had,'' Schmidt said. ``Our car got  
really loose in the corners. I had to slow the pace down a little 
too much. It killed us. Our team did awesome with the fuel 
mileage.'' 
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	 *DOUBLE DUTY:* Rookie Ronnie Johncox pulled a rare double  
Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	He drove in a USAC midget race in the morning, placing 24th.  
Then he hopped into his IRL car for the afternoon 200-miler. 
</P>
<P>
	His afternoon drive didn't last long, however. Johncox,  
apparently overreacting to a spin ahead of him by Jeff Ward on the 
first lap, hit the wall. 
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	 *MIDDLE-AGED ROOKIE:* Bobby Regester made his IRL debut Sunday,  
finishing 18th in a 24-car field. 
</P>
<P>
	``We never could get the push out of the car,'' he said. ``But  
it was fun and a really great opportunity.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Asked about his future with Truscelli Racing, Regester said,  
``It's a one-race deal. We're going to look at it. We've got to 
find some funding.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Regester, of Florissant, Colo., started 23rd after qualifying at  
166.860 mph on Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
	Regester, a three-time Pikes Peak International Hill Climb  
champion, passed his IRL rookie test in Atlanta last month. At 45, 
Regester is the second-oldest rookie to make his IRL debut. Jack 
Hewitt was 46 when he raced in the 1998 Indianapolis 500. 
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	 *PIT STOPS:* Rookie Jaques Lazier has signed a two-year contract  
extension with Truscelli Team Racing, team owner Joe Truscelli said 
Sunday. ... Ray became the third driver in IRL history to win 
consecutive races. Arie Luyendyk did it in 1997, and Kenny Brack 
won three straight last season. ... With two races left on the 
schedule, 13 drivers remain mathematically in contention for the 
season championship, worth a $1 million bonus. ... Ray earned the 
maximum 55 points for the second time this year. He received three 
points for winning the pole, two for leading the most laps and 50 
for the victory. He had the same total here two months ago. ... 
Hamilton has finished in the top five in all four IRL events at 
Pikes Peak. ... It was the quickest race in IRL history, taking 1 
hour, 28 minutes, 35 seconds to complete 200 laps. The previous 
record was 1:29:28, set here in June. ... Twenty-one cars were 
running at the finish, a league record. ... A Team Menard driver 
has led 469 of the 800 laps in the four IRL races here. Tony 
Stewart led a total of 214 in 1997 and 1998, while Ray led 255 in 
the two races this season.

<HEADLINE> Gymnasts Need Work Before 2000 Oly. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SACRAMENTO, Calif. (AP) -- Jason Gatson is heading to the  
surgeon. Vanessa Atler may need more visits to a sports 
psychologist. 
</P>
<P>
	Two of the top U.S. hopes for gymnastics medals at the Sydney  
Olympics have a lot of work to do before the 2000 Games. 
</P>
<P>
	Both teen-agers fell short of their goal -- a national title -- at  
the U.S. Gymnastics Championships that ended Saturday. Gatson was 
thwarted by injury, while Atler was undone once again by a fall on 
the uneven bars. 
</P>
<P>
	Gatson, 18, one of the nation's top male gymnasts, tore a  
ligament in his right knee Friday night while leading the 
all-around competition. He flew back to the U.S. Olympic Training 
Center in Colorado Springs, Colo., on Saturday and is expected to 
have surgery in the next few weeks. 
</P>
<P>
	Gatson, whose knee buckled as he dismounted from the horizontal  
bar, vowed to return in time to compete in the Sydney Olympics. In 
recovering from the surgery, he will try to emulate John 
Roethlisberger -- who placed second in the all-around competition 
this past week, less than a year after reconstructive knee surgery. 
</P>
<P>
	Roethlisberger, 29, a four-time national all-around champion in  
the early 1990s, was second to Blaine Wilson -- who became the first 
man to win four consecutive U.S. Gymnastics Championships 
all-around titles. 
</P>
<P>
	Atler's problem may be more mental than physical. The last three  
years, she has fallen on the uneven bars. In 1997, that dropped her 
into a tie for the national all-around title. The past two years, 
it has allowed Kristen Maloney to edge her for the championship. 
</P>
<P>
	Atler, 17, has more spunk and more of a public following than  
Maloney, elements that could help her win a medal at the 2000 
Olympics. But she first must contend with her problems on the 
uneven bars. 
</P>
<P>
	She already has seen a sports psychologist to deal with the  
problem. 
</P>
<P>
	``Sometimes they tell me to say words on my bar routine, or just  
to breathe and relax before I start,'' said Atler, who won gold in 
the vault and balance beam events as the championships closed 
Saturday night. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are trying to teach her that there are two kinds of ready:  
physically ready and mentally ready,'' said coach Beth Rybacki, a 
1980 Olympic gymnast who didn't get to compete then because of the 
U.S.-led boycott of the Moscow Games. ``The gymnastics are in her 
body, she just doesn't have the numbers yet.'' 
</P>
<P>
	While Gatson will be healing, Atler now moves on to the World  
Championships team trials to be held Sept. 15-18 in Kansas City. 
That event will help choose the U.S. squad for the World Gymnastics 
Championships Oct. 8-16 in Tianjin, China. 
</P>
<P>
	Then Atler hopes to compete in the World Championships for the  
first time. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're trying to peak for worlds,'' Rybacki said. ``Vanessa was  
not at all prepared for this, but she still made her two best 
scores on vault and floor this week. We're pleased with that. There 
is too much pounding and intensity to extend all the way to 
October. You have to build toward it or you'll burn out.''

<HEADLINE> Ahern Beats Irwin in Playoff to Win  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	STE-JULIE, Quebec (AP) -- Jim Ahern, playing in only his seventh  
Senior PGA Tour event, parred the second playoff hole Sunday to 
beat Hale Irwin and win the $1.35 million Canadian Senior Open. 
</P>
<P>
	It was the second week in a row, Irwin, a five-time champion  
this year, lost in a playoff to a first-time senior winner. Tom 
McGinnis beat Irwin last week at the BankBoston Classic. 
</P>
<P>
	The 50-year-old Ahern, a qualifier whose previous best finish  
was an 18th, won the $202,500 top prize as well as a one-year 
exemption from qualifying on the senior tour. 
</P>
<P>
	He birdied the last two holes in regulation, including a  
15-footer from the fringe on the 72nd hole to force the playoff as 
he and Irwin finished at 16-under 272 at Richelieu Valley Golf 
Club. 
</P>
<P>
	Ahern had a final-round 68 Sunday, while Irwin, the third-round  
leader, had a 69. 
</P>
<P>
	Irwin saved par after driving into the trees on the left on the  
first playoff hole. He was in the trees on the right on the second 
and then hit into a bunker. 
</P>
<P>
	Ahern missed a 15-foot birdie putt on the second hole, but Irwin  
missed a 6-footer for par. Ahern broke into tears after making his 
5-foot par putt for the victory. 
</P>
<P>
	Ed Dougherty closed with a 67 to finish third at 273. Tom  
Jenkins shot a 67 and was fourth at 275, while David Lundstrom had 
a 69 and was at 277. 
</P>
<P>
	Irwin, 54, the senior tour's player of the year the last two  
seasons, has 26 wins in five years on the over-50 circuit after 
winning 20 times, including three U.S. Opens, in his days on the 
PGA Tour.

<HEADLINE> Bank Fires Seven for E-Mail Misuse </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHARLOTTE (AP) -- First Union Corp. says it has fired seven  
employees within the last week for sending pornographic and other 
inappropriate e-mail. 
</P>
<P>
	First Union, the nation's sixth-largest bank, confirmed the  
firings Friday, but company spokeswoman Sandy Deem would not 
release more details. 
</P>
<P>
	The bank ``will not tolerate conduct that interferes with  
another person's work performance or creates an intimidating, 
offensive or hostile environment,'' Deem said. 
</P>
<P>
	The Charlotte Observer reported Friday that employees at the  
University Research Park office circulated e-mail that included 
videos of people having sex and other material of a sexual nature. 
The company stumbled on the e-mail when the volume of messages 
became so heavy it slowed down a server. 
</P>
<P>
	One employee fired within the past week from the bank's  
home-equity division was called into an office, shown a stack of 
e-mail and fired on the spot, an employee told the newspaper. 
</P>
<P>
	First Union, a Fortune 100 corporation, joins a number of  
companies taking swift and severe action for violations of company 
e-mail policy. 
</P>
<P>
	Companies are seeking to protect themselves from legal claims  
that their work environment is hostile. An increasing number of 
lawsuits alleging sexual harassment have based claims in part on 
e-mails taken from company computer systems.

<HEADLINE> Report: JAL To Team Up With Rival </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TOKYO (AP) -- Japan Airlines Co., the nation's premier carrier,  
reportedly has mapped out a plan to jointly run international 
flights with a rival airline. 
</P>
<P>
	The alliance between JAL and Japan Air System Co., scheduled to  
start in October, marks the first time the two have teamed up in 
international operations, the national Yomiuri newspaper said, 
quoting unidentified airline officials. 
</P>
<P>
	Officials from the two airlines were unavailable Sunday to  
confirm the reports. 
</P>
<P>
	Rising competition from budget carriers in recent years has  
reduced profits at Japan's big airlines, sending them scrambling to 
cut costs and come up with low-priced deals to attract passengers. 
</P>
<P>
	In the JAL-JAS tie-up, JAL will provide aircraft and JAS will  
allocate three of its arrival and departure slots at Tokyo's Narita 
airport for the joint flights, the report said. 
</P>
<P>
	The flights will be bound for either the United States or South  
Korea, with the destination to be decided later, it said. 
</P>
<P>
	The carriers will promote the new service under their own names  
and use their own flight numbers, but passengers from the two 
services will in fact fly on the same aircraft, the report said.

<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Anyone who wants to pinpoint where James Bond  
met that blonde with the bottle of champagne on her curvy hip need 
only consult ``Language of the Land,'' an unusual book published by 
the Library of Congress offering maps of imaginary places. 
</P>
<P>
	Another map shows just where Tom Sawyer whitewashed his famous  
fence. Still another points out the spot at which Paul Bunyan's ox 
Babe, trying to catch a field mouse, dug the Mammoth Cave. 
</P>
<P>
	L. Frank Baum's ``Wonderful World of Oz'' is charted.  
Illustrator Dick Martin located the Shifting Sands and Deadly 
Desert, with Emerald City and Gunda's Palace smack in the middle. 
</P>
<P>
	A Yellow Brick Road is there too, though it's not clearly  
labeled. 
</P>
<P>
	``Literary maps depict ideas as much as places,'' wrote  
co-author Martha Hopkins in the book's introduction. 
</P>
<P>
	Most literary maps, Hopkins notes, are not drawn to scale and  
contain little detailed information on topography, geology, towns, 
rivers or roads. They ``present a world in which authors and books 
are the dominant features,'' she explains. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, some of the places are real enough. Author Ian Fleming  
made his James Bond stories credible by searching out authentic 
settings for what the library calls his ``assignments and 
assignations.'' Only ``Agent 007'' himself and his exploits sprang 
from Fleming's imagination. 
</P>
<P>
	J.R.R. Tolkien's completely imaginary ``Middle Earth'' rates  
three highly detailed maps. 
</P>
<P>
	Somewhere between reality and imagination lies Mark Twain's St.  
Petersburg, the home of Tom Sawyer, modeled on Hannibal, Mo. That's 
where the young Sam Clemens lived before he went piloting on the 
Mississippi, where he got his pen-name. 
</P>
<P>
	The half-whitewashed fence is on St. Petersburg's Hill Street,  
just across from Becky Thatcher's house. 
</P>
<P>
	``There ain't anything that is so interesting to look at as a  
place that a book has talked about,'' Twain quotes Tom as saying in 
later life. 
</P>
<P>
	``Language of the Land'' describes and reproduces the fantastic  
maps, along with many others covering the literary landscape. It 
was compiled by Hopkins of the library's Interpretive Programs 
Office and Michael Buscher of the Geography and Map Division. 
</P>
<P>
	The maps mostly cover English-speaking countries -- Canada and  
Australia have maps that illustrate their best-known books. Even 
one for Paris gives a large space to Oscar Wilde and American 
writer Gertrude Stein, whom the French do not see as important to 
their literature. There's also a bright map, shaped and colored 
like a parrot -- written in English -- devoted to Latin American 
writers. 
</P>
<P>
	Maps from days when Latin and Greek got more intensive study  
show the voyages of Odysseus and Aeneas. Even troubled Balkan 
politics gets touched on -- unintentionally. A map on places in 
Hungarian literature includes portions of Romania which once 
belonged to Hungary, and which many Hungarians would dearly like to 
get back. 
</P>
<P>
	------	 
</P>
<P>
	``Language of the Land: The Library of Congress Book of Literary  
Maps'' is available for $50 by mail from the Superintendent of 
Documents, P.O. Box 371954, Pittsburgh, Pa. 15250-7954. The stock

<HEADLINE> Coulthard Wins Belgian GP </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SPA-FRANCORCHAMPS, Belgium (AP) -- Defending world champion Mika  
Hakkinen moved back in the lead of the Formula One standings just 
in time for the return of Michael Schumacher. 
</P>
<P>
	Although Hakkinen's McLaren-Mercedes teammate David Coulthard  
won the Belgian Grand Prix on Sunday, Hakkinen's second-place 
finish was good enough to give him a one-point edge over Eddie 
Irvine in a Ferrari, who came in fourth. 
</P>
<P>
	Hakkinen now has 60 points with Irvine at 59 and Coulthard at 46  
with four races left. Schumacher has 32 points but is expected to 
make his come back from a broken leg at the next race, the Italian 
Grand Prix Sept. 12. 
</P>
<P>
	Hakkinen admitted he didn't want to try to catch Coulthard.  
</P>
<P>
	``At the moment he is not the biggest threat in the  
championship,'' Hakkinen said. ``Eddie was fourth so that makes it 
interesting for the rest of the season.'' 
</P>
<P>
	McLaren also overtook Ferrari in the constructors standings.  
</P>
<P>
	Jean Todt, Ferrari's team chief, looks forward to better things.  
</P>
<P>
	``Next week we will be testing at Monza with both Eddie and  
Michael. This session will be very important,'' Todt said. 
</P>
<P>
	It wil give him a feel on whether Schumacher will support Irvine  
for a run at the drivers title. 
</P>
<P>
	Hakkinen said he didn't want to challenge his teammate in  
Sunday's race as both were pulling easily away from the rest of the 
field. 
</P>
<P>
	``If we continue like this all the way either one of us will go  
off or we will break the car,'' Hakkinen said. ``It was great to 
get the result for the team to get the first and second.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Coulthard took advantage of a slight hesitation at the start by  
Hakkinen and went on to an easy victory, 10.469 seconds ahead at 
the finish with Heinz-Harald Frentzen in a Jordan-Mugen-Honda 
third, 33.4 seconds back. Irvine was never in contention, nearly 45 
seconds behind. 
</P>
<P>
	``Considering the situation today, I am happy I am only one  
point back,'' Irvine said. ``We have not been fast enough all 
weekend.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The race was virtually decided at the start.  
</P>
<P>
	Hakkinen had pole position but hesitated a bit after almost  
jumping the start. 
</P>
<P>
	``The clutch cracked and the car moved, but luckily I was able  
to stop the car in time. However the lights went off just at that 
moment,'' Hakkinen said. 
</P>
<P>
	That allowed Coulthard to grab the lead heading into the hairpin  
first turn with Coulthard crowding Hakkinen, who was on the inside. 
</P>
<P>
	``Mika made a bad start and I made a good start and I was in  
front going into the corner,'' Coulthard said. ``I felt some 
contact and then I thought that I had better turn away, which is 
what I did. It made me fairly wide on the corner but I continued on 
my way. '' 
</P>
<P>
	The scene was almost a reversal of the beginning of the Austrian  
Grand Prix when Coulthard bumped his teammate off the track. This 
time, with both braking hard and tires smoking, they did not 
eliminate each other,

<HEADLINE> Tidbits From U.S. Tennis Open </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- A concert by the Lincoln Center Jazz Orchestra  
with trumpeter Wynton Marsalis will be part of the rededication of 
Louis Armstrong Stadium at the U.S. Open tennis championships 
Monday evening. 
</P>
<P>
	As part of the festivities, four jazz bands will perform  
throughout the day on the grounds of the USTA National Tennis 
Center in Flushing Meadows. 
</P>
<P>
	Renamed by the city of New York in 1973 in honor of the famed  
jazz trumpeter, who lived in nearby Corona, Queens, from 1943 until 
his death in 1971, Louis Armstrong Stadium was the centerpiece of 
the U.S. Open from 1978 until Arthur Ashe Stadium was opened next 
to it two years ago. 
</P>
<P>
	Monday's rededication of Louis Armstrong Stadium, which began  
life for the 1964-65 New York World's Fair, will complete the 
decade-long construction of the National Tennis Center, which is a 
public facility for most of the year. 
</P>
<P>
	Louis Armstrong Stadium now boasts 10,000 seats, a modernized  
Great Hall and an exterior that has been refaced with brick to

<P>
	With his 6-7 (5-7), 7-6 (7-2), 6-1 victory over Australian James  
Sekulov, Caratti advanced to the first round of the main draw where 
he will play Jacobi Diaz of Spain. 
</P>

<P>
	 *HINGIS HUBRIS:* It's been a rough year for Martina Hingis, even  
though she won the Australian Open, is ranked No. 1 in the world 
and is the top-seeded woman in the U.S. Open, which begins Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	Sally Jenkins, writing in Women's Sports &AMP; Fitness magazine,  
recalls how Hingis called lesbian French player Amelie Mauresmo 
``half a man'' at the Australian Open; dumped doubles partner Jana 
Novotna before the French Open because the 30-year-old was ``old 
and slow''; angered the Swiss tennis federation by refusing to play 
Fed Cup; stalked off the court after losing the French Open final 
to Steffi Graf until she was force-marched back for the trophy 
ceremony her mother/coach, Melanie Molitor; lost in listless 
fashion in the first round at Wimbledon to Jelena Dokic, and so 
offended her clothing sponsor, Tacchini, that the company chairman, 
Sergio Tacchini, terminated her contract. 
</P>
<P>
	Hingis and Molitor have sold their home in Zurich, Switzerland,  
and bought a house just outside Tampa, Fla. Jenkins writes that 
after vacationing in Cyprus with her latest boyfriend, Ivo 
Heuberger, a Swiss player on the men's tour, Hingis has buckled 
down again and working hard at practice, something the teen-ager 
doesn't like to do. 
</P>
<P>
	Hingis won her sixth tournament of the year recently by beating  
Monica Seles in the final of the du Maurier Open in Toronto.

<HEADLINE> Professors Stressed Over Technology </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- As college students research papers on the  
Internet and manipulate numbers on spreadsheets, their professors 
are feeling a little less in tune with the newest computer trends. 
</P>
<P>
	Two out of three professors say they are stressed trying to keep  
up with the emerging technology, surpassing traditional troubles 
such as publishing pressure and teaching loads, according to a new 
national survey of university faculty. 
</P>
<P>
	Researchers say they may be not be using the technology because  
they are scared by it, which means they never learn how it works or 
how to handle it calmly. 
</P>
<P>
	``The level of stress resulting from information technology is  
quite likely a reflection of the time faculty invest in computer 
use,'' said Linda Sax, a researcher who directed the faculty survey 
at the University of California, Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
	Nearly nine in 10 college instructors agreed that ``student use  
of computers enhances their learning.'' But only 35 percent use the 
Internet to conduct research, and just 38 percent use technology to 
create class presentations. 
</P>
<P>
	By contrast, 87 percent use computers to send e-mail and 85  
percent use them to write memos or letters. 
</P>
<P>
	Like most of his peers, Thomas King, a theology professor at  
Georgetown University, said he doesn't use computers for classroom 
presentations. 
</P>
<P>
	``I just don't have the time. I don't have the time to use  
everything they come up with,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	King uses e-mail, calling it a ``very nice development'' for  
keeping up with friends and colleagues. But he said even that can 
be cumbersome. 
</P>
<P>
	``I just get so many messages that it's a real chore,'' he said.  
</P>
<P>
	The 34,000 faculty members surveyed by mail in the 1998-99  
academic year represent 378 of the nation's two-year and four-year 
colleges and universities. The margin of error was not available 
Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	The survey suggests that colleges, like the nation's elementary  
and secondary schools, have a way to go in preparing teachers for 
their technically savvy students. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are seeing a generation that has practically grown up with  
computers as a part of everyday life, whether it's at home or in 
their K-12 classes,'' said Harlan Leebo, a UCLA spokesman. He noted 
that 80 percent of last year's freshmen arrived with their own 
computers. 
</P>
<P>
	UCLA does not require students to have computers, but others do.  
And some schools, such as the University of Florida, even offer 
counseling for students who suffer from computer anxiety. 
</P>
<P>
	But professors might not be getting such help. According to the  
survey, ``technology-related stress'' was only topped by meeting 
household responsibilities, not having a personal life and other 
time pressures. 
</P>
<P>
	It even topped traditional stresses. Sixty-seven percent of  
faculty said they felt regular stress keeping up with information 
technology. That beat the 62 percent stressed by their teaching 
loads, and only 50 percent said they were stressed by research or 
publishing demands. 
</P>
<P>
	Older faculty, those age 65 and older, were less likely to use  
the technology, and more likely to report that computers caused 
them stress. 
</P>
<P>
	The 1999 survey also found:  
</P>
<P>
	--Little change in faculty diversity since the first survey 10  
years ago; 92 percent of current instructors are white, compared 
with 90 percent in 1989. 
</P>
<P>
	--College staffs are aging; 32 percent of faculty are 55 years or  
older, compared with 24 percent in 1989. 
</P>
<P>
	--More faculty are satisfied with their jobs; 75 percent this  
year, compared with 69 percent in 1989.

<HEADLINE> Riley To Tour Southern Schools </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Like millions of school children, Education  
Secretary Richard Riley will be riding a big yellow bus this fall. 
</P>
<P>
	The nation's top education policy-maker will log 500 miles in a  
five-state, five-day ``back-to-school'' tour through the South, 
bringing the message that good schools equal a good economy. 
</P>
<P>
	``A high-quality education is the key to economic growth,'' said  
Riley, who noted that more than half the nation's job growth in the 
last 10 years has been in the South. 
</P>
<P>
	Returning to his roots, the one-time South Carolina governor  
hopes his visits to Tennessee, Alabama, South Carolina, North 
Carolina and Georgia will link the region's booming economy to its 
school reform efforts. 
</P>
<P>
	North Carolina, for instance, has more teachers certified by a  
voluntary national board aimed at producing ``master teachers'' 
than any other state. Georgia is guaranteeing that universities 
will retrain classroom teachers if schools don't think they are 
doing well, as long as the teacher is teaching in the field he or 
she studied. 
</P>
<P>
	Riley's tour, which starts Monday in Chattanooga, Tenn., will  
include 10 schools, from preschool to college. In past years, Riley 
marked the ``back-to-school'' ritual in late summer and early fall 
with plane trips to dozens of schools, where he read to young 
children or explained department policies to their teachers. This 
week, only the mode of transit is different. 
</P>
<P>
	The Success Express is really a two-bus caravan of  
air-conditioned, 35-passenger executive charter coaches covered 
with yellow vinyl and black trim. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm taking this trip to get a firsthand look at the progress  
that has been made, and at what can be done to get ready for the 
future,'' Riley said this month when he released record school 
enrollment numbers. 
</P>
<P>
	Highlights of the bus tour will include a rally in Chattanooga,  
Tenn., for the launch of the Mars Millennium Project. That is a 
program to help schoolchildren nationwide learn about science 
through designing a Mars colony. 
</P>
<P>
	The tour also will celebrate a reading program in Birmingham,  
Ala., and highlight arts education in Mableton, Ga. 
</P>
<P>
	More than 60 education officials and policy-makers are  
accompanying Riley as he greets schoolchildren and parents and 
delivers specific ideas on how parents can help their children get 
the most out of school. 
</P>
<P>
	Aides said Riley, 66, who plans to retire after his cabinet  
stint, wanted to do something special for the approaching 
millennium as the Clinton administration winds down. 
</P>
<P>
	``Both buses are full,'' said Riley spokeswoman Julie Green.  
``The secretary is really looking forward to having this 
opportunity to get people excited about going back to school and 
encouraging parents and communities to get involved in education.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Riley will also call attention to administration initiatives  
such as increased funding for school construction and new teacher 
hires to reduce class sizes. 
</P>
<P>
	This fall, Congress considers a 34-year-old law that governs the  
bulk of federal education spending. Republican leaders, planning a 
similar bus tour through Indiana, Kentucky and other states, are 
pushing their own education programs that emphasize tuition tax 
breaks for parents and more direct control of funding by the 
states. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't doubt Secretary Riley's desire to improve education,  
but he needs to explain what's missing in American education is 
accountability,'' said Nina Shokraii Rees, education policy analyst 
for the Heritage Foundation, a conservative Washington think tank. 
</P>
<P>
	The Success Express will stop Tuesday in Birmingham, Ala.;  
Wednesday in Atlanta and Greenville, S.C., and Thursday and Friday 
in Charlotte, N.C., and Fort Mill, S.C.

<HEADLINE> Cowboys Owner Jerry Jones Arrested </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HIGHLAND PARK, Texas (AP) -- Dallas Cowboys owner Jerry Jones was  
arrested Sunday after he drove away with his family before a police 
officer had finished writing a speeding ticket. 
</P>
<P>
	Jones was in one vehicle and his family was behind him in a  
Suburban around 10:30 a.m. Sunday on their way to church services, 
WFAA-TV reported. An employee of Jones' was driving the Suburban. 
</P>
<P>
	Highland Park police chief Darrell Fant said an officer pulled  
over the Suburban for going 45 mph in a 30 mph zone. Jones was not 
stopped, but pulled over on his own and went to where an officer 
was questioning the driver of the other car. 
</P>
<P>
	``He said he was in a rush and asked if he could go ahead and  
take the family members on to church,'' Fant said. ``The officer 
told him, `I'll just be a minute. I'll do this as fast as I can.' 
He made some remark and then did not follow the order of the 
officer and took the vehicle anyway.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Officials said the officer radioed ahead and another police  
vehicle tried to pull Jones over, but he did not stop. 
</P>
<P>
	With the police vehicle following at a slow pace, Jones  
proceeded to the Highland Park United Methodist Church on the 
Southern Methodist University campus, about a mile from where the 
traffic stop took place. 
</P>
<P>
	Jones let his family out at the church, then drove off again.  
Around the corner, he pulled into a private drive, where police 
arrested him. 
</P>
<P>
	WFAA said Jones was taken to the Highland Park Department of  
Public Safety. Shortly later, Jones' youngest son, Jerry Jones Jr., 
was seen pacing outside, talking on a cell phone. A while later, a 
car with the two inside pulled out of a back parking lot of the 
police station, tires squealing. 
</P>
<P>
	Jones was unavailable for comment. KDFW-TV, which was televising  
the Cowboys' exhibition game Sunday night with the Denver Broncos, 
said in a pregame show it would have an interview with Jones during 
the evening. 
</P>
<P>
	Later, KDFW reported that club officials had said someone ``may  
have gotten their signals crossed'' about the interview and that 
Jones might not be available. He had no comment before Sunday's 
game. 
</P>
<P>
	Jones was charged with fleeing the scene, a Class B misdemeanor  
punishable by up to a $2,000 fine and six months in jail. 
</P>
<P>
	Two years ago, Jones fined Barry Switzer, then the Cowboys head  
coach, $75,000 for his arrest on a gun charge, saying he wanted to 
show he was serious about repairing the Cowboys' tarnished image. 
</P>
<P>
	Switzer had a loaded .38-caliber pistol in his luggage at  
Dallas-Fort Worth International Airport. Switzer said he put the 
gun in his bag to hide it from children visiting his home, but 
forgot to remove it before going to the airport. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have to send the message that we really do get it,'' Jones  
said at the time he fined Switzer. ``That although you make a 
mistake, it still can very negatively impact a lot of people in our 
organization.''

<HEADLINE> Republicans Vow To Investigate Waco </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Senior congressional Republicans, declaring a  
lack of faith in Janet Reno's explanations, said Sunday they will 
move quickly to open House and Senate investigations of how the 
administration handled the 1993 Branch Davidian confrontation. 
</P>
<P>
	Rep. Dan Burton, R-Ind., chairman of the House Government Reform  
Committee, said he would issue subpoenas this week to Justice and 
Defense Department officials to ask why information on the deadly 
operation is just now coming to light. 
</P>
<P>
	Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Orrin Hatch, R-Utah, said  
he, too, is launching an inquiry. Attorney General Reno and other 
leaders at Justice, he said, don't ``have much credibility at this 
particular point.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The FBI revealed last week that ``a very limited number'' of  
incendiary tear gas grenades was shot at a bunker in the Waco, 
Texas, compound in the early hours of April 19, 1993. Later, the 
main wooden structure where the Branch Davidians had barricaded 
themselves burst into flames. 
</P>
<P>
	The revelation contradicted previous claims that no pyrotechnic  
devices were used in the effort to end the siege. Reno said 
Thursday she was ``very, very troubled'' by the disclosure and 
ordered a full review of the case. 
</P>
<P>
	Burton, who has openly clashed with Reno in past investigations  
into Whitewater and Democratic fund-raising practices, said he does 
not trust the attorney general. 
</P>
<P>
	``It would not surprise me if Janet Reno tried to keep a lid on  
this because I think she has done that in other areas,'' he said on 
NBC's ``Meet the Press.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But Justice Department spokesman Myron Marlin reiterated Reno's  
own anger at the new revelations. 
</P>
<P>
	``She had asked for and received assurances that these devices  
would not be used and were not used,'' Marlin said. ``It is 
extremely frustrating, and that's why she plans to get to the 
bottom of this.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Hatch, on ``Fox News Sunday,'' said he had no evidence to  
question FBI and Justice assertions involving the incendiary tear 
gas grenades. The bureau insists they were fired only at the 
concrete bunker and not the main structure, and the government did 
not cause the deaths of Branch Davidian leader David Koresh and 
some 80 of his followers. 
</P>
<P>
	The FBI, in a fact sheet released Sunday, said the military-type  
gas canisters were fired at the underground bunker several hours 
before the fire started. The department cited ``clear evidence,'' 
including electronic surveillance tapes, that the fact sheet said 
proves conclusively the Davidians started the fire. 
</P>
<P>
	But Hatch said one reason he is running for the Republican  
presidential nomination is to ``change the people at the Justice 
Department.'' Reno, he said, ``never really quite comes out in a 
forthright way with anything.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The attorney general was defended by Sen. Charles Schumer,  
D-N.Y., who said on NBC that he had ``real faith in her 
integrity.'' But Schumer also said she should seek an independent, 
outside investigation rather than have the FBI or Justice look into 
why the information on the incendiary devices did not come out 
earlier. 
</P>
<P>
	``The FBI had its chance to do this investigation on its own,  
they clearly muffed it,'' Schumer said. 
</P>
<P>
	Two former FBI officials involved in the Waco operation said  
they were certain their agents did not cause the fatal fire and 
blamed the confusion on a bureaucratic foul-up. 
</P>
<P>
	There was a reference to the pyrotechnic grenades in the volumes  
of official documents produced after the 51-day siege, but ``in 
some ways we are so bureaucratic I think it can get lost in the 
recesses of the agency,'' Bob Ricks, FBI spokesman during the WACO 
siege, said on ABC's ``This Week.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``This was not a cover-up, this was not any grand conspiracy or  
anything else. What it was a very glaring oversight,'' Byron Sage, 
the FBI's chief Waco hostage negotiator, said on NBC. 
</P>
<P>
	Sage and Ricks also played down disclosures that officers from  
the Army's secretive Delta Force anti-terror unit were on the scene 
at Waco. 
</P>
<P>
	Sage said two to four Delta Force officers were present from  
time to time, but only as observers and advisers. He said the FBI 
hostage and rescue team has long trained and exchanged information 
with the military. 
</P>
<P>
	Branch Davidian family attorney Michael Caddell said on ABC,  
however, that a Delta Force presence at a police operation violates 
the law. 
</P>
<P>
	He also said a court hearing two years ago alluded to puffs of  
smoke around the underground bunker. ``Somebody was involved in a 
cover-up,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> The Kid's in the Title Picture </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SARATOGA SPRINGS, N.Y. (AP) -- Jockey Jose Santos says that he  
knows in his heart Lemon Drop Kid is one of the best 3-year-olds in 
training. 
</P>
<P>
	Well, the colt also is one of the best on paper and, more  
importantly, on the race track. 
</P>
<P>
	He raced into the 3-year-old championship picture by winning the  
1 1/4-mile Travers at Saratoga on Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
	Lemon Drop Kid's three-quarter-length victory over Vision and  
Verse, with Menifee third, was his second in a $1 million Grade I 
stakes in his last three starts. The other was in the 1 1/2-mile 
Belmont Stakes, in which he beat Vision and Verse by a nose. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's got a lot to do yet,'' trainer Scotty Schulhofer said  
when asked about Lemon Drop Kid's chances of becoming the champion 
3-year-old and maybe Horse of the year. ``He's going to have to 
beat Behrens and some older horses to get Horse of the Year.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Immediately after the Travers, Schulhofer said Lemon Drop Kid  
could run in the 1 1/8-mile Woodward at Belmont Park on Sept. 18 or in 
Belmont's 1 1/4-mile Jockey Club Gold Cup on Oct. 10, or in both. On 
Sunday, however, he said the colt would run in the Woodward, then 
in the 1 1/4-mile Breeders Cup Classic on Nov. 6 at Gulfstream Park. 
Both are Grade I weight-for-age stakes. 
</P>
<P>
	He is expected to meet 5-year-old Behrens, leader of the  
handicap division, in the Gold Cup and the Classic. 
</P>
<P>
	Still in the hunt for the 3-year-old championship is  
Charismatic, the Kentucky Derby-Preakness winner, retired after 
breaking an ankle while finishing third in the Belmont. 
</P>
<P>
	Charismatic was to leave Belmont Park by van Sunday evening for  
Lane's End Farm at Versailles, Ky., where he will stand at stud, 
Mike Marlowe, an assistant to trainer D. Wayne Lukas, said Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is an improving horse, and I'm not sure where we'll go  
next,'' said Bill Mott, trainer of Vision and Verse. 
</P>
<P>
	Trainer Elliott Walden did not know what would be the next start  
for stretch-running Menifee, whose chances Saturday were 
compromised by a slow pace. The Kentucky Derby-Preakness runner-up 
went to the post as the 8-5 favorite off his victory Aug. 8 in the 
1 1/8-mile Haskell Invitational Handicap at Monmouth Park. 
</P>
<P>
	While Walden was noncommittal, co-owner James Stone of New  
Orleans indicated he'd like to see Menifee race in the 1 1/4-mile 
Super Derby on Oct. 2 at Louisiana Downs. 
</P>
<P>
	Three of Lemon Drop Kid's five wins in 13 career starts have  
been in Grade I stakes -- he won Belmont's Futurity last year -- and 
he also has three seconds and two thirds. The $600,000 winner's 
purse boosted his earnings to $1,541,470. He paid a winning mutuel 
of $9.30, and was timed in 2:02. 
</P>
<P>
	``I hope he gets a little credit now,'' Santos said. ``He had to  
prove he was the real thing. I have to give all the credit to 
Scotty Schulhofer. He's done a wonderful job with this horse. He 
told me he had the horse 110 percent and he was right.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Schulhofer decided not to push Lemon Drop Kid because he was a  
May foal. When he finished ninth in the Kentucky Derby, it was only 
his third start of the year. The colt was held out of the 
Preakness, then won the Belmont and finished second in the Jim 
Dandy on Aug. 8 at Saratoga on a sloppy track -- a surface he not 
like -- before winning the Travers. 
</P>
<P>
	``Scotty has prepared him magnificently,'' owner Jeanne Vance  
said. ``He has matured since the Belmont.''

<HEADLINE> Library of Congress Has Unusual Maps </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Anyone who wants to pinpoint where James Bond  
met that blonde with the bottle of champagne on her curvy hip need 
only consult ``Language of the Land,'' an unusual book published by 
the Library of Congress offering maps of imaginary places. 
</P>
<P>
	Another map shows just where Tom Sawyer whitewashed his famous  
fence. Still another points out the spot at which Paul Bunyan's ox 
Babe, trying to catch a field mouse, dug the Mammoth Cave. 
</P>
<P>
	L. Frank Baum's ``Wonderful World of Oz'' is charted.  
Illustrator Dick Martin located the Shifting Sands and Deadly 
Desert, with Emerald City and Gunda's Palace smack in the middle. 
</P>
<P>
	A Yellow Brick Road is there too, though it's not clearly  
labeled. 
</P>
<P>
	``Literary maps depict ideas as much as places,'' wrote  
co-author Martha Hopkins in the book's introduction. 
</P>
<P>
	Most literary maps, Hopkins notes, are not drawn to scale and  
contain little detailed information on topography, geology, towns, 
rivers or roads. They ``present a world in which authors and books 
are the dominant features,'' she explains. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, some of the places are real enough. Author Ian Fleming  
made his James Bond stories credible by searching out authentic 
settings for what the library calls his ``assignments and 
assignations.'' Only ``Agent 007'' himself and his exploits sprang 
from Fleming's imagination. 
</P>
<P>
	J.R.R. Tolkien's completely imaginary ``Middle Earth'' rates  
three highly detailed maps. 
</P>
<P>
	Somewhere between reality and imagination lies Mark Twain's St.  
Petersburg, the home of Tom Sawyer, modeled on Hannibal, Mo. That's 
where the young Sam Clemens lived before he went piloting on the 
Mississippi, where he got his pen-name. 
</P>
<P>
	The half-whitewashed fence is on St. Petersburg's Hill Street,  
just across from Becky Thatcher's house. 
</P>
<P>
	``There ain't anything that is so interesting to look at as a  
place that a book has talked about,'' Twain quotes Tom as saying in 
later life. 
</P>
<P>
	``Language of the Land'' describes and reproduces the fantastic  
maps, along with many others covering the literary landscape. It 
was compiled by Hopkins of the library's Interpretive Programs 
Office and Michael Buscher of the Geography and Map Division. 
</P>
<P>
	The maps mostly cover English-speaking countries -- Canada and  
Australia have maps that illustrate their best-known books. Even 
one for Paris gives a large space to Oscar Wilde and American 
writer Gertrude Stein, whom the French do not see as important to 
their literature. There's also a bright map, shaped and colored 
like a parrot -- written in English -- devoted to Latin American 
writers. 
</P>
<P>
	Maps from days when Latin and Greek got more intensive study  
show the voyages of Odysseus and Aeneas. Even troubled Balkan 
politics gets touched on -- unintentionally. A map on places in 
Hungarian literature includes portions of Romania which once 
belonged to Hungary, and which many Hungarians would dearly like to 
get back.

<HEADLINE> Gibson Donates to Women's Shelter </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ROCK HILL, S.C. (AP) -- When Mel Gibson leaves South Carolina  
after filming ``The Patriot,'' he'll be remembered for helping 
expand a local domestic violence shelter. 
</P>
<P>
	Gibson made a sizable contribution to the Safe Passage Inc.  
shelter this past week, said Peggy Payne, shelter executive 
director. Payne wouldn't say exactly how much Gibson gave, but 
noted that ``it'll go a long way toward our new facility we're 
building.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Gibson's publicist, Alan Nierob, confirmed the donation but said  
the actor does not like to comment on his philanthropic work and 
contributions. 
</P>
<P>
	Gibson does not necessarily make contributions in areas where he  
is filming, Nierob said, but in this case the actor chose Safe 
Passage Inc. from a list of South Carolina charities compiled at 
his request. 
</P>
<P>
	``He found a place he thought would benefit greatly,'' Nierob  
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Safe Passage plans to start building a bigger shelter in Rock  
Hill in November or December. It will have six bedrooms and 
bathrooms and offices, as well as play, dining and laundry areas 
for as many as 25 people.

	Hurricane on Unpredictable Path  
</P>
<P>
	CHARLESTON, S.C. (AP) -- Forecasters say Hurricane Dennis should  
become a Category 3 storm with winds up to 130 mph by tomorrow, but 
say they aren't positive where or even if the storm will hit the 
U.S. mainland. At 8 a.m. EDT, Dennis was centered 225 miles 
south-southeast of Charleston, and about 295 miles south of 
Wilmington, N.C. The storm was moving northwesterly at 10 mph, with 
maximum sustained winds near 100 mph. Coastal areas in the 
Carolinas and Georgia are under a tropical storm warning.

	CAPE TOWN, South Africa (AP) -- Gale-force winds ripped roofs off  
homes and collapsed walls today, killing at least three people and

	Global Warming Could Hurt Tourism  
</P>
<P>
	LONDON (AP) -- A new report warned today that the effects of  
global warming could hurt tourism at the most popular vacations 
spots for years to come. The report, conducted by a British 
university for the Worldwide Fund for Nature, said the warming 
trend could result in shorter seasons and less snowfall at ski 
resorts, and more days with unbearable heat in popular 
Mediterranean vacation spots. That means countries like Mexico that 
greatly depend on tourism could be hit hard. Air travel itself is a 
major contributor to the situation, the report said. Passenger jets 
are the fastest growing source of greenhouse gas emissions, which 
increase the risk of global warming.

Rabin's assassin today to overturn a conspiracy conviction he 
received together with his brother and a friend, choosing instead 
to stiffen his sentence. In addition to the life sentence he 
received for the assassination, Yigal Amir had received a separate, 
five-year sentence for conspiracy to commit the murder and for 
plotting attacks against Arabs. The sentence was increased today to 
eight years. Amir, an extreme right-wing religious Jew, shot Rabin 
at a peace rally in November 1995.

	JERUSALEM (AP) -- Israeli and Palestinian negotiators are trying  
to resolve the final barriers to implementing a U.S.-brokered peace 
accord ahead of a visit to the region by U.S. Secretary of State 
Madeleine Albright. Differences over Israel's promised release of 
Palestinian prisoners has been holding up a long-delayed deal to 
turn over more of the West Bank to Yasser Arafat's Palestinian 
Authority. But after yesterday's meetings, the two sides apparently 
have ironed out most of the details to clear the way for Israel's 
withdrawal from 11 percent of the West Bank.

to miss the season. Green was injured on a late hit by safety 
Rodney Harrison late in the first half. The Rams lured Green away

<HEADLINE> Fan Pay Tribute to Charlie Parker </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	KANSAS CITY, Mo. (AP) -- Fans and saxophone players turned out at  
Lincoln Cemetery to pay tribute to Charlie Parker, the influential 
Kansas City jazzman. 
</P>
<P>
	Parker, a sax player who died in 1955, would have been 79 on  
Sunday. The 40th annual gathering to honor his memory was held 
Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
	``Everyone says Kansas City is a jazz town,'' said Sonny Gibson,  
chairman of the Charlie Parker Memorial Foundation. ``The musicians 
that really appreciate him will come out here every year and 
blow.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``If there's a religion I believe in, it's Bird,'' said John  
Gleason, one of the three musicians who played their saxophones at 
the grave site, referring to Parker's nickname. ``He was the 
spiritual master.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Parker, born in Kansas, began his career at the age of 15 in  
Kansas City's then-thriving jazz scene, but his talents didn't 
flourish until he moved to New York and became one of the 
originators of bebop.

<HEADLINE> Scientists Stalk Elusive Indiana Bat </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PORT MATILDA, Pa. (AP) -- Dusk gives way to darkness on Bald  
Eagle Mountain as a bat scientist and her assistant rig flimsy 
poles with rope and string up two wispy nets. 
</P>
<P>
	Switching off their headlamps, they begin another night's  
stakeout for the elusive, endangered Indiana bat. A search like 
theirs, they realize, can have serious implications: The 
controversial critter has become a scourge to loggers and builders 
-- and a savior to environmental groups fighting to protect hardwood 
forests. This central Pennsylvania woodland is one of the 
battlegrounds. 
</P>
<P>
	It's not long before something flits overhead.  
</P>
<P>
	``Let me get the bat detector,'' says Amy Henry, a 29-year-old  
scientist whose consulting firm was hired to make sure no Indiana 
bats are in the way of a $500 million interstate highway under 
construction here. 
</P>
<P>
	She clicks on the handheld radio. Static. Then, faintly,  
confirmation: thwick-thwick-thwick-thwick-thwick! 
</P>
<P>
	``That's a bat,'' she says in a scientist's monotone as the  
silhouette zips down the narrow lane cut through the forest, toward 
Henry's 20-foot-high mist net. She follows, and as she gets to the 
net, her headlamp flashes on something struggling. 
</P>
<P>
	It could be a big brown bat, or even a flying squirrel. Gingerly  
untangling it, she examines it under a flashlight. Another false 
alarm: This one is a northern long-eared bat, one of the Indiana 
bat's cousins. At the end of the four weeks, Henry's group turned 
up no Indiana bats. 
</P>
<P>
	But their search along the future Interstate 99 corridor is a  
lesson in Indiana bat politics: All it takes is a solitary Indiana 
bat -- and sometimes none at all -- to slow a project. 
</P>
<P>
	The 200 bats that winter in a cave 20 miles away caused many  
headaches: They led to lengthy negotiations between the state 
Department of Transportation and the U.S. Fish and Wildlife 
Service. And they cost a chunk of taxpayer money. Cincinnati-based 
BHE Environmental Inc., Henry's employer, was paid $180,000 for the 
search last month. 
</P>
<P>
	If one were found, PennDOT would have had to limit logging for  
the new highway, possibly disrupting the construction timetable. 
</P>
<P>
	Even now, PennDOT's bat woes are by no means over. The project  
is only clear for two years. 
</P>
<P>
	Elsewhere, work has been stopped in places where only a single  
specimen has been found. Projects have stalled in forests where no 
bats have been spotted, ever. They can be stalled even though 
scientists have a hard time pinning down where the critter roams to 
eat and roost. 
</P>
<P>
	``When you're dealing with an endangered species, it's basically  
a presence-absence question,'' said Robert Currie of the U.S. Fish 
and Wildlife Service. ``If it's there, you have to deal with it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Scientists believe that the bats' numbers are declining because  
of damage to their summer habitat in forests from Missouri to New 
Hampshire. On that premise, activists -- citing the Endangered 
Species Act -- are increasingly taking state governments, federal 
agencies and private industry to court. 
</P>
<P>
	The logic of endangered species laws forces agencies to err on  
the side of caution. 
</P>
<P>
	Two trapped Indiana bats prompted Pennsylvania's Allegheny  
National Forest and Vermont's Green Mountain National Forest to 
restrict timbering temporarily. The U.S. Forest Service is drawing 
up revised plans for managing the bat in several national forests. 
It may limit how many and what kind of trees are logged in the 
future. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's better to assume it is there and manage the forest  
accordingly than to try to determine that it's not there,'' said 
Mark Bosch, coordinator of the forest service's endangered species 
programs. ``Even if you do prove that it's not there today, what do 
you do the next day when one decides to fly into the forest?'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Indiana Bat Recovery Team, a group of government officials,  
scientists, environmentalists and logging industry representatives, 
is revising its management guidelines. The concept is to manage as 
if the bat is there, whether or not one has been seen, but a first 
draft has sparked controversy. 
</P>
<P>
	Fueling the debate are environmental groups, including  
Heartwood, a regional network; the Allegheny Defense Project in 
Pennsylvania, and the Conservation Action Project in New Hampshire. 
</P>
<P>
	``When agencies are unwilling to take the initiative to protect  
their habitat, that's when we step in in court,'' said Heartwood's 
Devin Scherubel. ``The scientific literature is clear enough and 
strong enough the courts are willing to side with the activists 
over the word of public agencies.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But considering all the trouble the bat is creating, the  
scientists are not always so sure where the bats are. 
</P>
<P>
	Trapping is the most common way of finding them, but even some  
bat specialists admit that it hardly offers conclusive answers. 
</P>
<P>
	Weeks of netting in the forest -- especially along the edges of  
its range, including Pennsylvania -- sometimes yields only a few 
trapped bats, or none at all, as in Pennsylvania. 
</P>
<P>
	The reason? Bats in general are elusive flyers that are hard to  
capture as they roam the countryside searching for insects during 
the summer months. They fly high up in the forest canopy, above the 
highest nets. Scientists try to cut them off as they migrate 
between feeding stops along river corridors and narrow forest 
trails. 
</P>
<P>
	A new technology called anabat can detect the bats' distinctive  
ultrasound call, but it requires recordings of the calls of various 
species. In the Allegheny National Forest, anabat detected two 
Indiana bats, allowing the searchers to concentrate on certain 
locations and, in the end, snare one. 
</P>
<P>
	``You have to realize Indiana bats are incredibly difficult to  
catch. If you caught one bat, you're pretty sure that there are 
others,'' Scherubel said. 
</P>
<P>
	The Indiana bats' numbers have declined to 350,000 from 800,000  
four decades ago. Nine out of 10 winter in a handful of caves in 
Indiana, Kentucky and Missouri. 
</P>
<P>
	Other endangered bats have recovered when their caves were gated  
to keep out hikers, spelunkers, vandals and the curious. For some 
reason, the Indiana bat has not responded. Researchers speculate 
that it might be less adaptable to ever-encroaching development. 
</P>
<P>
	The bat troubles on I-99 prompted one frustrated PennDOT planner  
to hang a photo of the critter -- Myotis sodalis, to scientists -- in 
the office. 
</P>
<P>
	The caption: ``Myprojectum stopicus.''  
</P>
<P>
	------	 
</P>
<P>
	Facts about the Indiana bat, which has stalled timbering and  
construction projects from Missouri to New Hampshire: 
</P>
<P>
	-- 1960 U.S. population: 800,000.  
</P>
<P>
	-- 1996 U.S. population: 350,000.  
</P>
<P>
	-- Nine out of 10 Indiana bats live in 10 caves in Indiana,  
Kentucky and Missouri. Some are scattered in smaller caves in New 
York, Pennsylvania, Ohio and elsewhere. 
</P>
<P>
	-- Biologists blame pesticides, development and interference with  
caves for the precipitous decline in population. One landowner in 
Kentucky strung lights and built a walking trail through a cave 
housing nearly 100,000 hibernating bats. The agitation caused by 
the interlopers killed bats weakened by months of hibernation. 
Today only 100 Indiana bats winter there.

<HEADLINE> 'Sixth Sense' Tops Box Office Again / Box Office  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Bruce Willis' ghostly thriller ``The Sixth  
Sense'' joined ``Titanic'' and ``Phantom Menace'' as the only 
movies in history to bring in more than $20 million for four 
straight weeks, according to industry estimates Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	``The Sixth Sense,'' which stars Willis as a therapist treating  
a boy who talks to the dead, grossed $20.1 million this week for a 
total of $138.9 million in four weeks. 
</P>
<P>
	Buena Vista captured the two top spots in a weekend crowded by  
eight new movies. The studio's action thriller ``13th Warrior,'' 
starring Antonio Banderas as a diplomat roped into battle in 10th 
century Europe, grossed $10.3 million in its debut at No. 2. 
</P>
<P>
	The last studio to have both the No. 1 and No. 2 slots was 20th  
Century Fox with ``Titanic'' and the re-release of ``Grease'' in 
1998. 
</P>
<P>
	Chuck Viane, president of Buena Vista distribution, expected  
some tough competition next week with the debut of ``Chill 
Factor,'' starring Cuba Gooding Jr. and Skeet Ulrich. 
</P>
<P>
	With so many movies debuting this weekend, though, it was tough  
for any one film to garner a strong following, said Paul 
Dergarabedian, president of Exhibitor Relations Co. Inc., which 
tracks movie ticket sales. 
</P>
<P>
	``The Muse,'' a highly publicized comedy starring Albert Brooks  
and Sharon Stone, opened with $4.2 million for seventh place. 
</P>
<P>
	The movie appeals to an older crowd that doesn't typically run  
to the box office on opening weekend, Dergarabedian said. 
</P>
<P>
	Action film ``In Too Deep,'' starring Omar Epps and LL Cool J,  
placed eighth with $4.1 million, and ``The Astronaut's Wife,'' with 
Johnny Depp, was 10th with $4 million. 
</P>
<P>
	``Typically summer blockbusters don't come out in August,''  
Dergarabedian said. ``So the timing for 'Sixth Sense' was 
perfect.'' 
</P>
<P>
	It didn't have to compete against summer blockbusters like  
``Star Wars: Episode I: The Phantom Menace,'' ``Notting Hill,'' or 
even ``Wild West,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	``The Blair Witch Project,'' meanwhile, slipped from No. 5 and  
tied for eighth place with $4.1 million. 
</P>
<P>
	The low-budget shocker has grossed $128 million since it opened  
in wide release five weeks ago, making it one of the most 
successful independent films in history. 
</P>
<P>
	Estimated grosses for Friday through Sunday at North American  
theaters, according to Exhibitor Relations Co. Inc.: 
</P>
<P>
	1. ``The Sixth Sense,'' $20.1 million.  
</P>
<P>
	2. ``13th Warrior,'' $10.3 million.  
</P>
<P>
	3. ``Runaway Bride,'' $6.9 million.  
</P>
<P>
	4. ``Bowfinger,'' $6.6 million.

<HEADLINE> Reid Wins Lopsided Decision </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LAS VEGAS (AP) -- David Reid toyed with and taunted Keith  
Mullings for 12 rounds Saturday night, winning a lopsided decision 
to retain his WBA super welterweight title. 
</P>
<P>
	The 1996 Olympic gold medalist put on a display of boxing  
skills, thoroughly outclassing the game but ineffective Mullings to 
defend his title for the second time and remain undefeated in 14 
pro fights. 
</P>
<P>
	Reid mugged at times and talked to Mullings throughout the  
fight, laughing at him in the final round as the challenger tried 
unsuccessfully to turn the fight into a brawl. 
</P>
<P>
	It was the second title defense in six weeks for Reid, who hurt  
Mullings with a few right hands but never pressed his chance at a 
knockout. Reid spent much of his time backpedaling and throwing 
jabs, much to the displeasure of the crowd that booed the decision. 
</P>
<P>
	All three judges scored the fight 117-111 in favor of Reid. The  
Associated Press had Reid winning 118-110. 
</P>
<P>
	The tone of the fight was set early, with Reid using a  
dominating left jab that frustrated Mullings as he tried to chase 
the champion around the ring. 
</P>
<P>
	Reid rocked Mullings with a right hand midway through the third  
round, but he was mostly content to use his jab and occasional 
quick combinations to score points and build up a big lead. 
</P>
<P>
	Mullings, who held a share of the WBC junior middleweight title  
before losing it to Francisco Castillejo of Spain on Jan. 29, never 
was able to land effectively against Reid and seemed tight from the 
opening bell. 
</P>
<P>
	Reid won the 154-pound title from Laurent Boudouani on March 6.  
This was the fourth straight fight that Reid (14-0, 7 knockouts) 
went the 12-round distance. 
</P>
<P>
	Though it went the distance, this was a fight that Reid knew he  
had won early. 
</P>
<P>
	By the fourth round, he was making faces at Mullings and mocking  
him, and both fighters were talking to each other in the ring. 
</P>
<P>
	By the time the fight had reached its midway point, Mullings was  
thoroughly frustrated. When Reid was late coming out for the sixth 
round because of loose tape on his gloves, Mullings ran across the 
ring and yelled at him before referee Jay Nady pushed him back. 
</P>
<P>
	At the end of two different rounds, Mullings tried to go after  
Reid as he went back to his corner, and he also got warnings from 
Nady for low blows and for hitting with his elbow. 
</P>
<P>
	Reid's droopy left eyelid was never a factor in the fight,  
although his eye appeared halfway closed even before the fight 
began and closed even more as it continued. 
</P>
<P>
	Reid, 154, of Philadelphia, earned $450,000 for the fight, while  
Mullings, also 154, of Brooklyn, N.Y., earned $100,000. 
</P>
<P>
	In another fight, Lance Whitaker bloodied Monte Barrett's nose  
in the final round of their heavyweight fight and pulled out a 
12-round split decision win. 
</P>
<P>
	It was the first loss in 22 fights for Barrett, who paid the  
price for trying to work inside against the 6-foot-8 Whitaker. 
</P>
<P>
	Whitaker (19-1) was the harder puncher although Barrett (21-1)  
appeared to land more of his punches. Whitaker won by six points on 
one scorecard and four on another. A third judge favored Barrett by 
two points. 
</P>
<P>
	Whitaker, of Los Angeles, weighed 249 pounds to 218 for Barrett,  
of Queens, N.Y.

<HEADLINE> Russian Claims Chess Championship </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LAS VEGAS (AP) -- After 40 moves and nearly four hours of play,  
Russian Alexander Khalifman clinched the World Chess Championship 
title with a draw against Vladimir Akopian. 
</P>
<P>
	At the end of Saturday's game, the 27-year-old Akopian stared at  
a position where he had no chance to win, shrugged his shoulders, 
and offered his opponent a draw. 
</P>
<P>
	Khalifman, 33, thus became chess' 14th world champion. He joins  
fellow Russians, Anatoly Karpov, whom he just replaced, and Garry 
Kasparov as the only champions of the last quarter century. 
</P>
<P>
	Neither Karpov nor Kasparov participated in the Las Vegas  
championship due to disputes with the Federation Internationale des 
Echecs (FIDE), which provided the $3 million prize for the 100 
participants in the monthlong event. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't claim to be the best chess player in the world,''  
Khalifman said after the game, ``but it is fact that I just won the 
World Championship, and it is the only world championship that the 
chess world has.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Akopian,of Armenia, tried for a complicated game, but the new  
champion managed to solve all of the problems and end the match 
with a score of 3 1/2-2 1/2. 
</P>
<P>
	Khalifman earned $660,000, while Akopian settled for $396,000.  
</P>
<P>
	Khalifman previously won the championship of Russia, the world's  
top chess power, but he had never been considered among the world's 
elite. 
</P>
<P>
	Kasparov, generally recognized as the world's top player, has  
demeaned the knockout format of the tournament, and most of the 
players who made it to the semifinals, calling them ``tourists'' on 
his Web site. l

<HEADLINE> Global Warming Could Hurt Tourism </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LONDON (AP) -- Heat waves, drought and disease brought on by  
global warming could keep tourists away from some of the world's 
most popular vacation destinations in the coming decades, a new 
report warned Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	The report, conducted by a British university for the Worldwide  
Fund for Nature, said the changing climate could have a serious 
impact on countries that depend on tourism. 
</P>
<P>
	Problems associated with rising temperatures are expected to  
include shorter seasons and less snowfall at ski resorts, and more 
days with unbearable heat in popular Mediterranean vacation spots. 
</P>
<P>
	``The tourism industry could be faced with huge costs as global  
warming begins to influence decisions about when and where people 
go on holiday,'' said Ute Collier, a researcher with the University 
of East Anglia's Climatic Research Unit, which conducted the study 
for the conservation group. 
</P>
<P>
	The study analyzed the potential impact of the changing climate  
on some of the world's favorite vacation sites. 
</P>
<P>
	It found that shorter skiing seasons and less snow are likely to  
hit the ski industry in the Alps and Scotland, while extreme heat 
could keep tourists away, tax water supplies and increase the risk 
of disease in traditional vacation destinations such as Greece, 
Turkey and southeastern Spain. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition, wildlife-related tourism in east and south Africa  
could be disrupted as drought and changing temperatures drive 
animals out of protected areas, while rising temperatures and less 
rainfall could damage the fragile ecosystems of Brazil's 
rainforests, the report said. 
</P>
<P>
	In the United States, the Atlantic coasts of Delaware, Maryland  
and Florida will be more vulnerable to erosion as sea levels rise, 
the report predicted. Oceans expand as temperatures increase, 
causing sea levels to rise, sometimes by as much as 4 inches a 
decade. 
</P>
<P>
	Air travel itself is a major contributor to the situation, the  
report said. Passenger jets are the fastest growing source of 
greenhouse gas emissions, which increase the risk of global 
warming. 
</P>
<P>
	With the number of international travelers expected to increase  
from 594 million in 1996 to 1.6 billion by 2020, the conservation 
group warned that the problems may only get worse. 
</P>
<P>
	To help slow the effects of global warming the nature group  
called for further movement away from fossil fuels to renewable 
energy sources. The group also urged governments to improve energy 
efficiency, particularly in tourist resorts.

<HEADLINE> Ill. Schools Seek Better Learning </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- At 10:10 a.m. on a hot summer day, teacher  
Marilynn Clark is racing against the clock. 
</P>
<P>
	While third-graders in Chicago's 400 summer schools are due for  
a multiplication lesson, Clark's students are stuck on reading. 
</P>
<P>
	``Five minutes, five minutes,'' Clark said recently while  
scurrying around her stuffy classroom. 
</P>
<P>
	At 10:20 a.m., she hurried through a homework rundown. By 10:30  
a.m., she was back on track, starting a multiplication drill and 
story problem along with the rest of the city's third-grade 
teachers. 
</P>
<P>
	For three years, Chicago's summer program for failing students  
has laid out what should be taught, minute by minute. Compared to 
most school systems, where teachers create their own lesson plans 
from a common curriculum, the approach leaves little to chance. 
</P>
<P>
	Buoyed by its success, officials are bringing a similar approach  
to the regular school year. While the optional daily lesson plans 
aren't as detailed, they generally tell teachers what and how to 
teach each day. 
</P>
<P>
	``People need help,'' said Paul Vallas, who began a reform  
effort in 1995 after taking over the city's beleaguered schools. 
``If teachers are new, if they are teaching out of their 
certification, or they are simply clueless, they'll have the 
resources needed to guarantee that there will at least be a minimum 
level of quality instruction.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But detractors say teachers in the nation's third largest school  
system shouldn't be asked to take a uniform approach. 
</P>
<P>
	``You can't apply the same cookie cutter to each school in the  
city,'' said Suzanne Davenport, acting director of Designs for 
Change, a local reform group. ``This approach said that all 
students and teachers are the same, and if we give them the same 
curriculum, we'll get the same results.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The lesson plans, which cover kindergarten through 12th grade,  
were piloted in 60 schools last year. They earned praise from some 
teachers who either used them exclusively or combined them with 
their own curriculums. 
</P>
<P>
	``It gave me a road map to follow,'' said Derrick Williams, a  
high school teacher who switched from social studies to English 
last year. ``If we want to hold our kids to high standards, there 
needs to be more continuity in what's taught.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Other teachers fear the plans will stifle creativity and reduce  
the value of their own education. 
</P>
<P>
	``If this becomes mandatory, why even get a degree in  
teaching?'' said third-grade teacher Heather Boland. ``All you have 
to do is read a manual.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Since the late 1980s, many districts nationwide have tried to  
improve teacher quality by introducing competency tests, tougher 
educational standards and higher requirements at teacher colleges. 
But education experts say no other large district has gone as far 
as Chicago. 
</P>
<P>
	Once dubbed the nation's worst, the city's school system has  
lately earned a reputation as a laboratory for reform. Under 
Vallas, dozens of schools have been built or renovated, social 
promotion curtailed, and summer and after-school programs expanded. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, test scores have been inching up from dismal levels,  
and enrollment is growing after years of decline. 
</P>
<P>
	Vallas' latest initiative is targeted at the city's annual crop  
of 1,200 new teachers and the up to 10 percent of instructors who 
teach out of their subject area, along with those who simply don't 
measure up. 
</P>
<P>
	``If you can't get rid of bad teachers,'' he said, ``why not  
give them a curriculum developed by the best teachers in the system 
to use?'' 
</P>
<P>
	But one expert said teachers may feel as if they're being  
lectured, not guided. 
</P>
<P>
	``The message of this is that we don't trust the teachers,''  
said Jackie Ancess, associate director at the National Center for 
Restructuring Education, Schools and Teaching at Columbia 
University. ``You're basically saying teachers don't know how to 
plan a series of lessons for a year.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Vallas dismisses such criticism. This is not, he said, about  
``teacher proofing,'' but about giving teachers the training they 
deserve. 
</P>
<P>
	``Only in education do we say, 'Here's your classroom, here are  
your general standards, you're on your own,''' Vallas said. 
</P>
<P>
	With the new school year just underway, many Chicago teachers  
say they're willing to defer judgment on the lesson plans. Anything 
that might raise standards, they say, is worth a try. 
</P>
<P>
	``If we were doing what we needed to be doing in terms of  
student achievement, this wouldn't even be coming up,'' said Sandra 
Lewis, an elementary school principal.

<HEADLINE>  Elephant Land Mine Victim Recovers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LAMPANG, Thailand (AP) -- She's still too weak to use her trunk  
to eat, but Motola, the elephant that lost part of her foot to a 
land mine, was on her way to recovery Sunday after a lengthy 
operation. 
</P>
<P>
	Surgeons worked for three hours to cut away dead flesh and  
shattered bones from her front left foot on Saturday. On Sunday, 
doctors said they were pleased with her progress, giving hope the 
38-year old pachyderm will one day walk again. 
</P>
<P>
	``She's improving,'' said Suwichai Rojanasathen, an expert from  
Chiang Mai University in northern Thailand. ``What we need to make 
sure of now is that she eats well and the wound is cleaned 
frequently.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The operation at Thailand's only elephant hospital in Lampang,  
320 miles north of the capital Bangkok, involved cutting away about 
a foot of Motola's foreleg. 
</P>
<P>
	Motola stepped on a land mine nearly two weeks ago as she  
foraged for food during a break from hauling logs on the 
Myanmar-Thai border -- the site of a half-century of insurgencies. 
</P>
<P>
	Her wounds were the worst ever seen at the Lampang hospital,  
which treats elephants for everything from snake bites to broken 
limbs. 
</P>
<P>
	Before the operation, the medical team rated Motola's chances of  
survival at 50 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Over the past week, millions of Thais have tuned in for regular  
updates on her condition, broadcast on national television. Public 
donations to pay for the treatment have topped $105,000. 
</P>
<P>
	Motola was given enough anesthetic to knock out 70 humans for  
the complex operation, which was done by five surgeons. The beast 
was maneuvered in a huge sling held by a crane. 
</P>
<P>
	She woke up late Saturday, several hours after the medical team  
had finished their work in an open-air operating room set up in the 
hospital compound. 
</P>
<P>
	On Sunday morning she ate a breakfast of bananas, peeled and  
hand-fed to her by hospital staff. She was then hoisted onto her 
feet for a short while to aid circulation and ease pressure on her 
internal organs. 
</P>
<P>
	Propping herself up on a metal pole with her two small tusks,  
Motola managed to stand briefly on her own feet by the afternoon. 
Her wound started to bleed as a result, but surgeons said it gave 
no cause for alarm. 
</P>
<P>
	The medical team expects she will need mechanical support for at  
least two weeks. Vets are set to clean her 20-stitch wound, that is 
wrapped in skin saved from her foreleg, every day. 
</P>

	Then they plan to fit a brace to her leg to help her stand up  
alone. When the wound is healed and the shape of her leg is clear, 
medics will consider fitting a prosthetic.

<HEADLINE> Cop Dilemma: Disposing of Old Guns </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SEATTLE (AP) -- With nearly 600 old Smith &AMP; Wesson service  
revolvers they no longer need, Seattle police face a quandary. 
</P>
<P>
	They can sell the .38-caliber handguns to licensed dealers and  
hope they don't end up in the hands of killers or thieves, or 
destroy them and shrug off the loss of thousands of dollars of 
taxpayers' money. 
</P>
<P>
	Given those options, the revolvers have remained locked in  
storage since 1994. 
</P>
<P>
	It's a familiar dilemma to police nationwide, and one that has  
come under scrutiny following an Aug. 10 shooting spree in Los 
Angeles. Authorities say the gun Buford O. Furrow Jr. allegedly 
used to kill a postal worker after spraying a Jewish community 
center with gunfire was traced to the police department in 
Cosmopolis, Wash. 
</P>
<P>
	Gary Eisenhower, chief of the five-member Cosmopolis police  
force, was sickened to learn of the connection. But he said his 
department cannot afford to destroy old service weapons that can 
bring the department hundreds of dollars each. 
</P>
<P>
	Eisenhower had traded the Glock semiautomatic pistol to a store  
for a new service weapon, a common industry practice that saves 
money but also floods the secondhand market with relatively cheap 
firearms. 
</P>
<P>
	Government data obtained by The Wall Street Journal showed at  
least 1,100 former police guns were among the 193,203 guns used in 
crimes and traced last year by the federal Bureau of Alcohol, 
Tobacco and Firearms. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think the last thing the everyday citizen wants to know is  
that the police department is recirculating guns and selling them 
to the general public,'' said Pamela Eakes, founder of Mothers 
Against Violence in America, based in suburban Seattle. 
</P>
<P>
	``If you couldn't sell them to another police department or  
sheriff's department, then I think the only alternative is to melt 
them down,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	Gun rights advocates counter that police guns accounted for less  
than 1 percent of guns used in crimes last year. 
</P>
<P>
	And some advocates complain that cities suing the gun industry  
for allegedly failing to control the distribution of firearms -- 
including New Orleans, Chicago and Detroit -- have themselves 
contributed to the number of guns on the street via police 
trade-ins. 
</P>
<P>
	``New Orleans has probably sold more guns back through the chain  
than any city in the country,'' said Alan Gottlieb, chairman of the 
Bellevue, Wash.-based Citizens Committee for the Right to Keep and 
Bear Arms. ``The bottom line is the exact thing they're charging 
the manufacturers with you could charge them with.'' 
</P>
<P>
	New Orleans police acknowledged in January that they agreed to  
trade almost 10,000 confiscated and used weapons to Glock Inc. in a 
deal for new weapons. 
</P>
<P>
	City officials said the deal stipulated that the guns were not  
to be sold in Louisiana and the transaction netted the department a 
credit of more than $400,000 toward $772,000 in new guns. 
</P>
<P>
	Other examples of the practice:  
</P>
<P>
	--In Detroit, Police Chief Benny Napoleon acknowledged some of  
the 7,000 guns sold by his department to a wholesaler may have 
ended up in the city's gun shops. The sales between 1992 and 1997 
earned about $800,000 toward the purchase of new weapons for the 
4,000-member department, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	--The sheriff's department in Jefferson County, Colo., the agency  
investigating the Columbine High School massacre, sold more than 
100 of its own guns to a gun store in 1995 and used the money to 
buy weapons for a SWAT team. 
</P>
<P>
	--In Boston, police Commissioner Paul Evans said guns the  
department recently traded in for new Glock pistols were resold in 
the United States -- a violation of city policy that only allows the 
wholesaler to sell the guns overseas. 
</P>
<P>
	Ken Jorgensen, spokesman for Massachusetts-based Smith &AMP; Wesson,  
said police trade-ins have slowed due to the recent public 
attention. 
</P>
<P>
	Glock hasn't noticed a slowdown, yet, said Paul Jannuzzo, vice  
president and general counsel for the gunmaker. 
</P>
<P>
	Glock may trade 25,000 guns to police agencies in ``a really  
good year,'' Jannuzzo said. But eliminating those police-issued 
guns from the secondhand market won't quell strong consumer demand 
for firearms, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Larry Todd, chief of police in the Silicon Valley cities of Los  
Gatos, Calif., and Monte Sereno, Calif., said police leaders are 
realizing the consequences of the trade-in practices, which caught 
on in the 1980s as law enforcers switched from revolvers to 
semiautomatic handguns. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1995, Todd and fellow members of the California Police Chiefs  
Association approved a resolution recommending that police agencies 
destroy all their unnecessary guns -- police-issue or confiscated. 
</P>
<P>
	The International Association of Chiefs of Police endorsed the  
concept last October after concluding the costs of gun violence far 
outweigh the cost of throwing guns away, Todd said. 
</P>
<P>
	``I take the philosophical position that we as public servants  
ought not to be introducing weapons of any kind into society,'' he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Officials in Seattle, which passed an ordinance in the early  
1990s prohibiting police from offering guns to the public, agree. 
</P>
<P>
	``It just seems to me it's a small price to pay to keep these  
guns out of circulation,'' City Councilwoman Margaret Pageler said.

<HEADLINE>  Elephant Land Mine Victim Recovers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LAMPANG, Thailand (AP) -- She's still too weak to use her trunk  
to eat, but Motola, the elephant that lost part of her foot to a 
land mine, was on her way to recovery Sunday after a lengthy 
operation. 
</P>
<P>
	Surgeons worked for three hours to cut away dead flesh and  
shattered bones from her front left foot on Saturday. On Sunday, 
doctors said they were pleased with her progress, giving hope the 
38-year old pachyderm will one day walk again. 
</P>
<P>
	``She's improving,'' said Suwichai Rojanasathen, an expert from  
Chiang Mai University in northern Thailand. ``What we need to make 
sure of now is that she eats well and the wound is cleaned 
frequently.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The operation at Thailand's only elephant hospital in Lampang,  
320 miles north of the capital Bangkok, involved cutting away about 
a foot of Motola's foreleg. 
</P>
<P>
	Motola stepped on a land mine nearly two weeks ago as she  
foraged for food during a break from hauling logs on the 
Myanmar-Thai border -- the site of a half-century of insurgencies. 
</P>
<P>
	Her wounds were the worst ever seen at the Lampang hospital,  
which treats elephants for everything from snake bites to broken 
limbs. 
</P>
<P>
	Before the operation, the medical team rated Motola's chances of  
survival at 50 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Over the past week, millions of Thais have tuned in for regular  
updates on her condition, broadcast on national television. Public 
donations to pay for the treatment have topped $105,000. 
</P>
<P>
	Motola was given enough anesthetic to knock out 70 humans for  
the complex operation, which was done by five surgeons. The beast 
was maneuvered in a huge sling held by a crane. 
</P>
<P>
	She woke up late Saturday, several hours after the medical team  
had finished their work in an open-air operating room set up in the 
hospital compound. 
</P>
<P>
	On Sunday morning she ate a breakfast of bananas, peeled and  
hand-fed to her by hospital staff. She was then hoisted onto her 
feet for a short while to aid circulation and ease pressure on her 
internal organs. 
</P>
<P>
	Propping herself up on a metal pole with her two small tusks,  
Motola managed to stand briefly on her own feet by the afternoon. 
Her wound started to bleed as a result, but surgeons said it gave 
no cause for alarm. 
</P>
<P>
	The medical team expects she will need mechanical support for at  
least two weeks. Vets are set to clean her 20-stitch wound, that is 
wrapped in skin saved from her foreleg, every day. 
</P>
<P>
	Then they plan to fit a brace to her leg to help her stand up  
alone. When the wound is healed and the shape of her leg is clear, 
medics will consider fitting a prosthetic.

<HEADLINE> Johnson, Greene Anchor U.S. Wins </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SEVILLE, Spain (AP) -- Golden Boys Michael Johnson and Maurice  
Greene put their special golden touches on the final day of the 
World Championships. 
</P>
<P>
	Each anchored a winning United States relay Sunday and entered  
their names prominently in the championships' record book. 
</P>
<P>
	The businesslike Johnson, winner of his fourth straight  
400-meter title earlier in world record time, ran a sizzling leg in 
bringing the U.S. 1,600-meter relay team home in 2:56.45, the 
year's fastest time and the seventh-best ever. It was the 
Americans' third consecutive title, each relay anchored by Johnson. 
</P>
<P>
	Johnson, who also owns two 200 titles, now has nine gold medals  
at the World Championships, the most by any athlete -- one more than 
Carl Lewis. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's an honor,'' Johnson, timed in 43.50, said of breaking  
Lewis' record. ``It's a testament to what I've tried to do in my 
career: to be consistent, and go into every championships on the 
top of my game and go in to win.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Jerome Davis gave the Americans the lead from the outset, then  
Antonio Pettigrew, Angelo Taylor and Johnson continued to widen the 
advantage as the Americans beat runner-up Poland by nearly 2 1/2 
seconds before a capacity crowd of more than 50,000. 
</P>
<P>
	The enthusiastic Greene, the 100 and 200 champion, overcame  
Britain's Dwain Chambers on the final leg of the 400 relay with a 
sensational 9.12 effort, carrying the Americans to victory at 
37.59, the fastest time in the world this year and the fifth-best 
ever. 
</P>
<P>
	``A guy of that caliber with that kind of heart, all you have to  
do is keep him within striking distance,'' U.S. men's team coach 
George Williams said. ``He just believes in himself.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Americans' victory was retribution for failing to get  
through the first rounds at the past two championships because of 
dropped batons, and they celebrated accordingly. 
</P>
<P>
	As Greene crossed the finish line, he raised his left hand  
signifying No. 1 and flailed his tongue in typical Michael Jordan 
fashion. He then jumped into the arms of leadoff runner Jon 
Drummond, who was wearing leopard-spotted spikes. 
</P>
<P>
	Then, Greene and Drummond knelt on the track in prayer, as did  
Tim Montgomery and Brian Lewis. That was followed by the four 
teammates stripping to the waist and posing in bodybuilding 
stances, flexing their muscles, before taking their victory laps 
with American flags draped over them. 
</P>
<P>
	Later, after the victory ceremony, Drummond, Lewis and  
Montgomery lifted Greene onto their shoulders, and two of them gave 
him their gold medals so he could pose for pictures with three 
golds. 
</P>
<P>
	``That's three, baby,'' the smiling Greene said, while holding  
up three fingers. 
</P>
<P>
	The three golds enabled Greene to tie Lewis and East Germany's  
Marita Koch for the most in one championships. Lewis did it twice, 
in 1983 and 1987. 
</P>
<P>
	``I want to take what Carl Lewis did a step farther,'' Greene  
said. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've always believed I was one of the best athletes in the  
world. If you say I'm the man of this meet or one of the top 
athletes in track and field, I'll love it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Unlike in the past, the Americans' 400 relay handoffs were sure  
and swift, and although Greene trailed Chambers slightly at the 
start of the anchor, he was able to power down the final straight 
and overtake the young Brit. 
</P>
<P>
	``We had a great relay team and the bottom line is that we knew  
if passed the stick around we would win,'' Greene said. 
</P>
<P>
	The two women's relays also were run in world-leading times.  
</P>
<P>
	The biggest surprise was the Bahamas' victory in the 400 as the  
favored U.S. team finished fourth, behind France and Jamaica. 
</P>
<P>
	The Americans appeared doomed from the outset when their first  
two runners, Cheryl Taplin and Nanceen Perry, left them trailing 
badly. Inger Miller, the 200 champion, got them back into 
contention with a solid third leg, but Gail Devers, the 100 hurdles 
champion, who started in second place, was passed by France's 
Christine Arron and Jamaica's Peta-Gaye Dowdie. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, the Bahamas' team of Sevatheda Fynes, Chandra  
Sturrup, Pauline Davis and Debbie Ferguson provided the country's 
first gold of the championships, running 41.92. 
</P>
<P>
	In the women's 1,600 relay, the Russian team of Tatyana  
Chebykina, Svetlana Goncharnko, Olga Kotlyarova and Natalya 
Nazarova won at 3:21.98, as the Americans' chance for victory 
vanished when German anchor Grit Breuer clipped the heels of Jearl 
Miles-Clark as she was making a run at Nazarova in the stretch. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think (the Americans) would have won if they hadn't been hit  
by Germany with 70 meters to go,'' said Craig Masback, head of USA 
Track and Field. ``The women did not consider it to be deliberate. 
The Germans apologized. And that's the way it goes sometimes.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Americans settled for the silver at 3:22.09, and finished  
the championships with leading totals of 17 medals -- their fewest 
ever -- and 11 golds. Russia was second with 13 medals, six golds, 
and Germany third with 12 medals, four golds. 
</P>
<P>
	The men's 800 produced one of the closest finishes of the  
championships, as Kenyan-born Wilson Kipketer of Denmark edged 
South Africa's Hezekiel Sepeng by .02 seconds at 1:43.30 for his 
third title in a row. 
</P>
<P>
	``I didn't know if I had won until I saw it on the giant stadium  
screen,'' Kipketer, the world record-holder, said after capping his 
comeback from malaria a year ago. 
</P>
<P>
	The women's 1,500 turned into a rough-and-tumble race, before  
Russia's Svetlana Masterkova, the 1996 Olympic gold medalist, 
emerged with her second straight title with a season's best 
3:59.53. 
</P>
<P>
	American Regina Jacobs, the runner-up with a career-best  
4:00.35, was roughed up twice in the final 250 meters, losing her 
chance for victory. 
</P>
<P>
	``Second again!'' Jacobs said.

<HEADLINE> Almanac Predicts Snowy End to 1999 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LEWISTON, Maine (AP) -- Parts of the country have another Y2K  
problem to worry about: a powerful storm in the last days of 1999. 
</P>
<P>
	So says the Farmers' Almanac, which predicts a stormy November  
and December, capped by a weather system packing more than a foot 
of snow in the last week of the year for the Midwest and Northeast. 
</P>
<P>
	But the clouds should part by the time champagne corks pop, said  
Sondra Duncan, the almanac's managing editor. This year's edition 
is due out Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's going to be cold and there will be snow on the ground,  
but the New Year's Eve festivities, which will be quite elaborate 
this year, should be OK,'' Duncan assured. 
</P>
<P>
	The National Weather Service harrumphs that the weather can't be  
predicted with any certainty so far in advance. 
</P>
<P>
	But the 183-year-old Farmers' Almanac claims its weather  
predictions are right 80 percent of the time. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're older than the National Weather Service, and we  
affectionately call the National Weather Service a 'non-prophet,''' 
editor Peter Geiger said. 
</P>
<P>
	The Farmers' Almanac, not to be confused with the Old Farmer's  
Almanac in neighboring New Hampshire, which is 24 years older, 
bases its weather forecast on a secret formula that involves 
sunspots, position of the planets and tidal action caused by the 
moon. 
</P>
<P>
	Geiger said the almanac correctly forecast last year's monster  
storm that dumped nearly 22 inches on Chicago. He also said a 
prediction for a major storm in New England in mid January was 
fulfilled when a foot-and-a-half of snow fell in western 
Massachusetts. 
</P>
<P>
	The good news this winter is that things will be milder after a  
November and December ``that will be unusually stormy and active 
across much of the country,'' the almanac says. 
</P>
<P>
	Colorado, whose ski resorts were hurt by a lack of snow last  
year, will see four major storms between November and year's end, 
and may see a white Christmas, the almanac says, according to the 
book. And the Northeast will be pounded by three significant 
snowstorms in December, it says. 
</P>
<P>
	``Once we get these early storms out of the way, the rest of the  
winter should seem tame by comparison,'' wrote Caleb Weatherbee, 
the almanac's chief weather prognosticator.

<HEADLINE> Scientist: Planet Hurt by Cold War </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MOSCOW (AP) -- On the 50th anniversary of the first Soviet atomic  
test, a prominent Russian scientist said Sunday that the arms race 
had left behind massive environmental damage that would take 
generations to repair. 
</P>
<P>
	Soviet researchers carried out their first experimental blast on  
Aug. 29, 1949, near the Semipalatinsk testing ground in what is now 
part of northern Kazakstan. 
</P>
<P>
	The Cold War arms race ``has created environmental problems with  
which future generations will have to contend,'' said Alexei 
Yablokov, a member of the Russian Academy of Sciences and a former 
adviser to President Boris Yeltsin, now one of the country's 
leading anti-nuclear campaigners. 
</P>
<P>
	``If the enormous human and material resources burnt in the  
furnace of the nuclear arms race had been spent on the solution of 
global problems,'' many of them could have been solved, Yablokov 
told the Interfax news agency. 
</P>
<P>
	Soviet citizens living near the Semipalatinsk testing ground  
were exposed to dozens of above-ground tests, and these people and 
their descendants have suffered from extremely high rates of 
cancer, birth defects and other serious illnesses. Ecologists say 
there are several inhabited areas of Semipalatinsk that contain 
radiation levels unsafe for humans. 
</P>
<P>
	Several churches held services in Semipalatinsk on Sunday to  
remember the people who died because of the testing. 
</P>
<P>
	The Soviet Union, which dissolved in 1991, mounted its crash  
program to develop nuclear weapons after the United States used 
atomic bombs against Japan at the end of World War II in 1945. 
</P>
<P>
	President Boris Yeltsin on Thursday praised the Soviet nuclear  
program, saying it had helped preserve world peace. 
</P>
<P>
	``Half a century ago the selfless work of scientists, engineers,  
workers and military men created a strong foundation for Russia's 
nuclear shield,'' Yeltsin said in a message to the builders of the 
first Soviet weapon. 
</P>
<P>
	``That was an event of historic significance, which played an  
extremely important role in maintaining durable peace on the 
planet,'' the message added. 
</P>
<P>
	Nuclear weapons remain an important part of Russia's defenses,  
although many missiles are old and unsafe. 
</P>
<P>
	The United States and Russia have both been reducing their  
arsenals in recent years, and each country now has about 6,000 
strategic nuclear weapons. 
</P>
<P>
	The START II arms control treaty, signed by both countries but  
ratified only by the United States, calls for the countries to cut 
their nuclear arsenals further to 3,000 to 3,500 warheads each.

<HEADLINE> North Korean Wins Women's Marathon </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SEVILLE, Spain (AP) -- Jong Song Ok of North Korea brought her  
country its first medal ever in the World Championships, winning 
the women's marathon gold medal Sunday in 2 hours, 26 minutes, 59 
seconds. 
</P>
<P>
	Ari Ichihashi of Japan -- who wore silver shoes in the race --  
took silver in 2:27:02. The bronze went to Romanian Lidia Simon, in 
2:27:41. 
</P>
<P>
	Jong entered a near-empty stadium and -- without a North Korean  
flag in sight -- waved a white towel to celebrate, then wasted 
little time dedicating the victory. 
</P>
<P>
	``I imagined in my mind the image or our Korean leader, Kim Jong  
Il, and this inspired me today,'' Jong said. ``This was the source 
of my power.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Yes, I am a new marathon runner in the eyes of the rest of the  
world. Hopefully they will know me better in the future.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Jong's previous best was second place in the Pyongyang marathon  
in 1996, and the she was 20th at the Olympics that same year. 
</P>
<P>
	The 25-year-old Jong, a little-known runner from an isolated  
country, broke away from Ichihashi at 25 miles, and looked fresh 
entering Olympic Stadium, where moderate late morning temperatures 
greeted her. 
</P>
<P>
	Defending Olympic champion Fatuma Roba of Ethiopia broke out of  
a pack of 10 to take the lead just past the 19-mile mark and, as 
she pulled steadily away, seemed to have the race won. 
</P>
<P>
	But at 24 miles, the three-time defending Boston Marathon  
champion was surprisingly overtaken by Jong and Ichihashi. She 
finished fourth in 2:28:04. 
</P>
<P>
	After that, it was a foot race with Jong pulling away in the  
final minutes to run a personal best and a national record. Her 
previous best time was 2:29:54. 
</P>
<P>
	Jong's coach, Tae Dong Hak, described his star's tough training  
habits. She runs 22-25 miles and trains in a mountain region in the 
north of North Korea. 
</P>
<P>
	``Don't chase for the first half,'' he told her. ``But at 35  
kilometers, try once to get ahead. If unsuccessful, try to 
challenge at 40 kilometers. After that, if you have enough, escape. 
That tactic succeeded.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The only other North Korean competing in the World Championships  
-- Kim Chang Ok -- was 10th in 2:29:26. 
</P>
<P>
	The winner was also a mystery to silver-medalist Ichihashi.  
</P>
<P>
	``The Korean is a new name to me, and when you don't know an  
athlete, it is difficult to guess what their tactics will be,'' she 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Defending champion Hiromi Suzuki of Japan skipped the race to  
prepare for the Tokyo Marathon in November. 
</P>
<P>
	European champion Manuela Machado of Portugal, who won the 1995  
world marathon and was second in '93 and '97, was seventh in 
2:29:11. 
</P>
<P>
	The heat for the women's race -- with 42 of 51 finishing in the  
mid 70s -- was nothing compared to Saturday's men's marathon, where 
Spain's Abel Anton became the first person to win back-to-back 
marathons in the worlds. Saturday's race began with temperatures of 
97.

<HEADLINE> French Cos. Reportedly Set To Merge </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PARIS (AP) --French supermarket groups Carrefour SA and Promodes  
reportedly have agreed to merge to form the world's second-largest 
retailer, behind Wal-Mart Stores Inc. of the United States. 
</P>
<P>
	The two companies announced Sunday that they would hold a joint  
news conference Monday. The announcement follows a report in French 
daily Le Figro Saturday, citing unnamed sources, that announcement 
of a merger was imminent. 
</P>
<P>
	A Carrefour spokesman, when asked about the market rumors, said  
the company has a policy of not commenting on market speculation. 
</P>
<P>
	The combined operation would have a market capitalization of  
about $49 billion and annual sales of nearly $50 billion. That 
would still be far smaller than Wal-Mart, which had fiscal 1999 
sales of nearly $138 billion. 
</P>
<P>
	Promodes is a leading food retailer in Europe. Carrefour  
operates superstores selling everything from clothing to food to 
car batteries. 
</P>
<P>
	Analysts believe the Carrefour-Promodes union makes more sense  
than the expected entry of foreign competitors to the French retail 
market such as market leader Wal-Mart and Ahold of the Netherlands.

	NEW YORK (AP) -- The Little League champions came to Yankee  
Stadium on Sunday to meet the World Series champions. 
</P>
<P>
	The New York Yankees honored the two finalists from the Little

	Each of the youngsters ran onto the field with a Yankee to take  
their respective positions for the national anthem. 
</P>
<P>
	The young players received T-shirts, caps and other gifts from  
the Yankees, and got to meet some players before the game, 
including David Cone and Hideki Irabu. The teams then watched the 
game in a suite.

<HEADLINE> Ariz. Said Assessing Abortion Appeal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PHOENIX (AP) -- A 14-year-old foster girl who says she was raped  
is reportedly expected to travel to Kansas for a late-term abortion 
unless Arizona officials succeed in winning a court ruling to stop 
her. 
</P>
<P>
	There has been no direct word from the girl because of foster  
care confidentiality requirements and a court seal on the case. 
She's said to be about 24 weeks into the pregnancy now, past the 
stage at which abortions are performed in Arizona. 
</P>
<P>
	The Arizona Republic quoted sources Saturday as saying Gov. Jane  
Hull had changed direction on Thursday about an appeal and had 
decided to have the girl's competency re-evaluated. But a judge on 
Friday reaffirmed his decision to allow the abortion, the newspaper 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	The governor's office was working feverishly late Friday on a  
second appeal, the Republic said. On Saturday, a spokeswoman for 
the governor refused to discuss whether a second appeal would be 
filed. 
</P>
<P>
	The girl, a ward of the state since she was 5 and now a ward of  
Maricopa County Superior Court, told the state she was raped. She 
requested an abortion 14 weeks into the pregnancy but then ran 
away, showing up again only recently. 
</P>
<P>
	Last week, Judge William Sargeant authorized the abortion and  
having the girl taken elsewhere for it.

<HEADLINE> Sosa Hits 54th Homer </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Sammy Sosa of the Chicago Cubs hit his major  
league-leading 54th homer Sunday night, sending a 2-0 pitch from 
Darren Dreifort into the right-field bullpen leading off the 
seventh inning. 
</P>
<P>
	The solo homer, only the third hit allowed by Dreifort, broke a  
scoreless tie and triggered a four-run outburst. 
</P>
<P>
	Los Angeles right fielder Raul Mondesi barely moved as the ball  
soared over his head and traveled an estimated 427 feet. 
</P>
<P>
	Sosa's 54th homer came in the Cubs' 129th game and kept him well  
ahead of last year's pace. Sosa hit his 54th homer in Chicago's 
137th game in 1998 and finished with 66 -- four short of Mark 
McGwire's record. 
</P>
<P>
	McGwire entered Sunday night's game against Atlanta with 51  
homers -- second in the majors. 
</P>
<P>
	The Dodger Stadium crowd cheered Sosa before every at-bat, and  
cheered the loudest after his home run. Sosa, 6-of-12 with one 
homer and five RBIs against Dreifort, singled and walked in his 
first two plate appearances.

<HEADLINE> Debate Persists Over Net Birthday </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Was the Internet born in 1969? It depends on  
whom you ask. 
</P>
<P>
	On Sept. 2 of that year, the first two machines were connected  
to form ARPANET, the network that grew into the Internet. The same 
principles behind that initial connection remain part of the 
foundation of today's Internet. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is the box out of which the magic genie of the Internet  
came,'' said UCLA professor Len Kleinrock, standing next to the 
first ARPANET computer that was connected inside his lab 30 years 
ago. ``This is where it all began.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Vinton Cerf, an Internet pioneer who is now a vice president at  
MCI Worldcom, disagrees, saying the connection was significant but 
not a birth. 
</P>
<P>
	``There were no other people to connect to. It was like being  
the first guy on the block with a telephone but nobody to talk 
to,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	By the early 1970s, the ARPANET consisted of 10 sites scattered  
across the United States. But it connected different computers -- 
not different networks as meant by the word ``Internet.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``It's like saying in 1776, could you imagine Seattle being the  
kind of city it is today,'' said Bob Kahn, president of the 
Corporation for National Research Initiatives. ``It would have been 
hard when it wasn't even part of the United States.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Kahn and Cerf's 1974 proposal of a protocol that would allow  
ARPANET to talk with other networks also could be considered the 
conception of today's Internet. Their protocol, called TCP/IP, 
became the standard on Jan. 1, 1983 -- another possible birthday.

<HEADLINE> Jump in Prescription Sales Expected </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Americans are delving deeper than ever into  
their medicine chests, with nearly 3 billion prescriptions expected 
to be filled this year, according to a pharmacy trade group. 
</P>
<P>
	Consumers will buy an estimated 2.97 billion prescriptions this  
year, 9 percent more than the 2.73 billion they picked up last 
year, the National Association of Chain Drug Stores said in a 
report issued Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	Prescription sales could jump to 4 billion before 2005, said  
Robert W. Hanna, the group's interim president and chief executive. 
</P>
<P>
	Pharmacists, drug makers and consumer groups attribute the rise  
to an aging population, increased advertising and an expanding 
array of medicines that target ``lifestyle'' ailments such as 
insomnia. 
</P>
<P>
	Among new drugs sold this year are American Home Products'  
Sonata sleeping pill, a Glaxo Wellcome influenza fighter called 
Relenza, the Hoffman La Roche fat-blocker Xenical, and Plan B, a 
``morning-after'' anti-pregancy pill to be distributed by the 
Women's Capital Corp. 
</P>
<P>
	Community pharmacies account for 63 percent of prescription drug  
sales in dollar terms -- a projected $76.6 billion this year. 
Prescription drugs also are sold at nursing homes, hospitals, 
prisons and via mail order. 
</P>
<P>
	``We've been absolutely deluged,'' said Lowell McNichol, who  
mans the Safeway drug counter in Petaluma, Calif. ``We have drugs 
available now for things we couldn't treat five, 10, 15 years ago. 
So we use them.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Among the fastest-selling new drugs are so-called cox-2  
inhibitors, a new class of painkillers often referred to as 
``super-aspirins.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Antidepressants are among the top-selling drugs, with 17 percent  
more prescriptions this June than in June 1998, according to NDC 
Health Information Services, which tracks drug sales. Nearly one 
out of every three anti-depressants sold is Eli Lilly &AMP; Co.'s 
Prozac, one of the oldest drugs of its class. 
</P>
<P>
	The increase in prescriptions continues a long-term trend.  
Americans bought 2 billion prescriptions in 1992 and 2.6 billion in 
1997, an increase of about 30 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	But Americans spent 64 percent more on drugs in 1997 than in  
1993, according to IMS Health, a Plymouth Meeting, Pa.-based 
industry research company that helped formulate the 1999 estimates.

<HEADLINE> Ex-NFL Player Jaime Fields Killed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DOWNEY, Calif. (AP) -- Former NFL linebacker Jaime Fields was  
killed in a car accident Sunday by a motorist who ran a red light 
then fled by foot, police said. 
</P>
<P>
	Fields, 29, who played for the Kansas City Chiefs, was driving  
alone in his 1991 BMW 13 miles southeast of downtown Los Angeles 
when the accident occurred at about 2:20 a.m., Sgt. Pete Novakoff 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	The driver of a Ford Taurus ran a red light and slammed into the  
driver's side of Fields' car. Fields was pronounced dead at the 
scene, Novakoff said. 
</P>
<P>
	The other driver ``got out of his car, started yelling  
something,'' then fled on foot, Novakoff said. 
</P>
<P>
	Police continued the search for the suspect, he said.  
</P>
<P>
	Fields played for the University of Washington and was drafted  
in the fourth round by the Kansas City Chiefs in 1993. He played 
for the Chiefs until 1995. 
</P>
<P>
	He had homes in Downey and nearby Carson since his retirement  
from the NFL, Novakoff said.

<HEADLINE> Bears' Opening Day QB a Mystery </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- Who will be the Chicago Bears' opening day  
quarterback? The mystery remains. 
</P>
<P>
	After a 35-24 loss at Cleveland on Saturday night that wrapped  
up the Bears' exhibition season at 2-2, coach Dick Jauron said the 
decision between Shane Matthews and rookie Cade McNown will be made 
in time. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't think you have to make the decision too quickly,'' he  
said. ``I don't want to show our hand too quickly.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Jauron has nearly two weeks to make up his mind and would like  
the Kansas City Chiefs, Chicago's season-opening opponent on Sept. 
12, to practice for both quarterbacks. But his choice will probably 
be made this week so the players can prepare. 
</P>
<P>
	``You want to get the timing down,'' wide receiver Curtis Conway  
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Matthews started against the Browns and completed 11 of 13  
passes for 66 yards and a touchdown. McNown played with the second 
unit and was 4-of-10 for 42 yards and one TD. 
</P>
<P>
	``I felt Shane played well and Cade played well,'' Jauron said.  
``One (McNown) is more mobile than the other and one (Matthews) 
right now is just more experienced.'' 
</P>
<P>
	McNown, a first-round draft pick projected to be the starter in  
the near future, said it doesn't matter to him who starts the 
season. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's a lot of time to go and it's not a big concern with me  
right now,'' he said. ``My concern is just to make strides and I 
felt I made strides (in the preseason).''

<HEADLINE> Cause Sought in Deadly N.J. Ride </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	OCEAN CITY, N.J. (AP) -- Mark Matczak and his two young children  
were waiting to board the Wild Wonder roller coaster when a car 
that had started out on its ride suddenly reversed course. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was like, `Oh, my God, it's coming back down,''' said  
Matczak, 39, of Tylersport, Pa. ``As quickly as I said that, it 
hit.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The accident killed two people Saturday night -- a 39-year-old  
woman and her 8-year-old daughter. Jay Gillian, general manager of 
the amusement pier where the accident happened, said the victims 
were riding in the car that slipped backward and crashed into 
another car being loaded to begin the ride. 
</P>
<P>
	The victims were ejected as the backward-rolling car rounded a  
corner near where the next car was loading, according to William 
Connolly, director of the state Division of Codes and Standards. 
Two people who were getting into the second car suffered minor 
injuries. 
</P>
<P>
	The accident was the latest in several fatal mishaps this summer  
at amusement parks across the nation. 
</P>
<P>
	``This season has been quite saddening in that regard, and it's  
certainly not normal,'' said Joel Cliff, spokesman for the 
International Association of Amusement Parks and Attractions. 
</P>
<P>
	Officials would not speculate on what may have caused Saturday's  
accident. Representatives of the manufacturer, the Zamperla Co. of 
Parsippany, were summoned to the park Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	Saturday's accident brought the total of deaths in the last week  
alone to four, while Cliff said the average number of amusement 
park deaths over the past two decades has been two per year. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't have a sense as to what's causing more accidents this  
year. I think it's just a set of coincidences. I think the industry 
is fundamentally as safe as it's ever been,'' Cliff said. 
</P>
<P>
	A week ago, a disabled 12-year-old boy died on the Drop Zone  
ride at Great America park in Santa Clara, Calif., when he slipped 
out of a harness. A day later, a man who had partially wiggled out 
of a shoulder harness fell from the Shockwave, a stand-up roller 
coaster at Paramount's Kings Dominion in Doswell, Va. 
</P>
<P>
	On Wednesday, a coaster at Six Flags Marine World in Vallejo,  
Calif., came to a sudden halt and stranded 28 people for nearly 
four hours. 
</P>
<P>
	New Jersey safety investigators spent Sunday inspecting the  
brand new, two-story steel coaster involved in Saturday's accident, 
crawling beneath the cars and the tracks. 
</P>
<P>
	The boardwalk park where the ride is located, Gillian's  
Wonderland Pier, was closed out of respect for the victims and 
their families, park officials said. 
</P>
<P>
	The Wild Wonder, which opened July 1, was inspected once before  
opening and once since by the state, according to E.J. Miranda, a 
spokeswoman for the state Department of Community Affairs, which 
regulates New Jersey amusement rides. 
</P>
<P>
	Its inaugural runs were attended by Gov. Christie Whitman, who  
pressed a button to start the ride, but balked at trying it 
herself. She said she was afraid of roller coasters. 
</P>
<P>
	New Jersey cracked down on amusement ride operators after a  
spate of accidents in 1997, boosting the maximum penalty for a 
safety violation from $500 to $5,000 and making it a crime for 
riders who ignore rules or fool around on rides. 
</P>
<P>
	The number of serious incidents dropped last summer, from 25 in  
1997 to 16 last year at the state's 1,400 rides. Saturday's deaths 
were the first deaths this year on New Jersey amusement rides. 
Eight people have been seriously injured in ride accidents, 
however. 
</P>
<P>
	Amusement ride patrons were leery after the accident.  
</P>
<P>
	``You always think you're locked in and secure, but then you  
hear about something like this and you go `Wow,''' said Gianna 
Demedio, 10, of Harleysville, Pa., who has ridden the Wild Wonder.

<HEADLINE> Publix Recalls Tainted Ground Beef </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ATLANTA (AP) -- Publix Super Markets Inc. has removed cases of  
ground beef from some of its stores after federal inspectors found 
potentially deadly E. coli bacteria in an Aug. 23 shipment, 
officials said Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	No illnesses have been reported, and it was not immediately  
clear how many stores were affected or how much ground beef was 
shipped. Calls to the company rang unanswered Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	The bacteria was discovered during a routine sampling of the  
meat in a suburban Atlanta store, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
	Georgia Commissioner of Agriculture Tommy Irvin said state and  
federal inspectors were trying to determine where the tainted beef 
originated. The Publix recall was voluntary, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	E. coli can cause serious illness and sometimes death. Symptoms  
include cramps and bloody diarrhea.

<HEADLINE> Union Recommends New Boeing Deal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SEATTLE (AP) -- The Machinists union is urging its 44,000 Boeing  
Co. workers to accept the company's new contract offer, which one 
union official called the best in the aerospace industry. 
</P>
<P>
	After months of strike threats, Boeing officials relented on two  
of the most contentious issues -- job security and a company plan to 
end overtime pay for weekend work. 
</P>
<P>
	``We believe this contract is the best contract in the aerospace  
industry,'' Bill Johnson, president of Machinists District Lodge 
751, told union members Saturday morning. Though he added, ``I wish 
we could have negotiated better language on job security.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Fellow union members who stopped by the Seattle headquarters to  
read the 44-month contract offer were reacting positively, said Tom 
Lux, who was handing out summaries. He predicted it would pass. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is great! All of it!'' declared Robert MacDuff, 53, a  
Boeing worker from Lakewood. 
</P>
<P>
	Weekend work was ``a strike issue,'' he said. ``If they had gone  
to that, this company would have been shut down.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The proposal keeps the traditional work week, meaning workers  
would continue to be paid overtime for working on weekends; it has 
no increase in worker fees for medical benefits; and it includes a 
25 percent increase in pension benefits, a 10 percent signing bonus 
and annual wage increases of 4 percent, 4 percent and 3 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	It also allows review by union member of proposals to contract  
work to outside companies. The company, however, retains the right 
to decide when to contract out work. 
</P>
<P>
	The workers will decide if they agree with Johnson on Wednesday  
-- the day their current contract expires. A majority vote in favor 
would ratify the contract. A two-thirds majority would be required 
in a separate vote to authorize a strike. 
</P>
<P>
	Many union members, like Cliff Standfill, a 20-year Boeing  
employee in Renton, Wash., said job security was the most important 
issue. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's not a money issue,'' Standfill said. ``It never has  
been.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Johnson said the company promised that no employees would be  
laid off because of contracting out work. The company's offer also 
would provide 180 days' notice when work is to be contracted out 
and establish a joint committee to review such proposals, but the 
company would still make the final decision, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	The proposal summary said the no-layoff promise does not apply  
to offsets, a practice of assigning jobs to workers chosen by 
airplane customers, such as China. 
</P>
<P>
	Johnson praised Boeing Chairman Phil Condit as a ``visionary''  
who understands union members. 
</P>
<P>
	``We've got a whole bunch we've got to do,'' Condit said  
Saturday as he shook hands with Johnson at a news conference. ``If 
we work together, we can make this place tremendously competitive, 
and that's what we're after.'' 
</P>
<P>
	During the negotiations, Condit said cost was the bottom line  
for Boeing, the world's largest aerospace company, and he 
emphasized the company's competition from European rival Airbus 
Industrie. 
</P>
<P>
	Boeing is undertaking a massive job cut program to reduce its  
work force from a high of 238,000 in June 1998 to between 185,000 
and 195,000 by the end of next year. The Seattle-based company 
currently employs about 206,000 worldwide. 
</P>
<P>
	``We've done our best, and I think we've delivered an agreement  
that our employees ... will at the end of the day find very, very 
attractive,'' Boeing lead negotiator Jerry Calhoun said. 
</P>
<P>
	The Machinists struck Boeing in two of their last three  
negotiations, including a 69-day strike in 1995. Boeing workers in 
Seattle, Portland, Ore., and Wichita, Kan., had voted informally in 
July to support another strike if negotiations failed. 
</P>
<P>
	The current contract covers 31,000 workers in Washington state,

<HEADLINE> Striped Bass Are Back </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The fish guts covering the rocks along a  
secluded stretch of the Potomac River are a gruesome tribute to the 
return of the striped bass. 
</P>
<P>
	During the spring spawning run, poachers came by the hundreds to  
catch, clean and steal away with the prized stripers, known as 
rockfish in the Chesapeake Bay region. Washington Harbor Police 
Officer Dennis Hance worked himself ragged trying to catch the 
illegal fishermen, and even charged two men with having 138 striped 
bass. 
</P>
<P>
	``They were stuffing them in coolers, in bags; they had 'em  
hidden all over the boat,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Hance hates poachers but says there is good news behind all the  
arrests: ``The rockfish have come back.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Up and down the Atlantic Coast -- from the Potomac to the Hudson  
River, Chesapeake Bay to Narragansett Bay -- striped bass have 
returned in unprecedented numbers since the mid-1980s, when 
overfishing had plunged their populations to record lows. 
</P>
<P>
	For fisheries experts who have seen cod, swordfish, tuna and  
virtually every desirable fish species decline, striped bass are 
the only success story. For recreational fishermen, who dream about 
striped bass and watch videos such as ``Striper Magic,'' it's never 
been better. 
</P>
<P>
	``Years ago, if somebody caught a 5-pound striper up here,  
people would come running to see it,'' said Dan Ward, who has sold 
bait and rented boats at Fletcher's Boathouse on the Potomac since 
1969. This spring, fishermen hauled 15-pounders out of the water 
near Fletcher's. 
</P>
<P>
	Weekend fishermen who went years without any striped bass --  
prized because of their size, fight and taste -- have been renting 
charter boats, skipping out of work early and dusting off their 
rods. Bait and tackle shops say business is booming. 
</P>
<P>
	``There are so many rockfish in Chesapeake Bay. The fishing has  
been great,'' said Kitty Raver, who runs a charter boat out of 
Deltaville, Va., with her husband. 
</P>
<P>
	The striper boom has created some hot fishing spots in unlikely  
places. 
</P>
<P>
	``The Statue of Liberty is one of the best spots in New York  
Harbor,'' Manhattan charter boat captain Tony DiLernia said. 
</P>
<P>
	Businessmen in suits come to his boat after work, change into  
fishing clothes and reel in 25-pound stripers from beneath the 
Brooklyn Bridge. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a shock to some people. They say, `My God, what is this  
beautiful creature doing here?''' DiLernia said. 
</P>
<P>
	Striped bass can grow as large as 60 or 70 pounds; several  
125-pounders were landed in North Carolina in 1891. They are a 
weekend angler's dream because they hug the coastline, making them 
easy to catch from shore. They range from northern Florida to Nova 
Scotia. 
</P>
<P>
	The hardy anadromous fish (they live in fresh and salt water)  
have even been introduced in numerous inland lakes and to the 
Pacific Coast, where they can now be found from Mexico to Canada. 
</P>
<P>
	Chesapeake Bay is the nursery for the Atlantic. Most Atlantic  
striped bass spawn in the Chesapeake's tributaries, such as the 
Potomac, then swim up the coast in search of migrating schools of 
menhaden and other bait fish before returning south to spend their 
winters in warmer waters. 
</P>
<P>
	In the 1970s, the striped bass population was robust:  
Recreational fishermen filled their freezers and commercial 
fishermen netted large schools, taking even the fish that were too 
young to spawn. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1973, nearly 15 million pounds of striped bass were harvested  
commercially, according to a Marine Fisheries report. ``It seemed 
like they were endless,'' said Dick Schaefer of the National Marine 
Fisheries Service. 
</P>
<P>
	But by 1983, the commercial catch had dropped to less than 3  
million pounds. The recreational catch also dropped dramatically. 
</P>
<P>
	``I remember as a kid watching my father reel in enormous  
stripers in Narragansett Bay in the '70s, but by the time I was old 
enough to fish for them myself they were gone,'' said John Torgan, 
spokesman for the Narragansett Bay environmental group Save the 
Bay. 
</P>
<P>
	Because striped bass were so popular among recreational  
fishermen, including many politicians, Congress was able to enact 
the Emergency Striped Bass Study and enact restrictions. 
</P>
<P>
	``The smoking gun was overfishing,'' Schaefer said.  
</P>
<P>
	Despite loud cries from the commercial industry, fishing for  
striped bass was eliminated in federal waters. Maryland took strong 
action by implementing a moratorium on the recreational and 
commercial catch. Other states from Virginia to Maine followed. 
</P>
<P>
	As more fish were allowed to spawn, the stocks rose. The  
four-year moratorium in the Chesapeake was lifted, but this time 
stringent restrictions were left in place. States now have fishing 
seasons, size restrictions and limit people to one ``keeper'' per 
day. 
</P>
<P>
	Today, rockfish are more plentiful in Chesapeake Bay than at any  
time since researchers began assessing the stock 50 years ago. Some 
researchers are even concerned the population may be too large. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a success story. I've been in this business over 40 years  
and this is probably the only major success story I've ever been 
involved in,'' Schaefer said. ``We as a nation have found it very 
difficult to keep a hard line on conservation, but I think that's 
starting to change. People are realizing that the oceans are not 
infinite.''

<HEADLINE> NC State Victory Stuns Texas </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	AUSTIN, Texas (AP) -- Texas can forget about replacing Ricky  
Williams. The Longhorns have to worry about finding punt 
protection. 
</P>
<P>
	Despite a dominating defensive performance that held North  
Carolina State to 172 yards and one offensive score, Texas gave up 
a school-record three blocked punts that led to 16 points in the 
Wolfpack's 23-20 victory Saturday night in the Black Coaches 
Association Classic. 
</P>
<P>
	NC State returned two fourth-quarter blocks by freshman Terrence  
Holt for touchdowns. The Wolfpack could have scored another TD on a 
first-quarter block but three players couldn't pick up the ball 
before it rolled out of the back of the end zone for a safety. 
</P>
<P>
	Changes will be made on Texas' punt team, which had too many  
inexperienced players, coach Mack Brown said. 
</P>
<P>
	``We've got reevaluate what we're doing there and how not to put  
those young guys in those tough spots,'' Brown said. ``We felt like 
we could block one of their punts. We didn't and they did.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Brown thought he solved one problem during the game. Figuring  
junior offensive lineman and long-snapper Marcel Blanchard was 
tiring, Brown replaced him with freshman Hunter McWilliams after 
the second block. McWilliams snapped the ball well on the final 
block but the protection broke down. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's something Stanford will try to exploit next weekend,''  
Brown said. ``We'll probably be nervous about it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A season-opening loss was not what the Texas faithful had  
envisioned after a resurgent 9-3 campaign in 1998. More than 80,000 
packed Royal-Memorial Stadium to watch the continued rebirth of 
their once-dormant program. 
</P>
<P>
	They were stunned when Holt, younger brother of former Wolfpack  
All-America wideout Torry Holt, recorded his second block. Eric 
Leak picked up the loose ball and returned it for the winning 
touchdown with 3:22 to play. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a devastating loss for our kids and our fans and I hate  
it,'' Brown said. ``Thank goodness it's the first game and not the 
last.'' 
</P>
<P>
	For North Carolina State, it was the third early season upset in  
as many years with victories over Syracuse in 1997 and Florida 
State last year. 
</P>
<P>
	Wolfpack players ran onto the field in celebration at the final  
gun. The victory left coach Mike O'Cain beaming about his team's 
rise from consecutive 3-8 seasons in 1995 and 1996. 
</P>
<P>
	``We were almost run out of Raleigh three years ago, and now we  
beat Texas on national TV,'' O'Cain said. 
</P>
<P>
	Offensively, the Wolfpack struggled. After giving up 99 yards in  
the first quarter, Texas' defense clamped down on the NC State 
running backs and quarterback Jamie Barnette. 
</P>
<P>
	The ACC's total offense leader in 1998, Barnette was 9-of-26 for  
65 yards with one interception. It was his worst outing as a 
starter as the offense totaled just seven first downs.. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm so grateful we won. So grateful,'' Barnette said. ``We  
can't play any worse that this on offense, and we still win the 
game.''

<HEADLINE> NEC Invitational Notebook  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	AKRON, Ohio (AP) -- Tommy Bolt won the Rubber City Open in 1954,  
the first time an official PGA Tour event was played at Firestone 
Country Club. One of the seven tournaments Jack Nicklaus won at 
Firestone was the 1975 PGA Championship. 
</P>
<P>
	Despite such history, and a course so highly regarded by the  
players, Firestone may have to go without a tournament in 2001 for 
the first time in a half a century. 
</P>
<P>
	The NEC Invitational, a World Golf Championship event that  
replaced the World Series of Golf, is scheduled to return to 
Firestone in 2000 and 2002. Right now, the only decision for 2001 
is that it will be played in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're looking at four or five'' sites, said PGA Tour  
commissioner Tim Finchem. ``Firestone is one of them. And we'll 
make a decision, I would think, by Thanksgiving.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Why leave Firestone?  
</P>
<P>
	For one thing, Finchem said there are several significant  
markets in North America that don't have PGA Tour-quality golf, and 
``we'd like to bring them something once in a while.'' 
</P>
<P>
	If the NEC Invitational or any other PGA Tour event does not  
return in 2001, Finchem said there would a pro-am or a two-day 
unofficial event so that Akron Golf Charities could continue to 
raise money. 
</P>
<P>
	Several players, particularly past champions, rave about  
Firestone. Nick Price said he would like to see the Match Play 
Championship (La Costa) and the Stroke Play Championship 
(Valderrama) switched around from year to year. 
</P>
<P>
	``Those are the ones that should move around a little bit more,  
or maybe bring one of those here,'' he said. ``But I certainly 
think that one of the World Championship events should be here 
every year.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Tiger Woods had another idea after winning.  
</P>
<P>
	``I'm surprised the USGA doesn't come here for the U.S. Open,''  
he said. ``This is a perfect U.S. Open course -- automatic par 70. 
But they might play 16 (625 yards) as a par-4 from the front tee.'' 
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	 *SPANISH SWOON:* Sergio Garcia has another experience to forget,  
although this wasn't as bad as his 89-83 in the British Open. 
</P>
<P>
	He was at 6 under, in contention for a third-place finish, when  
he tried to stick a 9-iron close to the pin on No. 16. Instead, the 
ball sucked back into the water. He took a drop, but got the same 
result with his lob wedge. 
</P>
<P>
	Garcia took a quadruple-bogey 9 on the hole and finished with a  
72. 
</P>
<P>
	``Sometimes, it happens,'' he said. ``It went the wrong way. You  
have to take it that way. Hopefully, I'll be here next year. Now 
more than before, I want to win this tournament.'' 
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	 *FIRST TEE TO AKRON:* Every time a World Golf Championship event  
is played, The First Tee program grows. 
</P>
<P>
	The First Tee initiative is the primary charity of the WGC  
events, which are sponsored by the five major tours around the 
world. On Sunday, PGA Tour commissioner Tim Finchem announced a 
$500,000 donation to the program, the same amount it received after 
the Match Play Championship in February. 
</P>
<P>
	Finchem said the International Federation of PGA Tours  
``strongly believes in expanding playing opportunities for everyone 
to ensure the continued growth of golf.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He said another substantial donation to First Tee would be made  
after the Stroke Play Championship in Valderrama in November. 
</P>
<P>
	The NEC Invitational will raise an additional $1 million for  
Akron Golf Charities, Inc., which has donated millions of dollars 
to local charities over years of being affiliated with the previous 
World Series of Golf. 
</P>
<P>
	Finchem also said a First Tee program has been created in Akron,  
stemming from a youth program that was started in 1996 and managed 
by the Jaycees a year later. The program has served about 100 kids 
this year. 
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	 *RYDER CUP COMPARISONS:* Most everyone will agree that the U.S.  
Ryder Cup team is much stronger on paper, which means about as much 
as saying the Americans are much better in a 72-hole stroke-play 
event at Firestone Country Club. 
</P>
<P>
	Not only did an American win -- Tiger Woods, the No. 1 player in  
the world -- but the U.S. team finished the NEC Invitational a 
combined 7 under. The worst showing was from the only American 
rookie -- David Duval, who was 6 over. That was still as good or 
better than nine European players. 
</P>
<P>
	Sergio Garcia at 2-under 278 was the only European to finish  
under par. Europe was a combined 73 over in four trips around 
Firestone. 
</P>
<P>
	As for the head-to-head matchups, the U.S. and European players  
were paired together nine times throughout the week. The Americans 
fared better in every match but two -- Garcia over Tom Lehman on 
Sunday, and Paul Lawrie over Payne Stewart in the first round. 
Garcia and Duval matched 70s in their first-round pairing. 
</P>
<P>
	``What does this week mean? That the European team is far  
inferior to the U.S. team,'' Lee Westwood said with a laugh. ``I 
don't think anyone in America will give us a chance.'' 
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	 *AIR VAN DE VELDE:* Maybe the baggage handlers for Air France  
are still upset with Jean Van de Velde for blowing the British 
Open. For the second time in three weeks, the Frenchman came to 
America and his clubs didn't. 
</P>
<P>
	Van de Velde had to spend the day touring Chicago when his clubs  
didn't arrive in time for a practice round before the PGA 
Championship. This time, his clubs didn't get to Akron until 11 
a.m. Wednesday, in time for him to get in a quick practice round. 
</P>
<P>
	``I was not pleased,'' Van de Velde said. ``I might fly home  
with them in the next seat to me. Or I might go in the baggage 
hold.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Maybe he should consider either of those options when he comes  
back over for the next month's Ryder Cup.

<HEADLINE> Metal Cos. Urge Merger Approval </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DENVER (AP) -- Cyprus Amax Minerals Co. and Asarco Inc. are  
urging shareholders to approve a planned merger and to ignore a 
proposal by Phelps Dodge Corp. to acquire both companies in a 
three-way combination. 
</P>
<P>
	``The actions of Phelps Dodge prove what we have been saying  
since they came on the scene two weeks ago,'' Milton H. Ward, 
chairman and chief executive officer of the Englewood-based Cyprus 
Amax, said Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	``We believe that Phelps Dodge is attempting to coerce our  
shareholders into a transaction which delivers the majority of the 
benefits and value to Phelps Dodge and its shareholders.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Cyprus Amax and New York-based Asarco, two of the world's  
leading copper and metals producers, have already agreed to merge 
to form the nation's largest copper company. 
</P>
<P>
	Last week, they rebuffed a $2.7 billion all-stock offer from  
Phoenix -based Phelps Dodge to acquire both in a three-way 
combination. Earlier they confirmed plans for a Sept. 30 closing 
date on their merger. 
</P>
<P>
	In a joint letter sent to Phelps Dodge last week, the two issued  
the terms under which they would be receptive to a Phelps Dodge 
takeover. Primarily, they wanted Phelps Dodge to sweeten the bid by 
$650 million more in stock and take responsibility for any 
antitrust issues that would arise, such as forced divestitures. 
</P>
<P>
	``Phelps Dodge claims they have accepted three of four of our  
negotiating principles,'' Ward said in a joint-statement with 
Francis R. McAllister, chairman and chief executive officer of 
Asarco, Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	``Quite the contrary, they have not even made the effort to  
embody their position in a definitive form of acquisition agreement 
demonstrating their good faith.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ward and McAllister said the Phelps Dodge proposal is subject to  
numerous conditions, chief among them regulatory approval and the 
need to obtain Phelps Dodge stockholder approval ``which cannot be 
secured by Sept. 30.''

<HEADLINE> Storm, Evacuations Thwart Vacations </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	RODANTHE, N.C. (AP) -- Hundreds of cars streamed off Hatteras  
Island on Sunday ahead of Hurricane Dennis after officials issued 
an evacuation order, fearful that people could be trapped if the 
storm made roads impassable. 
</P>
<P>
	The evacuation threw into turmoil vacation plans like those of  
nine people who had planned a week in this Outer Banks village. 
</P>
<P>
	Liz Schramm of Hackettstown, N.J., and her sister Ellen Jahns of  
Richmond, Va., and seven others -- husbands, children and relatives 
-- leaned on their cars in a parking lot as they pondered what to 
do. 
</P>
<P>
	``We can't get there from here,'' Schramm said of the beachfront  
house the family had planned to rent in Rodanthe, the first village 
on Hatteras Island. 
</P>
<P>
	``Now, we're trying to decide if the island is going to be  
closed for more than a day. So, we've got to decide whether to 
drive back to Virginia or find a motel.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The family's vacation was the victim of an evacuation order for  
22,000 residents and visitors on Hatteras and Ocracoke islands 
because of Dennis. State troopers have not set up road blocks on 
the island, so visitors can still drive there despite being unable 
to check into hotels or rented homes. No evacuations were ordered 
for northern beach towns on the Outer Banks. 
</P>
<P>
	Officials were concerned that wind-driven water could wash sand  
over portions of N.C. 12, the only north-south road on the island, 
and trap people trying to flee if Dennis came near. 
</P>
<P>
	Officials estimated as many as 20,000 people on Hatteras,  
including 8,000 permanent residents, and as many as 2,400 on 
Ocracoke, could be in Dennis' way. 
</P>
<P>
	In Rodanthe, rental beach houses were empty, as were parking  
lots at businesses that normally would be booming on the weekend 
before Labor Day weekend, one of the busiest times of the summer. 
</P>
<P>
	While tourists fled the lower Outer Banks, merchant and county  
commissioner Mac Midgett fumed about the evacuation, saying it came 
too soon. The parking lot of his convenience store and restaurant 
were nearly empty, but had been packed a day earlier with surfers 
enjoying waves. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think it's the stupidest thing I've seen,'' said Midgett,  
who was born here in 1940 and has been through scores of storms. 
``I don't want anybody to get hurt, but why don't they start 
(evacuating) at Southern Shore and work south so these people won't 
run into traffic?''

<HEADLINE> Browns' Spielman Ponders Retirement </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BEREA, Ohio (AP) -- Once the feeling returned in Chris Spielman's  
arms and legs, he picked himself up, and though a bit shaky, walked 
off the field under his own power. 
</P>
<P>
	He may soon walk away from the NFL the same way.  
</P>
<P>
	Spielman, the Cleveland Browns' intense middle linebacker  
attempting a comeback from neck fusion surgery in 1997, could 
announce his retirement Monday after getting his second scare of 
the preseason following a violent helmet-on-helmet collision that 
sent him to the hospital during Saturday night's exhibition game. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's exploring all of his options,'' said Browns coach Chris  
Palmer, who spoke to Spielman twice on Sunday. ``He's going to look 
at everything and go from there. What we want to do is sit back 
take a look at things, let things settle down for 24 hours both 
emotionally and physically and then talk about the subject at that 
time.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Palmer wouldn't go so far as to say if he recommended to  
Spielman that 10-year veteran should retire. However, the 
first-year coach intimated all that may be left for Spielman to do 
was announce his career was over. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's some things that have to be ironed out, discussed,  
looked at,'' said Palmer, who was visibly shaken after Saturday's 
game. ``I think once that's all done I think we'll be in pretty 
good shape.'' 
</P>
<P>
	After speaking with Spielman over the phone early Sunday morning  
from the hospital, Palmer said the two visited again at 8 a.m. in 
Palmer's office. 
</P>
<P>
	``We had a good conversation,'' Palmer said. ``It was very  
candid. It was a situation that he expressed some things to me, I 
expressed some things to him that will remain private. That's 
between the coach and the player, and I think we'll have more to 
say on the subject in the next day or so. 
</P>
<P>
	``I wanted a clear mind in the morning to talk to him. I think  
he had a clear mind and came in and talked to me. The fact we 
talked man-to-man and eye-to-eye is real good.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Asked what his gut feeling told him about whether Spielman would  
play again, Palmer said, ``I'll reserve that until tomorrow.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The 33-year-old Spielman sustained a ``stinger'' during the  
Browns' 35-24 win over Chicago when he was blindsided by Bears 
center Casey Wiegmann while trying to cut back on a screen play. 
</P>
<P>
	After shedding and spinning off one blocker, Spielman turned and  
before he could get his feet planted, Wiegmann crushed him. 
</P>
<P>
	Spielman stayed on the ground for several moments, and later  
told Cleveland offensive tackle Lomas Brown, who also played with 
him in Detroit, that he had been momentarily paralyzed. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's scary,'' Brown said. ``I don't want to tell him what to  
do, but I think he should have a long talk with his wife Stefanie 
and think about what he wants to do. Life is more important that 
football.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Wiegmann offered Spielman some assistance after the play.  
</P>
<P>
	``I thought I hit him good, but I didn't think I did that,''  
Wiegmann said. ``He looked me right in the eye, and I was going to 
help him up but he said to me he didn't want to get up.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Spielman had two vertebrae fused in his neck in 1997 while he  
was with the Buffalo Bills. He missed the final eight games that 
season, and was prepared to come back last year. 
</P>
<P>
	But Spielman put his playing career on hold to care for his  
family after his wife underwent breast cancer surgery. The Browns 
signed him to a three-year contract in February, and Spielman 
instantly became the expansion team's most popular player because 
of his Ohio roots as a high school star at Massillon and 
All-America at Ohio State. 
</P>
<P>
	He got a scare in training camp when he was blasted by fullback  
Tarek Saleh, a blow that sent him to the hospital for an MRI. The 
results actually showed Spielman's neck had gotten stronger since 
the surgery, and he was encouraged that he was fine. 
</P>
<P>
	However, Saturday night's scare may have convinced him it's time  
to quit. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's nobody playing this game that's 50 years old,'' Palmer  
said. ``You only have so many blocks, so many tackles in your body 
and the guy upstairs says it's time to sit back and watch somebody 
else play. That happens sometimes when you're 18, sometimes when 
you're 22 or 35. But it happens.'' 
</P>
<P>
	If Spielman's career is over, the Browns are losing more than  
just an inside linebacker, Palmer said. Their losing a player with 
an unparalleled work ethic who leads by example. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's one of a kind,'' Palmer said. ``He's a guy that owes  
everything to football. He's a guy that respects the game, has a 
passion for the game. His family is in football, he probably grew 
up with a football on the kitchen table. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's a guy who some people call an overachiever. I don't know  
if that's true because of the production he has had. If there were 
more guys like that, coaching would be very easy.''

<HEADLINE> Radioactive Ooze Found Outside Plant </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Federal officials confirmed that a radioactive  
black ooze found seeping outside the fence of a Kentucky uranium 
enrichment plant led workers to a burial ground for radioactive 
debris. 
</P>
<P>
	Contract workers chanced upon the material near an unused  
sanitary landfill at the Gaseous Diffusion Plant in Paducah, Ky., 
The Washington Post reported Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	Preparing to install wells to monitor another possible  
contamination site near the landfill, which closed in 1996, the 
workers found the ooze July 15. 
</P>
<P>
	The workers dug beneath a tar-like liquid found in a track left  
by their drilling truck and turned up what appeared to be bits of 
tar paper and asphalt shingles. 
</P>
<P>
	An Energy Department report said ``observations indicated  
possible roofing debris.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Not until three weeks later, after further excavation, did plant  
officials learn the material was contaminated, the newspaper said. 
Radioactivity readings were hundreds of times above levels found 
naturally in soil and almost nine times higher than the plant's 
``action level,'' which would trigger immediate action to seal 
contaminated areas inside the plant. 
</P>
<P>
	Lab tests confirmed the presence of uranium and technetium.  
Technetium, a radioactive metal that travels quickly through soil, 
was brought into the plant inadvertently in the 1950s, '60s and 
'70s in shipments of recycled uranium from government nuclear 
reactors used to produce plutonium. 
</P>
<P>
	Energy Department officials fenced off the site and reported the  
discovery to Kentucky's environmental regulators. 
</P>
<P>
	Both the Department of Energy and the plant's current manager,  
U.S. Enrichment Corp., have contended that they are unaware of 
radioactive waste going into the sanitary landfill. Documents 
prepared by former contractors list the contents of the dump as 
``uncontaminated trash and garbage.'' The landfill is ``permitted 
and operated according to Kentucky regulations,'' according to 
plant records. 
</P>
<P>
	An Energy Department investigation is in the second week at the  
plant, which for 47 years has produced enriched uranium for nuclear 
weapons, Navy submarines and commercial power plants. Reports of 
contamination and sloppy waste management at the plant, including 
worker exposure to plutonium and other highly radioactive 
materials, prompted the investigation.

	BURSA, Turkey (AP) -- The 7.4-magnitude earthquake that hit  
Turkey two weeks ago killed nearly 14,000 people, left thousands 
more missing and up to 600,000 homeless, but across the devastated 
region there were small signs that life was beginning to return to 
normal. State-run TV resumed normal programming today for the first 
time since the quake, showing a movie. Up until then it had

	DILI, Indonesia (AP) -- After four centuries of neglectful  
Portuguese colonial rule and 24 years of military repression under 
Indonesia, East Timorese voters overcame fears of violence and 
intimidation to cast ballots Monday on possible independence. The 
U.N.-supervised referendum began soon after dawn at 200 polling 
centers across the half-island territory. More than 451,000 voters, 
including 13,000 East Timorese living abroad, have registered for 
the ballot.

	WRIGHTSVILLE BEACH, N.C. (AP) -- Hurricane Dennis prompted  
evacuation orders for the fragile Outer Banks barrier islands as it 
moved along the coast toward the Carolinas today. Conditions were 
expected to worsen overnight, but it looked like the brunt of the 
storm might miss land. The hurricane was about 160 miles south of 
the North Carolina coast by the evening, with its top wind revved 
up slightly to 105 mph, and it had edged slightly toward the east.

<HEADLINE> Path of Furrow's Gun </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	The path of a 9 mm Glock Model 26 semiautomatic pistol that  
police say Buford O. Furrow Jr. used to kill a postal worker in 
California: 
</P>
<P>
	--Purchased from Glock Inc. in 1996 by the Cosmopolis, Wash.,  
police department. The gun didn't meet their needs, so department 
officials traded the weapons for a larger Glock of similar value 
from Don's Gun Shop in Cosmopolis. 
</P>
<P>
	--The gun shop's records show the gun was sold to David Wright of  
Aberdeen, Wash. After owning it for two years, Wright asked gun 
collector Andy Palmer to sell it for him at a gun show. 
</P>
<P>
	--The Glock's paper trail ends at the gun show because sales  
between private individuals are unregulated. 
</P>
<P>
	--On Aug. 10, the gun was used to shoot Los Angeles postal worker  
Joseph Santos Ileto nine times. Authorities say Furrow used another 
weapon in a shooting rampage that injured five at a Jewish 
community center.

<HEADLINE> Quiz Show Guest Gains in Return </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- The North Carolina graduate student who was  
mistakenly told he gave the wrong answer on a television quiz show 
increased his winnings in a return visit Sunday but backed out 
before answering a $250,000 question. 
</P>
<P>
	David Honea got his first question right as he continued an  
earlier run on ``Who Wants to Be a Millionaire,'' but declined to 
answer the second, deciding instead to pocket the $125,000 he'd 
already won. He was three correct answers from winning a million 
dollars. 
</P>
<P>
	Host Regis Philbin told Honea on Aug. 19's show that he was  
wrong when he said Lake Huron was the second-largest in area of the 
five Great Lakes. The show said Lake Michigan, but later admitted 
it had made a research error and invited Honea back. 
</P>
<P>
	Producer Michael Davies told Honea, a doctoral student in  
computer engineering, that he could keep the $64,000 he'd won and 
try to increase his winnings. 
</P>
<P>
	In a show taped Saturday and aired on ABC Sunday, Honea  
correctly answered the question ``Which was the last horse to win 
the Triple Crown?'' boosting his winnings to $125,000. The correct 
answer is Affirmed. 
</P>
<P>
	He declined to risk part of that money on the next question,  
``Approximately how much saliva does the average human adult 
produce each day?'' 
</P>
<P>
	``I could take a guess, and I'd really like to keep playing for  
a million bucks,'' Honea said. ``A hundred and twenty-five thousand 
dollars is more than I paid for my house. I can't risk that. I'm 
going to take my money.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Philbin gave Honea a check with his winnings and then let him  
guess at the correct answer with no money on the line. He got the 
right answer -- a quart.

<HEADLINE> Athletics 7, White Sox 5  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- Gil Heredia won his eighth straight decision and  
Miguel Tejada homered, tripled and doubled Saturday night as the 
Oakland Athletics beat the Chicago White Sox 7-5 to stay tied for 
the AL wild-card lead. 
</P>
<P>
	John Jaha hit his 31st home run as Oakland kept pace with  
Boston, which defeated Anaheim 7-6. 
</P>
<P>
	Tejada drove in three runs and made two sharp plays at shortstop  
as the A's won their seventh straight against the White Sox. 
</P>
<P>
	Carlos Lee hit a solo homer in the White Sox ninth. With two  
outs, Brook Fordyce hit a line drive that right fielder Jason 
McDonald seemed ready to catch, but the ball hit him in the head. 
</P>
<P>
	McDonald's hat was knocked off and he fell to the ground for  
about a minute. He stayed in the game and, after that unusual 
single, Doug Jones relieved for his eighth save. 
</P>
<P>
	Heredia (11-5) allowed hits to the first three batters he faced,  
then retired 18 straight. He hasn't lost since June 10 at San 
Diego, a stretch of 14 starts. 
</P>
<P>
	Magglio Ordonez singled to lead off Chicago seventh and raced to  
third as the ball got by center fielder Ryan Christenson for a 
two-base error. Ordonez scored on an error by third baseman Scott 
Spiezio before Heredia retired the next three batters. 
</P>
<P>
	Heredia walked none, struck out two and allowed five hits. He  
left after a bloop single by Fordyce leading off the eighth. 
</P>
<P>
	The White Sox went on to load the bases, but managed just one  
run on Ordonez's sacrifice fly. Tejada kept it at 5-4 by snagging a 
high throw for a forceout and going into center to grab a short 
fly. 
</P>
<P>
	Jaha hit a two-run homer in the ninth.  
</P>
<P>
	Tejada hit a two-run homer in the sixth, his 17th, to put the  
Athletics ahead 5-2 and drive out Jaime Navarro, who lost his 
season-high fourth straight decision. 
</P>
<P>
	Tejada tripled in the fifth and doubled in the eighth. He came  
up in the ninth with a chance at the cycle, but was intentionally 
walked with two outs and a runner on second. 
</P>
<P>
	Oakland took the lead with three in the fifth against Navarro  
(7-12). Spiezio singled and Tejada tripled before Rich Becker hit 
an RBI single and stole second, setting up Randy Velarde's RBI 
single. 
</P>
<P>
	Chicago scored a pair off Heredia in the first. Ray Durham's  
leadoff fly ball to left-center field was misjudged by Becker and 
fell for a double and Mike Caruso had a bunt single. Durham scored 
on Mike Macfarlane's passed ball and Frank Thomas hit an RBI 
double. 
</P>
<P>
 *Notes:* Christenson entered the game as a pinch-runner in the  
seventh and made his error in the bottom half of the inning. ... 
Durham scored his 100th run, reaching that figure for the third 
straight season. ... The A's have scored 190 runs in August. 
Seattle's 191 runs in May were the most by a major league team this 
season over one month. ... Art Howe now has 288 victories as 
Oakland's manager, tying him with Dick Williams for second place on 
the team's career list. Tony La Russa is the leader with 798. ... 
The White Sox are expecting more than 500 canines for their annual 
Dog Day afternoon promotion Sunday.

<HEADLINE> Hurricane Heading for U.S. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHARLESTON, S.C. (AP) -- Hurricane Dennis continued to gather  
might early Sunday on a steady but indeterminate path toward the 
United States after its move through the northern Bahamas. 
</P>
<P>
	The hurricane, which had left the islands heading northwest  
Saturday afternoon, should become a Category 3 storm with winds up 
to 130 mph by Monday, forecasters projected. 
</P>
<P>
	Dennis' trajectory remained unclear. The storm is expected to  
stay off the Carolinas yet come close enough to warrant a watch for 
South Carolina and North Carolina north to Cape Hatteras, said 
Miles Lawrence, a forecaster at the National Hurricane Center in 
Miami. 
</P>
<P>
	Meterologist Daniel Brown said the north and central Florida  
coasts will experience heavy surf throughout Sunday, but no strong 
winds. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're expecting it to just parallel the coast,'' Brown said.  
</P>
<P>
	While hundreds of miles away, Dennis kicked up 8-foot-high waves  
along the coast from Florida to North Carolina, delighting surfers 
but prompting officials to put state troopers on alert. Hurricane 
watches and tropical storm warnings were issued along hundreds of 
miles of the eastern seaboard. 
</P>
<P>
	At 5 a.m. EDT, Dennis was centered 270 miles south-southeast of  
Charleston, S.C., and about 335 miles south of Wilmington, N.C. The 
storm was moving northwesterly at 8 mph, with maximum sustained 
winds near 100 mph. Forecasters said the storm will likely 
strengthen as it turns north. 
</P>
<P>
	In the Bahamas, Dennis uprooted trees and utility poles, ripped  
down buildings under construction and tore boats from their 
moorings. 
</P>
<P>
	Hubert Tate, a fisherman at Sweeting's Cay in the Abacos, said  
the storm damaged banana and other fruit trees, smashing some to 
the ground. It ripped the shingles off some roofs and tore down 
shacks. 
</P>
<P>
	Along the eastern seaboard on Saturday, residents hoped Dennis  
would chart its path elsewhere and spare them from harm. Still, 
they prepared for trouble. 
</P>
<P>
	At North Carolina's Kill Devil Hills, on the Outer Banks chain  
of islands, Howard and Jean Wamsley of Colonial Heights, Va., 
boarded up the windows and 8-foot glass sliding doors at their 
vacation home. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is my dream house and we've got to protect it,'' Mrs.  
Wamsley said. 
</P>
<P>
	Near Wilmington, N.C., Wrightsville Beach lifeguards posted red  
flags along the beach, warning of possible rip currents. Last year, 
a 10-year-old swimmer at Atlantic Beach drowned in a rip current 
before Hurricane Bonnie arrived. 
</P>
<P>
	In Florida, three ships -- Disney's Wonder, Carnival's Fantasy  
and Cape Canaveral's Dolphin IV -- were scheduled to return Sunday 
to Port Canaveral, but cruise officials were looking at 
alternatives after the port shut down Friday night. 
</P>
<P>
	In South Carolina, about 1,000 National Guardsmen moved toward  
the coast on Saturday. Several hundred law enforcement officers 
were already there in case they are needed to direct traffic in the 
event of an evacuation. 
</P>
<P>
	In North Carolina, 150,000 coastal residents were put on alert,  
as were state troopers and emergency management personnel. 
</P>
<P>
	The South Florida Water Management District lowered water levels  
in canals to lessen the risk of flooding in heavy rains.

<HEADLINE> 1st Link of Future Internet Turns 30 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- It was a busy summer in 1969: Men had walked  
on the moon and young people rocked at a farm named Woodstock. 
Protests of the war in Vietnam raged as Los Angeles police searched 
for Charles Manson's gang. 
</P>
<P>
	Hardly anybody was paying attention to Len Kleinrock's  
laboratory at the University of California, Los Angeles. Only about 
20 people watched on Sept. 2 as two bulky computers were connected 
by a 15-foot gray cable and bits of meaningless test data silently 
flowed between them. 
</P>
<P>
	To many people, that day marked the birth of the computer  
network that would become the backbone of the Internet 
</P>
<P>
	``We didn't think of this as a key event in any historical  
sense,'' said Kleinrock, a UCLA professor since 1963. ``We didn't 
even have a camera.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The connection was the culmination of years of research by  
Kleinrock and others in the field of sharing information over a web 
of connected computers. Twenty-five years would pass before the 
Internet became a household word. 
</P>
<P>
	The UCLA team of graduate students in 1969 included future  
Internet leaders like Vinton Cerf, who later helped create the 
Internet's common language, and the late Jonathan Postel, who 
pioneered its address system. 
</P>
<P>
	``If it didn't work, then we couldn't have built the Internet,''  
said Cerf, now a vice president at MCI Worldcom. 
</P>
<P>
	The idea grew from the needs of the Defense Department's Advance  
Research Projects Agency, or ARPA, which was formed after the 
Soviet Union's 1957 launch of Sputnik, the first manmade satellite 
to orbit the Earth. 
</P>
<P>
	The agency provided the money and computers so that U.S.  
scientists could compete with their Cold War adversaries. 
</P>
<P>
	By the mid 1960s, they needed to share data and computing power  
across the country. Mailing computer punch cards and magnetic tapes 
was too slow. Telephone lines could transfer data, but that was too 
expensive, and different computers with conflicting operating 
systems didn't easily talk to each other. 
</P>
<P>
	Theorists suggested the new network should be decentralized so  
that the failure of one point would not bring down the works. It 
also should speak in a common language of data, chopped into 
digital packets, each labeled with instructions on where to go and 
how to be reassembled once they reach their destination. 
</P>
<P>
	Each research center connected to the network would have a  
separate computer, called an Interface Message Processor or IMP, 
acting as a translator between the local computers and the network. 
</P>
<P>
	The first paper describing the technology, later called  
packet-switching, wasn't even written until 1961. The author was 
Len Kleinrock, then a graduate student at the Massachusetts 
Institute of Technology. 
</P>
<P>
	By 1968, ARPA had issued specifications for the new network and  
within a year contracts were awarded. Kleinrock and a team of 
graduate students at UCLA would be the first to test drive the new 
technology because of his pioneering work. 
</P>
<P>
	As Kleinrock and his students worked day and night to prepare  
their Sigma-7 host computer, they learned to their relief that 
delivery of the first IMP might be delayed until mid-September, 
giving them more time. 
</P>
<P>
	``We were thrilled,'' Kleinrock recalled. ``Then they sent it  
out air freight and it arrived on Labor Day weekend.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The refrigerator-size unit in a battleship gray cabinet didn't  
fit in the elevator, so it had to be hoisted through a third-floor 
window. 
</P>
<P>
	Then, representatives of the Defense Department, telephone  
companies and computer makers watched as a 3-inch-wide flat cable 
was plugged into the machines. 
</P>

	``Everybody was ready to point the finger at somebody else if it  
didn't work,'' Kleinrock said. ``We connected up and that damned 
thing just picked up and started sending bits back and forth. There 
were no glitches at all.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In October, another IMP was installed at the Stanford Research  
Institute in Menlo Park, Calif. The network crashed when a computer 
operator punched in the first two letters of the word ``logon.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Soon after, however, the first real messages and programs were  
flowing. 
</P>
<P>
	By January 1970, four ``nodes'' had been set up: UCLA and SRI  
were joined by UC Santa Barbara and the University of Utah. The 
number increased to 10 within seven months. E-mail, the network's 
first popular application, appeared in 1972. 
</P>
<P>
	That network, or ARPANET, grew into the Internet as more  
networks were connected and new applications created. By the early 
1990s, the World Wide Web emerged as the most popular way of 
browsing the network now accessible to anyone with a computer. 
</P>
<P>
	``We began to realize what's really interesting about this  
network is not machine-to-machine communication, but human-to-human 
interaction,'' Kleinrock said.

	SEVILLE, Spain (AP) -- Marla Runyan is legally blind. But that  
didn't stop her from finishing 10th in Sunday 1,500-meter final, 
running 4 minutes, 6.45 seconds -- seven seconds behind Russian 
winner Svetlana Masterkova. 
</P>
<P>
	Now the 30-year-old American has a new challenge in mind.  
</P>
<P>
	``Maybe in the future I'll try the steeplechase,'' she said.  
``My coach doesn't know about that yet. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think the barriers are big enough (to see well) that you can  
get a rhythm to it. And you know where they are on the track. I 
think I can do it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Runyan, who began to loose her sight at age 9, is legally blind  
with 20/800 vision that's corrected to 20/300 with contact lenses. 
</P>
<P>
	``I wish I could have done better,'' she said. ``But I didn't  
have it in my legs.'' Runyan set a personal record of 4:05.27 in 
Friday's semifinals. 
</P>
<P>
	``I am so honored to wear a USA uniform and run in this  
stadium,'' she added. ``I count my blessing every day. I've had a 
wonderful year.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``My original goal was to compete on the USA team -- and I've  
made it to the World Championship finals. Quite a big difference.'' 
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	 *MORE CASH:* Top Finnish athletics officials said their nation  
can no longer compete at the highest levels -- and they need more 
funding. 
</P>
<P>
	``We need four times more money than we get now,'' said team  
leader Tapio Korjus, the men's javelin champion at the 1988 
Olympics. ``In Sydney (at next year's Olympics), the countries 
which put the most money into athletics will get the most medals. 
Standards are getting higher.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Korjus and team coaches held an impromptu news conference with  
about 20 Finnish journalists Sunday in a hallway at the Estadio 
Olimpico to discuss the country's showing here. 
</P>
<P>
	Before these championships, Finnish officials had set their  
sights on three medals and five other finishes between fourth and 
eighth place. 
</P>
<P>
	But heading into Sunday's final day of action, the country's top  
showings were Tiia Hautala's fifth place in the heptathlon and 
Ville Tiisanoja's eighth place in the men's shot put. 
</P>
<P>
                            	 *------	 
</P>
<P>
	 *DRIVING AMBITION:* Michael Johnson, fresh off setting the world  
record for 400 meters in Seville, has one more goal this season: 
the year's best time in the 200. 
</P>
<P>
	That's what he told Van Damme meet organizer Wilfried Meert in  
signing up for Friday's event in Brussels, Belgium. 
</P>
<P>
	``Where does he still get his motivation? He came in and just  
told me, `I want the best time of the year,''' Meert said. 
</P>
<P>
	Bronze medalist Francis Obikwelu of Nigeria posted the best 1999  
time at 200 when he clocked 19.84 seconds in the semifinals at the 
World Championships. 
</P>
<P>
	Johnson's best time was the 19.93 he ran at Rome in July. He set  
the world record of 19.32 at the 1996 Olympics, and is now only the 
second man ever to simultaneously hold the world marks in both the 
200 and 400. 
</P>
<P>
	The Brussels track is known for its fast curves and Meert said  
Johnson has already reserved lane 5. 
</P>
<P>
                            	 *------	 
</P>
<P>
	 *OLE, ABEL:* The Spanish media used words of reverence normally  
reserved for soccer stars or toreadors to honor countryman Abel 
Anton's repeat gold medal in the marathon. 
</P>
<P>
	Arms outstretched to heaven and draped in the red and yellow  
Spanish flag, Anton's image dominated the front pages of all the 
major daily newspapers Sunday, topped by words such as 
``apotheosis'' ``historic'' and ``heroic.'' 
</P>
<P>
	El Mundo, a Madrid-based newspaper, carried an opinion piece  
proclaiming: ``Anton is rising to the stature of athletes such as 
Michael Johnson or Maurice Green.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Another Spaniard, Yago Lamela, also earned hefty praise for his  
silver in the men's long jump. ``A silver medal that promises a 
future gold,'' read a typical headline in daily ABC. 
</P>
<P>
	Keen to identify a general trend, El Pais wrote that Anton, 36,  
and Yamela, 22, ``at either end of a generation, displayed the new 
Spanish mentality that was born at the (1992) Barcelona Olympics 
and now shines in tennis, motor racing, football, cycling and 
golf.''

<HEADLINE> Western Wildfires Still a Threat </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	Firefighters in the Western states were making progress Saturday  
on blazes that have burned more than 200,000 acres, though hot 
weather and frequent lightning strikes continued to pose a threat. 
</P>
<P>
	``It seems like things are stabilizing,'' said Janelle Smith, of  
the National Interagency Fire Center in Boise, Idaho. ``There are a 
lot of new lightning strikes but we are getting to them as best we 
can.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A week's worth of effort paid off Saturday, as firefighters  
approached containment on the largest fires. Crews then did a 
largely successful job of concentrating their efforts on new and 
remaining fires. 
</P>
<P>
	Nineteen large fires were burning in California, Nevada, Oregon  
and Texas, though nine were expected to be contained Sunday. Over 
200,000 acres had been consumed. 
</P>
<P>
	More than half of the fires were in Northern California, drawing  
more than 7,000 firefighters. The fires took up most of the state's 
firefighting budget only two months into the fiscal year. 
</P>
<P>
	Late Saturday, winds fanned flames of three California fires  
that began earlier in the day, burning thousands of acres in the 
San Bernardino National Forest, about 85 miles east of Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
	One blaze moved to within miles of a resort community near Lake  
Arrowhead, but evacautions had not been ordered early Sunday. 
Another area blaze caused the evacuation of a trailer park. 
</P>
<P>
	Nevada's biggest blaze, north of Reno, blackened 40,000 acres.  
Full containment was expected by Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	A fire near Oregon's Sheldon-Hart National Wildlife Refuge  
charred 30,000 acres and was expected to be contained by Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
	Texas National Guard helicopters were called out to battle a  
1,700-acre fire west of Lampasas. 
</P>
<P>
	A 600-acre blaze near Okanogan, Wash., was completely contained  
Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	Northern California's weekend weather was expected to be hot,  
but tempered by lower winds. Montana, eastern Idaho and Wyoming 
were to see some scattered thunderstorms. That would mean dangerous 
lightning but also rain.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Enjoys Donuts, Dollars, Golf </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	EAST HAMPTON, N.Y. (AP) -- Golf and donuts, Sunday dinner for  
$900,000 and a magazine photo shoot. Just another day of vacation, 
Clinton style. 
</P>
<P>
	President Clinton, who is spending the weekend with his family  
at the home of filmmaker Steven Spielberg, began a leisurely day by 
sitting for a photo spread for George magazine and strolling 
through the center of this posh Long Island town. 
</P>
<P>
	Later Sunday, Clinton was the featured speaker at a dinner to  
benefit the Democratic National Committee and first lady Hillary 
Rodham Clinton's exploratory committee for the 2000 Senate race. 
</P>
<P>
	Singer Jon Bon Jovi was the featured entertainer at the event,  
held at an estate in nearby Bridgehampton. 
</P>
<P>
	White House officials said the photo shoot was for a George  
piece in memory of its creator, John F. Kennedy Jr., that was 
focusing on people Kennedy had admired. Other figures included 
Muhammad Ali and Madeleine Albright. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton then took his motorcade into the center of East Hampton,  
bringing the town to a standstill as he shook hands with passersby 
and picked up a dozen donuts from Dreesen's, a local market. 
</P>
<P>
	Continuing up the street, the president popped into Babette, a  
bistro featuring a mix of Asian and nouvelle American dishes, 
including truffled halibut. But he didn't stay to eat, returning to 
chat out of earshot of the press with a few dozen well-wishers who 
had gathered outside. 
</P>
<P>
	In full vacation mode, the president headed to the links,  
ignoring questions from reporters about the violence surrounding 
the referendum overseas Monday on East Timor's independence from 
Indonesia and recent revelations about the standoff between the FBI 
and the Branch Davidians near Waco, Texas. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton, whose golf occasionally was frustrated by inclement  
weather during the first week of his family vacation on Martha's 
Vineyard, teed off strong and straight Sunday under sunny skies at 
the nine-hole South Fork Country Club. 
</P>
<P>
	Accompanying Clinton were the club's pro and the 18-year-old  
winner of a club tournament -- both of whose first shots skipped 
into the long grass by a water hazard -- and businessman Fred Mack.

<HEADLINE> Jobs Sought for the Mentally Ill </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	INDIANAPOLIS (AP) -- For seven years, Ken Bardwell was unemployed  
and battling a growing clinical depression, a pervasive gloom that 
hampered his job search and left him solely dependent on government 
assistance. 
</P>
<P>
	But in February, an innovative job-placement program for people  
with serious mental illnesses helped the Manchester, N.H., resident 
find work at a restaurant. 
</P>
<P>
	Bardwell is now a dining room attendant who earns $5.95 an hour  
and has bought a car with his girlfriend, whom he'll wed in 
October. 
</P>
<P>
	``Since I got the job it's given me my confidence back. It's  
given me something to look forward to every day,'' said Bardwell, 
56. 
</P>
<P>
	The program that helped Bardwell find a job is at the heart of a  
$2.8 million, five-year study a Purdue University professor is 
conducting to compare two starkly different approaches to finding 
work for millions of Americans suffering from serious mental 
illness. 
</P>
<P>
	About 75 percent of Americans diagnosed with schizophrenia,  
manic depression and psychotic disorders are unemployed. In 1990, 
the last year such costs were measured, the government estimates 
that the total cost of mental illnesses, including days lost from 
work, was $148 billion. 
</P>
<P>
	``No one has really looked closely at that (employability of  
mentally ill) because the assumption has always been that they 
couldn't be employed,'' said Judith Cook, a professor of psychiatry 
at the University of Illinois at Chicago. 
</P>
<P>
	``That really flies in the face of the fact that most people  
with mental illness have a job history, and many of them a good job 
history.'' 
</P>
<P>
	This fall, Purdue psychology professor Gary Bond begins tracking  
the progress of 180 clients at a Chicago psychiatric rehabilitation 
agency that uses two different approaches to finding work for its 
clients. 
</P>
<P>
	Half the subjects will enroll in a program in place for more  
than three decades that focuses on job training, counseling and 
work in agency-run businesses to slowly edge them into the 
competitive workplace. 
</P>
<P>
	The remaining subjects will be immersed in a relatively new  
program called Individual Placement and Support (IPS) developed by 
Dartmouth Medical School researchers. It emphasizes a rapid job 
search, intensive counseling and relies heavily on the person's job 
preference. 
</P>
<P>
	Finding out which program works best should help the nation's  
mental health centers do a better job finding jobs for their 
clients, said Bond, who teaches at Purdue's School of Science in 
Indianapolis. 
</P>
<P>
	``Research shows us that people who get jobs tend to have fewer  
psychiatric symptoms and a greater sense of self, identity and 
self-worth,'' said Bond, whose study is being funded by the 
National Institute of Mental Health. 
</P>
<P>
	Dr. Cille Kennedy, who researches disability issues for the  
NIMH, said both approaches have solid reputations, although the 
program that helped Bardwell land his job is at the vanguard of new 
ideas. 
</P>
<P>
	The IPS program bypasses job training so an employment counselor  
can quickly help clients find a job in the competitive workplace. 
It emphasizes coordination between medical treatment, job placement 
and long-term support. 
</P>
<P>
	Kennedy said Bond's study might find that both approaches work  
well, and that there's no ``cookie cutter'' way to find work for 
people with a serious mental illness. Bond will also examine the 
comparative costs of the two approaches. 
</P>
<P>
	``We want to know how they work and for whom they work and how  
much they cost,'' Kennedy said. ``We have to sensitive to the 
taxpayers.'' 
</P>
<P>
	About two-thirds of the people slated to take part in the study  
suffer from schizophrenia. Bond said many mental health 
professionals believe people with schizophrenia are either too ill 
to work, fear full-time jobs or have unrealistic job expectations. 
</P>
<P>
	Bond disagree, saying recent studies have shown that two-thirds  
of people with serious mental illness want to work in competitive 
jobs and that with counseling and medications that's possible for 
most. 
</P>
<P>
	The study will be conducted at Thresholds Inc., a nonprofit  
psychiatric rehabilitation center in Chicago. Last year, the center 
helped about 1,000 people land entry-level jobs at warehouses, 
supermarkets and agency-run businesses. 
</P>
<P>
	It recently developed its own IPS program so the two programs  
can be compared during the course of Bond's study. 
</P>
<P>
	``Our philosophy is to get people to work,'' said Jerry Dincin,  
Thresholds' executive director. ``If it turns out that the new 
program is a better system than our own, that's where we're 
going.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Deborah Becker, who helped develop the IPS program, said it has  
in the past decade found jobs for people who now work as, among 
other things, landscapers, bakers, security officers, reporters and 
deli meat cutters. 
</P>
<P>
	``We all do better at things that we like to do. We're just  
trying to apply that principle to everybody,'' said Becker, a 
research assistant at Dartmouth Medical School.

<HEADLINE> Wizards 2, Fusion 0 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	KANSAS CITY, Mo. (AP) -- Tony Meola recorded a shutout in his  
first home game with the Kansas City Wizards on Sunday, a 2-0 
victory over the Miami Fusion. 
</P>
<P>
	Meola, who finally made his Wizards debut at Chicago on  
Wednesday after injuring his knee in the preseason, only had to 
make three saves as the Fusion got off just nine shots. 
</P>
<P>
	Chris Henderson scored in the 30th minute and Preki  
Radosavljevic in the 64th for Kansas City, which handed Miami its 
third straight loss and earned its first shutout since a 6-0 win 
over New York-New Jersey on June 20. 
</P>
<P>
	Radosavlevic's goal was his sixth of the season, moving him into  
a tie with Chris Klein for the team lead. 
</P>
<P>
	Alex Bunbury assisted on both goals, his first two-assist game  
in Major League Soccer. 
</P>
<P>
	Wizards defender Scott Vermillion broke his nose in the first  
half when he was elbowed by Miami's Tyrone Marshall while going for 
a ball in the air. 
</P>
<P>
	It was Vermillion's second injury of the season against the  
Fusion. In a game at Miami on April 24, he loosened several teeth 
in a collision with Wizards goalkeeper Chris Snitko.

<HEADLINE>  Johnson, Greene Anchor U.S. Wins </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SEVILLE, Spain (AP) -- Golden Boys Michael Johnson and Maurice  
Greene put their special golden touches on the final day of the 
World Championships. 
</P>
<P>
	Each anchored a winning United States relay Sunday and entered  
their names prominently in the championships' record book. 
</P>
<P>
	The businesslike Johnson, winner of his fourth straight  
400-meter title earlier in world record time, ran a sizzling leg in 
bringing the U.S. 1,600-meter relay team home in 2:56.45, the 
year's fastest time and the seventh-best ever. It was the 
Americans' third consecutive title, each relay anchored by Johnson. 
</P>
<P>
	Johnson, who also owns two 200 titles, now has nine gold medals  
at the World Championships, the most by any athlete -- one more than 
Carl Lewis. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's an honor,'' Johnson, timed in 43.50, said of breaking  
Lewis' record. ``It's a testament to what I've tried to do in my 
career: to be consistent, and go into every championships on the 
top of my game and go in to win.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Jerome Davis gave the Americans the lead from the outset, then  
Antonio Pettigrew, Angelo Taylor and Johnson continued to widen the 
advantage as the Americans beat runner-up Poland by nearly 2 1/2 
seconds before a capacity crowd of more than 50,000. 
</P>
<P>
	The enthusiastic Greene, the 100 and 200 champion, overcame  
Britain's Dwain Chambers on the final leg of the 400 relay with a 
sensational 9.12 effort, carrying the Americans to victory at 
37.59, the fastest time in the world this year and the fifth-best 
ever. 
</P>
<P>
	``A guy of that caliber with that kind of heart, all you have to  
do is keep him within striking distance,'' U.S. men's team coach 
George Williams said. ``He just believes in himself.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Americans' victory was retribution for failing to get  
through the first rounds at the past two championships because of 
dropped batons, and they celebrated accordingly. 
</P>
<P>
	As Greene crossed the finish line, he raised his left hand  
signifying No. 1 and flailed his tongue in typical Michael Jordan 
fashion. He then jumped into the arms of leadoff runner Jon 
Drummond, who was wearing leopard-spotted spikes. 
</P>
<P>
	Then, Greene and Drummond knelt on the track in prayer, as did  
Tim Montgomery and Brian Lewis. That was followed by the four 
teammates stripping to the waist and posing in bodybuilding 
stances, flexing their muscles, before taking their victory laps 
with American flags draped over them. 
</P>
<P>
	Later, after the victory ceremony, Drummond, Lewis and  
Montgomery lifted Greene onto their shoulders, and two of them gave 
him their gold medals so he could pose for pictures with three 
golds. 
</P>
<P>
	``That's three, baby,'' the smiling Greene said, while holding  
up three fingers. 
</P>
<P>
	The three golds enabled Greene to tie Lewis and East Germany's  
Marita Koch for the most in one championships. Lewis did it twice, 
in 1983 and 1987. 
</P>
<P>
	``I want to take what Carl Lewis did a step farther,'' Greene  
said. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've always believed I was one of the best athletes in the  
world. If you say I'm the man of this meet or one of the top 
athletes in track and field, I'll love it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Unlike in the past, the Americans' 400 relay handoffs were sure  
and swift, and although Greene trailed Chambers slightly at the 
start of the anchor, he was able to power down the final straight 
and overtake the young Brit. 
</P>
<P>
	``We had a great relay team and the bottom line is that we knew  
if passed the stick around we would win,'' Greene said. 
</P>
<P>
	The two women's relays also were run in world-leading times.  
</P>
<P>
	The biggest surprise was the Bahamas' victory in the 400 as the  
favored U.S. team finished fourth, behind France and Jamaica. 
</P>
<P>
	The Americans appeared doomed from the outset when their first  
two runners, Cheryl Taplin and Nanceen Perry, left them trailing 
badly. Inger Miller, the 200 champion, got them back into 
contention with a solid third leg, but Gail Devers, the 100 hurdles 
champion, who started in second place, was passed by France's 
Christine Arron and Jamaica's Peta-Gaye Dowdie. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, the Bahamas' team of Sevatheda Fynes, Chandra  
Sturrup, Pauline Davis and Debbie Ferguson provided the country's 
first gold of the championships, running 41.92. 
</P>
<P>
	In the women's 1,600 relay, the Russian team of Tatyana  
Chebykina, Svetlana Goncharnko, Olga Kotlyarova and Natalya 
Nazarova won at 3:21.98, as the Americans' chance for victory 
vanished when German anchor Grit Breuer clipped the heels of Jearl 
Miles-Clark as she was making a run at Nazarova in the stretch. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think (the Americans) would have won if they hadn't been hit  
by Germany with 70 meters to go,'' said Craig Masback, head of USA 
Track and Field. ``The women did not consider it to be deliberate. 
The Germans apologized. And that's the way it goes sometimes.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Americans settled for the silver at 3:22.09, and finished  
the championships with leading totals of 17 medals -- their fewest 
ever -- and 11 golds. Russia was second with 13 medals, six golds, 
and Germany third with 12 medals, four golds. 
</P>
<P>
	The men's 800 produced one of the closest finishes of the  
championships, as Kenyan-born Wilson Kipketer of Denmark edged 
South Africa's Hezekiel Sepeng by .02 seconds at 1:43.30 for his 
third title in a row. 
</P>
<P>
	``I didn't know if I had won until I saw it on the giant stadium  
screen,'' Kipketer, the world record-holder, said after capping his 
comeback from malaria a year ago. 
</P>
<P>
	The women's 1,500 turned into a rough-and-tumble race, before  
Russia's Svetlana Masterkova, the 1996 Olympic gold medalist, 
emerged with her second straight title with a season's best 
3:59.53. 
</P>
<P>
	American Regina Jacobs, the runner-up with a career-best  
4:00.35, was roughed up twice in the final 250 meters, losing her 
chance for victory. 
</P>
<P>
	``Second again!'' Jacobs said.

<HEADLINE>  Johnson, Greene Anchor U.S. Wins </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SEVILLE, Spain (AP) -- Golden Boys Michael Johnson and Maurice  
Greene put their special golden touches on the final day of the 
World Championships. 
</P>
<P>
	Each anchored a winning United States relay Sunday and entered  
their names prominently in the championships' record book. 
</P>
<P>
	The businesslike Johnson, winner of his fourth straight  
400-meter title earlier in world record time, ran a sizzling leg in 
bringing the U.S. 1,600-meter relay team home in 2:56.45, the 
year's fastest time and the seventh-best ever. It was the 
Americans' third consecutive title, each relay anchored by Johnson. 
</P>
<P>
	Johnson, who also owns two 200 titles, now has nine gold medals  
at the World Championships, the most by any athlete -- one more than 
Carl Lewis. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's an honor,'' Johnson, timed in 43.50, said of breaking  
Lewis' record. ``It's a testament to what I've tried to do in my 
career: to be consistent, and go into every championships on the 
top of my game and go in to win.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Jerome Davis gave the Americans the lead from the outset, then  
Antonio Pettigrew, Angelo Taylor and Johnson continued to widen the 
advantage as the Americans beat runner-up Poland by nearly 2 1/2 
seconds before a capacity crowd of more than 50,000. 
</P>
<P>
	The enthusiastic Greene, the 100 and 200 champion, overcame  
Britain's Dwain Chambers on the final leg of the 400 relay with a 
sensational 9.12 effort, carrying the Americans to victory at 
37.59, the fastest time in the world this year and the fifth-best 
ever. 
</P>
<P>
	``A guy of that caliber with that kind of heart, all you have to  
do is keep him within striking distance,'' U.S. men's team coach 
George Williams said. ``He just believes in himself.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Americans' victory was retribution for failing to get  
through the first rounds at the past two championships because of 
dropped batons, and they celebrated accordingly. 
</P>
<P>
	As Greene crossed the finish line, he raised his left hand  
signifying No. 1 and flailed his tongue in typical Michael Jordan 
fashion. He then jumped into the arms of leadoff runner Jon 
Drummond, who was wearing leopard-spotted spikes. 
</P>
<P>
	Then, Greene and Drummond knelt on the track in prayer, as did  
Tim Montgomery and Brian Lewis. That was followed by the four 
teammates stripping to the waist and posing in bodybuilding 
stances, flexing their muscles, before taking their victory laps 
with American flags draped over them. 
</P>
<P>
	Later, after the victory ceremony, Drummond, Lewis and  
Montgomery lifted Greene onto their shoulders, and two of them gave 
him their gold medals so he could pose for pictures with three 
golds. 
</P>
<P>
	``That's three, baby,'' the smiling Greene said, while holding  
up three fingers. 
</P>
<P>
	The three golds enabled Greene to tie Lewis and East Germany's  
Marita Koch for the most in one championships. Lewis did it twice, 
in 1983 and 1987. 
</P>
<P>
	``I want to take what Carl Lewis did a step farther,'' Greene  
said. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've always believed I was one of the best athletes in the  
world. If you say I'm the man of this meet or one of the top 
athletes in track and field, I'll love it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Unlike in the past, the Americans' 400 relay handoffs were sure  
and swift, and although Greene trailed Chambers slightly at the 
start of the anchor, he was able to power down the final straight 
and overtake the young Brit. 
</P>
<P>
	``We had a great relay team and the bottom line is that we knew  
if passed the stick around we would win,'' Greene said. 
</P>
<P>
	The two women's relays also were run in world-leading times.  
</P>
<P>
	The biggest surprise was the Bahamas' victory in the 400 as the  
favored U.S. team finished fourth, behind France and Jamaica. 
</P>
<P>
	The Americans appeared doomed from the outset when their first  
two runners, Cheryl Taplin and Nanceen Perry, left them trailing 
badly. Inger Miller, the 200 champion, got them back into 
contention with a solid third leg, but Gail Devers, the 100 hurdles 
champion, who started in second place, was passed by France's 
Christine Arron and Jamaica's Peta-Gaye Dowdie. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, the Bahamas' team of Sevatheda Fynes, Chandra  
Sturrup, Pauline Davis and Debbie Ferguson provided the country's 
first gold of the championships, running 41.92. 
</P>
<P>
	In the women's 1,600 relay, the Russian team of Tatyana  
Chebykina, Svetlana Goncharnko, Olga Kotlyarova and Natalya 
Nazarova won at 3:21.98, as the Americans' chance for victory 
vanished when German anchor Grit Breuer clipped the heels of Jearl 
Miles-Clark as she was making a run at Nazarova in the stretch. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think (the Americans) would have won if they hadn't been hit  
by Germany with 70 meters to go,'' said Craig Masback, head of USA 
Track and Field. ``The women did not consider it to be deliberate. 
The Germans apologized. And that's the way it goes sometimes.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Americans settled for the silver at 3:22.09, and finished  
the championships with leading totals of 17 medals -- their fewest 
ever -- and 11 golds. Russia was second with 13 medals, six golds, 
and Germany third with 12 medals, four golds. 
</P>
<P>
	The men's 800 produced one of the closest finishes of the  
championships, as Kenyan-born Wilson Kipketer of Denmark edged 
South Africa's Hezekiel Sepeng by .02 seconds at 1:43.30 for his 
third title in a row. 
</P>
<P>
	``I didn't know if I had won until I saw it on the giant stadium  
screen,'' Kipketer, the world record-holder, said after capping his 
comeback from malaria a year ago. 
</P>
<P>
	The women's 1,500 turned into a rough-and-tumble race, before  
Russia's Svetlana Masterkova, the 1996 Olympic gold medalist, 
emerged with her second straight title with a season's best 
3:59.53. 
</P>
<P>
	American Regina Jacobs, the runner-up with a career-best  
4:00.35, was roughed up twice in the final 250 meters, losing her 
chance for victory. 
</P>
<P>
	``Second again!'' Jacobs said.

<HEADLINE> Reid Has Golden Past and Future </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LAS VEGAS (AP) -- David Reid is a fighter with both a golden past  
and future. 
</P>
<P>
	Prominent in that future is Oscar De La Hoya, his fellow Olympic  
gold medalist. 
</P>
<P>
	``We love the matchup of the two gold medalists,'' promoter Dan  
Goossen said. ``The two gold medalists fighting each other would 
generate tremendous interest.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Reid took another step toward a possible fight with De La Hoya  
with a lopsided decision Saturday night over former 154-pound 
champion Keith Mullings in a fight that only offered tantalizing 
glimpses of the WBA super welterweight champion's talents. 
</P>
<P>
	In only his 14th pro fight, Reid showed he was still a work in  
progress, but one with the kind of skills that should lead to 
fights against the likes of De La Hoya and IBF 154-pound champion 
Fernando Vargas. 
</P>
<P>
	``I just felt so comfortable in there. I felt quick, fast and at  
home,'' Reid said. ``The more rounds I go the easier the fights are 
becoming.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Reid, though, seemed to be the only one with a smile on his face  
after making his second title defense an easy one. 
</P>
<P>
	The fans who came to see a brawl weren't happy. Reid's promoters  
would have liked to have seen more action. And his trainer thought 
he lacked focus in the ring. 
</P>
<P>
	``The first six rounds were probably David's best as a pro,''  
trainer Al Mitchell said. ``But then he got caught up with the 
talking and stuff and went downhill from there.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Reid and Mullings spent much of the last part of the fight  
exchanging insults in the ring, with Reid taunting Mullings and the 
challenger urging him to stand and fight. In the end, Reid won 
handily, with all three ringside judges scoring it 117-111. 
</P>
<P>
	The crowd booed Reid's decision to box and run, but Reid was  
pleased with the win. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm happy,'' Reid said after going the distance for the fourth  
straight time. ``The crowd wanted to see a war out there. I was 
probably frustrating the crowd because I was running.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Vargas, a member of the same 1996 Olympic team as Reid, watched  
from ringside as his fellow 154-pound champion dispatched Mullings. 
</P>
<P>
	Both fighters are under contract to HBO, and HBO boxing  
executive Lou DiBella said Reid's performance might move up a fight 
between the two to early next year. 
</P>
<P>
	``I was a little disappointed in how David fought, but he's  
still a work in progress,'' DiBella said. 
</P>
<P>
	Goossen, though, seemed more interested in Reid fighting De La  
Hoya in a matchup of the only two U.S. boxing gold medalists of the 
1990s. De La Hoya, who fights Felix Trinidad in a welterweight 
megafight Sept. 18, is expected to move into the 154-pound class 
sometime after that fight. 
</P>
<P>
	``If Vargas is out there and it makes sense, that's where we  
will go,'' Goossen said. ``But the two gold medalists is the fight 
everyone really wants to see.''

	Evacuations Ordered on N.C. Coast  
</P>
<P>
	CHARLESTON, S.C. (AP) -- With Hurricane Dennis threatening,  
evacuations are spreading along North Carolina's coast. Evacuations 
have been ordered for Hatteras and Okracoke islands on the Outer 
Banks, and for the beaches farther south, off Wilmington. 
Forecasters think Dennis could turn out to sea, but they are 
concerned that it could intensify and shift closer to shore. Jerry 
Jarrell, director of the National Hurricane Center in Miami, 
cautioned that because of the hurricane's size, ``it doesn't have 
to come across the coastline to cause pretty strong winds.'' 
Dennis' maximum sustained winds are near 105 mph.

	Russian Troops Clash With Militia  
</P>
<P>
	MAKHACHKALA, Russia (AP) -- Russian troops clashed with militants  
today after government forces tried to confiscate weapons in a 
Dagestani village where Islamic fundamentalists have imposed strict 
religious laws. Russian helicopters fired rockets at the rebels 
outside Karamakhi, about 50 miles east of the mountain villages 
where government troops and Islamic rebels battled for more than 
two weeks earlier this month. Karamakhi is considered the center of 
Islamic fundamentalism in the region. The weapons roundup was part 
of an effort by Russian authorities to restore order to Dagestan, 
which the Islamic militants invaded Aug. 7.

	Life in Turkey Returning to Normal  
</P>
<P>
	BURSA, Turkey (AP) -- There was a small sign today that life in  
Turkey is returning to normal, some two weeks after a devastating 
earthquake left nearly 14,000 people dead and hundreds of thousands 
homeless. State-run TV resumed normal programming today for the 
first time since the quake on Aug. 17, showing a movie. Up until 
then it had featured nonstop quake coverage. With cooler weather 
approaching, officials said displaced people must be moved out of 
soggy makeshift tents and into warm, winterized shelters. Damage 
from the quake has been estimated at $10 billion.

	Britons Unsure How To Remember Diana  
</P>
<P>
	LONDON (AP) -- With the second anniversary of Princess Diana's  
death looming, Britain seems uncertain about how to commemorate the 
date -- or whether to mark it at all. No official memorials are 
planned Tuesday, in contrast to last year's anniversary, when the 
royal family held a prayer service and London's Westminster and St. 
Paul's cathedrals staged special services for the public. Prince 
Charles and Diana's sons, Princes William and Harry, will attend 
private prayers next week at Crathie Church near Queen Elizabeth 
II's Balmoral estate in Scotland, but the royal family plans 
nothing formal on the day of the anniversary.

	Barak Renews Lebanon Troops Pledge  
</P>
<P>
	JERUSALEM (AP) -- Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak told his  
command staff he still intends to withdraw soldiers from southern 
Lebanon within a year. Barak said that in the meantime he expected 
the army to continue to protect Israeli towns along the northern 
border with Lebanon. Israeli warplanes and ground troops today 
attacked suspected guerrilla hideouts in Lebanon, Lebanese security 
officials said. Israel believes Syria, the powerbroker in Lebanon, 
is key to a withdrawal because it is the only side able to contain 
the guerrillas fighting Israel in southern Lebanon. Peace talks 
between Israel and Syria broke down in 1996.

	Elephant Land Mine Victim Recovers

	LAMPANG, Thailand (AP) -- Doctors say the elephant whose foot was  
partially amputated after she stepped on a land mine is on her way 
to recovery. Motola underwent three hours of surgery yesterday as 
surgeons worked to cut away dead flesh and shattered bones from her 
front left foot. Doctors today said they are hopeful the 38-year 
old pachyderm will one day walk again. Motola stepped on a land 
mine nearly two weeks ago as she foraged for food during a break 
from hauling logs on the Myanmar-Thai border.

the lead of the Formula One standings by one point ahead of Eddie 
Irvine. Hakkinen, the defending champion, finished second and now 
has 60 points with Irvine at 59 and Coulthard at 46 with four races 
left. Michael Schumacher has 32 points and is expected to make his 
comeback from a broken leg at the next race, the Italian Grand Prix 
Sept. 12.

<HEADLINE> Historic Mass. Church Destroyed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
                            *BY JEFF DONN   	
</P>
<P>
	HOLYOKE, Mass. (AP) -- A 19th-century church was destroyed in a  
six-alarm fire Sunday that burned at least six buildings in 
downtown Holyoke. No serious injuries were reported. 
</P>
<P>
	The fire started in a vacant building on Elm Street at about 7  
p.m. before spreading to Our Lady of Perpetual Help Church, 
firefighters said. Embers shot skyward from the burning church 
steeple, and some of them touched off a small fire at a mill 
building a half-mile away. 
</P>
<P>
	Amy Fitzgerald, who has been attending the Roman Catholic church  
for seven years, watched as the building burned. ``It's like a 
piece of history and it's gone,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	The Rev. J. Lessard was serving his first day as the church's  
pastor when the fire struck. He'd recently moved from a position as 
assistant pastor at a church in Springfield. 
</P>
<P>
	``This was my promotion,'' he said as he watched his new church  
burn to the ground in this city about 90 miles west of Boston. 
</P>
<P>
	A neighboring halfway house burned in the blaze, along with at  
least two other vacant buildings. A nearby apartment building also 
caught fire, and was evacuated by police and firefighters along 
with other buildings in the immediate area. 
</P>
<P>
	The cause of the fire could not immediately be determined.  
Firefighters from at least six nearby communities helped battle the 
blaze and five firefighters were treated at Holyoke Hospital for 
minor injuries and smoke inhalation. 
</P>
<P>
	Mayor Dan Szostkiewicz said two of the vacant buildings that  
burned had been scheduled for demolition in the near future. The 
city had been waiting for bids from companies to demolish them, he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	``For years we just let these buildings sit and serve as fire  
traps and drug havens,'' Szostkiewicz said.

<HEADLINE> Sudan To Begin Pumping Oil Monday </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	KHARTOUM, Sudan (AP) -- Sudan on Monday plans to pump 600,000  
barrels of crude onto tankers anchored in the Red Sea port city of 
Bashayir, marking the realization of a two-decade-old dream for the 
cash-starved country. 
</P>
<P>
	International dignitaries will be on hand in Bashayir -- located  
about 250 miles northeast of the capital, Khartoum -- to witness 
Sudan's entry into the ranks of the oil exporting nations, 
President Omar el-Bashir was quoted as saying Sunday by the 
official Sudan News Agency. 
</P>
<P>
	The event and coincides with a decision by the International  
Monetary Fund to revoke its five-year-old classification of Sudan 
as a non-cooperating country for failure to meet its foreign debt 
obligations, Finance Minister Abdel-Wahab Osman told a news 
conference Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
	The IMF decision also includes a reduction from $50 million to  
$30 million per year in the servicing of the Sudan's $20 billion 
foreign debt, he said, citing improvements in the country's 
economic performance since 1998 as one of the reasons for the 
decision. 
</P>
<P>
	Since the 1970s, when it granted Chevron exploration  
concessions, Sudan has been trying to develop its oil industry. 
Chevron discovered fields in 1982, but the U.S. company did not 
develop them and cited security reasons for eventually dumping the 
project. 
</P>
<P>
	Chevron's concessions were revoked in 1992. In recent years,  
Sudan set up, with Chinese help, a refinery with a capacity of 2.5 
million tons per year, and a 940-mile-long pipeline from Heglig in 
central Sudan to Port Sudan on the Red Sea. 
</P>
<P>
	Sudan has contracted with the Calgary, Alberta-based Talisman  
Energy, Inc., to initially pump 150,000 barrels per day, and 
increase to as much as 450,000. The Heglig area has recoverable 
reserves of about 627 million barrels, and investors are looking at 
developing other fields. Domestic consumption is about 30,000 
barrels per day. 
</P>
<P>
	The country's oil wealth is also a source of conflict between  
the government and southern rebels who threaten to blow up the new 
pipeline. While Khartoum has played down the threat, fears abound 
that fighting will worsen and that the government will overlook 
development in favor of building up its military to crush the 
rebellion. 
</P>
<P>
	The war for southern autonomy and related famine has killed  
nearly 2 million people and displaced millions more.

<HEADLINE> Publix Recalls Tainted Ground Beef </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ATLANTA (AP) -- Publix Super Markets Inc. has removed cases of  
ground beef from some of its stores after federal inspectors found 
potentially deadly E. coli bacteria in an Aug. 23 shipment, 
officials said Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	No illnesses have been reported, and it was not immediately  
clear how many stores were affected or how much ground beef was 
shipped. Calls to the company rang unanswered Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	The bacteria was discovered during a routine sampling of the  
meat in a suburban Atlanta store, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
	Georgia Commissioner of Agriculture Tommy Irvin said state and  
federal inspectors were trying to determine where the tainted beef 
originated. The Publix recall was voluntary, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	E. coli can cause serious illness and sometimes death. Symptoms  
include cramps and bloody diarrhea.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Wins Pan Pacific Swim Meet </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SYDNEY, Australia (AP) -- Even after winning six golds at the Pan  
Pacific championships, Jenny Thompson hasn't decided how many 
events she will enter in next year's Olympics. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm not sure what I'll do,'' Thompson said after helping the  
United States to a narrow victory over Australia. ``It was pretty 
tough coming right out of the medal ceremony and into the swim, but 
I'm sure other people will be in the same situation.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Thompson was involved in two of the U.S. team's three golds on  
Sunday's final day, while Australia's Grant Hackett won the other. 
</P>
<P>
	The United States and Australia finished with 13 golds each, but  
the U.S. team won on points -- 391 to 372 -- and had 35 medals 
overall to Australia's 32. 
</P>
<P>
	The Olympics are returning to Australia, and the same pool where  
the Pan Pacific's were held, next year for the first time since the 
1956 Melbourne Olympics. That was the last time the Aussies won 
more golds than the United States at a major meet. 
</P>
<P>
	For the first time in eight days, no world record records were  
broken, leaving the final tally at 12. 
</P>
<P>
	The American men's 400 medley team got the final gold of the  
meet, finishing ahead of an Australian team later disqualified. 
</P>
<P>
	Hackett fought a cold to win the 1,500 gold medal and extend  
Australia's lead to two golds with the two medley relays remaining. 
</P>
<P>
	Thompson, who won the 50 freestyle, also helped the U.S. team,  
which included Barbara Bedford, Megan Quann and Liesl Kolbisen, win 
the butterfly leg in a U.S. team. 
</P>
<P>
	Then Lenny Krayzelburg, Kurt Grote, Dod Wales and Neil Walker  
pressured the Australian team into a false start between Geoff 
Huegill's butterfly leg and Michael Klim's freestyle for the final 
100 meters. 
</P>
<P>
	Hackett overcame a severe head cold to post the third-fastest  
time in history in the 1,500 freestyle. His 14 minutes, 45.6 
seconds was just 4.06 outside Kieren Perkin's 1994 world record. 
</P>
<P>
	The victory continued Australia's unbeaten run in the event at  
major championships since German Jorg Hoffmann won the 1991 world 
title, and Hackett said he was now ready to take the time under 
14:40. 
</P>
<P>
	``I haven't had a fantastic week,'' Hackett said. ``I was a bit  
sick. I just wanted to get up and win that event and then, to do 
that, the world record's not that far off now.'' 
</P>

<HEADLINE> Republicans Criticize FALN Clemency </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Two leading House Republicans criticized  
President Clinton's offer of conditional clemency to 16 members of 
a Puerto Rican independence group involved in bomb attacks in the 
1970s and 1980s. 
</P>
<P>
	House Majority Leader Dick Armey accused the president of  
putting politics before the interests of the country. He said the 
House might consider a resolution of disapproval. 
</P>
<P>
	But Democratic Sen. Charles Schumer of New York, where the  
clemency offer has been hotly debated, dismissed claims that 
Clinton was trying to win support among New York's Puerto Rican 
voters for his wife's probable Senate run. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't think that makes sense,'' Schumer said, noting that  
while law enforcement officials say the clemency offer goes too 
far, Puerto Rican leaders in New York say it doesn't go far enough. 
``I don't think this was intended to help Hillary Clinton.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The 16 members of FALN, a Spanish acronym for Armed forces of  
National Liberation, are expected to respond soon to the White 
House clemency offer. It requires that they offer signed requests 
for commutation and renounce violence. 
</P>
<P>
	The 11 men and five women were not involved in attacks that  
killed people. FALN carried out 130 bomb attacks on civilian and 
military targets from 1974 to 1983 that killed six people and 
wounded dozens. 
</P>
<P>
	Human rights groups have argued that the sentences of the 16,  
ranging from 15 to 90 years, are too harsh. 
</P>
<P>
	Rep. Dan Burton, R-Ind., who appeared with Armey and Schumer on  
NBC's ``Meet the Press,'' said most members of Congress would 
oppose clemency. ``This sends the wrong signal to terrorists around 
the world,'' Burton said. 
</P>
<P>
	He alleged there are ``a lot of people in Washington that are  
questioning'' whether the clemency offer is linked to Mrs. 
Clinton's run for the New York Senate seat. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think New York voters are pretty smart,'' Schumer said.  
``They realize that while the first lady is just about to run for 
the Senate, that she is not responsible for every action taken by 
the federal government.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The American Conservative Union this week will begin running ads  
in New York asking Mrs. Clinton to advise her husband against 
pardoning terrorists.
