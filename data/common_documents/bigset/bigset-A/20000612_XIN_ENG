<HEADLINE> Manila Refuses to Replace Chief Hostage Crisis Negotiator </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, June 11 (Xinhua) -- The Philippine government rejected
on Sunday the Abu Sayyaf's latest demand to replace its chief
negotiator in talks for the release of the hostages taken by the
group.
</P>
<P>
Philippine Press Secretary Ricardo Puno said at the
Presidential Office that the government will not heed the Moslem
extremist group's demand over the weekend to replace chief
negotiator Robert Aventajado.
</P>
<P>
The Abu Sayyaf slammed Aventajado for hinting at the
possibility of using military means to solve the hostage crisis if
negotiations fail.
</P>
<P>
Aventajado has been in the negotiating team since mid-May. He
had replaced Nur Misuari, governor of the Autonomous Region for
Muslim Mindanao, upon an earlier demand by the Abu Sayyaf.
</P>
<P>
Puno said, "The government will never allow the Abu Sayyaf to
dictate us as to who will be our negotiators."
</P>
<P>
He called the demand just another tactic of the Abu Sayyaf to
prolong the hostage crisis which is now on its 50th day.
</P>
<P>
The press secretary also dismissed speculations that the
government's refusal to grant the Abu Sayyaf's latest demand would
put at risk the safety of the group's 21 mostly foreign hostages
in Jolo island in the southern Philippines.
</P>
<P>
The Abu Sayyaf, which kidnapped the hostages from the Sipadan
Island resort in Malaysia on April 23, was said to have separated
its captives into two groups for fear of government military
rescue operations.

<HEADLINE> One Day Sailing Record Broken </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MADRID, June 11 (Xinhua) -- The giant catamaran Club Med has
shattered the world record for the distance sailed in 24 hours,
covering 625.7 nautical miles to improve the old record by more
than 45 miles.
</P>
<P>
Jointly skippered by New Zealander Grant Dalton and Frenchman
Bruno Peyron, the 33.50-meter sailing machine with a crew of 14 on
board averaged 26.07 knots during the 24 hour period.
</P>
<P>
The previous record, of 580 miles, was achieved by American
adventurer, sailor and balloonist Steve Fossett, in the Pacific
Ocean off New Zealand in March 1999.
</P>
<P>
The Club Med catamaran was launched on May 8 and is attempting
to break the trans-Atlantic record from Cadiz to San Salvador in
the Bahamas.
</P>
<P>
At the time they set the new record, the vessel was west of the
Canary Islands in the north Atlantic.
</P>
<P>
Grant Dalton is a veteran of six Whitbread Round the World
Races, while Peyron is a previous holder of the 24 hour record,
once achieving 547 nautical miles in his catamaran Explorer.

<P>
LIMERICK, Ireland, June 12 (Xinhua) -- Irish Prime Minister
Bertin Ahern said here on Monday that Ireland was delighted at the
progress which has been made in China's accession to the World
Trade Organization.
</P>
<P>
"When China joins, we will have an inclusive international
trade system - without Chinese membership the prospects for a
meaningful reform of international trading rule has been
impossible," Ahern said at the opening of the fourth Asia-Europe
Young Leaders Symposium.
</P>
<P>
"As a small trading island, we recognize the need for
meaningful negotiations in the millennium round and have a large
stake in further moves to promote more free and fair trade," he
noted.
</P>
<P>
He said Ireland, and its partners in the European Union, have
much to learn from Asia -- the world's largest and most populous
continent and over the past three decades the engine of growth for
the world economy.
</P>
<P>
The Irish prime minister added Ireland will encourage Irish
investors and traders to reach out to Asia. "In a shrinking global
economy, Asia and Europe will of course be competitors, but we can
also be partners and, can offer our peoples new opportunities that
benefit everyone," he said.
</P>
<P>
He added that the Irish government has adopted an Asian
Strategy,designed to put in place a comprehensive pro-active
political and economic policy context for the establishment of
stronger, deeper and more durable links with the region.

<TEXT>
<P>
If convicted, Nathaniel Brazill will get life in prison without
parole.
</P>
<P>
The boy could be held only until he turned 21 if he had been
prosecuted as a juvenile.
</P>
<P>
Nathaniel was charged in the May 26 slaying of Lake Worth
Community Middle School teacher Barry Grunow, who was killed in
the closing minutes of the last day of the school year.
</P>
<P>
The incident was the latest act of violence in a U.S. school
after a spate of mass school shootings in recent years.
</P>
<P>
Nathaniel's lawyer, Richard Udell, has said the gun
accidentally went off when the boy pulled it out. He said the
fault lies with the .25-caliber gun the boy stole from his
grandfather's house days before.
</P>
<P>
The boy, a musician with perfect attendance and dreams of
becoming a Secret Service agent for the president, is being held
in a juvenile detention center.
</P>
<P>
State Attorney Barry Krischer publicly called for adult charges
against the boy.
</P>
<P>
Earlier, protesters decrying the expected indictment marched
around the Palm Beach County Courthouse in Florida, banging on
bongo drums and shaking tambourines. When the indictment was
handed up, they gathered in a hallway outside the courtroom and
sang the civil rights anthem "We Shall Overcome."

<HEADLINE> Ireland Hosts Asia-Europe Young Leaders Symposium </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LIMERICK, Ireland, June 12 (Xinhua) -- The fourth Asia-Europe
Young Leaders Symposium (AEYLS) opened Monday in Ireland's midwest
city of Limerick.
</P>
<P>
The central theme of the four-day symposium was: the knowledge
society: challenges and opportunities for Asia-Europe partnership
in the 21st Century.
</P>
<P>
At the opening ceremony held at Limerick University, Irish
Prime Minister Bertin Ahern said the annual young leaders
conferences play an important role in fostering greater contact
and understanding between Asia and Europe. The success of previous
gatherings in Japan, Austria and Korea demonstrated the practical
value of bringing together young Asian and European future leaders
to meet and exchange views on issues of concern to both regions.
</P>
<P>
He added that the Irish government sees electronic business and
digital industries as vital to Ireland's continued economic
prosperity.
</P>
<P>
"A key challenge of the knowledge society is to put in place,
policies and partnership which address the claims of people coming
after them. This longer-term view will show that our context is no
longer simply local or national,but must be global and embrace a
diverse human family," the Irish prime minister said.
</P>
<P>
The Asia-Europe Young Leaders Symposium (AEYLS) is one of the
follow-up activities of the first Asia-Europe Meeting (ASEM) in
1996 in Bangkok. It was established to bring together young
leaders from Asia and Europe to promote mutual understanding
between the two regions. The first AEYLS took place in Japan in
1997. Subsequently,symposia were also held in Austria (1998) and
South Korea (1999).
</P>
<P>
These symposia play a key role in the ongoing efforts of 10
Asian countries (Brunei, China, Indonesia, Japan, South Korea,
Malaysia,the Philippines, Singapore, Thailand and Vietnam), the 15
European Union countries and the European Commission to develop a
greater level of mutual understanding and cooperation.
</P>
<P>
During the symposium, delegates will be assigned to one of six
workshops to consider in more depth some of the key themes
relevant to the knowledge society.

<HEADLINE> Argentina Satisfied with Oviedo's Capture </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BUENOS AIRES, June 12 (Xinhua)-- Agentine Interior Minister
Federico Storani said Monday he is happy that Paraguayan ex-
General Lino Oviedo has been captured.
</P>
<P>
In statements to the press, this high Argentine official said
that Oviedo's detention will allow them to thoroughly investigate
the level of participation in killings attributed to him,
including the assassination of the country's Vice President Luis
Maria Argana.
</P>
<P>
Storani said that Oviedo's capture in Brazilian city of Foz de
Iguazu confirms what Argentina's government declared, that Oviedo
has no place to hide on this country's territory.
</P>
<P>
This is Argentine government's first reaction after the
Paraguayan ex-General was captured Sunday, and taken on Monday to
Brasilia.
</P>
<P>
Paraguay's failed coup leader Lino Oviedo arrived in Brasilia
under police custody.
</P>
<P>
Oviedo was arrested in the southern Brazilian town of Foz do
Iguazu, overlooking one of the world's biggest waterfalls, Sunday
afternoon after regional authorities launched a manhunt in two
countries that lasted six months.
</P>
<P>
Paraguay's government intensified its hunt for Oviedo after
light tanks blew a hole in Congress in another failed military
uprising in Asuncion last month.
</P>
<P>
Oviedo evaded Paraguayan authorities ever since he fled
Asuncion in March 1999 following the murder of Vice President Luis
Maria Argana, which Oviedo allegedly co-plotted with his former
running mate and President Raul Cubas. Cubas was ousted in the
ensuing violence and Brazil granted him exile in an attempt to
defuse a potentially explosive situation.
</P>
<P>
Oviedo went to Argentina at the same time but quickly violated
his asylum terms in Buenos Aires by speaking to the press on
political issues. He was confined to Argentina's icy south where
he complained that strong winds would ruin his hair transplant.
</P>
<P>
He escaped in December last year and was unseen until Sunday.
But he gave regular interviews saying he was saying he was
somewhere in Paraguay, planning his return to power. He has denied
involvement in last month's uprising.

<HEADLINE> Romania, Macedonia to Cooperate in Road Transport </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BUCHAREST, June 12 (Xinhua) -- Romanian Prime Minister Mugur
Isarescu and his Macedonian counterpart Ljubco Georgievski signed
here on Monday an Agreement regarding road transport.
</P>
<P>
Georgievski arrived in Bucharest on Monday for a two-day
official visit, at the invitation of his Romanian counterpart
Mugur Isarescu.The visit is the first by Macedonia's Premier to
Romania.
</P>
<P>
According to the official Rompres news agency, the conclusion
of the Agreement regarding road transport is part of the policy of
liberalization of the road transport based on free competition
among road operators, with reduced intervention by the state in
regulating this form of transport.
</P>
<P>
The agreement is in line with the targets of the National
Strategy for Romania's preparation for admission to the European
and Atlantic structures, including the legal framework of the
bilateral cooperation, considering the pace of the development of
the political and economic ties between Romania and the other
states.
</P>
<P>
A new road agreement appeared as necessary due to the economic
and political interests of Romania and to the pace of the
development of the Romanian-Macedonian relations.
</P>
<P>
On the same day, the two prime ministers also signed a
convention on double taxation and tax evasion. The convention will
apply to residents in Romania and Macedonia and will comprise the
income tax,taxes on revenues from stocks and shares as well as
real estate transactions, wage taxes and capital increase taxes.

<HEADLINE> Interactive TV Audience to Experience Dramatic Growth Worldwide </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LOS ANGELES, June 12 (Xinhua) -- After years of disappointing
results, the interactive television market is finally taking off,
according to a new study released Monday.
</P>
<P>
By the end of this year, said U.S. communications research firm
Strategy Analytics, nearly 17 million homes worldwide will have
access to online shopping, banking, e-mail and other services via
their TV sets.
</P>
<P>
According to the firm's study, Europe is leading the way in
rolling out interactive TV services, and accounts for 81 percent
of the world market. But operators in the Untied States and
elsewhere are expected to introduce interactive service over the
next year or so. By 2005, Strategy Analytics projects that 179
million homes worldwide will access online services via their TV
sets.
</P>
<P>
Interactive services are being established on the back of
worldwide adoption of digital television. Operators' strategies
involve building the initial customer base with premium television
services and then offering those customers enhanced interactive
services at no extra cost. The most advanced operators now offer a
range of services such as Internet e-mail, online shopping,
financial services and interactive programming.
</P>
<P>
"Interactive television gives broadcasters the chance to
compete with Internet service providers for e-commerce revenues,"
Strategy Analytics said. "Next-generation advanced set-top boxes
will also position TV service providers as key gateway owners in
tomorrow's interactive home."

<HEADLINE> Wall Street Stocks Fall On Corporate Profit Warnings </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW YORK, June 12 (Xinhua) -- Wall Street stocks ended lower
Monday as a couple of companies warned that they would miss profit
predication in the current and forthcoming quarters under the
pressure of higher interest rates.
</P>
<P>
The Dow Jones industrial average closed down 49.85 at 10,564.21
and the technology heavy Nasdaq composite index fell 106.93 at 3,
767.91.
</P>
<P>
Broader stock indicators were also lower. The Standard &AMP; Poor's
500 index fell 10.95 at 1,446.00.
</P>
<P>
The market fell after Citrix said expansion of its core
business in large enterprise is slower than expected and its
earnings will miss estimates in the coming quarter. The company
plunged 47 percent to 22 U.S. dollars per share.
</P>
<P>
The warning dragged the Nasdaq index down and led the broad
market lower.
</P>
<P>
Another warning from Home Depot also helped to drive stocks
lower. The retailer said its earnings will miss expectation in the
current quarter because of rising interest rates. Home Depot fell
while other retail stocks also paid a price for an anticipated
economic slowdown.
</P>
<P>
Good news from Corning about its rising earnings did not
encourage investors in the volatile stock market. The fiber-optics
company said it anticipates earnings for the second quarter to go
up to 80 cents a share, well above analysts' estimates of 69 cents
per share.
</P>
<P>
The NYSE index fell 1.66 at 646.78 and the American Stock
Exchange index fell 2.72 at 942.47. The Russell 2000 index of
smaller companies fell 14.55 at 508.51.
</P>
<P>
Declining issues outnumbered advancers by a 10-to-9 margin on
the New York Stock Exchange with 1,478 down, 1,434 up and 509
unchanged.
</P>
<P>
NYSE volume declined to 751.95 million shares from 782.69
million in the previous session.

<TEXT>
<P>
Nineteen Marines were killed as the Osprey crashed while trying
to land at an airfield near Tucson in Arizona State on April 8.
</P>
<P>
Following the crash, Jones said he intended to be on board when
the first Osprey returned to flight as a gesture of confidence in
the aircraft.
</P>
<P>
The commandant will make that flight Saturday at the Naval Air
Weapons Station in China Lake, California State, Jones's office
announced Monday.
</P>
<P>
The Marines announced last month that mechanical failure was
ruled out as a cause of the crash, although the investigation is
continuing. It was the deadliest air disaster for the Marines
since 22 died in a helicopter crash in South Korea in 1989.

"We have a serious problem with suicides," Shinseki wrote in a
message published in the latest issue of Soldiers, an Army
magazine. The matter is urgent, he said. "We must take better care
of our people."
</P>
<P>
Official statistics do not indicate any general increase in

<HEADLINE> Israeli-Palestinian Talks to Resume in Washington </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, June 12 (Xinhua) -- Israeli and Palestinian
negotiators will reopen peace talks here Tuesday despite the
uncertainty over the Middle East peace process triggered by the
death of Syrian President Hafez Assad.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a regular briefing here Monday, White House
spokesman Joe Lockhart said President Bill Clinton's message to
the negotiators was "that time is short, we're at a critical
moment in this process; that all of the parties need to understand
the importance of working together to bridge these remaining
differences, as difficult as they are."
</P>
<P>
The talks, the third of its kind since the beginning of the
year, is supposed to determine the future of Jerusalem and how
much land Israel will cede to the Palestinians for a state.
Refugee and water problems were also on the agenda of the talks.
</P>
<P>
The sides are still aiming to work out "a final status"
agreement to settle all major issues outstanding between Israel
and the Palestinian Authority before the September 13 deadline.
</P>
<P>
The two delegations, which have already arrived here, will
reportedly meet U.S. officials separately ahead of the resumption
of talks.
</P>
<P>
During the talks, President Clinton and Palestinian leader
Yasser Arafat will hold a summit on Thursday to discuss the peace
process. The summit was originally scheduled for Wednesday but
postponed due to President Assad's funeral.

<HEADLINE> London's Millennium Bridge Closed For Weeks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, June 12 (Xinhua) - The swaying Millennium Bridge which
opened across London's river Thames on Saturday is to be closed to
allow engineers to carry out further safety checks.
</P>
<P>
It will be shut from 10 p.m. Monday after complaints that the
bridge "moves excessively" under the weight of thousands of
visitors. Some even complained of seasickness after crossing it.
</P>
<P>
A spokeswoman for the Millennium Bridge Trust said it would be
"weeks rather than days" before visitors would be allowed back.
</P>
<P>
It is the first new river crossing in central London since
Tower Bridge opened in 1894 and links St. Paul's Cathedral north
of the river with the new Tate Modern and the Globe Theater in
Southwark on the south bank.
</P>
<P>
The closure was yet another embarrassing setback for London's
costly millennium projects after the loss-making Millennium Dome
and the London Eye which failed to open at the start of the new
millennium.
</P>
<P>
A team from the bridge's engineers Arup started inspecting the
bridge Monday to track down the problem. It remained open to
pedestrians but the trust later announced the prolonged closure.

<HEADLINE> UK Government Unveils Car Price Shake-up </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, June 12 (Xinhua) -- British Trade &AMP; Industry Secretary
Stephen Byers has unveiled plans to increase competition in the
motor industry.
</P>
<P>
"It is important that consumers receive a fair deal,"Byers said
in a statement. "The measures that I plan to introduce should
bring about greater competition and lower prices by stopping
suppliers discriminating against dealers."
</P>
<P>
Under the proposed changes, it will be easier for dealers to
buy cars cheaply from authorized dealers in other European
countries.
</P>
<P>
Suppliers will have to offer dealers similar volume discounts
to those offered to fleet buyers. Some estimate that these changes
could result in price cuts on new cars of between 10 percent and
30 percent.
</P>
<P>
A Competition Commission report two months ago found car prices
were up to 10 to 12 percent higher in Britain than in similar EU
states.
</P>
<P>
Byers has given the car industry 30 days to respond to the new
rules before changing the Fair Trading Act.
</P>
<P>
The Consumer' Association has welcomed the announcement as "
music to the ears for the millions of consumers who have been
taken for a ride by the motor industry".

<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, June 12 (Xinhua) -- The average national retail
price for unleaded gasoline hit another record high for the third
week in a row, jumping 6.8 cents from last week to 1.631 U.S.
dollars a gallon, the Energy Department reported Monday.
</P>
<P>
Gasoline prices have increased nationwide in recent weeks with
the beginning of the heavy summer driving season. In some areas,
gasoline prices have skyrocketed to more than 2 dollars a gallon
in a matter of a few weeks.
</P>
<P>
The gasoline price has risen 14 cents over the last month and
was up 52 cents a gallon from a year ago.
</P>
<P>
Midwest drivers continued to pay the most for fuel, with the
price for conventional gasoline up 15 cents last week to 1.796
dollars a gallon and cleaner burning reformulated gasoline up 13.7
cents to 1.972 dollars. U.S. government officials met with oil
companies on Monday to find out why fuel prices in the region are
so high.
</P>
<P>
The Gulf coast states had the cheapest fuel, up 1.1 cents a
gallon to 1.476 dollars for conventional gasoline, while
reformulated gasoline actually fell 1.2 cents to 1.472 dollars.

ANKARA, June 12 (Xinhua) -- Turkish President Ahmet Necdet Sezer
on Monday decided to attend the funeral of late Syrian President
Hafez al-Assad, the first trip abroad for the new president who
took office on May 16 and a move that surprised the observers here.
</P>
<P>
The abrupt decision, announced in a written statement from the
Presidency's press center Monday evening, came in contrast to
Sezer's refusal to attend the just-concluded summit of the 10-
member Economic Cooperation Organization held in Iran.
</P>
<P>
The Turkish Foreign Ministry explained that Sezer's busy
schedule in the early days of his presidency barred him from
leaving the capital.
</P>
<P>
Analysts here said that Sezer's trip to Syria is expected to
have a significant influence on the relations between the two
countries. Sezer will be accompanied by Minister of Culture
Istemihan Talay.
</P>
<P>
Syria and Turkey, which were at odds over security and water-
sharing issues for more than a decade, have remarkably improved
their relations since an agreement was signed in Adana, south
Turkey, in October 1998 on cooperation against terrorism.

<P>
KUWAIT CITY, June 12 (Xinhua) -- Saudi Arabia and Yemen signed
in the western Saudi city of Jeddah on Monday a final land and sea
border agreement, following persistent bilateral efforts aimed to
close their long-running border dispute.
</P>
<P>
The deal was inked by the foreign ministers of the two Arab
neighbors, with the presence of Saudi Crown Prince and Deputy Prime
Minister Abdullah Ibn Abdul-Aziz and visiting Yemeni President Ali
Abdullah Saleh, said a joint communique issued at the end of
Saleh's two-day official visit.
</P>
<P>
The communique said the agreement outlines border coordinates
between the two countries for territory covered by the 1934 Taif
Agreement and annexes, which granted three provinces in the border
areas to Saudi Arabia.
</P>
<P>
The joint communique said leaders of the two sides held
extensive talks on bilateral ties and expressed satisfaction over
achievements in economic, commercial and cultural fields, according
to reports reaching here.
</P>
<P>
Saleh, who arrived in Jeddah on Sunday on his first official
visit to the Gulf kingdom in four years, met with both Saudi King
Fahd Ibn Abdul-Aziz and Prince Abdullah later Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Arab diplomatic sources in Saudi Arabia said the Saudi-
Yemeni talks focused on the issue of their borders demarcation.
</P>
<P>
Riyadh and Sana'a had to re-demarcate their land borders where
300 border signs had disappeared due to denudation and aging
factors.
</P>
<P>
They also needed to negotiate a settlement to the demarcation
of their maritime borders in the Red Sea.
</P>
<P>
Senior Saudi officials said earlier this year that following
several years of work of their joint committees in charge of
specifying the borders signs, most of the land border posts have
been relocated.

withdrawal line" instead of demanding that Israel pull back its
troops behind the internationally-recognized borders under U.N.
resolutions 425 and 426.

Gonzalez said that Paraguay will stimulate measures for
extraditing Oviedo, captured  Sunday in Brazilian city Foz de
Iguazu, according to reports coming from Asuncion, Paraguay's

of Vice President Luis Maria Argana's murder, carried out in
March of last year, and of the coup attempt of last month against
President Gonzalez.
</P>
<P>
The leader said that Oviedo's capture, "gives us a bit of
tranquillity, and allows us to fulfill our oath that impunity will
be banished from this country".
</P>
<P>
One of Oviedo's lawyers said that Paraguay's ex army leader
will request political asylum in Brazil following his detention in
this country in order to extradite him.
</P>
<P>
The ex-coup General took asylum on March 28, 1999 in Argentina,
from where he fled headed toward an unknown destination on the eve
of this country's President, Fernando de la Rua's taking of power
December 10, 1999.
</P>
<P>
Oviedo was sentenced to 10 years in prison for a coup attempt
in 1996 and of his sentence did eight months as his friend, former
President Raul Cubas, gave him freedom.

<HEADLINE> Fighting Drives Namibians to Seek Asylum in Botswana </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, June 12 (Xinhua) -- Hundreds of Namibians fleeing
fighting in the border areas between the Namibian army and the
Angolan rebels have crossed into Botswana, an Botswanan official
said in the capital Gaborone on Monday.
</P>
<P>
Botswanan President spokesman Festus Mogae Petlagano Gabasiane
said 896 Namibians seeked refuge in Botswana between January and
April this year, according to the South African Press Association.
</P>
<P>
"They were fleeing as a result of fighting between the Namibian
Defence Force and UNITA (National Union for the Total Independence
of Angola)," said Gabasiane.
</P>
<P>
Some 327 Angolans fled to Botswana in the same period to escape
fighting between UNITA and the Angolan government troops, the
spokesman added.
</P>
<P>
"They are running away from the war. That emerged from
preliminary interviews," he said.
</P>
<P>
Some 50 people have been killed on Namibia's northern border
with Angola since Namibia allowed the Angolan government forces to
use Namibian soil as a launch pad for attacks on UNITA last
December.
</P>
<P>
The Namibian government accused UNITA of launching cross-border
raids on its citizens.
</P>
<P>
The Angolan and Namibian asylum-seekers are being held in the
Dukwi refugee camp north of Gaborone.
</P>
<P>
The refugees were being interviewed by representatives of the
United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees and the Botswanan
government to establish whether they qualify for asylum, Gabasiane
said.

<HEADLINE> UN Appeals for $378 Million to Feed Drought Victims in Horn of Africa </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ADDIS ABABA, June 12 (Xinhua) -- The United Nations Monday
launched here an appeal for 378 million U.S. dollars to meet the
immediate needs of millions of people affected by drought in the
Horn of Africa.
</P>
<P>
The appeal constitutes food and non-food items to cater for
13.4 million people affected in Ethiopia, Kenya, Eritrea, Somalia
and Djibouti, for the period between June and December 2000.
</P>
<P>
According to a press release by the UN Office for the
Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs, the present emergency
situation was caused by three consecutive years of poor rains and
total failure of the rains last April.
</P>
<P>
The UN appeal seeks 302 million U.S. dollars for food and
another 76 million U.S. dollars for shelter, health, water and
sanitation.
</P>
<P>
With 90 percent of the total drought affected population, the
hardest hit are Ethiopia and Kenya. Ethiopia is by far the most
affected with 10 million of its 63 million people needing
assistance, followed by Kenya, where 2.2 million people need food
aid.
</P>
<P>
Some 193.4 million U.S. dollars out of the total appeal is
believed to address the needs of affected people in Ethiopia.
</P>
<P>
"Timely assistance is the difference between survival and death
for a large section of the 13.4 million people, mostly women,
children and elderly persons", said Catherine Bertini, UN special
Envoy for the Drought in the Greater Horn of Africa.

<HEADLINE> Tanzanians Urged to Protect Youth From HIV/AIDS </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, June 12 (Xinhua) -- Tanzanian President Benjamin
Mkapa urged his fellow citizens on Monday to protect the young
people from falling victim to the wide spread of HIV/AIDS.
</P>
<P>
In an opening speech for the annual Uhuru (Freedom) Torch Race
with the theme of "Year 2000 Youth against HIV/AIDS", he called on
Tanzanians to uproot the common belief that youth are HIV/AIDS
free thus making adults both male and female hunting for them.
</P>
<P>
"These are shameful habits that need to be fought by everybody
in the society and anybody with such a habit should stop it
immediately," he said.
</P>
<P>
He also encouraged his people to uphold some beneficial tribe
traditions like total banning of sexual practices before or
outside marriage.
</P>
<P>
He admitted that high unemployment had forced many youth
especially young women into commercial sex.
</P>
<P>
"In Tanzania it is estimated that in every two barmaids and
every two commercial sex workers, one is HIV/AIDS positive," he
disclosed.
</P>
<P>
Last week, Mkapa appealed to parents to advise their children
to undertake HIV/AIDS test prior to marriage and to openly discuss
the subject as it is the only way of reducing the spread of the
fatal disease.
</P>
<P>
It is estimated that among every 100 Tanzanians, ten are HIV
positive, mostly young people under the age of 40 years old.

PARIS, June 12 (Xinhua) -- French President Jacques Chirac
congratulated Monday afternoon Brice Fleutiaux, the French
freelance photographer who was freed by the Russians after living
in captivity for eight months in Chechnya.
</P>
<P>
In a telephone conversation with Fleutiaux, Chirac also asked

Catherine Colonna.
</P>
<P>
Fleutiaux was also received for half an hour by Russian

</P>
<P>
The Russian Interior Ministry said that Fleutiaux, 32, was
freed Monday by Russian security forces in a military operation
without deal or ransom.
</P>

The details about the situation of his liberation remain
unknown.
</P>
<P>
He was kidnapped by Chechen rebels on October 1, 1999, soon
after he arrived at Grozny.

On the video tape, apparently taken with professional
techniques, he was seen kowtow to the audience pleading for help

LUSAKA, June 12 (Xinhua) -- A South African plane has crashed
into the Zambezi River killing two pilots on the spot after it hit
a pylon in western Zambia, Zambian News Agency reported Monday.
</P>
<P>
The incident happened at Likanda area in Katimamulilo, Western

flying at a very low level along the Zambezi River suddenly hit

fell into the river.
</P>

river bed. The report did not say whether there were other
passengers on the plane.

The District Administrator, Robert Sipilanyambe, has confirmed
the incident. Meanwhile, Zambia Revenue Authority in conjunction

<HEADLINE> Ugandan Central Bank Intervenes in Currency Market </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KAMPALA, June 12 (Xinhua) -- The Bank of Uganda, the country's
central bank, intervened Monday in the foreign exchange market on
the sale side to the tune of 10 million U.S. dollars, according to
a press release from the bank.
</P>
<P>
The Monday's action brings total intervention on the sale side
to 98.5 million U.S. dollars since January this year, said the
release.
</P>
<P>
"The bank continues to monitor closely developments in the
foreign exchange market and will not hesitate to intervene when
necessary," the release added.
</P>
<P>
The local currency on Sunday was traded at 1,635 shillings
against the dollar, from an average of 1,555 shillings earlier
last week.
</P>
<P>
Analysts have blamed the shilling's depreciation on poor
exports, especially coffee, Uganda's major foreign exchange
earner.
</P>
<P>
However, the clashes between Ugandan and Rwandan troops in
Kisangani, a city in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, in the
last few days was also blamed for the pressure on the shilling.

<P>
TEHRAN, June 12 (Xinhua) -- Iranian President Mohammad Khatami
said here Monday that Iran has entered a new phase of relations
with countries in the region and the world, and will further
consolidate the ties by protecting mutual interests.
</P>
<P>
The president made the remarks in a meeting with visiting

<HEADLINE> Shas Minister's Comments Stir Israeli Political Spectrum </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, June 12 (Xinhua) -- An ultra-Orthodox Israeli
minister drew wide criticism at home for his comments relating one
of his cabinet colleagues and an anti-religious party with Nazism.
</P>
<P>
Sholomo Benizri, health minister from the religious ultra-
Orthodox Shas party, on Monday accused Education Minister Yossi
Sarid of incitement against his Shas party, which he compared with
Nazis' incitement against the Jews during the Holocaust.
</P>
<P>
Benizri pinned the Education Ministry's opposition to more
funding for the almost bankrupt religious education network run by
Shas on Sarid's "blind hatred" of Shas.
</P>
<P>
The funding issue has exacerbated the current government crisis,
with 17 Knesset (parliament) members of the Shas threatening the
coalition government, of which Shas is the second biggest partner,
with their votes last week in the Knesset preliminary reading for
an opposition bill calling for early parliamentary election.
</P>
<P>
In addition, Benizri also termed Yosef Lapid, leader of the
anti-religious Shinui Party, as a "Super Haider," referring to the
Austrian extreme-rightist politician Joerg Haider notorious for his
sympathetic remarks about Hitler and Nazism.
</P>
<P>
Benizri's comments have invited fierce criticism from across
Israel's political spectrum as well as from the Yad Vashem
Holocaust Memorial in Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
Prime Minister Ehud Barak swiftly condemned Benizri's
provocative remarks, saying that despite political differences,
there is no place for the Holocaust to be dragged into a political
debate. The prime minister also appealed for restraint and
tolerance.
</P>
<P>
The opposition Likud party, which sided with Shas in voting for
the early-election bill, also denounced Benizri's comments. Likud's
caucus whip Reuven Rivlin chided Benizri of "lack of knowledge
about the Holocaust."
</P>
<P>
The Yad Vashem Holocaust Memorial in Jerusalem has also
criticized the lippy Shas minister. It protested that the
Holocaust, during which 6 million Jews were killed by the German
Nazis during the World War II, was being exploited by politics and
called on all politicians to stop.
</P>
<P>
The furor came against the backdrop of the ongoing coalition
crisis in the Jewish state. Shas, the third largest party in the
Knesset after Barak's One Israel Party and Likud, hardened its
positions in negotiations with the ruling One Israel.
</P>
<P>
One Israel charges that Shas has backtracked on their latest
agreements. Following the Knesset vote on the early-election bill,
Barak has been trying to keep Shas in the coalition on condition
that Shas will withdraw its support for the bill in future votings.
</P>
<P>
Shas officials agreed that they have altered their prior
positions and want more of a say in the Middle East peace process
and domestic social issues.
</P>
<P>
Barak has reportedly been ready to allocate 25 million shekels
(6 million U.S. dollars) to cover Shas' educational deficit. Shas
was annoyed by Sarid's left-wing Meretz Party due to Sarid's
refusal to fund Shas' educational network unless it improves its
inefficient management and fires corrupt officials.
</P>
<P>
Shas is also demanding that its private radio stations be
granted broadcasting licenses.
</P>
<P>
Benizri said Shas' vote for last week's bill was a warning
signal. "If it does not work, Shas will bolt the coalition."
</P>
<P>
In a bid to assuage the coalition bustup, Minister in Prime
Minister's Office Haim Ramon is seeking an urgent meeting with Shas
spiritual leader Ovadia Yosef, who has the final say in Shas
affairs.
</P>
<P>
Under the Transition Law, Barak has until Tuesday to decide
whether to carry out his earlier threat to fire the defecting
ministers from the Shas party, the National Religious Party and
Yisrael Ba'aliya party who voted for the early-elections bill last
week.
</P>
<P>
In the wake of the frustration in the Knesset last week, Barak
has decided to form a new coalition similar to the existing one
instead of a narrow one without the maverick ruling partners who
voted for the early-elections bill.

<HEADLINE> Arafat Participation in Al-Assad's Funeral to Open New Chapter in Ties: Official </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, June 12 (Xinhua) -- The participation of Palestinian
leader Yasser Arafat in the funeral of the late Syrian President
Hafez al-Assad will open a new chapter in bilateral relations, a
Palestinian minister said on Monday.
</P>
<P>
Al-Assad died of a heart attack on Saturday. Arafat arrived in
Cairo earlier Monday en route to Damascus to take part in al-
Assad's funeral, scheduled to take place on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Arafat's participation is a sign to demonstrate the appreciation
of the long-standing relations binding the Palestinians and Syria,
Minister of Parliamentary Affairs Nabil Amr was quoted as saying by
Egypt's Middle East News Agency.
</P>
<P>
It has been widely maintained that Arafat and al-Assad had tense
relations due to Palestinians' signing of peace accords with Israel
unilaterally. Damascus hosts several hardline factions of the
Palestine Liberation Organization, of which Arafat is the chairman.
</P>
<P>
But Amr said the Palestinian-Syrian relations have never been
tense.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, he expressed confidence that Arafat's visit to Syria
will afford an opportunity to forge a new relationship with al-
Assad's successor, his son, Bashar.
</P>
<P>
Bashar has been promoted to the commander-in-chief of the armed
forces and nominated for the presidency.
</P>
<P>
Arafat last visited Syria in 1996.

<HEADLINE> Security Council Meets on DRC </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, June 12 (Xinhua) -- The U.N. Security Council
Monday began a closed-door session to discuss the latest
developments in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC), where
Ugandan and Rwandan troops were engaged in armed conflicts.
</P>
<P>
The Council meeting came after U.N. Secretary-General Kofi
Annan condemned the "reckless, senseless" fighting between Ugandan
and Rwandan forces in the DRC city of Kisangani and said that he
would ask the 15-nation Security Council to take steps to end it.
</P>
<P>
The Monday meeting also took place after both Uganda and
Rwanda announced over the weekend the withdrawal of their troops
from the northeastern city in the central African country.
</P>
<P>
Uganda said Sunday its forces had withdrawn from their
positions in Kisangani after a week of fighting with Rwandan
troops there. On the same day, Rwanda announced that it was
withdrawing from Kisangani after calm returned to the war-torn
city of Kisangani following the heavy clashes.
</P>
<P>
U.N. observers in Kisangani said that the Ugandans had pulled
back to the northern side of the Tshopo river bridge Saturday
night, marking a drastic shift of the urban front line dividing
the two armies.
</P>
<P>
Since close allies began a broader war against DRC President
Laurent Kabila nearly two years ago, Uganda and Rwanda have turned
their guns on one another.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. Mission in the DRC, known as the MONUC, currently
comprises about 130 military observers and support staff. They
include 20 observers in Kisangani who are now being reinforced and
located with both the Ugandan and Rwandan troops.
</P>
<P>
The Security Council on February 24 authorized the increasing
force to 500 military observers and some 5,000 soldiers to protect
them and provide logistics. But Annan has not yet been able to
certify that security and other conditions permit them to be
deployed in the country, formerly known as Zaire.

<HEADLINE> Security Council Meets on Cyprus </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The U.N. force was established through Security Council
Resolution 186 of 1964 with the mandate to prevent a recurrence of
fighting between the Greek Cypriot and Turkish Cypriot communities.
</P>
<P>
Following the hostilities of 1974, the Council adopted a number
of resolutions expanding the mandate of the UNFICYP to include
supervising a de facto cease-fire and maintaining a buffer zone
between the lines of the Cyprus National Guard and of the Turkish
Cypriot forces
</P>
<P>
In the absence of a political settlement to the Cyprus problem,
the UNFICYP continues its presence on the island.
</P>
<P>
Under the current circumstances, the presence of the UNFICYP "
remains indispensable" for the maintenance of the cease-fire
between the two sides, said Annan. The UNFICYP now has over 1,200
troops.
</P>
<P>
Reviewing the developments in the past six months, he said the
situation along the crease-fire lines was stable and noted an
increase of contacts between Greek and Turkish Cypriots and the
decision by the Turkish side to lift measures affecting travel.
</P>
<P>
Annan's proposal came before the third round of proximity talks
between the Turkish Cypriot and the Greek Cypriot communities
begins in Geneva in early July.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus, an eastern Mediterranean island country, has been
divided into the Turkish Cypriots-controlled north and the Greek
Cypriots-dominated south since 1974 when Turkish troops invaded
and occupied the northern third of the island in the wake of an
abortive pro-Athens military coup in Nicosia.
</P>
<P>
The United Nations has tried to reunite the island but talks
between the two communities have produced no tangible results.
</P>
<P>
The Turkish side has maintained that the only way out of the
issue is to establish a confederation on the basis of two states,
an idea rejected by the Greek state and the international
community at large.

<HEADLINE> UK Consumers Face Price Hike </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, June 12 (Xinhua) -- Britain's service sector is growing
strongly and providers of services to consumers plan to raise
their prices sharply over the next three months, according to a
business survey published Monday.
</P>
<P>
The survey by the Confederation of British Industry (CBI) shows
the first rise in confidence among consumer-services firms since
September which is regarded as a sign of lifting prices.
</P>
<P>
The CBI's quarterly survey said that a balance of 39 percent of
consumer-services firms plan to raise their prices over the next
three months, more than double the 19 percent three months ago.
</P>
<P>
Roger Bootle, an adviser to Delotte's, said: "If the prices of
consumer services rise over the next three months at the sharp
rate indicated in the survey, it would probably be a concern to
the Bank of England."
</P>
<P>
The Bank's monetary policy committee has highlighted strongly
rising service-sector prices in its recent discussions.
</P>
<P>
However, the CBI said that overall, the message of the survey
is that growth was "fairly" stable and is so far not creating
inflationary pressure.

<HEADLINE> UK Taxes On Pay Among Lowest In EU </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, June 12 (Xinhua) -- Tax and social security deductions
in Britain are among the lowest in the European Union, according
to a study published Monday.
</P>
<P>
But average earnings in the UK lag behind those in many high-
tax European countries, putting take-home pay in the UK in the
middle of the league table, said the study by William Mercer, the
management consultants.
</P>
<P>
Average British annual take-home pay amounts to 15,819 pounds,
well behind the German average of 18,550 pounds and the French
average of 16,899 pounds.
</P>
<P>
Executives in the UK lie fourth in the EU executive pay table,
with average post-tax earnings of 42,512 pounds but UK workers are
only eighth in the wider EU table.
</P>
<P>
The range of tax burdens in the EU is as wide as ever,
according to the research. The proportion of pay withheld runs
from 18 percent in the Irish Republic to 42 percent in Belgium.
</P>
<P>
Mercer said that generous state benefits are not always
accompanied by high tax and social security contributions. Spain,
Greece and Portugal are low down the EU table of contribution
scales, with employers paying much of the burden.
</P>
<P>
David Formosa, senior researcher at Mercer, said: "Despite the
pressures for tax harmonization, it's unlikely the high tax
countries will make significant reductions in the near future."

<P>
"Generous social security systems will be hard to cut back," he

<HEADLINE> UNICEF, Panama Launch Regional Survey on Children in L.America, Caribbean </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, June 12 (Xinhua) -- The United Nations Children
's Fund (UNICEF) and Panama Monday launched a regional survey on
children in Latin America and the Caribbean, the UNICEF said here.
</P>
<P>
The survey was launched in Panama City by Panamanian President
Mireya Moscoso and UNICEF Regional Director Per Engebak.
</P>
<P>
The study, called "Voices of Children and Adolescents in Latin
America and the Caribbean," was developed among some 13,000
children in both rural and urban areas in 20 countries of Latin
America, the Caribbean, Portugal and Spain.
</P>
<P>
The children, aged 9-18, were 50 percent boys and 50 percent
girls, and they were corresponding to a population group of 103
million.
</P>
<P>
For the analysis of the results, the age bracket 9-13 and 14-
18 were used, and results were further segmented by age, sex,
rural/urban residence and socio-economic level -- high, medium and
low.
</P>
<P>
Several countries in the region will present the adoption of
the report to the specific country situation in the framework of
which the participation of prominent social and political
personalities is being considered.
</P>
<P>
The executive director of the UNICEF, Carol Bellamy, said, "
the undertaking of this regional survey is a very exciting example
of how important it is to allow children and adolescents to voice
their opinions on the very issues which affect them -- such as the
quality of their education, their physical safety and their access
to information on their rights."
</P>
<P>
"Children are not only our future, they are our present and we
need to start taking their voices very seriously," Bellamy said. "
In September 2001, the U.N. will be reviewing the commitments
which governments have made at the World Summit for Children. This
survey is just one more step towards allowing youth to be active
participants in the process."
</P>
<P>
The main findings of the survey will be made by the UNICEF's
regional director Engebak, who will hand the report over the
Panamanian president.

<HEADLINE> Bomb Blast Could Affect S. African Tourism: Official </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, June 12 (Xinhua) -- The car-bomb explosion
outside a popular restaurant in Cape Town on Saturday night could
affect tourism in South Africa, Cape Town tourism manager Sheryl
Ozinsky said on Monday.
</P>
<P>
He said every bomb blast and every incident of crime affected
tourism and the confidence of visitors.
</P>
<P>
"We are appalled at the latest incident. Thank God no one was
badly injured," Ozinsky said. "We really need to get these
perpetrators behind bars."
</P>
<P>
Two people, including a five-year-old child, were treated for
shock when the device detonated outside New York Bagels and Sit-in
Deli Restaurant around 8:00 p.m. on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Police have established that the car, a red Toyota Corolla, in
which the bomb had been placed, had been hijacked in Diepriver on
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
On that day two men robbed a 33-year-old man of his car when he
stopped in Ruchill Street around 8:00 p.m.
</P>
<P>
The motorist had been closely questioned by police but was
unable to identify the hijackers as they wore masks.
</P>
<P>
Several witnesses have given police information about the blast
but investigators remain in the dark about possible motives for
the attack.

<HEADLINE> Two S. African Opposition Parties to Cooperate in Local Elections </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, June 12 (Xinhua) -- The South African opposition
Democratic Party (DP) leader Tony Leon said Monday it was possible
for the New National Party (NNP) to consider his party's proposals
on cooperation in the November local government elections.
</P>
<P>
In a statement issued after a meeting with NNP leader Marthinus
van Schalkwyk, Leon warned, however, that the DP was not prepared
to change the basis of the agreement between the parties in the
Western Cape coalition government.
</P>
<P>
Their talks followed a DP federal council proposal on Sunday
that the NNP fight the poll under the DP banner.
</P>
<P>
Van Schalkwyk rejected this as "either extreme arrogance or
politically naive", and the NNP also threatened to reduce the
number of DP members in the Western Cape cabinet.
</P>
<P>
Leon said his talks with Van Schalkwyk were conducted in a
"positive atmosphere".
</P>
<P>
"I expect that the NNP will table a response to the DP proposal
and this will be considered," he said.
</P>
<P>
"I believe it is possible for the DP and the NNP to take
further the proposals made yesterday at the DP federal council,"
he said.
</P>
<P>
The DP, however, remained totally committed to consolidating
the opposition in South Africa and would continue to work toward
this goal, he said.
</P>
<P>
The DP has four out of 12 members in the coalition cabinet in
Western Cape.
</P>
<P>
Leon said on Sunday that the best way to ensure that democracy
worked was to build an opposition that could bring the ruling
African National Congress below 50 percent of the vote.
</P>
<P>
"It makes no sense for the DP and the NNP to continue fighting
for the support of opposition voters. It is time to put South
Africa first," Leon said.
</P>
<P>
The DP was recognized as the leading opposition party by South
Africans from across the political spectrum.
</P>
<P>
"It makes no sense to give up this clear identity and our
sharply defined message of strong, effective and principled
opposition. It is thus the DP's duty to lead the consolidation of
the opposition," he said.

<HEADLINE> Illegal Aliens Apply for Resident Permits in S. Africa </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESUBURG, June 12 (Xinhua) -- Illegal aliens have flooded
the South African Home Affairs Department with residence permit
applications since a Constitutional Court ruling suspended certain
sections of the Aliens Control Act last year.
</P>
<P>
Briefing a parliament committee on proposed amendments to the
Act, home affairs legal officer David Ramagalela said Monday the
court's suspension of article 25 (9)(b) of the act had effectively
forced his department to issue immigration papers to thousands of
foreigners married to South Africans.
</P>
<P>
Many of the foreigners had not been married to South African
spouses at the time they entered the country, but were now able to
apply for residence permits under the terms of last year's ruling,
Ramagalela said.
</P>
<P>
While many of the illegal foreigners were suspected of being
involved in illegal activities, it was difficult to refuse a
permit on the basis of unproven allegations, he said.
</P>
<P>
The Constitutional Court last year ruled that some of the
provisions of the Aliens Control Act infringed on the right of
South Africans who were married to foreigners to live with their
spouses.
</P>
<P>
Constitutional Court Judge Kate O'Regan noted in her ruling
last year that the act allowed no automatic right to a residence
permit, but required that each application be considered on merit.
</P>
<P>
O'Regan said the past practice had forced South Africans who
were married to foreign spouses to either go abroad with their
partners, or remain behind alone, pending the outcome of the
application.
</P>
<P>
The committee is trying to introduce amendments to the act
which will justify the refusal of a temporary residence permit.
</P>
<P>
Earlier, committee members -- with the exception of the
Democratic Party -- voted in favor of the Identification Amendment
Bill, which provides for the cessation of all forms of
identification except bar-coded green ID books.

<HEADLINE> Angola on Alert of Possible Food Crisis in Central Highland </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUANDA, June 12 (Xinhua) -- Angola's health services have
warned that there could be a food crisis in the next three months
in the country's central highland, especially in Huambo Province,
following the reduction of international aid, the official news
agency Angop reported Monday.
</P>
<P>
The humanitarian aid including the basic necessities
distributed by the World Food Program (WFP) to the central Huambo
Province has been reduced by 75 percent since May which the health
services said was the main cause of the food crisis in Huambo, a
province that suffered the most fierce civil conflicts in the past
25 years.
</P>
<P>
The crisis could affect over 1.6 million people, with the
300,000 displaced persons living in the central highland being the
hardest hit victims, said the health services.
</P>
<P>
The reduction of the humanitarian aid to Huambo is due to an
accord between the Huambo provincial government and the WFP, the
report said.
</P>
<P>
But some non-governmental organizations (NGO) considered the
accord as " extemporary" and would lead to a "totally ruined"
result.
</P>
<P>
The Representative of an Italian NGO said that the next three
months could be "dark" in terms of food security for the
population living in Huambo, adding that it is worrying that the
WFP reduced the aid from 4,000 tons to 1,100 tons per month to
Huambo in a period without good perspective in agricultural
production.
</P>
<P>
According to statistics, 57 children in the central hospital of
Huambo died of malnutrition from January to May, while other 366
are being treated in the hospital. During the same period,
nutritional centers in the Huambo City, capital of the province,
have lodged 9,560 children suffering from malnutrition.

CAIRO, June 12 (Xinhua) -- The following are economic briefs
from the Middle East countries.
</P>
<P>
ANKARA -- Turkey is taking advantage of its rich geothermal
resources for heating and other purposes.
</P>
<P>
Minister of Energy and Natural Resources Cumhur Ersumer, who
attended the World Geothermal Congress in Japan, said that Turkey
is ranked the fifth among the countries using geothermal energy for
heating and is expected to become the first in 2010.
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
ABU DHABI -- Demand for assembled and compact PCs is expected to
grow rapidly in the United Arab Emirates (UAE) as Dubai prepares to
make information technology its engine of growth.
</P>
<P>
More than 1.4 million PC units were shipped to the Middle East
and North Africa region last year and the recent policy initiatives
in Dubai, Egypt and Bahrain will push overall sales further.
</P>
<P>
An ongoing IT exhibition, staged at the Dubai World Trade
Center, is a clear indication of the increasing use of personal
computers and the subscriber base for the Internet, which is
currently estimated at 160,000.
</P>
<P>
The UAE has registered remarkable growth in the use of Internet,
which is bound to result in incremental PC and accessory sales in
the long run, especially when shopping online and other virtual
activities become a normal day-to-day activity.
</P>
<P>
CAIRO -- Arab investment in Egypt stood at 3.92 billion U.S.
dollars at the end of 1999.
</P>

<HEADLINE> India Reiterates Support for Sri Lanka's Unity </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
COLOMBO, June 12 (Xinhua) -- Visiting Indian External Minister
Jaswant Singh Monday reiterated India's support for the unity,
sovereignty and territorial integrity of Sri Lanka which has been
troubled by an upsurge in the long-running civil war.
</P>
<P>
Singh made clear India's stand during his discussions with Sri
Lankan President Kumaratunga and Foreign Minister Kadirgamar, said
a Sri Lanka-India joint statement released at the end of Singh's
two-day visit.
</P>
<P>
The statement said Singh expressed "the continued commitment of
the Government of India to the unity, sovereignty and territorial
integrity of Sri Lanka."
</P>
<P>
He also conveyed the good wishes and support of the Indian
government to the restoration of a lasting peace through a
possible political process which would result in a settlement
satisfactory to all communities.
</P>
<P>
Singh is the first Indian minister to visit Sri Lanka since
April when the civil war flared up between government troops and
the separatist rebels of Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE).
</P>
<P>
President Kumaratunga apprised Singh of the current war
situation and political developments, including the consultations
between the government and other political parties and the
facilitation efforts of Norway.
</P>
<P>
Kumaratunga welcomed India's offer to be of assistance in the
humanitarian as well as economic sphere to ease and constraints
that may be currently faced by Sri Lanka, the statement said.
</P>
<P>
India has ruled out military involvement in the island nation's
civil war which the LTTE rebels are fighting for a separate
homeland for minority Tamils in the island's north and east since
1983.
</P>
<P>
However, India has been in close contact with the Sri Lankan
government and promised brokering peace and humanitarian
assistance if asked.
</P>
<P>
Singh brought a credit amounting to 100 million U.S. dollars
from India during this visit, as well as the possibilities of Sri
Lanka's purchasing wheat, rice and sugar on a counter trade basis
from India.
</P>
<P>
During his visit, Singh also met opposition leader Ranil
Wickremesinghe as well as representatives from other political
parties.
</P>
<P>
Singh, who came here Sunday afternoon, is scheduled to return
to New Delhi Monday evening.

Lhasa, June 12 (Xinhua) -- No deaths have been reported on the
June 10 landslide in eastern Tibet as all residents near the scene
of the landslide have been rushed to safe areas, local media
reported today.
</P>
<P>
The landslide occurred in Yigong Township in Bomi County on
April 9, destroying seven kilometers of highways, blocking the
Yigong River and leaving more than 4,000 residents homeless.
</P>
<P>
The water level of the river-turned Lake has continued to rise
despite a ditch diverting water from the blocked river dug out by
local soldiers and civilians with the help of a team of engineers
dispatched by the State Flood Control Headquarters.
</P>
<P>
On June 8, high temperature led to the melting of a
considerable amount of ice and snow in the nearby mountains. The
water level of the lake rose dramatically.
</P>
<P>
On the evening of June 10, the torrent waters from the lake
completely destroyed the ditch. Nearby roads, bridges and

<HEADLINE> Estrada Vows to Defend National Sovereignty </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, June 12 (Xinhua) -- Philippine President Joseph Estrada
renewed Monday his commitment to defend the nation's sovereignty
even as he called on the Filipino people to stand united against
the bigger war of eradicating poverty in the country.
</P>
<P>
In his speech at the main program and parade at Rizal Park in
Manila commemorating the 102nd anniversary of Philippine
Independence, the president expressed confidence that this goal
can be achieved with the support of the people.
</P>
<P>
"We commemorate the 102nd year of our independence today firm
in the conviction that we will overcome. We will face the
challenges and we will seize the opportunities that have been
denied us in the past," the president said.
</P>
<P>
According to the president, the nation today is facing
obstacles to its progress, including challenges to peace and order,
the economy, and territorial integrity.
</P>
<P>
Many of these problems, he noted, stemmed from decades of
official neglect, which his administration is trying to correct
now.
</P>
<P>
But the biggest problem, the president said, is to have the
Filipino people unite behind the government as it works to address
the causes of poverty.
</P>
<P>
His administration, he said, will continue to pursue poverty
alleviation and to improve the quality of life of the people.
</P>
<P>
The president said he has placed the poor at the center of the
government's development efforts, and mobilized the entire
government machinery to implement this pro-poor agenda.
</P>
<P>
However, Estrada stressed that the government will not be
intimidated by groups out to sow terror and violence. "We will not
be enslaved by fear and intimidation," he said.
</P>
<P>
The president said he must fulfill his duty and lead the police
and military in defending the nation's sovereignty from all
threats.

January to March this year, or 1,886 more than the 228,424
deployed over the same period of 1999.
</P>
<P>
Herrera, meanwhile, said the raging armed conflict in Mindanao
would force more Filipinos to seek employment overseas.
</P>
<P>
To help ease unemployment in Mindanao, Herrera urged the
agencies responsible for rehabilitation work in strife-torn areas
to give priority employment to residents displaced from their
homes and livelihood.
</P>
<P>
"Labor-intensive rehabilitation projects, particularly those
involving the restoration of damaged public infrastructure, should
be encouraged to provide emergency employment to evacuees,"
Herrera said.
</P>
<P>
Labor officials earlier predicted an increase in unemployment
in Mindanao because of the continuing military offensives against
the Moro Islamic Liberation Front (MILF).
</P>
<P>
The offensive on MILF positions have caused the evacuation of
at least 500,000 civilians since April 27, when the military
launched attacks on rebel encampments along the Narciso Ramos
Highway.

<HEADLINE> Philippines to File Charges Against Virus Author </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, June 12 (Xinhua) -- The Philippine government said
Monday it will file charges against suspected computer hacker Onel
de Guzman before June 15 to formally end its month-long probe on
the tagged author of the "I Love You" virus.
</P>
<P>
Federico Opinion, director of the National Bureau of
Investigation(NBI), said this will give enough time for
authorities to indict Guzman in court before President Joseph
Estrada's scheduled trip to the United States in July.
</P>
<P>
According to Opinion, the president might be grilled by the
American press during his visit to the United States due to the
absence of Philippine laws to prosecute cyber crimes following the
proliferation of the "Love Bug" virus.
</P>
<P>
The damage caused by the virus is estimated to be in the
billions of U.S. dollars after it infected millions of computers
around the world starting May 4.
</P>
<P>
The virus was later traced to the Philippines, particularly to
the house of Guzman's family in Manila. The NBI raided the Guzman
residence on May 8.
</P>
<P>
Opinion said the charges t be filed against Guzman might
include theft, malicious mischief, and violation of the credit
card law.
</P>
<P>
"The charges are still under study. This is a combined legal
study by the Department of Justice and the NBI to ensure an
airtight case against Guzman," said Opinion.
</P>
<P>
The NBI is basing its charges against Guzman on his graduation
thesis proposal which was rejected. In his proposal, he reportedly
described the virus. The NBI is also basing its case on the fact
that virus attack was traced to his house's phone number.

<HEADLINE> Uganda to Double Cargo Transport Via Tanzanian Port </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, June 12 (Xinhua) -- A senior Ugandan official
has said that Uganda has planned to increase cargo handled through
Tanzania's Dar es Salaam Port from the current 15,000 tons to
30,000 tons per month by December 2000.
</P>
<P>
The East African, a Nairobi-based English weekly, Monday quoted
the resident representative of the Uganda Railways Corporation in
Tanzania Godfrey Tindimwebwa as saying that the Dar port handled
an average of 4,000 to 5,000 tons of Ugandan cargoes monthly in
1996 and 1997, the amount has been increased to between 15,000 and
22,000 tons a month at present.
</P>
<P>
The official said that many Ugandan businessmen have resorted
to the Dar port because it is less congested than the traditional
port of Mombasa in Kenya though clearing goods through the Mombasa
port is cheaper.
</P>
<P>
It costs 832 U.S. dollars to clear and transport a 20-foot
container from Mombasa to Kampala, Tindimwebwa said, adding that
while it costs about 1,534 dollars to clear and ship the same
container from Dar to Kampala.
</P>
<P>
While Mombasa may be cheaper than Dar, "businessmen worry more
about timely delivery of cargo," he said, adding "what a customer
wants is safety to goods, and the shortest transit time."
</P>
<P>
He said he is hopeful that handling and transportation costs of
Ugandan cargoes via Dar port will go down after negotiations with
the Tanzania Railways Corporation and the Tanzania Harbor
Authority.

<HEADLINE> Former University Don to Lead Center-Left Party in Ghana Poll </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, June 12 (Xinhua) -- A former university don has been
elected as the presidential candidate for the center-left
Convention People's Party (CPP) to contest the December's
elections in Ghana, the Ghana News Agency reported on Monday.
</P>
<P>
Professor George Hagan, former dean of the Institute of African
Studies, University of Ghana, won 58.8 percent of the vote of the
delegates of his party in a run-off on Sunday and immediately
named Alhaji Ibrahim Mahama, a lawyer who supported him in the
run-off, as his running mate.
</P>
<P>
The CPP is an off-shoot of a party with the same name that was
founded and led by Ghana's first president Kwame Nkrumah who was
ousted in a coup engineered by the Central Intelligence Agency of
the United States in 1966.
</P>
<P>
Nkrumah, a fiery socialist, died in Romania in 1972.
</P>
<P>
The party has been struggling to regain its feet in recent
times. Its off-shoot, the People's National Party, won the poll in
1979 but was ousted by President Jerry Rawlings in the 1981
elections.
</P>
<P>
The CPP is the fifth party to declare their candidates for the
December elections.
</P>
<P>
President Rawlings had announced that he would not participate
in the contest. His party, the National Democratic Congress, has
nominated Vice President John Mills as its presidential candidate.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the center-right New Patriotic Party (NPP) has
nominated John Kufuor, the United Ghana Movement, a break-away
group of the NPP, has elected Charles Wereko-Brobby, and the
People's National Convention, a break-way of the CPP, has named
Edward Mahama as candidates.

</P>
<P>
The workshop, the first of its kind in Kenya, is a result of a
previous visit by a SELA delegation to Kenya in May 1999 to
explore possibilities of promoting cooperation between Latin
American countries and the African continent.
</P>
<P>
"This is a critical conference for Kenya, which will boost the
country's industrial transformation and poverty eradication,"
said Kenya's Minister for Planning Gideon Okemo when officially
opening the workshop.
</P>
<P>
SELA, a regional inter-governmental organization, groups 28
Latin American and Caribbean countries with an aim to promote
economic cooperation between its member states.
</P>
<P>
Small and medium-sized enterprises employ about 61 percent of
labor force in Kenya and contribute to 18 percent of the country's
gross domestic product, according to the Labor and Human Resource
Development Ministry.

<TEXT>
<P>
MOGADISHU, June 12 (Xinhua) -- The loud noise of heavy machine
guns and assault rifles could be heard on Sunday night around the
former presidential palace in central Mogadishu, which is now
resided by faction leader Hussein Mohamed Aidid.
</P>
<P>
Eyewitnesses said there had been an exchange of fire between

</P>
<P>
There was no word of casualties over the fighting on Sunday
night, however, there had been some damage to the walls of
buildings around the area where the fighting took place.
</P>

sources said.
</P>
<P>
According to the local daily Qaran published on Monday, the
mutineers are complaining about lack of proper care from Aidid.

There has been no word as yet from Hussein Aidid himself over
the fighting and his relation with the militiamen.
</P>
<P>
The mutineers looted the former presidential palace four days
ago, taking away ammunition, furniture and everything they could
lay their hands on, in protest against Aidid's treatment towards
them.

<HEADLINE> Putin Urges Effort to Strengthen Russia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, June 12 (Xinhua) -- President Vladimir Putin urged
Russians on Monday to make their country a united and strong power,
Interfax News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
Putin made the appeal in a speech delivered at a banquet
marking the 10th anniversary of the adoption of the Declaration of
Russia's Sovereignty, it reported.
</P>
<P>
The Supreme Soviet of Russia, then a republic within the
Soviet Union, passed the document on June 12, 1990, proclaiming "
absolute sovereignty" of Russia over the Soviet Union and setting
the pace for the eventual disintegration of the Union.
</P>
<P>
June 12 was originally known as Independence Day for Russia,
but authorities later renamed it National Day on the grounds that
the country has never been a colony.
</P>
<P>
The document completed the entire epoch and set Russia on a new
course of development, said Putin.
</P>
<P>
People thought it simple to build a new state 10 years ago, but
the illusions had to be given up quickly, Putin admitted.
</P>
<P>
"Now, we know how hard it is to reform the economy," he noted.
</P>
<P>
Putin took over from Boris Yeltsin as Russia's second
president since the breakup of the Soviet Union on December 26,
1991. He was officially sworn in early last month.
</P>
<P>
Yeltsin, who resigned abruptly on New Year's Eve and appointed
Putin as the acting president, attended Monday's banquet at the
Kremlin, Interfax reported.
</P>
<P>
In the speech, Putin said he encountered many disappointed and
confused people during his tour around the country.
</P>
<P>
"Our sacred duty is to show them the way to the end of the
tunnel today," he said. "Together, we will make Russia a united
and strong power."

<HEADLINE> Capital Market to Spur Development In Western China (2) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Scholars also suggest that western China should issue financial
commercial bonds and take the lead to issue bonds for
construction of local basic projects.
</P>
<P>
Venture capital investment funds should be established to
support the development of high-tech and new industries in western
China, they added. Funds for the development of western China,
however, cannot be provided solely by the State.
</P>
<P>
"Western development initiatives will be a daydream without
investment, making it an urgent necessity to boost the capital
market," said Wei Houkai, a research fellow from the CASS Western
Development Research Center.
</P>
<P>
People have increased their deposits in recent years and it is
an ideal choice to invest the deposits in the capital market,
economic experts said.
</P>
<P>
Restructuring the economic system will also provide a huge
demand for the surge of the western region capital market.
</P>
<P>
Authorities said that the conditions for a soaring capital
market have already become mature in western China, citing that
the area already has securities and market intermediaries. Western
China can learn from eastern China in developing its capital
market.

<HEADLINE> Verdict Hailed for Judging in Light of Theory of Law (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 12 (Xinhua)-- As there are no written laws to
decide a case involving a trade mark case between a Hong Kong
company and a Guangdong company, judges from China's Supreme
People's Court decided to pass their judgment on the case. This
has been hailed by law experts at a recent law seminar in Beijing.
</P>
<P>
This case demonstrates the authority of the supreme court in
interpreting laws when no formal laws exist.
</P>
<P>
Yang Zhenshan, law professor from the China University of
Political Science and Law, pointed out that the judgment provides
a good precedent in integrating Chinese judicial practice with
international practice.
</P>
<P>
According to the supreme court, the relevant facts in the case
are as follows:
</P>
<P>
The trade mark TMT and other two were designed, used and
registered abroad by the Hong Kong-based TMT Company.

<HEADLINE> Verdict Hailed for Judging in Light of Theory of Law (2) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Twenty years ago, TMT authorized Guangdong Light Industrial
Products Imports &AMP; Exports Co. to register the trade marks in
China with the agreement that the registered trade marks would be
exclusive TMT products. It was difficult for an overseas firm to
register a trade mark in China when the country was just
initiating economic reforms in the early 1980s.
</P>
<P>
The fact that the TMT trade marks had two users gave rise to
the disputes between the two companies.
</P>
<P>
In 1998, TMT Company took out a lawsuit against the Guangdong
company and in October 1998, Guangdong Provincial Higher People's
Court ruled that the Guangdong company return the trade marks to
TMT and TMT compensate the former a sum of 500,000 yuan.
</P>
<P>
The Guangdong company appealed against the ruling to the
supreme court. On May 15 this year, the supreme court gave the
judgment that the Guangdong company return the trade marks to TMT
and TMT compensate the former a sum of 2.5 million yuan.
</P>
<P>
Experts believe that the verdict will play a positive role in
enacting entrustment laws in China.

that nine-year compulsory education is made available to all the
school-age children, and illiteracy among youths and adults is
eradicated, Li said. The central government and local governments
should continue to support education in the west. Schools in

Border Gate between Syria and the Israeli-occupied Golan Heights
since early morning, Israel Radio reported.
</P>
<P>
They were waiting for making their journey to Damascus for the
funeral of Assad, who died of heart attack Saturday at age 69.
</P>
<P>
However, among the 180 Druze who were permitted to travel for
this purpose by the Israeli Interior Ministry, only some 50 were
allowed to cross over by the Syrian side. The Syrians did not give
the reason for turning back the others.
</P>
<P>
Israeli soldiers and riot police tried to block the crowd, but
many of the Druze vented their anger and frustration at them. Some
pushing and shoving broke out between the two sides.
</P>
<P>
There was no report of casualties.
</P>
<P>
Israel captured the Golan from Syria in the 1967 Middle East war
and the return of the strategic plateau remains the major
contention point between Israeli and Syrian negotiators since they
began peace talks in the early 1990s.
</P>
<P>
There are nearly 17,000 Druze residents on the highland.Some 3,
000 of them have Israeli citizenship, but most are still loyal to
Syria and President Assad.
</P>
<P>
Druze villages on Golan had declared three days of mourning over
the death of Assad, and thousands of residents rallied in public
places for mourning, holding Assad's pictures embroidered with
black ribbon.
</P>
<P>
Syrian national flags also flew at half-staff, a move openly
challenging Israel's 1981 decision to annex Golan.
</P>
<P>
To facilitate Druze's travel, Israeli Interior Minister Natan
Sharansky Sunday ordered his officials to expedite the application
process for one-time permit to cross over to Syria. Those attending
the funeral are due to return Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Students, Red Cross officials and religious figures are usually
granted to enter Syria through border crossings between Syria and
the Golan Heights.

CAIRO, June 12 (Xinhua) -- The following are the economic news
briefs from the Middle East countries.
</P>
<P>
ABU DHABI -- The United Arab Emirates supported the increase of
Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC)'s crude oil by
500,000 barrels per day.
</P>
<P>
Officials said that this proposed increase is consistent with an
accord reached by the world oil cartel in Vienna last March over
the output increase if prices rise above 28 U.S. dollars a barrel
for 20 consecutive days.
</P>
<P>
It was expected that OPEC will be forced to increase production
if the world oil prices maintained their current levels until the
next
meeting of OPEC.
</P>
<P>
CAIRO -- A delegation of Saudi Arab's Economic and Industrial
Chamber will arrive in Cairo on June 20 for a three-day visit to
explore investment opportunities in Egypt.
</P>
<P>
ABU DHABI -- The United Arab Emirates granted two batches of
more than 7.435 billion dirhams (about 20,5 million U.S. dollars)
in loans to Jordan for projects in cultivating agricultural lands,
building dams and developing the basin of Yarmuk river.
</P>
<P>
ABU DHABI -- Demand for personal computers is expected to grow
rapidly in the United Arab Emirates (UAE) as the country prepares
to make information technology its engine of growth.
</P>
<P>
Internet users are currently estimated at 160,000 in UAE, which
is among the countries where the use of internet has registered
remarkable growth. "It is bound to result in incremental sales of
PCs in the long run, especially when e-business becomes a normal
day-to-day activity," one manager said.

<HEADLINE> TNC Happy with Chinese Partnership: Director </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SINGAPORE, June 12 (Xinhua) -- A director from The Nature
Conservancy (TNC), an international non-governmental organization,
declared Monday that her organization is happy with its Chinese
partnership in promoting nature conservation and has made very
good successes in its project in China's Yunnan Province.
</P>
<P>
"The thing really remarkable is that it is really a joint
project and we are working very closely together just like in a
family," Carol M. Fox , director for Program Development Asia/

<P>
Fox said a Chinese delegation of six high level officials
visited the United States some time ago to look at nature parks
and check up with nature conservation and they made a beautiful
report after return.
</P>
<P>
"The biggest challenge for all of us is that it is moving so
quickly in China," she said, noting she was told during her last
trip to Yunnan that the tourist number in the LiJiang area has
gone up from 4,000 to four million in the past few years.
</P>
<P>
She said her organization is involved in a master plan for the
area which is about the size of Ireland or of the U.S. state of
West Virginia, adding "we'll get ready the vast plan ready by
September 30 this year and that will be incorporated in the 10th
Five-Year Plan of China."
</P>
<P>
According to Fox, The Nature Conservancy, with 2,200 full-time
staff and 1,000,000 membership, is an international non-profit
organization and has been the private sector leader in preserving
Earth's rare plants, animals, and ecosystems by protecting the
lands and waters they need to survive.
</P>
<P>
Its protection projects with partner organizations cover more
than 10 million acres in the U.S. and Canada, and more than 80
million acres in 26 countries in Latin America and the Caribbean,
and Micronesia, Melanesia and Asia.
</P>
<P>
The TNC Asia Pacific Council which is co-chaired by Singapore
Senior Minister Lee Kuan Yew and Goldman Sachs group's Chairman
and CEO Henry M. Paulson, consists of more than forty top public
and private sector leaders from Asia, the U.S. and Europe.
</P>
<P>
At its inaugural meeting here in August, members of the TNC
Asia Pacific Council will review major conservation and economic
development issues and make recommendations for collaborative
conservation action across the region, a press release from TNC
said.

<HEADLINE> Poverty Alleviation No.1 Priority of Aid: Japanese Ambassador </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, June 12 (Xinhua) -- Poverty alleviation takes the
highest priority of Japan's aid to Bangladesh, Japanese Ambassador
in Dhaka Shigeharu Maruyama told the United News of Bangladesh
Monday.
</P>
<P>
Outlining the Country Aid Plan for Bangladesh, the envoy said
agricultural and rural development, improvement of social areas,
basic infrastructure and disaster management are also among the
priorities of Japanese economic cooperation in the country.
</P>
<P>
Japan is examining scope for more cooperation in basic
infrastructure areas like power generation, rail and road
transport and telecommunications, he said.
</P>
<P>
Maruyama said Japan is also interested in assisting Bangladesh
to combat serious air pollution in Dhaka and enormous arsenic
problem that affects roughly 20 million people in the country.
</P>
<P>
Japan's loan aid to Bangladesh amounted to 3 billion U.S.
dollars between 1994 and 1998, while its grants figured 2.8
billion dollars during the same period.
</P>
<P>
Referring to the investment environment in the country, the
Japanese envoy regarded political unrest, image problem and
inadequate infrastructure as factors that hinder growth of foreign
investments, including those from Japan.

<HEADLINE> Anti-Budget General Strike Observed in Bangladesh </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, June 12 (Xinhua) -- Countrywide anti-budget general
strike called by the combined opposition was observed almost
peacefully Monday, partially disrupting daily life and business.
</P>
<P>
The four-party opposition alliance comprising the Bangladesh
Nationalist Party, Jatiya Party, Jamaat-e-Islami and Islami Oikya
Jote (Islami Solidarity Front), called for the dawn-to-dusk
shutdown against what they said government's "anti-people budget
for 2000-2001."
</P>
<P>
In the capital, though most of the shops and offices were
closed, some shops, particularly hardware stores, offices and
banks were seen open under half shutter.
</P>
<P>
People were seen moving from one place to another boarding
various modes of vehicles, including state-run and private buses.
</P>
<P>
Government offices were in operation with comparatively thin
attendance. Educational institutions were closed during the strike.
</P>
<P>
Pro-strike activists brought out processions in different parts
of the capital. However, there was no report of any untoward
incident.
</P>
<P>
Finance Minister Shah AMS Kibria last Thursday placed a
national budget of 8.5 billion U.S. dollars for fiscal 2000-2001
in the parliament, showing an overall deficit of 3.7 billion
dollars.
</P>
<P>
The finance minister proposed to meet the big deficit from
foreign grants and loans, domestic sources and from bank
borrowings.
</P>
<P>
The Federation of Bangladesh Chambers of Commerce and Industry
(FBCCI) has expressed concern at deteriorating fiscal deficit and
higher borrowings by the government from banking sector. In its
initial reaction on the budget, FBCCI said on Sunday that
borrowing by the government will crowd out the private sector from
settling funds from the banks.
</P>
<P>
FBCCI also expressed its concern over the fact that the budget
does not provide definite guideline for creation of employment
opportunities and growth of manufacturing sector.
</P>
<P>
However, FBCCI appreciated the new budget for providing
incentives for capital market development, relief for the small
tax payers, widening the tax-net and further streamlining the tax
administration.
</P>
<P>
It also hailed increased allocation for education and healthy
sectors and further strengthening of special measures addressing
poor.

<HEADLINE> Consultative Group on Mozambique Successful: Minister </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MAPUTO, June 12 (Xinhua) -- Mozambican Finance Minister Luisa
Diogo has commended the World Bank's Consultative Group meeting on
Mozambique held in Paris last Thursday and Friday as "very well".
</P>
<P>
In addition to the financial pledges made, the meeting also
reached the consensus that under the current conditions Mozambique
will have difficulty in attaining a two-digit economic growth if
there are no changes in certain areas, she was quoted by Monday's
independent newsheet Metical as saying.
</P>
<P>
Diogo listed the infrastructure of the economy, agricultural
policy and regional imbalance as some of the areas that need
reforms and improvement.
</P>
<P>
There was consensus that there must be "improved performance in
these areas in order to step up the rate of growth", she said.
</P>
<P>
The Consultative Group meeting brings together all Mozambique's
major international partners, and is the forum where the financing
needs of the economy are discussed.
</P>
<P>
According to Diogo, donors and funding agencies gathering in
Paris had promised to offer 530 million U.S. dollars (75 percent
in grants and 25 percent in soft loans) to Mozambique this year,
more than the 504 million dollars requested by the Mozambican
government.
</P>
<P>
Diogo said, the Paris meeting gave "indicative figures" of 560
million dollars in 2001, of which 75 to 80 percent will be in the
form of grants. The figure is also more than the 514 million
dollars mentioned in the government's document submitted to the
meeting.
</P>
<P>
"There were no deep divergences among the country's foreign
partners," the minister said, noting that "the main differences
were in how to implement the recommendations."
</P>
<P>
"Some of the Nordic countries were in favor of strengthening
direct funding for the budget. Others stressed a sectoral
approach. Others thought that, before embracing the model of
increased direct funding for the budget, there must be
improvements in budgetary management," she said.
</P>
<P>
The Mozambican government is in favour of a gradual approach,
increasing direct funding for the budget "as we improve the
management of the budget", she said.
</P>
<P>
The meeting also recommended that the government should
increase the amount of taxes collected while reducing tax rates,
she said.

<HEADLINE> Nigerian Government Calls to Implement New Minimum Wage </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Lagos, June 12 (Xinhua) -- The Nigerian government has directed
all of its ministries and extra ministerial departments to pay the
new national minimum wage without further delay, the News Agency
of Nigeria reported on Monday.
</P>
<P>
Nigerian Vice President Atiku Abubakar said at a meeting in the
capital Abuja Sunday that the federal ministry of finance had
directed the accountant-general of the federation to make funds
available to the federal establishments to enable them to pay the
new salaries.
</P>
<P>
The federal government was also releasing funds to states to
enable them to implement the new wages in their states, he said.
</P>
<P>
Abubakar gave his assurance that workers in the country would
receive the new minimum wages before the end of this month.
</P>
<P>
The Nigerian government increased the minimum monthly wage to
7,500 naira (75 U. S. dollars) for public servants and to 5,000
naira (50 U. S. dollars) for workers in the public sectors in May.
</P>
<P>
However, some ministers and state governors refused to pay the
new wages on the grounds of insufficient funds.

<HEADLINE> France Conducted Nuclear Tests in Paris Suburb in 1955-1960: Report </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, June 12 (Xinhua) -- The French government conducted some
of its primary nuclear testing in a Paris suburb during 1955-1960,
which could possibly have left the test site contaminated by
radioactive substances, said a report by the daily Le Parisien
Monday.
</P>
<P>
Lucien Beaudouin, a 79-year-old retired engineer at the Atomic
Center of Vaujours in Seine-Saint-Denis north of Paris, said the
Center worked on the effect of nuclear explosives on metals. The
location was well known publicly as a site for testing military
planes.
</P>
<P>
The explosives were reportedly part of the first nuclear bomb
France tested in the Sahara Desert in Algeria in 1960, said
Beaudouin.
</P>
<P>
"All were tested, the iron, the lead and the uranium. But it
was ordinary uranium and we didn't work with plutonium," he added.
</P>
<P>
He said that some tests were conducted underground, and some in
the air, which could have contaminated the surrounding area of the
Center with radioactive substances.
</P>
<P>
"Pieces of uranium shot like rockets in the air. The
disintegration of uranium could have produced other very dangerous
metals and the gas could also have escaped, which was much more
radioactive than uranium," he said.
</P>
<P>
The retired scientist estimated that several kilograms of
uranium could have fallen into the field in a range of from 100 to
150 meters outside the Center.
</P>
<P>
The atomic test center was closed by the French government in
1997 and its 45 hectares of land are up for sale.

<P>
SEOUL, June 12 (Xinhua) -- South Korean officials to be
traveling with President Kim Dae-jung to Pyongyang Tuesday for a
historic summit said Monday they hope the talks will create a
foundation for the North and South of the Korean Peninsula to cope
with the tragedy of national division.
</P>
<P>
However, they cautioned that people should not expect too much
from the forthcoming summit between Kim Dae-jung and Kim Jong Il,
leader of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea.
</P>
<P>
South Korean news agency Yonhap quoted Unification Minister
Park Jae-kyu as saying that the delegation will not hastily pursue
noticeable outcomes during the talks, and will attend them in a
step-by-step manner.
</P>
<P>
Kim Min-ha, senior vice chairman of the Advisory Council on
Democratic and Peaceful Unification, said people should not expect
too much, adding that what is important is that such talks should
continue after the summit and the delegation will do its best in a
calm manner to help make the talks successful.
</P>
<P>
Presidential Chief of Staff Han Kwang-ok hopes the talks will
serve as the first step for the two sides to heal the pain of
separated Korean families and to pursue co-prosperity.
</P>
<P>
On Sunday, Seoul and Pyongyang agreed to postpone their
scheduled landmark summit by one day, from June 12-14 to June 13-
15, at the request of Pyongyang due to technical reasons.

<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, June 12 (Xinhua) -- The following are major news
items in leading U.S. newspapers on Monday.
</P>
<P>
The Washington Post:
</P>
<P>
-- The new high-tech global economy that is pumping up
employment and home ownership in most U.S. cities is also creating
"staggering jumps" more than 1.5 times faster than the rate of
inflation, according to a new study by the Department of Housing
and Urban Development.
</P>
<P>
The New York Times:
</P>
<P>
-- The party and nation that Hafez Assad ruled for 30 years
until his death moved swiftly on Sunday to appoint his son Bashar
as Syria's new president.
</P>
<P>
-- Microsoft is mobilizing a pervasive lobbying and public
relations campaign in an effort to temper the impact of a
potentially devastating federal court ruling and generate positive
public and political opinion.
</P>
<P>
-- According to a new federal report, a warming of the global
climate is likely to have substantial consequences -- for better
and worse -- around the United States in coming decades, including
bumper crops in the heartland, chronic erosion of coasts, summer
water shortages and winter floods in the west and a future New
York city that steams in summer like present-day Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
The Wall Street Journal:
</P>
<P>
-- Regardless of where they live, today's movie fans can use
the Web to access the movie-marketing materials that flood the U.S.
before a film's release. So Hollywood, which used to sell its
movies in the domestic market first, is rushing toward all-at-once
global distribution for many films.

<TEXT>
<P>
CHONGQING, June 12 (Xinhua) -- China plans to foster an active
capital market as part of a national campaign on developing the
country's western area.
</P>
<P>
"The central government is looking into a number of policies to
support the formation and development of the western capital
market," said Gan Fangqian, deputy director of the Regional
Economic Development Department of the State Development Planning
Commission (SDPC), at an International Symposium on developing
China's western region today.

local financial institutions in collecting funds, draw more idle
funds to develop the economy, and encourage more high-tech
companies to be listed on the stock market.
</P>
<P>
"As the largest city in western China, Chongqing is encouraging
more overseas financial institutions to set up business offices
here, setting up regional commercial banks, raising the amount of
funds collected by banks, and making social assets more active,"
said Wang Hongju, vice-mayor of Chongqing Municipality.

Western Chinese provinces and Chongqing can collect funds
through local banks, lotteries, and other kinds of funds, said
Zhang Hanya, director of the Investment Research Institute of the

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 12 (Xinhua) -- Wei Jianxing, a Standing Committee
member of the Political Bureau of the Communist Party of China (
CPC) Central Committee, met with an Indonesian delegation of
leaders of Islamic parties led by Aisyaah Aminy here today.
</P>
<P>
Wei, also a member of the Secretariat of the CPC Central
Committee, stressed that the CPC hopes to conduct new exchanges
and cooperation with all major Indonesian parties on the basis of
the principles of independence, absolute equality, mutual respect
and non-interference into each other's internal affairs.
</P>
<P>
Wei hailed the friendship between China and Indonesia.
Indonesia is one of the earliest countries to establish diplomatic
ties with China, and the two countries were both advocates of the
Bandung Asian-African Conference, he added.
</P>
<P>
During his visit to China in December last year, Indonesian
President Abdurrahman Wahid and Chinese President Jiang Zemin
reached consensus and understanding over the establishment of good-
neighborly bilateral ties of mutual-trust featuring comprehensive
cooperation, Wei said.
</P>
<P>
In May this year, both foreign ministers signed a joint
statement concerning bilateral cooperation in the future, paving
the way for the development of bilateral ties of mutual interest
and cooperation, he noted.
</P>
<P>
Wei pointed out that both China and Indonesia are important
developing countries. The development of friendly cooperative ties
between the two countries is not only in the fundamental interests
of both peoples, but also beneficial to peace and stability in the
region and the world as well.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese government appreciates the Indonesian government's
position on the issue of Taiwan and human rights, he added, hoping
that both countries will enhance friendly cooperation and be good
neighbors and good friends forever.
</P>
<P>
Aminy praised the achievements China has made since it
initiated reforms and opening up twenty years ago, indicating that
the achievements would have been impossible without the forceful
leadership of the CPC.
</P>
<P>
Aminy also highly valued the principles the CPC advocates in
governing party-to-party relations.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 12 (Xinhua) -- By drilling three keyhole-size
holes on the patient's right chest, Chinese doctors have
successfully conducted non-thoracotomy surgery to treat auricular
septal defects, a common congenital heart disease.
</P>
<P>
The doctors inserted a thoracoscope through the hole with a
less than one centimeter in diameter to guide a blockade device
into the cardiac atriums.
</P>
<P>
A healthy person's right and left atriums are separated by a
complete diaphragm. However, auricular septal defects causes
abnormal blood circulation and heart failure.
</P>
<P>
According to today's Beijing-based "Guangming Daily," that the
surgery, conducted on April 30 by doctors at the Cardiovascular
Surgical Department of Xijing Hospital in northwest China's Xi'an
City, is the first of this kind in the world.
</P>
<P>
The 21-year-old female patient was discharged from the hospital
five days after surgery and is reportedly doing well.
</P>
<P>
Compared with traditional surgical method to repair auricular
septal defects, non-thoracotomy surgery can reduce both
operational risks and suffering.

<HEADLINE> Manila Takes "Cooling Off" Period in Hostage Negotiations </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, June 12 (Xinhua) -- The Philippine government said
Monday it is taking three to four days as "cooling off" period in
the negotiations with the Abu Sayyaf to study what options to take
in the wake of the new demands by the group now holding 21
hostages in Sulu.
</P>
<P>
Executive Secretary Ronaldo Zamora told reporters that the
government decided Sunday to let things "cool off" in the meantime
to give the government enough time to examine the new demands made
by the Abu Sayyaf.
</P>
<P>
"We decided we are going to take three to four days off to
review it. Then we will see what has to be done. Basically we
decided yesterday it may be a good idea to let things cool off,
for us to examine these new demands they have made," Zamora said.
</P>
<P>
He also called on the public and the international community to
remain patient as the government exhausts all possible means to
resolve the situation peacefully.
</P>
<P>
Earlier, the Abu Sayyaf claimed it wanted Executive Secretary
Ronaldo Zamora to replace Secretary Robert Aventajado,
presidential flagship projects committee chief, as head of the
government negotiating panel.
</P>
<P>
The Abu Sayyaf slammed Aventajado for hinting at the
possibility of using military means to solve the hostage crisis if
negotiations fail.
</P>
<P>
In Jolo, Sulu, Governor Abdusakur Tan, a member of the
government negotiating panel, said they have not yet received a
formal statement from the Abu Sayyaf that they want Aventajado out
of the panel as chief negotiator.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Press Secretary and Presidential Spokesman Ricardo
Puno said that President Joseph Estrada has not instructed any
change in the membership of the government panel tasked to
negotiate for the safe release of the 21 mostly foreign hostages.
</P>
<P>
But even if there were some changes in the membership, Puno
said, the government will not change its stand on the demands the
Abu Sayyaf had made.
</P>
<P>
However, Puno said the government will remain open to the group
and stressed that it is still keeping all communication lines open.
</P>
<P>
The Abu Sayyaf, which kidnapped the hostages from the Sipadan
Island resort in Malaysia on April 23, was said to have separated
its captives into two groups for fear of government military
rescue operations.

<P>
The code-sharing will initially be on a twice weekly frequency
and will be increased to thrice weekly effective on July 19 when
MAS commences its third service to Beirut.
</P>
<P>
Through this cooperation, both airlines will strengthen their
position in the market between Lebanon and Australia besides
continuing to promote travel between Malaysia and Lebanon, it said.
</P>
<P>
This is another step taken by MAS to further promote the Kuala
Lumpur International Airport (KLIA) as a regional hub, the
statement added.

<HEADLINE> Drugs Abuse on Rise in Kenyan Schools </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, June 12 (Xinhua) -- The use of narcotic drugs in
Kenya's secondary schools and colleges has been increasing as drug
traffickers seek to expand their markets, the country's major
newspaper Daily Nation reported on Monday.
</P>
<P>
According to a Daily Nation investigation team, drugs are cheap
and can be bought in students' dormitory.
</P>
<P>
Solid and bhang are two kinds of drugs being mostly used and
peddled on campus, the team said.
</P>
<P>
"The drugs available include cocaine, heroin and Mandrax
tablets," a consultant psychiatrist at the Jomo Kenyatta
University of Agriculture and Technology was quoted as saying on
condition of anonymity.
</P>
<P>
"I know many cases in which students have had their exams
postponed after making an appeal to psychiatrists that they can
not manage in that state," he said.
</P>
<P>
According to the psychiatrist, some students were already
addicted when joining university and others began using drugs on
campus.
</P>
<P>
However, Vice Chancellor of the University of Agriculture
Ratemo Michieka denied the rampant drug abuse at the institution.
</P>
<P>
"If there are a few cases here, it should not be taken to mean
that the whole student community is involved," Michieka said.
</P>
<P>
The latest statistics by the Anti-Drugs Organization of Kenya
show that over 10 percent of male high school students in Kenya's
Central Province regularly abuse drugs.

<HEADLINE> Talks on Ending Nigeria's Fuel Price Crisis in Deadlock </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, June 12 (Xinhua) -- The Nigerian government and the
Nigeria Labor Congress (NLC) Sunday night ended another round of
negotiations in deadlock in the capital Abuja to conclude the
strike on the petrol price hike, local media reported on Monday.
</P>
<P>
President Olusegun Obasanjo and Vice President Atiku Abubakar
were reportedly in attendance of the negotiation.
</P>
<P>
After the meeting, NLC leader Adams Oshiomhole urged the
country's highest decision-making organ, National Executive
Council (NEC), to convene for finding a way out of the current
crisis.
</P>
<P>
The government gave no new offers during the talks, he said,
adding that NLC accepted nothing above the former price of 20
naira per liter of fuel (one U. S. dollar equals to 100 naira).
</P>
<P>
NLC launched the ongoing strike shortly after the Nigerian
government announced the increase of petrol price by 50 percent to
30 naira per liter on June 1.
</P>
<P>
It is reported that several people have been killed and more
wounded in violence in the strike over the last two days. So far
hundreds of rioters have been arrested.
</P>
<P>
The government announced a five-naira-per-liter reduction for
petrol and diesel, and a 10-naira-per-liter reduction for kerosene
last Thursday, but NLC refused to call off the strike.

<HEADLINE> Over 30,000 Tourists Booked for Kenya </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, June 12 (Xinhua) -- More than 30,000 tourists mainly
from the United Kingdom have made advance bookings with Kenya
Airways to spend their holidays at Kenya's coast beach hotels.
</P>
<P>
The East African Standard newspaper Monday quoted the national
carrier's commercial director Bram Stella as saying that the
tourists are expected to arrive in Kenya in the next five months.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a recent annual meeting of the Kenya Association of
Travel Agency held here, Stella disclosed that about 30,000
tourists are destined to Mombasa, an Indian Oceanic port city in
southeastern Kenya, 2,000 to Malindi and 400 to Lamu, both tourist
spots along the country's coast.
</P>
<P>
At the meeting, Kenyan Tourism Minister Nicholas Biwott urged
association members to adhere to professional ethics and identify
new tourist destinations in the country.
</P>
<P>
The government is formulating a policy framework paper to
enable the promotion of tourist destinations in East Africa, he
said.
</P>
<P>
The Kenya Wildlife Service will this year spend 5 million U.S.
dollars, donated by the European Union, on promoting tourism and
conservation for attracting more overseas tourists to the country.
</P>
<P>
Kenya earned 21.4 billion shillings (about 3 million U.S.
dollars) from tourism in 1999, compared to 17.5 billion shillings
(about 2.5 million dollars) in the previous year, and received
969,300 foreign visitors in 1999 as against 894,300 in 1998.

<HEADLINE> Tanzania Warns Against Foreign Interference in October Elections </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, June 12 (Xinhua) -- Tanzania has warned that no
foreign interference is allowed in the forthcoming general
elections in October so as to guarantee the people to choose their
own leaders freely and fairly, local newspapers reported Monday.
</P>
<P>
President Benjamin Mkapa told a public rally in the inland
capital Dodoma on Sunday that Tanzania appreciates the moral and
financial support from the foreign donors and observers, but that
does not give them the right to interfere in the elections
process.
</P>
<P>
He said donors and observers can communicate with all political
parties in Tanzania, but it should be done lawfully and according
to the set procedures.
</P>
<P>
There are certain election observers who have the habit of
giving instructions and orders to the people or electoral bodies
on how to execute democratic elections, said Mkapa, without
identifying the nationality of these observers.
</P>
<P>
"Let the people choose their own leaders. If you are here as
election observers, do your job, don't teach us politics." he
said.
</P>
<P>
Mkapa also warned Tanzanian political parties against seeking
foreign instructions, saying "parties that receive orders and
directives from abroad would bring back colonization."
</P>
<P>
He promised that the National Electoral Commission will be
provided with sufficient resources to enable it to conduct
elections freely and fairly, cautioning that whoever would breach
the law on the excuse of exercising democracy would be dealt with.
</P>
<P>
Mkapa was chosen by Tanzania's ruling Chama cha Mapinduzi (CCM)
party last Saturday as the sole presidential candidate to run for
his second five- year term in the October 29 general elections.
</P>
<P>
The elections will be the second multi-party elections in
Tanzania since 1995.

<HEADLINE> Funeral for Ann Tse-kai Held in Hong Kong (2) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Ann Tse-kai, a well-known public figure in Hong Kong, was
elected a vice-chairman of the National Committee of the CPPCC in
1993, enjoying the status of a state leader.
</P>
<P>
Ann was also a member of the Standing Committees of the Sixth
and Seventh CPPCC National Committees.
</P>
<P>
Ann Tse-kai was born in Shanghai in 1912. He studied Chinese
literature and economics in his early years, and later learned
foreign languages including English, Japanese, French, German and
Spanish, laying a strong foundation for his later life in
international trade.
</P>
<P>
Ann came to Hong Kong after the Japanese invasion in 1938. He
headed for the southwestern city of Chongqing when Hong Kong
fought a war against Japanese troops in 1941.
</P>
<P>
After the war, Ann returned to Hong Kong and settled down here
in 1949, beginning his success story in the fields of business,
politics and linguistics. He engaged in the textile industry in
Hong Kong in the 1950s, served in Hong Kong as member of the
Legislative Council and Executive Council and chaired the Hong
Kong Trade Development Council and the Federation of Hong Kong
Industries in the 1970s.
</P>
<P>
And in the 1980s, Ann served as a member of the Standing
Committee of the CPPCC National Committee while serving as vice-
chairman of the Committee for Drafting the Basic Law of Hong Kong
Special Administrative Region and chairman of the Consultative
Committee on Hong Kong Basic Law.
</P>
<P>
In the 1970s, Ann made painstaking efforts to promote
development of Hong Kong's foreign trade by traveling around the
world to promote sales of Hong Kong products.

<P>
In the early 1980s when some people in Hong Kong, due to lack
of knowledge about China's policy, were worried about their future
in connection with China resuming the exercise of its sovereignty
over Hong Kong in 1997, Ann was very confident.
</P>
<P>
During his 1982 trip to Beijing, Ann expressed his opinions to
Chinese leaders on the importance of continuance of Hong Kong
economic progress. He wrote articles on interdependence of
economies in Hong Kong and the mainland, calling for strengthening
economic ties.
</P>
<P>
At the second session of the Sixth CPPCC National Committee
held in 1984, Ann put forward 16 suggestions on maintaining Hong
Kong's stability and prosperity.
</P>
<P>
In Hong Kong, Ann was described as a gifted man of great
attainments in languages, classic Chinese, modern Chinese and
statistics and a man who dabbles in medicine, arts, philosophy,
archaeology, economics, literature and music.
</P>
<P>
Starting in 1979, he spent more than four years writing a five-
volume book on Chinese characters in English, which provides a new
and easy way to foreigners learning Chinese. He published a total
of 21 books on the Chinese language during the 16 years from 1979
to 1995.
</P>
<P>
In his last years, Ann showed great concern about the
reunification of the motherland, and wished to see at an early
date the settlement of the Taiwan issue on the basis of the
principle of "one country, two systems."

<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, June 12 (Xinhua) -- Public concerns over labor and
economy related problems have decreased by six percent in the
latest bimonthly opinion survey conducted by the Home Affairs
Bureau (HAB) of Hong Kong, but these two remain the most often
mentioned problems by respondents.
</P>
<P>
Labor-related problems were mentioned by 39 percent of the
respondents. Among this group, 91 percent cited difficulty in
finding jobs, layoffs and underemployment as their main concerns.
</P>
<P>
Economy-related problems, mentioned by 34 percent of the
respondents, ranked the second. Of them, 56 percent were concerned
about the current employment situation or underemployment.
</P>
<P>
The percentage of respondents mentioning environmental
protection related-problems has increased from nine percent in
March to 26 percent in May.
</P>
<P>
A spokesman with HAB said: "While Hong Kong's economy is
recovering well with a GDP growth of 14 percent in the first
quarter, there are certain sectors of the community who have not
yet benefited from the economic recovery such as those who are
unemployed and those with low income."
</P>
<P>
The government has been taking positive steps to help those who
are affected by economic restructuring, and is also determined to
tackle the environmental-related problems, he added.
</P>
<P>
The survey, 88th in a series, was the result of 1,674
interviews conducted over the telephone in May. The interviewees,
aged 15 to 64, were chosen by random sampling through the

<HEADLINE> Likud Watches Syrian Situation Closely: Sharon </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, June 12 (Xinhua) -- The Israeli Likud party is
watching the Syrian situation closely and hoping the new leadership
of Syria would adopt a more flexible policy in striking a peace
deal with Israel, said Likud party leader Ariel Sharon here Monday.
</P>
<P>
"The leadership of Syria is in the process of changes and we
have been watching it closely and we do hope the new leader of
Syria will not follow the hardline policy of former President Hafez
al-Assad because we know Assad very well in the past," Sharon told
a press conference organized by the Association of Foreign Press in
Israel.
</P>
<P>
Sharon made these remarks when asked to comment on the passing
away of Assad and on the ongoing transition of power in Syria.
</P>
<P>
Assad died on Saturday of heart attack and his son Bashar is in
the process of becoming the new president of Syria.
</P>
<P>
Anyway, Sharon said, Israel should wait and see what happens in
Syria before formulating specific policies in solving the
territorial disputes with Syria.
</P>
<P>
But he set "terms" for striking a peace deal with Syria.
</P>
<P>
The "terms" cited by Sharon include that Israel has to stay on
the Golan Heights and must keep Mount Hermon and water resources of
the upper Jordan River to Israel because Israel can not share the
water resources with Syria.
</P>
<P>
All those terms should be the pre-conditions for Israel to
negotiate a settlement of the Golan Heights and force Syria to make
more concessions in negotiations, he said.
</P>
<P>
Sharon criticised Prime Minister Ehud Barak for making too much
promises to Syria while the two countries conducted peace talks,
saying such promises could not serve the interests of Israel.
</P>
<P>
Israel and Syria resumed their peace talks last December, but
halted them after two rounds in the United States, due to Israel's
refusal to hand over to Syria the entire Golan Heights which it
captured in the 1967 Middle East War.
</P>
<P>
Israel completed its troops withdrawal from South Lebanon on May
24 and several days later it also pulled out troops from some
territories on the western foothills of the Mount Hermon.
</P>
<P>
Sharon said the Likud supports private sectors to invest in
Syria, saying economic development in Syria could help it to settle
territorial dispute with Israel.
</P>
<P>
Referring to the Israeli-Palestinian final-status talks, Sharon
said it is hard for the two sides to reach a framework agreement or
a final peace accord in the near future.
</P>
<P>
The fate of Jerusalem, security, right to return for Palestinian
refugees, final borders and water are very complicated issues for
the two sides to settle, he said.
</P>
<P>
The Likud will neither allow Barak to hand over the Jordan River
valley nor the Palestinian villages near Jerusalem to the
Palestinians, he said.
</P>
<P>
The Israel-Palestinian negotiating teams went to the United
States on Sunday and are expected to continue their final-status
talks there from Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Talking about the Barak's coalition crisis, Sharon said Barak is
a good politician but lack of experience.
</P>
<P>
Coalition partners of Shas, National Religious Party and Yisrael
Ba'aliya, joined the opposition on June 7 in the Knesset
(parliament) and voted in favor of a bill asking for dissolving the
Knesset and holding early elections.
</P>
<P>
All the coalition crisis, such as the Shas' demand for more
education allocations, can be solved by certain committees, but
Barak did not pay any attention to them because he only cared about
the peace process, Sharon said.
</P>
<P>
The Likud, as the main opposition party, will do everything
possible to shorten the time of the government, he added.

<HEADLINE> Drought, Heat Attack Nature Reserve in Northeast China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARBIN, June 12 (Xinhua) -- Unusual high temperatures and
drought have hit northeast China since late May, causing a
disaster to a nature reserve in Heilongjiang Province.
</P>
<P>
Li Changyou, vice director with the Administration of Zha Lung
Nature Reserve in western Heilongjiang, said that for more than a
month the area had only 3 mm of rainfall, 90 percent less than the
usual amount.
</P>
<P>
The average temperature in May was about three centidegrees
higher than the normal level, he said.
</P>
<P>
As a result, most ponds in the reserve dried up and large
quantities of fish died, with birds there suffering from hunger.
</P>
<P>
Reeds caught fire in an area of 20,000 hectares in the central
part of the reserve due to hot, dry weather, scores of nests and
eggs were destroyed and young birds killed.
</P>
<P>
"Birds are forced to leave, and it is impossible for us to put
out the fire in the swamp, where human beings simply cannot enter
due to the deep, soft mud," said Li. "All we can do is try to
repair the nests and wait for the rainy season to come."
</P>
<P>
According to the provincial meteorological observatory, high
temperatures will continue in the region in June, and the average
will hit 35 centidegrees.
</P>
<P>
The 40,000-ha Zha Lung Nature Reserve, set up for the
protection of red-crowned cranes and other rare birds, is the
largest of its kind in China. About 40 percent of the world's
cranes species and 30 percent of the red-crowned cranes live in
the reserve.

<HEADLINE> Estrada Calls for Unity to Eradicate Poverty </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, June 12 (Xinhua) -- As the Philippines marked the 102nd
anniversary of its independence Monday, President Joseph Estrada
called on the people anew to unite behind him in the fight to
liberate the Philippines from poverty.
</P>
<P>
According to the Presidential Palace, Estrada said at the
Aguinaldo Shrine in Kawit, Cavite province, that while the
Filipino people gained political freedom in 1898, they have yet to
earn their liberation from poverty.
</P>
<P>
"One hundred and two years have passed since General Aguinaldo
declared our independence. But we are not yet truly free. We may
have ended our slavery from colonizers, but we have yet to shake
off the shackles of poverty," he said.
</P>
<P>
The president, in making his call for unity, also reiterated
his commitment not to allow any armed group to threaten the nation
's territorial integrity.
</P>
<P>
Estrada led flag-raising ceremonies nationwide to mark the
102nd anniversary of the Philippines' independence.
</P>
<P>
"We will do everything to protect our territorial integrity. We
will not allow any group to challenge that," said the president at
the flag-raising ceremony in Cavite.
</P>
<P>
He emphasized that "We have only one flag, one constitution,
and one government."
</P>
<P>
This, he said, can never be compromised, and it is his sworn
duty as Commander-in-Chief of the police and military, to protect
national sovereignty "even at the cost of our lives."
</P>
<P>
He said the government will continue to talk peace "but only to
build a just and lasting peace that is founded on sincerity and
mutual trust."
</P>
<P>
The government, he added, shall vigorously pursue socio-
economic development programs in Muslim areas, including the
bailiwicks of the rebel Moro Islamic Liberation Front.

<HEADLINE> Sri Lanka-India Talks Continue </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
COLOMBO, June 12 (Xinhua) -- Indian External Affairs Minister
Jaswant Singh Monday continued his discussions with Sri Lankan
officials on the island's ongoing ethnic conflict.
</P>
<P>
Singh met President Chandrika Kumaratunga Monday morning for a
second round of talks, officials said.
</P>
<P>
He was assisted by Joint Secretary Leela Ponnappa while the Sri
Lankan president was assisted by Foreign Minister Lakshman
Kadirgamar and other senior officials.
</P>
<P>
However, the details of the talks were not immediately known.
</P>
<P>
The state radio said on Monday the talks would focus on the
northern Jaffna peninsula, where the separatist rebels of
Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE) have been engaged in a
ferocious assault to recapture their former stronghold they lost
to government troops in 1996.
</P>
<P>
Singh, who arrived here Sunday afternoon for a two-day visit,
held the first round of talks with Kumaratunga over dinner Sunday
evening.
</P>
<P>
Immediately after his arrival, Singh had an unscheduled 45-
minute meeting with his Sri Lankan counterpart Kadirgamar.
</P>
<P>
It is believed that the situation in Jaffna took high priority
at the talks, although no official comment is available at present
regarding the discussions held so far.
</P>
<P>
Kadirgamar hosted his Indian counterpart for lunch at his
residence on Monday. It is understood that bilateral discussions
had continued over the lunch.
</P>
<P>
India has ruled out its military involvement in the island
nation's civil war which the LTTE rebels have been fighting for a
separate homeland for minority Tamils in the island's north and
east since 1983.
</P>
<P>
However, India has been in close contact with the Sri Lankan
government and promised to broker peace and humanitarian
assistance if asked.
</P>
<P>
Leader of the Sri Lankan opposition Ranil Wickremesinghe called
on Singh at the India House to express his party's stand.
</P>
<P>
Several moderate Tamil parties are also to meet Singh
thereafter.
</P>

PARIS, June 12 (Xinhua) -- French Foreign Minister Hubert
Vedrine said Monday that there is no particular reason to worry
about the future of Syria after the death of President Hafez Assad.
</P>
<P>
In an interview with radio and television Europe 1, Vedrine
said that he does not see any particular threat to the stability
of Syria, although there exist some uncertainties.
</P>
<P>
He said that the change of generation in the leadership of
Syria would also bring about a "change of conception and thinking.
"
</P>
<P>
"Therefore, one can pose questions but there is no reason to
worry," he added.
</P>
<P>
The French foreign minister also said that he expects the
Middle East peace process to continue because President Assad had
agreed to look for a peace settlement with Israel on the condition
that it should be just.

<TEXT>
<P>
HARBIN, June 12 (Xinhua) -- China has got funding from the
Global Environment Found (GEF) for protecting biodiversity on
four of its wetlands.
</P>
<P>
The five-year wetland preservation project will be implemented
jointly by China and the United Nations Development Program (UNDP),
with 14.28 million US dollars from GEF. It is believed that it is
the first time the GEF has funded a wetland preservation project.
In addition to the funding, GEF will also provide some equipment
and materials for the project.
</P>
<P>
The project aims to find out the best ways to preserve
ecological balance on the wetlands, and the experience may later
be extended to other countries.
</P>
<P>
The four wetlands are: the marshes on the Sanjiang Plain in
Heilongjiang Province, northeast China; the beaches in Yancheng of
Jiangsu Province, east China; the marshes in Dongting Lake in
Hunan Province, central China; and highland marshes on the border
between Sichuan and Gansu provinces, northwest China.
</P>
<P>
The wetland, the forest and the ocean, are the three main
ecosystems on earth. Wetlands are home to a great variety of
plants and animals.

<HEADLINE> Lebanon Rejects Larsen's Border Line </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, June 12 (Xinhua) -- Lebanese President Emile Lahoud has
issued a withering attack on the United Nations for its handling of
the process of verifying Israel's troop withdrawal from south
Lebanon, Daily Star newspaper reported Monday.
</P>
<P>
In a memorandum to U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan, Lahoud on
Sunday expressed "surprise" at the fact that U.N. special envoy to
the Middle East Terje Roed-Larsen had insisted on a unique "
withdrawal line" instead of demanding that Israel pull back its
troops behind the internationally-recognized borders under U.N.
resolutions 425 and 426.
</P>
<P>
Lahoud complained that U.N. cartographers had rejected an
existing and recognized border to establish a "fictitious"
withdrawal line to be used as the basis for confirmation of the
Israeli pullout.
</P>
<P>
Lahoud based his complaints on the references to the "
internationally-recognized borders" under U.N. Resolution 425 of
1978 and Annan's May 22 report on the implementation of the
resolution.
</P>
<P>
Annan's report based the line on the Anglo-French border of
1923, later confirmed by the 1949 Armistice Agreement.
</P>
<P>
Lahoud's objections centered on Larsen's apparent decision to
deviate from Annan's instructions and issue what has become known
as "Larsen's line."
</P>
<P>
"Lebanon submitted the 1923 and 1949 documents and all maps
adopted for these borders, which leave no room for doubt regarding
their accuracy and authenticity, while no counter evidence was
submitted," Lahoud said in his five-page memo.
</P>
<P>
He also attacked a U.N. assertion that it was not responsible
for demarcating international boundaries. He said that Larsen's
withdrawal line had left a "dangerous vagueness" over the true
demarcation of the border.
</P>
<P>
The inspection teams moved slowly, covering some 20 kilometers
before ending at Maroun Ras on Sunday evening. The slow progress in
verifying the border has pushed back plans for deploying U.N.
peacekeepers in south Lebanon, vacated by Israeli troops.
</P>
<P>
For fear of escalated Lebanese guerrilla attacks and mounting
casualties, Israel completed its troop withdrawal on May 24, ending
22-year occupation in south Lebanon.

<HEADLINE> Jordanian King Foresees Peaceful Power Transition in Syria </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
AMMAN, June 12 (Xinhua) -- Jordanian King Abdullah Bin Hussein
has predicted a peaceful transition of power in Syria and pledged
his support for Syria after the passing away of President Hafez al-
Assad, one of the longest-serving presidents in the world.
</P>
<P>
According to the official Petra news agency Monday, Abdullah
said in an interview Sunday evening that he had confidence in the
Syrian people's capabilities to surmount the difficulties after the
death of Assad.
</P>
<P>
Assad, who had ruled the country for three decades, died
Saturday of heart attack at age 69.
</P>
<P>
Abdullah spoke highly of Bashar al-Assad, the second and
favorite son of Assad who looked set to take over as the new
president, and described him as a "very smart man, extremely
impressive and well-informed of issues in the region."
</P>
<P>
The Syrian parliament has amended the constitution after Assad
died to lower the minimum age of a presidential candidate from 40
to 34, in an apparent bid to pave the way for Bashar, 35, to
succeed his father.
</P>
<P>
Abdullah said he believed the power transition would be smooth
in Syria as Bashar was in a strong position and enjoyed the
confidence of all important government institutions in the country.
</P>
<P>
The monarch, who had established close personal ties with Bashar
during his visit to Syria earlier this year, said he believed
Bashar stood for peace in the region and was eager to lift the war-
torn Syrian economy out of stagnation.
</P>
<P>
On the Syrian-Israeli peace talks, Abdullah said he believed
Bashar "has a desire for peace and he is ready for it, he has
already started it and I believe he will continue with peace" after
a 40-day period of mourning for Assad in Syria.
</P>
<P>
The Syrian-Israeli peace talks were deadlocked in January after
Israel rejected a Syrian demand to give back in full the strategic
Golan Heights it captured in the 1967 Middle East war.

<HEADLINE> Manila to Exhaust Peaceful Means for Hostages' Release </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, June 12 (Xinhua) -- The Philippine government
reiterated Monday that it will continue to exhaust all peaceful
means to secure the safe release of the 21 mostly foreign hostages
held captive by the Abu Sayyaf on Sulu island.
</P>
<P>
Executive Secretary Ronaldo Zamora said the safety and welfare
of the hostages remains the government's paramount concern,
stressing that what is important is that the talks for their
release are continuing in accordance with the policies set by the
government.
</P>
<P>
"It is not important who the chief negotiator is. What is
important for us is that the negotiations are continuing in
accordance with our policies," Zamora said on radio.
</P>
<P>
Zamora's statement was made in response to the reported demand
of the Abu Sayyaf to replace Secretary Robert Aventajado, the
presidential flagship projects committee chairman, as chief
government negotiator tasked to secure release of the hostages.
</P>
<P>
According to some reports, the Abu Sayyaf group wants Zamora to
take Aventajado's place.
</P>
<P>
The Abu Sayyaf slammed Aventajado for hinting at the
possibility of using military means to solve the hostage crisis if
negotiations fail.
</P>
<P>
Aventajado has been in the negotiating team since mid-May. He
had replaced Nur Misuari, governor of the Autonomous Region for
Muslim Mindanao, upon an earlier demand by the Abu Sayyaf.
</P>
<P>
Press Secretary and Presidential Spokesman Ricardo Puno said
that it is up to President Joseph Estrada to decide on this issue.
</P>
<P>
"What is important is that negotiations continue. We will
remain open, we will keep our lines of communication open," he
said.
</P>
<P>
The Abu Sayyaf, which kidnapped the hostages from the Sipadan
Island resort in Malaysia on April 23, was said to have separated
its captives into two groups for fear of government military
rescue operations.

<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, June 12 (Xinhua) -- The Democratic Republic of the
Congo (DRC) has demanded Rwandan and Ugandan troops to leave the
country and take their senseless war elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
The Times of Zambia newspaper Monday quoted DRC Foreign
Minister Abdoulaye Yerodia as saying in Lusaka at the weekend that
the two troops came to his country together but they are now
fighting each other.
</P>
<P>
He said the clashes between the two former allies in the
mineral-rich town kisangani in northeastern DRC could be over
diamonds.
</P>
<P>
"Maybe it is because they want to plunder the minerals because
Kisangani is full of diamonds," he said.
</P>
<P>
He said all international efforts should be concentrated on
ensuring that the warring troops are withdrawn and not just
separated.
</P>
<P>
"Separating them is not a solution. They should just leave our
country," he said.
</P>
<P>
Both Uganda and Rwanda backed the Rally for Congolese Democracy
(RCD) in fighting to topple the government of DRC President
Laurent Kabila beginning from August, 1998.
</P>
<P>
In May, 1999 the RCD was divided into two rival factions and
the two former allies chose to support different sides and their
forces have clashed frequently since early May this year for the
control of Kisangani, causing heavy casualties.

farmers wishing to settle in the country following what is

Meanwhile, Desai assured the white commercial farmers in Zambia
that the government will not grab their farms as the country has
plenty of land.
</P>
<P>
He was responding to Zambian white commercial farmers who
wanted to know during the meeting if the government has any
intention of grabbing part of their farmland.

<HEADLINE> News Analysis: Inter-Korean Summit, A Result of Peace Trend </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PYONGYANG, June 12 (Xinhua) -- The landmark inter-Korean summit
will be held here from Tuesday to Thursday, the first meeting
between leaders of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea (DPRK)
and Republic of Korea in more than 50 years since the Korean
Peninsula was divided at the end of the World War II in 1945.
</P>
<P>
The summit, at which the two sides are expected to discuss
issues of common concerns, is generally believed as a move
reflecting both the historic trend and the popular aspiration.
</P>
<P>
After the Cold War, the surging world trend of peace and
development has brought about a strong impact on the Korean
Peninsula which has remained by and large in a state of cold war
for half a century. Faced with the new trend, the DPRK and South
Korea have been trying for years to explore ways to ease the
tension in their relations.
</P>
<P>
At the beginning of the 1990s, Pyongyang and Seoul signed
several important documents, including an agreement on
reconciliation, non-aggression, and exchange and cooperation, and
the Joint Agreement on the Denuclearization of the Korean
Peninsula. In 1994, the two sides agreed to hold a summit to
alleviate the tension on the peninsula.
</P>
<P>
The DPRK regarded the improvement of inter-Korea relations as a
major prerequisite for realizing peaceful reunification of the
Korean Peninsula and proposed to hold high-level political talks.
</P>
<P>
On the other hand, South Korea focused its policy toward the
DPRK on reconciliation, cooperation and exchange in recent years.
Seoul has been seeking to remove distrust, promote mutual
understanding and pursue "Co-existence and Common Prosperity" with
Pyongyang.
</P>
<P>
In the meantime, the international community has been voicing
its desire to see a relaxation of the tension on the peninsula and
peace and stability there. The realization of the summit,
observers say, is exactly a reflection of the influence of the
trend of peace and stability on the Korean Peninsula.
</P>
<P>
Responding to the world trend, the people of DPRK and South
Korea stepped up their efforts for more exchanges and cooperation
projects, which helped in one way or another facilitate regional
peace.
</P>
<P>
Non-governmental exchanges and economic cooperation between the
two sides have been on the rise since late 1980s. Last year, trade
between the two sides reached 330 million U.S. dollars, up by 50.2
percent over the previous year. About 600 South Korean companies
are now engaged in trading business of more than 500 kinds of
goods with the DPRK.
</P>
<P>
More than 200,000 tourists, mostly from the South, have visited
Mountain Kumgang, about 250 kilometers to the Southeast of
Pyongyang, since a historic tour project started in 1998. The
project, co-sponsored by the DPRK government and South Korea's
Huyndai Corporation, is generally seen as a typical model of non-
governmental cooperation between the two sides.
</P>
<P>
Several large South Korean corporations are now believed to be
ready to expand their cooperation with the DPRK to a wider area,
as observers noted that bosses of four big South Korean
enterprises are to accompany President Jim Dae-jung on his
scheduled trip to Pyongyang.
</P>
<P>
Recent years also saw increased exchanges between the North and
the South in the fields of literature, arts and sports. Artist
groups and dance troupes were swapped and football and basketball
matches held only to highlight the necessity and urgency for more
exchanges.
</P>
<P>
A South Korean parliament member once said after his trip to
Mountain Kumgang that the reunification of the Korean Peninsula
should be based on trust, while trust should start with
understanding, which comes from contacts.
</P>
<P>
The upcoming summit, observers say, is really brought about by
the common aspiration of the people of both the North and South of
the peninsula, who are of the same ethnic group after all.
</P>
<P>
However, as the whole world is closely following the inter-
Korean summit and expects a good result, experts warned that
because the deeply-rooted differences between the two sides are
not likely to be ironed out overnight, it is not realistic to
expect much achievements from a single summit.
</P>
<P>
They said it would be the best result if the summit can become
the first exploratory step, to allow the two Kims to get
acquainted, to lay down some ground rules for future summits and
to establish a modest step-by-step agenda.

<HEADLINE> Yellow River Waterfall Turns Green </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TAIYUAN, June 12 (Xinhua) -- Residents in Jixian County of
north China's Shanxi Province have found that the Hukou Waterfall
on the Yellow River has recently turned clear, something rarely
seen once in a century.
</P>
<P>
Experts attributed the rare phenomenon, which began in mid- to
late May, partly to a long drought this year, as sharply reduced
surface flow brought much less silt into the 5,464 km long river,
China's second largest after the Yangtze.
</P>
<P>
To ease the widespread drought, water from the reservoirs on
the upper reaches has been released at regular intervals to the
lower reaches.
</P>
<P>
The clear and green waterfall will become muddy and brown again
as the rain season comes, experts said.
</P>
<P>
The Hukou Waterfall, about 46 km west of Jixian county seat, is
a well-known tourist attraction in north China.

<HEADLINE> China's Financial Industry Continues Smooth Operation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 12 (Xinhua) -- China's financial sector continued
its momentum of smooth operation in the first five months of this
year, with banking loans increasing at a faster step and corporate
deposits registering marked increases.
</P>
<P>
Statistics released today by the People's Bank of China (PBOC),
the country's central bank, shows that by the end of May, the
outstanding amount of loans by all financial institutions stood at
9.6175 trillion yuan (about 1.23 trillion U.S. dollars), up 13.9
percent from the same period last year in constant terms.
</P>
<P>
At the end of May, the outstanding amount of broad money was 12.
4053 trillion yuan, up 12.7 percent from the same period last year
but down one percentage point from the previous month, the growth
decline was caused mainly by the downturn in residents' deposits.
</P>

According to the statistics, at the end of May the outstanding
amount of residents' deposits was 6.2195 trillion yuan, up 5.5
percent from the same period last year but down 1.6 percentage

</P>
<P>
The outstanding amount of narrow money was 4.649 trillion yuan,
up 22.3 percent from the same period last year and up 0.6
percentage points from the previous month, this rise of growth
speed was mainly contributed by the sharp increase in corporate

period last year and 0.5 percentage points from the previous month.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 12 (Xinhua) -- Chinese archaeologists recently
reported new finds in caves of the Mogao Grottos in Dunhuang,
northwest China's Gansu Province.
</P>
<P>
The archaeologists, led by professor Peng Jinzhang with Wuhan
University, excavated remnants of sutra in minority languages, a
few of which are believed to be the only existing copies in the
world, Wenhui Daily reported today.
</P>
<P>
After searching in 243 caves in the northern part of the famous
grottos, Peng and his colleagues also found lots of Persian coins,
Xixia coins and intact wooden printing types in Uygur, earthenware
articles and textile pieces, the Shanghai-based newspaper said.
</P>
<P>
Also known as Thousand Buddha Caves, the Dunhuang Grottos
boosts a huge reserve of cultural treasures.
</P>
<P>
The 492 caves in Dunhuang's southern part were regarded as the
world's largest stone cave library for its enormous preservation
of Buddhist frescos, statues and precious sutras.
</P>
<P>
China has listed the excavation of those caves as a priority
project for social scientific research in the next five years.
</P>
<P>
Peng compiled all the latest achievements into a book which
will be published soon, the newspaper said.

<P>
BEIJING, June 12 (Xinhua) -- Archaeologists recently stumbled
upon five pieces of fossilized human skulls in Tonglu County near
Hangzhou, capital of east China's Zhejiang Province.
</P>
<P>
The archaeologists obtained the human fossils as well as more
than 30 items of fossilized animal bones in two caves, in which
primitive people resided in the late Neolithic Period (10,000 - 4,
000 B.C.), Wenhui Daily reported today.
</P>
<P>
An excavation team from the Zhejiang Natural Museum also found
two animal bones which experienced several cuts by the primitive
residents, the newspaper said.
</P>
<P>
Except a human tooth unearthed in 1974 in Jiande County, the
archaeologists had never found fossils of remote humans in the
economically-developed province.

the country's northern regions and to ensure a good harvest for
the year.
</P>
<P>
Wen, also a member of the Political Bureau of the Central

million heads of livestock are in short of drinking waters
</P>
<P>
All governments at drought-stricken areas should put great
emphasis on drought fighting and take effective measures to reduce

<HEADLINE> Major News Items in Leading Israeli Newspapers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, June 12 (Xinhua) -- The following are major news
items in leading Israeli newspapers on Monday.
</P>
<P>
The Jerusalem Post:
</P>
<P>
-- Israel and the Palestinians have reached an understanding
that Israel will free all 1,650 Palestinian security prisoners once
the two sides agree on an outline for a final peace treaty, chief
Palestinian negotiator Saeb Erekat said on Sunday, before leaving
for negotiations set to resume on Tuesday in Washington.
</P>
<P>
Israel has not given the Palestinian National Authority a
definite answer yet, a Palestinian source close to the negotiations
said. "It seems that they do not want to release any more prisoners
until we sign the framework agreement," he added.
</P>
<P>
Ha'aretz:
</P>
<P>
-- Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak sent a message of
reassurance to Syria on Sunday that Israel has no intention of
using the transition period in Damascus to stir up trouble in
Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
Barak also asked their ministers to refrain from commenting
publicly on the transition of power, lest their comments have a
disruptive influence on Damascus.
</P>
<P>
Noting that so far the transition of power is going smoothly in
Syria, Barak said that he and U.S. President Bill Clinton agreed
that it is unlikely that there will be a quick resumption of the
Israeli-Syrian peace negotiations, at least until Bashar al-Assad
has consolidated his power.
</P>
<P>
Ma'ariv:
</P>
<P>
-- Israel's Histadrut labor federation chairman Amir Peretz
called off a general strike slated for Monday after Finance
Minister Avraham Shochat said he would freeze legislation on three
items of the tax reform package and begin talks with the union on
the provisions that it opposes.
</P>
<P>
The three clauses in question are the taxes on interest from
hitherto tax-free supplemental educational funds, tax credits for
night-shift workers, and the half-point tax credit for working
women.
</P>
<P>
Peretz told a 3,000-strong rally he is still suspicious of
Shochat, who acted after intense pressure from Prime Minister Ehud
Barak to avoid the nationwide strike.
</P>
<P>
Yediot Aharonot:
</P>
<P>
-- The Israeli religious ultra-Orthodox Shas party hardened its
position on Sunday in negotiations with Prime Minister Ehud Barak
to resolve the coalition crisis, demanding not only more money for
its school system but more of a say in the peace process and social
issues.
</P>
<P>
Barak was working against the clock to find a coalition solution
without having to dismiss six ministers from the three parties that
voted last Wednesday for a bill to dissolve the Knesset
(Parliament) and hold early elections. The bill passed its
preliminary reading.
</P>
<P>
Based on a clause in the Transition Law, Barak has until Tuesday
night to decide whether to fire the ministers.

<P>
ANKARA, June 12 (Xinhua) -- The following are major news items
in leading Turkish newspapers on Monday.
</P>
<P>
Milliyet (National):
</P>
<P>
-- "The political dimension of separatism is gaining momentum
(in the Kurdish-populated southeast), which is as dangerous as the
armed dimension (of the outlawed Kurdistan Workers Party)," said
Prime Minister Bulent Ecevit aboard his plane en route to
Diyarbakir, southeast Turkey, Sunday. He added that he had told the
National Security Council about his views too.
</P>
<P>
Hurriyet (Freedom):
</P>
<P>
-- Prime Minister Bulent Ecevit announced a new economic package
in Diyarbakir, southeast Turkey, Sunday, which includes development
of border trade with Iraq and reduction of the high unemployment
there. He said that last year's government decree, which put limits
on the border trade with Iraq, was not realistic and the government
had overdone the precautions, taken in the context of the border
security.
</P>
<P>
YeniSafak (New Dawn):
</P>
<P>
-- A survey, conducted by the Ankara Chamber of Industry (ASO)
in the public and private sectors, shows that no business is free
of bribery in Turkey.
</P>
<P>
Questionnaires were sent to 971 ASO members, covering aspects
such as transparency in laws and policies, stability and
bureaucratic obstacles and honesty.

GAZA, June 12 (Xinhua) -- The scheduled Wednesday meeting
between U.S. President Bill Clinton and Chairman of the Palestinian
National Authority Yasser Arafat in Washington has been postponed
to Thursday, a senior Palestinian official said on Monday.
</P>
<P>
According to an advisor to Arafat, the one-day delay is because
that both Arafat and U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright
will attend Tuesday's funeral of the late Syrian President Hafez
al-Assad, who died of heart attack last Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Arafat will meet Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak Monday to
discuss the latest developments of the Middle East peace process,
in the light of Assad's death and the expected resumption of
Israeli-Palestinian peace negotiations in Washington.
</P>
<P>
Following his meeting with Mubarak, Arafat will leave for Syria
to attend Assad's funeral.

<HEADLINE> PNG Not to Interfere in Solomons Affairs: FM </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, June 12 (Xinhua) -- Papua New Guinea's Foreign
Minister John Kaputin issued a statement Monday pledging that his
country would not allow its territory to be used as a base for
hostile attacks against neighboring countries or for interference
in their internal affairs.
</P>
<P>
According to the statement, faxed to the Canberra Branch of
Xinhua from PNG Prime Minister's Office, the foreign minister made
it clear that "the PNG government respects the sovereignty of
other countries, and expects other countries to respect Papua New
Guinea's in return. We will not tolerate illegal activities by
individuals or groups who behave without proper regard for the
mutual respect between states which is the basis of national
security and peace in our region."
</P>
<P>
The foreign minister was commenting on an earlier report saying
that Papua New Guinea's Bougainville Revolutionary Army (BRA) on
Sunday took over the neighboring Solomon Islands' Choiseul and
Gizo islands to protect their allies, the Isatabu Freedom Movement
in the Guadalcanal island, with whom they have bloody ties.
</P>
<P>
The BRA fought a nine-year war to separate the Bougainville
island from PNG until a cease fire in 1998. There is suspicion of
a plan to establish a new race-based country by Bougainville and
some islands from Solomon Islands.
</P>
<P>
The Foreign Minister said after a meeting with Bougainville
People's Congress President Joseph Kabui that "I have been told
that their leaders have said they are strongly opposed to
activities across the common border which might compromise the
sovereignty and security of our good neighbors in Solomon Islands.
"
</P>
<P>
Kaputin directed to investigate the origins of the media
reports, while calling on the media to display care and
responsibility in reporting.

<HEADLINE> Estrada Vows to Make Lasting Peace in Mindanao </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, June 12 (Xinhua) -- Philippine President Joseph Estrada
expressed anew Monday his desire to make just and lasting peace
his administration's legacy to Mindanao, along with prosperity and
development to the once-neglected region.
</P>
<P>
The president said this means extending the hand of friendship
and peace to rebel groups, but also implementing the resolve to
crush any mockery of the peace process.
</P>
<P>
"We are willing to extend our hands in friendship and in peace.
But it must be an honorable and lasting peace. This is the legacy
I want to leave behind when I finish my term (in 2004) so we can
rebuild Mindanao and fulfill its promise," he said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
Estrada stressed that the Armed Forces of the Philippines and
the Philippine National Police share his commitment to work
towards this lasting peace, "at all costs."
</P>
<P>
He added this is the reason he rejected a 40-day ceasefire with
the Moro Islamic Liberation Front (MILF) as proposed by some "well-
meaning citizens," saying that what he wants is not a temporary,
fragile peace but a just and permanent one.
</P>
<P>
Earlier, the president declined to call off military operations
against the MILF, saying his government cannot allow the rebels to
make a mockery of the peace process.
</P>
<P>
He noted these groups continue to attempt to assume control
over certain parts of the country, terrorizing citizens in the
process.
</P>
<P>
"I do not want our people whether in Mindanao or elsewhere in
this country to live in fear. We can no longer allow fear and
violence to prevail," he said.
</P>
<P>
"We will continue to live under one flag, one nation, one
constitution, one government, and one Armed Forces of the
Philippines," he stressed.

<HEADLINE> Sri Lanka Government Maintains Vital Supply Routes to Jaffna </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
COLOMBO, June 12 (Xinhua) -- The Sri Lankan government said
Monday that it is maintaining vital supply routes to the embattled
northern Jaffna peninsula despite reports of supply routes being
disrupted due to Tamil Tiger rebels' fire.
</P>
<P>
"Military equipment and other necessities including food items
are being unloaded at both Kankesanturai (KKS) and Point Pedro
harbors continuously," said a government statement.
</P>
<P>
It said movement of troops and civilians in and out of Jaffna
takes place both by air and sea without any hindrance.
</P>
<P>
The government statement came as the separatist rebels of
Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE) were reported to have
blocked supply routes to the Jaffna peninsula by shelling the air
force base and the sea port in the region.
</P>
<P>
The Sunday Times here reported that LTTE rebels fired on the
air base at Palaly and also rendered the KKS port useless for
government troops.
</P>
<P>
The LTTE rebels, fighting a 17-year war to carve out a separate
homeland for minority Tamils in the island's north and east, have
since April been engaged in a ferocious assault in a bid to
recapture their former stronghold of Jaffna.
</P>
<P>
The paper said that the government stopped flying fixed-wing
aircraft to Palaly. Only helicopters were allowed to fly to the
base, located adjacent to the government's largest military
garrison on the peninsula, according to the paper.
</P>
<P>
The bombardment of the air base and the port posed a serious
problem for the government. The disruption of supply routes might
cause disastrous consequences to government troops who have vowed
to defend Jaffna.

<HEADLINE> Africa to Introduce Continental Parliament </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, June 12 (Xinhua) -- African foreign ministers have
drawn a document aimed at introducing an African parliament to
foster development and unity on the continent, Monday's Times of
Zambia newspaper said.
</P>
<P>
The paper quoted Zambian Foreign Affairs Minister Keli
Walubita as saying that the document would soon be tabled by heads
of state at an extraordinary Organization of African Unity (OAU)
summit in the Togolese capital Lome.
</P>
<P>
The thrust of the just-ended foreign affairs ministers meeting
in Libya's capital Tripoli was to come up with modalities on how
the African parliament should operate, Walubita said in an
interview after he returned from Libya via Japan at the weekend.
</P>
<P>
"There is general consensus that Africa must emerge united and
forge ahead. We reached a compromise after considering documents
presented by Libya and Mali. The heads of state will now consider
what kind of African union to come up with," he said.
</P>
<P>
Many countries feel Africa is too weak to stand the adverse
effects of globalization, he said, noting that the African union
would ensure conflicts become a thing of the past.
</P>
<P>
Parliamentarians of the African parliament would be voted for
either on geographical location, population or proportional
representation, he said.

<P>
SEOUL, June 12 (Xinhua) -- Born on December 3,1925 in
Hugwangri, South Cholla province of South Korea, Kim Dae-jung, the
South Korean president, was the first son of a sharecropper family.
</P>
<P>
Before he was eight, Kim had often read reports on politics,
and when in middle school he was keen on debating and lecturing
and good at them.
</P>
<P>
He graduated from the Mokpo Commercial High School in South
Cholla province in 1943, from Koryo University in 1964 and Kynughi
University in 1970. In addition, Kim also got academic credentials
from western universities such as Cambridge and Harvard.
</P>
<P>
In 1954, Kim entered the political arena which later brought

the post of the party's president.
</P>
<P>
On May 19, 1997, Kim ran for the fourth time for presidency and
made it on December 18. His election made him the first opposition
party candidate to become president of South Korea since the
founding of the country in 1948.
</P>
<P>
He was sworn in as the 15th South Korean president on February
25, 1998.
</P>
<P>
On January 20, 2000, his NCNP party was incorporated with the
Millennium Democratic Party, and Kim became the new party's
president.
</P>
<P>
Kim Dae-jung, who has won numerous international honors and
awards, believes in Catholicism and likes reading, literature and
arts.
</P>
<P>
Kim married Lee Hee-ho in 1962 and has three children.

<HEADLINE> China to Promote Distance Education in Western Regions </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GUIYANG, June 12 (Xinhua) -- China is to spend 360 million yuan
(43 million US dollars) on developing distance education in its
western part, according to an official from the Ministry of
Education.
</P>
<P>
Wang Zhuzhu, deputy director of the ministry's tele-education
office, said the investment constitutes a major move by the state
to develop education in the economically backward western regions.
</P>
<P>
The central government this year has allocated 80 million yuan
(9 million US dollars) from the state revenue to start the program,
and the rest of the investment will be made next year, she said.
</P>
<P>
The program will focus on expanding the existent Chinese
Education and Research Network (CERNET), and help provide access
to the CERNET for colleges and schools in the west, especially
those for students of ethnic minorities.
</P>
<P>
Distance education based on telecommunications and computers is
an ideal solution for China's west, which accounts for more than
half of the country's land area but only 23 percent of the
population, said Zhang Xiaopeng, an associate professor at Fudan
University in Shanghai, who specializes in research in distance
education.

<HEADLINE> Beijing Adopts Strict Control on Water Consumption </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 12 (Xinhua) -- Facing the danger of drought as a
result of rare rains, the Chinese capital Beijing plans to adopt a
series of strict and obligatory measures on water consumption.
</P>
<P>
The measures include introducing a quota system for water usage
in industrial enterprises and in hotels, restaurants, and colleges
and universities.
</P>
<P>
Beijing plans to save 70 million cubic meters of water this
year, 50 percent more than the amount for 1999.
</P>
<P>
While all the industrial enterprises will be subject to an
upper limit in their water consumption, those enterprises which
waste water resources and generate heavy pollution will have to
upgrade their technological level within a limited time period so
as to use water economically or they will be forced out of
production.
</P>
<P>
Stricter control will also be imposed on water consumption in
sectors which consume a large amount of water, such as the car-
washing business and public bathhouses.
</P>
<P>
Statistics show that per capita water resources in Beijing
stands at 300 cubic meters, about one-eighth of the national
average and one-thirtieth of the world's average. The city is now
facing the strike of drought as the arid weather since last year
has resulted in sharp decline in the water level in the city's
reservoirs and in the underground water level.
</P>
<P>
In other water-saving moves, the city also plans to replace the
irrigation system in downtown with a water-saving system and adopt
a quota system in water usage among households on an experimental
basis. Daily water consumption by Beijing residents per capita is
expected to be reduced under 130 liters by the year 2002.

<HEADLINE> Historians From 3 Countries Find New Crimes of Japanese Invaders in Dongning Fortress </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARBIN, June 12 (Xinhua) -- Historians from China, Japan and
Russia have recently found new evidence in the Japanese Dongning
fortress in northeast China's Heilongjiang Province that Japanese
invaders committed "unforgivable crimes" in China during the 1930s
and early 1940s.
</P>
<P>
The Dongning fortification is located at the Sino-Russian
border, covering an area of 93-km wide at the front and 50-km in
length. Some 130,000 Japanese soldiers once stationed there.
</P>
<P>
Jin Weibai and Cheng Penghan from a memorial hall said the
underground tunnels, a Japanese command center, an electricity
generation center and ammunition warehouse were discovered in the
fortress.
</P>
<P>
Military documents were also found, said Makota Kikuchi, a
researcher from a Japanese research institute who specializes in
studying Japanese fortifications in northeast China.
</P>
<P>
The historians chose Dongning because there are still forced
labor and comfort women survivors in the area. Zhu Jinhuan, a
Chinese labor survivor, said Japanese soldiers would put those
Chinese labors who want to escape in sacks and threw them at
hungry, ferocious dogs.
</P>
<P>
Russian experts Ivan Novich and Victor Lovich said "It is
ridiculous that Japanese right-wings activists are trying to deny
that Japan invaded China during this period. All the evidence
suggests the complete opposite."
</P>
<P>
Haruichi Takenouchi, another expert from the Japanese Institute,
said, the findings in the Dongning fortification told us that the
Japanese committed untold atrocities. He promised not to stop his
efforts in exposing that until the Japanese government formally
apologizes to the Chinese people.
</P>
<P>
A twenty page photo album published by the Japanese includes
pictures on Japanese attacks of Nanjing, air raids over Chongqing
and Xi'an, and also photos of their commanders.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 12 (Xinhua) -- The following is a round-up of
China's archaeology news for the past week:
</P>
<P>
More Fossils of Dinosaur Found in Yuanmou Man's Home
</P>
<P>
Archaeologists recently excavated two more complete sets of
dinosaur skeletons in the county of Yuanmou, the "home" of Yuanmou
Man, in the Yi Autonomous Prefecture of Chuxiong, in southwest
China's Yunnan Province.
</P>
<P>
The excavation began in late April after a villager in the
county discovered a fossil in last November which was later
confirmed as a fossilized dinosaur. Experts believed that the
finding is another major archaeological discovery following the
find of the first Yuanmou Man in 1965 at Shangnabang Village in
Yuanmou County.
</P>
<P>
Experts Reveal Secrets with Long-Existing Wooden Pagoda
</P>
<P>
Some Chinese scientists and architects have concluded after
field study that perfect structural design, geological location,
ideal climate, and use of sustainable timber are factors behind
the nearly 1,000-year-old wooden pagoda in Yingxian county of
Shanxi Province in north China.
</P>
<P>
Standing 65.86 meters, the octagonal pagoda is not only the
tallest but also the oldest wooden pagoda in China today. Compared
with the renowned Leaning Tower of Pisa in Italy, the wooden
pagoda in Yingxian is 115 years older and 11.36 meters taller. The
pagoda was listed as a cultural heritage under first-class State
protection in the 1950s.
</P>
<P>
Syriac Inscriptions Discovered In Mogao Caves
</P>
<P>
Chinese archaeologists have for the first time found Syriac
inscriptions in the famous Mogao Caves of Dunhuang, northwest
China's Gansu Province.
</P>
<P>
They made this discovery when they put in order scriptures
unearthed in the northern zone of the Dunhuang Mogao Caves.
</P>
<P>
The archaeologists launched an excavation in the northern zone
between the 1980s and the 1990s, and discovered 243 more caves
which bring the total number of Mogao caves to 735 from the former
492.

Gold Bars From Han Dynasty Unearthed In Shaanxi
</P>
<P>
A total of 219 gold bars made during the Han Dynasty (206 B.C.-
220 A.D.) have been discovered in the northern suburban of Xi'an,
capital of northwest China's Shaanxi Province.
</P>
<P>
A bulldozer driver unearthed the ingots while working at a
construction site. They were located in two separate containers,
both five meters underground. Each of the bars has a diameter
ranging from 5.6 cm to 6.5 cm and weighs between 250 and 300 grams.
</P>
<P>
Exhibition of Famous Tomb Objects Held in Chengdu
</P>
<P>
An exhibition of burial objects unearthed in the early 1970s
from a 2,000-year-old tomb in Changsha, central China, opened to
visitors today in Chengdu, capital of southwest China's Sichuan
Province.
</P>
<P>
The tomb, at Mawangdui on the outskirts of Changsha city in
Hunan Province, has been identified as belonging to the early
Western Han Dynasty (206 BC-24 AD), and contained the well-
preserved corpse of an elderly woman and more than 3,000 valuable
funerary objects.
</P>
<P>
China's "Marine Silk Road" Starts 200 Years Earlier
</P>
<P>
Chinese archeologists believe Persian-style silver basins,
ivory, glass bowls and crystal-bead strings unearthed from a leud
tomb dating back to the Warring States Period (475 BC-221 BC) in
south China's Guangzhou City, suggested China's marine trade with
the Middle and West Asia began much earlier than that through the
ancient "Land Silk Road".
</P>
<P>
The "imported commodities" came to China in the third century
Before Christ. However, the ancient "Silk Road" that starts from
Xi'an City in western China was explored some 200 years later in
119 BC, said Chinese historians.
</P>
<P>
Large Relics Smuggling Case Uncovered in China
</P>
<P>
Customs officials in the city of Zhangjiagang in east China's
Jiangsu Province recently seized 142 items of relics hidden in 60
pieces of furniture which were bound for the United States.
</P>
<P>
Customs sources said this is the largest relics smuggling case
uncovered in Jiangsu in the past 20 years.
</P>
<P>
The relics include ceramic plates, portraits of Buddha, brush
pots and folding screens.

<HEADLINE> Thai Exporters Fear EU Trade Barriers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, June 12 (Xinhua) -- Thai exporters and officials are
worried that the European Union (EU) could ban the import of Thai
products on health grounds without giving any warning, The Bangkok
Post reported Monday.
</P>
<P>
The Thai government has expressed its concern to the EU, which
sought the reaction of trading partners to its regulations.
</P>
<P>
The EU has become increasingly worried about food safety,
following health scares over dioxin in animal feed. Monitoring
will be carried out by the European Food Authority, which is to be
established soon.
</P>
<P>
A Thai Commerce Ministry official was quoted as saying the main
worry for Thailand was a possible sudden ban on food imports on
health grounds.
</P>
<P>
Thai exporters have hired consultants to study the implications.
A senior executive of Charoen Pokphan Group, Thailand's largest
agro-industry company, was quoted as saying the issue was of more
serious immediate concern to the food industry than the debate
over genetic modification.
</P>
<P>
The EU is the third-largest export market for Thai food,
purchasing products worth 35 billion baht (909 million U.S.
dollars) last year, behind the United States and Japan.
</P>
<P>
The Thai government has hired European consultants to analyze
EU moves on the issue. It has also asked the EU to avoid making
assumptions without scientific support.
</P>
<P>
The EU has also been urged to reconsider its procedures for
tracing food ingredients to their point of origin and delay the
enforcement of practices related to food until they have full
international recognition. Thailand has asked the EU for help in
building laboratories and providing production technology.
</P>
<P>
Thailand disagrees with the EU attempt to link the issue of
environment, human rights and animal welfare with those of
processing and production standards and regulatory procedures,
claiming that this would create a disguised trade barrier,
inconsistent with World Trade Organization agreements.
</P>
<P>
Thailand is worried that the European Food Authority might
become a tool for artificial trade barriers and suggests that the
authority instead help improve food-testing agencies in developing
countries.

<HEADLINE> 10 Killed in Indian Gang Massacre </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, June 12 (Xinhua) -- At least 10 people were killed
and three others injured Sunday night in a massacre in Nawada
district in East India's Bihar state, police said Monday.
</P>
<P>
Police said more than 100 heavily-armed assailants of the
notorious Ashok Mahato gang swooped on Apsad village and gunned
down 10 people when they were in sleep.
</P>
<P>
Three persons, who were injured in the attack, were taken to a
government hospital nearby for treatment.
</P>
<P>
Police said the attackers also slit the victims' throats after
spraying bullets on them. The victims belonged to the upper caste
Bhumihar community, according to the Press Trust of India.
</P>
<P>
The killing is believed to be a retaliatory strike by the gang
to avenge a recent massacre of their supporters in Nawada by the
rival Akhilesh Singh gang.
</P>
<P>
Six persons belonging to the Yadav community were killed last
week at a village in Nawada district.
</P>
<P>
A combing operation has been launched by local police to arrest
the attackers.

<HEADLINE> Japan's Current Account Surplus Surges in April </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TOKYO, June 12 (Xinhua) - Japan's current account surplus in
April rose 40.2 percent from a year earlier to 1,181.4 billion yen
(11.2 billion U.S. dollars), up for the third straight month, the
Finance Ministry said Monday.
</P>
<P>
The upsurge in the current account surplus came as a climb in
exports outweighed an increase in imports, the ministry said in a
preliminary report.
</P>
<P>
Exports grew 8.3 percent to 4,202.9 billion yen (39.8 billion
dollars) while imports went up 8.2 percent to 2,918.7 billion yen
(27.7 billion dollars), both racking up growth for six months in a
row.
</P>
<P>
The surplus in goods and services trade totaled 773.6 billion
yen (7.3 billion dollars), up 41.8 percent.
</P>
<P>
The merchandise trade surplus increased 8.4 percent to 1,284.2
billion yen (12.2 billion dollars), while the services deficit
contracted to 510.6 billion yen (4.8 billion dollars) due to
scaled-back deficits in trade-related services.
</P>
<P>
The yen averaged 105.48 to the dollar in February, compared
with 119.81 a year earlier.
</P>
<P>
The current account balance represents the difference between a
nation's income from foreign sources and foreign obligations
payable, excluding net capital investment.

<HEADLINE> Thailand, South Korea Study Ways to Boost Bilateral Trade </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, June 12 (Xinhua) -- Thailand and South Korea are
studying methods to strengthen bilateral trade, a Thai official
was quoted by Monday's Bangkok Post as saying.
</P>
<P>
"Tariff reductions were being considered," said Vithun
Tulyanond,deputy director-general of the Business Economics
Department.
</P>
<P>
A feasibility study would be completed this year, he added.
</P>
<P>
Trade between the two countries totaled 2.63 billion U.S.
dollars last year.
</P>
<P>
Thai trade with South Korea has plenty of room for growth, the
official said, adding that this would be enhanced by a free-trade
pact.
</P>
<P>
Vithun said South Korea had accepted broad-based negotiations
with Thailand, including trade in farm products, a sensitive issue
for that country.
</P>
<P>
While Thailand hopes to import industrial raw materials from
South Korea at a much lower price than from Japan, South Korea is
encouraging its private sector to compete with Japan in expanding
investment and boosting exports to Thailand and other Asian-
Pacific markets, according to the Thai official.

<P>
Sakol Harnsuthiwarin, deputy director of the Commercial
Registration Department, was quoted as saying that if companies
did not have enough capital, they would need to increase it to the
required level within six months.
</P>
<P>
The department will give about six months for each company to
finish its cost projection.
</P>
<P>
About 5,340 foreign companies already registered in Thailand
are expected to be affected by the new regulation, as well as all
newcomers.
</P>
<P>
New businesses planning to operate in Thailand for more than
three years must bring in 25 percent of their capital within the
first three months and 50 percent by the end of the first year.
They must bring in the balance within the subsequent two years.
</P>
<P>
Companies planning to operate in Thailand for less than three
years must bring in all of their capital within six months.
</P>
<P>
The new regulation will not apply to wholesale or retail
enterprises with capital exceeding 100 million baht (2.59 million
dollars).
</P>
<P>
It will neither apply to construction companies providing
public utilities or transport requiring specialized tools,
machinery, technology or construction expertise as long as they
have a foreign capital of at least 500 million baht (12.98 million
dollars).
</P>
<P>
Peter van Haren, chairman of the Foreign Chamber of Commerce of
Thailand, was quoted as saying that, in general, any form of
minimum investment requirement imposed by countries "dissuades
smaller investors because the costs increase."
</P>
<P>
However, he said a percentage basis was fairer than a fixed
amount, noting that there had not yet been any negative reaction
from the foreign business community.

<HEADLINE> Pacers Beat Lakers in Game Three of NBA Finals </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LOS ANGELES, June 11 (Xinhua) -- Indiana Pacers point guard
Reggie Miller scored 33 points and Jalen Rose 21 in Game 3 of the
NBA Finals Sunday evening as the Los Angeles Lakers was beaten 100-
91 with second superstar Kobe Bryant sat out following an injured
left ankle two nights earlier.
</P>
<P>
The Pacers also used the notorious "Hack-a-Shaq" strategy in
the fourth quarter, and this time the strategy paid off for the
Pacers as MVP Shaquille O'Neal scored 33 points but made only 3-of-
13 from the free throw line.
</P>
<P>
Even so, the Lakers, who never led, crept within 3 points on a
Ron Harper 3-pointer with 14 seconds to go, following an O'Neal
offensive rebound.
</P>
<P>
"If we were down 3-0 you could have pretty much written us off.
We needed a gutty effort and we got it." said Miller, who made
four free throws in the end of the game.
</P>
<P>
The Lakers not only missed Bryant's scoring in Game 3. He is
also an aggressive force on defense and a good rebounder.
</P>
<P>
Bryant, a second-team All-NBA selection as well as first-team
all-defense pick, was injured while making his only shot of Game 2
on Friday night, a 17-foot jumper with 3:26 left in the first
quarter.
</P>
<P>
The Lakers missed Bryant's offense Sunday evening, getting just
six points from Brian Shaw, his replacement in the starting lineup.
</P>
<P>
Bryant is believed to have two more full days off before Game 4,
to be played Wednesday night, but the Lakers coach Phil Jackson
acknowledged, "Realistically speaking, Kobe won't be 100 percent
for a while." That means he might miss Game 4.

<HEADLINE> NBA Downgrades O'Neal's Flagrant To Personal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LOS ANGELES, June 11 (Xinhua) -- The NBA agreed to the Los
Angeles center Shaquille O'Neal complain and announced Sunday,
hours before Game 3 of the Finals in Indianapolis, that a flagrant
foul called on the MVP in Game 2 of the NBA Finals Friday night
was downgraded to a personal foul.
</P>
<P>
O'Neal had said he did not understand how a wall could be
called a flagrant offender when a sports car runs into it.
</P>
<P>
"When a little guy in a sports car runs into a brick wall they
call a flagrant foul. I never did understand the rule but I guess
I'm big and I can take it," O'Neal said.
</P>
<P>
O'Neal was assessed a flagrant foul for a hard rejection of
point guard Travis Best on a drive with 6:40 to go in the game,
which the Lakers won 111-104 to take a 2-0 lead over the Indiana
Pacers in the best-of-seven series.
</P>
<P>
There was plenty of body contact, but O'Neal also got his hand
on the ball, and the flagrancy of the foul was doubtful,
especially since it was debatable which player initiated contact.
</P>
<P>
The foul was O'Neal's fifth of the game -- one short of fouling
out -- and coach Phil Jackson sat him down for about a minute as
Indiana capitalized by scoring four points on the foul shots and
ball possession that comes with a flagrant foul.
</P>
<P>
Rescinding that flagrant call could be significant should O'
Neal be called for another. A player is automatically suspended
one game after his fourth flagrant foul point. A player gets one
point for a flagrant foul 1 and two points for a flagrant foul 2.
</P>
<P>
The Lakers coach Phil Jackson said the league decision had
removed the possibility that O'Neal "would get an accidental one (
flagrant foul) or something that we consider not aggressive or
nonflagrant in that same situation" and miss a Finals game.

<HEADLINE> Shenzhen Reports High Growth in Stamp Taxes </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHENZHEN, June 12 (Xinhua) -- Shenzhen, one of China's two
stock exchange centers, earned 10.2 billion yuan (about 1.23
billion U.S. dollars) in stamp taxes from securities and stock
trading in the first five months of the year.
</P>
<P>
Information from Shenzhen State Taxation Bureau said the volume
was 388 percent up from the same period last year. The Bureau has
completed levying stamp taxes assigned by the National Taxation
Administration for this year.
</P>
<P>
Stock trading at both the Shenzhen and Shanghai Stock Exchanges
has been increasing since May of 1999.
</P>
<P>
From January to May this year, trading of securities at
Shenzhen Stock Exchange was worth 1,425.1 billion yuan (about 171.
69 billion U.S. dollars), four times the volume for the same
period last year. The Exchange generated 11.132 billion yuan (
about 1.31 billion U.S. dollars) in stamp taxes from transactions
of securities in 1999.
</P>
<P>
Industry expert said that a range of policies implemented makes
it possible for more funds to flow into the stock market,
contributing to the boom at the country's stock exchanges. The
successive lowering of bank interest rates for time deposits, for
instance, has forced many private investors to try their luck on
the stock market.

<HEADLINE> China's Grass Products Industry Has Great Potential </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LANZHOU, June 12 (Xinhua) -- Experts said that China's fledging
grass industry has great scope for potential.
</P>
<P>
They said the demand for grass products on both Chinese and
international markets have been rising rapidly in recent years.
</P>
<P>
Statistics show that China's demand for clover stands at 3
million to 5 million tons annually, and the demand on the
international market is 5 million tons. China's demand for lawn
and grass seeds has increased by 20 percent annually.
</P>
<P>
China is abundant in grass resources and has an over 2,000-year-
old history of planting clover. At present, the country has 300
million hectares of natural pastures and 12 million hectares of
planted pastures.
</P>
<P>
The increasing demand for beef and mutton in China in recent
years is one of the factors that are expected to stimulate China's
grass industry.
</P>
<P>
China's agricultural departments plan to build 24 quality
forage grass production bases throughout the country, and some
local governments have worked out preferential policies
encouraging the development of the industry.
</P>
<P>
A dozen research institutes including Gansu Agricultural
University and the Gansu Grassland Ecological Research Institute
have established a Grass Industry Science and Technology Research
Center.
</P>
<P>
China now has thousands of grass industrial companies. Some of
them have cooperated with foreign counterparts to export products.
</P>
<P>
The World Bank has granted a 10 million yuan (1.2 million U.S.
dollars) loan for Longsheng Grass Industry Co. Ltd in Gansu
Province to develop 6,600 hectares of alfalfa.
</P>
<P>
Statistics show that north China's Shanxi Province alone
exported more than 1,000 tons of grass products to the Republic of
Korea and Japan last year.

<HEADLINE> Southern China Great Wall Discovered </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GUIYANG, June 12 (Xinhua) -- Chinese architect experts have
discovered the ruins of the southern China great wall in Fenghuang
County, central China's Hunan Province.
</P>
<P>
Luo Zhewen, an expert from the State Administration of Cultural
Heritage and vice-chairman of the China Great Wall Society,
confirmed this discovery during an investigation tour in
Fenghuang County on April 20-22.
</P>
<P>
Luo, who has been studying China's Great Wall for more than 50
years, explained that the differences between the great wall and
ordinary city walls are that the great walls stretch for at least
hundreds of miles and have numerous gates, enemy towers, platforms
and other defensive facilities.
</P>
<P>
According to historical records, the Ming Dynasty (1368-1644)
built a 190-km-long side wall between Tongren County of Guizhou
Province and Baojing County of Hunan Province in 1615 to reinforce
its control in the area.
</P>
<P>
Local experts said that the ruins of the side walls and
defensive towers were built in 1797 during the Qing Dynasty (1644-
1911).

<P>
TIANJIN, June 12 (Xinhua) -- Private community services are
booming in Tianjin, according to a survey by civil affairs
departments.
</P>
<P>
The survey showed that private service companies in some
districts account for two-thirds of the total community service
companies in the port city.
</P>
<P>
Private community service companies offer many services to
local citizens and are more flexible in providing help than state-
owned ones, the survey showed. Their major services include house
calls by doctors, delivering goods and providing cleaning and
domestic services.
</P>
<P>
"We are making efforts to win the trust of residents by
providing high-quality services instead of advertisements," said
Wang Yuxiang, director of a local private service company.
</P>
<P>
Private community services have provided more employment
opportunities for the laid-offs. At the same time, state-owned
service companies are compelled to improve the quality of their
services in the face of stiff competition.

TIANJIN, June 12 (Xinhua) -- China's welfare lottery sales have
been growing rapidly over the past two years, especially in large
cities as an increasing number of Chinese people want to become
millionaires overnight.
</P>
<P>
Statistics showed that 11 billion yuan worth of welfare lottery
was sold across the country from October of 1998 to June last year,
650 times that of 1987 when China first introduced the lottery
system.
</P>
<P>
Lottery has grown into the second largest activity after
tourism that ordinary people would like to spend their spare time
on.
</P>
<P>
Guangzhou, the capital of south China's Guangdong province
reported 2.7 billion yuan of lottery sales in 1999, while in
Tianjin and Shanghai, lottery sales both exceeded 1 billion yuan.
</P>
<P>
"Lottery makes people's life colorful. More importantly, it can
raise money for welfare projects and create jobs for laid-off
workers," said Guan Xinping, a sociology professor from Nankai
University in Tianjin.
</P>
<P>
Since 1987, China has sold 30 billion yuan worth of lottery
raising some 10 billion yuan in welfare capital to improve the
lives of the disabled, the old, and orphans in China.

<HEADLINE> Anxiety Haunts Quake Victims in Bengkulu, Indonesia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, June 12 (Xinhua) -- Many residents in the quake-hit
province of Bengkulu, Indonesia, are said to be mentally depressed
as aftershocks continue to rock there, a week after a powerful
earthquake killed about 133 persons and destroyed hundreds of
homes.
</P>
<P>
"Quite strong aftershocks have caused residents to be
traumatized," Bengkulu General Hospital's Zayadi Hussein was
quoted by national newspapers Monday as saying.
</P>
<P>
Hussein said there had been increasing symptoms of clinical
depression among residents. The most evident symptom was that
people were overacting to even the most minor things.
</P>
<P>
He pointed out that people rush out of buildings and into the
street at even the slightest vibration, such the rumble caused by
a passing truck.
</P>
<P>
Hussein also said the paranoia had reached a level where some
people would rush to wake up their neighbors and warn them of an
impending quake, even though the night had been calm.
</P>
<P>
"Another form of depression is that locals prefer to stay in
makeshift tents rather than their houses, even if the weather is
bad," he added.
</P>
<P>
But Bengkulu Psychiatric Hospital Director R. Budi Muljanto
said the depression had not reached a level serious enough to
require special treatment.
</P>
<P>
Seismologist Soehardjono said more than 1,400 aftershocks had
been recorded since the initial earthquake measuring 7.9 on the
Richter scale struck on the night of June 4.
</P>
<P>
The latest big aftershock hit at 06:24 a.m. local time on
Sunday (23:24 GMT Saturday) and had a magnitude 5.4 on the Richter
scale. It was centered beneath the Indian Ocean about 100
kilometers northwest of the badly damaged Bengkulu city, according
to the Meteorological and Geophysical Service.
</P>
<P>
The new tremor frightened residents. However, there were no
immediate reports of new injuries or damage.
</P>
<P>
It was reported that international aid has poured into the
province about 500 kilometers northwest of Jakarta. However, many
residents, who have sheltered beneath makeshift tents, have
criticized the government for reacting too slowly to the disaster.

CANBERRA, June 12 (Xinhua) -- Papua New Guinea's Bougainville
Revolutionary Army (BRA) got involved in the Solomon Islands'
armed conflict, the Australian Associated Press (AAP) reported
Monday.
</P>
<P>
Citing police in Honiara, the Solomon capital, which fell to a
Malaita Eagle force last Monday, AAP said Choiseul and Gizo
Islands were allegedly taken over Sunday by BRA guerrillas to "
protect" their allies, the Isatabu and Freedom Movement.
</P>
<P>
The report said communications with the two islands have been
shut down by the insurgents, but acting Honiara Police Commander
John Honelo heard from radio that the alleged BRA guerrillas now
control Choiseul and Gizo.
</P>
<P>
The Papua New Guinea-based BRA had fought a nine-year war of
secession with Port Moresby until a cease-fire in 1998.
</P>
<P>
Observers said the BRA was given weapons, medicines and refuge
by their Solomon kinfolk in Western Province, which also is
peopled by settlers from Malaita, according to AAP.

<HEADLINE> China Becomes Kodak's Second Largest Market </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, June 12 (Xinhua) -- China has become the second
largest market for the world's leading film producer, Eastman
Kodak Co., said the company's chief executive officer Daniel A.
Carp in Shanghai.
</P>
<P>
Carp came to China to attend the inauguration of Kodak's two
new plants in Xiamen and Wuxi over the weekend. Together with
these two new plants, Kodak now has 5,000 sales outlets across
China.
</P>
<P>
The new plant in Xiamen, a port city on China's southeastern
coast, has been Kodak's largest investment project in 30 years,
worth one billion U.S. dollars. It is so far the U.S. film company
's largest production center.
</P>
<P>
Kodak has set up plants in China for manufacturing cameras,
film development equipment, digital photography and X-ray films
for medical use.
</P>
<P>
Carp said that Kodak sees China as both a production center and
a booming market.
</P>
<P>
China's film market, which was ranked 17th among Kodak's
markets four years ago, has been growing at an annual rate of 10
percent, said Carp.
</P>
<P>
Carp announced there will be 10,000 sales outlets in China by
2003. He said that the market for film and photography is huge in
China's western region because of its unique landscapes and
scenery.
</P>
<P>
Kodak also wants a slice of China's digital photography market,
encouraged by the soaring demand for digital film in the country.
Last year, the market grew to 80 percent, according to China's
official statistics.
</P>
<P>
Carp said that Kodak is seeking cooperation with local Internet
portals in developing its B to C (Business to Consumer) network to
enable Chinese consumers to purchase Kodak's photograph and film
via the Internet.
</P>
<P>
The per-capita film consumption in China averages one roll a
year, as compared with 3.6 rolls in America. Only 15 percent of
Chinese own cameras.

<HEADLINE> Netherlands Oust Czech Republic with Last-Minute Penalty </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, June 11 (Xinhua) -- The Netherlands was awarded a
controversial penalty in the 89th minute to beat the Czech
Republic 1-0 in their opening Euro 2000 group D match in Amsterdam
of the Netherlands on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The Netherlands, co-hosts and tournament favorites, were under
huge pressure in the second half as the Czechs played tough and
aiming to earn a point for their spirited resistance.
</P>
<P>
With just 6 minutes on the regular clock, Ronald de Boer fell
in the area going for a high cross under pressure from Jiri Nemec
and Italian referee Pierluigi Collina pointed to the spot.
</P>
<P>
De Boer's twin brother Frank, the Dutch captain, scored from
the spot to send the Dutch crowd, almost silent throughout the
second period, into raptures.
</P>
<P>
In a frenzied finish Czech anger at the penalty decision led to
a incident on the touchline and Radoslav Latal, substituted in the
69th minute, was shown the red card by Collina.
</P>
<P>
"It was a scandal" said Czech coach Jozef chovanec after the
match. "I saw a similar penalty against Turkey earlier today (in
the game against Italy). I don't know what to think I am sad, for
me this is a scandal."
</P>
<P>
The Dutch, playing their first competitive fixture since the
World Cup in France two years ago, dominated the first half with
their classy passing moves.
</P>
<P>
They began the match as if they were playing yet another
friendly in their long build-up to the competition but although
Czech keeper Pavel Srnicek twice made important double saves, the
Dutch never seemed capable of raising their game.
</P>
<P>
The first double-save came after 14 minutes when first Patrick
Kluivert and then Dennis Bergkamp tested him. Three minutes later
Kluivert and Boudewijn Zenden forced him to react swiftly to
prevent a Dutch goal.
</P>
<P>
Bergkamp also went desperately close to marking his 75th
appearance for the Netherlands with a goal but his 19th minute
angled shot went inches wide of the far post.
</P>
<P>
The Czechs, fielding five men who played in the final of Euro'
96 -- Karel Rada, Karel Poborsky, Vladimir Smicer, Nedved and
Nemec played the far more direct football, especially after the
break when Nedved really took control of the midfield.
</P>
<P>
He was unlucky not to score after 58 minutes when he headed
against a post and saw the bounce along the goalline before Van
der Sar safely gathered.
</P>
<P>
Koller, who had scored 13 goals in his first 14 internationals,
also came agonizingly close six minutes later when he powered a
looping header over a stranded Van der Sar, only to see the ball
bounce off the bar.

<P>
BRUSSELS, June 11 (Xinhua) -- World Cup holders France swept
Denmark 3-0 on Sunday in group D, the toughest pool in the Euro
2000 tournament played in Bruges of Belgium.
</P>
<P>
Goalkeeper Fabien Barthez had to make good saves in the first
15 minutes to deny Danish strikers Ebbe Sand and Jon Dahl Tomasson,
but his teammates dominated the rest of the game since.
</P>
<P>
A 16th minute goal from defender Laurent Blanc gave France a 1-
0 lead and striker Thierry Henry sealed the victory to put France
at 2-0 with individual effort goal in the 64th minute.
</P>
<P>
Substitute Sylvain Wiltord scored in the dying seconds to
underline France's superiority after being presented with an open
goal by a pass from another substitute, Patrick Vieira.
</P>
<P>
The French fielded seven of the players who won the World Cup
two years ago against Brazil in Paris. Their solid defense was
such an important part of their 98 campaign but there were gaping
holes in it early on.
</P>
<P>
Barthez blocked Tomasson's close-range effort with his foot in
the second minute and had to dive low to the right to deny Sand 10
minutes later.
</P>
<P>
But the French, inspired by a confident performance in the
middle of the park by Zinedine Zidane, settled down to dominate
play even if they were too complacent at times.
</P>
<P>
The Blanc goal came after a penetrating run by striker Nicolas
Anelka into the box which forced Danish keeper Peter Schmeichel to
dive at his feet.
</P>
<P>
Schmeichel could only deflect the ball to his left and Blanc
pounced to score into an empty net.
</P>
<P>
Henry had threatened the Danish with his pace several times in
the first half and he left the Danes floundering midway through
the second half with a weaving run into the box from the left
before placing the ball in the opposite corner.

<HEADLINE> Turkish President to Attend Assad's Funeral </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, June 12 (Xinhua) -- Turkish President Ahmet Necdet Sezer
on Monday decided to attend the funeral of late Syrian President
Hafez al-Assad, the first trip abroad for the new president who
took office on May 16 and a move that surprised the observers here.
</P>
<P>
The abrupt decision, announced in a written statement from the
Presidency's press center Monday evening, came in contrast to
Sezer's refusal to attend the just-concluded summit of the 10-
member Economic Cooperation Organization held in Iran.
</P>
<P>
The Turkish Foreign Ministry explained that Sezer's busy
schedule in the early days of his presidency barred him from
leaving the capital.
</P>
<P>
Analysts here said that Sezer's trip to Syria is expected to
have a significant influence on the relations between the two
countries. Sezer will be accompanied by Minister of Culture
Istemihan Talay.
</P>
<P>
Syria and Turkey, which were at odds over security and water-
sharing issues for more than a decade, have remarkably improved
their relations since an agreement was signed in Adana, south
Turkey, in October 1998 on cooperation against terrorism.
</P>
<P>
Turkish State Minister Ramazan Mirzaoglu paid an official visit
to Syria last January. A large business delegation visited Syria
last month.

DAMASCUS, June 12 (Xinhua) -- Syrian Parliament Speaker Abdel
Qader Qadoura on Monday voiced confidence that Bashar al-Assad, son
and hand-picked successor of late President Hafez al-Assad, is
capable of addressing the challenges ahead.
</P>
<P>
Qadoura told a press conference that the ruling Baath Party had
been able to lay down solid bases and set up institutions to steer
the country over the past 37 years.

The parliament will take immediate action after receiving
official nomination of Bashar for presidency from the Baath

<HEADLINE> Saudi Arabia, Yemen Sign Border Accord </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUWAIT CITY, June 12 (Xinhua) -- Saudi Arabia and Yemen signed
in the western Saudi city of Jeddah on Monday a final land and sea
border agreement, following persistent bilateral efforts aimed to
close their long-running border dispute.
</P>
<P>
The deal was inked by the foreign ministers of the two Arab
neighbors, with the presence of Saudi Crown Prince and Deputy Prime
Minister Abdullah Ibn Abdul-Aziz and visiting Yemeni President Ali
Abdullah Saleh, said a joint communique issued at the end of
Saleh's two-day official visit.
</P>
<P>
The communique said the agreement outlines border coordinates
between the two countries for territory covered by the 1934 Taif
Agreement and annexes, which granted three provinces in the border
areas to Saudi Arabia.
</P>
<P>
The joint communique said leaders of the two sides held
extensive talks on bilateral ties and expressed satisfaction over
achievements in economic, commercial and cultural fields, according
to reports reaching here.
</P>
<P>
Saleh, who arrived in Jeddah on Sunday on his first official
visit to the Gulf kingdom in four years, met with both Saudi King
Fahd Ibn Abdul-Aziz and Prince Abdullah later Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Arab diplomatic sources in Saudi Arabia said the Saudi-
Yemeni talks focused on the issue of their borders demarcation.
</P>
<P>
Riyadh and Sana'a had to re-demarcate their land borders where
300 border signs had disappeared due to denudation and aging
factors.
</P>
<P>
They also needed to negotiate a settlement to the demarcation
of their maritime borders in the Red Sea.
</P>
<P>
Senior Saudi officials said earlier this year that following
several years of work of their joint committees in charge of
specifying the borders signs, most of the land border posts have
been relocated.

BEIRUT -- Lebanese President Emile Lahoud has issued a withering
attack on the United Nations for its handling of the process of
verifying Israel's troop withdrawal from south Lebanon, Daily Star
newspaper reported Monday.
</P>
<P>
In a memorandum to U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan, Lahoud on
Sunday expressed "surprise" at the fact that U.N. special envoy to
the Middle East Terje Roed-Larsen had insisted on a unique "
withdrawal line" instead of demanding that Israel pull back its
troops behind the internationally-recognized borders under U.N.
resolutions 425 and 426.
</P>
<P>
Lahoud complained that U.N. cartographers had rejected an
existing and recognized border to establish a "fictitious"
withdrawal line to be used as the basis for confirmation of the
Israeli pullout.(Lebanon-Israel-Withdrawal)

<TEXT>
<P>
BUENOS AIRES, June 12 (Xinhua) -- Paraguay's President Paraguay

concedes political asylum to ex-coup General, Lino Oviedo.
</P>
<P>
Gonzalez said that Paraguay will stimulate measures for
extraditing Oviedo, captured  Sunday in Brazilian city Foz de
Iguazu, according to reports coming from Asuncion, Paraguay's
capital.

of Vice President Luis Maria Argana's murder, carried out in
March of last year, and of the coup attempt of last month against
President Gonzalez.
</P>
<P>
The leader said that Oviedo's capture, "gives us a bit of
tranquillity, and allows us to fulfill our oath that impunity will
be banished from this country".
</P>
<P>
One of Oviedo's lawyers said that Paraguay's ex army leader
will request political asylum in Brazil following his detention in
this country in order to extradite him.
</P>
<P>
The ex-coup General took asylum on March 28, 1999 in Argentina,
from where he fled headed toward an unknown destination on the eve
of this country's President, Fernando de la Rua's taking of power
December 10, 1999.
</P>
<P>
Oviedo was sentenced to 10 years in prison for a coup attempt
in 1996 and of his sentence did eight months as his friend, former
President Raul Cubas, gave him freedom.
</P>
<P>

<HEADLINE> Fighting Drives Namibians to Seek Asylum in Botswana </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, June 12 (Xinhua) -- Hundreds of Namibians fleeing
fighting in the border areas between the Namibian army and the
Angolan rebels have crossed into Botswana, an Botswanan official
said in the capital Gaborone on Monday.
</P>
<P>
Botswanan President spokesman Festus Mogae Petlagano Gabasiane
said 896 Namibians seeked refuge in Botswana between January and
April this year, according to the South African Press Association.
</P>
<P>
"They were fleeing as a result of fighting between the Namibian
Defence Force and UNITA (National Union for the Total Independence
of Angola)," said Gabasiane.
</P>
<P>
Some 327 Angolans fled to Botswana in the same period to escape
fighting between UNITA and the Angolan government troops, the
spokesman added.
</P>
<P>
"They are running away from the war. That emerged from
preliminary interviews," he said.
</P>
<P>
Some 50 people have been killed on Namibia's northern border
with Angola since Namibia allowed the Angolan government forces to
use Namibian soil as a launch pad for attacks on UNITA last
December.
</P>
<P>
The Namibian government accused UNITA of launching cross-border
raids on its citizens.
</P>
<P>
The Angolan and Namibian asylum-seekers are being held in the
Dukwi refugee camp north of Gaborone.
</P>
<P>
The refugees were being interviewed by representatives of the
United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees and the Botswanan
government to establish whether they qualify for asylum, Gabasiane
said.

<HEADLINE> UN Appeals for $378 Million to Feed Drought Victims in Horn of Africa </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ADDIS ABABA, June 12 (Xinhua) -- The United Nations Monday
launched here an appeal for 378 million U.S. dollars to meet the
immediate needs of millions of people affected by drought in the
Horn of Africa.
</P>
<P>
The appeal constitutes food and non-food items to cater for
13.4 million people affected in Ethiopia, Kenya, Eritrea, Somalia
and Djibouti, for the period between June and December 2000.
</P>
<P>
According to a press release by the UN Office for the
Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs, the present emergency
situation was caused by three consecutive years of poor rains and
total failure of the rains last April.
</P>
<P>
The UN appeal seeks 302 million U.S. dollars for food and
another 76 million U.S. dollars for shelter, health, water and
sanitation.
</P>
<P>
With 90 percent of the total drought affected population, the
hardest hit are Ethiopia and Kenya. Ethiopia is by far the most
affected with 10 million of its 63 million people needing
assistance, followed by Kenya, where 2.2 million people need food
aid.
</P>
<P>
Some 193.4 million U.S. dollars out of the total appeal is
believed to address the needs of affected people in Ethiopia.
</P>
<P>
"Timely assistance is the difference between survival and death
for a large section of the 13.4 million people, mostly women,
children and elderly persons", said Catherine Bertini, UN special
Envoy for the Drought in the Greater Horn of Africa.

<HEADLINE> Tanzanians Urged to Protect Youth From HIV/AIDS </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, June 12 (Xinhua) -- Tanzanian President Benjamin
Mkapa urged his fellow citizens on Monday to protect the young
people from falling victim to the wide spread of HIV/AIDS.
</P>
<P>
In an opening speech for the annual Uhuru (Freedom) Torch Race
with the theme of "Year 2000 Youth against HIV/AIDS", he called on
Tanzanians to uproot the common belief that youth are HIV/AIDS
free thus making adults both male and female hunting for them.
</P>
<P>
"These are shameful habits that need to be fought by everybody
in the society and anybody with such a habit should stop it
immediately," he said.
</P>
<P>
He also encouraged his people to uphold some beneficial tribe
traditions like total banning of sexual practices before or
outside marriage.
</P>
<P>
He admitted that high unemployment had forced many youth
especially young women into commercial sex.
</P>
<P>
"In Tanzania it is estimated that in every two barmaids and
every two commercial sex workers, one is HIV/AIDS positive," he
disclosed.
</P>
<P>
Last week, Mkapa appealed to parents to advise their children
to undertake HIV/AIDS test prior to marriage and to openly discuss
the subject as it is the only way of reducing the spread of the
fatal disease.
</P>
<P>
It is estimated that among every 100 Tanzanians, ten are HIV
positive, mostly young people under the age of 40 years old.

<P>
PARIS, June 12 (Xinhua) -- French President Jacques Chirac
congratulated Monday afternoon Brice Fleutiaux, the French
freelance photographer who was freed by the Russians after living
in captivity for eight months in Chechnya.
</P>
<P>
In a telephone conversation with Fleutiaux, Chirac also asked
about his health situation and said he was ready to meet him as
soon as he returns to France, said French presidential spokeswoman
Catherine Colonna.
</P>
<P>
Fleutiaux was also received for half an hour by Russian
President Vladimir Putin Monday afternoon in the Kremlin.
</P>
<P>
The Russian Interior Ministry said that Fleutiaux, 32, was
freed Monday by Russian security forces in a military operation
without deal or ransom.
</P>
<P>
The details about the situation of his liberation remain
unknown.
</P>
<P>
He was kidnapped by Chechen rebels on October 1, 1999, soon
after he arrived at Grozny.
</P>
<P>
His fate drew great attention from the public in France after a
dramatic video tape on which he was seen wearing a black Caucasus
cap and black costume in his captivity was shown on French
television.
</P>
<P>
On the video tape, apparently taken with professional
techniques, he was seen kowtow to the audience pleading for help
to obtain his release.

Fleutiaux's parents, wife and brother all expressed relief
after the French and Russian governments announced his freedom
earlier Monday.

LUSAKA, June 12 (Xinhua) -- A South African plane has crashed
into the Zambezi River killing two pilots on the spot after it hit

</P>
<P>
The incident happened at Likanda area in Katimamulilo, Western

passengers on the plane.

The District Administrator, Robert Sipilanyambe, has confirmed
the incident. Meanwhile, Zambia Revenue Authority in conjunction

<HEADLINE> Ugandan Central Bank Intervenes in Currency Market </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KAMPALA, June 12 (Xinhua) -- The Bank of Uganda, the country's
central bank, intervened Monday in the foreign exchange market on
the sale side to the tune of 10 million U.S. dollars, according to
a press release from the bank.
</P>
<P>
The Monday's action brings total intervention on the sale side
to 98.5 million U.S. dollars since January this year, said the
release.
</P>
<P>
"The bank continues to monitor closely developments in the
foreign exchange market and will not hesitate to intervene when
necessary," the release added.
</P>
<P>
The local currency on Sunday was traded at 1,635 shillings
against the dollar, from an average of 1,555 shillings earlier
last week.
</P>
<P>
Analysts have blamed the shilling's depreciation on poor
exports, especially coffee, Uganda's major foreign exchange
earner.
</P>
<P>
However, the clashes between Ugandan and Rwandan troops in
Kisangani, a city in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, in the
last few days was also blamed for the pressure on the shilling.

<HEADLINE> Shas Minister's Comments Stir Israeli Political Spectrum </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, June 12 (Xinhua) -- An ultra-Orthodox Israeli
minister drew wide criticism at home for his comments relating one
of his cabinet colleagues and an anti-religious party with Nazism.
</P>
<P>
Sholomo Benizri, health minister from the religious ultra-
Orthodox Shas party, on Monday accused Education Minister Yossi
Sarid of incitement against his Shas party, which he compared with
Nazis' incitement against the Jews during the Holocaust.
</P>
<P>
Benizri pinned the Education Ministry's opposition to more
funding for the almost bankrupt religious education network run by
Shas on Sarid's "blind hatred" of Shas.
</P>
<P>
The funding issue has exacerbated the current government crisis,
with 17 Knesset (parliament) members of the Shas threatening the
coalition government, of which Shas is the second biggest partner,
with their votes last week in the Knesset preliminary reading for
an opposition bill calling for early parliamentary election.
</P>
<P>
In addition, Benizri also termed Yosef Lapid, leader of the
anti-religious Shinui Party, as a "Super Haider," referring to the
Austrian extreme-rightist politician Joerg Haider notorious for his
sympathetic remarks about Hitler and Nazism.
</P>
<P>
Benizri's comments have invited fierce criticism from across
Israel's political spectrum as well as from the Yad Vashem
Holocaust Memorial in Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
Prime Minister Ehud Barak swiftly condemned Benizri's
provocative remarks, saying that despite political differences,
there is no place for the Holocaust to be dragged into a political
debate. The prime minister also appealed for restraint and
tolerance.
</P>
<P>
The opposition Likud party, which sided with Shas in voting for
the early-election bill, also denounced Benizri's comments. Likud's
caucus whip Reuven Rivlin chided Benizri of "lack of knowledge
about the Holocaust."
</P>
<P>
The Yad Vashem Holocaust Memorial in Jerusalem has also
criticized the lippy Shas minister. It protested that the
Holocaust, during which 6 million Jews were killed by the German
Nazis during the World War II, was being exploited by politics and
called on all politicians to stop.
</P>
<P>
The furor came against the backdrop of the ongoing coalition
crisis in the Jewish state. Shas, the third largest party in the
Knesset after Barak's One Israel Party and Likud, hardened its
positions in negotiations with the ruling One Israel.
</P>
<P>
One Israel charges that Shas has backtracked on their latest
agreements. Following the Knesset vote on the early-election bill,
Barak has been trying to keep Shas in the coalition on condition
that Shas will withdraw its support for the bill in future votings.
</P>
<P>
Shas officials agreed that they have altered their prior
positions and want more of a say in the Middle East peace process
and domestic social issues.
</P>
<P>
Barak has reportedly been ready to allocate 25 million shekels
(6 million U.S. dollars) to cover Shas' educational deficit. Shas
was annoyed by Sarid's left-wing Meretz Party due to Sarid's
refusal to fund Shas' educational network unless it improves its
inefficient management and fires corrupt officials.
</P>
<P>
Shas is also demanding that its private radio stations be
granted broadcasting licenses.
</P>
<P>
Benizri said Shas' vote for last week's bill was a warning
signal. "If it does not work, Shas will bolt the coalition."
</P>
<P>
In a bid to assuage the coalition bustup, Minister in Prime
Minister's Office Haim Ramon is seeking an urgent meeting with Shas
spiritual leader Ovadia Yosef, who has the final say in Shas
affairs.
</P>
<P>
Under the Transition Law, Barak has until Tuesday to decide
whether to carry out his earlier threat to fire the defecting
ministers from the Shas party, the National Religious Party and
Yisrael Ba'aliya party who voted for the early-elections bill last
week.
</P>
<P>
In the wake of the frustration in the Knesset last week, Barak
has decided to form a new coalition similar to the existing one
instead of a narrow one without the maverick ruling partners who
voted for the early-elections bill.

<HEADLINE> Arafat Participation in Al-Assad's Funeral to Open New Chapter in Ties: Official </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, June 12 (Xinhua) -- The participation of Palestinian
leader Yasser Arafat in the funeral of the late Syrian President
Hafez al-Assad will open a new chapter in bilateral relations, a
Palestinian minister said on Monday.
</P>
<P>
Al-Assad died of a heart attack on Saturday. Arafat arrived in
Cairo earlier Monday en route to Damascus to take part in al-
Assad's funeral, scheduled to take place on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Arafat's participation is a sign to demonstrate the appreciation
of the long-standing relations binding the Palestinians and Syria,
Minister of Parliamentary Affairs Nabil Amr was quoted as saying by
Egypt's Middle East News Agency.
</P>
<P>
It has been widely maintained that Arafat and al-Assad had tense
relations due to Palestinians' signing of peace accords with Israel
unilaterally. Damascus hosts several hardline factions of the
Palestine Liberation Organization, of which Arafat is the chairman.
</P>
<P>
But Amr said the Palestinian-Syrian relations have never been
tense.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, he expressed confidence that Arafat's visit to Syria
will afford an opportunity to forge a new relationship with al-
Assad's successor, his son, Bashar.
</P>
<P>
Bashar has been promoted to the commander-in-chief of the armed
forces and nominated for the presidency.
</P>
<P>
Arafat last visited Syria in 1996.

ATHENS, June 12 (Xinhua) -- The throne of Zeus, father of gods,
was made from gold and ivory and was built in the 8th century BC,
a Greek archaeology professor said Monday.

At the archaeological site of Ideon Andron, Professor
Sakelarakis found small ivory pieces, and he believed that many of
the ivory pieces belonged to a glorious throne made of gold and
ivory that was inside the cave temple.

It is believed to be a significant archaeological finding that

<HEADLINE> Security Council Meets on DRC </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, June 12 (Xinhua) -- The U.N. Security Council
Monday began a closed-door session to discuss the latest
developments in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC), where
Ugandan and Rwandan troops were engaged in armed conflicts.
</P>
<P>
The Council meeting came after U.N. Secretary-General Kofi
Annan condemned the "reckless, senseless" fighting between Ugandan
and Rwandan forces in the DRC city of Kisangani and said that he
would ask the 15-nation Security Council to take steps to end it.
</P>
<P>
The Monday meeting also took place after both Uganda and
Rwanda announced over the weekend the withdrawal of their troops
from the northeastern city in the central African country.
</P>
<P>
Uganda said Sunday its forces had withdrawn from their
positions in Kisangani after a week of fighting with Rwandan
troops there. On the same day, Rwanda announced that it was
withdrawing from Kisangani after calm returned to the war-torn
city of Kisangani following the heavy clashes.
</P>
<P>
U.N. observers in Kisangani said that the Ugandans had pulled
back to the northern side of the Tshopo river bridge Saturday
night, marking a drastic shift of the urban front line dividing
the two armies.
</P>
<P>
Since close allies began a broader war against DRC President
Laurent Kabila nearly two years ago, Uganda and Rwanda have turned
their guns on one another.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. Mission in the DRC, known as the MONUC, currently
comprises about 130 military observers and support staff. They
include 20 observers in Kisangani who are now being reinforced and
located with both the Ugandan and Rwandan troops.
</P>
<P>
The Security Council on February 24 authorized the increasing
force to 500 military observers and some 5,000 soldiers to protect
them and provide logistics. But Annan has not yet been able to
certify that security and other conditions permit them to be
deployed in the country, formerly known as Zaire.

<HEADLINE> Security Council Meets on Cyprus </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The U.N. force was established through Security Council
Resolution 186 of 1964 with the mandate to prevent a recurrence of
fighting between the Greek Cypriot and Turkish Cypriot communities.
</P>
<P>
Following the hostilities of 1974, the Council adopted a number
of resolutions expanding the mandate of the UNFICYP to include
supervising a de facto cease-fire and maintaining a buffer zone
between the lines of the Cyprus National Guard and of the Turkish
Cypriot forces
</P>
<P>
In the absence of a political settlement to the Cyprus problem,
the UNFICYP continues its presence on the island.
</P>
<P>
Under the current circumstances, the presence of the UNFICYP "
remains indispensable" for the maintenance of the cease-fire
between the two sides, said Annan. The UNFICYP now has over 1,200
troops.
</P>
<P>
Reviewing the developments in the past six months, he said the
situation along the crease-fire lines was stable and noted an
increase of contacts between Greek and Turkish Cypriots and the
decision by the Turkish side to lift measures affecting travel.
</P>
<P>
Annan's proposal came before the third round of proximity talks
between the Turkish Cypriot and the Greek Cypriot communities
begins in Geneva in early July.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus, an eastern Mediterranean island country, has been
divided into the Turkish Cypriots-controlled north and the Greek
Cypriots-dominated south since 1974 when Turkish troops invaded
and occupied the northern third of the island in the wake of an
abortive pro-Athens military coup in Nicosia.
</P>
<P>
The United Nations has tried to reunite the island but talks
between the two communities have produced no tangible results.
</P>
<P>
The Turkish side has maintained that the only way out of the
issue is to establish a confederation on the basis of two states,
an idea rejected by the Greek state and the international
community at large.

<HEADLINE> UK Consumers Face Price Hike </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, June 12 (Xinhua) -- Britain's service sector is growing
strongly and providers of services to consumers plan to raise
their prices sharply over the next three months, according to a
business survey published Monday.
</P>
<P>
The survey by the Confederation of British Industry (CBI) shows
the first rise in confidence among consumer-services firms since
September which is regarded as a sign of lifting prices.
</P>
<P>
The CBI's quarterly survey said that a balance of 39 percent of
consumer-services firms plan to raise their prices over the next
three months, more than double the 19 percent three months ago.
</P>
<P>
Roger Bootle, an adviser to Delotte's, said: "If the prices of
consumer services rise over the next three months at the sharp
rate indicated in the survey, it would probably be a concern to
the Bank of England."
</P>
<P>
The Bank's monetary policy committee has highlighted strongly
rising service-sector prices in its recent discussions.
</P>
<P>
However, the CBI said that overall, the message of the survey
is that growth was "fairly" stable and is so far not creating
inflationary pressure.

<HEADLINE> UK Taxes On Pay Among Lowest In EU </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, June 12 (Xinhua) -- Tax and social security deductions
in Britain are among the lowest in the European Union, according
to a study published Monday.
</P>
<P>
But average earnings in the UK lag behind those in many high-
tax European countries, putting take-home pay in the UK in the
middle of the league table, said the study by William Mercer, the
management consultants.
</P>
<P>
Average British annual take-home pay amounts to 15,819 pounds,
well behind the German average of 18,550 pounds and the French
average of 16,899 pounds.
</P>
<P>
Executives in the UK lie fourth in the EU executive pay table,
with average post-tax earnings of 42,512 pounds but UK workers are
only eighth in the wider EU table.
</P>
<P>
The range of tax burdens in the EU is as wide as ever,
according to the research. The proportion of pay withheld runs
from 18 percent in the Irish Republic to 42 percent in Belgium.
</P>
<P>
Mercer said that generous state benefits are not always
accompanied by high tax and social security contributions. Spain,
Greece and Portugal are low down the EU table of contribution
scales, with employers paying much of the burden.
</P>
<P>
David Formosa, senior researcher at Mercer, said: "Despite the
pressures for tax harmonization, it's unlikely the high tax
countries will make significant reductions in the near future."
</P>
<P>
"Generous social security systems will be hard to cut back," he
added.

</P>
<P>
The survey was launched in Panama City by Panamanian President
Mireya Moscoso and UNICEF Regional Director Per Engebak.
</P>
<P>
The study, called "Voices of Children and Adolescents in Latin
America and the Caribbean," was developed among some 13,000
children in both rural and urban areas in 20 countries of Latin
America, the Caribbean, Portugal and Spain.
</P>
<P>
The children, aged 9-18, were 50 percent boys and 50 percent
girls, and they were corresponding to a population group of 103
million.
</P>
<P>
For the analysis of the results, the age bracket 9-13 and 14-
18 were used, and results were further segmented by age, sex,
rural/urban residence and socio-economic level -- high, medium and
low.
</P>
<P>
Several countries in the region will present the adoption of
the report to the specific country situation in the framework of
which the participation of prominent social and political
personalities is being considered.
</P>
<P>
The executive director of the UNICEF, Carol Bellamy, said, "
the undertaking of this regional survey is a very exciting example
of how important it is to allow children and adolescents to voice
their opinions on the very issues which affect them -- such as the
quality of their education, their physical safety and their access
to information on their rights."
</P>
<P>
"Children are not only our future, they are our present and we
need to start taking their voices very seriously," Bellamy said. "
In September 2001, the U.N. will be reviewing the commitments
which governments have made at the World Summit for Children. This
survey is just one more step towards allowing youth to be active
participants in the process."
</P>
<P>
The main findings of the survey will be made by the UNICEF's
regional director Engebak, who will hand the report over the
Panamanian president.

<HEADLINE> Bomb Blast Could Affect S. African Tourism: Official </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, June 12 (Xinhua) -- The car-bomb explosion
outside a popular restaurant in Cape Town on Saturday night could
affect tourism in South Africa, Cape Town tourism manager Sheryl
Ozinsky said on Monday.
</P>
<P>
He said every bomb blast and every incident of crime affected
tourism and the confidence of visitors.
</P>
<P>
"We are appalled at the latest incident. Thank God no one was
badly injured," Ozinsky said. "We really need to get these
perpetrators behind bars."
</P>
<P>
Two people, including a five-year-old child, were treated for
shock when the device detonated outside New York Bagels and Sit-in
Deli Restaurant around 8:00 p.m. on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Police have established that the car, a red Toyota Corolla, in
which the bomb had been placed, had been hijacked in Diepriver on
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
On that day two men robbed a 33-year-old man of his car when he
stopped in Ruchill Street around 8:00 p.m.
</P>
<P>
The motorist had been closely questioned by police but was
unable to identify the hijackers as they wore masks.
</P>
<P>
Several witnesses have given police information about the blast
but investigators remain in the dark about possible motives for
the attack.

<HEADLINE> Two S. African Opposition Parties to Cooperate in Local Elections </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, June 12 (Xinhua) -- The South African opposition
Democratic Party (DP) leader Tony Leon said Monday it was possible
for the New National Party (NNP) to consider his party's proposals
on cooperation in the November local government elections.
</P>
<P>
In a statement issued after a meeting with NNP leader Marthinus
van Schalkwyk, Leon warned, however, that the DP was not prepared
to change the basis of the agreement between the parties in the
Western Cape coalition government.
</P>
<P>
Their talks followed a DP federal council proposal on Sunday
that the NNP fight the poll under the DP banner.
</P>
<P>
Van Schalkwyk rejected this as "either extreme arrogance or
politically naive", and the NNP also threatened to reduce the
number of DP members in the Western Cape cabinet.
</P>
<P>
Leon said his talks with Van Schalkwyk were conducted in a
"positive atmosphere".
</P>
<P>
"I expect that the NNP will table a response to the DP proposal
and this will be considered," he said.
</P>
<P>
"I believe it is possible for the DP and the NNP to take
further the proposals made yesterday at the DP federal council,"
he said.
</P>
<P>
The DP, however, remained totally committed to consolidating
the opposition in South Africa and would continue to work toward
this goal, he said.
</P>
<P>
The DP has four out of 12 members in the coalition cabinet in
Western Cape.
</P>
<P>
Leon said on Sunday that the best way to ensure that democracy
worked was to build an opposition that could bring the ruling
African National Congress below 50 percent of the vote.
</P>
<P>
"It makes no sense for the DP and the NNP to continue fighting
for the support of opposition voters. It is time to put South
Africa first," Leon said.
</P>
<P>
The DP was recognized as the leading opposition party by South
Africans from across the political spectrum.
</P>
<P>
"It makes no sense to give up this clear identity and our
sharply defined message of strong, effective and principled
opposition. It is thus the DP's duty to lead the consolidation of
the opposition," he said.

<HEADLINE> Illegal Aliens Apply for Resident Permits in S. Africa </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESUBURG, June 12 (Xinhua) -- Illegal aliens have flooded
the South African Home Affairs Department with residence permit
applications since a Constitutional Court ruling suspended certain
sections of the Aliens Control Act last year.
</P>
<P>
Briefing a parliament committee on proposed amendments to the
Act, home affairs legal officer David Ramagalela said Monday the
court's suspension of article 25 (9)(b) of the act had effectively
forced his department to issue immigration papers to thousands of
foreigners married to South Africans.
</P>
<P>
Many of the foreigners had not been married to South African
spouses at the time they entered the country, but were now able to
apply for residence permits under the terms of last year's ruling,
Ramagalela said.
</P>
<P>
While many of the illegal foreigners were suspected of being
involved in illegal activities, it was difficult to refuse a
permit on the basis of unproven allegations, he said.
</P>
<P>
The Constitutional Court last year ruled that some of the
provisions of the Aliens Control Act infringed on the right of
South Africans who were married to foreigners to live with their
spouses.
</P>
<P>
Constitutional Court Judge Kate O'Regan noted in her ruling
last year that the act allowed no automatic right to a residence
permit, but required that each application be considered on merit.
</P>
<P>
O'Regan said the past practice had forced South Africans who
were married to foreign spouses to either go abroad with their
partners, or remain behind alone, pending the outcome of the
application.
</P>
<P>
The committee is trying to introduce amendments to the act
which will justify the refusal of a temporary residence permit.
</P>
<P>
Earlier, committee members -- with the exception of the
Democratic Party -- voted in favor of the Identification Amendment
Bill, which provides for the cessation of all forms of
identification except bar-coded green ID books.

<HEADLINE> Angola on Alert of Possible Food Crisis in Central Highland </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUANDA, June 12 (Xinhua) -- Angola's health services have
warned that there could be a food crisis in the next three months
in the country's central highland, especially in Huambo Province,
following the reduction of international aid, the official news
agency Angop reported Monday.
</P>
<P>
The humanitarian aid including the basic necessities
distributed by the World Food Program (WFP) to the central Huambo
Province has been reduced by 75 percent since May which the health
services said was the main cause of the food crisis in Huambo, a
province that suffered the most fierce civil conflicts in the past
25 years.
</P>
<P>
The crisis could affect over 1.6 million people, with the
300,000 displaced persons living in the central highland being the
hardest hit victims, said the health services.
</P>
<P>
The reduction of the humanitarian aid to Huambo is due to an
accord between the Huambo provincial government and the WFP, the
report said.
</P>
<P>
But some non-governmental organizations (NGO) considered the
accord as " extemporary" and would lead to a "totally ruined"
result.
</P>
<P>
The Representative of an Italian NGO said that the next three
months could be "dark" in terms of food security for the
population living in Huambo, adding that it is worrying that the
WFP reduced the aid from 4,000 tons to 1,100 tons per month to
Huambo in a period without good perspective in agricultural
production.
</P>
<P>
According to statistics, 57 children in the central hospital of
Huambo died of malnutrition from January to May, while other 366
are being treated in the hospital. During the same period,
nutritional centers in the Huambo City, capital of the province,
have lodged 9,560 children suffering from malnutrition.

CAIRO, June 12 (Xinhua) -- The following are economic briefs
from the Middle East countries.
</P>
<P>
ANKARA -- Turkey is taking advantage of its rich geothermal
resources for heating and other purposes.
</P>
<P>
Minister of Energy and Natural Resources Cumhur Ersumer, who
attended the World Geothermal Congress in Japan, said that Turkey
is ranked the fifth among the countries using geothermal energy for
heating and is expected to become the first in 2010.

ABU DHABI -- Demand for assembled and compact PCs is expected to
grow rapidly in the United Arab Emirates (UAE) as Dubai prepares to
make information technology its engine of growth.
</P>
<P>
More than 1.4 million PC units were shipped to the Middle East
and North Africa region last year and the recent policy initiatives
in Dubai, Egypt and Bahrain will push overall sales further.
</P>
<P>
An ongoing IT exhibition, staged at the Dubai World Trade
Center, is a clear indication of the increasing use of personal
computers and the subscriber base for the Internet, which is
currently estimated at 160,000.
</P>
<P>
The UAE has registered remarkable growth in the use of Internet,
which is bound to result in incremental PC and accessory sales in
the long run, especially when shopping online and other virtual
activities become a normal day-to-day activity.
</P>
<P>
CAIRO -- Arab investment in Egypt stood at 3.92 billion U.S.

<HEADLINE> India Reiterates Support for Sri Lanka's Unity </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
COLOMBO, June 12 (Xinhua) -- Visiting Indian External Minister
Jaswant Singh Monday reiterated India's support for the unity,
sovereignty and territorial integrity of Sri Lanka which has been
troubled by an upsurge in the long-running civil war.
</P>
<P>
Singh made clear India's stand during his discussions with Sri
Lankan President Kumaratunga and Foreign Minister Kadirgamar, said
a Sri Lanka-India joint statement released at the end of Singh's
two-day visit.
</P>
<P>
The statement said Singh expressed "the continued commitment of
the Government of India to the unity, sovereignty and territorial
integrity of Sri Lanka."
</P>
<P>
He also conveyed the good wishes and support of the Indian
government to the restoration of a lasting peace through a
possible political process which would result in a settlement
satisfactory to all communities.
</P>
<P>
Singh is the first Indian minister to visit Sri Lanka since
April when the civil war flared up between government troops and
the separatist rebels of Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE).
</P>
<P>
President Kumaratunga apprised Singh of the current war
situation and political developments, including the consultations
between the government and other political parties and the
facilitation efforts of Norway.
</P>
<P>
Kumaratunga welcomed India's offer to be of assistance in the
humanitarian as well as economic sphere to ease and constraints
that may be currently faced by Sri Lanka, the statement said.
</P>
<P>
India has ruled out military involvement in the island nation's
civil war which the LTTE rebels are fighting for a separate
homeland for minority Tamils in the island's north and east since
1983.
</P>
<P>
However, India has been in close contact with the Sri Lankan
government and promised brokering peace and humanitarian
assistance if asked.
</P>
<P>
Singh brought a credit amounting to 100 million U.S. dollars
from India during this visit, as well as the possibilities of Sri
Lanka's purchasing wheat, rice and sugar on a counter trade basis
from India.
</P>
<P>
During his visit, Singh also met opposition leader Ranil
Wickremesinghe as well as representatives from other political
parties.
</P>
<P>
Singh, who came here Sunday afternoon, is scheduled to return
to New Delhi Monday evening.

Lhasa, June 12 (Xinhua) -- No deaths have been reported on the
June 10 landslide in eastern Tibet as all residents near the scene
of the landslide have been rushed to safe areas, local media
reported today.
</P>
<P>
The landslide occurred in Yigong Township in Bomi County on
April 9, destroying seven kilometers of highways, blocking the
Yigong River and leaving more than 4,000 residents homeless.
</P>
<P>
The water level of the river-turned Lake has continued to rise
despite a ditch diverting water from the blocked river dug out by
local soldiers and civilians with the help of a team of engineers
dispatched by the State Flood Control Headquarters.
</P>
<P>
On June 8, high temperature led to the melting of a
considerable amount of ice and snow in the nearby mountains. The
water level of the lake rose dramatically.
</P>
<P>
On the evening of June 10, the torrent waters from the lake
completely destroyed the ditch. Nearby roads, bridges and
telecommunications facilities were damaged.
</P>
<P>
The local government immediately took measures to evacuate all
residents in potential flood areas.

<HEADLINE> Estrada Vows to Defend National Sovereignty </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, June 12 (Xinhua) -- Philippine President Joseph Estrada
renewed Monday his commitment to defend the nation's sovereignty
even as he called on the Filipino people to stand united against
the bigger war of eradicating poverty in the country.
</P>
<P>
In his speech at the main program and parade at Rizal Park in
Manila commemorating the 102nd anniversary of Philippine
Independence, the president expressed confidence that this goal
can be achieved with the support of the people.
</P>
<P>
"We commemorate the 102nd year of our independence today firm
in the conviction that we will overcome. We will face the
challenges and we will seize the opportunities that have been
denied us in the past," the president said.
</P>
<P>
According to the president, the nation today is facing
obstacles to its progress, including challenges to peace and order,
the economy, and territorial integrity.
</P>
<P>
Many of these problems, he noted, stemmed from decades of
official neglect, which his administration is trying to correct
now.
</P>
<P>
But the biggest problem, the president said, is to have the
Filipino people unite behind the government as it works to address
the causes of poverty.
</P>
<P>
His administration, he said, will continue to pursue poverty
alleviation and to improve the quality of life of the people.
</P>
<P>
The president said he has placed the poor at the center of the
government's development efforts, and mobilized the entire
government machinery to implement this pro-poor agenda.
</P>
<P>
However, Estrada stressed that the government will not be
intimidated by groups out to sow terror and violence. "We will not
be enslaved by fear and intimidation," he said.
</P>
<P>
The president said he must fulfill his duty and lead the police
and military in defending the nation's sovereignty from all
threats.

<HEADLINE> More Filipino Workers Deployed Abroad in 1st Quarter </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, June 12 (Xinhua) -- The number of Filipino workers
deployed overseas grew by about one percent in the first quarter,
and the number is expected to further increase in the months ahead
because of the extended armed conflict in Mindanao.
</P>
<P>
Ernesto Herrera, a lawmaker of the House of Representatives,
said Monday that 230,310 workers were deployed overseas from
January to March this year, or 1,886 more than the 228,424
deployed over the same period of 1999.
</P>
<P>
Herrera, meanwhile, said the raging armed conflict in Mindanao
would force more Filipinos to seek employment overseas.
</P>
<P>
To help ease unemployment in Mindanao, Herrera urged the
agencies responsible for rehabilitation work in strife-torn areas
to give priority employment to residents displaced from their
homes and livelihood.
</P>
<P>
"Labor-intensive rehabilitation projects, particularly those
involving the restoration of damaged public infrastructure, should
be encouraged to provide emergency employment to evacuees,"
Herrera said.
</P>
<P>
Labor officials earlier predicted an increase in unemployment
in Mindanao because of the continuing military offensives against
the Moro Islamic Liberation Front (MILF).
</P>
<P>
The offensive on MILF positions have caused the evacuation of
at least 500,000 civilians since April 27, when the military
launched attacks on rebel encampments along the Narciso Ramos
Highway.

proliferation of the "Love Bug" virus.
</P>
<P>
The damage caused by the virus is estimated to be in the
billions of U.S. dollars after it infected millions of computers
around the world starting May 4.
</P>
<P>
The virus was later traced to the Philippines, particularly to
the house of Guzman's family in Manila. The NBI raided the Guzman
residence on May 8.
</P>
<P>
Opinion said the charges t be filed against Guzman might
include theft, malicious mischief, and violation of the credit
card law.
</P>
<P>
"The charges are still under study. This is a combined legal
study by the Department of Justice and the NBI to ensure an
airtight case against Guzman," said Opinion.
</P>
<P>
The NBI is basing its charges against Guzman on his graduation
thesis proposal which was rejected. In his proposal, he reportedly
described the virus. The NBI is also basing its case on the fact
that virus attack was traced to his house's phone number.

<HEADLINE> Uganda to Double Cargo Transport Via Tanzanian Port </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, June 12 (Xinhua) -- A senior Ugandan official
has said that Uganda has planned to increase cargo handled through
Tanzania's Dar es Salaam Port from the current 15,000 tons to
30,000 tons per month by December 2000.
</P>
<P>
The East African, a Nairobi-based English weekly, Monday quoted
the resident representative of the Uganda Railways Corporation in
Tanzania Godfrey Tindimwebwa as saying that the Dar port handled
an average of 4,000 to 5,000 tons of Ugandan cargoes monthly in
1996 and 1997, the amount has been increased to between 15,000 and
22,000 tons a month at present.
</P>
<P>
The official said that many Ugandan businessmen have resorted
to the Dar port because it is less congested than the traditional
port of Mombasa in Kenya though clearing goods through the Mombasa
port is cheaper.
</P>
<P>
It costs 832 U.S. dollars to clear and transport a 20-foot
container from Mombasa to Kampala, Tindimwebwa said, adding that
while it costs about 1,534 dollars to clear and ship the same
container from Dar to Kampala.
</P>
<P>
While Mombasa may be cheaper than Dar, "businessmen worry more
about timely delivery of cargo," he said, adding "what a customer
wants is safety to goods, and the shortest transit time."
</P>
<P>
He said he is hopeful that handling and transportation costs of
Ugandan cargoes via Dar port will go down after negotiations with
the Tanzania Railways Corporation and the Tanzania Harbor
Authority.

<HEADLINE> Former University Don to Lead Center-Left Party in Ghana Poll </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, June 12 (Xinhua) -- A former university don has been
elected as the presidential candidate for the center-left
Convention People's Party (CPP) to contest the December's
elections in Ghana, the Ghana News Agency reported on Monday.
</P>
<P>
Professor George Hagan, former dean of the Institute of African
Studies, University of Ghana, won 58.8 percent of the vote of the
delegates of his party in a run-off on Sunday and immediately
named Alhaji Ibrahim Mahama, a lawyer who supported him in the
run-off, as his running mate.
</P>
<P>
The CPP is an off-shoot of a party with the same name that was
founded and led by Ghana's first president Kwame Nkrumah who was
ousted in a coup engineered by the Central Intelligence Agency of
the United States in 1966.
</P>
<P>
Nkrumah, a fiery socialist, died in Romania in 1972.
</P>
<P>
The party has been struggling to regain its feet in recent
times. Its off-shoot, the People's National Party, won the poll in
1979 but was ousted by President Jerry Rawlings in the 1981
elections.
</P>
<P>
The CPP is the fifth party to declare their candidates for the
December elections.
</P>
<P>
President Rawlings had announced that he would not participate
in the contest. His party, the National Democratic Congress, has
nominated Vice President John Mills as its presidential candidate.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the center-right New Patriotic Party (NPP) has
nominated John Kufuor, the United Ghana Movement, a break-away
group of the NPP, has elected Charles Wereko-Brobby, and the
People's National Convention, a break-way of the CPP, has named
Edward Mahama as candidates.

Program, is expected to analyze the achieved experience in making
sound industrial policies for small and medium-sized enterprises.
</P>
<P>
The workshop, the first of its kind in Kenya, is a result of a
previous visit by a SELA delegation to Kenya in May 1999 to
explore possibilities of promoting cooperation between Latin
American countries and the African continent.
</P>
<P>
"This is a critical conference for Kenya, which will boost the
country's industrial transformation and poverty eradication,"
said Kenya's Minister for Planning Gideon Okemo when officially
opening the workshop.
</P>
<P>
SELA, a regional inter-governmental organization, groups 28
Latin American and Caribbean countries with an aim to promote
economic cooperation between its member states.
</P>
<P>
Small and medium-sized enterprises employ about 61 percent of
labor force in Kenya and contribute to 18 percent of the country's
gross domestic product, according to the Labor and Human Resource
Development Ministry.

<TEXT>
<P>
MOGADISHU, June 12 (Xinhua) -- The loud noise of heavy machine
guns and assault rifles could be heard on Sunday night around the
former presidential palace in central Mogadishu, which is now
resided by faction leader Hussein Mohamed Aidid.
</P>
<P>
Eyewitnesses said there had been an exchange of fire between
mutineers and loyalists of Aidid near the residence of their
master.
</P>
<P>
There was no word of casualties over the fighting on Sunday
night, however, there had been some damage to the walls of
buildings around the area where the fighting took place.
</P>

sources said.
</P>
<P>
According to the local daily Qaran published on Monday, the
mutineers are complaining about lack of proper care from Aidid.

There has been no word as yet from Hussein Aidid himself over
the fighting and his relation with the militiamen.
</P>
<P>
The mutineers looted the former presidential palace four days
ago, taking away ammunition, furniture and everything they could
lay their hands on, in protest against Aidid's treatment towards
them.

<HEADLINE> Putin Urges Effort to Strengthen Russia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, June 12 (Xinhua) -- President Vladimir Putin urged
Russians on Monday to make their country a united and strong power,
Interfax News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
Putin made the appeal in a speech delivered at a banquet
marking the 10th anniversary of the adoption of the Declaration of
Russia's Sovereignty, it reported.
</P>
<P>
The Supreme Soviet of Russia, then a republic within the
Soviet Union, passed the document on June 12, 1990, proclaiming "
absolute sovereignty" of Russia over the Soviet Union and setting
the pace for the eventual disintegration of the Union.
</P>
<P>
June 12 was originally known as Independence Day for Russia,
but authorities later renamed it National Day on the grounds that
the country has never been a colony.
</P>
<P>
The document completed the entire epoch and set Russia on a new
course of development, said Putin.
</P>
<P>
People thought it simple to build a new state 10 years ago, but
the illusions had to be given up quickly, Putin admitted.
</P>
<P>
"Now, we know how hard it is to reform the economy," he noted.
</P>
<P>
Putin took over from Boris Yeltsin as Russia's second
president since the breakup of the Soviet Union on December 26,
1991. He was officially sworn in early last month.
</P>
<P>
Yeltsin, who resigned abruptly on New Year's Eve and appointed
Putin as the acting president, attended Monday's banquet at the
Kremlin, Interfax reported.
</P>
<P>
In the speech, Putin said he encountered many disappointed and
confused people during his tour around the country.
</P>
<P>
"Our sacred duty is to show them the way to the end of the
tunnel today," he said. "Together, we will make Russia a united
and strong power."

<HEADLINE> Capital Market to Spur Development In Western China (2) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Scholars also suggest that western China should issue financial
commercial bonds and take the lead to issue bonds for
construction of local basic projects.
</P>
<P>
Venture capital investment funds should be established to
support the development of high-tech and new industries in western
China, they added. Funds for the development of western China,
however, cannot be provided solely by the State.
</P>
<P>
"Western development initiatives will be a daydream without
investment, making it an urgent necessity to boost the capital
market," said Wei Houkai, a research fellow from the CASS Western
Development Research Center.
</P>
<P>
People have increased their deposits in recent years and it is
an ideal choice to invest the deposits in the capital market,
economic experts said.
</P>
<P>
Restructuring the economic system will also provide a huge
demand for the surge of the western region capital market.
</P>
<P>
Authorities said that the conditions for a soaring capital
market have already become mature in western China, citing that
the area already has securities and market intermediaries. Western
China can learn from eastern China in developing its capital
market.

<HEADLINE> Verdict Hailed for Judging in Light of Theory of Law (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 12 (Xinhua)-- As there are no written laws to
decide a case involving a trade mark case between a Hong Kong
company and a Guangdong company, judges from China's Supreme
People's Court decided to pass their judgment on the case. This
has been hailed by law experts at a recent law seminar in Beijing.
</P>
<P>
This case demonstrates the authority of the supreme court in
interpreting laws when no formal laws exist.
</P>
<P>
Yang Zhenshan, law professor from the China University of
Political Science and Law, pointed out that the judgment provides
a good precedent in integrating Chinese judicial practice with
international practice.
</P>
<P>
According to the supreme court, the relevant facts in the case
are as follows:
</P>
<P>
The trade mark TMT and other two were designed, used and
registered abroad by the Hong Kong-based TMT Company.

<TEXT>
<P>
Twenty years ago, TMT authorized Guangdong Light Industrial
Products Imports &AMP; Exports Co. to register the trade marks in
China with the agreement that the registered trade marks would be
exclusive TMT products. It was difficult for an overseas firm to
register a trade mark in China when the country was just
initiating economic reforms in the early 1980s.
</P>
<P>
The fact that the TMT trade marks had two users gave rise to
the disputes between the two companies.
</P>
<P>
In 1998, TMT Company took out a lawsuit against the Guangdong
company and in October 1998, Guangdong Provincial Higher People's
Court ruled that the Guangdong company return the trade marks to
TMT and TMT compensate the former a sum of 500,000 yuan.
</P>
<P>
The Guangdong company appealed against the ruling to the
supreme court. On May 15 this year, the supreme court gave the
judgment that the Guangdong company return the trade marks to TMT
and TMT compensate the former a sum of 2.5 million yuan.
</P>
<P>
Experts believe that the verdict will play a positive role in
enacting entrustment laws in China.

that nine-year compulsory education is made available to all the
school-age children, and illiteracy among youths and adults is
eradicated, Li said. The central government and local governments
should continue to support education in the west. Schools in
eastern China should help schools in poverty-stricken areas to
improve working conditions and the quality of teaching.

<HEADLINE> Golan Druze Scuffle with Israeli Police </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, June 12 (Xinhua) -- Over 100 Druze residents on the
Golan Heights scuffled with Israeli police Monday morning for being
unable to enter Syria to attend Tuesday's funeral for late Syrian
President Hafez al-Assad.
</P>
<P>
Hundreds of Druze people had been gathering at the Quneitra
Border Gate between Syria and the Israeli-occupied Golan Heights
since early morning, Israel Radio reported.
</P>
<P>
They were waiting for making their journey to Damascus for the
funeral of Assad, who died of heart attack Saturday at age 69.
</P>
<P>
However, among the 180 Druze who were permitted to travel for
this purpose by the Israeli Interior Ministry, only some 50 were
allowed to cross over by the Syrian side. The Syrians did not give
the reason for turning back the others.
</P>
<P>
Israeli soldiers and riot police tried to block the crowd, but
many of the Druze vented their anger and frustration at them. Some
pushing and shoving broke out between the two sides.
</P>
<P>
There was no report of casualties.
</P>
<P>
Israel captured the Golan from Syria in the 1967 Middle East war
and the return of the strategic plateau remains the major
contention point between Israeli and Syrian negotiators since they
began peace talks in the early 1990s.
</P>
<P>
There are nearly 17,000 Druze residents on the highland.Some 3,
000 of them have Israeli citizenship, but most are still loyal to
Syria and President Assad.
</P>
<P>
Druze villages on Golan had declared three days of mourning over
the death of Assad, and thousands of residents rallied in public
places for mourning, holding Assad's pictures embroidered with
black ribbon.
</P>
<P>
Syrian national flags also flew at half-staff, a move openly
challenging Israel's 1981 decision to annex Golan.
</P>
<P>
To facilitate Druze's travel, Israeli Interior Minister Natan
Sharansky Sunday ordered his officials to expedite the application
process for one-time permit to cross over to Syria. Those attending
the funeral are due to return Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Students, Red Cross officials and religious figures are usually
granted to enter Syria through border crossings between Syria and
the Golan Heights.

CAIRO, June 12 (Xinhua) -- The following are the economic news
briefs from the Middle East countries.
</P>
<P>
ABU DHABI -- The United Arab Emirates supported the increase of
Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC)'s crude oil by
500,000 barrels per day.
</P>
<P>
Officials said that this proposed increase is consistent with an
accord reached by the world oil cartel in Vienna last March over
the output increase if prices rise above 28 U.S. dollars a barrel
for 20 consecutive days.
</P>
<P>
It was expected that OPEC will be forced to increase production
if the world oil prices maintained their current levels until the
next
meeting of OPEC.
</P>
<P>
CAIRO -- A delegation of Saudi Arab's Economic and Industrial
Chamber will arrive in Cairo on June 20 for a three-day visit to
explore investment opportunities in Egypt.
</P>
<P>
ABU DHABI -- The United Arab Emirates granted two batches of
more than 7.435 billion dirhams (about 20,5 million U.S. dollars)
in loans to Jordan for projects in cultivating agricultural lands,
building dams and developing the basin of Yarmuk river.
</P>
<P>
ABU DHABI -- Demand for personal computers is expected to grow
rapidly in the United Arab Emirates (UAE) as the country prepares
to make information technology its engine of growth.
</P>
<P>
Internet users are currently estimated at 160,000 in UAE, which
is among the countries where the use of internet has registered
remarkable growth. "It is bound to result in incremental sales of
PCs in the long run, especially when e-business becomes a normal
day-to-day activity," one manager said.

<HEADLINE> TNC Happy with Chinese Partnership: Director </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SINGAPORE, June 12 (Xinhua) -- A director from The Nature
Conservancy (TNC), an international non-governmental organization,
declared Monday that her organization is happy with its Chinese
partnership in promoting nature conservation and has made very
good successes in its project in China's Yunnan Province.
</P>
<P>
"The thing really remarkable is that it is really a joint
project and we are working very closely together just like in a
family," Carol M. Fox , director for Program Development Asia/
Pacific of the TNC told a press conference held here to announce
the Inaugural Meeting of TNC Asia Pacific Council scheduled for

goals through compatible development strategies.
</P>
<P>
Fox said a Chinese delegation of six high level officials
visited the United States some time ago to look at nature parks
and check up with nature conservation and they made a beautiful
report after return.
</P>
<P>
"The biggest challenge for all of us is that it is moving so
quickly in China," she said, noting she was told during her last
trip to Yunnan that the tourist number in the LiJiang area has
gone up from 4,000 to four million in the past few years.
</P>
<P>
She said her organization is involved in a master plan for the
area which is about the size of Ireland or of the U.S. state of
West Virginia, adding "we'll get ready the vast plan ready by
September 30 this year and that will be incorporated in the 10th
Five-Year Plan of China."
</P>
<P>
According to Fox, The Nature Conservancy, with 2,200 full-time
staff and 1,000,000 membership, is an international non-profit
organization and has been the private sector leader in preserving
Earth's rare plants, animals, and ecosystems by protecting the
lands and waters they need to survive.
</P>
<P>
Its protection projects with partner organizations cover more
than 10 million acres in the U.S. and Canada, and more than 80
million acres in 26 countries in Latin America and the Caribbean,
and Micronesia, Melanesia and Asia.
</P>
<P>
The TNC Asia Pacific Council which is co-chaired by Singapore
Senior Minister Lee Kuan Yew and Goldman Sachs group's Chairman
and CEO Henry M. Paulson, consists of more than forty top public
and private sector leaders from Asia, the U.S. and Europe.
</P>
<P>
At its inaugural meeting here in August, members of the TNC
Asia Pacific Council will review major conservation and economic
development issues and make recommendations for collaborative
conservation action across the region, a press release from TNC
said.

<HEADLINE> Poverty Alleviation No.1 Priority of Aid: Japanese Ambassador </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, June 12 (Xinhua) -- Poverty alleviation takes the
highest priority of Japan's aid to Bangladesh, Japanese Ambassador
in Dhaka Shigeharu Maruyama told the United News of Bangladesh
Monday.
</P>
<P>
Outlining the Country Aid Plan for Bangladesh, the envoy said
agricultural and rural development, improvement of social areas,
basic infrastructure and disaster management are also among the
priorities of Japanese economic cooperation in the country.
</P>
<P>
Japan is examining scope for more cooperation in basic
infrastructure areas like power generation, rail and road
transport and telecommunications, he said.
</P>
<P>
Maruyama said Japan is also interested in assisting Bangladesh
to combat serious air pollution in Dhaka and enormous arsenic
problem that affects roughly 20 million people in the country.
</P>
<P>
Japan's loan aid to Bangladesh amounted to 3 billion U.S.
dollars between 1994 and 1998, while its grants figured 2.8
billion dollars during the same period.
</P>
<P>
Referring to the investment environment in the country, the
Japanese envoy regarded political unrest, image problem and
inadequate infrastructure as factors that hinder growth of foreign
investments, including those from Japan.

<HEADLINE> Anti-Budget General Strike Observed in Bangladesh </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, June 12 (Xinhua) -- Countrywide anti-budget general
strike called by the combined opposition was observed almost
peacefully Monday, partially disrupting daily life and business.
</P>
<P>
The four-party opposition alliance comprising the Bangladesh
Nationalist Party, Jatiya Party, Jamaat-e-Islami and Islami Oikya
Jote (Islami Solidarity Front), called for the dawn-to-dusk
shutdown against what they said government's "anti-people budget
for 2000-2001."
</P>
<P>
In the capital, though most of the shops and offices were
closed, some shops, particularly hardware stores, offices and
banks were seen open under half shutter.
</P>
<P>
People were seen moving from one place to another boarding
various modes of vehicles, including state-run and private buses.
</P>
<P>
Government offices were in operation with comparatively thin
attendance. Educational institutions were closed during the strike.
</P>
<P>
Pro-strike activists brought out processions in different parts
of the capital. However, there was no report of any untoward
incident.
</P>
<P>
Finance Minister Shah AMS Kibria last Thursday placed a
national budget of 8.5 billion U.S. dollars for fiscal 2000-2001
in the parliament, showing an overall deficit of 3.7 billion
dollars.
</P>
<P>
The finance minister proposed to meet the big deficit from
foreign grants and loans, domestic sources and from bank
borrowings.
</P>
<P>
The Federation of Bangladesh Chambers of Commerce and Industry
(FBCCI) has expressed concern at deteriorating fiscal deficit and
higher borrowings by the government from banking sector. In its
initial reaction on the budget, FBCCI said on Sunday that
borrowing by the government will crowd out the private sector from
settling funds from the banks.
</P>
<P>
FBCCI also expressed its concern over the fact that the budget
does not provide definite guideline for creation of employment
opportunities and growth of manufacturing sector.
</P>
<P>
However, FBCCI appreciated the new budget for providing
incentives for capital market development, relief for the small
tax payers, widening the tax-net and further streamlining the tax
administration.
</P>
<P>
It also hailed increased allocation for education and healthy
sectors and further strengthening of special measures addressing
poor.

<HEADLINE> Consultative Group on Mozambique Successful: Minister </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MAPUTO, June 12 (Xinhua) -- Mozambican Finance Minister Luisa
Diogo has commended the World Bank's Consultative Group meeting on
Mozambique held in Paris last Thursday and Friday as "very well".
</P>
<P>
In addition to the financial pledges made, the meeting also
reached the consensus that under the current conditions Mozambique
will have difficulty in attaining a two-digit economic growth if
there are no changes in certain areas, she was quoted by Monday's
independent newsheet Metical as saying.
</P>
<P>
Diogo listed the infrastructure of the economy, agricultural
policy and regional imbalance as some of the areas that need
reforms and improvement.
</P>
<P>
There was consensus that there must be "improved performance in
these areas in order to step up the rate of growth", she said.
</P>
<P>
The Consultative Group meeting brings together all Mozambique's
major international partners, and is the forum where the financing
needs of the economy are discussed.
</P>
<P>
According to Diogo, donors and funding agencies gathering in
Paris had promised to offer 530 million U.S. dollars (75 percent
in grants and 25 percent in soft loans) to Mozambique this year,
more than the 504 million dollars requested by the Mozambican
government.
</P>
<P>
Diogo said, the Paris meeting gave "indicative figures" of 560
million dollars in 2001, of which 75 to 80 percent will be in the
form of grants. The figure is also more than the 514 million
dollars mentioned in the government's document submitted to the
meeting.
</P>
<P>
"There were no deep divergences among the country's foreign
partners," the minister said, noting that "the main differences
were in how to implement the recommendations."
</P>
<P>
"Some of the Nordic countries were in favor of strengthening
direct funding for the budget. Others stressed a sectoral
approach. Others thought that, before embracing the model of
increased direct funding for the budget, there must be
improvements in budgetary management," she said.
</P>
<P>
The Mozambican government is in favour of a gradual approach,
increasing direct funding for the budget "as we improve the
management of the budget", she said.
</P>
<P>
The meeting also recommended that the government should
increase the amount of taxes collected while reducing tax rates,
she said.

<HEADLINE> Nigerian Government Calls to Implement New Minimum Wage </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Lagos, June 12 (Xinhua) -- The Nigerian government has directed
all of its ministries and extra ministerial departments to pay the
new national minimum wage without further delay, the News Agency
of Nigeria reported on Monday.
</P>
<P>
Nigerian Vice President Atiku Abubakar said at a meeting in the
capital Abuja Sunday that the federal ministry of finance had
directed the accountant-general of the federation to make funds
available to the federal establishments to enable them to pay the
new salaries.
</P>
<P>
The federal government was also releasing funds to states to
enable them to implement the new wages in their states, he said.
</P>
<P>
Abubakar gave his assurance that workers in the country would
receive the new minimum wages before the end of this month.
</P>
<P>
The Nigerian government increased the minimum monthly wage to
7,500 naira (75 U. S. dollars) for public servants and to 5,000
naira (50 U. S. dollars) for workers in the public sectors in May.
</P>
<P>
However, some ministers and state governors refused to pay the
new wages on the grounds of insufficient funds.

<HEADLINE> France Conducted Nuclear Tests in Paris Suburb in 1955-1960: Report </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, June 12 (Xinhua) -- The French government conducted some
of its primary nuclear testing in a Paris suburb during 1955-1960,
which could possibly have left the test site contaminated by
radioactive substances, said a report by the daily Le Parisien
Monday.
</P>
<P>
Lucien Beaudouin, a 79-year-old retired engineer at the Atomic
Center of Vaujours in Seine-Saint-Denis north of Paris, said the
Center worked on the effect of nuclear explosives on metals. The
location was well known publicly as a site for testing military
planes.
</P>
<P>
The explosives were reportedly part of the first nuclear bomb
France tested in the Sahara Desert in Algeria in 1960, said
Beaudouin.
</P>
<P>
"All were tested, the iron, the lead and the uranium. But it
was ordinary uranium and we didn't work with plutonium," he added.
</P>
<P>
He said that some tests were conducted underground, and some in
the air, which could have contaminated the surrounding area of the
Center with radioactive substances.
</P>
<P>
"Pieces of uranium shot like rockets in the air. The
disintegration of uranium could have produced other very dangerous
metals and the gas could also have escaped, which was much more
radioactive than uranium," he said.
</P>
<P>
The retired scientist estimated that several kilograms of
uranium could have fallen into the field in a range of from 100 to
150 meters outside the Center.
</P>
<P>
The atomic test center was closed by the French government in
1997 and its 45 hectares of land are up for sale.

SEOUL, June 12 (Xinhua) -- South Korean officials to be
traveling with President Kim Dae-jung to Pyongyang Tuesday for a
historic summit said Monday they hope the talks will create a
foundation for the North and South of the Korean Peninsula to cope
with the tragedy of national division.
</P>
<P>
However, they cautioned that people should not expect too much

</P>
<P>
South Korean news agency Yonhap quoted Unification Minister
Park Jae-kyu as saying that the delegation will not hastily pursue

step-by-step manner.
</P>
<P>
Kim Min-ha, senior vice chairman of the Advisory Council on
Democratic and Peaceful Unification, said people should not expect
too much, adding that what is important is that such talks should
continue after the summit and the delegation will do its best in a
calm manner to help make the talks successful.
</P>
<P>
Presidential Chief of Staff Han Kwang-ok hopes the talks will
serve as the first step for the two sides to heal the pain of
separated Korean families and to pursue co-prosperity.
</P>
<P>
On Sunday, Seoul and Pyongyang agreed to postpone their
scheduled landmark summit by one day, from June 12-14 to June 13-

<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, June 12 (Xinhua) -- The following are major news
items in leading U.S. newspapers on Monday.
</P>
<P>
The Washington Post:
</P>
<P>
-- The new high-tech global economy that is pumping up
employment and home ownership in most U.S. cities is also creating
"staggering jumps" more than 1.5 times faster than the rate of
inflation, according to a new study by the Department of Housing
and Urban Development.
</P>
<P>
The New York Times:
</P>
<P>
-- The party and nation that Hafez Assad ruled for 30 years
until his death moved swiftly on Sunday to appoint his son Bashar
as Syria's new president.
</P>
<P>
-- Microsoft is mobilizing a pervasive lobbying and public
relations campaign in an effort to temper the impact of a
potentially devastating federal court ruling and generate positive
public and political opinion.
</P>
<P>
-- According to a new federal report, a warming of the global
climate is likely to have substantial consequences -- for better
and worse -- around the United States in coming decades, including
bumper crops in the heartland, chronic erosion of coasts, summer
water shortages and winter floods in the west and a future New
York city that steams in summer like present-day Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
The Wall Street Journal:
</P>
<P>
-- Regardless of where they live, today's movie fans can use
the Web to access the movie-marketing materials that flood the U.S.
before a film's release. So Hollywood, which used to sell its
movies in the domestic market first, is rushing toward all-at-once
global distribution for many films.

<TEXT>
<P>
CHONGQING, June 12 (Xinhua) -- China plans to foster an active
capital market as part of a national campaign on developing the
country's western area.
</P>
<P>
"The central government is looking into a number of policies to
support the formation and development of the western capital
market," said Gan Fangqian, deputy director of the Regional
Economic Development Department of the State Development Planning
Commission (SDPC), at an International Symposium on developing
China's western region today.
</P>
<P>
Chinese officials of the western region participating in the
symposium said they are taking measures to enhance the ability of
local financial institutions in collecting funds, draw more idle
funds to develop the economy, and encourage more high-tech
companies to be listed on the stock market.
</P>
<P>
"As the largest city in western China, Chongqing is encouraging
more overseas financial institutions to set up business offices
here, setting up regional commercial banks, raising the amount of
funds collected by banks, and making social assets more active,"
said Wang Hongju, vice-mayor of Chongqing Municipality.
</P>
<P>
Western Chinese provinces and Chongqing can collect funds
through local banks, lotteries, and other kinds of funds, said
Zhang Hanya, director of the Investment Research Institute of the
SDPC.
</P>
<P>
A paper presented by the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences (
CASS) at the Symposium suggests that a long-term bond exchange

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 12 (Xinhua) -- Wei Jianxing, a Standing Committee
member of the Political Bureau of the Communist Party of China (
CPC) Central Committee, met with an Indonesian delegation of
leaders of Islamic parties led by Aisyaah Aminy here today.
</P>
<P>
Wei, also a member of the Secretariat of the CPC Central
Committee, stressed that the CPC hopes to conduct new exchanges
and cooperation with all major Indonesian parties on the basis of
the principles of independence, absolute equality, mutual respect
and non-interference into each other's internal affairs.
</P>
<P>
Wei hailed the friendship between China and Indonesia.
Indonesia is one of the earliest countries to establish diplomatic
ties with China, and the two countries were both advocates of the
Bandung Asian-African Conference, he added.
</P>
<P>
During his visit to China in December last year, Indonesian
President Abdurrahman Wahid and Chinese President Jiang Zemin
reached consensus and understanding over the establishment of good-
neighborly bilateral ties of mutual-trust featuring comprehensive
cooperation, Wei said.
</P>
<P>
In May this year, both foreign ministers signed a joint
statement concerning bilateral cooperation in the future, paving
the way for the development of bilateral ties of mutual interest
and cooperation, he noted.
</P>
<P>
Wei pointed out that both China and Indonesia are important
developing countries. The development of friendly cooperative ties
between the two countries is not only in the fundamental interests
of both peoples, but also beneficial to peace and stability in the
region and the world as well.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese government appreciates the Indonesian government's
position on the issue of Taiwan and human rights, he added, hoping
that both countries will enhance friendly cooperation and be good
neighbors and good friends forever.
</P>
<P>
Aminy praised the achievements China has made since it
initiated reforms and opening up twenty years ago, indicating that
the achievements would have been impossible without the forceful
leadership of the CPC.
</P>
<P>
Aminy also highly valued the principles the CPC advocates in
governing party-to-party relations.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Doctors Succeed in Non-Thoracotomy Cardiac Surgery </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 12 (Xinhua) -- By drilling three keyhole-size
holes on the patient's right chest, Chinese doctors have
successfully conducted non-thoracotomy surgery to treat auricular
septal defects, a common congenital heart disease.
</P>
<P>
The doctors inserted a thoracoscope through the hole with a
less than one centimeter in diameter to guide a blockade device
into the cardiac atriums.
</P>
<P>
A healthy person's right and left atriums are separated by a
complete diaphragm. However, auricular septal defects causes
abnormal blood circulation and heart failure.
</P>
<P>
According to today's Beijing-based "Guangming Daily," that the
surgery, conducted on April 30 by doctors at the Cardiovascular
Surgical Department of Xijing Hospital in northwest China's Xi'an
City, is the first of this kind in the world.
</P>
<P>
The 21-year-old female patient was discharged from the hospital
five days after surgery and is reportedly doing well.
</P>
<P>
Compared with traditional surgical method to repair auricular
septal defects, non-thoracotomy surgery can reduce both
operational risks and suffering.

<HEADLINE> Manila Takes "Cooling Off" Period in Hostage Negotiations </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, June 12 (Xinhua) -- The Philippine government said
Monday it is taking three to four days as "cooling off" period in
the negotiations with the Abu Sayyaf to study what options to take
in the wake of the new demands by the group now holding 21
hostages in Sulu.
</P>
<P>
Executive Secretary Ronaldo Zamora told reporters that the
government decided Sunday to let things "cool off" in the meantime
to give the government enough time to examine the new demands made
by the Abu Sayyaf.
</P>
<P>
"We decided we are going to take three to four days off to
review it. Then we will see what has to be done. Basically we
decided yesterday it may be a good idea to let things cool off,
for us to examine these new demands they have made," Zamora said.
</P>
<P>
He also called on the public and the international community to
remain patient as the government exhausts all possible means to
resolve the situation peacefully.
</P>
<P>
Earlier, the Abu Sayyaf claimed it wanted Executive Secretary
Ronaldo Zamora to replace Secretary Robert Aventajado,
presidential flagship projects committee chief, as head of the
government negotiating panel.
</P>
<P>
The Abu Sayyaf slammed Aventajado for hinting at the
possibility of using military means to solve the hostage crisis if
negotiations fail.
</P>
<P>
In Jolo, Sulu, Governor Abdusakur Tan, a member of the
government negotiating panel, said they have not yet received a
formal statement from the Abu Sayyaf that they want Aventajado out
of the panel as chief negotiator.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Press Secretary and Presidential Spokesman Ricardo
Puno said that President Joseph Estrada has not instructed any
change in the membership of the government panel tasked to
negotiate for the safe release of the 21 mostly foreign hostages.
</P>
<P>
But even if there were some changes in the membership, Puno
said, the government will not change its stand on the demands the
Abu Sayyaf had made.
</P>
<P>
However, Puno said the government will remain open to the group
and stressed that it is still keeping all communication lines open.
</P>
<P>
The Abu Sayyaf, which kidnapped the hostages from the Sipadan
Island resort in Malaysia on April 23, was said to have separated
its captives into two groups for fear of government military
rescue operations.

NAIROBI, June 12 (Xinhua) -- The use of narcotic drugs in
Kenya's secondary schools and colleges has been increasing as drug
traffickers seek to expand their markets, the country's major
newspaper Daily Nation reported on Monday.
</P>
<P>
According to a Daily Nation investigation team, drugs are cheap
and can be bought in students' dormitory.
</P>
<P>
Solid and bhang are two kinds of drugs being mostly used and
peddled on campus, the team said.
</P>
<P>
"The drugs available include cocaine, heroin and Mandrax
tablets," a consultant psychiatrist at the Jomo Kenyatta
University of Agriculture and Technology was quoted as saying on
condition of anonymity.
</P>
<P>
"I know many cases in which students have had their exams
postponed after making an appeal to psychiatrists that they can
not manage in that state," he said.
</P>
<P>
According to the psychiatrist, some students were already
addicted when joining university and others began using drugs on
campus.
</P>
<P>
However, Vice Chancellor of the University of Agriculture
Ratemo Michieka denied the rampant drug abuse at the institution.
</P>
<P>
"If there are a few cases here, it should not be taken to mean
that the whole student community is involved," Michieka said.
</P>
<P>
The latest statistics by the Anti-Drugs Organization of Kenya
show that over 10 percent of male high school students in Kenya's
Central Province regularly abuse drugs.

<HEADLINE> Talks on Ending Nigeria's Fuel Price Crisis in Deadlock </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, June 12 (Xinhua) -- The Nigerian government and the
Nigeria Labor Congress (NLC) Sunday night ended another round of
negotiations in deadlock in the capital Abuja to conclude the
strike on the petrol price hike, local media reported on Monday.
</P>
<P>
President Olusegun Obasanjo and Vice President Atiku Abubakar
were reportedly in attendance of the negotiation.
</P>
<P>
After the meeting, NLC leader Adams Oshiomhole urged the
country's highest decision-making organ, National Executive
Council (NEC), to convene for finding a way out of the current
crisis.
</P>
<P>
The government gave no new offers during the talks, he said,
adding that NLC accepted nothing above the former price of 20
naira per liter of fuel (one U. S. dollar equals to 100 naira).
</P>
<P>
NLC launched the ongoing strike shortly after the Nigerian
government announced the increase of petrol price by 50 percent to
30 naira per liter on June 1.
</P>
<P>
It is reported that several people have been killed and more
wounded in violence in the strike over the last two days. So far
hundreds of rioters have been arrested.
</P>
<P>
The government announced a five-naira-per-liter reduction for
petrol and diesel, and a 10-naira-per-liter reduction for kerosene
last Thursday, but NLC refused to call off the strike.

<HEADLINE> Over 30,000 Tourists Booked for Kenya </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, June 12 (Xinhua) -- More than 30,000 tourists mainly
from the United Kingdom have made advance bookings with Kenya
Airways to spend their holidays at Kenya's coast beach hotels.
</P>
<P>
The East African Standard newspaper Monday quoted the national
carrier's commercial director Bram Stella as saying that the
tourists are expected to arrive in Kenya in the next five months.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a recent annual meeting of the Kenya Association of
Travel Agency held here, Stella disclosed that about 30,000
tourists are destined to Mombasa, an Indian Oceanic port city in
southeastern Kenya, 2,000 to Malindi and 400 to Lamu, both tourist
spots along the country's coast.
</P>
<P>
At the meeting, Kenyan Tourism Minister Nicholas Biwott urged
association members to adhere to professional ethics and identify
new tourist destinations in the country.
</P>
<P>
The government is formulating a policy framework paper to
enable the promotion of tourist destinations in East Africa, he
said.
</P>
<P>
The Kenya Wildlife Service will this year spend 5 million U.S.
dollars, donated by the European Union, on promoting tourism and
conservation for attracting more overseas tourists to the country.
</P>
<P>
Kenya earned 21.4 billion shillings (about 3 million U.S.
dollars) from tourism in 1999, compared to 17.5 billion shillings
(about 2.5 million dollars) in the previous year, and received
969,300 foreign visitors in 1999 as against 894,300 in 1998.

<HEADLINE> Tanzania Warns Against Foreign Interference in October Elections </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, June 12 (Xinhua) -- Tanzania has warned that no
foreign interference is allowed in the forthcoming general
elections in October so as to guarantee the people to choose their
own leaders freely and fairly, local newspapers reported Monday.
</P>
<P>
President Benjamin Mkapa told a public rally in the inland
capital Dodoma on Sunday that Tanzania appreciates the moral and
financial support from the foreign donors and observers, but that
does not give them the right to interfere in the elections
process.
</P>
<P>
He said donors and observers can communicate with all political
parties in Tanzania, but it should be done lawfully and according
to the set procedures.
</P>
<P>
There are certain election observers who have the habit of
giving instructions and orders to the people or electoral bodies
on how to execute democratic elections, said Mkapa, without
identifying the nationality of these observers.
</P>
<P>
"Let the people choose their own leaders. If you are here as
election observers, do your job, don't teach us politics." he
said.
</P>
<P>
Mkapa also warned Tanzanian political parties against seeking
foreign instructions, saying "parties that receive orders and
directives from abroad would bring back colonization."
</P>
<P>
He promised that the National Electoral Commission will be
provided with sufficient resources to enable it to conduct
elections freely and fairly, cautioning that whoever would breach
the law on the excuse of exercising democracy would be dealt with.
</P>
<P>
Mkapa was chosen by Tanzania's ruling Chama cha Mapinduzi (CCM)
party last Saturday as the sole presidential candidate to run for
his second five- year term in the October 29 general elections.
</P>
<P>
The elections will be the second multi-party elections in
Tanzania since 1995.

<HEADLINE> Funeral for Ann Tse-kai Held in Hong Kong (2) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Ann Tse-kai, a well-known public figure in Hong Kong, was
elected a vice-chairman of the National Committee of the CPPCC in
1993, enjoying the status of a state leader.
</P>
<P>
Ann was also a member of the Standing Committees of the Sixth
and Seventh CPPCC National Committees.
</P>
<P>
Ann Tse-kai was born in Shanghai in 1912. He studied Chinese
literature and economics in his early years, and later learned
foreign languages including English, Japanese, French, German and
Spanish, laying a strong foundation for his later life in
international trade.
</P>
<P>
Ann came to Hong Kong after the Japanese invasion in 1938. He
headed for the southwestern city of Chongqing when Hong Kong
fought a war against Japanese troops in 1941.
</P>
<P>
After the war, Ann returned to Hong Kong and settled down here
in 1949, beginning his success story in the fields of business,
politics and linguistics. He engaged in the textile industry in
Hong Kong in the 1950s, served in Hong Kong as member of the
Legislative Council and Executive Council and chaired the Hong
Kong Trade Development Council and the Federation of Hong Kong
Industries in the 1970s.
</P>
<P>
And in the 1980s, Ann served as a member of the Standing
Committee of the CPPCC National Committee while serving as vice-
chairman of the Committee for Drafting the Basic Law of Hong Kong
Special Administrative Region and chairman of the Consultative
Committee on Hong Kong Basic Law.
</P>
<P>
In the 1970s, Ann made painstaking efforts to promote
development of Hong Kong's foreign trade by traveling around the
world to promote sales of Hong Kong products.

<P>
In the early 1980s when some people in Hong Kong, due to lack
of knowledge about China's policy, were worried about their future
in connection with China resuming the exercise of its sovereignty
over Hong Kong in 1997, Ann was very confident.
</P>
<P>
During his 1982 trip to Beijing, Ann expressed his opinions to
Chinese leaders on the importance of continuance of Hong Kong
economic progress. He wrote articles on interdependence of
economies in Hong Kong and the mainland, calling for strengthening
economic ties.
</P>
<P>
At the second session of the Sixth CPPCC National Committee
held in 1984, Ann put forward 16 suggestions on maintaining Hong
Kong's stability and prosperity.
</P>
<P>
In Hong Kong, Ann was described as a gifted man of great
attainments in languages, classic Chinese, modern Chinese and
statistics and a man who dabbles in medicine, arts, philosophy,
archaeology, economics, literature and music.
</P>
<P>
Starting in 1979, he spent more than four years writing a five-
volume book on Chinese characters in English, which provides a new
and easy way to foreigners learning Chinese. He published a total
of 21 books on the Chinese language during the 16 years from 1979
to 1995.
</P>
<P>
In his last years, Ann showed great concern about the
reunification of the motherland, and wished to see at an early
date the settlement of the Taiwan issue on the basis of the
principle of "one country, two systems."

<HEADLINE> HK Public Shows Less Concern Over Labor, Economy Problems </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, June 12 (Xinhua) -- Public concerns over labor and
economy related problems have decreased by six percent in the
latest bimonthly opinion survey conducted by the Home Affairs
Bureau (HAB) of Hong Kong, but these two remain the most often
mentioned problems by respondents.
</P>
<P>
Labor-related problems were mentioned by 39 percent of the
respondents. Among this group, 91 percent cited difficulty in
finding jobs, layoffs and underemployment as their main concerns.
</P>
<P>
Economy-related problems, mentioned by 34 percent of the
respondents, ranked the second. Of them, 56 percent were concerned
about the current employment situation or underemployment.
</P>
<P>
The percentage of respondents mentioning environmental
protection related-problems has increased from nine percent in
March to 26 percent in May.
</P>
<P>
A spokesman with HAB said: "While Hong Kong's economy is
recovering well with a GDP growth of 14 percent in the first
quarter, there are certain sectors of the community who have not
yet benefited from the economic recovery such as those who are
unemployed and those with low income."
</P>
<P>
The government has been taking positive steps to help those who
are affected by economic restructuring, and is also determined to
tackle the environmental-related problems, he added.
</P>
<P>
The survey, 88th in a series, was the result of 1,674
interviews conducted over the telephone in May. The interviewees,
aged 15 to 64, were chosen by random sampling through the
residential telephone directories.

<HEADLINE> Likud Watches Syrian Situation Closely: Sharon </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, June 12 (Xinhua) -- The Israeli Likud party is
watching the Syrian situation closely and hoping the new leadership
of Syria would adopt a more flexible policy in striking a peace
deal with Israel, said Likud party leader Ariel Sharon here Monday.
</P>
<P>
"The leadership of Syria is in the process of changes and we
have been watching it closely and we do hope the new leader of
Syria will not follow the hardline policy of former President Hafez
al-Assad because we know Assad very well in the past," Sharon told
a press conference organized by the Association of Foreign Press in
Israel.
</P>
<P>
Sharon made these remarks when asked to comment on the passing
away of Assad and on the ongoing transition of power in Syria.
</P>
<P>
Assad died on Saturday of heart attack and his son Bashar is in
the process of becoming the new president of Syria.
</P>
<P>
Anyway, Sharon said, Israel should wait and see what happens in
Syria before formulating specific policies in solving the
territorial disputes with Syria.
</P>
<P>
But he set "terms" for striking a peace deal with Syria.
</P>
<P>
The "terms" cited by Sharon include that Israel has to stay on
the Golan Heights and must keep Mount Hermon and water resources of
the upper Jordan River to Israel because Israel can not share the
water resources with Syria.
</P>
<P>
All those terms should be the pre-conditions for Israel to
negotiate a settlement of the Golan Heights and force Syria to make
more concessions in negotiations, he said.
</P>
<P>
Sharon criticised Prime Minister Ehud Barak for making too much
promises to Syria while the two countries conducted peace talks,
saying such promises could not serve the interests of Israel.
</P>
<P>
Israel and Syria resumed their peace talks last December, but
halted them after two rounds in the United States, due to Israel's
refusal to hand over to Syria the entire Golan Heights which it
captured in the 1967 Middle East War.
</P>
<P>
Israel completed its troops withdrawal from South Lebanon on May
24 and several days later it also pulled out troops from some
territories on the western foothills of the Mount Hermon.
</P>
<P>
Sharon said the Likud supports private sectors to invest in
Syria, saying economic development in Syria could help it to settle
territorial dispute with Israel.
</P>
<P>
Referring to the Israeli-Palestinian final-status talks, Sharon
said it is hard for the two sides to reach a framework agreement or
a final peace accord in the near future.
</P>
<P>
The fate of Jerusalem, security, right to return for Palestinian
refugees, final borders and water are very complicated issues for
the two sides to settle, he said.
</P>
<P>
The Likud will neither allow Barak to hand over the Jordan River
valley nor the Palestinian villages near Jerusalem to the
Palestinians, he said.
</P>
<P>
The Israel-Palestinian negotiating teams went to the United
States on Sunday and are expected to continue their final-status
talks there from Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Talking about the Barak's coalition crisis, Sharon said Barak is
a good politician but lack of experience.
</P>
<P>
Coalition partners of Shas, National Religious Party and Yisrael
Ba'aliya, joined the opposition on June 7 in the Knesset
(parliament) and voted in favor of a bill asking for dissolving the
Knesset and holding early elections.
</P>
<P>
All the coalition crisis, such as the Shas' demand for more
education allocations, can be solved by certain committees, but
Barak did not pay any attention to them because he only cared about
the peace process, Sharon said.
</P>
<P>
The Likud, as the main opposition party, will do everything
possible to shorten the time of the government, he added.

<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, June 12 (Xinhua) -- Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak will
fly to Damascus later Monday to attend the funeral of his Syrian
counterpart Hafez al-Assad, Egyptian officials said on Monday.
</P>
<P>
Assad died of heart attack at the age of 69 on Saturday. A state
funeral for him is slated for Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Mubarak, who received military training with Assad in the former
Soviet Union in the 1960s, declared three days of official mourning
following the announcement of the Syrian president's death.
</P>
<P>
Mubarak pledged his support to Assad's son and heir apparent
Bashar al-Assad in a telephone call late Sunday, Egypt's Middle
East News Agency reported overnight.
</P>
<P>
Mubarak expressed his condolences over the passing of Assad. He
stressed Egypt's backing to Bashar and Syria, wishing him success
in continuing the march initiated by his late father.
</P>
<P>
The Egyptian president had earlier sent a telegram of support to
Bashar shortly after he was nominated as a candidate for the
presidency by the ruling Baath party and promoted to commander-in-
chief of the armed forces.
</P>
<P>
Mubarak held an emergency cabinet meeting early Sunday to
discuss the situation in Syria after Assad's death. He told
reporters after the meeting that Egypt supports the coming
leadership in Syria.
</P>
<P>
"We respect the Syrian people's way of choosing their president
and wish Syria stability and security because it is a pivotal
country" in the region, he said.

<HEADLINE> Drought, Heat Attack Nature Reserve in Northeast China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARBIN, June 12 (Xinhua) -- Unusual high temperatures and
drought have hit northeast China since late May, causing a
disaster to a nature reserve in Heilongjiang Province.
</P>
<P>
Li Changyou, vice director with the Administration of Zha Lung
Nature Reserve in western Heilongjiang, said that for more than a
month the area had only 3 mm of rainfall, 90 percent less than the
usual amount.
</P>
<P>
The average temperature in May was about three centidegrees
higher than the normal level, he said.
</P>
<P>
As a result, most ponds in the reserve dried up and large
quantities of fish died, with birds there suffering from hunger.
</P>
<P>
Reeds caught fire in an area of 20,000 hectares in the central
part of the reserve due to hot, dry weather, scores of nests and
eggs were destroyed and young birds killed.
</P>
<P>
"Birds are forced to leave, and it is impossible for us to put
out the fire in the swamp, where human beings simply cannot enter
due to the deep, soft mud," said Li. "All we can do is try to
repair the nests and wait for the rainy season to come."
</P>
<P>
According to the provincial meteorological observatory, high
temperatures will continue in the region in June, and the average
will hit 35 centidegrees.
</P>
<P>
The 40,000-ha Zha Lung Nature Reserve, set up for the
protection of red-crowned cranes and other rare birds, is the
largest of its kind in China. About 40 percent of the world's
cranes species and 30 percent of the red-crowned cranes live in
the reserve.

<HEADLINE> Estrada Calls for Unity to Eradicate Poverty </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, June 12 (Xinhua) -- As the Philippines marked the 102nd
anniversary of its independence Monday, President Joseph Estrada
called on the people anew to unite behind him in the fight to
liberate the Philippines from poverty.
</P>
<P>
According to the Presidential Palace, Estrada said at the
Aguinaldo Shrine in Kawit, Cavite province, that while the
Filipino people gained political freedom in 1898, they have yet to
earn their liberation from poverty.
</P>
<P>
"One hundred and two years have passed since General Aguinaldo
declared our independence. But we are not yet truly free. We may
have ended our slavery from colonizers, but we have yet to shake
off the shackles of poverty," he said.
</P>
<P>
The president, in making his call for unity, also reiterated
his commitment not to allow any armed group to threaten the nation
's territorial integrity.
</P>
<P>
Estrada led flag-raising ceremonies nationwide to mark the
102nd anniversary of the Philippines' independence.
</P>
<P>
"We will do everything to protect our territorial integrity. We
will not allow any group to challenge that," said the president at
the flag-raising ceremony in Cavite.
</P>
<P>
He emphasized that "We have only one flag, one constitution,
and one government."
</P>
<P>
This, he said, can never be compromised, and it is his sworn
duty as Commander-in-Chief of the police and military, to protect
national sovereignty "even at the cost of our lives."
</P>
<P>
He said the government will continue to talk peace "but only to
build a just and lasting peace that is founded on sincerity and
mutual trust."
</P>
<P>
The government, he added, shall vigorously pursue socio-
economic development programs in Muslim areas, including the
bailiwicks of the rebel Moro Islamic Liberation Front.

<HEADLINE> Sri Lanka-India Talks Continue </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
COLOMBO, June 12 (Xinhua) -- Indian External Affairs Minister
Jaswant Singh Monday continued his discussions with Sri Lankan
officials on the island's ongoing ethnic conflict.
</P>
<P>
Singh met President Chandrika Kumaratunga Monday morning for a
second round of talks, officials said.
</P>
<P>
He was assisted by Joint Secretary Leela Ponnappa while the Sri
Lankan president was assisted by Foreign Minister Lakshman
Kadirgamar and other senior officials.
</P>
<P>
However, the details of the talks were not immediately known.
</P>
<P>
The state radio said on Monday the talks would focus on the
northern Jaffna peninsula, where the separatist rebels of
Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE) have been engaged in a
ferocious assault to recapture their former stronghold they lost
to government troops in 1996.
</P>
<P>
Singh, who arrived here Sunday afternoon for a two-day visit,
held the first round of talks with Kumaratunga over dinner Sunday
evening.
</P>
<P>
Immediately after his arrival, Singh had an unscheduled 45-
minute meeting with his Sri Lankan counterpart Kadirgamar.
</P>
<P>
It is believed that the situation in Jaffna took high priority
at the talks, although no official comment is available at present
regarding the discussions held so far.
</P>
<P>
Kadirgamar hosted his Indian counterpart for lunch at his
residence on Monday. It is understood that bilateral discussions
had continued over the lunch.
</P>
<P>
India has ruled out its military involvement in the island
nation's civil war which the LTTE rebels have been fighting for a
separate homeland for minority Tamils in the island's north and
east since 1983.
</P>
<P>
However, India has been in close contact with the Sri Lankan
government and promised to broker peace and humanitarian
assistance if asked.
</P>
<P>
Leader of the Sri Lankan opposition Ranil Wickremesinghe called
on Singh at the India House to express his party's stand.
</P>
<P>
Several moderate Tamil parties are also to meet Singh
thereafter.
</P>
<P>
Singh is scheduled to go back to New Delhi Monday evening.
</P>
<P>
Security was tightened for the Indian minister's visit. On
Sunday he was flown by a Sri Lankan air force helicopter to the
India House where he is staying.

PARIS, June 12 (Xinhua) -- French Foreign Minister Hubert
Vedrine said Monday that there is no particular reason to worry
about the future of Syria after the death of President Hafez Assad.
</P>
<P>
In an interview with radio and television Europe 1, Vedrine
said that he does not see any particular threat to the stability
of Syria, although there exist some uncertainties.
</P>
<P>
He said that the change of generation in the leadership of
Syria would also bring about a "change of conception and thinking.
"
</P>
<P>
"Therefore, one can pose questions but there is no reason to
worry," he added.
</P>
<P>
The French foreign minister also said that he expects the
Middle East peace process to continue because President Assad had
agreed to look for a peace settlement with Israel on the condition
that it should be just.

<TEXT>
<P>
HARBIN, June 12 (Xinhua) -- China has got funding from the
Global Environment Found (GEF) for protecting biodiversity on
four of its wetlands.
</P>
<P>
The five-year wetland preservation project will be implemented
jointly by China and the United Nations Development Program (UNDP),
with 14.28 million US dollars from GEF. It is believed that it is
the first time the GEF has funded a wetland preservation project.
In addition to the funding, GEF will also provide some equipment
and materials for the project.
</P>
<P>
The project aims to find out the best ways to preserve
ecological balance on the wetlands, and the experience may later
be extended to other countries.
</P>
<P>
The four wetlands are: the marshes on the Sanjiang Plain in
Heilongjiang Province, northeast China; the beaches in Yancheng of
Jiangsu Province, east China; the marshes in Dongting Lake in
Hunan Province, central China; and highland marshes on the border
between Sichuan and Gansu provinces, northwest China.
</P>
<P>
The wetland, the forest and the ocean, are the three main
ecosystems on earth. Wetlands are home to a great variety of
plants and animals.

<HEADLINE> Lebanon Rejects Larsen's Border Line </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, June 12 (Xinhua) -- Lebanese President Emile Lahoud has
issued a withering attack on the United Nations for its handling of
the process of verifying Israel's troop withdrawal from south
Lebanon, Daily Star newspaper reported Monday.
</P>
<P>
In a memorandum to U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan, Lahoud on
Sunday expressed "surprise" at the fact that U.N. special envoy to
the Middle East Terje Roed-Larsen had insisted on a unique "
withdrawal line" instead of demanding that Israel pull back its
troops behind the internationally-recognized borders under U.N.
resolutions 425 and 426.
</P>
<P>
Lahoud complained that U.N. cartographers had rejected an
existing and recognized border to establish a "fictitious"
withdrawal line to be used as the basis for confirmation of the
Israeli pullout.
</P>
<P>
Lahoud based his complaints on the references to the "
internationally-recognized borders" under U.N. Resolution 425 of
1978 and Annan's May 22 report on the implementation of the
resolution.
</P>
<P>
Annan's report based the line on the Anglo-French border of
1923, later confirmed by the 1949 Armistice Agreement.
</P>
<P>
Lahoud's objections centered on Larsen's apparent decision to
deviate from Annan's instructions and issue what has become known
as "Larsen's line."
</P>
<P>
"Lebanon submitted the 1923 and 1949 documents and all maps
adopted for these borders, which leave no room for doubt regarding
their accuracy and authenticity, while no counter evidence was
submitted," Lahoud said in his five-page memo.
</P>
<P>
He also attacked a U.N. assertion that it was not responsible
for demarcating international boundaries. He said that Larsen's
withdrawal line had left a "dangerous vagueness" over the true
demarcation of the border.
</P>
<P>
The inspection teams moved slowly, covering some 20 kilometers
before ending at Maroun Ras on Sunday evening. The slow progress in
verifying the border has pushed back plans for deploying U.N.
peacekeepers in south Lebanon, vacated by Israeli troops.
</P>
<P>
For fear of escalated Lebanese guerrilla attacks and mounting
casualties, Israel completed its troop withdrawal on May 24, ending
22-year occupation in south Lebanon.

<HEADLINE> Jordanian King Foresees Peaceful Power Transition in Syria </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
AMMAN, June 12 (Xinhua) -- Jordanian King Abdullah Bin Hussein
has predicted a peaceful transition of power in Syria and pledged
his support for Syria after the passing away of President Hafez al-
Assad, one of the longest-serving presidents in the world.
</P>
<P>
According to the official Petra news agency Monday, Abdullah
said in an interview Sunday evening that he had confidence in the
Syrian people's capabilities to surmount the difficulties after the
death of Assad.
</P>
<P>
Assad, who had ruled the country for three decades, died
Saturday of heart attack at age 69.
</P>
<P>
Abdullah spoke highly of Bashar al-Assad, the second and
favorite son of Assad who looked set to take over as the new
president, and described him as a "very smart man, extremely
impressive and well-informed of issues in the region."
</P>
<P>
The Syrian parliament has amended the constitution after Assad
died to lower the minimum age of a presidential candidate from 40
to 34, in an apparent bid to pave the way for Bashar, 35, to
succeed his father.
</P>
<P>
Abdullah said he believed the power transition would be smooth
in Syria as Bashar was in a strong position and enjoyed the
confidence of all important government institutions in the country.
</P>
<P>
The monarch, who had established close personal ties with Bashar
during his visit to Syria earlier this year, said he believed
Bashar stood for peace in the region and was eager to lift the war-
torn Syrian economy out of stagnation.
</P>
<P>
On the Syrian-Israeli peace talks, Abdullah said he believed
Bashar "has a desire for peace and he is ready for it, he has
already started it and I believe he will continue with peace" after
a 40-day period of mourning for Assad in Syria.
</P>
<P>
The Syrian-Israeli peace talks were deadlocked in January after
Israel rejected a Syrian demand to give back in full the strategic
Golan Heights it captured in the 1967 Middle East war.

<HEADLINE> Manila to Exhaust Peaceful Means for Hostages' Release </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, June 12 (Xinhua) -- The Philippine government
reiterated Monday that it will continue to exhaust all peaceful
means to secure the safe release of the 21 mostly foreign hostages
held captive by the Abu Sayyaf on Sulu island.
</P>
<P>
Executive Secretary Ronaldo Zamora said the safety and welfare
of the hostages remains the government's paramount concern,
stressing that what is important is that the talks for their
release are continuing in accordance with the policies set by the
government.
</P>
<P>
"It is not important who the chief negotiator is. What is
important for us is that the negotiations are continuing in
accordance with our policies," Zamora said on radio.
</P>
<P>
Zamora's statement was made in response to the reported demand
of the Abu Sayyaf to replace Secretary Robert Aventajado, the
presidential flagship projects committee chairman, as chief
government negotiator tasked to secure release of the hostages.
</P>
<P>
According to some reports, the Abu Sayyaf group wants Zamora to
take Aventajado's place.
</P>
<P>
The Abu Sayyaf slammed Aventajado for hinting at the
possibility of using military means to solve the hostage crisis if
negotiations fail.
</P>
<P>
Aventajado has been in the negotiating team since mid-May. He
had replaced Nur Misuari, governor of the Autonomous Region for
Muslim Mindanao, upon an earlier demand by the Abu Sayyaf.
</P>
<P>
Press Secretary and Presidential Spokesman Ricardo Puno said
that it is up to President Joseph Estrada to decide on this issue.
</P>
<P>
"What is important is that negotiations continue. We will
remain open, we will keep our lines of communication open," he
said.
</P>
<P>
The Abu Sayyaf, which kidnapped the hostages from the Sipadan
Island resort in Malaysia on April 23, was said to have separated
its captives into two groups for fear of government military
rescue operations.

<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, June 12 (Xinhua) -- The Democratic Republic of the
Congo (DRC) has demanded Rwandan and Ugandan troops to leave the
country and take their senseless war elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
The Times of Zambia newspaper Monday quoted DRC Foreign
Minister Abdoulaye Yerodia as saying in Lusaka at the weekend that
the two troops came to his country together but they are now
fighting each other.
</P>
<P>
He said the clashes between the two former allies in the
mineral-rich town kisangani in northeastern DRC could be over
diamonds.
</P>
<P>
"Maybe it is because they want to plunder the minerals because
Kisangani is full of diamonds," he said.
</P>
<P>
He said all international efforts should be concentrated on
ensuring that the warring troops are withdrawn and not just
separated.
</P>
<P>
"Separating them is not a solution. They should just leave our
country," he said.
</P>
<P>
Both Uganda and Rwanda backed the Rally for Congolese Democracy
(RCD) in fighting to topple the government of DRC President
Laurent Kabila beginning from August, 1998.
</P>
<P>
In May, 1999 the RCD was divided into two rival factions and
the two former allies chose to support different sides and their
forces have clashed frequently since early May this year for the
control of Kisangani, causing heavy casualties.

farmers wishing to settle in the country following what is

</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Desai assured the white commercial farmers in Zambia
that the government will not grab their farms as the country has
plenty of land.
</P>
<P>
He was responding to Zambian white commercial farmers who
wanted to know during the meeting if the government has any
intention of grabbing part of their farmland.

<HEADLINE> Uganda Urges EU to Speed up Fish Census </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KAMPALA, June 12 (Xinhua) -- Uganda has requested the European
Union (EU) to speed up fish census which will help the Ugandan
government make strategies for production conservation, the New
Vision newspaper reported on Monday.
</P>
<P>
The EU is currently carrying out a fish census that will enable
the government to clamp down on overfishing, said Ugandan
Agricultural Minister Kisamba Mugerwa after touring the Fisheries
Resources Research Institute (FIRRI) headquarters in Jinja,
northeast of Kampala.
</P>
<P>
"We need research results that will enable us to reach the
fisher fold," he said, stressing that "research at the ministry is
now a priority."
</P>
<P>
Mugerwa said he is impressed by the high standards of FIRRI's
fish laboratories.
</P>
<P>
According to the minister, his ministry has also been building
local capacity to improve the country's fisheries sector since
early last year when the EU imposed a ban on Ugandan fish.
</P>
<P>
Fisheries in Uganda have acquired the capacity to meet the EU
standards, said FIRRI Director Richard Ogutu Ohwayo.

<HEADLINE> News Analysis: Inter-Korean Summit, A Result of Peace Trend </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PYONGYANG, June 12 (Xinhua) -- The landmark inter-Korean summit
will be held here from Tuesday to Thursday, the first meeting
between leaders of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea (DPRK)
and Republic of Korea in more than 50 years since the Korean
Peninsula was divided at the end of the World War II in 1945.
</P>
<P>
The summit, at which the two sides are expected to discuss
issues of common concerns, is generally believed as a move
reflecting both the historic trend and the popular aspiration.
</P>
<P>
After the Cold War, the surging world trend of peace and
development has brought about a strong impact on the Korean
Peninsula which has remained by and large in a state of cold war
for half a century. Faced with the new trend, the DPRK and South
Korea have been trying for years to explore ways to ease the
tension in their relations.
</P>
<P>
At the beginning of the 1990s, Pyongyang and Seoul signed
several important documents, including an agreement on
reconciliation, non-aggression, and exchange and cooperation, and
the Joint Agreement on the Denuclearization of the Korean
Peninsula. In 1994, the two sides agreed to hold a summit to
alleviate the tension on the peninsula.
</P>
<P>
The DPRK regarded the improvement of inter-Korea relations as a
major prerequisite for realizing peaceful reunification of the
Korean Peninsula and proposed to hold high-level political talks.
</P>
<P>
On the other hand, South Korea focused its policy toward the
DPRK on reconciliation, cooperation and exchange in recent years.
Seoul has been seeking to remove distrust, promote mutual
understanding and pursue "Co-existence and Common Prosperity" with
Pyongyang.
</P>
<P>
In the meantime, the international community has been voicing
its desire to see a relaxation of the tension on the peninsula and
peace and stability there. The realization of the summit,
observers say, is exactly a reflection of the influence of the
trend of peace and stability on the Korean Peninsula.
</P>
<P>
Responding to the world trend, the people of DPRK and South
Korea stepped up their efforts for more exchanges and cooperation
projects, which helped in one way or another facilitate regional
peace.
</P>
<P>
Non-governmental exchanges and economic cooperation between the
two sides have been on the rise since late 1980s. Last year, trade
between the two sides reached 330 million U.S. dollars, up by 50.2
percent over the previous year. About 600 South Korean companies
are now engaged in trading business of more than 500 kinds of
goods with the DPRK.
</P>
<P>
More than 200,000 tourists, mostly from the South, have visited
Mountain Kumgang, about 250 kilometers to the Southeast of
Pyongyang, since a historic tour project started in 1998. The
project, co-sponsored by the DPRK government and South Korea's
Huyndai Corporation, is generally seen as a typical model of non-
governmental cooperation between the two sides.
</P>
<P>
Several large South Korean corporations are now believed to be
ready to expand their cooperation with the DPRK to a wider area,
as observers noted that bosses of four big South Korean
enterprises are to accompany President Jim Dae-jung on his
scheduled trip to Pyongyang.
</P>
<P>
Recent years also saw increased exchanges between the North and
the South in the fields of literature, arts and sports. Artist
groups and dance troupes were swapped and football and basketball
matches held only to highlight the necessity and urgency for more
exchanges.
</P>
<P>
A South Korean parliament member once said after his trip to
Mountain Kumgang that the reunification of the Korean Peninsula
should be based on trust, while trust should start with
understanding, which comes from contacts.
</P>
<P>
The upcoming summit, observers say, is really brought about by
the common aspiration of the people of both the North and South of
the peninsula, who are of the same ethnic group after all.
</P>
<P>
However, as the whole world is closely following the inter-
Korean summit and expects a good result, experts warned that
because the deeply-rooted differences between the two sides are
not likely to be ironed out overnight, it is not realistic to
expect much achievements from a single summit.
</P>
<P>
They said it would be the best result if the summit can become
the first exploratory step, to allow the two Kims to get
acquainted, to lay down some ground rules for future summits and
to establish a modest step-by-step agenda.

<HEADLINE> Yellow River Waterfall Turns Green </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TAIYUAN, June 12 (Xinhua) -- Residents in Jixian County of
north China's Shanxi Province have found that the Hukou Waterfall
on the Yellow River has recently turned clear, something rarely
seen once in a century.
</P>
<P>
Experts attributed the rare phenomenon, which began in mid- to
late May, partly to a long drought this year, as sharply reduced
surface flow brought much less silt into the 5,464 km long river,
China's second largest after the Yangtze.
</P>
<P>
To ease the widespread drought, water from the reservoirs on
the upper reaches has been released at regular intervals to the
lower reaches.
</P>
<P>
The clear and green waterfall will become muddy and brown again
as the rain season comes, experts said.
</P>
<P>
The Hukou Waterfall, about 46 km west of Jixian county seat, is
a well-known tourist attraction in north China.

<TEXT>
<P>

<HEADLINE> China's Financial Industry Continues Smooth Operation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 12 (Xinhua) -- China's financial sector continued
its momentum of smooth operation in the first five months of this
year, with banking loans increasing at a faster step and corporate
deposits registering marked increases.
</P>
<P>
Statistics released today by the People's Bank of China (PBOC),
the country's central bank, shows that by the end of May, the
outstanding amount of loans by all financial institutions stood at
9.6175 trillion yuan (about 1.23 trillion U.S. dollars), up 13.9
percent from the same period last year in constant terms.
</P>
<P>
At the end of May, the outstanding amount of broad money was 12.
4053 trillion yuan, up 12.7 percent from the same period last year
but down one percentage point from the previous month, the growth
decline was caused mainly by the downturn in residents' deposits.
</P>
<P>
According to the statistics, at the end of May the outstanding
amount of residents' deposits was 6.2195 trillion yuan, up 5.5
percent from the same period last year but down 1.6 percentage
points from the previous month, major reasons accounting for the

the stock market and treasury bonds.
</P>
<P>
The outstanding amount of narrow money was 4.649 trillion yuan,
up 22.3 percent from the same period last year and up 0.6
percentage points from the previous month, this rise of growth
speed was mainly contributed by the sharp increase in corporate

deposits was 3.9056 trillion yuan, up 20 percent from the same
period last year and 0.5 percentage points from the previous month.
</P>

</P>
<P>
The archaeologists, led by professor Peng Jinzhang with Wuhan
University, excavated remnants of sutra in minority languages, a
few of which are believed to be the only existing copies in the
world, Wenhui Daily reported today.
</P>
<P>
After searching in 243 caves in the northern part of the famous
grottos, Peng and his colleagues also found lots of Persian coins,
Xixia coins and intact wooden printing types in Uygur, earthenware
articles and textile pieces, the Shanghai-based newspaper said.
</P>
<P>
Also known as Thousand Buddha Caves, the Dunhuang Grottos
boosts a huge reserve of cultural treasures.

The 492 caves in Dunhuang's southern part were regarded as the
world's largest stone cave library for its enormous preservation
of Buddhist frescos, statues and precious sutras.
</P>
<P>
China has listed the excavation of those caves as a priority
project for social scientific research in the next five years.
</P>
<P>
Peng compiled all the latest achievements into a book which
will be published soon, the newspaper said.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 12 (Xinhua) -- Archaeologists recently stumbled
upon five pieces of fossilized human skulls in Tonglu County near
Hangzhou, capital of east China's Zhejiang Province.

<HEADLINE> Major News Items in Leading Israeli Newspapers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, June 12 (Xinhua) -- The following are major news
items in leading Israeli newspapers on Monday.
</P>
<P>
The Jerusalem Post:
</P>
<P>
-- Israel and the Palestinians have reached an understanding
that Israel will free all 1,650 Palestinian security prisoners once
the two sides agree on an outline for a final peace treaty, chief
Palestinian negotiator Saeb Erekat said on Sunday, before leaving
for negotiations set to resume on Tuesday in Washington.
</P>
<P>
Israel has not given the Palestinian National Authority a
definite answer yet, a Palestinian source close to the negotiations
said. "It seems that they do not want to release any more prisoners
until we sign the framework agreement," he added.
</P>
<P>
Ha'aretz:
</P>
<P>
-- Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak sent a message of
reassurance to Syria on Sunday that Israel has no intention of
using the transition period in Damascus to stir up trouble in
Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
Barak also asked their ministers to refrain from commenting
publicly on the transition of power, lest their comments have a
disruptive influence on Damascus.
</P>
<P>
Noting that so far the transition of power is going smoothly in
Syria, Barak said that he and U.S. President Bill Clinton agreed
that it is unlikely that there will be a quick resumption of the
Israeli-Syrian peace negotiations, at least until Bashar al-Assad
has consolidated his power.
</P>
<P>
Ma'ariv:
</P>
<P>
-- Israel's Histadrut labor federation chairman Amir Peretz
called off a general strike slated for Monday after Finance
Minister Avraham Shochat said he would freeze legislation on three
items of the tax reform package and begin talks with the union on
the provisions that it opposes.
</P>
<P>
The three clauses in question are the taxes on interest from
hitherto tax-free supplemental educational funds, tax credits for
night-shift workers, and the half-point tax credit for working
women.
</P>
<P>
Peretz told a 3,000-strong rally he is still suspicious of
Shochat, who acted after intense pressure from Prime Minister Ehud
Barak to avoid the nationwide strike.
</P>
<P>
Yediot Aharonot:
</P>
<P>
-- The Israeli religious ultra-Orthodox Shas party hardened its
position on Sunday in negotiations with Prime Minister Ehud Barak
to resolve the coalition crisis, demanding not only more money for
its school system but more of a say in the peace process and social
issues.
</P>
<P>
Barak was working against the clock to find a coalition solution
without having to dismiss six ministers from the three parties that
voted last Wednesday for a bill to dissolve the Knesset
(Parliament) and hold early elections. The bill passed its
preliminary reading.
</P>
<P>
Based on a clause in the Transition Law, Barak has until Tuesday
night to decide whether to fire the ministers.

<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, June 12 (Xinhua) -- The following are major news items
in leading Turkish newspapers on Monday.
</P>
<P>
Milliyet (National):
</P>
<P>
-- "The political dimension of separatism is gaining momentum
(in the Kurdish-populated southeast), which is as dangerous as the
armed dimension (of the outlawed Kurdistan Workers Party)," said
Prime Minister Bulent Ecevit aboard his plane en route to
Diyarbakir, southeast Turkey, Sunday. He added that he had told the
National Security Council about his views too.
</P>
<P>
Hurriyet (Freedom):
</P>
<P>
-- Prime Minister Bulent Ecevit announced a new economic package
in Diyarbakir, southeast Turkey, Sunday, which includes development
of border trade with Iraq and reduction of the high unemployment
there. He said that last year's government decree, which put limits
on the border trade with Iraq, was not realistic and the government
had overdone the precautions, taken in the context of the border
security.
</P>
<P>
YeniSafak (New Dawn):
</P>
<P>
-- A survey, conducted by the Ankara Chamber of Industry (ASO)
in the public and private sectors, shows that no business is free
of bribery in Turkey.
</P>
<P>
Questionnaires were sent to 971 ASO members, covering aspects
such as transparency in laws and policies, stability and
bureaucratic obstacles and honesty.

<P>
GAZA, June 12 (Xinhua) -- The scheduled Wednesday meeting
between U.S. President Bill Clinton and Chairman of the Palestinian
National Authority Yasser Arafat in Washington has been postponed
to Thursday, a senior Palestinian official said on Monday.
</P>
<P>
According to an advisor to Arafat, the one-day delay is because
that both Arafat and U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright
will attend Tuesday's funeral of the late Syrian President Hafez
al-Assad, who died of heart attack last Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Arafat will meet Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak Monday to
discuss the latest developments of the Middle East peace process,
in the light of Assad's death and the expected resumption of
Israeli-Palestinian peace negotiations in Washington.
</P>
<P>
Following his meeting with Mubarak, Arafat will leave for Syria
to attend Assad's funeral.

<HEADLINE> PNG Not to Interfere in Solomons Affairs: FM </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, June 12 (Xinhua) -- Papua New Guinea's Foreign
Minister John Kaputin issued a statement Monday pledging that his
country would not allow its territory to be used as a base for
hostile attacks against neighboring countries or for interference
in their internal affairs.
</P>
<P>
According to the statement, faxed to the Canberra Branch of
Xinhua from PNG Prime Minister's Office, the foreign minister made
it clear that "the PNG government respects the sovereignty of
other countries, and expects other countries to respect Papua New
Guinea's in return. We will not tolerate illegal activities by
individuals or groups who behave without proper regard for the
mutual respect between states which is the basis of national
security and peace in our region."
</P>
<P>
The foreign minister was commenting on an earlier report saying
that Papua New Guinea's Bougainville Revolutionary Army (BRA) on
Sunday took over the neighboring Solomon Islands' Choiseul and
Gizo islands to protect their allies, the Isatabu Freedom Movement
in the Guadalcanal island, with whom they have bloody ties.
</P>
<P>
The BRA fought a nine-year war to separate the Bougainville
island from PNG until a cease fire in 1998. There is suspicion of
a plan to establish a new race-based country by Bougainville and
some islands from Solomon Islands.
</P>
<P>
The Foreign Minister said after a meeting with Bougainville
People's Congress President Joseph Kabui that "I have been told
that their leaders have said they are strongly opposed to
activities across the common border which might compromise the
sovereignty and security of our good neighbors in Solomon Islands.
"
</P>
<P>
Kaputin directed to investigate the origins of the media
reports, while calling on the media to display care and
responsibility in reporting.

<HEADLINE> Estrada Vows to Make Lasting Peace in Mindanao </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, June 12 (Xinhua) -- Philippine President Joseph Estrada
expressed anew Monday his desire to make just and lasting peace
his administration's legacy to Mindanao, along with prosperity and
development to the once-neglected region.
</P>
<P>
The president said this means extending the hand of friendship
and peace to rebel groups, but also implementing the resolve to
crush any mockery of the peace process.
</P>
<P>
"We are willing to extend our hands in friendship and in peace.
But it must be an honorable and lasting peace. This is the legacy
I want to leave behind when I finish my term (in 2004) so we can
rebuild Mindanao and fulfill its promise," he said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
Estrada stressed that the Armed Forces of the Philippines and
the Philippine National Police share his commitment to work
towards this lasting peace, "at all costs."
</P>
<P>
He added this is the reason he rejected a 40-day ceasefire with
the Moro Islamic Liberation Front (MILF) as proposed by some "well-
meaning citizens," saying that what he wants is not a temporary,
fragile peace but a just and permanent one.
</P>
<P>
Earlier, the president declined to call off military operations
against the MILF, saying his government cannot allow the rebels to
make a mockery of the peace process.
</P>
<P>
He noted these groups continue to attempt to assume control
over certain parts of the country, terrorizing citizens in the
process.
</P>
<P>
"I do not want our people whether in Mindanao or elsewhere in
this country to live in fear. We can no longer allow fear and
violence to prevail," he said.
</P>
<P>
"We will continue to live under one flag, one nation, one
constitution, one government, and one Armed Forces of the
Philippines," he stressed.

<HEADLINE> Sri Lanka Government Maintains Vital Supply Routes to Jaffna </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
COLOMBO, June 12 (Xinhua) -- The Sri Lankan government said
Monday that it is maintaining vital supply routes to the embattled
northern Jaffna peninsula despite reports of supply routes being
disrupted due to Tamil Tiger rebels' fire.
</P>
<P>
"Military equipment and other necessities including food items
are being unloaded at both Kankesanturai (KKS) and Point Pedro
harbors continuously," said a government statement.
</P>
<P>
It said movement of troops and civilians in and out of Jaffna
takes place both by air and sea without any hindrance.
</P>
<P>
The government statement came as the separatist rebels of
Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE) were reported to have
blocked supply routes to the Jaffna peninsula by shelling the air
force base and the sea port in the region.
</P>
<P>
The Sunday Times here reported that LTTE rebels fired on the
air base at Palaly and also rendered the KKS port useless for
government troops.
</P>
<P>
The LTTE rebels, fighting a 17-year war to carve out a separate
homeland for minority Tamils in the island's north and east, have
since April been engaged in a ferocious assault in a bid to
recapture their former stronghold of Jaffna.
</P>
<P>
The paper said that the government stopped flying fixed-wing
aircraft to Palaly. Only helicopters were allowed to fly to the
base, located adjacent to the government's largest military
garrison on the peninsula, according to the paper.
</P>
<P>
The bombardment of the air base and the port posed a serious
problem for the government. The disruption of supply routes might
cause disastrous consequences to government troops who have vowed
to defend Jaffna.

<HEADLINE> Africa to Introduce Continental Parliament </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, June 12 (Xinhua) -- African foreign ministers have
drawn a document aimed at introducing an African parliament to
foster development and unity on the continent, Monday's Times of
Zambia newspaper said.
</P>
<P>
The paper quoted Zambian Foreign Affairs Minister Keli
Walubita as saying that the document would soon be tabled by heads
of state at an extraordinary Organization of African Unity (OAU)
summit in the Togolese capital Lome.
</P>
<P>
The thrust of the just-ended foreign affairs ministers meeting
in Libya's capital Tripoli was to come up with modalities on how
the African parliament should operate, Walubita said in an
interview after he returned from Libya via Japan at the weekend.
</P>
<P>
"There is general consensus that Africa must emerge united and
forge ahead. We reached a compromise after considering documents
presented by Libya and Mali. The heads of state will now consider
what kind of African union to come up with," he said.
</P>
<P>
Many countries feel Africa is too weak to stand the adverse
effects of globalization, he said, noting that the African union
would ensure conflicts become a thing of the past.
</P>
<P>
Parliamentarians of the African parliament would be voted for
either on geographical location, population or proportional
representation, he said.

<HEADLINE> China to Promote Distance Education in Western Regions </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GUIYANG, June 12 (Xinhua) -- China is to spend 360 million yuan
(43 million US dollars) on developing distance education in its
western part, according to an official from the Ministry of
Education.
</P>
<P>
Wang Zhuzhu, deputy director of the ministry's tele-education
office, said the investment constitutes a major move by the state
to develop education in the economically backward western regions.
</P>
<P>
The central government this year has allocated 80 million yuan
(9 million US dollars) from the state revenue to start the program,
and the rest of the investment will be made next year, she said.
</P>
<P>
The program will focus on expanding the existent Chinese
Education and Research Network (CERNET), and help provide access
to the CERNET for colleges and schools in the west, especially
those for students of ethnic minorities.
</P>
<P>
Distance education based on telecommunications and computers is
an ideal solution for China's west, which accounts for more than
half of the country's land area but only 23 percent of the
population, said Zhang Xiaopeng, an associate professor at Fudan
University in Shanghai, who specializes in research in distance
education.

<HEADLINE> Beijing Adopts Strict Control on Water Consumption </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 12 (Xinhua) -- Facing the danger of drought as a
result of rare rains, the Chinese capital Beijing plans to adopt a
series of strict and obligatory measures on water consumption.
</P>
<P>
The measures include introducing a quota system for water usage
in industrial enterprises and in hotels, restaurants, and colleges
and universities.
</P>
<P>
Beijing plans to save 70 million cubic meters of water this
year, 50 percent more than the amount for 1999.
</P>
<P>
While all the industrial enterprises will be subject to an
upper limit in their water consumption, those enterprises which
waste water resources and generate heavy pollution will have to
upgrade their technological level within a limited time period so
as to use water economically or they will be forced out of
production.
</P>
<P>
Stricter control will also be imposed on water consumption in
sectors which consume a large amount of water, such as the car-
washing business and public bathhouses.
</P>
<P>
Statistics show that per capita water resources in Beijing
stands at 300 cubic meters, about one-eighth of the national
average and one-thirtieth of the world's average. The city is now
facing the strike of drought as the arid weather since last year
has resulted in sharp decline in the water level in the city's
reservoirs and in the underground water level.
</P>
<P>
In other water-saving moves, the city also plans to replace the
irrigation system in downtown with a water-saving system and adopt
a quota system in water usage among households on an experimental
basis. Daily water consumption by Beijing residents per capita is
expected to be reduced under 130 liters by the year 2002.

<HEADLINE> Historians From 3 Countries Find New Crimes of Japanese Invaders in Dongning Fortress </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARBIN, June 12 (Xinhua) -- Historians from China, Japan and
Russia have recently found new evidence in the Japanese Dongning
fortress in northeast China's Heilongjiang Province that Japanese
invaders committed "unforgivable crimes" in China during the 1930s
and early 1940s.
</P>
<P>
The Dongning fortification is located at the Sino-Russian
border, covering an area of 93-km wide at the front and 50-km in
length. Some 130,000 Japanese soldiers once stationed there.
</P>
<P>
Jin Weibai and Cheng Penghan from a memorial hall said the
underground tunnels, a Japanese command center, an electricity
generation center and ammunition warehouse were discovered in the
fortress.
</P>
<P>
Military documents were also found, said Makota Kikuchi, a
researcher from a Japanese research institute who specializes in
studying Japanese fortifications in northeast China.
</P>
<P>
The historians chose Dongning because there are still forced
labor and comfort women survivors in the area. Zhu Jinhuan, a
Chinese labor survivor, said Japanese soldiers would put those
Chinese labors who want to escape in sacks and threw them at
hungry, ferocious dogs.
</P>
<P>
Russian experts Ivan Novich and Victor Lovich said "It is
ridiculous that Japanese right-wings activists are trying to deny
that Japan invaded China during this period. All the evidence
suggests the complete opposite."
</P>
<P>
Haruichi Takenouchi, another expert from the Japanese Institute,
said, the findings in the Dongning fortification told us that the
Japanese committed untold atrocities. He promised not to stop his
efforts in exposing that until the Japanese government formally
apologizes to the Chinese people.
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 12 (Xinhua) -- The following is a round-up of
China's archaeology news for the past week:
</P>
<P>
More Fossils of Dinosaur Found in Yuanmou Man's Home
</P>
<P>
Archaeologists recently excavated two more complete sets of
dinosaur skeletons in the county of Yuanmou, the "home" of Yuanmou
Man, in the Yi Autonomous Prefecture of Chuxiong, in southwest
China's Yunnan Province.
</P>
<P>
The excavation began in late April after a villager in the
county discovered a fossil in last November which was later
confirmed as a fossilized dinosaur. Experts believed that the
finding is another major archaeological discovery following the
find of the first Yuanmou Man in 1965 at Shangnabang Village in
Yuanmou County.
</P>
<P>
Experts Reveal Secrets with Long-Existing Wooden Pagoda
</P>
<P>
Some Chinese scientists and architects have concluded after
field study that perfect structural design, geological location,
ideal climate, and use of sustainable timber are factors behind
the nearly 1,000-year-old wooden pagoda in Yingxian county of
Shanxi Province in north China.
</P>
<P>
Standing 65.86 meters, the octagonal pagoda is not only the
tallest but also the oldest wooden pagoda in China today. Compared
with the renowned Leaning Tower of Pisa in Italy, the wooden
pagoda in Yingxian is 115 years older and 11.36 meters taller. The
pagoda was listed as a cultural heritage under first-class State
protection in the 1950s.
</P>
<P>
Syriac Inscriptions Discovered In Mogao Caves
</P>
<P>
Chinese archaeologists have for the first time found Syriac
inscriptions in the famous Mogao Caves of Dunhuang, northwest
China's Gansu Province.
</P>
<P>
They made this discovery when they put in order scriptures
unearthed in the northern zone of the Dunhuang Mogao Caves.
</P>
<P>
The archaeologists launched an excavation in the northern zone
between the 1980s and the 1990s, and discovered 243 more caves
which bring the total number of Mogao caves to 735 from the former
492.

Gold Bars From Han Dynasty Unearthed In Shaanxi
</P>
<P>
A total of 219 gold bars made during the Han Dynasty (206 B.C.-
220 A.D.) have been discovered in the northern suburban of Xi'an,
capital of northwest China's Shaanxi Province.
</P>
<P>
A bulldozer driver unearthed the ingots while working at a
construction site. They were located in two separate containers,
both five meters underground. Each of the bars has a diameter
ranging from 5.6 cm to 6.5 cm and weighs between 250 and 300 grams.
</P>
<P>
Exhibition of Famous Tomb Objects Held in Chengdu
</P>
<P>
An exhibition of burial objects unearthed in the early 1970s
from a 2,000-year-old tomb in Changsha, central China, opened to
visitors today in Chengdu, capital of southwest China's Sichuan
Province.
</P>
<P>
The tomb, at Mawangdui on the outskirts of Changsha city in
Hunan Province, has been identified as belonging to the early
Western Han Dynasty (206 BC-24 AD), and contained the well-
preserved corpse of an elderly woman and more than 3,000 valuable
funerary objects.
</P>
<P>
China's "Marine Silk Road" Starts 200 Years Earlier
</P>
<P>
Chinese archeologists believe Persian-style silver basins,
ivory, glass bowls and crystal-bead strings unearthed from a leud
tomb dating back to the Warring States Period (475 BC-221 BC) in
south China's Guangzhou City, suggested China's marine trade with
the Middle and West Asia began much earlier than that through the
ancient "Land Silk Road".
</P>
<P>
The "imported commodities" came to China in the third century
Before Christ. However, the ancient "Silk Road" that starts from
Xi'an City in western China was explored some 200 years later in
119 BC, said Chinese historians.
</P>
<P>
Large Relics Smuggling Case Uncovered in China
</P>
<P>
Customs officials in the city of Zhangjiagang in east China's
Jiangsu Province recently seized 142 items of relics hidden in 60
pieces of furniture which were bound for the United States.
</P>
<P>
Customs sources said this is the largest relics smuggling case
uncovered in Jiangsu in the past 20 years.
</P>
<P>
The relics include ceramic plates, portraits of Buddha, brush
pots and folding screens.

<HEADLINE> Thai Exporters Fear EU Trade Barriers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, June 12 (Xinhua) -- Thai exporters and officials are
worried that the European Union (EU) could ban the import of Thai
products on health grounds without giving any warning, The Bangkok
Post reported Monday.
</P>
<P>
The Thai government has expressed its concern to the EU, which
sought the reaction of trading partners to its regulations.
</P>
<P>
The EU has become increasingly worried about food safety,
following health scares over dioxin in animal feed. Monitoring
will be carried out by the European Food Authority, which is to be
established soon.
</P>
<P>
A Thai Commerce Ministry official was quoted as saying the main
worry for Thailand was a possible sudden ban on food imports on
health grounds.
</P>
<P>
Thai exporters have hired consultants to study the implications.
A senior executive of Charoen Pokphan Group, Thailand's largest
agro-industry company, was quoted as saying the issue was of more
serious immediate concern to the food industry than the debate
over genetic modification.
</P>
<P>
The EU is the third-largest export market for Thai food,
purchasing products worth 35 billion baht (909 million U.S.
dollars) last year, behind the United States and Japan.
</P>
<P>
The Thai government has hired European consultants to analyze
EU moves on the issue. It has also asked the EU to avoid making
assumptions without scientific support.
</P>
<P>
The EU has also been urged to reconsider its procedures for
tracing food ingredients to their point of origin and delay the
enforcement of practices related to food until they have full
international recognition. Thailand has asked the EU for help in
building laboratories and providing production technology.
</P>
<P>
Thailand disagrees with the EU attempt to link the issue of
environment, human rights and animal welfare with those of
processing and production standards and regulatory procedures,
claiming that this would create a disguised trade barrier,
inconsistent with World Trade Organization agreements.
</P>
<P>
Thailand is worried that the European Food Authority might
become a tool for artificial trade barriers and suggests that the
authority instead help improve food-testing agencies in developing
countries.

<HEADLINE> 10 Killed in Indian Gang Massacre </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, June 12 (Xinhua) -- At least 10 people were killed
and three others injured Sunday night in a massacre in Nawada
district in East India's Bihar state, police said Monday.
</P>
<P>
Police said more than 100 heavily-armed assailants of the
notorious Ashok Mahato gang swooped on Apsad village and gunned
down 10 people when they were in sleep.
</P>
<P>
Three persons, who were injured in the attack, were taken to a
government hospital nearby for treatment.
</P>
<P>
Police said the attackers also slit the victims' throats after
spraying bullets on them. The victims belonged to the upper caste
Bhumihar community, according to the Press Trust of India.
</P>
<P>
The killing is believed to be a retaliatory strike by the gang
to avenge a recent massacre of their supporters in Nawada by the
rival Akhilesh Singh gang.
</P>
<P>
Six persons belonging to the Yadav community were killed last
week at a village in Nawada district.
</P>
<P>
A combing operation has been launched by local police to arrest
the attackers.

<HEADLINE> Japan's Current Account Surplus Surges in April </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TOKYO, June 12 (Xinhua) - Japan's current account surplus in
April rose 40.2 percent from a year earlier to 1,181.4 billion yen
(11.2 billion U.S. dollars), up for the third straight month, the
Finance Ministry said Monday.
</P>
<P>
The upsurge in the current account surplus came as a climb in
exports outweighed an increase in imports, the ministry said in a
preliminary report.
</P>
<P>
Exports grew 8.3 percent to 4,202.9 billion yen (39.8 billion
dollars) while imports went up 8.2 percent to 2,918.7 billion yen
(27.7 billion dollars), both racking up growth for six months in a
row.
</P>
<P>
The surplus in goods and services trade totaled 773.6 billion
yen (7.3 billion dollars), up 41.8 percent.
</P>
<P>
The merchandise trade surplus increased 8.4 percent to 1,284.2
billion yen (12.2 billion dollars), while the services deficit
contracted to 510.6 billion yen (4.8 billion dollars) due to
scaled-back deficits in trade-related services.
</P>
<P>
The yen averaged 105.48 to the dollar in February, compared
with 119.81 a year earlier.
</P>
<P>
The current account balance represents the difference between a
nation's income from foreign sources and foreign obligations
payable, excluding net capital investment.

<HEADLINE> Thailand, South Korea Study Ways to Boost Bilateral Trade </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, June 12 (Xinhua) -- Thailand and South Korea are
studying methods to strengthen bilateral trade, a Thai official
was quoted by Monday's Bangkok Post as saying.
</P>
<P>
"Tariff reductions were being considered," said Vithun
Tulyanond,deputy director-general of the Business Economics
Department.
</P>
<P>
A feasibility study would be completed this year, he added.
</P>
<P>
Trade between the two countries totaled 2.63 billion U.S.
dollars last year.
</P>
<P>
Thai trade with South Korea has plenty of room for growth, the
official said, adding that this would be enhanced by a free-trade
pact.
</P>
<P>
Vithun said South Korea had accepted broad-based negotiations
with Thailand, including trade in farm products, a sensitive issue
for that country.
</P>
<P>
While Thailand hopes to import industrial raw materials from
South Korea at a much lower price than from Japan, South Korea is
encouraging its private sector to compete with Japan in expanding
investment and boosting exports to Thailand and other Asian-
Pacific markets, according to the Thai official.

<HEADLINE> Thailand May Raise Foreign Companies' Registered Capital </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, June 12 (Xinhua) -- At least 5,000 foreign companies
in Thailand may have to increase their registered capital in line
with ministerial regulations that await cabinet approval, The
Bangkok Post reported Monday.
</P>
<P>
Drafted last month, the regulations require companies with more
than a 50-percent foreign stake to submit details to the Commerce
Ministry of their three-year annual investment projections and
operating costs.
</P>
<P>
The minimum capital requirement will be the greater of 25
percent of the average annual figure, or at least 2 million or 3
million baht (51,948 or 77,922 U.S. dollars), depending on the
type of business.
</P>
<P>
Sakol Harnsuthiwarin, deputy director of the Commercial
Registration Department, was quoted as saying that if companies
did not have enough capital, they would need to increase it to the
required level within six months.
</P>
<P>
The department will give about six months for each company to
finish its cost projection.
</P>
<P>
About 5,340 foreign companies already registered in Thailand
are expected to be affected by the new regulation, as well as all
newcomers.
</P>
<P>
New businesses planning to operate in Thailand for more than
three years must bring in 25 percent of their capital within the
first three months and 50 percent by the end of the first year.
They must bring in the balance within the subsequent two years.
</P>
<P>
Companies planning to operate in Thailand for less than three
years must bring in all of their capital within six months.
</P>
<P>
The new regulation will not apply to wholesale or retail
enterprises with capital exceeding 100 million baht (2.59 million
dollars).
</P>
<P>
It will neither apply to construction companies providing
public utilities or transport requiring specialized tools,
machinery, technology or construction expertise as long as they
have a foreign capital of at least 500 million baht (12.98 million
dollars).
</P>
<P>
Peter van Haren, chairman of the Foreign Chamber of Commerce of
Thailand, was quoted as saying that, in general, any form of
minimum investment requirement imposed by countries "dissuades
smaller investors because the costs increase."
</P>
<P>
However, he said a percentage basis was fairer than a fixed
amount, noting that there had not yet been any negative reaction
from the foreign business community.

commitment not to be the first to use even conventional arms in
the region if India agrees to do the same, the local newspaper The
News reported Monday.

organization's conference.

He accused New Delhi of raising a lot of conditions for holding
a dialogue on Kashmir.

<P>
However, he added, "I maintain my position that we need to
initiate a dialogue first of all,then everything else will fall in
line."

<HEADLINE> Pacers Beat Lakers in Game Three of NBA Finals </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LOS ANGELES, June 11 (Xinhua) -- Indiana Pacers point guard
Reggie Miller scored 33 points and Jalen Rose 21 in Game 3 of the
NBA Finals Sunday evening as the Los Angeles Lakers was beaten 100-
91 with second superstar Kobe Bryant sat out following an injured
left ankle two nights earlier.
</P>
<P>
The Pacers also used the notorious "Hack-a-Shaq" strategy in
the fourth quarter, and this time the strategy paid off for the
Pacers as MVP Shaquille O'Neal scored 33 points but made only 3-of-
13 from the free throw line.
</P>
<P>
Even so, the Lakers, who never led, crept within 3 points on a
Ron Harper 3-pointer with 14 seconds to go, following an O'Neal
offensive rebound.
</P>
<P>
"If we were down 3-0 you could have pretty much written us off.
We needed a gutty effort and we got it." said Miller, who made
four free throws in the end of the game.
</P>
<P>
The Lakers not only missed Bryant's scoring in Game 3. He is
also an aggressive force on defense and a good rebounder.
</P>
<P>
Bryant, a second-team All-NBA selection as well as first-team
all-defense pick, was injured while making his only shot of Game 2
on Friday night, a 17-foot jumper with 3:26 left in the first
quarter.
</P>
<P>
The Lakers missed Bryant's offense Sunday evening, getting just
six points from Brian Shaw, his replacement in the starting lineup.
</P>
<P>
Bryant is believed to have two more full days off before Game 4,
to be played Wednesday night, but the Lakers coach Phil Jackson
acknowledged, "Realistically speaking, Kobe won't be 100 percent
for a while." That means he might miss Game 4.

<HEADLINE> NBA Downgrades O'Neal's Flagrant To Personal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LOS ANGELES, June 11 (Xinhua) -- The NBA agreed to the Los
Angeles center Shaquille O'Neal complain and announced Sunday,
hours before Game 3 of the Finals in Indianapolis, that a flagrant
foul called on the MVP in Game 2 of the NBA Finals Friday night
was downgraded to a personal foul.
</P>
<P>
O'Neal had said he did not understand how a wall could be
called a flagrant offender when a sports car runs into it.
</P>
<P>
"When a little guy in a sports car runs into a brick wall they
call a flagrant foul. I never did understand the rule but I guess
I'm big and I can take it," O'Neal said.
</P>
<P>
O'Neal was assessed a flagrant foul for a hard rejection of
point guard Travis Best on a drive with 6:40 to go in the game,
which the Lakers won 111-104 to take a 2-0 lead over the Indiana
Pacers in the best-of-seven series.
</P>
<P>
There was plenty of body contact, but O'Neal also got his hand
on the ball, and the flagrancy of the foul was doubtful,
especially since it was debatable which player initiated contact.
</P>
<P>
The foul was O'Neal's fifth of the game -- one short of fouling
out -- and coach Phil Jackson sat him down for about a minute as
Indiana capitalized by scoring four points on the foul shots and
ball possession that comes with a flagrant foul.
</P>
<P>
Rescinding that flagrant call could be significant should O'
Neal be called for another. A player is automatically suspended
one game after his fourth flagrant foul point. A player gets one
point for a flagrant foul 1 and two points for a flagrant foul 2.
</P>
<P>
The Lakers coach Phil Jackson said the league decision had
removed the possibility that O'Neal "would get an accidental one (
flagrant foul) or something that we consider not aggressive or
nonflagrant in that same situation" and miss a Finals game.

<HEADLINE> Shenzhen Reports High Growth in Stamp Taxes </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHENZHEN, June 12 (Xinhua) -- Shenzhen, one of China's two
stock exchange centers, earned 10.2 billion yuan (about 1.23
billion U.S. dollars) in stamp taxes from securities and stock
trading in the first five months of the year.
</P>
<P>
Information from Shenzhen State Taxation Bureau said the volume
was 388 percent up from the same period last year. The Bureau has
completed levying stamp taxes assigned by the National Taxation
Administration for this year.
</P>
<P>
Stock trading at both the Shenzhen and Shanghai Stock Exchanges
has been increasing since May of 1999.
</P>
<P>
From January to May this year, trading of securities at
Shenzhen Stock Exchange was worth 1,425.1 billion yuan (about 171.
69 billion U.S. dollars), four times the volume for the same
period last year. The Exchange generated 11.132 billion yuan (
about 1.31 billion U.S. dollars) in stamp taxes from transactions
of securities in 1999.
</P>
<P>
Industry expert said that a range of policies implemented makes
it possible for more funds to flow into the stock market,
contributing to the boom at the country's stock exchanges. The
successive lowering of bank interest rates for time deposits, for
instance, has forced many private investors to try their luck on
the stock market.

<HEADLINE> China's Grass Products Industry Has Great Potential </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LANZHOU, June 12 (Xinhua) -- Experts said that China's fledging
grass industry has great scope for potential.
</P>
<P>
They said the demand for grass products on both Chinese and
international markets have been rising rapidly in recent years.
</P>
<P>
Statistics show that China's demand for clover stands at 3
million to 5 million tons annually, and the demand on the
international market is 5 million tons. China's demand for lawn
and grass seeds has increased by 20 percent annually.
</P>
<P>
China is abundant in grass resources and has an over 2,000-year-
old history of planting clover. At present, the country has 300
million hectares of natural pastures and 12 million hectares of
planted pastures.
</P>
<P>
The increasing demand for beef and mutton in China in recent
years is one of the factors that are expected to stimulate China's
grass industry.
</P>
<P>
China's agricultural departments plan to build 24 quality
forage grass production bases throughout the country, and some
local governments have worked out preferential policies
encouraging the development of the industry.
</P>
<P>
A dozen research institutes including Gansu Agricultural
University and the Gansu Grassland Ecological Research Institute
have established a Grass Industry Science and Technology Research
Center.
</P>
<P>
China now has thousands of grass industrial companies. Some of
them have cooperated with foreign counterparts to export products.
</P>
<P>
The World Bank has granted a 10 million yuan (1.2 million U.S.
dollars) loan for Longsheng Grass Industry Co. Ltd in Gansu
Province to develop 6,600 hectares of alfalfa.
</P>
<P>
Statistics show that north China's Shanxi Province alone
exported more than 1,000 tons of grass products to the Republic of
Korea and Japan last year.

<HEADLINE> Southern China Great Wall Discovered </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GUIYANG, June 12 (Xinhua) -- Chinese architect experts have
discovered the ruins of the southern China great wall in Fenghuang
County, central China's Hunan Province.
</P>
<P>
Luo Zhewen, an expert from the State Administration of Cultural
Heritage and vice-chairman of the China Great Wall Society,
confirmed this discovery during an investigation tour in
Fenghuang County on April 20-22.
</P>
<P>
Luo, who has been studying China's Great Wall for more than 50
years, explained that the differences between the great wall and
ordinary city walls are that the great walls stretch for at least
hundreds of miles and have numerous gates, enemy towers, platforms
and other defensive facilities.
</P>
<P>
According to historical records, the Ming Dynasty (1368-1644)
built a 190-km-long side wall between Tongren County of Guizhou
Province and Baojing County of Hunan Province in 1615 to reinforce
its control in the area.
</P>
<P>
Local experts said that the ruins of the side walls and
defensive towers were built in 1797 during the Qing Dynasty (1644-
1911).

<TEXT>
<P>
HOHHOT, June 12 (Xinhua) -- Chinese archaeologists recently
found two ancient epitaphs written in characters created by the
Khitan, a minority living in north China some 1,500 years ago.
</P>
<P>
The epitaphs were discovered in an imperial tomb located in
Bairin Youqi in southeastern part of north China's Inner Mongolia
Autonomous Region.
</P>
<P>
The Khitan characters were created during the Liao Dynasty (916-

<TEXT>
<P>
TIANJIN, June 12 (Xinhua) -- Private community services are
booming in Tianjin, according to a survey by civil affairs
departments.
</P>
<P>
The survey showed that private service companies in some
districts account for two-thirds of the total community service
companies in the port city.
</P>
<P>
Private community service companies offer many services to
local citizens and are more flexible in providing help than state-
owned ones, the survey showed. Their major services include house
calls by doctors, delivering goods and providing cleaning and
domestic services.
</P>
<P>
"We are making efforts to win the trust of residents by
providing high-quality services instead of advertisements," said
Wang Yuxiang, director of a local private service company.
</P>
<P>
Private community services have provided more employment
opportunities for the laid-offs. At the same time, state-owned
service companies are compelled to improve the quality of their
services in the face of stiff competition.

TIANJIN, June 12 (Xinhua) -- China's welfare lottery sales have
been growing rapidly over the past two years, especially in large
cities as an increasing number of Chinese people want to become
millionaires overnight.
</P>
<P>
Statistics showed that 11 billion yuan worth of welfare lottery
was sold across the country from October of 1998 to June last year,
650 times that of 1987 when China first introduced the lottery
system.
</P>
<P>
Lottery has grown into the second largest activity after
tourism that ordinary people would like to spend their spare time
on.
</P>
<P>
Guangzhou, the capital of south China's Guangdong province
reported 2.7 billion yuan of lottery sales in 1999, while in
Tianjin and Shanghai, lottery sales both exceeded 1 billion yuan.
</P>
<P>
"Lottery makes people's life colorful. More importantly, it can
raise money for welfare projects and create jobs for laid-off
workers," said Guan Xinping, a sociology professor from Nankai
University in Tianjin.
</P>
<P>
Since 1987, China has sold 30 billion yuan worth of lottery
raising some 10 billion yuan in welfare capital to improve the
lives of the disabled, the old, and orphans in China.
</P>
<P>
Related government departments are working on lottery market
guidelines and regulations. Those who win lottery prizes will be
paid in cash.

<HEADLINE> Anxiety Haunts Quake Victims in Bengkulu, Indonesia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, June 12 (Xinhua) -- Many residents in the quake-hit
province of Bengkulu, Indonesia, are said to be mentally depressed
as aftershocks continue to rock there, a week after a powerful
earthquake killed about 133 persons and destroyed hundreds of
homes.
</P>
<P>
"Quite strong aftershocks have caused residents to be
traumatized," Bengkulu General Hospital's Zayadi Hussein was
quoted by national newspapers Monday as saying.
</P>
<P>
Hussein said there had been increasing symptoms of clinical
depression among residents. The most evident symptom was that
people were overacting to even the most minor things.
</P>
<P>
He pointed out that people rush out of buildings and into the
street at even the slightest vibration, such the rumble caused by
a passing truck.
</P>
<P>
Hussein also said the paranoia had reached a level where some
people would rush to wake up their neighbors and warn them of an
impending quake, even though the night had been calm.
</P>
<P>
"Another form of depression is that locals prefer to stay in
makeshift tents rather than their houses, even if the weather is
bad," he added.
</P>
<P>
But Bengkulu Psychiatric Hospital Director R. Budi Muljanto
said the depression had not reached a level serious enough to
require special treatment.
</P>
<P>
Seismologist Soehardjono said more than 1,400 aftershocks had
been recorded since the initial earthquake measuring 7.9 on the
Richter scale struck on the night of June 4.
</P>
<P>
The latest big aftershock hit at 06:24 a.m. local time on
Sunday (23:24 GMT Saturday) and had a magnitude 5.4 on the Richter
scale. It was centered beneath the Indian Ocean about 100
kilometers northwest of the badly damaged Bengkulu city, according
to the Meteorological and Geophysical Service.
</P>
<P>
The new tremor frightened residents. However, there were no
immediate reports of new injuries or damage.
</P>
<P>
It was reported that international aid has poured into the
province about 500 kilometers northwest of Jakarta. However, many
residents, who have sheltered beneath makeshift tents, have
criticized the government for reacting too slowly to the disaster.

Chinese writer Qian Zhongshu will be published soon by the Daxiang
Publishing House.
</P>
<P>
"China Depicted In British Literature During The 17th and 18th
Centuries," the doctoral thesis in English, has been rarely

Qian wrote the thesis in English with many French, German and
Latin quotations, when applying for an associate doctorate in the
English Faculty at Oxford University in the late 1930s.

<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, June 12 (Xinhua) -- Papua New Guinea's Bougainville
Revolutionary Army (BRA) got involved in the Solomon Islands'
armed conflict, the Australian Associated Press (AAP) reported
Monday.
</P>
<P>
Citing police in Honiara, the Solomon capital, which fell to a
Malaita Eagle force last Monday, AAP said Choiseul and Gizo
Islands were allegedly taken over Sunday by BRA guerrillas to "
protect" their allies, the Isatabu and Freedom Movement.
</P>
<P>
The report said communications with the two islands have been
shut down by the insurgents, but acting Honiara Police Commander
John Honelo heard from radio that the alleged BRA guerrillas now
control Choiseul and Gizo.
</P>
<P>
The Papua New Guinea-based BRA had fought a nine-year war of
secession with Port Moresby until a cease-fire in 1998.
</P>
<P>
Observers said the BRA was given weapons, medicines and refuge
by their Solomon kinfolk in Western Province, which also is
peopled by settlers from Malaita, according to AAP.

<HEADLINE> China Becomes Kodak's Second Largest Market </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, June 12 (Xinhua) -- China has become the second
largest market for the world's leading film producer, Eastman
Kodak Co., said the company's chief executive officer Daniel A.
Carp in Shanghai.
</P>
<P>
Carp came to China to attend the inauguration of Kodak's two
new plants in Xiamen and Wuxi over the weekend. Together with
these two new plants, Kodak now has 5,000 sales outlets across
China.
</P>
<P>
The new plant in Xiamen, a port city on China's southeastern
coast, has been Kodak's largest investment project in 30 years,
worth one billion U.S. dollars. It is so far the U.S. film company
's largest production center.
</P>
<P>
Kodak has set up plants in China for manufacturing cameras,
film development equipment, digital photography and X-ray films
for medical use.
</P>
<P>
Carp said that Kodak sees China as both a production center and
a booming market.
</P>
<P>
China's film market, which was ranked 17th among Kodak's
markets four years ago, has been growing at an annual rate of 10
percent, said Carp.
</P>
<P>
Carp announced there will be 10,000 sales outlets in China by
2003. He said that the market for film and photography is huge in
China's western region because of its unique landscapes and
scenery.
</P>
<P>
Kodak also wants a slice of China's digital photography market,
encouraged by the soaring demand for digital film in the country.
Last year, the market grew to 80 percent, according to China's
official statistics.
</P>
<P>
Carp said that Kodak is seeking cooperation with local Internet
portals in developing its B to C (Business to Consumer) network to
enable Chinese consumers to purchase Kodak's photograph and film
via the Internet.
</P>
<P>
The per-capita film consumption in China averages one roll a
year, as compared with 3.6 rolls in America. Only 15 percent of
Chinese own cameras.

BRUSSELS, June 11 (Xinhua) -- The Netherlands was awarded a
controversial penalty in the 89th minute to beat the Czech
Republic 1-0 in their opening Euro 2000 group D match in Amsterdam
of the Netherlands on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The Netherlands, co-hosts and tournament favorites, were under
huge pressure in the second half as the Czechs played tough and
aiming to earn a point for their spirited resistance.
</P>
<P>
With just 6 minutes on the regular clock, Ronald de Boer fell
in the area going for a high cross under pressure from Jiri Nemec
and Italian referee Pierluigi Collina pointed to the spot.
</P>
<P>
De Boer's twin brother Frank, the Dutch captain, scored from
the spot to send the Dutch crowd, almost silent throughout the
second period, into raptures.
</P>
<P>
In a frenzied finish Czech anger at the penalty decision led to
a incident on the touchline and Radoslav Latal, substituted in the
69th minute, was shown the red card by Collina.

<P>
"It was a scandal" said Czech coach Jozef chovanec after the
match. "I saw a similar penalty against Turkey earlier today (in
the game against Italy). I don't know what to think I am sad, for
me this is a scandal."
</P>
<P>
The Dutch, playing their first competitive fixture since the
World Cup in France two years ago, dominated the first half with
their classy passing moves.
</P>
<P>
They began the match as if they were playing yet another
friendly in their long build-up to the competition but although
Czech keeper Pavel Srnicek twice made important double saves, the
Dutch never seemed capable of raising their game.
</P>
<P>
The first double-save came after 14 minutes when first Patrick
Kluivert and then Dennis Bergkamp tested him. Three minutes later
Kluivert and Boudewijn Zenden forced him to react swiftly to
prevent a Dutch goal.
</P>
<P>
Bergkamp also went desperately close to marking his 75th
appearance for the Netherlands with a goal but his 19th minute
angled shot went inches wide of the far post.
</P>
<P>
The Czechs, fielding five men who played in the final of Euro'
96 -- Karel Rada, Karel Poborsky, Vladimir Smicer, Nedved and
Nemec played the far more direct football, especially after the
break when Nedved really took control of the midfield.
</P>
<P>
He was unlucky not to score after 58 minutes when he headed
against a post and saw the bounce along the goalline before Van
der Sar safely gathered.
</P>
<P>
Koller, who had scored 13 goals in his first 14 internationals,
also came agonizingly close six minutes later when he powered a
looping header over a stranded Van der Sar, only to see the ball
bounce off the bar.
