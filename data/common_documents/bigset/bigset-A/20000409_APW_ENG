<HEADLINE> Harpist's Music Helps Newborns  </HEADLINE>
By DAVID FREY, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   NASHVILLE, Tenn. (AP) -- Gentle melodies strummed on a 6-foot
tall harp lilt into nurseries where critically ill newborns cling
to life at Vanderbilt University Medical Center.
</P>
<P>
   ''It just puts them in a more restful state,'' says student
musician Betty-Ashton Andrews, who is experimenting with using
music to help the infants. ''It makes it easier for them to grow
and heal.''
</P>
<P>
   There's only budding scientific proof that such therapy helps
newborns, but that doesn't dissuade Andrews, 19, from conducting
her once-weekly concerts at the hospital's newborn intensive care
unit.
</P>
<P>
   Astride the gilded harp on the NICU's tile floor, Andrews coaxes
lullabies, Disney tunes and classical music from its 52 strings,
including requests that range from ''Amazing Grace'' to Lynard
Skynard's ''Freebird.''
</P>
<P>
   Her audience, usually 150 babies, is tucked into incubators and
surrounded by nests of tubes and wires connected to respirators,
heart monitors and intravenous fluids. Nurses and parents say they
note subtle changes in the babies when Andrews plays and most
welcome any balm for a trying time.
</P>
<P>
   Staff members say the music provides an antidote to the stress
that comes with caring for, and sometimes losing, babies who are
premature or fighting diseases.
</P>
<P>
   For the babies, it muffles the frightening sounds of machines
and unusual voices, and soothes them to sleep when their mothers
can't.
</P>
<P>
   NICU manager Diane Deslauriers said the babies' heart rates seem
to go down and they seem to rely less on their respirators when
they hear the harp music.
</P>
<P>
   Christa Tuttle of Gallatin drove 50 miles round-trip each day to
spend about 12 hours in the NICU with her daughter, Caitlin. Born
three months early on Jan. 29, Caitlin relied on a respirator the
first three days to help her breathe.
</P>
<P>
   Tuttle cannot say if Caitlin's health improved because of the
music, but she says she responded to it.
</P>
<P>
   ''Probably the one and only way you can tell is her alertness
and her calmness,'' Tuttle said when Caitlin was still in the NICU.
''She's relaxed and able to look around and listen.''
</P>
<P>
   Caitlin went home on March 19, and ''is doing great. She is
gaining weight much faster than when she was in the hospital. They
say the home environment is best and I see that to be true,'' her
mother said recently.
</P>
<P>
   Vanderbilt has not studied the effect of the music on the
children, but Deslauriers said, ''If I'm carrying a baby and she
calms down, I don't need a research study.''
</P>
<P>
   Jayne Standley, professor of music therapy at Florida State
University, has conducted several studies at Tallahassee Memorial
Hospital's NICU and has found babies who listened to lullabies left
the hospital earlier than those who didn't.
</P>
<P>
   By hooking tape recorders to feeding tubes, researchers also
found they could use lullabies to teach premature babies to nurse.
</P>
<P>
   ''If the baby gets 10 seconds of music and then it goes off,
they learn to suck for at least 10 seconds to keep the music on,''
Standley said.
</P>
<P>
   Standley said research was needed to determine whether harp
music was comforting to premature babies. Even though it is
apparently soothing stimulation, she said premature babies are
highly sensitive and the sounds could be disturbing to them.
</P>
<P>
   At Vanderbilt, most babies dozed peacefully while Andrews
played. Some were doted on by nurses and nervous mothers. Few
showed signs of the restlessness sometimes exhibited by newborns
hospitalized for the first weeks of their lives.
</P>
<P>
   Andrews said she has had only a good response since first
playing the harp for hospitalized newborns at Carilion Health
System in her hometown of Roanoke, Va. Andrews, who is pursuing a
degree in harp performance and considering one in music therapy,
said she chose to attend Vanderbilt in part so she could lend her
music to its NICU.
</P>
<P>
   ''I love to play the harp,'' she said, and ''I get to use it in
a way that other people will benefit from it.''
</P>
<P>
   Ron Price, who teaches harp and music education at Northern
Illinois University in DeKalb, Ill., said many doctors are amazed
at how quickly patients respond to the music.
</P>
<P>
   ''Some will say, 'We don't have anything in medicine that works
that quickly,''' he said.
</P>
<P>
   As executive director and cofounder of Healing Harps, Price
trains harpists to work with people with physical or emotional
problems to soothe their pain.
</P>
<P>
   ''We do this all the time in hospitals across the country,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   The harp's magic is its acoustics, he said. It mimics the sound
of the human voice and affects babies -- and adults -- like a
lullaby.
</P>
<P>
   ''The music simply bathes them with healthy sounds,'' he said.
''It's sort of like a sound massage.''

<HEADLINE> Clinton Lobbbies States on Guns  </HEADLINE>
By SONYA ROSS, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- With his gun bill stuck on Capitol Hill,
President Clinton is taking to the road to encourage a burgeoning
move in the states to deal with firearms safety questions that
Congress has not.
</P>
<P>
   The president scheduled two trips this week to lend support for
state gun legislation. He will be on hand Tuesday in Annapolis,
Md., as Gov. Parris Glendening signs a newly passed bill requiring
ballistics tests and internal safety locks for handguns. On
Wednesday, Clinton will be in Denver to campaign for a Colorado
ballot initiative on sales at gun shows.
</P>
<P>
   The White House said future trips are possible, travel designed
to pry Clinton's gun safety proposal in Congress loose before April
20, the first anniversary of the Columbine High School shootings in
Colorado.
</P>
<P>
   ''The president is going to try to force action here in
Washington,'' said White House legislative adviser Joel Johnson.
''If, inside the Beltway, the special interests have captured the
Congress, the president is going to get outside the Beltway and try
to elicit enthusiasm back in these members' districts.''
</P>
<P>
   This outsider strategy is not new. Clinton employed a similar
tactic in 1997, when his bid for national education testing
standards stalled in Congress. He addressed legislatures in
Maryland, Michigan and North Carolina, but to little avail: Four
states initially responded to Clinton's call for them to adopt the
standards voluntarily, and Congress twice voted down his testing
proposal.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday, the House will be taking up Republican-backed
legislation to create Project Exile, which would send $100 million
in block grants to states that impose mandatory sentences on gun
crimes. A similar program in Richmond, Va., has helped lower gun
crimes by 65 percent since 1997. Richmond's Project Exile is headed
by the U.S. attorney and is a local-state-federal cooperative
program.
</P>
<P>
   Echoing congressional Democrats, Johnson dismissed the House
vote as ''a transparent attempt for some political cover'' on the
gun issue. Republicans said their goal is to force the Clinton
administration to deal with its lax enforcement of existing gun
laws.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is something the Clinton-Gore administration is scared
of, because it's going to make them have to enforce the laws.
They're not going to be able to sit on their hands anymore,'' said
Chris Paulitz, spokesman for the Republican National Committee.
</P>
<P>
   A House-Senate conference committee has been assigned to
reconcile differences between a Senate-passed bill setting a
72-hour background check on sales at gun shows and a House bill
that shrank the wait to 24 hours. The committee has met only once,
in August 1999, which the White House attributes to political
arm-twisting by the National Rifle Association.
</P>
<P>
   Congressional inaction on guns was one of Clinton's complaints
Saturday as he went to the country in his weekly radio address. He
asked Congress to remember that 12 children die every day from
gunfire and said: ''We've waited too long for commonsense gun
safety legislation.''
</P>
<P>
   The NRA says Clinton exploits gun violence for political means,
and it points to his journey to Colorado as evidence.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton is to participate in a rally by SAFE Colorado, a
firearms safety group founded after the Columbine massacre in the
Denver suburb Littleton. SAFE Colorado is pushing a ballot
initiative asking voters to approve a requirement that all gun-show
gun sales be subject to background checks, including those by
unlicensed dealers.
</P>
<P>
   ''Most Americans see it for what it is, and, in the end, have
little appreciation for this blatant politicization of an egregious
tragedy,'' NRA spokesman Bill Powers said. On April 20, 1999, two
Columbine High students killed 12 young people and a teacher, then
themselves.
</P>
<P>
   While pressing Congress to act, Clinton also will pursue other
measures such as potential lawsuits against gun manufacturers and
negotiations that yield safety concessions like those announced
recently by Smith &AMP; Wesson, White House spokesman Joe Lockhart
said.
</P>
<P>
   ''The president believes that there's many ways we can go after
this,'' Lockhart said. ''And he thinks ultimately Congress will
have to move.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton took the step of personally calling Glendening to
congratulate him on Maryland's gun bill, which requires external
trigger locks on new handguns sold in the state, beginning in
October, and built-in safety locks on new handguns sold after 2003.
That same day, Clinton also cheered plans by Massachusetts to ban
cheap ''Saturday night special'' pistols and require all guns sold
in the state to be made childproof.

<HEADLINE> Ling Criticized for 'Old Navy' Ads  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   DURHAM, N.C. (AP) -- Lisa Ling says she didn't do it just for the
money -- cavort in capri pants in Old Navy commercials, that is.
</P>
<P>
   The co-host of the ABC talk show ''The View'' says she took the
job, which offered her creative control, to fight stereotypes.
</P>
<P>
   ''I saw this commercial as empowering and pretty cool because it
shows a minority woman in control and not submissive to a white
man's needs,'' Ling said told students Friday at Duke University.
''It says women can choose capri pants over hot guys if we want
to.''
</P>
<P>
   But Ling, 26, said that is not what many others, especially the
Asian community, thought.
</P>
<P>
   ''The Asian-American community saw it as me being materialistic
and selling out to Old Navy,'' she said. ''I was even getting
blasted in online chat rooms for not having an Asian man in the
commercial.''

<HEADLINE> Pryor Facing More Legal Trouble  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Ailing comedian Richard Pryor faces more
legal complications.
</P>
<P>
   Loud Records of Delaware has asked a Los Angeles Superior Court
judge to determine who owns the rights to master recordings of some
of Pryor's performances.
</P>
<P>
   Loud claims it paid $200,000 for the material in 1998 in an
agreement with a company called Found Money Inc.
</P>
<P>
   Pryor says he owns the masters.
</P>
<P>
   In March, Pryor took out a restraining order against his
38-year-old son, Richard Jr. The move followed a court request by
Pryor's son to become conservator of his father's estate.
</P>
<P>
   The 59-year-old comic is fighting multiple sclerosis, and his
son claims his father cannot care for himself.

   NEW YORK (AP) -- Elton John, Billy Joel and Gladys Knight are

Sting to save rain forests across the globe.
</P>
<P>
   Sting and his wife, Trudie Styler, are supporters of rain forest

</P>
<P>
   ''We want them to legally own the land where they've lived for
thousands of years,'' he told the newspaper. ''Once it's theirs,

<HEADLINE> CIA Fires Official Over Embassy Bomb  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Central Intelligence Agency has fired an
employee whose inaccurate information led to the mistaken bombing
of the Chinese embassy during the NATO war against Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
   ''We did sever ties with one agency employee,'' an intelligence
official said Saturday night, speaking on condition of anonymity.
</P>
<P>
   Six others, including a senior official and four managers,
received administrative punishments that ranged from oral warnings
to letters of reprimand. CIA Director George Tenet singled out for
praise an official who expressed concern about the target early on,
the official said.
</P>
<P>
   CIA spokesman Bill Harlow issued a statement late Saturday
confirming personnel action was taken but refused to make public
details ''for reasons of security and privacy.''
</P>
<P>
   Blame for the ''tragic accident'' was widespread, Harlow said.
''Numerous CIA officers at all levels of responsibility failed to
ensure that the intended bombing target ... had been properly
identified and precisely located before CIA passed a target
nomination package to the U.S. military for action.''
</P>
<P>
   ''While we can never undo the mistakes that led to the bombing,
we are satisfied that the CIA has stood up ... and taken
appropriate responsibility for our mistakes,'' Harlow said.
</P>
<P>
   The CIA actions initially were reported Sunday by The New York
Times and The Washington Post.
</P>
<P>
   U.S.-Chinese ties have been rocky since the inadvertent bombing
last May, which occurred during NATO's 78-day air war. Three
Chinese journalists were killed in the bombing and 20 other Chinese
were wounded. The United States has said the embassy was targeted
because of wrong information, but the intended target was the
headquarters of the Yugoslav Federal Directorate of Supply and
Procurement.
</P>
<P>
   After the bombing, Beijing suspended military contacts and talks
on human rights, arms control, security issues and China's entry to
the World Trade Organization. Chinese government-run media said the
bombing was intentional, and it inflamed violent protests from
stone-throwing mobs at American facilities in China.
</P>
<P>
   Chinese officials had demanded that those responsible for the
bombing be identified and punished.

<HEADLINE> Surprise snow blankets April flowers in NYC  </HEADLINE>
By BETH J. HARPAZ, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- You could almost see the tulips shivering as a
surprise snowstorm blanketed New York City Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Just a day earlier, the sun was shining, flowers bloomed from
every windowbox, and the parks were filled with kids playing the
first Little League and soccer games of spring. The temperature
Saturday reached 71 degrees in Central Park.
</P>
<P>
   But by Sunday morning, the mercury dipped just below freezing
and the air was filled with snowflakes. Although less than a
half-inch accumulated, daffodils sagged under the weight of the
snow, pink cherry blossoms were frosted white and the last ice
skaters of the season looked perfectly at home at the Rockefeller
Center rink.
</P>
<P>
   Barbara Randall of Brooklyn had invited neighbors to join her
and her three children at the beach at Jacob Riis Park in Queens
Sunday for an afternoon of picnicking and ball games.
</P>
<P>
   ''My beach party is not happening because of the weather,'' she
said glumly. ''We were all set to go. We had all our beach stuff
ready and it snowed.''
</P>
<P>
   The lousy weather forced the Mets to postpone their game with
the Los Angeles Dodgers. It was rescheduled for April 24.
</P>
<P>
   The snow tapered off by mid-afternoon, but windy conditions of
up to 45 mph kept the day from turning balmy. Better weather was
expected Monday with sunny skies and temperatures in the 50s.
</P>
<P>
   Blossom-lovers needn't fret too much unless the weather gets
much colder, according to Karl Lauby, spokesman for the New York
Botanical Garden in the Bronx.
</P>
<P>
   ''As long as the temperature doesn't drop below the upper 20s,
this snow and the moisture via the snow is fine for the plants,''
he said. ''Actually when it snows, the flowers may fare better than
if it were a heavy rain, which might pelt the blooms.''
</P>
<P>
   It's peak bloom time for daffodils, magnolias and cherry trees
right now, Lauby said.
</P>
<P>
   Mayor Rudolph Giuliani said the Sanitation Department had sent
out several hundred salting-and-sanding trucks to keep streets from
freezing over. ''This is an unexpected storm,'' he said. ''If you
see a sanitation worker out there, why don't you say thank you?
These are difficult conditions to be working under.''
</P>
<P>
   Newark Airport reported 20-minute delays, LaGuardia had delays
of up to 90 minutes and Kennedy experienced no delays due to the
storm.
</P>
<P>
   Normal local temperatures for this time of year range from from
42 to 59 degrees, according to the National Weather Service.

	   HACKENSACK, N.J. (AP) -- Years of generous deals struck in
closed-door contract negotiations have given almost every
government worker in New Jersey a share of unused sick and vacation
day payouts.
</P>
<P>
   The Record of Hackensack reported in Sunday's editions that an
examination of 50 municipal, county and school audits -- the only
public documents in which the liability is disclosed -- show that
the payouts are now worth more than $1 billion statewide.
</P>
<P>
   The newspaper said Hackensack, which limited the benefit for
employees hired since the 1980s, has paid out almost $1 million in
two years and is still obligated to pay $10.9 million to workers as
they retire.
</P>
<P>
   Lodi has a long-term obligation of $7.9 million, at a cost of
$1,241 per homeowner; and Clifton owes a total of $14 million, at a
cost of $475 per homeowner.
</P>
<P>
   The benefit is almost unheard of in private industry. But local
officials and union representatives defend the payouts as a way to
keep experienced workers and reward people who come to work daily.
</P>
<P>
   ''Do we support this concept? Yes, we do,'' said Karen Joseph, a
spokeswoman for the New Jersey Education Association. She added
that private sector employers offer their workers matching
contributions for 401(k) plans and often have stock options and
other rewards unavailable in the public sector.
</P>
<P>
   Taxpayer advocates and business associations disagree.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's not something that was intended to be a benefit or a
windfall when you retire,'' said Jeff Stoler, a vice president at
the New Jersey Business and Industry Association. ''Companies
provide these days so people can stay home and get well when
they're sick and take a vacation every year and come back to work
refreshed and rested.''
</P>
<P>
   But Hackensack city attorney Richard Salkin said municipal
workers have come to expect the benefit as part of their job.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's a vested right,'' he said. ''We may not like it, but you
can't just take it away from people.''
</P>
<P>
   A report by the State Commission of Investigation, an
independent watchdog agency funded by the state Legislature,
detailed numerous abuses in the way pensions and retirement
benefits are awarded.
</P>
<P>
   The report in particular criticized ''excessive lump-sum
payments'' that often exceed a full year's salary and the practice
of allowing top administrators to keep track of the sick days they
use.
</P>
<P>
   Local officials have said they see no cause for alarm. They
argue that the debt listed is only an estimate of the value of
unused sick and vacation days that employees would be owed if they
all retired at once or if the government went out of business.
</P>
<P>
   But throughout northern New Jersey, payouts are being doled out
at the same time towns struggle to pay for essential services and
equipment without raising taxes.
</P>
<P>
   Pompton Lakes voters a few years ago rejected a $339,000 school
tax increase, prompting a special grant from the Legislature to
save the high school marching band and music classes.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, the borough council refused the fire chief's
requests to replace an aging fire truck -- financed eventually by a
referendum in 1997. Meanwhile, Pompton Lakes officials approved
school and municipal labor contracts that continued to allow for
sick and vacation payouts at retirement. In 1997, that debt totaled
about $1 million.
</P>
<P>
   In her annual address to the state Legislature in 1998, Gov.
Christie Whitman criticized the payouts as ''taxpayer-funded golden
parachutes'' and said they should be limited.
</P>
<P>
   Since then, lawmakers have made several aborted attempts to cap
sick time payouts to local government and school employees at
$15,000, but by the end of the legislative term in January, none of
the bills had even been discussed.
</P>
<P>
   ''As far as I'm concerned, this is a total rape of the
taxpayers,'' said Shirley Feldman, president of the Bergen County
Taxpayers Coalition. ''As long as the taxpayers continue to elect
the same public officials who are in the hip pockets of the unions,
nothing will change.''

<HEADLINE> Extreme wrestling promoters say they will self-regulate  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   NEWARK, N.J. (AP) -- In an effort to forestall a legislative ban
on their ultra-violent sport, promoters of ''extreme wrestling''
said they are washing most of the blood out of their shows.
</P>
<P>
   ''We want to continue doing this, and in order to continue we
need to change,'' Jeff Shapiro, co-owner of Jersey All-Pro, told
The Star-Ledger of Newark in Sunday's editions. ''We don't need the
state to come in and regulate us. We got the message loud and
clear.''
</P>
<P>
   And it was a toned-down show in Bayonne on Friday, although
emcee Fat Frank Iadavaia promised the crowd, ''there will be blood
in Charity Hall tonight.''
</P>
<P>
   There was some blood, but the machetes, cheese graters and
barbed wire were gone.
</P>
<P>
   Gov. Christie Whitman and Bayonne Mayor Joseph Doria, who is
also the minority leader of the Assembly, in March formed a
bipartisan coalition on the entertainment events, which they
denounced as dangerous and too gruesome for children.
</P>
<P>
   It was Whitman who enacted a change in law in 1997 to deregulate
so-called ''pro wrestling'' so that sponsors like the World
Wrestling Federation would be willing to stage TV events at New
Jersey facilities without regulation and taxes from the State
Athletic Control Board.
</P>
<P>
   The WWF has distanced itself from extreme wrestling, lauding the
governor's move to regulate the events and excusing two of its own
wrestlers from an autograph session for Jersey All-Pro next week.
</P>
<P>
   And Lowlife Louis Ramos, the ''Suicidal Title'' holder known for
bringing a machete and a willingness to bleed in the ring, has been
told to tone down his act.
</P>
<P>
   ''I've been blamed for all this,'' he told the newspaper. ''I've
been ostracized in the wrestling community. I've been killed on the
(Internet) message boards. It's like I'm a scapegoat for a lot of
this.''

<HEADLINE> Fraternity house fire victims died of smoke inhalation; two hadbeen drinking  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WILKES-BARRE, Pa. (AP) -- The three Bloomsburg University
students killed in a fraternity house fire last month died of smoke
inhalation, and two of them had been drinking, the county coronor
said.
</P>
<P>
   The victims -- Marcus LaBuda, 22, of Hazleton; Kristoffer
Polhemus, 22, of Hampton, N.J.; and Cliff Vail, 21, of Dunellen,
N.J. -- were likely overcome by carbon monoxide and never awakened,
Columbia County Coroner Dr. Michael Kenny told The Times-Leader of
Wilkes-Barre.
</P>
<P>
   Toxicology tests on LaBuda and Polhemus indicated blood-alcohol
levels of 0.09 percent, less than the 0.10 percent at which the
state considers an adult driver intoxicated, Kenny said. He said he
could not say how that might have affected the victims' ability to
react to the March 19 fire.
</P>
<P>
   Tests on Vail were not available. No drugs were found in the
systems of the other two victims, he said.
</P>
<P>
   The fire at the Tau Kappa Epsilon fraternity house near the
Bloomsburg University campus broke out at 6 a.m., a few hours after
the end of a party attended by about 30 people. Three other
fraternity brothers escaped, two jumping to safety from the
second-floor window of the burning house, which was reduced to
rubble.
</P>
<P>
   The cause of the fire has not been determined, but Bloomsburg
Police Sgt. Joe Wondoloski said findings could be released next
week.
</P>
<P>
   Several hundred tearful students, friends, and family members
attended last month's funerals for the three students, whom
University President Jessica Kozloff called ''three shining stars''
of the university.
</P>
<P>
   The university plans to require at least some students to take
classes on fire prevention, and school and town officials are
looking for other ways to make off-campus housing safer.
</P>
<P>
   Another Bloomsburg fraternity house fire killed five students on
Oct. 21, 1994. A smoldering sofa was blamed for that blaze.
Batteries had been taken out of smoke detectors in the Beta Sigma
Delta house, a common practice during smoky parties.

<HEADLINE> 'American Beauty' Wins Awards  </HEADLINE>
By MATT WOLF, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON (AP) -- ''American Beauty,'' the darling of last month's
Oscars, was the big winner again Sunday at the Orange British
Academy Awards, taking six prizes including best picture.
</P>
<P>
   ''American Beauty'' stars Kevin Spacey and Annette Bening were
named best actor and actress, but the film's Oscar-winning director
Sam Mendes was beaten for the best director award by Spanish
filmmaker Pedro Almodovar for ''All About My Mother.''
</P>
<P>
   Michael Caine was an also-ran for best supporting actor but
collected a lifetime achievement award from the British Academy of
Film and Television Arts.
</P>
<P>
   The awards were called the Orange British Academy Awards because
of sponsorship by a mobile telephone company.
</P>
<P>
   Sunday night's ceremony was a mix of Oscar winners reprising
their triumphs -- ''American Beauty'' cinematographer Conrad L.
Hall, for instance -- and Oscar also-rans such as 27-year-old Jude
Law, who was best supporting actor for ''The Talented Mr. Ripley.''
</P>
<P>
   The supporting actress prize went to Dame Maggie Smith for ''Tea
with Mussolini,'' a film that was entirely overlooked by the
American Academy.
</P>
<P>
   Accepting her prize, Smith thanked veterans co-stars Judi Dench
and Joan Plowright for ''hours of Scrabble and gallons of Frescati
(wine).''
</P>
<P>
   The alcohol theme was picked up by Spacey, who complimented
BAFTA organizers for providing champagne and chocolates for every
guest. ''I've been drinking all night,'' said Spacey, adding that
the occasion was less nerve-wracking than the Oscars.
</P>
<P>
   Mena Suvari, who played the object of Spacey's affection,
accepted the award for Bening, who stayed at home because of her
advanced pregnancy.
</P>
<P>
   ''American Beauty'' had led all comers with 14 BAFTA
nominations, followed by ''The End of the Affair'' and ''The
Talented Mr. Ripley'' with 10 and seven nominations respectively.
</P>
<P>
   Caine drew the evening's greatest ovation when he accepted the
BAFTA Fellowship, as the lifetime achievement award is known.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm getting used to standing ovations; I like it,'' Caine
cracked.
</P>
<P>
   But his speech turned serious when he admitted that recognition
in his home country has been a long time in coming. ''I never
really felt like I belonged in my own country, or my own
profession. It's an honor to be invited in from the cold,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   A second ovation greeted Christiane Kubrick, who accepted a
BAFTA Fellowship for her husband Stanley Kubrick, the reclusive
British-based American director who died last year.
</P>
<P>
   ''I do not know who would be here if Stanley had lived -- to
appear in public was not his best thing,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Almodovar was an enthusiastic winner, also taking honors for
best film not in the English language.
</P>
<P>
   ''Do you want me to have a heart attack?'' Almodovar said after
the second prizes. ''It seems to me I'm having a honeymoon with the
British audience.''
</P>
<P>
   Unlike the Oscars, the BAFTAs include an award for most popular
film, voted by filmgoers. That produced the only award of the night
for ''Notting Hill,'' the biggest-grossing British film of all
time.
</P>
<P>
   The eclectic lineup of presenters included Faye Dunaway, ''Naked
Gun'' star Leslie Nielsen and Dustin Hoffman, who was in fine comic
form.
</P>
<P>
   Recalling his trip in from the airport, Hoffman told the
audience: ''I had a wonderful cab driver and his name is Dave, and
he said to give him a mention ... so cheers, Dave.''

<HEADLINE> Snow, frigid winds trap hikers, cause accidents, power outages  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   FRANKFORD TOWNSHIP, N.J. (AP) -- A spring snowstorm surprised New
Jersey on Sunday, knocking out power to thousands of homes, causing
dozens of fender-benders on icy, snow-covered roads and endangering
campers unprepared for the sudden change of weather.
</P>
<P>
   Four hikers were rescued Sunday morning from the Appalachian
Trail in Stokes State Forest in the highlands of northwestern New
Jersey, where they had taken shelter overnight at an open-air
lean-to at about 1200 feet elevation, according to state Department
of Environmental Protection officials.
</P>
<P>
   ''They got taken by surprise by the storm,'' said DEP
spokeswoman Sharon Southard. ''They probably had incorrect attire
for this weather.''
</P>
<P>
   Temperatures across the Garden State hit the mid-70s Saturday
afternoon, then plunged early Sunday to the low 30s -- with fierce
winds pushing the wind chill to the single digits early in the day.
</P>
<P>
   Two rangers summoned Sunday morning by Boy Scouts to the Brink
Shelter, a camping area on Kittatiny Ridge along the Appalachian
Trail, found about 100 hikers waiting there. They included a group
of 80 teen-agers, young adults and chaperones from the Monmouth
Council of Boy Scouts and another 20 from Plainfield Boy Scout
Troop 235.
</P>
<P>
   Four of the Scouts were believed to have hypothermia, or low
body temperature, Southard said. It was unclear if the four had
stayed in the lean-to overnight or had tents.
</P>
<P>
   Three of the Plainfield Scouts were carried down the mountain to
a waiting ambulance, and one of the Monmouth Scouts was helped down
on foot. All four were treated at the scene by personnel from the
Blue Ridge Rescue Squad.
</P>
<P>
   Their names were not immediately available.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, state forest rangers checked on more than 200 other
campers who were in the park in Sussex County this weekend, she
said.
</P>
<P>
   ''Everybody seems to be all right,'' Southard said.
</P>
<P>
   Northwestern New Jersey was hardest hit by the storm, with High
Point getting 7{ inches of snow by late morning, according to Bob
Stauber, a National Weather Service meteorologist in Mount Laurel.
</P>
<P>
   Some areas barely got a trace of snow -- the Atlantic City
airport received just 0.2 inches and Toms River got 0.5 inches.
Meanwhile, Gloucester and Cumberland counties received 2 inches of
snow, Burlington County got more than 3 inches, Trenton got 4,
Hackettstown in Warren County received 5.5 inches and communities
in Sussex County got 4 inches to 7.5 inches.
</P>
<P>
   ''Last year around this date it snowed also,'' Stauber noted.
''So it's nowhere near a record'' to have snow this far into
spring.
</P>
<P>
   The snow petered out by early afternoon, but the wind didn't. A
high wind advisory for the whole state and a gale warning for the
coast were in effect all day.
</P>
<P>
   Gusts of 39 mph were reported at the airports in Newark and
Teterboro in the afternoon, but by then the sun was out, pushing
the mercury to 40 degrees and melting most of the snow.
</P>
<P>
   State police reported treacherous driving conditions in the
morning, mainly across North Jersey, caused dozens of
fender-benders, but no serious accidents.
</P>
<P>
   However, vehicles sliding into utility poles and trees toppled
by wind gusts tore down power lines, leaving more than 6,500
customers without electricity at some point Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   ''We've had widely scattered outages,'' said GPU Energy
spokesman Ron Morano. ''Many of these outages are due to car-pole
accidents.''
</P>
<P>
   Morano said about 6,000 customers were without power at midday,
in Warren, Sussex and Morris counties in northern New Jersey and
Hunterdon, Ocean and Monmouth counties in central New Jersey.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's not anything where people are going to be out of service
for a long time,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Public Service Electric &AMP; Gas Co. said about 75 customers in
Verona and East and West Orange in Essex County were without
electricity since about 10 a.m. because of a downed power line;
service was expected to be back by early evening. About 500
customers in Willingboro who were without electricity for about
three hours Sunday morning.
</P>
<P>
   The snow caused minor delays early in the day at Newark
International Airport, which received 1 inch of snow, according to
police with the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey. Bridges,
tunnels and trains linking New York and New Jersey were unaffected,
and NJ Transit reported no problems.
</P>
<P>
   The snow did force postponement of Sunday's game between the
Trenton Thunder and the New Haven Ravens.

<HEADLINE> Courts, not sex offenders, new enemy in battle for Megan's Law  </HEADLINE>
By JOHN P. McALPIN, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   TRENTON, N.J. (AP) -- Forget the image of Jesse Timmendequas, the
twice-convicted sex offender living across the street.
</P>
<P>
   For supporters of Megan's Law, the latest bogeymen wear black
robes.
</P>
<P>
   ''When Megan's Law was adopted, I don't think anybody foresaw
what the courts would do to it,'' said Lee Solomon, the Camden
County prosecutor who was a member of the Legislature when the law
was passed.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think it's time to stand up to the courts,'' said
Assemblyman Joel Weingarten, R-Essex, whose bill to post sex
offenders' names on the Internet would likely need a constitutional
amendment before it could become law.
</P>
<P>
   Even Maureen Kanka is pointing a finger at the bench.
</P>
<P>
   ''The problem doesn't lie with the Legislature. It lies with the
judges,'' Megan's mother said. ''We are constantly hampered by the
courts.''
</P>
<P>
   The criticism comes as state lawmakers look to spread the
community notifications allowed by Megan's Law well beyond the
narrow bounds so far set by the courts.
</P>
<P>
   Weingarten's bill passed 55 to 0 in the Assembly, with 17
abstentions. The vote came the same day the Whitman administration
announced it wants a constitutional amendment to allow the state to
post information about sex offenders on the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   Whitman's amendment would allow anyone who has access to the
Internet to see a sex offender's name, address and photo as well as
a description of the crimes committed. Any amendment must be passed
by both houses in the Legislature and then by voters.
</P>
<P>
   Without that amendment, many say Weingarten's bill and any other
measure to broaden Megan's Law would be struck down by the courts.
Others contend any new amendment will still run afoul of the U.S.
Constitution.
</P>
<P>
   Jesse Timmendequas raped and murdered Megan Kanka in July 1994
and is awaiting execution on death row. Residents in their Hamilton
Township neighborhood said his prior sex crimes were unknown to
them.
</P>
<P>
   Megan's Law was ''measured against the U.S. Constitution, then
found deficient,'' said lawyer William H. Buckman. State and
federal judges were balancing ''the rights we all have'' against
the law's intentions and its implications, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ''What concerns me is that they have no concerns whatsoever
about the Constitution, and no concerns about the Constitution that
protects everybody,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Courts must look beyond information about sex offenders and
consider if the Whitman amendment might allow the state to post any
type of record -- criminal, financial or personal -- it keeps,
Buckman said.
</P>
<P>
   ''We could one-day become a high-tech scarlet letter society,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   Lawmakers say they are frustrated by the fact that New Jersey
passed the first Megan's Law but other states seem to be able to do
more, like post names on the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   The reason is the courts that supervise New Jersey have meddled
in the process, Weingarten said.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think we need to move away from an active judiciary and one
that attempts to engage in the legislative process,'' Weingarten
said. He claims the bill can withstand a review by the federal
Supreme Court.
</P>
<P>
   As it stands, the state's Megan's Law groups convicted sex
offenders into three levels based on the perceived danger the felon
presents. For those labeled most at risk of committing another
crime, the law allows prosecutors to provide an offender's name,
address and photo to residents living in a carefully defined area.
All offenders are required to register with police once out of
prison.
</P>
<P>
   But much of how the law works now -- judicial review of the
notification, a scoring system for offenses, -- was ordered not by
the Legislature, but by the courts.
</P>
<P>
   A federal judge in January said New Jersey law enforcement
authorities routinely allowed private information about sex
offenders to become widely public during community notifications.
The judge ordered the state to revise its regulations or shut down
the system. The attorney general then released new guidelines
requiring people who receive notices to promise to keep the
information secret.
</P>
<P>
   On Friday, U.S. District Judge Joseph Irenas again heard
arguments from the state public defender's office that the new
guidelines were faulty.
</P>
<P>
   Irenas issued no ruling, but he praised the attorney general for
his work, calling the new notification guidelines ''a decent, legal
reaction to the decision.''

<HEADLINE> Film Double Killed in Auto Accident  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   QUITO, Ecuador (AP) -- A movie double for Russell Crowe, who is
filming ''Proof of Life'' in Ecuador, was killed Sunday when a
pickup truck carrying members of the production went off a mountain
road and tumbled some 450 feet into a gorge, police said.
</P>
<P>
   Hollywood stuntman Willie Garner, whose age and hometown were
not released, died of apparent multiple fractures and massive
trauma in the accident, which occurred 50 miles west of the
capital, Quito, said police spokesman Patricio Quimzo.
</P>
<P>
   Five members of the production crew also were injured.
</P>
<P>
   ''They were on their way to film a scene on an abandoned road
and the vehicle in which they were riding crashed and fell into a
ravine,'' Quimzo told The Associated Press.
</P>
<P>
   None of the film's principal actors -- Crowe, Meg Ryan, David
Morse and David Caruso -- were riding in the truck.
</P>
<P>
   Authorities were investigating the cause of the accident.
</P>
<P>
   Five Ecuadorean extras and production technicians were being
treated in a hospital in Quito, police said. Their conditions were
not immediately available.
