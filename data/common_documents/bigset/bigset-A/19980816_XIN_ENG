<HEADLINE> Zimbabwe's Tobacco Sector Facing Viability </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, August 15 (Xinhua) -- President of the Zimbabwe
Tobacco Association (ZTA) Richard Tate said viability is the
single most important challenge facing the country's tobacco
producers.
</P>
<P>
In a comment in the Zimbabwe Tobacco monthly publication
released Saturday in Harare, Tate said the association was
visiting all financial institutions, including the reserve bank
to seek relief on loans.
</P>
<P>
"Bankers realize that we are in a hostile environment and they
are asking that farmers recognize the problems will not be of a
short duration," he said.
</P>
<P>
"This hostile environment is affected by high interest rates,
the five percent levy-tax and the falling rate of the Zimbabwean
Dollar, making inputs for next season more expensive," said Tate.
</P>
<P>
Tate, however, urged farmers to appreciate the situation and
find workable solutions.
</P>
<P>
He added that the tobacco growers are facing viability
problems due to a slump in the prices of tobacco this season,
high import duty sur-charges, sales tax and the five percent
levies.
</P>
<P>
The tumble in the Southeast Asian economies leading to delays
and cancellation of tobacco orders had also affected the industry
badly, he said.
</P>
<P>
Tobacco is one of the largest foreign currency earners with
1,700 large scale commercial growers producing 224 million
kilograms from 86,000 hectares of land while 6,000 small growers
produce six million kilograms from 6,000 hectares.

<P>
LAGOS, August 15 (Xinhua) -- The United States embassy and
other U.S. offices in Ghanaian capital Accra have been closed
following a bomb threat, according to a report reaching here
Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The report said the U.S. embassy, the consular section,
information services and the U.S. Agency for International
Development were closed Friday and security around the offices
was strengthened after they received information from Nairobi,
saying that Accra would also be a target of terrorism.
</P>
<P>
All staff were turned away when they reported for work and
embassy officials were quoted as saying that they were taking all
threats seriously.
</P>
<P>
A number of countries have received bomb threats following a
massive bomb blast killing over 240 people and injuring more than
5,000 in Kenyan capital Nairobi on Friday last week, the report
added.
</P>
<P>
U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright is expected to

<HEADLINE> Elephants Vandalize Irrigation Scheme in Zimbabwe </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, August 15 (Xinhua) -- About 30 hectares of the newly
rehabilitated Chikwalakwala irrigation scheme in south Zimbabwe
has been vandalized by elephants, the Zimbabwe News Agency
reported Saturday.
</P>
<P>
In an interview with the agency, district administrator John
Brown Ncube said, "soon after the completion of rehabilitation of
this scheme, we thought that we will help alleviate food
shortages through making people sustain themselves, but all our
efforts have been brought down to nothing and we do not know
where we will get the money from to reconstruct those canals
again."
</P>
<P>
"No cropping is going on at the moment and it is a real sad
state of affairs," he said.
</P>
<P>
The irrigation scheme had produced a good crop last season and
had given high hopes to the communities that if fully utilized,
it would help alleviate food shortages which was crippling the
whole district of more than 120,000 people.
</P>
<P>
For the past weeks, elephants have caused havoc on some
commercial farms in the area raising concern among the villagers
in other irrigation schemes that they might also face the same
fate, he added.

<P>
CAIRO, August 15 (Xinhua) -- The following are economic briefs
from Middle East countries.
</P>
<P>
AMMAN -- The revenue of the Jordan Telecommunication Company
(JTC) this year is expected to reach 189 million Jordan dinars
(267 million U.S. dollars), a 12 percent rise over 1997, the
semi-official Jordan Times reported Saturday.
</P>
<P>
JTC Chairman of Board Ali Shukri said the rise of profits would
be made possible through running new projects that have been
approved recently by the government.
</P>
<P>
The JTC will provide services in the fields of fixed
telephony, GSM mobiles and data communications, Shukri said,
adding that eight new value-added services in other fields will
also help harvest income.
</P>
<P>
RAMALLAH -- The Palestinian National Authority (PNA) has
criticized non-Palestinian banks in the Palestinian self-rule
areas for making investments in other countries, the Arabic daily
Al Hayat reported Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Addressing a workshop here on a development plan of the
Palestinians for the coming three years, a senior official from
the PNA's Planning and International Cooperation said the
non-Palestinian banks have a saving of 2.3 billion dollars, but
they have invested 70 percent of the saving outside the
Palestinian self-rule areas.
</P>
<P>
RIYADH -- It is estimated that Saudi Arabia has lost 48.8
billion Saudi riyals (13 billion dollars) in the oil revenue due
to the slump of world oil prices.
</P>
<P>
The Al Hayat newspaper said the loss of the oil revenue eats
into 29.2 percent of the expected revenue of 166.7 billion riyals
(44.4 billion dollars) based on 14 dollars per barrel of oil.
</P>
<P>
SANAA -- In the Yemeni cities of Sanaa, Hudaida and Taez, 37
plants have been closed and eight others are stumbling as a result
of random measures including liberalization, opening markets,
smuggling and custom rebates, according to the Yemeni Manufacturer
Federation.
</P>
<P>
A federation official told the Al Hayat newspaper that other
enterprises have the same worry after laying off thousands of
workers, threatening the national industry.

<HEADLINE> Earth Crack Creates 4-km-Long Ditch in C. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ADDIS ABABA, August 15 (Xinhua) -- An earth crack occurred
last week at Adami Tulu, some 170 kms south of the Ethiopian
capital Addis Ababa, has created a ditch stretching far more than
four kilometers.
</P>
<P>
The Ethiopian News Agency Saturday quoted Adugna Urgessa,
vice-chairman of the east Shoa District, as saying that the crack
which resulted from the receding earth in)Ynka Cholmo Farmers
Association is five meters wide and 12 meters deep.
</P>
<P>
Adugna said the crack has been gradually stretching southwards
in the direction of Lakes Abiyata and Shala, two of a chain of
lakes located at the Rift Valley.
</P>
<P>
There is fear that the crack might further widen to join the
lakes which could result in flooding, the local official added.
</P>
<P>
The 2,800 kilometer-long Rift Valley is the longest valley in
the world. This huge and dramatic scar on the face of earth
extends from Lebanon through the Red Sea, down the Danakil
Depression and onwards to form the valleys of Ethiopia and Kenya,
before terminating finally in Tanzania and Mozambique.

<HEADLINE> Jordan's Economic Reform Bears Fruits </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
AMMAN, August 15 (Xinhua) -- Jordan's economic reform since
1989 has born fruits by reducing its foreign debts and increasing
the foreign reserves, the Jordanian official news agency PETRA
reported Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Till now, Jordan's foreign debts have declined by a record 24
percent to 6.5 billion U.S. dollars from 8.5 billion U.S. dollars
before the reform was launched in 1989, the agency said.
</P>
<P>
Jordan's economic reform program is co-sponsored by the
International Monetary Fund (IMF) and the World Bank (WB).
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the economic reform has increased Jordan's foreign
currency reserves to 1.6 billion dollars, compared to only 50
million dollars in 1989. The huge amount of foreign reserves have
helped fix the exchange rate between the U.S. dollar and Jordanian
currency dinar.
</P>
<P>
Both the decrease of foreign debts and the increase of foreign
reserves have played an important roles in lowering the inflation
rate and attracting foreign investment and financial aid, Jawad
Hadeed, director-general of Jordan's largest private bank the Arab
Banking Corporation, was quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
And the reform has also helped restore economic balance for the
kingdom and increase the world's trust in Jordan's economy as well
as its potential of growth, Hadeed added.
</P>
<P>
Banking analysts told Xinhua here Saturday that Hadeed's
comments showed that many people from the private sector are
satisfied with the government's economic reform program.
</P>
<P>
Hadeed, whose corporation also opens several banks in European
and Middle East countries, is widely regarded as an important
representative of the kingdom's private sector.
</P>
<P>
Jordan, short of natural resources and without any oil
deposit, introduced the IMF-WB economic reform nine years ago to
better structure its economy.
</P>
<P>
Jordan's economy, which featured burgeoning banking services,
booming tourism, huge remittance by expatriates and robust service
industry before the Gulf crisis in 1990, began to slump after the
crisis due to continued regional instability.

<HEADLINE> Iraq Hopeful of Settling POW Issue With Iran </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BAGHDAD, August 15 (Xinhua) -- As a group of Iranian pilgrims
arriving in Iraq, Iraq said Saturday it expected to settle the
issue of Prisoner of War (POW) with Iran within this year.
</P>
<P>
The Iraqi News Agency quoted charge d'affaires of the Iraqi
Embassy in Tehran Salah al-Samarmad as saying that Iraq and Iran
are now on the way of settling all pending issues, particularly
the issue of POWs.
</P>
<P>
He said all the issues are expected to be settled within the
year, and Iraq was hopeful that its relations with Iran, its
former enemy with which it fought an eight-year-long war from 1980
to 1988, "would take on a new look in the future."
</P>
<P>
The POW issue has been one of the leading obstacles that block
the normalization of ties between Iraq and Iran. The two sides
repatriated around 6,000 POWs in April this year in the largest
swap of POWs since 1991.
</P>
<P>
Iraq's optimism was voiced at a time when a group of about 760
Iranian pilgrims, led by Minister of Culture and Islamic Guidance
Ataollah Mohajerani, crossed the border into Iraq Saturday to
visit holy shrines for Shiite Muslims in southern Iraq.
</P>
<P>
This was the first group of Iranian pilgrims that have entered
Iraq in the past 18 years since the beginning of the Iran-Iraq war
in 1980.
</P>
<P>
The Iranian move is viewed as a new step to further improve the
bilateral relations with Iraq. In the past, Iranian government did
not allow Iranian citizens to go to Iraq to visit the holy
shrines, citing security reasons.
</P>
<P>
Speaking to reporters at the departure ceremony held at a
border point, Mohajerani said the visit was the best way to
enhance cooperation between the two peoples.
</P>
<P>
For his part, Iraq's Minister of Endowment and Religious
Affairs Abdal-Munim Ahmed Salih voiced optimism that the
neighborly Islamic relations between Iraq and Iran could be
improved with the latest visit.

<HEADLINE> Moscow not Allow Chechnya to Join World Community </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, August 15 (Xinhua) -- Russian envoy to the Commonwealth
of Independent States (CIS) Ivan Rybkin on Saturday said that
"Chechnya can join the international community only as a member of
Russian Federation," the Itar-Tass news agency reported.
</P>
<P>
In an interview with the Ekho Moskvy radio station broadcast
live Rybkin said that the recent trip by the Chechen President
Aslan Maskhadov to Turkey and the United States can prove that "no
one needs Chechnya but Russia".
</P>
<P>
On Maskhadov's statement that Turkish and U.S.leading
businesses are ready to facilitate Chechnya's integration into the
world community, Rybkin noted that only those who are against
Russia's guarantees can provide finances for Chechnya's problems.
</P>
<P>
Speaking about the situation in Afghanistan, the envoy said
that Moscow is not indifferent to what is going on in Afghanistan.
</P>
<P>
If the Taliban fighters cross the CIS border, "Russia will
retaliate with all the might it has," said Rybkin. The collective
security treaty does not allow Russia to withdraw its troops.
</P>
<P>
The Russian Foreign Ministry maintains contact with both
conflicting sides in Afghanistan, he said.
</P>
<P>
Rybkin believed that sooner or later the situation in that
region could reach a certain level of stability.
</P>
<P>
The Taliban forces recently launched massive attacks on the
opposition alliance in the northern Afghanistan bordering with
some CIS states, that brought to Russia's great attention.

<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, August 15 (Xinhua) -- Opposition leaders of Sudan began
their meetings here Saturday under the Egyptian host to discuss
ways of ending the 15-year-long civil war in Sudan.
</P>
<P>
The meeting of the board of the Sudanese National Democratic
Alliance (NDA), the umbrella group of opposition factions in the
north and south, was attended by various political, social and
military opposition groups.
</P>
<P>
It was chaired by DNA's leader Mohammed Osman Al-Merghani and
attened by other major opposition figures such as John Garang,
leader of the Sudanese People's Liberation Army (SPLA) and
Al-Sadeq Al-Mahdi, former Sudanese Prime Minister and leader of
the Ummah Party.
</P>
<P>
On Saturday, the participants reviewed the outcome of the talks
held between Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak and the Sudanese
party leaders on efforts to end Sudan civil war and ease
sufferings of residents living in the famine-stricken south.
</P>
<P>
Mubarak, when meeting the rebel leaders in the northern resort
of Alexandria on Wednesday, stressed the necessity of maintaining
Sudan's unity and reinforcing efforts to end decades of fighting
in this neighboring state.
</P>
<P>
DNA spokesman Farouk Abu Isa said that the participants
confirmed their commitment to maintaining Sudan's territorial
integrity.
</P>
<P>
In the coming two days, the opposition leaders will discuss the
political situation in Sudan, the regional and international
stance toward the reconciliation process in Sudan, and compulsory
conscription by the Sudanese government of young Sudanese.
</P>
<P>
The Cairo conference followed the collapse of the peace talks
between Khartoum and the opposition alliance in Ethiopia last week.
</P>
<P>

<HEADLINE> Embezzlement Case Revealed in Iran </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, August 15 (Xinhua) -- The Central Bank of Iran (CBI)
has uncovered an embezzlement case involving 35 billion Iran rials
(11.7 million U.S. dollars) related to the conservative judiciary,
the evening newspaper Tous reported on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The pro-moderate paper quoted a well-informed CBI source as
saying that the CBI has reported its findings to Iranian President
Mohammad Khatami, and the bank and the ministries of economy and
justice would further investigate the case.
</P>
<P>
The report said that in 1995, 20 billion rials (about 6.7
million dollars) were drawn out of a bank account of the Ministry
of Justice and late deposited into four personal accounts of Ali
Razini, head of the Justice Department of Tehran province.
</P>
<P>
Another 15 billion rials (5 million dollars) were withdrawn
from the same account on March 13, 1997 and also put into Razini's
private accounts, it added.
</P>
<P>
The CBI also found that Razini had another bank account with 15
billion rials of interests before July 22, 1998.
</P>
<P>
The newspaper said the ministry's bank account has been under
direct supervision of Iran's judiciary chief Ayatollah Mohammad
Yazdi, who is viewed as a conservative.
</P>
<P>
If proved true, this will be the second serious embezzlement
case in the country, which may trigger another round of political
struggle between the moderates and conservatives.
</P>
<P>
Last month, former Tehran Mayor Gholamhussein Karbaschi, a
staunch supporter of the moderate president, was convicted of
embezzlement and sentenced to five years in imprisonment.
</P>
<P>
The moderates believed that the case was used by the
conservatives with political motivation to weaken the position of
Khatami, who advocates reforms and social freedom.
</P>
<P>
But the conservatives maintained that any one convicted of
crimes should be punished according to laws.

LONDON, August 15 (Xinhua) -- British Prime Minister Tony Blair
Saturday condemned the Northern Ireland bomb attack as "appalling
act of savagery" and vowed to hunt down the bombers.
</P>
<P>
It was reported some 21 people were killed and hundreds of

</P>

Blair, who is spending Summer holiday in France, pledged that

will never be allowed to win.
</P>
<P>
"I can barely express the sense of grief I feel for the victims
of this appalling, evil act of savagery," Blair said.
</P>
<P>
"Our other emotion has got to be, not simply one of outrage at
the evil of it and total determination to bring the perpetrators
of it to justice, but an equal determination that these people
will not win, that they will not destroy the process that we have
built up," he added.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Britain's Queen Elizabeth II was also reported by
BBC television as expressing her shock at the "appalling crime"
and had "heartfelt sympathy" for those affected.

<P>
The four injured miners were rushed to hospital suffering from
extensive burns but their lives were not at risk.

ISLAMABAD, August 16 (Xinhua) -- Afghanistan's Taliban militia
Sunday warned Iran to give up its "interference" in the country,

Rajsanjani, reports reaching here said.
</P>
<P>
"The Islamic Emirate of Afghanistan asks Iran to revise its

<HEADLINE> Georgian Energy Sector to Enjoy Tax Privileges </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, August 16 (Xinhua) -- The Georgian government will
give its alternative energy sector five-year's tax privileges,
with the aim to create a favorable investment climate, the
Interfax news agency reported on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
An appropriate draft law on this had been submitted to the
parliament to be adopted, Georgian Minister of Fuel and Energy
Teimuraz Georgadze said.
</P>
<P>
Softening tax pressure is one aspect of the state policy to
develop the energy sector in Georgia.
</P>
<P>
"Talks are already being held with international lending
organizations on five demonstration projects and plans to build
mini-hydropower plants and wind power plants in the west of
Georgia," the agency quoted Georgadze as saying in the Georgian
capital of Tbilisi.
</P>
<P>
The projects to build solar power plants are particularly
promising, the minister added.
</P>
<P>
He said that almost all mini-hydropower plants are in need of
reconstruction or modernization now.
</P>
<P>
A Japanese company plans to build a 10 magewatt wind power
plant in west Georgia, which is valued at 10 million
U.S. dollars. Japan's Eximbank will provide 60 percent of the fund
for the project. The European Bank for Reconstruction and
Development will provide 30 percent of fund and the rest will be
financed by a Georgian-Japanese company.
</P>
<P>
Georgadze believed that the project will promote the
development of the solar energy in his country.

<P>
ADDIS ABABA, August 16 (Xinhua) -- The Ethio-Djibouti Railways
has celebrated it centennary establishment, the Ethiopian Herald
newspaper reported Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The colorful ceremony was held here Saturday at a time when
Ethiopia has diverted to the port of Djibouti from Assab of
Eritrea as its outlet after border dispute erupted between
Ethiopia and Eritrea on May 26 this year.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the ceremony, Ethiopian Minister of Transport and
Communications Abdulmejid Hussein said that because Ethiopia has
chosen to make its import-export transactions through the port of
Djibouti instead of Assab, the number of customers asking for
railway services has increased ever than before.
</P>
<P>
This shows that the potential of this mode of transportation
is becoming most suitable, he added.
</P>
<P>
Ali Abdela Geydid, General Manager of the Ethio-Djibouti
Railways said on his part that the establishment of the railways
has helped Ethiopia promote its foreign trade by introducing
modern transportation system.
</P>
<P>
Ali Abdo, President of Addis Ababa City Administration, said
at the ceremony that the birth, development and progress of Addis
Ababa, directly or indirectly, has been associated with the

<HEADLINE> Telecommunications Plays Big Role in Fighting Flood </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, August 16 (Xinhua) -- Jiujiang City in east China's
Jiangxi Province has drawn wide attention from both at home and
abroad, because the Yangtze River breached its dike near the city
on August 7.
</P>
<P>
Earlier, secondary dikes at Jiangxinzhou, an island in the
Yangtze and subordinate to Jiujiang, also partially collapsed.
</P>
<P>
However, losses have been minimized because of timely and
strenuous efforts by local people and soldiers, as well as
assistance from telecommunications departments.
</P>
<P>
In Jiangxinzhou, local officials have rented 15 mobile phones
especially for guiding local anti-flood activities. "We cannot
afford to buy mobile phones, but it is worthwhile to rent these,"
said a local official.
</P>
<P>
Only one village on the island was inundated, resulting in the
deaths of two villagers. Other villages remained intact and all
the flood victims were evacuated to safer places.
</P>
<P>
In the effort to plug Jiujiang's dike, modern
telecommunications means played an effective role, officials said.
</P>
<P>
A total of 110 stationary phones, 80 mobile phones and six
mobile satellite telecommunications ground stations were provided
free of charge to assist 40,000 troops and policemen working to
repair the dike.
</P>
<P>
According to official sources, the telecommunications
departments have provided flood-fighters in the three worst-hit
provinces -- Hubei, Hunan and Jiangxi -- with 30 emergency
telecommunications vehicles, 50 mobile satellite
telecommunications ground stations, and large quantities of other
telecommunications equipment.
</P>
<P>
Efforts also have been made to protect major telecommunications
facilities and to open temporary telecommunications services for
flood-fighting departments.
</P>
<P>
In places where flood victims congregated, local
telecommunications departments set up temporary facilities,
including a short free-of-charge service to let victims send
messages to their kin and loved ones.
</P>
<P>
In many flood-devastated areas, telecommunications offices are
often the only operational public services. They have been called
by some people an "indestructible defense line."

<HEADLINE> Li Peng Inspects Flooded Areas in Northeast China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARBIN, August 16 (Xinhua) -- Li Peng, chairman of the Standing
Committee of the Chinese National People's Congress (NPC),
inspected flooded areas in northernmost Heilongjiang Province
Saturday and today.
</P>
<P>
He extended warm regards and paid high tribute to the civilians
and soldiers who are fighting the floods on the Nenjiang and
Songhua rivers, two major rivers in northeast China.
</P>
<P>
So far this summer, the industrial city of Qiqihar has suffered
four floods on the Nenjiang, the most in history, which have
caused huge losses, affected millions of residents, disrupted many
sections of the Binzhou railway and threatened the safety of
Qiqihar and Daqing, where China's largest oil field is located.
</P>
<P>
Flooding of the Nenjiang River is far from over and the
flood-control task remains formidable, said Li, who is also a
member of the Standing Committee of the Political Bureau of the
CPC Central Committee, in addressing the soldiers and civilians on
the forefront of fighting floods.
</P>
<P>
"Continued efforts must be made to counter floods and protect
the safety of the people's lives and property and to protect the
safety of Qiqihar and Daqing," Li said.
</P>
<P>
After leaving Qiqihar, Li rushed to the banks of the Songhua
River in Harbin, the provincial capital. The river's water level
of 119 meters was just four steps away from the top of the
embankment.
</P>
<P>
The water level in Harbin is expected to exceed the record high
of 120.3 meters in 1957, and the city should keep on high alert
and prepare for the worst, Li said.
</P>
<P>
"With the firm leadership of the Party Central Committee, the
support of the Chinese People's Liberation Army (PLA) and the
effort of tens of millions of civilians, we are certain to score
victories in flood control," Li told the local residents.

<HEADLINE> Union Workers Begin Strike Against U S West Inc. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, August 16 (Xinhua) -- About 34,000 union workers
began strike against U S West Inc. early Sunday after negotiations
failed to resolve a contentious contract dispute.
</P>
<P>
Members of Communications Workers of America, including
operators, customer-service representatives and field technicians
in a 14-state region, walked off the job at 12:01 a.m. when their
current three-year contract expired. Picket lines went up
immediately outside U S West offices across the region.
</P>
<P>
The union negotiators did not believe they were making any
progress on the key issues of a controversial performance-pay
plan, mandated overtime and health-care benefits.
</P>
<P>
However the company said, "the union appears to be turning its
back on one of the largest pay-and-benefit offers in the
industry." But it said it was willing to do what it takes to get
an agreement.
</P>
<P>
Company officials dispatched about 15,000 managers across the
region to handle operator assistance tasks and other critical
jobs.
</P>
<P>
It was the first time employees have struck U S West since it
was created in the 1984 breakup of AT&AMP;T.
</P>
<P>
U S West and the union were unable to agree on the company's
plan to base salary increases on job performance. Under the
company's proposal, all workers would receive 100 percent of the
base salary, with the option of earning up to 20 percent more by
meeting targets. But failing to meet the goals would not affect
base pay.
</P>
<P>
Company officials said the plan is necessary to improve
customer service as U S West faces increasing competition. But
union officials said it would be a difficult plan to implement for
repair technicians because many factors are out of their control,
such as weather and equipment problems.
</P>
<P>
Union officials also said the company is forcing many employees
to work 60-hour weeks, but U S West officials insist they have
been hiring new workers for three years to reduce mandatory
overtime.

<HEADLINE> Pak Officials Rush to Afghanistan for Iranian Diplomats </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, August 16 (Xinhua) -- A group of senior Pakistani
diplomats Sunday rushed to Afghanistan to ascertain the
whereabouts of 11 Iranian diplomats who have been missing since
the Taliban captured Mazar-e-Sharif last week.
</P>
<P>
Pakistani ambassador to Afghanistan Aziz Khan and the Director
on Afghanistan Affairs in the Foreign Office, Ayaz Wazir, went to
the Taliban's southern stronghold of Kandahar and held talks with
the militia leadership on the issue, reported the independent News
Network International(NNI).
</P>
<P>
The diplomats made the trip amidst growing tension between
Pakistan and Iran over the disappearance of the Iranian diplomats.
</P>
<P>
Iran has repeatedly requested Pakistan to help ensure the
security of its diplomats, allegedly ransacked by the hardline
Taliban when they captured Mazar-e-Sharif, stronghold of the
opposition northern alliance on August 8.
</P>
<P>
Pakistani ambassador to Iran was summoned to the Iranian
Foreign Ministry last week and was told that the Taliban and
Pakistan should take responsibility for the missing of the
diplomats.
</P>
<P>
Pakistan recognizes the Taliban regime while Iran accepts the
northern alliance government led by former Afghan president
Burhannuddin Rabbani.
</P>
<P>
Pakistan has rejected Iran's accusation saying it cannot be
held responsible. However, it pledged to help track down the
missing Iranians.

ISLAMABAD, August 16 (Xinhua) -- Pakistan's Ministry of Defense

Afghan conflict and expressed its "surprise and anguish" at the
accusation.
</P>
<P>
Terming the accusation as "utterly baseless and mala fide," a

involved directly or indirectly in the on-going conflict in
Afghanistan."

He noted that the Foreign Office had already denied such
allegations vehemently.

Referring to the insinuation that Pakistan's 48th Brigade from
Quetta, capital of Balochistan province, was involved in the
Afghan fighting, the spokesman said, "no such formation even
exists in Quetta."

<HEADLINE> Govt.-Formation Meeting Postponed Again in </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOGADISHU, August 16 (Xinhua) -- The National Coordination
Committee of Somalia Sunday announced the postponement of the
anticipated Baidoa meeting for the formation of a government of
national unity for the third time.
</P>
<P>
According to the secretariat of the committee, the earlier
time set for the convening of the Baidoa meeting which expired
Saturday has been extended for another 135 days, which will fall
on January 1 next year.
</P>
<P>
In a press release by the committee co-chaired by Ali Mahdi
and Hussein Aidid, the delay of the anticipated Baidoa meeting is
motivated by what is called lack of funds and the completion of
Mogadishu 16-district administration.
</P>
<P>
The committee also said that a technical commission is now
formulated for the search of those funds from the Arab League,
Islamic Conference, the Organization of African Unity (OAU) and
the Inter-Governmental Authority for Development.
</P>
<P>
Another commission working on the public awareness program is
also being mobilized throughout the country as they put it.
</P>
<P>
The national coordination committee has also addressed a plea
for help in materializing the Cairo peace deal signed by 28
Somali politicians including Mahdi, Aidid, Osman Ali Atto and
Mohamed Qanyare Afrah in late December last year.
</P>
<P>
The meeting at the new headquarters of the disputed Mogadishu
administration was convened at the absence of Aidid who since
August 5 remains abroad for allegedly improving the external
relations with the Cairo agreement sympathizers.
</P>
<P>
Faction leader Atto, who together with General Mohamed Sheikh
Osman dismissed the administration of Mogadishu by Mahdi and
Aidid, has now declared the Cairo peace deal a total failure now.
</P>
<P>
"The Cairo peace deal is foiled by the continuous presence of
Hussein Aidid's militiamen in Bay and Bakol regions which is
contrary to what was signed in Cairo," said Atto.
</P>
<P>
Speaking to the reporters in Mogadishu Saturday, Atto said
that the hope for a meeting in Baidoa is now dead and the Somalis
in collaboration with the international community are thinking of
holding a national reconciliation conference, but he did not
mention when, where or how.
</P>
<P>
Atto also accused Mahdi and Aidid of hijacking the
administration of Mogadishu, saying that the two have gone far
beyond justice and what they have founded is non-representative.
</P>
<P>
"There are entire clans and sub-clans who are not given their
share in the administration," said Atto.
</P>
<P>
Mogadishu is very calm, but there are speculations that clashes
might occur between Atto's sympathizers and those of Mahdi and
Aidid who are now leading the disputed administration of the
capital.

<P>
At the British Embassy in Lagos, visitors are now subjected to
various security measures before being allowed into its premises
while those who have no genuine business around the embassy are
politely turned back.
</P>
<P>
It was observed that vehicles are not allowed to park close to
the embassies and commercial vehicles are directed to park a few
meters away before depositing their passengers, the paper said.
</P>
<P>
These beefed-up security measures have been taken at the
embassies of west countries in the wake of the bombings which
occurred on August 7 in Kenyan capital Nairobi and Tanzanian
capital Dar es Salaam, killing at least 247 people including 12
American citizens.
</P>
<P>
The local paper quoted a U.S. expert on anti-terrorism as
attributing the delay in apprehending the real culprits to the
porous security of the border in most African countries.
</P>
<P>
"African countries are loose in relation to the porous nature
of their borders", the expert said, adding that the free entry of
persons into these countries is fraught with the danger of
terrorist attacks.
</P>
<P>
In his opinion, the paper said, this is a situation that does
not augur well for the effective monitoring of terrorist attacks
in Africa.

<HEADLINE> Irish PM Convenes Urgent Meeting on Omagh Bombing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, August 16 (Xinhua) -- Irish Prime Minister Bertie Ahern
is to hold an emergency meeting of top government officials later
Sunday to assess the security situation following the huge bomb
blast in Northern Irish town of Omagh.
</P>
<P>
An Irish government spokesman said in Dublin that the meeting
is to focus on Republican factions, which are opposed to Northern
Ireland peace agreement designed to put an end to decades of
sectarian bloodshed in the British province.
</P>
<P>
Latest reports said the bombing has killed at least 28 people
and injured 220 others.
</P>
<P>
Some senior government officials were cutting short their
summer holidays abroad and urgently returned to Dublin for the
meeting.
</P>
<P>
Ahern, in a strong-worded statement issued Saturday night,
condemned the Omagh blast, calling it an "dastardly incident."
</P>
<P>
"We will not be found wanting in ensuring that no organization
in our jurisdiction can continue to defy the will of the Irish
people. Those who seek to do so will be ruthlessly suppressed," he
added.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Ahern' British counterpart Tony Blair, who
interrupted his holiday in France and is flying to the Omagh blast
scene, is due to hold phone talks with Ahern and U.S. President
Bill Clinton to review the situation in Northern Ireland.
</P>
<P>
The Irish police, working closely with British police, have
stepped up their surveillance of known Republican dissidents.

staged in Hong Kong obtained some 60 million HK dollars (7.7
million U.S. dollars) in donations for victims of the severe
floods along the Yangtze River on China's mainland.
</P>
<P>

Ltd. (TVB) and two local charitable organizations, the Tung Wah
Group of Hospitals and the Yan Chai Hospital.
</P>
<P>
By the end of the show at 2:30 Sunday morning, some 30 million
HK dollars (3.8 million U.S. dollars) had been received. Plus the
same amount of donation promised by the Hong Kong Jockey Club, the
total sum added up to some 60 million HK dollars.
</P>
<P>
Before the show began at 8:30 Saturday evening, Tung Chee Hwa,
chief executive of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region
(SAR), called on local residents to offer assistance to the flood
victims on the mainland. He also said he was proud of the
charitable activities of the Hong Kong residents.
</P>
<P>
Local artists as well as artists from the mainland and Taiwan
gave excellent performances at the show and the residents
responded enthusiastically to the appeal for donations.

<P>
LONDON, August 16 (Xinhua) -- British police in Northern
Ireland announced Sunday that they are setting up a special task
force to investigate Saturday's massive car bomb blast in Northern
Irish town of Omagh which claimed 28 innocent lives.
</P>
<P>
Royal Ulster Constabulary (RUC) chief Ronnie Flanagan told BBC
Television that the team would be headed by a deputy assistant
chief constable and it would get extra resources.
</P>
<P>
He stressed the task force would concentrate its investigations
on a dissident Republican guerrilla group known as the Real IRA
(Irish Republican Army) which opposes the Northern Ireland peace
agreement signed in April.
</P>
<P>
"No stone will be left unturned until we bring these people to
justice. It's fair to say our focus at this point in time would be
on those that call themselves the 32-County Sovereignty Movement
and those close to them," he said.
</P>

"They are out to murder people for the sake of murdering
people. That's exactly what they did yesterday," he added.

LONDON, August 16 (Xinhua) -- Two separate arson attacks were
launched against two shops in Belfast, Northern Ireland, following
Saturday's massive car bomb blast in nearby Omagh city, killing 28
people and injuring more than 200 others.
</P>
<P>
A BBC television report said that incendiary devices in a
clothes shop in Belfast's Cormarket area went off in the early
hours of Sunday morning, causing serious damage to the shop in one

The other attack was targeted at a music shop of the Northern
Irish capital at similar time and a British police patrol, rushing
to the scene, managed to put out the fire.
</P>
<P>
British political commentators predict that the Omagh car bomb
explosion is expected to trigger another round of savage attacks

<HEADLINE> Vietnam to Ban Transfer of Outmoded Technology </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HANOI, August 16 (Xinhua) -- Equipment, which does not meet the
Vietnamese standard for labor safety, environment and human health
will not be allowed into the country, Vietnam News Agency reported
Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The Vietnamese government has issued a decree on technology
transfer into Vietnam, the news agency said.
</P>
<P>
According to the decree, those items, which have bad effects on
Vietnamese culture and national security, and do not operate
effectively will be also banned.
</P>
<P>
The decree also stipulates that commitments on technology
transfer must be made in written form which has a legal basis for
the two sides to settle any disputes.
</P>
<P>
The decree strictly regulates tariffs on imported technology
which are based on equipment bidding, and methods of payments.
</P>
<P>
The official news agency said imported equipment and
transferred technology have developed into "a headache" for the
Ministry of Science, Technology and Environment.
</P>
<P>
The ministry said after years of non-selective imports of
production lines and equipment, manufacturing quality, labor
safety and the environment are all starting to feel the impact.
</P>
<P>
according to ministry, manufacturing equipment in Vietnam is
"50-100 years out of date compared with regional countries."
</P>
<P>
The technology of the electronics, automobile, construction and
seafood processing industries is often one or two generations
behind.
</P>
<P>
The situation is worse with electricity, textile, garment,
railway, road and ship building industries.
</P>
<P>
The news agency said half of the nation's imported equipment
came from developing countries, due to lack of capital.
</P>
<P>
Even discarded equipment from developed countries made its way
into Vietnam through loopholes in appraising foreign direct
investment projects.
</P>
<P>
To avoid the risk of lagging too far behind other developing
countries in the region, the ministry said Vietnam should import
equipment and technology from developed countries, and limit
imports of second-hand equipment and outmoded technology from
other developing countries.

<HEADLINE> Kuwait to Turn War-Ruined Island to </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUWAIT CITY, August 16 (Xinhua) -- Failaka, a Kuwaiti island
devastated during the 1990 Gulf War, is expected to become a
tourist resort within years.
</P>
<P>
The Kuwait Municipality had finalized preliminary plans to
develop Failaka, the country's second largest Gulf island, as a
tourist destination, local English daily Arab Times reported
Sunday.
</P>
<P>
According to Waleed Al-Jassim, manager of the master plan, the
island could become an international tourist destination mainly by
offering maritime, cultural and recreational facilities in its
original rustic setting.
</P>
<P>
The plan envisages developing a holiday village on the
southern coast comprising a hotel, chalets, a marina for boats
and camping sites set back from the beach and connected by
footpaths and unpaved tracks.
</P>
<P>
Water sports and boating, beach activities and fishing are
also encouraged. There will be public beaches on the south and
north western coast, while on the island itself facilities will
be built for walking, cycling, golf and a health club.
</P>
<P>
The plan focuses on Failaka's promotion as a cultural and
historical dimension by building two "archaeological parks." One
will encompass the ruins and the Muslim shrine in the center
of the island, and the other will contain the archaeological
site at the south-western corner.
</P>
<P>
The island will also provide community services such as shops,
playground, restaurants and family areas, according to the plan.
</P>
<P>
Since vehicles will be barred from accessing most areas of the
island, pedestrian and cycle paths and possibly some form of
public transportation will instead allow visitors to move across
the island.
</P>
<P>
But parties involved in this project are still divided over
the matter of cross strait transportation, with most of them
prefer to see a bridge to connect the island to the mainland.
</P>
<P>
Failaka, an island at the entrance of the Kuwait Bay adjacent
to Kuwait City, was reduced to ruins during the 1990 Iraqi
invasion of Kuwait.
</P>
<P>
Since the Kuwaiti government decided not to rebuild the island
after the war, there are no civilians residing on it.
</P>
<P>
According to Al-Jassim, the plan has been submitted to the
Ministry of Planning and is subject to the ministry's final
approval.

down in the first six months on imports in the corresponding
period of last year.
</P>
<P>
Imports in Japan, the second largest market for diamonds, also
fell by 38 percent.
</P>
<P>
Local analysts believed that no immediate improvement is
expected in Asia and De Beers is hanging its hat on the U.S.
market. However, the full impact of the Asian economic crisis on
the U.S. market has still to be taken into account.
</P>
<P>
It was reported that U.S. polished diamond imports have
increased and are running at 30 percent ahead of last year, but
the rise has not been strong enough to offset the decline in the
world markets.
</P>
<P>
Beside, a tumble in the U.S. stock market could also increase
the depression in the diamond market.
</P>
<P>
"There is nothing that De Beers can do if that happens," said
a diamond analyst in the company.

<HEADLINE> Iranian Moderates Accused for Revealing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, August 16 (Xinhua) -- The political struggle between
the moderates and the conservatives in Iran is likely to get tense
again as a leading conservative newspaper sharply criticized the
moderates in an embezzlement case Sunday.
</P>
<P>
After the Central Bank of Iran (CBI) revealed an embezzlement
case linking judicial officials, the Tehran Times blasted the
moderate faction for "divulging secret information" about its
rivals to suit its own interests.
</P>
<P>
"Resorting to such kinds of tactics of revealing information
to prevent checking breaches" by former Tehran Mayor
Gholamhussein Karbaschi, who was sentenced to five years in jail
for embezzlement last month,"is in contradiction with Islamic
teachings and belief," the daily said.
</P>
<P>
The CBI governor Mohsen Nourbakhsh, a member of the Party of
Constructive Executives of Iran (well-known as G-6), recently
filed a report to the Iranian President Mohammad Khatami about an
embezzlement of 35 billion rials (about 11.7 million U.S. dollars)
by judicial officials.
</P>
<P>
The report said that the amount of money was drawn out of an
account of the Justice Ministry and was put on personal accounts
of Ali Razini, head of the justice department of Tehran province,
as long-term investment deposits.
</P>
<P>
Razini also opened a personal account which has receive some 15
billion rials (about 5 million dollars) of interests from the
investment deposits, the pro-moderate evening daily Tous reported
on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Tehran Times believed that at a time just before Karbaschi's
appeal to court, Nourbakhsh' move to reveal the case was aimed at
protecting the former Tehran mayor.
</P>
<P>
"Raising such an issue at this crucial time has no other
purpose than to protect Karbaschi and pave the ground for his
acquittal," the daily quoted an unnamed source as saying.
</P>
<P>
Another unnamed source was quoted as rejecting the embezzlement
charge against Razini, stating that Razini opened the account in
his personal capacity with the approval of the supreme leader
Ayatollah Ali Khamenei.
</P>
<P>
"If the money was deposited in the bank as government money, no
interest would have been paid on that," the source said, that was
the reason for Razini to open the account.
</P>
<P>
However, Nourbakhsh believed the transfer of government money
to personal accounts was illegal and asked Khatami to instruct
further investigation into the case.
</P>
<P>
It will be the second embezzlement case linking senior Iranian
officials after Karbaschi's case, which highlighted the factional
struggles between the conservatives and the moderates.
</P>
<P>
The moderates believed that the case of Karbaschi, a close
ally of Khatami, was politically motivated with an aim to weaken
Khatami's government, while the conservatives stressed that any
violator should be punished according to laws.
</P>
<P>
It is believed that the new embezzlement case, if found true,
would trigger another round of confrontation between the two
rival factions.

ISLAMABAD, August 16 (Xinhua) -- Afghanistan's Islamic Taliban
gained a foothold in Badakhshan province, a stronghold of former
Afghan president Burhanuddin Rabbani which is on the border with
Tajikistan, reports reaching here said on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The Islamic militia had won the loyalty of local commanders in
the districts of Ragh, Yaftal-i-Sofla and Sheghnan in the

Rabbani's men were fleeing the areas, the radio said.
</P>
<P>
There was no immediate independent confirmation of the reports
and no comment was available from the opposition side.

<P>
Badakhshan has come under pressure after the Taliban captured

<HEADLINE> Uganda Considers Closing Embassy in DRC </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KAMPALA, August 16 (Xinhua) -- The Ugandan government is
considering closing its embassy in the Democratic Republic of
Congo (DRC) in the wake of a raid by DRC soldiers on Friday.
</P>
<P>
All the embassy staff are likely to be evacuated out of the
war-torn country, a Foreign Ministry source was quoted by
Sunday's Monitor newspaper as saying Saturday.
</P>
<P>
However, Sunday's New Vision, the leading daily in Uganda,
reported that Ugandan diplomats in DRC have fled across the Congo
River to Brazzaville for fear of their lives.
</P>
<P>
Reports said that Ugandan embassy in DRC was attacked by some
government soldiers of DRC who forced their way into the compound
on a pick-up.
</P>
<P>
They looted properties and demanded money when putting a
diplomat at gun point. Uganda issued a protest statement to the
DRC soon after the incident.
</P>
<P>
Since August 2, the Tutsi-led soldiers have been fighting
against President Laurent Kabila. The attack erupted in Kinshasa
and quickly spread to other parts of the sprawling country, the
eastern part in particular.
</P>
<P>
The anti-Kabila forces claimed that they had already taken
one-third of the country and are now closing in on the capital.
</P>
<P>
Kabila accused Rwanda and Uganda of being behind the
rebellion, a charge the two neighbors immediately denied.
</P>
<P>
Now seven countries are evacuating their nationals from DRC.
Britain, France and the United States are sending troops there to
evacuate and protect their nationals.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Villages Now Looking For Accountants Locally </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHENYANG, August 16 (Xinhua) -- In Kaiyuan City in northeast
China's Liaoning Province, village accountants are being hired for
the first time by the local government.
</P>
<P>
The accountants have passed certifying exams and have been
approved by villagers. They will have a say in all of the
village's financial matters like the raising and management of
funds. They report to their superior and are supposed to veto any
illegal financial transactions.
</P>
<P>
In the past, in most villages in China, accountants were hired
and fired by the village committee, a practice that often led to
sloppy financial practices and abuse of power.
</P>
<P>
Thirteen newly-appointed village accountants in Kaiyuan answer
directly to the local government and are expected to act more
independently. What is more important, though, financial affairs
that are handled by the village committee will be scrutinized by
villagers who are guaranteed access to them.

<HEADLINE> Joint Command Set up to Fight Rebels in Sri Lanka </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
COLOMBO, August 16 (Xinhua) -- The Joint Operations Command
(JOC) has been re-established in Sri Lanka for the armed services
and the police to collectively plan and execute counter rebel
operations, the Sunday Times reported.
</P>
<P>
Sri Lankan Army Commander Rohan De.S. Daluwatte has been
appointed as the General Officer Commanding of the unified
military and police apparatus, the report quoted Defense Ministry
sources as saying.
</P>
<P>
The sources said the new command would gradually take up the
functions assigned, preventing any disruption of on-going counter
terrorism activity.
</P>
<P>
The decision to set up the JOC came after the government
examined various proposals for a unified approach to the issue of
countering terrorism. The idea was to utilize the resources of the
security forces to maximum, they said.
</P>
<P>
The JOC was set up for the first time when former president
Junius Richard Jayewardene was in office (1978.2-1989.1). However,
the previous government scrapped the JOC and set up a high-powered
Defense Coordinating Committee in its place in 1993.
</P>
<P>
Sri Lankan government troops have been fighting a war since
1983 against Tamil rebels who are fighting for a separate Tamil
state in the north and east of the island country.

<HEADLINE> Peasants Learn Practical Farming Techniques in Ningxia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
YINCHUAN, August 16 (Xinhua) -- Some 800,000 peasants in
northwest China's Ningxia Hui Autonomous Region have mastered at
least two kinds of practical farming techniques, thanks to a
regional educational campaign.
</P>
<P>
The campaign, launched in September 1990 by the Autonomous
Regional Chinese Communist Party Committee and government, aims to
foster a generation of new farmers who can not only read and
write, but also make money and create better living conditions for
themselves.
</P>
<P>
The hope is that by the year 2,000, more than 400,000
illiterate farmers in the autonomous region between the ages of 15
and 50 will finish their primary education, and that more than 1.1
million young and middle-aged farmers also will be taught at least
two of the practical farming techniques.
</P>
<P>
Since the implementation of the campaign, the illiteracy rate
of the autonomous region's total population dropped from 22
percent in 1990 to 18 percent in 1997, and this rate for young and
middle-aged farmers dropped from 23 percent in 1990 to 9.5 percent
in 1997.

<HEADLINE> South Korea to Set up EPZ in Bangladesh </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, August 16 (Xinhua) -- A South Korean firm will set up a
new export processing zone (EPZ) in Bangladesh's southeastern
seaport city of Chittagong, the South Korean Embassy in Dhaka said
on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
A 20-month survey for acquiring over 1,000 hectares of land for
the EPZ, the biggest to be set up by South Korea in this South
Asian country, has been completed under an agreement signed
between the two sides in December 1996.
</P>
<P>
The formal earth-breaking for the large private EPZ, which is
to be owned by South Korea's Yong Wang Corporation, is expected to
take place in November or December this year.
</P>
<P>
The South Korean firm has drawn up a plan to develop the
tree-covered and pond-dotted area, keeping natural beauty spots of
the area intact.
</P>
<P>
Besides the plot for manufacturing units, the
200-million-U.S.-dollar project will also include a small
airstrip, a recreational park, facilities for supply of safe
drinking water, a full-fledged hospital, a community center, a
golf course and an educational center. A satellite town will be
also be developed.
</P>
<P>
About 1,000 industrial and manufacturing units would be
accommodated in the zone in an orderly fashion.
</P>
<P>
The units to be set up in the zone will create over 100,000
jobs, and the investment in the form of units and factories will
be over one billion U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
The Bangladeshi government will ensure electricity, gas supply,
telephone and other infrastructure facilities for the EPZ in
accordance with the agreement.

<HEADLINE> Bangladesh's Bank in Trouble in Overdue Loans </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, August 16 (Xinhua) -- The Bangladesh Krishi
(agriculture) Bank (BKB) has an overdue loan of 17.74 billion taka
(377 million U.S. dollars), which is 51 percent of the total
amount of loans it had disbursed, the Financial Express newspaper
reported on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
BKB's outstanding loans stood at 34.49 billion taka (734
million dollars) as of June 30, 1998, official sources were quoted
as saying.
</P>
<P>
On the other hand, the bank's borrowings from Bangladesh Bank,
the country's central bank, and different foreign agencies were
23.90 billion taka (509 million dollars) and 1.82 billion taka
(387 million dollars) respectively. The bank also owed 184.5
million taka (3.93 million dollars) to the government.
</P>
<P>
The heavy losses incurred by BKB over the years were attributed
to lack of accountability, trade union militancy, weak management
and corruption by the officials and use of the bank for political
purposes by the government, they said.
</P>
<P>
Inadequate and faulty evaluation of projects during the
sanction of loans had been continuing as usual, throwing the
financial institution into dire straits, they added.
</P>
<P>
BKB incurred losses of 768 million taka (16.3 million dollars),
746 million taka (15.9 million dollars) and 1.1 billion taka (23.4
million dollars) respectively in the 1995-96, 1996-97 and 1997-98
fiscal years.
</P>
<P>
BKB has branches in the country's 49 districts, and 44 of them
have incurred losses, with only five earning marginal profits.
</P>
<P>
At present, the bank has only 1.8 billion (38.3 million
dollars) of running capital against the requirement of 3.5 billion
taka (74.5 million dollars), according to the central bank's
latest report.
</P>
<P>
The bank recovered 8.81 billion taka (187.4 million dollars)
against the target of 11 billion taka (234 million dollars) during
the July 1997-June 1998 fiscal year, while the amount of its
disbursement was 8.49 billion taka (180.6 million dollars) against
the target of 10 billion taka (212.8 million dollars).
</P>
<P>
To resolve the issue of BKB's poor performance, Finance
Minister A.S.M. Kabria recently asked the bank to get rid of trade
union activities and implement reform programs to enhance its
efficiency and remove irregularities in the loan disbursement
process.

<HEADLINE> Major News Items in Leading Israeli Newspapers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, August 16 (Xinhua) -- The following are major news
items in leading Israeli newspapers Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The Jerusalem Post:
</P>
<P>
-- The infiltration of the Soujud outpost in the security zone
in south Lebanon last Sunday by a Hezbollah gunman who then
escaped alive was a "serious operational failure," Israel's Chief
of General Staff Lt. Gen. Shaul Mofaz said.
</P>
<P>
Following his own summary inquiry into the incident, Mofaz
ordered that disciplinary action be taken against three Israeli
paratroopers involved.
</P>
<P>
Haaretz:
</P>
<P>
-- The political tension between Prime Minister Benjamin
Netanyahu and Defense Minister Yitzhak Mordechai rose another
notch over the weekend with Netanyahu reportedly being furious
with Mordechai for "arguing about honor."
</P>
<P>
The defense minister is boiling mad that Netanyahu decided to
name a new candidate to represent Likud in the Tiberias mayoral
race, slighting Mordechai's brother, Motti, who had won the No.2
spot in a local internal party vote but was passed over by
Netanyahu, sources close to Mordechai said.
</P>
<P>
Yediot Aharonot:
</P>
<P>
-- Senior officers in Israel's Northern Command are critical
of Mofaz's decision to reprimand the three paratroopers -- an
officer and two soldiers -- involved in the so-called "Soujud
fiasco."
</P>
<P>
Mofaz, who said the first duty of the soldiers was to kill the
Hezbollah infiltrator, has instructed that the reprimands be noted
in their records.

<HEADLINE> Top Hamas Activist Escapes From Palestinian Jail </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, August 16 (Xinhua) -- Palestinian and Israeli troops
have conducted joint searches in and around the West Bank town of
Jericho for a top Hamas member who had escaped from a Palestinian
jail there, it was reported Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Imad Awadallah, who had been jailed without trial by the
Palestinian National Authority (PNA) since April on suspicion of
shooting dead Hamas master bomb-maker Muhi Sharif, broke out of
his jail on Saturday afternoon, Israeli newspapers said.
</P>
<P>
Palestinian security officials contacted Israel Saturday
evening about Awadallah's escape. Palestinian and Israeli troops
set up roadblocks throughout the West Bank during the search, the
reports said.
</P>
<P>
Awadallah, 29, was considered as one of the top four Hamas
military activists, was arrested in April as a suspect after
Sharif was found dead on March 29 beside a car that blew up in
Ramallah, the West Bank.
</P>
<P>
Palestinian authorities said Sharif, who was accused by Israel
of masterminding a string of deadly suicide bombings, was killed
in an internal power struggle.
</P>
<P>
Palestinian legislators who have visited Awadallah in jail said
he has denied any connection with the killing.
</P>
<P>
Hamas has accused Israel and the PNA of killing Sharif, but
Israel has denied any role in the death.

<HEADLINE> Zhejiang Province to Invest Heavily in Infrastructure </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HANGZHOU, August 16 (Xinhua) -- East China's Zhejiang Province
will increase investment in infrastructure by 10 billion yuan
this year in order to increase demand and to realize an
economic growth rate of 10 percent.
</P>
<P>
This move is being taken by the prosperous province to
counteract the negative effects of the financial crisis in
Southeast Asia, according to Shao Qianlong, an official with the
Zhejiang Provincial Planning and Economic Commission.
</P>
<P>
Shao said that some 36 local infrastructure projects will have
sufficient funding this year. These are projects related to water
conservancy, railways, highways, electricity, environmental
protection and housing.
</P>
<P>
The province has set a goal of building seawalls, highways and
river embarkments within the next few years, all of which will be
at least 1,000 kilometers long. It will also construct an airport
with a handling capacity of 10 million passengers a year and
increase its installed generation capacity by 10 million kilowatts.
</P>
<P>
Both the central and local governments will adopt favorable
policies to encourage domestic and overseas companies to invest
in these infrastructure projects.
</P>
<P>
By the end of June, 1998, the province has invested 18.4
billion yuan in local infrastructure projects, up 30 percent from
the same period last year, according to official statistics.
</P>
<P>
The province's total fixed-asset investment is projected to
increase by 12 percent this year, with investment in
infrastructure up 18 percent, Shao said.

BAICHENG, August 16 (Xinhua) -- Science and technology are
playing a key flood-fighting role in Jilin Province in
northeast China.
</P>
<P>
Severe flooding on the Nenjiang River has raised the water
level of its tributaries to record heights, threatening
several hundred kilometers of dikes in Baicheng City in
northwest Jilin.

<P>
Under the governor's instruction, a great many water
conservancy experts have rushed to the flood-control front line.

For example, every 500 meters of the embankment in Tongyu
County is being manned by a water conservancy technician.
</P>
<P>
When a dike in northeastern Baicheng was threatened, about 200
experts and technicians rushed to the scene.
</P>
<P>
The experts have also been sent to help the soldiers who are
fighting the floods.

<TEXT>
<P>
SOFIA, August 15 (Xinhua) -- A Bulgarian research institute has
obtained the highest per-unit output of lavender oil in 10 years,
one kilogram from 57 kilograms of lavender blossom.
</P>
<P>
The Research Institute for Roses, Aromatic and Medicinal Plants

varieties and the better farming machinery."

The 24 other distilleries in Bulgaria achieved a yield of one
kilogram of lavender oil from 100-110 kilograms of blossom.

<HEADLINE> Myanmar Confirms Suspension of Foreigners' Sentences </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
YANGON, August 16 (Xinhua) -- The Myanmar government Sunday
confirmed that it had suspended the sentences, handed down on 18
foreigners by a district special court, by deporting them on
Friday.
</P>
<P>
The 18 foreigners -- 10 men and 8 women from the United States,
Indonesia, Malaysia, Thailand, the Philippines and Australia --
were sentenced by the court on Friday to five years' imprisonment.
</P>
<P>
The foreigners, who were charged with attempting to incite
unrest in Myanmar by distributing leaflets in Yangon, the capital
city, were then deported after the Myanmar Ministry of Home
Affairs suspended the sentences.
</P>
<P>
The official New Light of Myanmar newspaper quoted the ministry
as saying that the ministry's decision to allow the 18 foreigners
to leave was made in consideration of the fact that most of them
are from neighboring fellow member countries of the Association of
Southeast Asian Nations, with which Myanmar is on existing
friendly terms.
</P>
<P>
"The 18 did not know the situation of Myanmar definitely and
they were found guilty of committing offense because of persuasion
and deception of Alternative ASEAN Network on Burma," the ministry
said.
</P>
<P>
"They confessed to having committed the offense," the ministry
said, adding that requests for their release had been made by
their families and officials of respective governments.
</P>
<P>
It is reported that the concerned countries including the
United States welcomed the Myanmar government's decision on the
eighteen's release.

<HEADLINE> Sri Lanka's LTTE to Free Indian Crew </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
COLOMBO, August 16 (Xinhua) -- Sri Lanka's Liberation Tigers of
Tamil Eelam (LTTE) had agreed to free the 17 Indian crew members
from a foreign merchant ship they had hijacked, International
Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) sources said Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The LTTE rebels were quoted as claiming that they were willing
to release the 17 crew members. ICRC officials began talks on
Saturday with the LTTE to secure their release, the sources told
Xinhua by telephone.
</P>
<P>
LTTE gunmen on Friday morning seized a Dubai-owed merchant ship
with 21 crew members on board, including 17 Indian nationals.
</P>
<P>
The ship was on its way to the northern peninsula of Jaffna
from Colombo when it was hijacked near Mullaithivy coast. It was
carrying cement and general cargo for traders of Jaffna city.
</P>
<P>
Sri Lankan Air force jets bombed the 6,000-ton ship Friday
evening in a bid to destroy it to prevent the cargo from falling
into the rebels' hands.
</P>
<P>
The LTTE rebels claimed that they took the crew because the
ship was "violating Tamil territorial waters."
</P>
<P>
The LTTE radio Voice of Tiger announced last night that the
crew was in their custody and would be handed over to the ICRC
after interrogations were over.
</P>
<P>
"We are trying to get the crew members released as soon as
possible," the ICRC sources said.
</P>
<P>
The LTTE has been fighting a war against the government for a
separate Tamil state in the north and east of Sri Lanka since
1983.

BELGRADE, August 15 (Xinhua) -- Fierce fighting between the
Serbian police force and ethnic Albanian militants continued
almost all day on Saturday along the Deccani-Pech highway in
Kosovo, the Pristina press center reported.

CARACAS, August 15 (Xinhua) -- The Venezuelan Aluminum Complex
will be put on auction in September, the third attempt this year
to privatize the enterprise plagued by mounting losses, the El

</P>
<P>
The base price for the complex is set at 207 million
U.S. dollars while registration of bidders will start next Monday

<P>
The previous two auction attempts failed as bidders complained
that the base prices of 2.1 billion and 1.55 billion dollars were
too high.
</P>
<P>
A spokesman for the Complex said a consortium formed by
Britain's Billiton, the United States' Kaiser and Venezuela's

A recent readjustment of the consortium's stock composition

TIRANA, August 15 (Xinhua) -- The European Union (EU) warned

Reports from Skopje, capital of Macedonia, said the remarks
were made by Ferhard Jandl, head of an EU delegation at the end of
its two-day visit to Macedonia, which shares 150 kilometers of

settled as soon as possible, but priority should be placed on the
issue of refugees there.

their homes and farms in Kosovo since February when fighting began
between ethnic Albanians and Serb police.

BEIJING, August 16 (Xinhua) -- In the first half of this year
China's tea exports increased 17 percent from the same period last
year to 98,625 tons, with turnover surging 18 percent to 26.15
million U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
Official figures show that the average export tea price climbed
to 1.71 U.S. dollars per kilogram, up 0.02 U.S. dollar over last
year.
</P>
<P>
Liu Yichen, a foreign trade official in charge of tea export,
said that if there is no significant increase in tea supply on
the world market, the tea price will continue its upward trend in
the second half of this year.
</P>
<P>
However, the floods that have swept across south China, where
the country's main tea plantations are located, may have a
negative impact on the supply of tea products in the months to
come, he said.
</P>
<P>
The Ministry of Foreign Trade and Economic Cooperation
(MOFTEC) issued a new regulation recently on the management of tea
exports, under the terms of which the government will no longer
apply unified management to the export of tea.
</P>
<P>
Foreign trade companies and production enterprises which have
obtained the right from the MOFTEC to export tea will be able to
handle the export business by themselves.

BUENOS AIRES, August 15 (Xinhua) -- Peruvian President Alberto
Fujimori and his Ecuadoran counterpart Jamil Mahuad praised a
recent agreement to disengage troops of the two countries for its
role in avoiding border armed conflicts.
</P>
<P>
The two leaders, meeting in Paraguayan capital of Asuncion on

definitive way the possibility of an armed conflict.

Fujimori said that his government is willing to restart peace
talks with Ecuador "at the best moment." The two countries fought
a brief and undeclared border war in 1995 for the possession of
Amazonian territory.
</P>
<P>
Talks between Peru and Ecuador to reach a definitive
understanding to end the more than 50 years of border disputes
have been supported by Argentina, Brazil, Chile and the United
States, the four countries that guaranteed the Rio De Janeiro
Protocol.
</P>
<P>
However, the protocol had been discontinued since the end of

<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, August 15 (Xinhua) -- U.S. President Bill Clinton
on Saturday condemned a deadly bombing in Northern Ireland and
said that it must not set back the peace process there.
</P>
<P>
"On behalf of every American, I condemn this butchery and hope
that the culprits will be brought to justice quickly," said
Clinton in a statement released by the White House.
</P>
<P>
The statement said Clinton's planned visit to Northern Ireland
in early September was expected to go forward as planned despite
heightened tension.
</P>
<P>
"Today's terrorist bombing in Omagh was a barbaric act intended
to wreck Northern Ireland's aspirations for peace and
reconciliation," Clinton said in the statement.
</P>
<P>
He urged all parties to step up efforts to end the violence.
"Now is the time for the parties of peace in Northern Ireland to
redouble their efforts," he said.
</P>
<P>
"I renew my pledge to stand with the people of Northern Ireland
against the perpetrators of violence; they will find no friends
here," Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
Clinton plans to visit Northern Ireland and Ireland in early
September after visiting Russia to show U.S. support for a peace
process aimed at power sharing between the contending groups.
</P>
<P>
"This (bombing) is not expected to affect his itinerary," said
P.J. Crowley, a White House spokesman.
</P>

the Northern Irish town of Omagh near Belfast on Saturday, killing

<HEADLINE> China's Retail Sector Suffers Drops in Sales, Profits </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, August 16 (Xinhua) -- Overshadowed by a sluggish
macroeconomic climate, China's shopping malls suffered sharp
decreases in sales and profits in the first half of this year.
</P>
<P>
Statistics from the China National Commercial Information
Center show that the country's leading 260 department stores
achieved total retail sales of 42.05 billion yuan in the first
half of this year, with growth of 9.4 percent from the same period
of last year.
</P>
<P>
However, this growth figure was down 4.3 percentage points
compared with the corresponding period last year. Profits of the
260 department stores plummeted 7.5 percent to 1.5 billion yuan in
the first half of this year.
</P>
<P>
China's retail sector, suffering from a buyers' market, posted
weak growth of 6.8 percent in the first half of this year,
plunging 4.2 percentage points from the same period last year.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, the national retail price index has also seen adverse
growth for nine consecutive months, down from -0.4 percent last
October to -2.1 percent in June, according to the State Statistics
Bureau (SSB).
</P>
<P>
As supermarkets and chain stores spring up across the country,
the profit margins of large stores unavoidably shrink.
</P>
<P>
An SSB report show that 57.7 percent of the leading 260
department stores suffered declining profits in the first half of
this year while 25 percent of them were in deficit.
</P>
<P>
However, experts held that profits may rebound in the second
half of this year as the government investment available to expand
domestic demand takes effect.

<HEADLINE> Southern Island Province Boosts Mining Industry </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, August 16 (Xinhua) -- South China's Hainan Province
will continue to tap the potential of its mining industry, today's
China's Daily reports.
</P>
<P>
Liang Xinnan, director of the Hainan Provincial
Mineral Resources Management Department, pointed out the progress of
Hainan's mining sector by referring to the 1996 output value of 764
million yuan (92 million U.S. dollars) from mining exploration,
and that of 2.675 billion yuan (322 million dollars) from related
mining processing industries.
</P>
<P>
In 1997, the output of the island province's mining sector
stood at 800 million yuan (96 million dollars), while the figure
for the mining processing sector was 3.5 billion yuan (421 million
dollars).
</P>
<P>
The two sectors combined to account for 18.6 percent of
Hainan's total industrial output in 1997.
</P>
<P>
Liang called for full use of the abundant mineral resources to
boost the economy.
</P>
<P>
Hainan has 88 types of verified minerals, of which 63 are
verified industrial-value reserves with a total economic potential
of 207.4 billion yuan (25 billion dollars).
</P>
<P>
However, Hainan's mineral exploitation sector is still in its
infancy, with only 35 of the 63 verified reserves being exploited.
</P>
<P>
Few foreign investors engaged in large-scale mining and refined
mining processing industries, according to the official.
</P>
<P>
A Mining Exploration Supervision office was established to
forbid activities such as non-government authorized exploration,
illegal mineral resource transfer and random exploitation.

<P>
MANAGUA, August 15 (Xinhua) -- Illegal fishing and extraction
of maritime products by foreign ships in Nicaragua's territorial
waters have caused the country an estimated annual loss of 25-30
million dollars, a Naval Force officer said Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Although illegal fishing is not as rampant as in the previous
years, foreign boats are still engaged in illegal extraction of
marine products, said Naval Force captain Manuel Rivas Guatemala.
</P>
<P>
The limited budgets and naval resources to maintain the
surveillance along both coastlines of the country are the biggest
problem for the Nicaraguan naval force.

"We need to remain 30 days in territorial waters with at least
two units," said the officer.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Oil Giant Sets Ambitious Profit Target </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, August 16 (Xinhua) -- The recently reshuffled China
National Petroleum Corp (CNPC) plans to earn 2.79 billion yuan in
profits in 1998, said Ma Fucai, president of the corporation.
</P>
<P>
Ma said that this ambitious target indicates that CNPC is
trying its best to contribute to the fulfilment of the country's
eight percent economic growth goal.
</P>
<P>
Producing 67 percent of China's crude oil, CNPC recorded 10.18
billion yuan in profits and paid 22.89 billion yuan in taxes last
year.
</P>
<P>
However, CNPC has suffered formidable problems since the
beginning of 1998 due to the Asian financial turmoil and the slump
in international oil prices.
</P>
<P>
In June this year, the central government decontrolled the country's
oil pricing system, letting the prices of crude and oil products
be driven down to the levels on the international market.
</P>
<P>
In the first half of this year, CNPC made only 150 million yuan
in profits, which was 6.24 billion yuan less than in the same
period last year.
</P>
<P>
Ma said the corporation has asked its oilfields to enhance
output as much as possible in the second half of this year, and
the daily oil output is targeted to reach 298,500 tons by the end
of September.
</P>
<P>
CNPC plans to produce 107.8 million tons of crude oil in
1998. It pumped 53 million tons in the first six months of this
year.

<HEADLINE> Financial Crisis Won't Affect Future Of Xiamen </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
XIAMEN, August 16 (Xinhua) -- In spite of the increasing impact
of the Asian financial crisis on China, the economic prospects of
Xiamen look good, the Secretary of the Xiamen City Communist Party
Committee Shi Zhaobin told Xinhua recently.
</P>
<P>
Xiamen, a port city in Fujian Province, has been affected by
the financial crisis, Shi said, but they have managed to minimize
the effects even though the city's economy depends to a great
extent on exports and overseas investment.
</P>
<P>
Overseas investment in Xiamen was 19.3 percent more in the
first quarter of this year than the same period of last year, even
though Southeast Asian investment fell 26.7 percent during the
period. January-March exports to Southeast Asia, Japan and the
Republic of Korea were down more than 40 percent, but exports
overall were up 12.3 percent on a year-on-year basis.
</P>
<P>
Shi attributed this to the city's having turned to Europe and
America for investment starting as early as in 1992, when
favorable special economic special zone policies began to lose
their appeal.
</P>
<P>
Xiamen has companies from 26 countries and regions investing in
it. European and American investment jumped eight-fold last year
and was more than double in the first quarter of this
year. Exports to Europe and America have also grown significantly.
</P>
<P>
Xiamen's GDP was 37.1 billion yuan last year, more than 24
times that in 1980, when Xiamen became a special economic zone to
pursue flexible policies to encourage investors from Taiwan, Hong
Kong and overseas.
</P>
<P>
Continued infrastructure investment of 3 billion yuan each year
on average will help Xiamen's economic growth in the future, Shi
said, adding that he is confident that its GDP will exceed 40
billion yuan by the end of the century.

HAIKOU, August 16 (Xinhua) -- Financial conditions in Haikou,
the capital of China's Hainan Province, are now stable in spite of
a shortage of funds and recent shutdown of a local bank, says Wang
Faren, the City's mayor.
</P>
<P>
The Hainan Development Bank, a major local bank, was closed
because of its inability to return deposits and there was a run on
the bank when depositors began to fear financial disorder.
</P>
<P>
The bank was taken over by the Industrial and Commercial Bank
of China, one of the country's largest commercial banks, a move
that calmed local depositors, Wang says.
</P>
<P>
He says that Haikou has had positive growth in the first half
of this year, with the GDP up 8.1 percent from the same period of
last year.
</P>
<P>
Bank deposits only dropped slightly to 22 billion yuan in the

<P>
SHANGHAI, August 16 (Xinhua) -- Domestic-worker agencies in
Shanghai shall provide adequate training to prospective household
workers before sending him or her out on a job.
</P>
<P>
This requirement is part of the new regulations governing the
management of domestic-worker agencies which recently went into
effect in China's leading manufacturing center.
</P>
<P>
With living standards improving fast, the demand for domestic
workers is growing at an unprecedented rate in China's big
cities. However, the lack of market regulation has often led to
problems such as cheating and poor service.
</P>
<P>
In accordance with the new regulations, domestic-worker agencies
in Shanghai must be licensed by the local labor department before
starting a business, and their operations must be confined to
finding help for families, not for organizations.
</P>
<P>
The responsibilities of the agencies also include issuing work
permits, organizing medical check-ups, providing guarantees as
required, and handling disputes between its employees and the
families they serve.

<HEADLINE> Foreign Professionals Help Expand Guangxi Economy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Nanning, August 16 (Xinhua) -- Foreign professionals and
advanced technology are increasingly contributing to the economic
growth of the Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region in south China.
</P>
<P>
The region has put in place regulations and favorable policies
to import technologies, equipment, and professionals for local
agriculture and industry. And these policies have produced good
results.
</P>
<P>
Guangxi has so far increased incomes of rural residents by 42.8
million yuan (5.2 million U.S. dollars) by developing their dairy
industry under the guidance of experts from India and Pakistan.
</P>
<P>
Widespread application of new rice-planting techniques in dry
areas in 1995, a method imported from Japan, also has helped raise
per-hectare rice output by 716 kilograms, bringing the region an
output increase valued at 387 million yuan. As a result, farmers
have now employed the method over some 1.46 million hectares of
crops this year.
</P>
<P>
A German expert helped solve a technical problem for the
Liuzhou Machinery Factory, bringing the defective-product ratio
down from 3.5 percent to 2 percent.
</P>
<P>
These successes have encouraged the local government to attract
more foreign professionals and technology in a bid to upgrade its
pillar industries. Related departments also are working to
introduce market-oriented personnel systems as part of this
effort, government sources said.

ROME, August 15 (Xinhua) -- Five people were killed and three
others slightly injured shortly after midnight Saturday when a
landslide crashed onto the Italian side of the Brenner highway

<P>
LONDON, August 15 (Xinhua) -- A dramatic last-gasp goal from
David Beckham saved Manchester United from defeat, making the
title contender to draw with Leicester 2-2 in the opening game of
the English Premier league on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The Foxes were on course to continue their remarkable record
against United when they led 2-0 with just 12 minutes remaining,
but substitute Teddy Sheringham pulled a goal back before David
Beckham equalised with a free-kick deep into stoppage time.
</P>
<P>
Leicester boss Martin O'Neill admitted: "I'm actually very
disappointed. To be 2-0 up at Old Trafford on the opening day of
the season and despite Manchester United having the majority of
the possession in the second half, overall I thought we had the
better chances in the game. But we were never comfortable, even
at 2-0 and we just got a wee bit tired and sloppy."
</P>
<P>
United boss Alex Ferguson said:"It was a very poor, sluggish
performance from us and we can only improve."
</P>
<P>
Coventry City sent Chelsea crashing to an opening day defeat
for the second successive season, beating the much-fancied
English title challengers 2-1 with goals from Darren Huckerby and
Dion Dublin.
</P>
<P>
Chelsea, starting with nine overseas players in their line-up
including debutants Albert Ferrer of Spain, French World Cup
winner Marcel Desailly and Pierluigi Casiraghi of Italy,were 2-0
down after only 16 minutes and never recovered.
</P>
<P>
They pulled a goal back after 37 minutes when Uruguayan
Gustavo Poyet headed home a Denis Wise cross, and although
Casiraghi went close to scoring three times, Coventry, who beat
them 3-2 at Highfield Road on the opening day of last
season,still held on for the points.
</P>
<P>
Coventry manager Gordon Strachan said: "We had to work very
hard to beat them today, they are a team packed with world class
stars and they worked hard as well. But it was good to see the
moves we had worked on in training pay off."

<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, August 15 (Xinhua) -- Northern Ireland's First Minister
David Trimble said Saturday that the bomb blast, which killed at
least 26 people in the town of Omagh, Northern Ireland, could have
been avoided if Irish republican guerrillas had handed in their
arsenals.
</P>
<P>
"Make no mistake about it, this bomb would not have been made
or been detonated if Sinn Fein/IRA had handed over its explosives
and weapons," Trimble said in a statement issued from Germany,
where he is on holiday, according to Reuters.
</P>
<P>
Trimble said the blast which ripped through a busy shopping
street was "designed to cause the maximum amount of terror".
</P>
<P>
"There is no excuse, no justification, no reason for this
murderous terrorist onslaught," he said. "This day will forever be
remembered as the worst in our history. This day will be
remembered for its savagery and its naked hatred."
</P>
<P>
Trimble, leader of the Protestant Ulster Unionist Party (UUP),
assumed his new post on July 1 as part of an agreement intended to
end 30 years of violence in Northern Ireland.
</P>
<P>
The conflict has seen violence from republican guerrillas,
drawn from the Catholic community and opposed to British rule, and
from armed groups from the Protestant majority population
determined to preserve it.
</P>
<P>
The agreement brought new optimism to the province but
Protestant opponents of the deal were angry that republicans were
allowed to benefit from it without having to hand over any of the
weapons from their vast arsenals first.

the bomb really was, after receiving a bomb threat, and about 20
minutes later the bomb blew up behind them, he said.
</P>
<P>
Dorothy Boyle, a Omagh resident, said "I saw bodies lying
everywhere, dead people being zipped into bags. The bodies were
lying there with water running over them from burst pipes. There
were limbs lying about that had been blown off people. Everyone
was running round trying to help people."
</P>
<P>
Local businessman Sean Conway said "I could see a lot of
injured people and people running everywhere, screaming and
crying, looking for their relatives, their friends, their sisters
and their brothers. It's just pandemonium."

<HEADLINE> Pattern of Recent Bombings in N. Ireland Analyzed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, August 15 (Xinhua) -- The bomb attack in Omagh this
afternoon fits into a pattern of bombings carried out in Northern
Ireland market towns over the past few weeks and months, which
Irish security forces believed to be the work of the Real IRA, a
splinter group, though no group has claimed responsibility for
today's explosion yet.
</P>
<P>
But unlike those attacks, which caused considerable damage to
property, the Omagh bomb today has led to carnage on a scale which
has not been seen since Enniskillen in November, 1987, or
Belfast's Shankill Road in October, 1993, according to analysts.
</P>
<P>
As such, it has already plunged the province back into its
darkest days and the repercussions are likely to be far-reaching,
a BBC report said.
</P>
<P>
The Irish security forces insist that the recent bombings are
the work of dissidents - primarily, a splinter group called the
Real IRA, who, they say, have not been assisted by the IRA proper.
</P>
<P>
But many unionists and loyalists find that difficult to accept.
One loyalist politician warned earlier this month that the
loyalist ceasefire might not hold if anyone was killed by a
dissident republican bomb, according to earlier reports.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, within mainstream unionism, there has been
increasing nervousness about the release of paramilitary prisoners
and other aspects of the Good Friday agreement.
</P>
<P>
In a fortnight's time, U.S. President Clinton is due in
Northern Ireland to celebrate the achievements of the peace
process. But after this afternoon's atrocity in Omagh, ordinary
people in Northern Ireland might ask where the peace process is
going.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Preparing for Testimony in Lewinsky Probe </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, August 15 (Xinhua) -- U.S. President Bill Clinton
met with his lawyers on Saturday to prepare for his grand jury
testimony.
</P>
<P>
It was likely Clinton would make a televised appearance to talk
about Monday's testimony for independent counsel Kenneth Starr's
grand jury probing the White House sex scandal, news reports
quoted unidentified White House officials as saying.
</P>
<P>
But one official said a final decision on a statement would
depend on how the president felt about it on Monday. "Nothing's
going to happen until Monday," according to the reports.
</P>
<P>
Clinton will be the first sitting U.S. president to give sworn
testimony to a criminal grand jury probing his actions.
</P>
<P>
He will be questioned at the White House, with his words
transmitted live to a federal courthouse a few blocks away.
</P>
<P>
Clinton's private attorney, David Kendall, and Mickey Kantor,
the former Commerce secretary, were seen entering the White House
on Saturday to help prepare the president. More talks were
expected on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Clinton was expected to face tough questions about his
relationship with Lewinsky, 25, who according to sources told the
grand jury last week that she and the president had a number of
sexual encounters in the White House and discussed cover stories
to disguise their relationship.
</P>
<P>
In earlier sworn statements to lawyers in a sexual harassment
case filed against him, Clinton denied having sexual relations
with Lewinsky, now 25.
</P>
<P>
Lewinsky also denied having sex with Clinton when asked about
it by lawyers for Paula Jones, but changed her account when
brought before the grand jury after receiving blanket immunity
from prosecution by Starr.
</P>
<P>
Recent polls suggest most Americans believe Clinton had an
affair with Lewinsky. Even so, the polls show most of those
surveyed would not lose confidence in him as president.
</P>
<P>
A Newsweek poll released on Saturday said 56 percent of
Americans anticipated Clinton will not tell the whole truth in his
testimony. But only 24 percent said they would think worse of
Clinton if he admitted that he had an ongoing sexual relationship
with Lewinsky.

<HEADLINE> Northern Ireland Explosion Death Toll Rises to 26 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, August 15 (Xinhua) -- At least 26 people, instead of 21
as previously reported, including an 18-month-old infant, have
been killed in the worst paramilitary bombing since the start of
the Northern Ireland conflict 30 years ago.
</P>
<P>
Political leaders have been joined by the Queen in expressing
their sympathy for the bereaved and those injured in the explosion
in the market town of Omagh.
</P>
<P>
The blast left more than 100 people injured or maimed.
</P>
<P>
Martin McGuinness, the chief negotiator for Sinn Fein, was
quoted by BBC as saying: "This appalling act was carried out by
those opposed to the peace process."
</P>
<P>
"It is designed to wreck the process and everyone should work
to ensure the peace process continues," he said.
</P>
<P>
BBC called the statement "the strongest condemnation of an act
of paramilitary violence by the party which represented the IRA in
the Stormont talks."
</P>
<P>
No group has claimed responsibility for the bomb, which was
planted in a maroon Vauxhall Astra. But local Chief Constable
Ronnie Flanagan said: "Undoubtedly we will be focusing our
attention on those who call themselves the 'Real IRA'. It is
possible and probable that they carried out this attack,"
according to BBC.

<HEADLINE> Irish Prime Minister Vows to Suppress Terrorists </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, August 15 (Xinhua) -- Irish Prime Minister Bertie Ahern
Saturday night condemned the Northern Ireland bomb blast and
pledged to "ruthlessly suppress" the terrorists behind the
bombing.
</P>
<P>
British police were quoted by BBC Television as saying Saturday
evening the death toll in the Northern Irish town Omagh bombing
has risen to 26 and more than 100 others including five children
were injured.
</P>
<P>
In a strongly-worded statement issued in Dublin, Ahern was
reported as saying that the lastest bombing was a "dastardly"
incident and an "attack on democracy."
</P>
<P>
Ireland's main opposition Fine Gael leader John Bruton called
for an "all-Ireland security initiative that would make the
commissioning of such outrages impossible."
</P>
<P>
Irish President Mary McAleese said that she was deeply shocked
by the terrorist bombing.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Gerry Adams of Sinn Fein, political wing of the
Irish Republican Army (IRA), has unequivocally condemned the Omagh
blast.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Says Bombing Won't Affect Clinton's </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, August 15 (Xinhua) -- The bomb explosion in a
Northern Ireland market town will not change U.S. President Bill
Clinton's plan to travel on September 3 to Belfast, said the White
House on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Clinton planned to visit Northern Ireland after visiting Russia
to celebrate the province's historic peace accord negotiated under
his administration's urging and guidance.
</P>
<P>
At least 25 people were killed in a bomb explosion in Northern
Ireland earlier on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
"I'm not aware that there would be any changes to the trip as a
result of this" bombing, said White House spokesman P.J. Crowley.
</P>
<P>
"Clearly the people of Northern Ireland and Ireland have chosen
a path toward peace. Violence has no place in that process,"
Crowley added.
</P>
<P>
The bombing, in the crowded market town of Omagh, occurred
some distance away from areas near Belfast where Clinton plans
to visit.

<HEADLINE> Round-up:  Western Countries Busy Evacuating From </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, August 15 (Xinhua) -- Western countries including
Britain, France, Belgium and U.S are busy evacuating their
nationals from Congo (K) where a military rebellion against the
government has lasted for two weeks.
</P>
<P>
Royal marines from the British Navy arrived Saturday by air at
the south Atlantic island of Ascension, 3000 kilometers west of
Kinshasa, ready to intervene or evacuate British nationals if the
situation deteriorates in the rebel-besieged city, a report
dispatched by Deutsche Press Agentur DPA said.
</P>
<P>
DPA quoted a British Defense Ministry spokesman as saying in
London that the 190-strong unit of royal marines is part of 40
commandoes based at Taunton in Somerset.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the British Foreign Office has advised the 300
British nationals in Congo (K) to leave as soon as possible.
</P>
<P>
The marine unit will remain on standby on Ascension Island and
the Defense Ministry spokesman said that the unit will only be
used if the situation deteriorates further.
</P>
<P>
Fears escalated for the safety of foreign nationals trapped in
the Congolese capital after commercial airlines such as Belgian
Carrier Sabena and South Africa suspended their flights earlier
this week.
</P>
<P>
Early Saturday, three French Army Rransall Aircraft arrived in
Brazzaville, capital of the neighboring Congo Republic, from
Gabon to evacuate foreigners from Congo (K).
</P>
<P>
The foreigners being evacuated, number at about 700, include
French, South Koreans, and other nationals, according to Agence
France-Presse AFP.
</P>
<P>
They were escorted in buses toward landing stage on the Congo
River and due to cross the river on a barge for Brazzaville.
</P>
<P>
Some 650 soldiers of a battalion of the French troops
stationed in Gabon have been put on alert.
</P>
<P>
However, Brazzaville is separated from Kinshasa by the Congo
River and the river border has been closed by the Kinshasa
authorities for about a week.
</P>
<P>
The French hoped it will be re-opened to facilitate the
evacuation.
</P>
<P>
Also on Saturday, a Belgian aircraft flew to Libreville in
Gabon, about 800 kilometers from Kinshasa to be ready to evacuate
Belgian citizens from Congo (K)
</P>
<P>
"It is on standby for an evacuation of Belgians from Kinshasa,
Belgian Foreign Ministry spokesman Hubert Cooreman said in
Brussels, adding that there are about 3,000 Belgians in Congo
(K), a former Belgian colony,
</P>
<P>
Earlier reports said that the U.S. flew out 130 foreign
nationals Friday, including around 50 of the total 250 Americans
in the country.
</P>
<P>
During the two-week long Tutis-led rebellion, rebels have
seized the important eastern towns of Goma, Bukaveu Uvira and
Bunia.
</P>
<P>
The rebels said Saturday that they have also captured Matadi,
an important port that controls the flow of food stuffs and other
vital supplies up the Congo River to Kinshasa.
</P>
<P>
Rebel leader Jean Pierre Ondekane confirmed Friday to Reuters
that the rebel forces have taken Ingara Electric Dam, 250
kilometers south-west of Kinshasa on the lnga River, leading a
20-hour blackout in the capital.
</P>
<P>
And foreign affairs ministers from Zambia, Zimbabwe, Namibia
and Tanzania mandated by a summit attended by seven southern
african leaders including Congolese President Laurent Kabila in
Zimbabwe on August 8, arrived Saturday in Kinshasa after they had
talks in Kigali with Rwanda's Vice-President Paul Kagame on ways
of ending the Congo (K) conflict.
</P>
<P>
Their mission is to broker a peace deal and investigate
Kinshasa's allegations that Rwanda and Uganda have been backing
the rebels, which were denied by both countries.
