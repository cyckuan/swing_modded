NRC FAULTS '97 INSPECTION AT N.Y. REACTOR  
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By DAVID W. CHEN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WHITE PLAINS, N.Y. _ In blunt language that was one part mea
culpa, one part warning, the Nuclear Regulatory Commission accused
both Consolidated Edison and its own staff Thursday of mishandling
a 1997 inspection of the Indian Point 2 nuclear plant, saying that
structural weaknesses should have been detected well before last
month's radiation leak.
</P>
<P>
   The agency's statements represented the boldest comments to date
in its evaluation of what went wrong before, during and after the
Feb. 15 leak, in which a corroded tube in one of the plant's steam
generators cracked, allowing radioactive water to mix with clean
water. That crack forced Con Edison, the plant's owner, to issue an
alert _ the second-lowest of four levels of nuclear emergency _ for
the first time since the plant opened in 1974, and prompted a rash
of criticism from nearby residents and public officials who said
that they should have been notified sooner.
</P>
<P>
   In recent weeks, Con Edison and the commission have both said
that the problem stemmed from a corroded tube in a steam generator.
But today, the commission cast a critical eye on Con Edison's most
recent inspection of the generators, in 1997, saying that the
utility had done a ``weak and incomplete'' job and that its
assessment of how much the tubes had degraded was inadequate.
</P>
<P>
   ``We believe that a more thorough operational assessment,'' said
one document released by the commission, ``would have predicted an
increased probability of tube leakage or rupture.''
</P>
<P>
   The memorandums did not say that there was a direct relationship
between the sloppy inspection and the Feb. 15 emergency. That kind
of determination will have to wait for at least a few weeks, as
both Con Edison and the commission wrap up more detailed reports,
said Neil Sheehan, a spokesman for the federal agency.
</P>
<P>
   What the memorandums did suggest, though, was that there was
less wiggle room, now, for both the utility and the NRC to say that
nothing could have been done to prevent the leak. And even more
important, perhaps, the memorandums raise the question of whether
the shoddy inspection work at Indian Point 2 was an isolated case.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think this falls into the category of self-criticism,''
Sheehan said. ``We need to look at the generic implications and
whether or not the lessons learned here can be applied to other
plants with steam generators.''
</P>
<P>
   Thursday might, Con Ed said that it did not have an immediate
reaction to the commission's findings, which were released on the
agency's Web site. ``We are in the process of reviewing it, and
it's too soon for us to comment on it,'' said Joseph P. Petta, a
Con Ed spokesman.
</P>
<P>
   Watchdogs of nuclear power, meanwhile, offered mixed reviews.
While some had suspected all along that the inspection process was
slipshod _ and that the NRC had functioned only as a rubber-stamp
of that process _ others were heartened by the fact that mistakes
were caught sooner rather than later.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you show that you can be self-critical and learn from that,
over all, the public trust goes up,'' said David Lochbaum, a
nuclear safety engineer with the Union of Concerned Scientists, in
Washington. ``The bad part of it is, Con Ed didn't do a good job,
and the NRC staff didn't do a good job and allowed the mistakes to
go on uncorrected. ''
</P>
<P>
   The memorandums emanated from a Feb. 28 request by the
commission for an independent review of the 1997 inspection process
at Indian Point, in Buchanan, about 35 miles north of Manhattan.
</P>
<P>
   The leak released radioactivity _ too small an amount to be
measured, officials said _ into the atmosphere. There were no
injuries. Still, it was the worst accident in the plant's 26-year
history.
</P>
<P>
   And a memorandum dated March 16 from Ashok C. Thandani, director
of the NRC's Office of Nuclear Regulatory Research, spelled out
just how unsatisfactory the inspection process was in 1997 _ as
well as the subsequent request by Con Edison in 1999 to delay
inspection until this year.
</P>
<P>
   The NRC also criticized its own staff, albeit more obliquely,
for failing to scrutinize Con Edison's analysis more rigorously. As
a result, the commission suggested that the entire basis for
granting Con Ed the delay in 1999 rested on faulty analysis.

   WASHINGTON _ Iraq has spent tens of millions of dollars in
recent months to build a military headquarters for an Iranian
opposition group that the Clinton administration considers a
terrorist organization, senior administration officials said
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   As evidence, the officials declassified a satellite photograph
of the complex, which covers 2.4 square miles and is in the Iraqi
city of Faluja, about 40 miles west of Baghdad. The officials said
the Iraqis had used profits from the illegal sale of oil to build
the complex for the exclusive use of the People's Mujahedeen, an
Iranian military and political movement whose goal is to overthrow
the Islamic Republic of Iran.
</P>
<P>
   The photo is to be made public by the State Department on Friday
in an effort to counter critics who say the sanctions imposed after
the Gulf war cause widespread suffering in Iraq. The administration
will argue that President Saddam Hussein is illegally smuggling oil
to support international terrorism and does not deserve relief from
the sanctions.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a propaganda campaign,'' a senior administration said
about issuing the photo. ``There's no question this is what we are
doing here. This is part of our effort to show the world the danger
Saddam would pose if the controls on the access to his oil revenues
were lifted.''
</P>
<P>
   Not coincidentally, at an open meeting of the U.N. Security
Council on Friday on the humanitarian situation in Iraq, the United
States will argue in favor of keeping tough sanctions against Iraq,
as well as finding ways to ease the Iraqi people's suffering.
</P>
<P>
   Administration officials insist that the new evidence against
Iraq is not related to the speech by Secretary of State Madeleine
Albright on Friday in which Albright announced the easing of some
sanctions against Iran to allow exports of Iranian carpets, caviar,
pistachios and dried fruits to the United States.
</P>
<P>
   But the satellite photo is quite likely to be welcomed by at
least some Iranian officials, who praised the United States when it
designated the People's Mujahedeen as a foreign terrorist
organization in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   It was created in the 1960s as an armed Islamic opposition
movement against Shah Mohammad Reza Pahlavi and fought in guerrilla
operations that forced his overthrow. But the People's Mujahedeen
was also avowedly socialist and was cut out of the power structure
built by the ayatollahs.
</P>
<P>
   The group turned against the new government and continues to
wage an armed struggle against the Iranian state from Iraq, which
provides the group with financial and logistical support and
military equipment. The People's Mujahedeen remains the most
powerful opponent of the Islamic Republic, attacking targets in
Iran and assassinating Iranian officials. It is generally believed
to have 15 to 20 bases in Iraq.
</P>
<P>
   The Mujahedeen complex near Baghdad, which is not yet operating,
was begun in late 1998 on the site of an Iraqi military area and is
said to include lakes, farms, barracks and administrative buildings
that can accommodate 3,000 to 5,000 people, administration
officials said.
</P>
<P>
   One official described the site as a ``headquarters which will
be used to coordinate Mujahedeen activities throughout Iraq and
elsewhere.''
</P>
<P>
   The officials declined to say how they could be certain that the
site was intended for Mujahedeen use, citing the need to protect
intelligence sources.
</P>
<P>
   Washington has used declassified satellite imagery for years in
its campaign against Iraq, showing photos that it says prove that
it is rebuilding factories that could make chemical weapons or
missiles and building sprawling palaces.

MEMBERS OF HOUSTON R&AMP;B GROUP BLAST MANAGER IN LAWSUIT 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By RON NISSIMOV 
and JEFF CHARLES 
c. 2000 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   HOUSTON _ Two members of Destiny's Child _ a local
rhythm-and-blues group that currently has the nation's top pop
single _ have filed a lawsuit accusing their manager and the other
singers of taking their money and kicking them out of the group.
</P>
<P>
   LeToya Luckett and LaTavia Roberson, both 18, say in their state
district court lawsuit that manager Mathew Knowles ``made money
from the girls while the girls themselves made virtually no
money.''
</P>
<P>
   Knowles is the father of the lead singer, Beyonce Knowles, 18,
and the legal guardian of singer Kelly Rowland, also 18, both of
whom are named as defendants.
</P>
<P>
   The Grammy-nominated group's second album, ``The Writing's on
the Wall,'' has sold more than 3 million copies and is currently
the seventh-best selling album on Billboard's pop charts. The song
``Say My Name`` tops the current pop and rhythm-and-blues charts in
Billboard.
</P>
<P>
   The lawsuit claims that Mathew Knowles tried to ``gain complete
control'' over Luckett when she was a minor by trying to persuade
her to accept him as her legal guardian. He also allegedly tried to
coerce Luckett and Roberson ``to live at his house and conform
everything from their diets to their relationship with their
parents.''
</P>
<P>
   ``He was all up in my personal business, telling me who I can
and who I can't date,'' Roberson said Wednesday. ``He told me if I
wasn't a virgin, I'd have to resign from the group. He told me I
made the rest of the girls look like sluts. He was totally
controlling.''
</P>
<P>
   Knowles, owner of Music World Management, did not return a call
seeking comment.
</P>
<P>
   Luckett and her mother, Pamela Luckett, also sued Knowles in
1998 in Harris County, claiming he intended to kick LeToya out of
the group. In that lawsuit, Pamela Luckett said in an affidavit
that she has tried in vain since 1993 to get an audit of the
group's finances.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I joined the group in Baton Rouge, La., and got on the
bus, Mr. Knowles had me removed from the bus by calling the
police,'' Pamela Luckett wrote of her attempt to be with her
daughter in 1998, when LeToya was battling asthma.
</P>
<P>
   LeToya submitted an affidavit in that suit saying Mathew Knowles
had tried to kick her out of the group since 1997 and once
``knowingly gave instructions that would have left me stranded and
alone in Tulsa, Okla.''
</P>
<P>
   Dallas attorney Gerald Conley, who represents Roberson and
LeToya Luckett, said Luckett had dropped the first suit on the
condition that her legal claims were preserved. The current suit
seeks unspecified actual and punitive damages.
</P>
<P>
   He said his clients have earned significantly less than $100,000
in total, much below what members of a group with a top pop song
should have earned. He said Mathew Knowles drew up a contract
giving himself 20 percent of gross earnings instead of net, as is
common in such contracts.
</P>
<P>
   Conley said it is unclear how much money is at stake because his
clients have had no access to financial records.
</P>
<P>
   The suit also claims the two other singers have received
preferential treatment.
</P>
<P>
   In Dec. 14 letters, Luckett and Roberson told Knowles that since
they were now legal adults, they had the right to terminate a
contract they had signed as minors in 1997. They said they intended
to exercise this right but still wanted to stay in the group.
</P>
<P>
   After the letter, the suit claims, Mathew Knowles, Beyonce
Knowles and Rowland ``went on a rampage to destroy LeToya and
LaTavia and their careers.''
</P>
<P>
   Mathew Knowles allegedly kept Luckett and Roberson in the dark
about their performances and replaced them with Farrah Franklin and
Michelle Williams, also named as defendants.
</P>
<P>
   According to the lawsuit, Franklin and Williams appear in a
recently released video of ``Say My Name`` even though they ``had
nothing whatsoever to do with it.''
</P>
<P>
   Luckett and Roberson said the defendants intended for Franklin
and Williams to replace them in the February Grammy Awards in Los
Angeles and the Soul Train Music Awards in April. The defendants
falsely said that Luckett and Roberson left the group over
``creative differences,'' the suit said.
</P>
<P>
   They claimed Knowles did not send them tickets for the Grammy
Awards, but ``had learned to anticipate Mr. Knowles and had
previously made arrangements'' for tickets. However, they said they
missed the Soul Train Awards because they received no information.
At the ceremony, Franklin and Williams performed with the group,
the suit said.
</P>
<P>
   LeToya Luckett said Wednesday she and Roberson are important
members of the group.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can't see TLC without Chilly, Left Eye or T-Boz,'' she
said of the veteran R&AMP;B group Destiny's Child is modeled after.
``That's because all of them were in the spotlight. Even though me
and LaTavia didn't sing lead, up onstage, everyone was up there.''

REFUGEES STRAIN RESOURCES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)

 c.2000 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   &QL; 
(PHOENIX) - Ahmed Mohammad Jawad dreamed of life in America when
his family was being persecuted by Iraq's Saddam Hussein.
</P>
<P>
   He arrived in January, a refugee eager for a fresh start. A week
later, though, an explosion blew off part of two fingers and broke
other bones in his hand. Doctors aren't sure if he'll ever be able
to use it.
</P>
<P>
   No hand and no English means no job.
</P>
<P>
   Jawad's case isn't the kind that Phoenix area refugee agencies
are designed to handle, and they're increasingly feeling the
strain.
</P>
<P>
   ``The program works for those who can work,'' said Robin Dunn
Marcos, regional director of the International Rescue Committee in
Phoenix. ``For those who can't work, there's no safety net, at
least in Phoenix. If we don't help them, they go to a homeless
shelter. And they don't speak English. So, what do we do?''
</P>
<P>
   IRC set aside $5,000 for the year for the occasional critical
refugee cases that need extra help. It spent twice that amount in
just three months.
</P>
<P>
   ``We all have them, the ones that really take a great deal of
time and a lot of resources,'' said Craig Thoresen, director of
refugee resettlement for Lutheran Social Ministry of the Southwest.
What they don't have, he said, is a reserve fund for special needs.
</P>
<P>
   So, the agencies depend on the public to help meet those needs,
which are many. More than 3,000 refugees arrived in Arizona last
year.
</P>
<P>
   There's the Cuban refugee with diabetes whose leg had to be
amputated because it was infected and hadn't been treated before
she arrived.Or another refugee from Cuba who suffered a broken
pelvis and other injuries when hit by a car in Phoenix.
</P>
<P>
   There are families from Kosovo who need mental health counseling
to deal with what they have seen _ ``ghosts that need to be
exorcised,'' Thoresen said.
</P>
<P>
   Or the single mother from Somalia who is being evicted from her
Phoenix area home. The government won't reimburse the agency for
moving a refugee into a new home.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yet can we have this woman be evicted? Of course not,''
Thoreson said.
</P>
<P>
   Refugee agencies can't simply turn away those whose situations
are too trying, Dunn Marcos agreed.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a program to save lives. These are people who have been
persecuted.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1988, 757 refugees - defined as people fleeing racial,
religious or ethnic persecution or conditions of war - came into
Arizona, accounting for less than 1 percent of those entering the
United States. By 1998, more than 2,800 arrived in the state, about
4 percent of the nation's refugees.
</P>
<P>
   Ali Al-Asady sees the demands every day as a caseworker for IRC.
He handled 27 families in February, from Iraqis to Cubans to
Vietnamese. He was a refugee himself in 1995, from Saudi Arabia .
</P>
<P>
   He says the aid to refugees usually is not enough to cover rent.
</P>
<P>
   Consider a family of three that arrives through IRC. They get
$348 per month in assistance (usually for a month or two), plus
food stamps. Yet rent for a small apartment is often more than
$350. And they generally must pay an additional $80 or so in
electricity.
</P>
<P>
   Then there are diapers, quarters for the washing machine, money
for the bus or for dish soap or basic medicines.
</P>
<P>
   The State Department gives refugee agencies a one-time payment
of $740 per person - and that is for everything from rent to paying
for mileage to drive refugees to doctors appointments. The rest is
up to the agencies, which rely heavily on fund-raising and help
from the public.
</P>
<P>
   IRC's Phoenix area office, for example, received about $50,000
last year in cash and donated items. According to national watchdog
groups, 93 cents of every dollar donated to IRC goes directly to
the refugees. But because of the demand from the unique cases,
money is tight.
</P>
<P>
   Many churches play an important role, picking up the slack by
essentially adopting refugee families.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some churches are amazing with what they can bring to the
table,'' Thoresen said. ``The resources, yes, but also the time.''
</P>
<P>
   Such help is especially critical for refugees who arrive and
don't have relatives here, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Mountain View Lutheran Church in Ahwatukee, for example,
``adopted'' a family from Kosovo. Church members found a job for
the husband. They drive the children to karate practice and have
arranged for free dental care.
</P>
<P>
   The refugees will keep coming, and they will keep hoping to find
the American Dream. Some will, said Al-Asady, the caseworker.
</P>
<P>
   ``They start from zero, they make their way up,'' he said.
``They are moving up in jobs. They are going to school.''
</P>
<P>
   Others, like a determined Jawad, will struggle but hope that
things improve.
</P>
<P>
   His wife is pregnant, and they already have a 14-month-old son
who needs diapers.
</P>
<P>
   ``You think the United States is the mother of the world and
everything is nice and easy,'' he said through an interpreter.
``Then you get here and reality hits. It's hard and difficult.''
</P>
<P>
   He stared at his mangled hand, wrapped in a partial cast with
pins where his bones used to be. He looked to his pregnant wife and
young son.
</P>
<P>
   ``It made everything difficult,'' he said of his injury. ``It
makes it difficult to take care of the family, to do the daily
things the house man would do for the family. I have to deal with
it.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm alone, and I'm responsible for my family. I'm not sure
what I can do.'' &QL;

BRACKETTVILLE _ Taking the scenic route on the way to the NCAA
South Regional in Austin.
</P>
<P>
   Basking in the sweet smell of mesquite, marveling at the rolling
tumbleweed and standing knee-deep in the mulberry and cacti that
cover the landscape as far as the eye can see.
</P>
<P>
   Welcome to Brackettville.
</P>
<P>
   Welcome to the real Brackettville, the one that has been here _
220 miles southwest of Austin between Mexico's Ciudad Acuna and
Uvalde _ long before Nike founder Phil Knight ever uttered the
words, ``What about trying a waffle iron?''
</P>
<P>
   This is as remote a place as there is in Texas, tucked quietly
amid rugged South Texas terrain and more than 100 working ranches
of at least 5,000 acres apiece.
</P>
<P>
   ``People ask me, `Is there a McDonald's there?''' said assistant
municipal district manager Kathryn Letsinger. ``No. `Is there a
Pizza Hut?' No. `Are there (movie theaters)?' No. `Then what's
there?'''
</P>
<P>
   This is where you find pure Texas at its throwback, cowboying
best.
</P>
<P>
   This is where John Wayne once burned the house down, literally,
after a long night of poker and partying while filming the movie
The Alamo.
</P>
<P>
   This is where Wyatt Earp once lived, Mexican bandidos engaged in
legendary battles with Texas freedom fighters, four Seminole Native
Americans won the Congressional Medal of Honor in Civil War-era
battles with renegades, Texas icon Judge Roy Bean reportedly had
romantic liaisons, Will Rogers kept a ranch home, World War II
generals George S. Patton and George Marshall trained tank
battalions and former President Lyndon Johnson went bird hunting
every year.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a lot of history here,'' said Zack Davis, a
veterinarian by profession who also owns the local hardware and
general store and whose great-great-grandparents helped found the
town in 1852.
</P>
<P>
   But one thing you will not find in Brackettville, pop. 1,872: a
place to buy Nike shoes.
</P>
<P>
   It is the most intriguing of phenomena about the only namesake
town in America for Nike's popular ``Bracketville'' television
slogan, which has become a catch phrase for the 2000 NCAA
Tournament.
</P>
<P>
   ``Unless you count the Internet,'' Letsinger said, ``you have to
drive to Del Rio or Uvalde for anything like that.''
</P>
<P>
   You also won't find Dick Vitale, any of the coaches featured in
the commercials or lush green lawns like the ones on TV.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, around here about the only things cropped as carefully
as the yards in the ads are sheep. Every fall, Brackettville
immerses itself in, well, shear madness.
</P>
<P>
   Sheep and goat farming are among the longtime traditions of
Brackettville, although it is anything but a big moneymaker.
</P>
<P>
   ``During World War II, wool and mohair used to bring 65 cents a
pound,'' Davis said. ``Right now it's hard to get 35 cents a pound.
It's just gone way down.''
</P>
<P>
   Brackettville's biggest industries today are hunting and
tourism, with some 30,000 people a year pulling off U.S. 90 long
enough to catch a tour of the 10,000-acre Shahan Ranch, where The
Alamo was filmed in 1959 and a replica of the Alamo mission and Old
San Antonio still stand.
</P>
<P>
   You can buy John Wayne belt buckles at the Alamo Village general
store. You also can buy John Wayne prints, John Wayne dominoes,
John Wayne buck knives, John Wayne videos and John Wayne bandannas.
You can even buy the ever-popular ``Alamo Crackers.''
</P>
<P>
   You just can't buy Nikes.
</P>
<P>
   Several other movies and commercials have been filmed in
Brackettville and Alamo Village, but not Nike's ``Bracketville''
spots.
</P>
<P>
   Approach anyone in Brackettville about the Nike commercials, and
you'll probably get a blank stare in return.
</P>
<P>
   ``Is it college or pro?'' said the proprietor of the Alamo
Village general store. Roughly 50 percent of the citizenry polled
Thursday did not realize Nike was giving Brackettville a whole new
image.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of us have satellite TV out here,'' Letsinger explained.
</P>
<P>
   A hoops mecca this is not, although Brackett Tigers coach Jimmy
Thomas worked a small miracle with these ranching kids this season
by taking the high school team to a 16-9 record, its best in years.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've seen the commercials, and some of the kids have, too,''
Thomas said. ``My first impression was, man, that's a lot nicer
than in real life. This really isn't a big basketball area, but
it's nice they're mentioning Brackettville.''
</P>
<P>
   Davis first found out about the spots two weeks ago, when an
overnight package with an Oregon return address arrived at his
store. Inside was a video of the commercials, a letter outlining
the ``Bracketville'' storyline and some T-shirts.
</P>
<P>
   ``I watch basketball to a degree, but I hadn't seen them,''
Davis said. ``When I saw the videos, I said, `Well, that's kind of
interesting.'''
</P>
<P>
   Lately, Davis has begun receiving calls from friends asking,
``Is that your store in the commercials?''
</P>
<P>
   It's not. And it is unclear whether Nike marketers even knew of
the real Brackettville when it launched the promotion. But last
week a video crew arrived in town to take various pictures for
research. And Thomas also received a package from Oregon last week,
as Nike donated 10 dozen basketballs, baseballs, softballs and
footballs to the school.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've never received the type of publicity we've gotten
lately,'' Brackettville city manager David Luna said. ``When you
talk about an old cowboy flick compared to a Nike commercial,
there's a real big difference there. Hopefully, you're not going to
have to explain anymore where Brackettville is. Maybe some people
around here haven't seen the commercials, but everyone else has.''
</P>
<P>
   Just don't come here looking for Dick Vitale or to buy the
latest Air Jordans.
</P>
<P>
   As Thursday's regional semifinals were tipping off, no one at
the Krazy Chicken Cafe was watching. At the other restaurant in
town, Barbara's Table, a handful of patrons sat on the patio
listening to country music on the radio and telling the proprietor
she outdid herself on the chile relleno casserole.
</P>
<P>
   Down the road at the ice house/hunting outfitter, patrons leaned
against the bar talking about deer corn and the front that's
supposed to be moving in.
</P>
<P>
   This is the real Brackettville, where the front door almost
always is unlocked, the butter rolls are to die for, some 30
percent of the population is 60 or older and the only Duke usually
mentioned is The Duke, not Mike Krzyzewski's team.
</P>
<P>
   It is quaint and pretty in all its ruggedness. It is boots and
belt buckles, limestone buildings and screen porches.
</P>
<P>
   The only big game is the kind you hope to see while sitting in
one of the thousands of deer blinds that sprout from the
countryside like beacons of life for a town that could have died
decades ago if not for its world-class hunting.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of ranchers were down on their luck for a long time,
until they started leasing their land for hunting,'' Letsinger
said. ``They'll tell you they're still ranchers, but hunting season
is what tides them over for the rest of the year. During hunting
season, (out-of-towners) stick out like a sore thumb.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hundreds of them come through here with their outfits, their
jacked-up trucks, their guns. They come through here and buy a
bunch of liquor, ammo, groceries and gifts for their wives so they
can prove they were here. It's what keeps us going.''
</P>
<P>
   Brackettville is all about quail, white-tailed deer, turkeys and
hogs _ not Spartans, Cyclones, Blue Devils and Tar Heels.
</P>
<P>
   The only big dance you'll hear about is the one over at Fort
Clark, the former cavalry post built in 1852 that thrived through
five wars before converting into a retirement community. It was at
Fort Clark where Wayne stayed during filming of The Alamo in 1959
and was notorious for his long nights of poker and partying.
</P>
<P>
   Once, Dean Martin visited Wayne on the movie set and the party
didn't stop until somehow Wayne's house burned to the ground at
daybreak. The gutted building still stands in the middle of Fort
Clark, a testament to The Duke.
</P>
<P>
   The only road to the Final Four you'll find here is Highway 90.
In fact, it's just about the only road you'll find.
</P>
<P>
   Brackettville was founded in this remote spot in 1852 only
because wagon trains needed a place to stop to rest horses and
sleep for the night. But it's the real thing. It's old-time Texas,
and now suddenly it has been thrust unknowingly into the nation's
limelight.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're proud of Brackettville,'' Luna said. ``It's a good, safe
city with a lot of history. What Nike has done, it gives us
something else to talk about and to be proud of. Everyone knows
about Brackettville now.
</P>
<P>
   ``Like people around here always say, with Highway 90 right
here, sooner or later almost everyone has to go through
Brackettville to get somewhere.''
</P>
<P>
   Including the Final Four. Just don't come here to buy a pair of
Nikes.

 MULLIGANS NOT GIVEN TO PLAYERS AT No. 17  
 (bl)  
 By CLIFTON BROWN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   PONTE VEDRA BEACH, Fla. _ The wind was tricky, the greens were
treacherous, and for many, the day was torture.
</P>
<P>
   Only 13 players completed sub-par rounds Thursday at the TPC at
Sawgrass, and they played terrific golf in extremely trying
conditions.
</P>
<P>
   How difficult was the opening round of the Players Championship?
Phil Mickelson was 10 over par after nine holes. Sergio Garcia shot
82. Colin Montgomerie, John Daly, Bob Tway and Craig Stadler all
had at least one triple bogey. And did anyone mention the famous
par-3 No. 17, featuring its island green, where a long list of
players could have used a mulligan? Forty-one balls sailed into the
water at No. 17, and unless conditions improve dramatically, many
more will follow.
</P>
<P>
   When it was over, Hal Sutton was alone and relieved on the top
of the leader board. Shooting a three-under-par 69, and showing
resiliency on a day that tested his skill and patience, Sutton held
a one-stroke lead when the first round was suspended by darkness,
with 21 players still on the course. First-round play will be
completed Friday morning, with second-round action as well on
Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Seven players were tied for second place at 70 _ Lee Janzen,
Bernhard Langer, Brad Fabel, Billy Mayfair, Len Mattiace, Joe Ozaki
and Kenny Perry. Meanwhile, Tiger Woods was just two strokes off
the lead at 71, tied with Tom Lehman, Justin Leonard, Craig Barlow
and Greg Chalmers. Omar Uresti was at two under par through 16
holes when play was suspended.
</P>
<P>
   With the wind gusting to 26 miles an hour, with heavy rough
lining the fairways, and with the greens fast enough to turn any
lengthy putt into a nightmare, the tournament looked and felt like
a major, and the scores resembled a U.S. Open. But Sutton squeezed
the most out of his round, like someone squeezing all the juice out
of an orange. After a bogey on the first hole, Sutton bounced back
with an eagle at No. 2, then he played smartly the rest of the day,
capitalizing on opportunities and minimizing the damage when he
made a mistake.
</P>
<P>
   But even for Sutton, the day was a constant test.
</P>
<P>
   ``The course was showing its teeth,'' said Sutton, after a round
that included four eagles, five birdies and four bogeys. ``You
couldn't go through without making some bogeys. So you needed to
make some birdies whenever you got the opportunity. That is what
makes this golf course so great. - When conditions get difficult on
a great golf course, you have to be smart enough to know where to
take those risks.''
</P>
<P>
   For many players, it was a day of high risk with no reward.
Nineteen players shot in the 80s, including Garcia, Stadler (83)
and Mickelson (83). David Duval, the defending champion, shot 75,
despite starting his day with two birdies. Duval made one only more
birdie, and his round also included six bogeys.
</P>
<P>
   That was still better than Stadler, who began to unravel in the
deep rough at the par-4 No. 12. First Stadler missed the ball
completely on an attempted pitch shot, then on his next shot, he
accidentally double-hit the ball, leading to a double bogey. Then
at No. 16, the rough got the best of Stadler again, when his
attempted pitch shot out of a buried lie traveled only about 5
feet. That ignited Stadler's legendary temper.
</P>
<P>
   He angrily took a hockey-like-slap shot swing at his next
attempt, and the ball rolled through the green and into the water,
resulting in another triple bogey.
</P>
<P>
   By the time Stadler reached No. 17, people were expecting a full
volcanic eruption if his tee shot found water. Fortunately,
Stadler's tee shot landed safely on the green, and he derisively
tipped his hat to the crowd. Stadler still three-putted for a
bogey, but at least he finished his round without breaking a club.
</P>
<P>
   ``I could have shot 90,'' Stadler said. ``Good thing I made some
putts early. It was a good day until I teed off.''
</P>
<P>
   Even Woods hit his 9-iron tee shot into the water at No. 17,
leading to a double bogey that cost him a share of the lead. Woods
went to the drop area after his penalty stroke, then hit his next
shot onto the green. His first putt at No. 17 from 60 feet rolled
10 feet past the hole, forcing Woods to make a 10-footer to save
double bogey.
</P>
<P>
   Rarely is Woods happy with a double bogey. Thursday was
different.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's no big deal making a double bogey under these
conditions,'' said Woods, who has only made two double bogeys all
year. ``That's why I wasn't upset at all when the ball went in the
water.'' &QL;

VIVIAN FINE, 86, COMPOSER FOR VOICE, ORCHESTRA AND BALLET 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Ill., Vt., N.Y.)   (bl)  
 By ALLAN KOZINN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Vivian Fine, a composer who wrote ballet scores for Martha
Graham and Jose Limon, as well as copious amounts of orchestral,
chamber and vocal music, died March 20 at the Southern Vermont
Medical Center in Bennington after an automobile accident. She was
86 and lived in Hoosick Falls, N.Y.
</P>
<P>
   Fine composed in a style that evolved gracefully over the years.
Her early works, with their expressive dissonance, inventive
counterpoint and sharp rhythmic edges, reflect both the influence
of her teacher, Roger Sessions, and the practical demands of
writing for modern dance groups. Later she developed a language in
which technical demands and a slightly acerbic sensibility were
balanced by wit and lyricism. By the late 1980s her shorter works
were being included regularly in recital and chamber programs.
</P>
<P>
   Fine was born in Chicago on Sept. 28, 1913, and began her
musical life as a piano prodigy. She won a scholarship to the
Chicago Musical College when she was 5. She later studied with
Djane Lavoie-Herz, a student of Scriabin. Her early composition
teachers included Ruth Crawford Seeger and Adolf Weidig. She moved
to New York in 1931, where she continued her piano studies with
Abby Whiteside and studied composition with Sessions.
</P>
<P>
   In the mid-1930s Fine worked as a rehearsal pianist for several
New York dance companies, and within a few years she was composing
for them as well. Among her early ballet scores are ``The Race of
Life'' (1937) for Doris Humphrey, ``Opus 51'' (1938) for Charles
Weidman and ``Tragic Exodus'' and ``They Too Are Exiles'' (both
1939) for Hanya Holm. She later wrote ``Alcestis'' (1960) for
Graham and ``My Son, My Enemy'' (1965) for Limon.
</P>
<P>
   Fine's symphonic works include ``Elegiac Song'' for muted
strings (1937) and ``Meeting for Equal Rights 1866,'' for soprano,
baritone, narrator and chorus (1976).
</P>
<P>
   As an active campaigner for American music, she helped found the
American Composers Alliance in 1938 and was its vice president from
1961 to 1965. She was also concerned with feminist issues. One of
her operas, ``The Women in the Garden'' (1978), includes among its
scenes a colloquy between Virginia Woolf, Isadora Duncan, Gertrude
Stein and Emily Dickinson, using quotations from their writings.
Her last major work, ``The Memoirs of Uliana Rooney'' (1994), was a
multimedia opera with a libretto by Sonya Friedman that followed a
female composer through the decades of the 20th century. The work
is partly autobiographical but alludes as well to Alma Mahler and
Ruth Crawford Seeger.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Fine was uneasy with the idea of defining composers by
their sex. ``I hope the term `woman composer' will be dropped
soon,'' she told an interviewer from The New York Times in 1989.
``I think we are in a better place than we were 20 years ago. Women
are accepted in literature, painting and sculpture. We don't talk
of `poetesses' anymore. And woman performers as soloists _ singers,
pianists, violinists _ have been accepted for a long time.''
</P>
<P>
   Fine taught composition at the Juilliard School, New York
University, the State University of New York at Potsdam and
Bennington College in Vermont.
</P>
<P>
   She is survived by a sister, Adelaide Fine of Shaftsbury, Vt.,
and two daughters, Peggy Karp of Berkeley, Calif., and Nina Karp of
North Bennington, Vt.

PURDUE FLEXES ITS MUSCLE, HANDLES GONZAGA
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By MIKE JONES 
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBUQUERQUE, N.M. _ Most would say that Purdue plays an ugly
brand of basketball. Its best player is perhaps more well-known for
his receding hairline and pugnacious attitude than his skills on
the court.
</P>
<P>
   But there are no style points in the NCAA Tournament. And say
what you will about the Purdue Boilermakers, they're still playing.
</P>
<P>
   The Boilermakers' defense took the flash out of Gonzaga's
3-point game and pounded the offensive glass to advance to
Saturday's West Region championship game by brushing aside the
Zags, 75-66, Thursday night before 16,004 in The Pit.
</P>
<P>
   Sixth-seeded Purdue moved into the Elite Eight for the first
time since 1994.
</P>
<P>
   ``We played with a lot of intensity,'' said Gene Keady, who is
one victory from coaching in his first Final Four in his 20th
season with the Boilermakers. ``We did the job on the boards and
just hung on.''
</P>
<P>
   The Boilermakers outrebounded Gonzaga 44-33 overall. They
snatched 20 misses off the offensive glass and converted them into
23 points and, at the same time, slammed the door on the Zags'
3-point attack. Gonzaga's tournament run was stopped one game shy
of a second consecutive appearance in the regional championship
game.
</P>
<P>
   ``Offensive rebounding has been one of our strengths all year
long,'' said Purdue forward Brian Cardinal, who led a group effort
with eight boards and 10 points. ``We know that we have an edge on
most teams. If we establish our rebounding game, it helps our total
offense and that helps our defense.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a great feeling. We've worked awfully hard to get to
where we are now. It's amazing to be only 40 minutes away from
going home to Indianapolis and, hopefully, we can do it. We can't
control whether our shots go in or not, but the one thing we can
control is how hard we play. And Saturday, one thing we'll do is
play as hard as we can.''
</P>
<P>
   Purdue shook off an early 10-0 run by the Zags and came from
13-10 down little more than six minutes into the game to a 30-17
lead with 5:03 to play in the half. Once the Boilermakers got the
lead, they held it through their tenacity on the glass and on the
perimeter.
</P>
<P>
   Gonzaga shot almost 45 percent from beyond the arc in tournament
victories against Louisville and St. John's. The Zags converted
only 5 of 20 3-point attempts Thursday night, and Purdue matched
that while limiting Zags guards Matt Santangelo (1-for-7) and
Richie Frahm (1-for-6) to 2-for-13 shooting from long distance.
</P>
<P>
   ``They do it so much differently than most teams,'' Santangelo
said. ``They're not like St. John's, who forces you into 30
turnovers and beats you by 40. They rebound the heck out of it and
contest every shot you take and beat you by 10 or 12. From a
physical standpoint, that is as good a defense as we've seen all
year.''
</P>
<P>
   Gonzaga did make things interesting after falling behind 56-39
some 11 minutes into the second half. The Zags came to 61-53 after
an 8-0 run with 3:37 remaining, but Purdue ran off six unanswered
points.
</P>
<P>
   ``Well, it was one heck of a ride once again,'' Gonzaga coach
Mark Few said. ``This group never ceases to amaze me (with) what
they are able to accomplish. If you'd told us at the start of they
year we'd be sitting here after losing a game in the Sweet 16, most
people would not have believed it.
</P>
<P>
   ``We lost to very good basketball team tonight. We talked about
being the most physical team and for one reason we just didn't get
it done. We ran off seven or eight wins in row where we
outrebounded our opponent decisively, but tonight they really
handed it to us.'' nn

STATE DEPT. PURSUES INQUIRY OF GORE CAMPAIGN CHAIRMAN
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Calif.)   (rk) 
 By DON VAN NATTA Jr.   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The State Department is pursuing an investigation
of Tony Coelho, Vice President Al Gore's campaign chairman, after
an inquiry found questionable spending by U.S. participants in the
1998 World Exposition in Portugal, a project Coelho championed, his
lawyer and others said today.
</P>
<P>
   The lawyer, Stanley Brand, said in an interview that Coelho, a
former Democratic congressman from California, had received a
subpoena from the State Department's inspector general late last
year and had responded with a written statement and other
documents.
</P>
<P>
   An initial report by the inspector general, Jacquelyn L.
Williams-Bridgers, last fall found that U.S. officials involved in
the U.S. exhibition at the fair may have violated federal rules by
hiring Coelho's niece and that a Portuguese bank made a personal
loan of $300,000 to Coelho for a private foundation to build a
memorial at the fair.
</P>
<P>
   Brand said that the investigation had continued in the months
since the report.
</P>
<P>
   If investigators for the inspector general found evidence of
wrongdoing, the investigation would normally be handed over to the
Justice Department for possible criminal prosecution.
</P>
<P>
   Details of the continuing investigation were first disclosed
Thursday by The National Journal. A spokeswoman for the inspector
general's office, Linda Topping, would not comment on the status of
the investigation.
</P>
<P>
   Coelho, who is of Portuguese descent, has been accused by the
Center for Public Integrity, a public watchdog group, of using his
connections on Capitol Hill and in the administration to get
taxpayer money to finance much of the U.S. participation in the
World Exposition in Lisbon, known as Expo 98.
</P>
<P>
   The questions about Coelho have dogged Gore's presidential
campaign. But the vice president had repeatedly stood by his
campaign manager, describing the issue as ``inside baseball'' of
little interest to voters. Chris Lehane, Gore's campaign spokesman,
referred calls on the issue Thursday to Brand.
</P>
<P>
   The inspector general's original report cited mismanagement by
the U.S. Information Agency, which oversaw U.S. participation in
the fair in Lisbon, its contractors and Coelho. U.S. organizers for
Expo 98 had hoped to obtain significant private contributions. But
the report estimated that 80 percent of the cost of U.S.
participation came from government money. The total cost may have
exceeded $10 million.

PALMER SAYS HE'LL STAY A TROJAN
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By SCOTT WOLF  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ USC quarterback Carson Palmer will begin his third
year of college next fall, but he stressed Thursday that nothing
could cause him to turn pro following the 2000 season.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'll be here for sure,'' said Palmer. ``I want to play college
football as much as possible. It's the chance of a lifetime.''
</P>
<P>
   Palmer said even if the Trojans exceeded expectations this
season, it would not affect his decision to remain in school.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'll still have two years (of eligibility) left,'' Palmer
said. ``I'm not thinking about anything else except playing college
football.''
</P>
<P>
   Palmer will be a sophomore in eligibility next season, after
redshirting following a broken collarbone in the third game of the
season against Oregon. Even after he announced last November that
he would redshirt, there was speculation he would leave USC after
one season to enter the NFL draft.
</P>
<P>
   ``No,'' Palmer said. ``I'm enjoying college football.''
</P>
<P>
   So far in spring drills, Palmer is just about where USC coach
Paul Hackett expected of someone who hasn't played since September.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think he's rusty,'' Hackett said. ``He's herky-jerky. I
don't think he's smooth, but did you see his long pass to Kareem
Kelly?''
</P>
<P>
   __ Secondary shuffle: It's too soon to say what will happen with
USC's secondary. Junior college transfer Chris Cash has been
impressive and it was assumed that junior Kris Richard would move
to free safety next season, so Cash could start at cornerback.
</P>
<P>
   But Richard has probably been the best cornerback in the first
three practices, and Hackett wants to hold off making a decision as
long as possible.
</P>
<P>
   Among the newcomers, however, Cash has made the quickest impact.
</P>
<P>
   ``Without pads so far, the best surprise has been where Chris
Cash is,'' Hackett said. ``Probably, at some point, somebody will
have to move. I don't know. Maybe it will become obvious.''
</P>
<P>
   Richard, who started last season at cornerback, hopes to remain
at the position.
</P>
<P>
   ``I definitely prefer to stay at corner,'' he said. ``(Changing
positions) was mentioned to me. But I'll play wherever I'm
needed.''
</P>
<P>
   __ Denmon hurt: Center Eric Denmon suffered a concussion last
week in a car accident. He will be out at least a week. In his
absence, freshman Lenny Vandermade is the No. 1 center, and
freshman Norm Katnik is also working at the position. Hackett said
guard Trevor Roberts might also work at center.
</P>
<P>
   The Trojans will have more depth in the fall, when Carlos Acosta
of Moorpark College joins the team.
</P>
<P>
   __ Who's No. 1? One position Hackett is watching closely this
spring is tailback, where Sultan McCullough and Malaefou MacKenzie
are getting most of the practice time. Freshman Chris Howard
doesn't arrive until the fall, and senior Petros Papadakis is
recovering from a broken foot.
</P>
<P>
   ``Malaefou and Sultan will be in quite a battle for the next 13

 McCAIN TO CAMPAIGN AGAIN, THIS TIME TO SUPPORT GIULIANI  
 (bl)  
 By ADAM NAGOURNEY   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Sen. John McCain has yet to announce whether he will
endorse Texas Gov. George W. Bush for president now that he has
abandoned his own campaign. But the Arizona Republican is
displaying no such reticence when it comes to New York's U.S.
Senate race. Aides to McCain and New York City Mayor Rudolph
Giuliani said Thursday that they were negotiating the final details
of a swing by McCain on behalf of Giuliani in the next few weeks.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are committed to doing it,'' said Todd Harris, a spokesman
for McCain. ``We want to go up there and show our strong support
for Mr. Giuliani as a candidate.''
</P>
<P>
   Giuliani's campaign manager, Bruce J. Teitelbaum, said the mayor
embraced the prospect of campaigning with McCain at his side. ``The
mayor welcomes John McCain's support,'' Teitelbaum said.
</P>
<P>
   There is reason to believe that Giuliani may be more
enthusiastic at the prospect of campaigning with McCain than with
Bush. The mayor kept a distance from Bush during the Republican
primary contest in New York and was critical of the hard-edged
tactics he used to defeat McCain in the state.
</P>
<P>
   By contrast, Giuliani, who endorsed Bush, described McCain as a
friend and praised his campaign during the primary. His ability to
present himself as one of Bush's supporters without joining in the
attacks on McCain paved the way for the visit.
</P>
<P>
   In the Republican primaries, McCain appealed to independent and
some Democratic voters, almost precisely the same voters Giuliani
is pursuing in his contest with Hillary Rodham Clinton, his
Democratic opponent. In New York, McCain was popular among
Republicans as well: he received 44 percent of the votes cast for
delegates in the March 7 primary.
</P>
<P>
   Details of the trip remain to be worked out, though aides to
McCain and the mayor said McCain would be likely to campaign with
Giuliani mainly in New York City and the suburbs, where he proved
particularly popular.
</P>
<P>
   ``We will do whatever he asks us to do, except raise soft
money,'' Harris said, referring to the largely unregulated source
of campaign contributions that McCain has proposed outlawing. Both
Giuliani and Clinton have been aggressively seeking those
contributions.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever benefit the visit brings Giuliani, it will be something
short of a happy return for McCain. He dropped out of the race two
days after the Super Tuesday primaries, which included contests in
New York and California.
</P>
<P>
   McCain lost 9 of 13 states that day, though he has singled out
the campaign run against him in New York as the most unfair. It
included a Bush radio advertisement that portrayed McCain as an
opponent of financing for breast cancer research and a television
advertisement financed by a Bush supporter that attacked his
environmental record.
</P>
<P>
   Harris said McCain's relationship with Giuliani outweighed any
bad feelings he had about New York. ``McCain is a strong supporter
of the mayor,'' he said, adding, ``he looks forward to the mayor
joining him in the United States Senate.''

<P>
   DALLAS _ The Dallas Mavericks put themselves in another hole
Thursday night.
</P>
<P>
   But unlike Tuesday night when the Mavericks rallied from a
double-digit deficit to claim a victory, Cleveland was able to
withstand any comebacks from the Mavericks in a 104-98 victory.
</P>
<P>
   It was a poor first-half performance that doomed the Mavericks
against the Cavaliers.
</P>
<P>
   The Mavericks shot 31 percent from the field, missed all eight
of their 3-point attempts, and committed 10 turnovers for the half.
</P>
<P>
   The first quarter might have been a sign of things to come, when
the Mavericks scored a season-low 14 points.
</P>
<P>
   ``We dug ourselves a hole,'' said Mavericks center Shawn
Bradley, who scored eight points. ``You can't expect to do that
every night and come back to win.''
</P>
<P>
   The Mavericks trailed by 23 points at halftime and many of those
in the crowd of 13,043 at Reunion Arena booed the team as it walked
off the floor.
</P>
<P>
   But the Mavericks made a rally in the second half by outscoring
Cleveland 65-48, and cut the Cavaliers lead to six points after a
3-pointer from Dirk Nowitzki late in the fourth quarter.
</P>
<P>
   Two free throws from Cedric Henderson with 1:07 left pushed
Cleveland to a 101-93 lead.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's very disappointing,'' Mavericks guard Steve Nash said.
``I think we have a pretty proud group. For us to come out and play
like that in the first half was terrible. We were awful and we
deserved what we got, and that was a loss. We certainly didn't
deserve to win the way we played in the first half.''
</P>
<P>
   The only bright spot was Michael Finley's 29 points, but he
missed 10 shots.
</P>
<P>
   The comeback was spirited if anything else, especially when the
Mavericks fought back from a 22-point deficit to beat San Antonio,
97-96, on a buzzer- beating basket from Erick Strickland on Tuesday
night.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't have an answer for you,'' Mavericks coach Don Nelson
said. ``We didn't come out the way we were supposed to. I suppose
its human nature after an emotional win like that. It was hard to
get it cranked up.''
</P>
<P>
   In the Mavericks' past four games against teams with losing
records, they have lost three times.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday night against the Cavaliers, the Mavericks were beaten
inside and outside.
</P>
<P>
   The Cavaliers scored 52 points inside and outrebounded the
Mavericks, 52-44.
</P>
<P>
   ``Cleveland moved the ball very well,'' Mavericks forward Sean
Rooks said. ``They ran their plays and executed, Brevin (Knight)
got to the inside and caused problems. If they weren't scoring,
they were getting offensive rebounds.''
</P>
<P>
   Knight had 12 points and 11 assists.
</P>
<P>
   Shawn Kemp scored 22 points and grabbed 12 rebounds. Henderson
came off the bench and added 15 points as Cleveland made 48 percent
of its shots.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everything was pretty bad,'' Nowitzki said. ``We didn't
execute very well; we only had 33 points in the first half. That's
terrible. It was one of our worst games.'' nn

`POKEMON' POWER HITS THE SHELVES 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  (Eds.: An accent mark is needed over e in Pokemon) 
 
By BRUCE WESTBROOK 
c. 2000 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   `POKEMON: THE FIRST MOVIE'
</P>
<P>
   How long before the Pokemon craze goes the way of the Teenage
Mutant Ninja Turtles or Tiffany?
</P>
<P>
   The verdict is still out. But for now the Japanese ``pocket
monsters'' rule, and Warner is banking on their first film being a
top-selling video.
</P>
<P>
   The animated fantasy made a respectable $87 million in theaters
last fall, but video should be the real gold mine if just a
fraction of kids who paid $4-$5 per ticket shell out up to $26.98
for videos.
</P>
<P>
   Then another Pokemon movie will invade us from Japan during the
summer.
</P>
<P>
   New tapes and DVDs offer sneak previews of it, along with an
exclusive new Mewtwo game card from Wizards of the Coast. They also
have the shorts ``The Story of Mewtwo's Origin'' and ``Pikachu's
Vacation,'' which preceded the movie in theaters.
</P>
<P>
   DVDs also have the first film's theatrical trailer, a music
video for M2M's ``Don't Say You Love Me,'' an instructional feature
on playing Nintendo's Pokemon Stadium Game and commentary by the
film's director and producer.
</P>
<P>
   That's not to mention such DVD-ROM features as game guides and
Internet archives.
</P>
<P>
   VHS buyers won't get any of that, but they can look for one of
five ``Golden Tickets'' inserted randomly into the tape boxes.
</P>
<P>
   Find one, and a kid can score a trip for two to Japan, a meeting
with Pokemon's creators, a $1,000 Pokemon Center shopping spree and
a first-edition starter set of Team Rocket game cards.
</P>
<P>
   Does life get any better?
</P>
<P>
   That depends on whom you ask. Pokemon mania is like a kids'
clubhouse with the hand-painted sign ``No grown-ups allowed.'' This
is not for adults, but then, it's not meant to be.
</P>
<P>
   Rather, it taps into the most consistent kid appeal in popular
culture since the '30s origin of Superman: adolescent power
fantasies.
</P>
<P>
   Pokemon's kid heroes for television and film don't wield much
power of their own. Rather, they fight by proxy with cutesy little
fire-breathers and energy-wielders springing from tiny pocket-size
orbs.
</P>
<P>
   In ``First Movie,'' Pokemon masters Ash, Misty and Brock _ who
seem to be on an eternal camping trip _ visit an island in search
of still more power battles. There, they tangle with the cloned
Mewtwo, a bitter, whining Pokemon, and hear sermonettes about
self-reliance and brotherhood.
</P>
<P>
   It's kind of like the old Billy Jack movies, which preached
tolerance and nonviolence while wallowing in good, old-fashioned
rump-kicking.
</P>
<P>
   The animation is far from Disney quality, but it does have a
trippy playfulness. As in much Japanese anime, weird creatures
sprout writhing tentacles, and humans have huge eyes.
</P>
<P>
   So will many kids when they find this in stores.
</P>

`THE ABYSS SPECIAL EDITION' &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Years before he made ``Titanic,'' director James Cameron got his
feet wet with another watery movie, and it's back on video this
week with ``The Abyss Special Edition.''
</P>
<P>
   For the first time on tape, you can see an extra 28 minutes of
scenes, making ``The Abyss'' a 171-minute epic.
</P>
<P>
   DVD, of course, offers much more. You don't just watch this
film: You study it, via 440 minutes of video and almost 6,000
screens of stills, story boards and text about cast, crew, script,
set construction and other stages of the creative process.
</P>
<P>
   Cameron made this shoot both wildly ambitious and notoriously
rigorous, but he got the job done.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Abyss'' is slick yet real, fanciful yet gripping, and
truly an eye-popping adventure, as a deep-sea crew (led by Ed
Harris) goes to rescue a crashed sub and makes an amazing
discovery.
</P>
<P>
   A supplemental disc features two making-of documentaries (one 10
minutes, the other an hour _ which VHS consumers can purchase by
mail); three ``Abyss'' trailers; detailed cast profiles and studies
of sets and hardware; and hype about how the film is about human
interaction, not special effects.
</P>
<P>
   The other disc includes the original 143-minute cut, as well as
the expanded edition, with extra scenes identified (but not
readily) in chapter-stop descriptions.
</P>
<P>
   Most DVD extras have been on laserdisc, but not all. New
elements include a 20-minute Academy Award special-effects reel,
pitched to Oscar voters, who then gave the film an award for best
visual effects.
</P>
<P>
   DVDs also have three new DVD-ROM games and a computer-animated
``drill room'' for exploring various features.

IOWA STATE AND FIZER ARE JUST TOO STRONG FOR UCLA
</HEADLINE>
   (rk) 
 By JOE DRAPE   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUBURN HILLS, Mich. _ UCLA was deep, athletic, winners of eight
games in a row and supposed to be the hottest team in the
tournament. What about Iowa State? They were the Big 12 regular
season and tournament champions, had a starting five short of star
power and was the No. 2 seed nobody knew much about.
</P>
<P>
   But after an 80-56 victory _ their 10th in a row, the Cyclones
are the hottest team in the tournament. They play hard, they play
ugly and now they play a team a lot like them, Michigan State, in
the final of the Midwest Regional here at The Palace on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   For every stunning lob pass the Bruins threw halfway down the
court, the Cyclones answered with three easy layups as they mocked
UCLA's full-court pass.
</P>
<P>
   Behind back-to-back 3-pointers by Michael Nurse, the Cyclones
tossed off a 10-3 run that appeared to put the No. 2 seed in firm
control with a 17-point lead, 50-33. But free throws and Jerome
Moise helped the Bruins scratch back into the game. The center had
11 of the Bruins first 15 points in the second half as UCLA made 6
of 7 free throws to cut Iowa State's lead to 54-43 with 11 minutes
left.
</P>
<P>
   The reason the Bruins even got that close was because Iowa
State's all-American Marcus Fizer was on the bench with three
fouls. Once he came back, the Bruins never got closer as the best
player know one ever heard of finished with 16 points.
</P>
<P>
   The Cyclones pounded their way to a 40-28 halftime lead by
bullying the deeper more than athletic Bruins. Iowa State's
backcourt of Nurse and Jamaal Tinsley hounded UCLA's Earl Watson
and never let him get the Bruins in the running rhythm that
decimated Maryland, 105-70. Against the Terrapins, the Bruins shot
62 percent as Watson dished out a school record 16 assists and was
5 of 6 from the 3-point line.
</P>
<P>
   Watson, who had laser surgery Monday for a punctured retina in
his left eye, was merely human early against Iowa State. He had
eight points and three assists, but instead of highlight-friendly
alley-oop passes, he was forced to punch the ball inside to the
6-foot-10-inch tandem of Jerome Moiso and Dan Gadzuric. The pair,
however, fumbled the ball _ Moiso had four turnovers _ and were
moved around like chess pieces by the 6-8, 265-pound Fizer.
</P>
<P>
   The Iowa State all-American pulled down seven rebounds and
scored 10 points in the first half, but just as impressively kicked
the ball out to Tinsley, who was 5 of 10 from the field and led the
Cyclones with 13 first-half points.

CYCLONES START QUICKLY, ROAR PAST BRUINS

 STATE-UCLA-TEX (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By WHIT CANNING 
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUBURN HILLS, Mich. _ Explaining the primary method through
which UCLA had come down the stretch with eight consecutive
victories and an improbable berth in the NCAA Tournament, Bruins
forward Sean Farnham laid out an intriguing plan.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're able to play several different games, at different
speeds,'' he said. ``It's very confusing to our opponents, because
we can adjust to whatever they're doing _ we can run the court,
take it inside, or slow it down and play half-court and shoot
threes. The other team usually has trouble adjusting and has to
alter its game plan.''
</P>
<P>
   To which, super Cyclone Marcus Fizer offered a succinct
rejoinder: ``We don't change our game plan for anyone ... not UCLA,
not the Los Angeles Lakers. We make teams change their plan.''
</P>
<P>
   Fizer's method prevailed easily Thursday night at The Palace, as
the second-seeded Cyclones (32-4) rolled to an 80-56 victory,
setting up a championship battle between top seeds at 6 p.m.
Saturday with Michigan State, which defeated Syracuse earlier in
the evening.
</P>
<P>
   Each time the Bruins (21-12) tried to shift gears, they veered
off the freeway. Iowa State assumed command with a 40-28 halftime
lead, and UCLA seldom managed to get any closer during a ragged
second half.
</P>
<P>
   ``Well, when you've won 31 games coming in, it probably means
you're doing something right,'' UCLA coach Steve Lavin said. ``They
are a very talented team that is having an awesome season, and they
are playing very well.''
</P>
<P>
   The Bruins, whose season was barely above .500 a month ago,
seemed rejuvenated down the stretch with the return of forward
JaRon Rush, who sat out most of the season under NCAA mandate. When
he returned, he hit a clutch last-second shot to beat Stanford, and
UCLA had came in at 8-0 with Rush in the starting lineup.
</P>
<P>
   But legendary coach John Wooden couldn't have saved this one for
the Bruins, who were rolled under by 46 per-cent shooting by the
Cyclones in the first half and achieved little in the comeback
attempt beyond accumulated a large collection of fouls.
</P>
<P>
   A 3-pointer from Michael Nurse and a bucket by Fizer stretched
the lead to 15 early in the second half, and the Cyclones coasted
home.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're a dangerous team that can hurt you in a lot of ways,''
said ISU coach Larry Eustachy, who grew up in Los Angeles, once
aspired to be a Bruin, and said earlier in the week he thought UCLA
was ``playing the best ball of anyone left in the tournament.''
</P>
<P>
   That designation might now fall to the Cyclones, who won easily
in the opening Sweet 16 round while top-seeded Michigan State
struggled.

   Matt Vasgersian, the host of the new Fox Sports Net game show
``Sports Geniuses,'' tapped his pen on the table as he pondered a
question that he went back to try to answer again.
</P>
<P>
   __ In 1977, first-round draft pick Ricky Bell was joined in the
Tampa Bay backfield by what fellow USC tailback?
</P>
<P>
   ``Man, I should know that,'' said Vasgersian, a 32-year-old
Trojans alumnus.
</P>
<P>
   He took a few more moments, and the name finally popped into his
head.
</P>
<P>
   Who was it? Take the quiz of sample questions from the show
yourself (see the graphic box) before peeking at the answers.
</P>
<P>
   Ain't so easy, is it?
</P>
<P>
   Vasgersian, the current TV play-by-play voice for the Milwaukee
Brewers, got better than half, and admitted that on a similar
20-question quiz given to potential contestants, he came up with 11
right which is the cutoff when you're asked back for an interview.
</P>
<P>
   No disrespect to him or co-host Lisa Guerrero, the KTTV Channel
11 sportscaster whose tight-fitted athetic gear poses a definite
distraction to the players, but when the show debuts Monday at 6
and 11 p.m., the mind-bending questions could be the main
attraction.
</P>
<P>
   In the short history of game shows geared toward
sports-unconscious viewers, few have really combined the challenge
and play-along entertainment that this one promises.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're a completely different target audience, like the
difference between those who like Trivial Pursuit and magnetic
football games,'' said Vasgersian, asked if this is just another
attempt at a network trying to capture some of the
game-show-revival fever going around.
</P>
<P>
   Fox's previous try at sports game shows, ``The Ultimate Fans
League,'' turned out to be minor league. ESPN has made several
attempts, including one hosted by Chris Berman called ``Boardwalk
and Baseball'' back in the '80s that had a decent run, and the
network has another in the planning stages. But between those and
Dick Enberg's campy ``Sports Challenge'' that originally aired in
the late '60s and now runs daily on ESPN Classic, the sports quiz
show genre hasn't been able to maintain momentum.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of networks get on the game-show bandwagon but fall off
because they forget the golden rule, which is the play-along
factor,'' said ``Sports Geniuses'' executive producer Gregg
Sherman. ``I'm not a sports genius, but I have a good sense and
when I'm editing the tapes of the shows, I'm shouting out the
answers and my wife doesn't understand it. `You already saw the
show,' she says.
</P>
<P>
   ``Well, you just become driven to play along.''
</P>
<P>
   Sherman, who once worked on the Comedy Central hit ``Win Ben
Stein's Money,'' wants the comedic twist of that series combined
with the strategy and intensity of ``Jeopardy!'' to drive this
three-segment show that also includes an Internet player element.
The format works, climaxing with the faceoff between the top two
contestants who volley answers to a question such as ``Name a
member of baseball's 500 home run club'' until someone is stumped.
</P>
<P>
   The series recently finished taping 65 episodes that will run
through June (ending in a nine-player championship week). Each show
also has a sports celebrity guest who asks questions. And for a
program that couldn't possibly pitch the celebs by its reputation,
it attracted a great number of big names, including Pete Rose, Cal
Ripken Jr., Carl Lewis, Sugar Ray Leonard, Kareem Abdul-Jabbar,
Nadia Comaneci and Bart Conner.
</P>
<P>
   As for prizes: Winners get weekend vacations, runners-up get
flat-screen TVs and La-Z-Boy chairs.
</P>
<P>
   The attitude for the show starts with the title, which Sherman
admits is an oxymoron, and continues with the wisecracking
Vasgersian.
</P>
<P>
   ``We considered the name `Sports Geeks' but thought it would be
more fun to make it reverential when, all in all, it's for guys
with way too much time on their hands,'' he said. ``The show backs
up that smarmy attitude with the category titles.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Sports Studs'' might be the title Vasgersian would go with.
</P>
<P>
   In the same league with Joe Buck, Chip Caray and Thom Brennenam
as the future stars of sportscasting, Vasgersian admits he always
wanted to host a game show since he was a kid actor with his SAG
card. He sorta got that when he hosted ``Toughman World
Championship'' boxing series with Lawrence Taylor for FX, although
that probably falls under the category as a show that just smelled
a little too gamy.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wanted something like Mark DeCarlo had with a dating show,''
said Vasgersian, who admits to once being a contestant on ``The
Dating Game'' and ``Supermarket Sweeps.''
</P>
<P>
   As viewers get hooked on this and start planning their days
around it, Vasgersian will have his wish. &QL;

</P>
<P>
   __ Rick DeReyes' fantasy continues. Once upon a time, the KABC
Channel 7 weatherman gave up that comfortable job to pursue a
play-by-play career for the Single-A Lancaster JetHawks. Three
years later, he's been hired by the Dodgers' Triple-A Albuquerque
affiliate for the 2000 season. ``To get there this quickly, it's
now beyond my comprehension
</P>
<P>
   I'm just overwhelmed,'' said the 43-year-old. ``The only place
tougher to get than Triple-A is the majors.'' Even if this gig
could only last a year, DeReyes has jumped at it. A group from
Portland, Ore., just bought the franchise and plans to move it to
the Northwest for 2001, at which time the Dodgers might also break
ties and try to hook up with Las Vegas.
</P>
<P>
   __ Cut me, Teddy . . . and cut to commercial. On ESPN2's
``Friday Night Fights'' (tonight at 6 p.m.), trainer/analyst Teddy
Atlas plays both roles to give viewers a rare insight into what
goes into to prepping a boxer on fight night as well as in the
ring. On the card at the Blue Horizon in Philadelphia, Atlas will
do the night's first and third fights with Bob Papa at ringside,
but when Atlas leaves for the locker room to get Elviro Muriqui
ready for his six-round light-heavyweight bout, the cameras follow.
Atlas will wear a headset and mike during the fight, giving
instructions to Muriqui as well as giving viewers his insight.
``There will be a risk here . . . but I will be honest in my
assessment with my fighter and for the viewers,'' said Atlas.
</P>
<P>
   __ A classic blast in Seattle. The implosion of the Kingdome on
Sunday at 8 a.m. will have live coverage on ESPN Classic as well as
be available in glorious 3D on a Web sites called www.isee3d.com or
www.windowsmedia.com. The blue-and-red paper glasses can be used,
or there's a plug-in to download.
</P>
<P>
   __ NBC's coverage of The Players Championship plans to include,
for the first time on network TV golf coverage, global positioning
satellites to give viewers more precise yardage information on
holes 11, 13, 16 and 17. We told ya all those gizmos they use down
at the Pentagon would become useful someday. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
WHAT CHOKES &QL;
</P>
<P>
   __ Dan Marino's agent has already been peddling the former Miami
Dolphins quarterback around to the networks as a possible game
analyst. Fox and CBS have told him their broadcast rosters are full
enough of cliche-spewing, pretty-boy, recently retired gridders.
Marino's target is a package deal for ABC's ``Monday Night
Football'' with his ex-coach Jimmy Johnson.
</P>
<P>
   __ And did ya hear the one about Rush Limbaugh being on ABC's
short list of possible Al Michaels sidekicks? Neither did he until
Tomm Looney mentioned it this week on his Web site,
radiodigest.com. But at this point, ABC might was well consider
changing to a Rush-oriented game plan.

BELTRE AGREES TO THREE-YEAR CONTRACT
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BRIAN DOHN  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   VERO BEACH, Fla. _ With the start of the regular season just 11
days away, the Dodgers avoided a messy situation Thursday by
agreeing to a three-year, $5.05 million deal with Adrian Beltre.
</P>
<P>
   And for the first time in five months, the Dodgers' third-base
situation is settled.
</P>
<P>
   The deal _ which will keep Beltre in a Dodgers uniform for the
next five years _ wipes out the $330,000 contract Beltre had this
season. Instead, Beltre _ who gets a $1.5 million signing bonus _
will make $500,000 this season and $750,000 next year. Beltre is
guaranteed $2.3 million in 2002, but a provision allows him to void
that year if he has 800 total plate appearances during the 2000 and
2001 seasons or he has 400 plate appearances in 2001.
</P>
<P>
   Then, Beltre can take the Dodgers to salary arbitration before
the 2002 season. He will be eligible for salary arbitration for
2003 and 2004 and be eligible for free agency after the 2004
season.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Dodgers for the last five months had a cloud over (them)
about who's our third baseman,'' said Dodgers managing partner and
CEO Bob Daly. ``This was the right way to settle this. This is not
a three-year deal, it's a five-year deal because he's committed to
the Dodgers for five years. The down side was we could have lost
him.''
</P>
<P>
   Now, peace of mind exists for everyone involved, especially
Beltre. Commissioner Bud Selig ruled in December the Dodgers signed
Beltre before his 16th birthday in 1994 and fraudulently altered
documents to make the signing appear legal under baseball rules.
</P>
<P>
   But Selig declined Beltre's request that he be made a free
agent. Subsequently, the Major League Baseball Players Association
filed a grievance _ which was to be heard by an arbitrator _ over
Selig's ruling.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was a little anxious because I wanted it to be over with,
but it takes time,'' said the 20-year-old Beltre. ``I appreciate
they want me here. They showed respect to me. I spoke with Daly and
he showed me he's a great man.''
</P>
<P>
   At times, Beltre became frustrated about the slowness of the
process, though the Dodgers said they were impressed with Beltre's
conduct throughout. Scott Boras, Beltre's agent, and Daly met 18
times to resolve the dispute. The final time was late Wednesday
night, and in the early hours of the morning it was settled.
</P>
<P>
   ``We got a sense of security and Bob didn't have to pay market
value prior to performance,'' Boras said. ``We thought Adrian could
make $8 million in this deal, and the way he can make it is if he
performs like we think he's going to perform.''
</P>
<P>
   Both sides said it was difficult projecting what Beltre would be
worth in his first arbitration year. That projection was made more
difficult because Beltre has only one full season at the major-
league level. Beltre hit .275 with 15 homers and 67 RBI last
season. He's batting .238 with three homers and five RBI this
spring.
</P>
<P>
   Another concern was how Major League Baseball would react to the
contract, and enormous pressure was put on the Dodgers not to
overspend and change the pay structure for players in the second
and third year of service. A baseball official said MLB should be
pleased with this contract.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a relief for me,'' said Dodgers manager Davey Johnson,
``and I know it is for Adrian and the rest of the team. Now, maybe
we can start concentrating on some more important goals and getting
our act together.''
</P>
<P>
   The end of the dispute also means sanctions levied by Major
League Baseball against the Dodgers begin. Selig fined the Dodgers
$50,000, ordered the team to close its Campo Las Palmas training
facility in the Dominican Republic for one year, forbade them to
sign any player residing in the Dominican Republic for one year and
ordered the team to pay Beltre $49,500 in punitive damages.
</P>
<P>
   The money the club owes Beltre is wiped out by the signing, but
the rest of the sanctions remain. Club officials said the team is
waiting for baseball to set a date when Campo Las Palmas must be
closed. The Dodgers have asked baseball to reverse its ruling on
closing the facility, but that's considered a long shot, so the
club has made plans for players to train elsewhere in the country.
</P>
<P>
   Also, because of the signing, the Dodgers designated backup
Kevin Orie for assignment.

WISCONSIN'S DEFENSE SMOTHERS LSU
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By MIKE JONES 
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBUQUERQUE, N.M. _ The temperature has been unseasonably chilly
this week in the valley west of the Sandia Mountains, where it
snowed off and on for two days before play began in the West Region
semifinals.
</P>
<P>
   Big Ten weather.
</P>
<P>
   So, it was entirely fitting that Wisconsin joined conference
partner Purdue in Saturday's West championship game by bumping off
No. 4 seed Louisiana State, 61-48, Thursday night. The Badgers'
defense and patient offense proved more stout than the Tigers'
obvious talent edge.
</P>
<P>
   The eighth-seeded Badgers, who finished sixth in the Big Ten
race, can now add their first appearance in the Elite Eight to
their initial advance into the round of Sweet 16. Wisconsin
previously defeated No. 9 Fresno State and top-seeded Arizona.
</P>
<P>
   Wisconsin took charge late in the first half and held off the
explosive Tigers, who made a late run but couldn't get over the
hump.
</P>
<P>
   Whether confounded by the Badgers' persistent defense or just
not sharp, LSU committed 14 turnovers and made only 33 percent of
its shots in the first half and trailed at the break, 22-14.
Compounding a poor shooting percentage, the Tigers only got off 15
shots _ half as many as Wisconsin, who also shot poorly by making
only nine. Both teams shot eight treys, Wisconsin's two converts
twice as many as LSU's.
</P>
<P>
   Smith (one) and Swift (two) combined for only three shots in a
half played at the Badgers' pace. LSU surrendered the ball without
a shot on six of their final eight possessions of the half and did
not score in the last five minutes.
</P>
<P>
   The Tigers were up 14-11 when Lamont Roland hit one of two free
throws at 5:03. Wisconsin scored 11 consecutive points, including a
driving layup by Julian Swartz five seconds before the halftime
buzzer.
</P>
<P>
   Wisconsin opened the second half by pushing to a 31-18 lead by
the first television timeout at 15:58. Maurice Linton scored the
first two buckets on an 18-foot jumper and an inside follow jam on
a feed from Mark Vershaw. LSU hit inside and then Jon Bryant nailed
a trey and came back for a steal and breakaway layup.
</P>
<P>
   The Badgers completed a 10-0 run as Linton hit another jumper
and Duany Duany dropped in a three at 13:46 for a 36-18 Wisconsin
edge. After a two-for-one free throw exchange, UW posted its
biggest lead of 38-19 with 12:21 to play.
</P>
<P>
   Jabari Smith then sparked an LSU awakening, scoring nine of 12
points as the Tigers got to 40-29. But Bryant hit a 15-footer,
Vershaw popped a trey and Charlie Wills scored inside on Bryant's
pass to put Wisconsin back up 47-29 with five minutes remaining. nn

MANY FACTORS CONSIDERED IN YOUTH'S MURDER AND FATHER'S SUICIDE 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By DAVID M. HERSZENHORN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ From the Social Security number written in black
marker on a human skull found Tuesday in Alley Pond Park in Queens,
detectives had little trouble concluding that 19-year-old Steen
Fenrich had fallen victim to a twisted murderer.
</P>
<P>
   But when the young man's stepfather shot himself to death
Wednesday after an eight-hour standoff in Dix Hills, police were
left with an even grimmer realization about who might have
committed the murder and why.
</P>
<P>
   Before dawn Wednesday, shortly after police told the stepfather,
John D. Fenrich, that they had found his stepson's body, he picked
up the phone and called News 12, the Long Island television
station, to suggest a motive. He said he wanted to discuss ``his
stepson's dismembered body that was found in a Queens park,'' News
12 said, and suggested that he was ``murdered because he was gay.''
</P>
<P>
   That may well have been the reason, investigators said Thursday,
and Fenrich could have been the one to know because several signs
point to his role in the crime.
</P>
<P>
   After the phone conversation with News 12, Fenrich met with
police officers who came to his home after being alerted by the
station, then bolted onto his roof, fired guns in the air, begged
officers to shoot him and eight hours later, shot himself to death.
</P>
<P>
   As detectives in Queens continued to piece together the events
leading to the rooftop suicide, officials cautioned that while
dental records confirmed that the bones in the park belonged to
Steen Fenrich, the medical examiner still had not been able to
determine the cause of death. Until then, the case cannot be
classified as a homicide, though officers are assuming that will
happen.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is being investigated as a homicide and every angle is
being investigated and every part of his life is being looked
into,'' said Deputy Chief Patrick Timlin, commander of Queens
detectives. Among the possible reasons, he said, ``bias would be
one of the motivating factors.'' Chief Timlin suggested that
Fenrich had a fractious relationship with his stepson, but would
not elaborate.
</P>
<P>
   During its evening news broadcast Thursday, Channel 12 said that
New York detectives had told the station that they never informed
Fenrich that his stepson's body had been found in pieces,
suggesting that he had incriminated himself by describing the
condition of the body that way.
</P>
<P>
   When police first visited the Fenrich home at 75 Oakfield Ave.
on Tuesday night, Fenrich, 36, and his wife, Wanda, 52, said that
they had not heard from their oldest son since September. But
Timlin said no one had ever filed a report that Steen Fenrich was
missing, either in Queens, where he had been living, or in Suffolk
County, where his parents lived with his 14-year-old stepbrother,
John David.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday evening, a man strolling through Alley Pond Park near
Oakland Lake found two plastic food containers, one of which
contained human bones, part of a foot, part of a pelvis and part of
a skull. Racial and anti-gay epithets were written on the skull in
marker along with a social security number. ``It was very clear,
leading us to believe somebody wanted us to identify that body,''
Timlin said.
</P>
<P>
   In its evening broadcast, News 12 reported that New York police
detectives told the station that Steen Fenrich was gay and had
posed for gay pornographic photographs. Gay rights advocates,
including the New York City Gay and Lesbian Anti-Violence Project,
City Councilwoman Christine Quinn and state Sen. Tom K. Duane,
urged the police Thursday to give the case high priority.
</P>
<P>
   Timlin said that detectives had interviewed Mrs. Fenrich and
planned to question her again. Thursday afternoon, she pulled into
the driveway of her house in a white pick-up truck. ``All I can say
is, there are a lot of inconsistencies,'' she said as reporters
peppered her with questions.
</P>
<P>
   Police officials, meanwhile, continued to search through the
Queens park where the remains were found. The New York City Police
Department's scuba team scoured Oakland Lake and officials said the
search would continue Friday. The Fenrich home, a brown split-level
ranch, was also searched.
</P>
<P>
   Officials were also looking into the details of federal mail and
insurance fraud charges that were filed against the Fenriches in
April. The charges accused them of schemes to defraud more than a
dozen insurance companies of more than $300,000 from October 1992
through 1998.
</P>
<P>
   Philip Blessinger, an investigator with the National Insurance
Crime Bureau, who helped compile the federal charges against the
Fenriches, said he interviewed the couple two years ago and
remembered the case because of the way Mr. Fenrich ``appeared to be
mutilating himself for insurance money.'' The charges accused him
of basing false insurance claims on a number of self-inflicted
injuries.
</P>
<P>
   Investigators said those injuries included the fracture of his
left wrist; a laceration of his left ear and his penis; neck and
back sprains; and the loss of the tip of his left finger.

CHARLIZE ANGEL: ACTRESS TO BE A REGULAR CINEMA FIXTURE

<P>
   NEW YORK _ In most luxury hotels in Houston, you can't open the
windows. In this town, you can, which is why it's downright chilly
in Charlize Theron's suite.
</P>
<P>
   Theron seems to like it, which is odd since she's from South
Africa and has been complaining about all the cold weather she's
had to deal with recently on movie locations.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have told my assistant that she can now only read scripts
that take place in warm climates,'' Theron says with a laugh. ``I
always make movies in such ridiculous temperatures.''
</P>
<P>
   The cold doesn't seem to faze her at the moment. She's barefoot
and sleeveless. Shoulderless, in fact, because she's wearing a
bizarre top that can only be described as a halter sweater crossed
with a turtleneck. It buttons up the back _ what there is of the
back.
</P>
<P>
   Gee, Charlize, w-w-would you like that w-w-window closed?
</P>
<P>
   ``No, I'm totally fine, actually,'' she says, running a hand
down her leg. ``I have my leather pants on.''
</P>
<P>
   Theron, 24, is often referred to as Hollywood's latest It Girl,
due to both her memorable appearance and her strong sexual presence
in movies. She's warming the screen in the multi-Oscar-nominated
``The Cider House Rules''and the action thriller ``Reindeer
Games.``
</P>
<P>
   She's going to be a regular cinema fixture as the year unfolds.
She's already finished ``The Legend of Bagger Vance`` for director
Robert Redford (co-starring with Matt Damon and Will Smith); ``Navy
Diver`` with Cuba Gooding Jr. and Robert DeNiro; and ``The Yards``
with Mark Wahlberg, Joaquin Phoenix, James Caan and Faye Dunaway.
All are due in the summer.
</P>
<P>
   She's currently shooting ``Wakin' Up in Reno,'' with Billy Bob
Thornton, Patrick Swayze and Natasha Richardson. Earlier this year,
the film shot for a week around Amarillo, Texas.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's about two couples traveling from Arkansas who take a
vacation road trip to Reno. We're just going for a motor jamboree
show. I'm married (in the movie) to Patrick Swayze.''
</P>
<P>
   And then she has ``Sweet November,'' with Keanu Reeves, and
perhaps the musical ``Chicago`` down the road.
</P>
<P>
   Because of her role in ``Wakin' Up in Reno,`` Theron no longer
has the short, natural-looking blond hair she sported in ``The
Cider House Rules`` and ``Reindeer Games.'' Instead she's pushing
long, straight tresses in a harsher blond hue over her bare
shoulders. The color and a cigarette give her a hard look, but
that's offset by a high-voltage smile and a loud, ready laugh.
</P>
<P>
   She's excited about ``The Cider House Rules,'' which is up for
seven Oscars Sunday night, including best picture.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've never been in a hit before, that's really the god's
honest truth,'' she says. ``So the support it's been getting from
critics, that to me was more than enough.''
</P>
<P>
   In ``The Cider House Rules,'' set during World War II, Theron
plays Candy, a mature young woman who takes emotional and physical
comfort in a romance with a naive youth (Tobey Maguire) working on
an apple farm. This is after she learns that her fiance has been
badly injured overseas and won't get home for a long time, if ever.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a hard film to make,'' Theron says. ``Thank goodness
for (Swedish director) Lasse Hallstrom, because he automatically
brought magic to it.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was just so much of the story to be told and just so
little time to build such a huge relationship, especially between
my character and Tobey's character.''
</P>
<P>
   Theron has been thrilled with her directors of late, including
Hallstrom, John Frankenheimer (``Reindeer Games'') and especially
Redford on ``The Legend of Bagger Vance.'' She found that
experience memorable.
</P>
<P>
   ``Amazing,'' she says. ``Frightening, very frightening, in the
sense that it was the first time that somebody (Redford) that I
find to be such a legend to this industry, completely just offered
me the part _ just trusted me.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had one meeting with him. I never read anything to him. We
talked about 20 minutes. The next day I got this offer, and before
I knew it I was working on the film. It was frightening because I'm
so used to having to go in and prove myself.''
</P>
<P>
   Theron has kept busy since she made her first big impression on
the screen four years ago in a small but eye-catching part as the
sexual and murderous Helga in ``2 Days in the Valley.'' It was only
a few films before she moved into leading roles (``The Devil's
Advocate,`` with Al Pacino and Reeves; ``Mighty Joe Young`` with a
giant ape; and ``The Astronaut's Wife,`` with Johnny Depp).
</P>
<P>
   Her face has made her a frequent magazine cover subject, which
adds to the belief that she was a supermodel before coming to
Hollywood. In fact, she had not done a lot of modeling but was
actually aiming for a career as a ballet dancer.
</P>
<P>
   Theron, born and raised on a farm near a small suburb of
Johannesburg, trained in ballet from a young age. She did some
modeling as a teen in Milan, but soon headed to New York to work
with the Joffrey Ballet. But that didn't last long, either, due to
a knee injury.
</P>
<P>
   Family tragedy struck in Theron's mid-teens: Her mother shot and
killed her father. The incident was ruled self-defense by
authorities.
</P>
<P>
   Theron is close to her mother, frequently mentioning her during
interviews and often traveling with her.
</P>
<P>
   Theron, who spends most of her time in the United States, was
involved in a South African controversy last year. While back on a
short visit, she did an anti-rape commercial (South Africa has a
high incidence of rape) that was banned there as discriminatory
against men. However, the decision was later overturned, and the ad
ran.
</P>
<P>
   The story of how Theron was ``discovered'' for the movies is a
classic Hollywood tale. When a bank cashier would not cash a check
for her, Theron created enough of a scene to catch the eye of a
talent agent in line behind her. He gave her a card, and soon after
she was in ``2 Days in the Valley.''
</P>
<P>
   As busy as Theron has been, she insists she could have been a
lot busier if she had taken all the roles she has been offered
instead of holding out for chances to work with high-profile
directors. She's convinced that decision has helped move her along
the path from movie It Girl toward recognized actress.
</P>
<P>
   ``Somebody once told me _ and it's always stayed in the back of
my head _ that Mick Jagger once said that he made a career out of
saying `no,''' Theron says. ``Something about that I liked. And I
have said `no' many times, especially early in my career when a lot
of people thought I was completely out of my mind.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was lucky in that the work I really wanted came my way, even
though I was never thought of (first). I had to go in and prove
myself.
</P>
<P>
   ``But you can only make the decision if you have the options in
front of you. I've been lucky to have a lot of interesting material
come my way and make a decision on what will make me grow as an
actress and make me feel challenged.''

HOUSE NARROWLY PASSES SPENDING PLAN WITH $150 BILLION TAX CUT 
</HEADLINE>
  (sw) 
 By WILLIAM K. STEVENS   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The House adopted a Republican budget plan on
Friday morning that would cut taxes by at least $150 billion over
the next five years, provide more money for the military and
education and cut spending on most other programs.
</P>
<P>
   The vote was 211-207, largely along party lines, and came after
Republican leaders scrambled to avert defections by a bloc of
conservatives who said the plan would allow too much spending.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans said the plan, a nonbinding blueprint that sets the
broad parameters for tax and spending bills, was a balanced
approach that provided enough money for national priorities while
restraining the overall growth of government and returning a
substantial portion of the projected federal budget surplus to
taxpayers.
</P>
<P>
   The measure, which because it is not a law is not subject to
veto, calls for total government spending authority next year of
$1.85 trillion, an increase of 3 percent over this year. It would
increase Pentagon spending by 6 percent, to $307.3 billion, and
would effectively require cutbacks in most other categories of
general government operations after taking account of inflation.
</P>
<P>
   ``The question is whether we're going to advance the reform
agenda in Washington,'' said Rep. John R. Kasich, the Ohio
Republican who is chairman of the House Budget Committee, picking
up a theme from his party's expected presidential nominee, Gov.
George W. Bush of Texas.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats said that the plan would force unacceptable cuts in
programs from Head Start to the Drug Enforcement Administration,
that it did nothing to secure the long-term solvency of Social
Security and Medicare, and that it also risked plunging the budget
back into deficit.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Republican budget sacrifices fiscal responsibility on the
altar of massive tax cuts,'' said Rep. Dick Gephardt of Missouri,
the Democratic leader.
</P>
<P>
   Jacob J. Lew, the White House budget director, said in a letter
to congressional leaders that the Clinton administration believed
the House budget was ``fundamentally flawed and fails to provide a
balanced and workable economic plan.''
</P>
<P>
   The House defeated five alternative budget plans, including one
backed by the Democratic leadership and another offered by a group
of conservative Republicans.
</P>
<P>
   Both parties supported using the surplus generated by the Social
Security system _ estimated at $2.3 trillion over the next decade _
only to reduce the part of the national debt held by the public in
the form of Treasury bonds.
</P>
<P>
   But in many ways the debate was a replay of last year's budget
battle, when Republicans passed a $792 billion, 10-year tax cut
that was vetoed by President Clinton. And just like last year,
Republican leaders in the House struggled to hold their slim
majority together for the vote.
</P>
<P>
   Fiscal conservatives said the measure did too little to guard
against end-of-session surges in spending. Republican members of
the appropriations committees that draw up spending bills warned
that the spending levels contained in the budget might be
unrealistically low.
</P>
<P>
   The internal problems Republicans faced in the House were
mirrored in the Senate, where a group of conservatives led by Sen.
Phil Gramm of Texas continued to block a vote in the Senate Budget
Committee on the Senate's own version of the budget. Gramm wants
the budget to contain less spending and more tax cuts.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans in the House also found themselves in the awkward
situation of passing a budget that calls for a smaller tax cut than
the one advocated by Bush in his presidential campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Bush's plan would cut taxes by $483 billion over the five years
starting in 2002, and by about $300 billion during the five-year
period, starting next year, covered by the House budget plan. The
House plan calls for at least $150 billion in tax cuts, and as much
as $240 billion if the projected surplus continues to grow.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats used the unwillingness of the House leadership to
embrace the Bush tax plan to buttress their argument that the Texas
governor's proposal is excessive even by the standards of his own
party.
</P>
<P>
   Much of the partisan wrangling was over the one-sixth of the
budget that goes to general domestic spending outside of Social
Security, Medicare and the Pentagon. The Republican plan would hold
that so-called nonmilitary discretionary spending to $289.2 billion
next year, less than a billion dollars more than this year and not
nearly enough to keep up with the effects of inflation. Democrats
proposed $309 billion in nonmilitary discretionary spending.
</P>
<P>
   The Republican plan would increase spending in a few categories,
like education, where spending would rise to $56.8 billion next
year, an increase of 27.6 percent. But there would be deep cuts in
most other categories after accounting for inflation.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. John M. Spratt Jr. of South Carolina, the senior Democrat
on the House Budget Committee, said the Republican plan would hold
non-defense discretionary spending $114 billion below what is
needed to keep pace with inflation over the next five years. And he
said the entire Republican approach was unrealistic because it
failed to acknowledge that even the Republican-led Congress had
ultimately passed spending bills each year that increased spending
above the rate of inflation.

SPARTANS STAGE RALLY AND DEFEAT SYRACUSE
</HEADLINE>
   (rk) 
 By JOE DRAPE   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUBURN HILLS, Mich. _ Michigan State's sharpshooters, Charlie
Bell and Morris Peterson, combined for eight points in the first
half, and the scoreboard showed that Syracuse was poised to upset
the top-seeded Spartans in the Midwest Regional Thursday night.
</P>
<P>
   But all it took after intermission were flicks of their left
wrists and the omnipresent A.J. Granger to put back their misses to
turn a 10-point halftime deficit into an impressive 75-58 victory
over the fourth-seeded Orangemen and a trip to the regional final
here at the Palace, which is only an 80-minute drive from their
East Lansing campus.
</P>
<P>
   Peterson, the senior from Flint, showed Bell, the junior from
the same industrial hometown, how to beat back the Syracuse
challenge _ by shooting often and confidently. The 6-foot-8-inch
forward's 16 second-half points _ including 4 of 6 from the 3-point
arc _ twice earlier had trimmed what once were runaway leads for
the Orangemen.
</P>
<P>
   But with 6 minutes 11 seconds remaining, Bell hit a 24-foot
3-pointer to tie at 58-58 and and followed it with a 16-footer to
give the Spartans their first lead since the opening moments of the
game, 60-58. When Peterson, who finished with 21, dropped his own
bomb from 3-point land to make it 63-58 the Spartans were off and
running _ scoring the last 17 points of the game and sending the
Orangemen home.
</P>
<P>
   In the second half, the Orangemen (26-6) withstood an early
Spartan scoring outburst only have to do it again midway through
the second half. Trailing by 40-26, the Spartans (29-7) hit four
consecutive 3-pointers in the span of 1:56 _ two of them by Mateen
Cleaves who was blanked in the first half _ to cut Syracuse's lead
to 44-38. The Orangemen, however, extended their zone to disrupt
Michigan State's hot shooters and built their lead back to 49-41.
</P>
<P>
   But Peterson hit a 3-pointer and Cleaves followed it with an
18-footer to pull to 49-46. Allen Griffin, a defensive specialist
having the offensive night of his career, answered with a slashing
drive. He did it again the next time down the floor, was fouled and
hit his 13th and 14th points of the night on the free throws.
</P>
<P>
   With 7:04 left to play, the Spartans pulled to 56-55, when
Cleaves found Granger beneath the basket with a no-look pass. What
had been a difficult play all night with the shot-blocker Etan
Thomas lurking in the middle was suddenly easy, the Orangemen's
6-foot 9-inch center was on the bench after he committed his fourth
foul 47 seconds earlier. Moments later, the Spartans had taken
their first lead since the opening minutes of the game, when Bell
hit a 3-pointer and brought the sold-out crowd of 21,214 to its
feet.
</P>
<P>
   Michigan State's penchant for attacking inside with everyone
from skittering the 6-foot-2-inch point guard Cleaves to the
bullying 6-foot 8-inch and 6-foot 9-inch muscle men Andre Hutson
and Granger is what made Syracuse coach Jim Boeheim pick them to
win a national title long before the NCAA tournament began.
</P>
<P>
   Boeheim's team had followed a 19-0 start by going 5-5 down the
stretch, including an embarrassing opening-round loss to Georgetown
in the Big East tournament. But as the No. 4-seeded team in the
region, the Orangemen found their way again by going back inside
and keeping their opponent outside.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nobody is expecting us to get past this round,'' Syracuse
guard Preston Shumpert said before Thursday night's game. ``But
they've had trouble with zone defenses in the past. We definitely
can play with them.''
</P>
<P>
   The Spartans came into the tournament allowing only 59.4 points
a game _ the 11th-best scoring defense in the nation. In their
73-61 second-round victory over Utah, the Utes were only the third
team this season to shoot better than 50 percent against Michigan
State.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday night, in taking a 34-24 halftime lead, Syracuse looked
intent on becoming the fourth and perhaps final team to master
Michigan State's vaunted attack man-to-man defense. The Orangemen
shot 53.8 percent and their compact zone forced the Spartans to
struggle to 33 percent from long range.
</P>
<P>
   The Spartans, however, bolted to the fast start much to the
delight of the almost completely green-and-white clad Michigan
State faithful. Peterson needed just seven seconds to drill a
3-pointer from the left wing. Then Cleaves stripped Jason Hart in
the open court and got the ball inside to Andre Hutson.
</P>
<P>
   When the Orangemen turned the ball over three consecutive times,
including Hart's stepping over the line on an inbounds pass, the
Spartans were off to an 11-3 lead.
</P>
<P>
   But the Orangemen answered with an 18-3 run over the next 7
minutes to take a 21-14 lead and showed the Spartans that hostile
crowd or not they intended to battle. Then they pounded the ball
inside and dominated one of the nation's best rebounding teams,
18-12. With Thomas and Ryan Blackwell plugging the middle, Hart and
little-used Griffin sparked a 11-0 run that that put Michigan State
in its biggest hole of the tournament at 32-19.
</P>
<P>
   Griffin, a junior from Brooklyn, was nearly flawless, scoring 10
first- half points on 4-of-5 shooting to lead Syracuse. He and Hart
combined for three steals and limited Cleaves and Bell to a
combined 1-for-9 shooting from the field.

MAVERICKS BOSS WANTS DON NELSON TO RETAIN GM TITLE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By DWAIN PRICE 
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   DALLAS _ Mark Cuban answered three of the most frequently asked
questions about the Mavericks' organization when he announced
yesterday that he wants Don Nelson, Terdema Ussery and Donnie
Nelson to return.
</P>
<P>
   Cuban, the Mavericks' owner pending NBA approval, said Don
Nelson will return as the Mavericks' general manager and not as
president of basketball operations.
</P>
<P>
   ``He will not be named president of basketball operations,''
Cuban said. ``As GM, I would like to have him come back. But it's
as much his decision as mine.''
</P>
<P>
   Nelson is under contract for two more seasons, and liked what he
heard from Cuban.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm under contract, but I didn't know I was going to stay
on,'' Nelson said. ``It's nice to know. I was just going to conduct
my business the same.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't think it was my position to ask him how I'm doing.''
</P>
<P>
   Cuban also said he likes what Ussery _ the Mavericks' president
and chief executive officer _ has done. Ussery helped lobby for the
referendum on the new American Airlines Arena, which passed by
fewer than 1,700 votes.
</P>
<P>
   ``T is staying here; I love T,'' Cuban said. ``There's no
decision to make. He's here, and he's going to be here as long as
he wants to be here.''
</P>
<P>
   That was inspiring news for Ussery, who also has two years
remaining on his contract.
</P>
<P>
   ``I love working with Mark, because he's been an incredible
breath of fresh air,'' Ussery said. ``I think we're going to do
great things together _ all of us.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our goals are the same, and that is to fill the building and
bring a championship to Dallas. And there's no doubt in my mind
with him leading the point, I'm going to be wearing a championship
ring in the not too distant future.''
</P>
<P>
   Donnie Nelson is in the final year of his contract as the
Mavericks' top assistant coach and director of player personnel.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want Donnie back,'' Cuban said. ``In what capacity, we don't
know yet. But Donnie will definitely be part of the organization,
unless he decides not to be.''
</P>
<P>
   As for asking his players on who the team's next head coach will
be, Cuban said that's not going to happen.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not asking for names of coaches,'' he said. ``I'm looking
for qualities that are important to the players when it comes to
selecting a coach. I want to know if they want a younger guy or an
older guy.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're not going to make the decision; I just want their
feedback. I want them to be part of the decision process, so when
the decision is made they won't get turned off. Do they want
somebody that works them hard like Pat Riley? Again, it's not going
to drive the decision, but it's feedback that I need.''
</P>
<P>
   However, Cuban will be polling his front office about the
players. Don Nelson said he wants to re-sign forward Gary Trent,
who has been out since re-injuring his strained left groin Jan. 22
against New Jersey. Trent can option out of his contract on July 1,
but that's unlikely, because he has no leverage on the free-agent
market.
</P>
<P>
   ``He'll sign a one-year deal next year and then he'll be our
\RLarry\S Bird exception,'' Nelson said, referring to NBA rule that
allows teams to exceed the salary cap to sign free agents already
on their roster. ``Then we will sign him to a long-term deal after
we get our free-agent stuff.''
</P>
<P>
   The Mavericks are $6 million over the salary cap for next
season. Unless they are able to move players such as Shawn Bradley,
Steve Nash, Robert Pack, Sean Rooks or John ``Hot Rod'' Williams,
they won't get any cap relief until the summer of 2001.
</P>
<P>
   Cuban has said he wants to sign an impact free agent this
summer. While salary-cap restrictions make such a move unlikely,
the Mavericks' roster could change. Cuban said no player is
untouchable, including Michael Finley and Dirk Nowitzki.
</P>
<P>
   ``In business there's no such thing as an untouchable,'' Cuban
said. ``But it'll take one hell of a deal to get me to pry any one
of those guys away from here.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've fallen in love with a lot of guys, but business is still
business. I thought the world of Dennis Rodman.''
</P>
<P>
   Rodman was released by the Mavericks after a short stint with
the team. nn

OSCARS' FINDER INVITED TO ATTEND AWARDS SHOW
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By TROY ANDERSON 
c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Junk salvager Willie Fulgear's rock 'n' roll
dreams came true Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   After days of anticipation, the 61-year-old former singer
finally got his $50,000 reward for finding 52 of the 55 stolen
Oscar statuettes near a trash bin and returning them in time for
the awards ceremony Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   The Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences also told
Fulgear that he and his son will be going to the Oscars - riding in
a limousine and wearing tuxedos.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some people say honesty don't pay,'' Fulgear said, as a mob of
reporters listened intently. ``Those are the rich people. I don't
know what it's like to be rich. I'm a poor man.
</P>
<P>
   ``I come across gold, you know what I mean, and I gave it back
where some people wouldn't do that. My mother didn't raise me that
way.''
</P>
<P>
   Since finding filmdom's golden idols Sunday, Fulgear has been
deluged with offers - one up to $10,000 - from reporters who want
to ride with him to the event and walk down the red carpet.
</P>
<P>
   This brush with fame and fortune couldn't have come at a better
time for Fulgear, who was being evicted with his 22-year-old son
from their home.
</P>
<P>
   While sprucing up Thursday at his favorite barber shop, Fulgear
pondered the prospect of going to the ceremony and getting fitted
today for a tuxedo.
</P>
<P>
   ``I like that,'' he said. ``Yeah. I love it. I'd like to have a
book made of me, my life. My story. I would love it.''
</P>
<P>
   Fulgear said he hopes to meet Billy Crystal and Denzel
Washington at the ceremony. He plans to use the reward money to put
a down payment on a home, which he could leave to his son after
he's gone.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm very proud of my father,'' Allen said.
</P>
<P>
   Fulgear came from Chicago to Los Angeles in the 1960s to pursue
a singing career. But he didn't make much money singing so he got a
job as a mechanical engineer at various Los Angeles bakeries.
</P>
<P>
   Then in the mid-1980s, he lost his job, his wife died and he was
left to raise his son alone.
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday, he got his reward.
</P>
<P>
   ``Thanks to local hero Mr. Fulgear, we were able to recover 52
of the 55 missing statuettes,'' said Los Angeles police Cmdr. David
Kalish. ``Along with our recovery came a quite sizable reward. As
we said earlier, now the show can go on.''
</P>
<P>
   Academy officials said he also gets a coveted seat at the
Oscars.
</P>
<P>
   ``We recognize his role in the recovery of the Oscar statuettes
and we're looking forward to him being in attendance at our show,''
said Leslie Unger, a spokeswoman for the academy.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hopefully, he'll have a wonderful time.''
</P>
<P>
   Fulgear walked up to the Parker Center police headquarters with
his arm around his son's shoulders and was escorted inside the
building, wearing a dark jacket and a porkpie hat.
</P>
<P>
   He reappeared wearing a jacket and cap from Roadway Express,
which had shipped the Oscars from Chicago.
</P>
<P>
   T.J. O'Connor, vice president of the western division of the
shipping company, thanked him for finding the stolen Oscars and
took note of his dream to buy a house.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hope this goes a long way to helping that dream come true,''
said O'Connor, handing Fulgear a $50,000 check.

<P>
   &LR; AUBURN HILLS, Mich.  &UR; _ &LR;  To defend Iowa State All-American
Marcus Fizer, UCLA grabbed a page from one of its most successful
playbooks in recent memory.
</P>
<P>
   The Bruins defended Fizer as they defended Arkansas All-American
Corliss Williamson in the 1995 NCAA title game. Both Fizer and
Williamson are power forwards in the classic sense  &UR; _ &LR; 
thick-bodied, physical, mobile, with playing styles similar to
Charles Barkley.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think Marcus Fizer is as dominant as anyone in the
country,'' Bruins coach Steve Lavin said. ``He's very versatile,
like Barkley. He can step away from the basket and create for
himself. But he can also post you up down low and go to work on
you. He's a nightmare.''
</P>
<P>
   Fizer is a 6-8, 265-pound junior from Arcadia, La. He entered
Thursday's Sweet 16 showdown averaging 23.2 points and 7.8 rebounds
while shooting 38.9 percent from 3-point range. He's a leading
candidate for national player of the year and has five 30-point
games in the last month.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you have a bigger guy on him, he'll go outside and take you
off the dribble,'' said UCLA assistant Steve Spencer, who oversees
the defense. ``If he has a smaller guy on him, he posts up.''
</P>
<P>
   The one thing UCLA's big men have that Fizer doesn't is length.
Jerome Moiso is 6-10, Dan Gadzuric is 6-11, and both have long
arms.
</P>
<P>
   Just as the Bruins successfully forced the 6-7 Williamson to
shoot over 7-foot center George Zidek  &UR; _ &LR;  Williamson scored just 12
points  &UR; _ &LR;  so did they try to force Fizer to shoot over Moiso and
Gadzuric. When Fizer got the ball in the low post, the Bruins
backed off, played a perimeter-style defense that emphasized
lateral movement and tried to deny him a direct path to the basket.
They did not use the body-to-body style that allows Fizer to
overpower opponents.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you make a 6-8 guy shoot over a 7-footer's hands, you have
a chance,'' Spencer said. ``You have to do a good job keeping
yourself between him and the basket.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; __  &LR; Return trip: UCLA freshman forward Jason Kapono played in
The Palace last spring in the Magic Johnson Roundball Classic, a
high school all-star game. He recalled scoring 20 or 22 points in a
victory. Cincinnati's DerMarr Johnson and Kentucky's Keith Bogans
also participated.
</P>
<P>
   ``Playing here should help me,'' Kapono said before Thursday's
game. ``I know the floor and the rims and the surroundings. This
actually seems smaller because the Metrodome (where UCLA played
last weekend) was so huge. This seems like a high school gym.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; __  &LR; Games to remember: Lavin was asked Wednesday to name the
greatest victories of his four-year tenure. He mentioned six:
</P>
<P>
   The `97 victories over Duke (late in the regular season) and
Iowa State (Sweet 16).
</P>
<P>
   The `98 upset of No. &UR;  &LR; 3 seed Michigan in the second round.
</P>
<P>
   This year's victories over Purdue (he is close friends with
Boilermakers coach Gene Keady), North Carolina and, of course,
Stanford.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; __  &LR; Nice bump: Talk about commitment. Iowa State coach Larry
Eustachy recently signed a 10-year, $9-million contract that could
be worth in excess of $1 million annually with incentives.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you look at the Big 12, when you look at the Big 10, when
you look at the Pac-10 and other conferences across this country,
it's competitive relative to Larry's experiences and where he is in
his life,'' ISU athletic director Gene Smith told the Ames Tribune.

BOY, 11, DISCOVERS ANCIENT SHARK TOOTH

<TEXT>
<P>
   Chatsworth, Calif. _ Eleven-year-old Adam Sadinsky was walking
to class at Chatsworth Hills Academy recently when he spied what he
thought was an acorn. Like any curious kid, he dug it up and
discovered not an acorn but what appeared to be a two-inch-long
tooth.
</P>
<P>
   On a class field trip to the Museum of Natural History this
week, the young boy learned it was a fossilized mako shark's tooth,
believed to be 12 million to 15 million years old.
</P>
<P>
   ``My first words were, oh my God,'' Adam recalled. ``And my
second words were how much is it worth?''
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately, nothing - aside from its educational value, of
course.
</P>
<P>
   The school plans to keep the tooth, much to Adam's
disappointment, and display it in the library with some locally
found Indian artifacts.
</P>
<P>
   Howell Thomas, head of the museum's fossil preparation lab,
identified and dated Adam's find in consultation with his
colleagues. It dates from the middle of the Miocene period, which
was roughly 5 million to 24 million years ago, he said, when the
entire region as far east as the Sierra Nevada range was
underwater.
</P>
<P>
   The shark itself was probably about 12 to 15 feet long, he
added.
</P>
<P>
   ``Chatsworth and the Simi area are marine sediments, so it's not
uncommon to find things out there,'' Thomas said. ``Not everyone
stumbles onto a shark's tooth, of course. There's older stuff out
there, like 50 million-year-old crabs.''
</P>
<P>
   Academy director Laura Bell said the school is located on a
Chumash Indian site, so artifacts such as arrowheads and mortars
and pestles have been found before.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have found, over the years, different artifacts from the
Native Americans, and we have found fossilized plant life, but
something of this nature is a first for us,'' Bell said.
</P>
<P>
   She added that the second-graders are going to the museum on a
field trip today and plan to bring other artifacts for Thomas to
identify.
</P>
<P>
   The display in the library will credit Adam with the find and
include some text to educate students about its significance, Bell
said.
</P>
<P>
   Adam said he would have liked to keep the tooth, but he
understands, and his mother said they don't plan to dispute the
school's possession.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not going to argue with teachers, but I'm sure
disappointed, because I found it,'' Adam said.
</P>
<P>
   For Adam, the find was particularly exciting not just because of
its age.
</P>
<P>
   ``He loves sharks,'' said his mother, Beverly. ``He watches the
Discovery Channel all the time with his dad. He did a book report
on sharks. He's fascinated with them.''

FETTERS A PLEASANT SURPRISE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BRIAN DOHN  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   VERO BEACH, Fla. _ The Dodgers found relief in an unlikely place
in lefty Pedro Borbon last season and they're hoping to have done
the same with right-hander Mike Fetters.
</P>
<P>
   Fetters, the onetime Milwaukee closer who has pitched hurt for
much of the last three seasons, saw his career plummet.
</P>
<P>
   The Dodgers gave him a chance to resurrect it and the San
Fernando Valley product is on target after making the club as a
nonroster invitee.
</P>
<P>
   Fetters' spot in the bullpen became official Thursday when the
Dodgers added him to their 40-man roster. It came after his fourth
outing of the spring, in which he was overwhelming.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I signed Fetters to a minor-league contract, we thought
he was going to be good,'' Dodgers general manager Kevin Malone
said. ``Just not this good.''
</P>
<P>
   Fetters, 35, allowed one hit in a shutout inning against
Atlanta. It's the only hit he's allowed this spring while striking
out three and not walking a batter.
</P>
<P>
   The Van Nuys native and former Pepperdine star credited surgery
last June to remove bone chips in his right elbow.
</P>
<P>
   ``I worked my butt off to get in shape so I could be pitching
well,'' said Fetters, who saved 71 games for the Brewers from
1994-96. ``I came back at the end of last season to prove to
everyone I could still pitch and I was healthy.''
</P>
<P>
   __ Sheffield eyes return: For the first time since cutting his
left pinkie Friday, Dodgers left fielder Gary Sheffield hit off a
tee and said he could return to the lineup Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``I still don't have full range of motion, but it feels
better,'' Sheffield said. ``It didn't hurt that much.''
</P>
<P>
   Sheffield needed three stitches to close the gash, and he said
one of them fell out earlier in the day. But he didn't think that
would set him back.
</P>
<P>
   __ Odds and ends: Righty Kevin Brown pitched six shutout innings
against the Braves to lower his spring ERA to 1.23. He allowed
three hits and threw 84 pitches. . . . The Dodgers optioned
left-hander Jeff Williams to Triple-A Albuquerque, where he'll join
the starting rotation. Catcher Adam Melhuse was reassigned to
minor-league camp. . . . After signing third baseman Adrian Beltre,
Dodgers managing partner and CEO Bob Daly left Dodgertown and won't
return this spring.

FRUIT FLY'S GENES MAY PROVIDE AN DISORDERS
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     By DAVID PERLMAN 
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
 &LR;   &LR;  Two research teams composed of hundreds of scientists described
Thursday how they have determined the nearly complete genetic
design of the lowly fruit fly _ a tiny creature that has proved
vital to understanding basic human biology over the past 90 years.
<P>
   Decoding the cryptic genetic sequence of the fruit fly, whose
scientific name is Drosophila melanogaster, was termed a
``phenomenal milestone'' that could lead experimenters to new clues
about human genetic disorders.
</P>
<P>
   It also marks a major step in the effort to decipher the entire
human genetic code, which comprises about 3 billion molecular
``letters`` making up the 100,000 or so genes that direct human
inheritance, the scientists said.
</P>
<P>
   The fruit fly achievement is described in a series of nine
detailed reports appearing in Friday's issue of the journal
Science. Leaders of the teams are Dr. Gerald M. Rubin of the
University of California at Berkeley and J. Craig Venter, founder
of the Celera Corp. Their first complete report Friday counted 195
co-authors.
</P>
<P>
   In an interview Thursday, Rubin described how the teams reached
the climax of their work by calling in scores of the world's
leading genetics researchers from five countries for a closed-door
meeting last November at the Celera Corp. headquarters in
Rockville, Md.
</P>
<P>
   The teams ``holed up'' for two weeks at Celera, Rubin said, and
shared all their data in a day-and-night marathon with researchers
catching moments of sleep at all hours.
</P>
<P>
   ``We lived on Chinese take-out, we talked and talked and talked
and we didn't sleep. What we had was a regular Woodstock for
science nerds,'' Rubin said.
</P>
<P>
   The fruit fly, he said, ``provides a dictionary'' for learning
much about human genes because some 60 percent of the fruit fly's
13,600 genes are identical to those in humans. By studying the
genes of fruit flies during decades of experiments, scientists have
already acquired powerful insights into genetic disorders that
afflict millions of people.
</P>
<P>
   For nearly a century, the tiny big-eyed fly has been an
important laboratory tool for studying the mechanisms of heredity,
in part because it produces new generations in a matter of weeks.
Now that researchers know the sequence of nearly all the fruit
fly's genes, they can work to determine the precise function of
those genes.
</P>
<P>
   The fruit fly is the third organism whose genetic code has been
almost completely deciphered. Scientists have deciphered the genome
of a single microscopic yeast strain called Saccharomyces, as well
as the common roundworm known as C. elegans.
</P>
<P>
   Government scientists, as well as those working for private
companies like Celera Corp., are working furiously to resolve the
greatest puzzle of all _ the complete decoding of the entire
genome.
</P>
<P>
   But simply learning the sequence of molecular letters of these
genes is only part of the challenge. Scientists will then use
supercomputers and their own brains to pin down the function of all
the genes they have decoded.
</P>
<P>
   By comparing human genetic code with that of yeast, the
roundworm C. elegans and the fruit fly, scientists hope to better
understand the function and origin of human genes and gain a deeper
knowledge of how human bodies are designed.
</P>
<P>
   In one of the reports Thursday, Dr. Thomas B. Kornberg of the
University of California at San Francisco and Dr. Mark A. Krasnow
of Stanford called the fruit fly achievement a ``monumental feat,''
leading to a better understanding in medical fields like cancer
biology, diabetes, kidney disease, parkinsonism, nerve disorders
and drug interactions.
</P>
<P>
   And Dr. Francis Collins, director of the National Human Genome
Research Institute at the National Institutes of Health, declared
Thursday that decoding the genetic makeup of the fruit fly is ``a
phenomenal milestone because of the fruit fly's pivotal role in
research, ranging from aging and cancer to learning and memory.''

<TEXT>
SAN FRANCISCO _ Break out the shorts and sunblock. The National
Weather Service low-frequency radio station KHB49 in S.F. provides
24-hour weather, read by the suave-voiced guy who sounds like
Ricardo Montalban but is really a robot sound machine dubbed Igor.
<P>
   Thursday at 10 a.m., Igor reported that the temp in downtown San
Francisco was 552 degrees.
</P>
<P>
   As Granny used to say, hot enough to fry your eyeballs like corn

in the Portola neighborhood. The kids sewed a dozen beautiful
sleeping bags from scrap material to give to local homeless folks.
And today San Francisco is a warmer place.
</P>
<P>
   -- On the other hand: A woman is moving some boxes of stuff, and
a very expensive bike, to an apartment in the Castro. She's
unloading her car when another car swerves around corner, nicks her
car, knocks her to ground, speeds off.

$14 MILLION TO FIGHT SHARPSHOOTER, A THREAT TO STATE'S VINEYARDS
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     By LYNDA GLEDHILL 
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SACRAMENTO _ Gov. Gray Davis Thursday committed $14 million over
two years to eradicate the glassy-winged sharpshooter, a nefarious
bug threatening vineyards up and down the state.
</P>
<P>
   The sharpshooter, which transmits Pierce's disease, has settled
in the Temecula region of Riverside County and has been found
recently in the San Joaquin Valley. Experts in California's $33
billion wine industry fear it will spread statewide if left
uncontrolled.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are very pleased by the personal pledge of the governor,
his leadership and the resources of his departments,'' said John
DeLuca, president of the San Francisco-based Wine Institute, which
represents 90 percent of the state's wine industry.
</P>
<P>
   Pierce's disease already has caused $33 million in damage in
Napa, Sonoma and Mendocino counties. The glassy-winged sharpshooter
is considered the most destructive carrier of the disease, which
has been around for a century.
</P>
<P>
   Representatives of wineries, including Kendall-Jackson, Gallo
and Beringer, and other industry experts met Thursday with Davis
and William Lyons Jr., secretary of the California Department of
Food and Agriculture, to discuss the problem.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is an issue that not only affects wine, but also almonds,
citrus, peaches and other products,'' Lyons said. ``We are taking
it as a serious threat and are marshaling a statewide task force to
work on the problem.''
</P>
<P>
   Davis' support will speed passage of a Senate bill by Democratic
Sens. John Burton of San Francisco and Wes Chesbro of Arcata that
includes the $6.9 million funding each year for the next two years.
</P>
<P>
   The federal government also is working on an appropriations bill
of $14 million to combat the disease, and the industry will
contribute 25 percent for research funds, DeLuca said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not looking for wiggle room when it comes to
cost-sharing,'' he said. ``The agriculture industry will pay its
fair share.''
</P>
<P>
   The money will be used for both short-term and long-term
solutions. The most immediate goal is to stop the insect from
spreading, said Karen Ross, president of the California Association
of Winegrape Growers.
</P>
<P>
   ``The long-term goal is to stop the disease,'' she said.
Immediate efforts include surveying every California county to look
for the pest, notifying farmers of the risks and ways to combat the
disease, and continuing research into better ways to kill the
insect.
</P>
<P>
   The glassy-winged sharpshooter was detected in California in the
early 1990s.
</P>
<P>
   The insect is known to feed on hundreds of species of plants,
using its needle-like mouth to tap into the water-conducting
tissues of a plant. In addition to its mobility and its varied food
sources, it is dangerous because of its sheer thirst: equal to, in
relative terms, a 150-pound human drinking 4,300 gallons of water a
day.
</P>
<P>
   As the insect drinks, it deposits the bacteria that cause
Pierce's disease into the center of the plant, clogging the flow of
water through the plant's system.
</P>
<P>
   Researchers have found some pesticides and natural predators
that kill the insects, and they are continuing to look for even
better natural enemies of the bugs that can be safely introduced to
California.

PROSECUTOR WHO FOUGHT TO CHARGE RAMPART COPS REASSIGNED
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BETH BARRETT, GREG GITTRICH AND RICK ORLOV 
c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ A top veteran prosecutor who aggressively pushed
to file criminal charges against Rampart Division anti-gang
officers was abruptly removed from District Attorney Gil Garcetti's
LAPD corruption task force and reassigned to low-level work, the
Los Angeles Daily News has learned.
</P>
<P>
   Deputy District Attorney George Rosenstock repeatedly told his
supervisors that by working with LAPD investigators he had obtained
enough evidence to file a solid criminal case against disgraced cop
Brian Hewitt and possibly other officers involved in an infamous
station-house beating.
</P>
<P>
   But Rosenstock never got the chance to indict the cops.
</P>
<P>
   After two months of meetings and memo exchanges, he was yanked
from the task force and ``exiled'' Feb. 7 to a nondescript post in
Long Beach, far away from the high-profile, elite corruption
investigative team downtown.
</P>
<P>
   Rosenstock, who refused to comment on his transfer, now handles
only routine cases, sources said.
</P>
<P>
   ``They got rid of him,'' said a source close to the
investigation. ``He was ready to file cases. He wanted to move on
it.''
</P>
<P>
   District Attorney's Office spokeswoman Sandi Gibbons declined to
discuss the rationale for Rosenstock's transfer, saying it was the
prerogative of Deputy District Attorney Dan Murphy to select his
own team when he took over the task force handling the police
scandal in January.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was given authority to put together his own team and that's
exactly what he did,'' Gibbons said.
</P>
<P>
   Gibbons described Rosenstock as an experienced and ``excellent
trial attorney. He has handled some big cases for us.''
</P>
<P>
   Sources in the District Attorney's Office and Los Angeles Police
Department said Rosenstock's banishment was a significant flash
point in the acrimonious relationship between Garcetti and LAPD
Chief Bernard C. Parks.
</P>
<P>
   Garcetti has resisted Parks' demands to move swiftly against
corrupt cops, insisting his office has a better chance of winning
convictions on conspiracy and other serious charges that take time
to put together.
</P>
<P>
   Not buying the argument, Parks contends there is a better chance
of getting cops to talk if they face prison time now, even on
relatively minor offenses like perjury and evidence tampering.
</P>
<P>
   The decision by Murphy to kick Rosenstock off the team has
essentially put the law enforcement agencies at a standoff for the
past five weeks. During the feuding, little, if any collaboration
has occurred, sources said.
</P>
<P>
   As revealed by the Daily News in a Feb. 14 article, the District
Attorney's Office rejected two requests from top LAPD officials to
indict Hewitt. Senior prosecutors contended the case was too weak,
despite compelling evidence gathered by Internal Affairs officers.
</P>
<P>
   Rosenstock took up the case late last year. After reviewing the
evidence - including samples of the victim's blood splattered on
the station house walls, a swatch of carpet soaked with the
victim's bloody vomit and testimony from an emergency room doctor
who treated the victim - he was convinced it was strong enough to
win a conviction.
</P>
<P>
   Hewitt was fired for the February 1998 beating, but has not been
charged with any crimes. In fact, no police officers involved in
the worst police corruption scandal in the city's history, other
than Rafael Perez, the central figure in the turmoil, have been
arrested or indicted.
</P>
<P>
   Resisting mounting criticism about his prosecutorial decisions,
Garcetti has said he will not charge corrupt cops with perjury,
falsifying evidence or other crimes merely to appease Parks or the
public. In sworn statements made since last September, Perez, the
corrupt cop turned key informant, has told task force investigators
that he and other cops waged a thuggish and criminal war on
suspected members of the 18th Street Gang.
</P>
<P>
   According to Perez, the cops routinely framed suspects and then
lied in court to send them to prison. Most egregiously, at least
one unarmed man was shot by police, confidential transcripts of
Perez's testimony reveal.
</P>
<P>
   Since Rosenstock's exile, pressure has been steadily mounting on
the District Attorney's Office to move more quickly on prosecuting
dirty cops. The most vocal critics have been LAPD officials who
publicly maintain the disgraced men in blue should be put behind
bars, not just brought up on administrative and disciplinary
charges.
</P>
<P>
   In recent days, tension between the LAPD and District Attorney's
Office has increased dramatically and publicly in a war of words
and blatant news leaks.
</P>
<P>
   The questions raised by the Rosenstock affair resonate with
issues brought up by recent Daily News articles about whether the
District Attorney's Office shares responsibility for the extent of
the police scandal and whether Garcetti has been vigorous enough in
going after dirty cops.
</P>

   Garcetti has been vigorous enough in going after dirty cops.

   (BEGIN SECOND TAKE)
</P>
<P>
   In recent days, tension between the LAPD and District Attorney's
Office has increased dramatically and publicly in a war of words
and blatant news leaks.
</P>
<P>
   The questions raised by the Rosenstock affair resonate with
issues brought up by recent Daily News articles about whether the
District Attorney's Office shares responsibility for the extent of
the police scandal and whether Garcetti has been vigorous enough in
going after dirty cops.
</P>
<P>
   Deputy District Attorney Michael Kraut, for instance, sounded
alarms about Perez on two occasions in 1997, more than a year
before Perez was nabbed for stealing about $1 million worth of
cocaine from a police evidence room.
</P>
<P>
   While Perez's supervisor was verbally notified about one of
Kraut's suspicions, the District Attorney's Office failed to
officially inform the LAPD for more than a year or even warn other
prosecutors about the dirty cop. During that span of time, at least
17 people were convicted on bogus charges concocted by Perez.
</P>
<P>
   Garcetti's office has responded to the criticism by saying it is
``absurd'' that prosecutors share any blame or responsibility for
the Rampart scandal. Garcetti has said the scandal is the LAPD's
``mess.'' He has refused to conduct an investigation into how
dozens and possibly hundreds of people could be convicted by his
office on tainted evidence and testimony without arousing
suspicion.
</P>
<P>
   Parks declined on Thursday to discuss the Rosenstock situation.
</P>
<P>
   But an LAPD source said the chief has repeatedly railed against
the decision of the District Attorney's Office to pull Rosenstock
off the Hewitt case. In private conversations, Parks has pointed to
Rosenstock's exile to explain the problems his detectives are
having with Garcetti's office, sources said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Here you had a deputy D.A. who got it _ who understood the
seriousness of the case and said he could win the case,'' a source
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Then, all of a sudden Rosenstock was transferred.''
</P>
<P>
   In separate interviews, three sources close to the widening
corruption probe said Rosenstock repeatedly told them beginning in
late November that he was prepared to file charges against Hewitt
for the vicious 1998 jail-house beating of Ismael Jimenez.
</P>
<P>
   The sources said Rosenstock told the heads of the LAPD and
D.A.'s investigative teams that the case against Hewitt was solid
and should be filed promptly.
</P>
<P>
   In Rosenstock's opinion, Hewitt wouldn't be a sacrificial
prosecution; he believed other cops involved in the beating of
Jimenez were indictable, the sources said.
</P>
<P>
   ``He indicated to us it was a fileable case and ready to go,
that he had discussed it with his bosses in mid-December,'' said
one source, who said he spoke directly with Rosenstock on the
matter in December.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was full speed ahead.''
</P>
<P>
   Before his removal from the task force, Rosenstock was respected
by the LAPD for his willingness to leave his office in the downtown
Criminal Courts building to accompany LAPD detectives as they
walked through potential crime scenes described by Perez.
</P>
<P>
   When his calls for indictments were ignored by his superiors,
Rosenstock told several high-ranking officials he was frustrated
that his bosses weren't backing him in his efforts to get key
information, including audio tapes from LAPD investigators.
</P>
<P>
   In late December, Garcetti named Murphy to head the task force
and he took over in January.
</P>
<P>
   ``With Murphy on board, it was over; that became real evident,''
one source said. ``They didn't like Rosenstock because he was
aggressive. Still, he tried to convince Murphy that the case was
ready to go.''
</P>
<P>
   In early February, as Garcetti prepared for a tough political
fight in the March 7 primary, Rosenstock again pushed for charges
to be filed. On Feb. 7, he was reassigned.
</P>
<P>
   ``Suddenly there was no (District Attorney's Office) contact in
the Hewitt case,'' a source added. ``There was no activity in the
Hewitt case for five weeks. A case that we were led to believe had
a tremendous amount of merit ... sat there for five weeks.''
</P>
<P>
   Police investigators were left in the dark on the status of the
Hewitt case until last week when prosecutors called with a series
of requests for information, complaining they had been denied
potential pieces of evidence. Some of that information already had
been turned over to prosecutors before the shake-up in the team, a
source said.
</P>
<P>
   The request was part of Garcetti's plan to accuse Parks of
refusing to cooperate with the District Attorney's Office, a source
added.
</P>
<P>
   An original team of five prosecutors was set up in October to
examine Perez's allegations of police corruption. It was recently
expanded by Garcetti to include 30 prosecutors and support
personnel.
</P>
<P>
   On Feb. 23, six FBI agents were added to the probe at Parks'
request. Attorney General Janet Reno has said the Department of
Justice will continue to review the corruption scandal from an
independent point of view, providing assistance where it can.
</P>
<P>
   In recent days, civil rights activists and city officials have
stepped up calls for the Department of Justice to take over as the
lead agency in the task force. Cries for an officewide review of
the District Attorney's Office also have intensified.

STRONGER DOORS SOUGHT FOR COCKPITS
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     By MARSHALL WILSON 
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Five airlines and a pilots' association are investigating ways
to strengthen doors to the cockpit after two recent incidents of
passengers assaulting the flight crew.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, an airline industry group issued a guide this week on
how to prosecute unruly passengers.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you've got people trying to open the cabin door in
flight, that's a dangerous situation,'' said John Mazor, spokesman
for the Air Line Pilots Association, speaking from his home in
Virginia last night.
</P>
<P>
   ``They were designed for privacy and to keep people from
wandering in, not for passengers going berserk and breaking into
the cockpit,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, a passenger aboard an America West flight to Phoenix
allegedly entered the cockpit and struck the co-pilot. Last week,
witnesses said a man lunged for the controls on a San
Francisco-bound Alaska Airlines jet and fought with the crew before
being subdued with the help of passengers.
</P>
<P>
   Airliners that carry more than 22 passengers are required only
to have a lockable door, with no rules about strength, said Mitch
Barker, spokesman for the Federal Aviation Administration.
</P>
<P>
   ``Even if the door is locked, if there's nothing to prevent
people from pushing through it like a piece of cardboard, that
defeats the purpose,'' said Michael Barr, director of the Aviation
Safety Program at the University of Southern California. ``It
reminds me of the door to the bathroom. It's almost tissue-paper
thin.''
</P>
<P>
   American, Alaska, Northwest, Delta and TWA said Thursday they
are looking for ways to reinforce cockpit doors, especially folding
doors on DC-9s and MD-80s.
</P>
<P>
   The pilots association, which represents 55,000 pilots at 51
airlines, is talking with manufacturers about ways to build
stronger doors in new aircraft, including bulletproof doors and
bulkheads, Mazor said.
</P>
<P>
   Strong doors would act as a barrier to protect the flight crew.
But pilots also worry, Mazor said, that doors allow the flight crew
to escape or be rescued in an emergency.
</P>
<P>
   Passengers who break through the doors can face federal charges
for interfering with the flight crew.
</P>
<P>
   Peter Bradley, a burly 39-year-old Missouri carpenter, is due in
court Friday in San Francisco for a detention hearing after being
charged in the Alaska Airlines incident.
</P>
<P>
   On a March 16 flight from Mexico, Bradley allegedly threw his
shoulder against the locked cockpit door of the MD-80, shouted,
``I'm going to kill you,'' and dived for the controls.
</P>
<P>
   In 1995, there were 90 reports of passengers interfering with a
flight crew, according to the FAA. The numbers rose to 301 in 1998
and to 302 in 1999, the FAA said.
</P>
<P>
   The airline industry is pressing for stiffer penalities for such
``air rage'' incidents. The Air Transport Association issued a
52-page handbook Tuesday to help federal officials prosecute
disruptive passengers.
</P>
<P>
   Under legislation before President Clinton, the civil penalty
for interfering with a flight crew would rise from $1,100 to
$25,000, Barker said.
</P>
<P>
   One American Airlines pilot at SFO, who declined to give his
name, said last night that stronger doors would not stop all
passengers intent on causing havoc.
</P>
<P>
   ``If someone wants to steal your car, they're going to steal
your car,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Barr recalled that airlines once routinely let children into the
cockpit. Some international carriers still leave the cockpit door
open, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think (airlines) never thought in a million years that our
society would get to the point where people would be crashing
through the doors to get to the pilots, which if they do would
ensure their own death,'' Barr said.

 23 YEARS AFTER FILING SUIT, PLAINTIFF FINALLY TASTES VICTORY  &HT;     By HARRIET CHIANG 
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Carolee Brady was awakened early Wednesday morning by a phone
call she'd been waiting for for 23 years.
</P>
<P>
   Her lawyer had called to tell her that after decades of appeals,
stalling and resistance, the federal government had finally agreed
to settle a sex discrimination lawsuit that she filed in 1977.
</P>
<P>
   The payment was a record-shattering $508 million to 1,100 women,
including Brady, who were refused jobs at the now-defunct U.S.
Information Agency because of their gender. It was the largest
award in a sex discrimination case in U.S. history.
</P>
<P>
   Brady packed a bag, said goodbye to her boyfriend and her cats
at her San Francisco home, and flew off to Washington, D.C., to
take part in a nationally covered press conference.
</P>
<P>
   A day later, after seeing her face on the front page of
newspapers and on television, she was back at work in her tiny
office in Pacific Heights, savoring the victory.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is my 15 minutes of fame,'' said Brady, a psychotherapist
studying to get her license. ``It's great. It's exhilarating.''
</P>
<P>
   For years, she had tried to get women's rights groups involved
but they said they didn't want to step into continuing litigation.
She wrote to reporters but with no luck. ``It wasn't sexy,'' she
said. ``It was a bunch of women filing a sex discrimination case.''
It was only when women starting receiving money judgments that the
media showed some interest.
</P>
<P>
   At 52, she is a funny, self-assured, and, as the federal
government learned, tenacious woman who stood up for what she
believed was right.
</P>
<P>
   But back in 1977, she was a relatively naive 29-year-old writer
working in the public information office of the Department of
Labor's Occupational Safety and Health Administration. The feminist
movement was in full bloom but Brady wasn't involved.
</P>
<P>
   She grew up in Mississippi's Bible Belt, got married at 19 and
had no wild ambitions for a career. ``I was raised to be Miss
America,'' she said with a smile that showed off a row of braces on
her teeth. ``I learned to make tea, tap dance and play piano.''
</P>
<P>
   She also was used to being told that as a woman she wasn't good
enough. When she was in high school, she wanted to pole vault, but
her mother told her that girls aren't athletic and shouldn't get
muscles.
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, she was startled by the reception she received when
she went in to interview for a magazine writing job at the U.S.
Information Agency, which, with its subsidiary Voice of America,
disseminated news about the United States throughout the world.
</P>
<P>
   The man who interviewed her, Robert Korengold, told her that the
magazine was modeled after Life magazine and would cover a range of
topics, including soccer. Did she know anything about soccer, he
asked skeptically. ``We need to hire a man for this position,'' she
recalls him saying.
</P>
<P>
   She went away stunned and puzzled. But days later, after talking
to her husband and friends, she got angry. ``He said it
straight-out, flat out, to my face, without a smile or
hesitation,'' Brady recalled grimly.
</P>
<P>
   At first, she went through the administrative maze, hoping at
most to get a job and maybe even an apology.
</P>
<P>
   But when the agency officials resisted, she decided to take them
to court. ``What happened was not right,'' she said in summing up
why she decided to sue the government. ``I felt like I had been
discriminated against, taken advantage of, and a number of other
women had also.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I tried to resolve it with them in a nice way, and they
wouldn't.''
</P>
<P>
   Her husband at the time, who is a lawyer, wrote the complaint
for her _ it was filed under her married name, Carolee Brady
Hartman. Through one of his friends, she got a young lawyer named
Bruce FredricksonCQ &LR;  to take her case.
</P>
<P>
   Fredrickson was able to track down other women who had received
the same treatment at the agency, which had a reputation of being
mired in tradition and bureaucracy.
</P>
<P>
   Brady's suit became a class action, representing 1,100 women who
had been turned down for jobs as writers, reporters and technicians
in favor of men who were frequently less qualified. In 1984, a
federal judge found the agency liable for sex discrimination. But
the litigation dragged on for 16 more years while the agency filed
appeals and insisted on individual trials for each of the class
members.
</P>
<P>
   There were times when Brady got depressed and thought about
giving up. ``It's like having a relative on death row,'' she said.
``It's frustrating. You never know.''
</P>
<P>
   But she and the women pressed on with their case, sensing that
the government was hoping that they would get tired and go away.
</P>
<P>
   In the meantime, Brady went on with her life, earning a Ph.D. in
English, getting divorced and falling in love with a new man. She
and her partner moved to San Francisco, where she is now studying
to be a psychotherapist.
</P>
<P>
   She has a few clients who she sees in an office so small that it
barely fits a sofa, a bunch of big pillows and a couple of soft
teddy bears in the corner.
</P>
<P>
   After trying out an assortment of careers, she says she has
finally found what works for her. ``This is a room where people can
come in and sit down and say what they feel and what's really going
on,'' she said. ``I really love that.''
</P>
<P>
   With the money she expects to receive from the settlement _
$461,818 _ she plans to help clients who otherwise couldn't afford
to see a psychotherapist. As a personal splurge, she wants to buy a
big television and indulge in her love of the small screen.
</P>
<P>
   As much as she savors her victory, Brady firmly believes that
the discrimination she and scores of other women faced still
exists.
</P>
<P>
   Although women are far better off now, she said they still face
a subtle bias that is often hard to prove in court.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's just an inherent, ingrained idea in many people that a
woman can't be president, a woman can't do a traditionally male
occupation,'' she said. ``I think it's better, but (discrimination)
is still possible.''

BRUINS FUTURE BRIGHT
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JON WILNER  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUBURN HILLS, Mich. _ Every time he thinks about the future,
UCLA coach Steve Lavin scans the roster and smiles. There is only
one senior, Sean Farnham, and he isn't a major contributor.
</P>
<P>
   ``The next two, three, four years,'' Lavin has said several
times, ``UCLA basketball has a bright future.''
</P>
<P>
   Maybe not. In the aftermath of UCLA's 80-56 Sweet 16 loss to
Iowa State on Thursday, several players said they will consider
their options before committing to another season in Westwood:
</P>
<P>
   __ Sources close to sophomore forward Jerome Moiso expect him to
enter the NBA Draft in June, but it's not the slam dunk many
thought when the season began. Moiso's February struggles _ he
reached double figures in two of nine games _ caused him to
reconsider.
</P>
<P>
   ``If he's a lottery pick, he's leaving,'' a source said. ``If
not, he might come back.''
</P>
<P>
   If Moiso isn't a lottery pick, he's at least a first-rounder.
</P>
<P>
   Asked if he'll leave school, Moiso looked at his feet and
mumbled: ``I need time to think.''
</P>
<P>
   Another factor could influence Moiso: He is struggling
academically.
</P>
<P>
   __ Forward JaRon Rush, who probably isn't much better than a
high second-round pick, did not commit to returning for his junior
year.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have no idea right now,'' Rush said. ``I have to talk to my
family, then I'll decide.''
</P>
<P>
   Money could be a factor. Rush owes the NCAA $6,525 for
violations that resulted in a 24-game suspension. (The money
actually goes to a charity of UCLA's choice.) He also must pay
legal fees.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think he'll come back,'' said Rush's mother, Glenda.
``Another year will do him good because he missed so much time this
year.''
</P>
<P>
   Forward Matt Barnes, who was unhappy with playing time behind
Moiso and Dan Gadzuric, said he plans to return next season _ but
not necessarily to the basketball team.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's up in the air,'' Barnes said. ``I'm thinking about
playing football. I have to talk to my family and coach (Bob)
Toledo, but that's a big option for me this spring.''
</P>
<P>
   Barnes was a talented receiver in high school. With Brad Melsby
and Danny Farmer graduating, there's playing time available.
</P>
<P>
   Asked if he might transfer, Barnes said: ``I don't think so. I'm
going to stick it out here.''
</P>
<P>
   __ Gadzuric also is considering a jump to the pros, but he's
considered less likely to leave than Moiso. Two reasons: Gadzuric
enjoys school more than Moiso, and his skills are not as refined.
NBA scouts consider him an awesome athlete with few moves and
tendinitis-plagued knees.
</P>
<P>
   Would he be a first-round pick? Probably.
</P>
<P>
   Would he be a lottery pick? Doubtful.
</P>
<P>
   Another year to develop his low-post game would help his draft
status immensely.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think he'll stay in school, but the word is that his
(European) advisers are thinking hard about the NBA,'' an NBA scout
said.
</P>
<P>
   Freshman forward Jason Kapono said he expects to return for next
season.

BUCHANAN SAYS U.S. MUST RESPOND TO OIL `CONSPIRACY'
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     By CARLA MARINUCCI and JOHN WILDERMUTH 
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
 &LR;   &LR;  SAN FRANCISCO _ Pat Buchanan, the Reform Party presidential
hopeful, charged American political leaders Thursday with sitting
on their hands while oil-producing countries engage in a
``price-rigging conspiracy'' to gouge American consumers for
billions of dollars at the gas pumps.
<P>
   Charging that Mexico, Saudi Arabia and Iraq, are ``engaged in a
trade war against this country,'' Buchanan called for the United
States ``to retaliate with economic weapons'' against oil-producers
that he said are withholding oil to jack up prices.
</P>
<P>
   ``As president of the United States, I would cut off all foreign
aid ... to any nation which conspired to withhold oil and gouge the
American people,'' the fiery former host of CNN's ``Crossfire''
said. ``I would put tariffs on all those (responsible) nations.''
</P>
<P>
   The tough talk from the Republican-turned-Reform candidate came
in San Francisco Thursday, where Buchanan appeared at a Reform
Party fund-raiser. In good spirits, and wearing an eye-opening
purple tie and lavender shirt, Buchanan downplayed rifts that have
torn the Reform Party, culminating in the recent defection of its
most famous elected leader, Minnesota Gov. Jesse Ventura. ``He said
it was a dysfunctional party ... (but) he left and it's been
functioning very, very well,'' Buchanan said.
</P>
<P>
   Buchanan _ who will deliver the keynote address at an anti-war
conference in San Mateo Friday _ insisted the presidential race
this fall will be a three-way contest fought ``in the court of
public opinion.'' But his greatest potential this time around is
clearly as a spoiler, the candidate who can siphon off votes,
particularly from Texas Gov. George W. Bush, the presumptive GOP
nominee.
</P>
<P>
   And with his feisty words on the gas crisis, Buchanan touched on
a hot-button issue that threatens to put an otherwise placid
electorate up in arms _ even in booming economic times. Armed with
his populist message, Buchanan has signaled that he means to remain
a thorn in the side of Democrat Vice President Al Gore and Bush
until the election.
</P>
<P>
   In a later interview with The Chronicle, Buchanan threw jabs at
both major party leaders. He:
</P>
<P>
   -- Predicted that Bush, who is anti-abortion, should prepare for
a mass exodus of conservative GOP followers at the Republican
National Convention should he announce a pro-choice running mate
like Pennsylvania Gov. Tom Ridge. ``They should get out of the way
of the exits ... because the pro-life people would be deserting in
droves,'' Buchanan said.
</P>
<P>
   -- Said that, while he is pleased Bush is being ``home-schooled
in foreign policy,'' Buchanan doesn't intend to let the Texas
governor off the hook in a presidential debate. ``The first
question,'' Buchanan said with a mischievous grin, ``is, `Who's the
prime minister of Estonia?'''
</P>
<P>
   -- Vowed to continue his own fight to be on stage with both Gore
and Bush in nationally televised presidential debates in the fall.
And once he's there, boring will be banished, he promised. ``You'll
be able to scalp tickets,'' he said with a laugh.
</P>
<P>
   -- Asked about Gore's attempt to adopt campaign finance reform
as an issue, merely Burst into sustained laughter. ``It's great to
know that there's still entertainment in politics,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Buchanan seized the opportunity in San Francisco to address
issues that have been the bread and butter of his past political
efforts, such as immigration.
</P>
<P>
   In a departure from Gore and Bush, who have courted Silicon
Valley, Buchanan called for a freeze on the H1-B visas Silicon
Valley companies want expanded to bring more technically trained
workers into the United States.
</P>
<P>
   ``The first claim on those jobs should belong to young people
and American workers,'' Buchanan said. ``If (Silicon Valley
companies) have to raise pay a little to attract them, so be it.''
</P>
<P>
   Buchanan also called for rolling back legal immigration to the
United States, now about 1 million people per year, to 250,000 or
300,000 for at least five years. That would give the country time
to deal with the new residents and help avoid what he called the
``Balkanization'' he has seen in other countries with unassimilated
minorities.
</P>
<P>
   Buchanan minced no words on illegal immigration.
</P>
<P>
   ``I will stop illegal immigration cold if it means putting the
82nd Airborne on the California border,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   But Buchanan got most fired up on the gas issue, saying that
Mexico, a NAFTA trade partner, appears to be colluding with the
Persian Gulf nations, ``who we defend with American blood and
treasure.''
</P>
<P>
   He called for exploratory drilling in the Arctic National
Wildlife Refuge in Alaska, tariffs against OPEC nations and an end
to all foreign aid to those countries until oil production is
increased.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd tell them that if they don't change, find someone else to
defend them,'' said Buchanan, who confessed to driving a
15-miles-per-gallon Lincoln Navigator SUV. ``They'd pump so much
oil we'd be drowning in it.''
</P>
<P>
   Buchanan admitted that getting the voters to pay attention to
foreign affairs at a time of growing prosperity is going to be a
chore.
</P>
<P>
   But the current good times won't last forever, he said, and
people have to be prepared for a time when what he sees as an
overpriced stock market, a growing trade deficit and a variety of
foreign concerns have to be addressed.
</P>
<P>
   ``Those chickens are coming home to roost, maybe not before
November, but they're coming home to roost,'' Buchanan said.

   &UR; c. 2000, Houston Chronicle &LR;  &QL; 
AUBURN HILLS, Mich. _ This is how they beat you.
</P>
<P>
   Not with a hammer, but with a jolt of electricity that zaps down
your legs, up your spine, leaves your hair standing on end and your
brain scrambled like a dish of yesterday's eggs.
</P>
<P>
   Not by methodically drumming you out of the building, but by
frantically and relentlessly running you down until your breath is
going to give out, your heart is going to explode and you simply
roll over and surrender in the way a rabbit does to a hungry
cheetah.
</P>
<P>
   Remember the scene in the movie where Indiana Jones is sprinting
through the temple ahead of the giant boulder?
</P>
<P>
   Well, this time Michigan State was the boulder and Syracuse
couldn't get away fast enough.
</P>
<P>
   Orange crushed, 75-58. Nothing left but the pulp.
</P>
<P>
   It wasn't that the Spartans won the game but how they won it
that made you rub your eyes in disbelief.
</P>
<P>
   By playing the second half like a runaway tractor-trailer going
down the side of a mountain. By tearing through the last six
minutes like Olympian Michael Johnson with a rocket on his back.
</P>
<P>
   ``We finally played our game,'' said All-America point guard
Mateen Cleaves. ``We sank our teeth into it.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, like Hannibal Lecter.
</P>
<P>
   It was a tie ballgame when Jason Hart twisted through the lane
to hit a tough bucket for Syracuse with 5:55 left on the clock. It
was nothing but Michigan State the rest of the way. If there hadn't
been a second game scheduled between Iowa State and UCLA, the
Spartans might still be out there on the floor of the Palace
scoring again and again and again.
</P>
<P>
   Michigan State outscored Syracuse 49-18 over the last 18 minutes
of the game and finished with a 17-0 burst.
</P>
<P>
   ``We finally got aggressive,'' Cleaves said. ``We finally got
all of us into the game with the kind of intensity that we needed
and starting cooking.''
</P>
<P>
   They cooked like popcorn inside a microwave, exploding in every
direction all at once. They were Morris Peterson suddenly finding
the range on his 3-point shooting as if he were merely trying to
toss tennis balls through a hula hoop, finishing with 21 points.
They were Cleaves bouncing back from an 0-for-6 first half to slice
down the lane and slither through the cracks in the defense for 10
points and seven assists.
</P>
<P>
   They were center Andre Hutson winning a night-long wrestling
match with his counterpart Etan Thomas. They were Charlie Bell
playing through the pain of a balky knee to get his hand on so many
passes and come up with all of those loose balls down the stretch.
</P>
<P>
   Just when you thought that all of those second-chance NCAA
Tournament pools were going to be turned into more office confetti,
up popped a No. 1 seed that finally played like a No. 1 seed, and
the madness of this March was temporarily, at least, brought to a
halt.
</P>
<P>
   All of this after trailing by 10 at halftime and by 14 early in
the second half as Cleaves, Peterson and Bell, the so-called
Flintstones, were looking like rubble.
</P>
<P>
   Where does it come from?
</P>
<P>
   ``I wouldn't call it fear,'' said Cleaves. ``It's more a sense
of urgency for the seniors, knowing that this could be the last 20
minutes you'll ever play in this uniform.''
</P>
<P>
   It came from a halftime speech by Cleaves that was part Vince
Lombardi and part Papa Smurf for its combination of inspirational
message and blue language.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wouldn't say it was my best speech ever,'' Cleaves said.
``But I did say some of the worst stuff I've ever said right to the
faces of some of the guys. I don't mind if you go out there and
miss shots or you try to make plays and don't get them done. But I
had a feeling at halftime that a lot of our guys weren't into the
game and giving it their best.''
</P>
<P>
   They are a team that seems to need a little adversity poured
into its gas tank to make the engine run. Of the teams left
standing in the Tournament, they are now the slight favorite to win
it all at the Final Four in Indianapolis. But at 29-7, they are by
no means an awe-inspiring bunch.
</P>
<P>
   That is, until Cleaves kicks them in the pants and then the
Spartans kick it into another gear.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's why Mateen and I get along so well,'' said Michigan State
coach Tom Izzo. ``If I don't do my job, he does it for me.''
</P>
<P>
   And they lift off faster than the space shuttle.
</P>
<P>
   The Spartans hit six straight 3s, including a trio of killers by
Peterson. They brought the home crowd to life and used their own
rush of adrenaline to swamp Syracuse.
</P>
<P>
   Next up is Iowa State.
</P>
<P>
   ``We just wanted to keep the train rolling,'' said Cleaves.
</P>
<P>
   And the Orangemen tied to the tracks.
</P>

 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By CARLTON THOMPSON  
 c. 2000, Houston Chronicle  
PORT ST. LUCIE, Fla. _ It's one of the biggest mysteries in the
history of Houston sports.
<TEXT>
<P>
   Why is Mike Hampton, after winning a franchise-record 22 games
in 1999, now wearing a New York Mets uniform? All sorts of theories
exist, ranging from the thought-provoking to the ridiculous.
</P>
<P>
   Was it all about money? Probably not, since the two sides didn't
discuss terms of a possible contract extension before the National
League Cy Young Award runner-up was traded to the Mets.
</P>
<P>
   Were there personal problems? Hampton says some of his best
relationships were made in the Astros organization and that he
didn't leave any burned bridges. And it certainly didn't seem he
had left enemies in Houston as he traded hugs with several of his
former teammates before Thursday's exhibition game.
</P>
<P>
   All comments on the parting point to philosophical differences
regarding the direction of the Astros.
</P>
<P>
   This much is certain: The Astros were interested in extending
Hampton's contract beyond the 2000 season, after which he could
have become a free agent. But the winds of change began blowing
after an offseason meeting with Hampton, his agent Mark Rogers and
Astros general manager Gerry Hunsicker.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just wanted to make sure that the direction we were going in
was going to be the right way,'' Hampton said Thursday. ``We never
talked any terms. We had a meeting, and I decided that I was going
to wait until after the (2000) season to make my decision. It was
their option to either wait for my decision or to try to do
something, and they did.''
</P>
<P>
   Obviously concerned about the possibility of losing Hampton on
the free-agent market without compensation, Hunsicker engineered a
trade that sent him and outfielder Derek Bell to New York for
pitcher Octavio Dotel, center fielder Roger Cedeno and pitching
prospect Kyle Kessel.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought I would have been there this year, but I didn't want
to make a decision if I wasn't sure which direction we were going,
and after that meeting I was still unsure about their plans,''
Hampton said. ``I was just making sure we were going to have a
chance to win a World Series for years to come, not just a one-year
deal.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I signed somewhere it was going to be a five- or six-year
deal, and that's a long time to play somewhere, and if you don't
have a chance to win that can be pretty miserable. That's what it
all boils down to. I want to play somewhere where I'm going to have
a chance to win every year.''
</P>
<P>
   Since the trade, Hunsicker's stance has been to keep
confidential the details of his meeting with Hampton and his agent,
as well as other factors that might have led to the trade.
</P>
<P>
   But he defended the Astros' record in response to Hampton's
assessment of the team's chances to win a World Series.
</P>
<P>
   ``I find those comments disheartening because we've been pretty
successful around here, and I'm committed to continuing to be
successful here,'' said Hunsicker, whose moves have helped the
Astros compile the third-best record in the majors since 1996.
</P>
<P>
   ``We may not have the money to keep an All-Star at every
position, but I fully expect to compete, and I fully expect to be
successful here,'' Hunsicker said. ``If a player chooses to have a
different opinion because we don't spend lavishly, and comes to the
conclusion that we're not going to have a competitive team, I take
exception to that.''
</P>
<P>
   Hampton pointed to two moves that helped form his opinion: the
trade that sent catcher Brad Ausmus to Detroit prior to the 1999
season and the deal that shipped center fielder Carl Everett to
Boston this past winter.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you look at it, we probably got rid of the best catcher
(Ausmus) in the organization's history, and then we got rid of the
guy (Everett) who was probably our MVP last year,'' Hampton said.
``How many more good players can you get rid of before you have no
chance?
</P>
<P>
   ``I just didn't want the trend to continue, and when I saw it
going that way I was like, `Man, if we continue to get rid of these
type of players
</P>
<P>
   then what's next? Is it going to be me, Shane (Reynolds) and
Jose (Lima) surrounded by a bunch of Triple-A players, just trying
to make a profit?' I don't like that.''
</P>
<P>
   The Astros will begin the 2000 season with a payroll about $9
million lower than it was at the end of the 1999 season.
</P>
<P>
   However, Hunsicker and owner Drayton McLane Jr. have said they
have the flexibility to add to the payroll during the season and
have indicated the final total could be similar to 1999's.
</P>
<P>
   ``Again, I take exception to (comments) that we're not going to
do everything we can to win,'' Hunsicker said. ``If part of the
definition is spending a lot of money, that's not going to happen
around here, but that is not my definition of being committed to
winning.''
</P>
<P>
   It should be noted that Hampton also has declined the Mets'
attempts to work out a contract extension.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know where they get all of this stuff from,'' Hampton
said. ``My agent hasn't said it, and the Mets haven't said it. I
don't care to be the highest-paid player in baseball. I just want
to win.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm going to wait and weigh the offers after the season, and
I'm going to base my decisions the same way I would have if I had
been in Houston. I'm going to wait and see where these guys (the
Mets) are going.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not going to go to a place that has the most money; I'm
going to go to the place that has the best chance to win. I haven't
made an incredible amount of money, but I've made good enough money
to where I don't have to worry about it. I haven't won that ring
yet, and that's why I'm going to go where I have the best
opportunity to do that.''
</P>
<P>
   And, in a great irony, Hampton said Houston still is a
possibility.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't rule anything out,'' said Hampton, who still plans to
reside in Houston. ``If I feel they're going to do the right things
and that they're going to have a chance to win, I don't have a
problem going back there. I don't think I've worn out my welcome.''
</P>
<P>
   Because of baseball's tampering rules, Hunsicker declined
comment on the possibility of Hampton returning to Houston. The GM
did acknowledge that no bridges have been burned.

UCLA SEASON FINISHED BY LOPSIDED LOSS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JON WILNER  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUBURN HILLS, Mich. _ It began a month ago, quietly and without
warning. It gathered steam as February faded to March, then turned
awesome last weekend. But UCLA's late-season charge ended Thursday
night with a resounding thud, as the Bruins wilted in the face of
an opponent that was quicker, tougher _ much, much tougher _ and
immaculately prepared.
</P>
<P>
   Iowa State's Cyclones took away everything the Bruins did in
building their eight-game winning streak, and because of that, UCLA
departed the NCAA Tournament with an 80-56 loss before 21,214 in
The Palace of Auburn Hills.
</P>
<P>
   The defeat was nearly as thorough as UCLA's 35-point victory
over Maryland in the second round. The Bruins trailed by 12 points
at halftime and 17 early in the second half. With four minutes
left, the Cyclones were in complete command 70-49 and UCLA's
cheering section was silent.
</P>
<P>
   The Cyclones shot 51.7 percent from the field and held UCLA to
33.9 percent. They also outrebounded the taller Bruins 43-32 and
allowed only one UCLA player, forward Jerome Moiso (15 points), to
score in double figures.
</P>
<P>
   Iowa State All-American Marcus Fizer was good but not great,
scoring 16 points and grabbing nine rebounds. But the best player
on the floor was Cyclones point guard Jamaal Tinsley, who
penetrated at will, controlled the tempo and got the Cyclones easy
baskets just when they needed them most. He finished with 14
points, 11 assists and nine rebounds.
</P>
<P>
   It was also a victory for Iowa State coach Larry Eustachy and
his staff, which watched the Bruins devastate Maryland and built a
game plan to nullify everything UCLA likes to do.
</P>
<P>
   The Cyclones challenged every pass and every shot. Their
defenders shadowed Earl Watson the moment he crossed midcourt, thus
preventing the open 3-pointers Watson used to bury Maryland. Stocky
and low to the ground, the Cyclones also grabbed every loose ball.
And their transition defense was superb, allowing UCLA just two
alley-oop dunks and a meager seven fast-break points. Forced to
work for every shot, the Bruins struggled. They took a few wild
shots and had the ball ripped from their grasp several times.
</P>
<P>
   The first half was taut and brisk. The teams exchanged baskets
for 10 minutes, then Iowa State made the first spurt of the game.
It started when Brandon Hawkins, of Fontana, scored from the lane
to give the Cyclones a 22-18 lead. Hawkins pushed the lead to six
when he converted an errant Moiso pass into a layup. Matt Barnes
responded with a wild shot from the left wing (he was removed from
the game immediately) and Kantrail Horton buried a 3-pointer to
give the Cyclones a 27-18 advantage with eight minutes left.
</P>
<P>
   The Bruins countered with two quick baskets: Dan Gadzuric made a
layup, then Jason Kapono buried a 3-pointer from the right wing,
trimming the deficit to 27-23. The Bruins would score two baskets
in the next seven minutes as Iowa State took control.
</P>
<P>
   The Cyclones botched several opportunities to expand their
lead,but Michael Nurse's 3-pointer with five minutes left sparked a
surge. AJaRon Rush turnover became a Fizer jumper on the fast
break, and Tinsley drained a 3-pointer. Suddenly, Iowa State had a
36-25 lead with just over three minutes remaining.
</P>
<P>
   The teams combined for 12 scoreless possessions, until Tinsley
hit two free throws for a 38-25 lead. Stevie Johnson tipped in a
Tinsley miss for a 15-point advantage, but Watson's 3-pointer at
the buzzer made it 40-28 when halftime arrived.
</P>
<P>
   The second half began as the first ended. Nurse hit a 3-pointer,
then ripped the ball from Watson, leading to a Fizer turnaround and
a 45-30 Iowa State lead. Billy Knight hit a 3-pointer for the
Bruins, but the Cyclones kept coming. Nurse hit another 3, then
Johnson's free throws with 17:30 left gave them a 17-point lead at
almost the exact moment Iowa State held a 16-point lead against
UCLA in the 1997 Sweet 16.
</P>
<P>
   That UCLA team responded with a furious charge. This one did
not. Moiso's short jumper slowed the Cyclones, but only for a
minute. Tinsley slashed into the lane and found Johnson for a
layup.
</P>
<P>
   The Bruins' best chance came with 12:33 left, when Fizer
committed his third foul and departed. The Bruins trailed 54-41 at
the time but could get no closer with the nation's best player on
the bench. Their problems had little to do with defense _ Iowa
State scored just three points _ and everything to do with offense.
They simply could not score. No open jumpers. No penetration. When
Fizer returned four minutes later, the Bruins had scored just two
points and Iowa State had increased its lead by one.

ALBUQUERQUE, N.M. _ Oxygen, anyone?

   LSU was obviously hurting, but it was unclear whether it was the
altitude or Wisconsin's attitude that hurt the Tigers most.
</P>
<P>
   Credit the Badgers.

   LSU, a team designed for a track meet, found itself in a
wrestling match with Wisconsin and had the breath squeezed out of

the NCAA Tournament's West Regional semifinal doubleheader Thursday
before 16,004 at the Pit.
</P>
<P>
   Wisconsin (21-13) will face Big Ten rival Purdue on Saturday for
a berth in the Final Four.
</P>
<P>
   Early in the second half, the Tigers (28-6) were dragging and
everyone could see it.
</P>
<P>
   ``That confused look is almost a sense of frustration,''
Wisconsin forward Andy Kowske said. ``Coming into the game,
(opponents) know our defense is going to be tough, but it is
probably tougher than they think when they go up against it. (LSU)
knew we were going to double the post, and it worked (anyway).''
</P>
<P>
   LSU's inside tandem of Stromile Swift and Jabari Smith topped
the Tigers with 12 points each, but Swift could get just five shots
from the field against the smothering Badgers defense and Smith
went 5-for-12 from the floor.
</P>
<P>
   ``Their defensive scheme was great,'' Smith said. ``I give their
defense a lot of credit. They took away the things we like to do.''
</P>
<P>
   The Badgers, who controlled the game from the start with their
stingy defense, took over on the scoreboard late in the first half
and held on in the second despite a couple of LSU runs.
</P>
<P>
   Trailing 38-19 with 12 minutes remaining, LSU put together its
best run of the game. But the 10-2 burst was the next-to-last gasp
of a fading team.
</P>
<P>
   Smith was the key, following a Colis Temple 3-pointer with two
buckets inside for seven straight Tigers points. Kirk Penney broke
the string with jumper, but the 6-11 Smith answered quickly with a
long 3-pointer to get LSU within 40-29 with 9:24 to play.
</P>
<P>
   The Tigers would not score again until there was just over four
minutes left, as Wisconsin ran off seven straight points to build
an 18-point lead.
</P>
<P>
   The Tigers had one more spurt in them, but it would not be
enough.
</P>
<P>
   Nine consecutive points, capped by a steal and layup by Jermaine
Williams, cut the lead to 47-38 with 2{ minutes left.
</P>
<P>
   Jon Bryant, who led Wisconsin with 16 points, drilled a
3-pointer for the Badgers, and LSU resorted to launching off-target
3-pointers in a futile attempt to come back.
</P>
<P>
   ``When the game got out of hand and we got down by 15, 16, they
started running their offense with nine or 10 passes and we
couldn't get back into the game,'' Swift said. ``We just didn't
compete like we are used to, but they had a lot to do with that.''
</P>
<P>
   LSU played like it was running around in a Louisiana swamp in
the first half.
</P>
<P>
   The Tigers scored a measly 14 points and committed almost as
many turnovers (14) as they attempted shots (15).
</P>
<P>
   The five field goals made and the 14 points were the worst in a
half for LSU this season. At one point LSU did not attempt a shot
in a 4:52 span.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was disappointed because I knew we were a better team than
we showed,'' Swift said. ``We just didn't come out and play LSU
basketball in the first half.''
</P>
<P>
   It's not like Wisconsin was lighting up the scoreboard on the
other end.
</P>
<P>
   The Badgers were worse from the floor than the Tigers, with
their 9-for-30 start (30 percent). But Wisconsin had only three
turnovers, and that accounted for the difference in field-goal
attempts (30-15).
</P>
<P>
   The Badgers kept grinding away until they put together a closing
spurt to take control.
</P>
<P>
   After LSU took a 14-11 lead on a Lamont Roland free throw with
5:03 left, Wisconsin scored the final 11 points of the period to
take a 22-14 margin into the intermission.
</P>
<P>
   ``We shook a lot of balls loose (in the first half), and there
weren't many openings,'' said Wisconsin coach Dick Bennett, who
believed his team's defensive effort in the first half was its best
all season. ``We were about as active as we've been.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you get into a game and you see you've got a team, that
just feeds your defensive confidence.''

BRUINS ABLE TO BOTHER FIZER
</HEADLINE>
 THIS REPLACES UCNOTE (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JON WILNER  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &LR; AUBURN HILLS, Mich. _ To defend Iowa State All-American Marcus
Fizer, UCLA grabbed a page from one of its most successful
playbooks in recent memory.
</P>
<P>
   The Bruins defended Fizer like they defended Arkansas All-
American Corliss Williamson in the 1995 NCAA title game. Both Fizer
and Williamson are power forwards in the classic sense _ thick
bodied, physical, mobile, with playing styles similar to Charles
Barkley.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think Marcus Fizer is as dominant as anyone in the
country,'' Bruins coach Steve Lavin said before the 80-56 loss to
Iowa State on Thursday. ``He's very versatile, like Barkley. He can
step away from thebasket and create for himself. But he can also
post you up down low andgo to work on you. He's a nightmare.''
</P>
<P>
   The one thing UCLA's big men have that Fizer doesn't is
length.Jerome Moiso is 6-10, Dan Gadzuric is 6-11, and both have
long arms.
</P>
<P>
   Just as the Bruins successfully forced the 6-7 Williamson to
shoot over 7-foot center George Zidek _ Williamson scored just 12
points_ so did they try to force Fizer to shoot over Moiso and
Gadzuric.
</P>
<P>
   When Fizer got the ball in the low post, the Bruins backed off,
played a perimeter-style defense that emphasized lateral movement,
and tried to deny him a direct path to the basket.
</P>
<P>
   It worked. Fizer scored just 16 points and grabbed nine
rebounds. Half his points came in the opening five minutes. After
that, he was relatively quiet.
</P>
<P>
   But the Bruins could not contain Iowa State point guard Jamaal
Tinsley, who had 14 points, 11 rebounds, nine assists and four
steals.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's a real crafty point guard,'' Lavin said. ``It was the
biggest concern we had, keeping the point guard in front. He still
had theability to break down our defense.''
</P>
<P>
   __ Return trip: UCLA freshman forward Jason Kapono played in The
Palace last spring in the Magic Johnson Roundball Classic, a high
school all-star game. He recalled scoring 20 or 22 points in a
victory. Cincinnati's DerMarr Johnson and Kentucky's Keith Bogans
also participated.
</P>
<P>
   Kapono hoped the experience would help his shooting touch
Thursday night, but it did not. He was 1-of-4 from 3-point range
and scored eight points. His misfires were contagious. Five days
after their hot-shooting game against Maryland, the Bruins hit just
23.5 percent of their 3-pointers against the Cyclones.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was out of rhythm,'' Kapono said. ``I couldn't find the
rhythm of the game. They played pressure defense, and it got to
us.''

ELSTER FIRST ON DODGERS' SHORT LIST
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BRIAN DOHN  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   VERO BEACH, Fla. _ Kevin Elster came to spring training to win a
job on the Dodgers' roster. He not only realized his goal but went
a step further: He's slated to be the starting shortstop when the
Dodgers open the season April 3 at Montreal.
</P>
<P>
   Elster, a favorite of manager Davey Johnson from their days
together with the Mets, impressed Dodgers officials enough with his
glove and bat _ despite his .233 average this spring.
</P>
<P>
   With Elster being given the starting position, it's likely Alex
Cora, given a chance to win the starting job at the start of the
spring, will be optioned to Triple-A Albuquerque.
</P>
<P>
   Manager Davey Johnson's only comment about the shortstop
situation was, ``(Elster) is playing well.''
</P>
<P>
   Because Elster, 35, was a nonroster invitee to spring training,
the Dodgers had to clear room on their 40-man roster for him.
Elster, a savvy veteran, understands the meaning of the move but
said he hasn't spoken with Johnson about his role.
</P>
<P>
   ``I still really don't know what it means, but I think it's
good,'' Elster said. ``I'm pretty excited . . . excited to play for
the Dodgers. The hard part, to me, is beginning now. We have a big,
big season to play with a lot of challenges ahead.''
</P>
<P>
   Elster hasn't dazzled this spring, but he hasn't needed to. As
he's done throughout his career, he's been steady in the field. He
has made one error while a shaky Cora has turned in some wonderful
defensive plays but committed a team-high four errors.
</P>
<P>
   Offensively, scouts say Elster has demonstrated good bat speed
and produced runs. He has one home run, six RBI and scored four
times. He's also tied for second on the team with six walks and has
a .382 on-base percentage. Johnson often talks about the value of
the No. 8 hitter prolonging an inning so the pitcher doesn't lead
off, and Elster has done that well.
</P>
<P>
   He hit .252 with 24 homers and 99 RBI with Texas in `96.
</P>
<P>
   His base salary is $300,000, but he can make an additional
$400,000 with performance-related incentives.
</P>
<P>
   ``I came in with the attitude of whatever role Davey wants me to
play, I'll play that role,'' Elster said. ``Maybe I'm a little
quick with the bat right now. I'm making good contact. There's some
days when I feel incredibly locked in. I'm very happy with the way
I feel at the plate. I thought it would take a little longer.''
</P>
<P>
   Conversely, Cora hasn't answered questions about his offense.
He's batting just .176 and has yet to drive in a run.
</P>
<P>
   The Dodgers also added right-handed pitcher Mike Fetters, a Van
Nuys native and Pepperdine product to the 40-man roster. To make
room for Fetters and Elster, the Dodgers designated third baseman
Kevin Orie and right-hander Dan Naulty for assignment. The Dodgers
have 10 days to trade them or risk losing them to waivers.
</P>
<P>
   ``We could have waited on that, but in all fairness to Orie and
Naulty, we had to do it now,'' Malone said. ``It gives us time to
try and find another major-league home for them. I think there's
enough interest they could be traded.''

BRUINS GET LESSON FROM PROFESSOR FIZER
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By KAREN CROUSE  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &LR; AUBURN HILLS, Mich. _ This doesn't have to be the end. To the
contrary, the UCLA basketball team's NCAA Tournament run, which was
halted by Iowa State 80-56 Thursday night in a Midwest Regional
semifinal game, could be the start of something extra special.
</P>
<P>
   But only if Bruins sophomores Jerome Moiso, Dan Gadzuric and
JaRon Rush learned anything from Iowa State's stellar center Marcus
Fizer. Every time the junior fleeced Moiso, frisked Gadzuric or
fettered Rush, it was as if he was sending the trio a message:
</P>
<P>
   Stay in school. Concentrate on upper-division college basketball
before graduating to the pros.
</P>
<P>
   Fizer last year bore only a slight resemblance to the goliath
who stoned the Bruins in a very public flogging at The Palace. He
didn't have the muscles he flexed against UCLA. Or the serviceable
outside shot that put would-be defenders back on their heels.
</P>
<P>
   He was prone to passiveness, like Moiso. His body was an
unfinished sculpture, like Gadzuric's. He sometimes forced things,
like Rush, instead of letting the game come to him.
</P>
<P>
   In his sophomore season, Fizer didn't always bear down like a
cyclone. His focus, like his waistline, was diffused. He was good
enough to be a first-team All-Big 12 selection and probably good
enough to be a mid-to-late first-round NBA draft pick.
</P>
<P>
   But Fizer wasn't a phenomenon by any stretch of the definition.
His collegiate career to that point had been perfectly fine, but it
wasn't fabled.
</P>
<P>
   He grew into a legend by staying put. Fizer, 21, forsook his
summer for an intense conditioning regimen that added 17 pounds to
his frame and shrank his body fat from 16 percent to nine percent.
</P>
<P>
   When he wasn't working on his body, the 6-foot-8 player worked
on his outside shot. Through sweat and seasoning he turned himself
into arguably the best player not only in his conference but in the
country.
</P>
<P>
   Not coincidentally, in the same span Iowa State evolved from a
.500 team to an NCAA Tournament Elite Eight participant. Fizer put
the Cyclones directly in the path of local favorite and No. 1 seed
Michigan State with a 16-point, nine-rebound performance against
the Bruins (21-12), who have no reason to hang their heads.
</P>
<P>
   After all, it took a giant to snap UCLA's winning streak at
eight.
</P>
<P>
   The hope here is Moiso, Gadzuric and Rush, before deciding their
futures, will ponder how it is Fizer and Iowa State came so far so
fast.
</P>
<P>
   If UCLA's 8-1 stretch run proved anything, it's that the Bruins
are bearing down on college basketball's summit. They could get
there as soon as next year, but only if Moiso, Gadzuric and Rush
stay put. With those three and incoming recruit T.J. Cummings, too,
the Bruins would be a popular choice to rule Bracketville in 2001.
</P>
<P>
   If the vacillating Bruins leave, UCLA will weather their
departures (under coach Steve Lavin, the Bruins have shown
themselves to be nothing if not resilient). And besides, Duke did
all right in year 1 AD (after underclassmen defections).
</P>
<P>
   It's hard for the trio to see the common sense for all the
dollars, but Moiso, Gadzuric and Rush would help themselves more by
staying than going. The NBA money is enticing, to be sure,
especially to someone facing a pile of legal bills as is Rush.
</P>
<P>
   However, the four-games-in-seven-nights treadmill can wear down
one's spirit quickly. It's more exhausting than trying to stop
Fizer. A few months at that unforgiving pace can make a player
yearn for the relatively carefree days of fall and winter and
spring quarters.
</P>
<P>
   Moiso, Gadzuric and Rush can afford another year of maturing. It
would behoove Moiso to work on his consistency, his focus and his
defense; Gadzuric, his post moves and fundamentals; and Rush, his
patience and discipline.
</P>
<P>
   JaRon rushed his shots against the Cyclones; he put up quick
3-pointers instead of using the clock and his teammates to optimal
advantage and finished with a very quiet six points.
</P>
<P>
   Moiso, who gave up 30 pounds to Fizer, couldn't get around him,
so he tried, in vain, to shoot over him. The result? The only thing
worse than Moiso's shooting in the first half (he misfired on 6 of
8 attempts) was his passing. He had as many turnovers (four) as
points as Iowa State bolted to a 12-point lead.
</P>
<P>
   The 21-year-old from the West Indies showed some moxie in the
second half, making three of four shots in what could have been a
harbinger for next year. Or not.
</P>
<P>
   Gadzuric fearlessly called for the ball and was the Bruins'
go-to guy in the first half. But he played only five minutes in the
second as UCLA went to a smaller, quicker lineup in an effort to
slow Iowa State's momentum.
</P>
<P>
   If they return for another year of college ball, Moiso, Gadzuric
and Rush can make themselves better and their team, too. Just as
Fizer did.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's a thousand times better than he was last year,'' Cyclones
coach Larry Eustachy said. ``He dictates the game, as opposed to
the way the game dictated him last year.''
</P>
<P>
   A year ago, Fizer was fine if he started fast. If not, he tended
to struggle. In other words, he was just like Moiso. He was just
like Gadzuric. He was just like Rush.
</P>
<P>
   Here's hoping the vacillating Bruins all decide to try to be
just like Fizer. The fact is, they could do a lot worse.

JOHNSON TAKES PLACE IN KINGS SPOTLIGHT
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By MATT McHALE  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &LR; PHILADELPHIA _ Forty-eight seconds into the third period
Thursday night, the Kings' Nelson Emerson went down and Craig
Johnson stepped up.
</P>
<P>
   Emerson suffered a broken right index finger when he was
struckby Philadelphia's Daymond Langkow.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson, usually confined to a checking role on the Kings third
unit, moved into Emerson's spot alongside Jozef Stumpel and
assisted on both of his goals in a 3-2 overtime victory over the
Flyers.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you see him use his speed, you know how much he can
helpus,'' Luc Robitaille said of Johnson ``He gave us a real lift
tonight when we really needed it.''
</P>
<P>
   Emerson, who had a goal in four games since coming over from
Atlanta with Kelly Buchberger, went to a local hospital to have his
fingerset. Instead of accompanying the team to Boston, where the
Kings play Saturday afternoon, Emerson returned to Los Angeles to
be examined by a specialist.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson entered the game with nine goals and 18 points, but
hisoffensive skills came out on the Kings tying goal just 2:15 into
the third period. He got the puck in front and Stumpel did the
rest.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was swarming their net the whole third period,'' Stumpel
said of Johnson. ``We got down 1-0 and 2-1 and we needed a spark.
He gaveit to us.''
</P>
<P>
   Johnson clearly was pumped in overtime when he went out for
thefour-on-four. On the winning goal, scored 1:20 into OT, Johnson
touchedthe puck three times during the sequence before getting a
pass to Jere Karalahti, who fed Stumpel.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a great feeling to contribute,'' Johnson said. ``This was
a huge win for us, starting a road trip and moving closer to the
playoffs.''
</P>
<P>
   __ Fiset returned: Goaltender Stephane Fiset, sidelinedalmost
two weeks with a strained right groin, returned Thursday and
stopped 22 of 24 shots. Fiset was told by Kings coach Andy Murray
that if he played well in the morning workout, he would be in the
lineup. Jamie Storr had started the previous five games.
</P>
<P>
   Fiset allowed goals to Jody Hull and Gino Odjick, but his
biggest play of the night came late in regulation when he made a
dramatic save on a blast by Mark Recchi after the Flyers had a
two-on-one with Mark Greig.
</P>
<P>
   ``Matty (Norstrom) did a great job directing the play,'' Fiset
said. ``He allowed me to set up. After (Recchi) took the shot just
seem to keep going after the stop.''

 By JERRY WIZIG  
 c. 2000, Houston Chronicle  
AUBURN HILLS, Mich. _ Iowa State's defensive pressure never
permitted UCLA to run and gun as the Cyclones advanced to their
first NCAA Elite Eight with an impressive 80-56 victory over the
Bruins on Thursday night in the Midwest Regional semifinals.
<TEXT>
<P>
   In gaining a Saturday meeting with No. 1 seed Michigan State,
the second-seeded Big 12 champions won for the 29th time in their
last 31 starts and 10th in a row after taking charge late in the
first half.
</P>
<P>
   The Cyclones (32-4) staged a 13-2 run as the sixth-seeded Bruins
(21-12) went scoreless for nearly four minutes. Iowa State then
built on its 40-28 halftime margin with a deliberate offense that
stung the Bruins for backdoor layups or opened the way for close-in
shots by Marcus Fizer.
</P>
<P>
   UCLA never whittled the margin to single digits, even when Fizer
spent several minutes on the bench in foul trouble. The Bruins kept
trying the lob passes inside like those that led to 14 alley-oop
baskets in their 105-70 drilling of Maryland last week in the
second round. But Stevie Johnson, Kantrail Horton, Jamaal Tinsley
and Fizer steadily derailed the strategy by deflecting the lobs.
</P>
<P>
   ``UCLA caught us at a bad time,'' Cyclones coach Larry Eustachy
said. ``Our goal was not to let them dunk, and I think we gave them
one for the entire game.''
</P>
<P>
   After Fizer went to the bench with his third foul with 12:33 to
play, UCLA's Jerome Moiso fashioned a three-point play, then was
fouled again several seconds later and made two free throws that
pulled the Bruins within 54-43.
</P>
<P>
   But Horton sank two free throws, Tinsley another, Fizer added
two more foul shots after he broke clear for a long inbounds pass
and Johnson got loose inside for a slam that widened the lead to
61-43.
</P>
<P>
   After that, the usual brand of Iowa State defense held the
Bruins to 33.3 percent shooting in the second half (33.9 percent
for the game). The Cyclones shot 60.9 percent in the second half
and 51.7 percent for the game in advancing past the regional
semifinals for the first time in their 11 NCAA appearances. It also
was Iowa State's first victory over UCLA in seven meetings, the
most recent an overtime loss to the Bruins in the regional
semifinals in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   Tinsley barely missed a triple double, with 14 points, 11
assists and nine rebounds plus four steals.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no one in the nation who can guard Jamaal one on
one,'' said Fizer. ``Jamaal can do about anything he wants. A lot
of times he decides not to play defense, but he's totally unselfish
in getting us the ball in position to score.''
</P>
<P>
   Fizer added 16 points, eight rebounds and two blocked shots.
Johnson and Michael Nurse scored 16 points apiece.
</P>
<P>
   Moiso (15 points) was the only Bruin in double figures after ISU
snapped UCLA's eight-game winning streak.
</P>
<P>
   Earl Watson, whose spectacular 17-point, 16-assist, no-turnover
performance keyed the Bruins' demolition of Maryland, fouled out
with 4:50 to play after scoring eight points with five assists.
</P>
<P>
   ``They weren't used to people getting into them defensively,''
Fizer said. ``We saw the defensive mistakes that Maryland made
against a great UCLA team, and we tried to make sure that didn't
happen to us.''
</P>
<P>
   Iowa State more than held its own despite a considerable height
disadvantage.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's unbelievable that we could outrebound (43-32) a team as
athletic as that,'' Eustachy said. ``We wanted to keep them out of
transition and keep them in a half-court offense.''
</P>

KINGS CURE A SEVEN-YEAR ITCH
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By MATT McHALE  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &LR; PHILADELPHIA  &UR; _ &LR;  So many times the Kings had come here to die,
trailing late in a game with nowhere to go but down.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday seemed like one of those nights, but the Kings clearly
are not one of those teams, shaking off a four-game winless streak
to defeat the Philadelphia Flyers 3-2 in overtime and win here for
the first time in seven years.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the kind of game you measure yourself against,'' said
Craig Johnson, who had assists on the tying and winning goals by
Jozef Stumpel. ``A team like Philadelphia tests you. We needed to
pass and we did.''
</P>
<P>
   Stumpel's goals, the first with 2:15 left in regulation and the
second 1:20 into OT, decided the game, but there were plenty of
players who made the difference.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; __  &LR; Johnson, seldom heard from as a scorer, did more than
assist on both Stumpel goals. As the Kings' fastest skater, he
created havoc around the net after newcomer Nelson Emerson left the
game 48 seconds into the third period with a broken right index
finger.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; __  &LR; Stephane Fiset returned after missing almost two weeks with
a strained groin and won his third overtime game of the season.
Even though the Flyers were playing without Eric Lindros, who is
sidelined at least a month with a severe concussion, Philadelphia
had a chance to win it in the final minutes of regulation.
</P>
<P>
   But Fiset gloved a blast by Mark Recchi after Philadelphia drove
in on a two-on-one break. The Flyers also lead the league with 62
power-play goals but went 0 for 4 against the Kings with the man
advantage.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; __  &LR; Luc Robitaille scored his first goal in 10 games midway
through the third period. The Flyers regained the lead less than a
minute later on a goal by Gino Odjick, but that only added to the
Kings' resolve. Robitaille also ended a 1-for-20 slump on the power
play with his 34th goal. In the previous 10 games, the Kings were 3
for 47.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was great to score that goal,'' said Robitaille, one of the
few players left from the Kings' last victory here in 1993 when the
team reached the Stanley Cup Finals. ``It's great to score any goal
but especially this time of year.''
</P>
<P>
   The victory gave the Kings (35-30-9) 83 points in the tight
Western Conference playoff race. It keeps them in second in the
Pacific Division and fifth overall in the Western Conference
heading into upcoming road games against beatable Boston (Saturday)
and expansion Atlanta (Sunday).
</P>
<P>
   But maybe just as important, they beat the Flyers at their own
physical game, something they will see down the stretch and in the
playoffs.
</P>
<P>
   Even before the Kings lost top scorer Ziggy Palffy for the final
three weeks of the regular season, opposing teams were having
success pounding them. Emerson's broken finger came on a slash by
Daymond Langkow that wasn't called.
</P>
<P>
   But for the most part, the Kings set the tone, mixing it up in
front of Flyers goaltender Brian Boucher after falling behind 2-1
midway through the third period.
</P>
<P>
   ``They were playing football out there,'' Odjick said. ``They
got away with it so good for them.''
</P>
<P>
   Leading the way was Stumpel, who has been criticized in the past
for playing soft.
</P>
<P>
   Now he is a regular in front of the opposing net and it paid off
against Philadelphia.
</P>
<P>
   The tying goal came on a pass from Johnson, the winner from Jere
Karalahti and Johnson. Both were from short range. After going four
games without a goal, Stumpel now has five game-winners this season
and three in OT this month.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were devastated when they retook the lead,'' Johnson said.
``But Stumpy kept us alive. When he gets down low like that, he
gives us a chance.''

CARDS GET EDMONDS FOR BOTTENFIELD, KENNEDY
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JOE HAAKENSON  
 c.2000 San Gabriel Valley Tribune  
<TEXT>
<P>
   TEMPE, Ariz.  &UR; _ &LR;  Only five days after Anaheim Angels general
manager Bill Stoneman told Jim Edmonds to ignore the rampant rumors
he would be traded, Edmonds was traded Thursday to the St. Louis
Cardinals for pitcher Kent Bottenfield and second baseman Adam
Kennedy, a former Cal State Northridge star.
</P>
<P>
   The deal ends months of speculation, negotiation and uncertainty
regarding Edmonds' status with the team, and also ends Edmonds'
12-year stay with the organization based in Anaheim, only a few
miles south of his hometown in Diamond Bar.
</P>
<P>
   Edmonds was pulled from Thursday's game against the A's at Tempe
Diablo Stadium after the sixth inning and told to go to the
clubhouse. It was there that Stoneman gave him the news.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think he was in a little bit of shock,'' Stoneman said.
``This has been his only club. His home is in the area, he's from
the area. This is something that's a little different for him. At
the same time, it seems to be a relief in the sense that the little
cloud that's been following him hopefully will disappear.''
</P>
<P>
   In Kennedy, the Angels get the Cardinals' 1999 minor-league
player of the year. He finished the season in the big leagues,
hitting .255 in 33 games, but he wasn't going to start for the
Cardinals because they acquired Fernando Vina to play second.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm pretty excited,'' said Kennedy, who has a 7 a.m. flight
this morning and is expected to be in Angels camp today. ``It's a
great opportunity. I'm really looking forward to it. I'm leaving
behind my best friends, but they understand my situation and what's
best for me.''
</P>
<P>
   Edmonds is eligible to become a free agent after this season,
but his agent, Paul Cohen, said the Cardinals were one of the nine
teams Edmonds listed as teams to which he'd prefer to be traded.
Cohen said it's too soon to say whether or not Edmonds will sign an
extension with the Cardinals. Bottenfield also is eligible for free
agency after the season.
</P>
<P>
   The news of the trade didn't come as a surprise to many in the
Angels clubhouse.
</P>
<P>
   ``When everybody heard Bill Stoneman a couple of days ago, to a
lot of the players, we figured something would happen,'' Angels
shortstop Gary DiSarcina said. ``It was the kiss of death.''
</P>
<P>
   But Stoneman said he wasn't going back on his word to Edmonds.
His talks with the Yankees, A's and Mariners had hit a dead end, so
Stoneman did what he could to stop the rumors.
</P>
<P>
   ``I called the general managers of the clubs who had been
calling about Jim,'' Stoneman said. ``It became pretty obvious that
we weren't going anywhere. . . . The Cardinals were not one of
them. This is something that came together very quickly.
</P>
<P>
   ``When it started to become apparent we might be able to fill
two of our needs, it made a lot of sense. After I spoke to the GMs
and told them he was off the market, I told Jim that. I was dead
serious when I told him I pulled him off the market. But something
new came up.''
</P>
<P>
   The Angels are excited about the deal because they filled two
holes: starting pitching and second base. In Bottenfield, they get
a 31-year-old right-hander who went 18-7 with a 3.97 ERA last
season. Bottenfield was originally drafted by the Expos when
Stoneman worked in their front office.
</P>
<P>
   ``I saw a lot of him last year and the pitcher I saw was very
different than when I first knew him,'' Stoneman said. ``The
blazing fastball is gone, but this guy can throw to a dime and hit
it. He's like a Greg Maddux  &UR; _ &LR;  he's not a particularly hard
thrower, but he understands pitching and has control.''
</P>
<P>
   Bottenfield became available because of the development of
Garret Stephenson, who is 1-0 with a 0.53 ERA in camp and will take
Bottenfield's spot in the St. Louis rotation.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had no intention of trading a starting pitcher,'' said
Cardinals general manager Walt Jocketty. ``This came up, and when
you get an opportunity to get a guy of Edmonds' stature, you can't
pass it up.''
</P>
<P>
   The Cardinals had talked with the Angels about a Bottenfield-
for-Edmonds deal earlier in the winter, but Stoneman wouldn't make
the deal one-for-one. But on Sunday, Stoneman talked with Cardinals
scout Bob Gebhardt, who was scouting the Angels in Arizona.
Stoneman brought up the possibility of adding Kennedy to the deal,
and it was consummated quickly.
</P>
<P>
   ``A talent like Jimmy is not going to be replaced, it's like
when Chuck (Finley) left,'' Angels manager Mike Scioscia said.
``Fortunately for us, the impact won't be as great offensively, and
we've got G.A. (Garret Anderson) to step in to play center field.
Overall, this gives us more balance than we had. Obviously, the
balance came at a huge cost.''

PURDUE BEATS GONZAGA &HT;    (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BOB RYAN  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
<TEXT>
 &QL;
<P>
   ALBUQUERQUE _ Purdue is well-established as the Best Friend Who
Never Gets The Girl, which is why coach Gene Keady hasn't even
purchased a ring, let alone booked a hall for the reception.
</P>
<P>
   ``Forty minutes is a long time,'' said the ever-pragmatic
Boilermaker mentor after his squad advanced to the West Regional
final with a 75-66 victory over Gonzaga Thursday night at The Pit.
``We don't have anything to celebrate yet. We've won three games in
the NCAA tournament, and that's nice. But you're judged on whether
or not you get to the Final Four, in the final analysis.''
</P>
<P>
   As he's been hearing ad nauseum for years and years, the
respected Boilermaker mentor has never taken any team to the Final
Four. Now a Purdue team that operated with its usual national
anonymity all season, and which exited the Big Ten tournament in
unpleasant fashion (a 78-66 loss to Wisconsin), is indeed 40
minutes away from the Promised Land after not just outscoring, but
truly punishing, the Zags.
</P>
<P>
   The only thing standing in Keady's way is the aforementioned
Wisconsin, which stifled LSU, 61-48, in the West's other semifinal.
</P>
<P>
   Is Keady excited?
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody says I need to do this to fill out my resume,''
Keady said with a shrug. ``I don't need that. I'd rather sink a
20-foot putt against my buddies. But I'd be happy for these kids if
they could go back and play in front of our fans.''
</P>
<P>
   Ah, yes. Don't forget this year's Final Four will be played at
the RCA Dome in Indianapolis, which is no more than an hour and a
half by car from the Purdue campus.
</P>
<P>
   And what of Gonzaga, the lovable team from the 4,500-student
Jesuit school in Spokane?
</P>
<P>
   They will at least know there weren't any great what-ifs? The
Zags were outplayed for a good 35 minutes. They were outshot,
outdefended, outhustled, and, most of all, unmercifully
outrebounded. Purdue helped itself to 20 offensive rebounds, good
for 23 second-chance points. All other things being equal, that was
the old ballgame.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's been one of our strengths all year,'' said the
relentless Brian Cardinal, who twice back-tapped missed free throws
to set up bonus Boilermaker points. ``We offensive rebound as hard
as we can, because we know we have an edge on most teams.''
</P>
<P>
   Rebounding is the primary adjunct to defense, and if the
Boilermakers got an A in board work, they had to get an A-plus in
defense. They wrapped up Gonzaga's 1-2 offensive punch of Matt
Santangelo and Richie Frahm, who combined to shoot a dismal 9 for
30, including 2 for 13 on their patented 3-pointers. Many of
Santangelo's wounds were self-inflicted, but Frahm was simply
dominated by the Purdue defenders, most notably senior Mike
Robinson, who entered school as an offensive whiz kid and who will
exit it as a nice all-around, and, incidentally, quite humble
player.
</P>
<P>
   ``I picked up Richie Frahm at the 3-point line and tried not to
give him any easy looks,'' said Robinson. ``During the course of
the game I wanted to make him work, tire him out, and push him
around.''
</P>
<P>
   Gonzaga had an early 10-4 lead via a 10-0 run. At this point
Keady called time and ordered more ball pressure to stop some easy
high-low lobs underneath to the likes of Casey Calvary and Axel
Dench. Ask, and the coach shall receive. The Purdue defense
inspired its offense, and soon the Boilermakers were off on a 22-7
run. Purdue led by 13 (35-22) at the half.
</P>
<P>
   Gonzaga whittled the lead to 37-32, but it wasn't exactly panic
time on the Purdue side. With bench performers Rod Smith and Chad
Kerkhoff _ the Last of the One-Hand Set-Shooters _ making big
hoops, Purdue responded with a run of 7-0. Gonzaga never really
threatened again, never getting closer than 8 (61-53, 3:37) and
never rattling the Boilermakers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Having five seniors helps,'' Robinson said.
</P>
<P>
   Time and again . . . and again . . . and again . . . Purdue got
what it needed via second shots. ``We've had a stretch of seven or
eight games where we've outrebounded people,'' said Gonzaga coach
Mark Few. ``I've never seen us outrebounded like that, especially
on missed free throws.''
</P>
<P>
   Superior depth also was a major factor. Gonzaga was down one
injured starter, anyway, and Purdue is more naturally deep. Keady
paid homage to the mile-high altitude by allowing his players to
substitute themselves out for a blow.
</P>
<P>
   The classy Gonzaga kids knew which team deserved to move on.
``They're not like St. John's, who want to force you into turnovers
and beat you by 40,'' said Santangelo. ``They contest every shot,
they rebound the heck out of the ball, they make you work hard for
everything, and they just want to beat you by 12.''
</P>
<P>
   Or, in this case, 9. Does anyone hear wedding bells in the
distance?
</P>
<P>
   Wisconsin 61, LSU 48 _ It will be an All-Big Ten West Regional
final. Make that a rock 'em-sock 'em All-Big Ten West Regional
final. Wisconsin saw to that by humiliating LSU.
</P>
<P>
   If LSU doubted Wisconsin's defensive prowess before the game _
and there were indications that was the case _ what can the Tigers
say now after needing more than 35 minutes to break, ahem, 30? (It
was 22-14, Badgers, at the half.)
</P>
<P>
   Just getting off a shot was a major LSU achievement. At one
point in the second half, the No. 4 seed Tigers had a 1-to-1 ratio;
that is to say, they had 22 shots attempted _ and 22 turnovers.
Wisconsin, the No. 8 seed, led by as many as 19 (38-19).
</P>
<P>
   LSU star Stromile Swift didn't live up to his name, taking but
one shot in the first half en route to a 12-point evening padded by
garbage-time scoring.
</P>
<P>
   Wisconsin has won 10 of its last 13, the only three losses
coming to consensus tourney favorite Michigan State. The Badgers
were 2-1 against Purdue.

 PANTHERS BEAT BRUINS
 &HT;    (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By NANCY MARRAPESE-BURRELL  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
<TEXT>
 &QL;
<P>
   It was there for the taking. For two periods, the Bruins had the
Florida Panthers scoreless and quiet.
</P>
<P>
   But as has been the case so often this season, the Bruins have
lost games in small spans of time.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday night, after bottling up the Panthers for better than
45 minutes, Boston gave up a pair of third-period strikes 2 minutes
51 seconds apart and fell to Florida, 3-1, at the FleetCenter.
</P>
<P>
   The effort, the defense, and the execution were there. In the
end, though, a couple of great plays by Florida and little
breakdowns by Boston led to big trouble.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't say it very often, but I honestly feel we deserved
probably a better fate,'' said Don Sweeney. ``It's certainly
disheartening. I felt the game was there for us.''
</P>
<P>
   That was true largely because of the conservative, tight game
plan the Bruins played to near perfection in the first two periods.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's easy to have a game plan like that and to go out and do
it,'' said coach Pat Burns. ``But sooner or later, the other team _
they were starting to figure it out. They were trying to get behind
our defense. We were keeping the gap closed. They look at us and
think they should be able to have a little fun. All of a sudden,
they realize they're in a game. But then it's the errors that cost
you the game. That makes the difference over an 82-game schedule.''
</P>
<P>
   Boston's objective was to contain superstar Pavel Bure, maximize
their opportunities on veteran goalie Mike Vernon, and try not to
give anything away.
</P>
<P>
   It certainly didn't hurt that goalie John Grahame, who was
rocked in his last start by Philadelphia last Sunday, turned in a
strong performance with 25 saves.
</P>
<P>
   One of his biggest stops came at 17:27 of the middle period when
right wing Scott Mellanby worked his way toward the net. Center Rob
Niedermayer centered a pass in front to Mellanby, but his one-timer
from the slot was turned aside.
</P>
<P>
   The Bruins finally broke through at 4:12 of the third when
Cameron Mann, who had been denied earlier, made his chance count.
</P>
<P>
   Andre Savage moved the puck to Mann and he took off up the right
side. He beat defenseman Todd Simpson to the inside of the right
circle, and then beat Vernon with a deft backhand shot between the
netminder's pads.
</P>
<P>
   The Bruins' elation certainly didn't last long, less than two
minutes.
</P>
<P>
   Florida center Viktor Kozlov beat defenseman Brandon Smith
behind the Boston cage, skated out to the left circle, and flipped
a shot at the net. Grahame made the save but couldn't contain the
rebound. Right wing Mark Parrish was there, beating Grahame with a
forehand shot at 5:57 to tie it at 1-1. It ended the Bruins'
shutout streak at 106 minutes 26 seconds.
</P>
<P>
   The Panthers scored the winner less than three minutes later on
a goal by former Bruin Cam Stewart. At 8:48, Mellanby fed a perfect
pass across the slot to Stewart, who shoveled it past Grahame for
the 2-1 margin at 8:48.
</P>
<P>
   Boston had an excellent opportunity to pull even at 10:05 during
a power play. But Sergei Samsonov was robbed by the left arm of
Vernon. Then Mann came even closer with 3:48 left but after taking
a pass from Mikko Eloranta, his shot rattled off the right post.
</P>
<P>
   With Grahame on his way to the bench for an extra attacker, Bure
sealed it at 18:58 when he fired the puck into the empty cage for
his 52d goal.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were close,'' said Grahame, ``but close wasn't good
enough.''

HE EMBRACES SHAQ OVER WILT
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By DOUG KRIKORIAN  
 c.2000 Long Beach Press-Telegram  
<TEXT>
<P>
   We haven't clubbed together. We haven't discussed his favorite
philosopher Nietzsche together. We haven't even done lunch or
dinner together.
</P>
<P>
   Shaquille O'Neal and I aren't exactly pals, with our only previ
ous contact with each other over the years coming during interviews
in the Lakers locker room.
</P>
<P>
   Yet, the other night at Staples Center after the Lakers had
impaled the Golden State Warriors, O'Neal warmly hugged me, even
bent over and laid his huge head on my shoulder, and feigned
weeping in a comical display that elicited laughter in his team's
dressing quarters.
</P>
<P>
   It wasn't like being touched by an angel, but I have to candidly
admit it was the first time in my life I've been embraced by a 7-
foot-1, 320-pound multimillionaire destined to be a unanimous
choice as the Most Valuable Player in the NBA.
</P>
<P>
   What inspired O'Neal's impromptu display of faux emotion?
</P>
<P>
   It came after I told him, ``I think you're a better player than
Wilt Chamberlain was.''
</P>
<P>
   Shaquille O'Neal vs. Wilt Chamberlain?
</P>
<P>
   Forget it.
</P>
<P>
   O'NealChamberlain
</P>
<P>
   The Shaquille O'Neal I've been watching dominate the NBA in
recent months is simply superior to the Wilt Chamberlain I once
covered as a beat writer for the Los Angeles Herald Examiner when
Chamberlain was a member of the Los Angeles Lakers.
</P>
<P>
   Blasphemy?
</P>
<P>
   Certainly to those devout patrons of the late center whose
perceptions are hopelessly immersed in the mistiness of the past
and are mesmerized by Chamberlain's incredible numbers 100 points
in a game, 55 rebounds in a game, 50-point average for a season,
etc. that were achieved early in his career against inferior
opposition and often at the expense of his team winning games.
</P>
<P>
   But I've been seeing O'Neal dispense heroics this season like
that late-game, midcourt steal that recently saved the Lakers
against Orlando, or those four consecutive third-quarter blocked
shots against Alonzo Mourning the other evening, etc. etc., etc.
that have set him apart from Chamberlain in my mind.
</P>
<P>
   Oh, Chamberlain might have been a better rebounder than O'Neal,
perhaps even a better PLEASE SEE DOUG / B7 DOUG: Shaq beats Wilt
</P>
<P>
   CONTINUEDFROMB1 shot blocker.
</P>
<P>
   But he wasn't nearly as good a passer, nor did he have the deft
footwork, or the variety of offensive moves that O'Neal has been
exhibiting with such devastating results this season.
</P>
<P>
   ``I coached Wilt and loved Wilt,'' says Bill Sharman, coach of
the Lakers during Chamberlain's heyday with the team. ``But he
never had the quickness inside that Shaquille has. Shaquille is
just such an awesome force. Right now Shaquille is playing better
than any center I've ever seen.''
</P>
<P>
   ``If Shaquille keeps improving, I think he has a chance to go
down as the greatest center in the history of basketball,'' says
Bill Bertka, the Lakers' venerable assistant coach.
</P>
<P>
   ``No doubt that Shaquille now compares favorably with all the
great centers who have been in the league,'' says Jerry West, who
played with Chamberlain, coached Kareem Abdul-Jabbar and was the
driving force behind the acquisition of O'Neal. ``When you consider
all the things he does and how well he does them he has to be
ranked among the best.
</P>
<P>
   ``And the scary thing is that there is so much room for
improvement. What upsets me most is when people say, `All he can do
is dunk.' People who say that don't know the game. Shaquille has a
nice feel for what he's doing out there. He makes the smart passes.
He gets good position. And his quickness for a man of his size is
what sets him apart from everyone.''
</P>
<P>
   It definitely sets him apart from Chamberlain.
</P>
<P>
   If you look at old Laker film footage on the Sports Classic
network and I did the other night when the famous Willis
Reed-limping-onto-the Madison Square Garden-floor, Lakers-New York
Knicks Game 7 of 1970 was shown you can't help but notice how
Chamberlain maneuvers around almost in slow motion compared to what
you're accustomed now to seeing with O'Neal.
</P>
<P>
   But that's not to demean Wilt Chamberlain, a legendary figure
who holds records that never will be broken and was the most
dominant player of his generation.
</P>
<P>
   It's just that Shaquille O'Neal has now evolved beyond Wilt
Chamberlain, and is playing at an unprecedented level that is
reflected graphically in the Lakers' 57-12 record. . . .
</P>
<P>
   It seems hardly a year passes without swimming great Susie
Atwood being elected into some sort of Hall of Fame.
</P>
<P>
   The latest honor came Thursday in Palm Springs, where the
two-time Olympian was inducted into the California Community
College Sports Hall of Fame.
</P>
<P>
   She also is in the National Swimming Hall of Fame, the Century
Club Hall of Fame and the Long Beach City College Hall of Fame.
Alas, it's doubtful she'll ever make it in the Hall of Fame in
Cooperstown, although you never know for sure when it comes to this
fiercely ambitious lady.
</P>
<P>
   The advancement of women sports has been startling since 1973
when Atwood, and her former Millikan High classmate, An Simmons,
had no alternative but to compete on the LBCC men's swim team.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, at the time, there were only three universities that
offered scholarships to women swimmers and Atwood would wind up
attending one of them, Hawaii, for a few years.
</P>
<P>
   After winning a silver and bronze in the 1972 Olympics in Munich
she also was a member of the 1968 Olympic team that competed in
Mexico City and after coaching at Ohio State, Atwood went into the
insurance business and has become a successful State Farm agent in
Long Beach.
</P>
<P>
   She and her husband-in-waiting, former Secret Service agent Dave
Butler, have become popular figures on the local social scene. . .
.
</P>
<P>
   Armando Contreras, Dr. Robert ``Fighting Bob'' Maxson's bright,
energetic assistant, has lined up the USA Men's National Volleyball
team to perform against a Korean national team on April 14 at the
Pyramid.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the players on the American squad will be competing in
the upcoming Sydney Olympics and one of them, middle blocker Tom
Hoff, is a former Long Beach State star. . . .
</P>
<P>
   One of the nice guys in sports, Long Beach State men's
volleyball coach Ray Ratelle, will be honored Saturday evening
before his team's match against USC at the Pyramid.
</P>
<P>
   Ratelle is retiring at the end of the season, and he's
determined to go out in a flourish as his 17-2 team is rated No. 1
in the nation. . . .
</P>
<P>
   The least surprising statement of the week came out of Staples
Center Wednesday, when it was announced that tickets were going
briskly for the June 17 Sugar Shane Mosley-Oscar De La Hoya
welterweight title fight. Supposedly, 13,000 were peddled in a few
hours, but I don't believe it. You can be sure Bob Arum's roly-poly
propaganda minister, Mr. Bill ``Bozo'' Caplan, was busy playing a
behind-the-scenes role in such inflated figures calculated to give
the public illusion that Mosley-De La Hoya is an event of epic
proportions. . . .
</P>
<P>
   Gee, I'm not sure if I'll ever watch television again now that
Michael Jordan says he's no longer going to be a commercial
pitchman. . . .
</P>
<P>
   Listen, don't be too down on the foundering Dodgers. After all,
they've won more games in March than the Clippers. . . .
</P>
<P>
   I've had a lot of weird things happen to me in my life, but
Shaquille O'Neal ``crying'' on my shoulder ranks among the most
bizarre.

TRIM PAYROLL IS GOAL
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BOB KEISSER  
 c.2000 Long Beach Press-Telegram  
<TEXT>
<P>
   The first person I called Thursday after the Angels traded Jim
Edmonds was a friend named Bryon who is an Angels season-ticket
holder.
</P>
<P>
   After initially telling him the Angels had traded Edmonds for
Mark McGwire and Alan Benes, he said ``OK, who did they really
get?''
</P>
<P>
   Kent Bottenfield and Adam Kennedy.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's it!'' he screamed. ``I'm giving up my tickets.''
</P>
<P>
   My friend may reconsider, because he's a big-time baseball fan
and his infant son Dakota gets a lot of face time on the Angels
video board. But his initial incredulous reaction was probably
typical of most long-suffering Angels fans.
</P>
<P>
   Even with an abundance of outfielders Edmonds on the roster, how
does a team let someone as talented as Edmonds go for so little in
return?
</P>
<P>
   Why would a team ever back itself into a corner over a player
with as much upside and value as Edmonds?
</P>
<P>
   And, why can't the Angels (and Dodgers, for that matter) ever be
on the receiving end of a blockbuster trade, the way the Cubs did
in getting Ismael Valdes and Eric Young from the Dodgers for a
middle reliever, or the way the Mariners picked Houston's prospect
pocket Bottenfield in the Randy Johnson trade?
</P>
<P>
   The simple answer is that this is the Angels' way. They've been
a reactionary, impatient and out of synch organization since birth.
</P>
<P>
   The organization that gave too much money to too many free
agents is the same organization that let Nolan Ryan walk. The
organization that didn't pull the trigger on trading for Mark
McGwire is the same organization that now sends Edmonds to become
his teammate.
</P>
<P>
   For five years, former G.M. Bill Bavasi nurtured the sensible
formula of building through the farm system and signing players
before they reached their early free agent years. It might have
worked if Bavasi had developed a few more pitchers.
</P>
<P>
   The new regime has two mandates: Clear the clubhouse of
controversy and trim the payroll. Disney has adopted a we-can-lose-
92-games-without-you philosophy, and there would be some merit to
the concept if the team had an improvement plan to go with it.
</P>
<P>
   On that matter, the jury is still out. New Angels GM Bill
Stoneman says Kennedy and Bottenfield will make the team better.
Maybe. But they definitely cost less. Bottenfield made $800,000
last year and Kennedy is a rookie playing for the major league
minimum.
</P>
<P>
   That makes them a fit on a team that let Chuck Finley get away
without compensation and hired ex-Dodgers catcher Mike Scioscia as
manager because they could pay him less than anyone else on the
market. With the departure of Finley ($5.8 million) and Edmonds
($4.5 million), the Angels have cut more than $10 million in
salaries.
</P>
<P>
   Edmonds was part of the clubhouse mess last year, not because of
anything he said as much ashis manner. In spite of his willingness
to dive on asphalt-hard turf, Jim Edmonds has laid-back body
language, and some fans and teammates believe that means he doesn't
care.
</P>
<P>
   But do these numbers say ``I don't care''? In a four-year span
(1995-98) before last year's injury- shortened season, Edmonds
averaged 27 home runs, 86 RBI, 97 runs scored and a .301 batting
average, and won two Gold Glove awards.
</P>
<P>
   This isn't Bobby Bonilla we're talking about. Somehow, I'd find
a way to keep Edmonds in my lineup. And I certainly wouldn't deal
him for a rookie and a 31-year-old pitcher with one good year in
seven big league seasons.
</P>
<P>
   Kennedy is a line-drive hitter who doesn't strike out. He hit
.327 in AAA last year, and Baseball America ranked him the third
best prospect in the Cardinals farm system. But the Cal State
Northridge product is a former shortstop with a year of second-base
experience, and his minor league numbers (on-base percentage,
steals) don't project as a leadoff hitter.
</P>
<P>
   Bottenfield, 31, was the epitome of a journeyman pitcher until
last year, when he went 18-7 and made the N.L. All-Star team. The
Angels are his sixth team in eight seasons, and one of those teams
was Montreal, Stoneman's old haunt.
</P>
<P>
   ``For a long time, he was a thrower, not a pitcher,'' Stoneman
said. ``He found himself last year.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe so. But the Cardinals didn't seem too keen on keeping him.
In trading for Darryl Kile and Pat Hentgen in the offseason, the
Cards were saying they weren't convinced Bottenfield could
duplicate his season. At best, he was the No. 4 or 5 starter in St.
Louis.
</P>
<P>
   Scouting reports say Bottenfield is a fly ball pitcher with
occasional control problems. With the Cardinals, he benefited from
run support of 6.1 runs per game, among the N.L. leaders. Stats
Inc.'s 2000 Major League Handbook said he tied for the N.L. lead in
cheap wins with six.
</P>
<P>
   Plus, the Cardinals actually gave up more (two good pitching
prospects) to get Kile than they gave up for Edmonds, which is just
another reason to believe the Angels are making plans on the fly.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know how many Angels fans are tuned in to the N.L.,
and I doubt many people other than neighbors know Adam. But I'm
pleased we were able to land an 18-game winner, and I envision Adam
having a long career.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hope fans will say `let's take a look at this team and see
if it can make a run.' ''
</P>
<P>
   At least those that haven't already ran off.

MASSACHUSETTS IN HOT WATER OVER BOYCOTT. TEA, ANYONE?  
 
</HEADLINE>
   From the Economist magazine  
 c.2000 Economist Newspaper Ltd.  
 (Distributed by the New York Times Special Features)  
<TEXT>
<P>
   For a Supreme Court determined to assert and expand states'
rights, it sounds like the dream case.
</P>
<P>
   Little Massachusetts is once again standing up for the
democratic values which it so boldly asserted before the American
Revolution.
</P>
<P>
   Then it boycotted English imports, and its residents famously
chucked a few cases of tea into Boston Harbor.
</P>
<P>
   Today the state of Massachusetts is boycotting companies which
do business with Myanmar, the country formerly known as Burma and
now run by one of the world's harshest military regimes.
</P>
<P>
   Who could be against that? Well, to name a few, dozens of
American and foreign companies, an ex-president, two ex-secretaries
of state, some 20 members of Congress, plus Japan, the European
Union and the Clinton administration.
</P>
<P>
   So far, two lower federal courts have ruled that Massachusetts's
well-intentioned foray into foreign affairs is unconstitutional.
</P>
<P>
   In an oral hearing on March 22, the National Foreign Trade
Council, and its stellar array of supporters, asked the Supreme
Court to do the same, and to bring to a screeching halt the
proliferation of local and state selective-purchasing laws.
</P>
<P>
   Massachusetts, supported by a long list of churches,
human-rights groups, dozens of city and state governments, and its
own even larger band of congressmen, asked the court to uphold its
law.
</P>
<P>
   Massachusetts passed the law in 1996 in a fit of
self-righteousness. It bars state agencies from buying goods or
services from most firms, foreign or domestic, which do business
with Myanmar.
</P>
<P>
   At the time this seemed like little more than a harmless bit of
gesture politics. But, to general amazement, Apple, Kodak and
Hewlett-Packard soon pulled out of Myanmar, citing the
Massachusetts law.
</P>
<P>
   The state's blacklist included European and Japanese firms,
among them Toyota, Sony and Siemens. This, in turn, provoked an
angry reaction from Japan and the EU.
</P>
<P>
   They first protested to Washington, and then took the more
serious step of launching a formal complaint at the World Trade
Organization in Geneva, charging that the Massachusetts law
breached the obligation of the United States under the WTO's
agreement on open government procurement.
</P>
<P>
   All sides agree that Myanmar is ruled by a bunch of thugs. The
United States, the EU and Japan have all imposed sanctions against
Myanmar. But should lowly Massachusetts have the same right?
</P>
<P>
   In striking down the law, the federal appeals court in Boston
found that a state has no authority to regulate conduct beyond its
borders and that the Massachusetts law ``interferes with the
ability of the federal government to speak with one voice.''
</P>
<P>
   The National Foreign Trade Council adds that the Constitution
clearly gives the federal government the exclusive right to conduct
foreign relations and to regulate foreign trade. It also claims
that the state's law conflicts with the federal government's own
sanctions.
</P>
<P>
   Massachusetts disputes all these points. It argues that its law
does not regulate anything, but only disassociates the citizens of
Massachusetts from a vile regime by spending their money in a way
that they approve of.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nothing in our federal Constitution denies to the states the
right to apply a moral standard to their spending decisions,'' the
state argues in its legal brief.
</P>
<P>
   As for the idea that it contradicts federal law, Douglas Kmiec,
a law professor at Pepperdine University in California, points out
that Congress passed its anti-Burma law three months after the
passage of the Massachusetts law, was well aware of it, and chose
not to preempt it explicitly, which even Massachusetts agrees it
had the power to do.
</P>
<P>
   So why should the court now do what Congress declined to do?
Kmiec, who served as an assistant attorney-general in Washington in
the 1980s, says that the Reagan administration had a fierce
internal debate about whether to oppose similar local laws aimed at
South Africa.
</P>
<P>
   Ronald Reagan disliked anti-apartheid sanctions. But he disliked
the idea of constricting states' rights even more. Kmiec helped to
dissuade the administration, on federalism grounds, from
challenging in court any of the 23 states and 80 cities that had
anti-apartheid purchasing laws.
</P>
<P>
   The Supreme Court could be equally torn. At the oral hearing
Massachusetts's assistant attorney-general faced skeptical
questions from the liberal justices who have opposed the expansion
of states' rights.
</P>
<P>
   And yet after further consideration, they could be swayed by the
human-rights goals of the state's law.
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, a few of the five conservative justices who
have backed states' rights in recent years, most notably Chief
Justice William Rehnquist, have also supported the view that
foreign affairs should be preeminently national in scope.
</P>
<P>
   If the court does find in Massachusetts's favor, it will present
the next administration with something of a dilemma. The EU and
Japan could revive their WTO complaints, which they let lapse after
the Massachusetts law was struck down by a lower court.
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton administration had said it would vigorously defend
the law against the WTO complaints. That will be a difficult thing
for any administration to do, now that the federal government is
asking the Supreme Court to strike down the law. &QL;

 &HT;    Gore aide faces probe by State Department
 &HT;    By Ken Foskett
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Washington _ The State Department is investigating Tony Coelho,
presidential campaign chairman for Vice President Al Gore, for his
role in organizing the World Exposition in Portugal in 1998,
Coelho's attorney said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Stanley Brand said his client was cooperating with the inquiry,
which arose out of a critical audit of the World Expo in September
1999. Coelho was the U.S. commissioner general to the expo.
</P>
<P>
   News of the investigation by the State Department's office of
inspector general is reported in today's National Journal.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a rehash of everything that's been reported and talked
about since September,'' Brand said of the Journal article.
</P>
<P>
   Brand said Coelho began cooperating with the investigation in
November and had provided bank records as recently as January.
</P>
<P>
   Brand accused Journal editor Michael Kelly, a frequent Gore
critic, of political motivations in publishing the report just
three weeks after Gore wrapped up the Democratic nomination.
</P>
<P>
   ``Why all of the sudden is this news?'' Brand said. Kelly could
not be reached for comment.
</P>
<P>
   Coelho is credited with helping retool Gore's campaign after it
stumbled early against former rival Bill Bradley. But Coelho has
also been something of a lightening rod for criticism.
</P>
<P>
   Coelho resigned from Congress in 1989 after he failed to report
a loan from a troubled savings and loan institution. The Justice
Department investigated the loan but never filed charges.
</P>
<P>
   Coelho's latest legal problems arose from the nonpaid position
he took with the U.S. Information Agency to spearhead the United
States' exposition at the World Expo in Portugal.
</P>
<P>
   The State Department audit found that the expo was mismanaged
and overbudget, resulting in U.S. government agencies absorbing 82
percent of the cost when private donations were in fact supposed to
foot the bill.
</P>
<P>
   While the audit praised the expo for attracting millions of
visitors, Coelho was faulted for such internal management lapses as
putting his niece on the payroll at $2,500 a month, $900 more than
the office manager was receiving.
</P>
<P>
   The Gore campaign issued a strong endorsement of Coelho when the
audit was made public last fall, and again praised Coelho Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   ``Tony is doing a great job, day in and day out,'' said Chris
Lehane, Gore's spokesman.

 &HT;    Bush smart enough to lead country, but that's not all it takes
 &HT;    By Rowland Nethaway
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WACO, Texas _ Bush is getting a bum rap about his smarts.
</P>
<P>
   Without question, Texas Gov. George W. Bush is smart enough to
be an excellent president.
</P>
<P>
   That doesn't mean he would be an excellent president, just that
he is smart enough to be one.
</P>
<P>
   The is-Bush-smart-enough question comes from two primary
sources.
</P>
<P>
   First, Bush's political opponents have belittled him by saying
that his Yale grades were mediocre.
</P>
<P>
   Bush admits that he reaped his share of ``gentleman Cs'' at
Yale. That doesn't mean he lacks the smarts to be president.
</P>
<P>
   The other primary source for the jokes and innuendoes about
Bush's brain power came when a Boston TV reporter ambushed the
governor with a pop quiz on the names of foreign leaders.
</P>
<P>
   Bush couldn't name the general who recently took control of
Pakistan, the president of Chechnya or the prime minister of India.
</P>
<P>
   He did recall the name of the president of Taiwan, ``Lee.''
</P>
<P>
   Forewarned, the other presidential candidates refused to answer
current-events pop quizzes. But the damage was already done to
Bush. Everyone from TV comedians to serious pundits have made hay
with Bush's intellect.
</P>
<P>
   There are several reasons that make the is-Bush-smart-enough
question unfair.
</P>
<P>
   To begin with, high grades in school do not translate into high
leadership qualities. Sometimes they do, but often they do not.
</P>
<P>
   It turns out that Bush's grades at Yale were higher than Al
Gore's grades at Harvard, according to the Washington Post and
historian David Maraniss.
</P>
<P>
   Gore has refused to release or talk about his grades. No wonder.
Gore placed in the lower fifth of his classes two years straight at
Harvard. His classmates remember him spending time shooting pool,
watching TV, eating hamburgers and smoking dope.
</P>
<P>
   After Bush graduated from Yale, he earned a graduate degree, an
MBA, from Harvard Business School. That's not shabby academic
achievement.
</P>
<P>
   Bush also was an F-102 pilot for the Texas Air National Guard.
Not everyone has what it takes to fly high-performance combat jets.
That doesn't mean Bush would make a good president, but it shows
he's no dummy.
</P>
<P>
   Besides, high intelligence is not a good predictor of a good
president.
</P>
<P>
   Jimmy Carter was a nuclear engineer. He had high grades and high
intelligence. He had very high ideals. All excellent qualities.
</P>
<P>
   But Carter micromanaged White House tennis court schedules and
repeatedly misfired on his big-picture initiatives.
</P>
<P>
   Carter was, and is, a good man. But he often was out of sync
with the American people. That's not good in a leader.
</P>
<P>
   Most political historians and observers agree that Richard Nixon
and Bill Clinton were among the most intelligent presidents ever
elected. They also both disgraced the presidency.
</P>
<P>
   Ronald Reagan, by all accounts, was no great shakes in the IQ
department. But those same political historians and observers agree
that Reagan was a good president.
</P>
<P>
   Reagan was in sync with the sentiments of most Americans. He
inspired confidence even if he couldn't recall the names of world
leaders or thought trees caused air pollution.
</P>
<P>
   In the 30 years that I have been interviewing politicians and
political candidates, I have often felt that some of them were not
smart enough to handle the job. I did not get that feeling in
editorial board conversations with Bush.
</P>
<P>
   I also had a long conversation with Gore about offshore oil
reserves.
</P>
<P>
   Both men are smart enough to be president. Smarts should not be
a question.

 &HT;    Effects of resveratrol are still unclear
 &HT;    By Karen Collins
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _
</P>
<P>
   Q: Is the resveratrol found in wine available in any other
foods?
</P>
<P>
   A: Resveratrol is a naturally occurring substance found mainly
in grapes that may promote heart health and prevent the development
of cancerous cells. Researchers caution, however, that much of the
work regarding resveratrol's effects has been conducted only in
test tubes; we are just beginning to see how this compound may work
in animals or humans.
</P>
<P>
   Content varies with the type of grape, growing conditions and
stage of ripeness. Since resveratrol is found in the grape skins,
white wine (which is not fermented with the skins) has little of
the substance. Resveratrol is most readily found in red wine, but
it is wise to drink it in very moderate amounts. The health risks
of more than one or two small glasses of wine a day outweigh the
potential phytochemical benefits.
</P>
<P>
   Grape juice (especially dark types) and table grapes provide
resveratrol in less concentrated amounts, but you can consume
larger portions without health risk.
</P>
<P>
   Q: I heard that honey is recommended because tooth decay is
caused by bacteria, which cannot live in honey.
</P>
<P>
   A: Tooth decay is caused by bacteria, but the bacteria that
cause it do not come from our food. Bacteria are always present in
our mouth. If there is carbohydrate present on our teeth, bacteria
ferment it. This produces an acid that damages tooth enamel,
leading to cavities. That is why the key to cavity prevention is
brushing and flossing teeth after eating whenever possible, and
avoiding the habit of eating or drinking carbohydrate snacks
constantly throughout the day.
</P>
<P>
   Also, honey is known to occasionally contain the bacteria
responsible for botulism food poisoning. Adults can tolerate the
small amounts that may be present, but because babies are more
sensitive, experts recommend that children under the age of two
never be given honey.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Is there any truth to the notion that cranberry juice can
cure bladder infections?
</P>
<P>
   A: Some studies have found that drinking a daily 10-ounce glass
of cranberry juice reduces the incidence of bacterial infections of
the urinary tract in elderly women by about 50 percent after four
to eight weeks. Evidence also suggests that cranberry juice could
help treatment of bladder infections.
</P>
<P>
   Cranberry juice, however, is not a substitute for medication. If
you think you might have a bladder infection, see your doctor. It
is important that bladder infections be completely resolved. When
buying cranberry juice, if you have diabetes or glucose
intolerance, choose the artificially sweetened versions since
regular cranberry juice cocktail contains about three tablespoons
of sugar per cup.

 &HT;    A bunch of nekkid women will cause you nothing but trouble
 &HT;    By Phil Latham
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   MARSHALL, Texas _ The news office was invaded by a gaggle of
nekkid women Friday. Really. But, trust me, it isn't news of the
traditional sort.
</P>
<P>
   Playboy Magazine sent us three copies of its latest College
Girls extravaganza and one of the models happened to be a poor girl
from Longview who was foolish enough to take her clothes off while
someone was snapping a camera. The few thousand dollars she got (I
hope she got at least a few thousand) may already be gone. Those
pictures are going to be around forever.
</P>
<P>
   I don't want to sound too sanctimonious, however. If someone had
sent me that magazine 30 years ago I would have been overjoyed
beyond all belief and hidden the magazine in my most secret place
in the hopes that my mother would never find it.
</P>
<P>
   She would have.
</P>
<P>
   Even Friday, it took me several tries before my hand would
actually let the darn thing go into the trash.
</P>
<P>
   Call it a hangover from my teen-age years. When I was 15, I
spent weeks trying to get just such a magazine in an episode that
will forever rank as one of my most embarrassing moments (or at
least I hope so).
</P>
<P>
   I walked to and from school every day. Yes, disbelieving young
people, once most high school students did actually walk to school
and many for several miles. I had a two-mile jaunt each way.
Fortunately, living in Texas, I never had to walk in snow. They
closed the school.
</P>
<P>
   From time to time I varied my walk, but most often it was right
down one of Fort Worth's main streets, Lancaster Avenue, and right
past a newsstand.
</P>
<P>
   And in the newsstand, there were nudie magazines. I knew this
because the place was also a convenience store and I would
frequently stop there to get a soft drink _ particularly after I
discovered they sold nudie magazines.
</P>
<P>
   I knew right where they were in the store, but I was always too
chicken to openly browse them. Instead I would pretend to be
looking at some of the other nearby magazines, sneaking a glance
now and then. It did not do me much good. They were all covered in
wrappers and showed no more than anyone could see at the tame
movies of the day.
</P>
<P>
   But I dreamed that there was more. So much more.
</P>
<P>
   After several months of this, I decided that I had to buy one of
those magazines. I saved up my lunch money until I had about $5. I
carried that money with me for two weeks trying to get up the
nerve. Finally, the day arrived.
</P>
<P>
   I walked into the store as fast as I could go, walked straight
to the adult section and, without even looking (thank goodness they
didn't sell those magazines with nude men back then) I picked a
magazine in a plastic wrapper, took it to the counter and plopped
it down.
</P>
<P>
   I kept my eyes downward while the clerk walked slowly over. I
put my crumpled, sweaty $5 bill on top of the magazine.
</P>
<P>
   The clerk walked over. He looked at me and he looked at the
magazine.
</P>
<P>
   ``You want to buy this?'' he asked.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yessir,'' I said, hoping that my voice hadn't squeaked.
</P>
<P>
   He looked at me and he looked at the magazine.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm sorry, but I'm going to have to see some ID.''
</P>
<P>
   It had never occurred to me that I would be asked to show my ID.
Still, I was quick on my feet. I told him I didn't drive and, thus,
didn't have a license.
</P>
<P>
   ``Well, you are 18, right?''
</P>
<P>
   ``Nah, I'm 20,'' I said. No need in limiting a good lie.
</P>
<P>
   ``Well, then, great. Just show me your draft card.''
</P>
<P>
   I was had. During the Vietnam War, all 18-year-olds were
required to carry their draft cards at all times, proving, for one
thing, that you had actually registered for the draft. Of course, a
15-year-old boy didn't have a draft card.
</P>
<P>
   I told him I'd left it in my other wallet (looking back that is
the silliest thing I've ever heard, what man keeps two wallets?).
He didn't say anything and I didn't say anything. I walked out as
quickly as I'd walked in.
</P>
<P>
   My face was burning with embarrassment as I walked down
Lancaster Avenue, but I didn't yet know how bad it was going to
get.
</P>
<P>
   For in just a few seconds, the door of the store opened and out
came the clerk.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sonny!'' he shouted, ``Sonny, come here!''
</P>
<P>
   Sonny?
</P>
<P>
   I turned around and held up my hands, as if to ask what he
wanted.
</P>
<P>
   He held up my 10th-grade geometry book.
</P>
<P>
   ``You left your school books here. I'm sure you'll be needing
them.''
</P>
<P>
   And I never went in that store again.

 &HT;    Old-fashioned remedy
 &HT;    By Jim Minter
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   FAYETTE COUNTY, Ga. _ One of advantages of growing up rural and
countrified is I've never had the reputation of being a suave
Southern gentleman. This lack of certain social graces serves me
well in an era of new and complicated rules of conduct.
</P>
<P>
   I have often heard myself described as introverted, a bore and
even timid. Certainly, I've never been the life of a party.
</P>
<P>
   For several reasons, among them being the face I see in the
mirror when I shave and such deficiencies as an inability to match
neckties and socks to the rest of my attire, my relationships with
the opposite sex have generally and historically been rather
distant.
</P>
<P>
   I've never bothered to flirt with flight attendants and
waitresses, the favorite pastime of many American males whenever
they are beyond the range of domestic surveillance. Such an
expenditure of energy on my part would at best be a waste of time
and at worst an embarrassing rebuff.
</P>
<P>
   When I was gainfully employed in the work force, I was inclined
to steer away from water fountains whenever a pretty young thing
headed in that direction. Being well-trained at home, I certainly
never asked a female associate to bring me a cup of coffee, nor
have I been so indiscreet as to comment on a dress or a hairdo worn
by a female under the age of 85. I don't think I'd risk such
behavior even if my wife didn't have the antenna of a Scotland Yard
detective. In other words, I run scared.
</P>
<P>
   While it might be nice to be known as a suave Casanova _ or
better still, a rogue _ my natural reticence in relationships with
the opposite sex has paid off. I don't think I'm likely to be
accused of sexual harassment, although I'm not altogether sure what
it is.
</P>
<P>
   To be on the safe side, I've re-evaluated my demeanor whenever
I'm in the presence of any female other than my wife or
granddaughter. Not only do I observe Emily Post's rule of never
initiating a handshake, I take care to keep my hands clasped behind
my back. Although a dress may be a designer model from Saks or
Neiman Marcus, I never proffer a compliment. If it is either
low-cut or short-cut and displayed on a well-put-together body, I
don't merely refrain from comment. I head for the other side of the
room on the chance I might be caught looking.
</P>
<P>
   Since Clarence Thomas got in deep trouble with indiscreet
chitchat and almost didn't get confirmed to the Supreme Court, I
haven't taken chances in anything resembling sexual harassment.
Individuals can get into a lot of trouble. So can municipalities.
</P>
<P>
   The city of Fayetteville is being asked to shell out $125,000
because the city manager allegedly sexually harassed an employee.
We don't know the details because the city is being very secretive.
All we know is the city manager, since departed, got in trouble
with certain female employees at city hall, and now one of his
alleged victims is asking the city for $125,000 in lieu of a
lawsuit.
</P>
<P>
   One reason you see more of these lawsuits cropping up is because
of other rules changes. In the old days, an irate spouse or
boyfriend would simply call on the offending party, black his eye,
or worse, and let him explain to his spouse or girlfriend as best
he could.
</P>
<P>
   The accused former city manager admits he said some things out
of line and claims other people at city hall, including some of the
complaining women, also made sex jokes. The versions are a piece
apart.
</P>
<P>
   This is a case I wouldn't mind seeing in court. It could help
clear up what sexual harassment really is, and if it's what I think
it is, maybe I can relax and be more sociable in company of
womenfolk. It must be more than bragging on a new outfit, even when
the skirt rides well above a shapely knee.
</P>
<P>
   ''Have you ever been sexually harassed?'' I asked my wife.
</P>
<P>
   ''You mean by someone other than you?''
</P>
<P>
   ''Like someone you meet in business,'' I said.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'd say so,'' she answered. ''It happens.''
</P>
<P>
   I didn't ask her if she'd be embarrassed to admit she never had
been.
</P>
<P>
   ''How would you define sexual harassment?'' I asked.
</P>
<P>
   ''It can be nothing much, or it can be really demeaning and
offensive,'' she replied.
</P>
<P>
   ''What is it when it's nothing much?'' I asked.
</P>
<P>
   ''We used to call it flirting,'' she said. ''With women being so
much smarter than men, flirting is easy to handle.''
</P>
<P>
   ''I know you don't have a boss, but if you had a boss, and he
got seriously out of line, and his bosses didn't do anything about
it, would you get a lawyer?'' I asked.
</P>
<P>
   ''I sure would,'' she said. ''We'd need one to keep you out of
jail.''
</P>
<P>
   Obviously, we need to keep sexual harassment out of the
workplace. I wonder what happened to the old-fashioned remedy of
simply slapping an offender up-side his head.

 &HT;    Think gas is high? Try buying other items by the gallon
 &HT;    By Stephen J. O'Brien
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WACO, Texas _ Woe this world of high gas prices. A gallon of
regular unleaded costs anywhere from $1.38 a gallon to more than
$1.50 a gallon. Let's not even talk about super unleaded.
</P>
<P>
   The soaring price of fuel has hit all parts of the nation.
Truckers are lobbying Congress to address a problem they say is
crippling their industry. Airline companies are threatening to
raise ticket prices.
</P>
<P>
   And Wednesday night at a department store perfume counter,
Michele Thompson looked over a display of exotic aromas, where the
meaning _ and cost _ of a gallon was something altogether
different. Far from the upwardly mobile digits at the local gas
pump, there were liquids of all varieties, from perfumes and body
lotions to cleaning supplies and shampoo, that carried their own
sort of sticker shock.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's amazing how much it actually costs when you look at it
like that,'' Thompson said as she perused the display of perfumes.
``I guess people don't really think about it. It's not something
you use a lot.''
</P>
<P>
   We took a nonscientific survey of some popular products at local
stores to see what a gallon of the different liquids would cost,
not calculating any bulk-purchase discounts. Many of the products
we priced are not marketed or intended to be sold by the gallon,
but just in case you had a hankering for 128 ounces of your
favorite soft drink, four quarts of a name-brand toothpaste or 8
pints of Ralph Lauren's newest fragrance, we went ahead and did the
math.
</P>
<P>
   Lauren's Romance perfume, one of the more popular fragrances
around, comes in a 3.4-ounce container for $60. A gallon of the
sultry smelling potion would cost you $2,252.80. Think that makes
the price of premium unleaded sound a little better?
</P>
<P>
   Estee Lauder's Resilience Lift Eye Creme comes in half-ounce
containers for $42.50. Buying 128 ounces of the facial enhancer
would cost somewhere around $10,880.
</P>
<P>
   Fixing up your nails by the gallon could get a bit pricey, too.
OPI Nail Lacquer, which comes in half-ounce containers for $6,
would run about $1,536 per gallon.
</P>
<P>
   At the grocery store, things get a little better. A 6.2-ounce
tube of Crest toothpaste sells for $2.98. A full gallon of it would
cost $62.
</P>
<P>
   Advanced Healing Vaseline Intensive Care Lotion is $3.47 for an
11-ounce bottle. That comes to $40 per gallon. Suave Shampoo would
cost $11 a gallon; Clairol Herbal Essences about $40 per gallon.
</P>
<P>
   A 6-pack of Coors Light costs $5.19. That's $9.23 per gallon. A
gallon of Coke Classic would cost $2.61 per gallon.
</P>
<P>
   And what about water? Surely, it's cheaper than gasoline, you
say. Guess again. Ozarka Natural Spring Water sells for 69 cents
per 8 ounces. That's $11.04 a gallon.
</P>
<P>
   For cleaning up, original Windex runs $10.68 per gallon. Ultra
Palmolive dishwashing liquid comes out to $12.29 per gallon.
</P>
<P>
   If you're planning on some work around the house this weekend,
here are some prices that might make you think twice.
</P>
<P>
   A gallon of Elmer's Carpenter Wood Glue costs $9.75. Clear
satin, fast-drying polyurethane costs $19.93 a gallon. A 128-ounce
container of paint thinner runs $1.84.
</P>
<P>
   A 16-ounce bottle of Homelite two-cycle engine oil cost $3.94.
That averages out to about 25 cents per ounce or $32 a gallon.
Real-Kill Home Insect Control is $5.68 a gallon. Flea and Tick
Shampoo is $30 per gallon.
</P>
<P>
   Roundup Weed and Grass Killer concentrate costs $76 per gallon.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just pour gasoline on 'em,'' David Billy of Dallas said as
he shopped for lawn equipment Wednesday night. ``It's cheaper than
that stuff. But you have to watch out. It kills everything.''
</P>
<P>
   And on the next isle, a one-gallon gas can costs $2.98.

 &HT;    A healer in search of healing
 &HT;    By Janet Wilson
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ Gerald Mann flew halfway around the world to
stand under an expansive African sky and gaze at the Southern
Cross.
</P>
<P>
   It was a pilgrimage of sorts. The last time he'd seen the
constellation he and his wife, Lois, had pointed to the stars,
saying, ``There's Cynthia and that one's Stacey and there's J.J.,''
and on and on until every child and every grandchild had been
named.
</P>
<P>
   Then, standing arm in arm beneath the heavens, they thanked God
for their family and the wonderful life they shared.
</P>
<P>
   This time Mann stood alone. And wept openly.
</P>
<P>
   Several weeks earlier, Lois, his wife of 42 years, died from
complications after a series of heart surgeries. The pastor of
Riverbend Church, who had counseled thousands of people through
tragedies and loss, had always thought he knew what his bereaved
parishioners were feeling.
</P>
<P>
   But three weeks after Lois died at age 60, Mann told his
congregation he was sorry.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought I knew what it was like to lose a mate because I had
been with so many people who had,'' Mann told his audience that
day. ``I didn't understand. It's one of those things you have to
experience to really understand what it is like.''
</P>
<P>
   He returned to Africa this month because it is a place Lois
loved. Now, as he begins to build a life without her, he's finding
that some answers are more difficult to come by. He is a healer in
need of healing.
</P>
<P>
   ``Lois and I had a favorite saying that we batted back and
forth,'' says a subdued Mann, sitting in his church office
surrounded by memorabilia of their life together. ``I would say
'Everything will be all right.' And she'd say, 'Or, it won't. But
we'll get through it.' ''
</P>
<P>
   YOUNG LOVE
</P>
<P>
   Lois Mann grew up near Hemphill in East Texas in a house without
electricity or running water. Later, her family moved to a small
town near Houston where she was a popular high school student. Lois
was a cheerleader smitten with a young running back named Gerald
Mann.
</P>
<P>
   The two became sweethearts, and in 1958 they married.
</P>
<P>
   Mann, who was more familiar in those days with ``playing
football and drinking in bars and raising hell,'' had married a
devout Christian. Just three months after their wedding, on Easter
Sunday, he was sitting on a church pew next to Lois.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was there mainly to appease my wife,'' he remembers.
</P>
<P>
   But it would prove to be a life-changing experience. Gerald Mann
felt called to the ministry that day. With Lois by his side, he
graduated from the seminary and ultimately built Riverbend Church,
which has 10,000 members and an international ministry. Throughout
it all, Lois shunned the spotlight for a supporting role as the
``pastor's pastor,'' the one who counseled Mann through trying
times, always there to soothe his soul.
</P>
<P>
   ``They were good for one another,'' says Gordon Smith,
Riverbend's minister of pastoral care. ``They really complemented
each other with their different temperaments.''
</P>
<P>
   As his career took off and there were more demands on his time,
Lois had less time with her husband. That's why she loved their
trips to Africa so much.
</P>
<P>
   ``She used to say I had an eight-track mind and when we were in
Africa was the only time she could get all eight tracks,'' says
Mann, 61. ``Even though I know she never felt slighted, I'm
suffering from a lot of guilt now about the times I could have
spent with her, but didn't.''
</P>
<P>
   FIRST STEPS
</P>
<P>
   It took a while before Mann could bring himself to say Lois was
dead. It wasn't the big things he missed, not the exotic trips or
dinners with dignitaries, but the talks they shared each day. For
weeks after the funeral, he would drive home and, as he approached
the house, push the button to open the garage door and see her car
parked inside. For just a moment he would think she was home. Then
his excitement would be dashed as he realized she wasn't.
</P>
<P>
   When he could no longer stand seeing her car, he sold it. Now
when the garage door opens, he is hurt because the stall is empty.
</P>
<P>
   Knowing how deeply he was grieving, his family and friends
encouraged him to accept an invitation from a professional hunter
in Zimbabwe. The hunter and his wife, who had been friends of the
Manns for 20 years, urged Gerald to return to Africa on a healing
mission.
</P>
<P>
   He decided to go.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought of Lois almost every day and great waves of sadness
would come over me, especially at sunset,'' Mann says of his time
in Africa. ``I returned to the pulpit too soon after her death. I'm
glad I took this extra time off.''
</P>
<P>
   Smith says the trip ``was really good medicine for him.''
</P>
<P>
   ``When he was at the office he was busy and tended to delay his
grief work,'' Smith says. ``Over there he had time to focus on it.
It gave him the chance to let it sink in.''
</P>
<P>
   Even sorrow has its lessons, and Mann says what he has learned
will help him minister to others.
</P>
<P>
   There is no ``one-size-fits-all grief process,'' he says.
``Grief is as individual as people.''
</P>
<P>
   People should accept that guilt and blame are par for the
course, Mann advises, but not to give in to those feelings.
</P>
<P>
   ``Do whatever you have to do to get through it,'' he says.
``Even be angry at God if you need to. Letting go of your grief is
the toughest thing you'll do. The hardest thing to accept is that
you can let go of the grief without letting go of the person you
loved.''
</P>
<P>
   Smith says he knows life is lonely for Mann now.
</P>
<P>
   ``You never recover because that's a lifelong process,'' Smith
says. ``But he will heal up, where the pain is not as acute as it
is now. He will get the spring back in his step and life will look
good again.''
</P>
<P>
   Mann hasn't lost his zeal for work. ``There's much more to be
done at Riverbend,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   He also has a teen-ager to consider. Lois and Gerald Mann, with
the help of the girl's father, had been raising their oldest
granddaughter, 13-year-old Jessica Manney. She is one of four
grandchildren.
</P>
<P>
   ``Having her with me keeps me focused on the future and not the
past,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   And his church family has been ever vigilant.
</P>
<P>
   When he returned from Africa, Mann was overwhelmed by the stacks
and stacks of cards and letters from around the world, notes from
people whose lives Lois had touched as well as those expressing
sorrow over her death.
</P>
<P>
   It was an unexpected outpouring of support and love.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have never in my life felt like the 'beloved pastor,' ''
Mann says. ``That's not anyone else's fault, but my own bad stuff.
I've always been a dreamer and rainbow chaser.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now, for the first time, I feel loved in a way I never have
before.''

   TEEPEN-COLUMN _ The conservative majority of the U.S. Supreme
Court did congressional Republicans no favor when it held that the
federal Food and Drug Administration lacks the authority to
regulate tobacco as a drug. Though it was certainly not the
justices' intention to do so, the ruling hands Democrats another
big-stick issue with which to pound Republicans in this especially

   KLEINBERG-COLUMN _ MIAMI _ The decision of a federal judge in
the custody case of little Elian Gonzalez has once again stirred

   GLASS-COLUMN _ WASHINGTON _ John McCain has pursued the need to

   AFRICA-AIDSORPHANS _ ZIMBABWE _ In sub-Saharan Africa, 23.3
million people _ most of them women _ are infected with HIV/AIDS,
compared to less than 1 million in North America. There were 2.2
million deaths from AIDS in the region in 1999 ? representing 85
percent of the world's HIV-related fatalities, even though only 10
percent of the world's population lives in the region. The disease
is destroying entire villages, but beyond that is robbing these
countries of a whole generation of potentially productive people.
Perhaps the most grim by-product is the staggering fact that the
disease has created more than 10 million orphans a number that is
expected to soar to 13 million next year. The implications of this
are devastating. (Roughton, Cox News Service). WITH PHOTOS and

Verschoor sits down daily at the family computer to stay in touch
with her toddler's playgroup, scan upcoming events at the nearby
community center and keep up on neighborhood concerns. But
Verschoor is no nerd. She kew little about computers and the
Internet until she and her husband, Scott, moved last year to DC
Ranch, a high-tech housing development taking shape in the desert
foothills on the northern fringes of Phoenix's urban sprawl. Amid
the personal-computing boom, real-estate developers and architects
across the country are collaborating on new neighborhoods that
feature high-speed connections marrying the Internet, television
and telephone services. But DC Ranch is not intended as an
exclusive haven for the pocket protector crowd. The Arizona
developers, DMB Associates, have taken their technology a step
further by encouraging the use of computers to build personal
relationships among the suburbanites. (Holmes, Cox News Service).

   OSCARS-PREVIEW (Undated) _ First the ballots get lost in a
postal snafu. Next a ``professional rummager'' finds 52 stolen
Oscars in the trash in L.A.'s Koreatown. We've graduated from
Oscarmania to vicarious enjoyment of the sabotage _ which I suppose
is merely a heightened strain of Oscarmania. The mood is
contagious. And with the NCAA tourney falling apart faster than
Bobby Knight's temper, Sunday night's Oscar awards show might be
all the March Madness anybody needs. Herewith: Predictions,
feelings. By WESLEY MORRIS.
</P>
<P>
   OSCARS-COMEDY (Undated) _ Hey, Oscar _ think you could lighten
up a touch? Death isn't all there is to life, you know. There are
other things. Chocolate, for instance. Chickadees. Jim Carrey
movies. Whoa _ sore subject for the Oscarooni. Oscar doesn't like
commedians, as anyone knows who has paid attention to the Academy
Award nominations, much less the actual awards, for the past two
years. By AMY BIANCOLLI. (For release Sunday, March 26.)
</P>
<P>
   FILM-REVIEW-TITUS (Undated) _ ``Titus'' is a furious, bloody,
overindulgent, overcooked, maniacally entertaining Shakespeare
adaptation (nee ``Titus Andronicus'') from the crowned queen of
Broadway, Julie Taymor (``The Lion King''). By AMY BIANCOLLI.
</P>
<P>
   FILM-REVIEW-WHATEVER (Undated) _ You know ``Whatever It Takes''
is some kind of quaint high-school comedy/teen romance when a kid
actually uses ``smells like teen spirit'' to describe the vibe at a
party. Then, later, the Moby jam on the soundtrack is shut off so a
boy can eke out a version of ``I'll Melt With You'' on his
accordion for his girl. Hey, it brought a tear to her eye, and it
might bring one to yours, too. By WESLEY MORRIS.
</P>
<P>
   FILM-REVIEW-WAKING (Undated) _ On a college campus somewhere,
there blooms a love like Fielding and Sarah's. He wants to be
president and is on the Democratic fast track to Congress; she's an
activist who hates the U.S. government. It's 1971 or '72 and they
meet at a magazine run by Fielding's leftist brother and seem able
to put away their collegiate righteousness. By WESLEY MORRIS.

martyr. By MARK McGUIRE.

 &HT;    Don't need same-sex marriage; we do need law to recognize
couples
 &HT;    By John Young
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WACO, Texas _ Social conservatives across the country stand at
the plate, hands tightly around the bat, waiting to knock a big fat
pitch from Vermont out of the park.
</P>
<P>
   Then, Vermont throws a butterfly knuckler.
</P>
<P>
   Holy hernia, batman.
</P>
<P>
   Several months ago, the Vermont Supreme Court ruled that
homosexuals were unconstitutionally denied the rights and benefits
of marriage. The court suggested strongly that the state broaden
marriage statutes.
</P>
<P>
   Instantly, the faxes and e-mails of the right were cranking
across the country plying the great political wedge issue of modern
times: homosexuality.
</P>
<P>
   Vermont, the messages warned, was about to put every state in
the nation in the position of having to recognized gay and lesbian
marriage.
</P>
<P>
   The wedge drivers weren't afraid. They were drowning in their
own saliva. They pictured the prospect of making same-sex marriage
an issue in campaign after campaign for statehouses. What better
way to ``out'' liberal agents of moral decay?
</P>
<P>
   But Vermont lawmakers may have left the mad faxers with a case
of cotton mouth.
</P>
<P>
   Instead of passing a bill legalizing gay and lesbian marriage,
Vermont's legislature has sent to the governor a bill to create
``civil unions'' _ not marriages but arrangements that give
same-sex couples some of the same rights and obligations that
marriage does.
</P>
<P>
   That includes joint title to property, the right to sue over the
loss of a partner, the right to be joint beneficiaries in insurance
policies and to be treated similarly to a spouse in probate
matters. A civil union also would have to be dissolved in divorce
court.
</P>
<P>
   A marriage by another name? A duck called a goose? Vermont has
artfully dodged the name game.
</P>
<P>
   Reacting to a 1993 ruling by Hawaii's Supreme Court that would
have cleared the way for same-sex marriages (later the voters
changed the state constitution to ban it), 30 states passed
pre-emptive laws saying they wouldn't recognize same-sex marriages
if legalized in any other state.
</P>
<P>
   In the Super Tuesday primary, California voters did the same.
(However, California does recognize domestic partnerships, as do a
host of municipalities and corporations.)
</P>
<P>
   Now, has Vermont laid all those pre-emptive laws to waste?
</P>
<P>
   It's a travesty that loving, committed lifelong couples cannot
be recognized as that in the eyes of the law. At its root is
nothing more than religion masquerading as law. ``In God's eyes''
is how marriage is commonly framed, end of argument. But government
is not a divine institution. Unfortunately, this barrier of illogic
will survive until the U.S. Supreme Court tears it down.
</P>
<P>
   A civil union has nothing to do with religion. It has to do with
contracts and commitments. Seemingly, everyone who values social
responsibility would encourage what a civil union represents.
</P>
<P>
   Heterosexuals who have no other stake in the matter, who have no
friends or relatives being discriminated against because of their
sexual orientation, should at least look at the civil-union option
in public health terms.
</P>
<P>
   In the age of AIDS, sexual monogamy is a life-or-death matter.
The irony of AIDS, with its prevalence among gay men, is that while
urging faithfulness to one partner as the best way to prevent it,
we make it illegal for the most at-risk population to ``make it
legal.''
</P>
<P>
   Vermont has given other states a vehicle to end this argument in
the best possible way, leaving ``holy matrimony'' intact, or at
least extracting holiness from the debate in making civil law.
</P>
<P>
   Same-sex marriage is an unnecessary distinction. It's the union
that matters.

at a Palestinian refugee camp and the sniping over Jerusalem that

<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ First the ballots get lost in a postal snafu.
Next a ``professional rummager'' finds 52 stolen Oscars in the
trash in L.A.'s Koreatown. We have graduated from Oscarmania to
vicarious enjoyment of the sabotage, which I suppose is merely a
heightened strain of Oscarmania.
</P>
<P>
   The mood is contagious. And with the National Collegiate
Athletic Association basketball tournament falling apart faster
than Bobby Knight's temper, Sunday night's Oscar awards show might
be all the March Madness anybody needs.
</P>
<P>
   Herewith: Predictions, feelings.
</P>
<P>
   ___
</P>
<P>
   BEST PICTURE
</P>
<P>
   Should win:
</P>
<P>
   ``The Insider''? Only if it's 1975 and there's no ``Nashville,''
``Shampoo,'' ``Cuckoo's Nest,'' ``Jaws,'' ``Barry Lyndon'' or ``Dog
Day Afternoon.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The Cider House Rules''? Only if the four other nominees are
``The Cider House Rules,'' ``The Cider House Rules,'' ``The Cider
House Rules'' and ``The Cider House Rules'' - and as a promotional
tie-in, Planned Parenthood hands out apples and copies of the
Saturday Evening Post, too.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Green Mile''? You're kidding, right?
</P>
<P>
   And ``American Beauty''? Only if I'd never been to the suburbs
and had never read a John Updike or Philip Roth novel.
</P>
<P>
   That leaves ``The Sixth Sense,'' the only one of these movies
that actually improves upon a second or third encounter.
</P>
<P>
   Will win: ``American Beauty.'' (``John or Philip who?'')
</P>
<P>
   ___
</P>
<P>
   BEST ACTOR
</P>
<P>
   Should Win: Russell Crowe. Heartbreak, rage and searing
vulnerability _ with a potbelly! (Or Denzel Washington, a galvanic
force on a disposable soapbox.)
</P>
<P>
   Will win: Kevin Spacey. Someone has been taking his Jack Lemmon
pills!
</P>
<P>
   ___
</P>
<P>
   BEST ACTRESS
</P>
<P>
   Should Win: Hilary Swank. More than a sock in a crotch. Her
emotional investment goes so deep she can't fathom it.
</P>
<P>
   Will win: Annette Bening. ``Boy, Warren's highly versatile, very
preggers wife sure was juicy in that glorified supporting role.''
</P>
<P>
   ___
</P>
<P>
   BEST SUPPORTING ACTOR
</P>
<P>
   Should win: Haley Joel Osment. At last: A kid who's earned the
right to make us say all three of his names.
</P>
<P>
   Will win: I see a precocious Oscar speech.
</P>
<P>
   ___
</P>
<P>
   BEST SUPPORTING ACTRESS
</P>
<P>
   Should win: Those are my hands thrown up. Chloe Sevigny showed
me how to love Swank. Toni Colette showed me how to love the
paranoid Osment. Catherine Keener showed me how to love Cameron
Diaz and John Malkovich _ acerbically, hilariously and at the same
time. So, her.
</P>
<P>
   Will win: Angelina Jolie. She made crazy and emaciated
Academy-friendly. (Though I'm getting a Brenda Fricker-in-``My Left
Foot'' vibe about Colette.)
</P>
<P>
   ___
</P>
<P>
   BEST DIRECTOR
</P>
<P>
   Should win: Spike Jonze. Was John Malkovich's head not the most
fascinating ride you got on last year?
</P>
<P>
   Will win: Sam Mendes, ``American Beauty.'' Emmy season comes
early!
</P>
<P>
   ___
</P>
<P>
   ORIGINAL SCREENPLAY
</P>
<P>
   Should win: Charlie Kaufman, ``Being John Malkovich.''
Metaphorically sound, metaphysically amazing.
</P>
<P>
   Will win: Alan Ball, ``American Beauty.'' Yes, I've seen his ABC
show ``Oh Grow Up,'' but, still, that monologue about the plastic
bag was pretty beautiful.
</P>
<P>
   ___
</P>
<P>
   ADAPTED SCREENPLAY
</P>
<P>
   Should win: Alexander Payne and Jim Taylor, ``Election.'' They
left all the raunch and ethical ambivalence in Tom Perotta's novel.
</P>
<P>
   Will win: John Irving. It's his book and, dude, it ``Rules.''
</P>
<P>
   ___
</P>
<P>
   ORIGINAL SONG
</P>
<P>
   Should win: ``Blame Canada.'' PT Anderson leaned so hard on
Aimee Mann and her songs that she belongs in the supporting
category, but each vulgar tune in ``South Park: Bigger, Longer and
Uncut'' was a movie unto itself.
</P>
<P>
   Will win: The race comes down to the cheesiest balladeer on
Earth (Diane Warren, ``Music of the Heart'') vs. the cheesiest
drummer on earth (Phil Collins, ``Tarzan''). Beat a snare: Collins
used Pamesano Reggiano.
</P>
<P>
   ___
</P>
<P>
   FOREIGN LANGUAGE FILM
</P>
<P>
   Should win: ``All About My Mother``
</P>
<P>
   Will win: ``East-West.'' It has Catherine Deneuve, World War II
romance and, yes, World War II.
</P>
<P>
   ___
</P>
<P>
   ORIGINAL SCORE
</P>
<P>
   Should win: Gabriel Yared, ``The Talented Mr. Ripley''

   Will win: Rachel Portman, ``The Cider House Rules''
</P>
<P>
   ___
</P>
<P>
   ART DIRECTION

<P>
   Should win: ``Sleepy Hollow''
</P>
<P>
   Will win: ``Anna and the King''
</P>
<P>
   ___
</P>
<P>
   CINEMATOGRAPHY
</P>
<P>
   Should win: The best, tightest race of the year. To pick one _
``Sleepy Hollow's'' Emmanuel Lubezki for making funny nightmares
with strobe lights and shadows.
</P>
<P>
   Will win: Conrad Hall, ``American Beauty.'' His framing was
gorgeous. Even better, he made Mena Suvari look like she was
starring in ``American Booty.''
</P>
<P>
   ___
</P>
<P>
   EDITING
</P>
<P>
   Should win: ``The Matrix''

   LAGUNA SAN IGNACIO, MEXICO _ No place on earth exists like this
distant lagoon in the middle of Mexico's Baja California coast.
</P>
<P>
   Waves gently lap onto deserted shell-strewn beaches and stars
shine by the millions. And one of the sea's most enigmatic
behemoths, the gray whale, is willing to swim up to human beings
and allow a species that has killed them to caress their
barnacle-encrusted backs.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sometimes when you scratch them they open their mouths. I even
touched a tongue once,'' laughed whale-watch guide Romualdo
Fischer, one of the local fishermen who used to fear and avoid the
whales until the late 1960s.
</P>
<P>
   Environmentalists say they hope this magical relationship
between human and marine mammal will be preserved forever thanks to
a March 2 decision by Mexican President Ernesto Zedillo to scrap a
plan to build a salt-mining operation here in partnership with
Japan's Mitsubishi Corp.
</P>
<P>
   An isolated inlet 600 miles south of San Diego and three hours
from the nearest paved road, the San Ignacio Lagoon is the last
gray whale breeding habitat on Baja's coast that is untouched by
commercial development. Every winter, the whales, which were an
endangered species until five years ago, swim into the lagoon after
a 6,000-mile migration from the Arctic Circle.
</P>
<P>
   Here they mate or give birth and train their young for the
rigors of life. Once hunted to the brink of extinction by Americans
who called them ``devil fish,'' the whales _ which can weigh up to
30 tons _ are now beloved by tourists who delight in the hiss and
spray of their powerful spouts. Hands reach out to pet the whales
as they cavort next to boats, curious to investigate the human
cargo.
</P>
<P>
   In 1988, Mexico's president declared the San Ignacio Lagoon and
a vast 6.2 million-acre desert around it the Vizcaino Biosphere
Reserve, the largest such protected area in Latin America.
Zedillo's decision to call off the salt mine _ which would have
sucked water out of the lagoon and created miles of salt flats _
came after a five-year battle by Mexican and American
environmentalists that many consider the most significant victory
of their generation.
</P>
<P>
   The environmentalists forged a sophisticated model for action
they say could be replicated around the world to win similar fights
to save habitat.
</P>
<P>
   They filed a barrage of lawsuits in Mexican courts, and enlisted
the help of sympathetic scientists and celebrities like James Bond
movie star Pierce Brosnan.
</P>
<P>
   They used the Internet to link supporters in the Americas, Asia
and Europe, and convinced 43 California cities to adopt resolutions
against the plant and 15 U.S.-based mutual funds to pledge not to
invest in Mitsubishi. They started a consumer boycott of Mitsubishi
dealerships as well as other products, in California and bombarded
the company with more than 1 million protest postcards.
</P>
<P>
   In short, they embarrassed the Mexican government and
Mitsubishi.
</P>
<P>
   ``We ran this campaign like a modern political campaign, but
always with advice from the Mexicans,'' said Fred O'Regan,
president of the Massachusetts-based International Fund for Animal
Welfare.
</P>
<P>
   More than 50 Mexican environmental groups joined the coalition
to stop the salt mine, and emerged from the experience stronger
than ever. The rule of law, always vulnerable in Mexico, received a
tremendous boost, said Alberto Szekely, the coalition's Mexican
lawyer.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a victory for all because we were able to make our
laws prevail,'' Szekely said. ``If the development had been
allowed, protections for all of Mexico's other reserves would have
crumbled.''
</P>
<P>
   Szekely filed repeated lawsuits in Mexico arguing that the
proposed salt mine violated this country's environmental laws and
the rights of fishermen living near the lagoon in a community
called Punta Abreojos. He had already won the suit on behalf of
fishermen in one hearing last October, and he expected his case to
be upheld if the fight had continued.
</P>
<P>
   Szekely also successfully sued Mexican environmental
authorities, forcing them to sanction the government and Mitsubishi
for infractions committed at an existing salt mine about 100 miles
to the north on the edge of another inlet, Scammon's Lagoon.
</P>
<P>
   That salt operation was found guilty of dumping batteries and
industrial discharge into a lagoon where whales also congregate.
Allegations of whether wildlife was harmed by these infractions
remain disputed.
</P>
<P>
   Mexican writer and environmentalist Homero Aridjis was the first
person to signal the alarm over the second proposed salt factory.
Trying to protect animal habitat in Mexico, he said, is often a
frustrating exercise because laws are so frequently ignored.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think this time President Zedillo saw this had spilled out
beyond borders and that it might damage him politically,'' Aridjis
said with satisfaction.
</P>
<P>
   In the wake of this historic victory, however, environmentalists
now face the challenge of addressing the concerns of several
thousand fishermen in this isolated area who would like more stable
jobs and better education, health care and infrastructure here.
</P>
<P>
   Otherwise, environmentalists acknowledged, they now run the risk
of being seen as rich interlopers with little credibility.
</P>
<P>
   ``The environmental community needs to demonstrate that it's not
just going to walk away from these people,'' said Robert F. Kennedy
Jr., a leading critic of the salt mine who flew to the lagoon this
month with other activists to celebrate Zedillo's decision.
</P>
<P>
   Kennedy is a lawyer for the Natural Resources Defense Council,
an American environmental group.
</P>
<P>
   On the east side of the lagoon, residents must truck in their
drinking water from the nearest desert oasis, which is several
hours away. There is no high school, and only parents that can
afford room and board send their children away to study. Doctors
only visit the area every few weeks. And there is no power source
except for a few solar panels.
</P>
<P>
   Many of the fishermen already are developing campsites and whale
watching for tourists here. But that activity only lasts for
several months out of the year. Most have to seek work elsewhere or
return to fishing full-time to make a living. Some initially
supported the salt mine, which would have provided construction
employment, 200 permanent jobs and cash for the area.
</P>
<P>
   Jorge Peon, a fisherman who also owns a landing strip near the
lagoon, said most local residents turned against the project
because they feared it would spoil their fishing and nascent
whale-watching operations.
</P>
<P>
   But Peon offered a cautionary tale, explaining that people might
still be tempted to mismanage the lagoon if they face economic
hardship.
</P>
<P>
   Some years back, Peon said, fishermen in his cooperative had
such a dismal year they gave themselves permission to illegally
slaughter endangered sea turtles here.
</P>
<P>
   ``We ate them and sold them,'' Peon said. ``I know if people in
the United States read this it will drop like a bomb . . . But
families were desperate.''
</P>
<P>
   To show they mean business with the fishermen, Mexican
environmentalists brought community development experts with them
on the victory tour.
</P>
<P>
   ``The next battle is to bring these people what they need and
what they deserve,'' said Melba Pria, director-general for Mexico's
National Institute for Indigenous Affairs. Experienced in
developing jobs in areas that are culturally and environmentally
sensitive, Pria personally opposed the salt factory.
</P>
<P>
   The village of Punta Abreojos, which sits on the ocean near the
mouth of the lagoon, could provide a model for well-managed fishing
in the area.
</P>
<P>
   The village of 1,000 inhabitants has run a fishing cooperative
since the 1930s that exports abalone, lobster and other seafood to
Asia and the United States.
</P>
<P>
   The cooperative is so prosperous, said Ana Maria Sandoval, that
she and her eight siblings were all able to attend schools of
higher education and become professionals.
</P>
<P>
   Punta Abreojos was almost solidly against the salt mine, which
would have placed an enormous ocean pier in the middle of sensitive
lobster habitat the community depends on.
</P>
<P>
   The town threw a feast and celebration for environmentalists
after Zedillo announced the salt mine's demise. Children sang songs
_ ``Pollution! No! No! No!'' _ and oysters and lobsters sizzled on
a beachside grill.
</P>
<P>
   ``The salt company tried to convince us by saying they would
pave our streets. They would bring us a big highway. said Brenda
Gayita, a university student home for a visit. ``But in exchange
for what?''
</P>
<P>
   (EDs: Story can end here. Optional add follows.)
</P>
<P>
   While the environmentalists assembled scientists who argued that
the salt plant would disturb the lagoon's sensitive ecosystem _ and
the whales _ Mitsubishi fought back with its own team of experts,
who contended that whales had co-existed well with the salt
operation on Scammon's Lagoon.
</P>
<P>
   Stephen Wechselblatt, a vice president of public relations at
Mitsubishi International in New York, said the environmentalists
ultimately won by portraying themselves as ``David against
Goliath.''
</P>
<P>
   In the end, President Zedillo saved face for the government and
Mitsubishi by declaring that the salt-mining operation probably was
compatible with the lagoon, but would certainly disturb the
landscape.
</P>
<P>
   Zedillo, some environmentalists suggested, may have also been
reluctant to allow a allow a controversial development in an area
that was designated a United Nation's World Heritage Site in 1993.
</P>
<P>
   Andres Rosental, Mexico's former ambassador to the United
Nations, also suggested that Mexican authorities are more attuned
to the demands of environmentalists now.
</P>
<P>
   Rosental _ who knows Zedillo _ was a powerful lobbyist against
the salt mine, enlisting the help of Mexican entrepreneurs who
donated space to put up billboards in Mexico City denouncing the
project.
</P>
<P>
   ``Up until now,'' Rosental said, ``Mexico has had a reputation
for being easier to do business in than the United States or Canada
when it comes to environmental laws. But this now shows that the
government can't just plow ahead as it has done in the past.''

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ In the years after the Soviet Union's
disintegration, the United States has sent Russia more than $7
billion to safeguard its nuclear arsenal, feed its people, prop up
its space program and nourish the seedlings of a private enterprise
economy.
</P>
<P>
   The results have been, by almost all accounts, less than
stellar.
</P>
<P>
   Russia's economy has taken a nose-dive. Its space program fell
behind in building its components for the International Space
Station, creating delays for the project and cost overruns for U.S.
taxpayers.
</P>
<P>
   And despite a six-year effort and a half-billion dollars in U.S.
assistance, only a small amount of Russia's nuclear materials are
now stored in secure buildings.
</P>
<P>
   Even so, there are few signs that America is about to cut off
the aid spigot, now that acting President Vladimir Putin, the
former KGB officer, moves toward becoming Russia's second
democratically elected president.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've already tolerated all kinds of shenanigans in Russia for
a very long time,'' said Dan Goure, a deputy director at the
Washington research group, Center for Strategic and International
Studies.
</P>
<P>
   ``Putin would have to go almost out of his way to do something
so outrageous, so anti-American that it would cause either (the
United States or Russia) to ratchet back their relationship.''
</P>
<P>
   Goure and others readily concede that direct American aid, plus
$22.6 billion in loans from the International Monetary Fund and $11
billion from the World Bank have not accomplished a great deal
toward solving Russia's problems.
</P>
<P>
   Yet he held that it is hard to see how any U.S. administration
would suspend aid to a country with the world's largest land mass
and a second largest stockpile of nuclear weaponry. ``If anything
goes wrong, the blame falls on the administration,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, one outspoken critic of aid to Russia predicted that
Putin may prove more successful in dealing with the United States
than his ailing predecessor Boris Yeltsin, whose U.S. relations
went from sweet to sour during his often-rocky tenure.
</P>
<P>
   ``Putin is smarter, shrewder and more calculating,'' said David
Kramer, senior fellow at the Project for the New American Century,
a small conservative research group based in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   ``Direct bilateral aid, in financial terms, is not very
significant for propping up Putin,'' Kramer said. But, he added
that it has symbolic power: ``It sends a political message: if
there is no change in (aid) policy, then it suggests that we are
continuing business as usual.''
</P>
<P>
   Putin's strategy has been to talk tough and crack down on
Chechen rebels at home as he proposes more accommodation on nuclear
issues abroad. He has endorsed ratification for the long-delayed
START II missile treaty, and said he might be open to changing the
Anti-Ballistic Missile treaty to permit a U.S. missile defense
system.
</P>
<P>
   The new Russian leader also restored NATO ties which had been
frayed during the U.S.-led bombing of Yugoslavia last year.
</P>
<P>
   Such talk could avert attention from Russian problems, ranging
from widespread corruption to the glacial pace of reforms and
disarmament.
</P>
<P>
   But evidence of friction in U.S.-Russian joint efforts
continues. Among recent examples, the U.S. General Accounting
Office warned earlier this month that Russia and the rest of the
old Soviet Union still have 650 metric tons of enriched uranium and
plutonium. That's enough to make about 40,000 nuclear bombs.
</P>
<P>
   Most of those nuclear materials remain in unsecured buildings
and under increasing threat of theft, said the GAO, which is the
investigative arm of Congress.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, after spending $481 million over six years, the United
States completed installation of security systems for just 7
percent of that material, the accounting office reported.
</P>
<P>
   The slow pace was traced largely to resistance from the Russian
government, which has locked U.S. officials out of the nuclear
weapons complex where much of the material is stored. Moreover, the
Russian government has soaked up some of the U.S. aid by taxing it.
</P>
<P>
   American costs for safeguarding and dismantling the nuclear
arsenal have reached $5 billion with no clear end in sight.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everyone recognizes that these are large amounts of money,''
said Jon B. Wolfsthal, an associate with the Carnegie Endowment for
Peace and a former special assistant and policy adviser for the
U.S. Department of Energy, which runs much of nuclear safeguard
efforts in Russia.
</P>
<P>
   ``At the same time, there's no way to overstate the threat that
the United States now faces from the former of Soviet Union,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   He cited the nuclear material watched over by guards who had no
coats or boots in the winter and no pay in summer, and nuclear
weapons labs where Russian scientists, unpaid for months at a time,
could sell their expertise to Iran, Iraq or China.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. subsidies have not been completely successful, he
acknowledged, but he added, ``Half a loaf is better than no loaf.''
</P>
<P>
   Problems have also haunted the U.S.-Russian space projects.
</P>
<P>
   Russia's failure to complete its space station components on
time have been estimated by the House Science Committee to have
cost billions of dollars in extra expenses to NASA.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, congressional investigators are currently looking into
safety problems with two Russian-built modules, including one that
has already been launched into orbit for the space station. Neither
module offers enough protection from space debris, neither can
operate after loss of cabin pressure and both have excessive noise
levels, Allen Li, a GAO official, told a House subcommittee on
March 16.
</P>
<P>
   Concern in Congress over whether the Russian space agency was
helping Iran develop long-range missiles prompted both houses to
pass resolutions threatening to cut off Russian space subsidies
unless the president can certify that no missile information was
passed along.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is not the policy of an ally, but that's not what we are,''
said Goure of CSIS. ``The notion of a strategic partnership which
the Clinton administration touted five years ago is gone.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is going to be a difficult relationship. There's no doubt
about that.''

<P>
   MOSCOW _ When Russians vote Sunday to chose their second
democratically elected president, the probable winner will be
Vladimir Putin, a man U.S. officials expect to strengthen ties with
Washington on national security issues like arms control, weapons
proliferation and terrorism.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. relationship with the world's second-largest nuclear
power deteriorated drastically in the last two years, punctuated by
a high-pressure stand-off in Kosovo and anti-Western rhetoric by
the increasingly erratic former president, Boris Yeltsin, and
Russian generals.
</P>
<P>
   The slump was an embarrassment to the Clinton administration,
which counts U.S.-Russian relations as a cornerstone of its foreign
policy. Washington had sunk billions of dollars into the
post-communist economy, hoping to speed along democracy by
fostering capitalism. After years of money squandered on both
sides, the White House had little to show for the expenditure in
1999, both in terms of domestic Russian growth and international
cooperation.
</P>
<P>
   So it was with great relief for U.S. officials to hear Putin in
the months leading up to Sunday's(CQ) Russian presidential vote
make several overtures to Washington, including a surprising
statement in February that Moscow might consider joining NATO.
</P>
<P>
   This turnabout has triggered warm words from the White House
about Putin, despite alleged human rights abuses in Chechnya and
the mixed signals the Russian has given about how he'll treat
fledgling democratic institutions, like a free press.
</P>
<P>
   ``What we see in Putin is a man who wants to leave the past in
the past and move ahead,'' said a senior U.S. official, speaking on
condition of anonymity, during a recent trip to Moscow. ``We see
the same way on many issues.''
</P>
<P>
   Putin's major thoughts on foreign policy are summed up in
Russia's new national security doctrine, a document drafted last
summer while Putin was head of Russia's National Security Council,
refined after he became prime minister in August and then made
public after he became acting president on Dec. 31.
</P>
<P>
   Much has been made of the change of language in regards to use
of nuclear weapons, that it reflects a shift of strategic thinking
on the part of the Russians. However, the references to nuclear
weapons occupy only a small part of the document.
</P>
<P>
   Moscow-based defense analysts say the real development of the
doctrine is the weight given to internal threats _regional and
economic instability, and a ``critically'' ill-equipped army _ as
opposed to external threats, as the greater national security risk.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts also point to the fact that the Russian security
document for the first time omits a section outlining which
countries fall within Russia's sphere of influence, and gives up
historic rights to military bases outside of Russia's territory.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a great shift of thinking. It shows we are not concerned
with expansion any longer,'' said Alexander Zhilin, an ex-army
pilot who now works as a military affairs journalist with the
Moscow News newspaper.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the document does include harsh words about what Moscow
views as the development of a U.S.-dominated international system
of conflict resolution. The decision for NATO forces last year to
bomb Yugoslavia without U.N. approval is a symptom of this, Russian
officials say.
</P>
<P>
   Senior Clinton administration officials say they have been
pleased with the tone set by Putin's seven-month-old government
concerning bilateral relations and security issues, especially the
revival of ties between Russia and NATO in March.
</P>
<P>
   Russia and NATO began cooperating after signing a May 1997
accord aimed at easing Russian fears about the alliance's eastward
expansion to Poland, Hungary and the Czech Republic, but relations
broke down in spring 1999 with the start of the 78-day Kosovo
bombing campaign.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. military officials insist that day-to-day working
relationships are more important than seeing eye-to-eye on every
international issue.
</P>
<P>
   ``Even the closest friends can't always get along. What's more
important is consistency. We don't want another Pristina airport,''
said one U.S. diplomat, referring to the flare-up in tension after
a small group of Russian peacekeepers occupied the airport in
Kosovo's provincial capital in defiance of NATO orders.
</P>
<P>
   Putin's step towards the West came none-too-soon for the Clinton
administration and the budding presidential campaign of Vice
President Al Gore. White House officials say that renewal of ties
will go far in helping Gore against Republican presidential
candidate George W. Bush when it comes to foreign policy issues.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, the first steps Putin will take toward enhancing
bilateral ties will come immediately after the Russian presidential
elections, when the Russian Duma is expected to vote to ratify the
START II arms control treaty, according to the deputy chairman of
the Duma Defense Committee, Georgy Arbatov.
</P>
<P>
   START II, signed in 1993 and approved by the U.S. Senate in
1996, lowers U.S. and Russian nuclear stockpiles to about 3,000
warheads each. After almost seven years of parliamentary bickering,
the Duma has consistently refused to vote on the issue. After
December elections, Putin now controls the largest Duma faction.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have the votes to finally push it through the Duma, thanks
to Putin's faction,'' Arbatov said in an interview this week after
heading closed-door meetings between parliamentary, Russian
Ministry of Defense and Foreign Ministry leaders.
</P>
<P>
   Both Russian ministries want to ratify the treaty, knowing their
cash-strapped country can ill-afford the upkeep on or security over
a massive stockpile of weapons. With internal terrorist threats now
a reality, as witnessed by the Chechen war, nuclear management has
become a priority for Putin, according to his advisers.
</P>
<P>
   Even with this hurdle out of the way, another divisive issue
lurks in the near future, namely President Clinton's decision this
summer about whether to commit the tens of billions of dollars to
developing a national missile defense system, a tool designed to
protect America from nuclear attacks from rogue states.
</P>
<P>
   The problem, besides the unanswered question of whether the
technology for such a defense is effective, is that the 1972
Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty, the cornerstone of arms control
agreements between Moscow and Washington, prohibits such a system.
Russia violently opposes it, saying it would disrupt parity between
the two countries and spark another arms race.
</P>
<P>
   Putin as prime minister made no hints Russia was willing to back
down from this position.
</P>
<P>
   Despite months of shuttle diplomacy by high-ranking U.S.
officials like Secretary of State Madeleine Albright, Russia's
position remains staunch: that any amendment to the ABM would
signal the collapse of all weapons agreements.
</P>
<P>
   Arbatov said the START II ratification would likely include a
stipulation saying Russia would drop out of the treaty if the U.S.
violates the ABM pact.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the overall upturn in bilateral relations, however, some
Russians fret over the support the United States has already
extended to Putin.
</P>
<P>
   They fear that the Clinton administration desire to sign arms
control agreements aimed at bolstering Vice President Al Gore's
chance at the White House this year will outweigh criticism in
human rights arenas.

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ In the years after the Soviet Union's
disintegration, the United States has sent Russia more than $7
billion to safeguard its nuclear arsenal, feed its people, prop up
its space program and nourish the seedlings of a private enterprise
economy.
</P>
<P>
   The results have been, by almost all accounts, less than
stellar.
</P>
<P>
   Russia's economy has taken a nose-dive. Its space program fell
behind in building its components for the International Space
Station, creating delays for the project and cost overruns for U.S.
taxpayers.
</P>
<P>
   And despite a six-year effort and a half-billion dollars in U.S.
assistance, only a small amount of Russia's nuclear materials are
now stored in secure buildings.
</P>
<P>
   Even so, there are few signs that America is about to cut off
the aid spigot, now that acting President Vladimir Putin, the
former KGB officer, moves toward becoming Russia's second
democratically elected president.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've already tolerated all kinds of shenanigans in Russia for
a very long time,'' said Dan Goure, a deputy director at the
Washington research group, Center for Strategic and International
Studies.
</P>
<P>
   ``Putin would have to go almost out of his way to do something
so outrageous, so anti-American that it would cause either (the
United States or Russia) to ratchet back their relationship.''
</P>
<P>
   Goure and others readily concede that direct American aid, plus
$22.6 billion in loans from the International Monetary Fund and $11
billion from the World Bank have not accomplished a great deal
toward solving Russia's problems.
</P>
<P>
   Yet he held that it is hard to see how any U.S. administration
would suspend aid to a country with the world's largest land mass
and a second largest stockpile of nuclear weaponry. ``If anything
goes wrong, the blame falls on the administration,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, one outspoken critic of aid to Russia predicted that
Putin may prove more successful in dealing with the United States
than his ailing predecessor Boris Yeltsin, whose U.S. relations
went from sweet to sour during his often-rocky tenure.
</P>
<P>
   ``Putin is smarter, shrewder and more calculating,'' said David
Kramer, senior fellow at the Project for the New American Century,
a small conservative research group based in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   ``Direct bilateral aid, in financial terms, is not very
significant for propping up Putin,'' Kramer said. But, he added
that it has symbolic power: ``It sends a political message: if
there is no change in (aid) policy, then it suggests that we are
continuing business as usual.''
</P>
<P>
   Putin's strategy has been to talk tough and crack down on
Chechen rebels at home as he proposes more accommodation on nuclear
issues abroad. He has endorsed ratification for the long-delayed
START II missile treaty, and said he might be open to changing the
Anti-Ballistic Missile treaty to permit a U.S. missile defense
system.
</P>
<P>
   The new Russian leader also restored NATO ties which had been
frayed during the U.S.-led bombing of Yugoslavia last year.
</P>
<P>
   Such talk could avert attention from Russian problems, ranging
from widespread corruption to the glacial pace of reforms and
disarmament.
</P>
<P>
   But evidence of friction in U.S.-Russian joint efforts
continues. Among recent examples, the U.S. General Accounting
Office warned earlier this month that Russia and the rest of the
old Soviet Union still have 650 metric tons of enriched uranium and
plutonium. That's enough to make about 40,000 nuclear bombs.
</P>
<P>
   Most of those nuclear materials remain in unsecured buildings
and under increasing threat of theft, said the GAO, which is the
investigative arm of Congress.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, after spending $481 million over six years, the United
States completed installation of security systems for just 7
percent of that material, the accounting office reported.
</P>
<P>
   The slow pace was traced largely to resistance from the Russian
government, which has locked U.S. officials out of the nuclear
weapons complex where much of the material is stored. Moreover, the
Russian government has soaked up some of the U.S. aid by taxing it.
</P>
<P>
   American costs for safeguarding and dismantling the nuclear
arsenal have reached $5 billion with no clear end in sight.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everyone recognizes that these are large amounts of money,''
said Jon B. Wolfsthal, an associate with the Carnegie Endowment for
Peace and a former special assistant and policy adviser for the
U.S. Department of Energy, which runs much of nuclear safeguard
efforts in Russia.
</P>
<P>
   ``At the same time, there's no way to overstate the threat that
the United States now faces from the former of Soviet Union,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   He cited the nuclear material watched over by guards who had no
coats or boots in the winter and no pay in summer, and nuclear
weapons labs where Russian scientists, unpaid for months at a time,
could sell their expertise to Iran, Iraq or China.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. subsidies have not been completely successful, he
acknowledged, but he added, ``Half a loaf is better than no loaf.''
</P>
<P>
   Problems have also haunted the U.S.-Russian space projects.
</P>
<P>
   Russia's failure to complete its space station components on
time have been estimated by the House Science Committee to have
cost billions of dollars in extra expenses to NASA.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, congressional investigators are currently looking into
safety problems with two Russian-built modules, including one that
has already been launched into orbit for the space station. Neither
module offers enough protection from space debris, neither can
operate after loss of cabin pressure and both have excessive noise
levels, Allen Li, a GAO official, told a House subcommittee on
March 16.
</P>
<P>
   Concern in Congress over whether the Russian space agency was
helping Iran develop long-range missiles prompted both houses to
pass resolutions threatening to cut off Russian space subsidies
unless the president can certify that no missile information was
passed along.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is not the policy of an ally, but that's not what we are,''
said Goure of CSIS. ``The notion of a strategic partnership which
the Clinton administration touted five years ago is gone.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is going to be a difficult relationship. There's no doubt
about that.''

<P>
   MOSCOW _ When Russians vote Sunday to chose their second
democratically elected president, the probable winner will be
Vladimir Putin, a man U.S. officials expect to strengthen ties with
Washington on national security issues like arms control, weapons
proliferation and terrorism.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. relationship with the world's second-largest nuclear
power deteriorated drastically in the last two years, punctuated by
a high-pressure stand-off in Kosovo and anti-Western rhetoric by
the increasingly erratic former president, Boris Yeltsin, and
Russian generals.
</P>
<P>
   The slump was an embarrassment to the Clinton administration,
which counts U.S.-Russian relations as a cornerstone of its foreign
policy. Washington had sunk billions of dollars into the
post-communist economy, hoping to speed along democracy by
fostering capitalism. After years of money squandered on both
sides, the White House had little to show for the expenditure in
1999, both in terms of domestic Russian growth and international
cooperation.
</P>
<P>
   So it was with great relief for U.S. officials to hear Putin in
the months leading up to Sunday's(CQ) Russian presidential vote
make several overtures to Washington, including a surprising
statement in February that Moscow might consider joining NATO.
</P>
<P>
   This turnabout has triggered warm words from the White House
about Putin, despite alleged human rights abuses in Chechnya and
the mixed signals the Russian has given about how he'll treat
fledgling democratic institutions, like a free press.
</P>
<P>
   ``What we see in Putin is a man who wants to leave the past in
the past and move ahead,'' said a senior U.S. official, speaking on
condition of anonymity, during a recent trip to Moscow. ``We see
the same way on many issues.''
</P>
<P>
   Putin's major thoughts on foreign policy are summed up in
Russia's new national security doctrine, a document drafted last
summer while Putin was head of Russia's National Security Council,
refined after he became prime minister in August and then made
public after he became acting president on Dec. 31.
</P>
<P>
   Much has been made of the change of language in regards to use
of nuclear weapons, that it reflects a shift of strategic thinking
on the part of the Russians. However, the references to nuclear
weapons occupy only a small part of the document.
</P>
<P>
   Moscow-based defense analysts say the real development of the
doctrine is the weight given to internal threats _regional and
economic instability, and a ``critically'' ill-equipped army _ as
opposed to external threats, as the greater national security risk.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts also point to the fact that the Russian security
document for the first time omits a section outlining which
countries fall within Russia's sphere of influence, and gives up
historic rights to military bases outside of Russia's territory.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a great shift of thinking. It shows we are not concerned
with expansion any longer,'' said Alexander Zhilin, an ex-army
pilot who now works as a military affairs journalist with the
Moscow News newspaper.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the document does include harsh words about what Moscow
views as the development of a U.S.-dominated international system
of conflict resolution. The decision for NATO forces last year to
bomb Yugoslavia without U.N. approval is a symptom of this, Russian
officials say.
</P>
<P>
   Senior Clinton administration officials say they have been
pleased with the tone set by Putin's seven-month-old government
concerning bilateral relations and security issues, especially the
revival of ties between Russia and NATO in March.
</P>
<P>
   Russia and NATO began cooperating after signing a May 1997
accord aimed at easing Russian fears about the alliance's eastward
expansion to Poland, Hungary and the Czech Republic, but relations
broke down in spring 1999 with the start of the 78-day Kosovo
bombing campaign.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. military officials insist that day-to-day working
relationships are more important than seeing eye-to-eye on every
international issue.
</P>
<P>
   ``Even the closest friends can't always get along. What's more
important is consistency. We don't want another Pristina airport,''
said one U.S. diplomat, referring to the flare-up in tension after
a small group of Russian peacekeepers occupied the airport in
Kosovo's provincial capital in defiance of NATO orders.
</P>
<P>
   Putin's step towards the West came none-too-soon for the Clinton
administration and the budding presidential campaign of Vice
President Al Gore. White House officials say that renewal of ties
will go far in helping Gore against Republican presidential
candidate George W. Bush when it comes to foreign policy issues.

   LAGUNA SAN IGNACIO, MEXICO _ No place on earth exists like this
distant lagoon in the middle of Mexico's Baja California coast.
</P>
<P>
   Waves gently lap onto deserted shell-strewn beaches and stars
shine by the millions. And one of the sea's most enigmatic
behemoths, the gray whale, is willing to swim up to human beings
and allow a species that has killed them to caress their
barnacle-encrusted backs.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sometimes when you scratch them they open their mouths. I even
touched a tongue once,'' laughed whale-watch guide Romualdo
Fischer, one of the local fishermen who used to fear and avoid the
whales until the late 1960s.
</P>
<P>
   Environmentalists say they hope this magical relationship
between human and marine mammal will be preserved forever thanks to
a March 2 decision by Mexican President Ernesto Zedillo to scrap a
plan to build a salt-mining operation here in partnership with
Japan's Mitsubishi Corp.
</P>
<P>
   An isolated inlet 600 miles south of San Diego and three hours
from the nearest paved road, the San Ignacio Lagoon is the last
gray whale breeding habitat on Baja's coast that is untouched by
commercial development. Every winter, the whales, which were an
endangered species until five years ago, swim into the lagoon after
a 6,000-mile migration from the Arctic Circle.
</P>
<P>
   Here they mate or give birth and train their young for the
rigors of life. Once hunted to the brink of extinction by Americans
who called them ``devil fish,'' the whales _ which can weigh up to
30 tons _ are now beloved by tourists who delight in the hiss and
spray of their powerful spouts. Hands reach out to pet the whales
as they cavort next to boats, curious to investigate the human
cargo.
</P>
<P>
   In 1988, Mexico's president declared the San Ignacio Lagoon and
a vast 6.2 million-acre desert around it the Vizcaino Biosphere
Reserve, the largest such protected area in Latin America.
Zedillo's decision to call off the salt mine _ which would have
sucked water out of the lagoon and created miles of salt flats _
came after a five-year battle by Mexican and American
environmentalists that many consider the most significant victory
of their generation.
</P>
<P>
   The environmentalists forged a sophisticated model for action
they say could be replicated around the world to win similar fights
to save habitat.
</P>
<P>
   They filed a barrage of lawsuits in Mexican courts, and enlisted
the help of sympathetic scientists and celebrities like James Bond
movie star Pierce Brosnan.
</P>
<P>
   They used the Internet to link supporters in the Americas, Asia
and Europe, and convinced 43 California cities to adopt resolutions
against the plant and 15 U.S.-based mutual funds to pledge not to
invest in Mitsubishi. They started a consumer boycott of Mitsubishi
dealerships as well as other products, in California and bombarded
the company with more than 1 million protest postcards.
</P>
<P>
   In short, they embarrassed the Mexican government and
Mitsubishi.
</P>
<P>
   ``We ran this campaign like a modern political campaign, but
always with advice from the Mexicans,'' said Fred O'Regan,
president of the Massachusetts-based International Fund for Animal
Welfare.
</P>
<P>
   More than 50 Mexican environmental groups joined the coalition
to stop the salt mine, and emerged from the experience stronger
than ever. The rule of law, always vulnerable in Mexico, received a
tremendous boost, said Alberto Szekely, the coalition's Mexican
lawyer.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a victory for all because we were able to make our
laws prevail,'' Szekely said. ``If the development had been
allowed, protections for all of Mexico's other reserves would have
crumbled.''
</P>
<P>
   Szekely filed repeated lawsuits in Mexico arguing that the
proposed salt mine violated this country's environmental laws and
the rights of fishermen living near the lagoon in a community
called Punta Abreojos. He had already won the suit on behalf of
fishermen in one hearing last October, and he expected his case to
be upheld if the fight had continued.
</P>
<P>
   Szekely also successfully sued Mexican environmental
authorities, forcing them to sanction the government and Mitsubishi
for infractions committed at an existing salt mine about 100 miles
to the north on the edge of another inlet, Scammon's Lagoon.
</P>
<P>
   That salt operation was found guilty of dumping batteries and
industrial discharge into a lagoon where whales also congregate.
Allegations of whether wildlife was harmed by these infractions
remain disputed.
</P>
<P>
   Mexican writer and environmentalist Homero Aridjis was the first
person to signal the alarm over the second proposed salt factory.
Trying to protect animal habitat in Mexico, he said, is often a
frustrating exercise because laws are so frequently ignored.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think this time President Zedillo saw this had spilled out
beyond borders and that it might damage him politically,'' Aridjis
said with satisfaction.
</P>
<P>
   In the wake of this historic victory, however, environmentalists
now face the challenge of addressing the concerns of several
thousand fishermen in this isolated area who would like more stable
jobs and better education, health care and infrastructure here.
</P>
<P>
   Otherwise, environmentalists acknowledged, they now run the risk
of being seen as rich interlopers with little credibility.
</P>
<P>
   ``The environmental community needs to demonstrate that it's not
just going to walk away from these people,'' said Robert F. Kennedy
Jr., a leading critic of the salt mine who flew to the lagoon this
month with other activists to celebrate Zedillo's decision.
</P>
<P>
   Kennedy is a lawyer for the Natural Resources Defense Council,
an American environmental group.
</P>
<P>
   On the east side of the lagoon, residents must truck in their
drinking water from the nearest desert oasis, which is several
hours away. There is no high school, and only parents that can
afford room and board send their children away to study. Doctors
only visit the area every few weeks. And there is no power source
except for a few solar panels.
</P>
<P>
   Many of the fishermen already are developing campsites and whale
watching for tourists here. But that activity only lasts for
several months out of the year. Most have to seek work elsewhere or
return to fishing full-time to make a living. Some initially
supported the salt mine, which would have provided construction
employment, 200 permanent jobs and cash for the area.
</P>
<P>
   Jorge Peon, a fisherman who also owns a landing strip near the
lagoon, said most local residents turned against the project
because they feared it would spoil their fishing and nascent
whale-watching operations.
</P>
<P>
   But Peon offered a cautionary tale, explaining that people might
still be tempted to mismanage the lagoon if they face economic
hardship.
</P>
<P>
   Some years back, Peon said, fishermen in his cooperative had
such a dismal year they gave themselves permission to illegally
slaughter endangered sea turtles here.
</P>
<P>
   ``We ate them and sold them,'' Peon said. ``I know if people in
the United States read this it will drop like a bomb . . . But
families were desperate.''
</P>
<P>
   To show they mean business with the fishermen, Mexican
environmentalists brought community development experts with them
on the victory tour.
</P>
<P>
   ``The next battle is to bring these people what they need and
what they deserve,'' said Melba Pria, director-general for Mexico's
National Institute for Indigenous Affairs. Experienced in
developing jobs in areas that are culturally and environmentally
sensitive, Pria personally opposed the salt factory.
</P>
<P>
   The village of Punta Abreojos, which sits on the ocean near the
mouth of the lagoon, could provide a model for well-managed fishing
in the area.
</P>
<P>
   The village of 1,000 inhabitants has run a fishing cooperative
since the 1930s that exports abalone, lobster and other seafood to
Asia and the United States.
</P>
<P>
   The cooperative is so prosperous, said Ana Maria Sandoval, that
she and her eight siblings were all able to attend schools of
higher education and become professionals.
</P>
<P>
   Punta Abreojos was almost solidly against the salt mine, which
would have placed an enormous ocean pier in the middle of sensitive
lobster habitat the community depends on.
</P>
<P>
   The town threw a feast and celebration for environmentalists
after Zedillo announced the salt mine's demise. Children sang songs
_ ``Pollution! No! No! No!'' _ and oysters and lobsters sizzled on
a beachside grill.
</P>
<P>
   ``The salt company tried to convince us by saying they would
pave our streets. They would bring us a big highway. said Brenda
Gayita, a university student home for a visit. ``But in exchange
for what?''
</P>
<P>
   (EDs: Story can end here. Optional add follows.)
</P>
<P>
   While the environmentalists assembled scientists who argued that
the salt plant would disturb the lagoon's sensitive ecosystem _ and
the whales _ Mitsubishi fought back with its own team of experts,
who contended that whales had co-existed well with the salt
operation on Scammon's Lagoon.
</P>
<P>
   Stephen Wechselblatt, a vice president of public relations at
Mitsubishi International in New York, said the environmentalists
ultimately won by portraying themselves as ``David against
Goliath.''
</P>
<P>
   In the end, President Zedillo saved face for the government and
Mitsubishi by declaring that the salt-mining operation probably was
compatible with the lagoon, but would certainly disturb the
landscape.
</P>
<P>
   Zedillo, some environmentalists suggested, may have also been
reluctant to allow a allow a controversial development in an area
that was designated a United Nation's World Heritage Site in 1993.
</P>
<P>
   Andres Rosental, Mexico's former ambassador to the United
Nations, also suggested that Mexican authorities are more attuned
to the demands of environmentalists now.
</P>
<P>
   Rosental _ who knows Zedillo _ was a powerful lobbyist against
the salt mine, enlisting the help of Mexican entrepreneurs who
donated space to put up billboards in Mexico City denouncing the
project.
</P>
<P>
   ``Up until now,'' Rosental said, ``Mexico has had a reputation
for being easier to do business in than the United States or Canada
when it comes to environmental laws. But this now shows that the
government can't just plow ahead as it has done in the past.''

&HT;     OUTDOOR ADVENTURE? TRY DISNEYLAND 
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Yosemite, Tahoe, Shasta and the Golden Gate may
be the top outdoor destinations in California, but not a one is the
state's most popular getaway. You know what is? That is, the No. 1
getaway for people not only from California, but also from
throughout the world?
</P>
<P>
   It's Disneyland, along with Universal Studios and Knott's Berry
Farm. That's right, the L.A. movie with a cast of thousands, make
that millions, 75-degree weather and where every visitor going
through the gate of the Magic Kingdom has stars in his or her eyes.
</P>
<P>
   Especially kids, whose biggest fantasies come to life as you
watch.
</P>
<P>
   For a guy more accustomed to an ascent up the back side of Mount
Whitney than a frontal assault on Splash Mountain, I probably
looked like a man from Mars wandering around amid the crowds. After
all, I still thought they still sold ``E'' tickets for the best
rides at Disneyland. But my two kids, Jeremy, 12, and Kris, 8, were
more than willing to lead the way, acting as guides for my wife,
Stephani, and me.
</P>
<P>
   Yes, this is a paradise for kids, and it doesn't take long for
them to become experts. The first stop always is Disneyland, coming
after the flight south, the terrorizing drive (via rental car or
shuttle bus) on the highways to Anaheim, and getting set in a
hotel. . The first thing you notice is that spring has arrived,
temperatures are in the mid-70s daily, the happy crowds are up
early, walking to the entrance gates for the 7:30 a.m. opening (for
those paying an extra fee, and we'll get to that), talking in every
language imaginable, pointing at Matterhorn Mountain looming over
the park.
</P>
<P>
   This is the true United Nations. While walking to the entrance,
we heard people talking in Spanish, Japanese, Chinese, Indian,
German, French, Russian, even English. Everybody has the same silly
grins, myself included, something like Clark Griswold and family,
regardless of the culture. Disneyland is like religion: many paths,
one truth.
</P>
<P>
   It doesn't take long to figure out the magic of the appeal. The
best rides combine amusement-park thrills with Disney-type
production. The best, according to the experts _ kids _ are Splash
Mountain, Space Mountain and Indiana Jones.
</P>
<P>
   The most famous moment, of course, is the head-long plunge at
Splash Mountain, where you sit in a boat-like ``log.'' First you
float along this ``river,'' with turns, rises and falls, in and out
of the mountain, then suddenly plunge in a heart-pounding surge,
what seems straight down into this pool, similar to a Class V rapid
at Hells Corner on the Klamath River. At the height of terror, a
remote camera snaps your picture _ they sell thousands of these
shots. If you've made the trip, you probably have one yourself.
</P>
<P>
   Close inspection of these photographs reveals the adults in
utter terror, yet youngsters with happy, excited grins. That should
tell you everything you need to know about the trip down here.
</P>
<P>
   You can have a similar encounter at Space Mountain, where you
climb into this spaceship-like car, then careen through space at
warp speeds, with unexpected drops, turns and rises. Let me tell
you, I have a pilot's license, am certified to fly high-power
aircraft, and have been charged by grizzly bears and swum Class V
rapids _ and nothing has ever scared me as much as this ride. This
was pointed out to me by my kids, who spent much of the week making
fun of me _ the ultimate bond between males _ simulating my howls,
screams and shouts of absolute horror, fright and panic.
</P>
<P>
   They said the ride was ``fun,'' of course, ``almost as good as
Jurassic Park.''
</P>
<P>
   The Jurassic Park ride is not at Disneyland, but at Universal
Studios near downtown Los Angeles. Universal is part of the must-do
tour for every visitor to the region, and, unlike Disneyland, the
lines are far shorter and the waits minimal _ 5 to 10 minutes
instead of the 20 minutes to an hour that has become par for the
course at Disneyland. There is hope that the $2.1 billion expansion
of Disneyland, due to be completed early next year, will solve the
long lines and waits.
</P>
<P>
   Jurassic Park features sitting in a boat-like raft, then barely
eluding being eaten by a T-Rex followed by a drop-dead, horrifying
fall into water where everybody gets soaked. Because the lines were
so short, unlike Disneyland, some kids will repeat rides over and
over; they never blow a circuit on overload.
</P>
<P>
   What makes this park work is that you get to live through cinema
special effects in all kinds of scenarios, from time travel (``Back
to the Future''), riding a bike over L.A. (``E.T.''), an earthquake
(tram tour) and barely eluding being eaten by Jaws (tram tour),
among others, yet with no long delays. The tram tour through the
studio lots is like a trip into the past, the sites of creation of
thousands of movies.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, to complete the L.A. circuit, the other must-go is
Knott's Berry Farm. This is more like the ultimate amusement park,
featuring Ghost Rider, the highest roller coaster in the world, and
Log Ride, a kids' favorite for its simple thrills.
</P>
<P>
   But if you want overall shock, wait until you get the bill. The
entry price for adults at Disneyland is $76 for a three-day ticket,
plus an $8 surcharge for early gate privileges (7:30 a.m. instead
of 9 a.m., absolutely a must), with some hotels adding a $5
``surcharge'' for selling you the ticket, which is just a skim job.
Three-day tickets for kids 3 to 11 are $57, not including
surcharges. Universal charges $42 a day for adults, and Knott's
Berry Farm a little less than that.
</P>
<P>
   Hotels are booked near 100 percent nearly every day of the year
and commonly charge $100 and up per day for rooms with multiple
beds. Car rentals are the biggest gouge, $250 to $300 for a week.
The only flexibility is with airline tickets, with Southwest
offering fares as low as $56 (well in advance, a limited promotion)
to as high as $91 per seat. The cost of meals in the parks is
simply an outrage, often $25 to $40 for a family ordering
greaseburgers, fries and cokes.
</P>
<P>
   You don't need a calculator for a brain to figure out that this
can turn into one pricey getaway.
</P>
<P>
   But do you know what? This is one of the few times when price
makes no difference. They could charge anything they want and
people would pay it. After all, there are no price tags on the
biggest smiles you've ever seen.

   WASHINGTON _ Saying incidents of gay harassment are ``more
widespread than I anticipated,'' Defense Secretary William Cohen
said Friday he will appoint a special gays-in-the-military
oversight council to combat the problem.
</P>
<P>
   Cohen made the announcement in a breakfast meeting with
reporters and said the Pentagon will release a report in the
afternoon detailing a recent investigation that found a significant
amount of verbal abuse of suspected homosexual troops in the ranks.
</P>
<P>
   The council, said Cohen, will try to change the hostile
atmosphere that gay and lesbian troops often encounter, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The incidents and use of abusive language (against suspected
gay and lesbian troops) are more widespread than I anticipated,''
Cohen said. ``I was surprised at the numbers of people who said
they saw some evidence of harassment.''
</P>
<P>
   Michelle Benecke, co-executive director of the Servicemembers
Legal Defense Network, an organization that provides legal aid to
homosexual military personnel, said the findings confirm what the
group has said for years.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have told the Pentagon for six years that harassment and
abuse are a serious problem. I'm glad the Pentagon has finally
acknowledged it. But the key to stopping harassment is leadership
and accountability. We hope this oversight committee is not a
substitute.''
</P>
<P>
   Cohen said a major responsibility for the oversight council will
be to ensure that all military personnel are versed in new Pentagon
anti-harassment guidelines issued last month. The guidelines are
aimed at making sure the controversial ``don't ask, don't tell,
don't pursue'' policy on gays in the military is followed. The
policy allows homosexuals to serve as long as they keep quiet about
their sexual orientation and don't engage in homosexual acts.
</P>
<P>
   The policy also is designed to ensure that troops who are
harassed can complain to their commanders without fear of setting
in motion an investigation into their sexuality. Gay rights leaders
have said that when troops report acts of alleged harassment, they
often are drummed out of the service.
</P>
<P>
   The Pentagon Inspector General's Office survey of personnel at
38 major military bases found that many troops simply were
unfamiliar with the policy.
</P>
<P>
   Cohen said the survey findings underscore that ``we have a big
job to do in terms of really getting the instruction and training
out there and holding commanders accountable'' for preventing
harassment. He added, ``We still have a ways to go.''
</P>
<P>
   But Cohen said he was encouraged by one finding in the survey of
some 70,000 service members _ that many respondents said they felt
they could report harassment incidents without fear of reprisal.
</P>
<P>
   Cohen ordered the survey of the bases in the wake of the murder
last July of an Army recruit at Ft. Campbell, Ky., who was
suspected of being gay. The killing rekindled the debate over the
Clinton administration's seven-year-old policy on gays in the
military.
</P>
<P>
   The policy prohibits commanders from asking military personnel
about their sexual orientation, but gay rights organizations
contend that the policy is routinely violated and they cite the Ft.
Campbell incident as an example.
</P>
<P>
   In December, Army Pvt. Calvin Glover, 19, was sentenced to life
in prison for murdering the recruit, Pvt. Barry Winchell, 21, with
a baseball bat. During Glover's trial, soldiers testified that
Winchell was regularly taunted with anti-gay slurs and that
superiors did not intervene when he complained.

THOUSANDS OF PILGRIMS ATTEND POPE'S SEA OF GALILEE MASS

   MOUNT OF THE BEATITUDES, Israel _ Standing where Jesus Christ
was said to have delivered the Sermon on the Mount _ telling his
disciples, ``Blessed are the meek, for they shall inherit the
earth'' _ Pope John Paul II on Friday warned a youthful multitude
against heeding the secular anti-Beatitudes lurking in the modern
Holy Land.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is the voice which says, `Blessed are the proud and
violent, those who prosper at any cost, who are unscrupulous,
pitiless, devious, who make war, not peace, and persecute those who
stand in their way,''' the pope said, speaking to thousands of
pilgrims from a platform overlooking the shimmering Sea of Galilee.
``And this voice seems to make sense in a world where the violent
are often triumphant and the devious seem to succeed.''
</P>
<P>
   Ever since Jesus called his first disciples together ``not far
from this very place,'' the pope said, ``his call has always
demanded a choice between the two voices competing for your
hearts.'' The pope described this as ``the choice between good and
evil, between life and death,'' and asked which voice the young
people would obey.
</P>
<P>
   But the pope asserted that Jesus' Beatitudes, recorded in the
Gospel of Matthew, continue to challenge Christians nearly 2,000
years later.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is strange that Jesus exalts those whom the world generally
regards as weak,'' the pope said. ``He says to them, `Blessed are
you who seem to be losers, because you are the true winners. The
kingdom of heaven is yours.'''
</P>
<P>
   The pope, who is making a weeklong spiritual pilgrimage to the
Holy Land, celebrated Mass outdoors before an estimated 150,000
pilgrims who had gathered, starting as early as 3 a.m., on grassy
slopes left muddy from an early morning rain.
</P>
<P>
   Blue-and-white Israeli flags fluttered near the Vatican's
yellow-and-white banners. In the crowd were also
red-white-and-black Palestinian flags and a banner that read, ``The
uprooted people of Kfar Bire'm welcome John Paul II.'' The banner
mentioning Kfar Bire'm, a village occupied by Israel in 1948, came
down halfway through the Mass, which started at about 11 a.m. and
was held under tight security.
</P>
<P>
   A semicircular black tent was pitched over the pope's altar and
platform, and he was shielded by bulletproof glass on both sides.
</P>
<P>
   The pilgrims seemed to have traveled from everywhere. They
included not only Palestinians from Israel and the West Bank but
also Lebanese Christians, who were allowed to cross the tense
border from southern Lebanon, and a scattering of U.N. peacekeepers
recognizable by their blue berets. The pope's visit has been
enormously important to Christians who constitute a tiny minority
in Israel and had never been to an outdoor Mass like this.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Nazrin Touba, 33, who works in an orphanage in Nazareth, arrived
in a bus with other Arab Christians at 3 a.m. Touba, who was pushed
up against a fence by the exuberant crowd, explained why she and
her friends had come to the Sea of Galilee, when the pope is
scheduled to come to Nazareth Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're afraid we might not be able to see him in Nazareth,''
she said. ``The security may be so strict that we won't be able to
go at all.''
</P>
<P>
   Other pilgrims came from as far afield as Romania, Guam, the
Philippines, Italy and the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Marina Danese, 33, an Italian homemaker from Milan, said she had
left her family behind in Milan, Italy. ``I could see the pope
anytime I want in Italy,'' Danese said, ``but I could never again
see him in the place where Jesus lived.''
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Though the Vatican has described the pope's visit to the Holy
Land as foremost a spiritual journey, he has been confronted by the
competing politics and tensions of the Middle East almost since his
arrival. Israeli officials have used the papal visit to assert
their claim to Jerusalem as a Jewish city according to the Bible.
And two days ago, Palestinian leader Yasir Arafat, as he greeted
the pope in Bethlehem, called Jerusalem the Palestinian capital.
</P>
<P>
   The pope's spokesman, Joaquin Navarro-Valls, said that if such
problems are real, he could hardly avoid them. ``It would be a
fiction to walk on the clouds and not on the earth,'' Navarro-Valls
said.

&HT;     HEARST CORP. DETAILS EFFORTS TO SELL EXAMINER 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By SETH ROSENFELD  
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ The Hearst Corp. has told a federal judge that
its plan to give the Fang family a $25 million annual subsidy to
publish The San Francisco Examiner would create economically
competitive newspapers in San Francisco for the first time in 35
years.
</P>
<P>
   Hearst lawyers made the statement Thursday in a motion asking
U.S. District Judge Vaughn Walker to dismiss former mayoral
candidate Clint Reilly's lawsuit to block Hearst's purchase of the
San Francisco Chronicle.
</P>
<P>
   Reilly contends the purchase would leave San Francisco with only
one daily newspaper and higher advertising and subscription rates.
</P>
<P>
   Reilly contacted Walker's chambers Thursday to request a hearing
Monday seeking a temporary restraining order to bar Hearst's
purchase of the Chronicle pending a previously scheduled hearing on
his lawsuit set for April 13.
</P>
<P>
   Joseph M. Alioto, Reilly's lawyer, has said Reilly is concerned
Hearst's deal with the Fangs will not enable The Examiner to
continue as a viable newspaper.
</P>
<P>
   Hearst contended in court papers that its plan would promote
economic and editorial competition.
</P>
<P>
   ``For the first time in decades, there will be direct economic
competition between two daily newspapers published in the city of
San Francisco,'' said Gary Halling, a Hearst lawyer. ``The
contemplated sales of the Chronicle and Examiner will also promote
the diversity of editorial and reportorial voices that Mr. Reilly
claims to champion.''
</P>
<P>
   The Fangs will preserve The Examiner's editorial voice, said
Halling, while Hearst builds the Chronicle into ``a world class
newspaper better able to compete in the Bay Area with other media
and major local and regional dailies owned by national
enterprises.``
</P>
<P>
   Since 1965, Hearst's afternoon Examiner and the locally owned
morning Chronicle have been in a joint operating agreement, an
exception to federal antitrust laws that allows them to share
business operations while maintaining independent editorial staffs.
</P>
<P>
   Hearst has been trying to complete a deal to buy the Chronicle
for a reported $660 million, which Reilly has opposed in court.
</P>
<P>
   Hearst argued in its papers that Walker should dismiss Reilly's
request for a preliminary injunction blocking its purchase of the
Chronicle, because Reilly is not likely to succeed on the merits of
his lawsuit and because the preliminary injunction would cause
Hearst irreparable harm.
</P>
<P>
   Hearst says it has only a fleeting chance to buy the Chronicle _
which a Hearst executive called a ``one of a kind opportunity in a
highly desirable market by reason of its demographics, affluence,
growth and geographical proximity to the world's technology center,
Silicon Valley.''
</P>
<P>
   Hearst's agreement to buy the Chronicle could be terminated if
it does not close by May 2, the court papers say, although they
note that the deadline may be extended for as much as nine months.
</P>
<P>
   ``Thus, the preliminary injunction Mr. Reilly seeks could
effectively kill the deal,'' Hearst said.
</P>
<P>
   Hearst confirmed in the court papers that it had agreed to give
the Fang family, publishers of the thrice-weekly free Independent,
up to $25 million a year to help cover the cost of publishing The
Examiner as a daily sold by home subscription and news racks.
</P>
<P>
   Hearst did not disclose how much, if anything, the Fangs paid
for The Examiner. In court papers, Hearst characterized an earlier
offer from the Fangs as ``in effect . . . a negative purchase
price.''
</P>
<P>
   the court papers shed light on what Hearst described as its
exhaustive and daunting effort to sell The Examiner.
</P>
<P>
   The New York Times Co. replied, ``definitely not interested . .
. good luck,'' according to the court papers. McClatchy Co.,
publisher of the Sacramento Bee, declined, saying, ``couldn't make
the numbers work.'' Times Mirror, publisher of the Los Angeles
Times, likewise passed, saying, ``can't see how to make money
there.'' Rupert Murdoch, chairman of the News Corp. Ltd., replied,
``too bloody difficult.'' The Unification Church, publisher of the
Washington Times, said, ``too hard to make (it) work,'' the court
papers said.
</P>
<P>
   Hearst initially got only two offers for The Examiner, and both
demanded annual subsidies of up to $35 million and amounted to a
negative purchase price, the court papers say.
</P>
<P>
   The documents show Hearst's efforts to craft a deal that would
satisfy the U.S. Department of Justice, which was investigating
whether Hearst's purchase of the Chronicle would create an illegal
monopoly; local politicians, who had advocated maintaining multiple
editorial voices in San Francisco, and Reilly's lawsuit.
</P>
<P>
   Through its New York City investment banker, Veronis, Suhler &AMP;
Associates Inc., Hearst contacted more than 80 prospective buyers,
the court papers say.
</P>
<P>
   They ranged from Internet giants like America Online and Yahoo,
to media heavies like the Tribune Company, Gannett Co. Inc., A.H.
Belo and CNET Networks Inc., to investment groups like Warren
Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway, Charles Schwab Corp. and the Saudi
Investment Financial Co.
</P>
<P>
   But there was little interest, Hearst said.
</P>
<P>
   Local real estate developers and wealthy individuals who might
have been ``trophy buyers'' also turned down the opportunity,
including Richard C. Blum and Doug Shorenstein.
</P>
<P>
   Unacceptable offers came from New Times Inc., publisher of the
SF Weekly and other weeklies around the country, and the Spanish
Broadcasting System, the papers say.
</P>
<P>
   At first, Hearst offered to sell The Examiner's editorial
assets, including its archives, subscriber and advertiser lists and
options to buy its editorial and news operations and a transitional
production and distribution agreement.
</P>
<P>
   But with no viable takers, and in response to concerns from
third parties not named in the court papers, Hearst expanded the
offer to a ``turn key'' operation, including a printing press on
Army Street, delivery trucks and offices.
</P>
<P>
   In the end, there were potential offers from only four parties:
Pan Asia Venture Capital Corp. of San Francisco, the Fangs'
company; Leucadia National Corp., a New York-based firm involved in
insurance, manufacturing, trading stamps and purchasing properties
at attractive prices; Knight Ridder, owner of the San Jose Mercury
News and Contra Costa Times, and Reilly.
</P>
<P>
   Knight Ridder was interested only if it could get Hearst's 50
percent share of its current joint operating agreement with the
Chronicle, under which the two newspapers split profits, Hearst's
court papers say.
</P>
<P>
   In a statement Thursday, Tony Ridder, chairman and chief
executive officer of Knight Ridder, said, ``We would only have been
interested if we could take the Hearst's position in the JOA, and
even then we don't know if we would have gone ahead with it.``
</P>
<P>
   Reilly's offer was not disclosed in the court filing, because,
Hearst said, it was part of confidential settlement negotiations
over his lawsuit.
</P>
<P>
   Both the Fangs and Leucadia initially demanded annual subsidies
of $25 million to $35 million, the court papers say.
</P>
<P>
   In their final offers, both still ``insisted on receiving annual
support payments from Hearst for at least $25 million over a
multiple year period,'' the papers say. ``Neither party expressed
any interest in purchasing the printing facilities or the other
additional newspaper assets for sale.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Hearst's exhaustive sales efforts demonstrated that no one was
willing to acquire The Examiner unless Hearst also provided tens of
millions of dollars to support The Examiner's operations for a
multiyear period,`` Halling said in court papers.
</P>
<P>
   On March 16, Hearst struck a deal to sell The Examiner to the
Fangs that included only the paper's name, archives, subscriber
list, examiner.com Web site, computers and office furniture,
delivery trucks and news racks. The staff and buildings were not
included.
</P>
<P>
   Hearst will publish The Examiner for four months after the deal
closes, which will be by the end of this month unless Reilly
obtains a court order blocking it.
</P>
<P>
   During the first eight months after the Fangs take over, Hearst
will contribute up to $16 million in publishing expenses. In the
next two years, Hearst will pay up to $25 million per year, the
papers say.
</P>
<P>
   Hearst said the sale arrangement should satisfy the concerns of
Reilly's lawsuit that Hearst's purchase of the Chronicle might mean
closing The Examiner and leaving San Francisco with one daily
newspaper.
</P>
<P>
   The Fangs have said they will publish The Examiner as ``a strong
local competitor,'' the court papers say, while continuing to
publish the Independent as a free paper three times a week. Alioto
told the Associated Press on Thursday that newspaper economics
experts have told him producing a viable daily metropolitan
newspaper competitive in advertising, circulation and news coverage
will cost $80 million to $100 million a year.
</P>
<P>
   Alioto said Reilly would drop his objections ``if the potential
buyer looked as if it were going to be a viable competitive
alternative to the Chronicle . . . but from the information we
have, that is not the case.``
</P>
<P>
   Halling argued in court papers that the continued publication of
The Examiner, along with many other media in the Bay Area, would
provide robust editorial and economic competition.
</P>
<P>
   Among newspapers, The Examiner now has a 7 percent share of the
market; the Chronicle has 27 percent; the Alameda Newspaper Group,
which publishes the Oakland Tribune, the Hayward Daily Review and
San Mateo Times, has 12.8 percent; and Knight Ridder's Mercury
News, Contra Costa Times, West County Times and Valley times
together have 29.5 percent, the court papers say.
</P>
<P>
   Other competition comes from radio, television, weekly papers
and the Internet. ``San Francisco is the most technologically
advanced and 'wired' community in the country,'' Hearst said in the
papers.

SITE BRINGS PARTY TO THE STRIP
</HEADLINE>
  (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By DAVID BLOOM 
c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News 
<TEXT>
<P>
   It should be a heck of a do this weekend, even by the sometimes
grandiose standards of Web start-ups. In this case, the online do
to do is the Hollywood Stock Exchange (at www.hsx.com) Oscar party,
which has also become the official celebration of the event for the
city of West Hollywood (where HSX just moved its headquarters).
</P>
<P>
   HSX has been around a few years now, functioning as a sort of
stock market simulator that tracks the ``value'' of about 1,800
Hollywood celebs and properties. You ``purchase'' shares in the
stars, hoping to realize gains as their value rises with their next
big hit, or in this case, Oscar win.
</P>
<P>
   From a purely sociological standpoint, watching the rise and
fall of stars, particularly leading into big events such as Oscar
night, is an engaging exercise, one of those zeitgeist-driven
experiences possible only through the hive mind of the Web.
</P>
<P>
   This weekend, though, the site is going to be a little more
corporeal. It's taken over the south side of four blocks of the
Sunset Strip, from the Standard Hotel to the House of Blues. Even
the tattoo parlor and palm reader are renting out their joints for
themed transformations, and the whole stretch has been scrimmed and
lighted for dramatic effect, with bands performing tonight and
other special events going on all weekend.
</P>
<P>
   The big blowout is, of course, on Oscar night, when everyone's
favorite vegan dance-rock-blues-jazz-underground wizard, Grammy
nominee Moby, takes over the turntables at the House of Blues.
Earth, Wind and Fire will also be playing that night, and comedian
Rob Schneider will emcee.
</P>
<P>
   Good luck getting into the HOB that night without an invitation,
though _ not to mention getting through the chaotic Sunset Strip
traffic. But the party will be Webcast online, with 15 cameras
stationed around the House of Blues, and found online at
www.hsx.com/o2k.
</P>
<P>
   Last year's much smaller HSX event at the House of Blues drew
more than 1 million viewers, said HSX chief executive officer
Michael Burns. It should be an even more popular online event this
year. Plus, you don't have to worry about parking. &QL; 
POKE, AGAIN &QL; 
Warner Bros., knowing a good and fabulously profitable thing when
it sees it, will bring another Pokemon movie to U.S. screens this
summer, only about nine months after the first one blew through the
box office in record fashion.
</P>
<P>
   The cleverly titled ``Pokemon the Movie 2000'' will debut on
July 21.
</P>
<P>
   The biggest news for Pokemon fans is that the movie will debut
six new creatures, and once again, the new creatures will be on
special trading cards from Wizards of the Coast that will be handed
out at theaters. Here we go again. &QL; 
MIXED MESSAGE &QL; 
I know the U.S. Department of Justice is trying to stop illegal
hacking, but something tells me some of its campaign isn't always
working quite as intended. Exhibit A is the masthead of the winter
2000 edition of the magazine 2600:
</P>
<P>
   ``Hacking can get you in a whole lot more trouble than you think
and is a completely creepy thing to do,'' it says, quoting in large
type from a DOJ Web page (at www.usdoj.gov/kidspage/do-dont/reckle
ss.htm) aimed at children.
</P>
<P>
   When quotes like this are put front and center of the magazine
that bills itself as ``the hacker quarterly,'' it's pretty obvious
at least some hackers !ital!like the idea of causing a little
trouble, however ``creepy'' it may be.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking of tweaking the legal beagles, 2600's cover features
what appears to be a screen capture from a video of
celebrated/notorious San Fernando Valley hacker Kevin Mitnick.
</P>
<P>
   He's pressing a ``Free Kevin'' bumper sticker against the window
of what appears to be the Metropolitan Detention Center in downtown
Los Angeles, in a nose-thumbing at federal prison regulations.
Mitnick recently finished five years behind bars for
computer-related crimes. &QL;

<P>
   Internet watchdogs say a new system that makes it easy to
publish information anonymously on the Internet could give a free
rein to terrorists, software pirates and pedophiles. But the
creators of Freenet believe the risk is worth taking to preserve
free speech on the Net.
</P>
<P>
   Ian Clarke began creating Freenet in his final year at
Scotland's Edinburgh University in response to Australia's
proposals for stringent Internet censorship laws.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Freenet protocol is designed to make tracing the
publishers of content impossible,'' Clarke said. ``It's also
extremely difficult to remove files from Freenet once they've been
published.''
</P>
<P>
   Unlike files on the Web, files on Freenet do not have a unique
Internet address that specifies the computer on which they are
held. Instead, files are distributed around the Net on computers
belonging to Freenet members. Several copies of each file exist in
different places _ making it hard to delete them.
</P>
<P>
   When a file is stored, it is given a key, Freenet's equivalent
of a Web address. The software then forwards the data to other
servers, but the creator of the file doesn't know which servers
receive the data.
</P>
<P>
   To retrieve a file, users enter the key. Their computer then
queries Freenet servers until one is found that has the associated
files.
</P>
<P>
   If a Freenet user has a copy of a file on their machine, it
doesn't mean they published it. In fact, they might not even know
it's there.
</P>
<P>
   Clarke argues that no one computer user be held responsible for
Freenet files, because there is no way to determine their origin.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a perfect machine anarchy,'' Clarke says. ``No single
computer is in control.''
</P>
<P>
   Roger Darlington, chairman of the Internet Watch Foundation _ an
independent body that monitors Web sites hosted in Britain for
illegal material such as child pornography _ is worried about the
implications of Freenet.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is clear potential for misuse by criminals, terrorists
and pedophiles,'' Darlington said.
</P>
<P>
   Keith Akerman, chairman of Britain's Association of Chief Police
Officers' working group on computer crime, agreed.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm all for freedom of speech, but networks like Freenet could
severely impede our ability to investigate Internet crimes,''
Akerman said. &QL;

<P>
   Life under the waves can get pretty crowded when you are a sea
squirt vying for space on the rocks. But these sea creatures have a
novel weapon _ they use their sperm to sabotage the eggs of other
kinds of sea squirt.
</P>
<P>
   According to a California marine biologist, this may be the
first example of sperm competition between species.
</P>
<P>
   Sea squirts spend most of their life clinging on to rocks, and
many are prolific spawners. Females and males release eggs and
sperm into the water, where they mix and fertilize. Any egg that is
fertilized by more than one sperm will not develop properly, so,
like other animals, sea squirts have evolved ways to prevent this
occurrence. Once a sperm binds to an egg, the egg releases an
enzyme that alters its surface, preventing other sperm from
attaching.
</P>
<P>
   Now Charles Lambert of California State University in Fullerton
has found that other species of sea squirts can subvert this
mechanism. Lambert studied two species, Ascidia nigra and Ascidia
sydneiensis, in the waters around Hawaii and Guam. Although the two
cannot cross-fertilize, the sperm of one still triggers the defense
mechanism in eggs of the other. This prevents the species under
attack from being fertilized.
</P>
<P>
   ``If one species can cause eggs of another species to die
without being fertilized, that takes a possible competitor for
space out of the game,'' Lambert says.
</P>
<P>
   This may explain why the males produce so many sperm.
</P>
<P>
   ``One function of the excess sperm may be to make some of the
other species' eggs infertile,'' Lambert says.
</P>
<P>
   He believes that germ-cell warfare between species may be more
common than anyone realized.
</P>
<P>
   ``Few people have looked to see if sperm that cannot fertilize
an egg can still render that egg incapable of fertilization,''
Lambert said. &QL;

   An ingenious new material appears set to turn everyday physics
on its head and open the way to entirely new kinds of electronic
components.
</P>
<P>
   In 1968, Russian physicist Victor Veselago worked out how an
imaginary material would behave if it had negative values for its
permeability and permittivity _ properties that measure how much a
material modifies magnetic and electric fields. Veselago showed
that the material would bend _ or refract _ a light beam
differently from a normal substance like glass. It would also
reverse the Doppler shift that warps the colors of very fast-moving
objects.
</P>
<P>
   Scientists couldn't test Veselago's ideas because, at the time,
no such material existed.
</P>
<P>
   Recently, however, David Smith, Sheldon Schultz and their
colleagues at the University of California in San Diego have made
such an object. It consists of arrays of copper rings connected by
wires. At a meeting of the American Physical Society in
Minneapolis, Schultz said his team plans to test Veselago's
predictions for microwaves.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're convinced it will work, and it'll be a dramatic
effect,'' Schultz says.
</P>
<P>
   He thinks such a scenario could provide exotic components for
uses such as satellite communication. &QL;

   Melting glaciers _ rather than flowing surface water _ could
have carved out the distinctive valleys of Mars.
</P>
<P>
   Branching networks of small valleys have led many scientists to
conclude that rivers of running water once flowed freely across the
surface of Mars. But this would mean that the red planet once had a
much warmer climate than it does today and, apart from its valleys,
there is no evidence to suggest that Mars was ever warm.
</P>
<P>
   But Pascal Lee, a planetary scientist at NASA's Ames Research
Center in Mountain View, Calif., says the answer may be found on
Devon Island in the Canadian Arctic, where he is studying valleys
carved by glacial meltwater.
</P>
<P>
   ``What we've been finding on Devon Island,'' Lee says, ``is a
wide variety of valley types _ from canyons to little networks of
small valleys _ that bear an uncanny resemblance to specific
counterparts on Mars.''
</P>
<P>
   In particular, he says, the Martian valleys ``cut through a
desert that otherwise has very little sign of water flowing
nearby.''
</P>
<P>
   The constant width and depth of Martian valleys over long
distances, their flat floors and steep walls are distinctive
features found on Devon Island, but uncommon on river networks.
</P>
<P>
   Lee believes that other Martian landforms, notably some large
canyons on the west end of Vallis Marineris, could actually have
been carved by flowing glacial ice. Devon Island also has canyons
like these, he told the 31st Lunar and Planetary Institute Science
Conference in Houston last week.
</P>
<P>
   If Lee is correct, Mars may have had a cold climate, in which
snowfall piled up to form glaciers that later melted in the heat
generated inside the planet. Mars expert Jim Head of Brown
University in Rhode Island welcomed Lee's work, saying the analogy
to Devon Island is helping him visualize how melting snow might
have produced valleys on Mars. &QL;

CRIMINALIZING THE CLUMSY  

</HEADLINE>
  By DAVID GRIMES   
 Sarasota (Fla.) Herald-Tribune   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   As if life for the clumsy were not challenging enough, British
researchers have now come up with software that might make lack of
coordination a crime.
</P>
<P>
   According to an article in New Scientist magazine, unearthed by
News of the Weird connoisseur Chuck Shepherd, scientists have come
up with a way to assist police by rigging surveillance cameras with
a gizmo that electronically identifies people who are moving about
in suspicious ways.
</P>
<P>
   As an example, said one of the developers, someone ``awkwardly''
approaching a car is probably up to no good.
</P>
<P>
   As one of millions of Americans who are coordination-challenged,
I resent the implication that our awkward movements are a sign of
criminal intent or motivated by anything other than sheer
clumsiness.
</P>
<P>
   Sure, it is amusing to watch us repeatedly drop our keys or bump
our heads as we get into and out of a car, but is that reason
enough to accuse of being car thieves?
</P>
<P>
   Although I have no research to back this up, I think it's fair
to say that 99 percent of the people who move about in an awkward
fashion are not criminals, at least not most of the time.
</P>
<P>
   (This is also an insult to people who ``are'' criminals most of
the time but are not awkward. These people may be a menace to
society, but is it necessary to strip them of all dignity?)
</P>
<P>
   People who cannot hand money to the drive-through cashier
without dropping a quarter and having it roll under the car are to
be pitied, not incarcerated.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, one might argue that awkwardness is a sign of superior
intelligence, not sociopathy. So deep in thought are we that we
sometimes forget to coordinate our bodies, with the result that we
step on rakes and smack ourselves in the face or drop slices of
pizza on our laps. (Topping-side down, of course. That may have
been one of the immutable laws of physics that we were
contemplating at the time of the accident.)
</P>
<P>
   Making matters worse is that in these days of political
correctness it is insensitive to refer to us as ``clumsy'' or
``awkward'' or ``klutzy'' or any of those other ugly words
including but not limited to ``gawky,'' ``oafish,'' ``bungler,''
``oaf,'' ``fumbler'' or the one that really gets under my skin,
``hobbledehoy.'' The disabled prefer to be called ``differently
abled.'' For us, ``coordination-impaired'' is acceptable.
</P>
<P>
   What people need to remember is that the person who catches his
necktie in his trouser fly is not doing so intentionally; he is
merely a victim of one of those awkward moments that just happen to
occur much more often for the coordination-impaired than for
others. (Also be advised that while the person may look funny
walking around in that hunched-over manner, it is not polite to
laugh.)
</P>
<P>
   Also, just because a person is coordination-impaired does not
mean he or she cannot lead a full, rich, happy life. (Assuming he
or she can minimize the unintentional self-inflicted injuries along
the way.) Some of the most successful, influential Americans are
coordination-impaired. Take Al Gore, for instance. Here is a man
who cannot clap his hands and blink at the same time, yet he may
well turn out to be our next president.
</P>
<P>
   Would you assume that Gore was ``up to no good'' if he tries to
dance at his inauguration ball? Tipper might, if Gore accidentally
knocks her off the stage, but the rest of us, I think, need to be
more tolerant.
</P>
<P>
   Coordination-impairment may be amusing, but it's not a crime.

   CONGRESS HITS DEAD END IN TRYING TO SLOW PRICE JUMP AT THE PUMP
</P>
<P>
   WASHINGTON - Fearing voter road rage fueled by high prices at
the pump, members of Congress are scrambling for solutions to the
rising cost of gas. But oil is proving to be a slippery subject.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans first explored repealing a 4.3 cents-per-gallon
federal fuel tax only to encounter resistance from road builders
who might lose work funded by the levy. Democrat Sen. John Breaux
of Louisiana wants to open more coastal areas to oil drilling, but
he might have trouble finding many takers for that idea.
</P>
<P>
   House members were supposed to consider a measure that would
have cut foreign aid to nations that fix oil prices, but the
measure was gutted before the vote.
</P>
<P>
   The one thing Republicans and Democrats agree on is that they
need to appear to be doing something about gas price hikes. ``I
don't think anybody on this floor wants to go home and face angry
people about the prices in this country,'' Rep. Karen Thurman,
D-Fla., told her House colleagues.
</P>
<P>
   Thurman, like some in the Clinton administration, wants tax
incentives to encourage uses of new energy technology such as solar
and wind power to decrease reliance on oil. Some Republicans are
skeptical to say the least.
</P>
<P>
   ``We doubt there is a breeze sufficient to fire the furnaces of
Bethlehem steel,'' GOP Sens. Jesse Helms of North Carolina and Paul
Coverdell of Georgia wrote to President Clinton this month. They
urged him to lean on Western Hemisphere oil producers such as
Mexico, Venezuela and Colombia to boost production.
</P>
<P>
   At present, the main Republican solution appears to be to blame
the Clinton administration for failing to see the price hike coming
and for not having a comprehensive energy policy.
</P>
<P>
   ``My great concern is that the United States government does not
really have an energy plan,'' complained Senate Majority Leader
Trent Lott, R-Miss. ``There's not a short-term solution that's been
proposed by the administration. There's not a long-term proposal.''
</P>
<P>
   TAKING A BITE OUT OF CRIME
</P>
<P>
   Countering the push for tougher gun control measures, a group of
House Republicans is offering a tough-on-crime measure that could
quickly funnel law enforcement money to Southern states.
</P>
<P>
   Led by Rep. Bill McCollum, the Floridian who chairs a crime
subcommittee, the lawmakers are trying to enact a federal version
of a Virginia program that has led to a measurable drop in gun
crimes. Called Project Exile, the program imposes a mandatory
minimum five-year sentence on anyone convicted of carrying a
firearm during an array of crimes.
</P>
<P>
   The proposal would make available $100 million in criminal
justice money to states that adopt such guidelines. McCollum said
Florida, Louisiana, South Carolina and Texas would already qualify
for the aid.
</P>
<P>
   Critics say such lock-em-up approaches simply pack offenders in
prison. McCollum conceded incarceration costs could rise under the
measure but he suggested the deterrent provided by his bill was
worth it.
</P>
<P>
   ``The message is, if you commit a crime with a gun, you are
going to do a lot of time,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   HELLO DOLLY
</P>
<P>
   Dolly Parton came to town to pick up an award for her endowment.
</P>
<P>
   No, this isn't another Washington scandal. The endowment in this
case is Parton's $7 million commitment to the Imagination Library,
a literacy program she founded and promotes.
</P>
<P>
   The Association of American Publishers honored Parton for her
efforts, and Education Secretary Richard Riley was on hand to
present the award.
</P>
<P>
   Promoting his own country roots as much as his education
credentials, Riley said that ``as somebody from the upcountry of
South Carolina,'' he was more than qualified to honor the country
music star.
</P>
<P>
   Addressing the audience, Riley said, ``I do not see a lot of
people who know the tune to `I Don't Know Whether to Kill Myself or
Go Bowling.' Now, I can hum that tune. A few years ago when some
members of Congress wanted to eliminate my job I use to hum that
song every day. My staff got to the point that they decided to give
me a bowling ball as a present.''
</P>
<P>
   TOBACCO POLITICS
</P>
<P>
   Republicans don't often praise decisions by the Supreme Court,
but they were happy with the recent ruling that the Food and Drug
Administration lacks the authority to regulate cigarettes.
</P>
<P>
   Tobacco-state lawmakers were especially thrilled, weary from
years of attacks on an industry critical to many Southern
communities.
</P>
<P>
   The decision, said Rep. Howard Coble, ``is a victory for North
Carolina tobacco growers and cigarette manufacturers, along with
Congress' ability to decide who will regulate what products in this
country.''
</P>
<P>
   Interestingly, most Democrats from tobacco-growing states and
districts had little to say about the decision, reflecting perhaps
their torn loyalties between tobacco farmers and President Clinton
who had pushed for the new FDA powers.

   SAN FRANCISCO _ First the ballots get lost in a postal snafu.
Next a ``professional rummager'' finds 52 stolen Oscars in the
trash in L.A.'s Koreatown. We have graduated from Oscarmania to
vicarious enjoyment of the sabotage, which I suppose is merely a
heightened strain of Oscarmania.
</P>
<P>
   The mood is contagious. And with the National Collegiate
Athletic Association basketball tournament falling apart faster
than Bobby Knight's temper, Sunday night's Oscar awards show might
be all the March Madness anybody needs.
</P>
<P>
   Herewith: Predictions, feelings.
</P>

   ___
</P>
<P>
   BEST PICTURE
</P>
<P>
   Should win:
</P>
<P>
   ``The Insider''? Only if it's 1975 and there's no ``Nashville,''
``Shampoo,'' ``Cuckoo's Nest,'' ``Jaws,'' ``Barry Lyndon'' or ``Dog
Day Afternoon.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The Cider House Rules''? Only if the four other nominees are
``The Cider House Rules,'' ``The Cider House Rules,'' ``The Cider
House Rules'' and ``The Cider House Rules'' - and as a promotional
tie-in, Planned Parenthood hands out apples and copies of the
Saturday Evening Post, too.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Green Mile''? You're kidding, right?
</P>
<P>
   And ``American Beauty''? Only if I'd never been to the suburbs
and had never read a John Updike or Philip Roth novel.
</P>
<P>
   That leaves ``The Sixth Sense,'' the only one of these movies
that actually improves upon a second or third encounter.
</P>
<P>
   Will win: ``American Beauty.'' (``John or Philip who?'')
</P>
<P>
   ___
</P>
<P>
   BEST ACTOR
</P>

   Should Win: Russell Crowe. Heartbreak, rage and searing
vulnerability _ with a potbelly! (Or Denzel Washington, a galvanic
force on a disposable soapbox.)
</P>
<P>
   Will win: Kevin Spacey. Someone has been taking his Jack Lemmon
pills!
</P>
<P>
   ___
</P>
<P>
   BEST ACTRESS
</P>
<P>
   Should Win: Hilary Swank. More than a sock in a crotch. Her
emotional investment goes so deep she can't fathom it.

preggers wife sure was juicy in that glorified supporting role.''
</P>
<P>
   ___
</P>
<P>
   BEST SUPPORTING ACTOR
</P>
<P>
   Should win: Haley Joel Osment. At last: A kid who's earned the

</P>
<P>
   Will win: I see a precocious Oscar speech.
</P>
<P>
   ___
</P>
<P>
   BEST SUPPORTING ACTRESS
</P>
<P>
   Should win: Those are my hands thrown up. Chloe Sevigny showed
me how to love Swank. Toni Colette showed me how to love the
paranoid Osment. Catherine Keener showed me how to love Cameron
Diaz and John Malkovich _ acerbically, hilariously and at the same
time. So, her.
</P>
<P>
   Will win: Angelina Jolie. She made crazy and emaciated
Academy-friendly. (Though I'm getting a Brenda Fricker-in-``My Left
Foot'' vibe about Colette.)
</P>
<P>
   ___
</P>
<P>
   BEST DIRECTOR
</P>
<P>
   Should win: Spike Jonze. Was John Malkovich's head not the most
fascinating ride you got on last year?

Metaphorically sound, metaphysically amazing.
</P>
<P>
   Will win: Alan Ball, ``American Beauty.'' Yes, I've seen his ABC

bag was pretty beautiful.
</P>
<P>

&HT;     POLITICS AND STRANGE BEDFELLOWS IN `WAKING THE DEAD'

<P>
   On a college campus somewhere, there blooms a love like Fielding
and Sarah's.
</P>
<P>
   He wants to be president and is on the Democratic fast track to
Congress; she's an activist who hates the U.S. government. It's
1971 or '72 and they meet at a magazine run by Fielding's leftist
brother and seem able to put away their collegiate righteousness.
</P>
<P>
   They go out to lunch, and in a matter of jump cuts he lays out
most of his political beliefs. She's attracted and repulsed. ``Can
I buy you dinner sometime?'' he asks. ``Can I talk?'' she retorts.
</P>
<P>
   A love is born, the glue of which is politics, ideology and some
metaphysics. It's not a romance so much as a dissertation with
feelings. But Keith Gordon's ``Waking the Dead,'' as adapted by
Gordon and Robert Dillon from Scott Spencer's elaborate mini-saga,
is sterile and unconvincing as a political-thriller love story.
Instead it relies on Billy Crudup and a wounded-looking Jennifer
Connelly to illuminate it, which they do hotly, like a pair of
halogen lamps that have been on all night.
</P>
<P>
   Since we are informed at the outset that Sarah has been killed
in a plane crash en route to Chile, she seems that much more
angelic in the flashbacks. Accordingly, things seem lighted by
halo, and Fielding's eventual suspicion that she's haunting him
only plays into the celestial dimensions. Fielding tells his sister
(Janet McTeer) he can still feel her when he is walking the New
York streets; she doesn't think that's something political
candidates ought to do.
</P>
<P>
   As involved as Crudup and Connelly beseech you to be with this
story, their very youthfulness, their nagging lack of adulthood,
keeps the film from being anything more credible than a tight
grad-school tryst. Convinced Sarah is still with him, Fielding
begins to lose it, circa 1985. But it's as though his inability to
pull himself together will cause him to fail his orals rather than
lose an election.
</P>
<P>
   Gordon is still trying to parse out the contradictions of
adolescence and adulthood and infuse them with the same seriousness
and insouciance that he did with ``The Chocolate War'' and ``A
Midnight Clear.'' But he's never been able to make the twain meet.
In that thematic failure, he actually gets a grip on a handsome
love story.
</P>
<P>
   In one of the most lived-in conversations between a movie couple
that I can remember, Sarah tells Fielding who she thinks he is and
about the guarantees of fate during a subway ride from a disastrous
fund-raiser. It's one of those indelible, all-too-real
confessionals college women have with their boyfriends in
candle-lit studio dorms with Joni Mitchell playing softly in the
background.
</P>
<P>
   As a matter of fact, Gordon happens to have the Joni queued. ``A
Case of You'' plays so many times, a floodgate opens and her entire
catalog threatens to come pouring in. ``Can't we think of this as a
wartime romance?'' Fielding asks Sarah early on. Only if the war is
over by the time classes start in the fall.

&HT;     OUTDOOR ADVENTURE? TRY DISNEYLAND 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By TOM STIENSTRA  
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Yosemite, Tahoe, Shasta and the Golden Gate may
be the top outdoor destinations in California, but not a one is the
state's most popular getaway. You know what is? That is, the No. 1
getaway for people not only from California, but also from
throughout the world?
</P>
<P>
   It's Disneyland, along with Universal Studios and Knott's Berry
Farm. That's right, the L.A. movie with a cast of thousands, make
that millions, 75-degree weather and where every visitor going
through the gate of the Magic Kingdom has stars in his or her eyes.
</P>
<P>
   Especially kids, whose biggest fantasies come to life as you
watch.
</P>
<P>
   For a guy more accustomed to an ascent up the back side of Mount
Whitney than a frontal assault on Splash Mountain, I probably
looked like a man from Mars wandering around amid the crowds. After
all, I still thought they still sold ``E'' tickets for the best
rides at Disneyland. But my two kids, Jeremy, 12, and Kris, 8, were
more than willing to lead the way, acting as guides for my wife,
Stephani, and me.
</P>
<P>
   Yes, this is a paradise for kids, and it doesn't take long for
them to become experts. The first stop always is Disneyland, coming
after the flight south, the terrorizing drive (via rental car or
shuttle bus) on the highways to Anaheim, and getting set in a
hotel. The first thing you notice is that spring has arrived,
temperatures are in the mid-70s daily, the happy crowds are up
early, walking to the entrance gates for the 7:30 a.m. opening (for
those paying an extra fee, and we'll get to that), talking in every
language imaginable, pointing at Matterhorn Mountain looming over
the park.
</P>
<P>
   This is the true United Nations. While walking to the entrance,
we heard people talking in Spanish, Japanese, Chinese, Indian,
German, French, Russian, even English. Everybody has the same silly
grins, myself included, something like Clark Griswold and family,
regardless of the culture. Disneyland is like religion: many paths,
one truth.
</P>
<P>
   It doesn't take long to figure out the magic of the appeal. The
best rides combine amusement-park thrills with Disney-type
production. The best, according to the experts _ kids _ are Splash
Mountain, Space Mountain and Indiana Jones.
</P>
<P>
   The most famous moment, of course, is the head-long plunge at
Splash Mountain, where you sit in a boat-like ``log.'' First you
float along this ``river,'' with turns, rises and falls, in and out
of the mountain, then suddenly plunge in a heart-pounding surge,
what seems straight down into this pool, similar to a Class V rapid
at Hells Corner on the Klamath River. At the height of terror, a
remote camera snaps your picture _ they sell thousands of these
shots. If you've made the trip, you probably have one yourself.
</P>
<P>
   Close inspection of these photographs reveals the adults in
utter terror, yet youngsters with happy, excited grins. That should
tell you everything you need to know about the trip down here.
</P>
<P>
   You can have a similar encounter at Space Mountain, where you
climb into this spaceship-like car, then careen through space at
warp speeds, with unexpected drops, turns and rises. Let me tell
you, I have a pilot's license, am certified to fly high-power
aircraft, and have been charged by grizzly bears and swum Class V
rapids _ and nothing has ever scared me as much as this ride. This
was pointed out to me by my kids, who spent much of the week making
fun of me _ the ultimate bond between males _ simulating my howls,
screams and shouts of absolute horror, fright and panic.
</P>
<P>
   They said the ride was ``fun,'' of course, ``almost as good as
Jurassic Park.''
</P>
<P>
   The Jurassic Park ride is not at Disneyland, but at Universal
Studios near downtown Los Angeles. Universal is part of the must-do
tour for every visitor to the region, and, unlike Disneyland, the
lines are far shorter and the waits minimal _ 5 to 10 minutes
instead of the 20 minutes to an hour that has become par for the
course at Disneyland. There is hope that the $2.1 billion expansion
of Disneyland, due to be completed early next year, will solve the
long lines and waits.
</P>
<P>
   Jurassic Park features sitting in a boat-like raft, then barely
eluding being eaten by a T-Rex followed by a drop-dead, horrifying
fall into water where everybody gets soaked. Because the lines were
so short, unlike Disneyland, some kids will repeat rides over and
over; they never blow a circuit on overload.
</P>
<P>
   What makes this park work is that you get to live through cinema
special effects in all kinds of scenarios, from time travel (``Back
to the Future''), riding a bike over L.A. (``E.T.''), an earthquake
(tram tour) and barely eluding being eaten by Jaws (tram tour),
among others, yet with no long delays. The tram tour through the
studio lots is like a trip into the past, the sites of creation of
thousands of movies.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, to complete the L.A. circuit, the other must-go is
Knott's Berry Farm. This is more like the ultimate amusement park,
featuring Ghost Rider, the highest roller coaster in the world, and
Log Ride, a kids' favorite for its simple thrills.
</P>
<P>
   But if you want overall shock, wait until you get the bill. The
entry price for adults at Disneyland is $76 for a three-day ticket,
plus an $8 surcharge for early gate privileges (7:30 a.m. instead
of 9 a.m., absolutely a must), with some hotels adding a $5
``surcharge'' for selling you the ticket, which is just a skim job.
Three-day tickets for kids 3 to 11 are $57, not including
surcharges. Universal charges $42 a day for adults, and Knott's
Berry Farm a little less than that.
</P>
<P>
   Hotels are booked near 100 percent nearly every day of the year
and commonly charge $100 and up per day for rooms with multiple
beds. Car rentals are the biggest gouge, $250 to $300 for a week.
The only flexibility is with airline tickets, with Southwest
offering fares as low as $56 (well in advance, a limited promotion)
to as high as $91 per seat. The cost of meals in the parks is
simply an outrage, often $25 to $40 for a family ordering
greaseburgers, fries and cokes.
</P>
<P>
   You don't need a calculator for a brain to figure out that this
can turn into one pricey getaway.
</P>
<P>
   But do you know what? This is one of the few times when price
makes no difference. They could charge anything they want and
people would pay it. After all, there are no price tags on the
biggest smiles you've ever seen.

 &HT;     c.2000 Albany Times Union  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Hey, Oscar, think you could lighten up a touch? You're quite the
morose fellow, sitting there in your black turtleneck with your
dog-eared copy of ``The Bell Jar,'' always blathering on about
death and depression and death and catastrophe and death and failed
romance and death.
</P>
<P>
   Death isn't all there is to life, you know. There are other
things. Chocolate, for instance. Chickadees. Jim Carrey movies.
</P>
<P>
   Oscar doesn't like Jim Carrey, as anyone knows who has paid
attention to the Academy Award nominations, much less the actual
awards, for the past two years. Carrey turned in one of the most
praiseworthy, kudos-worthy, little-gold-man-worthy performances of
1998 _ as the titular television icon in ``The Truman Show'' _ and
turned in another last year, as Andy Kaufmann redux in ``Man on the
Moon.'' He deserved a nod from Oscar. But, no.
</P>
<P>
   The question, for those of us who fret over such movie-industry
bosh in advance of the handing out of the Oscars tonight, is: Why?
What is it about Jim Carrey that rankles the Academy of Motion
Picture Arts and Sciences? Why can't they regard him as a Serious
Ac-TOR?
</P>
<P>
   The short answer is, because he's not. He's a comic genius with
superhuman powers of mimicry and a dramatic well of surprising
depth. He can act, he can inhabit characters, he can do more
trickery with a line of dialogue than most heavy thespians, but
he'll probably never overcome his reputation as Butt-Talker first,
Actor second. All those vulgar antics during his stints as Oscar
presenter may have scotched his chances for good.
</P>
<P>
   ___
</P>
<P>
   MORBID SUBJECTS
</P>
<P>
   For if the Academy Awards do nothing else well, they take
themselves _ and the movie industry _ seriously. Most of the time,
films get nominated for tackling morbid subjects: murder, suicide,
the death penalty, mass human destruction, war, abortion, disease.
The grimmer the better, although the quintessential Oscar nominee
has a dose of uplift to boot; death often leads to redemption. And
if it makes us cry, perfect.
</P>
<P>
   Just look at the slate of this year's best-picture nominees.
``The Cider House Rules'' shocked a few critics (this one included)
when it earned a nod, but perhaps it shouldn't have. Besides
addressing a host of sober topics (abortion, drugs, death), the
film is triumphantly optimistic in tone and jerks buckets of tears.
Similarly, the damp ``The Green Mile'' entwines gruesome
electrocutions with miracles, a Christ figure of childlike
innocence and one heck of a cute mouse.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Sixth Sense'' involves dead people and the depressed
little boy who sees them, but the movie is unflaggingly
compassionate _ even toward ghosts _ and manages to find closure
for everyone. Amend that: almost everyone. (``The Insider,'' on the
other hand, doles out neither death nor redemption, which doesn't
bode well for its chances tonight.)
</P>
<P>
   Even this year's most independent-minded best-picture nominee,
``American Beauty,'' conforms to the standard requirements. Death
is an unequivocal presence; the film is, after all, narrated by a
corpse. Yet Sam Mendes' bristling satire of consumerist ennui is
also shockingly, poetically spiritual, and its conclusion is filled
with hope. A nasty, funny piece of work it may be, but it's a
nasty, funny piece of work that makes us weep. If it wins tonight,
it'll win not on laughter, but on tears.
</P>
<P>
   ___
</P>
<P>
   COMEDY FACTOR
</P>
<P>
   None of this should surprise. Comedies do not generally win
major-category Oscars unless they're based on the Bard
(``Shakespeare in Love''), involve melodramatic death scenes
(``Terms of Endearment'') or are set in World War II prison camps
(``Stalag 17,'' ``Life is Beautiful''). Cynicism doesn't tell us
this; experience does.
</P>
<P>
   There are exceptions to the rule _ the odd ``Annie Hall'' or
``It Happened One Night'' (or even ``The Sting'') _ that wins on
funny bones alone. But by and large, Oscar prefers highbrow to
lowbrow, tragic to comic, Stanislavsky sturm-und-drang to air-light
verbal jousting (to say nothing of poop jokes).
</P>
<P>
   So it is, most years. And so it is in the individual performance
categories. As Emil Jannings proved to Charlie Chaplin at the first
Academy Awards in 1929, loud dramatic puffing wields the upper
hand. If the role involves death, disease, depression or disability
_ the four D's _ then the chances of winning become almost
insurmountable.
</P>
<P>
   By that reckoning Kevin Spacey should win for his performance in
``American Beauty'' _ he's funny, but he's dead _ as should Hilary
Swank for ``Boys Don't Cry,'' although Julianne Moore (``The End of
the Affair'') certainly qualifies.
</P>
<P>
   And when a purely comic performance does earn an Oscar, it's
most often in the supporting categories: Kevin Kline for ``A Fish
Called Wanda,'' Mia Sorvino for ``Mighty Aphrodite.'' Those who
score in the best-actor categories for a humorous role tend to be
either powerhouse dramatic types slumming in comedy _ Jack
Nicholson, Lee Marvinor total flukes. Roberto Benigni, who won last
year for ``Life is Beautiful,'' might qualify as the latter sort
were it not for the fact (spoiler!) that he dies at the end of the
film. Call it the Cruel End Dispensation.
</P>
<P>
   ___
</P>
<P>
   OVERLOOKED COMEDIANS
</P>
<P>
   Just think of the comic geniuses who haven't scored with Oscar:
Eddie Murphy, Buster Keaton, Steve Martin, Peter Sellers, Mae West.
Although Charlie Chaplin won in plenty of other categories, he
never earned an acting award. And Cary Grant, whom film historian
David Thomson once called ``the best and most important actor in
the history of the cinema,'' had to wait until he'd retired before
the industry got around to recognizing him with a consolation-prize
``Honorary Oscar'' in 1969.
</P>
<P>
   Cranks and film buffs, take note: Grant was never even nominated
for a humorous role. He was tapped twice, once for being soppy
(``Penny Serenade''), once for being wooden (``None But the Lonely
Heart''). Never for being a charm.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, in the entire history of the Oscars, only two bona fide
comedians have ever earned acting awards. The most recent was
Benigni. The year before, Robin Williams received best supporting
actor for his bit as the kindly shrink in ``Good Will Hunting.''
Although Benigni's qualified (more or less) as a comic role,
Williams' did not _ his was more in line with the fuzzy-wuzzy parts
he's accepted of late.
</P>
<P>
   Williams' persona is, at least, cozier than Jim Carrey's, so the
Academy doesn't hold his funnyman roles against him. Still, it
speaks volumes about Hollywood's morose disposition that the
century's greatest comic actors haven't won Oscars for their
greatest comic performances. Decades from now, movie nerds will
still be watching (in some form or another) Keaton in ``The
General,'' Chaplin in ``The Gold Rush,'' Sellers in ``The Pink
Panther.'' The films will remain, embraced with belly laughs, eons
after everyone's forgotten who clutched the best-actor statue in
1935 (Victor McLaglen, ``The Informer'').
</P>
<P>
   ___
</P>
<P>
   STARCHY CONSEQUENCE
</P>
<P>
   Awards are fun, but they're meaningless. Although a few brave
souls have suggested the Oscars follow the Golden Globes' lead and
split the major awards between comic and dramatic performances,
comic and dramatic films, the chances of that happening are just
shy of nil. Members of the Academy regard themselves and their
movies with too much starchy consequence to start passing out
awards for mere frivolity.
</P>
<P>
   You and I and Uncle Ed may take our movies as entertainment, but
in Hollywood they're serious business. They're art. And sometimes
they are, but often as not the films that get ignored by the
Academy boast the purest art of all: that which relieves us from
the quotidian pains of life. Good comedy is impossibly hard to pull
off, harder than melodrama, harder than shake-n'-bake camerawork or
egghead philosophizing.
</P>
<P>
   But when it works _ when that bubble of laughter begins its
unstoppable swell _ the result can be as transporting and
illuminating as the muddiest trek through Bergman. Yes, human
existence is fraught with grief and ends with death and the good
lord knows what's next. Too true, too true; we've seen it on bumper
stickers (``Life's a __ and then you die'') and in multiple
screenings of ``The Seventh Seal.''
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes, a great film comes along that reminds us,
beautifully, of our mortality. Sometimes, a great film comes along
that doesn't. Oscar or no Oscar, three cheers for the ones that
don't.

</P>
<P>
   Oscar doesn't like Jim Carrey, as anyone knows who has paid
attention to the Academy Award nominations, much less the actual
awards, for the past two years. Carrey turned in one of the most
praiseworthy, kudos-worthy, little-gold-man-worthy performances of
1998 _ as the titular television icon in ``The Truman Show'' _ and
turned in another last year, as Andy Kaufmann redux in ``Man on the
Moon.'' He deserved a nod from Oscar. But, no.
</P>
<P>
   The question, for those of us who fret over such movie-industry
bosh in advance of the handing out of the Oscars tonight, is: Why?
What is it about Jim Carrey that rankles the Academy of Motion
Picture Arts and Sciences? Why can't they regard him as a Serious
Ac-TOR?
</P>
<P>
   The short answer is, because he's not. He's a comic genius with
superhuman powers of mimicry and a dramatic well of surprising
depth. He can act, he can inhabit characters, he can do more
trickery with a line of dialogue than most heavy thespians, but
he'll probably never overcome his reputation as Butt-Talker first,
Actor second. All those vulgar antics during his stints as Oscar
presenter may have scotched his chances for good.
</P>
<P>
   ___
</P>
<P>
   MORBID SUBJECTS
</P>
<P>
   For if the Academy Awards do nothing else well, they take
themselves _ and the movie industry _ seriously. Most of the time,
films get nominated for tackling morbid subjects: murder, suicide,
the death penalty, mass human destruction, war, abortion, disease.
The grimmer the better, although the quintessential Oscar nominee
has a dose of uplift to boot; death often leads to redemption. And
if it makes us cry, perfect.
</P>
<P>
   Just look at the slate of this year's best-picture nominees.
``The Cider House Rules'' shocked a few critics (this one included)
when it earned a nod, but perhaps it shouldn't have. Besides
addressing a host of sober topics (abortion, drugs, death), the
film is triumphantly optimistic in tone and jerks buckets of tears.
Similarly, the damp ``The Green Mile'' entwines gruesome
electrocutions with miracles, a Christ figure of childlike
innocence and one heck of a cute mouse.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Sixth Sense'' involves dead people and the depressed
little boy who sees them, but the movie is unflaggingly
compassionate _ even toward ghosts _ and manages to find closure
for everyone. Amend that: almost everyone. (``The Insider,'' on the
other hand, doles out neither death nor redemption, which doesn't
bode well for its chances tonight.)
</P>
<P>
   Even this year's most independent-minded best-picture nominee,
``American Beauty,'' conforms to the standard requirements. Death
is an unequivocal presence; the film is, after all, narrated by a
corpse. Yet Sam Mendes' bristling satire of consumerist ennui is
also shockingly, poetically spiritual, and its conclusion is filled
with hope. A nasty, funny piece of work it may be, but it's a
nasty, funny piece of work that makes us weep. If it wins tonight,
it'll win not on laughter, but on tears.
</P>
<P>
   ___
</P>
<P>
   COMEDY FACTOR
</P>
<P>
   None of this should surprise. Comedies do not generally win
major-category Oscars unless they're based on the Bard
(``Shakespeare in Love''), involve melodramatic death scenes
(``Terms of Endearment'') or are set in World War II prison camps
(``Stalag 17,'' ``Life is Beautiful''). Cynicism doesn't tell us
this; experience does.
</P>
<P>
   There are exceptions to the rule _ the odd ``Annie Hall'' or
``It Happened One Night'' (or even ``The Sting'') _ that wins on
funny bones alone. But by and large, Oscar prefers highbrow to
lowbrow, tragic to comic, Stanislavsky sturm-und-drang to air-light
verbal jousting (to say nothing of poop jokes).
</P>
<P>
   So it is, most years. And so it is in the individual performance
categories. As Emil Jannings proved to Charlie Chaplin at the first
Academy Awards in 1929, loud dramatic puffing wields the upper
hand. If the role involves death, disease, depression or disability
_ the four D's _ then the chances of winning become almost
insurmountable.
</P>
<P>
   By that reckoning Kevin Spacey should win for his performance in
``American Beauty'' _ he's funny, but he's dead _ as should Hilary
Swank for ``Boys Don't Cry,'' although Julianne Moore (``The End of
the Affair'') certainly qualifies.
</P>
<P>
   And when a purely comic performance does earn an Oscar, it's
most often in the supporting categories: Kevin Kline for ``A Fish
Called Wanda,'' Mia Sorvino for ``Mighty Aphrodite.'' Those who
score in the best-actor categories for a humorous role tend to be
either powerhouse dramatic types slumming in comedy _ Jack
Nicholson, Lee Marvinor total flukes. Roberto Benigni, who won last
year for ``Life is Beautiful,'' might qualify as the latter sort
were it not for the fact (spoiler!) that he dies at the end of the
film. Call it the Cruel End Dispensation.
</P>
<P>
   ___
</P>
<P>
   OVERLOOKED COMEDIANS
</P>
<P>
   Just think of the comic geniuses who haven't scored with Oscar:
Eddie Murphy, Buster Keaton, Steve Martin, Peter Sellers, Mae West.
Although Charlie Chaplin won in plenty of other categories, he
never earned an acting award. And Cary Grant, whom film historian
David Thomson once called ``the best and most important actor in
the history of the cinema,'' had to wait until he'd retired before
the industry got around to recognizing him with a consolation-prize
``Honorary Oscar'' in 1969.
</P>
<P>
   Cranks and film buffs, take note: Grant was never even nominated
for a humorous role. He was tapped twice, once for being soppy
(``Penny Serenade''), once for being wooden (``None But the Lonely
Heart''). Never for being a charm.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, in the entire history of the Oscars, only two bona fide
comedians have ever earned acting awards. The most recent was
Benigni. The year before, Robin Williams received best supporting
actor for his bit as the kindly shrink in ``Good Will Hunting.''
Although Benigni's qualified (more or less) as a comic role,
Williams' did not _ his was more in line with the fuzzy-wuzzy parts
he's accepted of late.
</P>
<P>
   Williams' persona is, at least, cozier than Jim Carrey's, so the
Academy doesn't hold his funnyman roles against him. Still, it
speaks volumes about Hollywood's morose disposition that the
century's greatest comic actors haven't won Oscars for their
greatest comic performances. Decades from now, movie nerds will
still be watching (in some form or another) Keaton in ``The
General,'' Chaplin in ``The Gold Rush,'' Sellers in ``The Pink
Panther.'' The films will remain, embraced with belly laughs, eons
after everyone's forgotten who clutched the best-actor statue in
1935 (Victor McLaglen, ``The Informer'').
</P>
<P>
   ___
</P>
<P>
   STARCHY CONSEQUENCE
</P>
<P>
   Awards are fun, but they're meaningless. Although a few brave
souls have suggested the Oscars follow the Golden Globes' lead and
split the major awards between comic and dramatic performances,
comic and dramatic films, the chances of that happening are just
shy of nil. Members of the Academy regard themselves and their
movies with too much starchy consequence to start passing out
awards for mere frivolity.
</P>
<P>
   You and I and Uncle Ed may take our movies as entertainment, but
in Hollywood they're serious business. They're art. And sometimes
they are, but often as not the films that get ignored by the
Academy boast the purest art of all: that which relieves us from
the quotidian pains of life. Good comedy is impossibly hard to pull
off, harder than melodrama, harder than shake-n'-bake camerawork or
egghead philosophizing.
</P>
<P>
   But when it works _ when that bubble of laughter begins its
unstoppable swell _ the result can be as transporting and
illuminating as the muddiest trek through Bergman. Yes, human
existence is fraught with grief and ends with death and the good
lord knows what's next. Too true, too true; we've seen it on bumper
stickers (``Life's a __ and then you die'') and in multiple
screenings of ``The Seventh Seal.''
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes, a great film comes along that reminds us,
beautifully, of our mortality. Sometimes, a great film comes along
that doesn't. Oscar or no Oscar, three cheers for the ones that
don't.

   Saffron is the world's most expensive spice because of its
labor-intensive harvest. The flower of the Crocus sativus, a small
purple crocus that blooms in the fall, bears only three red-orange
stigmas, which must be hand picked and dried. It takes more than
14,000 of these tiny stigmas to produce 1 ounce of saffron.
Fortunately a little saffron goes a long way.
</P>
<P>
   Saffron was used by ancient civilizations in the eastern
Mediterranean, writes Jill Norman in ``The Complete Book of
Spices.'' The Romans and the Egyptians used it in food, wine, as a
clothing dye, in perfumes and as a drug. In the seventh century,
saffron was in demand in China for use as a drug and in perfume. In
the 10th century it was being grown in Spain, probably taken there
by the Arabs, Norman says. In the 11th century it reached Germany
and France; by the 14th century it was in England.
</P>
<P>
   Today the aromatic and pungent spice is used to flavor and color
food.
</P>
<P>
   WHAT: The red-orange stigmas from a small purple crocus.
</P>
<P>
   FORMS: Threads, ground
</P>
<P>
   LOOK FOR: Blood-red threads with very few yellow threads. A
brown color means the saffron has lost its potency. It should have
a rich aroma and be very lightweight.
</P>
<P>
   STORE: In an airtight container in a cool, dark, dry place for
up to six months.
</P>
<P>
   USE IN: Fish, poultry, pasta, potatoes, breads, risotto and rice
dishes. In Spain it is a key ingredient in paella. In Britain it is
used to make saffron cakes. Turmeric, safflower petals and marigold
petals can all be used as substitutes for saffron because they also
produce the yellow color, although they do not yield the same
taste.
</P>
<P>
   COST: Threads $5 per gram

A VIEW FROM THE TRENCHES
</HEADLINE>
  (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By DAVID KRONKE 
c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News 
<TEXT>
<P>
   William Goldman has won a couple of Oscars for his screenplays
(for ``Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid'' and ``All the
President's Men,'' to be specific), but if they handed out awards
for best anecdotes, he'd need a new trophy case. He's a raconteur
of the highest order, assembling his Hollywood horror stories into
a couple of eminently readable books: ``Adventures in the Screen
Trade'' and its sequel, the just-released ``Which Lie Did I Tell?''
</P>
<P>
   In the new book, he tells tales out of school (his take on Chevy
Chase working on ``Memoirs of an Invisible Man'' is priceless) and
offers an invaluable insight into screenwriters' minds by
submitting a script of his to some scribe pals, letting them rip
him to shreds and publishing the whole mess. His books are very
nearly as much fun as talking to him in person.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, he's perhaps best-known for his quintessential
Hollywood axiom, ``Nobody knows anything.'' Which makes him, to our
mind, the perfect guy to handicap Oscar.
</P>
<P>
   We sat down with Goldman in his publisher's office and asked him
about the Oscars, particularly the screenwriting categories. He
made but one flat declaration, for the best actor category: ``I'm
hoping for Denzel Washington, because I thought that was one of the
major pieces of acting I've seen in a very long time.'' He added,
``How did `Boys Don't Cry' get away with being relatively
inaccurate, how did
</P>
<P>
   `The Insider' get away with being relatively inaccurate, and why
did they hammer 'Hurricane'?''
</P>
<P>
   Before turning to his predictions, Goldman noted, ``Miramax
changes everything. I don't know what they do, I don't know how
they do it, I don't think they just out-buy everybody. I don't
understand; it's magical. Of the five movies that are up, what is
'Cider House Rules' doing there? What is it (BEGIN ITAL)doing (END
ITAL) there? Premiere magazine prints a list of 100 movies rated by
critics, smart critics _ I think 'Cider House Rules' was 43rd out
of 100. So I can't predict anything. If any (other studio) had
'Cider House Rules,' I would think 'American Beauty' would do very,
very well.''
</P>
<P>
   One last thing: Like everyone else, Goldman thinks most of these
films were too long. He quotes George Roy Hill, who directed
``Butch Cassidy'': ``If you can't tell your story in an hour and 50
minutes, you better be David Lean.''
</P>
<P>
   It's true, says Goldman. ``'The Insider' was terrific, but why
was it two hours and 40 minutes? 'Magnolia' was 11 hours and 'Green
Mile' was eight. Here's my theory _ 10 years ago, this (BEGIN
ITAL)actor(END ITAL) _ '' in Goldman's mouth, the word sounds like
the worst expletive _ ``makes a western and it's a disaster and it
costs a fortune; he's risked his career and everything. And it's a
huge hit, it's Kevin Costner's 'Dances With Wolves.' And I think
the other directors, none of them immune to (proving their manhood,
Freudian-wise), say, `If that (BEGIN ITAL)(expletive) actor(END
ITAL) can do that, don't tell me I can't tell my story in two hours
and 40 minutes.''
</P>
<P>
   That said, here's Goldman's take on the 10 best screenplay
nominees, which includes all the best picture nominees. &QL; 
!folo!Best original screenplay:
</P>
<P>
   ``American Beauty:'' ``Terrific screenplay,'' Goldman enthuses
of Alan Ball's suburban satire. ``I have troubles with some of the
things _ this is not the screenwriter. In the screenplay, Kevin
Spacey's character has sex with the teen girl. In the movie, he
says, 'Cease and desist; you're a virgin, child.' Well, that's (a
naughty word meaning 'unlikely'). I don't know whose fault it is,
but that damaged the movie for me. You don't have to change
anything, you show them embrace, you dissolve; they're embarrassed,
she leaves. The original script, which I thought was brilliant, the
kids go to jail for that. I loved that. I also have trouble with
the 18-year-old drug pusher as God _ 'Come, child, you and I will
go to New York, I have $40,000 tucked away.' But it's a terrific
movie; I don't want to sound that critical.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The Sixth Sense'': ``The one movie I have zero problem with is
'Sixth Sense,''' Goldman says of M. Night Shyamalan's supernatural
thriller. ``Solid, wonderful storytelling. And for me, the best
scene is not the ending, but the scene in the traffic jam toward
the end with the mother and the son where they talk about the
grandmother. That was just wonderful. But _ do you have any sense
of a great campaign for this movie?''
</P>
<P>
   ``Being John Malkovich'': ``I thought it was brilliant,'' the
writer says of Charlie Kaufman's Dada-esque comedy. ``It had two of
the great jokes of my life _ the seventh-and-a-half floor, and the
way people kept falling into New Jersey. I loved it! I felt, after
an hour, it got a little convoluted.'' Goldman adds that there were
three times he thought he was sitting through a near-perfect movie
this past year, only to have them go awry, to varying degrees,
after about an hour _ this one, ``Three Kings'' (which isn't even
nominated) and ``The Cider House Rules'' (its dropoff, he felt, was
most severe).
</P>
<P>
   ``Magnolia'': Writer-director Paul Thomas Anderson is ``a very
brilliant kid,'' Goldman believes. That said, his criticisms:
``There are three stories intertwined, and two are of old guys
dying of cancer? And the moment when everybody in the cast starts
singing, and poor Jason Robards is singing in his bed _ come on!
There's some wonderful stuff in there, but I wish he'd had a great
producer. ... When the frog slides down the windshield, I thought,
'What a dopey-looking frog!' Some of it, like the game show, that's
terrific stuff. He deserves all the success that he's had _ I just
hope his next movie is not four hours.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Topsy-Turvy'': ``I think Mike Leigh's really talented, and I
love Gilbert and Sullivan,'' Goldman says. That's the good news.
The bad: ``I wish all the critics who raved about 'Topsy-Turvy' got
on a desert island for the rest of their lives with only
'Tospy-Turvy' to watch.''
</P>
<P>
   His prediction: ``American Beauty.'' His preference: ``Beauty''
or ``Sixth Sense.'' &QL; 
!folo!Best adapted screenplay
</P>
<P>
   ``The Cider House Rule'': ``The first hour was wonderful, and
the second hour was not as wonderful,'' Goldman observes of John
Irving's adaptation of his own novel. ``I thought it was wonderful
when he was in the orphanage, and I thought it went off the cliff
when (Tobey Maguire's character) left the orphanage. I thought once
Michael Caine was gone, the interest was gone. But I wouldn't be
surprised if it won.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Election'': ``Fun _ liked (Reese Witherspoon); liked the
script; wished it had done more business,'' Goldman says of the
script by Alexander Payne and Jim Taylor. ``People point to all the
great movies, but I don't think anything has changed that much.
None of (the truly acclaimed films) did a lot of business _
'American Beauty's' the shock; it's a great success. But the other
movies didn't take off.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The Insider'': ``Solid work _ I didn't know why people didn't
want to go see it,'' Goldman says of Michael Mann and Eric Roth's
deconstruction of tobacco industry sleaze. ``You can sell it, and
Disney loved that picture and it's a quality film and Al Pacino's a
good selling tool and a brilliant actor, and they didn't want to
go. In all the years that I've been doing this, I (BEGIN
ITAL)never(END ITAL) ask myself, is this going to be a hit or a
flop, because I have no sense for it.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The Talented Mr. Ripley'': ``That's a wonderfully done
movie,'' says Goldman of writer-director Anthony Minghella's
follow-up to his Oscar winner ``The English Patient.'' ``I remember
the novel and the movie 'Purple Noon,' where Alain Delon, who was
the world's most beautiful human being, played Ripley. I would have
liked to have seen the movie with Matt Damon and Jude Law flipping
parts.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The Green Mile'': ``I was very moved with 'Green Mile,' but I
had a problem with the (framing sequence), which takes 20
minutes,'' he says. ``I cried at (writer-director Frank Darabont's)
screenplay. I read the book after and just thought some of those
moments hit me. Oh my God, when the (guard) kills the mouse, and
there's a great shot from behind that giant black hand saying,
'Bring me Mr. Jingles.' I just went.''
</P>
<P>
   His prediction: ``Cider House Rules.'' His preference:
``Insider'' or ``Green Mile.''
</P>
<P>
   And because he's just that kind of guy, Goldman offered a bonus
piece of prognostication for next year's race: ``I've read the 'Me
Myself and Irene' script (by Peter and Bobby Farrelly and starring
perennial snubbee Jim Carrey), and I think it's going to be bigger
than 'There's Something About Mary.''' &QL;

SOFTWARE MAKES IT EASIER TO TRACK ANCESTRY  
</HEADLINE>
   By LONNIE BROWN   
 The Ledger, Lakeland, Fla.   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   There's a new software program for genealogy _ the third most
popular hobby in the United States _ that's impressive in its size,
its depth and its weight.
</P>
<P>
   Yes, weight. Generations Family Tree Millennium Collection from
SierraHome tips the bathroom scales at a full 5 pounds, hefty by
any standards. It's part of the Generations series of genealogy
software from SierraHome.
</P>
<P>
   There are 21 CD-ROMs in the package _ another record in that
category for software that I've reviewed over the last 17 years.
They contain more than 200 years of records and resources with more
than 350 million names. There are links to more than 60,000
genealogy Web sites.
</P>
<P>
   ``More than 19 million Americans are actively tracing their
roots and it's becoming more important than ever to preserve this
precious family history for information for future generations,''
said Mark Winters, senior brand manager for Generations.
</P>
<P>
   SierraHome has timed the release of the software for April's
unveiling of the Immigrant Wall of Honor by the Ellis Island
Foundation. The wall honors the 12 million immigrants who went
through that port. More than 40 percent of all Americans can trace
an ancestor through Ellis Island, a SierraHome spokeswoman said.
</P>
<P>
   There are digital images of handwritten 1800 census data for the
ports of New York, Charleston and Philadelphia, along with an
extensive history of the Statue of Liberty and Ellis Island.
</P>
<P>
   A video, ``Remembering Ellis Island, Everyman's Monument,''
running for an hour, is also part of the package, as is the book,
``American Naturalization Records 1790-1900,'' which tells how to
use naturalization records in searches.
</P>
<P>
   The CDs also contain marriage and land records for the United
States from 1560 to 1907 and information on 19th century immigrant
ships.
</P>
<P>
   Registered users of the program get a free month's access to
Ancestry.com, which has more than 500 million records; a free name
search by a professional genealogist with access to 2 billion
names; a photo editing program for repairing and restoring family
photos; and flexible carting capabilities for making family trees
using drag-and-drop editing.
</P>
<P>
   The software is available for Windows with a shelf price of
around $65-$70.

   After a difficult delivery Angela Douglas learned that her baby

normal muscular reactions.
</P>
<P>
   He was one of a small percentage of newborns who become starved
for oxygen and are at risk to suffer brain damage and develop
neurological problems including cerebral palsy, mental retardation,

physicians can identify them in time.

   Lowering the infant's temperature by using a cooling cap for
approximately 72 hours seems to protect the delicate chemistry of
the developing brain.
</P>
<P>
   Cooling Angela Douglas's baby Jaydon seemed to work wonders. The
cascade of chemical reactions that can lead to brain damage
apparently stopped as the baby's temperature decreased a few
degrees. The cap that doctors put on his head was lined with tubes
circulating cool water. The experimental therapy is currently
undergoing clinical trials worldwide.
</P>
<P>
   ``It looked like a little cycling cap,'' says Angela. ``When
they took it off Jaydon on the fourth day, and warmed him back up,
he started taking breast milk almost right away. He gripped my
finger and looked right at us.''
</P>
<P>
   The dramatic improvement in baby Jaydon's reactions continued,
and one week later he had a brain scan that appeared normal.
</P>
<P>
   ``The cooling procedure helps reduce swelling,'' says Dr.
Marianne Thoresen of St. Michael's Hospital in Bristol, England.
``Placing a cap on the head cools the brain and the whole body.
When the brain lacks oxygen, nerve cells get damaged in a process
that lasts about three days. We think that cooling during this
period stops or reduces those processes.''
</P>
<P>
   Thoresen explains that the severity of oxygen starvation varies
a lot. ``We treat perhaps only 2 percent of newborns for oxygen
deprivation. It's a rare condition, but a devastating one because
babies may develop cerebral palsy, mental retardation, or epilepsy
later.''
</P>
<P>
   WARMING
</P>
<P>
   ``We haven't run into any big problems with the cooling
procedure itself,'' says Thoresen. ``And we're pleased that so many
of the babies have done quite well. But until we have more results
from clinical trials, we cannot say that the cooling cap definitely
works.''
</P>
<P>
   Complicating the issue is the fact that babies who have been
starved for oxygen frequently show numerous side effects and
require intensive care. They can have low blood pressure and other
complex problems later.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we warm the baby too fast, the baby's blood pressure may
drop,'' explains Thoresen. ``So we have to warm the baby very, very
slowly, not faster than a half a degree per hour. And we monitor
all the cardiovascular signs too.''
</P>
<P>
   MANY UNKNOWNS
</P>
<P>
   ``We're encouraged by the results we're seeing with the cooling
cap,'' says Dr. John Wyatt of University Hospital in London. ``I
hope this becomes a significant advance in treating babies in
danger of brain damage.''
</P>
<P>
   It's often impossible to predict which babies will have
difficulties at birth. ``In about half the cases, we don't know why
the baby lacks sufficient oxygen,'' says Thoresen. ``Sometimes the
umbilical cord can be wrapped around the neck, but that's not
usually the cause.''
</P>
<P>
   With oxygen-starved infants, it's critical that doctors
intervene to prevent brain damage within the first six hours after
birth. ``We think that temperature is extremely important during
that time,'' says Thoresen.
</P>
<P>
   Physicians used to think that injury from lack of oxygen
happened instantaneously. ``We now think brain damage takes more
time before it becomes permanent,'' says Wyatt. One of the real
challenges is identifying these babies immediately after birth so
we can intervene in time.''
</P>
<P>
   IDENTIFYING BABIES AT RISK
</P>
<P>
   No reliable tests were available to help sort out the vulnerable
infants from the large portion of babies who are not at risk. But a
new test may be on the horizon, as reported in the July 29, 1999
issue of The New England Journal of Medicine. Researchers
discovered that urinalysis can help indicate which babies suffer
the highest risk.
</P>
<P>
   Apparently oxygen-deprived babies, who are most likely to suffer
brain damage, have a higher ratio of certain metabolic products
called lactate and creatine in their urine. The new test may
provide a relatively simple way to identify oxygen-starved newborns
prone to brain injury.
</P>
<P>
   A large proportion of oxygen-starved babies do not grow up to
have cerebral palsy or other neurological disorders. But one in
every 1,000 infants begins life with such a severe struggle for
oxygen that he or she may lose critical brain functions that govern
movement, posture and intelligence. The British team says effective
interventions are needed that can save these infants from
irreversible brain injury and permanent disability.
</P>
<P>
   ``It will take about three years before doctors know for certain
whether the cooling cap makes a difference in the outcome for
oxygen starved infants,'' says Wyatt. ``We won't know for sure if
it's effective until the babies in the trials get older.''
</P>
<P>
   For Angela and her husband, the treatment couldn't have worked
out better. ``I don't think Jaydon would have made it if it wasn't
for the cooling cap,'' says Angela. ``He's just a miracle baby. He
didn't cry at all when he was born, which worried me terribly. Then
to see him four days later looking right at us, tightening his
fists, kicking his legs and crying, was just indescribable.''
</P>
<P>
   Wyatt explains that researchers will need to study 200 babies
worldwide who have suffered acute oxygen deprivation before they
can draw clear conclusions. ``Some of the babies will receive the
cooling cap and intensive care. The other babies will receive
standard intensive care without the cooling cap. That's the only
way we'll know for certain if this treatment works.''

TAIWAN'S PRESIDENT QUITS AS HEAD OF DEFEATED NATIONALIST PARTY 
</HEADLINE>
  (js) 
 By MARK LANDLER   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   TAIPEI, Taiwan _ Saying he must bear responsibility for the
Nationalist Party's crushing defeat in last weekend's presidential
elections, Taiwan's president, Lee Teng-hui, resigned Friday as
chairman of the party that has ruled this island for more than half
a century.
</P>
<P>
   Although Lee will remain president until May 20, when he is
succeeded by the opposition leader, Chen Shui-bian, his departure
as party boss greatly diminishes his power, effectively ending the
77-year-old politician's extraordinary career as the man who
brought democracy to Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
   In a brief valedictory speech to the Nationalist Party's top
officials Friday morning, Lee extolled that legacy, saying the
Nationalists had ``unshakable status'' as pioneers of democracy.
But he also acknowledged deep-rooted flaws in the party, which led
to its repudiation by voters.
</P>
<P>
   ``We must admit that because of the long history of this party,
there are long-running problems, which need to be eliminated,'' Lee
said. He did not elaborate, but added, ``This defeat is the right
time for the comrades of this party to do a full self-examination
and a total reform.''
</P>
<P>
   Lee flashed his trademark ear-to-ear grin as he entered the
Nationalist Party's imposing headquarters Friday morning. But it
was a humbling moment. Rolls of barbed wire still ringed the
building, after days of angry protests against him. Lee had
resisted calls for his departure, but he was drummed out by younger
members, who said his imperious style had contributed to the
party's downfall.
</P>
<P>
   The Nationalists named Lien Chan, their defeated presidential
candidate, as interim chairman. Lien promised to undertake a
wholesale reform of the party. The Nationalists now seem likely to
enter a turbulent period, in which younger leaders will battle
against the elders of Lee's generation for the soul of the party.
</P>
<P>
   ``The old KMT is dead,'' said Chen Li-luan, a Nationalist member
of Taiwan's legislature, who led the campaign against Lee. He used
the initials to refer to the Nationalist Party. ``We are trying to
resurrect it.''
</P>
<P>
   The Nationalist's internal struggle has profound implications
for Taiwan. Even without the presidency, the party remains a
ubiquitous presence here. It has a majority of seats in the
legislature, a vast grass-roots network and a business empire that
ranges from petrochemicals to media companies.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Some political analysts fear that these assets could be
liquidated or even plundered while the power struggle rages within
the party. Lien said Friday that he would press on with a plan to
place the properties in a trust, making them harder to
misappropriate.
</P>
<P>
   But that plan must await the passage of new laws by the
legislature. Chen's Democratic Progressive Party has said that it
wants to investigate the businesses and possibly seize those that
it determines were improperly confiscated by the Nationalists after
the party took control of Taiwan from Japan in 1945.
</P>
<P>
   ``To me, this is a political conspiracy,'' said Darby Liu, the
secretary-general of the party's business management committee.
``They want to kick us while we are down. Our contention is that
these properties are legally owned and registered. Why should we
give them back?''
</P>
<P>
   Lee kept firm control over the party's businesses through his
close ally, Liu Tai-yin, who was chairman of the committee that
controls the assets. But Liu also resigned Friday.
</P>
<P>
   For Lee, the resignation was a bittersweet end to a career in
which he had become the first native-born Taiwanese to run this
country. Trained as an agricultural economist at Cornell
University, Lee entered politics in 1972 as a Cabinet minister in
the regime of Chiang Kai-shek, who fled here from China with his
army in 1949 after being defeated by the Communists.
</P>
<P>
   Lee served as vice president under Chiang Kai-shek's son, Chiang
Ching-kuo, and became president when he died in 1988. Chiang
Ching-kuo had initiated Taiwan's move to democracy by lifting
martial law and legalizing opposition parties in 1987. Lee built on
that by instituting direct elections of the president; in 1996, he
became the first popularly elected leader of Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
   But while Lee opened the political system, he kept an iron grip
on the party. He dominated its weekly Wednesday meetings, setting
policies that were implemented when the Cabinet met the following
day. On some matters, he did not bother to consult anyone, such as
when he abruptly declared last July that Taiwan and China could
only negotiate on a ``state-to-state'' basis.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's the more controversial part of his legacy,'' said Ma
Ying-jeou, the 49-year-old mayor of Taipei, who is regarded as one
of the party's rising stars. ``The party should have democratized
long ago,'' he added. ``But we have a tradition of strong
leaders.''

&HT;     FAST-PACED `TITUS' IS NOT TO BE IGNORED 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By AMY BIANCOLLI  
 &HT;     c.2000 Albany Times Union  
<TEXT>
<P>
   To call ``Titus'' a visceral film isn't merely to call it raw,
or emotional, or as charged with madness and imagination as a
traveling freakshow. It's all those things and a few more
(``deranged'' springs to mind), but the word ``visceral'' has more
than a figurative meaning. It implies the presence of actual
viscera. Specifically, the slopping-full bowl of human intestines
that show up in the movie's first half-hour.
</P>
<P>
   Which is as good entree as any into the world of ``Titus,'' a
furious, bloody, overindulgent, overcooked, maniacally entertaining
Shakespeare adaptation (nee ``Titus Andronicus'') from the crowned
queen of Broadway, Julie Taymor (``The Lion King'').
</P>
<P>
   ``Titus'' is Taymor's first feature, and it makes a noisy debut
_ a movie to watch or walk out on, but never to ignore. A film in
which the main character pulls ersatz pen ink from the blood of his
own handless stump won't win any congeniality awards, but it
certainly leaves a vivid impression.
</P>
<P>
   The film concerns the downfall and crack-up of a victorious
Roman general, Titus Andronicus (Anthony Hopkins), who returns home
from battle with some rather fateful booty: the Goth queen Tamora
(Jessica Lange) and her three sons. When Titus orders the eldest
son slain, Tamora pleads for his life. Titus ignores her; entrails
ensue.
</P>
<P>
   The ramifications of this little act don't become clear until
later on, when Tamora marries the Roman Emperor (Alan Cumming) and
with her remaining sons (Matthew Rhys and Jonathan Rhys-Meyers)
plots revenge on the aging Titus and his issue. What kind of
revenge? Rape, decapitation, hands chopped off, a tongue ripped out
_ the usual. No one's eyes are gouged (though there are shades of
``King Lear''), but Titus' climactic retaliation does involve a bit
of creative cuisine that dares one to laugh and barf
simultaneously. (You will laugh. You'll hate yourself afterward and
shower obsessively for weeks, but you will laugh.)
</P>
<P>
   Many an academic row has been devoted to the matter of ``Titus
Andronicus,'' namely, whether it is a wretched, gruesome play
written by a young William Shakespeare or a wretched, gruesome play
written (in whole or in part) by someone posing as a young William
Shakespeare. It was in any case an out-of-the-park hit for Will,
who wowed Elizabethan crowds with scenes of decapitation,
dismemberment and disembowelment that might ring a bell for anyone
familiar with ``Mortal Kombat.''
</P>
<P>
   Which, if you can get past all the sticky red stuff, is kind of
the point. Taymor uses the film's opening scene _ in which a
cherubic young boy goes ballistic with action figures on a kitchen
table _ to establish up front her deconstructive spin on the
violence that follows, drawing obvious parallels between
exploitative gore in the Bard's time and exploitative gore today.
This Is Us, she's saying. She might be right and she might be wrong
(next time visiting heads of state are served meat pies made from
their grown children, drop me a line), but at least she's adamant.
She doesn't putz around.
</P>
<P>
   Fittingly, Taymor sets her adaptation in neither ancient Rome
nor a modern discotheque, but at the junction of both and
everything between: characters dressed in (Oscar-nominated)
glam-rock outfits and encrusted metal armor sashay around the
Colosseum, Mussolini's ueber-Rome and a subterranean-dungeon video
arcade. In a Jazz Age orgy scene, a brassy band honks away while
nekkid couples writhe and moan.
</P>
<P>
   To which the skeptical viewer protests: how absurd. And it is
absurd. It is absolutely, unapologetically, patently ludicrous. Yet
the film's very absurdity _ along with its Grand Guignol
grotesqueness _ give it its mojo, tossing moments of agonizing
tragedy and clownish humor into the same sick salad. The result is
one of the fastest 162-minute films on record, an erratic visual
feast that fascinates and nauseates in equal measure.
</P>
<P>
   Taymor gets plenty of help from her cast, who seem to understand
the inherent wackiness of the material and act accordingly.
Literary critic Michael Stapleton once claimed the play ``only
succeeds when the title role can be given to an actor who carries
enough guns to sink a battleship, like Laurence Olivier,'' and
Hopkins surely qualifies. Indeed, he seems consumed by the part to
the point of coming unhinged; his proud warrior's slide toward
insanity has touches of Hannibal Lecter, but Titus is a much
messier and more honestly human fellow.
</P>
<P>
   Prostrate with grief, weeping into the stones for two condemned
sons (``In summer's drought I'll drop upon thee still''), he's as
wounded and ravaged as he has ever appeared on screen.
</P>
<P>
   Lange, in her Shakespearean debut, pulls off a performance of
snarling She-mother muscularity. There's no way we're messing with
her. Cummings slinks around in his fascist-chic leather cape and
comes off as a dissolute feline. Laura Frasier (as Lavinia, Titus'
daughter) and Angus MacFadyan (as Lucius, one of his sons) provide
able support, but it's Harry Lennixas Aaron, Tamora's scheming
slave _ whose gravity, delivery and thunderous charisma herald the
break-out of a major talent. Watch this guy.
</P>
<P>
   And, if you can, watch ``Titus.'' You might walk out; you might
feel ill; you might write hate mail to the nearest available
critic. But this hideous tale of vengeful parents proves once again
that the elemental power of Shakespeare, even this Shakespeare,
lies in its malleability. Tap it, pummel it or pound it into
tissue, it's still gold. Even when Taymor wields the hammer.

<P>
   A new heart pager turns itself on at the first sign of trouble
and records irregular rhythms as they happen. Patients push a
button to transmit the data by phone to their doctor and the
receiving phone converts the data into an ECG, or wave pattern
reflecting the electrical activity of the heart.
</P>
<P>
   When 83-year-old George Welch suffered vague symptoms of
dizziness and shortness of breath, doctors thought he might have an
irregular heart beat, or arrhythmia. But they had no way of knowing
for sure.
</P>
<P>
   ``People can have symptoms one day and be perfectly fine for
weeks or months,'' says Dr. Dennis Leahy, a cardiologist with the
Escondido Cardiology Association in California. ``Then the symptoms
can occur again.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The worst time was when I went shopping in the grocery
store,'' says Welch. ``I stopped for about 10 seconds and felt like
I was going to pass out. I really thought I might be sailing off
into the great blue yonder.''
</P>
<P>
   Doctors diagnosed Welch's arrhythmia two weeks after he started
wearing the heart pager, which is also called a looping event
recorder. His irregular heart rhythms triggered the pager, which
began recording the patterns of electrical impulses traveling
through his heart. When his doctor received the data by phone, he
used it to diagnose Welch's arrhythmia and determine the best
treatment.
</P>
<P>
   SYMPTOMS COME AND GO
</P>
<P>
   ``It's really a challenge to try and catch a cardiac event that
is associated with sporadic symptoms,'' says Leahy. ``The event
recorder helps us determine what's causing the rhythm disturbance
so we can start appropriate treatment. In the worst of all worlds,
some of these rhythms can be associated with sudden death.''
</P>
<P>
   Most arrhythmias are treatable if properly diagnosed. Doctors
recommended a pacemaker for Welch, a small electronic device that
is implanted under the skin and generates electrical impulses to
improve the heart's rhythm.
</P>
<P>
   RECORDS CRITICAL EVENTS
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel fine now,'' Welch says. ``But when my heart stopped, I
thought it might be all over. I feel better knowing I have the
recorder on.''
</P>
<P>
   A signal on the heart pager lets the patient know when it's
starting to record. The patient can also activate the device if he
or she feels symptoms coming on. The pager monitors the heart
rhythm continuously, but only stores the patterns for several
minutes before and after it's activated.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are other causes of lightheadedness and dizziness,''
explains Leahy. ``Correlating the heart rhythms with the patient's
symptoms gives us valuable information. It's useful in ruling out
heart problems as well as pinpointing them.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The device will freeze a segment of the heart patterns right
before it's activated and for several minutes after,'' explains
Kathleen Brooks of Alaris Medical Systems, which manufactures the
pager device. ``It allows the physician to see exactly what the
heart is doing at the time the symptoms occur.''
</P>
<P>
   ARRHYTHMIAS
</P>
<P>
   Many arrhythmias go unnoticed, but they can be extremely
serious. People with heart disease have a higher risk of suffering
arrhythmias, but irregular rhythms can effect people with normal
hearts too. Healthy individuals may suffer arrhythmias from
caffeine, smoking, drugs, alcohol or stress.
</P>
<P>
   ``An arrhythmia can manifest as the heart speeding up, skipping
beats or going too slow,'' says Leahy. ``People can have symptoms
like palpitations, shortness of breath or lightheadedness because
the heart isn't pumping blood around the body effectively.''
</P>
<P>
   When a 69-year old woman blacked out while wearing the device,
the recording allowed doctors to diagnose her specific kind of
arrhythmia.
</P>
<P>
   ``Her heart rate went from normal, which is about 70 beats per
minute, to about 30 beats a minute,'' explained Leahy. ``That's
serious enough to cause lightheadedness or loss of consciousness.''
</P>
<P>
   The American Heart Association offers a quiz to help people
determine if they have any of the risk factors for heart problems.
Some of the risk factors include advancing age, (45 years for men
and 50 years for women,) heredity, high blood pressure, cigarette
smoking, high blood cholesterol, obesity, diabetes, a type A
personality, stress and a sedentary lifestyle.
</P>
<P>
   ``Patients attach several electrodes to their skin while wearing
the lightweight recording device,'' says Leahy. ``It gives us the
ability to monitor the patient for up to a month at a time. I would
say 30 to 40 percent of the event recorders we give patients yield
valuable information. The recorder also helps us monitor patients
with pacemakers and medications that slow the heart rhythm.''

&HT;     `WHATEVER IT TAKES': DATED ON ARRIVAL 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By WESLEY MORRIS  
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``Whatever It Takes'' is some kind of quaint high-school
comedy/teen romance when a kid actually uses ``smells like teen
spirit'' to describe the vibe at a party. Then, later, the Moby jam
on the soundtrack is shut off so a boy can eke out a version of
``I'll Melt With You'' on his accordion for his girl. Hey, it
brought a tear to her eye, and it might bring one to yours, too.
</P>
<P>
   This is purely a matter of personal taste. At the same party,
Grace Jones' ``Pull Up to the Bumper'' is the 18-year-old tune that
has all the tail feathers shaking. And that was fun. But I spent 99
minutes with ``Whatever'' and not one character materialized who
might have been responsible for spinning that record.
</P>
<P>
   No one goes into these movies sniffing around for realism per
se, but in theory this movie's sense of nostalgia would add 15 to
20 years onto these kids. (Coincidentally, that's about how far
apart in age director David Raynr and writer Mark Schwahn are from
the interchangeable stars in their movie.)
</P>
<P>
   ``Whatever It Takes'' is DOA _ dated on arrival. It serves as a
platform for its filmmakers to use shallow teen-agers to reflect
their own tastes. Accordion boy's name is Ryan (Shane West), and in
one of the film's more humiliating moments, he reveals his secret
joy _ his accordion _ while ``Play That Funky Music'' mocks him in
the background. Like friends or co-workers whose fashion sense and
pop sensibilities practically carbon-date them, ``Whatever'' joins
the roster of recent musty, moral-slinging co-conspirators in
teensploitation. (There's a reason none of these flicks has set a
lifestyle trend: They're hung up on trends set over a decade ago.)
</P>
<P>
   And like ``10 Things I Hate About You'' and ``She's All That,''
this one needs a previously existing text to justify its existence
_ as if every day of high school weren't already ``Taming of the
Shrew,'' ``Pygmalion'' or (in ``Whatever's'' case) ``Cyrano de
Bergerac.''
</P>
<P>
   Ryan thinks he wants to be with the school ditz, Ashley (Jodi
Lyn O'Keefe). Meanwhile, Chris (James Franco), the school player,
wants to get next to Maggie (Marla Sokoloff), who happens to be
best friends with Ryan. Chris agrees to put Ryan on with Ashley,
provided Ryan do the same for Chris with Maggie. Makeovers and a
prom ensue.
</P>
<P>
   The signature ``Cyrano'' impersonation/seduction employs call
waiting. It feels so tampered with that the spontaneity is snuffed
out by arrhythmic cutting. But when a movie's title sequence
features makeup and hair accessories dancing in stop-motion,
there's no mystery where, if anyplace, it's taking you.
</P>
<P>
   ``Whatever'' begins by showing us what it takes for a girl to
get pretty enough to go to fourth-period chemistry. It ends by
telling us that chemistry doesn't matter if you can see into the
bedroom of the girl you love. And throughout, the movie insists
that the way to a high school senior girl's heart in 2000 is by
loving ``Casablanca'' and old Cheap Trick.

   At some point, Maggie starts hanging out with the vapid popular
girls, and Sokoloff wears that priceless look of demoralized horror
Lorraine Bracco had when she sees her fellow mob wives for the
first time in ``GoodFellas.'' It's an out-of-body moment: She knows
she's in a time warp, her life flashing before her eyes. Then she
snaps out of it, wearing the stung look of a girl who's just popped
a pimple.

 &HT;    CLINTON FINDS SIGHTS, PEOPLE OF INDIA 'IMMENSELY IMPRESSIVE'
 &HT;    (425&AMP;ADDS)
 &HT;    With INDIA-CLINTON-0324.

<P>
   BOMBAY, India _ He's stood in the great legislative cathedral of
the world's most populous democracy and felt his heart quicken at
the site of a tiger in the wild.
</P>
<P>
   He's glimpsed the high-tech future of one of the world's oldest
civilizations and wandered the ruins of its distant past.
</P>
<P>
   In the end, though, it has been India's people that have moved
and inspired the world's most powerful man.
</P>
<P>
   ``For all of its difficulties,'' said President Clinton, who
leaves India Saturday after a week-long visit, ``this is an
immensely impressive country.''
</P>
<P>
   It's impossible, certainly, to embrace the complexity and the
contrasts, the poverty and the promise, of this vast and ancient
land in any single journey, much less in a tour of only five days.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's passage through India, moreover, has been a carefully
scripted drama seen largely from Air Force One, presidential
helicopters, bilateral meetings and speeding motorcades.
</P>
<P>
   Secret Service agents have done their best to keep the
presidential magic carpet from being soiled with the dust of
antiquity choking much of the rest of the country.
</P>
<P>
   He's slept in five-star hotel suites where the nightly rate is
three times what the average Indian makes in a year.
</P>
<P>
   And his political advisers have been so finicky that Clinton
couldn't even take a hoped-for elephant ride at the 16th Century
Amber Fort in Jaipur, lest photographers capture him astride the
symbol of his Republican foes.
</P>
<P>
   And yet, rays of India managed to filter through the screen,
reflected in the eyes of its people.
</P>
<P>
   Standing at the black granite bier marking the spot where
Mahatma Gandhi was cremated in 1948, Clinton ruminated on the
impact that the father of Indian independence and the apostle of
non-violent civil disobedience had on the American South, where
Clinton was raised, and the civil rights movement that helped shape
his political career, even as it changed the face of his nation.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was thinking about Gandhi's life,'' he later told reporters,
``how he completely gave his life over to what he believed, and
how, if all of us just had one fraction of that commitment, we
could make peace in the world.''
</P>
<P>
   Speaking to a group of more than 1,000 executives at a high-tech
industrial park in Hyderabad, Clinton spoke to the irony of India's
exploding computer sector amid the continuing trauma of its
enduring poverty.
</P>
<P>
   ``Millions of Indians are connected to the Internet, but
millions more aren't yet connected to fresh water,'' Clinton said.
``Our challenge is to turn the newest discoveries into the best
weapons humanity has ever had to fight poverty.''
</P>
<P>
   (EDs: Begin optional trim.)
</P>
<P>
   Meeting with women at an innovative dairy co-op in the village
of Nayla, an impoverished hamlet at the edge of the great Thar
desert in the fabled state of Rajasthan, Clinton was taken by the
quiet dignity and fulsome pride summoned by some of the world's
poorest women, made rich by a belief that they might change the
world for themselves and their families, one warm and creamy gallon
at a time.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was an edge to those women,'' Clinton later said. ``They
had something, it was special. They knew they'd done something.''
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday Clinton addressed the Indian Parliament, seat of
the officials privileged to be elected by the most populous
democracy in the history of the world, a body politic of 620
million eligible voters
</P>
<P>
   And the next day, before touring the Ranthambhore Tiger
Preserve, he paid tribute to the grandeur of local government by
the people, dropping in on a village council. One member asked
Clinton whether he found India to be a backward country.
</P>
<P>
   ``No,'' came Clinton's reply.
</P>
<P>
   (EDs: Story can end here. Optional add follows.)
</P>
<P>
   ``But what I hope my trip will do is to help people all over the
world see India in a more complete way,'' he said. ``There are many
people here who are poor, but you are proving that democracy can be
used to lift the poor.''
</P>
<P>
   Then Clinton, who has devoted much of his nation's treasure and
prestige to fighting the fruits of ancient prejudice and modern
hatred around much of the world, told the villagers, and all of
India, what he's learned from them.
</P>
<P>
   ``If in India you can prove that people can lift themselves from
poverty, and, at the same time, end discrimination against women
and their girl children, and learn to work together across tribal
and caste lines because of democracy, you will give the world the
greatest gift it could have now.''

&HT;     GAY COUPLES DEFY CALIFORNIA'S MARRIAGE BAN WITH UNITY
CEREMONY 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By ILENE LELCHUK  
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ As 88 gay and lesbian couples held hands inside
San Francisco City Hall and pledged their love to each other, an
unusual protest _ even for this city _ took place in the plaza
outside.
</P>
<P>
   No, it was the religious conservatives who angrily demonstrated
at last year's same-sex commitment ceremony officiated by Mayor
Willie Brown and other politicians.
</P>
<P>
   The fourth ceremony Thursday attracted Californians for Same Sex
Marriages, a small group that held signs bearing slogans like
``Marry Me!'' and gathered signatures on a petition to put a
measure on November's state ballot that would legalize marriages
between homosexuals and lesbians.
</P>
<P>
   ``Talk about how far we've come,'' said a surprised Supervisor
Leslie Katz, who helped officiate the ceremony inside.
</P>
<P>
   Yet still not far enough, according to the demonstrators outside
and many couples inside, who are frustrated by the passage on March
7 of the ballot initiative banning marriage between same-sex
couples.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, some couples said the passage of Proposition 22, which
defined marriage as only between a man and a woman, motivated them
to defiantly and proudly participate in Thursday's ceremony.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's been just one disappointment after another,'' said
Richard Gibson, 54, of San Francisco, adding that he hoped that in
his lifetime there would be a law approving same-sex unions.
</P>
<P>
   Gibson exchanged vows with his boyfriend of five years, Paul
Porcher, 46, who popped the question to Gibson while they were
watching the movie ``Runaway Bride.'' The couple wore matching
green coats with white rose buds in their lapels for the ceremony.
</P>
<P>
   ``For me the public affirmation is important,'' Porcher said.
</P>
<P>
   With Mayor Brown's instruction to ``say it loudly and proudly,''
Porcher, Gibson and the other couples said their vows together.
</P>
<P>
   ``I do willingly take you to be my lifetime partner to love and
cherish forever,'' Brown said, leading the pledge.
</P>
<P>
   Celebrating with the crowd was state Assemblywoman Carole
Migden, a San Francisco Democrat who launched the city's first
commitment ceremony in 1996 and helped create a new state registry
for domestic partners.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are happy to bless our San Francisco families and we are
here to perform real marriage ceremonies and illustrate to America
that lesbians and gays are committed to each other,'' Migden said.
``We will have marriage and families and (we will) self-define them
and have them fortified and prevail. We will have them respected
and recognized everywhere.''
</P>
<P>
   So far, the new century has held many ups and downs for
homosexuals and lesbians. Just three weeks after Proposition 22
passed in California, the Vermont House approved ``civil unions''
that offer them many of the benefits and responsibilities of
heterosexual marriages.
</P>
<P>
   Some domestic partners in San Francisco already can receive
similar rights, including health care, if they register with the
city. Domestic partners who work for the city benefit, and at least
one other major employer here, United Airlines, adopted a similar
policy.
</P>
<P>
   Carolin Forks, 36, and Lori Augustine, 30, of San Bruno work for
United and plan to register with the city soon to qualify for the
shared benefits. But that is not the main reason they participated
in Thursday' ceremony, Augustine said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The main reason is we love each other,'' she said.

<TEXT>
<P>
   Ireneo Funes _ ``Funes the Memorious'' _ is perhaps the most
memorable character in the remarkable fiction of the late, great
Argentine essayist Jorge Luis Borges.
</P>
<P>
   Hit on the head in a riding accident, the teen-age Funes has
perfect recall. Far from conferring on him the attributes of a
superman, Funes is literally crippled by memory. Because he recalls
everything in perfect detail, he is unable to sort memories into
categories.
</P>
<P>
   For example, Funes cannot conceive of the abstract category
``dog'' into which he could slot his neighbor's beagle or the
Labrador down the road. Each instance of memory becomes a category
to itself. Funes' memory curses him with a syntax-free view of the
world. So rich in detail, it is effectively meaningless.
</P>
<P>
   Martin Nowak of the Institute for Advanced Study in Princeton,
N.J., and his colleagues have found that the invention of syntax
allowed us to evolve a complex language. Human language is
syntactical in that it is made of discrete segments, arranged in
particular ways to make meaningful sentences.
</P>
<P>
   Animal communication, Nowak says, is believed to be
nonsyntactical. Each utterance _ or word _ refers to a specific
event. For example, ``Lhooq!'' might mean ``Watch out! There is a
green-eyed yellow jaguar slinking around in the dappled shade
underneath the jacaranda tree across the stream!''
</P>
<P>
   Funes' world was nonsyntactical. He needed a separate way of
describing a Labrador from a beagle, and separate words for
describing beagles seen at dawn rather than dusk, or beagles seen
sideways, upside down, while barking. He was incapable of referring
each example to an abstract category _ ``dog'' _ for all occasions,
that could then be suitably modified by separate, abstract parts of
speech such as adjectives and verbs.
</P>
<P>
   Human language, on the other hand, is clearly syntactic. Rather
than summarizing events or scenarios into single words, each of
which must be memorized separately, we memorize the individual
operators _ nouns, verbs and so on _ that make up scenarios. We
then use grammatical rules to combine these separate elements into
meaningful sentences. This creates two distinct advantages, and one
disadvantage.
</P>
<P>
   First, nonsyntactical language does not travel well. In a
nonsyntactical society, it would be hard to explain the meaning of
'Lhooq!' to somebody who wasn't there at the time. But abstract
categories such as ``jaguar'' and ``slinking'' can be learned
separately, without direct experience of the object referred.
</P>
<P>
   Second, the modular nature of syntactical language means that
people can shuffle words to create entirely imaginary, synthetic
experiences _ summarizing concepts that have never been directly
experienced. Syntactical language is therefore much more flexible
than nonsyntactical forms of communication.
</P>
<P>
   Nonsyntactical language is bound by new experience. In the
sentence above about jaguars and jacarandas, it is easy to
substitute alligator for jaguar if the species of predator happens
to vary. But in nonsyntactical language, this would mean creating
an entirely new word, different from 'Lhooq!'
</P>
<P>
   The disadvantage of syntax is that it implies grammar _ rules
for arranging words. These rules must be learned, because not every
arrangement makes sense.
</P>
<P>
   Nowak discusses the relative merits of syntactical and
nonsyntactical language by building a mathematical model in which
the advantages and disadvantages of the two forms of communication
are expressed in terms of equations. The model reveals that the
advantages of syntactical communication are clear, but only become
evident in situations in which the need to describe complex events
outweighs the significant cost of learning abstract words and
grammatical rules for creating sentences.
</P>
<P>
   In other words, our ancestors only invented language in the
sense we understand it today once they found themselves in
interesting, varied environments in which flexible, modular
communication had advantages for survival. &QL;

<P>
   ``Every day you play with the light of the universe'', said
Chilean poet Pablo Neruda. And there is plenty of light to play
with.
</P>
<P>
   As well as visible starlight (of which sunlight is a nearby
representative), the sky glows with radiation that we cannot see:
radio waves, microwaves, ultraviolet, X-rays and gamma rays. All of
it is produced by the astrophysical objects _ galaxies of stars,
gas clouds, black holes _ that pepper empty space. But sorting
through all of these sources is difficult and tedious.
</P>
<P>
   Now a team of U.S. astronomers has sifted through one of the
most interesting parts of the spectrum of the universe, the X-ray
region, to show where it comes from.
</P>
<P>
   X-rays bombard the Earth from all directions. X-rays are
extremely high-frequency radiation and carry a lot of energy. But
they are strongly absorbed in the upper atmosphere, and so do not
reach the ground. This is fortunate for life on Earth, as X-rays
are potentially damaging to living organisms. But it is a problem
for astronomers. It means that cosmic X-ray sources can only be
studied by orbiting satellites.
</P>
<P>
   Since the launch of the first satellite dedicated to X-ray
astronomy in 1970, their study has been a rich source of
information. In 1988, the French astronomer Jean-Pierre Luminet
said, ``High-energy astrophysics is arguably the branch of
astronomy that has most advanced our understanding of the universe
over the past 25 years.''
</P>
<P>
   Cosmic X-rays are produced in very extreme environments. Objects
emit radiation of increasing frequency as they get hotter, which is
why a filament goes from red-hot to blue-hot when it heats up. But
to emit X-rays, such an object must have a temperature of millions
of degrees.
</P>
<P>
   When the background of cosmic X-rays was first discovered, some
suggested that it might be produced by a diffuse but tremendously
hot gas lodged between galaxies in all directions. During the
1990s, however, it became clear that the cosmic X-ray background is
the product of many individual point-like sources in the sky.
</P>
<P>
   Hellish things are happening in these places. Black holes or
dense neutron stars are pulling matter apart. Some galaxies seem to
have very energetic events at their core (called active galactic
nuclei or AGN), where a huge, central black hole is thought to be
sucking up stars. But until now it has not been possible to match
the measured background ''spectrum'' of X-rays _ the way their
intensity varies with their frequency _ with the spectra of known
X-ray sources such as galactic nuclei.
</P>
<P>
   Len Cowie of the University of Hawaii and his co-workers have
helped to resolve much of the mystery of where the X-ray background
comes from. They have analyzed data from the Chandra satellite
launched last year, largely to investigate this question.
</P>
<P>
   The group has focused on the highest-energy _ the ``hard'' _
X-rays. At ``softer'' energies, much of the cosmic X-ray background
has already been resolved into individual sources such as galactic
nuclei, but the emission of hard X-rays from these sources doesn't
match that found in the background spectrum.
</P>
<P>
   To identify the X-ray sources, the researchers used the Chandra
data to pinpoint where the X-rays are coming from, and then used
ground-based optical telescopes (which measure visible light) to
detect astrophysical objects such as distant galaxies at those
points.
</P>
<P>
   They studied the Chandra results from a region of the sky
already thoroughly combed by optical astronomy, so that any
``candidate'' sources of X-rays would already have been seen. They
have thus found sources accounting for three-quarters of the hard
X-ray background in this part of the sky. These, say the
researchers, include ``a rich assortment of hard X-ray sources
which could not have been discovered by previous satellites.''
</P>
<P>
   Some are quasars. Others look like normal galaxies. And some are
so faint that it is hard to know exactly what they are. These faint
objects may be extremely distant quasars, formed very early in the
history of the universe. If so, they are some of the most remote
and oldest objects ever seen by astronomers, and could contain
X-ray-generating black holes formed in a different way from those
in closer, more recent galactic nuclei. &QL;

NEANDERTHAL DNA CONFIRMS DISTINCT HISTORY  
 FOR RELEASE: THU., MARCH 30, 2000
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   Recently, William Goodwin of the University of Glasgow,
Scotland, described DNA from the bones of a Neanderthal infant
found in a cave in the northern Caucasus mountains of southern
Russia.
</P>
<P>
   This is only the second reported example of Neanderthal DNA.
</P>
<P>
   The first, from Munich-based ancient-DNA pioneer Svante Paabo
and his colleagues, described DNA extracted from the bones of the
first ever Neanderthal to be discovered, the historic ``Feldhofer''
Neanderthal, found in Germany in 1856. That benchmark study was
published in the journal Cell in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   The new data are arguably even more important for two reasons.
</P>
<P>
   The new study vindicates the Cell report. Although researchers
agree that the earlier work was first-rate, the study of ancient
DNA has been dogged by worries of contamination _ especially when
DNA comes from creatures closely related to ourselves. The new data
also support the widely held but still contentious view that modern
humans had little or no genetic admixture with the Neanderthals.
</P>
<P>
   According to the ``multiregional continuity'' model of human
origins, modern humans developed in several parts of the world
simultaneously, with people in each area having their own regional
antecedents. Neanderthals lived in Europe and western Asia from
around 230,000 years ago until sometime after 30,000 years ago. The
Caucasus Neanderthal is one of the last known of its kind.
</P>
<P>
   Modern humans, anatomically distinct from Neanderthals, first
appeared in Europe around 40,000 years ago. In the multiregional
continuity view, modern Europeans were descendants of indigenous
Neanderthals, or at least had considerable genetic admixture. This
would not be true, however, for modern humans evolving in other
parts of the world, such as Africa or eastern Asia.
</P>
<P>
   In the competing ``out of Africa'' view, modern humans migrated
from Africa to other parts of the world around 100,000 years ago
and replaced indigenous forms. In this scheme, Neanderthals would
have become extinct, leaving no modern descendants anywhere in the
world, including Europe.
</P>
<P>
   If the multiregional continuity view is correct, then
Neanderthal DNA should resemble that of modern Europeans more than
the DNA of modern Asians or Africans. But the Feldhofer Neanderthal
DNA seems to be distinct from the DNA of any modern human,
irrespective of racial or geographical origin.
</P>
<P>
   The Caucasus Neanderthal DNA now confirms this: It is closer to
the Feldhofer DNA than to any modern human. This evidence neither
refutes nor supports the multiregional continuity theory.
</P>
<P>
   But the Caucasus DNA and the Feldhofer DNA are quite distinct,
having a 3.48 percent difference in sequence. This is comparable to
differences between humans of different ethnic or geographic
origins. It is not surprising given that the Feldhofer and Caucasus
individuals lived 2,500 kilometers and tens of thousands of years
apart.
</P>
<P>
   The research is a beacon of hope for studies of our closest
extinct relative. Neither the Caucasus nor the Feldhofer remains
were preserved in ideal conditions for the retrieval of delicate
DNA that is tens of thousands of years old.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike Siberian mammoths or the Tyrollean iceman, they were not
frozen in the permafrost of a glacier. This suggests that more DNA
from Neanderthal specimens _ even the most ancient remains _ might
be extracted to give a snapshot of the evolution of a complete
species from start to finish. &QL;

<P>
   Researchers in India may have come up with a new way of
predicting when explosives might lose their fizz. Medical imaging,
it seems, could reveal an explosive's shelf life and sensitivity.
</P>
<P>
   Bubbles or ``void spaces'' collapse under the high-pressure
shock waves of an explosion. Compression instantly forces up bubble
temperature and ignites the surrounding material. More and more
bubbles get converted into these hotspots as shock waves rush
through a detonating explosive.
</P>
<P>
   ``The size and the number of bubbles is half the science of
making emulsion explosives,'' says Jack Hedger, technical officer
of the United Kingdom's Institute of Explosives Engineers. Only
bubbles below a certain size produce enough heat to drive an
explosion forward, he adds.
</P>
<P>
   Explosives are given void spaces by filling them with porous
solid bits. Tiny glass balloons, mineral particles and even pieces
of corn all put crushable air pockets into the liquid. From the
size and number of these additions, manufacturers can calculate how
many void spaces, on average, a liquid explosive contains. This
figure gives a guide to what should happen when the plunger is
pressed.
</P>
<P>
   Mixing air and other gases into the explosive while blending the
emulsion is a cheaper alternative, but one that makes bubble
content difficult to regulate and quantify. Liquid density gives no
clues to void size and peering down a microscope is unreliable as
bubbles move around in the sloppy slurry.
</P>
<P>
   Promising images of gas bubbles mixed into emulsion explosives
can be produced with a technique called nuclear magnetic resonance,
according to P.K. Ghosh and his colleagues at the ICI India R&AMP;T
Center in Thane, India.
</P>
<P>
   Magnetic resonance is used widely in medicine (under the
pseudonym medical resonance imaging or MRI) to map blood flow
around the body, and the brain in particular. It identifies the
distinctive magnetic fields around the nuclei of most atoms.
</P>
<P>
   The technique offers a way to check the bubble quality of
emulsion explosives that ``was hitherto not possible due to
nonavailability of noninvasive techniques for void measurements,''
the group reported.
</P>
<P>
   Ghosh and his colleagues used magnetic resonance to probe
samples of a water-in-oil concentrated emulsion explosive. Each
sample was divided into a grid of over 16,000 squares, which were
checked for signals or ''echoes.''
</P>
<P>
   The strongest signals correspond to the explosive ingredients:
water, ammonia and paraffin oil. Void spaces do not produce signals
and so show up as holes.
</P>
<P>
   The pictures that Ghosh's group obtained are not perfect but
they do reveal bubbles, like a blurred black and white photograph
of Swiss cheese. Better picture resolution will help measure bubble
size, the team said.
</P>
<P>
   Magnetic resonance imaging can only work with very small samples
of explosive. The technique will have to be improved before it can
analyze the cartridges of explosives used in mines. And, because
bubbles merge and expand over time until they are too flabby to go
out with a bang, it could help determine a ''best before'' date for
explosives. &QL;

<P>
   Ireneo Funes _ ``Funes the Memorious'' _ is perhaps the most
memorable character in the remarkable fiction of the late, great
Argentine essayist Jorge Luis Borges.
</P>
<P>
   Hit on the head in a riding accident, the teen-age Funes has
perfect recall. Far from conferring on him the attributes of a
superman, Funes is literally crippled by memory. Because he recalls
everything in perfect detail, he is unable to sort memories into
categories.
</P>
<P>
   For example, Funes cannot conceive of the abstract category
``dog'' into which he could slot his neighbor's beagle or the
Labrador down the road. Each instance of memory becomes a category
to itself. Funes' memory curses him with a syntax-free view of the
world. So rich in detail, it is effectively meaningless.
</P>
<P>
   Martin Nowak of the Institute for Advanced Study in Princeton,
N.J., and his colleagues have found that the invention of syntax
allowed us to evolve a complex language. Human language is
syntactical in that it is made of discrete segments, arranged in
particular ways to make meaningful sentences.
</P>
<P>
   Animal communication, Nowak says, is believed to be
nonsyntactical. Each utterance _ or word _ refers to a specific
event. For example, ``Lhooq!'' might mean ``Watch out! There is a
green-eyed yellow jaguar slinking around in the dappled shade
underneath the jacaranda tree across the stream!''
</P>
<P>
   Funes' world was nonsyntactical. He needed a separate way of
describing a Labrador from a beagle, and separate words for
describing beagles seen at dawn rather than dusk, or beagles seen
sideways, upside down, while barking. He was incapable of referring
each example to an abstract category _ ``dog'' _ for all occasions,
that could then be suitably modified by separate, abstract parts of
speech such as adjectives and verbs.
</P>
<P>
   Human language, on the other hand, is clearly syntactic. Rather
than summarizing events or scenarios into single words, each of
which must be memorized separately, we memorize the individual
operators _ nouns, verbs and so on _ that make up scenarios. We
then use grammatical rules to combine these separate elements into
meaningful sentences. This creates two distinct advantages, and one
disadvantage.
</P>
<P>
   First, nonsyntactical language does not travel well. In a
nonsyntactical society, it would be hard to explain the meaning of
'Lhooq!' to somebody who wasn't there at the time. But abstract
categories such as ``jaguar'' and ``slinking'' can be learned
separately, without direct experience of the object referred.
</P>
<P>
   Second, the modular nature of syntactical language means that
people can shuffle words to create entirely imaginary, synthetic
experiences _ summarizing concepts that have never been directly
experienced. Syntactical language is therefore much more flexible
than nonsyntactical forms of communication.
</P>
<P>
   Nonsyntactical language is bound by new experience. In the
sentence above about jaguars and jacarandas, it is easy to
substitute alligator for jaguar if the species of predator happens
to vary. But in nonsyntactical language, this would mean creating
an entirely new word, different from 'Lhooq!'
</P>
<P>
   The disadvantage of syntax is that it implies grammar _ rules
for arranging words. These rules must be learned, because not every
arrangement makes sense.
</P>
<P>
   Nowak discusses the relative merits of syntactical and
nonsyntactical language by building a mathematical model in which
the advantages and disadvantages of the two forms of communication
are expressed in terms of equations. The model reveals that the
advantages of syntactical communication are clear, but only become
evident in situations in which the need to describe complex events
outweighs the significant cost of learning abstract words and
grammatical rules for creating sentences.
</P>
<P>
   In other words, our ancestors only invented language in the
sense we understand it today once they found themselves in
interesting, varied environments in which flexible, modular
communication had advantages for survival. &QL;

researchers, include ``a rich assortment of hard X-ray sources
which could not have been discovered by previous satellites.''
</P>
<P>
   Some are quasars. Others look like normal galaxies. And some are
so faint that it is hard to know exactly what they are. These faint
objects may be extremely distant quasars, formed very early in the
history of the universe. If so, they are some of the most remote
and oldest objects ever seen by astronomers, and could contain
X-ray-generating black holes formed in a different way from those
in closer, more recent galactic nuclei. &QL;

NEANDERTHAL DNA CONFIRMS DISTINCT HISTORY

<TEXT>
<P>
   Recently, William Goodwin of the University of Glasgow,
Scotland, described DNA from the bones of a Neanderthal infant
found in a cave in the northern Caucasus mountains of southern
Russia.
</P>
<P>
   This is only the second reported example of Neanderthal DNA.
</P>
<P>
   The first, from Munich-based ancient-DNA pioneer Svante Paabo
and his colleagues, described DNA extracted from the bones of the
first ever Neanderthal to be discovered, the historic ``Feldhofer''
Neanderthal, found in Germany in 1856. That benchmark study was
published in the journal Cell in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   The new data are arguably even more important for two reasons.
</P>
<P>
   The new study vindicates the Cell report. Although researchers
agree that the earlier work was first-rate, the study of ancient
DNA has been dogged by worries of contamination _ especially when
DNA comes from creatures closely related to ourselves. The new data
also support the widely held but still contentious view that modern
humans had little or no genetic admixture with the Neanderthals.
</P>
<P>
   According to the ``multiregional continuity'' model of human
origins, modern humans developed in several parts of the world
simultaneously, with people in each area having their own regional
antecedents. Neanderthals lived in Europe and western Asia from
around 230,000 years ago until sometime after 30,000 years ago. The
Caucasus Neanderthal is one of the last known of its kind.
</P>
<P>
   Modern humans, anatomically distinct from Neanderthals, first
appeared in Europe around 40,000 years ago. In the multiregional
continuity view, modern Europeans were descendants of indigenous
Neanderthals, or at least had considerable genetic admixture. This
would not be true, however, for modern humans evolving in other
parts of the world, such as Africa or eastern Asia.
</P>
<P>
   In the competing ``out of Africa'' view, modern humans migrated
from Africa to other parts of the world around 100,000 years ago
and replaced indigenous forms. In this scheme, Neanderthals would
have become extinct, leaving no modern descendants anywhere in the
world, including Europe.
</P>
<P>
   If the multiregional continuity view is correct, then
Neanderthal DNA should resemble that of modern Europeans more than
the DNA of modern Asians or Africans. But the Feldhofer Neanderthal
DNA seems to be distinct from the DNA of any modern human,
irrespective of racial or geographical origin.
</P>
<P>
   The Caucasus Neanderthal DNA now confirms this: It is closer to
the Feldhofer DNA than to any modern human. This evidence neither
refutes nor supports the multiregional continuity theory.
</P>
<P>
   But the Caucasus DNA and the Feldhofer DNA are quite distinct,
having a 3.48 percent difference in sequence. This is comparable to
differences between humans of different ethnic or geographic
origins. It is not surprising given that the Feldhofer and Caucasus
individuals lived 2,500 kilometers and tens of thousands of years
apart.
</P>
<P>
   The research is a beacon of hope for studies of our closest
extinct relative. Neither the Caucasus nor the Feldhofer remains
were preserved in ideal conditions for the retrieval of delicate
DNA that is tens of thousands of years old.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike Siberian mammoths or the Tyrollean iceman, they were not
frozen in the permafrost of a glacier. This suggests that more DNA
from Neanderthal specimens _ even the most ancient remains _ might
be extracted to give a snapshot of the evolution of a complete
species from start to finish. &QL;

<P>
   Researchers in India may have come up with a new way of
predicting when explosives might lose their fizz. Medical imaging,
it seems, could reveal an explosive's shelf life and sensitivity.
</P>
<P>
   Bubbles or ``void spaces'' collapse under the high-pressure
shock waves of an explosion. Compression instantly forces up bubble
temperature and ignites the surrounding material. More and more
bubbles get converted into these hotspots as shock waves rush
through a detonating explosive.
</P>
<P>
   ``The size and the number of bubbles is half the science of
making emulsion explosives,'' says Jack Hedger, technical officer
of the United Kingdom's Institute of Explosives Engineers. Only
bubbles below a certain size produce enough heat to drive an
explosion forward, he adds.
</P>
<P>
   Explosives are given void spaces by filling them with porous
solid bits. Tiny glass balloons, mineral particles and even pieces
of corn all put crushable air pockets into the liquid. From the
size and number of these additions, manufacturers can calculate how
many void spaces, on average, a liquid explosive contains. This
figure gives a guide to what should happen when the plunger is
pressed.
</P>
<P>
   Mixing air and other gases into the explosive while blending the
emulsion is a cheaper alternative, but one that makes bubble
content difficult to regulate and quantify. Liquid density gives no
clues to void size and peering down a microscope is unreliable as
bubbles move around in the sloppy slurry.
</P>
<P>
   Promising images of gas bubbles mixed into emulsion explosives
can be produced with a technique called nuclear magnetic resonance,
according to P.K. Ghosh and his colleagues at the ICI India R&AMP;T
Center in Thane, India.
</P>
<P>
   Magnetic resonance is used widely in medicine (under the
pseudonym medical resonance imaging or MRI) to map blood flow
around the body, and the brain in particular. It identifies the
distinctive magnetic fields around the nuclei of most atoms.
</P>
<P>
   The technique offers a way to check the bubble quality of
emulsion explosives that ``was hitherto not possible due to
nonavailability of noninvasive techniques for void measurements,''
the group reported.
</P>
<P>
   Ghosh and his colleagues used magnetic resonance to probe
samples of a water-in-oil concentrated emulsion explosive. Each
sample was divided into a grid of over 16,000 squares, which were
checked for signals or ''echoes.''
</P>
<P>
   The strongest signals correspond to the explosive ingredients:
water, ammonia and paraffin oil. Void spaces do not produce signals
and so show up as holes.
</P>
<P>
   The pictures that Ghosh's group obtained are not perfect but
they do reveal bubbles, like a blurred black and white photograph
of Swiss cheese. Better picture resolution will help measure bubble
size, the team said.
</P>
<P>
   Magnetic resonance imaging can only work with very small samples
of explosive. The technique will have to be improved before it can
analyze the cartridges of explosives used in mines. And, because
bubbles merge and expand over time until they are too flabby to go
out with a bang, it could help determine a ''best before'' date for
explosives. &QL;

&HT;     PROTESTS AGAINST THE MEAN-SPIRITED DR. LAURA COULD BACKFIRE 
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. _ Dr. Laura Schlessinger is the Queen of Contempt,
a bully and a bigot _ the last at least when it comes to
homosexuals. That is her appeal.
</P>
<P>
   But gay and lesbian advocates are running a very real risk of
turning her into something else: a martyr.
</P>
<P>
   In her daily radio show that is broadcast nationally,
Schlessinger dishes out instant, simplistic and acerbic advice to
masochistic callers. Her analysis often takes the form of moral
edicts delivered in a withering, mean-spirited fashion.
</P>
<P>
   Included in her heaping helpings of abuse are some pretty
vitriolic assertions about homosexuality: Gays are ``sexual
deviants,'' ``biological errors,'' unfit parents and more prone to
pedophilia.
</P>
<P>
   ``Why does deviant sexual behavior get rights?'' she asked on
her show.
</P>
<P>
   Now the good doctor (her degree is in physiology, not
psychology) has a syndicated television show slated for the fall
that has been picked up by 160 television stations nationwide.
</P>
<P>
   Why, you ask, would anyone want her on the air?
</P>
<P>
   We'll give you 20 million guesses, one for each of her
listeners. That's more than Rush or Howard.
</P>
<P>
   ``We think it is the hottest thing in the marketplace,'' Steve
Baboulis, general manager of WNYT, the NBC affiliate in Albany,
said of the upcoming television show. ``Obviously, it will be
controversial.''
</P>
<P>
   The show's distributor, Paramount Television, has been hit with
protests, including an organized demonstration Tuesday in
Hollywood. Web sites have popped up decrying her television deal
(www.stopdrlaura.com might be the most comprehensive), while gay
rights groups have formally petitioned Paramount to drop her.
</P>
<P>
   Understandable, but worrisome.
</P>
<P>
   In the face of the protests, Laura (let's forget the doctor
part: the title is misleading and irrelevant to what she does) and
her supporters cry ``fascism'' (patently false, because the state
is not involved), ``terrorism'' and ``censorship.''
</P>
<P>
   Bullies often cry ``foul'' when someone punches back.
</P>
<P>
   Schlessinger _ who at least decries violence against gays _ says
her beliefs and moral code are rooted in her Orthodox Judaism. She
denies the comparison between homophobia and racism, stating the
difference is between actions and skin color. This 53-year-old
model of morality is an advocate of ``reparative therapy'' that
``cures'' homosexuals.
</P>
<P>
   Recently, she issued an apology for some of her comments. It
didn't stick; she later called it a ``clarification.''
</P>
<P>
   A couple of things. This is not a First Amendment issue. Yes,
you have a right to your beliefs and a right to express them. But
you do not have a constitutional right to your own television show,
radio show, or space in a newspaper. So don't even try that
argument.
</P>
<P>
   And vocal opposition to someone's beliefs does not amount to
censorship _ again, a dysfunction of the state _ or terrorism. That
rant is as well thought out as some of Laura's asinine remarks
about gays.
</P>
<P>
   In short, the woman is a twit. Fine. So why is this anti-Laura
push a concern?
</P>
<P>
   Because she is angling for victim status, and she just might get
it.
</P>
<P>
   It worked for John Rocker, the Atlanta Braves pitcher who, in
one Sports Illustrated article, made a fool of himself with bigoted
remarks (aimed at blacks, gays, Asians, single mothers _ pick a
minority), then got suspended from baseball. This knucklehead gets
support from some people because he's getting ``picked on.''
</P>
<P>
   The call for pulling Schlessinger's television show is
misguided. Pre-emptive strikes run a risk of making the aggrieved
minority look more like the bully. Plus, the most likely end result
will be heightened ratings. Look at how past protests against shows
like ``NYPD Blue'' and ``Married ... with Children'' fared.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, these advocacy groups should make a different point
clear to Paramount, and the show's sponsors: Go ahead, put Dr.
Laura on. We welcome it.
</P>
<P>
   And every time she says ridiculous, bigoted comments _ on radio
or television _ we will make these transgressions known widely and
loudly. This is the person with whom you want to be associated?
That's fine by us. We'll make sure everyone knows.
</P>
<P>
   Schlessinger's comments should be given as much exposure as
possible. Silencing her doesn't remove the egregious beliefs that
she and others hold. Air them. Let everyone know how stupid she
sounds.
</P>
<P>
   Laura Schlessinger is a lot of things. ``Martyr'' should not be
one of them.
</P>
<P>

&HT;     EUCALYPTUS TREES LIE AT THE ROOT OF NEIGHBORHOOD FEUD

 &HT;     By RACHEL GORDON  
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Eucalyptus trees are like pigeons.
</P>
<P>
   Some consider them pesky intruders, better dead than alive.
Others see the eucalyptus as a gift from nature that adds majesty
to a city taken over by asphalt and steel.
</P>
<P>
   The conflict has smoldered for years, flaring at times at Angel
Island, the Presidio and San Bruno Mountain. Today, the hot spot is
Tankhill, a little patch of hilltop open space in the Cole Valley
area of San Francisco that provides visitors with spectacular
views, a glimpse of history and a touch of tranquillity.
</P>
<P>
   The fight on Tankhill is over two eucalyptus trees that city
officials hope to cut down. They say the trees are ruining the
natural habitat, killing off native wildflowers and grasses.
</P>
<P>
   Eucalyptus trees, native to Australia, were introduced into the
area in the mid-1800s with the hope of providing lumber for the
burgeoning region, only to be found useless for that endeavor.
</P>
<P>
   ``Eucalyptus trees can really be quite destructive,'' said Mike
Morlin, the assistant superintendent of parks. If you look under
them, you really don't see a lot growing.''
</P>
<P>
   The oils from the trees act like poison to native flora, such as
the California buttercup, footsteps of spring, pink clarkia, lupine
and grasses, said Pete Holloran, president of the Yerba Buena
chapter of the California Native Plant Society. The shadows created
by the trees also pose problems, he said.
</P>
<P>
   But Morley Singer, a Tankhill neighbor for some 30 years, looks
at those trees and sees august, natural towers.
</P>
<P>
   ``The trees are stunningly beautiful. You should have seen the
fog drifting through them this morning,'' he said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Singer said he, his wife and dog walk Tankhill just about every
day. He can see the targeted trees from his nearby home.
</P>
<P>
   ``It just boggles my mind that they would cut them down,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   The two trees are not the only ones to stand on Tankhill; about
40 others also grace the 2.8-acre respite that developers once eyed
for 20 single-family houses until the city designated it open space
23 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Neighbors fear that if these two trees go, more chain-sawing may
follow. Other eucalyptus trees were cut down in years past.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's like a graveyard of tree stumps out there,'' said
neighbor Denise Scriver.
</P>
<P>
   Morlin said the city has no plans at this time to cut down the
other trees. The two with death warrants, he said, have been found
to be particularly vexatious to the natural habitat.
</P>
<P>
   Paul Castleman, another neighbor, doesn't buy it. ``Anyone who
lives near eucalyptus trees beware,'' he said. ``They'll come after
yours next.''

   RUSSIA-ELECTION (Moscow) _ In what looks like an effort to
ensure a first-round victory for Acting President Vladimir Putin in
Sunday's election by taking votes from challenger Grigory
Yavlinsky, the state TV channel has run ``news'' reports on how
Jews, gay men and foreigners support Yavlinsky. The gay segment is

   POPE-ISRAEL-ASSESS (Jerusalem) _ News Analysis: Despite an
outbreak of violence at a Palestinian refugee camp and the sniping
over Jerusalem that ruined his inter-denominational gathering, the
pope has managed so far to hover above the fray. In doing so, he
has presented what some see as a model of brotherly discourse to
religious leaders here. And he has established a soothing tone that
quieted most of the tensions and made both Israelis and
Palestinians feel endorsed by his visit.

6, the National D-Day Museum will open in Higgins' hometown, New
Orleans, La. The museum will focus on the Normandy invasion,
commonly known as D-Day, but it will tell the story of all the
major amphibious assaults undertaken by Americans during the war,
including Pacific engagements like Iwo Jima, Guadalcanal, and
Okinawa.

   WOMEN-VOTERS (Washington) _ Behind much of the political debate
in recent weeks, on issues from gun control to education, is an
intensifying struggle for the votes of women, particularly suburban
mothers. Strategists in both parties say the presidential race may
well hinge on whether Gov. George W. Bush, who has framed his
campaign around a promise of ``compassionate conservatism,''
succeeds in holding his own among women, who since the early 1980s
have tended to vote Democratic. One of the first tests may come on
the issue of gun violence and gun control, which pollsters say is a
far more powerful issue among women than among men. By Robin Toner.

million Playstation 2 videogame consoles in the first three days on
the market. And in California, Microsoft jolted the industry with
the announcement of X-Box, a Windows PC masquerading as a videogame
console. But one should not forget the $4.2 billion industry's
greatest bit player of all: Game Boy. With nearly 88 million Game
Boys sold in the last decade, Nintendo reigns as the uncontested
heavyweight champion of selling bantamweight games you can hold in
the palm of your hand, boasting more than 99 percent of the market.
While there has been no lack of would-be rivals, the Game Boy

&HT;     CAMEOS MAKE GREAT ART ON OR OFF THE BODY 
</HEADLINE>
  
 &HT;     (For release Sunday, March 26)   &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By FRANCES INGRAHAM HEINS

<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. _ Cameos not only make great jewelry, but great
works of art as well.
</P>
<P>
   Portraits and classical themes often dominate the art of cameo
cutting, which flourished in the first half of the 1st century A.D.
</P>
<P>
   They are most often carved from stratified stones or shells,
which give the relief cut in the top layer a background of a
contrasting color. But they can also be carved from glass, onyx,
porcelain and ivory or made from molded plastic.
</P>
<P>
   The images are often very detailed _ from the facial expression
to curls in the hair. It's the larger amount of detailing in a
cameo that makes it more valuable. The material and age of the
cameo also contribute to its worth.
</P>
<P>
   Hard stone is much more difficult to carve than a softer shell.
But many of the cameos of the late 18th century are intaglios,
where the design is incised in, or hollowed out of, the top layer
of stone, rather than carved in relief.
</P>
<P>
   This period also produced a lot of copyists and forgers. In some
cases, older cameos from the 15th century have been reworked,
making dating rather difficult.
</P>
<P>
   Always look at a cameo carefully to check for any damage, such
as tiny cracks or chips. The high points of the carving are prone
to chip.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can place cameo pins in a velvet-lined case and hang them
on the wall,'' said William Vollbrecht, owner of Vollbrecht Jewelry
and Antiques in Guilderland, N.Y. ``This way, you can take one out
and wear it whenever you want.''
</P>
<P>
   Framed cameos are often hung on the wall as a pair, or you can
create a whole wall grouping out of a collection.
</P>
<P>
   Wedgwood is best known for his porcelain and stoneware cameos of
the second half of the 18th century. His blue-and-white Jasper Ware
was a popular material.
</P>
<P>
   The background of a cameo comes in a variety of shapes, from
oval and round to rectangular.
</P>
<P>
   Vollbrecht said that cameos range in price from about $125 up
into the thousands.

CLINTON SPENDS LAST DAY IN INDIA FOCUSING ON ECONOMY 
</HEADLINE>
  (EDS: This early version will be updated as needed.) 
(See also CLINTON-PAKISTAN, INDIA-TB) 
(js) 
 By JANE PERLEZ   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOMBAY, India _ In a parting message, President Clinton
addressed a group of businessmen at the stock exchange here Friday
night, saying that he hoped his visit India over the last five days
would become the catalyst for a new relationship with the United
States.
</P>
<P>
   ``Friends don't have to agree on every issue,'' Clinton said.
``They just have to have an honest relationship.''
</P>
<P>
   He appealed again to India to reduce tensions on the
subcontinent with its neighbor, Pakistan, and to forswear nuclear
weapons, asking Indians to work for ``the proliferation of new
ideas'' and not ``dangerous weapons.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton was scheduled to leave here for Islamabad on Saturday
morning to meet with the military leader of Pakistan, Gen. Pervez
Musharraf. The president will suggest that the confrontation with
India over the disputed Himalayan region of Kashmir holds dark
consequences for Pakistan, said Sandy Berger, Clinton's national
security adviser. Clinton is also expected to urge Pakistan's
leaders to move forcefully toward restoring democracy after the
October coup that brought Musharraf to power.
</P>
<P>
   On Friday Clinton concentrated on the economy, the area where
there is probably the most common ground between the United States
and India. He saluted India's information technology industry, the
core of the country's steady economic growth and the crucible for
much of Silicon Valley in California.
</P>
<P>
   In a gesture toward the potential for trade between India and
the United States, Clinton announced financing from the U.S.
Export-Import Bank for small business exports to India, guarantees
of rupee-dominated loans to Indian importers and financing for the
purchase of 10 Boeing passenger aircraft by Jet Airways of India, a
new domestic airline.
</P>
<P>
   For the moment, trade between the United States and India is
relatively small: only $12 billion last year, compared to $94.9
billion between the United States and China. But it is the
potential for dramatic growth, especially with an expanding Indian
middle class that has a taste for U.S. consumer goods.
</P>
<P>
   The United States is India's largest trading partner, but India,
because of its high tariffs and largely state-run economy, accounts
for less than 1 percent of U.S. global investments. Accompanied by
his commerce secretary, William M. Daley, throughout this trip,
Clinton made clear that he hopes that will change.
</P>
<P>
   During a visit to Hyderabad earlier Friday, the president spoke
at a software center, popularly known as Hi-Tec City, an acronym
for Hyderabad Information Technology-Engineering Consultancy City.
A number of U.S. computer companies, including Microsoft, Oracle
and Toshiba, have set up shop there, alongside new Indian giants
and smaller start-ups.
</P>
<P>
   In extolling Indian achievements in information technology,
Clinton cited some of the world's computer superstars: Vinod
Khosla, who helped build Sun Microsystems, and Vinod Dahm, who
created the Pentium chip.
</P>
<P>
   India was ``fast becoming one of the world's software
superpowers,'' Clinton said, proving that ``in a globalized world,
developing nations not only can succeed, developing nations can
lead.'' The number of Internet users in India was set to grow 10
times in the next four years, he said. India's information
technology exports have catapulted from $150 million 10 years ago
to $4 billion today. The Indian government projects that by 2008,
those exports will grow to $85 billion.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Most importantly for India, Clinton said that the significant
impact of Indian computer engineers on the U.S. computer industry
was now beginning to pay back here in India. ``We're moving from
brain drain to brain gain,'' the president said. A group called
IndUS Entrepreneurs, whose members include the elite of Indian
software engineers in Silicon Valley, estimates that 30 percent of
the software engineers in the valley are of Indian origin.
</P>
<P>
   Most were educated at India's institutes of technology and came
to the United States to work in the valley. But now, with the
Indian economy growing at 6 percent annually and 10 percent growth
within site, some Silicon Valley veterans are beginning to return
to India.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Clinton also struck one of his favorite themes about the
Internet: that it can be used to lift the poor. India, he told his
audience, accounted for 30 percent of the world's software
engineers but also 25 percent of the world's malnourished.
</P>
<P>
   Thus, the president said, India was in a special position to
show how its brains and inventiveness in the new technologies could
improve health care and education across the nation's villages.
</P>
<P>
   This was ``good economics,'' Clinton argued. If, for example,
villages had computers with educational software _ and printers _
there was a potential for a revolution in education in a country
where almost 50 percent of the population remains illiterate.
</P>
<P>
   ``It would mean among other things that the world's most
populous nation would have the world's largest number of educated
people and, therefore, in no time would have the world's largest
economy,'' he said.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Clinton chose to come to Hyderabad _ one of the three urban
centers that make up India's Silicon Triangle _ in part because of
Chandrababu Naidu, the chief minister of the state of Andhra
Pradesh, where the city is located.
</P>
<P>
   Naidu, 49, effusively introduced Clinton Friday before an
audience of Indian computer entrepreneurs gathered in the atrium of
the Hi-Tec City building. The kind of political leader that the
president admires, Naidu appeals to the growing urban middle class
of India with ideas like making his state another Singapore within
20 years. He favors cutting state subsidies, courting private
investment and spending more on education and rural development.
</P>
<P>
   His party is a powerful member of the Hindu-Nationalist-led
coalition that won the national elections last October, and
Washington believes that Naidu represents the next generation of
national leaders, and perhaps a future prime minister.

&HT;     PENTAGON FINDS WIDESPREAD HARASSMENT OF GAYS IN UNIFORM  
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)   
 &HT;     By ERIC ROSENBERG And STEWART M. POWELL  
 &HT;     c.2000 Hearst Newspapers   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The Pentagon admitted Friday that there is
widespread harassment of homosexuals in the armed forces, reporting
that 80 percent of GIs questioned at 38 installations worldwide had
heard anti-gay remarks in the past year and that 37 percent had
witnessed or experienced harassment.
</P>
<P>
   Defense Secretary William Cohen immediately launched an
emergency four-month effort to combat what he called ``harassment
based on perceived sexual orientation.''
</P>
<P>
   Cohen acted in response to a report by the Pentagon's deputy
inspector general, Donald Mancuso, who randomly surveyed more than
71,570 men and women in the nation's 1.4 million troops. The survey
gauged their experiences under the Clinton administration's
controversial ``don't ask, don't tell, don't pursue'' policy that
was inaugurated in 1993 to enable homosexuals to serve more freely
in the armed forces.
</P>
<P>
   The report said 80 percent of the respondents ``stated that they
had heard offensive speech, derogatory names, jokes or remarks
about homosexuals in the last 12 months.''
</P>
<P>
   It also found that 85 percent said they believed ``such comments
were tolerated to some extent.'' Of those surveyed 37 percent
``responded that they had witnessed or experienced an event or
behavior toward a service member that they considered to be
harassment based on perceived homosexuality.''
</P>
<P>
   The majority of those surveyed, 57 percent, said that they had
``not had training'' on the Pentagon's policy of tolerance toward
homosexuals. But the GIs said they felt free to report harassment
to superiors, with 78 percent saying that they would ``feel free to
report harassment of perceived homosexuals.''
</P>
<P>
   Cohen announced several hours before the public release of the
report that he was establishing a working group of senior military
leaders to map steps to combat the problem. He said the panel will
try to change the hostile atmosphere that gay and lesbian troops
often encounter.
</P>
<P>
   Cohen told a breakfast meeting with reporters that ``the
incidents and use of abusive language (against suspected gay and
lesbian troops) are more widespread than I anticipated. I was
surprised at the numbers of people who said they saw some evidence
of harassment.''
</P>
<P>
   Michelle Benecke, co-executive director of the Servicemembers
Legal Defense Network, an organization that provides legal aid to
homosexual military personnel, said the findings confirm what the
group has said for years.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have told the Pentagon for six years that harassment and
abuse are a serious problem. I'm glad the Pentagon has finally
acknowledged it. But the key to stopping harassment is leadership
and accountability. We hope this oversight committee is not a
substitute.'' Cohen said a major responsibility for the oversight
council will be to ensure that all military personnel are versed in
new Pentagon anti-harassment guidelines issued last month. The
guidelines are aimed at making sure the controversial
administration policy on gays in the military is followed. The
policy allows homosexuals to serve as long as they keep quiet about
their sexual orientation and don't engage in homosexual acts.
</P>
<P>
   The policy also is designed to ensure that troops who are
harassed can complain to their commanders without fear of setting
in motion an investigation into their sexuality.
</P>
<P>
   The Pentagon survey found that many troops simply were
unfamiliar with the policy.
</P>
<P>
   Cohen ordered the survey of the bases in the wake of the murder
last July of an Army recruit at Ft. Campbell, Ky., who was
suspected of being gay.
</P>
<P>
   In December, Army Pvt. Calvin Glover, 19, was sentenced to life
in prison for murdering the recruit, Pvt. Barry Winchell, 21, with
a baseball bat. During Glover's trial, soldiers testified that
Winchell was regularly taunted with anti-gay slurs and that
superiors did not intervene when he complained.

By DAVID BLOOM 
c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Once upon a time, your radio might pick up only 15 or, in a big
market like Los Angeles, maybe 50 stations, depending on the time
of day, which mountains were next to your house and how good your
antenna was.
</P>
<P>
   Despite improving technology, the choices seemed to shrink in
recent years. The loosening of federal restrictions has meant fewer
companies owned more stations and made them sound all the same,
concentrating on a few tightly controlled programming formats most
likely to attract larger audiences. If you weren't into mainstream
pop, Mexican country or a few other categories, you weren't going
to hear a lot of music you like.
</P>
<P>
   Well, no more. Thanks to the Internet, you can find virtually
any kind of music you like, using your computer. You can even
create your own niche, either by culling a custom playlist from a
site's thousands of selections, or becoming a DJ or talk-show host
yourself with virtually no equipment.
</P>
<P>
   The Internet has set off an explosion of sites that provide
``streams'' of music available on your computer _ or new Internet
radio players like those from Kerbango. For once, you won't be
stuck with a few, mostly uninteresting formats, but can turn on the
music you like.
</P>
<P>
   A quick check of the Web turns up thousands of radiolike sites,
including online versions of many broadcast stations. You can find
a ton of choices at search engines such as Yahoo!, or go to media
specialists such as Yack.com, which fancies itself a TV and radio
guide for the Net, or Tuneto.com and WebRadio, which let you pick
through stations that use its technology.
</P>
<P>
   Another useful alternative is the latest version of MusicMatch,
software that now has a button you can click on to pick from
hundreds of Web radio sites. The free program also lets you play
CDs on your computer, find and play MP-3 music files and even, with
the $30 upgrade, create custom CDs. RealNetworks' RealPlayer
Jukebox has somewhat similar capabilities.
</P>
<P>
   So what can you find out there?
</P>
<P>
   One good place to start is Santa Monica-based KCRW-FM, the
nation's biggest public radio station, which recently went from one
to three channels of its eclectic and influential music and public
affairs programming (KCRW.org), and cut a deal for HOB.com to carry
its programming there.
</P>
<P>
   HOB.com makes available a huge array of performances and other
music from the House of Blues chain of venues, to which HOB.com is
connected.
</P>
<P>
   The homesick or curious can hear plenty of commercial stations
as well, from WBCN in Boston to the BBC in Britain to B-92 in
Belgrade (when it's not shut down by the Yugoslav government). But
focus on the old- media entries and you'll miss all the new
companies busily busting paradigms.
</P>
<P>
   For instance, soundbreak.com mixes underground dance music with
strikingly offbeat animation, video feeds of the ``digital jocks,''
a DJ-run chat room, and information and fan ratings on each song.
The site expects to soon sell the music it plays.
</P>
<P>
   Soundbreak's vice president of music is Mark Goodman, one of
MTV's original five VJs, who once again feels like he's part of
something big.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm jumping on a moving freight train,'' Goodman said. ``I
feel lucky to be aboard. The way you get music, the way you listen
to it, the way you buy it, is going to change.''
</P>
<P>
   Soundbreak's digital jocks said their new gigs differ radically
from their broadcast past.
</P>
<P>
   ``To me, the most exciting part is the ability to interact with
the listeners,'' said Christian. ``I had 30 people in the chat room
last night and it was just going.''
</P>
<P>
   Tobi said listeners get upset when she steps away from the
microphone, and the chatroom keyboard, because they enjoy
constantly interacting with her. Like her colleagues, she's had to
become tech-savvy fast, and a much better typist.
</P>
<P>
   Part of what makes Internet radio so interesting is the control
fans have over what they hear, said Dave Goldberg, CEO of Santa
Monica-based Launch Media.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody likes music, but they don't like everybody else's
music,'' Goldberg said. ``That's why you don't have any music on
MTV's cable broadcasts anymore. They play a Madonna video and
chances are, the people who want to watch a Metallica video don't
want to wait until that's over. We don't have that problem. We give
you control. You get the music you want, when you want it.''
</P>
<P>
   His company's Launchcast software lets listeners build their own
notion of what a station should be. Pick a genre, throwing out
those individual artists you don't like, then save the playlist, as
more than 200,000 people have done. You can share it with friends,
or try out someone else's mix. The software turns Joe Sixpack into
Joseph Tastemaker.
</P>
<P>
   Live365.com and Shoutcast take the notion of personal tastemaker
to its logical end, letting anyone become a station manager,
sending out their own talk show or music.
</P>
<P>
   Their software makes it easy to Webcast anything from
Republicans `R' Us to Led Zeppelin Forever to Clog Music Lovers,
and people do. But it isn't just amateurs using these services.
</P>
<P>
   Blues wunderkind Kenny Wayne Sheppard, for one, put his studio
outtakes, live songs and album cuts on two Live365.com channels,
then linked them to his own fan site.
</P>
<P>
   Enigma Digital doesn't even want to be called a music operation,
though music _ from hard rock to Christian contemporary _ is the
organizing feature around each of its sites, said co-founder Bob
Ezrin, a legendary record producer.
</P>
<P>
   Ezrin calls the sites ``Net-based, individually branded,
genre-specific lifestyle communities. We're creating safe havens
for people whose particular passion is a genre of music.''
</P>
<P>
   Ezrin's company is one of several using music to reach, and
eventually sell to, specific online communities. The Net, Ezrin
said, does a terrific job connecting people of like minds and
diverse geographies into a cohesive community.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Internet is the world's first three-way medium: connecting
people to stuff, stuff to people and people to each other,'' Ezrin
said. ``It's a whole other animal.''
</P>
<P>
   And with visitors from as many as 58 countries at a time,
someone's listening, and closely: When Enigma's KNAC.com posted a
vintage live track by Guns N' Roses, 75,000 people downloaded it in
three weeks, Ezrin said.
</P>
<P>
   Another pair of pioneers _ Interscope Records founder Jimmy
Iovine and Universal Music Group head Doug Morris _ have rolled out
their own on/offline indefinable: Jimmy and Doug's Farm Club.
</P>
<P>
   The Farm Club is billed as a home where unknown artists could
essentially try out for the big leagues, maybe even sign with
Universal, the world's biggest music company.
</P>
<P>
   Since its announcement in November, Iovine said, Farmclub.com
has added an in-your-face USA Network TV show, record-label
operations and more.
</P>
<P>
   ``Doug and I were sitting around and said, 'If we were going to
start a new record company, what would we do?''' Iovine said. ``It
would be online and offline, it would have cable distribution,
hence a TV show.''
</P>
<P>
   Pigeonholing a music company in one medium is ``an absurd
concept,'' Iovine said. ``The world isn't just on TV, it isn't just
on the Internet, it isn't just on radio.''
</P>
<P>
   Unknown bands can post their tracks online, find bandmates, get
advice from rapper Dr. Dre and other industry vets, and build a fan
base, Iovine said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It really involves getting the musicians and the community of
people who like music to interact and get closer in this world of
communications,'' said Iovine.
</P>
<P>
   Farmclub.com got off to a rocky start when some bands loudly
questioned how different it truly was from old-media predecessors.
Since then, the company reportedly has begun mending fences, and
amending problematic contract provisions.
</P>
<P>
   MusicBlitz is another paradigm-buster, combining traditional
record-promotion teams with genre-specific Web sites featuring
artists such as Taj Mahal, Presidents of the United States of
America and Aimee Mann.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're trying to take the best of both worlds,'' said CEO Kevin
Nakao. ``You can't just put music on the Web. People think in black
and white, but that's not what we do. We really create the push
behind an artist.''
</P>
<P>
   Trying to follow all this can feel like hearing a beginners'
violin recital with a hangover. But focus on where the music is
going, instead of where it used to be. Then dial in.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have to look at the Net as the new medium,'' said Ezrin.
``It's entirely social. You're putting out information, you're
gathering information, and you're connecting people all at once.
It's something a record company (or radio station) can't do.'' &QL;

JONBENET'S PARENTS GO ON THE OFFENSIVE

</P>
<P>
   &UR; BY WILLIAM SALETAN &LR;  &QL; 
 &UR; (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   JonBenet Ramsey is back. Last fall, after three years of
investigation, a Colorado grand jury declined to indict anyone for
the murder of the 6-year-old beauty pageant starlet. Now her
parents, John and Patsy Ramsey, have launched a media blitz to
promote their book about the case, ``The Death of Innocence.''
</P>
<P>
   The Ramseys argue that an intruder killed JonBenet and that the
cops have tried to frame them instead of looking for the real
killer. Colorado Gov. Bill Owens complains that the Ramseys are
trying ``to remove the focus on them as suspects'' by faulting the
police and ``pointing a finger to some killer.'' Of course they
are. There's no other way to clear their names.
</P>
<P>
   The Ramseys could spend the rest of their lives gathering,
sifting, and spinning evidence to substantiate their innocence. It
would do them little good. In the arena of public opinion, there is
no presumption of innocence. There is only a presumption that the
most likely culprit is guilty.
</P>
<P>
   If your daughter is murdered in your home while you're there,
and if the police say they have no other suspects, you're presumed
guilty. You'll never escape that presumption by refuting the case
against you. The only way out is to make a case against somebody
else -- and to convince the public that the police, not you, are
responsible for failing to prove it.
</P>
<P>
   In politics, this principle is well understood: When you're
explaining, you're losing. George W. Bush could spend the next
eight months rebutting accusations that he has sent wrongly
convicted people to their deaths or that he has invited rich people
to stay overnight in the Texas governor's mansion because they gave
money to his campaigns. These rebuttals wouldn't help Bush. They
would help Al Gore, because most people would get lost in the
rebuttals and would come away with the vague impression that Bush
must be guilty of something. The only way for Bush to gain votes is
to stop talking about the accusations against him and start
throwing accusations at Gore.
</P>
<P>
   This is the problem with the Ramseys' media tour. They've been
forced to spend most of their time rebutting the evidence against
them. They do a pretty good job of it. After all, the grand jury
didn't indict them, and a veteran detective, Lou Smit, quit the
case in 1998, deeming the evidence inadequate.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want people to keep an open mind,'' Smit told the Rocky
Mountain News last week. ``All I want with the Ramseys is to put a
question mark behind their name, instead of this exclamation point
that everybody's been trying to put there.''
</P>
<P>
   Good luck. In a celebrity murder case, people have no patience
for question marks. They want answers. And until they get answers,
they want theories. Theory 1 is that the Ramseys did it. As long as
Barbara Walters and Katie Couric are talking about that theory, the
Ramseys are losing.
</P>
<P>
   The Ramseys understand that they have to develop a second
theory. ``Our objective is to find the killer,'' John Ramsey told
Newsweek. ``That's the only way we will prove our innocence.''
</P>
<P>
   The conventional wisdom about the Ramseys' PR blitz is that
they're not saying anything new. That view is factually correct but
strategically wrong. The difference is that this time, the Ramseys
are on the attack. They've developed a ``profile'' of the killer --
a 25- to 35-year-old pedophilic ex-convict with a stun gun and a
fetish for autoerotic asphyxiation -- and they're floating several
names, including their former housekeeper and a disgruntled
ex-business associate.
</P>
<P>
   Why haven't we heard these names before? The Ramseys blame the
cops. ``The police looked at the situation, didn't apply a lot of
logic to it, and said, 'Child murdered in the home, the book says
the parents always did it,' `` John Ramsey told Walters.
</P>
<P>
   Ramsey suggested to Newsweek that ``the vast majority of leads
the police got were not investigated because the case concluded on
Dec. 26.'' Patsy Ramsey added, ``The Boulder police would like this
to go away. They would like to just close the books. But we are not
going away. ... We will be looking for the person that murdered our
daughter.''
</P>
<P>
   In the Walters interview, John Ramsey sent a message to Governor
Owens: ``You've spent three years investigating my family. What are
you going to do to find the killer of my daughter?''
</P>
<P>
   The media are beginning to take up the Ramseys' questions. On
``Good Morning America,'' Walters replayed John Ramsey's challenge
to Owens. Other journalists are asking Owens, the district
attorney, and the local police chief whether they've exaggerated
the evidence against the Ramseys, why they haven't met with the
couple, why they haven't accepted the Ramseys' offers to take
lie-detector tests, and why they tried to prevent the grand jury
from hearing Detective Smit's testimony that an intruder may have
committed the crime.
</P>
<P>
   The police, the district attorney, and the governor have plenty
of good answers to these questions. The difference is that now
they're being forced to give those answers.
</P>
<P>
   So here's Theory 2: A pedophile saw JonBenet on the beauty
pageant circuit and tried to kidnap her. He got into the Ramseys'
house through the open window in the basement. He used a stun gun
to disable her -- leaving telltale marks in autopsy photographs --
but she regained consciousness and tried to escape or cry out. He
killed her, aborted his plan, and fled.
</P>
<P>
   The cops, having decided right away that the parents were
guilty, ignored and squandered evidence that might have nailed the
killer. Now they're covering up their mistake by telling reporters
that the Ramseys are ``hiding behind their attorneys'' and remain
under the ``umbrella of suspicion,'' where it rains all the time.
</P>
<P>
   To get out from under that umbrella, the Ramseys don't have to
make you believe the pedophile theory. They just need to make you,
Barbara Walters, and Bill Owens start talking about it.

&HT;     LADY BIRD JOHNSON RETURNS TO CHURCH WHERE SHE MARRIED LBJ 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By SUSIE P. GONZALEZ  
 &HT;     c.2000 San Antonio Express-News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN ANTONIO _ Lady Bird Johnson, the oldest living former first
lady, returned Thursday to the church where she was married to
visit with friends, including the college roommate who was her maid
of honor.
</P>
<P>
   Still chipper and gracious at 87, she granted media interviews,
signed autographs, ate lunch and enjoyed the company of lifelong
friends at St. Mark's Episcopal Church in downtown San Antonio.
</P>
<P>
   ``This city always will hold a place in my heart,'' Johnson said
in an interview.
</P>
<P>
   Her appearance caused something of a stir.
</P>
<P>
   Norma Farnes had taken her 5-year-old granddaughter, Spencer
Bobbitt, to participate in the church's ``Lenten lunch'' program
when she spied Johnson climbing the front steps, a cane in one hand
and the arm of a U.S. Secret Service agent in the other.
</P>
<P>
   ``See her?'' Farnes whispered to the wide-eyed child. ``She's
the lady responsible for planting wildflowers all over the
country.''
</P>
<P>
   Claudia ``Lady Bird'' Taylor and Lyndon Baines Johnson, the
future president of the United States who then was a congressman's
secretary, were married at St. Mark's on Nov. 17, 1934, after a
two-month courtship.
</P>
<P>
   Much of their dating took place via Depression-era phones, which
Mrs. Johnson described as ``not sophisticated contraptions.'' But
the conversations were enough to convince LBJ that Claudia Taylor
was the woman for him.
</P>
<P>
   The way Johnson remembers it, LBJ simply wouldn't take no for an
answer.
</P>
<P>
   She consulted an Episcopal prayer book, pondered the possibility
of letting him slip away, and said yes.
</P>
<P>
   The next question was where to marry. Since the bride was from
the East Texas town of Karnack and the groom had grown up in the
Texas Hill Country, San Antonio seemed an unlikely compromise for a
location.
</P>
<P>
   What brought them to the Alamo City to begin their 39-year
marriage was the woman who was to be Mrs. Johnson's maid of honor,
Cecille Marshall, and the best man, Dan Quill, who later became
postmaster here.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought I would love to have Cecille in my wedding,''
Johnson said.
</P>
<P>
   The two women were roommates while students at the University of
Texas at Austin.
</P>
<P>
   ``She's always been a special person,'' said Marshall, who was
at St. Mark's on Thursday. ``She's not your run-of-the-mill
person.''
</P>
<P>
   Marshall described Johnson as extremely dependable, loyal and
lots of fun. Because they were close friends, Marshall was not
surprised to be asked to take part in the hastily called nuptials
66 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was on a Saturday,'' Marshall said. ``She called and said,
`I'm going to be married. Would you stand for me?'''
</P>
<P>
   LBJ dispatched Quill to find a wedding ring, which he purchased
for $2.98 at a Sears &AMP; Roebuck store that was open late, Johnson
said.
</P>
<P>
   She wore a purple dress, only to learn later that it was LBJ's
least favorite color. She had no ring to give her husband, and
there were no flowers. A 10-day honeymoon in Mexico followed.
</P>
<P>
   Was she happy to have said yes after all?
</P>
<P>
   ``Oh, yes!'' Johnson said in her trademark drawl.
</P>
<P>
   She was a particular hit with children Thursday. In the church's
bustling cafeteria, 5-year-old Sterling Schrader presented a book
for Johnson to autograph.
</P>
<P>
   Without any hesitation, she signed it with her name and the
inscription, ``For a pretty young lady.''
</P>
<P>
   The Rev. Michael Chalk, rector of St. Mark's, was happy to have
the former first lady at his church.
</P>
<P>
   ``It means a great deal to us that Lady Bird, who was married
here, would come back and tell her story,'' he said. ``Their story
is so much a part of our parish.''
</P>
<P>
   The days are long gone when a couple could call him on a
Saturday morning to set up a wedding ceremony that evening, he
said.
</P>
<P>
   The church now advises engaged couples to go through a certain
amount of counseling.
</P>
<P>
   ``The priest at that time wanted them to have a waiting period,
too,'' Chalk said. ``But Lyndon was a pretty forceful fellow.''

VILLAGE SURVIVORS STRUGGLE TO RECOVER AFTER MASSACRE 
</HEADLINE>
 TAKES-BOS   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By KEVIN CULLEN  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BELA CRVKA, Yugoslavia _ There are no signs showing the way to
this small, dusty village tucked in the southwest corner of Kosovo,
but everyone knows where it is.
</P>
<P>
   When asked, people from surrounding villages point the
direction, then lower their eyes and bow their heads.
</P>
<P>
   A year ago, 3,000 people lived in Bela Cvrka (pronounced Bella
Circa), but today there are only 2,000. Some walk around with the
dazed look of having survived something awful. A third left and
can't bear to return, so horrible are the memories buried in the
rich, dark earth where local farmers once grew the tastiest green
peppers in the Balkans.
</P>
<P>
   The rebuilding that is taking place here is happening all across
Kosovo, where over the last nine months more than 1 million ethnic
Albanians have returned to villages destroyed by Serb forces in the
war that began one year ago. But the reconstruction of Bela Crvka
is more difficult, more poignant and more purposeful than most,
because it wasn't just buildings that were destroyed here.
</P>
<P>
   Last March 25, the day after NATO began bombing Yugoslavia, Serb
troops with blackened faces and even darker hearts surrounded the
village. As night fell the gunmen closed in, and terrified
villagers fled for their lives. The Serbs chased them down and
opened fire.
</P>
<P>
   When it was over, 65 villagers _ men, women, and six children _
were dead, their bodies sprawled in the fields or face down in the
Rimnik, a small river that snakes its way through the area. The
oldest child killed was a 13-year-old boy, the youngest a
2-year-old girl.
</P>
<P>
   According to prosecutors at the International Criminal Tribunal
for the former Yugoslavia, what took place here last March 25 was a
war crime, and it was orchestrated by Yugoslav President Slobodan
Milosevic. The massacre is one of six cited in the indictment that
charges Milosevic with using systematic terror against ethnic
Albanians to crush support for independence from Serbia, and,
later, to punish them for NATO's intervention.
</P>
<P>
   While investigators from the war crimes tribunal at The Hague
visit here periodically, gathering evidence and firming up witness
statements, the residents try to put their lives, their homes, and
their community back together. It is a slow, sometimes agonizing,
process.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   At the local elementary school named Liria, or Freedom, children
laugh and play soccer during recess. The school was trashed by
retreating Serb troops, and villagers had to use wood-burning
stoves in each classroom to make it through the winter. But classes
resumed on schedule, and most of the 450 students seem remarkably
well adjusted. The walls have posters warning children about the
dangers of land mines.
</P>
<P>
   Blrta Fetoshi, 12, a thin, thoughtful girl with brown hair and
almond eyes, said she and other students had lived in terror for
two years before the war began. Serb police and paramilitaries
would cruise by, firing randomly at the school.
</P>
<P>
   ``The teachers would tell us to dive on the floor,'' she
recalled.
</P>
<P>
   On the day of the massacre, she hid and was able to flee on a
tractor with her parents and older brother to Albania. The week
after NATO troops liberated the village, her family returned.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everything was destroyed. My house was burned. Everything I
had was burned. All my books,'' she said, her eyes misting. ``I
loved my books the most.''
</P>
<P>
   Blrta, whose family is still living in a makeshift home while
repairs continue on their house, wants to become a doctor.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want to help people,'' she said, smiling.
</P>
<P>
   The skeletons of charred cars, burned by Serb troops, lie
scattered through the village, some of them dumped in the river.
Children play on them. Before leaving, the Serbs bombed the mosque
and murdered the 29-year-old imam, Hajrulla Begaj. Villagers have
been too busy rebuilding the 300 homes that were destroyed here to
get around to restoring the mosque.
</P>
<P>
   ``This was a very beautiful mosque,'' said Aziz Popaj, 75,
standing in the rubble.
</P>
<P>
   He pointed to a field.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are many graves over there, young children,'' the old
man said, suddenly weeping. ``I survived because I am old. I wish I
died. I wish I died instead.''
</P>
<P>
   Sitting cross-legged on the carpet of his partially rebuilt
farmhouse, his shoes set neatly outside in keeping with Muslim
tradition, Sabri Popaj still can't figure out why he didn't die. He
is 41 but looks 10 years older. His two sons, his only children,
were killed in the massacre. So were his two brothers and nephew.
In all, 22 members of his extended family died in the massacre.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   On that fateful night last year, he was one of the last
villagers to flee, having stayed behind to release his cows into
the fields so the Serbs wouldn't kill them in their pens. In the
confusion, he got separated from his wife and sons, then sprinted
in the darkness before stumbling on 13 people from two families he
knew. They had stopped by the riverbank, the children too exhausted
and terrified to go on.
</P>
<P>
   ``I put a blanket down and made the children sit,'' he recalled.
``I covered a 2-year-old boy with a blanket. I saw the Serbs
coming, six of them wearing bandannas, and I told everyone to hide,
to scatter.''
</P>
<P>
   Popaj hid in a nearby irrigation ditch. There was utter
confusion in the darkness.
</P>
<P>
   ``Where is NATO for you now!,'' he heard one of the gunmen yell
before the firing began.
</P>
<P>
   The boy under the blanket, Dibran Zhuniqi, miraculously escaped
uninjured. Everyone else, including his parents, was slaughtered.
War crimes investigators later found a needle and syringe nearby,
and suspect it was used by at least one of the killers to whip
himself into a killing frenzy.
</P>
<P>
   As he lay in the darkness, Popaj heard more shooting, more
screaming, as the Serbs mowed down civilians fleeing along the
river. He did not move for two days.
</P>
<P>
   When Popaj and some other villagers tentatively emerged from
their hiding places, he saw his shepherd dogs, Karabash and Trum,
standing over a group of bodies on the riverbank, whimpering
mournfully. He found his sons, Shendet, 17, and Agon, 13, lying
dead in shallow water.
</P>
<P>
   Popaj and his neighbors began burying the dead, 36 the first
night, 29 the next day. It was exhausting, numbing.
</P>
<P>
   ``You feel dead, like they are,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   On the riverbank, he found brightly colored rubber boots of the
dead children. He went to put them in the graves but found he
couldn't.
</P>
<P>
   He went to the nearby village of Celine, where 74 people were
killed in a similar massacre. Again, he helped bury the dead.
</P>
<P>
   ``In Celine, I buried a child, not even a year old,'' Popaj
said, staring at his whitewashed wall. ``She had a bottle, still
sucking on it in death. We wanted to take it out, but we couldn't
so we buried her with it.''
</P>
<P>
   In July, more than three months after the massacre, war crimes
investigators came and gingerly explained that the bodies had to be
dug up so they could examine them for evidence.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's always the relatives who dig them up,'' Popaj said.

PUTIN'S RECORD SUGGESTS AN ALLIANCE WITH INSIDERS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DAVID FILIPOV AND BRIAN WHITMORE  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   MOSCOW _ The skeletons in Vladimir V. Putin's closet have little
to do with his shadowy past as a Soviet spy. They have to do with
his record as a public official in the decade before he was
suddenly named acting president.
</P>
<P>
   Putin, the clear favorite to win the presidency in his own right
in Russia's election Sunday, has vowed to dismantle the corrupt
system of insider dealings and patronage that flourished under his
predecessor, Boris N. Yeltsin, and helped doom most of this vast
nation to a decade of chaos and poverty. In effect, it was
government of the elites, by the elites, and for the elites.
</P>
<P>
   Far more than Putin's military campaign in Chechnya or his
commitment to democratic freedoms, the issue that intrigues
political observers is whether he means it when he promises to
establish a ``dictatorship of law'' that provides ``equal
conditions for all.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite his calls for reform, Putin's six months in power have
failed to dispel doubts that he is a creature of the insiders and
that he will govern in their interest.
</P>
<P>
   Documents detailing Putin's record as a city official in St.
Petersburg in the early 1990s appear to reveal a bureaucrat who was
less interested in enforcing the law than mining profits from the
loopholes.
</P>
<P>
   Putin last month announced a campaign against corruption, vowing
to exclude ``the possibility for someone to latch on to the
authorities and use this proximity for personal goals.''
</P>
<P>
   It is a message appreciated by ordinary Russians, who cope with
meddlesome bureaucrats on a local level and who have grown to
despise the moguls who control Russia's most lucrative industries
and are widely believed to exert heavy influence on the government.
</P>
<P>
   But Putin's early days as deputy mayor of St. Petersburg seem to
have been spent doing precisely what he says he will eradicate. An
investigation by city lawmakers eight years ago said that Putin had
set up import-export schemes that allegedly caused St. Petersburg
to lose out on millions of dollars of revenue.
</P>
<P>
   Those were the wild, early days of post-Soviet Russia, when
government bureaucrats had the power to grant favors that could
make a small-time businessman fabulously rich overnight. They set
the stage for Russia's economy to become the playground for
politically connected insiders, known here as ``oligarchs,'' who
divided up the country's best assets.
</P>
<P>
   For aspiring entrepreneurs, the best business was politics _ or
having politicians in your pocket. And for politicians, the best
way to make a comfortable living was to grant special favors to
businessmen.
</P>
<P>
   As St. Petersburg's deputy mayor, and head of the city's
Committee for Foreign Relations, Putin was in a position to grant
such favors. His committee oversaw foreign investment, humanitarian
aid, and relations with the diplomatic community. But perhaps most
importantly, Putin's duties eventually expanded to include the
regulation of local imports and exports.
</P>
<P>
   At the time, the most valuable privilege a bureaucrat could
grant a businessman was permission to export valuable raw materials
like precious and semi-precious metals, oil, and timber. These
goods could be bought cheaply in Russia and sold abroad for
fantastic profits.
</P>
<P>
   In the early 1990s, St. Petersburg, like much of Russia, was
struggling to cope with a deep economic crisis. The country's
distribution system, which delivered food from the countryside to
the cities, had broken down, and there was genuine fear of mass
starvation.
</P>
<P>
   In December 1991, Putin masterminded a plan to barter raw
materials abroad in exchange for food. The following month, the
government gave Putin's committee the right to grant licenses to
selected companies to export $92 million worth of metals, cement,
timber, and petroleum products.
</P>
<P>
   Putin signed deals with 19 companies that would act as
middlemen, exporting the raw materials and importing food. Most of
these companies were unknown at the time, and several had been
founded just months earlier.
</P>
<P>
   But the food for St. Petersburg's hungry masses never showed up.
Three months later, all the city had to show for Putin's deal were
two tankers of cooking oil. An investigation by the city council
found that the rare metals were being priced at a small fraction of
their value on the world market. The suspicion is that the profits
from the raw materials sold were much greater than the documents
reflect, but the proceeds never made it into the city's treasury.
</P>
<P>
   Vladimir Ivanidze, a Moscow investigative journalist, has turned
up documents showing that a company called Dzhikop received
permission from Putin's office to sell a semiprecious metal called
scandia, which is used in space and aviation technology, to a buyer
in Germany for less than one-fortieth of its market price.
</P>
<P>
   ``The more you study these documents, the more you find clues of
the most simple and impudent operation using one's official
position,'' Ivanidze said. ``If someone had interrogated (Putin),
he might have said where all the money went. But no one
interrogated him.''
</P>
<P>
   In a recently published interview, Putin conceded that
``unfortunately some of the companies did not fulfill the
conditions of their contracts.'' He said, however, that no crime
was committed and that local lawmakers were out to get him because
of his KGB past.
</P>
<P>
   In the wake of the investigation, local legislators demanded
that St. Petersburg's mayor at the time, Anatoly Sobchak, fire
Putin. Sobchak ignored the demand.
</P>
<P>
   Sobchak, who died Feb. 20, was charged with corruption after he
left office in 1996. But Putin's career flourished.
</P>
<P>
   He was offered a job as deputy to Pavel Borodin, who headed the
Kremlin's property department. This massive financial empire later
became the focal point of allegations that a Swiss company paid
bribes to Yeltsin and his family in return for huge Kremlin
contracts. Borodin was implicated, but Putin, as Borodin's deputy,
again avoided trouble.
</P>
<P>
   While Borodin was fighting off an investigation by Swiss
prosecutors, Putin went on to head Russia's Federal Security
Service, the main domestic successor of the KGB. Last August,
Putin's rise to the top began when Yeltsin chose him as prime
minister. Soon after, Russian forces began fighting an intense
campaign against rebels in Chechnya, which would turn the dour
Putin into the country's most popular politician. He became acting
president when Yeltsin resigned on New Year's Eve.
</P>
<P>
   Government powers, Putin now says, should not be used to enrich
favored financial clans or private-interest groups. He promises to
strengthen state control over the economy to protect it from
``illegal intrusions'' by bureaucrats and criminals.
</P>
<P>
   It is a useful campaign slogan. But people involved with Putin's
campaign make it clear that little has changed.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everyone knows that a `strong state' in Russia is a byword for
more corruption,'' said one Putin campaign strategist, who asked to
remain anonymous. ``A big property owner in Russia will lose his
property if he doesn't play politics. Everyone knows that. Everyone
knows we have had no administration, no government, just
representatives of competing financial-industrial groups. The big
question now is the new people Putin is bringing in _ whom they
will sell themselves to.''
</P>
<P>
   Last month, Putin's government looked the other way when
companies controlled by Kremlin insiders Roman Abramovich and Boris
Berezovsky bought a 70 percent stake in Russia's
multibillion-dollar aluminum industry. At the time, Putin said he
was unaware of the deal. An investigation by a senior aide charged
with enforcing antimonopoly regulations found no violations.
</P>
<P>
   Abramovich and Berezovsky were also reportedly behind a
management takeover of Russia's state oil company, Transneft, last
fall in which armed riot police in camouflage gear ousted the
previous director. Although it was technically illegal, Putin
allowed the takeover to stand.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts in Russia and the West suggest that Putin is trying to
stay out of the oligarchs' battles until after the election, when
any move to rein in their influence would be backed by a popular
mandate. But if the tactic was intended to show Putin's neutrality,
it has backfired.
</P>
<P>
   ``Putin will try to elevate his own group of oligarchs loyal to
him and make the others more subordinate to the state,'' said
Nikolai Petrov, a political analyst at the Carnegie Center for
International Peace, a Moscow-based think tank.
</P>
<P>
   Putin, said one analyst close to the Kremlin, has had dealings
with several ``oligarch'' groups. The closest, at the moment, is
Alfa Group, led by Pyotr Aven, who as Russia's foreign trade
minister in 1992 approved Putin's export contracts in St.
Petersburg. Putin's administration recently handed control of the
Committee of State Fisheries, which earns a lucrative $2 million a
year in licensing fees, to a group affiliated with Alfa, the
analyst said.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts said Putin needs a strong mandate in the election
Sunday in order to control the oligarchs. If he fails to win an
outright majority and is forced into a run-off, it will be easier
for vested interests to exert influence over him.
</P>
<P>
   Little will be known about Putin's plans until he begins filling
key Cabinet slots.
</P>
<P>
   One possible indicator could be Putin's choice for Russia's next
general prosecutor, an office that in the past has been blocked
from carrying out investigations of top Kremlin officials.
</P>
<P>
   One idea being floated is to name Yevgeny Primakov, a former
prime minister whose efforts to probe Kremlin corruption involving
members of Yeltsin's inner circle, including Berezovsky and
Borodin, were cut short by his dismissal in March 1999. As
prosecutor, Primakov could reopen those cases and demonstrate
Putin's independence. In an interview with the New York Times
published Friday, Putin said he would make use of former KGB
colleagues in the fight against corruption.
</P>
<P>
   ``This will be the litmus test,'' said one Kremlin analyst. ``If
Putin chooses Primakov as prosecutor, then he is the
government-minded patriot he says he wants to be. But if Putin
chooses one of his old pals from the KGB, then his administration
will steal like everyone else does.''
</P>
<P>
   At the moment, even insiders are guessing.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know who Putin is,'' said one official in Putin's
Kremlin administration. ``He himself doesn't know.''

 BELLA CRVYKA, Yugoslavia: ... Popaj said.  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Retrieving the decomposing bodies of his two sons from the earth
was simultaneously macabre and heart-rending. But there was a
sliver of mercy for Popaj: a roll of undeveloped film in his son
Agon's pocket.
</P>
<P>
   He had the film processed and now carries the photos around with
him _ snapshots of Agon's friends, a picture of Shendet smiling _
memories from the grave. It's not much, but the photos and a cheap
black watch he took from Shendet's wrist are all he has. He wears
his dead son's watch. The rest of the family's belongings were
destroyed by the Serbs.
</P>
<P>
   Like many others here, Popaj has what psychologists call
survivor's guilt.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everyday I ask, why did I survive?'' he said. ``Why did I
live?''
</P>
<P>
   He has no answers, and he sometimes wishes he hadn't lived, so
overwhelming, so visceral is the grief he shoulders. But more
often, Popaj is consumed by a sense of duty that keeps him going.
</P>
<P>
   ``My family has been on this land for 350 years,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Not everyone is so determined. His cousin, Feim Popaj, 35, was
shot in the hip and chest by marauding Serbs but managed to get
away. Popaj used a primitive first aid kit to cut out one bullet
lodged just beneath his cousin's skin, then nursed him back to
health on a diet of only milk.
</P>
<P>
   As his neighbors flocked back here, Feim Popaj asked his cousin
to get him out. Sabri Popaj paid someone $2,000 to smuggle him to
Switzerland.
</P>
<P>
   ``He says he will never come back,'' Popaj said, shrugging.
</P>
<P>
   His nephew, Valdet Popaj, 25, had the opposite reaction. He had
been living in Switzerland, seeking asylum, for five years. After
the war ended, he volunteered to come home to help his uncle
resurrect the farm.
</P>
<P>
   ``I lost so many members of my family, the material destruction
I found here did not bother me,'' Valdet Popaj said, taking a break
from building a makeshift greenhouse for peppers.
</P>
<P>
   In the center of the village, 43-year-old Sahit Zhuniqi sat on a
crate in Reshit Gashi's newly reopened grocery shop, drinking cheap
Turkish beer in the middle of the afternoon. Zhuniqi's eyes were
red, his speech slurred. Gashi nodded toward him, smiling
awkwardly, as if to say, ``Who can blame him?''
</P>
<P>
   No one does.
</P>
<P>
   ``They killed 13 members of my family,'' Zhuniqi said,
approaching a visitor unsteadily to shake his hand. ``They killed
my father, brother, four children. . .''
</P>
<P>
   His voice trailed off. Zhuniqi closed his eyes, shook his head,
then went back to his crate and can of beer.
</P>
<P>
   ``Business is not so good,'' said Gashi, 57, glancing at his
tortured friend. ``I've had a shop here for more than 30 years. But
no one has money these days. I will try to stay open. Maybe things
will get better.''
</P>
<P>
   You hear that a lot in Bela Crvka.
</P>
<P>
   Villagers hope there will be more indictments, not just of
bigshots like Milosevic, but of the men who pulled the triggers.
Sabri Popaj's wife has identified one of the men who led villagers
away. He is a Serb who lived in a neighboring village.
</P>
<P>
   ``I knew him before the war,'' Popaj said softly, almost as if
he can't believe it. ``I knew him.''
</P>
<P>
   Like most others here, Popaj says he can never live with Serbs
again, not after what happened.
</P>
<P>
   His dogs, which loyally guarded the dead of Bela Crvka on the
riverbank, did not survive the year. Trum was shot by Serbs, and
Karabash was struck and killed by a NATO armored vehicle.
</P>
<P>
   Asked if the war and the relative freedom it has brought was
worth it, Popaj pulled hard on a cigarette and exhaled slowly,
shaking his head.
</P>
<P>
   He tried exile, 45 days in Germany. He hated it. He came home.
He will not leave again, he said. There are some things you can't
run away from.
</P>
<P>
   ``What can I do?'' he said, his eyes glistening with tears or
hope or maybe both. ``I had two sons who are dead here. I will stay
with them.''

CLINTON'S TRUMP CARD ON GUNS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DERRICK Z. JACKSON  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   In his latest war of words with the National Rifle Association,
President Clinton has the ultimate trump card: the American people.
</P>
<P>
   This is the best time ever to speak for the people, given the
NRA's recent looniness and last week's concessions by Smith &AMP;
Wesson to agree to install safety locks on guns and refuse to
participate in gun shows that do not conduct background checks on
buyers.
</P>
<P>
   Clearly, there are some aspects of gun control that the American
people are reluctant to entertain. In different polls, only between
32 percent and 50 percent of Americans favor a nationwide ban on
handguns.
</P>
<P>
   Only 28 percent of Americans support the Justice Department's
suing gun manufacturers as a way to recoup health care and law
enforcement costs due to gun violence. Forty-eight percent of
Americans think the Second Amendment guarantees the right to own
guns, compared with 38 percent who say ``not necessarily'' or
``don't know/no answer.''
</P>
<P>
   The polls show ambivalence on concealed weapons. In an April
1999 NBC News/Wall Street Journal poll, 73 percent of Americans
disapproved of new laws making it easier to carry concealed
weapons. But a September 1999 Washington Post/ABC News poll found
Americans split down the middle on banning them outright, with 49
percent in favor of a ban and 48 percent against a ban.
</P>
<P>
   Even the NRA, at least before its latest bombasts, had
credibility. Polls show that about 50 percent of Americans had a
favorable opinion of the NRA, compared with about 40 percent who
had an unfavorable opinion.
</P>
<P>
   But Americans also do not want to continue to live in the wild,
wild West. There is much Clinton can do to pressure Congress into
action on gun control. The polls, all from 1999 and 2000, also
show:
</P>
<P>
   --Between 72 to 77 percent of Americans favor federal licensing
of handgun owners (Yankelovich Partners and ABC News/Washington
Post).
</P>
<P>
   --Between 73 and 79 percent of Americans favor registration of
all handguns (Gallup/CNN/USA Today).
</P>
<P>
   --Between 59 and 68 percent of Americans favor stricter gun
control laws (CNN/Time, ABC News/Washington Post, and Gallup).
</P>
<P>
   --Ninety percent _ 9 out of 10 Americans _ support background
checks on people buying firearms at gun shows (ABC News/Washington
Post).
</P>
<P>
   --Ninety-three percent favor a general mandatory waiting period
and background for all gun buyers (Newsweek).
</P>
<P>
   --Nearly 8 out of 10 Americans want a national ban on the sale
of assault weapons (ABC News/Washington Post and CBS News).
</P>
<P>
   --Only 4 percent of Americans are pleased about the way Congress
has handled gun control (ABC News/Washington Post).
</P>
<P>
   --Eighty-nine percent of Americans favor requiring child safety
locks on all new handguns (Newsweek).
</P>
<P>
   --Sixty-one percent of Americans favor requiring owners of
hunting rifles to register with the government (Newsweek).
</P>
<P>
   --Seventy two percent of Americans believe criminals should lose
their rights to a plea bargain when use a gun in their crimes
(CNN/Time).
</P>
<P>
   --Eighty-two percent believe the minimum age for handgun
posession should be 21 (Gallup/CNN).
</P>
<P>
   --Seventy-nine percent favor the registration of all firearms
(Gallup).
</P>
<P>
   --Sixty-eight percent favor banning high-capacity ammunition
clips (Gallup/CNN).
</P>
<P>
   --Between 77 and 84 percent think gun owners should have to take
an instruction course, similar to what drivers must do in order to
drive a car (Newsweek and Fox/Opinion Dynamics).
</P>
<P>
   --Sixty-one percent say they would be more likely to vote for
their congressional representative if he or she votes for tougher
gun control measures (Fox/Opinion Dynamics).
</P>
<P>
   --Sixty-five percent believe controlling gun ownership is more
important than protecting the right to own guns (Pew).
</P>
<P>
   --Seventy-five percent of African-Americans (who
disproportionately suffer from gun violence) and 75 perent of women
believe controlling gun ownership is more important than protecting
gun rights (Pew 1999).
</P>
<P>
   --Seventy percent of Americans believe stricter gun control laws
would reduce violent crime by either a little or a lot, compared to
26 percent who say more laws would not reduce violent crime ``at
all'' (Newsweek).
</P>
<P>
   With those numbers, Clinton cannot lose if he fights for some
forms of gun control. The NRA has the money, outspending Handgun
Control on a current media blitz, 3 to 1. The NRA has Congress
wrapped around its finger with cash and threats. But Clinton holds
the ace if he would only use it: the people.

`BEAUTY' DISPLAYS HOLLYWOOD'S NEW CLICHES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ALEX BEAM  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Perhaps you missed it; sexagenarian movie critic Rex Reed was
arraigned last week on charges of shoplifting three CDs (Mel Torme,
Carmen McRae, and Peggy Lee) from a Tower Records. Bantering with
reporters outside Manhattan Criminal Court, Reed protested his
innocence and worked in his plug for best picture at this Sunday's
Oscar ceremonies: ``I hope `American Beauty' wins.''
</P>
<P>
   Reed's not the only one. The critics loved ``Beauty.'' ``A
quirky and disturbing take on modern American life energized by
bravura performances,'' wrote the LA Times' Kenneth Turan. Like the
movie itself, David Denby's New Yorker review was so over-the-top,
you had to wonder if he was kidding. ``By far the strongest
American film of the year . . . rich, brilliant, unnerving . . .
mesmerizing hyperreality . . . the editing discovers . . . the
hidden connections among things.'' Waiter! Something cool for Mr.
Denby, please . . .
</P>
<P>
   Yes, I pretty much hated it. Maybe I took it too personally, as
I am the object of contemporary tastemakers' contempt _ a married,
white, heterosexual suburban parent. But I have to ask _ is there
any dime-store banality that writer Alan Ball and director Sam
Mendes didn't stuff inside this two-hour celluloid whale?
</P>
<P>
   1. Heterosexual white couples who live in suburban homes with
white picket fences _ as opposed to cool places, like LA's west
side _ are sexually frustrated adulterers. Natch.
</P>
<P>
   2. The worker is alienated from Evil Capitalism. ``Beauty''
protagonist Lester Burnham works as a self-described ``whore for
the advertising industry,'' which Hollywood purports to disdain.
Except when it is used to promote sensitive, cutting-edge material
like ``American Beauty,'' that is. The film's producers are
reported to have spent $775,000 in trade industry ads alone,
puffing their product for an Oscar.
</P>
<P>
   3. Capitalism Is Evil, the Sequel: Burnham's boss pays for sex
with the company credit card _ doesn't everybody? The script,
personally approved for production by Steven Spielberg, spends a
good 20 minutes mocking the commercialism of the hateful real
estate business. As opposed to the public-spirited movie business,
I guess.
</P>
<P>
   4. You're in the military? You must be queer. All those men
packed in together . . . those guns, with the long barrels. In the
character of Marine colonel Frank Fitts, the filmmakers have scored
a twofer _ he's a militaristic homophobe, and he's gay! So I guess
that makes him (see cliche number one) an adulterous parent. It
gets better still: He's a militaristic, gay, Nazi-loving homophobe.
He probably wears fur, too.
</P>
<P>
   The original script had a scene in which Colonel Fitts watched
his male lover die in Vietnam. That might have been useful to roll
in yet another Hollywood cliche _ you know, the Vietnam War/loss of
innocence thing. (Cf ``Rambo,'' ``The Rock,'' and everything in
between.) In case you missed the connection between guns and
psychotic behavior, as Burnham's wife starts to go off the deep
end, she shows up at a firing range.
</P>
<P>
   5. God/the Life Force is a white plastic bag blowing in the
wind. Yessiree, I think we've got Oscar on the line!
</P>
<P>
   Are there nice touches? Yes. The teenage Ricky Fitts and
Lester's daughter, Jane, are terrific characters. True, they hate
their parents and they loathe modern society, but they've got
options _ money, his unashamedly earned in the drug trade _ and
they've got each other. Their characters are as well written as
everyone seems to think the rest of the movie is.
</P>
<P>
   Onto Ricky's spindly shoulders has been loaded the film's tinny
Message. Has the boy really tuned in to ``this incredibly
benevolent force who wanted me to know that there was no reason to
be afraid''? Or is that just the G-13 _ the US government's
genetically engineered marijuana _ talking? I'll let you be the
judge of that.
</P>
<P>
   Hollywood is agog with this ``uncompromising'' portrayal of
American society. But, in fact, it is a highly compromised
Hollywood fantasy of what life must be like in the Forbidden Zone,
those horrid, soulless suburbs where no self-respecting director or
screenwriter would live. Essentially gay, essentially nihilistic,
informed by a penny-Zenny spirituality that would make a
Scientologist blush, ``American Beauty'' is big-budget, Technicolor
junk.
</P>
<P>
   Arty junk; probably Oscar-winning junk. But junk nonetheless.

 WINNING AN OSCAR WON'T MAKE ROBERT RICHARDSON ANY LESS INTENSE

 By JOHN KOCH  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOURNE, Mass. _ He's jumped out of airplanes and filmed with
bullets whizzing by his head, but the thought of going to Sunday
night's Academy Awards, where he's nominated for an Oscar, fills
him with fear. So cinematographer Robert Richardson plans to hole
up at home on the Cape, watching the telecast with his family.
</P>
<P>
   This is not because he's already the jaded owner of one golden
trophy, the 1992 Oscar he won for the original camerawork on Oliver
Stone's ``JFK.'' It has nothing do with his conviction that he
won't win Sunday for his work on ``Snow Falling on Cedars.'' Nor is
he a cameraman's version of the politically sensitive Marlon Brando
or George C. Scott, both of whom re-
</P>
<P>
   fused to accept their statuettes.
</P>
<P>
   The 44-year-old director of photography (or DP) describes
himself as mischievous, a kind of evil prankster. And depending on
his expression, he can look the part, with his pointed beard,
devilishly arched eyebrows, and mane of prematurely white hair. But
he's not jesting about his phobic dread. ``It's too intense,'' he
says, comparing an on-site awards experience to something ``near
death.'' Attending the Oscars or other awards ceremonies when he's
a nominee makes him sick, Richardson says. After going to the
Oscars the first time he was nominated, for ``Platoon,'' Richardson
vowed: never again. Presenter Richard Gere accepted the ``JFK''
statuette for him.
</P>
<P>
   Richardson is open and curious about his own psychology, and
this searching quality makes him a close observer of his creative
impulses. He has shot approximately 20 films, 13 with Stone, the
rest mostly with other top directors like Martin Scorsese, John
Sayles, Errol Morris, and Barry Levinson. But the word that often
comes to his mind as he reflects on his admirable body of work is
``panic.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not sure why I'm so vulnerable,'' he says, nursing a cup
of coffee. When shooting a film, he says, he suffers through the
nights, restively reliving yesterday's shoot and agonizing over
tomorrow's. He speaks of ``panic attacks all night long'' and
trying to ``numb'' his nerves with sleeping pills.
</P>
<P>
   Panic seems misplaced in the tranquil interview setting _ a
high-ceilinged sitting room in the comfortable if eccentric home
Richardson shares with his wife and two daughters. It's an
Italianate eight-bedroom ``cottage'' built by a Boston banker at
the turn of the previous century on a private island near Monument
Beach. As we talk, late winter snow swirls over Buzzards Bay and
frills the gray sky like a scene from ``Snow Falling on Cedars.''
It's hard to believe this gifted and acclaimed DP (four Oscar
nominations, among others honors) both harbors and frankly reveals
so much insecurity. Still, he values his achievements. He thinks
``Snow Falling on Cedars'' was a beautiful film, and credits the
vision of director Scott Hicks and then his own creative
contributions. But ``it's very rare that a film will win visually
that hasn't been nominated for best picture. Things are latched,
it's sad,'' he says. ``Cedars' '' only nomination was for best
cinematography, and, Richardson says, `` `American Beauty' is
running hot.''
</P>
<P>
   While he was filming ``Snow Falling on Cedars,'' Richardson's
nocturnal uneasiness abated _ for the first time, he didn't agonize
every night. On the other hand, the subjects of his alarm were
``much larger issues,'' such as the fear of losing his creative
touch completely. Burnout will ``get me,'' he says, and he worries
about the eventual decline of the mature directors who employ him
and the advent of ``a much younger group.''
</P>
<P>
   He believes his sense of fragility is connected to his
creativity and that it feeds it. It ``keeps me constantly wanting
to change.''
</P>
<P>
   His fear, then, has a function. So perhaps it shouldn't sound
too paradoxical that Richardson is attracted to danger. He used to
parachute out of airplanes for fun. He operated a camera in the
face of live gunfire in the '80s, filming combat footage in El
Salvador for a PBS ``Frontline.'' (The experience prepared him for
his first job as director of photography, on Oliver Stone's intense
1986 fictional treatment of Central American strife, ``Salvador.'')
</P>
<P>
   The flip side of the fear is a kind of spell or ecstasy the
cinematographer says he experiences behind the camera.
``Extraordinarily concentrated emotion drives me forward,'' he
says, to a point where he virtually loses consciousness. It's a
``zone'' where the world falls away: ``With my eye up to the
eyepiece, I'm there.'' He can't describe it more precisely, he
says. ``I blank out. The closest thing I would say would be the
first time I jumped out of an airplane. There's a blank spot from
when I left the plane to when my parachute was open: Time doesn't
exist in that space.''
</P>
<P>
   Resisting scripts he considers less than first-rate, Richardson
shot ``Bringing Out the Dead'' a year and a half ago, right after
``Cedars,'' and hasn't done a feature since. So, as he often does
between films, he directs commercials, and recently filmed
campaigns for United Airlines and the US Army. He takes the work
seriously: ``I bleed to make these things as good as possible.''
</P>
<P>
   He's away from home working far more often than he's on the Cape
with his wife, writer and independent filmmaker Monona Wali, and
their children. ``Monona has basically become a saint,'' he says.
Still, why does he insist on a base so far from the movie capital
of the world?
</P>
<P>
   As with other aspects of Richardson's life, there appears to be
a long braid of complex motives, his boyhood in Brewster, where his
parents operated the Cape Cod Sea Camps, being just a fraction of
the story. But one thing is certain: Much of what Richardson does
is determined by what, and how, he sees.
</P>
<P>
   After a near family tragedy seven years ago when they lived in
Los Angeles, the Richardsons scouted the Northeast for a home,
starting in Maine. The moment he saw the big stucco house on
Buzzards Bay, then unimproved and framed by thickets of brambles,
Richardson was sold. ``It was love at first sight, the drive up the
winding dirt road, the surrounding water.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked if he tends to view the world in cinematic terms,
Richardson describes his unique perspective. ``I put elements
together. Looking at you, I see the chair, the way you're pushed
against the windows, and I see the flowers behind your head. I
don't see them in one image: I see them in a whole series of boxes,
almost as if I were trying to put a story together.'' His
perception functions this way all the time, ``and I think it's
because my brain doesn't work in a linear fashion.''
</P>
<P>
   When he was a Rhode Island School of Design film student in the
late '70s, he chose cinematography because he didn't think his mind
was developed enough to be a director. But recently, he's been
angling to bring his practiced eye to a movie of his own. In 1998,
he signed to direct the film version of author James Ellroy's
novel, ``White Jazz'' (Ellroy also wrote ``L.A. Confidential'').
The two have been conferring about Ellroy's script and hoping the
project, produced by Nick Nolte, who is slated to star in it, will
soon move forward. Richardson isn't optimistic. ``That's why
directors go absolutely crazy _ the development of a project is
highly unpredictable and doesn't make tremendous sense. It may
happen, but not in my time frame.''
</P>
<P>
   No one seems to know better than Richardson that the moviemaking
life is a notoriously capricious, costly and nerve-damaging game of
chance. If he doesn't get a shot at directing a feature film,
``I'll survive,'' he says. Then he leaves the sitting room to
conduct a tour of his fine, solid old house while the wind lashes
the water and the snow continues falling.

MAUDLIN SCRIPT MARS `HERE ON EARTH' 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)

 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
HERE ON EARTH 
Directed by: Mark Piznarski 
Screenplay by: Michael Seitzman 
Starring: Chris Klein, Leelee Sobieski, Josh Hartnett, Michael
Rooker, Annie Corley, Bruce Greenwood, Annette O'Toole 
Running time: 96 minutes 
Rated: PG-13 (some sensuality and thematic elements) 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Three appealing performers are lumbered with material that
doesn't measure up to them in ``Here on Earth.'' It's a tepid
tearjerker about young love bridging the traditional town-gown
divide in a farm town adjoining a flossy prep school. It asks us to
believe that Chris Klein's spoiled preppy isn't the shallow twit he
seems when he destroys the town's only diner with the new Mercedes
his rich dad got him for graduation. Leelee Sobieski, as the
daughter of the woman who owned the diner, senses he's a poetic
soul and proves it to herself by sneaking up on him in the woods
and hearing him recite Robert Frost to himself. So moved is she
that she drops the nice local boy (John Hartnett) she's known for
years to concentrate on the arrogant rich kid who's been sentenced
to stick around town and help rebuild the diner for which his
absent dad is paying.
</P>
<P>
   The preppies-on-parade stuff gives way to a prickly
getting-acquainted period, egged on by such clumsy devices as the
rejected guy's kid sister looking the rich kid over and saying, ``I
think he's hot.'' What's jarring is the contemporary ring of the
term because even though the car was new, too, the film has the
feel of something very dated, something immersed in the formulas of
the late '50s and early '60s. Of course, in one sense, the guy is
hot. His temperature goes up every time he thinks about himself,
and this self-styled babe magnet thinks about himself all the time.
Given her tender and perceptive attentions, he thaws, and begins
reciprocating her interest. Before it's all over, she accompanies
him back to his family mansion and learns what vulnerable piece of
personal history his facade _ she knew it was a facade _ is
concealing.
</P>
<P>
   If anyone can tiptoe around the rich kid's sulks and not
embarrass himself in a scene in which he gets drunk and talks to
cows, it should be Klein, who played the nice-guy candidate in
``Election.'' He does intermittently reduce the animosity his
character generates. Sobieski has softly lyrical moments when she
makes us believe her character is experiencing first love. And
Hartnett affectingly projects raw pain as the jilted one. But the
prefab writing finally self-destructs in a cop-out ending that's as
convenient as it is sentimental. It's one thing to be retro,
especially given the film's smalltown setting (set in
Massachusetts, it actually was filmed in Minnesota). But the
predictability, calculation, and compromise that end up swamping
``Here on Earth'' would face losing odds in any time period.

<P>
   The producers of ``Whatever It Takes,'' in the apparent belief
that it doesn't take much, settle for the most obvious load of
formula stuff in a numbingly cliched teen comedy pivoting on a lot
of plastic angst over who'll take whom to the prom. The best thing
in it is Marla Sokoloff, partly because her smart, secure,
straight-shooting character doesn't fit the cliched mold of the
kind of girl high-school guys chase. Still, she's the one who
catches the eye of the school's self-styled babe magnet, played
with suitable obnoxiousness by James Franco. In the film, the guy
may be a cliched jock, but he at least has taste.
</P>
<P>
   The intelligent, sensitive guy played by Shane West, on the
other hand, is crazy about Jodi Lyn O'Keefe's most popular (but not
most secure) girl. There are the usual nerdy sidekicks, the usual
boneheaded scheming, the usual physical comedy _ some involving a
girls' shower room, some a ``Titanic'' caper. The usual, the usual,
the usual. The spectacle of the guys sorting out their feelings,
and the girls killing time until they do, is less than
electrifying. Was high school really this dumb? Could be. But even
in a genre that aims low, ``Whatever It Takes'' is pretty lame
stuff. Already it seems to be passing with the speed of light into
the limbo of utterly forgettable who-will-I-take-to-the-prom?
movies.

`BEAUTY' DISPLAYS HOLLYWOOD'S NEW CLICHES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ALEX BEAM  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Perhaps you missed it; sexagenarian movie critic Rex Reed was
arraigned last week on charges of shoplifting three CDs (Mel Torme,
Carmen McRae, and Peggy Lee) from a Tower Records. Bantering with
reporters outside Manhattan Criminal Court, Reed protested his
innocence and worked in his plug for best picture at this Sunday's
Oscar ceremonies: ``I hope `American Beauty' wins.''
</P>
<P>
   Reed's not the only one. The critics loved ``Beauty.'' ``A
quirky and disturbing take on modern American life energized by
bravura performances,'' wrote the LA Times' Kenneth Turan. Like the
movie itself, David Denby's New Yorker review was so over-the-top,
you had to wonder if he was kidding. ``By far the strongest
American film of the year . . . rich, brilliant, unnerving . . .
mesmerizing hyperreality . . . the editing discovers . . . the
hidden connections among things.'' Waiter! Something cool for Mr.
Denby, please . . .
</P>
<P>
   Yes, I pretty much hated it. Maybe I took it too personally, as
I am the object of contemporary tastemakers' contempt _ a married,
white, heterosexual suburban parent. But I have to ask _ is there
any dime-store banality that writer Alan Ball and director Sam
Mendes didn't stuff inside this two-hour celluloid whale?
</P>
<P>
   1. Heterosexual white couples who live in suburban homes with
white picket fences _ as opposed to cool places, like LA's west
side _ are sexually frustrated adulterers. Natch.
</P>
<P>
   2. The worker is alienated from Evil Capitalism. ``Beauty''
protagonist Lester Burnham works as a self-described ``whore for
the advertising industry,'' which Hollywood purports to disdain.
Except when it is used to promote sensitive, cutting-edge material
like ``American Beauty,'' that is. The film's producers are
reported to have spent $775,000 in trade industry ads alone,
puffing their product for an Oscar.
</P>
<P>
   3. Capitalism Is Evil, the Sequel: Burnham's boss pays for sex
with the company credit card _ doesn't everybody? The script,
personally approved for production by Steven Spielberg, spends a
good 20 minutes mocking the commercialism of the hateful real
estate business. As opposed to the public-spirited movie business,
I guess.
</P>
<P>
   4. You're in the military? You must be queer. All those men
packed in together . . . those guns, with the long barrels. In the
character of Marine colonel Frank Fitts, the filmmakers have scored
a twofer _ he's a militaristic homophobe, and he's gay! So I guess
that makes him (see cliche number one) an adulterous parent. It
gets better still: He's a militaristic, gay, Nazi-loving homophobe.
He probably wears fur, too.
</P>
<P>
   The original script had a scene in which Colonel Fitts watched
his male lover die in Vietnam. That might have been useful to roll
in yet another Hollywood cliche _ you know, the Vietnam War/loss of
innocence thing. (Cf ``Rambo,'' ``The Rock,'' and everything in
between.) In case you missed the connection between guns and
psychotic behavior, as Burnham's wife starts to go off the deep
end, she shows up at a firing range.
</P>
<P>
   5. God/the Life Force is a white plastic bag blowing in the
wind. Yessiree, I think we've got Oscar on the line!
</P>
<P>
   Are there nice touches? Yes. The teenage Ricky Fitts and
Lester's daughter, Jane, are terrific characters. True, they hate
their parents and they loathe modern society, but they've got
options _ money, his unashamedly earned in the drug trade _ and
they've got each other. Their characters are as well written as
everyone seems to think the rest of the movie is.
</P>
<P>
   Onto Ricky's spindly shoulders has been loaded the film's tinny
Message. Has the boy really tuned in to ``this incredibly
benevolent force who wanted me to know that there was no reason to
be afraid''? Or is that just the G-13 _ the US government's
genetically engineered marijuana _ talking? I'll let you be the
judge of that.
</P>
<P>
   Hollywood is agog with this ``uncompromising'' portrayal of
American society. But, in fact, it is a highly compromised
Hollywood fantasy of what life must be like in the Forbidden Zone,
those horrid, soulless suburbs where no self-respecting director or
screenwriter would live. Essentially gay, essentially nihilistic,
informed by a penny-Zenny spirituality that would make a
Scientologist blush, ``American Beauty'' is big-budget, Technicolor
junk.
</P>
<P>
   Arty junk; probably Oscar-winning junk. But junk nonetheless.

NO DOUBT: BACK ON TRACK 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By STEVE MORSE  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The public sheds no tears for a successful band trying to follow
up a top-selling album. Oh, are we supposed to feel sorry for them?
From the band's point of view, though, it can be a daunting task to
grab the brass ring again. Writer's block can creep in. So can
self-doubt, which the ironically named No Doubt has fought ever
since it began more than a decade ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's really been interesting this time around because we've
never been in this position of having expectations,'' says No Doubt
singer Gwen Stefani. ``We did a press conference in New York and 50
people flew in from all over to listen to our record and ask us
questions. It still blows my mind that people care.''
</P>
<P>
   No Doubt jumped from obscure club act to amphitheater headliner
with its last album, ``Tragic Kingdom,'' which sold 6 million
copies and spun off three Top 10 hits in ``Don't Speak,'' ``Just a
Girl,'' and ``Spiderwebs.'' It also made a star of the videogenic,
navel-exposing Stefani, though it didn't make writing the new
album, ``Return From Saturn,'' any easier.
</P>
<P>
   The new disc _ an exciting progression that takes the band's
basic ska-rock sound and expands it in many directions _ comes out
April 11.
</P>
<P>
   The album climaxes two years of false starts and a switch in
producers. The low point came when No Doubt was in Stefani's home
in the Hollywood Hills, stumped for ideas, while having to listen
to the Red Hot Chili Peppers _ their onetime LA club idols _
perform reams of new music up the street, where Flea, the bassist
for Chili Peppers, lives.
</P>
<P>
   ``As we were trying to write at Gwen's house, we could hear them
in their garage just bashing out all these new jams every afternoon
for a whole week,'' says No Doubt guitarist Tom Dumont. ``We just
felt so inadequate. We couldn't write anything and there they were,
jamming and having fun.''
</P>
<P>
   But No Doubt got its act together, helped by a shift in
producers from Matthew Wilder (who did ``Tragic Kingdom'') to Glen
Ballard, who is best known for Alanis Morissette's ``Jagged Little
Pill.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Glen was pretty much meant to be,'' says Stefani. ``It was
weird, because we had been working on the album for about a year
before we met him. We just really needed to find the right person,
and he was recommended. He didn't seem like the obvious choice to
us, but we had meetings with five different producers one day and
he was one of them. We all walked out saying, `That's the guy.'
He's just a really amazing person, a real kind of peaceful
personality. He's inspiring and hard-working. He pretty much
brought all our confidence back and helped us sort through the
songs we had at that point. We couldn't tell which ones were good
and bad, you know? But he helped pick the ones that stood out.''
</P>
<P>
   Wilder, the band's former producer, had started working on the
new record, but ``first of all, we didn't have the songs,'' says
Stefani. ``And second of all, I think we were just too comfortable
with Matthew. We needed to get outside our comfort zone and kind of
push ourselves a little bit. Sometimes you need to do something
different to get something different.''
</P>
<P>
   The difference is a greater depth in musical and lyrical
content, from the subtly sarcastic first single, ``Ex-Girlfriend''
(with Stefani singing, ``You know it makes me sick to know I'm on
that list, but I should have thought of that before we kissed'') to
high-quality rock, ska-rock, and funk, plus more love ballads than
before. One ballad, ``Too Late,'' has the playfully possessive
line, ``I just want to take you from everyone and keep you
stashed.''
</P>
<P>
   The album rocks enough to hold the interest of the teen audience
that craved the band last time but is also thought-provoking enough
to entice more adult fans. And Stefani, who writes most of the
lyrics, has kept her inimitable wit in songs like ``Artificial
Sweetener'' and ``Magic's in the Makeup.''
</P>
<P>
   ``In No Doubt's past, before `Tragic Kingdom,' even maybe during
`Tragic Kingdom,' it was all about energy and having a really
pumped-up sound so people would get off on us live,'' says Dumont.
``It was almost the energy of punk with more of a melodic approach.
This time, the idea was not just trying to get things upbeat and in
your face, but to use a little more dynamics and worry less about
the tempo and more about what the lyrics were saying and how we
could best bring out their emotional content.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know for Gwen, between recording `Tragic Kingdom' and this
record, she learned a lot,'' Dumont adds. ``Instead of singing on
10 the whole time, she was able to have a lot more subtlety.''
</P>
<P>
   Stefani shines most on ``Simple Kind of Life,'' the first tune
she has written entirely by herself. ``All I ever wanted was a
simple man . . . all I ever wanted was a simple life,'' sings
Stefani, who in real life has been dating heartthrob singer Gavin
Rossdale of the band Bush for the past four years.
</P>
<P>
   As for the new album title, that's Stefani's idea as well. She
just turned 30 and was looking for a way to embrace that age rather
than run from it.
</P>
<P>
   Astronomers say it takes Saturn 29 years to circle the sun, she
explains. ``So from the time you're born to the time it returns is
a time where you go through a confusion and you second-guess
everything in your life and clear away things that are holding you
back from growing and maturing and moving on and getting better. I
feel a lot clearer now. It's such a huge accomplishment for us to
be able to write this record and feel we have grown this much. It's
like the peak of our ongoing dream.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; TOULOUSE, France _ This should be the best of times for US
Airways.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday, the airline showed off its newest aircraft here, the
Airbus A330, which will become the backbone of the nation's 6th
largest airline, the dominant carrier in the Northeast. The
airplane will serve North Atlantic routes as US Airways expands its
three east coast hubs, Pittsburgh, Charlotte, N.C., and
Philadelphia, where the airline is also building a $350-million
international terminal and increasing its seven daily overseas
flights.
</P>
<P>
   But the flowing champagne and good cheer that accompanied the
unveiling of the Airbus A330 in the US Airways color scheme could
not mask the labor problem facing the nation's 5th busiest airline
with 55.8 million passengers last year. The carrier's more than
9,000 flight attendants have been working without a contract for
more than three years, and they threaten to begin random job
walkouts on busy routes beginning Saturday. Rather than subject
customers to the uncertainty of wildcat walkouts, management has
vowed to shut the airline down if an agreement cannot be reached.
</P>
<P>
   Negotiations with the National Mediation Board continued
Thursday, but barring an agreement or continuation of talks past
the deadline, the airline will shut down unless President Clinton
intervenes. Boston's Logan International Airport will be
particularly hard hit, where US Airways controls about 20 percent
of the market.
</P>
<P>
   Stephen M. Wolf, the airline's chairman, and chief executive
officer Rakesh Gangwal, who joined came to the airline in 1996
after running United, developed a plan to reduce the airline's
staggering operating costs by wringing concessions from labor
groups. In return, management promised they would spend billions
growing the airline. Otherwise, Wolf said, US Airways would shrink
to become a regional player.
</P>
<P>
   The airline said it would offer its workers ``parity plus one''
meaning they would get what workers at the big four _ United,
American, Delta and Northwest _ got, plus one 1 percent. Contracts
were reached with pilots and mechanics, but negotiations with the
Association of Flight Attendants have gone on, and a 30-day cooling
off period ends at 12:01 a.m. Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   There are an array of issues at dispute beyond salary, including
management's desire to change work rules which would, among other
things, make scheduling more efficient, and limit sick leave. The
union wants better pensions and the airline to recognize the Family
Medical Leave Act.
</P>
<P>
   Because management reached parity plus one with pilots and
mechanics, it is unlikely it would budge with the flight
attendants.
</P>
<P>
   While in Toulouse to view the new A330, Wolf said the airline
was ``in active negotiations and we are committed to getting an
agreement.'' In an interview, however, he vowed to shut the airline
down rather than have passengers face the uncertainty of flight
cancellations.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is a very unattractive thing to do, but it is the better of
two options,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   After making more than $530 million in profit in 1998, the
airline made $197 million in 1999, but lost money in the last two
quarters. Wolf said the airline lost money in January, and it is
not likely it will make money in the first quarter, or second
quarter, since the threat of a shutdown has had an adverse affect
on bookings into the second quarter.
</P>
<P>
   ``Assuming we get a resolution, we look promisingly toward the
second half of the year,'' said Wolf.
</P>
<P>
   But even with a flight attendant pact, it will not be a
turbulant-free flight for US Airways.
</P>
<P>
   The carrier has a cost-per-seat mile, an industry standard for
measuring cost, above 12 cents. Southwest Airlines _ US Airways
main low-cost competitor on the east coast _ has a cost above 7
cents, and Delta's cost is just under 9 cents.
</P>
<P>
   One reason costs are so high at US Airways is because it has one
of the most varied fleets, with seven different types of aircraft.
Training costs for cockpit crews, which must be certified in each
aircraft type, is exhorbitant. If a maintenance or scheduling
problem creates a delay, that problem can be compounded if the only
spare airplane is a different type, or another flight crew
certified to fly the airplane is not immediately available.
</P>
<P>
   When US Airways reached an agreement with pilots in 1996, the
airline went ahead with a plan to convert its entire fleet to
Airbus aircraft. If all orders are realized _ more than 150 are
firm _ the airline will fly about 400 A320 aircraft and 30 A330
airplanes.
</P>
<P>
   It is, in effect, a gamble of about $17 billion, but one airline
officials are confident will save US Airways more than $100 million
annually in operation and training costs. Airbus planes have the
same cockpit, so when a pilot is certified to fly an A320, they can
also fly the A319 and A321. With minimal training, they can fly the
A330 and A340. US Airways is using the A320 already on the shuttle
and main lines. For the shuttle, the new planes use half the fuel
of the Boeing 727s they replace and are so quiet that US Airways
can leave Washington, D.C. at 6 a.m. _ a full hour before curfew is
lifted on noisy planes. The airline will also save millions in
parts inventories.
</P>
<P>
   Darryl Jenkins, director of the Aviation Institute at George
Washington University, thinks buying all Airbus is a smart move,
but cautioned that US Airways still has its ``work cut out for them
because of their costs and they face so much competition.''
</P>
<P>
   In addition to Southwest, JetBlue, a low-cost start-up with more
than $130 million in venture capital has begun flying from New
York's John F. Kennedy International Airport to Florida and plans
on expanding throughout the east coast over the next two years. And
US Airways is restricted by its pilot contract to 35 regional jets
while other airlines, Continental especially, are moving to replace
their turboprops with so-called RJs (regional jets) which
passengers prefer. Wolf said the airline is negotiating with pilots
for another 35 regional jets, and wants many more.
</P>
<P>
   One way in which US Airways has responded is with its low-cost
MetroJet. After some tinkering, US Airways is focusing on using
MetroJet on Northeast-Florida routes, freeing up main line aircraft
to support hub operations.
</P>
<P>
   US Airways also faces stiff competiton from main line carriers,
especially Delta and United, which is building up a hub at Dulles
International Airport, a short distance from US Airways' corporate
headquarters in Arlington, Va.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are the largest carrier on the east coast and very well
positioned, but we do face increasing competition,'' Wolf said.
``United is growing at Dulles and Delta has clear focus on us.''
</P>
<P>
   US Airways response is to win competitive labor agreements, reap
the savings from Airbus aircraft, improve hubs and grow
internationally, a huge profit center for airlines. The centerpiece
of that international strategy is the A330. US Airways is the first
American carrier to have the A330, and the only carrier to offer
on-demand video and audio at every seat, even in coach.
</P>
<P>
   But the airline is focusing on premium class service for
business travelers across the Atlantic. US Airways' award-winning
Envoy premium class has a menu developed with Philadelphia's
renowned Le Bec Fin restaurant. Flight attendants recieve training
from the Culinary Institute of America. And unlike Delta, which did
away with first class, US Airways will have six seats in a first
class section on the A330.
</P>
<P>
   US Airways officials view its Charlotte, N.C. hub as a
convenient, less-crowded alternative to Delta's fortress in
Atlanta. The airline is boosting its international service from
Charlotte, which now serves London, with daily flights to Paris
starting April 13 and daily flights to Frankfurt in May.
</P>
<P>
   The airline gave up its international service from Boston when
it applied for and failed to get Boston-Paris service. The
Department of Transportation awarded that service to American,
leaving US Airways only with Boston-Frankfurt service. Officials
decided to use the aircraft for international service from
Philadelphia, but want to return to Boston. At Logan, US Airways is
locked in fierce competition with Delta. Delta is building a new
terminal and US Airways completed one $30 million expansion that
added 100,000 square feet to Terminal B and is beginning another
$33 million expansion that will add 65,000 square feet and four new
gates.
</P>
<P>
   ``Boston remains a significant market for us and international
flying makes sense from there,'' said Lawrence M. Nagin, executive
vice president of US Airways.

PARKER GIVES SPENSER A CHANCE TO HORSE AROUND 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RICHARD DYER  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
HUGGER MUGGER 
By Robert B. Parker. 
G. P. Putnam's Sons, 307 pp. $23.95. 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Robert B. Parker has launched a couple of new mystery series
featuring Jesse Stone, North Shore policeman and recovering
alcoholic, and Sunny Randall, a feisty female shamus. But he
remains as loyal as loyal to Spenser as his readers do.
</P>
<P>
   Spenser's new adventure departs from Parker's patented formula,
but then most of the good ones have. Spenser doesn't cook this time
and doesn't spend much time in Boston restaurants. In fact, Boston
is not the primary venue: Most of the story takes place in
horse-raising country, Lamarr, Georgia, and the action also takes
Spenser to San Francisco, Atlanta, and Saratoga, N.Y. A few members
of the regular local supporting cast appear in walk-on or offstage
roles, but Hawk is absent _ he's flown to Paris with a professor.
</P>
<P>
   Susan is still around to be sensitive and sexy; she gives
Spenser somebody to think lustfully about and to talk dirty to.
Spenser chivalrously resists the advances of drunken Southern
belles, but it's probably a good thing that Susan flies in from
time to time for reinforcement.
</P>
<P>
   Hugger Mugger is a horse, a potential Triple Crown winner, and
he's in danger. Somebody is shooting horses down in the Three
Fillies Stables, so Walter Clive, owner of the stables, has come
looking for help, and he's come to the right man. Spenser's
attention is engaged by the situation _ and by the knees and ankles
of Clive's youngest daughter, Penny, who has been running the
business. Penny shows up in Spenser's office with eyes ``the color
of morning glories,'' and wearing pearls and white gloves.
</P>
<P>
   Down in Lamarr, Spenser meets the rest of Clive's family,
including Penny's sisters, SueSue and Stonie, and their husbands,
hard-drinking Pud and Cord, who looks like a polo player, although
Spenser confesses he's never met a polo player. Before very long,
Spenser feels he's stepped into a Tennessee Williams play. People
drink a little bit too much, and their sexual histories are very
complex and intertangled. Spenser must procede warily over mined
ground; the stable's official security firm is not exactly happy to
find him on its turf.
</P>
<P>
   Another horse gets shot, and then a human does. Penny
regrettfully removes Spenser from the case. Spenser returns to
Boston, and tackles another situation, a 5-chapter inset short
story about a nanny and her boyfriend-stalker. The situation, when
Spenser gets to the bottom of it, goes to show that nothing is what
it seems to be at first _ a lesson that will prove useful when
another member of the Clive family appears to hire him to look once
more into the trouble down south.
</P>
<P>
   Of course Spenser sorts it all through, with a little help from
his friends, and some shrewd character analysis from Susan. He
punches out a couple of guys, does a little breaking and entering,
visits a gay bar, reads Jonathan Lear on Freud, and seems to enjoy
letting good people surprise him; the bad guys never get the
chance. Spenser's moral compass is unerring, and it has nothing to
do with political correctness. Some of the rich and snobbish turn
out to have generous hearts, but not all of them. A heartless
fast-track single-mother career woman gets what's coming to her,
and so does a flower power hippie named Sherry Lark. Sherry takes
her seat in a San Francisco restaurant and orders herbal tea, as an
Spenser notes, ``It was unfortunately apparent that she was
braless.'' Susan has her work cut out for her: Spenser is
incorrigible.
</P>
<P>
   Most of Parker's gay characters turn out to be sympathetic; in
this area, as in many others, Parker breaks the mold of popular
fiction.
</P>
<P>
   There's some amusing banter in ``Hugger Mugger,'' a bit of
baseball lore (Spenser ponders the relative merits of Johnny Bench
and Roy Campanella), and a little more suspense than usual. Parker
has worked on this one, and he makes very few wrong moves.
</P>
<P>
   Spenser does swagger because he's wearing his Clubman after
shave, but Susan puts him in his place. `` `Are you wearing Club
Man again, or have they just painted the radiators?' `You fear Club
Man, don't you,' I said. `Because you're afraid that after just a
single whiff, your libido will jump out of your psyche and begin to
break-dance right here on the rug.' `That's probably it,' she
said.''
</P>
<P>
   Now if they'd just both learn that Pinaud uses one word to
identify Clubman, that aphrodisiac aroma that barbershops smell
like. . . .

CLEMENS EYES A FITTING CAP TO HIS CAREER 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By GORDON EDES  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   TAMPA _ When the topic of his future Hall of Fame millinery was
broached earlier this spring, Roger Clemens told reporters he hoped
to go to Cooperstown wearing a Yankees cap.
</P>
<P>
   All those years in Boston, measured against one championship
season in New York, and the Rocket wants to be immortalized in
pinstripes? Perhaps, it was suggested, Clemens might take a cue
from Carlton Fisk, who also harbored some bitterness against the
Sox for years but eventually opted for a ``B'' on his bust, a year
after Sox general manager Dan Duquette hired him as a special
assistant.
</P>
<P>
   Who knows? Maybe the Duke has a front office job waiting for
Clemens, too.
</P>
<P>
   ``I doubt that, I really doubt that,'' Clemens said Thursday
morning. ``The guy didn't want me as a player, I don't think he'll
want me as an assistant. When the guy running the show doesn't want
you around, you won't be around.
</P>
<P>
   Clemens didn't close the door on having a change of heart. There
are a few things he feels obliged to do in New York, he said, to
seal the deal.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm hoping to accomplish some more things in this uniform,''
he said. ``Maybe winning another championship, maybe winning 20
games, winning my 300th game, the Cy Young (Award) again.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been talking to some people close to me. Reggie (Jackson)
has been hammering me about it. We'll see what happens.''
</P>
<P>
   He has won his World Series ring _ he'll get it sometime in the
next month _ and while he wants another, Clemens admits that
winning 300 has become important to him.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want to push the pedal, push the envelope, see if it can
happen,'' he said. ``I hear every day that myself, (Greg) Maddux
have a shot at it. I know it's going to be hard.''
</P>
<P>
   With 247 career victories, he's 53 wins away. How long will it
take him to hit 300? ``I hope I can do it in about (2002),'' he
said. ``I hope so.''
</P>
<P>
   To meet that timetable, Clemens would have to average 18 wins
for the next three seasons, by which time he'll be 40. A tall order
for a guy who went 14-10 last year, had the highest ERA (4.60) of
his career, and was bothered for a good chunk of the season by a
sore hamstring.
</P>
<P>
   But Clemens, who Thursday downplayed his leg problems, doesn't
see the same signs of slippage others did last season. ``Nobody
said that here,'' he said. ``I'll be happy to go 14-10 again if
they give me the ball again in postseason. I've won 20 games many
times, ERA titles, individual awards, but nothing (compares) to
having a big, shiny ring.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think I have a single thing to prove. I've just got to
be ready. That's half the battle. I have to do my work and be
ready.''
</P>
<P>
   Clemens seemed amused when told about this week's Sports
Illustrated cover predicting the Red Sox will win the World Series.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's good, that's great,'' he said. ``New century. I'll have
to call up a couple of my close friends (in Boston). They're the
ones who'll shoot it down. They won't believe it.''
</P>
<P>
   It was Clemens who was shot down on his last appearance in
Boston, when his much-hyped duel of the century against Pedro
Martinez turned to dust when he was driven from the mound after
just two-plus innings in the Sox' 13-1 win in Game 3 of the
American League Championship Series last October. After the game,
Clemens's wife, Debbie, ripped Sox fans for the way they taunted
the man who once owned their town.
</P>
<P>
   Clemens said he thought Debbie was just exchanging pleasantries
with Globe columnist Dan Shaughnessy after the game. ``That's the
way I left it,'' he said. ``He said hello to my mother and was
talking to my wife. Then she came and told me she thought she said
some things that might be in the paper.''
</P>
<P>
   He insists he was unaffected by the hostile reception. ``I know
it didn't get to me,'' he said. ``She was sitting there and heard
it . . . I take offense at that only if it carries over to my
family, and to my boys.''
</P>
<P>
   He paid as much attention to the negative vibes, he said, as he
did to the numbers Martinez put up last season for the Red Sox,
which eclipsed Clemens's spectacular 1986 season, when he went 24-4
with a 2.48 ERA.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know my numbers,'' he said. ``Why would I look at his?
That's not that important right now. That's something you look at
down the road.''
</P>
<P>
   Clemens was asked if he ever thought about wearing a Sox uniform
again. He shook his head.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm hoping to finish right here,'' he said. ``That's the
reason why we came here.''

THIS IS TYLER'S TIME 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MARK BLAUDSCHUN  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ Suddenly, it's different for Elton Tyler. No
more wondering what it's going to take for the 6-foot-9-inch junior
from the University of Miami to develop some consistency in his
game.
</P>
<P>
   The maddening part for Tyler, who arrived at Miami from via
Boston College (albeit briefly), is that when you see performances
like the one he turned in against Ohio State Sunday in the second
round of the NCAA tournament, you ask why he can't do it every
time.
</P>
<P>
   Tyler, who will be part of the Hurricane contingent facing Tulsa
in the South Regional semifinal, has a simple explanation.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just had to get confidence,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The effort against Ohio State, a 75-62 victory, should have
taken care of that.
</P>
<P>
   Twenty points, nine rebounds, and the ultimate compliment from
Ohio State coach Jim O'Brien, who recruited Tyler while at BC but
then ran into an admissions snafu that set off a chain of events
that resulted in Tyler being at Miami and O'Brien at Ohio State.
</P>
<P>
   ``Elton Tylers are the type of guy you could spend 100 years in
this business coaching,'' said O'Brien. ``Miami was very fortunate.
He's a wonderful guy and I'm happy it's gone good for him.''
</P>
<P>
   O'Brien's succinct comment after Tyler helped send the Buckeyes
on an early vacation: ``We had no answer for him.''
</P>
<P>
   No one really has in the last part of the Miami season, which
has lasted longer than most expected.
</P>
<P>
   After playing up and down most of his junior season, Tyler has
picked it up in the last few weeks.
</P>
<P>
   It began with Miami's final regular-season game, a home win over
St. John's that earned the Hurricanes a share (with Syracuse) of
the Big East regular-season championship.
</P>
<P>
   During the five-game stretch that includes the St. John's game,
two Big East tournament games, and two NCAA tournament games, Tyler
has averaged 15.6 points and eight rebounds. He scored 20 or more
points twice and was in double figures four times.
</P>
<P>
   Miami coach Leonard Hamilton, who also has become a hot
commodity (he's on the short list of candidates to replace Bobby
Cremins at Georgia Tech), says it's just a matter of maturity.
</P>
<P>
   ``He might not step up every night,'' said Hamilton. ``But he's
making a more concerted effort to come as close as he can each
night in reaching his potential.''
</P>
<P>
   Last season, Tyler showed only sporadic signs of stardom as he
moved in and out of Hamilton's lineup and doghouse.
</P>
<P>
   This season was more of the same, especially at the start. Tyler
scored in double figures in the Hurricanes' first four games, but
could only manage double figures in three of Miami's next 15 games.
</P>
<P>
   Tyler agrees it is a matter of finding a comfort zone. It took a
while for him to get past the disappointment of not going to BC, of
adjusting to new friends and establishing his own identity.
</P>
<P>
   This season also has had its low points. In a regular-season win
over Connecticut, Tyler was doing so little on the court, Hamilton
pulled him aside and chewed him out with a tough-love speech that
apparently worked. Tyler went on a scoring binge with 22 points and
was one of the key figures in a 63-57 victory.
</P>
<P>
   Tyler's regular season wound up being productive, with averages
of 10.4 points and 5.6 rebounds. The postseason has been even
better, with 14.5 points and 8.5 rebounds per game. He has started
all 33 of Miami's games and leads the team in field goal percentage
(.524) and blocks (34).
</P>
<P>
   It's a dramatic upturn from Tyler's first season, when he didn't
start a game, and from last season, when he started only three
times and averaged 11 minutes. He was a part-time player, still
striving for his potential.
</P>
<P>
   Now Tyler and Miami are two wins away from the Final Four and
the confidence is starting to flow.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we've got a good chance,'' Tyler said Thursday of his
team's prospects this weekend. ``As long as we work hard and stay
focused, we have a real good chance.''
</P>
<P>
   Hamilton said he has tried to keep his team focused on what has
worked so far.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've tried very much not to change our approach on what we've
been doing all year,'' said Hamilton. ``You know it's a
one-and-done deal, but we feel we've been successful because we
haven't allowed ourselves to get too far ahead.''
</P>
<P>
   For Miami to advance against a Tulsa team that is every bit as
tough defensively as the 'Canes, Tyler will have to continue to be
aggressive and assertive.
</P>
<P>
   ``Elton is such an unselfish kid,' said Hamilton. ``He just
wants to win and he's not looking for statistics.''
</P>
<P>
   Tyler said Hamilton hasn't played up the game to his team.
</P>
<P>
   ``He basically said that we have to execute on defense and we
have to get our mental focus right,'' Tyler said. ``We know what we
have to do so it shouldn't be that hard to focus on those things. I
think if you're ready to play, you're ready to play. As long as we
have this opportunity, we want to make the best of it.''
</P>
<P>
   Tyler is ready to do that and says he is also past any remorse
about what might have been at BC.
</P>
<P>
   ``We wanted to play together,'' Tyler said of O'Brien's
recruiting class that also included Jonathan DePina (UMass), Mike
Bradley (Kentucky and Villanova), and Adam Allensbach (Clemson).
``We wanted to play for Coach O'Brien and we wanted to go in there
and help BC. Unfortunately it didn't happen.''
</P>
<P>
   It didn't happen at BC, but at Miami Tyler is doing what he, and
O'Brien, thought he could.

A BURST OF ENERGY FOR THE WILDCATS

<P>
   MINNEAPOLIS _ The Wildcats were in trouble.
</P>
<P>
   The University of New Hampshire had knocked off Wisconsin the
night before in the NCAA East Regionals in Albany, and now it was
in against top-seeded Boston University, a team it was still trying
to figure out how to beat in the big games.
</P>
<P>
   This was huge. Lose, and the season was over. Win, and it was on
to the Frozen Four, the lofty place BU knew well and UNH had not
been in 15 years.
</P>
<P>
   They went to overtime. Boston University went on the power play.
</P>
<P>
   Uh, oh.
</P>
<P>
   Enter forward Mike Souza of Wakefield, Mass., and the UNH
penalty killers.
</P>
<P>
   ``The puck turned over and Dan Enders got it and passed it up
the boards,'' Souza said. ``We were on a two-on-one shorthanded and
Mark Mowers went to the net. He kind of got behind the defenseman
and I just saw his stick. I didn't see him, only the blade of the
stick and I passed it, and it deflected off the stick and in. It
was awesome.''
</P>
<P>
   It was all that, and maybe more, said UNH coach Dick Umile.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a great moment, a fabulous moment,'' Umile said. ``The
place goes crazy in Albany. We were struggling at the end of that
season and, bang, all of a sudden we beat Wisconsin the night
before and Mike was great in that game. And then we played BU and
beat them in overtime. Shorthanded. It can't get any better than
that.''
</P>
<P>
   Souza _ as he has been the last four years _ was smack dab in
the middle of it. UNH went on to the NCAA semifinals at the
FleetCenter and a string of unprecedented success.
</P>
<P>
   UNH lost that semifinal game to Michigan, but then came back
last year and won its first outright Hockey East regular-season
title. For the first time, the Wildcats made consecutive trips to
the Frozen Four and then also made it to their first championship
game, where they lost to Maine in overtime.
</P>
<P>
   Now, the Wildcats are in the NCAA tournament for the fourth
straight year. Their quest for a first national title begins in
Minneapolis against Niagara, a team the Wildcats have never faced.
UNH (23-8-6) is the No. 3 seed in the West Regionals and Niagara
(29-7-4) is No. 6. The winner plays No. 2 seed North Dakota
(28-8-5) Saturday night.
</P>
<P>
   Souza, along with fellow UNH captain Enders, leads the chase.
``He's playing great,'' said Umile. ``He competing hard and he's
playing his best hockey of the season as he did in the latter part
of last year. He's playing with a sense of urgency, like there's no
tomorrow. I like the way he's playing.''
</P>
<P>
   For good reason.
</P>
<P>
   Souza's blast beat Merrimack in overtime in the first round of
the Hockey East tournament and sent UNH on to the FleetCenter. He's
had six goals and six assists in the last eight games.
</P>
<P>
   Sense of urgency? Well, yeah. This is it for the UNH seniors,
who have already gone where no other UNH seniors have gone. And
want to go one giant step farther.
</P>
<P>
   ``For me, individually, it's been a bit of an up-and-down
year,'' Souza said. ``I may not have met the goals I set for
myself, but in looking back I like to think I've contributed in
other ways. I'm very happy with the year we've had as a team. And
we still have some unfinished business.''
</P>
<P>
   Souza, who had 23 goals and 42 assists in 41 games last year,
has 15 goals and 25 assists in 37 games and is tied for the team's
scoring lead with sophomore Darren Haydar.
</P>
<P>
   UNH numbers were down across the board this year. The Wildcats
lost Hobey Baker Award winner Jason Krog and maybe more important,
three of their top defenseman. They were not nearly as explosive as
a year ago. Still, the Wildcats have been close to the top of the
national rankings all year, are in the tournament, and will
surprise no one if they go deep into it.
</P>
<P>
   And if they do, Souza _ who at 6 feet 1 inches and 208 pounds
looks like and plays the part of a power forward _ will likely be a
big part of it.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday at practice, in UNH's first look at Mariucci Arena,
Souza was on a line with fellow seniors John Sadowski and Jason
Shipulski. He basically had swapped spots with freshman Lanny Gare,
who was with Darren Haydar and Matt Swain.
</P>
<P>
   ``Of late, he's taken his game to another level,'' said UNH
assistant coach Brian McCloskey. ``He's probably relaxed a little
bit. There was a lot of pressure on this team to try and fill the
shoes of the departing seniors and live up to the expectations of
the fans. He's a goal scorer, he's a pretty good playmaker for his
size, and he's also a physical player. He does all three things
pretty well, which makes him a difficult player to play against.''
</P>
<P>
   BU coach Jack Parker _ who has known and liked Souza for years _
has noticed.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's just a great kid,'' Parker said. ``He's the kind of kid
you're happy to have representing you in the uniform wherever he
goes. Add to that he can score goals, he can bang people, he
competes as hard as he competes. It's a pretty nice package.''
</P>
<P>
   A package Parker figures will transfer well to professional
hockey. Souza was a 1997 third-round pick of the Chicago
Blackhawks.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think there's any question he'll be able to play that
game as well as he plays our game,'' Parker said. ``He's got that
pro look, the stride. He just looks like a big, blocky, left wing
who will be in the NHL.''
</P>
<P>
   Souza is keeping those thoughts in check _ hopefully for a few
more games.
</P>
<P>
   ``The last few weeks that's been brought up all the time,'' he
said. ``I try to block it out for the most part. I'm real
determined to stay focused. That probably sounds like I'm blowing
smoke, but I'm being honest. How well you play in playoff
situations probably makes a difference in what people think of you.
But I'm not too concerned with that right now.''
</P>
<P>
   He and the Wildcats are concerned with Niagara. If they get by
the Purple Eagles, they will worry about North Dakota for a third
straight trip to the Frozen Four.
</P>
<P>
   And try to match the feeling they had two years ago when Souza
passed across to Mowers.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was one of the great moments in UNH hockey history,'' Umile
said. ``It's got to be one of the top three.''
</P>
<P>
   With a little room still left at the top.

NEW TREATMENT HELPS INDIA BATTLE TB

<P>
   HYDERABAD, India _ For a year, 10-year-old Chaitanya Pusa
suffered from recurring fevers, a hacking cough and debilitating
weakness. She saw healers who chanted mantras over her and private
doctors who missed her real illness.
</P>
<P>
   Her family, which survives on a meager income from three milking
cows, sunk deeper and deeper in debt to pay the bills. The girl lay
bedridden. ``When she developed pain in her chest, we panicked and
took her to the hospital,'' said her grandmother, Sandamma Pusa.
</P>
<P>
   Doctors there promptly diagnosed Chaitanya as one of the 2
million people who develop tuberculosis each year in India, more
than in any other country.
</P>
<P>
   About 450,000 die from it _ more than from AIDS, malaria and
tropical diseases combined _ but Chaitanya, now 12, will not be one
of them.
</P>
<P>
   On Friday, on World Tuberculosis Day, President Bill Clinton
gave this little girl with dark brown eyes and two long braids her
final dose of the medicines that will cure her, and he signed the
register that has documented each stage of her six-month long
treatment.
</P>
<P>
   ``TB kills more people around the world than ever before,
including one almost every minute here in India,'' Clinton said,
calling for intensified efforts to control the epidemic and to find
a vaccine that will prevent it.
</P>
<P>
   Chaitanya's is one of 40,000 lives that experts say have been
saved by the use of a popular treatment that is popular here. It
begins with an accurate diagnosis, then ensures that patients
complete a 6- to 8-month long regimen of drug taking by having an
observer literally watch them take their medicines.
</P>
<P>
   Trained paramedics monitor the patients' records to double check
that the treatment is proceeding properly.
</P>
<P>
   Last month, a team of experts from the World Health
Organization, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, and
the World Bank, working with India's leading tuberculosis
specialists, interviewed 1,000 patients and reviewed the records of
more than 10,000 patients to evaluate the strategy which has been
used in India since 1993.
</P>
<P>
   They discovered that this method, known as directly observed
treatment, short course, or DOTS, has doubled cure rates to 84
percent and cut death rates to 4 percent from 29 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Almost a quarter of a million people with tuberculosis, which is
caused by a bacteria and spreads through the air when an untreated
patient coughs or talks, have been given the DOTS treatment in
India.
</P>
<P>
   Still, it is available to only about 15 percent of India's
population of 1 billion _ and the challenge in this vast,
impoverished nation with its shaky public health system is to
expand the program, and fast.
</P>
<P>
   Some critics say the strategy is too cumbersome, and the public
health systems in developing countries like India, too weak to make
the program work on a much larger scale.
</P>
<P>
   But proponents say that more than 5 million patients have
already been treated using DOTS _ and it's worked even in poor
countries like Tanzania, Vietnam and Peru.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS.)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   ``We have a cure for TB,'' said Tom Frieden, a doctor who ran
New York City's tuberculosis program and now advises the Indian
government about TB on behalf of the World Health Organization.
``And it's cheap and cost effective. It's just not being applied as
widely as it should be.''
</P>
<P>
   There are now more resources coming in to spread the treatment
to new parts of India. The World Bank, the largest contributor, has
given India a $142-million low-interest loan over five years. The
British government recently pledged $25 million over 5 years to
combat TB in this southern state of Andhra Pradesh.
</P>
<P>
   The United States contributes a relatively small amount _ $1
million for an applied research project in Tamil Nadu.
</P>
<P>
   India has a budget of $28 million to combat the disease, while
the United States, which had 17,528 new cases of TB last year,
spends more than $100 million.
</P>
<P>
   The shoe-box sized box of drugs required to treat a patient in
India costs $10 to $15 _ and by saving the lives of young men and
women, who are not only the most likely victims, but their
families' breadwinners, TB treatment is also important to
preventing poverty.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS.)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   First thing on Friday morning, here in Hyderabad, Mohammad
Jaffar, a social worker and father of six children 9 and younger,
and Mohammad Fakaruddin, a leather worker with a 3-year-old son and
a 4-year-old daughter, came into the Nampally treatment center.
</P>
<P>
   Both are in the early, intense phase of treatment. Jerripotula
Urmila, a pharmacist, gave them their foil packets of pills and
watched to be sure that they took them.
</P>
<P>
   People with the disease here in Hyderabad, where treatment is
available, seem confident that they will be cured. For them, the
stigma of the disease has lifted.
</P>
<P>
   Mohammad Mahaboob, a 35-year-old auto rickshaw driver, got his
final treatment on Friday morning from the chief minister of Andhra
Pradesh, N. Chandrababu Naidu. ``I read in the newspaper that it is
very much curable, so I wasn't too worried,'' he said.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS.)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   And Chaitanya, dressed in her favorite full-length, festival
dress made of a shimmery golden fabric, walked confidently up to
the president of the United States on Friday morning for the last
dose of medicine she would need to banish the disease.
</P>
<P>
   She stuck the pills on the back of her tongue, tilted her head
back and poured the water into her mouth, in the Indian way,
without touching her lips. She was done with TB. Her ordeal was
officially over.

 &HT;    CLINTON TO URGE PAKISTAN, SYRIA BACK ON RESPECTIVE PEACE TRACKS

<TEXT>
<P>
   BOMBAY, India _ President Clinton was hurtling toward a weekend
of whirlwind diplomacy Saturday, hoping for measured steps toward
peace on two fronts _ the Himalayan territory of Kashmir and the
fractious Middle East.
</P>
<P>
   Journeying first to the Pakistani capital of Islamabad, Clinton
meets with Chief Army Gen. Pervez Musharraf. He seized power in a
coup last October, overthrowing the elected government of Prime
Minister Nawaz Sharif.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton wants Musharraf to develop a blueprint for returning the
country to civilian rule, end Pakistani support for seccessionist
rebels in Kashmir, and move toward peace talks with India over the
disputed Himalayan territory.
</P>
<P>
   Late Saturday Clinton travels to Geneva, where he is scheduled
to meet Sunday with Syria's president, Hafez al-Assad. Clinton
hopes that meeting will lead to a near-term resumption of
Syrian-Israeli peace talks that broke off after a week of
negotiations in Shepherdstown, West Va., in January.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton tacked the Geneva summit onto the tail end of a
week-long swing through the Indian subcontinent.
</P>
<P>
   He wrapped up his tour of India Friday with visits to Hyderabad,
where he spotlighted India's burgeoning computer technology sector
and efforts to tame widespread tuberculosis. In Bombay, he touched
base with a new generation of up-and-coming Indian artists, doctors
and executives.
</P>
<P>
   In remarks to several hundred executives at the Bombay Stock
Exchange Friday night, Clinton said American companies had signed
contracts during his visit this week that would ultimately be worth
$4 billion. He also announced about $1 billion in new financing for
small- and medium-sized businesses in India to export to the United
States.
</P>
<P>
   (EDs: Begin optional trim.)
</P>
<P>
   Earlier in Hyderabad, Clinton visited Mahavir Hospital, which
runs one of 400 clinics around the country that provide medication
to cure tuberculosis. A staggering 20 million Indians suffer from
TB _ a disease for which inoculations were developed 118 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   At a Hyderabad commercial center called HI-TEC City, Clinton
pledged $5 million in U.S. assistance to help wire impoverished
Indian villages to the Internet, bringing on-line health and
education opportunities to the doorsteps of some of the poorest
people in the world.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we could do that for every village in South Asia, in
Africa, in Latin America, in the Middle East, then, overnight, the
poorest place in the world could have access to the same learning
materials that only the richest schools offer their students
today,'' Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It would mean, among other things, that the world's most
populous nation would have the world's largest number of educated
people,'' he said, ``and, therefore, in no time, would have the
world's largest economy.''
</P>
<P>
   (EDs: End optional trim.)
</P>
<P>
   India has become one of the world's leading centers of computer
and software technology. American companies have become
increasingly drawn to this country's rich talent pool, at wages a
fraction of those paid in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   On-line technology is transforming such relationships, enabling
U.S. companies to employ Indians who work to develop software or
handle technical problems directly from India.
</P>
<P>
   ``Today, many of our leading companies _ from Apple to Texas
Instruments to Oracle _ are coming in waves to your shores,''
Clinton said in a speech to more than 1,000 technology executives
assembled at HI-TEC City.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm told that if a person calls Microsoft for help with
software, there's a pretty good chance they'll find themselves
talking to an expert in India, rather than Seattle,'' Clinton said.
``India is fast becoming one of the world's software superpowers,
proving that, in a globalized world, developing nations not only
can succeed, developing nations can lead.''
</P>
<P>
   As Clinton shifts Saturday from cyberspace to statecraft, aides
stressed that his missions to Islamabad and Geneva were both aimed
at sowing the seeds of future progress. Immediate breakthroughs
weren't expected on either front.
</P>
<P>
   Pakistan is something of a wild card. U.S. influence there is
limited. Musharraf is contending with a strong element of radical
Muslims, whose political clout appears to be growing. And rhetoric
coming from Islamabad in recent days suggests that it could be
months before Musharraf moves to limit violence in Kashmir or sets
out a road map back to democratic rule.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton, moreover, has no plans to try to mediate the Kashmir
crisis, unless he's specifically sought by both parties to the
dispute. So far, India has rejected the idea of a formal U.S. role.
</P>
<P>
   Similarly, little immediate action is expected from Clinton's
meeting Sunday with Assad.
</P>
<P>
   Essentially, this is a meeting to talk about the circumstances
required to reinvigorate Israeli-Syrian negotiations that
deadlocked two months ago over how to structure a mutually
acceptable formula for exchanging land for peace.
</P>
<P>
   White House aides said the most likely outcome of Sunday's
meeting would be that Assad would go home to Damascus to consider
the path ahead, as Clinton communicates with Israeli Prime Minister
Ehud Barak, in the hope that both men would see it in their
interest to resume peace talks at some point in the weeks ahead.
</P>
<P>
   ``The best case result, I would say, is that we have a sense
after the meeting that there's enough common ground, they're close
enough, that if we actually resume negotiations that you could
envision them ending in success,'' White House National Security
Advisor Samuel Berger.
</P>
<P>
   Sunday's meeting would be the fourth between Clinton and Assad,
but the first since the American leader brought Syrian and Israeli
negotiators together at the White House last December.
</P>
<P>
   That meeting led to a week of negotiations in Shepherdstown,
W.Va., between Israel's Barak and Syrian Foreign Minister Farouk
al-Sharaa.
</P>
<P>
   At issue are the terms under which Israel would return to Syria
the strategic Golan Heights in exchange for security guarantees
from Syria. Israeli troops seized the Heights during the 1967
Israeli-Arab war.
</P>
<P>
   While the broad parameters of an Israeli-Syrian peace accord
have been known for years, a serious dispute persists over
precisely how to draw the new border between Israel and Syria.
Assad's position has been that talks can't go forward on myriad
substantive issues _ ranging from water rights to trade terms _
unless and until Israel agrees to return all of the Golan lands to
Syrian control.
</P>
<P>
   Israel has balked, instead offering to return most, but not all
of the Golan, which have become an important intelligence gathering
and monitoring platform for Israeli defense forces.

 &HT;    POPE IN THE FOOTSTEPS OF JESUS: 'CHOOSE LIFE'
 &HT;    By LARRY KAPLOW 
 &HT;    c.2000 Cox News Service 
<TEXT>
<P>
   KORAZIM, Israel _ When the locals of this lakeside village
refused to believe in him, Jesus of Nazareth responded, ``Woe unto
thee.''
</P>
<P>
   Nearly 2,000 years later, Pope John Paul II on Friday took the
message of Christ back to these hills overlooking the Sea of
Galilee, and this time was greeted enthusiastically by a crowd from
around the world.
</P>
<P>
   More than 75,000 worshippers arrived by sunrise to wait for the
11 a.m. mass on the Mount of the Beatitudes _ the same mountain
where Christ is believed to have spoken the Sermon on the Mount.
</P>
<P>
   It was a mass aimed at young people but attended by people of
all ages. There were those who called John Paul(cq, second
reference without II) ``Papiez'' in their native Polish, ``El
Papa'' in Spanish, ``I-Baba'' in Arabic and ``Paus'' in the Bahasa
language of Malaysia.
</P>
<P>
   ``I cried through the whole thing,'' Gregg Purcell, a
29-year-old seminary student from Denver, Colo., said.
</P>
<P>
   Far from the 2000-year-old image of Jesus as a lonely prophet,
the mass produced the most celebratory event so far in the pope's
six-day pilgrimage to Israel and the West Bank areas controlled by
the Palestinian Authority.
</P>
<P>
   The pope had urged others to join him on the pilgrimage, and
they did. Thousands of local Arab Christians, a beleaguered Holy
Land minority, also came.
</P>
<P>
   The pope's trip is the highlight of his millennium effort to
foster better relations between faiths. It is only the second trip
here by a Roman Catholic pope and the first time a pope has
officially recognized the state of Israel.
</P>
<P>
   After the mass Thursday, the pope prayed quietly at lakeside
churches where tradition holds that Christ performed many of his
miracles. They included The Church of the Loaves and Fishes, where
he is said to have served 5,000 people with a couple loaves of
bread.
</P>
<P>
   He also met with Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak. Barak joked
that he was nervous that the meeting would run past sundown and
catch him working past the start of the Jewish Sabbath. Religious
government leaders have said they would find that offensive.
</P>
<P>
   But Friday's mass in a heavily-secured, wide, shelf on the Mount
of the Beatitudes was untarnished by the type of political
squabbling that has confronted much of the pope's visit.
Palestinians and Israelis have repeatedly sought to use episodes in
the pope's trip for vindication of their positions.
</P>
<P>
   Friday was a day more of scenery than polemics.
</P>
<P>
   Threatening clouds held off their rain until after the mass was
well over. The overcast skies created a soft mist over the Sea of
Galilee and the coastal city of Tiberias. Occasionally, the sun
would crack through the clouds enough to shed light on the high
plain, still leaving the lowlands around it in shadow.
</P>
<P>
   On a large red and green stage with a black tarp covering it,
the pope sounded stronger than usual. After moving through the
crowd in his popemobile, John Paul II took his place in a simple
gray throne. He exhorted the crowd to avoid the temptations of
evil.
</P>
<P>
   ``We sit on this hill like the first of the disciples, and we
listen to Jesus. In the stillness we hear his gentle and urgent
voice, as gentle as this land itself and as urgent as a call to
choose between life and death,'' the pope said.
</P>
<P>
   He reviewed the Sermon on the Mount, where Jesus urged love for
your neighbor and highlighted the righteousness of the poor. He
compared that guidance to the older Ten Commandments. He said the
Sermon fulfilled, rather than replaced, the commandments, leaving
listeners to understand a common ground between Christianity and
Judaism.
</P>
<P>
   About half the crowd were from a 36-year-old Catholic
Neocatechumenal movement, which was started in the slums of Spain
by an artist and musician. The movement appeals to those who have
lost their faith and seeks to bring them into the church.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are pilgrims with the pope,'' said Wojciech Dubinski, a
20-year-old computer technician who joined the movement from
Warsaw, Poland, which is the pope's home country.
</P>
<P>
   The foreign flags that the group waved relieved a sense of
isolation felt by thousands of local Christians in the crowd. Arab
Christians from Israel and the Palestinian areas make up just two
percent of the population.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is wonderful. We have been waiting our whole lives to see
him in Palestine,'' said Palestinian Sylvia Kassiss, a 40-year-old
Catholic teacher from Jerusalem.

 &HT;    CLINTON TO URGE PAKISTAN, SYRIA BACK ON RESPECTIVE PEACE TRACKS
 &HT;    (900&AMP;ADD)
 &HT;    With INDIA-COLOR-0325.

<TEXT>
<P>
   BOMBAY, India _ President Clinton was hurtling toward a weekend
of whirlwind diplomacy Saturday, hoping for measured steps toward
peace on two fronts _ the Himalayan territory of Kashmir and the
fractious Middle East.
</P>
<P>
   Journeying first to the Pakistani capital of Islamabad, Clinton
meets with Chief Army Gen. Pervez Musharraf. He seized power in a
coup last October, overthrowing the elected government of Prime
Minister Nawaz Sharif.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton wants Musharraf to develop a blueprint for returning the
country to civilian rule, end Pakistani support for seccessionist
rebels in Kashmir, and move toward peace talks with India over the
disputed Himalayan territory.
</P>
<P>
   Late Saturday Clinton travels to Geneva, where he is scheduled
to meet Sunday with Syria's president, Hafez al-Assad. Clinton
hopes that meeting will lead to a near-term resumption of
Syrian-Israeli peace talks that broke off after a week of
negotiations in Shepherdstown, West Va., in January.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton tacked the Geneva summit onto the tail end of a
week-long swing through the Indian subcontinent.
</P>
<P>
   He wrapped up his tour of India Friday with visits to Hyderabad,
where he spotlighted India's burgeoning computer technology sector
and efforts to tame widespread tuberculosis. In Bombay, he touched
base with a new generation of up-and-coming Indian artists, doctors
and executives.
</P>
<P>
   In remarks to several hundred executives at the Bombay Stock
Exchange Friday night, Clinton said American companies had signed
contracts during his visit this week that would ultimately be worth
$4 billion. He also announced about $1 billion in new financing for
small- and medium-sized businesses in India to export to the United
States.
</P>
<P>
   (EDs: Begin optional trim.)
</P>
<P>
   Earlier in Hyderabad, Clinton visited Mahavir Hospital, which
runs one of 400 clinics around the country that provide medication
to cure tuberculosis. A staggering 20 million Indians suffer from
TB _ a disease for which inoculations were developed 118 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   At a Hyderabad commercial center called HI-TEC City, Clinton
pledged $5 million in U.S. assistance to help wire impoverished
Indian villages to the Internet, bringing on-line health and
education opportunities to the doorsteps of some of the poorest
people in the world.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we could do that for every village in South Asia, in
Africa, in Latin America, in the Middle East, then, overnight, the
poorest place in the world could have access to the same learning
materials that only the richest schools offer their students
today,'' Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It would mean, among other things, that the world's most
populous nation would have the world's largest number of educated
people,'' he said, ``and, therefore, in no time, would have the
world's largest economy.''
</P>
<P>
   (EDs: End optional trim.)
</P>
<P>
   India has become one of the world's leading centers of computer
and software technology. American companies have become
increasingly drawn to this country's rich talent pool, at wages a
fraction of those paid in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   On-line technology is transforming such relationships, enabling
U.S. companies to employ Indians who work to develop software or
handle technical problems directly from India.
</P>
<P>
   ``Today, many of our leading companies _ from Apple to Texas
Instruments to Oracle _ are coming in waves to your shores,''
Clinton said in a speech to more than 1,000 technology executives
assembled at HI-TEC City.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm told that if a person calls Microsoft for help with
software, there's a pretty good chance they'll find themselves
talking to an expert in India, rather than Seattle,'' Clinton said.
``India is fast becoming one of the world's software superpowers,
proving that, in a globalized world, developing nations not only
can succeed, developing nations can lead.''
</P>
<P>
   As Clinton shifts Saturday from cyberspace to statecraft, aides
stressed that his missions to Islamabad and Geneva were both aimed
at sowing the seeds of future progress. Immediate breakthroughs
weren't expected on either front.
</P>
<P>
   Pakistan is something of a wild card. U.S. influence there is
limited. Musharraf is contending with a strong element of radical
Muslims, whose political clout appears to be growing. And rhetoric
coming from Islamabad in recent days suggests that it could be
months before Musharraf moves to limit violence in Kashmir or sets
out a road map back to democratic rule.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton, moreover, has no plans to try to mediate the Kashmir
crisis, unless he's specifically sought by both parties to the
dispute. So far, India has rejected the idea of a formal U.S. role.
</P>
<P>
   Similarly, little immediate action is expected from Clinton's
meeting Sunday with Assad.
</P>
<P>
   Essentially, this is a meeting to talk about the circumstances
required to reinvigorate Israeli-Syrian negotiations that
deadlocked two months ago over how to structure a mutually
acceptable formula for exchanging land for peace.
</P>
<P>
   White House aides said the most likely outcome of Sunday's
meeting would be that Assad would go home to Damascus to consider
the path ahead, as Clinton communicates with Israeli Prime Minister
Ehud Barak, in the hope that both men would see it in their
interest to resume peace talks at some point in the weeks ahead.
</P>
<P>
   ``The best case result, I would say, is that we have a sense
after the meeting that there's enough common ground, they're close
enough, that if we actually resume negotiations that you could
envision them ending in success,'' White House National Security
Advisor Samuel Berger.
</P>
<P>
   Sunday's meeting would be the fourth between Clinton and Assad,
but the first since the American leader brought Syrian and Israeli
negotiators together at the White House last December.
</P>
<P>
   That meeting led to a week of negotiations in Shepherdstown,
W.Va., between Israel's Barak and Syrian Foreign Minister Farouk
al-Sharaa.
</P>
<P>
   At issue are the terms under which Israel would return to Syria
the strategic Golan Heights in exchange for security guarantees
from Syria. Israeli troops seized the Heights during the 1967
Israeli-Arab war.
</P>
<P>
   While the broad parameters of an Israeli-Syrian peace accord
have been known for years, a serious dispute persists over
precisely how to draw the new border between Israel and Syria.
Assad's position has been that talks can't go forward on myriad
substantive issues _ ranging from water rights to trade terms _
unless and until Israel agrees to return all of the Golan lands to
Syrian control.
</P>
<P>
   Israel has balked, instead offering to return most, but not all
of the Golan, which have become an important intelligence gathering
and monitoring platform for Israeli defense forces.

   NUN-SISTER-KAROL (New York) _ If the nuns in ``The Sound of
Music'' couldn't figure out how to solve a problem like Maria, they
would be completely baffled by Sister Karol Jackowski, 53, who
lives in the East Village, has Margaritaville (cocktails, chips and
pizza) each week with her friends and calls chopped liver ``a major
food group for me.'' Karol has also written a book with the
improbable title, ``Ten Fun Things to Do Before You Die''
(Hyperion, $9.95). All things considered, she sounded like my kind
of sister. By Alex Witchel. WITH PHOTO. &QL;

</P>
<P>
   GREAT-DAMES (New York) _ Great dames _ flamboyant diva-women,
who came of age before 1960s feminism _ are never defeated by their
circumstances. Tenacity, flair and fun are the traits that define
them. They were reared in an era of limited expectations, when
graduate schools and careers were closed to them. Good manners,
manicures, pearls and high heels were the disguises they wore to
hide their mettle. Auntie Mame is the prototype, with her arch
double entendres and live-live-live philosophy. They were actressy,
and brimmed with theatrical enthusiasms. By Marie Brenner. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   TROPHY-SHOPPING (New York) _ Jane Schub, a partner in Jules &AMP;
Jane, a small cosmetics company, drops in on Sam's Club, part of
the Wal-Mart-owned national chain, routinely, her eye always peeled
for a fashion bargain. On a recent Friday, she was as cunning as a
bobcat, prowling the aisles and pouncing on twin sets and
raincoats, sandals and mules _ anything at all that caught her eye.
Typical of a new breed of affluent fashion maven, she is as likely
to shop at off-price outlets like T.J. Maxx, which sell designer
labels, and at discounters like Target, which produce their own
wares, as she is to cruise Jeffrey or Kirna Zabete, those outposts
of downtown chic. Increasingly shrewd, such women are driven by
value, naturally _ but perhaps even more by the thrill of the
chase. By Ruth La Ferla. WITH PHOTO. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   NITEOUT-CHRISTENSEN-MODEL (New York) _ No one ever said that
life after modeling is easy. Besides the pain of makeup withdrawal
and the pangs of catwalk envy, there is also the issue of how to
make a living without simply being fabulous. Not so for the Danish
supermodel _ and runway retiree _ Helena Christensen, who since
last spring has held the impressive-sounding title of creative
director for Nylon magazine, a fashion-oriented glossy that marked
its first anniversary on Wednesday night with a party at Skirt, a
boutique in Manhattan. By Jesse Mckinley. WITH PHOTO. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   OSCARS-PLACEMENT (Undated) _ Many envelopes will be ripped open
Sunday night at the 72nd annual Academy Awards. But not one will
contain instructions on how to display a much-hoped-for,
much-obsessed-over Oscar at home so it won't look preposterous.
Yes, this is a little-explored downside to walking away with one of
the 13-inch-high gold statuettes. An Oscar may look great on the
red carpet or on a table at Morton's during the Vanity Fair
after-party. But where can one keep it at home so it doesn't suck
all the air out of the room? By Marcia Biederman. WITH PHOTO. &QL;

</P>
<P>
   GARDEN-COLUMN (Undated) _ I'm sorry to see the honeybees
colonies that used to populate by woods decline from parasitic
mites, not just because they have been as much a symbol of spring
for me as a daffodil or a fat robin. The bees were doing valuable
work in the orchard and in my fields and gardens, pollinating
blossoms. By Cass Peterson. &QL;

&HT;     DIOCESE PLANS ATONEMENT FOR SEXUAL ABUSE CASES 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By ELIZABETH FERNANDEZ  
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ The sexual abuse began when Lorraine Bruz was
16, when a priest in Santa Rosa convinced her she had poor
self-esteem. It continued for about three years.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this month, Bruz, now 40 and living in Sonoma County,
was among four plaintiffs who won a $1.6 million settlement from
the Santa Rosa Catholic Diocese.
</P>
<P>
   On Saturday, Bruz will receive something more spiritually
symbolic: a formal apology from the church.
</P>
<P>
   In what is believed to be an unprecedented act of public
contrition in the Roman Catholic Church in the United States, the
Oakland Diocese will ask forgiveness of those who have suffered
sexual misconduct by clergy or other church employees.
</P>
<P>
   This cleansing of conscience, planned for about a year, is
intended as a critical first step toward healing the breach between
the church and survivors of priestly misconduct.
</P>
<P>
   ``These are people who've been ignored,'' said Sister Barbara
Flannery, the diocesan chancellor and a prime organizer behind the
mea culpa. ``They've been abused not once, but twice. We are
sincerely sorry for what has happened.''
</P>
<P>
   Discounted and disbelieved by church officials when they lodged
complaints, many survivors watched their abusers go unpunished or
shuttled quietly from one parish to another. Stripped of their
innocence and ability to trust, survivors say they were victimized
anew by church officials who refused to acknowledge the
transgressions of sexual predators in clerical collars.
</P>
<P>
   From Los Angeles, San Diego, Fresno, they are expected to attend
the reconciliation service simply to hear church leaders utter
words never before articulated in a public arena to abuse victims.
</P>
<P>
   ``For many, it happened years ago, but they feel rage and anger
and haven't been able to deal with it because they've been
stonewalled,'' Flannery said. ``No one has ever said they are sorry
to them, which is a sad commentary.''
</P>
<P>
   The Oakland Diocese, which encompasses 500,000 Catholics in
Alameda and Contra Costa counties, has handled a dozen cases of
clergy misconduct over the last decade, though some of the abuse
actually occurred in other dioceses, Flannery said.
</P>
<P>
   While Oakland is shouldering the weight of apology, other
dioceses are being bitterly criticized for failing to extend such
an olive branch. Chief among them is the San Francisco Archdiocese,
which has weathered numerous cases of pedophilia and clergy
misconduct, paying at least $6 million in counseling costs and
legal claims.
</P>
<P>
   Nationally, the Catholic Church is estimated to have spent $1
billion in clergy misconduct cases.
</P>
<P>
   ``What kind of church is this? Such hypocrisy,'' said Sonia
Rubino, who was molested by a priest for eight years, starting when
she was an 8-year-old girl living in her native El Salvador.
</P>
<P>
   Rubino, a sales clerk who lives in San Francisco, said she
sought solace from the archdiocese but was rebuffed.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the universal Catholic Church, they should make
amends,'' she said. ``It is a great thing that the Oakland Diocese
is doing this. It takes a lot of courage. At least in one small
place of the world they are willing to stand up for survivors.''
</P>
<P>
   Surveying clergy abuse victims as far away as Australia, Terrie
Light, regional leader of the Survivors Network of those Abused by
Priests, said of the Oakland apology: ``No one has ever heard of
anything like this. They wish it was happening where they lived.''
</P>
<P>
   Light, who said she was sexually abused when she was 7 by a San
Francisco priest, now works as a marriage family therapist in
Berkeley.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have a hard time sitting in a church,'' said Light, who was
a catalyst for the Saturday service. ``The crucifix and the organ
music and all that is so psychologically painful ... (but) some
survivors say they want to attend, not because it's their bishop
speaking but at least it's a bishop. That is heartbreaking. The
church will only understand when they all meet with real victims,
when they hear of their pain and suffering and isolation.''
</P>
<P>
   During the service, Oakland Bishop John Cummins plans to
acknowledge failings to confront the ``grave evil'' inflicted on
members of the faithful.
</P>
<P>
   ``We, as a church, were often negligent,'' he said. ``We do not
know of any other Catholic diocese in the country currently taking
this initiative. Yet we feel it is an important step toward healing
and reconciliation.''
</P>
<P>

<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   March has been a month of historic repentance within the Roman
Catholic Church. Two weeks ago, Pope John Paul II offered a
sweeping apology for the sins of the church throughout its history.
In what was termed a ``purification of memory'' to mark Jubilee
Year 2000, the pope asked for forgiveness for lapses and injustices
done in the name of the church.
</P>
<P>
   Since then, various bishops and cardinals in the United States
have offered general apologies, with some specifying clergy abuse
among the transgressions.
</P>
<P>
   ``The church is not accustomed to apologizing,'' said the Rev.
Daniel Danielson, pastor of the Catholic Community of Pleasanton
who helped organize Oakland's day of atonement. ``It is high time
we did it. ... At times, survivors were treated like lepers. They
were told to be quiet _ the church acted out of fear of lawsuits.
It is a scandal to the people abused and to the rest of the
faithful.
</P>
<P>
   ``We believe in forgiveness but it comes after the confession of
sin. We hope this is the beginning of a public change of
attitude.''
</P>
<P>
   It took a lawsuit, but the Santa Rosa Diocese, under a tentative
settlement, will be issuing a written apology to four former
parishioners as well as establishing a $500,000 therapy program for
victims of clergy misconduct.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is hard to know how important an apology is,'' said Bruz,
one of the Santa Rosa plaintiffs. ``In some ways it feels like too
little too late.''

<P>
   NEW YORK _ If the nuns in ``The Sound of Music'' couldn't figure
out how to solve a problem like Maria, they would be completely
baffled by Karol Jackowski, who lives in the East Village, has
Margaritaville (cocktails, chips and pizza) each week with her
friends and calls chopped liver ``a major food group for me.''
</P>
<P>
   Sister Karol, 53, has also written a book with the improbable
title, ``Ten Fun Things to Do Before You Die'' (Hyperion, $9.95).
All things considered, she sounded like my kind of sister. So I
went to her apartment, figuring we could run through the list and
she could enlighten me. But I was so enchanted by the excellent
chopped liver that I forgot to ask about fun as Sister Karol
explained it all for me _ how she started in East Chicago, Ind.,
and ended up here, wearing jeans and cooking in Calphalon.
</P>
<P>
   ``In 1970, there was a mass exodus from the convent,'' she said.
``We lost 500,000 in a period of six years. But I didn't want to
leave religious life _ I wanted to live it differently.''
</P>
<P>
   She is a member of the Sisters for a Christian Community, a
Roman Catholic order of about 700 based in New Jersey that has no
convent. ``If you're self-supporting, taxpaying and taking care of
each other, you don't need that central location,'' she said.
``We're adult women. We don't need someone to approve of what we
do. It's a nontraditional lifestyle, but we still take the vows of
celibacy, poverty and obedience.''
</P>
<P>
   Sister Karol works as the chief operating officer of the four
Alphabets gift stores in the city; other sisters have jobs as
varied as restaurant owner and manager of a 7-Eleven. One retired
as a vice president for marketing at Pfizer.
</P>
<P>
   That's impressive, I thought. I started to ask the fun questions
but became distracted by the tour of her apartment, which includes
a lamp that says ``Ask for Imported Blue Nun by the Glass'' and a
votive stand, where she invites visitors to light a candle and make
a wish before they leave. There's also her collection of ceramic
nuns. ``They were really big in the '50s,'' Sister Karol said. ``If
you didn't have a nun for a daughter, a nun tchotchke was the next
best thing.''
</P>
<P>
   Her parents owned a bakery in East Chicago that catered to the
local steel mills, and she had two brothers and two sisters, all of
whom ``went forth and multiplied,'' she said, giving her nine
nieces and nephews. She learned about fun from a funny grandmother
and from her own mother, who lies on the couch reading romance
novels when she visits, getting up in time to go out for dinner.
</P>
<P>
   Sister Karol is a character in her own right, not to mention a
smart one. She graduated from St. Mary's College in South Bend,
Ind., and received her M.A. in theology from Notre Dame, eventually
becoming dean of students at St. Mary's and publishing three books
with Ave Maria Press. ``Ten Fun Things to Do Before You Die'' came
from a speech she gave at the college, during which she interrupted
herself briefly to leave the podium and reappear in a gorilla suit.
In 1990 she moved to New York to earn a Ph.D. in higher education
administration at New York University, deciding when she finished
not to return to academia. ``After 20 years, I thought, `Maybe I'm
done with college,''' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Her friend Linda Heidinger, a former nun, is the owner of
Alphabets, and she gave Sister Karol the chance to work there
rather than return to her original order, the traditional Sisters
of the Holy Cross, in South Bend.
</P>
<P>
   ``They wanted me to go back to more religious work,'' she said.
``But I had a richer religious life here than I had had there in 30
years. Life is more intense in New York City. The diversity here
makes for such a liberating environment.
</P>
<P>
   ``Also, I got involved with the kids who worked in the store,
most of whom were interested in a spiritual life, not a religious
life. I found that really refreshing, that they were trying to be
better persons and not knowing how to do that. With the church, on
issues like abortion and birth control, you end up fighting battles
where you're wasting your time. Here I was free of that. It was
soul to soul and what makes the most sense, not just what was good
Catholic advice.''
</P>
<P>
   That's when she switched orders and started reworking her Ten
Fun Things speech into a less Catholic, more generalized guide to
leading a fuller life. Through Heidinger, she found an agent who
sold the book for a $60,000 advance. So much for poverty.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have to support ourselves,'' Sister Karol said firmly. ``We
all know each other's financial status. The regular salaries
support the ones in the inner city who aren't being paid
anything.''
</P>
<P>
   OK. Poverty and obedience, I understand. But how do you write a
book about fun when you're celibate?
</P>
<P>
   ``That vow is what distinguishes me from anyone who lives like
this,'' she said, waving a hand around her apartment. ``When I've
gotten close to being in relationships, I knew it was too limiting
to me. That exclusivity goes against how available I am emotionally
to people as a sister, which is the relationship I find most
divine. I'm not comfortable with having a lover or being a lover.''
She shrugged. ``Maybe I've not run into the right person.''
</P>
<P>
   The upside to celibacy is the amount of time it frees up for
writing. ``Living in the convent often meant living in silence,''
she said. ``You were thrown back on your own resources to be
entertaining. I used my free time for the imagination.'' She also
read a lot, becoming enchanted with Jungian archetypes, especially
the mermaid. Her bathroom is filled with mermaid statues and
drawings. ``It's sort of like living in both worlds, the inner and
outer, being half and half,'' she said. ``That part is like the
nun's life. I work in retail, but my life is really solitary.''

 NEW YORK: really solitary.''  
<TEXT>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Not lonely, though. We set out for the Gracie Mansion Gallery on
St. Marks Place to see an installation she was curious about (she
is a devoted art lover), and while I thought of asking the
questions about fun en route, I couldn't, since people on the
street recognized her and said hi. She visited a while with
Mansion, who also shows the artist Sally Davies, one of Sister
Karol's Margaritaville buddies. ``We're all trying to follow
Karol's advice and have fun,'' Mansion trilled as we left. And that
would be? She closed the door.
</P>
<P>
   We went on to Alphabets, where Sister Karol pointed out one of
her favorite gifts, the Wash Away Your Sins soap set with
washcloth. Then she bought some greeting cards, paying for them
with a platinum American Express card. That must be fun, though I
wouldn't know. Mine is only green.
</P>
<P>
   A few blocks south we climbed the stairs to Davies' apartment,
where Ben Schneider, a manager at Alphabets, was also waiting. The
coffee table was laid out with potato chips and onion dip,
Chee-tos, Gummi Bears and M&AMP;M's. Davies presented Sister Karol with
a margarita straight from the freezer, and she sighed with
pleasure. ``This is what I have to look forward to every Friday,''
she said, sipping.
</P>
<P>
   Davies played a videotape of Sister Karol's recent interview
with Bryant Gumbel. ``Before it started, he said to me, `Sister,
what are you giving up for Lent?''' she recalled. ``And I said,
`Sex.' He almost fell over.''
</P>
<P>
   As we watched the tape, I realized that with all the talking and
eating and drinking and shopping, we had never gotten around to
discussing 10 fun things to do before we die.
</P>
<P>
   Gumbel did, though, listing them at breakneck speed: ``Have More
Fun Than Anyone Else, Get Some Insight, Get Some Depth, Find a
Place to Escape Reality, Write Something at the End of Every Day,
Think About Nuns, Make Yourself Interesting, Live Alone for a
While, Treat Yourself, Live Like You Have Nothing to Lose.''
</P>
<P>
   Television being what it is, Sister Karol barely had time to
explain them, but I remembered the traits she wrote about to watch
for in fun people: ``A good appetite, interesting work, good
storytelling, slightly twisted sense of humor, fresh insight, brave
choices.''
</P>
<P>
   Needless to say, Sister Karol qualifies as a majorly fun person.
Not only that, I finally saw that she had managed, during the
course of the day, to do what every good writer strives for: she
had showed me how to have fun, instead of telling me.
</P>
<P>
   While Davies called for the pizza, Sister Karol walked me
downstairs to get a cab. ``Goodbye, sister,'' she said warmly,
hugging me. I was touched.
</P>
<P>
   ``Goodbye,'' I answered, hugging her back. As the cab took off I
thought about what it might be like. Pizza. Chopped Liver.
Chee-tos. Not so bad. All I'd need to do was convince my husband.
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
   I plan to have a huge kitchen garden this year, with trellises
for beans, peas, gourds, sweet peas and purple hyacinth beans.
</P>
<P>
   And I may plant the big stuff in long farmer rows, about 60 feet
long and 3 feet apart, because I'm tired of Cousin Janice making
fun of my six tomato plants and my little patch of Yukon Gold
potatoes. ``They're too close!'' she says every summer as I put too
many plants or seed potatoes in too small a bed.
</P>
<P>
   So this year, I'm trying her way. Tomato plants five feet apart,
in rows. She doesn't even stake them. Just lets them sprawl on
thick beds of straw. Potato plants two feet apart, heavily mulched.
Doesn't let a single sun ray hit those taters.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would have planted my peas and potatoes already, but I
didn't get the ground worked up last fall,'' Janice said last
Sunday. It was a rare admission.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yup,'' I said, thinking I could get the jump on her if I
planted my peas in compost on top of the wet ground. Or in pots, to
transplant as soon as our Maryland clay, leaden from recent rains,
lightened up a bit. Maybe both. Janice loves a hot competition.
</P>
<P>
   ``My greens are up, though,'' she said. Every spring, she plants
lettuce and spinach seeds in a shallow trench in some protected
place _ next to a wall with a southern exposure, say _ and puts a
board over them while they germinate. She raises the board on warm
days, lowers it on chilly ones.
</P>
<P>
   I told her we'd been eating arugula from the cold frame for
weeks, a whiff of summer in February. The trick is picking the
leaves at midday, when energy is pumping through them. And don't
wash them. Just stick them in a little plastic bag and throw them
in the freezer.
</P>
<P>
   Talking to Janice got my blood running. I planted some old seeds
of Oakleaf, Black Seeded Simpson and Melody spinach in a whiskey
barrel south of the house. While the ground is warming, they'll
germinate and make their first true leaves.
</P>
<P>
   I always plant a lot of mesclun, for cut-and-come-again salads,
planting new seeds every few weeks. As the weather heats up, I
plant them in partial shade, under eggplants or broccoli or
something leafy. This year, I ordered a couple of mesclun mixes
from Renee Shepherd of Renee's Garden (831-335-7228), including her
Heirloom Cutting Mix, which features Speckled Troutback, Blush
Butter Cos, Red Ruffled Oak, Green Devil's Tongue and Sucrine. The
Cook's Garden (800-457-9703) also has some nice ones, like Nicoise,
which includes chicory, endive, dandelion, cress and arugula.
</P>
<P>
   Southern Exposure Seed Exchange (540-894-9480) has some great
lettuces, too, like Deer Tongue, which has triangular crisp leaves,
and something called Thai Oakleaf, which reportedly stands up to
the heat and has ``a distinctive almondlike flavor.'' We'll see.
</P>
<P>
   I ordered a ton of arugula from Cook's Garden, both the common
variety, Eruca sativa, and a smaller, wilder form from Italy called
Selvatica, which has finely cut leaves and is more heat-tolerant. A
wild kale mix for salads also caught my eye.
</P>
<P>
   Seeds of Change (888-762-7333) has some terrific greens like a
lamb's-quarters called Magenta Spreen, whose leaves deepen from
lilac to purple and magenta; tatsoi with spoon-shaped tangy leaves;
and Osaka purple mustard.
</P>
<P>
   Don't forget to plant some shallots and red onions to go with
all those salads, and radishes are also a must. Also, beets! I love
Chioggia for its pink and white rings, and Early Wonder, which
produces lots of delicious green-and-red-veined tops. I usually
order mine from Johnny's Selected Seeds (207-437-4301), which is
also plugging a beet called Red Ace. I had to try it.
</P>
<P>
   Shepherd's collection of Tricolor pattypan squash is
irresistible, producing light green, dark green and gold baby
squashes. Pick them when they're just an inch and a half long,
Shepherd suggests. She eats them braised in chicken broth, onions
and fresh dill.
</P>
<P>
   She and others like Cook's and Territorial Seed (541-942-9547)
are raving about tromboncino, a light green Italian squash shaped
like a little trumpet and best trellised. It's supposed to be
tastier than a zucchini, but what isn't?
</P>
<P>
   I always have to plant Roly Poly, a beautifully mottled green
round squash with a creamy, nutty flavor, sold by W. Atlee Burpee
(800-888-1447).
</P>
<P>
   Territorial is selling green soybeans this year _ Sayamusume is
the variety _ so you, too, can steam those fuzzy pods and feast on
the sweet, nutty-flavored beans inside. Johnny's is offering one
called Butterbean.
</P>
<P>
   I'm also growing some sweet corn this year _ my old favorite
Silver Queen and a new multicolor one from Burpee called Indian
Summer, with white, red, yellow and purple kernels.
</P>
<P>
   As for peas, I'm loyal to Sugar Snaps _ the climbers, not the
short, bushy types _ and for snow peas, Oregon Giant. I usually get
my peas from Cook's, which has a wide variety of shelling peas,
including my all-time favorite, Lincoln, a tasty heirloom. I found
another favorite snap pea, Sugar Ann, at Johnny's.
</P>
<P>
   My tomatoes include Black Krim, an incredibly sweet,
mahogany-purple Russian tomato; Brandywine, a large pink beefsteak
type with intense flavor; Cherokee Purple, originally cultivated by
the Cherokees and supposedly a rival to Brandywine; and Green
Zebra, a gorgeous green-and-yellow striped tomato with a tang. All
from Seed Savers Exchange, in Decorah, Iowa (319-382-5990).
</P>
<P>
   I also want to grow a small field of Rouge Vif d'Etampes, a
widely offered French heirloom pumpkin that is said to have
inspired Cinderella's carriage. It is flame red, deeply ribbed and
very bumpy, and it was first sold in America by Burpee in 1883.
Renee Shepherd tells of chasing some teen-age neighbors down the
street last summer with some of her prize Cinderella pumpkins. ``I
felt like Farmer McGregor,''she said. ``All I needed was my
pitchfork.''
</P>
<P>
   Shepherd is also offering Mignonette, an alpine strawberry that
can be started from seed in pots for the terrace or in hanging
containers, or used as an edging plant in the garden. Set a little
pot of them on the breakfast table, she suggests, and graze while
you're having coffee.

<P>
   RUSSIA-ELECTION (Moscow) _ In an ugly burst of negative
campaigning, Russia's state-owned television has asserted that the
leading liberal candidate in Sunday's presidential election is
supported by Jews, foreigners and homosexuals. The prime-time
attack on Grigori Yavlinsky, the leader of the liberal Yabloko
faction, was broadcast Thursday night by the ORT television
network. By Michael R. Gordon.
</P>
<P>
   POPE-ISRAEL-ASSESS (Jerusalem) _ It was inconceivable that Pope
John Paul II, as he glided serenely though the Holy Land on a
personal pilgrimage and a secondary mission of interfaith healing,
would transform a region characterized by divisiveness and hatred.
Not even for a few days. But despite an outbreak of violence at a
Palestinian refugee camp and the verbal sniping over Jerusalem that
ruined his inter-denominational gathering, the pope has managed so
far to hover above the fray. In doing so, he has presented what
some see as a model of brotherly discourse to religious leaders
here. And he has established a soothing tone that quieted most of
the tensions and made both Israelis and Palestinians feel endorsed
by his visit. A news analysis by Deborah Sontag.
</P>
<P>
   UGANDA-CULT (Kampala, Uganda) _ The Ugandan police said Friday
that they had found the corpses of 153 people, including women and
children, buried under a building used by the cult involved in a
fire last week in which 500 of its members died. (Summary from
wires) By Henri E. Cauvin.
</P>

   CLINTON-PAKISTAN (Islamabad, Pakistan) _ High anxiety has

anticipating that President Clinton will arrive here on Saturday
not just to say hello but to deliver a scolding. By Barry Bearak.
</P>
<P>
   IRAQ-U.N. (United Nations) _ Secretary-General Kofi Annan warned
Friday that the United Nations was in danger of losing a propaganda
war with Saddam Hussein if the ``oil for food'' program designed to
help Iraqis suffering under sanctions was not made more effective
immediately. By Barbara Crossette.

<P>
   GAYS-MILITARY (Washington) _ Harassment of gay men and women in
the American military is widespread, especially in the form of
offensive remarks, derogatory jokes and gestures, and an
overwhelming majority of service members believe their superiors
and colleagues tolerate it ``to some extent,'' according to a
Pentagon survey released Friday. By Steven Lee Myers.
</P>
<P>
   CONGRESS-BUDGET (Washington) _ This year's partisan battle over
the federal budget, which lurched forward early Friday when the
House narrowly passed a Republican tax and spending blueprint, has
a familiar ring to it. Republicans want a big tax cut, more money
for the military and reductions in just about everything else.
Democrats are trying to expand or at least protect spending on a
wide array of domestic programs. Each side is attacking the other
in apocalyptic terms. But it is worth noting that prosperity has
brought the parties closer on fiscal policy than either of them
usually admits. By Richard W. Stevenson.

   SCI-NASA-OBSERVATORY (Undated) _ After a three-month review of
the risks of doing nothing, NASA decided Friday that the safest
course will be to direct the crippled 17-ton Compton Gamma Ray
Observatory to make a suicidal plunge out of orbit and back toward
Earth while they still can control its destructive return to skies
far from inhabited land. The decision disappointed astronomers, who
had hoped for a few more years of observations of the enigmatic
flashes of gamma rays that attest to some of the most bizarre and
powerful phenomena in the universe. By John Noble Wilford.

<P>
   Want to get an earful of radio on the Web? Turn that virtual
dial to these hot sites:
</P>
<P>
   KCRW (www.kcrw.org) is the online home of the Santa Monica
public broadcasting giant. One channel for music, which you can now
click and buy; one channel for news and public affairs programming,
and their live over-the-air feed. The site also archives the
station's prodigious catalog of locally created public affairs
programming, its frequent in-studio performances by prominent
musical acts and more. A treasure.
</P>
<P>
   Spike Radio (www.spikeradio.com), brainchild of Australian Net
baron Chris O'Hanlon, who leveraged his Pacific Rim powerhouse of a
Web design company to create an online-only radio station staffed
with star ``iJays,'' or interactive deejays. The company is adding
Latino and Japanese music sites, and programming like the ``Church
of Fashion.''
</P>
<P>
   soundbreak.com (www.soundbreak.com) features underground dance
music and lots of goodies like a studio cam and chat room revolving
around its stable of digital jocks.
</P>
<P>
   Enigma Digital has a raft of narrowly targeted music-oriented
sites, including KNAC.com (www.knac.com), the old Los Angeles heavy
metal/hard rock FM station reborn. It has deals with two Kiss
members, and offers a variety of tracks, contests and other goodies
for fans of loud guitars, long hair and banshee singers.
</P>
<P>
   Enigma's Groove Radio (www.grooveradio.com) is home to another
L.A. FM fugitive, in this case, the Swedish Egil, whose underground
dance and club sound appeared on KROQ, MARS-FM and elsewhere before
heading Webward. Among recent offerings was a free downloadable
track by Grammy nominee Moby, remixed by Paul Oakenfold.
</P>
<P>
   Enigma also owns Luxuria Music (www.luxuriamusic.com), which
focuses on lounge and retro sounds, with fun articles on topics
such as the late Tiny Tim and offbeat getaways.
</P>
<P>
   Jimmy and Doug's Farm Club, (farmclub.com) is a site where
unknown bands go to get known. Lots of resources, and for the ones
who build a big fan base, a chance to appear on the FarmClub.com TV
show with more prominent acts. Baby bands beware, however: read the
fine print.
</P>
<P>
   MusicBlitz (www.musicblitz.com) is rolling out a series of genre
music sites (such as www.reggaeblitz.com and www.bluesblitz.com)
that give away original music by moderately well-known artists such
as Taj Mahal, Presidents of the United States of America and Aimee
Mann.
</P>
<P>
   Live365.com (www.live365.com) can turn you into a station
manager. So can Shoutcast (www.shoutcast.com). They differ in such
details as how many simultaneous listeners you can have, listener
rating ability and the like.
</P>
<P>
   Launch publishes a monthly CD-ROM ``magazine'' of music,
videogame and movie previews and performances and is beefing up its
online presence (www.launch.com) with all the goodies it gathers
for the CD-ROM and with Launchcast, software that lets you program
a radio playlist from thousands of licensed tracks. It also has
licensed music videos from most of the big labels. &QL;

NINTENDO'S GAME BOY CONTINUES TO DOMINATE HAND-HELD VIDEO GAME

<TEXT>
<P>
   The last month has redefined the video game business worldwide.
In Japan, Sony sold nearly a million Playstation 2 video game
consoles in the first two days on the market. And in California,
Microsoft jolted the industry with the announcement of X-Box, a
Windows PC masquerading as a video game console.
</P>
<P>
   But amid all the noise from the two giants, it's easy to forget
the $4.2 billion industry's greatest ``bit'' player of all _ the
little Game Boy.
</P>
<P>
   With nearly 88 million Game Boys sold in the last decade,
Nintendo reigns as the uncontested heavyweight champion of selling
bantamweight games you can hold in the palm of your hand, boasting
more than 99 percent of the market. And a color version introduced
last year has inspired a new generation of games-to-go that
promises to extend that market domination well into the future.
</P>
<P>
   There has been no lack of challengers, big and small. The most
recent is the Neo Geo Pocket Color, from SNK, of San Jose, Calif.,
marketed as the ``Game Boy-killer.'' But the Neo, like previous
contenders, has failed to break Nintendo's iron grip on the hugely
profitable market for game players that can fit in a bookbag or
ease long car rides _ as opposed to bulkier consoles that must be
tethered to a television set.
</P>
<P>
   ``Game Boy represents about 30 percent of Nintendo of America's
overall revenues,'' said George Harrison, Nintendo's vice president
for advertising and corporate communications. ``We expect that
number to increase to around 40 percent in 2000.''
</P>
<P>
   So what is it that makes the Game Boy such a perennial winner?
</P>
<P>
   ``Lack of a better alternative,'' said Sean McGowan, executive
vice president for research at Gerard Klauer Mattison. ``In its
10-year history, competitors offered nothing that could rival the
price, compactness, library of titles, and ease of use.''

<P>
   Like the Palm organizers, which enjoy an estimated lead of
millions over similar devices running Microsoft's Windows CE
operating system, the Game Boy is a carry-with-you personal
computer that engenders fierce customer loyalty and has so far
proven impervious to competition.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is probably one of the most profitable consumer electronics
devices ever developed,'' McGowan said, estimating that total
retail sales last year topped $1.2 billion.
</P>
<P>
   That is no small feat in an age of flavor-of-the-month desktop
and notebook electronic devices. For 9 of its 10 years, the only
sizeable changes the Game Boy underwent were shedding a few inches
and ounces to make it easier to fit in a pocket or school bag, and
losing its original drab gray finish for flashier colors like red,
yellow, silver and see-through ``Atomic Purple.''
</P>
<P>
   The most significant change was last year's introduction of a
color screen _ a feature that customers had been begging for from
the start. Handheld rivals like the Atari Lynx and Sega Game Gear
offered color years ago, but the novelty backfired. Their bright,
backlit screens drained batteries so fast they would often die in
the middle of a game, and both game machines fizzled.
</P>
<P>
   But Nintendo, like SNK, chose a different technology, a
reflective color LCD screen that minimizes the gadget's size,
weight and battery drain while providing high visibility in normal
lighting conditions.
</P>
<P>
   The Neo Geo's screen is slightly larger than Game Boy Color's
display and offers more than double the number of simultaneous
colors, which translates into richer, more textured graphics, but
it has a long way to go before it can crack Game Boy's dominance.
Nintendo claims that a fresh set of AAA batteries will power a Game
Boy Color for about 20 hours, compared with a scant couple of hours
for older portable color systems.
</P>
<P>
   But McGowan said the ``Pokemon factor'' _ Nintendo's lock on
games based on this trading-card craze _ may have done even more to
spur sales. ``Over 25 percent of the games bought for Game Boy
Color are Pokemon-related,'' he said.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Curiously, the first three Pokemon Game Boy cartridges _ Blue,
Red and Yellow _ make only nominal use of the machine's palette of
32,000 available colors (of which 56 can appear on the screen at
any given time). Even so, they became the three best-selling video
games in 1999. And Pokemon Pinball was the No. 5 best seller, after
Donkey Kong 64 for the Nintendo 64 video game console.
</P>
<P>
   Most new Game Boy games take full advantage of color, though
typically they run on older black-and-white models as well. More
than just consumer-friendly, that backward compatibility is turning
out to be a key to getting existing users to upgrade; one glance at
game packaging showing both versions is enough to make any kid cry
for the color version.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're definitely much richer,'' McGowan said of color games.
``There is more detail, more complexity and depth to the games.
They're written differently to take advantage of the better
graphics.''
</P>
<P>
   In fact, in large part, he credits Game Boy's enduring success
to the developers who create the games that run on it. ``Any old
system can get better with time if developers have a motive to
squeeze more out,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The Game Boy's triumph, though, hasn't been without its share of
hiccups, which led to a slide from about $800 million in sales in
1991 to a low of about $175 million in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   But the decline had more to do with its rocket-like takeoff than
with any real failure, Harrison contends. ``Game Boy never really
hit a slump,'' he said. ``The product has been a consistent seller
since we first introduced it in 1989, but there have been several
sales spikes that do cause this misconception.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Video-game developers are giddy about the Game Boy market. Mike
Ribero, executive vice president of Midway Games, whose products
include NFL Blitz 2000 and Ready 2 Rumble Boxing, says his
company's revenue from Game Boy products rose 45 percent, to $10.9
million, in the first half of fiscal 2000, compared with $7.5
million in the period a year earlier.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are challenges,'' he said, ``in compressing a full game
experience from a coin-op or next-generation home system onto a
platform with more limited technology.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, he has found a way to parlay his company's expertise to
adapt arcade experience to the Game Boy's smaller screen. ``The
focus is on more fun, faster,'' Ribero said. ``They can't rely on
advanced technology and other extras like full-motion videos.''
</P>
<P>
   Such ``extras'' are standard fare on console systems like the
Sony Playstation, Nintendo 64, or Sega Dreamcast, which in power
and capacity are to the Game Boy what a desktop PC is to a Palm
Pilot.
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, Mike Schmitt, producer for the upcoming Tomb
Raider for Game Boy Color, says his team has managed to ``capture
the `spirit and feel' of a Tomb Raider adventure and convert it
into a completely new 2D game.'' All the original animations
depicting the game's heroine, a sort of pixel-pinup-adventurer
named Lara Croft with a huge following among young men, have been
re-rendered.
</P>
<P>
   Pre-release screenshots and animated sequences from the game
reveal a very recognizable version of Lara standing a full 48
pixels tall _ statuesque by the standards of Game Boy, whose
characters are usually only 16 to 32 pixels high. Pixels, or
picture elements, are the dots of light on a television or monitor.
</P>
<P>
   Several coming games promise to inject the Game Boy Color not
only with the essence of their console and computer counterparts
but also with actual characters and virtual ``playing pieces'' from
those games. This will be done with an accessory called the
Transfer Pak, which Nintendo includes with its just-released
Pokemon Stadium. The Transfer Pak plugs into the Nintendo 64 game
controller and accepts Game Boy Pokemon cartridges so that all
those little monsters can populate a more graphically intense, 3-D
environment on a television screen. The Pak, which may also be
purchased separately, is expected to breathe life into other new
games as well.
</P>
<P>
   As for the competition from SNK, ``Neo Geo is getting some
recognition,'' said a New York-area video game retailer who
insisted on anonymity. ``In an average day I sell maybe 20 Game Boy
games and 2 Neo Geo games, but Neo Geo is gaining in popularity,
slowly.''
</P>
<P>
   What isn't slow about the Neo Geo Pocket Color is its graphics.
Its version of Sonic the Hedgehog, for example, plays as
lightning-fast as the older but still fast-paced Sega Genesis
version that inspired it. A fast-growing library of games suggests
that the Neo Geo has a fighting chance at getting a foothold in the
market.
</P>
<P>
   McGowan agrees. ``It's one of the best competitors to Game Boy
that's come along in a long time,'' he said. But it can't play
Pokemon, which Nintendo owns. That, McGowan is quick to remind, is
``a major reason the Game Boy is successful.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, SNK shipped its console-connection feature several months
before Nintendo's Transfer Pak. The first Neo Geo Pocket Color game
to offer the sharing of game-playing between a pocket game and
larger video game system is ``The Match of the Millennium: SNK vs.
Capcom.'' An optional cable connects the handheld game to a Sega
Dreamcast, letting players usher fighters in and out of that
machine's King of Fighters arena.
</P>
<P>
   But Nintendo is not on pause. ``We are not going to let Game Boy
Color fall by the wayside just because new hardware is being
introduced,'' Harrison said. Indeed, by Christmas, the company may
deliver its biggest one-two punch yet, with the much-anticipated
release of its next-generation handheld player, the Game Boy
Advance.
</P>
<P>
   The Advance will have a larger screen and higher resolution _
that is, more pixels, more colors, a faster processor. And it will
have a wireless capability that will turn it into a Web browser and
e-mail reader, and enable the kind of multiplayer online gaming now
enjoyed only by desktop PC gamers _ but on a Lilliputian scale.

<P>
   NEW YORK _ No one ever said that life after modeling is easy.
Besides the pain of makeup withdrawal and the pangs of catwalk
envy, there is also the issue of how to make a living without
simply being fabulous.
</P>
<P>
   Not so for the Danish supermodel _ and runway retiree _ Helena
Christensen, who since last spring has held the impressive-sounding
title of creative director for Nylon magazine, a fashion-oriented
glossy that marked its first anniversary on Wednesday night with a
party at Skirt, a boutique on Mercer Street.
</P>
<P>
   According to its Web site, Nylon is ``the most hot magazine,''
devoted to covering ``life's passionate participants, not it's
fainthearted spectators.''
</P>
<P>
   With grammar like that, there is little doubt that Christensen's
editorial skills are badly in demand. But on Wednesday, the party
seemed more desperate for a little of the spark provided by her
previous vocation.
</P>
<P>
   The event's invitation promised ``cocktails, DJ and beautiful
surprises'' to begin at 8 p.m., but things were slow to ignite.
Christensen was running late, having just arrived from Los Angeles
with her beau, Norman Reedus, and their 5-month-old baby, Mingus.
</P>
<P>
   By 9 p.m., there were lots of normal-looking folks drinking, and
a DJ spinning 1980s music, but still no beautiful surprises.
Inexplicably, two men in Krispy Kreme T-shirts milled about with
glazed donuts and hand-scrawled signs saying, ``Negative
Calories.'' It seemed slightly cruel.
</P>
<P>
   As the crowd waited, Marvin Scott Jarrett, Nylon's editor in
chief, explained Christensen's role at the magazine. ``She's not in
the office every day,'' he said. ``But she contributes to every
issue.''
</P>
<P>
   For April's ``Beautiful Issue'' (is a ``Biotechnology Issue'' in
the works?), Christensen contributed several photographs and a Q.
and A. with Brooke Shields. (Helena: ``You have a boyfriend now.''
Brooke: ``I have a boyfriend now.'')
</P>
<P>
   Jarrett's wife and partner, Jaclynn B. Jarrett, who is Nylon's
publisher, expounded on their star editor's role. ``She's like a
traveling correspondent,'' Jarrett said. ``She goes places and
tells us about it, or brings back what's hot in India, Denmark,
Paris, London.''
</P>
<P>
   As of 9:30 p.m., the traveling correspondent was still out of
pocket. Outside, the paparazzi milled impatiently, taking photos of
each other.
</P>
<P>
   Just then, a tan Christensen came striding up, with Reedus and
an entourage of Danish friends. While a cadre of photographers was
held at bay, Christensen, 31, said in a sidewalk interview that she
had been taking photos since her youth in Copenhagen.
</P>
<P>
   ``Photography is the most thrilling thing in my life,''
Christensen said with a wisp of an accent. ``It's so much more
fulfilling than being on the other side of the camera.''
</P>
<P>
   Not that she had lost any of her old talents. Moments later,
Christensen, dressed in a Dries van Noten skirt and fuchsia
cashmere top, was posing for her fellow shutterbugs, including a
Dr. Strangelove look-alike with a point-and-shoot who kept
shouting, ``Linda! Linda!''
</P>
<P>
   ``Who's Linda?'' Christensen asked.
</P>
<P>
   Inside, a crowd of well-wishers pushed forward to air kiss the
creative director. The mood changed almost immediately. The lights
were dimmed, and sure enough, the model-to-human ratio began to tip
toward the stunning. Gravity-defying necklines became the norm.
Sport-gawking ensued. The Jarretts beamed.
</P>
<P>
   ``What would you give me,'' said one tie-wearing 20-something,
looking at Christensen, ``if I just go up to her and kiss her on
the lips?''
</P>
<P>
   ``Cab fare home,'' his friend said.
</P>
<P>
   By night's end, Christensen, who sipped Champagne through a
straw, had worked her way to the back of the room, and the flashes
had subsided. It was her first drink, she said, since she became
pregnant and her five months of breast-feeding just ended. ``I
wanted to continue,'' she said, ``but he got way more hungry.''

 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service

<P>
   NEW YORK _ Many envelopes will be ripped open Sunday night at
the 72nd Annual Academy Awards. But not one will contain
instructions on how to display a much-hoped-for, much-obsessed-over
Oscar at home so it won't look preposterous.
</P>
<P>
   Yes, this is a little-explored downside to walking away with one
of the 13-inch-high gold statuettes. An Oscar may look great on the
red carpet or on a table at Morton's during the Vanity Fair
after-party. But where can one keep it at home so it doesn't suck
all the air out of the room?
</P>
<P>
   In New York, the city that never sleeps well, it seems more than
a few winners get angst over housing their Oscars. What was once
the holy grail can become the monkey's paw.
</P>
<P>
   ``I used to keep it in an athletic sock in the bottom of a
laundry bag in my apartment in Washington Heights,'' said John
Patrick Shanley, who won the Academy Award for best original
screenplay for ``Moonstruck'' in 1988. He was worried at the time
about thieves. ``It was a really funky building,'' he said. ``There
was no lock in the front door. Instead, there was a bottle cap.''
</P>
<P>
   Shanley lives in Greenwich Village now, yet is still uneasy
about living with a totem of such supposed worth. He keeps his
Oscar behind his television in a tangle of wires, where it is only
partially visible.
</P>
<P>
   Thieves aren't the real issue. ``It's pretentious to even have
one,'' he said. ``They always say `the best' _ the best picture,
the best screenplay. It's sort of acknowledging you beat everybody.
It's not nice to fling it in people's faces. It won't make them
like you. And if you're alone, why would you have it out there?''
</P>
<P>
   ``If you're in a low place, it will make you feel low,'' said
Shanley, who also called the Oscar ``a tombstone'' and ``a living
rebuke.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I like having it, though,'' he said. And on the night he
received it, he recalled, ``I don't know if I would have gotten
into Spago without it.''
</P>
<P>
   Olympia Dukakis, who won an Oscar as best supporting actress for
her role in ``Moonstruck,'' was living in Montclair, N.J., at the
time. ``When I brought it back, I left it on the kitchen table,''
she said. ``Then I had it on a little table in the corner of the
kitchen. I never decided where to put it.''
</P>
<P>
   The quandary was solved when someone broke into her house and
stole it. For $200, the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences
provided a replacement. When Dukakis moved to a NoHo loft last
September _ she plays the starring role in ``Rose,'' which begins
previews at the Lyceum Theater this week _ she put the new Oscar on
the top shelf of a bookcase in her home office. It sits next to a
statue of Astarte, the Phoenician goddess of sexual love, a Golden
Globe and other trophies.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a big plaque up there. What is it?'' Dukakis said,
calling out to an assistant.
</P>
<P>
   She did not put the Oscar in a more prominent spot because ``I
tend not to display things,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   But an Oscar can hide in plain sight, as Donna Gigliotti has
found. Last year Gigliotti took one home as one of the producers of
``Shakespeare in Love,'' which won for best picture. The
statuette's sleek Art Deco lines happen to go with the decor of her
living room on Riverside Drive, she said, adding, ``It's a
beautiful, beautiful thing.'' Though she displays it on a table
near a sofa, guests seldom notice it. ``It's amazing,'' said
Gigliotti, who is head of production at USA Films. ``When they do
notice it, the first thing they do is ask if they can hold it. I
warn them there's an Oscar legend: If you haven't won an Oscar and
you hold one, you never will.''
</P>
<P>
   And what if the problem is having more than one? Stephen
Schwartz, the songwriter, won two with Alan Menken in 1996 _ one
for the original musical score for ``Pocahontas'' and the other for
best song, ``Colors of the Wind.'' The twin Oscars are in a trophy
case in his Connecticut home, ``where they serve as handsome
balancing sorts of bookends'' for his other awards, he said.
</P>
<P>
   He lets friends play with his third, won last year for best
song, ``When You Believe,'' from ``The Prince of Egypt.'' ``I put
it in an easily accessible glass cabinet in my New York apartment,
so that all my friends who ask me about it could pick it up and
hold it,'' Schwartz said. ``The inevitable comment is always, `Hey,
it's heavier than I expected.'''
</P>
<P>
   Barbara Kopple has twice taken honors for best documentary
feature, in 1977 for ``Harlan County, USA'' and in 1991, with
Arthur Cohn, for ``American Dream.'' Her Oscars sit on a desk in
her SoHo loft as part of an artistic arrangement that includes a
large steel sculpture and a mirror.
</P>
<P>
   ``Kids usually pick them up and do a he-man pose,'' she said.
``And then they want a picture taken, so we load the camera. Adults
float over and pick them up and put them down.'' Unlike some
creative people, Kopple isn't conflicted about an Oscar's everyday
presence in her life. ``An award like that gets audiences to look
at these films,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Last year's winner for best short-subject documentary, Keiko
Ibi, said she has yet to find a place for the statuette in her
two-bedroom Greenwich Village apartment. For the moment, it is on a
high shelf in a work area ``so people won't see it so much,'' she
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was my first film, and I was really lucky,'' Ibi said of
``The Personals: Improvisations on Romance in the Golden Years,''
which she made while a graduate student at New York University.
``It's such a big award, it's hard to fit it in the life I had.''
</P>
<P>
   Adam Davidson's film ``The Lunch Date,'' which he made as a
graduate-school project at Columbia University School of the Arts,
was named best live-action short film in 1991. He sent the
statuette to his parents in Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't want to look at it every day,'' said Davidson, who
was then in his mid-20s and is now directing his first feature
film, ``Way Past Cool.'' ``Life is hard enough. I was unprepared
for it to happen. I felt I had a long way to go.''
</P>
<P>
   The parental home was no safe haven, however. Oscar was shaken
off his shelf by the 1994 Los Angeles earthquake. Now the little
guy has ``a big hole in his head,'' the director said.
</P>
<P>
   Sunday night's exhilarated winners might take some tips from
past recipients, not only of Oscars but of other big awards. Four
years after Lawrence Rock, the audio director of the New York
Philharmonic, won a Grammy for recording engineering, his prize, a
miniature gramophone, still spends most of its time in its box. ``I
have hauled it out to show people,'' he said. ``The problem is,
they want to handle it.''
</P>
<P>
   The composer John Kander has Grammys, Tonys and an Emmy, but no
Academy Award. ``If I had an Oscar, I'd keep it near the door to
defend against burglars,'' he said. ``As a weapon, the Tony isn't
worth a damn.''
</P>
<P>
   And here is a radical idea: When Susan Lucci finally won an Emmy
last year after 19 nominations as a soap opera star, she put the
award, her press agent said, ``on her living room mantel, center
stage, above the fireplace.''

NO ONE IN HIS LEAGUE: PETERS OWN THE PBA 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MICHAEL HOLLEY  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Excuse my self-assuredness, but you want to be Chris Peters for
a day. Trust me. I want to be Chris Peters for a day, too.
</P>
<P>
   It doesn't matter if you are male or female; straight or gay;
dark or pale; a young hip-hopper or an aged bebopper; preacher,
poet, or politician. If you are a sports fan, you would love to do
what Peters and two of his business partners recently did. In
essence, they wrote a check, slid it across a desk, shook hands in
good faith, and said the following:
</P>
<P>
   Fellas, we're buying the league.
</P>
<P>
   Who needs Rotisserie Leagues when you can buy (itals)an entire
professional sports league?(unitals) Wait until Pete Rose hears
about this. Baseball wants to ban him for life? No problem. He can
simply buy the Major Leagues, retire all No. 14s, put a slot
machine in every clubhouse and ban Bud Selig and Jim Gray from all
ballparks.
</P>
<P>
   Peters is a 42-year-old dot-com wizard. He is a former vice
president at Microsoft, the company that will one day purchase the
United States and relocate the White House to the Pacific
Northwest. He is a bowling fan who was born in Akron, Ohio,
birthplace of the PBA. His family moved West when he was 2, but the
game was already snaking through his veins. That's part of the
reason he and fellow rich men Mike Slade and Rob Glaser purchased
the PBA for, sources say, $5 million.
</P>
<P>
   So now they own the PBA's logos, trademarks, copyrights, and Web
site. Almost overnight, they switched the PBA from a struggling
nonprofit organization to a stable, privately owned company. They
plan to offer the country's best bowlers stock options. They
envision marketing Parker Bohn III and Walter Ray Williams to those
who view bowlers as if they were the hilariously crazed Monday
Night Leaguers portrayed in the film ``The Big Lebowski.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Movies like `Lebowski' and `Kingpin' don't show what bowling
is about,'' Peters said during a telephone interview Thursday.
``Those guys are losers. The game is not like that. Today's game is
so much different than it was 10 years ago. It's a power game now.
I'm telling you, these guys are athletes.''
</P>
<P>
   Peters talked about the strength of pro bowlers. He described
bowling balls traveling at 25 miles per hour, balls with 300 rpms,
and deceptively strong pros who often hold the ball over their
heads and roll it 700 times during a tournament. There were
references to the 50 million people in the United States who enter
bowling alleys every year. There were references to the 500,000
folks who have visited the PBA's Web site, and how bowling's
ratings are higher than the NHL's and WNBA's, despite the fact that
``the sport has had no marketing.''
</P>
<P>
   Even over the phone, it was obvious that bowling is Peters's
favorite sport. But that's not the only reason he and his partners
purchased his favorite league.
</P>
<P>
   ``We wouldn't do this if we didn't think we could make money,''
he said. ``We don't want this to be a big charity for us. We say we
want to educate people about bowling, but a less polite name for
education is marketing.
</P>
<P>
   ``And it's amazing how much flexibility we have. In baseball,
there are so many factions. There's the umpires, the players, the
owners, and the commissioner. With us, if we want to get something
done we can just do it. We don't need anyone's permission.''
</P>
<P>
   As I talked with Peters, I had to remind myself that I wasn't
talking to one of my buddies during an
If-I-owned-a-pro-sports-league daydream riff. Amazing. He actually
is one of the controllers of the league. He is roughly the same age
as the league that he owns. Thursday, he outlined his stock-options
plan for bowlers. He said he would offer packages to the best
bowlers in the game.
</P>
<P>
   I asked him how he would explain himself to those who didn't
have stock options. What if one asked why the other guy had options
and he didn't?
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd tell him, `Because he's a better bowler,' '' he said.
</P>
<P>
   That's it. No appeals to the Players Association. No arbitrators
overturning the ruling of a commissioner. No unproven rookie
threatening to hold out and play for another team if his contract
demands are not met. Other team? Please. It's my league, son.
You're not going anywhere.
</P>
<P>
   I want to be Chris Peters for a day. You do, too.
</P>
<P>
   Wait until Marty McSorley hears about this. He is suspended for
the remainder of the NHL season for his celebrated clubbing of
Donald Brashear? No problem. Buy the entire league and reinstate
himself.
</P>

   NFL spokesman Greg Aiello chuckled at the buy-a-league scenario
Thursday. But he insisted that it would be impossible to do that in
football. The NFL is basically a partnership with 31 owners. So if
there were to be a sale, a billionaire would have to make
arrangements with each owner and make a sale attractive to him or
her. Aiello sounded doubtful, but I'm not. I have heard about
Microsoft's cash; I have also heard how men such as Art Modell
thirst for cash. Greedy guys can always be bought.

<P>
   Peters is not concerned about the other leagues. His true love
is bowling. He is searching for a PBA president, ``somebody who
wants to run their own league. You know anybody?''
</P>
<P>
   He laughed. He can do that. He is a sports fan who owns his own
league. He can change the rules if he wants. He can require all
bowlers to wear kilts. He can put a picture of himself in every
lane, as if he were some obsessed czar.
</P>
<P>
   Peters was asked if he could see another league being bought.
</P>
<P>
   ``Maybe the USTA,'' he said of the United States Tennis
Association. ``It could happen.''

   What could be more basic to life than a drink of water? Yet more

   Taiwan's election, which ended 50 years of Nationalist rule and
chose as the island's next president Chen Shui-bian, the candidate
of a hitherto pro-independence party, is a clear rebuff to China's
Communists, who claim Taiwan as their own. What will China do now?
The only solution remains for the two sides to decide together,
through negotiation, whether they are to be one China or two. But
as Taiwan changes and China grows ever more inflexible, that
becomes more difficult. Even if a crisis is averted this time, be

Sunday night, Lester and Carolyn Burnham (played by Kevin Spacey

with a manicured lawn and a white picket fence. Although ``American

which it so boldly asserted before the American Revolution. Then it
boycotted English imports by tossing crates of tea into Boston
Harbor. Today the state is boycotting companies which do business
with Myanmar, home of one of the world's harshest military regimes.
Alas, two lower federal courts have ruled that Massachusetts's
well-intentioned foray into foreign affairs is unconstitutional. &QL;

   Oil has become a volatile substance. The world is producing
about 75 million barrels a day (b/d) of the stuff; it is consuming
about 77 million b/d. Nobody likes it that way. Producers and
consumers alike speak of their desire for stable oil prices. Yet
only in times of war or revolution has the price been wilder. Which
is one reason why, as OPEC gathers for its annual meeting in Vienna
on March 27, the hardest question is what will happen next? &QL;

THOMPSON TAKES TO IT LIKE A PRO 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By HOWARD MANLY  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   John Thompson still has strong opinions about college
basketball, but the former Georgetown coach (and Celtic player) is
getting a kick out of calling NBA games for Turner Sports.
</P>
<P>
   Like others, Thompson felt betrayed by some images of NBA
players on television _ the five-second sound bites of Shaquille
O'Neal, for instance, that portray him as a sullen, menacing giant.
Thompson has seen a little more to Shaq.
</P>
<P>
   Thompson was in Miami talking with players before a recent
Heat-Lakers game and he told O'Neal that he was impressed not so
much with his size but with his incredible skills.
</P>
<P>
   ``As a coach I was telling him this,'' Thompson said. ``I mean,
forget his size, Shaq is extremely skillful. He can really play.''
</P>
<P>
   O'Neal thanked Thompson and went on down the court. A moment
later, O'Neal picked up Turner analyst Danny Ainge and was carrying
him around the court.
</P>
<P>
   ``You should have seen it,'' Thompson said. ``He was carrying
Danny around like a little baby.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most people, when they think about Shaq, they think enigma.
But that's not all there is to him.''
</P>
<P>
   Turner personnel told him from the start that he would have to
work hard at broadcasting and would have to start by calling
several exhibition games to prepare for the regular season.
</P>
<P>
   ``Before I got the job, I thought all I would have to do was
show up at game time and start talking,'' Thompson said.
</P>
<P>
   He was wrong. On game day, Thompson talks with players and
coaches during their shootaround, then attends a production meeting
to talk about Turner's coverage. The network also wants him to
study tape of his broadcasts.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't want to look like a fool, and they have been on me to
work at it,'' Thompson said. ``I've probably been interviewed since
I was 14 or 15 years old but I have never been on the other side of
the camera.''
</P>
<P>
   The result has been wonderful insight for viewers and fun for
Thompson. In Miami, he talked with Rick Fox and told the former
Celtic to tell his wife hello. Fox laughed and Thompson laughed.
Fox is married to Vanessa Williams. As Thompson tells the story,
Williams's brother attended Georgetown and was a cheerleader there.
</P>
<P>
   Right, Big John.
</P>
<P>
   Thompson also tells a story about Spurs coach Gregg Popovich:
</P>
<P>
   ``Amid all the talk about Sean Elliott's return, very few picked
up the level of concern that the coach had for Elliott. You could
tell that it was more than points and rebounds that a small forward
could bring to his team. He wanted to make sure that Sean was
healthy and able to play. You could see the coach's personal
struggle over whether he should permit Sean to come back. He was
legitimately concerned and you just don't hear those stories that
much, especially in the NBA.''
</P>
<P>
   The best thing about calling NBA games, Thompson said, is the
freedom to tell another coach's team what to do.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a big difference, coaching without the
responsibilities,'' Thompson said.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Miller on the bandwagon
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   NBC airs The Players Championship Saturday from 2-6 p.m. and
Sunday from 3-6:30. Dan Hicks and Johnny Miller call the action
from Ponte Vedra Beach, Fla. Tiger Woods leads the pack. ``If you
ask me for my top 10 _ they're all Tiger Woods,'' Miller said.
``When you have a guy who drives the ball as far as he does and
makes every putt within 12 feet, you can't stop him. He just has
more horsepower right now than everyone else does and he's brimming
with confidence. That's not a guarantee _ I can see Jesper Parnevik
and Phil Mickelson playing well, and Greg Norman and Fred Couples
like this course. But they've still got to beat Tiger. If Tiger
wins here, you may as well give him the green jacket.'' . . . ESPN
Magazine baseball experts predict tight division races, except in
the AL East and AL Central. The experts did say that 18 of the 30
teams have a shot at the playoffs . . . CNN/SI analyst Ozzie Smith
named the Red Sox the 10th-best team in baseball. ``For Boston to
contend in 2000, they have to get some help for Pedro Martinez in
the rotation,'' Smith said. ``The list of other possible starters
is full of question marks. If the Red Sox can get a dominating year
out of just one other pitcher, they'll be dangerous.'' . . .
``Sports Genuises'' debuts Monday on Fox Sports Net at 6 p.m.
Hosted by Matt Vasgersian and former Patriots cheerleader Lisa
Guerrero, the show features three players competing head-to-head
for two rounds followed by a winner-take-all faceoff round.

   Call it a case of states' rights vs. nations' wrongs. Little
Massachusetts is once again standing up for the democratic values
which it so boldly asserted before the American Revolution. Then it
boycotted English imports by tossing crates of tea into Boston
Harbor. Today the state is boycotting companies which do business
with Myanmar, home of one of the world's harshest military regimes.
Alas, two lower federal courts have ruled that Massachusetts's
well-intentioned foray into foreign affairs is unconstitutional. &QL;

<TEXT>
<P>
   This was meant to be the Pacific century, yet how suddenly the
language of commerce in the world's fastest-growing region can give
way to talk of war.
</P>
<P>
   Taiwan's election, which has ended 50 years of Nationalist rule
and picked as the island's next president Chen Shui-bian, the
candidate of a hitherto pro-independence party, is a clear rebuff
to China's Communists, who claim Taiwan as their own.
</P>
<P>
   They have long said they would meet any move to independence
with force, and recently added that force would also be their
response if Taiwan tried to delay talks on reunification
indefinitely.
</P>
<P>
   They made plain before the poll that Chen was unacceptable. The
Taiwanese elected him anyway.
</P>
<P>
   Will China now make good its threat?
</P>
<P>
   Its leaders, stunned, say they will watch what Chen does and
listen to what he says. And if China does not like what it sees and
hears? Make no mistake, an exchange of shots across the Taiwan
Strait would not simply be a small skirmish in a 50-year Chinese
civil war.
</P>
<P>
   A clash between East Asia's second-largest economy and its
fourth-largest would do huge collateral damage, not least to
financial and trading interests the world over. It would draw in
America, which is committed to help Taiwan if it is attacked.
</P>
<P>
   Others, from Japan to Europe, who value their security ties to
America and profit from the stability these bring could not afford
to turn aside either.
</P>
<P>
   But high stakes can bring opportunities, as well as dangers. For
his part, Chen knows he was elected to fight Nationalist-spawned
corruption, not China. He has already said he will not declare
independence.
</P>
<P>
   This week he offered to meet China's leaders for a ``peace
summit,'' while Taiwan's parliament voted to end the ban on direct
cross-strait trade.
</P>
<P>
   China knows that taking potshots at Taiwan, let alone attempting
a full-scale invasion, and trading threats with America would
frighten away investment, putting China's own economic development
at risk.
</P>
<P>
   A blockade of Taiwan, though easier than an invasion to mount,
would be the surest bar to China's entry to the World Trade
Organization.
</P>
<P>
   And if China's leaders feel pushed by their preelection threats
to demand a casualty or two, they have some: the humiliation of
Taiwan's Nationalists and their leader, the arch-``splittist'' Lee
Teng-hui, who last year infuriated China by calling for relations
to be put on a ``special state-to-state'' basis.
</P>
<P>
   Both sides insist they would prefer peace to war, yet there is a
real risk of stumbling into a conflict by misreading each other's
signals. That is where America can help, since it talks to both and
wants to see tempers cool.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, the only clear point of disagreement this week was one
of semantics: China wants any talks with Taiwan to take place on
the basis of its one-China principle; Chen rejects that as a
precondition, but is prepared to talk about what China means by it.
</P>
<P>
   The solution would seem obvious to any trainee diplomat: set
aside the word-play over ``one China'' and get on with the business
of reconciliation that could lead eventually to reunification.
</P>
<P>
   That may now happen. Chen takes office in May. Time, between now
and then, to switch off the megaphones and prepare for talks that
both sides say they want _ indeed that China insists on.
</P>
<P>
   So, crisis over? If only it were that simple.
</P>
<P>
   That ``one China'' difference is an incendiary one. For years
China, Taiwan and most onlookers, including America, have
subscribed to the notion that there was but ``one China.''
</P>
<P>
   They could then agree to disagree indefinitely about what sort
of China it could be: a Communist dictatorship or a democracy; one
country, two systems (as China insists) or one nation, two states
(as many Taiwanese would now prefer).
</P>
<P>
   But this sleight of diplomacy works only as long as both China
and Taiwan agree that it works. Increasingly, they do not.
</P>
<P>
   By any measure but China's, Taiwan is ``independent,'' with its
own government and currency. It used to enjoy widespread diplomatic
recognition and had a seat at the U.N.
</P>
<P>
   It is an affluent, maturing democracy; China, for all the
wrenching changes of the past 20 years, is a one-party
dictatorship. The gap is growing wider. &QL; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (225-WORD OPTIONAL TRIM BEGINS HERE AT 725) &LR;  &QC; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Crisis? China acknowledges this up to a point, by offering
Taiwan even greater autonomy than either Hong Kong or Macau within
a reunified China.
</P>
<P>
   It notes, rightly, that there is no majority for independence
(its threats ensure that); but it overlooks the fact that there is
even less support for reunification. It is easy to see why.
</P>
<P>
   Binding in East Germany was hard enough for big, rich and
democratic West Germany. Small, rich, democratic Taiwan has plenty
to lose from hitching itself to bigger, but poorer, Communist-run
China.
</P>
<P>
   Egged on by China's military chiefs, its party bosses vow that
the only alternative to negotiated unity is forced unity. They may
mean it. One reason for thinking so is that, with their ideological
pretensions stripped away, they have little to wrap themselves in
but China's flag.
</P>
<P>
   To a visceral nationalist, preventing the loss of Taiwan might
seem the one thing worth risking China's economic stability for,
especially since a democratic and independent Taiwan would pose a
double threat to Communist power.
</P>
<P>
   A second reason is that the grab-Taiwan lobbyists may reckon
that casualty-averse America would soon back off in a shooting war
_ a notion America needs to disabuse them of, if such a war is to
be averted. &QL; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (END OF OPTIONAL TRIM. STORY CONTINUES TO 1,075) &LR;  &QC; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   China may think it can ignore the democratically expressed
feelings of the Taiwanese, but America, Europe, Japan and others
should not. It is not for these outsiders _ including those in
Congress who seem ready to fight China to the last Taiwanese _ to
urge formal independence on Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, just as America must make it clear to China that force
will not be tolerated, so it must go on making it clear to Taiwan
that it cannot deliberately provoke China and then expect to have
others defend it.
</P>
<P>
   The only solution remains for the two to decide together,
through negotiation, whether they are to be one China or two. But
as Taiwan changes and China grows ever more inflexible, that
becomes more difficult.
</P>
<P>
   Even if a crisis is averted this time, be prepared for the next
one. &QL;

WATER: A SOLUBLE _ AND SOLVABLE _ PROBLEM  
 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Commentary Editors)   From the Economist magazine

 (Distributed by the New York Times Special Features)  
<TEXT>
<P>
   What could be more basic to life than a drink of water? Yet more
than a billion people have no access to safe water. Three times as
many lack adequate sanitation.
</P>
<P>
   To disease is added the prospect of drought. Many water tables,
from Mexico to China, are falling by a meter (over three feet) or
more a year. More than half of Europe's cities are exploiting
groundwater at unsustainable rates.
</P>
<P>
   On present trends, world demand for fresh water will grow
sharply, by 70 percent (for household use) by 2025.
</P>
<P>
   Shortages seem inevitable _ and even war.
</P>
<P>
   This dismal reckoning lies behind the big world water summit
held this week in the Netherlands.
</P>
<P>
   As the biggest gathering of everybody concerned about water, it
ought to have marked a real turning point. Yet the summit was let
down by the two groups with the biggest role in shaping policy:
ministers and nongovernmental organizations (NGOs).
</P>
<P>
   The right starting point for them should be to acknowledge that
much of the water is now squandered.
</P>
<P>
   Despite looming shortages, most domestic water use is still not
metered, so householders have no incentive to turn off their taps
and hoses. Worse, subsidies worth billions of dollars serve
positively to encourage water wastage in industry and, above all,
in farming.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever use God intended for the Saudi desert, it was not to
grow wheat. The way to make water available to everybody,
everywhere is rather simple: to price it at a level above the cost
of its provision and disposal.
</P>
<P>
   This would mean that scarce supplies would be put to the best
use by the people who most needed them. And it would make it easier
to get private firms to invest in and improve both water supply and
sanitation.
</P>
<P>
   Here traditionally dirigiste France, home to the world's two
largest water multinationals, has much to teach free-market
America, home to thousands of state-owned and municipal monopolies.
</P>
<P>
   Many state-owned water bureaucracies are bloated and corrupt,
and sanitizing them is beyond even advanced political machinery.
</P>
<P>
   Underregulated private companies can be prone to corruption too.
But France and other countries have learned that governments and
consumers find it easier to impose efficiency and best behavior on
private companies than on their own bureaucracies.
</P>
<P>
   In any case, governments can no longer afford to run the water
business, especially in poor countries. They need private firms to
find the extra $100 billion a year in investment that is needed to
keep the water flowing during the next 25 years.
</P>
<P>
   Although the world's water bureaucrats may understand this
diagnosis, they have too much to lose to embrace the cure. The pity
is that those most likely to shame them into reform, the NGOs, are
equally uncomfortable with being seen to back profits for
multinationals.
</P>
<P>
   Dogma is blinding many to the fact that the people who stand to
gain most from the pricing and private management of water are
precisely those _ the poor and the thirsty _ whom they claim to
represent.
</P>
<P>
   An immediate benefit from pricing would be to encourage the
proper distribution of subsidies. If any subsidies at all are
justified, they should go to the poor.
</P>
<P>
   Rather than money and water flowing to tidy middle-class lawns
and acres of alfalfa, both should go to standpipes in the slums.
</P>
<P>
   But private-sector participation is also the best way to improve
sanitation and supply for the poor.
</P>
<P>
   It was not the government that invested $1 billion in Buenos
Aires to upgrade equipment and expand supplies to 1.6 million
people. It took a joint effort by private firms and government to
provide cheap water to the poor of La Paz.
</P>
<P>
   The poor care far less about profits flowing to private firms
than about water flowing from their taps. &QL;

MIAMI VISE: FUMING TOBACCO INDUSTRY FACES JURY _ AND BANKRUPTCY?  
 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Miami and Tobacco-Industry States)   From the Economist magazine  
 c.2000 Economist Newspaper Ltd.  
 (Distributed by the New York Times Special Features)  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Next month, in Miami, the tobacco industry faces a
jury decision that could impose fines so vast that cigarette firms
might end up in bankruptcy.
</P>
<P>
   This week, the industry won a few legal battles, some relevant
to the wider war, others not.
</P>
<P>
   The upshot just might force debate about America's ``single most
significant threat to public health'' (in the words of the Supreme
Court) into the forum where it belongs, the Congress. But don't
hold your breath.
</P>
<P>
   The decision in Miami stems from a class-action suit brought on
behalf of smokers in Florida. Last July, the Dade County Circuit
Court found the tobacco companies guilty of lying to the public
about the dangers and addictiveness of smoking.
</P>
<P>
   Now the court must decide how much to award first in
compensatory damages and then, crucially, in punitive damages.
</P>
<P>
   The lawyer who represents the smokers has said he wants a $100
billion punishment. The companies are already shelling out $246
billion to help states recoup some of the reputed public-health
costs of smoking.
</P>
<P>
   But for the firms, the immediate problem would not be the
Florida fine itself, which might be reduced on appeal (vast
punitive damages usually are). The problem is that the companies
would have to post a bond to cover the full amount of the damages
plus interest to cover the likely period of any appeal.
</P>
<P>
   In Florida, the amount is about 115 percent of the fine _ i.e.,
perhaps $115 billion. That is nearly three times as much as the
industry's annual sales in America _ which are $45 billion.
</P>
<P>
   So the tobacco companies would be driven into bankruptcy if the
bond were this colossal (Texaco was driven to seek similar
protection after another enormous bond was demanded from it in the
1980s).
</P>
<P>
   The possibility is real enough for the states to have
interviewed bankruptcy lawyers for advice about how to protect
their $246 billion egg if the golden geese all file for Chapter 11.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps they need not worry too much. The tobacco companies,
also, are preparing their defenses. This month, the governor of
Virginia signed into law a bill that caps bond payments in any
appeal against punitive damages at just $25 million.
</P>
<P>
   By amazing coincidence, Virginia is the tobacco headquarters for
the largest of the companies involved, Philip Morris.
</P>
<P>
   A similar measure has passed the Georgia legislature and two
other tobacco-growing states, North Carolina and Kentucky, are
discussing whether to follow suit.
</P>
<P>
   If the Florida court imposes a big fine and the tobacco
companies seek shelter under the laws of their home states, expect
a battle royal of conflicting state jurisdictions.
</P>
<P>
   Tobacco firms are good at playing the game of conflicting
jurisdictions. This week they won an important round in another
area when the Supreme Court struck down attempts by the Food and
Drug Administration to regulate the marketing and production of
cigarettes.
</P>
<P>
   In 1995, the FDA had proposed a set of anti-smoking rules
restricting cigarette advertising in general and banning certain
kinds of cigarette promotion aimed at teenagers. The agency's
justification was that nicotine was a drug, and cigarettes were the
delivery system.
</P>
<P>
   That claim would also have allowed the FDA to determine, say,
the amount of nicotine in cigarettes, or even to ban cigarettes
altogether.
</P>
<P>
   The court decided that this was a claim too far, ruling, by a
narrow 5-4 majority, that Congress had not provided the agency with
authority to do any of this and did not intend the FDA to treat
cigarettes as a drug.
</P>
<P>
   But the justices, both for and against the ruling, went out of
their way to talk about the public-policy issues raised by smoking
_ an action which goes about as far as justices can go in telling
Congress that it, not the courts, should regulate smoking.
</P>
<P>
   Congressional Democrats promptly announced that they would
propose plans to broaden the scope of the FDA's authority. These
plans are not likely to go anywhere this year: the majority
Republican leadership in Congress is against them.
</P>
<P>
   But the chances of legislative action have risen. Al Gore wants
it. George W. Bush says that ``tobacco regulation should be made by
Congress and state legislatures.''
</P>
<P>
   Even the tobacco companies are in favor of some sort of
legislative action, so long as cigarettes are not treated as a
drug.
</P>
<P>
   The only question is what sort of tobacco industry will still be
around to be regulated after the verdict in the Miami court. &QL;

<P>
   The American economy has all sorts of enviable attributes. Yet,
as even its most devoted admirers must admit, the great machine,
just occasionally, emits a distinctly bubblish burp.
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes this fizz comes in the form of official economic
statistics; but the more remarkable things often spring from less
closely watched numbers _ the number of Ferrari dealerships in the
Bay Area, the price of English nannies in Manhattan, the fashion
for gold-thread suits.
</P>
<P>
   We begin an occasional series on such phenomena with a look at a
much more solid structure _ the 100,000 tons of concrete that are
about to cease being the giant Kingdome sports arena in Seattle.
</P>
<P>
   At 8:30 a.m. on March 26 some 6,000 carefully placed charges of
gelignite will erupt throughout the Kingdome's vertical columns and
arching ribs. Within 20 seconds, pulverized, the 67,000-seat
stadium will fold in on itself like concrete origami.
</P>
<P>
   It is an ingeniously high-tech way to kiss goodbye to an
old-economy icon (concrete is depressingly unvirtual).
</P>
<P>
   All the same, it is an odd bit of urban renewal. The Kingdome,
completed in 1976 at a cost of $67 million, is decades away from
the end of its useful life.
</P>
<P>
   There is no reason why it could not continue to welcome American
football and baseball games, not to mention the usual stream of
Billy Graham revivals, Rolling Stones concerts and monster-truck
derbies.
</P>
<P>
   Only four years ago, the county government invested $70 million
in it, mainly to replace ceiling tiles.
</P>
<P>
   The Kingdome's problem is that in these fizzy times being useful
and being there are not enough; sports stadiums have to be new.
</P>
<P>
   Last summer the Seattle Mariners, the city's baseball team,
decamped to a new, $530 million retractable-roof stadium located a
few hundred yards away.
</P>
<P>
   Paul Allen, the co-founder of Microsoft, agreed to buy the
Seattle Seahawks, the local American football team, only if state
taxpayers coughed up most of the money for a new $430 million
football-only stadium on the site of the Kingdome.
</P>
<P>
   The plan was approved in a referendum (to be fair, Allen
generously put up the $4.3 million needed to arrange the vote).
</P>
<P>
   Robert Baade, an economist at Lake Forest College in Illinois
who studies sports stadiums, points out that Seattle is hardly
alone in tearing down a perfectly sound building.
</P>
<P>
   During the past decade about half the stadiums in the nation
that house football, baseball, basketball or hockey teams have been
replaced _ usually to lure new teams to a city, or, in the case of
Seattle, to prevent the departure of existing teams.
</P>
<P>
   During the 1980s, America spent around $1.5 billion on new
sports stadiums; in the 1990s, it spent $11 billion.
</P>
<P>
   The Miami Heat basketball team will soon follow the Florida
Panthers ice-hockey team out of the facility they once shared, even
though it is only 13 years old. The Florida Marlins would also like
a new home.
</P>
<P>
   New York's normally frugal mayor, Rudy Giuliani, seems to have
abandoned an economically absurd plan to build a new $1 billion
home for his beloved Yankees in Manhattan; but he still seems keen
on spending $700 million in the Bronx.
</P>
<P>
   In Boston, Fenway Park is in danger.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the last laugh may be on Seattle. The Kingdome's main
attraction when it was built was its roof. Recently, an unusual
weather pattern called the Pacific Decadal Oscillation has produced
warmer, drier weather than the Seattle norm.
</P>
<P>
   Alas, that seems to be at an end, say meteorologists. The new
football stadium provides only limited cover against the returning
rain. &QL;

GUTTER PREVENTS DRIP STAINS

<P>
   Q. My copper roof has turned to a nice green color, but dripping
water from a part of it has stained the concrete steps below a
green that looks like spray paint. How can I clean it, and how can
I keep it away?
</P>
<P>
   ANNETTE FLAHERTY, Southborough, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   A. Try a bleach solution, Zud, or muriatic acid on the stain.
The latter will etch the concrete by leaching lime out of it, and
may take the stain with it. Wear skin and eye protection when
working with bleach or acid. Even hydrogen peroxide might help. Or,
make a poultice of 1 part ammonium chloride (sal ammoniac) and 4
parts whiting made into a paste with household ammonia. Apply over
stain, let dry. Repeat if necessary. Rinse and dry. Ammonium
chloride and other chemicals can be bought at a chemical supply
house.
</P>
<P>
   You can prevent the stain one way: Put up a gutter and a
downspout on that part of the roof. Even a copper gutter will be
OK, as long as the downspout goes into the ground or a drywell. To
allow copper-laden water to run over grass could result in a dead
lawn.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. My sliders are mahogany, a nice-looking wood but I am having
trouble finishing them. I don't think they were ever finished, and
they turned gray when they weathered. I sanded to the bare wood,
stained, and finished with three coats of oil-based exterior
polyurethane varnish. Now, a year later, the wood is weathering
again, but not peeling. What can I do?
</P>
<P>
   MARIA JACOBSON, Acton, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   A. I don't know of any varnished exterior surface that stands up
to sunlight and other kinds of weather for very long. Your mahogany
sliders are an example of what happens.
</P>
<P>
   Your first priority is not to do it again. You have three
choices: 1. Let the weathering continue until all the finish is
off, then let it continue to weather. Mahogany naturally resists
decay, and if it gets wet and dries out after each wetting, it will
last indefinitely. 2. Remove the finish and let it weather. 3.
Remove the finish and treat the mahogany with one coat of a
semitransparent house stain. It will not peel, and will last for
five years.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. I would like to restore a 1953 porcelain sink that has two
dings and is fairly heavily abraded; the bottom is rough and
porous, the back and top edges are sill shiny. I was told by
reglazers that reglazing does not stand up very much on sinks
(bathroom or kitchen) that take a bigger beating than tubs. Is
there a reglazing that will stand up?
</P>
<P>
   TOM GOUX, Falmouth, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   A. If porcelain does not stand up, any kind of epoxy coating
(the usual reglazing technique) is unlikely to stand up, either,
and the reglazers, to their credit, were very straight with you
about sinks.
</P>
<P>
   Forty-seven years is pretty good for a porcelain sink to last,
although I'll bet those dings occurred in the first week of the
sink. My porcelain sink was wonderful for the first week or so,
then, ding! That is why I switched to stainless steel, much less
attractive.
</P>
<P>
   So, I assume reglazing is not in the cards, but what is? You can
try this: For the dings, touch them up with appliance touch-up
enamel. You can get the right color at a hardware or paint store.
For the dull finish, there is an old homemade formula mentioned by
the handyman a thousand times. It will not restore the shine, but
chances are good that the sink will look almost new again. Wet the
dull area with hydrogen peroxide. Sprinkle cream of tartar on the
finish and leave it for an hour. Scrub and rinse. For some reason,
this treatment seems to make the finish less porous. Otherwise,
bite the bullet and get a new sink.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. I saw some great self-countersinking screws that need no
predrilling at a home show some years ago. Now that I need them, I
can't find them. I have to drive screws into particleboard which is
so hard that nothing seems to work. Do you know of such screws?
</P>
<P>
   JIM WANTSMAN, North Reading, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   A. I think you were thinking of deck screws, which can be driven
without predrilling with a power screwdriver, even into
pressure-treated wood, which is Southern yellow pine, a very hard
softwood. But particleboard, especially the new superdense stuff,
needs predrilling a pilot hole for each screw.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. Can I pressure-wash vinyl siding? The siding needs a lot of
cleaning.
</P>
<P>
   SHEILA SMITH, Walpole, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   A. Gee, didn't the vinyl siding people say no maintenance? How
the idol has fallen. Of course your vinyl siding needs washing. Any
outside surface will get dirty (and moldy). But no, do not
pressure-wash vinyl siding or aluminum siding. This siding is put
together with interlocking joints, but if any water under pressure
gets under the siding, it will take a long time to dry out, and if
water stays there too long, it can cause decay. You can have it
done the regular way, scrubbing and rinsing with a garden hose.

THE EXTRAORDINARY MUTATION OF AMERICA'S SUBURBS  
 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Commentary Editors...TIMELY for Sunday's Oscars!) (NOTE: 3 trims, totaling 225 words; 1,100 uncut)  
  
 From the Economist magazine  
 c.2000 Economist Newspaper Ltd.  
 (Distributed by the New York Times Special Features)  
<TEXT>
<P>
   In ``American Beauty,'' the favorite movie to sweep the Oscars,
Lester and Carolyn Burnham (who are played by Kevin Spacey and
Annette Bening) live in a picture-perfect house in the suburbs,
with a manicured lawn and a white picket fence.
</P>
<P>
   Carolyn spends her spare time pruning her roses (the American
beauties of the title), her gardening clogs color coordinated with
the handles of her pruning shears; Lester helps keep the house neat
and tidy.
</P>
<P>
   It all looks like a commercial designed to show how normal the
Burnhams are. And it is all, needless to say, a total farce.
</P>
<P>
   Carolyn is actually a robotic and judgmental shrew. Lester is a
shell of a man who falls head over heels for one of his daughter's
friends, a sexually charged cheerleader. As for the daughter, she
is a screwed-up misfit who dreams of murdering her father.
</P>
<P>
   The only way anyone can find fulfillment (however fleeting) is
to subvert the suburban conventions.
</P>
<P>
   Lester throws in his job to spend his days inhaling enormous
quantities of marijuana. Carolyn has an affair with the local
real-estate magnate.
</P>
<P>
   ``American Beauty'' is somewhat redeemed by fine acting and a
few riveting set pieces. But in the end what is most striking about
the film is not its cleverness, as so many critics are claiming,
but its utter lack of originality.
</P>
<P>
   The film simply recycles a view of the suburbs _ that they are
vortexes of tedium and alienation _ which has been a staple of
artistic contempt at least since John Cheever.
</P>
<P>
   This view has probably never been very accurate. (Herbert Gans,
a sociologist at Columbia University, shot it full of holes in
``The Levittowners'' more than 30 years ago.) But it is getting
less accurate by the day, as the suburbs mutate in all sorts of
extraordinary ways.
</P>
<P>
   If the complaints about the suburbs are doomed to remain forever
the same, the suburbs themselves are changing beyond all
recognition.
</P>
<P>
   The most obvious change is that the suburbs are the smithies of
almost everything that is new and innovative in the American
economy.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft sits in a suburb of Seattle. Silicon Valley is an
unappetizing sprawl of modest (though costly) bungalows and strip
malls.
</P>
<P>
   To an English duke, Beverly Hills, Bel Air and the rest of
mogul-land is simply a sunnier version of Surrey (an alarming
number of the houses are mock-Tudor); yet they also constitute one
of America's most impressive industrial clusters.
</P>
<P>
   ``The new economy and the new suburbs are really the same
thing,'' as Fred Siegel at New York's Cooper Union University puts
it.
</P>
<P>
   In much the same way as the manufacturing revolution led to the
compact urban city of the 19th century, and the arrival of the car
created the bedroom suburbias of the 20th century, information
technology is allowing jobs to be dispersed hither and thither.
</P>
<P>
   People no longer need to travel to the city to find jobs, shops
or even entertainment; they can live their whole life in the
suburbs.
</P>
<P>
   The suburbs are also becoming ever less monolithic and
bourgeois. Suburbs can be blue-collar, like Dundalk in Baltimore
County, or ultra-liberal, like Marin County near San Francisco. &QL; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (FIRST OPTIONAL TRIM _ 100 WORDS _ BEGINS HERE AT 550) &LR;  &QC; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Increasingly, though, some are a social jumble within
themselves. In Southern California's San Fernando Valley,
multimillion-dollar homes owned by young bucks from Warner Bros.
share the same zip code as bungalows with roosters in the yard.
</P>
<P>
   Joel Kotkin, an urban analyst at Pepperdine University, points
out that there is a world of difference between what he calls
``midopolizes'' _ old-fashioned inner suburbs that increasingly
suffer from the same maladies as the old inner cities _ and outer
``nerdistans,'' like Irvine, an Orange County, Calif., suburb which
is dominated by high-tech companies and seems to treat jaywalking
as a newsworthy crime. &QL; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (END OF FIRST OPTIONAL TRIM) &LR;  &QC; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Nor are the suburbs the all-white enclaves that metropolitan
sophisticates imagine. Atlanta, Chicago and Washington, D.C., all
have thriving black suburbs.
</P>
<P>
   In Southern California the new Chinatowns and little Saigons are
in the suburbs rather than downtown.
</P>
<P>
   The best Chinese food in the United States is to be found in the
burgeoning Sino-suburbia east of Los Angeles, where the
supermarkets sell pig snouts and live carp, and where shopping
malls sometimes contain restaurants from five different provinces
of China.
</P>
<P>
   Many of the most ethnically diverse places in the country are
now suburbs.
</P>
<P>
   This is not to say that the suburbs have completely solved the
problem that obsesses their critics: alienation. A little
alienation is inevitable in places that lack both natural centers
and public spaces. &QL; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (SECOND OPTIONAL TRIM _ 75 WORDS _ BEGINS HERE AT 775) &LR;  &QC; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In one of America's two smartest television comedies, ``King of
the Hill,'' Hank and his Texan friends spend most of their time
standing in the alley at the back of their suburban tract homes,
downing beers; the other, ``The Simpsons'' is set in a town that
might be described as a suburb brought together by a nuclear power
station. &QL; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (END OF SECOND OPTIONAL TRIM) &LR;  &QC; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Yet many suburbs are trying valiantly to create a sense of place
and public purpose. Older suburbs like Pasadena and Santa Monica in
California and Downers Grove and Highland Park near Chicago have
rebuilt their historic town centers, to great effect.
</P>
<P>
   Newer suburbs are creating downtowns from scratch. Reston, Va.,
a new development near Dulles Airport, has even created a passable
facsimile of a 1920s downtown.
</P>
<P>
   ``American Beauty'' is not the first time that the entertainment
industry has become so obsessed by a formula that it forgot to look
at the world _ though the fact that the most spectacular evidence
of these changes is happening on the moguls' own doorstep is a bit
galling. (``They may live in L.A.,'' sneers Kotkin, ``but their
minds were formed in Manhattan.'') &QL;

   But caricatures have consequences. The idea that compact cities
are somehow preferable to sprawling suburbs lay behind one of the
most pointless engineering feats in human history: the Los Angeles
subway, which has cost billions of dollars (not to mention the
lives of several construction workers) but which is almost
irrelevant to the needs of a city without a core. &QL;

   Now Al Gore, the Democrat seeking the presidency, wants to start
a crusade against ``sprawl.'' An odd idea when you consider that
most of his potential electorate now lives in that sprawl, and seem
to like it; and a dangerous one, once you acknowledge that sprawl
is now the home of almost everything that is most vital and daring,
if not most beautiful, in America. &QL;

MASSACHUSETTS IN HOT WATER OVER BOYCOTT. TEA, ANYONE?  
 
</HEADLINE>
   From the Economist magazine  
 c.2000 Economist Newspaper Ltd.  
 (Distributed by the New York Times Special Features)  
<TEXT>
<P>
   For a Supreme Court determined to assert and expand states'
rights, it sounds like the dream case.
</P>
<P>
   Little Massachusetts is once again standing up for the
democratic values which it so boldly asserted before the American
Revolution.
</P>
<P>
   Then it boycotted English imports, and its residents famously
chucked a few cases of tea into Boston Harbor.
</P>
<P>
   Today the state of Massachusetts is boycotting companies which
do business with Myanmar, the country formerly known as Burma and
now run by one of the world's harshest military regimes.
</P>
<P>
   Who could be against that? Well, to name a few, dozens of
American and foreign companies, an ex-president, two ex-secretaries
of state, some 20 members of Congress, plus Japan, the European
Union and the Clinton administration.
</P>
<P>
   So far, two lower federal courts have ruled that Massachusetts's
well-intentioned foray into foreign affairs is unconstitutional.
</P>
<P>
   In an oral hearing on March 22, the National Foreign Trade
Council, and its stellar array of supporters, asked the Supreme
Court to do the same, and to bring to a screeching halt the
proliferation of local and state selective-purchasing laws.
</P>
<P>
   Massachusetts, supported by a long list of churches,
human-rights groups, dozens of city and state governments, and its
own even larger band of congressmen, asked the court to uphold its
law.
</P>
<P>
   Massachusetts passed the law in 1996 in a fit of
self-righteousness. It bars state agencies from buying goods or
services from most firms, foreign or domestic, which do business
with Myanmar.
</P>
<P>
   At the time this seemed like little more than a harmless bit of
gesture politics. But, to general amazement, Apple, Kodak and
Hewlett-Packard soon pulled out of Myanmar, citing the
Massachusetts law.
</P>
<P>
   The state's blacklist included European and Japanese firms,
among them Toyota, Sony and Siemens. This, in turn, provoked an
angry reaction from Japan and the EU.
</P>
<P>
   They first protested to Washington, and then took the more
serious step of launching a formal complaint at the World Trade
Organization in Geneva, charging that the Massachusetts law
breached the obligation of the United States under the WTO's
agreement on open government procurement.
</P>
<P>
   All sides agree that Myanmar is ruled by a bunch of thugs. The
United States, the EU and Japan have all imposed sanctions against
Myanmar. But should lowly Massachusetts have the same right?
</P>
<P>
   In striking down the law, the federal appeals court in Boston
found that a state has no authority to regulate conduct beyond its
borders and that the Massachusetts law ``interferes with the
ability of the federal government to speak with one voice.''
</P>
<P>
   The National Foreign Trade Council adds that the Constitution
clearly gives the federal government the exclusive right to conduct
foreign relations and to regulate foreign trade. It also claims
that the state's law conflicts with the federal government's own
sanctions.
</P>
<P>
   Massachusetts disputes all these points. It argues that its law
does not regulate anything, but only disassociates the citizens of
Massachusetts from a vile regime by spending their money in a way
that they approve of.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nothing in our federal Constitution denies to the states the
right to apply a moral standard to their spending decisions,'' the
state argues in its legal brief.
</P>
<P>
   As for the idea that it contradicts federal law, Douglas Kmiec,
a law professor at Pepperdine University in California, points out
that Congress passed its anti-Burma law three months after the
passage of the Massachusetts law, was well aware of it, and chose
not to preempt it explicitly, which even Massachusetts agrees it
had the power to do.
</P>
<P>
   So why should the court now do what Congress declined to do?
Kmiec, who served as an assistant attorney-general in Washington in
the 1980s, says that the Reagan administration had a fierce
internal debate about whether to oppose similar local laws aimed at
South Africa.
</P>
<P>
   Ronald Reagan disliked anti-apartheid sanctions. But he disliked
the idea of constricting states' rights even more. Kmiec helped to
dissuade the administration, on federalism grounds, from
challenging in court any of the 23 states and 80 cities that had
anti-apartheid purchasing laws.
</P>
<P>
   The Supreme Court could be equally torn. At the oral hearing
Massachusetts's assistant attorney-general faced skeptical
questions from the liberal justices who have opposed the expansion
of states' rights.
</P>
<P>
   And yet after further consideration, they could be swayed by the
human-rights goals of the state's law.
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, a few of the five conservative justices who
have backed states' rights in recent years, most notably Chief
Justice William Rehnquist, have also supported the view that
foreign affairs should be preeminently national in scope.
</P>
<P>
   If the court does find in Massachusetts's favor, it will present
the next administration with something of a dilemma. The EU and
Japan could revive their WTO complaints, which they let lapse after
the Massachusetts law was struck down by a lower court.
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton administration had said it would vigorously defend
the law against the WTO complaints. That will be a difficult thing
for any administration to do, now that the federal government is
asking the Supreme Court to strike down the law. &QL;

THE TAXING DILEMMA OF E-COMMERCE  
 
</HEADLINE>
   From the Economist magazine  
 c.2000 Economist Newspaper Ltd.  
 (Distributed by the New York Times Special Features)  
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ With the Internet currently displacing motherhood and
apple pie at the top of the list of American virtues, proposals to
tax the Net are not popular.
</P>
<P>
   Presidential candidates queued up to pledge how they would stop
the taxman plunging his grubby hands into cyberspace.
</P>
<P>
   The hitch? If e-commerce grows anything like as quickly as
predicted, failing to tax it could do serious damage to the
finances of America's state and local governments, which depend on
sales taxes for much of their revenues.
</P>
<P>
   This week, in Dallas, the final scheduled meeting took place of
the Advisory Commission on Electronic Commerce. Set up by Congress
under the revealingly-named 1998 Internet Tax Freedom Act, the
commission was supposed to hammer out a compromise between business
and local politicians.
</P>
<P>
   So far it has managed to achieve its mandated two-thirds
majority only on things like protecting online privacy and
scrapping the federal government tax on Internet access charges (no
cost for state governors there).
</P>
<P>
   On the main battleground between the taxman and e-business, only
11 of the 19 commissioners could be mustered to vote for a set of
proposals that essentially continue the status quo.
</P>
<P>
   These include an extension of the current congressional
moratorium on new Internet taxes (a proposal which John McCain
immediately put into a new Senate bill).
</P>
<P>
   The commission members who would not support the measure were
all representatives of the tax authorities. The commission's
chairman, James Gilmore, claimed the vote as a success. But he is
governor of Virginia, a state which hosts big e-commerce companies
such as America Online.
</P>
<P>
   According to Kent Johnson, a tax partner at KPMG, the failure to
achieve a two-thirds majority makes it hard for Congress to push
though legislation. Although the commission has given itself
another 30 days in which to reach the two-thirds target by phone,
the chances are slim.
</P>
<P>
   In some respects, a further ban on new Internet taxes is neither
here nor there, because the real problem is the difficulty of
collecting those old taxes that should already apply to e-commerce.
</P>
<P>
   Thanks to rulings by the Supreme Court, states cannot require
out-of-state retailers to collect sales taxes on goods coming into
the state unless the retailer has a physical presence or ``nexus''
within that state. This seems largely to exempt online-only
retailers such as Amazon from tax collection.
</P>
<P>
   It may also offer a loophole for the growing online operations
of older retailers. Customers buying from an out-of-state retailer
are usually supposed to volunteer a ``use'' tax on the value of
that good. Few ever bother.
</P>
<P>
   Congress could change the law, ending the out-of-state exemption
from tax-collection. The states might act against their narrow
self-interests, and collectively create a nationwide sales-tax
system.
</P>
<P>
   James Eads at Ernst &AMP; Young even thinks there is a chance that
the Supreme Court will change its mind. But none of these solutions
is likely.
</P>
<P>
   This may not seem much of a problem now, while the state coffers
are overflowing with money and e-commerce is in its infancy. But
the longer nothing is done, the more customers will become
accustomed to avoiding taxes when shopping online _ and the more
unpopular will be any attempt to change that situation. &QL;

SUNDAY: `AND THE WINNER IS...VLADIMIR PUTIN.' (ACT SURPRISED)  
 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (TIMELY for Sunday's election, Russia)   From the Economist magazine  
 c.2000 Economist Newspaper Ltd.  
 (Distributed by the New York Times Special Features)  
<TEXT>
<P>
   MOSCOW _ It has not been much of a contest. Only the scale of
the victory is in doubt.
</P>
<P>
   The front-runner for the past six months, Acting President
Vladimir Putin, has produced no detailed manifesto or campaign
material, and declines to debate with other candidates.
</P>
<P>
   His most serious opponents were crushed in the parliamentary
elections three months ago. The rest, mostly marooned in the low
single figures, have ideas aplenty, but scant chance of getting
them across to the electorate.
</P>
<P>
   The issue that most excites outsiders, Chechnya's war, barely
rates a mention.
</P>
<P>
   Many of Putin's official duties in past weeks, however, look
very like campaigning. He has been touring the provinces, having
lots of carefully staged impromptu meetings with ``ordinary
Russians,'' issuing popular decrees (raising teachers' wages by 20
percent, for instance) and outlining his ideas for the future.
</P>
<P>
   These include banning food imports, bolstering the
military-industrial complex, bringing independent-minded regions
under control, and cutting overly-important, politically-connected
tycoons _ the ``oligarchs'' _ down to size.
</P>
<P>
   Most of Russia's television channels cover all this with
drooling appreciation, while ignoring the other ten candidates.
</P>
<P>
   For a trip to the troops in Chechnya, Putin arrived in a fighter
jet. This, he said, saved the taxpayer money. He also happened to
let slip shyly that for part of the way he had flown the plane
himself. ``I had a feeling very close to ecstasy,'' he confessed.
</P>
<P>
   This week he also urged voters to give him at least 50 percent
of the ballot: a second round, he argued, would waste $35 million
better spent on pensions.
</P>
<P>
   Putin's main opponent is the perennial Communist loser, Gennady
Zyuganov. His party still has a strong organization and some loyal
governors.
</P>
<P>
   With a better leader and a fair share of airtime, the Communists
could gain more than their customary 25 percent. But Zyuganov's
grey personality and hoary simplicities turn off many voters.
Conveniently for Putin, two fringe leftist candidates also siphon
off some Communist support.
</P>
<P>
   Even if the election does go to a second round in two weeks'
time, Zyuganov looks set to be trounced, even more soundly than he
was by Boris Yeltsin in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   Other candidates look even less significant. Grigory Yavlinsky,
the liberal-minded leader of Yabloko, the main center-left party,
has fought an energetic campaign. He has even dared to speak out
against the war in Chechnya, which he originally supported.
</P>
<P>
   He is in trouble with the authorities for having campaigned on
the territory of a military base, an infringement that evidently
does not apply to acting presidents handing out medals or attending
funerals.
</P>
<P>
   The other self-professed liberal candidate is the governor of
Samara, Konstantin Titov. He has been abandoned by his allies from
the Union of Right-Wing Forces.
</P>
<P>
   This free-market, pro-western party, which did better than
expected in the December parliamentary elections, now looks split.
Some of its leading lights, like a former privatization chief,
Anatoly Chubais, and Yegor Gaidar, a free-market former prime
minister, are keen supporters of Putin's.
</P>
<P>
   A few notables, such as Boris Nemtsov and Irina Khakamada, have
switched to Yavlinsky. Others are queasy, but support Putin on
tactical grounds. Titov looks set to get 1 percent.
</P>
<P>
   One new feature of the campaign has been an attempt by some
Moscow intellectuals to encourage a vote ``against all.'' If a
majority opts for this odd feature of the Russian ballot paper, the
poll becomes invalid.
</P>
<P>
   So far, ``against all'' seems to be running in fourth place,
with around 4 percent, a shade ahead of Vladimir Zhirinovsky, the
far-right populist xenophobe who heads the oddly-named Liberal
Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   Supporters of the ``against all'' campaign are calling for a
boycott of any western consumer-goods company which advertises on
the pro-Putin television channels.
</P>
<P>
   The only thing that might still spoil the script is the war.
Putin's support has dropped by about a quarter from its peak,
perhaps because most Russians now favor a negotiated settlement.
</P>
<P>
   Russian war casualties are still high, and a two-week-old battle
for Komsomolskoye, a ruined village that Russian forces claimed to
have taken in a day but have yet to subdue, has punched holes in
the sunny official picture.
</P>
<P>
   So has a report of a Chechen light aircraft discovered in
Grozny, which has supposedly been under complete Russian control
for a month. Russian officials constantly give warning of planned
terrorist outrages by Chechens.
</P>
<P>
   The most significant feature of the election is not the
all-but-certain result but the comprehensive way in which the
Kremlin has managed to control the campaign.
</P>
<P>
   As it happens, Putin has no real opponent. Even if he did, the
government's grip on the media, combined with a harshly and
arbitrarily interpreted election law, means that it would have been
hard for anyone else to have a fair crack at the prize. &QL;

&HT;     PENTAGON FINDS WIDESPREAD HARASSMENT OF GAYS IN UNIFORM 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     (Eds: EDITS and updates throughout.)  
 &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By ERIC ROSENBERG And STEWART M. POWELL  
 &HT;     c.2000 Hearst Newspapers  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The Pentagon admitted Friday that there is
widespread harassment of homosexuals in the military, reporting
that 80 percent of GIs questioned around the world had heard
anti-gay remarks in the past year and that 37 percent had witnessed
or experienced harassment.
</P>
<P>
   Saying that ``we simply cannot tolerate harassment in the armed
forces,'' Defense Secretary William Cohen launched an emergency
effort to combat what he called ``harassment based on perceived
sexual orientation.''
</P>
<P>
   Several hours before the public release of the report Cohen
announced he was establishing an oversight panel of senior military
and civilian leaders to map steps to combat the problem. He said
the panel will try to change the hostile atmosphere that gay and
lesbian troops often encounter and that by July 31 it will produce
an ``action plan'' for improving the situation.
</P>
<P>
   Cohen acted in response to a report by the Pentagon's deputy
inspector general, Donald Mancuso, who surveyed more than 71,570
men and women among the nation's 1.4 million troops.
</P>
<P>
   The survey, conducted at 38 bases and aboard Navy ships, gauged
the troops' experiences under the Clinton administration's
controversial ``don't ask, don't tell, don't pursue'' policy that
was inaugurated in 1993 to enable homosexuals to serve more freely
in the armed forces.
</P>
<P>
   The report said 80 percent of the respondents ``stated that they
had heard offensive speech, derogatory names, jokes or remarks
about homosexuals in the last 12 months.''
</P>
<P>
   It also found that 85 percent said they believed ``such comments
were tolerated to some extent.'' Of those surveyed 37 percent
``responded that they had witnessed or experienced an event or
behavior toward a service member that they considered to be
harassment based on perceived homosexuality.''
</P>
<P>
   The majority of those surveyed, 57 percent, said they had ``not
had training'' in connection with the Pentagon's policy of
tolerance toward homosexuals. But 78 percent said they would ``feel
free to report harassment of perceived homosexuals.''
</P>
<P>
   Earlier, in telling reporters about the new panel he had
created, Cohen said, ``The incidents and use of abusive language
(against suspected gay and lesbian troops) are more widespread than
I anticipated. I was surprised at the numbers of people who said
they saw some evidence of harassment.''
</P>
<P>
   Michelle Benecke, co-executive director of the Servicemembers
Legal Defense Network, said of the report's findings, ``We have
told the Pentagon for six years that harassment and abuse are a
serious problem. I'm glad the Pentagon has finally acknowledged it.
But the key to stopping harassment is leadership and
accountability. We hope this oversight committee is not a
substitute.'' Cohen said a major responsibility of the oversight
panel will be to ensure that all military personnel, from troops to
commanders, are versed in new Pentagon anti-harassment guidelines
issued last month. The guidelines are aimed at making sure the
administration policy on gays in the military is followed. The
policy allows homosexuals to serve as long as they keep quiet about
their sexual orientation and don't engage in homosexual acts.
</P>
<P>
   The policy also is designed to ensure that troops who are
harassed can complain to their commanders without fear of setting
in motion an investigation into their sexuality.
</P>
<P>
   Cohen ordered the survey of the bases in the wake of the murder
last July of an Army recruit at Ft. Campbell, Ky., who was
suspected of being gay.
</P>
<P>
   In December, Army Pvt. Calvin Glover, 19, was sentenced to life
in prison for murdering the recruit, Pvt. Barry Winchell, 21, with
a baseball bat. During Glover's trial, soldiers testified that
Winchell was regularly taunted with anti-gay slurs and that
superiors did not intervene when he complained.

`CHOLO' ALEJANDRO TOLEDO: PERU'S FAIRY-TALE CANDIDATE  
 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Timely for April 9 election, Peru)   From the Economist magazine  
 c.2000 Economist Newspaper Ltd.  
 (Distributed by the New York Times Special Features)  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LIMA _ Political fairy tales are not unknown in Peru. In 1990, a
university rector called Alberto Fujimori rose from nowhere in the
final weeks of a presidential election campaign to trounce Mario
Vargas Llosa, a world-famous novelist.
</P>
<P>
   Now Fujimori is seeking a third term in an election on April 9.
He has seemed assured of easy victory. Yet suddenly he has a
serious challenger.
</P>
<P>
   Recent polls show a leap in support for Alejandro Toledo, a
centrist economist. An opinion poll by one firm, Datum, gives
Toledo 25.2 percent, up from 14 percent in February.
</P>
<P>
   Another outfit, Apoyo, has support for Toledo at 22 percent in
Lima (home to a third of the electorate), up from 7 percent in
January.
</P>
<P>
   Toledo has gained at the expense of other opposition candidates
rather than the president, who is, according to both polls, out in
front, with around 40 percent. But Toledo's rise could yet rob
Fujimori of outright victory, thus forcing a runoff in June whose
outcome would be uncertain.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike Fujimori in 1990, Toledo is hardly an outsider. He has
been a well-known political figure for two decades. But he has
never held high office.
</P>
<P>
   And his life story is itself something of a fairy tale. Born in
an Andean Indian farming community, he was one of 16 children, of
whom seven died. When the family moved to the coast, he began work,
aged seven, as a shoeshine boy.
</P>
<P>
   He looks and is a cholo, as Peruvians call an urbanite of Indian
descent.
</P>
<P>
   After winning a scholarship to a secondary school, however,
Toledo studied at Stanford University, in California. There he met,
and later married, Eliane Karp, a Belgian anthropologist (now a
banker), who speaks Quechua, Peru's main indigenous language and
has been campaigning with her husband.
</P>
<P>
   Although most Peruvians have not enjoyed anything like Toledo's
success, millions can identify with it. ``He's the cholo who got
himself a princess,'' says Manuel Torrado, of Datum.
</P>
<P>
   Toledo, who has worked for the World Bank, professes support for
Fujimori's broadly liberal economics, but with populist touches. He
promises wage rises, cheap housing and jobs. And he is not above
playing on racial prejudices.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's our turn now,'' he tells campaign rallies. ``The cholo to
the presidential chair, the chino to Japan,'' his supporters chant
back, referring to Fujimori's Japanese ancestry.
</P>
<P>
   If Fujimori is still ahead in his bid for a (constitutionally
dubious) third term, it is only in part because in the early 1990s
he beat inflation and terrorist violence, and has built schools,
clinics and roads. It is also, say several groups of foreign
observers, because the campaign has been less than fair.
</P>
<P>
   Fujimori's autocratic regime has decisive influence over what is
broadcast by all free television stations. This year, for the first
time, they have refused to accept paid advertising by opposition
candidates.
</P>
<P>
   Fujimori's opponents are the target of media smear campaigns,
widely believed to be orchestrated by Vladimiro Montesinos, the
president's shadowy intelligence chief.
</P>
<P>
   Toledo, for example, has been linked to a pyramid savings
scandal, and is alleged to have abandoned an illegitimate daughter.
He denies both of these stories.
</P>
<P>
   There are other reasons to worry about the hygiene of the
election. Two congressional candidates for one of the parties
backing Fujimori resigned this month, after they had been found to
have been involved in an elaborate scheme to forge more than a
million signatures to register their party for the election.
</P>
<P>
   The electoral board has annulled the party's recognition. The
board has also suspended the official in charge of the election in
Arequipa, Peru's second city.
</P>
<P>
   Witnesses had identified him as the man in charge of ``quality
control'' in the forgery scheme. This official's involvement in the
scandal ``casts a shadow of doubt over the body responsible for
receiving all votes,'' says Eduardo Stein, who is watching the
election for the Organization of American States.
</P>
<P>
   Stein wants the government to guarantee a fair election. But so
far, the main response has been an effort to muzzle El Comercio,
Peru's most respected newspaper, which broke the forgery story.
</P>
<P>
   Its editor accused the regime of trying to induce a shareholder
coup against him. A deplorable mistake by ``yes men,'' said
Fujimori.
</P>
<P>
   Peru's electorate is notoriously unpredictable, and especially
so since the country's traditional political parties have
shrivelled to almost nothing. In this election, unlike the past
two, Fujimori inspires little enthusiasm among voters, but neither,
until now, has a divided opposition.
</P>
<P>
   Toledo could yet pull off a fairy-tale upset of his own. Even if
he does not, and Fujimori wins a third term, the president's
victory this time will seem hollower than in the past. &QL;

TERABEAM: THE NEXT TELECOMS GIANT?  
 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Seattle)   From the Economist magazine  
 c.2000 Economist Newspaper Ltd.  
 (Distributed by the New York Times Special Features)  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SCOTTSDALE, AZ. _ When it comes to ground-breaking technology
and ingenious new Internet businesses, the ``digerati'' who show up
for Esther Dyson's annual PC Forum are blase to the point of
weariness.
</P>
<P>
   That makes the stir caused last week by Seattle-based TeraBeam
Networks the more remarkable.
</P>
<P>
   Eight firms used the conference to emerge from ``stealth'' mode
to present themselves to the 700 or so venture capitalists, dot.com
chief executives and other technological elites gathered at one of
Scottsdale's sybaritic hotels.
</P>
<P>
   But TeraBeam created most of the buzz. One reason is that the
fledgling company has a genuinely ground-breaking technology.
Another is that, if TeraBeam delivers, it will be the answer to the
digerati's prayers.
</P>
<P>
   The firm offers an inexpensive and eminently practical way of
uncorking the bottleneck of the ``last mile,'' bringing unheard of
amounts of bandwidth to almost any business that wants it.
</P>
<P>
   As an awe-struck George Gilder, prophet of the ``telecosm,''
recently proclaimed: ``TeraBeam commands at once the most
disruptive and most redemptive technology in all communications. I
have been looking for such a company for a decade.''
</P>
<P>
   TeraBeam's founder, a serial inventor and one-time photographer
named Greg Amadon, set out to solve a problem that has for years
taxed the brightest minds in the best laboratories of some of the
biggest and richest firms in the world.
</P>
<P>
   Yet, despite huge investments by companies such as Level 3,
Williams and Qwest in building ultra-high-capacity fiber networks,
nobody had worked out how to escape what Gilder memorably calls the
``copper cages of kilohertz telephony.''
</P>
<P>
   Both local networks connecting today's desktop PCs and the
Internet's new long-haul fiber networks carry data at blistering
speeds. But establishing a fast connection between them has meant
incurring the huge cost of running fiber-optic cable all the way to
the front door.
</P>
<P>
   According to Amadon, TeraBeam has got around this by taking
point-to-point laser-communications technology, which has been
around for at least a decade, and ``inventing the five or six
things needed to (create) a point-to-multipoint network.''
</P>
<P>
   This embraces such things as advanced holography and telescopic
technology, and miniature photodetectors that can be coupled to
fiber-optic cores a few millionths of a meter wide.
</P>
<P>
   Amadon and his fellow engineers started work in 1997, and have
for the past 18 months run a prototype system in Seattle. Last
autumn TeraBeam provided the connectivity for the Internet 2
conference, including instantaneous television-quality
video-conferencing. It did the same for PC Forum, despite the huge
distance to Seattle.
</P>
<P>
   The heart of TeraBeam's technology is a transmitter/receiver
that is about the size of a small satellite dish and can be made
for $150. Mounted near the window inside an ordinary office, it
sends and receives data, as light, at speeds of up to two gigabits
a second.
</P>
<P>
   TeraBeam does not require bulky outdoor aerials or long
drawn-out negotiations with building owners to gain rooftop access,
unlike similar microwave technologies.
</P>
<P>
   And because it doesn't operate in the radio spectrum auctioned
by the Federal Communications Commission, it can operate without
licenses.
</P>
<P>
   Amadon also claims that TeraBeam's optical-transmission gear
passes all legislated safety tests: no danger of lasers frying the
eyes of the unwary. The result is quick and cheap deployment.
</P>
<P>
   The firm reckons that after initial studies to determine the
best places to put its points of presence _ i.e., its access hubs _
a network can be rolled out in a medium-sized city in a matter of
months. TeraBeam says it is like casting a high-speed Web over an
entire metropolitan area.
</P>
<P>
   Before June, the company promises to publish a timetable for
introducing the service, city by city. At the same time, it will
also publish its pricing, which, it boasts, will be competitive.
</P>
<P>
   Not satisfied simply with selling its technology, TeraBeam is
intent upon becoming a service provider that buys fiber capacity
wholesale and then makes connections to the customer.
</P>
<P>
   To that end, Amadon last week surrendered his title of chief
executive to Dan Hesse, the president of AT&AMP;T's mobile-phone
business.
</P>
<P>
   By joining TeraBeam now, Hesse is turning his back on options
that could be worth as much as $50 million when AT&AMP;T's wireless
``tracker'' shares are floated next month.
</P>
<P>
   Hesse, who is already negotiating partnerships to allow TeraBeam
to begin commercial service by the end of the year, looks like a
man who cannot quite believe what he has done, but is happy to be
carried along on the wave of excitement.
</P>
<P>
   For Hesse to achieve his ambitions, TeraBeam will have to raise
a lot of money. At present backed by Japan's SoftBank and Oakhill
Ventures of California, it recently raised an undisclosed sum,
probably from industry.
</P>
<P>
   Hesse says he will do all he can to stop TeraBeam being taken
over. He says he wants to build a big, long-term business.
</P>
<P>
   What could go wrong? Until its system has been deployed on a
city-wide basis, TeraBeam will not have properly tested its claim
that the technology is scalable _ i.e., that it can serve many
customers without its costs rising in proportion.
</P>
<P>
   Some skeptics wonder whether fog or rain will interfere with the
fiberless optics (Amadon retorts that it works just fine in
Seattle).
</P>
<P>
   Others ask whether customers will find the applications to
exploit the bandwidth on offer. To which the proper response is:
when have they ever not?
</P>
<P>
   The real question is whether, by becoming a service provider,
TeraBeam is biting off more than it can chew. That, at least, is
what the Baby Bells must be praying. &QL;

OPEC APPEARS IN CONTROL OF OIL MARKETS. APPEARANCES DECEIVE  
 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (TIMELY for March 27 OPEC meeting, Vienna)   (NOTE: 2 trims, totaling 325 words; 1,225 uncut)  
  
 From the Economist magazine  
 c.2000 Economist Newspaper Ltd.  
 (Distributed by the New York Times Special Features)  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Oil has become a volatile substance. The world is producing
about 75 million barrels a day (b/d) of the stuff; it is consuming
about 77m b/d.
</P>
<P>
   Sustained over a year, such a slim difference, less than the
consumption of South Korea, has trebled oil prices, to around $30 a
barrel.
</P>
<P>
   Nobody likes it that way. Producers and consumers alike speak of
their desire for stable oil prices. Yet only in times of war or
revolution has the price been wilder. Which is one reason why, as
OPEC gathers for its annual meeting in Vienna on March 27, the
hardest question is what will happen next.
</P>
<P>
   Against all expectations, OPEC holds most of the cards.
</P>
<P>
   Low oil prices nearly bankrupted many producers two years ago,
as the revenues of the producers' cartel plunged by more than $50
billion in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   Then, with the collusion of Mexico and Norway, neither of them
members of OPEC, Saudi Arabia arranged a concerted round of
production cuts. These are up for review in Vienna.
</P>
<P>
   Although there is every sign that the producers will agree to
some rise in output, only last-minute wrangling will decide exactly
how much extra oil is produced and when. And much hangs on those
devilish details.
</P>
<P>
   The uncertainty arises not just because the cartel is secretive,
and its members are unruly. The real wild card is inscrutable Saudi
Arabia, which, with 2 million-3 million b/d of spare capacity, half
of the OPEC total, dominates the cartel.
</P>
<P>
   Though it might seem that the current bonanza should have made
life easy for the world's biggest oil producer, stratospheric oil
prices have actually put the Saudis in an uncomfortable position.
They are caught between forces tugging in opposite directions.
</P>
<P>
   From outside the cartel, consumers are clamoring for lower
prices. Within it, members want high prices.
</P>
<P>
   The pressure from consuming countries to raise output, so as to
bring prices down quickly, is strong. The shortfall has greatly
depleted global oil stocks.
</P>
<P>
   The International Energy Agency (IEA), a quasi-governmental body
representing consuming economies, reckons that OPEC must increase
production by 2.3 million b/d if oil stocks are to return to the
average level of 1990-96. If not, say analysts, prices could go
even higher.
</P>
<P>
   The reason for alarm is that high oil prices inflict pain on
consuming economies in so many nasty ways, ranging from higher
inflation to deteriorating terms of trade and a decline in
international competitiveness.
</P>
<P>
   The United States, which is the world's biggest oil importer, is
screaming bloody murder.
</P>
<P>
   Economists are worried that inflation, which is so far rising
only because of the oil price, might next develop its own momentum.
This means more interest-rate increases after this week's, perhaps
tipping the economy into eventual recession.
</P>
<P>
   America's trade deficit soared to a record $28 billion in
January _ $8 billion of which was spent importing oil, nearly
double the figure of a year ago.
</P>
<P>
   Consumers are outraged at higher prices for gasoline, and
American politicians are rising to the occasion. American antitrust
officials are looking at whether the OPEC cartel has violated
domestic competition laws.
</P>
<P>
   Bill Richardson, America's energy secretary, has been shuttling
between OPEC capitals trying to persuade producers into agreeing
``a sizeable increase in production as soon as possible _ in the
second quarter, in April.'' In other words, now.
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, the Saudis are facing strong internal
pressure from a number of OPEC countries, such as Libya, Algeria
and Iran, that want little or no change in production.
</P>
<P>
   Some are hawks who see nothing wrong with oil at $30 a barrel,
the consumer be damned. Others are already producing close to the
limits of their capacity, and so see little benefit in raising
quotas.
</P>
<P>
   And don't forget what insiders like to call ``the ghost of
Jakarta.''
</P>
<P>
   The cartel's most recent decision to raise output was taken, at
Saudi urging, at a meeting in Indonesia on the eve of the Asian
financial crisis. The subsequent collapse in prices is still fresh
in the minds of most OPEC members.
</P>
<P>
   The big international oil firms remember $10 oil too. Judging by
past behavior, months of $25-30 oil prices should have boosted
their spending on exploration and production; not this time though.
</P>
<P>
   Mark Moody-Stuart, the boss of Royal Dutch/Shell, accepts that
``it doesn't take a brave man to predict oil prices above $20 for
2000,'' but he still wants only investments such that ``they fly at
$14 a barrel, and we can sleep easy in our beds at $10.''
</P>
<P>
   Some argue that world demand for oil is anyway likely to drop
sharply in the second quarter of this year. &QL; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (FIRST OPTIONAL TRIM _ 100 WORDS _ BEGINS HERE AT 800) &LR;  &QC; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Shokri Ghanem of OPEC's secretariat points to average figures
over the 1990s suggesting that, as the northern hemisphere's winter
ends, global oil demand declines by about 2.7 million b/d.
</P>
<P>
   So, he argues, raising output by, say, today's 2 million b/d
shortfall would flood the market with too much oil. Prices would
once again collapse.
</P>
<P>
   Most market-watchers strongly disagree. Pointing to the sharp
rebound in Asia and to suppressed first-quarter demand, the IEA
reckons that this year's second-quarter decline will be only 1.5
million b/d. &QL; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (END OF FIRST OPTIONAL TRIM) &LR;  &QC; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The Center for Global Energy Studies, a consultancy, thinks that
fears of a seasonal downturn are ``entirely misplaced.'' It
observes that American firms did not build oil stocks sufficiently
during the winter. To meet the demands of the spring and summer,
they must now do so at breakneck pace.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, even a big OPEC output rise may not prevent sporadic
shortages and price shocks at American gas stations this summer,
since it takes five or six weeks for oil to travel from the Persian
Gulf to America's East Coast.
</P>
<P>
   The American government's Energy Information Agency is already
warning that oil prices may spike ``to unprecedented levels.'' &QL; 
 &LR;  &QL; 
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
    &UR; (STORY CAN END HERE AT 1,000, OR CONTINUE TO 1,225) &LR;  &QC; 
</ANNOTATION>
 &LR;  &QL;
<P>
   In short, the Saudis face an unenviable choice. They know from
painful experience that OPEC is fragile and ill-disciplined, and
that they must not ``betray'' their brethren in the cartel by
simply yielding to consumers.
</P>
<P>
   Yet they also know that they must not test America's patience
too far.
</P>
<P>
   Saudi Arabia may have the oil, but America has two other weapons
that the Saudis cannot ignore: military and economic might. Even
oil producers need the American economy to thrive.
</P>
<P>
   Given these diametrically opposed forces, what will Saudi Arabia
do? The opaque murmurs from Riyadh suggest that the kingdom wants
to see a more stable oil market. Some sort of compromise production
increase, of 1 million-1.5 million b/d, seems the most likely
outcome.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever is decided in Vienna, Euan Baird, head of Schlumberger,
a giant oil-services firm with eyes and ears everywhere, believes
that ultimately ``Saudi Arabia wants $25 oil, and it will get it...
but it will take them a few iterations and overshoots to get
there.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet the past 18 months offer a different lesson. Decreeing
stability is a mug's game. OPEC's attempts to adjust the price by
nudging output resulted in oil veering down to $10 and back up to
$30.
</P>
<P>
   Americans had better prepare for a long, hot summer. &QL;

GREENSPAN'S DRIP-TORTURE STRATEGY IS DANGEROUS  
 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Commentary Editors)   From the Economist magazine  
 c.2000 Economist Newspaper Ltd.  
 (Distributed by the New York Times Special Features)  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Pour boiling water on a frog and it will jump away; heat it up
slowly in a pot of cold water, and it will die.
</P>
<P>
   America's Federal Reserve, which raised short-term interest
rates by another quarter-point to 6 percent on March 21, may need
reminding of this tale.
</P>
<P>
   The Fed's strategy of slowing an overheating economy by raising
rates gradually might prove just as risky for America _ and so for
the world economy.
</P>
<P>
   Since last summer, the Fed has raised interest rates five times,
on each occasion by modest quarter-points that were well-flagged in
advance. The goal, as Alan Greenspan, the Fed's chairman, has made
abundantly clear, is to slow America's surging demand.
</P>
<P>
   But so far the rate rises seem to have done nothing of the sort.
The economy even sped up in the second half of 1999, growing by a
dizzy 6.3 percent at an annual rate.
</P>
<P>
   And there are few signs of a serious slowdown this year:
February's buoyant retail sales figures suggest that consumer
spending may even have been accelerating. Only in housing, if one
looks hard, are there some slight signs of any economic slowdown.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, the ``imbalances'' that Greenspan is so fond of
citing are flashing red ever more furiously.
</P>
<P>
   The monthly trade deficit hit a new record of $28 billion in
January; the current-account deficit is over 4 percent of GDP and
rising. The labor market is growing ever tighter: the jobless rate
is now at 4.1 percent and unemployment claims have hit a 26-year
low.
</P>
<P>
   Gradualism has, it seems, had little impact.
</P>
<P>
   At one level, that is not so surprising. It takes over a year
for higher interest rates to have their full effect on an economy.
</P>
<P>
   The oddity, however, is how little impact higher rates (with the
certain prospect of more to come) have had on the financial
markets, which would normally be expected to anticipate any
economic slowdown.
</P>
<P>
   Yields on long-term government debt have been falling recently;
and equity markets, despite recent volatility, are still at
extremely high valuations.
</P>
<P>
   The Wilshire 5000, the broadest measure of American shares, is
up by 4 percent this year. Although corporate borrowing costs have
risen a bit, overall financial conditions have tightened little
after the Fed's rate increases.
</P>
<P>
   Since the rampant stock market is, through its wealth effect,
now a big contributor to booming consumer spending, it is hard to
see demand slowing until borrowing costs rise by rather more.
</P>
<P>
   Is inflation really a problem? Although headline inflation has
doubled over the past year, to 3.2 percent, much of the rise has
been due to the trebling in oil prices since early 1999.
</P>
<P>
   Now, oil prices have started falling in advance of the March 27
OPEC meeting, where producers are likely to agree on higher output.
Yet even if oil slides from $30 a barrel to $20-25, the price would
still have more than doubled in little more than a year, and that
would feed through into higher input costs.
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, America's labor scarcity has not yet
translated into wage pressure, at least in formal measures of
compensation. Such pay rises as there have been are being eclipsed
by rising productivity: unit labor costs actually fell in the
second half of 1999.
</P>
<P>
   The trouble, as always for central banks, is that by the time
solid evidence of inflation appears, it will be too late. That is
why with tight labor, rising energy costs and abundant money, it
would be better to pour on more boiling water.
</P>
<P>
   After all, the frog would then react, and survive. Interest
rates can always be lowered again later. &QL;

BORIS BEREZOVSKY: KREMLIN PUPPETEER OR FUTURE PUTIN VICTIM?  
 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (TIMELY for Sunday's election, Russia)   (NOTE: Story can stand in 650 words; 1,000 uncut)  
  
 From the Economist magazine  
 c.2000 Economist Newspaper Ltd.  
 (Distributed by the New York Times Special Features)  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Will Boris Berezovsky, Russia's oligarch-extraordinaire, see out
the year in jail, exile or the comfortable nook between business
and government that he currently occupies?
</P>
<P>
   The answer will give a clear sign of where the country is headed
under Vladimir Putin, who is set to be elected president on March
26.
</P>
<P>
   Berezovsky embodies the distinctive characteristic of the ruling
elite in post-Soviet Russia: cynical ruthlessness. By his own
account, two guiding principles for dealings with other people are
that ``anyone can be bought, and everyone has his price.''
</P>
<P>
   Sitting in a sumptuously restored czarist mansion that his
car-dealing company Logovaz runs as a business club, he quickly
adds a caveat: ``It is impossible to buy feelings. All the rest it
is possible to buy.''
</P>
<P>
   He can be both charming, almost hypnotically so, and terrifying.
George Soros, an American financier and former friend, wrote
recently that, after they fell out, ``his anger gave me the chills.
I literally felt he could kill me.''
</P>
<P>
   Berezovsky responds with a blizzard of insults against Soros. He
is a ``hypocrite'' for mixing business with philanthropy,
``dirty,'' ``a liar'' _ and, to cap it all, he has ``bad taste.''
``He says this building is a typical mafia house,'' snorts the
Russian indignantly. ``But we won a prize for the renovation!''
</P>
<P>
   Berezovsky made his fortune by understanding how the Soviet,
then Russian, economy was changing.
</P>
<P>
   A mathematician, he started by selling software; an early coup,
he says, was persuading a Soviet committee to tell 30,000 state
institutions to buy his programs. Then he bought cars at the cheap
official price and sold them at the free-market one.
</P>
<P>
   Next came media holdings: he snapped up a large chunk of
Russia's biggest television station. Then there was oil, in
particular Sibneft, a large company now striving for
respectability, whose spokesmen get tongue-tied when asked about
Berezovsky's exact role in it.
</P>
<P>
   Recently his holding companies have been ``consolidating'' (a
favorite word of his) the aluminium industry.
</P>
<P>
   And the future? ``The Internet.''
</P>
<P>
   Not that he has much time for business. In his version of
events, he has barely spared a minute for it since 1996.
</P>
<P>
   His main official post was running the Commonwealth of
Independent States, a zombie-like shadow of the Soviet Union. He is
now a deputy in the Duma, the lower house of parliament, for the
impoverished southern republic of Karachaevo-Cherkessia.
</P>
<P>
   For all this, Berezovsky is distrusted, even detested, by many
Russians. He is their prototype oligarch: an overly-mighty tycoon
who feeds on his connections, most notably to former President
Boris Yeltsin's inner circle.
</P>
<P>
   In the past he has boasted of his ability to swing Kremlin
decisions, and has spoken of the ``privatization of cash flow'' as
a natural stage in unscrambling the Soviet economy. Others are less
polite.
</P>
<P>
   Though Berezovsky has not been charged with any wrongdoing, he
was recently denied a visa to Switzerland, where he usually attends
the annual talkfest at Davos; Swiss prosecutors are investigating
the role of two of his Geneva-based companies in handling the
overseas revenues of Aeroflot, Russia's national airline.
</P>
<P>
   Berezovsky alleges corrupt ties between Swiss officials and his
political enemies in Moscow.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe Berezovsky's number is up. Putin's austere, disciplined
style is a world away from the indulgent, ostentatious cronyism of
the Yeltsin era.
</P>
<P>
   Though he praises Putin publicly, the president-in-waiting has
been noticeably cooler in return. He said pointedly this week that
he wanted the oligarchs cut down to size.
</P>
<P>
   He has specifically criticized some of Berezovsky's dealings in
a way that would have seemed inconceivable in past years, when the
tycoon seemed to have a base at the heart of the Kremlin.
</P>
<P>
   ``Beware of Greeks bearing gifts,'' was Putin's frosty reaction
when Berezovsky endorsed him for president. &QL; 
 &LR;  &QL; 
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
    &UR; (STORY CAN END HERE AT 650, OR CONTINUE TO 1,000) &LR;  &QC; 
</ANNOTATION>
 &LR;  &QL;
<P>
   Yet Berezovsky's Trojan horse seems still securely stabled in
the Kremlin. Most of his close friends from the Yeltsin era, such
as the past and present chief of staff, Alexander Voloshin, and the
consummate Kremlin insider, Valentin Yumashev, who played a leading
part in promoting Putin in the West, seem as powerful as before.
</P>
<P>
   The same story is broadly true in the government, though
Berezovsky himself denies the close ties widely assumed to link him
to such top figures as Mikhail Kasyanov, now tipped to be promoted
from finance minister to prime minister.
</P>
<P>
   So Berezovsky is certainly not on the skids _ yet. In any event,
Putin would be wise to keep him reasonably sweet, at least until
after the election. Berezovsky, after all, has a stellar
campaigning record.
</P>
<P>
   He brought Yeltsin back from a political abyss in 1996, and
conjured up a successful pro-Kremlin alliance of regional governors
in last year's parliamentary elections.
</P>
<P>
   Coupled with awesome television firepower, this grouping
destroyed Fatherland, a regional alliance led by Yuri Luzhkov, the
mayor of Moscow, and Yevgeny Primakov, another former intelligence
boss turned prime minister, who briefly threatened the Kremlin
clan's hegemony.
</P>
<P>
   So even if Putin loathes Berezovsky, as some say he does, and
regards his influence as pernicious, there would be no point in
turning on him and his chums until after the election. Things could
be very different then.
</P>
<P>
   When he was running the FSB (a successor to the KGB), one of
Putin's main tasks, which he balked at, was to grapple with
Berezovsky's hold on it.
</P>
<P>
   Berezovsky enjoys parliamentary immunity, but political
pressure, if it were strong enough, could have it lifted. Nobody as
powerful as Berezovsky has ever faced criminal charges in Russia.
</P>
<P>
   Yet Berezovsky himself seems sanguine. Putin's ascendancy, he
argues, represents a highly desirable ``consolidation of power.''
Yeltsin broke the communist system; now it is time to build another
type, first at government level, then among an energetic new elite.
</P>
<P>
   Eventually, a new society will emerge. Russia will then become
liberal and democratic, says Berezovsky, but in the meantime, ``We
sometimes need a lot of power.'' In safe hands, of course.
Preferably his. &QL;

LICENSE TO KILL: CHARGES KEEP ON TRUCKIN' AGAINST GOV. RYAN  
 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Chicago, Illinois Editors)   From the Economist magazine  
 c.2000 Economist Newspaper Ltd.  
 (Distributed by the New York Times Special Features)  
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHICAGO _ Like most good political thrillers, it seemed at first
to be just another tale of bureaucratic graft.
</P>
<P>
   In 1998, the Department of Justice began an investigation into
an obscure part of the Illinois secretary of state's office that
doles out commercial drivers' licenses. Operation Safe Road duly
found that employees routinely sold licenses to unqualified truck
drivers.
</P>
<P>
   But three things have since made the story much more explosive.
First, the then-secretary of state, George Ryan, is now the state's
governor; second, a chunk of the money found its way into his
gubernatorial campaign fund; and, third, one of the illegally
licensed drivers was involved in a fiery wreck that killed six
Chicago children.
</P>
<P>
   Thirty people have been charged in the scandal; this week two
more pleaded guilty, taking the total to 24.
</P>
<P>
   In January, federal officials charged Dean Bauer, an old friend
of Ryan and the man he appointed to root out corruption in the
secretary of state's office, with racketeering, mail fraud,
obstruction of justice and making false statements.
</P>
<P>
   Among other things, Bauer is accused of stopping an internal
investigation into whether the truck driver who killed the six
Chicago children had obtained his license improperly.
</P>
<P>
   The Justice Department says it has evidence linking the
licensing scandal to other fatal accidents.
</P>
<P>
   The Chicago Tribune has reported that a truck driver who paid
$800 for a fraudulent Illinois license caused a 74-vehicle pileup
in California in 1998 that killed two people and injured 51.
</P>
<P>
   And the mother of a former employee at a state licensing
facility says she gave a three-page letter describing the
corruption to Ryan's wife at a charity event in 1998. Mrs. Ryan
says she does not recall receiving the letter.
</P>
<P>
   Ryan, a Republican now in the second year of his four-year term
as governor, says he was aware that some allegations of impropriety
were being investigated in his former office, but he had no idea
that $170,000 of the bribe money was used to buy tickets to his
fund-raising meetings. That was the work of renegade employees.
</P>
<P>
   Neither the Justice Department nor Ryan will say whether he is a
target of investigation, or has been questioned by federal agents.
</P>
<P>
   Weirdly, the Democrats have held their fire. Ryan is an affable
fellow with a history of cutting cross-party deals. But his
opponents also seem keen to avoid the mistakes the Republicans in
Washington made over President Bill Clinton's affair with Monica
Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   ``If your opponent is twisting in the wind,'' says Rich Miller,
a local political analyst, ``you just let him hang there.''
</P>
<P>
   The Republicans have been slow to come to the governor's rescue.
Few of Ryan's best-known accomplishments _ a $12 billion
infrastructure program (paid for by a tax increase), a moratorium
on the death penalty, tougher penalties for gun crimes, and a
ground-breaking trip to Cuba _ have endeared him to the right wing
of his party.
</P>
<P>
   Nor has the governor produced a tax cut, despite a large state
surplus.
</P>
<P>
   All of which should worry another governor called George. Ryan
is the state chairman for the presidential campaign of George W.
Bush.
</P>
<P>
   In this week's Illinois primary a third of the Republican vote
went to other candidates, notably John McCain (even though he has
withdrawn).
</P>
<P>
   The polls show that 47 percent of Illinois voters have an
unfavorable opinion of Ryan, and fewer than a fifth believe he did
not know about the license peddling.
</P>
<P>
   It is unlikely that Ryan will be elected to a second term. The
more interesting question is whether he will finish his first. &QL;

SURPRISINGLY, `AUDREY HEPBURN STORY' HAS CLASS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By JOHN LEVESQUE  
 c.2000 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Especially on the day after the Oscars, it's almost impossible
to visualize the finespun Audrey Hepburn while gazing upon the
robust Jennifer Love Hewitt. Camera tricks and acres of fabric can
only do so much. Moreover, Hewitt's spirited attempt to capture
Hepburn's accent, a challenging mix of English, Dutch and Belgian,
is a persistent obstacle to thoroughly enjoying ``The Audrey
Hepburn Story,'' which airs Monday on ABC.
</P>
<P>
   And yet ...
</P>
<P>
   And yet ...
</P>
<P>
   It's not so bad. Good enough, certainly, to carry three hours in
prime time, and so much more polished than standard TV-movie fare
that Hewitt, who turned 21 last month, might have a future as a
producer.
</P>
<P>
   As a performer, the telegenic teen who rode a supporting role in
``Party of Five'' to pop-culture stardom and her own Fox series,
``Time of Your Life,'' will never possess Hepburn's alluring je ne
sais quoi. Call it luminescence or sparkle, glimmer or glamour.
It's not there. When Hepburn opened those enormous eyes and arched
her impossibly long neck, it was screen magic. Men forgot about the
overstuffed and underupholstered Jane Russells of the day, at least
temporarily, and women enviously copied the Hepburn style: the
short hair, the fabulous posture, the casual elegance.
</P>
<P>
   Hewitt, who is squinty-eyed by nature, bears a slight facial
resemblance to the late movie star, but her loving portrayal,
perhaps invevitably, smacks of the ``historical re-enactment''
footage we see so often on televised biography specials.
</P>
<P>
   Still, ``The Audrey Hepburn Story'' is a classy production.
Bouquets go to Marsha Norman's script, which gives the viewer
credit for being smarter than a potato (couch or otherwise), and to
Steven Robman's direction, which moves artfully, even playfully,
back and forth among significant moments in Hepburn's fascinating
life.
</P>
<P>
   Norman, who won a Pulitzer Prize for her play ``'Night,
Mother,'' wisely keeps Hewitt's Hepburn from having to deliver
soliloquies. Robman, a veteran of dozens of dramatic series, knows
how to set the hook to keep viewers coming back after the
commercials. (In a three-hour block of prime time, that's about 45
minutes worth of commercial time.)
</P>
<P>
   Hepburn, a paragon of '50s style and grace, is Hewitt's idol _
``the one woman that I think was everything a woman should be,''
she has gushed. As co-executive producer of this affectionate
portrait, Hewitt helped shape more than her own performance.
</P>
<P>
   She says her first exposure to Hepburn was as a young girl, when
she watched a tape of ``Breakfast at Tiffany's'' with her mother.
No surprise, then, to see Robman use a recreation of the 1961 film
_ and its Oscar-winning theme song, ``Moon River'' _ as framework
for this tale of a gifted, complex woman who initially didn't grasp
the enormous impact she had on people. Not unlike Holly Golightly
in Truman Capote's story, if you'd like.
</P>
<P>
   Hewitt gamely tries to capture the enigmatic essence of Hepburn,
an indescribable quality movie buffs have loved for 50 years (as
evidenced by the many Web shrines still fawning over the woman, who
died of colon cancer in 1993.) Hewitt is more successful when
deferring to a distinguished supporting cast, which delivers enough
of a backup boost to save the film from being just another cheesy
prime-time romp.
</P>
<P>
   Frances Fisher plays Hepburn's long-suffering mother, a Dutch
baroness treated poorly by circumstance and spouse. She is the
embodiment of noble, if sometimes misguided, maternal devotion
during difficult times in the 1930s and '40s and the seemingly
charmed times afterward.
</P>
<P>
   Keir Dullea, as the reluctant father who abandons his family on
the eve of World War II, also hits a very precise target with
minimal screen time.
</P>
<P>
   Despite her father's apparent rejection of all parental
obligation, Hepburn's desire to know him, a Nazi sympathizer
interned in England during the war, provides sufficient dramatic
underpinning to make ``The Audrey Hepburn Story'' more substantial
than, say, a box of Junior Mints. It's a good device, though a
better choice might have been to extend the story past 1961, the
year ``Breakfast at Tiffany's'' was released. Hepburn went into
semi-retirement after that to raise a family and devote time to
humanitarian causes, but the film only deals with these milestones
in a postscript. The effect, intentional or not, is to celebrate
the superficial while diminishing the significant.
</P>
<P>
   But for what it is, Hewitt can take some satisfaction in knowing
that ``The Audrey Hepburn Story'' isn't an embarrassment. That,
more than anything, may be the highest praise because Hepburn, at
least according to this portrayal, always seemed most concerned not
with her own stardom but with not causing her family, friends and
loved ones undue distress.
</P>
<P>
   The Audrey Hepburn Story. Three-hour TV movie about the
Oscar-winning actress. Starring Jennifer Love Hewitt, Frances
Fisher, Eric McCormack, Keir Dullea, Peter Giles, Sarah Hyland and
Emmy Rossum. Monday night on ABC. Parental guideline rating: TV-PG.

COLLUSION AMONG BREWERIES? EUROPEAN REGULATORS LAUNCH
INVESTIGATION 
</HEADLINE>
  (lh) 
 By JOHN TAGLIABUE   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   PARIS _ In France they like their Kronenbourg, in Italy their
Peroni and in Holland Heineken.
</P>
<P>
   Europeans are clearly hooked on regional beer brands, but
European antitrust regulators want to know whether this is a result
of beer drinking traditions or of subtle cartel arrangements among
breweries.
</P>
<P>
   So this week, European investigators made surprise visits to
some of the Continent's major breweries, arriving unannounced to
examine documents in the Netherlands at the Dutch brewers Grolsch
and Bavaria and at Heineken's offices and in Italy, at the Italian
offices of Carlsberg SA of Denmark, and at the Italian brewer
Peroni SpA.
</P>
<P>
   An investigation into whether the breweries are abusing their
dominant national positions was begun last July when the chief
antitrust regulator at the time, Karel Van Miert, himself a
Belgian, ordered investigators to seize documents at Interbrew, the
Belgian brewery that makes the national favorite, Stella Artois.
</P>
<P>
   Mario Monti, who succeeded Van Miert last year, has taken an
aggressive position in his six months on the job toward the effects
that Europe's continued market fragmentation has on competition.
</P>
<P>
   In October, the offices of brewers in Belgium were again
entered, and in January the two market leaders in France, the
Kronenbourg beer division of the big Danone food group and
Heineken's French unit, also received surprise visits from
regulators.
</P>
<P>
   France provides an illustration of the cozy relationships that
make regulators suspicious. Seventy percent of the French beer
market is controlled by two breweries _ Kronenbourg, the market
leader with 40 percent, and Heineken, No. 2 with 30 percent. Many
European countries have beer markets similarly divided between a
local champion and one or more major international brewers, and
regulators want to know whether the companies coordinate their
strategies to abuse their dominant positions.
</P>
<P>
   Industry officials deny this. ``Without any doubt, we are
confident of the successful outcome of the investigation,'' said
Michael Berssenbrugge, the spokesman for Heineken in Amsterdam,
Netherlands.
</P>
<P>
   Beer is not the only beverage European regulators are
scrutinizing over pricing practices. They have also been tough on
Coca-Cola Co. and its European bottlers. Last December Italian
antitrust authorities fined Coca-Cola $16 million after determining
that the company's discounts to selected retailers were unfair. And
in unannounced visits last July similar to those on the beer
companies, European regulators have examined Coca-Cola's pricing
practices in Austria, Denmark and Germany. The company has denied
any wrongdoing.
</P>
<P>
   Industry analysts seemed puzzled by the aggressiveness of the
beer investigation.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a very competitive world,'' said Iain Wilson, a beer
industry analyst for ABN Amro in Amsterdam, noting that while
Heineken controls roughly half the domestic Dutch market, it faces
bitter competition from three smaller breweries.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, modest levels of profitability and an oversupply of
European breweries have helped to accelerate the process of
consolidation. Heineken recently acquired breweries in Poland and
Spain; this week the British brewer, Scottish &AMP; Newcastle PLC,
announced it would pay $2.6 billion to acquire Kronenbourg from
Danone.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, consolidation among European food retailers is
creating giants like Tesco, Britain's No. 1 supermarket chain, and
Carrefour of France, whose proposed merger with another French
retailer, Promodes, would make it the largest retailer in Europe
and the second largest worldwide after Wal-Mart. Increasingly, the
breweries complain, these giants are dictating conditions to
European food and beverage companies.

MESSY `AIDA' LATEST DISNEY POP MUSICAL TO HIT BROADWAY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By JEFFREY ERIC JENKINS  
 c.2000 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ An iron triangle has formed in the Broadway theater.
But it has nothing to do with presidential policy-making or John
McCain's loathed Washington lobbyists.
</P>
<P>
   It is the rough geometric shape formed when you draw a line
between the New Amsterdam, the Lunt-Fontanne and the Palace
theaters in the Broadway district. With the opening of the Elton
John and Tim Rice musical, ``Aida,'' at the Palace last Thursday,
joining ``Beauty and the Beast'' at Lunt-Fontanne and ``The Lion
King'' at the New Amsterdam, the ``wonderful world of Disney'' has
staked its claim to the heart of American commercial theater. (Or,
as some might suggest, driven another stake into its heart.)
</P>
<P>
   Titled ``Elaborate Lives'' in its first incarnation at Atlanta's
Alliance Theatre, the pop musical has been beset with weird
technical problems during development and seemed to have generated
a ``curse of the pharaohs.'' After a failed pyramid effect became
the big story from the Atlanta production, the company fired most
of the creative team.
</P>
<P>
   The directorial reins of the show were handed to Robert Falls,
the artistic wizard behind numerous reclamations of plays by
Tennessee Williams, Arthur Miller and Eugene O'Neill for Chicago's
Goodman Theatre. He had directed plays for Broadway before _ his
production of ``Death of a Salesman'' won four Tony Awards last
year _ but his work with musicals had been limited. Falls also
teamed with Tony Award-winning playwright David Henry Hwang to
polish the book written by Linda Woolverton.
</P>
<P>
   Stunningly reconceived by designer Bob Crowley, the revised
production moved to Chicago for a pre-Broadway run with the new
title of ``Aida.'' At the second preview performance, though, Aida
(Heather Headley) and her lover, Radames (Adam Pascal), tumbled out
of a box-like tomb and fell 10 to 15 feet as the set piece rose
from the stage. The actors suffered only minor injuries and a few
shows were cancelled, but the rising-tomb bit was cut.
</P>
<P>
   Based on Verdi's opera, the current Disney production is the
tale of a Nubian princess who is captured and enslaved by an
Egyptian soldier, Radames. Radames then gives his new slave to
Amneris (Sherie Rene, the Egyptian princess to whom he is
betrothed. Amneris finds the new slave to her liking and becomes
fast friends with her. But Radames also takes a shine to the
willful, adventurous Aida and troubles ensue.
</P>
<P>
   Trying desperately to be many things to many people, ``Aida''
succeeds only marginally. The musical cannot decide if it wants to
be a tragic love story _ it is not _ a wise-cracking cartoon or an
anti-imperialist tract, which is ironic when you consider Disney's
omnivorous corporate appetites.
</P>
<P>
   That is not to say, however, that Aida herself fails to please.
Headley's rich, powerful voice demonstrates that she is up to the
few challenges lurking in Elton John's accessible score. When it
comes to the big musical finish, the composer writes up to her
level and Headley soars beautifully.
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately, the same cannot be said for Pascal, an avowed pop
singer who nonetheless keeps working in musical theater. (He was in
the original production of ``Rent.'') While he admittedly looks
good without his shirt, Pascal's acting is mostly noble attitude.
His singing relies on the raspy, fluttery sound that has helped
Michael Bolton and his ilk to sell millions of records _ but it
grates on ears listening for a sweet sound.
</P>
<P>
   There are pleasures in the score, but they tend to be the joys
of nostalgia. In the song ``Elaborate Lives,'' classic John
percussive riffs _ reminiscent of the ``Yellow Brick Road'' era _
carry along Rice's flaccid top-40 lyrics. Indeed, there are moments
when the lyric rhythms echo another Rice musical, ``Jesus Christ
Superstar'' (cowritten with Andrew Lloyd Webber, it reopens on
Broadway in April).
</P>
<P>
   John writes in a variety of styles, but always with an ear tuned
to the pop charts. In ``My Strongest Suit,'' a 1960s girl-group
celebration, Amneris leads a bizarro-world fashion show complete
with catwalk and glam geometric headgear of pyramids, triangles and
cubes _ all of it designed and sewn by the princess' new best
slave, Aida.
</P>
<P>
   ``Another Pyramid'' features an easy-listening reggae beat that
morphs into a kitschy production number about employing architects
to build a tomb that will house the corpse of a dying pharaoh. In
the ancient economy, royal death is good for the construction
business.
</P>
<P>
   The numbers performed by the enslaved Nubians display African
musical roots. ``The Dance of the Robe'' succeeds on the strength
of its performers immersion in Wayne Cilento's choreography _ which
otherwise fails to inspire. ``The Gods Love Nubia'' is a rousing
spiritual number bound to bring to mind the work of Lebo M, a
collaborator (as were John and Rice) on ``The Lion King.''
</P>
<P>
   It's a pretty safe bet, though, that a musical has serious
problems when you leave the theater humming the set changes.
Designer Crowley _ whose only slips include costuming the pharaoh's
ministers in heavy frock coats and making Pharaoh's headdress looks
like a bottle of champagne chilling in a bucket of ice _ diverts
our attention from otherwise lackluster proceedings.
</P>
<P>
   In one splendid touch, Crowley uses a backdrop that serves as a
location where Nubian women wash clothes. The river is a zigzag
stripe of deep blue with rich red banks on either side and trees
off in the distance. When the forbidden lovers confront and accept
their feelings for one another, the life-altering moment is
reinforced as the drop is dreamily inverted. It is a lovely image
that shows their world turned upside down.
</P>
<P>
   Everywhere you look in ``Aida,'' designer Crowley employs
geometric imagery: cubes, squares, pyramids, triangles. But it
isn't geometry that most concerns Disney, it's math. Can ``Aida''
be buoyed along by Elton John fans in the same way that Frank
Wildhorn's ``Jekyll and Hyde'' bubbles along? Is the third time a
charm for the troubled production?
</P>
<P>
   If Disney gets its way, Broadway's iron triangle will turn to
gold.
</P>
<P>
   Aida. Music by Elton John, lyrics by Tim Rice; book by Linda
Woolverton, Robert Falls and David Henry Hwang. Palace Theatre,
1564 Broadway (at 47th Street), New York City. Opened March 23.

   NEW YORK _ A scene from a reporter's notebook, winter 1993.
There is a storm of biblical proportions and I am on my way to
interview Kitty Carlisle Hart, who clowned with the Marx brothers
and became the chairwoman of the New York State Council on the
Arts. We are to tour the boroughs; Mrs. Hart is off to visit
struggling theater companies and ballerinas in Brooklyn. The
airports have closed, and out my window in the early morning I see
herculean rain. Mrs. Hart is snappish with me on the telephone when
I call, in the hope that she will cancel. ``We never let the
weather slow us down,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   I arrive drenched and wilted, to be greeted by Mrs. Hart in a
lavender Ultrasuede raincoat with matching fur-trimmed boots. Her
raven hair is impeccable, and her ebullience has returned. ``Oh,
you are such a dear to come out on such a day!'' All day long, I
raced to keep up the pace. It was imperative that I not lag behind,
she told me. That night, she had 100 guests coming to her house to
greet Gov. Mario Cuomo. She was then 86 years old, the very image
of a great dame.
</P>
<P>
   Great dames _ flamboyant diva-women, who came of age before
1960s feminism _ are never defeated by their circumstances.
Tenacity, flair and fun are the traits that define them. They were
reared in an era of limited expectations, when graduate schools and
careers were often closed to them. Good manners, manicures, pearls
and high heels were the disguises they wore to hide their mettle.
Auntie Mame is the prototype, with her arch double entendres and
live-live-live philosophy.
</P>
<P>
   When I started interviewing great dames a decade ago, I viewed
them as pieces of history: Clare Boothe Luce, Pamela Harriman,
Constance Baker Motley, who tried Brown vs. Board of Education with
Thurgood Marshall. I wanted to chronicle their struggles and
astonishing survival skills in spite of their having been reared in
a world whose underpinnings were still Victorian.
</P>
<P>
   The first great dame I ever knew was my mother, Thelma Brenner.
For years, I ridiculed her dressing rituals, her need to lay out
her clothes, shoes, jewelry and scarves on the bed hours before she
dressed. I was a noisy rebel, a member of the class of '71 with the
overknowing views of my generation of young feminists. And I wore
that uniform: black turtleneck, torn jeans, long hair. My style
icon was Joan Baez.
</P>
<P>
   ``I like to look put together,'' my mother would tell me when I
compared her preparations to the Normandy invasion. Like the term
``great dame,'' ``put together'' is a phrase with implications.
Loretta Young twirling into our living rooms wearing chiffon and an
actressy smile. Rosalind Russell and Irene Dunne. ``Put together''
was a metaphor for an entire generation that believed in beating
back the demons by whistling in the dark.
</P>
<P>
   The truth was, I loved watching my mother dress. And now I hear
my fellow travelers of '70s feminism wondering if it was really
wise to have worked so hard. Our slob-style is long over; we are
back in suits, comparing notes on designer sales, sounding so much
like my mother and her friends. ``I am afraid our generation's
beatnik values have gone the way of the dodo bird,'' said Judith
Thurman, the biographer of Colette and Isak Dinesen.
</P>
<P>
   My friends and I used to dismiss the great dames as phonies who
needed, in most cases, a powerful man for their ascent. But right
on schedule, about the time I noticed the first lines on my brow, I
no longer viewed the dames as sacred monsters. Where once I saw the
brass and the facade, I began to see the endurance.
</P>
<P>
   It never occurred to me that the great dames could become role
models for women in their 20s and 30s until just the other day,
when there it was: ``Putting it together,'' read the headline in a
fashion magazine. And suddenly, embraced by the downtown club set,
here are Babe Paley buds and Pamela Harriman clones, wearing suits
and pearls.
</P>
<P>
   They're everywhere, these new would-be great dames, born
sometime during the day-glo '60s or the Nixon administration, now
out in force in all-Manolo all the time. As in the '20s, the riffle
in a culture is often first seen in clothes. Inside the Conde Nast
offices editors are assigning variations on the theme of ``the new
formality.'' ``It's time perhaps for Tipper Gore, a nice family
girl who wears St. John Knits,'' said Anna Wintour, Vogue's editor
in chief.
</P>
<P>
   The new dames look at their mothers _ the '70s generation and
the '80s shoulder-pad brigade _ and see complete exhaustion. ``We
are the post-have-it-all generation and it doesn't look pretty,''
said Holly Peterson, an editor at Talk magazine. ``It doesn't look
pretty to drag in from the office without mascara, and look
frazzled at a party, never have sex and want to divorce.''
</P>
<P>
   Recently, Ms. Peterson confided, she threw out her ``young Brown
feminist'' wardrobe of pleated pants, Shetlands and Tretorn
sneakers for a fur-collared sweater and a single pair of Manolo
Blahniks, the same look Lauren Bacall had in the 1953 classic great
dame epic, ``How to Marry a Millionaire.''
</P>
<P>
   The novelist Erica Jong has noticed this phenomenon as well.
``Suddenly, the courtesan, the woman who knows how to manipulate
men, is seen as a role model,'' she said. ``Young women want to be
seen as mythic figures.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Jong, who is the mother of 21-year-old Molly Jong-Fast, a
novelist, has observed her daughter's friends. ``Molly will say to
me, `You were very foolish to do it all without a man.' She says,
`I want a career, but I want a man backing me up.'''
</P>
<P>
   The new dames marry younger, with bridal parties that seem to
echo Queen Elizabeth's. They attend Edwardian fancy dress balls at
the Frick Museum in tiers of see-through lace and satin, their
escorts in black top hats. Their biography of choice is Amanda
Foreman's ``Georgiana, Duchess of Devonshire,'' read for strategy
tips. Like the Duchess of Windsor, they invest in Verdura brooches
and pose on the cover of Quest magazine, promoting Palm Beach in
Lily Pulitzers the color of Key lime pie.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps the new dames are sending a terse message to my
generation: They do not want to run their houses and children from
a cell phone. They have learned from our stressed-out example that
you cannot do it all. Marina Rust, a young novelist and
great-dame-to-be, said: ``This is a reaction against choices our
parents made. It's not about being Sandra Day O'Connor versus Babe
Paley.''
</P>
<P>
   The cultural historian Ann Douglas calls this period of American
life ``a serious retro time'' in which there are obvious echoes
from the '50s, the '20s and even the gilded 1880s. ``Of course, it
has to do with how much money is around,'' Ms. Douglas said, but
she noted the lack of reform movements that the previous flush eras
of American life spawned. ``In the 1880s, there were Victoria
Woodhull and Emma Willard. In the 1920s, the country was engulfed
by protests, Sacco and Vanzetti, the unions, the Scottsboro Boys.
In the 1950s, we worried about the bomb and the cold war. Now, the
political edge and the feminist edge are gone.''
</P>
<P>
   The original great dames flourished in an atmosphere of grand
social purpose, as understood at the Alsop Georgetown dinners. They
could, to a woman, speak knowingly of public policy, civil rights
and cold war politics. They were as ambitious as corporate raiders
and they were determined to move up in the world.
</P>
<P>
   Before she walked into the segregated courtroom in Jackson,
Miss., in 1949, Constance Baker Motley spent a day at Lord &AMP; Taylor
searching for exactly the right dress. She was one of the first
black lawyers to appear in court in the Deep South. She used her
chic to rebuke the mural that decorated the courtroom walls: slaves
hoisting cotton bales on one side, white girls in white crinolines
on another. The politically active Marietta Tree liked to dress
like a torch singer in her '70s, but she used her earlier allure to
convince John Lindsay, then the mayor of New York, to light the
city's bridges, and in the last decades of her life she became a
city planner and designed urban projects in St. Louis and San
Antonio. Pamela Harriman started off as a courtesan with creamy
shoulders and was called ``the red-haired tart'' when she married
the son of Winston Churchill. But in her 60s, still with her creamy
shoulders, she had become a power in the Democratic party and
ambassador to France. When she died, President Clinton gave her
eulogy at the National Cathedral and celebrated her for helping him
win the White House. ``Today, I am here in no small measure because
of her,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The ultimate lesson of these formidable women is endurance, and
the true test of the arc of their lives is revealed in the flourish
of Act III. Can the new dames live up to this legacy? At this
moment, I am looking at an invitation for the Bunny Hop, a
children's party to benefit the pediatrics department of Memorial
Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center. It is 2000, women are in the
boardrooms and in surgeon's scrubs, yet the benefit committee,
young matrons of the city, are almost all listed by their husbands'
names _ Mrs. Thomas Glover, Mrs. Roger P. Griswold, Mrs. Anthony
Addison _ as if they are marooned in a John O'Hara world.
</P>
<P>
   Is the retro impulse limited only to the rich? Out on the
campaign trail, Karenna Gore Schiff is picking up a parallel
concern. ``I have noticed many young women are expressing anxiety
about the possibility of working and spending any real time with
their families,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   In my years in the feminist sorority, remarks like this would
have you blackballed from the club. What we lacked in our first
acts in style, we like to flatter ourselves, we made up for in
substance. But dame-ism, whether in Act I, II or III, is about a
marriage of style and substance. Once, I asked Mrs. Hart to
demonstrate her exercise routine for me. She did so without
hesitation, dropping to the floor and executing a perfect set of
leg lifts in a robe trimmed with marabou. ``Who were we to start
with?'' Mrs. Hart said to me that day. ``We knew that in life, it
all comes down to discipline.''
</P>
<P>
   Ultimately, great dame-ism is a matter of unquenchable spirit.
Those new dames who aspire to great dame-ness would do well to wear
the Manolo Blahniks, but not to throw away the tennis shoes.

 &HT;    Eds. Adds comments from Michael Kelly
 &HT;    Gore aide faces probe by State Department
 &HT;    By Ken Foskett
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Washington _ The State Department is investigating Tony Coelho,
presidential campaign chairman for Vice President Al Gore, for his
role in organizing the World Exposition in Portugal in 1998,
Coelho's attorney said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Stanley Brand said his client was cooperating with the inquiry,
which arose out of a critical audit of the World Expo in September
1999. Coelho was the U.S. commissioner general to the expo.
</P>
<P>
   News of the investigation by the State Department's office of
inspector general is reported in today's National Journal.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a rehash of everything that's been reported and talked
about since September,'' Brand said of the Journal article.
</P>
<P>
   Brand said Coelho began cooperating with the investigation in
November and had provided bank records as recently as January.
</P>
<P>
   Brand accused Journal editor Michael Kelly, a frequent Gore
critic, of political motivations in publishing the report just
three weeks after Gore wrapped up the Democratic nomination.
</P>
<P>
   ``Why all of the sudden is this news?'' Brand said.
</P>
<P>
   Kelly called the charges ``utterly baseless'' and said the story
was handled by Journal editor Charles Green.
</P>
<P>
   ``No political considerations played any part whatsoever in the
decision to run what was obviously a true, well-sourced and newsy
story,'' said Kelly.
</P>
<P>
   Coelho is credited with helping retool Gore's campaign after it
stumbled early against former rival Bill Bradley. But Coelho has
also been something of a lightening rod for criticism.
</P>
<P>
   Coelho resigned from Congress in 1989 after he failed to report
a loan from a troubled savings and loan institution. The Justice
Department investigated the loan but never filed charges.
</P>
<P>
   Coelho's latest legal problems arose from the nonpaid position
he took with the U.S. Information Agency to spearhead the United
States' exposition at the World Expo in Portugal.
</P>
<P>
   The State Department audit found that the expo was mismanaged
and overbudget, resulting in U.S. government agencies absorbing 82
percent of the cost when private donations were in fact supposed to
foot the bill.
</P>
<P>
   While the audit praised the expo for attracting millions of
visitors, Coelho was faulted for such internal management lapses as
putting his niece on the payroll at $2,500 a month, $900 more than
the office manager was receiving.
</P>
<P>
   The Gore campaign issued a strong endorsement of Coelho when the
audit was made public last fall, and again praised Coelho Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   ``Tony is doing a great job, day in and day out,'' said Chris
Lehane, Gore's spokesman.

of the Cold-War Soviet security services? Or is he in reality a
Kremlin insider, a crafty new-Russian power-broker who revels in
sleaze and arm-twisting? Any one of these three faces could be the
real Putin, the other two just political disguises...By The

   TEXTILE _The ``Norma Rae syndrome'' is hurting enrollment at

but students (and their parents) are stuck with the misperception
that textile equals apparel. (Bond, Atlanta Journal-Constitution)

 &HT;    COHEN SAYS PROMISE OF VETERANS' HEALTH CARE WILL BE KEPT
 &HT;    By JEFF NESMITH
 &HT;    c.2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Providing lifelong health care that older veterans
were promised if they made military service a career is a ``moral
obligation'' that the Pentagon will keep, Defense Secretary William
Cohen said Friday.
</P>
<P>
   The spreading unhappiness among retired members of the the Army,
Air Force, Navy, Marines and Coast Guard over not receiving health
care promised by recruiters may undermine recruitment in the modern
military, Cohen said.
</P>
<P>
   ``How do we tell the people who are coming in that when we make
a commitment, we are going to keep it?'' Cohen said. ``Some of the
retirees are saying to potential recruits, 'Don't join because they
won't take care of you and your family.' That can have a major
impact on recruitment.''
</P>
<P>
   However, he indicated that the Defense Department would continue
to oppose a class-action lawsuit claiming the government has failed
to live up to a legally binding contract by not providing the
health care.
</P>
<P>
   In a breakfast meeting with reporters, Cohen said he was working
with chairmen of the House and Senate appropriations committees to
come up with funds to pay for the promised care.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's going to be very expensive, but it's a moral obligation
and we intend to meet that obligation,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Pentagon lawyers acknowledge that recruiters told young men and
women entering the military before June 1956 that a military career
would earn them free health care at military hospitals for them and
their families for life.
</P>
<P>
   The government says that without authorization from Congress,
the promises did not constitute enforceable contracts, and at least
two federal judges have agreed.
</P>
<P>
   A spokesman for an organization that has spearheaded the
campaign to get the promised health care for retirees said
veterans' groups will lobby to support the Pentagon's request for
funds to provide the care.
</P>
<P>
   ``We agree wholeheartedly with the secretary,'' said Jay Bapple,
associate legislative counsel of the National Association for the
Uniformed Services. ``We wish he had been able to persuade the
president to put it in the budget. We'll support the secretary when
he goes back to Congress and asks for these funds.''
</P>
<P>
   Because of base closings, many military hospitals where the free
care was to be provided no longer exist, and retirees have been
shifted to the Defense Department's Tricare program, which requires
its beneficiaries to pay a portion of their medical expenses.
</P>
<P>
   When retirees reach 65, they are enrolled in Medicare and
dropped from Tricare. If they want outpatient coverage, they are
forced to pay $45.50 a month for Medicare's ``Part B'' plan, and
Medicare does not pay for prescription drugs.
</P>
<P>
   ``Keep-the-promise'' bills introduced in the House and Senate
would require the Pentagon to give retirees who began military
service prior to June 1956 fully paid coverage under the Federal
Employees Health Benefit Plan, which insures civilian government
employees.
</P>
<P>
   Retired veterans who enlisted after June 1956, when the Defense
Department health care system was reorganized, would be allowed to
``buy into'' the plan, with the government paying the same portion
it now pays for retired civil service employees. No one knows
precisely how many veterans would be covered by the bills.
</P>
<P>
   According to some estimates, the legislation would cost more
than $8 billion a year.

WILL OSCAR FIND ROOM FOR THE NEW?
</HEADLINE>
  (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
(Eds: For use on Mar. 26, 2000) 
By BOB STRAUSS 
c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences has a
well-deserved reputation for upholding traditions and playing
favorites. But you can't accuse it of old-school stuffiness this
year.
</P>
<P>
   More than half of the 72nd Academy Awards' acting nominees are
first-time contenders, including the entire supporting actress
contingent. Four of the five directors are newbies as well, two for
their feature film debuts.
</P>
<P>
   The big question, of course, is whether this emphasis on the new
will result in a bumper crop of freshman statuettes. If predictions
and the results of recent years are any indications, the answer is
yes.
</P>
<P>
   Not since the dozen years following Oscar's 1927 birth have
first-time-at-bat actors and directors won as many awards as they
have over the last half-decade. Each year since 1995, at least
three of the five acting/directing awards have gone to such academy
frosh as Nicolas Cage, Kevin Spacey, Geoffrey Rush, Cuba Gooding
Jr., Anthony Minghella, Helen Hunt, James Cameron, Gwyneth Paltrow,
Roberto Benigni and that late bloomer James Coburn.
</P>
<P>
   It usually hasn't been like this _ practically from the very
beginning, in fact. The academy started playing favorites by its
third year of existence, bestowing a second nomination on actress
Gloria Swanson and a second Oscar on director Lewis Milestone. In
Oscar's fifth year, Wallace Beery and Frederic March, both previous
contestants, split the best actor prize.
</P>
<P>
   The awards' sixth year (1933) saw the first nomination for
director Frank Capra, who would dominate the category for the
decade, winning in 1934, `36 and '38. That same year, Katharine
Hepburn won her first Oscar for ``Morning Glory''; of course, she
went on to capture the lifetime record for actors with a total of
four statuettes.
</P>
<P>
   And so it went throughout the 1930s. Luise Rainer won the first
consecutive best actress Oscars; a year behind her, Spencer Tracy
repeated the feat in the men's category. Walter Brennan set the
speed record for winning three acting awards in a mere five years.
Bette Davis won two and was nominated five years in a row.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps most instructively, lifetime directing Oscar champ John
Ford won one of his four awards for ``How Green Was My Valley'' in
1941, the year an obviously undeserving tyro named Orson Welles
came out with a controversial little money-loser called ``Citizen
Kane.''
</P>
<P>
   Although Oscar preferences were set in stone by the World War II
era, newbies who could generate the right kind of extra attention
were starting to do well. The ceremonies for 1939 saw both the
fiery English import Vivien Leigh and Hattie McDaniel, the first
African-American winner, ride the sweep to victory for ``Gone With
the Wind.''
</P>
<P>
   For the next couple of decades, it helped to be exceptionally
attractive (Jennifer Jones, Ray Milland, Anne Baxter, Audrey
Hepburn, Eva Marie Saint); or atypically not so (Broderick
Crawford, Ernest Borgnine, Shirley Booth); or an exception to the
Hollywood norm (``The Best Years of Our Lives''' wounded veteran
Harold Russell, unseen-before-or-since foreign actresses such as
Katina Paxinou and Miyoshi Umeki).
</P>
<P>
   In Oscar's fourth decade, many a distinguished career was
launched with a golden boy, including Joanne Woodward's, Julie
Christie's and Goldie Hawn's, as well as Julie Andrews' and Barbra
Streisand's, who both won for their first movie appearances.
</P>
<P>
   Much of the same criteria held through the last 30 years of the
century. In the distinguished career department, actors Robert De
Niro, Michael Douglas, Emma Thompson, Daniel Day-Lewis and Anthony
Hopkins and directors Woody Allen, James L. Brooks and Oliver Stone
were prominent winners among first-time nominees. Actors honored in
a spirit of diversity included Linda Hunt, Marlee Matlin and the
late Dr. Haing S. Ngor.
</P>
<P>
   One major trend that emerged over the last 20 years was movie
stars winning Academy Awards for their first directing efforts _
Robert Redford for ``Ordinary People,'' Kevin Costner for ``Dances
With Wolves,'' Mel Gibson for ``Braveheart.'' And of course, Clint
Eastwood won for ``Unforgiven,'' his first nomination after nearly
30 years in the business.
</P>
<P>
   But there has also been a troubling trend among first-time
winners of the '80s and '90s. The names F. Murray Abraham, Timothy
Hutton, Ben Kingsley, William Hurt, Brenda Fricker, Marisa Tomei,
Mercedes Ruehl and Mira Sorvino, among others, did not stay long
atop A-lists for casting.
</P>
<P>
   Overall, though, this year's first-time winners _ and there's
guaranteed to be at least one _ should be pretty pleased about the
relatively rarefied company they'll join. Being in the vanguard of
Oscar's growing determination to renew its franchise is not a bad
consolation prize, either. &QL;

ODDS LOOK BRIGHT FOR DARK FILM
</HEADLINE>
  (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
(For use on March 26, 2000) 
By GLENN WHIPP 
c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News 
<TEXT>
<P>
   If you haven't seen ``American Beauty,'' chances are tonight's
Academy Awards ceremony won't hold much interest for you. Having
already won honors from the Directors Guild, Producers Guild and
Screen Actors Guild, the bittersweet suburban satire stands poised
to sweep the four major categories (picture, director, actor and
actress). It would be the first film since ``Silence of the Lambs''
(and only the fourth movie in Oscar history) to pull off that
trick. (``It Happened One Night'' and ``One Flew Over the Cuckoo's
Nest'' are the others.)
</P>
<P>
   The sweep would be a monumental accomplishment for a very
deserving film. It would also be somewhat of a travesty, given that
1999 produced a significant number of excellent films. To salute
one at the complete expense of all the others shows an utter lack
of imagination. But then, predictability has always been a hallmark
of Hollywood, so, in a perverse way, it makes perfect sense.
</P>
<P>
   Here are my predictions for the major categories. I'd sacrifice
my Oscar pool to be wrong on a couple, just for the sake of
surprise. But I'm not holding my breath.
</P>
<P>
   !folo!Best picture: ``American Beauty.'' As I've already noted,
the film has won every major award, making it a virtual shoe-in for
the top honors here. It also leads the field with the most
nominations, which has guaranteed victory all but once in the last
two decades. (``Silence of the Lambs'' was the exception.) It's
simple, really. A large number of nominations indicate a broad base
of support. ``Shakespeare in Love'' led the field last year, making
its ``surprise'' victory much less astonishing in perspective.
</P>
<P>
   folo!Best actor: When he picked up his Golden Globe for ``The
Hurricane'' in January, Denzel Washington reigned as the favorite
in this category. But the barrage of criticism over the movie's
accuracy has damaged Washington's chances. His performance is the
movie's sole nomination, a bad sign. Richard Farnsworth has the
same problem.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the Screen Actors Guild chose Spacey, a significant
win given that the actors bloc is by far the biggest segment of the
academy. Look for Spacey to add a matching bookend to the
supporting actor Oscar he won in 1995 for ``The Usual Suspects.''
</P>
<P>
   !folo!Best actress: Critical darling Hilary Swank seemed like a
sure thing until SAG voters gave Annette Bening their award. In
addition to being in the front-running film, Bening has the
advantages of her very visible pregnancy and her marriage to Warren
Beatty, who will be receiving the Irving Thalberg Award during the
ceremonies. A Bening win just makes for a better Hollywood moment
(think of Roberto Benigni's theatrics last year), never mind that
Swank gave the category's most astonishing performance.
</P>
<P>
   !folo!Best supporting actor: This is the evening's toughest
call. Does the award go to Tom Cruise for his career achievement
(not to mention a pretty amazing turn in ``Magnolia'')? Or to
Michael Caine, one of the most popular actors in the business, for
his sweet turn in ``Cider House Rules''? Then there's Haley Joel
Osment, the 11-year-old who carried ``The Sixth Sense'' on his
small shoulders. Kids don't usually do well in this category, but
this young man has a lot of well-placed fans. Plus, everybody has
seen his movie, something Cruise cannot boast.
</P>
<P>
   !folo!Best supporting actress: Toni Collette could well benefit
from ``The Sixth Sense's'' popularity as well, although people tend
to remember the spooky kid and the surprise ending and not her
performance. On the other hand, Angelina Jolie has a flamboyant
role and an outsized personality that voters seem drawn to. (Just
ask the Hollywood Foreign Press Association, which has given her
three Golden Globes.) Factor in Jolie's lineage (she's Jon Voight's
daughter) and her SAG win and you have a pretty convincing case in
her favor.
</P>
<P>
   !folo!Best director: Sam Mendes for ``American Beauty.'' He won
the Directors Guild award, one of the surest indicators in any
category. And he's eminently deserving of the honor.
</P>
<P>
   !folo!Best original screenplay: Charlie Kaufman has a lot of
support for ``Being John Malkovich,'' and M. Night Shyamalan wrote
and directed the year's most discussed movie. But this is an
``American Beauty'' pageant, and Alan Ball will emerge victorious.
</P>
<P>
   !folo!Best adapted screenplay: ``Cider House Rules'' has to win
something to justify those Miramax advertising dollars. And giving
an award to John Irving, as close as Hollywood gets to literary
respectability, will make the academy look good, even though it's
the safest and dullest choice of the bunch.

A SNAPSHOT OF THE CINEMATOGRAPHERS
</HEADLINE>
  (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BOB STRAUSS 
c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The name of the club is Academy of MOTION PICTURE Arts and
Sciences. And there would be no MPs without the DPs: directors of
photography, also known as cinematographers. These are the artists
who decide how to light, frame and move the camera around the
images that make movies the unique storytelling form that they are.
</P>
<P>
   And this year's Oscar nominees have brought remarkable vision to
the task:
</P>
<P>
   ``American Beauty,'' Conrad L. Hall: Veteran shooter Hall, a
previous winner for ``Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid,''
orchestrated an apt mixture of visual strategies for this funny and
moving portrait of family dysfunction.
</P>
<P>
   ``The different film styles were so ingrained into the story
that they didn't clash,'' Hall says. ``We needed to see things
through the videocamera of the boy next door, because that's how he
looked at life. For the main part of the film, we wanted to have
this rigid, classic sense of composition for a lot of the scenes,
to watch the actors behave rather than go dollying around and that
sort of thing. The important thing was to get to the essence of the
characters through the lighting and the composition and the
stillness of the proscenium.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The End of the Affair,'' Roger Pratt: The British Pratt's
eclectic resume ranges from Richard Attenborough's sedate
``Shadowlands'' to Tim Burton's ornate ``Batman'' to Terry
Gilliam's irate ``Brazil.'' For Neil Jordan's adaptation of Graham
Greene's classic novel, Pratt had to re-create the dreariness and
tension of wartime London, then invest it with the urgency of an
illicit romance and a sense of spiritual transcendence.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am not old enough to have lived through the war,'' Pratt
notes. ``The '50s were my childhood. England was still recovering,
but I had a feeling for that even darker time. England was muted:
No garish clothes, rationing, no snazzy paints for sale in the
hardware store. There was a single light bulb in the middle of
every room. It was claustrophobic. And everybody smoked. That was
the canvas.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The Insider,'' Dante Spinotti: Previously nominated for ``L.A.
Confidential,'' the Italian master employed all of his subtle
skills to keep this lengthy, complicated tale told mostly by
talking heads gripping and engaging from start to finish.
</P>
<P>
   ``This story was all about dialogue,'' Spinotti acknowledges.
``We went in two directions. One was to try to accentuate any
existing situation through unusual lighting patterns, while still
striving for a realistic look. And we tried to achieve a kind of
false cinema verite, make it look like the movie was shot in
documentary style, although everything was controlled and
calculated according to the emotional plan that was running
throughout the picture.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Sleepy Hollow,'' Emmanuel Lubezki: After leaving his
distinctive mark on the films of Mexican directors Alfonso Arau
(``Like Water for Chocolate'') and Alfonso Cuaron (``A Little
Princess''), Lubezki applied a darker kind of magical realism to
Tim Burton's grisly retelling of the classic ghost story. Filming
almost entirely on sets and through clouds of studio smoke,
Lubezki's shadowy schemes convinced us we were in primeval, haunted
forests of two centuries past while sustaining an unerring sense of
earthy eeriness.
</P>
<P>
   ``Snow Falling on Cedars,'' Robert Richardson: Best-known for
the virtuosic visual cacophony of his work for Oliver Stone and
Martin Scorsese, ``JFK'' Oscar winner Richardson also proved adept
at capturing the sweeping, natural beauty on Robert Redford's ``The
Horse Whisperer.'' For this postwar drama set in fog-soaked Puget
Sound, the cinematographer made compelling use of limited natural
light sources and imparted an almost magical quality to such
elements as water, air, fire and, yes, wood and snow.

Defense Secretary William Cohen said Friday. Cohen told reporters
at a breakfast that keeping the promise would be ``expensive,'' but
that the military was working on a plan to fund it. A class-action
lawsuit an en e-mail movement among retirees seek to force the
administration and Congress to make good on recruiters' promises to
provide free health care for life to those who made military
service a career. (Nesmith, Cox News Service). 22.

A GOOD CREW CHIEF IS KEY IN NASCAR 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By PATRICK ZIER   
 The Ledger, Lakeland, Fla.   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   In Winston Cup racing, you can now make the argument now that an
elite crew chief is more important than an elite driver.
Engineering and improved aerodynamics have changed racing so
dramatically that without a near-perfect car, no driver has any
chance of winning.
</P>
<P>
   And it's usually the crew chief who masterminds how a car is set
up and how the body is shaped. It's the crew chief who goes over
every inch trying to find some way to gain an edge.
</P>
<P>
   It didn't used to be that way. Once, no one made major changes
in a car during the race. If a car was loose, it was up to the
driver to slide the rear end around the corner without spinning,
not up to the crew to tighten it up. When you went into a turn, the
guy who was willing to take the greatest risks made the greatest
gains.
</P>
<P>
   Now, aerodynamics is so key that you can barely touch another
car at speed for fear of causing a wreck. Heck, drivers can
sometimes cause another car to lose it just by getting up close and
changing the air flow over the rear spoiler.
</P>
<P>
   In the past, drivers compensated for problems that developed
during the race. No more.
</P>
<P>
   On short tracks, it once was standard procedure for a fast car
to come up on a slower one, tap him once on the rear bumper and
spin him if he didn't move over. Normally, the driver of the
spinning car would regain control and move on. That's less likely
now. Cars are now more sensitive and anything that upsets them is
much more likely to put them out of control.
</P>
<P>
   That's why chassis experts have become so valuable.
</P>
<P>
   Rusty Wallace is probably as good a driver now as he was a few
years ago, but he isn't doing nearly as well. Why? Because he lost
both Jimmy Makar and Todd Parrett, two of the elite crew chiefs in
NASCAR.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Parrett's cars took Dale Jarrett to a Winston Cup
championship in 1999 and Maker may well take Bobby Labonte to one
in 2000.
</P>
<P>
   Clearly, Jeff Gordon without his former crew chief Ray Evernham
is not nearly the force he was. Tommy Baldwin has made all the
difference for Ward Burton, who won last Sunday in Darlington, S.C.
</P>
<P>
   So, if you've got some extra millions laying around and want to
start a Winston Cup team, don't worry about getting a driver. Get
somebody who can build a winning car first.

   GLOBALIZATION-CONFLICTS-REVIEW (Washington) _ For seven years,
Bill Clinton has tried to offer the world's conflict-prone nations
a new commitment to globalization as the cure for an old fear of
armageddon. He made the case again last week racing through South
Asia. It proved a hard sell. Meanwhile, events in two other
flashpoints _ the Middle East and the Taiwan Strait _ were also
testing the Clinton mantra, which seemed so reasonable just a few
years ago: that sharing in global prosperity will inevitably tame
old nationalisms and make the world safer. Each of those disputes,
of course, is driven by its own history of conflict. But they all
illustrate the dangers of too simplistic a faith in the lure of the
market when nationalistic impulses flare up. By David E. Sanger.

<P>
   SOFT-MONEY-REVIEW (WASHINGTON) _ In 1988, Bob Farmer, the top
fund-raiser man for Michael Dukakis and the Democrats, and Bob
Mosbacher, finance chairman for George Bush and the Republicans,
launched the first national programs to raise soft money _ the
large, unrestricted gifts to the two parties by wealthy
individuals, corporations and labor unions. Both Farmer and
Mosbacher have lived to regret their fiscal ingenuity and now favor
campaign finance reform. By Jill Abramson.
</P>
<P>
   LAWSUITS-TOBACCO-REVIEW (Undated) _ The legal system has begun
to overtake the legislative process as the vehicle to resolve
contentious debates, particularly over controversial products when
Congress is unwilling to act. Both the tobacco and firearms
litigation, for example, were highly organized assaults on targeted
industries. Previously, lawsuits had been brought by individuals
against both industries with little financial success or effect on
company policies. The use of concentrated legal firepower to set
social policy has stirred sharp debate. Some legal experts have
decried such lawsuits as abusive. Others view them as a problematic
but a needed counterbalance to the powerful control that companies
and interest groups can exert over Congress. By Barry Meier.
</P>
<P>
   OSCARS-SOCIETY-REVIEW (Undated) _ This year's Academy Award
nominations include a melange of comedies, dramas and absurd
flights of fancy that once again speak to the national psyche.
Judging from the contents of these films, the country appears to be
a mess. Some thoughts on what that little man of gold might be
saying about America. By Bruce Kluger.
</P>
<P>
   BOYCOTTS-REVIEW (Undated) _ Even sponsors of boycotts
acknowledge these weapons have a mixed record of success and can
hurt friend as well as foe. To be sure, some boycotts succeed, as
was the case with the 1956 Montgomery bus boycott, which pressured
that city to stop requiring blacks to sit at the back of the bus.
But sometimes boycotts fail and just fade away. Although most
Americans do not realize it, the grape boycott announced by the
United Farm Workers in 1984 remains in force. By Steven Greenhouse.
</P>
<P>
   HAIRDRESSERS-WIFEBEATING-REVIEW (Undated) _ Remember Clairol's
catchy slogan from the 1950s, ``Hair color so natural, only her
hairdresser knows for sure''? In recognition that hair stylists may
know more secrets about their clients than merely cosmetic ones,
new programs are being established by community-based organizations
and state agencies to help hairdressers identify signs of domestic
violence. These programs are trying to take advantage of the
special bond that often exists between hairdressers and their
clients. By Jeff Stryker.
</P>
<P>
   RADIO-GURU-TEXT-REVIEW (Undated) _ From 1956 to 1977, Jean
Shepherd held weeknight seminars on a New York radio station that
were part Kabuki, part commedia dell'arte, part Uncle Remus. In his
flat, nasal Indiana twang, playing all the parts, and the
occasional kazoo, he oozed into the darkened bedrooms of East Coast
America on the battery power of cheap Japanese transistor radios.
The meandering stories he told were usually about him but they also
seemed to be about us. What was he? Social commentator? Cult
leader? Or just a manic kid from a blue-collar background
discovering his subversive id. Excerpts from a recent radio
tribute.

   U.S.-EXTRADITE-REVIEW (Undated) _ The initial rulings against
Chile's Gen. Augusto Pinochet caused some former U.S. officials to
wonder whether they too could some day be extradited _ let us say,
if the United States lost its position as the world's sole
superpower _ and put on trial any time that any judge in the world
accuses them of human rights violations. Imagine, for instance,
that Oliver North is arrested while vacationing in Switzerland and
then extradited to Lebanon for his role in the U.S. bombings of
Libya in 1986. By Jayson Blair.
</P>
<P>
   RUSSIA-PUTIN-REVIEW (Moscow) _ Vladimir Putin's most serious
effort since assuming the leadership of Russia has been prosecuting
the brutal military operation in Chechnya, intended to prove that
he is the firm hand that can rebuild a strong Russian state. But
far more complex and difficult tests await him on that very score.
His real challenge will be the appointments, the policies and
economic reforms he undertakes to bring Russia back from the brink
of disintegration. By Patrick E. Tyler.

 &HT;    GORE CHOOSES THE CLASSROOM AS HIS BATTLEGROUND WITH BUSH
 &HT;    By SCOTT SHEPARD
 &HT;    c.2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   MACOMB, Mich. _ See Al run. See Al run to be the education
president.
</P>
<P>
   That was Vice President Al Gore's assignment Friday during his
day-long visit to L'Anse Creuse Middle School North in this
blue-collar suburb of Detroit: to convince swing voters that he
will do more to improve education than his presidential rival, Gov.
George W. Bush of Texas.
</P>
<P>
   But in the process, Gore appeared to having the most fun ever in
his campaign for the Democratic presidential nomination.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can call me Al,'' he told 13-year-old Dan Lindeman upon
arriving at the school. Lindeman had a double row of spikes in his
hair, but Al never mentioned the do.
</P>
<P>
   Al lectured Diane Persha's history class about the industrial
age, with special attention to the cotton gin and telegraph, but
refrained from taking credit for either invention.
</P>
<P>
   Al rejoiced that Friday meant pizza for lunch, and he gobbled
down the pepperoni, listed on the cafeteria menu as ``Hungry
Howie's.''
</P>
<P>
   Al even joined an exercise in Sally Hannert's drama class in
which the actors were allowed to speak only gibberish as they
portrayed a father scolding his daughter about bad grades.
</P>
<P>
   ``Wub woo bub bub wub, wub,'' he said to the delight of the
sixth-graders in the class.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're getting ready for our debates with George Bush,'' Gore
spokesman Chris Lehane immediately quipped, alluding to Bush's
reputation as intellectual slacker.
</P>
<P>
   But Gore's visit to the middle school in this predominantly
white bedroom community _ which coincided with Bush's visit to
Central High School in Little Rock, Ark., whose desegregation made
history _ underscores the importance of the education issue in this
year's presidential election.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is no higher priority for our future than giving our
children the best education in the world,'' Gore said as he kicked
off a series of visits with students, teachers and parents that his
campaign is calling ``School Days.''
</P>
<P>
   In fact, the kind of attention education is getting from Gore
and Bush has not been seen in a presidential campaign since 1964,
when President Lyndon Johnson was trying to expand the federal role
in what is still mostly a function of local and state government.
</P>
<P>
   Polls consistently show that education is a big issue,
particularly with women, the most important voting group in the
last two presidential elections.
</P>
<P>
   And while the Democratic Party has long been the party most
trusted by voters to improve education, Bush is close to stealing
the education issue from Gore. A recent poll by the Pew Research
Center found 44 percent of voters think Bush would do ``the best
job'' on education, while 41 percent thought Gore would.
</P>
<P>
   ``That is very surprising, given the Democratic Party's
traditional edge on this issue,'' said Andrew Kohut, the center's
director.
</P>
<P>
   Education reform, however, is a subject on which Bush has shown
passion and knowledge. While he views education as largely the
prerogative of local government, the governor is planning a series
of speeches on the ``common ideals'' that should guide education
policy.
</P>
<P>
   But Gore is following the same tactic against Bush that he used
so effectively in vanquishing Bill Bradley, his rival in the
Democratic primaries. Gore tries to be first out of the starting
blocks with his own proposals, at the same time pounding away at
his rival's record.
</P>
<P>
   Just as he did with Bradley's health care proposals, Gore is
probing for the weak spots in Bush's education record. So far,
Gore's attention has rested primarily on a 1999 study that 76
percent of Texas schools report a need to upgrade or repair their
facilities _ among the worst states in national rankings. The study
was conducted by the National Education Association (NEA), the
nation's largest teachers union, which has endorsed Gore's
presidential bid.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's pretty hard to reform a school that's falling down,''
Gore said at a campaign stop in Ohio on Thursday en route to
Michigan. ``That is why we need a new national commitment to
rebuild and modernize public schools.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We're going to be talking about the mess in Texas,'' Lehane
said Friday. ``We're not talking about the people of Texas. We're
talking about that they deserve better.''
</P>
<P>
   One cornerstone of Gore's campaign is a plan to spend $115
billion over 10 years on a host of education programs, including
universal pre-school, expanded after-school programs, modernizing
schools and reducing class sizes by providing local school boards
with more money to hire teachers.
</P>
<P>
   Outside of Social Security and federal health care programs,
education is the single largest spending proposal he has made.

   L'Anse Creuse was a near-perfect backdrop for his modernization
proposal. Founded in 1966, the school has an enrollment of 905. But

and give the money instead to parents in the form of vouchers that

   Bush also has proposed letting families put $5,000 per year into
a tax-free education savings account for each elementary or
secondary school student. Currently the law allows $500 per year
for college expenses.

 &HT;    Black religious leaders examine King's vow on 'Promised Land'
 &HT;    By John Blake
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ On the last night of his life, the Rev. Martin Luther
King Jr. delivered an apocalyptic sermon, vowing that black people
would get ``to the Promised Land.''
</P>
<P>
   On April 4, the 32nd anniversary of his assassination, an
intriguing mixture of black religious leaders from across the
nation will gather in Atlanta to discuss whether King's vow will
ever come true.
</P>
<P>
   The first Spiritual State of Black America conference, a
three-day program sponsored by the Interdenominational Theological
Center, will consist of seminars, moderated discussions and sermons
by some of the most powerful preachers in the country.
</P>
<P>
   But what separates this conference from the rest is its
electrifying mix of speakers. Leaders from the black Muslim
community, the black church and black political organizations will
debate one another over their vision of the Promised Land.
</P>
<P>
   ITC President Robert Franklin said he organized the conference
because King's vision still challenges America.
</P>
<P>
   ``We want to use (the conference) as a kind of moral checkpoint
for examining the spiritual state of black America, but also the
spiritual and theological condition of the larger nation,''
Franklin said.
</P>
<P>
   Conference speakers include Hugh Price, president of the
National Urban League; Julian Bond, chairman of the NAACP; Imam
Warith Deen Mohammed, head of the American Muslim Society and son
of the founder of the Nation of Islam; Minister Ava Muhammad,
Southern regional representative for the Nation of Islam; and
Bishop John Hurst Adams from the AME Church.
</P>
<P>
   Any conclusions or solutions to issues raised at the conference
will be compiled into a report that will eventually be released to
the public, Franklin said.
</P>
<P>
   The report, he says, will hopefully note signs that King's vow
is not far off _ the Promised Land is in sight.
</P>
<P>
   But there's still work to do.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you look at our poorest communities,'' Franklin said, ``you
still see violent behaviors, substance abuse, HIV infection and a
high level of despair.''

 &HT;    Parents need to help their youngsters find films that are
healthy and fun
 &HT;    By Gayle White
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Sabreen Muwakkil and her husband have watched ``The Green
Mile,'' a nominee for Best Picture when the annual Academy Awards
are handed out Sunday. They liked the film adaptation of Stephen
King's death row novel, but Muwakkil won't let her teenage children
see it.
</P>
<P>
   ``If it's R-rated, we generally don't let them go,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   A few months ago, Ellen Italiaander took her young children to
see ``Stuart Little,'' a visual effects Academy Award contender
based on an E.B. White story about a 3-inch-tall mouse. She was
shocked when the movie's cute critters let loose with a couple of
expletives.
</P>
<P>
   ``I enjoy going to the movies,'' said Italiaander, the mother of
six children under 9 years old. ``But I think moviemakers do a bad
job of creating films that are just healthy and fun to watch.''
</P>
<P>
   Muwakkil, a Muslim who worships at Atlanta's Masjid Al-Islam,
and Italiaander, a member of The Temple, a Reform Jewish
congregation, are trying to raise their children in homes based on
sound religious faith and practice. Both, like millions of other
parents, struggle with how to help their offspring deal with
popular culture.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think movies have a huge impression on children,'' said
Italiaander. ``There's enough stress out there without going to see
something inappropriate.''
</P>
<P>
   The effect of a film may go far beyond whether there's cursing,
sex or violence, say people who review films for religious
publications.
</P>
<P>
   ``Do all films contain a message?'' asks Ed McNulty, a
Presbyterian Church (U.S.A.) minister in New York state who
publishes a film review magazine called Visual Parables. ``They do
in the sense that there's a worldview that underlies them. The
question is what message? Sometimes the messages are anything but
what people of faith would prefer.''
</P>
<P>
   Theodore ``Ted'' Baehr, publisher of Movieguide magazine and
head of the Christian Film and Television Commission in Los
Angeles, says viewers can find the message of the movie in its
conclusion. ``Does virtue and decency and honesty triumph over
adversity?''
</P>
<P>
   Baehr does not advocate goody-two-shoes movies with no tension.
``If you take the bad person out, there's no conflict,'' he said,
but added that greed and violence should not win in the end.
</P>
<P>
   Not all people of faith _ nor all Christian movie reviewers _
have the same opinions of the same films.
</P>
<P>
   Take ``The Tigger Movie,'' a brand-new, apparently innocent
animation of the adventures of A.A. Milne's popular gang including
Pooh, Piglet, Baby Roo and the rest.
</P>
<P>
   ``It turned out to have a powerful message that there's family
everywhere that's caring,'' said McNulty.
</P>
<P>
   But Phil Boatwright, who reviews films from an evangelical
Christian point of view as The Movie Reporter and lives in Thousand
Oaks, Calif., says he thinks Tigger advocated ``a new family
structure'' that ``goes hand-in-hand with same-sex marriage.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It puts off the responsibility of family,'' he said. ``It's
kind of like we're restructuring our society.''
</P>
<P>
   A controversial film such as ``Dogma'' invites even stronger
disagreement. To McNulty, who teaches a workshop called ``Sitting
in the Dark Looking for the Light,'' the film ``was really
preaching against the phony cheap gimmicks to sell Jesus to the
masses.'' McNulty rated ``Dogma'' one of the top 10 films of the
year.
</P>
<P>
   Baehr's group classified the film as ``Evil.''
</P>
<P>
   Baehr was equally unimpressed with some of the nominees for Best
Picture. His organization gave its annual $25,000 Epiphany Prize
for the Most Inspiring Movie of 1999 to ``The Winslow Boy,'' which
did not make the academy's cut. He said the movie, about a
barrister defending a young man accused of theft, presents a
``Christian worldview of justice'' with the theme that ``the
powerless must be protected against the powerful.''
</P>
<P>
   Even films with important messages that are inspiring to adults
may be inappropriate for children, Baehr said. His favorite example
is ``Schindler's List,'' the 1993 Academy Award winner about the
Holocaust that included graphic images from concentration camps.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are some tough movies like 'The Green Mile' that are
just about topics that children at certain stages of development
will not understand fully,'' he said. And parents should not rely
on their children's assurance that they are ready for a deep film.
</P>
<P>
   ``What makes this so complex is that kids always want to say
they can handle it,'' Baehr said, ``but they don't have the
apparatus to connect all the dots.''
</P>
<P>
   Before children _ or teenagers or even adults _ can make
adequate discernment about the messages they are receiving from
culture, they must be grounded in the values of their own faith and
family, said Boatwright. ``As you develop your spiritual life,
you're going to be able to see the faults and inadequacies.''
</P>
<P>
   Boatwright, Baehr and McNulty all recommend that parents try to
see films before they let their children, even teenagers, see them
and that the family discuss each movie and what it means.
</P>
<P>
   Muwakkil said she and her husband already are doing that with
their children, a son who is a sophomore at Morehouse College and
daughters who are a sophomore and a junior at Clara Muhammad School
in east Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   ``Usually we talk about a movie just to see what kind of effect
it might have on them or to see their viewpoint,'' she said.
``We'll discuss any good that was in it. And we always try to
discuss stereotypes or any other things we don't approve of.''
</P>
<P>
   Italiaander describes herself and her husband, who attends the
Orthodox synagogue Congregation Ariel, as ``very conservative as
parents.'' She said she plans to try to see every movie before she
allows her children to go.
</P>
<P>
   ``In society today, there's a lot going on out there. I want to
make sure my children have all the right information from me and my
husband, not from TV and not from the movies.''

   THE GREEN MILE
</P>
<P>
   This fascinating ``Holy Fool'' story contains many Christian
references. It is filled with moments of grace, respect, love,
forgiveness, and talks about divine topics, including the Last
Judgment. It also has some direct references to Christ, God and
Christian behavior, mixed, regrettably, with some strong
profanities.

   Told with conviction, intensity and adroit acting, this tale of
whistle blowing and tobacco companies has some moral elements
concerning telling the truth, product liability and the ethics of
TV journalism. It also has some mild humanist and politically
correct elements that give too much power to big government.

   Endorses abortion. As William Norman Grigg noted in The New

sanctity of life, an approach that Adolf Hitler and his
trench-coated mass murderers would love.

   This may be the year's best film with its reverence for things
seen and not seen, and the main character's regard for human life.
A profound movie that respectfully raises questions concerning
God's power and man's ability to do great good or great evil. What

   With many elements of Hitchcockian-suspense, director M. Night

   Well-crafted, but it is Hollywood's definition of right and

   Brilliantly acted, with stinging dialogue, but the film, besides
containing so much objectionable material, also seems bent on
ridiculing and debasing U.S. suburban life. It is the most

develop a spiritual walk may find the lack of spirituality and the
despicable behavior disturbing and unsatisfying.

   Powerfully moving in its orphanage sequences, dominated by an
idealistic doctor who breaks ``the rules'' in performing abortions
on women in need. But its Dickensian growing-up story is weakened
by a cliche romance and its condescending treatment of
African-American migrant workers. Making the young man's decision

weakens the movie's ``argument'' in favor of abortion.

surprised or pleased that it took a 90-degree turn toward a

   I see this as a wonderful tale of human decency and divine

   I was surprised by the choice of this film which, in turn, has a
surprise ending to it. It's a film that affirms that there is a
life beyond what our five senses can detect. It's a film that
affirms the importance of human relationships and, unfortunately,
one character doesn't learn that until pretty late. I was intrigued
_ there have been several films along this line that there is a
justice in our universe that must be satisfied if a dead victim is
to truly rest in peace.

   Even though it's controversial for some because of its stand on

   A close second to American Beauty and will probably win, if for
no other reason than the prestige associated with Stephen King and
the amazing cast. The characters suffer a bit from stagnation, and
the believability of John Coffey's (Michael Clarke Duncan) healing
power is questionable. Overall, the film is strong and offers a

   Cider House Rules
</P>
<P>
   A blatantly pro-choice film, presents strong social arguments
for keeping abortion legal but falls short in the running for Best
Picture. The underdeveloped character Candy weakens the movie, and
the lack of discussion of religious-based objections to abortion
serves as the film's death sentence for winning Best Picture.

   Depicts the story of a little boy haunted by ghosts and his
relationship with his mother and psychologist. The moral message in
this film is an interesting twist on the old golden rule since the
people the child learns to help are dead. Although the performance
of Haley Joel Osment is incredible, the film itself is rather weak
and leaves too many unanswered questions to win Best Picture.

 &HT;    Mix of high-tech art, international flavor at heart of Whitney

a good start. The work of the 97 artists is serious, thoughtful,
inventive and carefully crafted. If this graciously installed
exhibition lacks the boisterousness of past biennials, a sense of
maturity is not a bad trade. And most welcome of all, it doesn't
stick its finger or its rear end in your face, which goes to show
you that art _ and the biennial _ can be provocative without being
shrill and confrontational.
</P>
<P>
   (Hans Haacke's critique of New York Mayor Rudolph Giuliani's
response to the Brooklyn Museum of Art's ``Sensation'' exhibition
is the exception, and it looks so ``last century.'')
</P>
<P>
   The biennial aims to survey what is being made in America. Its
observation: everything, from abstract painting to installation to
Internet art (included for the first time.) Still, this is
definitely the year of technology. In addition to Net art, there is
an abundance of video, digital and computer presentations. One of
the most intriguing, even though the point isn't quite clear, is
Cambridge, Mass.-based Krzysztof Wodi-czko's ``Aegis: Equipment for
a City of Strangers.'' The contraption is a pair of winglike LCD
monitors worn on the shoulders. They show images of the wearer that
talk to each other.
</P>
<P>
   This is also the year of the figure. That's inevitable, what
with the preponderance of photography and video. But even most of
the nonrepresentational objects have figurative references as
opposed to being an investigation of form and color. In the case of
Chakaia Booker's wall relief ``Homage to Thy Mother (Landscape),''
one of the most strikingly beautiful pieces in the show, the
material _ car tires cut and shredded into a variety of shapes _ is
highly symbolic. The New York artist sees many references to
African-Americans in the tires, from their color to their
resilience. In one of many interesting juxtapositions, Booker's
piece is installed across the room from works by Alabama artist
Thornton Dial, who takes a similar approach to materials.
</P>
<P>
   The biennial abounds with inventive treatment of both au courant
themes and venerable genres. Ghada Amer, an Egyptian native living
in New York, makes elegant ``paintings'' by stitching patterns on
canvas that comment on the place of women in Islamic culture.
Atlantan Chris Verene comments on women in this culture in his
photos of men in camera clubs who take soft-porn pictures of
misguided women.
</P>
<P>
   (Both he and fellow Atlantan Kojo Griffin more than hold their
own here. Unfortunately, many of the videos and films, including
those of Atlantans Robin Bernat and Ruth Leitman, weren't
re-viewable during press previews.)
</P>
<P>
   Although the demographics are broader _ both in geography and
generation _ than in the past, don't expect a regional flavor. Most
of the work selected by the six-person curatorial team comes out of
either a more interior source or a larger art world consciousness.
In fact, with 21 artists born outside of the United States, the
biennial exudes an international character. Iranian-born New Yorker
Shirin Neshat has contributed a riveting two-screen video about
Islam and individualism, with a touch of romance. Art may be the
melting pot that America never quite was.
</P>
<P>
   Not every piece is a gem, of course. In some cases, the object
can't carry off the conceptual burden imposed upon it.
Nevertheless, this biennial makes a persuasive and surprisingly
coherent case that contemporary art of all description is thriving.

TRUE-CRIME WRITER INDICTED ON DRUG CHARGES
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service Clients) 
By SUSAN GILL VARDON 
And MIKE LEE 
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   NORTH RICHLAND HILLS, Texas _ True-crime writer Barbara Davis
has been indicted on four felony drug counts in connection with a
Dec. 15 raid by police that left her 25-year-old son dead,
officials said this week.
</P>
<P>
   The charges relate to the designer drug gamma hydroxybutyrate,
or GHB. Davis, 48, of North Richland Hills, a Fort Worth suburb, is
charged with possession of a controlled substance; possession of a
controlled substance with intent to deliver; manufacture of a
controlled substance; and attempted manufacture of a controlled
substance, said Terry Barlow, a Tarrant County assistant district
attorney.
</P>
<P>
   Davis did not return a telephone call seeking comment.
</P>
<P>
   Attorney Tom Carse, who is representing Davis in her
wrongful-death lawsuit against the North Richland Hills Police
Department, said he isn't surprised by the indictment.
</P>
<P>
   ``We look forward to the opportunity of pursuing vigorously our
claims against all potential parties arising out of Troy Davis'
death and vigorously defending Barbara,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   If convicted of one or all of the charges, Davis could serve as
little as two years in prison with a $10,000 fine, or as much as 99
years or life in prison, plus a fine of up to $100,000. The various
counts carry different penalties.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, a grand jury heard cases against Davis and North
Richland Hills police officer Allen Hill, who shot and killed Troy
Davis during the raid. The grand jury determined that there was
insufficient evidence to charge Hill in connection with Troy Davis'
death.
</P>
<P>
   North Richland Hills Police Chief Tom Shockley said on Thursday
that Hill, who has been on paid leave since the shooting, also was
exonerated by an internal investigation and probably will return to
work next week.
</P>
<P>
   Hill was among the tactical team officers who broke through the
Davises' door after getting a tip that they were growing marijuana.
Police have said that Troy Davis was pointing a gun at the officers
when Hill shot him in the chest. The officers used a ``no knock''
warrant, meaning they entered the house without warning.
</P>
<P>
   Police said they found three marijuana plants, enough GHB for
600 doses, and 16 guns _ including a pistol that they said was in
Troy Davis' hand. They said they also found a loaded AR-15 assault
rifle. The guns are legal, and Barbara Davis has said she believed
that GHB was legal.
</P>
<P>
   One of the counts against Davis states that she possessed the
ingredients for making GHB, as well as the recipe.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration outlawed GHB,
which is known as a ``date rape'' drug. It has been illegal in
Texas since 1997.
</P>
<P>
   Barbara Davis is best known for writing ``Precious Angels,''
which portrays Darlie Routier as a coldblooded killer who stabbed
her two young sons to death in 1996 in a Dallas suburb.
</P>
<P>
   Davis made a turnaround during an appearance on the television
talk show ``Leeza,'' declaring that she believes that Routier is
not guilty. Davis also announced plans to write a new book.
</P>
<P>
   Hill will return to work as a motorcycle traffic officer after a
vacation, Shockley said. He will not return to the tactical team in
the foreseeable future, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Shockley said he reviewed the internal investigation report
after the grand jury decision was announced Monday. He said he
determined that Hill had not violated department policy when he
shot Troy Davis.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's been such a tragic event, and it's certainly not what any
of us wanted to happen,'' Shockley said. ``But we've got to go
on.''
</P>
<P>
   Shockley had suspended Hill in June, six months before the
shooting, for exposing himself during a group photograph taken at a
training seminar, police records state.

`BEAUTY' IN THE EYE OF THE BEHOLDER
</HEADLINE>
  (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
(Eds: For use March 26, 2000) 
By BOB STRAUSS 
c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The pre-Oscar gnashing and thrashing has been even more
cacaphonous than usual this year. Laments over who got robbed,
complaints about who's campaigning too lavishly, tortuous formulas
for predicting how the academy is going to vote and why _ there was
endless babble about everything.
</P>
<P>
   Everything except, perhaps, what it might actually mean.
</P>
<P>
   1999 was generally agreed to be one of the finest recent years
of cinema. Consequently, the 72nd Academy Awards' best picture race
has been considered, until very recently, one of the most closely
competitive ever. The five films vying this time around are wildly
different in approach and subject matter, so it is not surprising
they all have their passionate champions _ and, with the possible
exception of one of them, severe critics.
</P>
<P>
   And even though the leading nominee, ``American Beauty,'' has
been looking increasingly likely to win most of the eight races
it's entered in tonight, it's still conceivable that any of the
contenders could still win best picture. There's not the sense of
inevitability that attended the ``Titanic,'' ``The English
Patient,'' ``Forrest Gump'' and ``Schindler's List'' coronations,
nor of the two-picture shootout we got last year between
``Shakespeare in Love'' and ``Saving Private Ryan,'' or when the
1995 competition pitted ``Braveheart'' against ``Apollo 13.''
</P>
<P>
   For all of these reasons, it's too bad that most Oscar
commentary has focused so narrowly on what's going to win. The more
interesting take for this uniquely thoughtful movie year is, what
will the academy's choice say about the Hollywood establishment it
represents: the tastes, the prejudices, the ethics and the
imaginative vision of the people who make most of our movies?
</P>
<P>
   Each of the nominees represents a different, complicated
statement on how the best in American film should be defined. Let's
look at what those qualities are _ and, just for wicked fun on this
day of all overhyped days, let's also acknowledge the complaints
about each film, and to what extent they succeed at overcoming
them.
</P>
<P>
   As the moralists among us delight in mentioning, only an
industry as corrupt as Tinseltown could consider something like
``Beauty'' as its finest achievement. The film essentially starts
with a sad moment of shower masturbation, then quickly and
gleefully pours themes of infidelity, pedophilia, voyeurism,
recreational drug use, professional blackmail and violently
repressed homosexuality right down the sewer after it.
</P>
<P>
   That the film is cleverly written, superbly acted, photographed
with outstanding grace and wonderfully scored is a strong defense
in most people's books, but actually a liability to those who think
it glamorizes the aforementioned vices. But while indulging and
even exploiting its illicit thrills, the movie is really about
transcending unhappiness and discovering genuine personal
fulfillment.
</P>
<P>
   Cheap, false epiphanies are the real sins of too many Hollywood
movies. By recognizing ``American Beauty,'' academy members let
slip that they, like the characters in the film, desperately want
something truer.
</P>
<P>
   Next in line is ``The Cider House Rules,'' a film its creators
probably can't believe has gotten such an easy ride. After all, the
abortion-rights stance of John Irving's 1940s-set, coming-of-age
story couldn't be more offensive to the anti-abortion contingent,
but there's hardly been a peep about the film from the religious
right. Nor, for that matter, has the civil rights community
attacked the film's blithe pathologizing of an African-American
family just to make a key plot decision easier for its white
protagonist.
</P>
<P>
   The lack of protest is due in great part to the movie's
studiously non-confrontational style. It goes out of its way to be
sensitive, nostalgic, forgiving and filled to bursting with
adorable, wide-eyed orphans. ``Cider House'' is in line with a
decades-old Hollywood tradition of presenting divisive, somewhat
muddled liberal beliefs in the safest, most artistically
conservative manner possible. It's the kind of film that makes a
statement while striving not to alienate a single potential
ticket-buyer _ which, whatever you feel about the ethics of it, is
definitely an art in itself.
</P>
<P>
   Much the same can be said for ``The Green Mile,'' which sets its
critique of the death penalty more than half a century in the
buffering past, and in a place and time where its own bizarre,
condescending racial attitudes could conceivably be more
permissable.
</P>
<P>
   But ``Green Mile'' is a Stephen King story, too, and thus a
fantasy. Its serious ideas about injustice, redemption and an
aching eternal punishment that lies somewhere in between are
wrapped in thick religious metaphor. Combine that wihth the film's
lengthy, portentous pace and its starring duo, towering Michael
Clarke Duncan and iconic Tom Hanks, and you've got the kind of
mythmaking effort that earned the industry its Dream Factory
nickname.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Insider'' was the only one of this year's highly praised _
then seriously denounced _ true-life stories to make the final
five, even though it plays as loose with the truth as ``The
Hurricane'' and ``Boys Don't Cry'' were accused of doing. It stands
for all the best and worst aspects of filmmakers' tendency to shape
reality to their needs for dramatic effect.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps the reason Michael Mann's expose of Big Tobacco
malfeasance and the compromise of TV journalism outpaced the others
is its pit bull commitment to chewing over the tough task of acting
honorably in a complicated world. Sure, there were definite good
and bad guys in ``The Insider,'' but there were more imperfect
mortals whose agendas and loyalties did not easily distill into
standard Hollywood rights and wrongs. That could well be why this
movie never found a wide audience; but by honoring complexities of
circumstance and motive, ``The Insider'' expanded the scope of the
true expose movie, and brought at least some new elements of truth
to the prestigious and often pompous genre.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, there's the one that everyone likes, ``The Sixth
Sense.'' It's the only nominee that's not about anything real
(which, let's face it, is the kind of thing studios are most
comfortable and most often successful with); just a perfectly
wrought ghost story with an exquisitely engineered surprise ending.
</P>
<P>
   Although worlds away in style from such fellow box-office
blockbusters as ``Star Wars: Episode 1 _ The Phantom Menace'' and
``The Matrix,'' ``Sixth Sense'' nevertheless represents the same
kind of pure escapism into an imaginary universe. The drab, mundane
world the movie's clairvoyant kid lives in even seems specially
shot to look like Hollywood's idea of the average moviegoer's
existence. Haley Joel Osment's awe and emotional response to the
fantastic things he sees parallel an audiences' reaction to being
manipulated by entertainment craftspeople who, more and more in
recent years, like to be thought of as wizards.
</P>
<P>
   So which one's going to win tonight? That's all we care about,
right, along with what everybody's wearing. But we can, as the ad
line says, look closer. The big choice will tell us a lot about how
the industry feels its skills at spinning surface illusions should
be employed in the new century. Will it boldly illuminate deeper
truths or entertainingly distract us from life's tougher
realities? &QL;

JUDGE RESCINDS FINE IN RAILROAD DEATH TRIAL, RECUSES SELF
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service Clients) 
By LINDA P. CAMPBELL 
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   FORT WORTH, Texas _ The judge who fined Burlington Northern
Santa Fe Corp. $10 million for presenting what he called ``false,
concocted'' evidence in a wrongful death trial has thrown out the
penalty and removed himself from the case.
</P>
<P>
   State District Judge Bob McGrath said his sanctions were
premature because they were announced without a hearing.
</P>
<P>
   McGrath imposed the fine and declared a mistrial last week after
concluding that the Fort Worth-based railroad misrepresented a
distance signal that was shown to the jury. He made the ruling as
the trial entered its third week.
</P>
<P>
   The family of BNSF engineer Randy Mann sued the railroad after
he died in the February 1993 collision of two trains in Enid, Okla.
Mann's family contends that he drove through a broken signal on a
foggy night, leading to the fatal collision.
</P>
<P>
   The railroad says the broken signal was too far from the
intersection to have caused the wreck.
</P>
<P>
   McGrath also ordered the railroad to pay $210,000 for the
plaintiffs' court costs and attorney fees and fined railroad
attorney Doug Poole $10,000 for saying that the company did nothing
wrong.
</P>
<P>
   The judge then ordered the distance signal transferred to the
Tarrant County district attorney's office for investigation of the
possibility of criminal charges. Intentionally tampering with or
fabricating physical evidence is a crime.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday's order, however, canceled the referral as well as
disciplinary action against attorneys.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are pleased with the order and the setting aside of
sanctions,'' railroad spokesman Richard Russack said.
</P>
<P>
   Art Brender, attorney for Mann's family, said he won't give up.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not going to let the railroad off the hook,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   In a written statement, the plaintiffs said they were ``shocked
and disappointed that Judge McGrath, without a hearing, reversed
his decision. ... They (family members) just don't understand how
this could happen, given what the railroad did in court.''
</P>
<P>
   The case was not immediately reassigned. It was not immediately
clear when a new trial will begin.
</P>
<P>
   Joe Spurlock II, a professor at the Texas Wesleyan School of Law
who is not involved in the case, said McGrath's decision to set
aside the fine is not uncommon.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not that unusual for judges to have second thoughts,''
said Spurlock, a former trial and appellate judge.
</P>
<P>
   He said a new judge could hold a hearing on sanctions.
</P>
<P>
   The disputed evidence is a dark wooden post with a metal signal
box attached near the top.
</P>
<P>
   In imposing the fine, McGrath said that the exhibit the railroad
presented in court was not typical of the original signal, that the
company put it together from separate pieces without telling the
court and that a company official wiped a shiny surface clean
before the jury saw the evidence.
</P>
<P>
   The railroad maintains that it neither fabricated nor tampered
with evidence.
</P>
<P>
   The $10 million was to have been split evenly between Mann's
family and the Texas Center for Legal Ethics.

SCHOLAR STRESSES COOPERATIVE ASPECT OF BALKANS' HISTORY 
</HEADLINE>
 (mk) 
 By LYNDA RICHARDSON   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Karen Barkey is far from alone among scholars in
trying to untangle the Balkans' tumultuous past and present.
Shelfloads of books and articles have been written on the region's
ancient ethnic and religious hatreds as well as on the modern
machinations of today's leaders.
</P>
<P>
   But Barkey, a sociologist at Columbia University, argues that
the region's history is much more cooperative than many of the
current explanations suggest.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody talks about the Balkans as a powder keg, the Balkans
and ethnic nationalism and ethnic cleansing,'' she said, ``but
there is a lot that is nonethnic and much more interesting, such as
the traders, the way in which society ordered itself, even with
religion and the courts.''
</P>
<P>
   Barkey is of Turkish-Jewish origin, a native of Istanbul,
Turkey, and is now at work on a book about the historical roots of
the Balkan conflict. She believes it is crucial to rethink the
structure of the Ottoman Empire in the 18th century, a pivotal
period in the region's history.
</P>
<P>
   Until the 18th century, Barkey said, the Ottomans had developed
a vertically organized society in which every level looked to the
state. If conflicts arose, for instance, the peasants, traders or
local officials involved would confer with the person above them,
following a chain of command that ultimately led to Constantinople.
</P>
<P>
   But in the 18th century, Barkey argues, those vertical lines of
association began to fracture because of a reorganization of the
empire's system of rule and taxation, which transformed the way in
which people did business. People started turning to other members
of the same group or class to resolve disputes. Neighbors sorted
out problems with neighbors. Civic associations formed. Traders
dealt with their difficulties through a proliferation of trade
associations and networks.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was an unbelievable mixing of people, the creating of
low-level, autonomous, free associations,'' Barkey said. ``People
started creating slowly a civil society in the 18th century that
was kind of removed from the state.''
</P>
<P>
   She believes that if these groups of traders, merchants and
multireligious networks had become more powerful, a more diverse
Balkans would have been the outcome.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, Barkey said, although more tolerance developed, it did
not lead to greater civic cooperation. War with the Hapsburg and
Russian empires along with ideas of self-determination that were
imported from Western Europe produced a fractious legacy. When the
Ottoman Empire broke up after World War I, a number of insecure
nations like Serbia, Greece and Romania, and then Bulgaria and
Albania, were created. They went on to fight for territory among
themselves, which in turn led to further divisions and warfare.
</P>
<P>
   ``All these groups that were so interethnic and understood each
other and their differences,'' she said, ``they became the losers
in many ways. Understanding didn't win out. What wins out is the
war, the warriors, the warlords emerge and that kind of defines the
Balkans.''
</P>
<P>
   Barkey takes issue with policy analysts and historians who, she
believes, focus too much on nationalism.
</P>
<P>
   ``Part of my work is to show that the Balkans cooperated and
lived together and produced social capital for a long time. We have
to emphasize that as well as understand the conditions in which
they became antagonistic to each other.''

CHURCH SELLING 2,200 E. TEXAS ACRES AT FORMER AMBASSADOR
UNIVERSITY
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service Clients) 
By BILL HANNA 
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   If the multimillion-dollar auction doesn't work out, maybe
Ambassador University can be offered as an ultra-extravagant gift
in the Neiman Marcus Christmas catalog.
</P>
<P>
   On April 4, the Worldwide Church of God will seek a Texas-size
bid for the Texas-size property _ a leafy, 2,200-acre former
university campus that includes a golf course, landing strip, radio
station and 46-acre lake.
</P>
<P>
   Now a shuttered ghost town, Ambassador University closed in 1997
after 33 tumultuous years. The campus is fenced off from
surrounding property, and visitors can walk undisturbed for hours
through its buildings and pine trees.
</P>
<P>
   Located in the East Texas Piney Woods three miles outside Big
Sandy, which lies north of Tyler and has a population of 1,258, the
campus comes stocked with such diverse things as farming equipment
and five Steinway pianos.
</P>
<P>
   The property will be sold off in 17 parcels, with the developed
campus of 698 acres sold as one of the auction lots. Some of the
other parcels are small enough to be developed as ranchettes.
Bidding is expected to take five days for all 10,000 items to sell.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's incredible diversity, first-class educational
buildings, two lakes, a golf course, an airstrip and first-class
library with rare books,'' said Bernard Schnippert, chief financial
officer of the Worldwide Church of God. ``I don't know many
colleges that have those things plus beautiful scenery. While
you're on the campus you could be anywhere in the world; the
scenery is very diverse. The views are incredible.''
</P>
<P>
   The campus was one of the centerpieces of the Worldwide Church,
founded by the radio and TV evangelist Herbert W. Armstrong.
</P>
<P>
   Since his death in 1986, the denomination has lost more than
half its 150,000 members. Armstrong's successors, Joseph Tkach; and
his successor's son, Joseph Tkach Jr., moved the church from its
fringe apocalyptic beliefs to those more in line with mainstream
evangelical denominations.
</P>
<P>
   But many members couldn't stomach the radical change and bolted.
They clung to original Worldwide beliefs that it was the only
Christian church and that the Holy Trinity is a pagan doctrine.
</P>

   Ambassador College, later a university, was where believers
could safely send their children for higher education so they
wouldn't have to mix with youths of other religious backgrounds,
alumni said. It expanded to 1,100 in the early 1990s after the
closing of an affiliated California college of the same name.
</P>
<P>
   Classes were coed, but there was little tolerance for typical
campus hijinks.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was somewhat like a military situation, like a military
school,'' said Dixon Cartwright, a 1969 Ambassador graduate and
faculty member in the early '90s. ``There were curfews, there were
rules about relationships between the sexes and dating. You
couldn't get physical. But most who went there didn't have a
problem with that.''
</P>
<P>
   Ambassador had a sister campus in Pasadena, Calif., which closed
as a college in 1990 but has served as the church's headquarters.
It is under contract to be sold. Millions had been poured into the
two campuses as showpieces of Armstrong's empire.
</P>
<P>
   The church's influence went far beyond its relatively small
membership through its magazine, ``The Plain Truth.'' Then there
was its ``The World Tomorrow'' radio and TV broadcasts, which
featured Armstrong's son, Garner Ted Armstrong, before he left the
church in 1978.
</P>
<P>
   ``This group is now solidly within the heart of
neo-evangelism,'' said Mark Toulouse, dean of Texas Christian
University's Brite Divinity School and a professor of American
religious history. ``Whether they can define a place within that
culture remains an open question. I would not be optimistic.''
</P>
<P>
   Ambassador's stormy past remains an emotional issue for many
former students and faculty.
</P>
<P>
   For those who have remained in the downsized church, a sprawling
college campus is just no longer required.
</P>
<P>
   ``We need to maximize its value,'' Schnippert said. ``We would
love to see someone use the property consistent with its heritage
and make sure in some way it benefits the public.''
</P>
<P>
   But for those who still adhere to Armstrong's original
teachings, the auction is seen as severing the last connection to
their former church.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's almost like it's an effort to take away any memory of the
old Worldwide Church of God,'' said Big Sandy Mayor David P. Smith,
a 1977 Ambassador graduate who has left the fold. But Smith said
the church has a ``a real financial need for the money the sale
will generate.''
</P>
<P>
   Anger over the sale has led to at least one attempt to sabotage
the auction.
</P>
<P>
   Faxes ostensibly urging East Texas businesses to bid on the
property demanded a $500 ``donation'' for a pre-auction tour while
threatening to blacklist any company that didn't cough up the
offering. Church leaders denounced the faxes as a hoax.
</P>
<P>
   There's still a chance the auction could be pre-empted by a
last-minute sale of the entire property, church leaders said.
</P>
<P>
   Discussions are continuing with several groups, they said. One
group is said to want to establish an all-male military school
based on traditions of the Citadel, which now admits women. Other
religious schools have also expressed interest.

PAKISTANIS ANXIOUSLY AWAIT CLINTON'S ARRIVAL 
</HEADLINE>
  (See also CLINTON-INDIA, INDIA-TB) 
(js) 
 By BARRY BEARAK   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ISLAMABAD, Pakistan _ High anxiety has replaced great
expectations in this capital, with people anticipating that
President Clinton will arrive on Saturday not just to say hello but
also to deliver a scolding.
</P>
<P>
   This is to be Clinton's final stop on a long-awaited visit to
southern Asia. For months Pakistan's military rulers, who took
power without violence in a coup on Oct. 12, feared that Clinton
would shun them entirely, as their rivals in New Delhi had wanted.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, after five friendly days of talking, toasting and
sightseeing in India, Clinton will now make a meager five-hour stop
here, enough time to meet with Pakistan's chief executive, Gen.
Pervez Musharraf, and to address the nation on television.
</P>
<P>
   Given some of what Clinton has been saying in India, Pakistanis
may prefer that he had gone straight home. ``Reality is finally
sinking in that this is the 21st century, the New World Order, and
that nations with strong economies will get America's attention,
and that does not include Pakistan,'' said Rifaat Hussain, a
professor of international studies at Quaid-i-Azam University in
Islamabad.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, the difference in Washington's perceptions of India and
Pakistan seems to be the difference between a potential market and
a potential disaster.
</P>
<P>
   India, a resolute democracy, is home to a booming software
industry and a rapidly multiplying middle class. Pakistan, with
democracy delayed, is nearly bankrupt, relying on a steady
intravenous drip of restructured loans from international lenders.
Social upheaval appears an increasing possibility, with poverty and
corruption pushing even more people toward Islamic fundamentalism.
</P>
<P>
   On Friday, the president's national security adviser, Sandy
Berger, said Clinton would carry a message of hard realities,
telling Musharraf that Pakistan was ``a country in trouble'' and
that a nuclear-arms race with India would be a ruinous folly.
</P>
<P>
   In May 1998, India and Pakistan exploded tit-for-tat tests of
nuclear weapons, with New Delhi the first to hit the button. Last
summer, the countries squared off in fierce battles in the
mountains of Kashmir, the territory that the two have fought over
since they emerged from the British Empire in 1947.
</P>
<P>
   As neighbors, India and Pakistan share more than a common
boundary. They can watch each other's television stations. And this
past week, Pakistanis scornfully viewed what seemed a love fest
between their Indian enemies and America's president.
</P>
<P>
   There was a sliding succession of indelible imagery. Clinton was
cheered wildly in India's parliament. He danced to folk music with
the woman of a Rajasthani village, and he reveled at the sight of
tigers in the wild.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a personal and national victory for the Indians,'' said
Najam Sethi, editor of a weekly newspaper, The Friday Times.
``There's only one superpower in the world, and that superpower has
come to them. When we see the Indian TV screen, we see such fawning
over Clinton: `Here, look, this is where Clinton sat!' And, `Here,
this is the kind of soup he ate!'''
</P>
<P>
   Worse yet, the president appeared to be tilting toward India's
side on Kashmir. In a widely quoted interview with ABC News,
Clinton said, ``I believe there are those within the Pakistani
government that have supported those who engage in violence in
Kashmir.''
</P>
<P>
   To many here that seemed an endorsement of one of New Delhi's
most constant accusations, that Pakistan has complete command over
groups of Islamic militants that are creating bloody havoc in
Indian-controlled Kashmir. The Pakistanis, to the contrary,
routinely claim to supply only moral and political support to the
``holy warriors.''
</P>
<P>
   Musharraf had some reason to hope that Clinton would say
something quite different. Recently, the president had called the
subcontinent ``the most dangerous place in the world today,'' a
nervous observation that might well have preceded a U.S. move to
involve itself in a coaxed settlement, something that Pakistan
wants and India does not.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, while Clinton did urge India to negotiate with
Pakistan, he said emphatically, ``I have certainly not come to
south Asia to mediate the dispute over Kashmir.'' And the president
made no mention of well-documented human-rights violations by
India's extensive army and paramilitary presence in Kashmir.
</P>
<P>
   ``It needs to be accepted that Washington's old policy of
friendship with Pakistan is no more,'' wrote a columnist for a
Pakistani daily, The News.
</P>
<P>
   Often, America had employed Pakistan as reliable helpmate in the
Cold War. After the Soviet Union invaded Afghanistan in 1979,
Islamabad was used as the conduit for billions of dollars in
military aid to the mujahadeen resistance.
</P>
<P>
   Today, some of those same warriors have shifted the focus of
their jihad to India and America. Among them is Osama bin Laden,
whom the United States considers responsible for bombing two of its
embassies in 1998.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   bin Laden's name will surely come up in Clinton and Musharraf's
talks on Saturday. The accused terrorist is believed to be living
in Afghanistan, where the ruling Taliban militia is his host.
Washington has been disappointed in Pakistan's reluctance to use
its influence with the Taliban to press for bin Laden's expulsion
or arrest.
</P>
<P>
   Another certain item on the president's agenda will be a
timetable for Pakistan's return to democracy. On Thursday,
Musharraf announced that three rounds of local elections would be
held from December to July 2001. But he gave no indication of when
a full restoration of civilian government would occur _ and
Washington immediately expressed dismay.
</P>
<P>
   The general has chosen to display optimism about his meeting the
president. The two men may well hit it off. If Clinton can come
across as a hail fellow well met, so can Musharraf, a person with
an easy manner around Westerners. His brother is a doctor in
Chicago. His only son is an actuary in Boston for the state of
Massachusetts.
</P>
<P>
   But the two leaders are scheduled to meet one-on-one for only 40
minutes, a brief time that could be taken up simply defining what
each means by troublesome terminology like ``terrorism'' and
``democracy.''
</P>
<P>
   Musharraf, however, has expressed confidence that when Clinton
meets him in person he will find a trustworthy, altruistic soldier
_ and not an enemy of freedom.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have to tell President Clinton our point of view,'' the
general said. ``I am confident that I will be able to convince
him.''

<P>
   Dear Dr. Bombay: The small lettering on my Web pages displayed
with Internet Explorer is very hard to read. The same pages with
Netscape are easy to read. I noticed with Netscape that you can
adjust the lettering size, but no size is listed with Internet
Explorer. _ Going Blind
</P>
<P>
   Dear Going: Either you've got an ancient version of IE or you're
just not looking in the right place. I'm guessing your browser is
showing its age.
</P>
<P>
   Now, that's OK with some kinds of software. I've used the same
word-processing program for 17 years because all I need it to do is
save my work as a simple text file, and it does that nicely without
trying to rearrange my paragraphs or criticize my spelling and
grammar. After all, that's what copy editors are for. Yes, I
purposely ended that sentence with a preposition.
</P>
<P>
   Browser technology and Web design, on the other hand, change
daily. As soon as some new feature is included in a browser, you
can bet 10 million Poindexters are staying up late at night, trying
to take advantage of it on their sites. And, if your browser lacks
the capability to display the newest stuff, you're never going to
be treated to all those dancing, singing hamsters or whatever it is
some nerd thought would be totally cool.
</P>
<P>
   There's an added incentive to upgrading IE: Microsoft includes
improvements to the Windows operating system with each release of
Explorer. Nobody's forcing you to use IE _ at least, Bill Gates
hasn't worked out a totally reliable way to do that yet _ but you
miss out on some nifty stuff like easier-to-use dial-up networking
if you never upgrade. Don't worry. You can still use Netscape.
Nobody will tell Bill.
</P>
<P>
   Once you've installed IE 5.01, go to the View menu and select
Text Size, where you'll have five font sizes to choose from. If
you've got a mouse that has that little wheel between the two
buttons, you can hold down the Control key and roll it up or down
to change text size. Let's see Netscape do that.
</P>
<P>
   And one other thing: Stop using the default text size when you
design a Web page. It's too small for us old-timers to read. Have
some pity and throw a plus-1 or plus-2 into your FONT commands.
That ratchets the viewing size up.
</P>
<P>
   Dear Dr. Bombay: Many greetings. I am from Greece, and I want to
start hacking. I want you to tell me how it could be. _ Wannabe
</P>
<P>
   Dear Wannabe: I've always said there aren't enough hackers in
the world. First, abandon all personal hygiene. Drop all interests
but computing. Don't even try to interact with other people, or you
won't be able to let your sense of values warp beyond all
recognition. Now, develop an unreasonable hatred for society.
Remember: It's not your fault you're a total loser with no friends,
marketable skills or future. Those multinational corporations and
government agencies are the ones to blame. Target them with the
only weapon you have in your pitiful arsenal: not your vote, not
your ideas, not your faith, not your inspiration, but your childish
belief that jamming somebody's Web page for a couple of hours will
make the world finally recognize how truly awesome you are. Trust
me: We'll all be really impressed. Oh, and you should have a really
cool nickname, too. Your cellmate will like that.
</P>

 &HT;    In Mideast, pope has work cut out for him
 &HT;    By Steve Gushee
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Roman Catholic Christianity came to the Holy Land following
crusaders carrying swords. That was 800 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   This week, Pope John Paul II visits that sacred soil carrying an
olive branch. He wants to reconcile Jews and Christians, Muslims
and Christians and make peace among various Christian communities
there.
</P>
<P>
   That is a task worthy of the Vicar of Christ and fraught with
difficulty.
</P>
<P>
   In the Holy Land, the past is present in ways most Americans
cannot understand. Age-old scars are fresh wounds. Righting the
perceived wrongs of centuries drives much contemporary
decision-making.
</P>
<P>
   For many Palestinians, the 12th-century crusades to free the
Holy Land of Muslim control are as fresh as last week's news.
</P>
<P>
   Muslim-Christian conversation beyond mere platitudes will be a
major victory for the pope, whose predecessors enthusiastically
supported the marauding crusaders.
</P>
<P>
   But his toughest challenge may be reconciling warring factions
of Christians. Six different Christian communities share
responsibility for the Church of the Holy Sepulcher, which marks
the likely place of Jesus' crucifixion in Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
   Latin Catholics _ as the Roman Catholic Church is known in the
Middle East _ Greek Orthodox, Armenian, Syrian, Egyptian Copt and
Ethiopian Christians eye one another suspiciously _ and have for
centuries.
</P>
<P>
   Latin Christianity is a relative newcomer. The church had little
significant presence in the Holy Land until the 12th century.
</P>
<P>
   Then, the church ran into Orthodox churches that had been there
since the first century and moved in on them.
</P>
<P>
   The Latin Church built its own shrines cheek by jowl with those
of the Orthodox community. A Roman Catholic chapel stands next to
the central Greek Orthodox sanctuary in the Church of the Holy
Sepulcher. Another flanks the Orthodox chapel at the traditional
site of the Crucifixion in a different part of the building. The
19th-century Latin Church of St. Catherine stands immediately next
to the sixth-century Orthodox Church of the Nativity in Bethlehem.
</P>
<P>
   Such redundancy is a sign, in stone, of the difficulty of
finding significant common ground with other Christians in the Holy
Land.
</P>
<P>
   And the pope's hope to ease Jewish-Christian tensions is equally
difficult.
</P>
<P>
   Charges of Christian complicity in the Holocaust frame his visit
to Israelis. They want an apology. But things are never that simple
for the church.
</P>
<P>
   Another Holy Land church is an unlikely symbol of that problem.
The Church of the Beatitudes near the Sea of Galilee marks the
traditional site of Jesus' Sermon on the Mount. The pope is
scheduled to offer Mass nearby today. The building, an Italianate
jewel of beauty and tranquility, was built in 1938 by Mussolini. He
was a partner with Hitler in the atrocities of World War II.
</P>
<P>
   Such is the complex web of history and faith in the Holy Land.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the pope is in a place where miracles happen.

 &HT;    Rapport with boss affects women's job stress level
 &HT;    By Tammy Joyner
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ A new study confirms what many career-minded mothers
already know: Women with families pay a heavy price at home for
having a good working relationship with the boss.
</P>
<P>
   The plum assignments, carte-blanche flexibility and open-door
access to your supervisor often have trade-offs in the form of late
nights in the office and weekend homework, and that cuts into
family time, says Debra Major, co-author of the Old Dominion
University study. Major is an associate professor of psychology at
Old Dominion in Norfolk, Va.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have mutually high expectations for one another,'' Major
said. ``You expect your boss to go to bat for you and to give you
high-profile assignments. In return, your boss expects you to be
available and do what it takes to get ahead, and sometimes those
things spill over into your family time.''
</P>
<P>
   While managers often believe they treat their workers equitably,
many acknowledge that they give flexibility and promotions to those
with whom they've forged personal and professional alliances, Major
said.
</P>
<P>
   The study polled 206 women in a variety of jobs _ from
secretaries to teachers to doctors _ in the Hampton Roads area of
Virginia. Major said she was surprised by the findings because she
and colleague Karyn H. Bernas, a doctoral student at the
university, expected to find that women had less problems with
on-the-job stress if they had good a relationship with their boss.
</P>
<P>
   ``What it says is that there are trade-offs,'' Major said.
</P>
<P>
   On the plus side, those career women are ``in a better position
to negotiate how the work gets done'' as opposed to women who are
on the ``mommy track'' _ a term used to describe working mothers
whose careers have been derailed because they have families _ or
scrutinized closely when they ask for time off to attend their
child's school play, for instance.
</P>
<P>
   Workplace expert Connie Glaser called the study's finding
``quite interesting. But I wouldn't trade having a good boss for
any other kind of compensation on the job.''
</P>
<P>
   Glaser is the author of ``When Money Isn't Enough,'' due out in
paperback April 1, about women who are redefining what it means to
be successful.
</P>
<P>
   ``It seems a small price to pay because there's a greater price
to pay for working for a boss you don't get along with. That's
going to undermine your self-esteem, and that's going to really
play out at home,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   The study also found that women with hearty personalities _
those who view challenges as opportunities and believe their
actions and behavior determined what happens in their lives _ fare
better on the job. Not surprisingly, too, women who had the
emotional support of their families did better at work and at home.

SNOWCOUNT (Phoenix) - Arizona is encouraging snowbirds to list
Arizona as their home for the census. While Arizona's elders are
only considered 14 percent of the population, the same as the
national average, the number would grow to about 19 percent if all
the snowbirds were counted. That would mean more federal money for
services, and more congressional representation. But there's
competition. States like Minnesota know about the effort in Sunbelt
states like Arizona and Florida and are encouraging their snowbirds
who flock South to fill out census forms up North. By MAUREEN WEST.
Story will move in the `A` category. &QL;

GASPRICES (Phoenix) - Valley drivers chalk up among the highest
miles in the nation, consuming a disproportionate amount of fuel.
So when gas prices rise, they are affected more that most.The
Arizona Republic checks to see how the recent spike in gas prices
is changing, or not changing, commuters' behaviors. By MARY JO
PITZL. Story will move in the `A` category. &QL;

 &HT;    MICROSOFT CASE FACES WEEKEND CRUNCH AS RULING LOOMS
 &HT;    Moving in (w) Washington and (f) financial categories.
 &HT;    By ANDREW J. GLASS
 &HT;    c.2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ For Microsoft Corp. and government antitrust
lawyers, the moment of truth arrived Friday.
</P>
<P>
   The software giant put a last-minute settlement offer on the
table after U.S. District Judge Thomas Penfield Jackson reportedly
warned that he has written a verdict in the landmark case and plans
to issue it Tuesday unless the two sides report substantial
progress toward a full settlement.
</P>
<P>
   Most observers believe Jackson almost certainly would find
Microsoft guilty of flouting the nation's antitrust laws.
</P>
<P>
   If an eleventh-hour deal struck, it is likely to be crafted by
Judge Richard Posner of the U.S. 7th Circuit Court of Appeals in
Chicago, whom Jackson enlisted last November as a mediator in the
case.
</P>
<P>
   Both sides are prepared to go to Chicago this weekend to review
such a deal with Posner, but no talks were scheduled by Friday
evening. Neither Microsoft nor the Justice Department would
comment.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft's last-minute offer would put a variety of
restrictions on its future business conduct.
</P>
<P>
   The company would agree to abide by uniform licensing of its
flagship Windows operating system for all comers. That means all
personal computer makers would pay the same price for the software,
with no further volume discounts for such long-time partners as
Compaq and Dell Computer.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft has also offered to open up its proprietary Windows
source code so that other software firms will face no disadvantage
in writing their own ``hooks'' into the operating system for
applications that might compete with Microsoft's.
</P>
<P>
   It remains to be seen, however, whether this conduct-based
remedy will satisfy the Justice Department and the 19 state
attorneys general who have so far successfully prosecuted the case
in Jackson's courtroom.
</P>
<P>
   Even if Washington agrees to a deal that imposes sweeping
restrictions on Microsoft's business practices, it is by no means a
sure bet that the attorney generals in such key states as Iowa, New
York, and Connecticut will go along with the deal.
</P>
<P>
   The attorneys general in Florida, Ohio, Maryland and Kansas are
no longer pressing for a structural remedy that would break up
Microsoft.
</P>
<P>
   But the hard-line faction is holding out for splitting Microsoft
into at least two separate units. One would market Windows, and the
other applications such as Microsoft Word.
</P>
<P>
   Both sides have strong incentive to settle.
</P>
<P>
   In cutting a deal, Microsoft would avoid the risk of Jackson
ordering a breakup at a later stage in the trial.
</P>
<P>
   Besides the trauma of forced breakup or a protracted appeals
process, devastating ``findings of fact'' already issued by Jackson
could be used in 108 class-action suits currently pending against
Microsoft. If the case is settled, those findings recede in legal
value for other litigation.
</P>
<P>
   The government, on the other hand, would avoid a lengthy legal
appeals by Microsoft. The Justice Department also faces the risk
that if a Republican president is elected this November, it would
take a radically different approach and refuse to press an appeal.
Gov. George W. Bush of Texas, the presumed Republican presidential
nominee, is on record as opposing a breakup of the company.
</P>
<P>
   Yet it may prove difficult to find common ground, despite the
mounting pressures to do so.
</P>
<P>
   University of Baltimore law professor Bob Lande, who has
followed the case closely, noted that Microsoft will not settle
unless it is allowed to accept a ``nonstructural'' remedy that
keeps it intact.
</P>
<P>
   Justice Department antitrust chief Joel Klein told Congress on
Wednesday that the remedy ``ought to be commensurate'' with
Microsoft's practices, which Jackson has already ruled to be
monopolistic and harmful to consumers.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't see how the Justice Department can accept a
nonstructural remedy,'' Lande said. ``I don't see how Microsoft can
accept a structural remedy. Posner's task is to try to split the
baby in the middle.''
</P>
<P>
   Shares of Microsoft, which touched 115 earlier Friday, fell 3/16
to 111 11/16 in late Nasdaq trading. The stock gained 8.4 percent
Thursday following widespread reports of renewed settlement
prospects.

   LAREDO, Texas _ The State Department said Friday that a Rwandan
clergyman who spent nearly three years in a Laredo jail was
extradited to Africa to face genocide charges before a United
Nations tribunal.
</P>
<P>
   Elizaphan Ntakirutimana, a former Seventh-day Adventist pastor,
is the first person arrested on American soil to face such a trial,
said Don DeGabrielle, an assistant U.S. attorney. Other
extraditions from the United States have returned the accused to a
nation, not an international court.
</P>
<P>
   The International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda is being held in
Arusha, Tanzania, an African nation on the Indiana Ocean that
borders Rwanda.
</P>
<P>
   The tribunal has accused Ntakirutimana of leading attackers
armed with machetes, grenades and guns in a murderous April 1994
rampage that killed dozens of people who were hiding in his church.
</P>
<P>
   At the time, Rwanda was in the throes of a bloody feud between
the country's dominant ethnic groups, the Hutus and Tutsis, strife
that killed an estimated 500,000 and sent 2 million refugees
fleeing to neighboring nations. Most of those killed, including
those in Ntakirutimana's church, were Tutsis. Ntakirutimana is a
Hutu.
</P>
<P>
   ``You are all condemned to die! It is all over for you!'' the
pastor said, according to a witness who later hid among the
corpses.
</P>
<P>
   Neither Ntakirutimana's lawyer nor his son, a physician who
practices in Laredo, could be reached for comment Friday.
</P>
<P>
   The elderly man's lawyer, former U.S. Attorney General Ramsey
Clark, has said that his client would not receive a fair trial
because Rwandans questioned by Ntakirutimana's counsel could face
violent reprisals.
</P>
<P>
   Clark has maintained that his client is being unjustly accused
as a result of tribal hatred.
</P>
<P>
   DeGabrielle said U.S. Marshals and a physician flew with
Ntakirutimana from Laredo to Houston Thursday morning. From there
he was to continue to Amsterdam and then to Tanzania.
Ntakirutimana's age has been given variously as 73 to 75.
</P>
<P>
   State Department officials were not certain how soon he would
stand trial.
</P>
<P>
   Three weeks ago, Secretary of State Madeleine Albright signed a
warrant authorizing Ntakirutimana to be extradited, following four
years of legal appeals that led all the way to the U.S. Supreme
Court. In January, the high court declined to hear his appeal.
</P>
<P>
   The former minister was first arrested in September 1996 after
legally emigrating here with his wife to live with their son. He
has been in and out of jail in Laredo since.
</P>
<P>
   The trials in Arusha are only the third such international
forum. Others include the ongoing tribunal at The Hague,
Netherlands, addressing allegations of genocide in the former
Yugoslavia, and the trials against Nazi criminals in Nuremberg,
Germany, following World War II.

   NATIONAL FORECAST &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Pockets of moderate rain will develop across the Gulf States on
Saturday as a slow cold front combines with a compact jet-stream
disturbance to lift moist air from the Gulf of Mexico. These
patchwork rains, some with thunder, will stay mostly in a corridor
from North Texas across the lower Mississippi Valley to the
southern Appalachians.
</P>
<P>
   A narrow, broken line of generally light showers will accompany
the northern end of the cold front quickly across the eastern Great
Lakes and into western New England later in the day.
</P>
<P>
   In the wake of the front, cool winds from the northwest
averaging 15 to 30 mph will prevail across the upper Mississippi
Valley. Gusts to 40 mph are possible in spots. Rain showers will
dampen parts of the northwest Great Lakes, with snow showers near
the Minnesota-Canadian border.
</P>
<P>
   Focus: Daring Rescue
</P>
<P>
   Canadian helicopter pilots plucked sailors from the turbulent
Atlantic on Friday after their ship sank on Thursday about 400
miles northeast of Bermuda. Seas up to 12 feet high hindered rescue
efforts. Protracted winds associated with a sluggish low-pressure
system over the middle Atlantic persistently blew over a long
stretch of water, causing increasingly rough seas. The low was
orphaned by the steering winds of the jet stream, which were
rerouted far to the north by a blocking high-pressure system off
Northern Europe.

 &HT;    Bush invades Clinton territory
 &HT;    By Ken Herman
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   White House wannabe George W. Bush on Friday took his campaign
to Little Rock, a southern capital that might be able to give
Austinites a glimpse of what happens when an ex-resident becomes
president.
</P>
<P>
   The verdict: A Bush presidency would not mean we're all going to
be federal judges or ambassadors. It would not mean a quick,
federally-funded fix to our traffic woes. And it probably won't
mean a second presidential library.
</P>
<P>
   In Little Rock, the experience has been predictable. Folks who
liked Gov. Bill Clinton think President Bill Clinton has been good
for Little Rock. Folks who thought Gov. Bill Clinton was Slick
Willie are glad he is becoming a New Yorker.
</P>
<P>
   The empirical data are not quite as polarized. Little Rock
business leaders say the economy is humming along nicely, but they
think it's part of the national uptick. Arkansas gets healthy doses
of federal aid, but it always has.
</P>
<P>
   As for hard-core evidence that the city has produced a
president, so far there's not much, short of indictments and
subpoenas.
</P>
<P>
   In Austin, seven months prior to the election, it's tough to
gauge how a Bush presidency might affect the city. But experts say
it will, and part of the story could be what, or who, we would
lose. ``If (Bush) becomes president it will really impact this
city,'' said Herb Berkowitz of the Washington-based Heritage
Foundation, which has studied presidential transitions. ``I would
suspect that hundreds of your neighbors would move to a place
called Washington D.C.''
</P>
<P>
   When asked about potential impact on Austin, Bush is quick to
remind that he's not really from these parts. Though he's lived in
public housing here since January 1995, Bush says he's not the
Austinite that Lyndon B. Johnson.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was really more identified with Austin than I have been. He
was raised in this part (of the state). I was raised out in
Midland,'' said Bush.
</P>
<P>
   But he is convinced that Austin, and Texas, would benefit if he
leaves town.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it would have a positive effect,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Austin Mayor Kirk Watson, a good Democrat, does not want Bush to
become president. But the mayor can see the upside to it.
</P>
<P>
   ``The advantage would be that he is familiar with Austin,'' said
Watson. ``He is familiar with what we need and you would hope that
because of that familiarity he would be in a position to help us.''
</P>
<P>
   Mark Hazelwood, president and chief executive officer of the
Greater Austin Chamber of Commerce, said a Bush presidency would
produce ``natural interest in where the president comes from, and
the president is going to be returning here periodically.''
</P>
<P>
   The question, however, is where ``here'' will be. The Texas
White House probably would be the 1,600-acre ranch Bush recently
purchased near Crawford, west of Waco.
</P>
<P>
   ``Should I win,'' said Bush, ``I anticipate spending time here
with Laura and my family at our place up in Central Texas.''
</P>
<P>
   For the national press corps, that would mean quality time in
the festive Waco area, much like the press corps of the 1960s
bivouacked in the Hill County during Johnson's frequent trips to
his ranch.
</P>
<P>
   ``They didn't think much of hanging around Johnson City, but
they learned how to buy barbecue and beef jerky,'' said George
Christian, who was Johnson's press secretary. ``They loved it, for
awhile. They thought it was real wild west stuff.''
</P>
<P>
   Up in Little Rock, the biggest bricks-and-mortar evidence of the
Clinton presidency is still to come. The city is getting a
presidential library, though not everyone is thrilled about it.
Plans to name a street for Clinton were scaled back after someone
suggested ``Impeachment Avenue.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Except for us having a national root canal on our local
politics, I don't think it's benefited us one iota,'' Chris
Carnahan of Little Rock said of having a former local resident in
the White House.
</P>
<P>
   Carnahan, of course, as executive director of the Arkansas
Republican Party, has a bad attitude about Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   Not everyone in Little Rock compares the Clinton presidency to
dental discomfort. From day one, the Clinton candidacy raised the
profile of a city previously best defined by the 1957 integration
crisis at Central High School, where Bush had a campaign event on
Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Paul Harvel, head of the Little Rock Chamber of Commerce, said
the city has benefited from the spotlight.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of people across the nation know about Austin,'' he
said. ``Not everyone knew about Little Rock. Now, everyone knows
where Little Rock is. Now, no one asks what state it's in.''
</P>
<P>
   Arkansas Democratic Party Chairman Vaughn McQuary says the
attention has been positive for Little Rock, if not for all Little
Rockians (Little Rockers? Little Rockites? Pebbles?).
</P>
<P>
   ``The never-ending Whitewater investigation has devastated a lot
of good people here in Arkansas for no reason other than they were
friends of the president,'' said McQuary, who blames vindictive
Republicans. ``As far as being able to go back to the good ol' days
of Lyndon Johnson and getting projects into your state, I don't
think this president or the next president or the next president
after that will be able to do those types of things.''
</P>
<P>
   The previous president agreed.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the president should stay out of that,'' ex-President
George Bush said of nudging federal money and projects homeward.
``It's different than the LBJ days. I don't think you can, on
public expenditures of money, leave yourself open to the charge
that you are paving your own state, as opposed to a congressman who
is expected to do that kind of thing.''
</P>
<P>
   But a president can find ways to help the homefolks, Bush added.
</P>
<P>
   ``For example, we had the Republican National Convention in
Houston because people saw that would please me,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Texas already has some high-profile examples of what it means to
have a native son in high places. The LBJ Space Center near Houston
is a product of the Lyndon B. Johnson administration.
</P>
<P>
   The state also has two presidential libraries: Johnson's at the
University of Texas and Bush's at Texas A&AMP;M University. The
Electoral College will decide whether a George W. Bush presidential
library will be needed, but the president of a Dallas college
sounds interested.
</P>
<P>
   ``No discussion has taken place with the governor, but with
Laura Bush being an alumna of SMU we would be receptive to
discussions about the opportunity,'' said Southern Methodist
University President R. Gerald Turner. ``But this is obviously
premature.'' You may contact Ken Herman at

YOU CAN FEEL RICH WITH RIGHT VALUES

   HOUSTON _ ``Who Wants to Be a Millionaire?''
</P>
<P>
   ``Who Wants to Marry a Multimillionaire?''
</P>
<P>
   ``Who Wants to Marry Tom Arnold?''
</P>
<P>
   The money mania that spawned a hit game show and a
stomach-turning ratings stunt has gotten so out of hand, Roseanne's
ex-husband now has a Web site devoted to helping him get dates.
</P>
<P>
   The comedian, however, is not promising potential brides a pot
of gold _ just the chance to marry a relatively famous,
twice-divorced actor with a low sperm count.
</P>
<P>
   Since I am not making any of this up, I think it is fair to say
that, as a nation, we have counterbalanced the dizzying heights of
the bull market with all-time lows in values.
</P>
<P>
   But who can blame us?
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
INSTANT-WEALTH STORIES ABOUND &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   It seems just about every day there's a story in newspapers or
magazines, on television or the World Wide Web about the latest
batch of twentysomething workers who took a chance on an Internet
start-up and struck it rich with stock options.
</P>
<P>
   Or there's the gossip about the stay-at-home mom in the
playgroup of your boss' cousin's best friend who brings in $50,000
a month day trading while her kids nap.
</P>
<P>
   Or the billboards that urge you to spend a dollar twice a week
on the chance to win $4 million or more in the lottery.
</P>
<P>
   That kind of pressure to get rich quick has many of us thinking
we are failing in this economy when we don't have seven-figure bank
accounts.
</P>
<P>
   In this age of instant wealth and instant information, the idea
of keeping up with the Joneses has led to a national sense of
inadequacy more debilitating than the old-fashioned neighborhood
envy.
</P>
<P>
   We worry that we don't make enough, don't invest correctly and
don't know the right people so we can invest correctly, say in a
hot IPO for a B2B start-up.
</P>
<P>
   Most of all, we worry that when this economic era is an entry in
the encyclopedia as the second Gilded Age of the 20th Century, we
won't have an answer for our children when they ask us: ``Why
didn't you make a million in the bull market?''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
FINANCIAL SECURITY IS RELATIVE &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``I would say I was concentrating on taking care of those things
that were of value to me: my family, my health and enjoying my
job,'' says Kurt Goedecke, a financial planner with the Lutheran
Brotherhood. ``Getting rich is not one of my values.''
</P>
<P>
   One trick to feeling satisfied with where you are financially at
a time when playing the stock market has become the national
pastime is to figure out your values and stick to them.
</P>
<P>
   A sense of financial security is a relative feeling. How many
times have you read about people who grew up dirt poor but didn't
realize the magnitude of their family's poverty until they were
adults? Their parents provided them with a sense of well-being that
had nothing to do with income and material goods.
</P>
<P>
   Don't confuse your net worth with your self-worth. By defining
yourself in terms that reflect what is truly important to you, you
immunize yourself from the effects of ``affluenza.''
</P>
<P>
   Another way to inoculate your psyche is to share what you do
have. Being able to give away some money and time to organizations
or charities that reflect your values will increase your sense of
wealth.
</P>
<P>
   Only the truly impoverished _ people with bankrupt inner lives _
have nothing to give someone else.
</P>
<P>
   If you try all of that and you still feel like you are missing
out, take comfort from one last vaccine.
</P>
<P>
   ``If a child asks you what you did in the bull market, that's a
good time to discuss risk,'' says Robert Weinberger, a clinical
psychologist and owner of Weinberger &AMP; Associates.
</P>
<P>
   Come to terms with how much risk you are willing to take. If you
can't bear the thought of losing half your principal investment or
more on an Internet stock, then you are not going to be a
high-flier in this market.
</P>
<P>
   Accept that although you could have taken a lot of risk, you
chose to go for less immediate results, so that in the long term
you didn't suffer from big losses.
</P>
<P>
   That's not failing to capitalize on the bull market. It's just
merely deciding to not worry about getting rich and, instead,
concentrate on not becoming poor.

STOCK TRADERS' BEHAVIOR IS FERTILE FIELD FOR STUDY 
</HEADLINE>
  (Ideas) 
(lb) 
 By DENISE CARUSO   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Why do bond and securities traders trade the way they do? That's
the question Caitlin Zaloom, an anthropologist at the University of
California at Berkeley, is trying to answer. Zaloom wants to know
how technology is affecting the money managers who make decisions
that direct capital flow around the world.
</P>
<P>
   In particular, she says, she is trying to understand how traders
make certain kinds of decisions at a given moment in the trading
pit. ``For example, how, without the tools of calculation available
outside the pit, do they decide when to buy and sell?'' Zaloom
said.
</P>
<P>
   She is comparing the intensely personal interaction between
traders of 30-year Treasury-bond futures at the Chicago Board of
Trade, the world's leading futures exchange, to the thoroughly
computerized tools used in a securities trading room at a private
investment bank in London.
</P>
<P>
   Zaloom's first stop was Chicago, where she was able to observe
the action firsthand as a clerk. The Board of Trade operates under
what is known as the ``open outcry auction market'' system. Instead
of relying on today's disembodied trading systems, it relies almost
entirely on face-to-face relationships to trade tens of millions of
Treasury-bond futures around the world every month.
</P>
<P>
   The trading pit is octagonal with steps descending toward the
middle, allowing all buyers and sellers to see one another. Buy and
sell orders are placed by ritualized hand gestures. The hierarchy
is literal: People who are new or who are not perceived as
particularly adept are relegated to the bottom of the pit.
</P>
<P>
   ``At any given moment, you can watch the personalities and the
emotionality of decision-making in times of intense activity,''
Zaloom said.
</P>
<P>
   Traders take a step up by unspoken consensus, when the senior
traders see that they can handle more trade volume and more
financial risk. None of the traditional measures like education or
connections guarantee success in the pit.
</P>
<P>
   The only measure of success, Zaloom said, is the ability to make
money in the moment. And how that is accomplished ``is discipline _
the ability to admit that you're wrong and sell when the market is
going against you, not convincing yourself it'll turn in your
favor.''
</P>
<P>
   Some of the pit traders Zaloom interviewed said that when they
found themselves thinking in the ways they were trained to think _
as lawyers, for example _ it hampered their ability to trade. ``To
be deliberative is to miss the market,'' she said. ``The market
doesn't exist outside this exact moment in time.''
</P>
<P>
   But if immediacy is the prime factor in the futures pit, she
said, deliberation is at the core of decision-making for fund
managers, like those she has been studying in London. She is still
waiting for permission to observe their daily operations firsthand.
</P>
<P>
   ``Access to these people is incredibly complex,'' she said.
``They want to keep their decision process to themselves because
it's how they make money.''
</P>
<P>
   She says that embedded in the computerized, predictive tools
these financial institutions use ``is a model of human behavior
that assumes the market will act in a certain way; it will produce
an outcome that will happen again and again.''
</P>
<P>
   The Board of Trade, on the other hand, depends on a a pit
trader's social savvy. Zaloom likens it to a poker game, where
traders learn how to read the other players and the feel of the
market.
</P>
<P>
   Zaloom finds the contrast fascinating. Fund managers champion
the use of computers, she says, ``because they provide a level of
rationality. They get rid of personalized relationships; thus they
believe the market will become a more rational, efficient
institution.
</P>
<P>
   ``I prefer to rephrase the question as `Where do those emotional
relationships go?' It doesn't make sense that they disappear.''

<P>
   NEW YORK _ While the New Economy continues to rule the hearts,
minds and wallets of most investors, there appears to be a stirring
among the Old Economy stocks left for dead on Wall Street. Shrewd
institutional investors, who know a bargain when they see one, and
corporate managements, fed up with problems that depressed share
prices present, are taking companies private.
</P>
<P>
   Two deals announced last week characterize the nascent trend.
United States Can, a maker of plastic and steel containers, said on
Wednesday that an investment group led by the chairman of the
company planned to buy it for $282 million. The offer was a 41
percent premium to the stock's price before the announcement. The
shares, which closed Friday at $19.6875, still trade at only 12
times earnings.
</P>
<P>
   A day earlier, senior managers at Cameron Ashley Building
Products made a move to take their company private for $328
million. The offer carried a 21 percent premium to an earlier bid.
At its closing price Friday of $17.4375, Cameron Ashley is trading
at around nine times earnings.
</P>
<P>
   ``As everybody knows, there has been a huge flight of capital
into dot-coms _ technology or biotech,'' said Paul L. Schaye, a
principal at Chestnut Hill Partners, a firm that advises private
equity investors. ``That sucking sound has left everybody else
saying `What about me?'''
</P>
<P>
   The what-about-me's are legion. Schaye said there were hundreds
of publicly traded companies with relatively few shares
outstanding, price/earnings ratios of less than 9 and current
values of less than $1 billion. Those with solid businesses may
become buyout targets, rescuing shareholders and managements from
oblivion.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some old economy companies that are trading at 3 to 6 times
cash flow were trading at 7 to 12 times 2 years ago,'' said Dan
O'Connell, chief executive of Vestar Capital Partners, which
manages $3.6 billion in private equity investments. ``We probably
meet with two to three management teams a day that are considering
going private.''
</P>
<P>
   Going private appeals to these managers because their depressed
stock prices make strategic acquisitions using their own shares
prohibitively expensive. Investors like the going-private deals
because they can acquire valuable assets at cheap prices. Annual
returns of between 20 percent and 30 percent are common. And with
stock prices so depressed, even an investor taking on substantial
debt for a buyout can still make the numbers work.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, the premiums to market price that acquirers paid in
going-private transactions rose significantly last year.
Mergerstat, a supplier of global merger and acquisition data,
reports the median premium paid in 1999 was 32.7 percent, up from
20.4 percent the year before.
</P>
<P>
   Adding to the lure of Old Economy buyouts today is the fact that
earnings in some beaten-down sectors could soar this year. Steven
Weiting of Salomon Smith Barney expects earnings at basic materials
companies and energy concerns to grow 41 percent and 50 percent,
respectively, in 2000. He also sees strong growth in the capital
goods sector.
</P>
<P>
   Investors looking to take companies private have amassed quite a
war chest _ $350 billion by one estimate. Even if half of this goes
into technology companies, that still leaves a good chunk of change
for action among the have-nots.

   GAYS-MILITARY (Washington) _ Harassment of gay men and women in
the American military is widespread, especially in the form of
offensive remarks, derogatory jokes and gestures, and an
overwhelming majority of service members believe their superiors
and colleagues tolerate it ``to some extent,'' according to a
Pentagon survey released Friday. By Steven Lee Myers.

<P>
   MICROSOFT-ANTITRUST (Washington) _ Under pressure from two
federal judges, lawyers for Microsoft and the government are
scrambling to see whether they can settle their antitrust case
within the next few days, and Microsoft presented a new settlement
proposal on Friday. Lawyers for the Justice Department and 19 state
attorneys general were studying it, trying to decide whether it was
serious enough to warrant crash settlement negotiations over the
weekend. By Joel Brinkley.
</P>
<P>
   NY-UNDERCOVER-COPS (New York) _ To curb drug dealing and the
violence it spawns, New York City has embarked on an ambitious and
expensive narcotics enforcement drive, known as Operation Condor,
that for the past two months has put 500 additional police
officers, some in uniform and some in plainclothes, on the streets
to stage undercover drug stings and roust dealers from corners in
high-crime neighborhoods. Police officials say the expansion of
narcotics operations has been a great success, noting that Condor
has produced a 36 percent increase in narcotics arrests. But
critics dispute this portrayal of Operation Condor, saying that the
aggressive tactics being employed to arrest people for often minor
crimes have only increased tensions in a city where many black and
Hispanic citizens already view the police with suspicion or fear.
By Laurie Flynn.
</P>
<P>
   UGANDA-CULT (Kampala, Uganda) _ The Ugandan police said Friday
that they had found the corpses of 153 people, including women and
children, buried under a building used by the cult involved in a
fire last week in which 500 of its members died. (Summary from
wires) By Henri E. Cauvin.
</P>
<P>
   RUSSIA-ELECTION (Moscow) _ In an ugly burst of negative
campaigning, Russia's state-owned television has asserted that the
leading liberal candidate in Sunday's presidential election is
supported by Jews, foreigners and homosexuals. The prime-time
attack on Grigori Yavlinsky, the leader of the liberal Yabloko
faction, was broadcast Thursday night by the ORT television
network. By Michael R. Gordon.
</P>
<P>
   ARGERICH-PIANIST (New York) _ Few people who have heard the
tempestuous, Argentina-born pianist Martha Argerich perform ever
forget it. She is a colossal technician, a powerfully intuitive
musician, and an electrifying performer. But Argerich is the most
enigmatic figure in classical music today, by turns passionate,
disarming and chaotic. A profile. By Anthony Tommasini.
</P>
<P>
   CONGRESS-BUDGET (Washington) _ This year's partisan battle over
the federal budget, which lurched forward early Friday when the
House narrowly passed a Republican tax and spending blueprint, has
a familiar ring to it. Republicans want a big tax cut, more money
for the military and reductions in just about everything else.
Democrats are trying to expand or at least protect spending on a
wide array of domestic programs. Each side is attacking the other
in apocalyptic terms. But it is worth noting that prosperity has
brought the parties closer on fiscal policy than either of them
usually admits. By Richard W. Stevenson.

COMPAQ AND DELL NOTEBOOKS SPARKLE 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By DWIGHT SILVERMAN 
c. 2000 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   HOUSTON _ Beta testers and computer industry professionals
who've been using Windows 2000 for a while all seem to agree on one
thing _ the new operating system from Microsoft really shines on
notebook computers.
</P>
<P>
   That's a refreshing change from its predecessor, Windows NT 4.0,
which was abominable on a portable PC. From its lack of
plug-and-play capabilities to its arcane networking setup to its
nonexistent power management, NT 4.0 was a laptop user's nightmare.
</P>
<P>
   To check whether the praise is justified, I've been living with
a pair of notebooks with Windows 2000 installed. I've been pleased
with the plug-and-play features and the stability, though I can't
say these machines haven't locked up on me. And configuring the
operating system to talk to a corporate network can still be
daunting for an everyday user.
</P>
<P>
   The notebook PCs, meanwhile, are pretty slick. Both are
recommended.
</P>
<P>
   _ Armada M700, $3,499, Compaq Computer Corp.: This is the bigger
brother to the Armada M300, the ultra-portable PC that won my
Attaboy Award for best notebook in 1999. (See
www.chron.com/cs/CDA/story.hts/tech/415820.) It's also the worthy
successor to the popular Digital Hi-Note line, which Compaq
acquired when it bought Digital Equipment Corp.
</P>
<P>
   The M700 falls into a category somewhere between ultra-portables
and full-sized notebooks. It's aimed at road warriors who want a
full-sized keyboard and screen but still want to shed some weight.
</P>
<P>
   The model I tried had a 500-megahertz Intel Pentium III chip; 64
megabytes of memory, which I later bumped up to 128; an
11.2-gigabyte hard drive; built-in 56K fax modem; a DVD-ROM drive;
8 MB of video memory; an ATI Rage Mobility graphics adapter; and a
14.1-inch active-matrix screen.
</P>
<P>
   Compaq's specifications indicate this notebook is about 5
pounds, but that's with a smaller, 13.3-inch screen. Mine felt more
like a solid 6, particularly with the DVD installed. It also comes
in a very solid magnesium case.
</P>
<P>
   The M700 uses a trackpoint-style pointing device _ it looks like
a pencil eraser jammed between the G and H keys _ which may be
falling out of favor. While I don't mind it, I showed this notebook
to a lot of folks who looked at the nub and said, ``Eeew, I don't
like that.'' Most of them expressed a preference for the touchpad
that lets you use a finger to move the mouse cursor _ which is the
pointing device used on the smaller M300.
</P>
<P>
   The keyboard is expansive and comfortable to use, with a
spacious wrist-rest that also houses the computer's speakers. My
only complaint here is that some useful keys _ such as the Delete
key _ are shrunken. There's plenty of room for more full-sized
keys, and I don't know about you, but I make enough typing errors
that a big, fat Delete key is a necessity.
</P>
<P>
   Battery life was about average _ I usually got close to 2 1/2
hours.
</P>
<P>
   The M700 was a fast computer _ particularly once I added an
additional 64 MB of memory. Windows 2000 really is happiest with
128 MB, I believe, just as Windows 98 really gets jumping at 64 MB.
The memory-chip moguls must love Microsoft.
</P>
<P>
   This was the first Windows 2000 notebook I tried. I learned here
that, while the operating system will let you swap out devices such
as DVD and floppy drives, you have to disable the devices first. I
also learned that not disabling the devices is a good way to lock
up this supposedly stable operating system.
</P>
<P>
   But other than through my own boneheadedness, Windows 2000
didn't crash on the M700. Nor did any of the applications I was
running, some of which are prone to nasty behavior on some Windows
98 machines.
</P>
<P>
   I did have some problems finding the right settings to make it
talk to the Chronicle's corporate network. The settings dialogues
are different enough from both Windows NT and 98 that I had to
resort to trial and error.
</P>
<P>
   _ Latitude LS, $2,600, Dell Computer Corp.: This is Dell's
second shot at an ultraportable notebook. The first, a variation of
the Sharp Actius, was a nice machine _ but this is better.
</P>
<P>
   The Latitude LS is a classic ultraportable, with that category's
natural benefits as well as failings. It's thin and quite light,
but it achieves its small size by using external drives and losing
the serial port. That means if you need to install software or will
be accepting data disks on the road, you'll need to carry the
floppy and CD drives along.
</P>
<P>
   My test unit came with a 400-MHz Pentium III processor, 128 MB
of memory, a 6-GB hard drive, a built-in 56K fax modem, an Ethernet
jack, external CD and floppy drives, a NeoMagic graphics adapter
with 2.5 MB of video memory and an 11.1-inch active-matrix screen.
</P>
<P>
   It weighs in at just under 4 pounds; a larger optional battery
kicks the weight up substantially. It is about three-fourths the
size of a traditional notebook computer, about an inch thin and is
packed into a stylish silver-colored magnesium case.
</P>
<P>
   The keyboard is slightly undersized, but comfortable to use.
Like the M700, some keys are smaller than others, including the
Delete key. It uses the touchpad as a pointing device, and it's a
nice implementation.
</P>
<P>
   The Latitude LS has just about every connection you'd need
except for the aforementioned serial port. An optional port
replicator is available for $199.
</P>
<P>
   Battery life was excellent, with the Latitude reliably getting
over three hours.
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately, the active-matrix screen can only handle up to
800-by-600 resolution in normal mode. Sure, you can set it at
1,024-by-768 in a so-called ``virtual desktop,'' but this is
maddening to use. The screen image slides from side to side and top
to bottom to give you the impression you're getting more real
estate.
</P>
<P>
   Windows 2000 performed well here, except for one problem. A
couple of times the system would not come out of hibernation
properly, locking up. Restarting the Latitude cured the problem.
</P>
<P>
   I really enjoyed using this notebook, though I wish Dell had
found a way to have swapable drives built into the case. I really
dislike lugging external drives. Maybe on version 2.0?
</P>

 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Sometimes a bookstore is just a bookstore.
</P>
<P>
   But sometimes, as today's Freudians should know, it is also a
publisher, a Web site and a gathering place for readings, lectures
and book parties. At least that is the case with Other Books, on
the first floor of a turn-of-the-century brownstone building in the
Chelsea neighborhood.
</P>
<P>
   The store's window displays an Interpretation of Dreams T-shirt
and a ``Freudian Slips'' adhesive note pad to ``write what's really
on your mind.'' Inside the front room, books with titles like
``Before I was I'' and ``Ours, Yours, Mine'' are packed into
bursting shelves, while crammed in the back are desks and
flat-screen computers for editing books and journals. And at the
rear of the building is a small office (with couch, of course)
where Michael Moskowitz, Other Press' publisher, sees his patients.
</P>
<P>
   An analyst, an academic and an editor, Moskowitz, 49, is a
psychoanalytic entrepreneur with a mission. He wants to rescue
psychoanalysis from the academic isolation and bitter scholarly
skirmishes that have dogged it for the last 20 years by bridging
the divide between clinicians and theorists who work in various
disciplines. In the process, he hopes to turn Other Books into an
intellectual center for psychoanalysis and related subjects.
</P>
<P>
   ``Postwar American psychoanalysis did itself a tremendous
disservice by cutting itself off from the culture at large,'' he
said one day recently, sipping a glass of white wine over lunch at
a neighborhood bistro.
</P>
<P>
   A compact man with shoulder-length hair and piercing eyes,
Moskowitz speaks of psychoanalysis with the pained concern one
might use to describe a wayward child. ``On the one hand, it
refused to recognize that all sorts of nonanalysts could
legitimately use psychoanalytic theory. On the other hand, it cut
itself off from real experimental science.
</P>
<P>
   ``At Other Press, we want to get scientists talking to
humanists, clinicians to theorists, Lacanians to Freudians, and
Americans to analysts all over the world.''
</P>
<P>
   Compared with the near-glacial time frame one associates with
the psychoanalytic process, Other Press' progress has been
extremely rapid. In less than two years, Moskowitz has opened the
bookstore, published the company's first 30 titles, acquired three
journals (including Psychoanalytic Quarterly, the oldest
independent journal on the topic), and founded a new
interdisciplinary journal _ Infant, Child and Adolescent
Psychotherapy.
</P>
<P>
   Last fall Other Press bought Karnac Books, Britain's pre-eminent
psychoanalytic bookseller and publisher, which brought two London
bookstores and a 250-title backlist along with it.
</P>
<P>
   Now Moskowitz is trying to turn his Web site into what he calls
``the Amazon of psychoanalysis,'' offering a psychoanalytic
best-seller list and chapters from Other Press' own books and
journals.
</P>
<P>
   ``We want to be the destination for psychotherapists and people
interested in cultural studies and related areas,'' Moskowitz
explained. ``There are over 500,000 therapists in the U.S. and
several million around the world.''
</P>
<P>
   Other Press publishes widely in the field, including a series
introducing the notoriously difficult ideas of the French
psychoanalyst Jacques Laca, that is being edited by Moskowitz's
business partner, Judith Fehrer-Gurewich, a Belgian psychoanalyst
with a law degree and a Ph.D. in sociology. It was she who raised
funds for Other Press from European investment bankers with an
interest in psychoanalysis.
</P>
<P>
   Other new books are John Gedo's ``Evolution of Psychoanalysis,''
a comprehensive overview of the field, as well as the reissue of
several psychoanalytic classics, like Robert Lindner's
``Fifty-Minute Hour'' and Dorothy Dinnerstein's feminist ``Mermaid
and the Minotaur.''
</P>
<P>
   Moskowitz is embarking on his venture at a time when
psychoanalysis has taken a beating in both the academic world,
where there have been nasty battles over Freud's theories and
experimental practices, and the marketplace, where managed care and
anti-depressants have sharply curtailed the availability of therapy
_ especially expensive, time-consuming psychoanalysis. Leading
university presses like Yale and Harvard, as well as established
trade houses, have virtually ceased publishing psychoanalytic
books.
</P>
<P>
   But Moskowitz is unfazed, and to scholars and analysts who have
wearied of what they call the ``Freud wars,'' Other Press
represents a refreshingly open and nondogmatic perspective.
</P>
<P>
   Jonathan Lear, a philosopher and psychoanalyst who teaches at
the University of Chicago, says: ``The best response to the critics
of Freud is not to answer them point by point, but to do something
new and interesting. And that is precisely what Michael is doing by
providing a forum for the most creative work going on today.''
</P>
<P>
   Elisabeth Young-Bruehl, the biographer of Anna Freud and
co-author of ``Cherishment,'' a study of Eastern and Western
theories of emotional attachment, says, ``A wonderful rejuvenation
of psychoanalysis is taking place, and Other Press is the cafe for
the process.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite various setbacks, Moskowitz and others are convinced
that psychoanalysis is developing a broader intellectual and social
significance.
</P>
<P>
   ``Twenty years ago, psychoanalysis was predominantly white, male
and middle-class,'' said Kirkland Vaughns, a black psychoanalyst
who is the editor of Infant, Child and Adolescent Psychotherapy.
``A tremendous amount has been learned since then that can benefit
emotionally disturbed black and Hispanic kids who are usually sent
straight to the juvenile justice system.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   There are few disciplines that have not been influenced by
psychoanalysis, and new programs in psychoanalytic studies have
recently been founded at Emory University, Columbia University and
the University of Chicago.
</P>
<P>
   ``As a cultural phenomenon, this is the great age of
psychoanalysis,'' says Richard J. Bernstein, the head of the
philosophy department at the New School for Social Research. ``Our
courses on it draw students from a greater variety of disciplines
than ever before.''
</P>
<P>
   The son of an immigrant Hungarian plumber, Moskowitz has always
perceived himself as someone who was _ as the title of his book
suggests _ ``Reaching Across Boundaries of Culture and Class.'' He
grew up in Port Jervis, and his first encounter with Freud came at
age 14 when he found a copy of ``The Interpretation of Dreams''
that his sister had brought home from college.
</P>
<P>
   Arriving at Columbia in 1967, Moskowitz was shocked to find that
the Psychology 101 course didn't include Freud. ``No one reads that
stuff anymore,'' he was told by a professor. Accordingly, in good
'60s fashion, Moskowitz took over a class and brought in an analyst
from the medical school.
</P>
<P>
   After receiving his Ph.D. in psychology from City University and
his analytic training at New York University, Moskowitz taught,
worked in various mental hospitals and started a community-based
counseling center for traumatized Vietnam veterans in New Haven,
Conn.
</P>
<P>
   In 1992 he joined Jason Aronson, a publisher of books on
psychology and Judaica, and for the next five years ran the
psychology half of the business. In 1998 he was approached by
Gurewich with a proposal to start a press of their own.
</P>
<P>
   Moskowitz is determined to develop Other Press' scope both here
and abroad. He is talking to the London School of Economics about
creating a think tank to analyze social issues from a
psychoanalytic perspective, and he wants to start a journal in
South America, where psychoanalysis seems to be thriving (``Every
hill town in Argentina has an analyst,'' he says).
</P>
<P>
   But New York is still at the psychological heart. ``What I love
about the bookstore is that it is a real space, a safe community
where all are welcome and ideas can be freely exchanged,''
Moskowitz said. ``The fact is that we are biological animals who
live in culture. Psychoanalysis is the only theory I know of that
tries to explain both these things.''

HOW TO TELL IF YOUR PROCESSOR IS A CELERON OR A PENTIUM II 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By DWIGHT SILVERMAN 
c. 2000 Houston Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   HOUSTON _ Q: I bought a new PC with Windows 98. The processor is
an Intel Celeron. While booting, the configuration reads Celeron.
But in the Windows system settings, it reads as a Pentium II
processor. How do I determine if the vendor has really given me a
Celeron or if he has given me a lesser-performing processor and
tampered with the CMOS settings to read as a Celeron?
</P>
<P>
   A: Actually, if the vendor tampered with the BIOS to force the
computer to show a Celeron processor when you actually got a
Pentium II, you're getting the better end of the deal.
</P>
<P>
   Although the Celeron processor was released after the Pentium
II, it's not quite as powerful. A Celeron is really a Pentium II
chip, but with less built-in cache, which is a memory buffer that
speeds the transfer of data into and out of the processor.
</P>
<P>
   When Windows 98 was originally released, Celeron processors were
not around. As a result, Windows doesn't recognize them. Instead,
they appear as Pentium II chips. But your BIOS is probably giving
you accurate information.
</P>
<P>
   Q: I have a printer and a scanner that use USB ports, so I
bought a hub to add more USB connections. Then I bought an MP3
player that uses USB. When I plug it into the hub, I am told there
is not enough power. What's going on?
</P>
<P>
   A: There are two types of USB hubs _ powered and unpowered.
Unpowered hubs get their ``juice'' from the computer itself.
Powered hubs rely on an AC adapter.
</P>
<P>
   Some USB devices require more power than others. For example, a
USB printer has its own power supply, but an MP3 player may require
more power than it gets from its batteries in order to transfer
files from the PC.
</P>
<P>
   Or, it may be a device such as Microsoft's IntelliMouse
Explorer, which includes a tiny camera and an LED. Those devices
each require a relatively large amount of power, and a powered hub
is required.
</P>
<P>
   Some vendors, including Microsoft, are now selling keyboards
with USB ports on them, which seems like a clever idea except that
the keyboards don't usually have their own power supply. That means
the keyboard is an unpowered hub, and will not support all USB
devices.
</P>
<P>
   What you can do is plug the MP3 player directly into one of the
USB ports on your PC. Most PCs now have at least two USB plugs, so
you can then plug your unpowered hub into the second port.
</P>
<P>
   Q: I have a new cable modem, and I understand there's a patch I
can get that will make my connection even faster. Where can I get
it?
</P>
<P>
   A: Try www.speedguide.net/Cablemodems/cablepatches.shtml.
</P>
<P>
   What most of these patches do is change settings in the Windows
registry to improve the way your PC connects to the Internet. You
need different settings if you have a high-speed connection than
the defaults, which in Windows are set for traditional modems.
</P>
<P>
   There are also some fixes from Microsoft on that page, including
one for a bug in Microsoft's TCP/IP component.
</P>
<P>
   As always, use these patches with caution _ and your mileage may
vary.

DRIVING AND TALKING MAY MEAN CRASHING 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By L.M. SIXEL 
c. 2000 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   HOUSTON _ It's the hottest, newest, most-talked-about employer
liability issue of the moment: employees who conduct business on
their company cellular phones while driving.
</P>
<P>
   Most everyone does it _ that's why companies issue cellular
phones _ but the liability question inevitably comes up when folks
get so carried away with the phone conversation that they run into
other drivers.
</P>
<P>
   Employers are having to pay damages, Rodney Glover, a lawyer
with Gardner, Carton &AMP; Douglas in Washington, D.C., told those
gathered this week for a seminar sponsored by the Houston Human
Resource Management Association at the George R. Brown Convention
Center.
</P>
<P>
   Glover scared the group with a story about how financial
services firm Smith Barney ended up settling a cellular phone case
for $150,000 in addition to the firm's liability insurance coverage
after one of its brokers hit a motorcyclist while trying to dial a
client. The motorcyclist died after the broker ran a red light.
</P>
<P>
   The news caught many of the human resource managers by surprise.
An informal survey of about a dozen managers revealed that most had
never even considered that potential liability of DWT.
</P>
<P>
   Only one manager said the subject had come up at the branch
manager level, but hadn't gone anywhere beyond that.
</P>
<P>
   But don't mention the company, the manager said with a nervous
laugh. He didn't exactly want it getting around.
</P>
<P>
   For most companies, though, it's not on the radar screen. And
that could be a mistake.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
ISSUE BECOMES MORE SENSITIVE &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   It's a sensitive issue for companies, especially in light of
recent news on the dangers of driving while talking on a cellular
phone. One study compared the practice to drunken driving.
</P>
<P>
   And there is growing resentment against drivers who talk on
their cellular phones. Parents who have lost their children because
of cellular phone accidents are campaigning for laws to prohibit
their use in moving vehicles. And cars are sporting bumper stickers
that read: ``Hang Up and Drive!''
</P>
<P>
   But companies, eager to boost productivity, often encourage
employees to use the cellular phones to make sales calls.
</P>
<P>
   It's often an implicit requirement, said Dennis Herlong, a civil
trial lawyer who handles a variety of employment cases in Houston.
</P>
<P>
   Like the human resource managers, lawyers haven't exactly been
sitting around thinking about cellular phone liability.
</P>
<P>
   But since the question came up, Herlong said he recommends that
companies set firm policies that prohibit employees from using a
cellular phone while driving. Employees should be required to pull
over when they need to use the phone. Otherwise, employers should
be held responsible for accidents.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wouldn't feel comfortable turning people loose with a cell
phone,'' Herlong said.
</P>
<P>
   Neither would Margie Harris, an employment lawyer in Houston.
</P>
<P>
   It makes sense to install a speaker into employees' cars so
drivers don't have to hold a car phone. When you dial a phone, your
concentration is diverted, said Harris, who has been known to talk
on her phone while driving but saves her dialing for stoplights.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
COMMON SENSE MAY CLASH &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Several of Houston's largest companies were surveyed on the
subject _ and many managers responded with something like ``huh?''
But at least one, Apache Corp., the energy company, is talking
about the talking-while-driving issue.
</P>
<P>
   Apache recently included a warning in one of its periodic safety
bulletins to its field staff about studies linking the increase in
accidents with cellular phone use. The bulletin urged employees to
use common sense when using their cellular phones in a vehicle,
said Tony Lentini, vice president of public and international
affairs.
</P>
<P>
   The company is also looking into whether it should establish a
cellular phone driving policy but there are a few issues to resolve
first, such as how to enforce it and how should the company treat
phones that have hands-free speakers, Lentini said.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, lawyers often find a problem behind every rule, and
Glover, the seminar's speaker, pointed out that telling employees
to pull over before they make a call from the car could create
another liability.
</P>
<P>
   After all, what happens if an employee is attacked at a rest
area?
</P>

 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Driving the BMW X5, you might titter an aha! _ as if you've
caught somebody failing to practice his preaching. It's the feeling
you'd get after sitting through a fiery sermon on demon rum, then
bumping into the reverend in a barroom, tossing back shots of
tequila.
</P>
<P>
   For years, BMW has spread the gospel of Ultimate Driving
Machines, by which it meant high-performance cars with rear-wheel
drive, low-slung suspensions, crisp manual shifters and glued-down
road manners.
</P>
<P>
   Even while competitors like Mercedes-Benz jumped head-first into
the sport utility market, BMW stood back with smug detachment. But,
just as it succumbed to pressure from self-indulgent Americans and
added cup holders, it has now joined the truck parade with the 2000
X5.
</P>
<P>
   The company would prefer that you not call the X5 an SUV, but a
``sports activity vehicle.'' While it differs considerably in some
ways from other rugged-outside, soft-inside vehicles, in the end it
is perhaps not so different after all. However much the company
would like you to consider the X5 a new concept in transportation,
it walks and quacks much like a duck, er, truck.
</P>
<P>
   In truck fashion, the X5 sits relatively high, and it puts power
on the road through all four wheels. It weighs a hefty 4,828 pounds
and will tow three tons. The doors are heavy and trucklike, and
though the climb inside is less steep than in most big SUVs, you
still pull yourself up into the cabin. The driver looks down on
ordinary cars, including other BMWs.
</P>
<P>
   But unlike other premium-priced sport utilities, the X5 has a
one-piece structure, not a body on a separate frame, plus a
sophisticated independent suspension. Some parts are shared with
BMW cars. Unlike most 4-by-4 trucks, it doesn't have a low gear
range for off-roading.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps most important, BMW went to extreme lengths to lower the
center of gravity; this was deemed crucial in minimizing the tippy
feel of sport utilities and in providing a semblance of BMW's
sporty driving dynamics.
</P>
<P>
   This effort, coupled with a body structure nearly as rigid as a
BMW sedan's and perfect front-rear weight distribution, indeed
makes the X5 the best-handling sport utility around. But, as the
SAV label suggests, the utility is missing. You couldn't take it up
a rocky trail if you wanted, and its cargo space _ 16 cubic feet
with the rear seat up _ is smaller than a Taurus' trunk.
</P>
<P>
   Such a design was no accident. BMW is responding to consumers'
wishes for an SUV that's actually a car with attitude _ that looks
as if it could roam the Serengeti but is more at home in Saddle
River.
</P>
<P>
   Plus, the company needed a vehicle that wouldn't cannibalize its
5-Series wagons or the true off-roaders of its Land Rover
subsidiary (which Ford has agreed to buy). So the X5 is either a
trucklike car or a carlike truck, and it has the pluses and minuses
of both.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, the concept of a Bimmer SUV is appealing, so
expectations are high. Starting last fall, queries came from
friends, colleagues, strangers: Have you seen it? Have you driven
it? How much? I picked up the test vehicle on 43rd Street; by the
time I reached 57th I'd fielded admiring questions and thumbs-up
signals at five stoplights.
</P>
<P>
   But the hip 20-somethings who seemed most impressed aren't
likely to buy a vehicle with a sticker of $55,315. (The base price
of the 4.4i, the V-8 model, is $49,970.) There are reports that the
German head of a publishing company is driven to work in one.
</P>
<P>
   The idea of a chauffeur-driven X5 will amuse anyone who has had
much seat time, for the stiff suspension that helps the X5 handle
adroitly results in a jarring ride. It is one thing to be
jackhammered in an M roadster just above the pavement; it is
another thing altogether to experience buckboard motions in a
vehicle high off the road.
</P>
<P>
   But if the ride is a negative, the X5 handles well enough to
make you a believer. The all-new unit body exudes quiet strength;
the chassis is taut and responsive; the rack-and-pinion steering is
heavy _ perhaps too heavy _ and the huge brakes are superlative.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
   Several runs on an autocross course, part of the Ultimate
Driving Experience program that seeks to lure new BMW customers,
left no doubt about the X5's stability and abilities. It performs
much like a BMW car, which is to say very well.
</P>
<P>
   The engine is essentially the same 4.4-liter V-8 used in BMW's
big sedans, in this case with 282 horsepower and 324 foot-pounds of
torque. Although not quite as fast as the 342-horsepower V-8 in the
Mercedes ML55 _ the reigning hot rod of SUVs _ it is close enough,
especially considering that the ML55 costs $15,000 more. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The X5's five-speed transmission is a gem, too, although its
Steptronic self-shifting feature isn't as much fun as it sounds.
</P>
<P>
   A V-6 model, due in late spring for $40,000 and up, will also
offer a five-speed manual.
</P>
<P>
   Either version has a full-time all-wheel-drive system that
ordinarily sends a third of the power to the front wheels and
two-thirds to the rear, an effort to preserve the BMW rear-drive
feel. The system also relies heavily on traction controls, applying
the brake to a slipping wheel and feeding torque to tires with
grip.
</P>
<P>
   Such a system _ the Mercedes M-Class's is similar _ works well
on moderately bad roads but is less practical in severe conditions
where wheel spin is desirable. Nor are the X5's big, soft tires
helpful in wintry conditions.
</P>
<P>
   The X5 comes with a lot of technological bells and whistles,
including dynamic stability control, which helps to prevent skids,
and dynamic brake control, which reinforces the driver's effort in
panic stops. A hill descent feature borrowed from Land Rover holds
the vehicle to a steady, slow speed on steep downhill grades.
</P>
<P>
   The X5's cabin is rich, with wide panels of poplar and enough
leather to warrant an animal-rights protest. The steering wheel has
controls for the cruise control, stereo and optional car phone.
Buttons remember the preferred settings, for three drivers, of the
seats, shoulder belt, steering wheel and mirrors. The driver has a
huge left footrest.
</P>
<P>
   The early-production test vehicle seemed generally tight and
quiet, with a couple of exceptions. There was more wind noise than
you'd expect, plus a persistent, highly annoying squeak _ akin to
fingernails scraping a blackboard _ from the shoulder-belt anchor
next to the driver's left ear.
</P>
<P>
   The two-part cargo door has a glass liftgate plus a fold-down
tailgate; a one-piece design would be more convenient.
</P>
<P>
   Safety features include front and side air bags and
head-protection bags above the doors. The X5 is highly rated in
government crash tests, and its bumpers are situated low for
collision compatibility with cars.
</P>
<P>
   All this adds up to an impressive package, on paper, yet the X5
lacks the purity of form and function that enthusiasts expect from
BMW. Perhaps that is the price of competing at a time when small
companies feel the need to offer more things to more people, in a
world where style is supreme. For the X5 is, ultimately, an
off-road fashion statement for people who don't go off road. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   INSIDE TRACK: Just what people were asking for, for better or
worse. &QL;

 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   MOSCOW _ Russia's state-owned television has broadcast reports
that the nation's leading liberal challenger to Vladimir Putin is
supported by Jews, homosexuals and foreigners.
</P>
<P>
   The three prime-time reports by the ORT television network were
clearly intended to exploit the anti-Semitism, homophobia and
suspicion of foreigners that still pervade Russian society, as well
as Russians' enthusiasm for conspiracy theories.
</P>
<P>
   The reports, broadcast Thursday night, indicated that the forces
behind Putin were trying to make sure that he would win more than
50 percent of the votes cast Sunday. He needs that many to avoid a
run-off, which would be held April 16.
</P>
<P>
   The candidate against whom the broadcasts were aimed, Grigori A.
Yavlinsky, the leader of the liberal Yabloko faction, is generally
held to have no chance in the election. But though Yavlinsky, who
is part Jewish, is running a distant third, he is the candidate who
stands to siphon the most votes from Putin. He therefore poses the
greatest danger to the acting president's chances of winning a
mandate on the first round.
</P>
<P>
   Hoping to score a decisive victory, Putin on Friday implored
Russians to go to the polls and pick a leader who could restore the
country's prestige and command its nuclear arsenal. The Russian
Orthodox Patriarch Aleksy II also urged a high turnout.
</P>
<P>
   But the televised reports had a different tone. Kseniya
Ponomaryova, the deputy head of Putin's election headquarters, said
she saw nothing wrong with the reports, which she said the campaign
had not orchestrated.
</P>
<P>
   ``ORT has shown that gays support Yavlinsky, and that there are
grounds to consider that his campaign is financed by persons who do
not have Russian citizenship,'' she said. ``What can I say about
it?''
</P>
<P>
   But others said the reports made a mockery of the Kremlin's
pledge to take the high road.
</P>
<P>
   ``Putin promised no dirty tricks during the presidential
campaign,'' said Grigory Arbatov, a long-time specialist on
Russia's relationship with the West. ``But now they turning all the
propaganda against Yavlinsky during the last days of the campaign.
Putin's whole style reminds me of a policeman in the provinces.''
</P>
<P>
   The Russian government formally owns 51 per cent of the ORT
channel, whose reports are seen throughout Russia. Boris Berezovsky
_ the tycoon, master political intriguer, Putin supporter and
Yavlinsky foe _ is also a major owner and has an played an
influential behind-the-scenes role at the network.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Certainly, ORT has not hesitated in the past to join the
political fray. Before parliamentary elections in December, Sergei
Dorenko, the host of one of the network's most watched news affairs
shows, conducted slashing attacks against Yevgenni Primakov, the
former prime minister, and Yuri Luzhkov, the Moscow mayor, both
Putin rivals.
</P>
<P>
   The relentless criticism was one reason Primakov and Luzhkov
fell way behind Putin in the opinion polls and decided not to take
part in the presidential campaign. But Thursday night's broadcast
was exceptional even by ORT's standards.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   One of ORT's reports charged that Yavlinsky was bankrolled by
powerful Jewish businessmen, specifically Vladimir Gusinsky, the
head of the NTV, Russia's only independent television network. He
is one of Russia's most prominent Jewish citizens.
</P>
<P>
   Gusinsky has dual Russian and Israeli citizenship. ORT's report,
however, emphasized his Jewish background. It showed Gusinsky at a
banquet with Hasidic leaders who were wearing black fedoras and
yarmulkes.
</P>
<P>
   Gusinsky has made no secret of his view that Yavlinsky is the
best candidate for Russia. But ORT suggested darkly that Yavlinsky
was secretly being financed by ``Israeli citizens.'' It was a
striking attack in light of Putin's vows to battle anti-Semitism.
</P>
<P>
   The network also charged, without producing any evidence, that
Yavlinsky's campaign was receiving financial support two German
think tanks. Its most eye-catching report was about gay Russians
who ostensibly are backing Yavlinsky.
</P>
<P>
   There is little tolerance in Russia for homosexuals and they
have not been a visible or important factor in the nation's
political life. So the report that a gay organization had organized
a press conference in the ``Blue Heart Club'' created a stir.
``Blue'' is Russian slang for ``gay.''
</P>
<P>
   The ORT report cautioned that the press conference might be part
of a disinformation campaign, but not until it had first broadcast
the effusive declarations of support for Yavlinsky.
</P>
<P>
   ORT and RTR, Russia's other state-owned television network,
attended the event. NTV said it was not invited and that the entire
episode appeared to have been staged.
</P>
<P>
   That was hardly the only mud that has been slung at Yavlinsky.
ORT has also charged that he secretly underwent plastic surgery.
</P>
<P>
   Friday night, ORT's coverage of Yavlinsky was more restrained.
It continued to criticize him, but also broadcast a letter from
Yavlinsky denying that his campaign had received foreign funds.
</P>
<P>
   The two German think tanks featured in the ORT report also told
the Russian press they were not underwriting Yavlinsky's
presidential bid.
</P>
<P>
   For all its unsavoriness, the logic of ORT's attacks on
Yavlinsky is clear. Yavlinsky is only expected to receive between 5
and 10 per cent of the vote. Many of his supporters, however, are
from Russia's emerging middle class. They could help Putin achieve
the majority he is seeking in the first round of voting if they
were induced to back the acting president.

   Igor Malashenko, a senior executive at Berezovsky's media
conglomerate, said there several explanations for ORT's broadcast.
Berezovsky, he said, might be going out of his way to demonstrate
his loyalty to Putin. And Putin's campaign team, he said, is
anxious to avoid a run-off.
</P>
<P>
   ``People are not terribly excited by the election,'' Malashenko
said. ``So they want to demonstrate that there is some sinister
conspiracy against Putin _ basically, a Jewish conspiracy.''
</P>
<P>
   Otto Latsis, a political analyst at the newspaper Izvestia, said
he doubted that Putin has personally authorized the broadcasts and
described them as despicable and foolish.
</P>
<P>
   ``Whoever made the decision was trying too hard,'' he said.

OSCAR NOMINATION PUTS SPOTLIGHT ON `AMERICAN BEAUTY' SCRIPT
WRITER 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)

<P>
   Alan Ball now knows why some celebrities ``go nuts.'' Since he
his Academy Award nomination for Best Original Screenplay for
``American Beauty,'' he has spent so much time talking about
himself that he has to keep reality in check.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm seeing what it's like, in terms of being a celebrity _ but
not quite really a celebrity _ but to get a lot of attention and be
interviewed a lot and photographed a lot,'' Ball said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can understand why famous people go nuts. You develop a
persona that's like the best version of yourself that you present
every time you're interviewed,'' he said in a telephone interview a
few days before the big night. ``This is like a two-month thing for
me and it will be over. But after a while, for big movie stars,
they probably begin to believe that persona.''
</P>
<P>
   As a build-up to the Academy Awards ceremonies March 26, Ball
said that his ``job for the past three weeks has become just being
me,'' in interviews with television stations, magazines and
newspapers. Ball admits that he's getting an unusual amount of
attention for a screenwriter.
</P>
<P>
   One reason, he said, is that American Beauty started with a
``spec script,'' written with hopes of being sold. ``It was my own
idea,'' he said. Most movies start with a producer or a star, not a
writer.
</P>
<P>
   When he was in high school, Ball said that dreamed ``of going to
the Oscars, but as an actor.''
</P>
<P>
   He gave up the acting dream and spent more than a few Oscar
nights with friends ``drinking martinis and screaming at the
television. It's such a bizarre spectacle. It's like a Fellini
movie.''
</P>
<P>
   ``American Beauty,'' a black comedy that focuses on the material
excesses of society while exploring the disintegration of a
seemingly successful suburban family, opened in October, at the
same time that the TV comedy he created, ``Oh, Grow Up'' premiered
on ABC.
</P>
<P>
   The film became a critic's darling, while the series was
canceled after a few episodes, leaving him somewhat embittered
about television. But he said that the show's failure _ which he
blames partly on the network _ probably kept him more balanced with
the wild success of ``American Beauty,'' which has grossed more
than $100 million in the United States and Canada.
</P>
<P>
   ``If everything had been successful, it would have been
difficult to keep my head,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   But the irony of the reasons for the show's cancellation _ the
resignation of Jamie Tarses who as ABC Entertainment president had
championed the show, and the success of ``Who Wants to be a
Millionaire'' _ are not lost on him.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was interesting that I had this amazingly positive
experience and this horribly devastating experience. I will never
be glad that the show was canceled for `Who Wants to be a
Millionaire.' That show panders to people's basest instinct, which
is one of things, ironically, that `American Beauty' is questioning
_ that money will give meaning to your life.''
</P>
<P>
   He was angry that the network ``strung us along for so long.
They had decided to pull the show and didn't tell us. I was pouring
my heart into the show and we did some really good episodes, but a
couple of them never aired.''
</P>
<P>
   All the attention surrounding the Oscars hasn't kept Ball from
writing, which is ``what keeps me sane. I just need to write.''
</P>
<P>
   He's working on another screenplay that is ``very very different
from `American Beauty.' I'm always asked, `How do you top `American
Beauty'? You don't try to. You do something different,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's what I'm doing. I think if I allowed myself that
everything I do has to be of the same magnitude, I might just shoot
myself.''
</P>
<P>
   He's also working on the pilot for a proposed HBO series about a
family that owns a funeral home. Ball expects to direct the pilot
in July if the pay cable network picks it up. Despite his
experience with ``Oh, Grow Up,'' he said that he likes the medium
and looks forward to the freedom that a cable network can offer a
writer.
</P>
<P>
   Ball said he has spent the last few weeks traveling from one
awards ceremony to another, picking up trophies along the way.
``It's like going to the prom on a weekly basis,'' he said. But
he's been trying to put the Academy Awards ceremony out of his
head, at least until he has to be there.
</P>
<P>
   Even though old friends (and suddenly new ones) keep telling him
he's going to win, he doesn't want to think about the odds.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's out of my hands. It's possible to ignore it, at least
momentarily. I don't know what obsessing would do for me. I'll be
nervous enough the day of the ceremony.''
</P>
<P>
   However the Oscars turn out, he's said that he's happy about
life.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's been great for my career. Now I'm in a place where I can
pick and choose and call my own shots and that's rare. I'm also
aware that it may not last. My next movie could be a flop, and
that's all they'll remember.''
</P>
<P>
   Because he's not yet a member of the Academy of Motion Picture
Arts and Sciences, Ball couldn't vote for himself, which he said
that he would have done. He said, with a sincerity that is
surprising for a writer better known for a biting sense of irony
and sarcasm:
</P>
<P>
   ``I know that it sounds so corny and insincere, but being
nominated itself is really such an honor, especially this year
because it's been such a good year for American movies. I can't
believe my name is on the same list as Charlie Kaufman (`Being John
Malkovich'), Paul Thomas Anderson (`Magnolia'), M. Night Shyamalan
(`The Sixth Sense') and Mike Leigh (`Topsy-Turvy').''
</P>
<P>
   He said that he'll be nervous on March 26, not only about the
awards and a possible acceptance speech, but just being around the
movie stars who will be surrounding him.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I met Kevin Spacey, I was practically a babbling idiot,''
Ball said. But now that he's being recognized, ``People I always
admired and respected want to meet me. I'm just usually bowled over
and gush at them shamelessly.''
</P>
<P>
   And for that obligatory Hollywood moment, Ball will be doing his
star gazing while looking his best. He'll be wearing a Prada tuxedo
that the design company is giving him.
</P>
<P>
   ``My stock must have gone up. When I went to the Golden Globes,
I wore Armani and they gave me a 30 percent discount.''
</P>

THYSSENKRUPP MAKES UNSOLICITED OFFER FOR VODAFONE SUBSIDIARY 
</HEADLINE>
  (lh) 
 By ANDREW ROSS SORKIN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON _ The British mobile telephone giant Vodafone AirTouch
PLC said Friday that it had received an unsolicited offer from
ThyssenKrupp AG, Germany's largest steelmaker, for the car parts
and engineering unit of Mannesmann, which Vodafone recently agreed
to acquire for $183 billion in the biggest hostile takeover of all
time.
</P>
<P>
   The offer by ThyssenKrupp for Mannesmann's
automotive-engineering subsidiary, called Atecs, was considered a
surprise, partly because Vodafone and Mannesmann had been planning
to sell Atecs through a public stock offering in June. Vodafone
said the ThyssenKrupp proposal would be considered.
</P>
<P>
   If a deal were struck, ThyssenKrupp would become an industrial
powerhouse with a vastly strengthened car business, which is more
profitable than its steel business.
</P>
<P>
   Neither company would disclose how much ThyssenKrupp's offer is
worth, though analysts said that Atecs could be valued at about $10
billion. The Financial Times, which first reported ThyssenKrupp's
overture to Vodafone Friday, said the German company had offered 9
billion euros, or about $8.7 billion. The Atecs stock offering has
yet to priced.
</P>
<P>
   ThyssenKrupp said in a statement: ``Against a background of
rapidly changing markets, ThyssenKrupp is firmly convinced that
joining forces would create a leading international supplier.''
</P>
<P>
   Mannesmann is against selling its industrial unit to
ThyssenKrupp. A spokesman for Mannesmann said ``Atecs Mannesmann
and ThyssenKrupp don't fit together.''
</P>
<P>
   Several analysts disagreed, though, arguing that a
ThyssenKrupp-Atecs tie-up would be a natural fit and a quicker and
cleaner way for Vodafone to dispose of Atecs than by offering
shares to the public.
</P>
<P>
   Vodafone, the world's leading mobile telephone company, pursued
Mannesmann aggressively because it saw the German company's highly
successful mobile phone business, the biggest in Germany, as a
crucial strategic acquisition. Vodafone had no desire to keep
Atecs, which Mannesmann had been planning to divest anyway.
</P>
<P>
   ThyssenKrupp itself is a result of a hostile offer.
ThyssenKrupp's co-chief executive, Gerhard Cromme, led a hostile
bid for Thyssen about two years ago when he was the chief executive
of Hoesch-Krupp. The merger was eventually agreed upon in a
friendly transaction after it had created an uproar among Germany's
steelworkers.
</P>
<P>
   Shares of ThyssenKrupp dropped 2 percent to 25.60 euros, or
$24.83 in Frankfurt while Vodafone also fell less than 1 percent to
368.25 pounds, or $581.84 in London.

COMMENTARY: `HATRED IN ACTION' 
</HEADLINE>
  (jt) 
 By ANTHONY LEWIS    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ Ronald D. Rotunda, a law professor at the University of
Illinois, was an ethics adviser to Kenneth Starr. The other day he
made an extraordinary attack on federal judges in Washington.
Writing on the Op Ed page of The Wall Street Journal, he said
judges appointed by President Clinton had dealt improperly _
politically _ with cases important to him. The headline was,
``Another Clinton Victim: The Integrity of the Federal Courts.''
</P>
<P>
   Rotunda's main target was U.S. District Judge James Robertson. I
know Robertson, and I know his high reputation for integrity, so I
decided to look into Rotunda's charges. I found that they were a
farrago of untruths.
</P>
<P>
   Robertson handled the 1998 tax fraud prosecution of Webster
Hubbell and three others by the independent counsel. Rotunda
charged that the judge had acted improperly to delay and prevent a
trial of the case.
</P>
<P>
   ``The transcript reads as if Robertson had decided that the case
was not going to trial,'' Rotunda wrote. ``He just had not decided
why.''
</P>
<P>
   The transcript to which the professor refers begins with
arraignment of the defendants on May 8, 1998. Their lawyers said
they would file motions challenging the legal basis of the
prosecution. Robertson allowed them just three weeks to do so.
</P>
<P>
   David Barger, an assistant to Starr, asked the court to set an
early trial date. Robertson said he would consider that at a status
conference on June 2, four days after the motions were due. At that
conference Barger suggested a trial date ``around Oct. 5.''
Robertson said, ``Oct. 5 is your date.''
</P>
<P>
   No unbiased person could read that transcript and think that the
judge set out to delay or prevent a trial. In fact, he set an
unusually tight schedule for a case involving four defendants and
complex documentary evidence. And the schedule was satisfactory to
the independent counsel.
</P>
<P>
   A month after the motions were filed, Robertson dismissed the
prosecution on the ground, among others, that the Fifth Amendment
barred the use against Hubbell of business records he had been
forced to produce. The Court of Appeals reversed that decision _
but imposed tough requirements on the prosecution to prove that its
evidence was constitutionally untainted. In the end Starr accepted
a plea of guilty to a misdemeanor tax offense, with Hubbell paying
a $25 fee.
</P>
<P>
   Then Rotunda had what he called ``another eyebrow-raiser.''
Clinton appointees to the D.C. District Court, he said, held
``monthly caucuses from which other federal judges were excluded.''
The implication was that they plotted.
</P>
<P>
   Here again the truth is otherwise. The newer judges had lunch
together a few times. They were not ``caucuses,'' they did not
occur monthly and no court business was discussed.
</P>
<P>
   Somehow, Rotunda failed to mention that the charge of improper
meetings had been examined by the acting chief judge of the Court
of Appeals, Stephen F. Williams, a Reagan appointee, and dismissed
last November as ``frivolous.'' ``Reasonable observers do not take
so cynical a view of the judiciary,'' Williams wrote.
</P>
<P>
   Williams also dismissed another charge repeated by Professor
Rotunda: that the chief judge of the District Court, Norma Holloway
Johnson, had improperly taken the Hubbell case and others out of
the random assignment system and given them to judges appointed by
President Clinton. The court's rules permitted such special
assignments for difficult cases, and Williams noted that the judges
who got those cases had less crowded dockets.
</P>
<P>
   Williams is now looking at the assignment issue again, at the
request of a congressman. But whatever he does cannot affect
another Rotunda falsehood.
</P>
<P>
   Rotunda wrote that the rule allowing non-random assignment of
difficult cases in Washington had been changed last month ``in a
stunning rebuke'' to Johnson. There was no rebuke. The D.C. court
simply changed its rules to conform with a resolution adopted a
year ago by the Judicial Conference of the United States. The
court's new rule was proposed by another judge attacked by Rotunda,
Paul L. Friedman.
</P>
<P>
   Why would Rotunda engage in the cowardly business of making
false, political charges against judges? I can only assume that, in
working for Starr, he was infected by the right's hatred of Clinton
_ and its frustration that not even a majority of the Senate voted
to remove him from office. And why would the editors of The Wall
Street Journal publish such vile trash? Hate, again, must be the
answer.

POPE REPEATS 2,000-YEAR-OLD MESSAGE TO 100,000 PILGRIMS

<P>
   MOUNT OF THE BEATITUDES, Israel _ Standing on a hill overlooking
the Sea of Galilee on Friday, Pope John Paul II urged more than
100,000 pilgrims to act on Jesus' revolutionary message to become
gentle peacemakers and to return evil with good.
</P>
<P>
   Monico Villarreal, a 45-year-old Waxahachie, Texas, truck driver
on a pilgrimage with 150 other Texans, said he was overwhelmed and
amazed to be standing on the Mount of the Beatitudes, hearing the
age-old message of the Sermon on the Mount.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's like I'm seeing something that had not happened for 2,000
years,'' said Villarreal, one of 31 members of the St. Joseph's
Catholic Church in the town near Dallas attending the event.
</P>
<P>
   The pope's message was based mainly on Jesus' famous sermon,
delivered near the same spot centuries ago and recorded in the Book
of Matthew.
</P>
<P>
   ``Blessed are the poor in spirit, for theirs is the kingdom of
heaven,'' Jesus declared to the large crowd gathered from Galilee,
the Decapolis, Jerusalem, Judea and across the Jordan River.
</P>
<P>
   The theme of religious unity, which has been a hallmark of John
Paul's historic visit to Israel, continued as the pope celebrated
Mass. Christian, Jews and Muslim groups gathered to see and hear
the pontiff. Flags and banners were displayed from Canada, the
United States, Great Britain, Croatia, Spain, Uruguay, Russia,
Chile, Poland, Hungary, Australia and many other nations.
</P>
<P>
   John Paul, in a climactic moment of his weeklong pilgrimage to
the Holy Land, said new life will come to Christians if they follow
Jesus' teachings.
</P>
<P>
   It's a strange message to some, the 79-year-old pontiff
declared. ```Blessed are you!' he says, `all you who are poor in
spirit, gentle and merciful, you who mourn, who care for what is
right, who are pure in heart, who make peace, you who are
persecuted! Blessed are you!' ''
</P>
<P>
   ``It is strange that Jesus exalts those whom the world generally
regards as weak. He says to them, `Blessed are you who seem to be
losers, because you are the true winners: the kingdom of heaven is
yours!'''
</P>
<P>
   .MDNM/ In the audience were thousands of young people who
participated in a worldwide event to mark the coming of the new
century.
</P>
<P>
   Despite his infirmities and age, John Paul has become a hero to
the young.
</P>
<P>
   Even though they were smeared with mud from the rainy
conditions, and sleepy from all-night prayers, young people played
drums, sang and shouted ``John Paul II, we love you,'' and ``Viva
el papa'' as the pontiff waved from a popemobile driving him
through the crowd.
</P>
<P>
   The youths broke into loud applause when John Paul arrived at
the red-carpeted platform underneath a 45-foot-high black tent. A
huge picture of a young Jesus and a large cross holding a figure of
Christ dominated the altar.
</P>
<P>
   ``He has the ability to care,'' said delegate Eric Hernandez,
20, who attends Eastfield Community College in Dallas. ``I admire
him, too, because despite his problems, he keeps talking to us.''
</P>
<P>
   When John Paul called for a spiritual change of heart, he
addressed himself to the young.
</P>
<P>
   ``You young people will understand why this change of heart is
necessary,'' he said, ``because you are aware of another voice
within you and all around you. ... It is a voice which says
`Blessed are the proud and the violent, those who prosper at any
cost, who are unscrupulous, pitiless, devious, who make war and not
peace, and persecute those who stand in their way.' ''
</P>
<P>
   John Paul said the secret to following the Beatitudes is
devotion to Jesus.
</P>
<P>
   ``He is the Beatitudes,'' the pope said. ``Looking at him you
will see what it means to be poor in spirit, gentle and merciful,
to mourn, to care for what is right, to be pure in heart, to make
peace, to be persecuted.''
</P>
<P>
   To the diverse crowd, the pope said: ``Please take my prayerful
greeting to the whole Greek-Melchite community. I greet the members
of the Latin community, including the Hebrew-speaking faithful, the
Maronite community, the Syrian community, the Armenian community,
the Chaldean community. ... I extend a special word of thanks to
our Muslim friends ... and to members of the Jewish faith and the
Druze community.''
</P>
<P>
   Hugo Monsanto, an architect from Waxahachie who was escorting a
group of young people, said the pope's message will encourage all
to make the new century a time of spiritual growth.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a strong word for us, and I hope we follow it,'' said
Monsanto, who is a permanent deacon in the Catholic Church.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the pope of the millennium,'' said Cesar Gomez of
Panama, who brought his wife and three of his children to the
event. Pointing to the young people, he said, ``Here you see the
future of the world.''
</P>
<P>
   .MDNM/Octavio Ocon, 15, of San Francisco, said of John Paul:
``He has a great soul.''

   MOUNT OF THE BEATITUDES, Israel _ Standing where Jesus Christ is
said to have told followers, ``Blessed are the meek, for they shall
inherit the earth,'' Pope John Paul II warned a youthful multitude
on Friday against heeding what he called ``contradictory''
beatitudes lurking in the modern Holy Land.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is the voice which says, `Blessed are the proud and
violent, those who prosper at any cost, who are unscrupulous,
pitiless, devious, who make war, not peace, and persecute those who
stand in their way,''' the pope said, speaking to thousands of
pilgrims from a platform overlooking the shimmering Sea of Galilee.
``And this voice seems to make sense in a world where the violent
are often triumphant and the devious seem to succeed.''
</P>
<P>
   The pope described this as ``the choice between good and evil,
between life and death,'' and asked which voice the young people
would obey.
</P>
<P>
   The pope's version of the Sermon on the Mount was his first
public Mass in Israel, part of a week-long pilgrimage to retrace
the steps of Jesus Christ.
</P>
<P>
   His trip, the first official visit by a pope to Israel, has had
extraordinary political resonance in Israel as well as in
Palestinian-controlled territories, where the pope held a Mass and
visited a refugee camp on Tuesday. The pope's visit has also been
enormously important to Christians who constitute a tiny minority
in Israel and had never experienced an outdoor Mass like this.
</P>
<P>
   An estimated 100,000 pilgrims arrived here as early as 3 a.m.
and gathered on grassy slopes left muddy from overnight rain.
</P>
<P>
   They seemed to have traveled from everywhere and included not
only Palestinians from Israel and the West Bank but also Lebanese
Christians who were allowed to cross the tense border from southern
Lebanon. There was also a scattering of U.N. peacekeepers,
recognizable by their blue berets.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Nazrin Touba, 33, who works in an orphanage in Nazareth, arrived
in a bus with other Arab Christians at 3 a.m. Touba, who was pushed
up against a fence by the exuberant crowd, explained why she and
her friends had come to the Sea of Galilee, when the pope is
scheduled to come to Nazareth Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're afraid we might not be able to see him in Nazareth,''
she said. ``The security may be so strict that we won't be able to

</P>
<P>
   Other pilgrims came from Romania, Guam, the Philippines, Italy
and the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Marina Danese, 33, an Italian homemaker from Milan, said she had
left her family behind in Milan, Italy. ``I could see the pope
anytime I want in Italy,'' Danese said, ``but I could never again
see him in the place where Jesus lived.''

   At the Mass site, blue-and-white Israeli flags fluttered near
the Vatican's yellow-and-white banners. Red-white-and-black
Palestinian flags were scattered among the crowd, along with a
banner that read, ``The uprooted people of Kfar Bire'm welcome John
Paul II.''
</P>
<P>
   The banner mentioning Kfar Bire'm, a village occupied by the new
state of Israel in 1948, came down halfway through the Mass, which
was tightly controlled by Israeli police officers. Israeli
officials described the papal visit as the largest security
operation in the country's history.
</P>
<P>
   A black canopy was pitched over the pope's altar and platform,
and bulletproof glass shielded him on both sides as he spoke. The
Vatican almost always rejects such measures. The only other time
the Vatican allowed bulletproof screens near the altar was in
Detroit in 1987.
</P>
<P>
   After the Mass, the pope met with Prime Minister Ehud Barak, who
outlined the status of Israel's peace negotiations with the
Palestinians and Syria and asked for the pope's assistance in
learning about the fate of Israeli soldiers missing in action,
including a tank crew in 1982 and a pilot captured in 1986.
</P>
<P>
   Saying that the pope's visit has ``immense historical
importance,'' the prime minister added, ``I believe it might help
make the atmosphere much better in the world, in relations between
Jews and Christians and in regard to the peace process.''
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Since the pope arrived in Israel from Jordan on Tuesday, both
Jewish and Palestinian leaders have pushed their competing claims
over Jerusalem. The argument even seeped into an interreligious
meeting meant to promote harmony among Jews, Christians and Muslims
that ended after a Jewish rabbi and a Muslim cleric clashed and the
cleric left abruptly.
</P>
<P>
   The pope's spokesman, Joaquin Navarro-Valls, said that if such
problems are real, he could hardly avoid them. ``It would be a
fiction to walk on the clouds and not on the earth,'' Navarro-Valls
said.
</P>
<P>
   But Friday was reserved for stops at sites near the Sea of
Galilee associated with the ministry of Jesus and his disciples.

   The frail 79-year-old pope held up remarkably well on the fifth
day of his weeklong pilgrimage. He delivered his homily in a
strong, distinct voice and even negotiated 30 steps with the help
of his cane to pray at a chapel after his lakeside meeting with
Barak.
</P>
<P>
   The pope stopped to pray at Tapgha, the limestone church built
on the site where Jesus was believed to have performed the miracle
of feeding the multitude of 5,000 with five barley loaves and two
small fishes, according to the Gospel of John.
</P>
<P>
   At the Church of the Primacy, the pope kissed the sprawling rock
where tradition says a resurrected Jesus shared a festive meal of
fish with his apostles.
</P>
<P>
   According to the Gospels, after that meal Jesus asked Peter to
succeed him as leader of the church.
</P>
<P>
   At dusk, the pope arrived at Capernaum to the tolling of bells
from a nearby Greek Orthodox church. He prayed at the ruins of what
was believed to be the house where Peter lived. As the pope prayed,
a group of Vatican prelates surrounded his armchair and sang ``Tu
es Petrus,'' the Latin rendition of the words Jesus is supposed to
have used to select Peter as the first pope.
</P>
<P>
   The pope was given an oil lamp dating to the time of Christ and
a stone from the house by the Stanislao Loffreda, 68, the
Franciscan archaeologist who discovered the ruins in 1968, five
years after the pope, then a young bishop in Krakow, made a
pilgrimage to the Holy Land. After the meeting, Loffreda said the
pope told him, ``If your health permits it, keep digging.''

 &HT;    POLITICAL TICKER: Strong support for Coelho from Gore
 &HT;    (EDs: A brief roundup of the day's campaign events, pulled from
Cox staff and wire reports.)
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Al Gore said today his campaign chairman, Tony Coelho, is doing
a ``terrific job'' and suggested Coelho would remain with his
presidential campaign despite a criminal investigation into past
financial dealings. Asked if he was concerned about the possibility
of criminal wrongdoing, Gore refused to elaborate on his statement,
saying, ``He's doing a great job and he will keep on doing so.''
George W. Bush, asked today about Gore's problems regarding Coelho
and an investigation of White House e-mail, said: ``The best way to
make sure we get rid of all these investigations is to change
administrations.''
</P>
<P>
   BACK TO CENTRAL HIGH
</P>
<P>
   George W. Bush was at Little Rock's Central High School today,
urging a national commitment to battle ``a tremendous gap of
achievement between rich and poor, between white and minority.''
</P>
<P>
   He said that four decades after the racial standoff there was
resolved by federal intervention, ``We have a great challenge of
our own. Access is universal, but excellence is not.'' Central
High's front steps were the scene of a national standoff in
September 1957 when Arkansas Gov. Orval Faubus ordered the National
Guard to prevent nine black students from entering the building
under a desegregation plan. President Eisenhower responded by
sending in the Army to open up the school.
</P>
<P>
   CHASE FOR CAMPAIGN CASH
</P>
<P>
   Despite heightened voter interest in fund-raising reform, both
candidates have stepped up their chase for the big bucks. Al Gore
was in Houston today to scoop up more than $500,000 in ``soft
money'' for the Democratic National Committee. Meanwhile, George W.
Bush has hit the money circuit with events Thursday in Palm Beach,
Fla., and today in Little Rock, Ark. His appearances are expected
to net $1 million.
</P>
<P>
   PUBLIC-PRIVATE DIFFERENCES
</P>
<P>
   Even as the Republican Party relentlessly criticized Democrats
for taking big donations from foreigners during the 1996 election,
its lawyers argued in a filing with the Federal Election Commission
that excaped public attention last year that such contributions
should be considered legal: ``Foreign national donations to party
committee non-federal accounts are legally permissible.'' The quiet
reversal has left Democrats crying foul. ``What it looks like
they're doing here is selective outrage at best and utter hypocrisy
at worst,'' said Democratic spokeswoman Jenny Backus. ``It has
always been the policy of the RNC not to accept foreign national
contributions,'' said Republican spokesman Mike Collins.
</P>
<P>
   PROSPERITY CAN SWING BOTH WAYS
</P>
<P>
   The rosy economy seems a double-edged sword for George W. Bush.
With continued low employment and the stock market moving above
11,000 again, Bush is finding plenty of Republicans with a lot of
cash. But these good times also are boosting Al Gore's presidential
hopes, and Bush wants voters to think about other issues as well as
their pocketbooks: ``The pundits _ they keep saying we're going to
have a tough time winning because the Dow Jones industrial average
is high, but that doesn't lift the spirit of America. And it
shouldn't obscure the fact that some kids can't read in our
society. It doesn't say anything about the military and our
preparedness to keep the peace.''
</P>
<P>
   MCCAIN'S BACK, AND OUT FOR BEAR
</P>
<P>
   Back in the Senate less than a week, John McCain is also back to
making his point that campaign finance rules need an overhaul.
McCain says he'll vote against confirming Republican Bradley Smith,
a Federal Election Commission nominee who opposes campaign finance
reform. McCain told reporters he would do everything he could to
defeat Smith on the grounds that he is against tightening
fund-raising rules. Smith is strongly backed by senior Senate
Republicans, including Majority Leader Trent Lott and Mitch
McConnell of Kentucky, perhaps the Senate's strongest opponent of
campaign financing reform.
</P>
<P>
   SUPPORT, BUT TEPID SUPPORT
</P>
<P>
   John McCain cast himself as a vigorous campaigner for the
Republican congressional majority and insisted he is ``not
interested in harming'' George W. Bush's candidacy. But in an
hourlong interview with the New York Times, McCain acknowledged
several times that he was walking a ``very careful line'' in trying
to be loyal to his party while still remaining true to the
insurgent cause that attracted millions of new voters to the
Republican primaries this year. McCain said he wants to fight to
change the Republican Party from the inside. And he said the
difference between an endorsement of Bush and his assurance this
week that he would support his party's nominee was a difference in
``the degree of enthusiasm.''
</P>
<P>
   MCCAIN CLAWING TO KEEP DELEGATES
</P>
<P>
   As Michigan Republicans began meeting to choose delegates for
the Republican National Convention, some backers of John McCain
worry that George W. Bush's supporters will get the seats that
should go to them. McCain spokesman Todd Harris suspected Thursday
that Gov. John Engler _ one of Bush's biggest advocates in the
state _ may be trying to get Bush supporters into some of the
delegate spots that McCain earned by winning Michigan's GOP
presidential primary last month. McCain picked up 52 of the state's
58 convention delegates. Engler spokesman John Truscott said there
was no move afoot to challenge McCain supporters vying for delegate
spots.
</P>
<P>
   POLES APART ON NEEDING POLLS
</P>
<P>
   George W. Bush often says he doesn't need polls to tell him how
to run his campaign, but polls conducted by the GOP have been
steering Bush's latest attacks on Al Gore. ``This is a man who will
say anything to get elected,'' has been a recurring theme in Bush
speeches. That's because the line was tested and shown to be
effective in a Republican poll taken last month, according to ABC
News. In a speech in Florida last week, Bush repeated the line four
times in 20 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   JUDGE POISED IN REFORM PARTY STRUGGLE
</P>
<P>
   Comparing the case to a divorce, a federal judge in Lynchburg,
Va., said he'll rule Monday on who controls the Reform Party in a
bitter feud that pit two factions against one another. ``What we
have here in this case are honorable people who are divided in
beliefs on which way the party should go,'' said U.S. District
Judge Norman Moon. Jack Gargan, the party chairman ousted at a
raucous meeting last month in Nashville, and Pat Choate, the man
who replaced him, now run parallel chairmanships complete with
dueling ``official'' party Web sites and plans for rival nominating
conventions. Each side claims ownership of $2.5 million in federal
funding, most of which is held in the custody of the court. The
party's presidential nominee also will receive $12.6 million for
the general election.
</P>
<P>
   BOTH SIDES DRINK FROM THE TROUGH
</P>
<P>
   Congress is unlikely to change laws governing White House
reimbursement for campaign travel despite election-year criticism
of Hillary Clinton's modest payments for using Air Force planes in
connection with her campaign for the Senate. Congressional
Republicans ordered a special inquiry to examine the first lady's
reimbursement for travel to New York state in her Senate race
against Rudy Giuliani. But Rep. Jim Kolbe (R-Ariz.), chairman of
the House Appropriations Committee's panel on White House
operations, conceded that Congress has little inclination to
overturn the reimbursement scheme that effectively subsidizes
political travel by Republicans and Democrats both when they serve
in the White House.
</P>
<P>
   HARD LINE ON OIL PRODUCERS
</P>
<P>
   Reform Party presidential candidate Pat Buchanan promised to
slap new tariffs on oil-producing nations that systematically
withhold their product. In San Francisco, Buchanan charged a global
conspiracy to inflate oil prices, and pledged to cut financial aid,
including World Bank and International Monetary Fund loans, to any
country he deemed part of a plot to ``withhold oil and gouge the
American people.''
</P>
<P>
   BUSH SECURITY A STATE BUDGET ITEM
</P>
<P>
   Texans have spent $1.3 million so far this year on security for
George W. Bush while he campaigned for president. The amount is
more than four times the $286,000 that it cost to protect Bush and
his family in 1998, when he was not a presidential candidate for
president. As of Monday, the state has spent $3.9 million on
security for the Bushes in the 15-month period beginning in January
1999, according to new figures from the Texas Department of Public
Safety. Costs to Texas should decrease now that the Secret Service
has taken over security for Bush. The DPS still protects his
family, however.
</P>
<P>
   SOCIAL SECURITY INSECURITY
</P>
<P>
   Al Gore, accustomed to the Democratic Party's upper hand on
Social Security, bitterly derided George W. Bush as Bush staked his
own claim on that issue. Any school child could ``go to the
blackboard and demonstrate how his numbers don't add up,'' Gore
contended. Battling in Cincinnati for the favor of senior citizens,
who reliably vote in powerful numbers, Gore alleged that the only
way Bush could pay for his proposed tax cuts would be through
massive budget deficits or Social Security cutbacks. Bush, in
Orlando, Fla., countered that Gore was naive to think he can save
the program for future retirees simply by throwing money at the
Social Security Trust Fund. ``People need to ask, `Who's the
reformer in the race' '' he said.
</P>
<P>
   POLLS FINDING BUSH SLIPPAGE
</P>
<P>
   Now that the smoke from the nomination battles has cleared, Al
Gore has opened up a small lead over George W. Bush in a new
national survey. The latest Pew Research Center poll (4 percentage
point margin of error) found Gore up 49-43 percent. The 6-point
edge is Gore's largest in matchups for the fall election, but other
polls indicate that the race to be a virtual dead heat, and in at
least two recent national surveys Bush was leading Gore. A common
thread running through all the polls, however, has been a drop in
support for Bush since the primaries began.
</P>
<P>
   THE CANDIDATES _ IN A WORD
</P>
<P>
   Voters are starting to tell pollsters George W. Bush is
``cocky'' and ``arrogant.'' Some 31 percent of respondents in the
Pew Research Center survey chose a negative term when asked the one
word that best described him, compared to 12 percent who thought of
a negative term first a year ago. While the majority of references
to Bush were positive, the most frequently mentioned negative words
were ``arrogant,'' ``dislike,'' ``untrustworthy,'' ``wimp,''
``bad'' or ``cocky.'' The most frequently mentioned negative word
for Al Gore was ``boring,'' and ``dull'' was second, tied with
``politician'' _undefined as to positive or negative. Next on the
negative list for Gore came ``dishonest'' and ``incompetent.''
</P>
<P>
   HIGHER ENTHUSIASM FOR BUSH
</P>
<P>
   George W. Bush's supporters are more likely to feel strongly
about their support than are voters who favor Al Gore, according to
the latest poll for Hotline, the online political tip sheet. The
poll, taken March 16-19 by Democratic pollster Jef Pollock and
Republican pollster Kellyanne Fitzpatrick, found that 59 percent of
Bush supporters held that position strongly, as against 49 percent
of Gore backers. The poll also found that voters who said John
McCain was their first choice for president were evenly split when
asked to choose between Bush and Gore. The poll's margin of error
was 3.1 percentage points.
</P>
<P>
   TURNING BACK THE CLOCK
</P>
<P>
   The race for the White House is turning into a race against the
past. Al Gore is running as much against former President George
Bush as he is against George W. Bush, working feverishly to remind
voters that the last Republican president presided over a recession
and record budget deficits _ and arguing that the son would bring
back the father's sins. But the campaign against the elder Bush may
not be the sure-fire winner it was eight years ago. Many voters
have forgotten hard times, but remember what it was like to have a
devoted family man in the Oval Office, and the elder Bush is more
popular now than when he left office. The younger Bush counts on
that sentiment, and runs as much against Bill Clinton as against
Gore.
</P>
<P>
   LOOKY HERE_ FREE AIR TIME
</P>
<P>
   Congressional and gubernatorial candidates will be provided with
five minutes of free air time this year on the 18 television
stations across the country owned by the Belo Corp. Expanding an
initiative it began in 1996, Belo, which also publishes the Dallas
Morning News and the Providence Journal, will turn over a
five-minute block of news programming to each qualified candidate
during the final 45 days of the campaign. In the pilot project four
years ago, six of Belo's stations provided 73 candidates with more
than six hours of free air time.
</P>
<P>
   SCRAMBLE IN SOUTH CAROLINA
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Mark Sanford, a Republican from South Carolina, became a
well-known figure around the state earlier this year because of his
maverick support for John McCain. But rather than exploit his
popularity, he is, at least for the moment, according to the New
York Times, leaving politics in keeping with a promise to serve no
more than three terms. The prospect of filling a rare open seat has
attracted seven Republicans to the June 13 primary. Leading
contenders: H.B. Limehouse, a former transportation commissioner,
and state Rep. Henry Brown. The winner will likely face Andy Brack,
the Charleston County Democratic chairman.
</P>
<P>
   YOU KNOW WHO YOU'RE MESSING WITH?
</P>
<P>
   A campaign staffer for Al Gore threatened a Nashville police
officer during a DUI arrest, saying she worked for Gore and would
report the officer to the U.S. district attorney, police police
say.
</P>
<P>
   Anupama Rangappa, 25, was charged on March 11 with driving under
the influence and refusing to take a breath-alcohol test, the
report says. The Tennessean newspaper said she is from Virginia,
but has been working as a scheduler in Gore's campaign headquarters
in Nashville.
</P>
<P>
   BRADLEY KEEPING STAFF PRESENCE
</P>
<P>
   Bill Bradley's campaign announced that it will maintain a staff
presence as the ex-candidate, who is on vacation, closes down his
campaign. A statement from Bradley's campaign headquarters in West
Orange, N.J., said Rick Wright has been named chief of staff for
the Bill Bradley for President Committee. Bradley has not released
his delegates.

bond market, with the price of the benchmark 30-year Treasury bond

CLINTON URGES PAKISTAN TO RETURN TO DEMOCRATIC ELECTIONS 

</HEADLINE>

<P>
   BOMBAY, India _ President Clinton, completing the Indian legs of
his South Asian journey Saturday, moved on to Pakistan to press its
military ruler for a timetable for national elections and a return
to democratic government.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are worried about the future of Pakistan,'' said Clinton's
national security adviser, Samuel R. Berger. A senior
administration official even suggested that Pakistan's economy is
so precarious that the Islamic nation might ``fail.''
</P>
<P>
   After about five hours in Islamabad, the Pakistani capital,
Clinton was to fly on to Geneva, where he will meet Sunday with
President Hafez el-Assad in hopes of getting peace talks restarted
between Syria and Israel.
</P>
<P>
   In the wrap-up to a five-day state visit, the president focused
Friday on ``New India,'' dropping by HI-TEC City in Hyderabad and
talking to business leaders at the nation's biggest stock exchange
in this city of 15 million on the Indian Ocean.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton said $4 billion in private business deals were struck on
the sidelines of his trip.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
(BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM) &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   White House officials said one was a gas supply agreement worth
$75 million between Enron Gas Marketing Company Private Ltd., an
arm of the Houston-based energy giant, and Ispat Energy Ltd.
</P>
<P>
   The gas will be used for a power-generating plant in Bombay.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
(END OPTIONAL TRIM) &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Near the end of his trip to the world's most populous democracy,
Clinton expressed just one regret: ``I desperately wanted to ride
on an elephant's back. I've always wanted to do that.'' Clinton
told reporters that his staff, afraid he would look silly atop a
pachyderm, talked him out of getting aboard one of the mammoth's.
He was chagrined that some of those aides themselves went for
elephant rides.
</P>
<P>
   By stopping in Pakistan, a move some in the administration
opposed, Clinton faced not only the nation's five-month-old
military dictatorship but also one of the knottiest and bloodiest
regional confrontations _ the clash between India and Pakistan over
the disputed province of Kashmir. The face-off, with its almost
daily skirmishes, became graver in May 1998 when first India and
then Pakistan tested a nuclear weapon.
</P>
<P>
   Although Indian leaders earlier in the week upbraided Clinton
for calling the Kashmir dispute perhaps the most dangerous in the
world, a new government-sponsored survey shows many average Indians
share his view. The Indian Office of Research reported the
three-quarters of the respondents in a poll earlier this month feel
it likely that Kashmir will lead to a war between Indian and
Pakistan ``in the near future.''
</P>
<P>
   During Clinton's visit to New Delhi, the Indian capital earlier
this week, 40 Sikhs were killed in a village on the Indian side of
the Kashmir cease-fire line. India blamed terrorist groups, at
least one of which it said was based in Pakistan. The Pakistan
government denied having any role.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton, aware that he cannot act as intermediary for unwilling
parties, planned to ask the Pakistani Army general, Pervez
Musahrraf, who came to power last October in a coup, to consider
direct talks with India on Kashmir.
</P>
<P>
   The White House insisted that Clinton's stop was meant to
encourage the Pakistani people to persevere in the face of an
unelected government, and Clinton planned a television broadcast.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think we can turn our back on the Pakistani people
with whom we've had a very strong relationship,'' Berger said. He
referred to close U.S. ties to Pakistan, and especially its
military, during the Cold War. While India aggressively proclaimed
its non-aligned status and sometimes courted Moscow, Pakistan
generally was a faithful U.S. ally.
</P>
<P>
   Now, Berger said, ``it's a country that's in trouble and really
needs to put all of its energy into self-renewal, not territorial
conflicts. They don't have the luxury of that.'' He said Clinton
will ``convey some hard realities to Musharraf and to talk directly
to the Pakistani people about the hard choices they face.''
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the nature of persuasion,'' Berger said, to say to
Musharraf ``that you'll have a stronger basis generally on which to
address these problems if people can see a clear road map back to a
democratic government.''
</P>
<P>
   Musharraf announced Thursday that local elections will begin
late this year, marking a move away from martial law, and he said
that broader elections would follow, but he did not spell out a
timetable for returning the national government to elected
officials.
</P>
<P>
   In Geneva, another regional dispute will be on Clinton's agenda.
He will seek to convince Assad to renew his nation's direct talks
with Israel on a peace deal _ which would require settlement of
such thorny issues as an end to Israel's occupation of the Golan
Heights and security guarantees for the Jewish state.
</P>
<P>
   The talks, which were conducted in Shepherdstown, W.Va., broke
off in January when the Israeli and Syrian sides could not even
agree on which of the issues, the Golan or Israeli security, would
be discussed first.
</P>
<P>
   ``The best-case result,'' Berger said, ``is that we have a sense
after the meeting that there is enough common ground ..., that if
we actually resume negotiations, that you could envision them
ending in success.''
</P>
<P>
   As Clinton flew about, ABC News reported his weeklong sojourn
was the most expensive presidential trip ever _ costing an
estimated $50 million. Ninety percent of the tab, the network
reported from Washington, was the almost 80 airplanes used to
airlift the president, his entourage, his vehicles and
communications equipment.
</P>
<P>
   Twenty-six of the Air Force's largest transports, more than a
third of the service's C5s and C17s, were on the flight roster, ABC
said. The network compared it to the humanitarian relief effort for
the Mozambique flooding, in which only about a dozen of the giant
planes were employed.
</P>
<P>
   The cost of the wide-ranging international forays by Clinton,
the nation's most-traveled president, already have drawn complaints
from Republicans in Congress, and the current trip, with its fair
share of sight-seeing, seems likely to renew their displeasure.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton began his visit to Hyderabad with a stop at Mahavir
Hospital where he helped to vaccinate a child against polio, which
because of a massive immunization program, has ebbed as a threat in
India. One thousand cases of polio were reported in India last
year, a dramatic drop over the last decade.
</P>
<P>
   In January, in what the White House described as the biggest
single public health effort in history, more than 149 million
Indian children were vaccinated against polio.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton called for a similar sustained effort against AIDS,
malaria and tuberculosis, because, he said, infectious diseases are
a threat from which ``no nation is immune.''

 &HT;    Brill to retire from Home Depot
 &HT;    By Patti Bond
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Home Depot said Ron Brill, one of the company's founders, plans
to retire next year.
</P>
<P>
   Brill, 56, will step down as executive vice president and chief
administrative officer of the Atlanta-based company in March 2001.
His responsibilities for legal, loss prevention, internal audit and
investor relations will be divided among other executives.
</P>
<P>
   Dubbed the ``financial conscience'' of Home Depot, Brill has
spent much of his career making sure the retailer could afford its
run-and-gun growth. Over the span of about 20 years, Home Depot has
opened more than 950 stores.
</P>
<P>
   Brill has held the positions of controller, vice president of
finance, treasurer, executive vice president and chief financial
officer. The one-year notice will help the home improvement
retailer spread out Brill's duties.
</P>
<P>
   ``After all the time I've spent here, I didn't think I could
just leave the company (immediately),'' Brill said. ``This way, I
can slow down a little bit each month instead of stopping dead in
my tracks.''
</P>
<P>
   He holds 1,532,000 company shares, worth $98.6 million at
Friday's closing price of $68.38. Brill has options on an
additional 829,000 shares.
</P>
<P>
   Brill, who worked as a teenager at his father's hardware store
in New Jersey, had an early stake in the rags-to-riches story of
Home Depot. In the late 1970s, he was fired, along with co-founders
Bernie Marcus and Arthur Blank, from Handy Dan Improvement Centers
after a personality clash with their boss.
</P>
<P>
   That sent Marcus and Blank, now chairman and chief executive,
respectively, on a desperate mission to build a bigger and better
home improvement store. A former accountant with Arthur Andersen &AMP;
Co., Brill was enlisted to make the numbers work.
</P>
<P>
   ``I grew up in a hardware store and ended up co-founding the
largest hardware store in the world,'' he said. ``Obviously this is
a difficult decision, but I'm 56 years old and have a lot of things
that I'd still like to do.'' He didn't identify specific business
plans.
</P>
<P>
   Brill said he won't seek re-election to the Home Depot board,
which he has been on since 1984.

THE WELL-OFF HUNT FOR LOW-COST FASHION SHOPPING 
</HEADLINE>
  (jt) 
 By RUTH LA FERLA    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ ``I am on the Aegean, wearing big sunglasses, and I
have on something turquoise with lots of jewelry, lots of flash.
I'm very tan.''
</P>
<P>
   Jane Schub purred, spinning a fantasy that conjured Mariangela
Melato, honey-bronzed and drenched in gold, in the movie ``Swept
Away.'' As she spoke she toyed with the bauble that triggered her
vision: a gold mesh bracelet that a screen goddess might wear.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'll take it,'' she said, tossing it onto a scale with her
other acquisitions: 14-karat gold ear hoops and a ribbed cigar-band
ring _ a gleaming Bulgari look-alike. The tally for her haul at
Sam's Club in Fishkill, N.Y., where gold jewelry is sold by the
gram: $211.
</P>
<P>
   Schub, a partner in Jules &AMP; Jane, a small cosmetics company,
drops in on Sam's Club, part of the Wal-Mart-owned national chain,
routinely, her eye always peeled for a fashion bargain. A vast
consumer citadel stocked to its vaulted ceilings with wall safes,
televisions, bedding and barbecues, Sam's seems at first glance an
unpromising venue for style.
</P>
<P>
   But Schub knows better. On a recent Friday, she was as cunning
as a bobcat, prowling the aisles and pouncing on twin sets and
raincoats, sandals and mules _ anything at all that caught her eye.
</P>
<P>
   Typical of a new breed of affluent fashion maven, she is as
likely to shop at off-price outlets like T.J. Maxx, which sell
designer labels, and at discounters like Target, which produce
their own wares, as she is to cruise Jeffrey or Kirna Zabete, those
outposts of downtown chic. Increasingly shrewd, such women are
driven by value, naturally _ but perhaps even more by the thrill of
the chase. Many revel in frequenting the kinds of stores where
their stylish peers would shudder to be seen. They view the store
as an arena in which to show off their prowess at the hunt, and
regard their catch _ a cashmere sweater for $20 at Target! a vinyl
peacoat for $39 at Marshall's! _ as a trophy, the fashion
equivalent of a rare ibex. They fill their oversized carts at
Target with buttery fake leather car coats, track down silky Prada
knockoffs at Zara and Club Monaco and scout handbags at J.
Chuckle's, a Manhattan chain catering to the secretarial set.
</P>
<P>
   When H&AMP;M, fashion's answer to Ikea, opens its giant first
American store on Fifth Avenue on Thursday, the fashion trophy
seekers will doubtless be there, too, snatching up the hot pink
leather trousers ($129), raucously colorful plaid A-line skirts
($17) and chunky steel watches ($19) that are the specialty of this
Stockholm-based purveyor of cheap chic.
</P>
<P>
   ``These women are connoisseurs; they are wearing the Hermes bag,
and they live uptown, but they're asking their driver to take them
to Kmart to shop,'' said Susan Lazar, a New York fashion designer,
who has tagged along with friends on more than one such expedition.
``Even if you're wealthy, shopping on a shoestring is a way of
saying `I'm smart,''' Lazar said.
</P>
<P>
   The kind of customer Lazar described might well earn a
six-figure income. But she prides herself perversely on her knack
for finding caviar at the price of cod. It's a way of showing off
her fashion confidence and her mettle. Consider Michelle Iwicki,
who makes $130,000 a year as an account manager for an information
technology consulting firm in Philadelphia. She can afford the
Calvin Klein silk shirts and pricey dresses she favors, but thinks
nothing of pairing them with sturdy but stylish sandals from
Payless, at $15 a pair.
</P>
<P>
   Iwicki, 32, follows the maxim that it's chic to pay less. So
does the savvy fashion pro Carlyne Cerf de Dudzeele, Marie Claire
magazine's relentlessly practical fashion director. She seasons her
wardrobe with Gucci and Hermes, but she also scours the Gap for
knife-creased trousers, nylon anoraks and T-shirts. On one such
recent style safari, at Broadway and 57th Street, she netted a Gap
nylon parka. ``C'est chic, this is good,'' she said. ``Fifty-nine
dollars _ but who can say it isn't Prada?''
</P>
<P>
   Lazar tracks her quarry as skillfully. In less than 20 minutes
at the open-air market at the intersection of Wooster and Spring
Streets in SoHo, she had zoomed in on a pair of leather-and-fake
tortoise thongs ($27); a silk kerchief halter ($17); and a poodle
cloth coat ($88) that might, in her view, mate well with an Hermes
``Kelly'' bag.
</P>
<P>
   Savings that range from half to less than one-tenth the price of
designer apparel or high-end brands are a compelling incentive to
buy. But these days, mixing high-end labels with inexpensive, good
looking, anonymous wares is also perceived as a badge of
discernment. ``For me shopping at Payless is not just about saving
money,'' Iwicki said. ``It's about not being ordinary.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
</P>
<P>
   Her passion for buying on the cheap comes at a moment when
apparel-buying patterns have changed. ``It's fashionable today to
shop wherever good merchandise is found,'' said Kurt Barnard, the
president of Barnard's Retail Trend Report, which tracks consumer
spending patterns. ``In such an increasingly casual and
value-conscious climate, designer labels have lost some of their
cachet,'' he said. ``Many people today see no difference between a
$2,000 designer and a similar item for $250.'' But others eschew
costly labels as a form of inverse snobbery. ``A few years ago you
showed your sophistication by seeking out designers,'' said Andre
Balazs, the soigne owner of the Mercer Hotel, a favorite haunt of
the fashion elite. ``Now it's really important to show that you're
not beholden to a designer, that you're beyond that,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Shopping is also a form of self-expression, a means of
``creative involvement, of picking things up and making them
yours,'' said Jeff Stone, co-publisher of the Chic Simple series of
books, which illustrate the premise that high style and high prices
are not necessarily synonymous. ``There's flair in shopping at
Target or Wal-Mart and mixing it with Neiman Marcus,'' Stone said.
``That way the person who's buying the clothes is the designer.''
</P>
<P>
   His argument is a leap, to be sure, but not the vault it might
have been a half-dozen years ago. These days, style-sensitized
shoppers are awash in the totems of the good-looking life, from
streamlined Palm Pilots to candy colored Nokia phones to shapely,
contoured brooms. Indeed, style itself has become a commodity, as
accessible _ and disposable _ as a tube of Crest, and as
aggressively marketed. Now Kmart sells orchids for $9.99 just yards
away from its Martha Stewart linens. Target offers tea kettles by
Robert Graves, the architect and designer of upscale housewares,
and more recently the store signed up Philippe Stark, the high
priest of fancy gadget design, to knock off his own sleek
appliances.
</P>
<P>
   ``Taste is no longer the exclusive province of the elite; it's
accessible to everyone, as is the concept of luxury,'' said Howard
L. Davidowitz, a New York retail analyst. Perhaps. But in the world
of apparel, that truth has been slower to root. Paradoxically, in
the last few years, fashion, which customarily spearheads trends,
has lagged behind housewares and furnishings in catering to
consumers' growing appetite for maximum style at minimal price.
</P>
<P>
   Discounters, as Davidowitz pointed out, are indeed beginning to
lure customers with vibrantly colorful, good-looking wares arranged
on clean and spacious sales floors. Still, it takes a real Hawkeye
to sight the Kate Spade look-alike bags or the nifty diamond ear
studs at Target, an even sharper eye to find the python skirt in a
Wal-Mart jungle of racks.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, a nation of passionate style trackers is rising to
the challenge. ``Cheap stores used to carry schlock,'' said Eunice
Ward, 53, a Chicago lawyer who likes to mix her floral patterned
skirt by Marni with leather mules from Nine West and to purchase
her swimsuits at Target. ``But now you can sometimes find what
you're looking for.'' Armed with a small stash of bills and mounds
of confidence, she scours her neighborhood Target for items that
wear well and look good. ``I'm not a slave to designers; I'm a
slave to design,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   One day last week at J. Chuckles, Schub, who put together the
outfits photographed with this article, stormed the racks, bagging,
in the space of five minutes, white leather pants, a black silk
halter, a lined coat in aquamarine cotton and a pair of
zebra-striped silk mules. An ensemble worthy of Michael Kors in his
recent Palm Beach period, it cost her only $145.97. Later that
week, at Sam's Club in Fishkill, she bypassed blue topaz earrings
but couldn't resist a black ribbed cotton cardigan.
</P>
<P>
   ``Very Agnes B,'' she said, ``and look, it has horn buttons.''
Turning it inside out, she failed to find a care label. She
shrugged. ``I'll throw it in the wash if I have to For $9.91, I can
afford to take a chance.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   The modem industry had one of those handwriting-on-the-wall
moments last week as the market leader, the 3Com Corp., announced
that it was getting out. The company said it wanted to concentrate
on higher-growth markets like broadband communications and Internet
telephony, implying that plain old modems, which let computers send
and receive data over wires, had become a boring commodity.
</P>
<P>
   And yet worldwide modem sales nearly doubled in 1999, to 120
million units. That's not high growth?
</P>
<P>
   ``There are a lot of paradoxes in the modem market right now,''
said Ernie Rapiere, an analyst with VisionQuest 2000, a market
research firm based in Moorpark, Calif. Rapiere noted that sales of
modem chip sets, the active ingredients of outboard modems and of
modem cards, games and set-top boxes with built-in communications
capabilities, grew ``as much in 1999 as in any year in the past
10.''
</P>
<P>
   One problem is that prices were falling at the same time, so
fast that higher unit sales did not necessarily translate into
higher revenue or even profitability.
</P>
<P>
   A big part of that price pressure comes from new computers'
learning to do a modem's work without needing modem chip sets.
``The sub-$700 PC and sub-$2,000 notebook went heavily to
host-based modems,'' said Rapiere, using the industry term for
software-only communications arrangements. Sales of host-based
modems quintupled in 1999, to 30 million units, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Software-only modems have existed for years, but until recently
the burden they put on a computer's microprocessor degraded
performance too much for most users. Today's much faster processors
have speed to spare, Rapiere said. ``Unless you're trying to do a
lot of complex things all at once, you're probably not going to
notice.''
</P>
<P>
   To exit the business, 3Com said it would form a joint venture
with Accton of Taiwan and NatSteel Electronics of Singapore that
would buy 3Com's desktop analog modem business, including the U.S.
Robotics brand, and its operations making modems for use in laptop
computers. Together, they had given 3Com some 60 percent of the
market, according to Instat, a market research firm.
</P>
<P>
   The handoff gives competitors an opportunity to gain share, said
Frank Manning, president and chief executive of Zoom Telephonics in
Boston, which sells modems under the Zoom and Hayes brand names.
``What 3Com's doing is taking their valuable shelf space and
selling it off,'' he said. ``Do I think analog modems are a highly
lucrative part of our business? No. But it's very dangerous to just
focus on the high-growth areas and abandon customers when a segment
slows down.''
</P>
<P>
   Manning said there were still ways to differentiate modems,
through better firmware (the programming embedded in the chip set),
better packaging and customer support. A new industrywide technical
standard called V.92, due later this year, will make possible new
features like call-waiting, higher upload speeds and faster
connection setup. ``People think modems are more of a commodity
than they actually are,'' he said. ``There actually is room for
doing a good job.''
</P>
<P>
   Branded modem sales were flat in 1999, at about nine million,
according to VisionQuest; many more were sold bundled into PCs. But
Manning said it was too soon to say broadband services like DSL and
cable had killed off analog modems.
</P>
<P>
   ``The United States is way ahead of the rest of the world in
cable modems and DSL, but it's still true that most people can't
get them,'' Manning said. ``The base Internet functionality five
years from now will still be an analog modem.''

&HT;     RESORT TOWN SEEKS TO CONTROL SPRING BREAK MADNESS 
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   SOUTH PADRE ISLAND, Texas _ On the heels of a national trend,
this Gulf of Mexico beach resort is becoming increasingly fed up
with the trash, traffic and truculence imported by thousands of
Spring Break visitors.
</P>
<P>
   About 250 disgruntled residents, merchants and winter visitors
at a community meeting Wednesday essentially said the time has come
to put the brakes on breakers.
</P>
<P>
   They voiced their outrage with the annual early spring pause in
classes at colleges and high schools, which they say has become
exceedingly lawless and potentially dangerous despite ever-growing
numbers of police officers being deployed to control it.
</P>
<P>
   ``The city has let things go to the point that it's
uncontrollable,'' South Padre Alderman Eddie Dwyer said. ``Public
safety is just totally ignored so we can make a buck.''
</P>
<P>
   Their complaints echo those of other resort communities
throughout the country that are attempting to market Spring Break
to another type of clientele _ those who are not so much young as
young at heart.
</P>
<P>
   That has been done successfully in Port Aransas, where some
unruly students overturned a car and roughed up the driver a decade
ago, forcing the city to take action. Now, young parents and
children play in the surf.
</P>
<P>
   Some South Padre Island residents who attended the meeting said
they are sick of cleaning up the rubbish after accommodating unruly
students. They, too, want to appeal to families.
</P>
<P>
   ``We used to have fun with Spring Break,'' said George Ferguson,
a 31-year resident. ``The last eight years, it's getting worse. Our
city officials have just practically given the town over to the
Spring Breakers.''
</P>
<P>
   He said this year has been the worst yet. He was almost struck
twice while walking in a pedestrian lane. Then he was hassled by
students when he politely asked them to move a car blocking

<P>
   Still, South Padre Mayor Ed Cyganiewicz downplayed community
frustrations at boisterous student behavior, saying Spring Breakers
typically are more defiant during bad weather, such as the type
that struck the island this year.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think I have to start with the positive,'' he said. ``I've
been involved in this 15 years. We've had thousands and thousands
coming down, and we've had (few) deaths and no serious injuries.''
</P>
<P>
   But not everyone believes a low fatality rate is a good measure
of success for a spring holiday. Dwyer pointed out that 49 units at
one condominium development had to be evacuated after kids began
throwing televisions, VCRs, mattresses and other objects out the
windows during a brief power outage.
</P>
<P>
   Dwyer, who owns a restaurant on the island, said he believes any
economic benefits of Spring Break very well may be offset by the
costs of damage control.
</P>
<P>
   The city of South Padre Island, with some 2,100 residents, has
done no study on the economic benefits of Spring Break in 10 years.
</P>
<P>
   ``Smaller businesses haven't really put the pencil to it,''
Dwyer said. ``They think the revenue goes up, but the other
expenses are astronomical.''
</P>
<P>
   Dwyer called for more responsibility on the part of businesses.
As an example of the problem, he pointed out an advertisement for
fake IDs in a local newspaper.
</P>
<P>
   ``People have got to take responsibility for their businesses,''
he said. ``We have bartenders serving people after they're
inebriated.''
</P>
<P>
   Dwyer said it is the air of lawlessness that appears to attract
the students, many of whom are traveling now to countries like
Mexico for Spring Break in search of a lower drinking age and other
lax laws.
</P>
<P>
   ``The businesses you're going to lose by cracking down on these
kids are the ones we don't want around here anyway,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   With cities like Atlanta, Galveston, Texas, Daytona Beach, Fla.,
and Virginia Beach, Va., trying to find strategies to put the
brakes on break, South Padre Island will be looking to them for
help, Dwyer said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We want to reach out and get help from these other
communities, instead of, as the city government has done in the
past, sweeping this under the rug,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Dwyer said he believes he has enough support on the City Council
for the first time in many years to rein in Spring Break. There
will meetings on the subject April 5 and 11.
</P>
<P>
   ``We can have the kids come down here, but they're going to have
to understand that we have laws, too,'' he said.

APPLY NOW. BUT LEARN THE INTEREST RATE LATER.  
 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, MARCH 26) 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Attn: Calif.)   (af)  
 By ROBERT D. HERSHEY Jr.   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   In recent years, consumers have found plenty of reasons to
complain about companies that issue credit cards. High interest
rates. Less time to pay bills (and hefty penalties for being a day
late). Fees for exceeding credit limits. Balances computed in new
ways, to the customer's disadvantage. New, sometimes more onerous
terms when accounts are sold to another company.
</P>
<P>
   Now there is another: difficulty in shopping for the best deal.
</P>
<P>
   Since 1989, federal law has required that issuers disclose
interest rates and other key conditions to potential card holders.
But recently, various companies have taken to listing a wide range
of rates for one or more of their cards and not committing to one
until they have conducted a credit check.
</P>
<P>
   It is akin to a rental car company asking for all sorts of
information before it tells you how much it costs to rent a midsize
car in Phoenix _ and then making you wait two weeks to find out.
</P>
<P>
   No one is saying that the practice is illegal; indeed, it seems
patently reasonable to base the cost of credit on a borrower's
creditworthiness. But critics contend that listing multiple
potential rates _ a practice called risk-based, or tiered, pricing
_ is not what Congress intended.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are seeing a radical shift'' in card marketing, said Ken
McEldowney, executive director of Consumer Action, an advocacy
group based in San Francisco. ``Banks don't quote rates until it's
clear whom they are dealing with. It looks like the free
marketplace is being shuttered, replaced instead with targeted
offers based on your credit history.''
</P>
<P>
   Some experts say that tailoring rates to creditworthiness may be
a result of a welcome democratization of credit, in which consumers
with black marks like garnishments or liens on their records are no
longer necessarily rejected. ``Even people like that now can get a
credit card,'' noted Janis Smith, spokeswoman for the Comptroller
of the Currency.
</P>
<P>
   Federal regulators say they have not received enough complaints
for this issue to register; the 1,620 complaints last year over
national banks' disclosures of credit card terms were mostly about
rate increases on existing accounts.
</P>
<P>
   Still, a consumer is at a disadvantage when applying for a card
without knowing its exact terms. Comparison shopping becomes
difficult.
</P>
<P>
   Consider the Aria cards, Visa cards that Providian Financial
offers only via the Internet. ``You apply _ and then we tell you
what you qualify for,'' Laurie Cole, a spokeswoman for Providian,
said of the four types of Aria cards, which have interest rates of
7.99 to 23.99 percent. ``In order to offer credit to such a broad
spectrum of people, we need to know something about them.''
</P>
<P>
   Cole said that Providian's direct-mail solicitations, to people
who have been at least minimally screened, offer only one rate, but
that balance transfers still need to be, as she put it,
``customized.''
</P>
<P>
   Wells Fargo also bases rates on its judgment of risk after an
introductory 5.9 percent for six months, the rate rises to 12.75,
16.15 percent and 18.15 percent. It typically takes two or three
weeks after applying to learn which rate will be imposed.
</P>
<P>
   The lesson, Smith said, is that consumers cannot assume that all
issuers are alike _ or that they can skip reading the fine print.
``More and more banks are setting individual terms,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   A consumer who is stuck with an unattractive rate, however, has
an option: canceling the card. He should not let it sit in his
wallet; besides accumulating possible annual fees, the card
represents potential borrowing power that could give other lenders
_ say, for a mortgage _ distinct pause.

&HT;     BUSH AND GORE ON EDUCATION: A KEY SIMILARITY 
</HEADLINE>
  
 &HT;     (For release Sunday, March 26)   &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By DAN FREEDMAN  
 &HT;     c.2000 Hearst Newspapers  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ As they stumble over each other to use schools as
campaign backdrops, Vice President Al Gore and Texas Gov. George W.
Bush are as far apart on education as a Democrat and Republican can
get.
</P>
<P>
   Gore would devote $115 billion of the federal budget surplus
over the next 10 years to provide universal access to preschools,
create smaller high schools, improve teacher quality and aid school
reconstruction. Bush opposes big federal education programs,
offering a modest $5.5 billion over five years, and telling voters,
``I'm not running for national superintendent.'' He promises
greater local control over federal education dollars.
</P>
<P>
   But in one crucial education area, the two prospective
presidential nominees are remarkably similar.
</P>
<P>
   Both favor rigorous standardized tests at key grade levels
coupled with sanctions _ including loss of federal funds _ for
low-scoring schools that fail to show improvement.
</P>
<P>
   Both candidates are using this idea of accountability to show
they are centrists on education, an issue that ranks high among
voter concerns in most polls.
</P>
<P>
   For Bush, testing and sanctions are part of his bid to define
himself as a ``compassionate conservative'' _ upping minority test
scores in Texas through state-imposed discipline on schools.
Although the core of accountability was in place when Bush was
first elected governor in 1994, he lists the rise in test scores
among Texas minorities as one of his key accomplishments.
</P>
<P>
   For schools in poor districts that fail to bring up test scores,
Bush would take away federal money earmarked for them to assist
needy, underachieving students. Known as Title I funding, the money
would go directly to parents under the Bush plan. They could use it
for private school tuition or transfer their children to other
public schools.
</P>
<P>
   To Gore, testing and sanctions allow him to position himself as
a hard-nosed centrist, unlike the Republicans' image of liberal
Democrats who throw money at social problems with little care on
whether there is measurable progress.
</P>
<P>
   Gore wants all states to impose high school exit exams _ 26 have
them so far. States and school districts that turn around ``failing
schools'' in poverty zones should get federal dollar bonuses, Gore
says.
</P>
<P>
   Schools with plummeting test scores should be shut down and
reopened with a new principal, intensive training for teachers and,
ultimately, removal of low-performing instructors, Gore says.
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton-Gore administration is spending $134 million this
year trying to turn around low-performing schools that have
significant Title I low-income student enrollments.
</P>
<P>
   School districts failing to show progress by this September risk
possible loss of their share of the administration's $7.9 billion
Title I budget.
</P>
<P>
   Under Department of Education regulations, schools receiving
this money must permit their students to transfer to other public
schools or to special charter schools within the local public
school district.
</P>
<P>
   But therein lies a key difference between the two candidates.
Bush would permit vouchers for private school, but Gore would not.
The Democrats are reluctant to risk offending public school
teachers, an important part of the Democratic support base. The
American Federation of Teachers and the National Education
Association gave $482,000 in unregulated ``soft money'' to
Democrats in 1999.
</P>
<P>
   Public school principals and superintendents for the most part
have embraced high-stakes standardized testing as the best way to
ward off their biggest fear: vouchers.
</P>
<P>
   But the carrot-and-stick world of accountability has many
detractors among education specialists.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're training a generation of Jeopardy contestants,'' said
Peter Sacks, author of a book called ``Standardized Minds: The High
Price of America's Testing Culture and What We Can Do to Change
It.''
</P>
<P>
   The book cites teacher surveys over the past decade by
researchers at UCLA and the University of Colorado showing the vast
majority of teachers feeling heavy pressure to improve test
results. The Colorado survey reported the most common complaint
from teachers: ``Too much teaching to test content and test
format.''
</P>
<P>
   ``If tests displace everything else in school, then all kids
learn is how to take tests,'' said Gary Orfield, a Harvard
education professor. ``There ought to be serious examination of the
assumptions behind this movement, but it's not happening.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS.)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Testing and sanctions defenders say the system, while not
perfect, has worked well enough to guarantee that students emerge
from classrooms having actually learned something.
</P>
<P>
   Douglas Carnine, a University of Oregon education professor who
has advised Bush, said that ``school failure has always been an
adult problem. Rhetoric aside, people didn't care if poor kids
learned or not. That's changed with accountability.''
</P>
<P>
   Chester Finn Jr., a testing advocate who is president of the
Washington-based Thomas B. Fordham Foundation, says the best models
are high school advanced placement (AP) exams, where students cover
a subject such as American history or biology in depth. At the end
of the course, they take a test that earns them college credit or
permits skipping introductory courses if they score high enough.
</P>
<P>
   ``Let's have tests worth teaching to,'' he said. ``If it can be
done in AP, it could be done in 4th grade. Then you'd have a proper
curriculum, tests to prove progress and we'd be a lot better off.''

&HT;     MINISTER ACCUSED OF WAR CRIMES DEPORTED TO U.N. TRIBUNAL 
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   LAREDO, Texas _ The State Department said Friday that a Rwandan
clergyman who spent nearly three years in a Laredo jail was
extradited to Africa to face genocide charges before a United
Nations tribunal.
</P>
<P>
   Elizaphan Ntakirutimana, a former Seventh-day Adventist pastor,
is the first person arrested on American soil to face such a trial,
said Don DeGabrielle, an assistant U.S. attorney. Other
extraditions from the United States have returned the accused to a
nation, not an international court.
</P>
<P>
   The International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda is being held in
Arusha, Tanzania, an African nation on the Indiana Ocean that
borders Rwanda.
</P>
<P>
   The tribunal has accused Ntakirutimana of leading attackers
armed with machetes, grenades and guns in a murderous April 1994
rampage that killed dozens of people who were hiding in his church.
</P>
<P>
   At the time, Rwanda was in the throes of a bloody feud between
the country's dominant ethnic groups, the Hutus and Tutsis, strife
that killed an estimated 500,000 and sent 2 million refugees
fleeing to neighboring nations. Most of those killed, including
those in Ntakirutimana's church, were Tutsis. Ntakirutimana is a
Hutu.
</P>
<P>
   ``You are all condemned to die! It is all over for you!'' the
pastor said, according to a witness who later hid among the
corpses.
</P>
<P>
   Neither Ntakirutimana's lawyer nor his son, a physician who
practices in Laredo, could be reached for comment Friday.
</P>
<P>
   The elderly man's lawyer, former U.S. Attorney General Ramsey
Clark, has said that his client would not receive a fair trial
because Rwandans questioned by Ntakirutimana's counsel could face
violent reprisals.
</P>
<P>
   Clark has maintained that his client is being unjustly accused
as a result of tribal hatred.
</P>
<P>
   DeGabrielle said U.S. Marshals and a physician flew with
Ntakirutimana from Laredo to Houston Thursday morning. From there
he was to continue to Amsterdam and then to Tanzania.
Ntakirutimana's age has been given variously as 73 to 75.
</P>
<P>
   State Department officials were not certain how soon he would
stand trial.
</P>
<P>
   Three weeks ago, Secretary of State Madeleine Albright signed a
warrant authorizing Ntakirutimana to be extradited, following four
years of legal appeals that led all the way to the U.S. Supreme
Court. In January, the high court declined to hear his appeal.
</P>
<P>
   The former minister was first arrested in September 1996 after
legally emigrating here with his wife to live with their son. He
has been in and out of jail in Laredo since.
</P>
<P>
   The trials in Arusha are only the third such international
forum. Others include the ongoing tribunal at The Hague,
Netherlands, addressing allegations of genocide in the former
Yugoslavia, and the trials against Nazi criminals in Nuremberg,
Germany, following World War II.

ANNAN EXHORTS U.N. COUNCIL ON `OIL FOR FOOD' FOR IRAQIS 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By BARBARA CROSSETTE   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   UNITED NATIONS _ Secretary-General Kofi Annan warned Friday that
the United Nations was in danger of losing a propaganda war with
President Saddam Hussein of Iraq if the ``oil for food'' program
intended to help Iraqi civilians suffering under sanctions is not
made more effective immediately.
</P>
<P>
   ``The humanitarian situation in Iraq poses a serious moral
dilemma for this organization,'' Annan told the council. ``The
United Nations has always been on the side of the vulnerable and
the weak, and has always sought to relieve suffering, yet here we
are accused of causing suffering to an entire population.''
</P>
<P>
   He spoke at a special daylong Security Council session to review
the organization's work in Iraq, during which the United States was
on the defensive against criticism that it is blunting the positive
impact of the program by blocking more than 1,000 import contracts.
</P>
<P>
   Responding to such criticism, James B. Cunningham, the deputy
U.S. representative at the United Nations, announced Friday that
the United States was lifting its holds on 70 contracts worth at
least $100 million in the Iraqi sanctions committee, which reviews
Iraqi orders. The United States also formally introduced its
resolution doubling to $600 million the value of oil equipment Iraq
may import every six months. Since December, there have been no
limits on the oil Iraq can export.
</P>
<P>
   Cunningham offered several proposals for better supervision in
Iraq, so that U.S. suspicions about the ultimate use or
destinations of certain imported goods, including electrical,
scientific, telecommunications and oil equipment, could be reduced.
</P>
<P>
   Even with its current problems, Cunningham said, Iraq's oil
exports and food imports are reaching the levels that prevailed
before Iraq's invasion of Kuwait in 1990, which led to
international sanctions and the Persian Gulf war in 1991.
</P>
<P>
   In a long speech accompanied by statistical material circulated
to council members, Cunningham continued to place much of the blame
for shortcomings in the oil sales plan on Saddam's government,
which, he said, refuses to expedite orders, share information or
allow inspections at many sites.
</P>
<P>
   Annan also took the Iraqis to task, saying people living under
sanctions are ``often victims both of their own government and of
the measures taken against it.'' The only way to end that, he
added, is for Iraq to comply with council decisions.
</P>
<P>
   The council is waiting to see if Saddam will allow the return of
weapons inspectors, the key to ending sanctions.
</P>
<P>
   But Annan expressed anguish over the position the United Nations
now finds itself in, with an uncooperative Iraq on one side and an
intransigent United States on the other.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are in danger of losing the argument, or the propaganda war
_ if we haven't already lost it _ about who is responsible for this
situation, President Saddam Hussein or the United Nations,'' he
said.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   During Friday's debate, several council members tried to shift
from past blame to future efforts to make the ``oil for food''
program work.
</P>
<P>
   Sir Jeremy Greenstock of Britain, speaking to reporters before
Friday afternoon's session, said there were numerous things the
council could do without further debate.
</P>
<P>
   ``We can speed the procedures in the sanctions committee,'' he
said. ``We can inject more cash into the U.N. program in Iraq. We
can start to stop the smuggling that is going on, the illegal oil
sales. We can increase the number of monitors looking at the
program's delivery in Iraq, and if we do that, we can bring down
the number of holds.''
</P>
<P>
   The Russians, French and Chinese were most critical Friday of
the U.S. and British on Iraq. Sergey Lavrov, the Russian
representative, accused the United States and Britain of killing
more than 140 people and wounding hundreds more in attacks over the
no-flight zones in northern and southern Iraq.
</P>
<P>
   ``Any explanation that these strikes were not directed at
civilians does not hold water,'' Lavrov said. He called for an
early suspension of sanctions.
</P>
<P>
   Peter van Walsum, the Dutch representative and chairman of the
council's Iraqi sanctions committee, said that despite differences,
there was a council consensus that Iraq still has to convince the
world that it does not have dreams of creating prohibited weapons.
</P>
<P>
   ``Iraq is the only country in modern history that has not only
attempted to develop all categories of weapons of mass destruction
_ nuclear, biological and chemical _ but has actually used such
weapons, both against a foreign enemy and against its own
citizens,'' van Walsum said. ``In doing so, Iraq has placed itself
in a league of its own.''
</P>
<P>
   Until Friday, two issues lying at the heart of the debate on
Iraq had rarely been raised. One is the scarcity of verifiable
information beyond what is physically visible to United Nations
officials in Iraq _ whose appointments Baghdad can control in the
sense that it can reject nominees for relief positions, and whose
movements are frequently circumscribed.
</P>
<P>
   All health and poverty figures the United Nations has to work
with are provided by the Iraqi government. Journalists cannot
report freely in the country, and the international news agencies
there must use Iraqi citizens for day-to-day reporting, which
usually amounts to no more than repeating what officials say in the
government-controlled press. Families of critics face wholesale
retaliation, diplomats based in Baghdad say.
</P>
<P>
   Iraqi government decisions are often opaque, some United Nations
officials say. In some ministries, there appears to be little
planning for social development using what funds are available to
the government from its own resources.
</P>
<P>
   In the virtual absence of independent information-gathering in
Iraq, critics of Saddam say, the effects of sanctions can be
manipulated to influence public opinion inside and outside the
country, as a few speakers noted Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Richard Butler, a diplomat in residence at the Council on
Foreign Relations, who was chief arms inspector in Iraq from 1997
to 1999, argues that sanctions worked when they were first imposed
after Iraq's invasion of Kuwait in August 1990.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you've got an immoral and utterly determined regime _ and
people are very frightened of Saddam _ sanctions might work
initially, depending not on how severe they are or how the
leadership reacts to them,'' Butler said in an interview Wednesday.
``They did, in the Iraq case, concentrate their minds for a
while.''
</P>
<P>
   ``However, given this immorality and ruthless determination, the
longer the time sanctions are applied, the less and less effective
they become, to the point where they invert in their effectiveness
for two reasons,'' he said. ``One, they get busted through a black
market and two, the leadership is able to parlay this into a reason
for staying in power.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think that's exactly where Saddam is now,'' he said. ``Today
the regime is absolutely prospering through its black market
operations _ and the longer they go on, the leakier things become _
and he is successfully deploying them propagandistically. He's
saying, `Only I can protect you from all those bad people out
there, and that's why you've got to stick with me.'''

ANALYSIS: POPE'S TRIP TO ISRAEL IS SEEN AS AGENT OF CHANGE 
</HEADLINE>
  (See also POPE-HOLYLAND) 
(lb) 
 By DEBORAH SONTAG   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   JERUSALEM _ It was inconceivable that Pope John Paul II, as he
glided serenely though the Holy Land on a personal pilgrimage and a
secondary mission of interfaith healing, would transform a region
characterized by divisiveness and hatred. Even for a few days.
</P>
<P>
   But despite an outbreak of violence at a Palestinian refugee
camp and the verbal sniping over Jerusalem that ruined his
interdenominational gathering, the pope has managed so far to hover
above the fray. In doing so, he has presented what some see as a
model of brotherly discourse to religious leaders here. And he has
established a soothing tone that quieted most of the tensions and
made both Israelis and Palestinians feel supported by his visit.
</P>
<P>
   That is a feat, considering the political agendas that have gone
unsatisfied. Many Israelis wanted the pope to apologize for the
Catholic Church's silence during the Holocaust; he didn't. Many
Palestinians wanted him to explicitly endorse the Palestinian
refugees' right of return to their homes in Israel; he didn't do
that either.
</P>
<P>
   Yet as if they were embarrassed in his presence by how much they
had been demanding, there has been no outcry from either side about
what has not been said so far. The pope spent Friday, the fourth
day of his six-day visit here, with his own faithful, celebrating a
giant outdoor Mass on the Mount of Beatitudes.
</P>
<P>
   So far, the pope has reaffirmed stances he took previously:
recognizing Israel and the enormity of the Holocaust on the one
hand, and giving his blessing to Palestinian nationalist
aspirations on the other.
</P>
<P>
   But by doing so in person and in this place, he underscored his
positions.
</P>
<P>
   ``By saying right here on Palestinian soil that he was praying
for the Palestinians who are homeless, the pope abridged the whole
Palestinian story,'' an editorial in Al-Hayat al-Jadida, a
Palestinian daily, said.
</P>
<P>
   When do Israelis hold their tongues? They did so this week,
impressed into silence. On Wednesday the pope brought together
about 50 high-ranking Orthodox Jewish and Catholic clergymen for an
unprecedented meeting, after which his public appearance with the
chief rabbis of Israel was suffused with an unusual warmth.
</P>
<P>
   Later that day, when his visit to the Yad Vashem Holocaust
memorial did not produce the long-awaited official apology from the
Church, they were practically silent.
</P>
<P>
   Chief Rabbi Yisrael Meir Lau issued a statement about what he
wished the pope had said. But it was decidedly neutral and
expressed no explicit disappointment. Earlier in the day, in an
unusually conciliatory comment, the rabbi said he did not expect
``one pope to condemn a predecessor,'' seemingly abandoning his
previous insistence that Pius XII's failure to speak out against
the Holocaust be denounced.
</P>
<P>
   The three major Israeli daily newspapers, which often emphasize
the negative, ran solemn, moving headlines Friday morning about the
pope's memorial to the victims. Maariv said, ``With sorrow, with
sadness, with silence.'' Haaretz said, ``The message is greater
than the words.'' Yedioth Ahronoth called it ``The pope's
kaddish,'' using the Hebrew word for the Jewish mourning prayer.
</P>
<P>
   Israelis have been won over by the many stories that circulated
this week about the pope's childhood friendships with Jews and acts
of kindness toward Jews after the war. They had not expected to
feel such a heady affirmation in his visit. No one could have
imagined that elderly ultra-Orthodox rabbis would have bounded to
their feet, as they did on Wednesday, to surrounded him as if he
were a celebrity and try to bond with him as fellow Eastern
Europeans.
</P>
<P>
   Just as Palestinian refugees on Wednesday said that the pope
seemed to understand their plight, many Israelis said Friday that
he stepped inside and grasped their tremulous emotions about the
Holocaust.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought he sounded almost Jewish,'' said Szewach Weiss, a
Polish-born Holocaust survivor and chairman of the Yad Vashem
Council, who was exhilarated. ``He gets it. Definitely. He is
building a bridge between Jews and Catholics over the river of
blood.''
</P>
<P>
   Equally breathless, Haim Ramon, an Israeli Cabinet minister
speaking for the government, declared: ``This is a milestone in the
relationship between Judaism and Christianity.'' He continued:
``The majority of steps toward reconciliation, in my opinion, have
already been taken by this pope. The image of the Roman Catholic
Church in Israel is better today than it was three or four days
ago.''
</P>
<P>
   The pope's effect on the Palestinians was not as powerfully
curative. His day in Bethlehem ended up highlighting the gulf
between Yasser Arafat, the Palestinian leader, and his most
desperate constituents, the refugees.
</P>
<P>
   A violent confrontation erupted between the Palestinian police
and the residents of the Deheisheh refugee camp shortly after the
pope left on Wednesday. It revealed the schism between the
authorities and the people who feel that their cause _ the right of
return _ may be sacred but that they are neglected and may be sold
out during the peace negotiations.
</P>
<P>
   But the visit also made many Palestinians proud, since the pope
embraced their suffering and treated their aspirations for
statehood as legitimate and logical. ``The pope and Palestine''
read the posters, banners and bumper stickers. It seemed to make
Palestine a more tangible place, their place, some said.
</P>
<P>
   ``He spent his very first day here with us, not the Israelis,''
said Maher Abu Nidal, a vendor. ``The Israeli security forces had
to hand him over to us, and we Muslims protected him like he was
our own. He was most welcome here in Palestine. I felt very proud.
We accepted him, he accepted us, like it was the most natural
thing. Also, the world watched and learned.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Potential tensions still lie ahead. On Saturday, he visits
Nazareth, where the cornerstone of a mosque has been laid in the
shadow of the Basilica of the Annunciation, raising tensions
between Christian and Muslim Arabs and between the state of Israel,
which approved the mosque, and the Vatican, which disapproves.
</P>
<P>
   And Sunday is the pope's interfaith trifecta day, when he stops
at Christian, Jewish and Muslim holy sites in the walled Old City,
which is at the heart of the dispute over Jerusalem's status.
Arguments over Jerusalem broke down the attempted interfaith
meeting on Thursday. There is no meeting of minds on this core
issue, and nothing that the pope can do except duck when the
subject arises.
</P>
<P>
   In almost every other respect, the pope's presence here has been
perceived as a potential agent of change. The fact that he has
wanted for so many decades to make this pilgrimage, and that he
undertook it when he was old and frail as a kind of apex of his
papacy, has affected the way he has been received. It has given the
visit a sense of undeniable magnitude.
</P>
<P>
   In Israel, the debate about Jewish-Christian relations has been
almost therapeutic, and not only because it distracted attention
from the many political scandals. The pope's visit to Yad Vashem
focused attention on what binds Israelis: that which they cannot
forget.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is good that the pope did not ask for forgiveness,'' David
Grossman, the novelist, wrote in a column on Friday. ``No one can
ask for forgiveness for the Holocaust in the name of others, and no
one is entitled to forgive in the name of the victims.
</P>
<P>
   ``But the pope's presence at Yad Vashem, inside the deepest
dimension of Jewish suffering, and the acts that he performed,
personally as a man, resonate far more strongly than could any
official declaration.''
</P>

   Pfizer is warning shareholders not to attend its annual meeting
on an empty stomach.
</P>
<P>
   Admission tickets for the April 27 meeting include this note:
``Due to space limitations, we will be serving lighter refreshments
at this year's annual meeting.''
</P>
<P>
   There was a time, said Brian McGlynn, a Pfizer spokesman, when
attendees would be treated to a sumptuous spread of smoked salmon
and other goodies. But attendance started rising a few years ago,
and the company cut back to serving a continental breakfast.
</P>
<P>
   A record crowd is expected to pack the ballroom of the Grand
Hyatt Hotel in New York this year because of Pfizer's pending
merger with Warner-Lambert, so the pickings will be even slimmer.
Thus the note, McGlynn said, ``so people won't be disappointed and
say, `I was expecting more of a meal.'''
</P>
<P>
   John Wilcox, vice chairman of Georgeson Shareholder
Communications, a proxy solicitation firm in New York, said the
note was unusual, but the move to lighter fare was not. Besides
wanting to save money, companies have second thoughts about the
merits of drawing crowds of individual shareholders with giveaways
like meals and product samples.
</P>
<P>
   ``Encouraging small investors to come simply to get a meal
doesn't really contribute to the purpose of a meeting,'' Wilcox
said.

STOCKS MOVE LITTLE AS BONDS CLAIM THE ACTION 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By ALEX BERENSON   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Stocks go up, and stocks go down, but on Friday
stocks mainly went sideways.
</P>
<P>
   A volatile week on Wall Street ended with a whimper, as the Dow
Jones industrial average fell slightly and the technology-fattened
Nasdaq composite index crept closer to the record it set earlier in
March. The Dow was down 7.14 points at 11,112.72, while the Nasdaq
rose 22.42 to close at 4,963.03.
</P>
<P>
   The real action Friday was in the bond market, with the price of
the benchmark 30-year Treasury bond falling 1 7/32 to 103 19/32.
That drove the the yield, which moves in the opposite direction as
its price, up to 5.99 percent from 5.91 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts said that bond investors were worried by the report
that some members of the Federal Reserve, which sets short-term
interest rates, had argued for a half-percentage-point increase in
rates at the Fed's February meeting, whose minutes were just
released. The Fed has raised rates five times since June, most
recently on Tuesday when it pushed up a rate on overnight loans
between banks to 6 percent.
</P>
<P>
   But each increase has been only one-quarter of a percentage
point. A larger increase would indicate that the Fed is
increasingly concerned about inflation, which is bad for bonds,
because they pay a fixed return.
</P>
<P>
   Generally, stocks and bonds move in tandem, with higher interest
rates considered bad for stocks because they drive up corporate
borrowing costs and make bonds more attractive as an alternative to
stocks. But stock investors shrugged off the latest rate increase,
confident that higher short-term rates would not slow the economy
enough to hurt corporate profits and that the Fed was almost
finished raising rates in any case.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every increase that occurs, people feel that we're closer to
the ultimate time where the Fed's going to see the light at the end
of the tunnel,'' said Vernon Winters, chief investment officer of
Mellon Private Asset Management, which has $58 billion in assets.
``Maybe a half-point rise gets it over with even sooner.''
</P>
<P>
   Winters said that this week's action had been very positive for
stock investors because it marked the first time this year that
stocks had risen across the board. He noted that the Wilshire 5000
index, which represents almost the entire U.S. stock market, broke
out of a narrow trading range and set all-time highs for the last
four days. Friday, the Wilshire closed at 14,751.64, up 17.39
points. For the week, the index was up more than 3 percent.
</P>
<P>
   ``Clearly, there's been a thrust in the last week that has a
positive tone,'' Winters said. ``The values of all stocks went up
across the board, rather than just taking from one and giving to
the other.''
</P>
<P>
   Big individual gainers Friday included IBM, which rose $6.0625
to $121, and Wal-Mart, up $1.1875 to $55.1875. The day's biggest
loser was Johnson &AMP; Johnson, which fell $7.75 to $72.25 after
halting marketing of Propulsid, a heartburn drug that has been
linked to heart problems and as many as 80 deaths. Propulsid sales,
which were almost $1 billion in 1999, could be just over $250
million this year, analysts said. The drop wiped out more than $10
billion in market value from Johnson &AMP; Johnson.

<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ There were shrieks and squeals of joy when D'Angelo
finally took off his shirt during his encore at Radio City Music
Hall on Monday night. With his pumped-up shoulders and chiseled
abs, D'Angelo is one of the reigning sex symbols in
rhythm-and-blues, singing respectful come-ons in a voice that can
be sweetly imploring or insouciant and assured.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can provide everything you desire,'' he vowed. Yet offering
himself up as a sensual fantasy is only the most conventional facet
of what he's up to. D'Angelo seeks nothing less than a grand
reunion of African-American music to satisfy body, mind and spirit.
</P>
<P>
   His heart is in music, not hitmaking. Tracing African-American
musical connections wherever they lead, D'Angelo would rather delve
into the mysteries of the groove than trim his songs to fit radio
formulas. Like the seduction he promises, D'Angelo's music takes
its time and pays attention to the possibilities of the moment.
</P>
<P>
   On his two albums, D'Angelo is often a one-man studio band.
Onstage, he made a large group just as flexible and audacious as
the music he created on his own. At a time when hip-hop has
decimated bands, D'Angelo still prizes live musicians as the key to
making music that strives for synthesis rather than pastiche. He
looks back toward a line of funk visionaries; his new album,
``Voodoo'' (Virgin), makes no secret of his admiration for James
Brown, Sly Stone, Stevie Wonder, Marvin Gaye, George Clinton and
Prince, for starters. Like them, he knows how to make a tune bump
and grind, shimmy and strut, and he's happy to make people dance.
</P>
<P>
   But he doesn't simply recreate old sure-fire moves. D'Angelo
keeps tinkering: pulling the vocals far from the beat, piling up
dissonant jazz harmonies for the horn section, hinting at
Thelonious Monk in a bass line, double-timing funk into gospel. His
first song on Monday night, ``Devil's Pie'' _ about the temptations
of materialism _ distilled its groove down to an eerie combination
of Ahmir Thompson's ticking cymbal, Pino Palladino's sparse bass
riff and a high, shivering tremolo note from Samuel Jones on
guitar. Later, performing the title song from his 1995 album,
``Brown Sugar'' (EMI), D'Angelo turned it inside out, pushing its
chorus into the background to toy with syncopations and
countermelodies.
</P>
<P>
   In his two-hour set, D'Angelo embodied all sorts of soul
archetypes. He was a nasal down-home connoisseur of ``Chicken
Grease'' and a high-stepping soul man, bounding across the stage.
He was a gospel preacher answered by tambourine-shaking backup
singers. He was an infuriated betrayed husband, smashing a
microphone stand to the stage amid hard-rock guitars; he was an
imploring suitor in falsetto, begging a lover to cheat on her
boyfriend with him just once more. During the song, he lay on the
stage and let a woman from the audience stroke his chest and back,
igniting a feminine uproar.
</P>
<P>
   Through it all, D'Angelo was a brilliant band leader. The
two-hour set traveled to Memphis, to New Orleans, to Minneapolis,
to Augusta, Ga., to Chicago and to Detroit. The music transmuted
itself through 50 years of rhythm-and-blues, up to a hip-hop cameo
from Busta Rhymes. It was overarching ambition realized through the
meticulous details of horn lines, backup vocal strategies and
rhythm-section blueprints.
</P>
<P>
   While D'Angelo's calm charisma held every fan's attention, his
own attention was on the music. Immediately after he took off his
shirt, he sat down to his electric piano to play abstruse jazz
chords. Sure of his groove and determined to stretch it, he wasn't
courting applause: he was slipping one more experiment into the
flux.

$3 BILLION NEEDED TO REPAIR AGING PRISON UNITS, TEXAS OFFICIALS
SAY 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By KATHY WALT 
c. 2000 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   HUNTSVILLE, Texas _ Five years after the Texas prison system
completed the largest construction program in the nation's history,
top prison officials said Friday they will need as much as $3
billion more to fix up aging units.
</P>
<P>
   ``We do have some old units,'' said Texas Board of Criminal
Justice member John David Franz of Hidalgo. ``The thing is we can't
wait for five years and allow some of these units to fall into a
state of disrepair to where they're uninhabitable.''
</P>
<P>
   Franz, who chairs the board's facilities committee, made his
comments in a report to the board, which concluded its bimonthly
two-day meeting.
</P>
<P>
   However, Wayne Scott, executive director of the Texas Department
of Criminal Justice, said after the meeting that he has no
intention of going to the Legislature next year with hat in hand
asking for $1 billion.
</P>
<P>
   ``First of all, I wouldn't get it,'' Scott said. ``It's going to
be highly unlikely to get a large, large appropriation for this up
front.''
</P>
<P>
   Furthermore, state law prohibits the agency from seeking more
money than it needs in a two-year budget cycle, Scott said.
</P>
<P>
   Franz called the financial needs ``depressing'' and said the
board and the Legislature will be faced with tough decisions in
coming years over whether it will be more economical to refurbish
the old units or tear them down and build new ones.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is nothing in a dangerous state today,'' Franz said.
``There won't be anything in a hazardous condition next year. But
it's coming. We're trying to be proactive and figure out how we're
going to fund the refurbishing, the renovation of some of these
older units. Or maybe the Legislature wants to build more new
prisons.''
</P>
<P>
   Although he put the price tag at fixing up 26 of the system's
older units _ some of which are more than 100 years old _ at $3
billion over the next six years, Scott and other administrators
said the cost would be much less.
</P>
<P>
   Scott's price tag was $1.2 billion over the next four
legislative sessions.
</P>
<P>
   Even so, that smaller figure is close to the $1.7 billion Texas
spent adding new prisons to house 95,000 more prisoners in a
fast-track construction program that ended in 1995. The new cost
estimates, officials said, represent what it will take to repair
water and sewer lines, repair roofs and ventilation systems, and
otherwise fix up older units.
</P>
<P>
   The Huntsville Unit, the prison system's first facility, is 152
years old, and 10 other units are at least 75 years old.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not anything you want to hear, but it's something we
expected,'' said board chairman Alfred M. ``Mac'' Stringfellow of
San Antonio. ``It's not by our choice. It's just something we have
to do.''
</P>
<P>
   Scott said the agency's first step will be to analyze short- and
long-term prison repair needs for each two-year budget cycle. He
estimates TDCJ will need about $350 million during the next
legislative session for the most urgent repairs, a figure that is
10 times what the department normally spends on facility
maintenance.
</P>
<P>
   ``The prison system is a growth industry unfortunately,''
Stringfellow said. ``As long as there are criminals in this state,
we've got to have a place to lock them up.''

 &HT;    Eds: Changes throughout
 &HT;    Bush invades Clinton territory
 &HT;    By Ken Herman
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   White House wannabe George W. Bush on Friday took his campaign
to Little Rock, a southern capital that might be able to give
Austinites a glimpse of what happens when an ex-resident becomes
president.
</P>
<P>
   The verdict: A Bush presidency would not mean we're all going to
be federal judges or ambassadors. It would not mean a quick,
federally-funded fix to our traffic woes. And it probably won't
mean a second presidential library.
</P>
<P>
   In Little Rock, the experience has been predictable. Folks who
liked Gov. Bill Clinton think President Bill Clinton has been good
for Little Rock. Folks who thought Gov. Bill Clinton was Slick
Willie are glad he is becoming a New Yorker.
</P>
<P>
   As for hard-core evidence that the city has produced a
president, so far there's not much, short of indictments and
subpoenas.
</P>
<P>
   It's tough to gauge how a Bush presidency might affect Austin.
But experts say it will, and part of the story could be what, or
who, we would lose. ``If (Bush) becomes president it will really
impact this city,'' said Herb Berkowitz of the Washington-based
Heritage Foundation, which has studied presidential transitions.
``I would suspect that hundreds of your neighbors would move to a
place called Washington D.C.''
</P>
<P>
   Though he's lived in public housing here since January 1995,
Bush is quick to remind that he's not the Austinite that Lyndon B.
Johnson was. Still, he is convinced that Austin, and Texas, would
benefit.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it would have a positive effect,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Austin Mayor Kirk Watson, a good Democrat, does not want Bush to
become president. But the mayor can see the upside to it.
</P>
<P>
   ``The advantage would be that he is familiar with Austin,'' said
Watson. ``He is familiar with what we need and you would hope that
because of that familiarity he would be in a position to help us.''
</P>
<P>
   Mark Hazelwood, president and chief executive officer of the
Greater Austin Chamber of Commerce, said a Bush presidency would
produce ``natural interest in where the president comes from, and
the president is going to be returning here periodically.''
</P>
<P>
   The question, however, is where ``here'' will be. The Texas
White House probably would be the 1,600-acre ranch Bush recently
purchased near Crawford, west of Waco.
</P>
<P>
   ``Should I win,'' said Bush, ``I anticipate spending time here
with Laura and my family at our place up in Central Texas.''
</P>
<P>
   Up in Little Rock, the biggest bricks-and-mortar evidence of the
Clinton presidency is still to come. The city is getting a
presidential library, though not everyone is thrilled. Plans to
name a street for Clinton were scaled back after someone suggested
``Impeachment Avenue.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Except for us having a national root canal on our local
politics, I don't think it's benefited us one iota,'' Arkansas GOP
executive director Chris Carnahan of Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   Not everyone in Little Rock compares the Clinton presidency to
dental discomfort. From day one, the Clinton candidacy raised the
profile of a city previously best defined by the 1957 integration
crisis at Central High School, where Bush had a campaign event on
Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Paul Harvel, head of the Little Rock Chamber of Commerce, said
the city has benefited from the spotlight.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of people across the nation know about Austin,'' he
said. ``Not everyone knew about Little Rock. Now, everyone knows
where Little Rock is. Now, no one asks what state it's in.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush's father said the benefits are more indirect.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the president should stay out of that,'' ex-President
George Bush said of nudging federal money and projects homeward.
``It's different than the LBJ days. I don't think you can, on
public expenditures of money, leave yourself open to the charge
that you are paving your own state, as opposed to a congressman who
is expected to do that kind of thing.''
</P>
<P>
   But a president can find ways to help the homefolks, Bush added.
</P>
<P>
   ``For example, we had the Republican National Convention in
Houston because people saw that would please me,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Texas already has some high-profile examples of what it means to
have a native son in high places. The LBJ Space Center near Houston
is a product of the Lyndon B. Johnson administration.
</P>
<P>
   The state also has two presidential libraries: Johnson's at the
University of Texas and Bush's at Texas A&AMP;M University.
</P>
<P>
   The Electoral College will decide whether a George W. Bush
presidential library will be needed, but the president of a Dallas
college sounds interested.
</P>
<P>
   ``No discussion has taken place with the governor, but with
Laura Bush being an alumna of SMU we would be receptive to
discussions about the opportunity,'' said Southern Methodist
University President R. Gerald Turner. ``But this is obviously
premature.''

COMMENTARY: BIENNIAL 2000 AT THE WHITNEY MUSEUM 
</HEADLINE>
  (gm) 
 By VERLYN KLINKENBORG   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial notebook on Friday,
March 24:
</P>
<P>
   Hans Haacke's ``Sanitation'' lives in a small room on the third
floor of the Whitney Museum, whose Biennial 2000 exhibition opened
Thursday. Frankly, almost naively political, ``Sanitation'' caused
a fracas even before the opening. The work will strike many viewers
as an uncompromising if overblown attack on the cultural criticisms
of Rudolph Giuliani, Patrick Buchanan and Pat Robertson. Their
comments on contemporary art are placed on the wall in a typeface
that is meant to recall the dictates of the Third Reich.
</P>
<P>
   Instead of trivializing the Holocaust, as some critics have
charged, Haacke tries to lay bare the seeds of cultural repression,
and he does so in a context that explicitly evokes the
constitutional protection of free speech and the separation of
church and state. But not even controversy _ not even Marylou
Whitney jumping ship _ can make ``Sanitation'' visually
interesting. Getting in and out of its crowded room is more
complicated than the work itself.
</P>
<P>
   Happily, this Biennial does not take its tone from
``Sanitation.'' The show is jumpier, funnier, more playful, more
inventive. A Biennial takes a lot of explaining, an accounting for
how the artists were chosen and why. You learn to approach the
exhibition labels reluctantly, so earnest and self-justifying do
they often seem. The last thing you expect from a gathering of this
kind _ a summa of contemporary art over the past two years _ is
flirtatiousness. Yet that's what you get. Like John Currin's
tuberous female nudes, this Biennial is coy and brazen at once.
Like Lisa Yuskavage's equally tuberous female nudes, it is
self-regarding, self-revealing, and self-desiring without ever
seeming narcissistic or self-centered.
</P>
<P>
   The team of six non-Whitney curators who selected the works in
this exhibition have commented on its international flavor, the
presence of artists who work in America but come from somewhere
else. There's also a reportorial edge here. Chakaia Booker's ``It's
So Hard to Be Green'' is a monumental wall-construct pieced
together from discarded tires. It is impossible to see this work in
a self-contained way. It reaches back to the junkyard sources of
those treads and tubes, that vulcanized scent. The same with the
towering installations by Rita Bannerjee and Sarah Sze. One is
inorganically organic, the other almost bio-mechanical. Their
shapes are transcendent, but their contents are allusive, worldly,
pieced together from the detritus of living.
</P>
<P>
   Naturally, this Biennial will be read as a referendum on
contemporary art _ a report for some on importance or unimportance,
for others a survey of shock. But when shock ends, play begins, and
taboos, whether sexual, political or formal, whether old or new,
become ironic conventions. You can see that happening everywhere:
in Kojo Griffin's thuggish teddy bears, in Vik Muniz's ``The Raft
of the Medusa'' drawn in Bosco syrup on a light-table, in Josiah
McElheny's fashion narrative in blown glass, in Kurt Kauper's
hyper-realist ``Diva Fictions.''
</P>
<P>
   The very idea of the museum _ an institution with complex taboos
of its own _ appears to fracture at this Biennial. Years ago the
Whitney introduced film and video works to the Biennial. Now it
adds Internet art. With a mouse-click or two, you can immerse
yourself in Ben Benjamin's ``Superbad'' or Lew Baldwin's
``Red-smoke.'' Even with the addition of Internet art, it will take
real willfulness to sustain any controversy arising from this
Biennial. That may turn out to be just one of its many pleasures.

WALL ST. UNIMPRESSED BY PRICE RISE IN OIL PATCH  
 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, MARCH 26) 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 By KENNETH N. GILPIN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   With per-barrel prices continuing to flirt with $30 and gasoline
going for $1.75 a gallon in some parts of the country, many people
are in a lather about oil prices.
</P>
<P>
   For the most part, though, those people aren't on Wall Street.
Based on movements in the stock prices of the integrated oil
companies, you would think that oil was selling for $16 a barrel
and headed lower. As a stock group, the Exxon Mobils and Texacos of
the world are down for the year so far.
</P>
<P>
   Big Oil may start doing better soon, though, because in a few
weeks these companies will start reporting first-quarter earnings.
The consensus is that those numbers are going to be big.
</P>
<P>
   William L. Randol, senior petroleum analyst at Banc of America
Securities, took some time last week to talk about why investors
continue to shun the oil stocks, and about why they should take
another look. Following are excerpts from the conversation: &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. Oil prices have about tripled in the last year or so, but the
stocks haven't done a thing. Why is that? &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. The stock-price charts of these companies all look the same:
flat in early 1999, a big run on the heels of the OPEC agreement to
limit production, then flat and finally down this year. All this
time the price of oil kept making new highs.
</P>
<P>
   Part of the reason the stocks haven't done better is that
investors don't seem to be giving any credibility to the new highs.
Another problem has been the infatuation with the Internet and
technology stocks. Cyclical industries in general have suffered
because of that. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. But isn't the operating environment for these companies very
good? &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. In many ways the fundamentals for oil stocks have never been
better.
</P>
<P>
   The price of the commodity is higher than anyone would have
thought. We think oil will settle this year at around $25 a barrel.
Companies can do very well with prices at that level, because they
cut their costs dramatically as oil prices fell in the 1980s and
the 1990s.
</P>
<P>
   Most companies can do OK with oil prices at $18 a barrel, and
break even at $15 a barrel. So anything in the low- to mid-$20
range is fabulous.
</P>
<P>
   Refining margins are also improving and will improve further
into spring and summer, because gasoline inventories are very low
and demand is very strong. Natural-gas prices are high. And even
the chemical business is doing well. So everything is clicking on
all cylinders. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. Just what does an increase in oil prices mean to the bottom
line for these companies? &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. People forget just how sensitive earnings are to the
commodity price.
</P>
<P>
   Smaller companies, like Occidental Petroleum, Conoco and Texaco,
are the most sensitive to oil price changes, while the larger
companies, like BPAmoco and Exxon Mobil, are the least sensitive.
</P>
<P>
   For example, we figure a $1 rise in the price of a barrel of
West Texas oil raises earnings per share by 32 cents at Chevron. At
BPAmoco, the same increase boosts earnings per share by 12 cents. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. So how much are the price increases we have seen going to
bolster earnings? &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. Last year, operating earnings for the seven major oil
companies were just under $25 billion. Assuming oil prices average
$25 a barrel this year, the comparable figure should be just under
$40 billion. That's a gain of about 55 percent to 60 percent.
</P>
<P>
   If oil prices average $21 a barrel next year, which is our
current assumption, in 2001 those earnings numbers should flatten
out. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. Many people don't expect oil prices to remain at or near
these levels for very long. OPEC, which has an important meeting
this week, is under a lot of pressure to raise production. Do you
think that will happen, and that prices will soften? &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. The base case we have right now is that OPEC will recommend a
one-million-barrel-per-day increase in output, of which OPEC's
share would be 700,000 barrels and Mexico's would be 300,000.
</P>
<P>
   I don't think that will be enough to cause prices to decline
much this year. In fact, I am beginning to think my 2001 forecast
of $21-a-barrel oil is too low.
</P>
<P>
   Unless non-OPEC production rises dramatically soon, which we
don't think will happen, prices will stay well above $20 a barrel
next year. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. Which of these stocks do you like? &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. We like companies with three attributes: good production
growth, strong management and attractive valuations.
</P>
<P>
   In the last regard, some of the underachievers have P/E ratios
that are less than 12 times earnings, like Conoco.
</P>
<P>
   Based on those three criteria, we like Chevron, Conoco and
BPAmoco. We also have a strong buy on two refiners, Valero Energy
and Tosco.

<P>
   Procter &AMP; Gamble. Nabisco Holdings. Coca-Cola. Anheuser-Busch.
These are all prestigious, blue-chip names. So why are their shares
in such a funk?
</P>
<P>
   In the last few weeks, companies like these that make soap,
crackers, beer and other consumer packaged goods have been the
scourge of Wall Street, losing as much as one-third of their value
while money pours into New Economy darlings.
</P>
<P>
   Procter &AMP; Gamble got everyone's attention earlier this month,
when, on the heels of a rare earnings warning, its stock plummeted
more than $27 in a single day, chopping off 31 percent, or about
$36 billion, of its market capitalization.
</P>
<P>
   A few days later, Dial said its quarterly earnings would be 10
percent lower than last year's, and investors responded by driving
down the share price by 23 percent in a day.
</P>
<P>
   Two factors are behind the deluge. Raw materials prices are on
the rise. And with inflation low, many of these companies have lost
their power to increase prices.
</P>
<P>
   So far, the entire consumer products sector has been punished,
regardless of individual companies' performance under current
conditions. ``The great disconnect here is between the businesses
and their stocks,'' said Daniel Peris, an analyst for Argus
Research. ``It just doesn't matter how good a particular food
company is.''
</P>
<P>
   For investors, then, the issue is how to sort out the companies
that can handle the stresses from the companies that cannot.
</P>
<P>
   Consider beverage stocks. Coca-Cola has announced plans for a
major revision of the way it does business and is expected to
reduce its earnings projections next month. Its price-to-earnings
multiple for this year has tumbled from more than 46 in January to
32 as of Friday.
</P>
<P>
   By contrast, Anheuser-Busch has a better pricing structure and
more potential customers than at any time in the last 10 years,
according to John A. Faucher, an analyst at J.P. Morgan Securities.
Yet its multiple for 2000 has fallen by about a quarter, to 17.5 on
Friday. Anheuser-Busch shares closed at $57.3125 on Friday, 36
percent below the 12-month target of $90 set by Susan M. Byrne,
manager of the Gabelli Westwood Equity fund which holds the stock.
</P>
<P>
   For food companies, too, the problems of a few are tarnishing
the whole group. With supermarkets consolidating and wielding more
power in their relationships with manufacturers, investors have
shied away from well-run companies like Nabisco Holding and
Bestfoods.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some companies are better positioned to deal with it than
others, and the market is treating them as if they were all the
same,'' said Nomi Ghez, a food analyst for Goldman Sachs.
</P>
<P>
   Peris, for example, said Bestfoods, a company whose brands
include Hellmann's mayonnaise, Knorr soups and Skippy peanut
butter, has consistently met earnings targets over the years and
has a coherent strategy. It closed at $42.875 on Friday. Campbell
Soup, by contrast, has had trouble increasing sales of its flagship
products because of changing lifestyles and other factors.
</P>
<P>
   And its chief executive, Dale F. Morrison, resigned on
Wednesday. Yet with a closing price of $30.50 on Friday, its stock
trades at at a multiple of 16 based on 2000 earnings estimates,
about the same as that of Bestfoods.
</P>
<P>
   The market's punishment has been ``indiscriminate,'' said Paul
Wayne, co-manager of the Kayne Anderson Rising Dividends fund,
which holds Bestfoods stock. He thinks the share price should rise
at a 15 percent to 30 percent rate over the next three years.
</P>
<P>
   Peris also lists Colgate-Palmolive and Kimberly-Clark, both P&AMP;G
competitors, as companies ``that are pumping on all eight cylinders
right now.'' He suggests that investors buy the good companies
while they can. ``When an entire sector is being pushed down, then
you have an opportunity to get good stocks at low prices,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Ghez likes Nabisco, which has increased its cash flow and market
share under a new management team. ``They have delivered on
everything we expected the company to deliver,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Still, will anything change in the foreseeable future to get the
stocks moving? Just 10 years ago, most of them could be counted on
for steady, predictable earnings growth at rates of about 15
percent a year. Life is cyclical, so what may cause consumer
products to cycle back into the picture?
</P>
<P>
   Some companies may need to revise their strategies and start
selling off businesses that are not very profitable, said Emanuel
Goldman, a global consumer products analyst for Merrill Lynch.
``Today, when it's so hard to raise prices, you want to be sure
you're in the right businesses,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Then there is the theory that consolidation could set a fire
under consumer stocks. Merger talks between Heinz and Bestfoods
that collapsed in September would have created a food giant with
powerful global distribution, said John M. McMillin, a food analyst
for Prudential Securities.
</P>
<P>
   The alternative is to follow Coke's example, steering growth
expectations lower. ``My philosophy is that stocks will not turn or
improve until the fundamentals and earnings improve,'' said David
Garza, an analyst for Roxbury Capital Management, a fund manager in
Los Angeles, who has invested in consumer products companies in the
past. ``These companies are selling toothbrushes and toothpaste and
soft drinks. There are little games they can play to get us to buy
a little bit more. But long term, they cannot get dramatic
growth.''

WHITE HOUSE AIDES SAY THEY DIDN'T REALIZE SERIOUSNESS OF E-MAIL
PROBLEM 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By MARC LACEY   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ White House officials learned almost two years ago
of a major computer problem that resulted in the mishandling of the
administration's electronic mail. Now, as they defend themselves
against accusations that they illegally concealed the situation
from investigators, presidential aides are arguing that they lacked
the computer knowledge to really understand how important the
problem was.
</P>
<P>
   ``As you know, this matter involves complex technical issues,''
said the White House counsel, Beth Nolan, in a statement to
congressional investigators that she is scheduled to deliver next
week. ``Of course, my staff and I are lawyers with laypersons'
understanding of the technical complexities of electronic messaging
and archiving.''
</P>
<P>
   Large numbers of e-mail messages sent to White House officials
from outside the office's network from 1996 to 1998 were not
properly stored in a computer archive. Specialists who have
reviewed the problem say it was caused by an unintentional error
when someone mistakenly capitalized the name of a computer server,
writing MAIL2 instead of Mail2. As a result, when the White House
received subpoenas from various investigative agencies and searched
the archive for relevant e-mails, many messages were overlooked.
</P>
<P>
   The mystery of the overlooked e-mail messages assumed on a new
degree of seriousness this week as the Justice Department disclosed
it had started a criminal investigation into whether the White
House intentionally kept the messages from investigators and
threatened computer specialists not to disclose the problem to
anyone.
</P>
<P>
   The Justice Department, Congress and the independent counsel's
office had all issued subpoenas to the White House seeking
information dealing with campaign fund-raising improprieties, the
Monica Lewinsky case and other matters. The White House had not
informed any of them of the problem.
</P>
<P>
   Nobody knows for sure what is contained in the affected
correspondence.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's certainly no one saying, `The jig is up. We've been
caught,''' remarked Judge Royce C. Lamberth, who is handling a
civil case in U.S. District Court in Washington that touches on the
e-mail controversy.
</P>
<P>
   The case was filed against the Clinton administration by
Judicial Watch, a conservative legal group that is a fierce
antagonist of the White House. Larry Klayman, who heads Judicial
Watch, contends that the e-mail messages could be explosive, even
though they were written to White House officials and not by them.
Klayman told Lamberth at a hearing Friday that the correspondence
could include important evidence from former White House officials.
</P>
<P>
   But a Justice Department lawyer, James J. Gilligan, who sought
to delay Klayman's lawsuit while his office investigates, argued
that it was unlikely anything incriminating would turn up on the
messages. The Internet is not secure, he said, and people outside
the White House would be unlikely to provide any evidence in e-mail
form.
</P>
<P>
   One computer specialist from Northrop Grumman who was hired to
maintain the White House e-mail system has testified that a
colleague told her the e-mail dealt with a variety of
administration controversies, from campaign fund-raising practices
to the Lewinsky case. That colleague, however, testified before the
House Government Reform Committee on Thursday that he said no such
thing.
</P>
<P>
   At that hearing, which was called by Rep. Dan Burton, R-Ind.,
computer experts tried repeatedly to describe the computer problem
in everyday English. But they quickly started rattling off terms
like e-mail archiving and the design flow problem that left
onlookers confused.
</P>
<P>
   Nolan, who is expected to testify on the issue next week, said
in a statement that her predecessor, Charles Ruff, knew of the
problem with e-mail years ago but did not really understand the
extent of it, or its consequences.
</P>
<P>
   ``As Mr. Ruff understood the technical problem at the time, he
did not think that the error had an effect on previous searches or
that it might affect future searches of e-mail records,'' Nolan
wrote. ``As a result, Ruff had no reason to believe there was any
need to notify investigative bodies of this error.''
</P>
<P>
   The chief investigative counsel for Burton's committee, Jim
Wilson, was not buying the White House defense. ``It may be a
difficult problem, but the onus was on them to come to an
understanding of what the problem was, and they didn't,'' he said.

   HOMEBREW-COMPUTER-CLUB (Palo Alto, Calif.) _ Twenty five years

That turned out to be the birth of the personal computer
revolution. It was also the start of the tug-of-war for the soul of

</P>
<P>
   GLOBALIZATION-CONFLICTS-REVIEW (Washington) _ For seven years,
Bill Clinton has tried to offer the world's conflict-prone nations
a new commitment to globalization as the cure for an old fear of
armageddon. He made the case again last week racing through South
Asia. Meanwhile, events in the Middle East and the Taiwan Strait
were also testing the Clinton mantra that sharing in global
prosperity will inevitably make the world safer. Each of those
disputes is driven by its own history of conflict. But they
illustrate the dangers of too simplistic a faith in the lure of the
market when nationalistic impulses flare up. By David E. Sanger.

   (Will move in ``a'' category)
</P>
<P>
   LAWSUITS-TOBACCO-REVIEW (Undated) _ The legal system has begun
to overtake the legislative process as the vehicle to resolve
contentious debates, particularly over controversial products when
Congress is unwilling to act. Both the tobacco and firearms
litigation, for example, were highly organized assaults on targeted
industries. The use of concentrated legal firepower to set social

</P>
<P>
   U.S.-EXTRADITE-REVIEW (Undated) _ The initial rulings against
Chile's Gen. Augusto Pinochet caused some former U.S. officials to
wonder whether they too could some day be extradited _ let us say,
if the United States lost its position as the world's sole
superpower _ and put on trial any time that any judge in the world
accuses them of human rights violations. By Jayson Blair.

   RUSSIA-PUTIN-REVIEW (Moscow) _ Vladimir Putin's most serious
effort since assuming the leadership of Russia has been prosecuting
the brutal military operation in Chechnya, intended to prove that
he is the firm hand that can rebuild a strong Russian state. But
his real challenge will be the appointments, the policies and
economic reforms he undertakes to bring Russia back from the brink

   NITEOUT-CHRISTENSEN-MODEL (New York) _ No one ever said that
life after modeling is easy. Besides the pain of makeup withdrawal

<TEXT>
<P>
   Luxury sport utilities built on the underpinnings of trucks, as
most are, tend to disappoint owners more than luxury cars _ and
also more than a new breed of carlike ``crossover'' SUVs, according
to two recent studies.
</P>
<P>
   The consumer satisfaction studies _ by Strategic Vision and J.D.
Power &AMP; Associates, two California-based research companies _
suggested that high expectations might be a factor in buyers'
dissatisfaction.
</P>
<P>
   ``Luxury cars tend to provide some of the industry's
highest-quality offerings,'' said George Owens, manager of product
research at J.D. Power. ``People who are coming from luxury cars
are continuing to bring with them luxury-car expectations.''
</P>
<P>
   While most sport utilities, including luxury models like the
Cadillac Escalade and Lincoln Navigator, have bodies fixed to truck
frames, crossovers like the Lexus RX300 and BMW X5 use one-piece
unit bodies like most cars'. Crossovers also have suspensions and
steering systems much like those of cars, compared with the rugged,
often less sophisticated, systems of trucks. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In a report comparing the RX300 with traditional sport utilities
and luxury sedans, Daniel Gorrell, vice president of Strategic
Vision, said old-style SUVs did not deliver the attributes buyers
sought and fell short of meeting owners' emotional needs.
</P>
<P>
   These buyers want a luxury vehicle that makes them feel in
control, is able to handle anything, adds to the fun in their life
and gives a sense of freedom, he said. ``Yet these vehicles deliver
less well on these dimensions than luxury cars or the RX300,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   These truck-based luxury sport utilities scored lower than
luxury cars in quietness, engine performance, ease of entry and
exit, and particularly on fuel economy.
</P>
<P>
   The 1998 and 1999 initial quality studies by J.D. Power
indicated that consumers liked their luxury cars better, in
general, than their luxury trucks.
</P>
<P>
   One group in particular _ those who traded in luxury cars _ is
even less happy with their fancy trucks. These consumers'
complaints mostly related to the quality factors that the industry
calls ``fit and finish.''
</P>
<P>
   Several manufacturers have crossovers in the works, including
Buick, Pontiac, Porsche, Saab and Volkswagen. Gorrell said
crossovers ``represent the birth of a significant new segment that
can offer customers the best of both worlds.''
</P>
<P>
   One person who has also seen some disenchantment, but doesn't
think it is a big problem, is George Petersen, president of
AutoPacific Inc., another consulting firm. Luxury SUVs provide
outstanding satisfaction, Petersen said, adding: ``But it's not the
same level of satisfaction as a luxury car, and it's a different
kind of satisfaction. They are still based on trucks and don't have
the same level of finesse as luxury cars.'' Owners take that into
account, he said, ``because, by golly, they are trucks.'' &QL;

 By RICHARD W. STEVENSON   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ This year's partisan battle over the federal
budget, which lurched forward early Friday when the House narrowly
passed a Republican tax-and-spending blueprint, has a familiar ring
to it.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans want a big tax cut, more money for the military and
reductions in just about everything else. Democrats are trying to
expand or at least protect spending on a wide array of domestic
programs. Each side is attacking the other in apocalyptic terms.
The policy and political repercussions could be substantial.
</P>
<P>
   But it is worth noting that prosperity has brought the parties
closer on fiscal policy than either of them usually admits.
</P>
<P>
   Without debate or rancor, Republicans and Democrats have more or
less agreed that the surplus being generated by Social Security _
$1 trillion over the next five years and $2.3 trillion over a
decade _ should go to pay down the portion of the debt held by the
public, currently about $3.5 trillion. (The fine print would also
allow the money to be used to help create private investment
accounts within Social Security, a Republican goal that has been
put on the back burner at least until after the election.)
</P>
<P>
   There is common ground on other issues as well. Republicans are
proposing a substantial increase in spending on education, seeking
to neutralize an issue that long played to the advantage of
Democrats. Both parties want to provide money to add a prescription
drug benefit to Medicare, though they differ on the scale any such
program should have.
</P>
<P>
   And the unanimous votes this month in both the House and the
Senate to repeal the earnings limit on Social Security recipients
provided some hope that compromise might be possible on other tax
issues, like the marriage penalty paid by many two-income couples.
</P>
<P>
   ``We should be doing a little bit more celebrating for what we
have been able to achieve as Republicans and Democrats alike,''
said Rep. John R. Kasich, R-Ohio, the chairman of the House Budget
Committee.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the differences, in both ideological and dollar terms,
are more than enough to create political friction on the campaign
trail this year as well as in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   The House budget blueprint, passed by a largely party-line vote
of 211-207 early Friday after more than 12 hours of often rancorous
debate, would cut taxes by at least $150 billion over five years
and perhaps as much as $240 billion, and increase total government
spending authority by 3 percent, to $1.85 trillion.
</P>
<P>
   Gov. George W. Bush of Texas, who has locked up the Republican
presidential nomination, wants a $483 billion tax cut over five
years _ more than his party is willing even to try getting through
Congress this year.
</P>
<P>
   Vice President Al Gore, who will be Bush's opponent in the fall,
says that the approach taken by Republicans in Congress would risk
a return to budget deficits and imperil efforts to shore up Social
Security and Medicare _ and that Bush's plan is even worse.
</P>
<P>
   The Senate will soon take up a budget plan similar to the one
passed by the House, though it has been bottled up for the past
week in the Senate Budget Committee by conservatives who are
pressing for bigger tax cuts and less spending.
</P>
<P>
   Once both chambers have settled on and reconciled their budget
plans _ nonbinding resolutions that provide a framework for the
development of specific spending and tax bills _ the really
difficult work will begin.
</P>
<P>
   At that point, the appropriations committees that set spending
levels for everything from fighter planes to farm aid and school
lunch programs will begin their work. If the past few years are any
guide, they will find it difficult if not impossible to remain
within the limits set out in the budget outline.
</P>
<P>
   The budget provides for a 6 percent increase in military
spending, to $307.3 billion, but essentially freezes nonmilitary
spending at $289 billion, requiring cuts in most programs once
inflation is taken into account. Most of the rest of the budget
goes to pay Social Security and Medicare benefits and interest on
the national debt.
</P>
<P>
   In each of the past several years, the Republican-controlled
Congress has approved nonmilitary spending increases well above the
inflation rate. In part, that is because of pressure from President
Clinton. But it is also because Republicans themselves have found
it hard to vote for spending cuts or freezes in popular programs at
a time when the budget surplus is swelling.
</P>
<P>
   The result has been to make it difficult for Republicans to pass
the appropriations bills needed to keep the government operating,
leading to an end-of-session rush to cut deals and get out of town,
even if it requires using budgetary gimmicks to make the numbers
add up. Such a prospect looms again this year, when members of
Congress will be particularly eager to get home to campaign.
</P>
<P>
   The failure by Republicans to set realistic spending targets
``has delayed, rather than expedited, action on appropriations
bills and other fiscal legislation,'' Jacob J. Lew, the White House
budget director, said in a letter sent to congressional leaders
Thursday night.
</P>
<P>
   The problem is exacerbated by a split within the Republican
Party. House leaders had difficulty rounding up the votes they
needed to pass the budget early Friday because a group of
conservatives had threatened to vote against it on the ground that
it did not have enough safeguards against last-minute deals to
increase spending.
</P>
<P>
   Yet moderates and members of the appropriations committees
warned that the spending levels in the budget plan were already
unrealistically low, and that passing appropriations bills would
become even more difficult if conservatives insisted on further
cuts or more debt reduction.  &QL;

FORMER NFL PLAYER'S BEST HIT: $28 MILLION TEXAS JACKPOT 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By JOHN W. GONZALEZ 
c. 2000 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ Thomas ``Hollywood'' Henderson already knew he
was lucky. The former All-Pro Dallas Cowboys linebacker had
survived the NFL, crack addiction, suicidal urges and prison.
</P>
<P>
   And he already considered himself a rich man, at least compared
to the inner-city Austin kids he is devoted to helping.
</P>
<P>
   But Henderson, 47, had powerful new proof of his good fortune
and wealth Friday: a Texas lottery ticket that will bring him about
$14.5 million.
</P>
<P>
   ``I already have money. I've got a nice home, a big truck and
some cars. The only thing that's going to change about me is it's
going to add some zeros to my account,'' Henderson said.
</P>
<P>
   He defied the game's 15.8 million-to-1 odds with six winning
numbers out of 50 in Wednesday's drawing, capturing the biggest
Lotto Texas jackpot of the year and one of the larger unshared
pots.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know the odds of winning are like one in 17 million. But
what are the odds of me winning?'' he asked.
</P>
<P>
   Henderson bought $100 worth of tickets for Wednesday's $28
million jackpot and allowed the computer to choose the winning
numbers _ 5, 8, 17, 35, 38, 41.
</P>
<P>
   Lottery officials said that because Henderson chose the lump sum
``cash-option'' payment, his prize will actually amount to
$14,491,235. After taxes, he'll get a check for $10,433,690,
spokesman Keith Elkins said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Thank you, God. Thank you very much,'' he told Austin's
KXAN-TV Thursday night when he first disclosed he held the winning
ticket. After that interview, he said he celebrated alone.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had a one-man party. I went to 7-Eleven and got a sausage
biscuit with egg, some little white donuts, some whole milk and a
large bottle of water. That was the celebration spread,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was in bed by 11 o'clock, but I didn't go to sleep.''
</P>
<P>
   Henderson said his all-important charitable work with
underprivileged kids just got easier.
</P>
<P>
   ``I won't have to beg so much any more,'' he told KXAN. ``I
won't have to fast any more,'' as he once did to raise money for a
youth sports facility.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been rich, I've been poor. I've been bad, I've been good.
For the last 16 years I've been clean and sober. I've been trying
to make a difference in my children's lives and the lives of
kids,'' Henderson said. ``I've tried to be a good steward in my
community. I've tried to be an activist.
</P>
<P>
   ``A friend of mine said to me tonight, `It's karma. You just got
the big bonus in karma for the work you've done,''' said Henderson,
who counsels substance abusers as well as heading up his nonprofit
foundation.
</P>
<P>
   He accepted the friend's assessment. How else could the Austin
native explain his trip from humble roots to fame, from sports hero
to inmate, from rehabilitated role model to the super-wealthy?
</P>
<P>
   A surprise first-round draft pick out of Langston College in
Oklahoma, the three-time Super Bowl veteran played for the Cowboys
from 1975-79, when he was fired by the late Coach Tom Landry due to
cocaine addiction. When he eulogized Landry just five weeks ago, he
called him ``the greatest man I've ever known.''
</P>
<P>
   Henderson finished out his playing career with Houston, Miami
and San Francisco. But in 1984, his football days behind him, he
hit a low point. He began serving 28 months in a California prison
for felony convictions of sexual assault and bribery. The charges
stemmed from a crack-hazed encounter with two Long Beach teen-age
girls.
</P>
<P>
   ``I received a sexual favor from one for letting them smoke
crack with me. Sex for crack. That is the way it was,'' he said in
a belated apology to his Cowboys teammates in 1997. He also penned
an autobiography, ``Out of Control.''
</P>
<P>
   But even after his prison stint and years as an anti-drug
campaigner, Henderson wasn't through paying for his crimes. This
year, a disappointed Henderson _ ineligible to hold office _ was
forced to abandon plans to run for Austin City Council because he
was never pardoned nor had his criminal record expunged.
</P>
<P>
   Despite his troubled past, in the capital city Henderson is
well-known and admired for his nearly single-handed development of
a sports center for East Austin youths. He went on a hunger strike
in 1997 to raise money for the outdoor track and field facility,
and he has spent copious amounts of time building and maintaining
it. But it's still a work in progress, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We need hurdles, high-jump apparatus, pole vault apparatus. I
called and got a price the other day. It's $15,000,'' he said, and
with a laugh added: ``Oh, well. I'll be writing a check.''
</P>
<P>
   To do the Thursday interview with KXAN, he dropped by the store
where he bought his ticket _ Nau's Enfield Drug, an old-fashioned
pharmacy and hangout in the Clarksville neighborhood one mile west
of the Capitol. The store is about three blocks from his
fashionable condo.
</P>
<P>
   ``I won $28 million in my neighborhood. In my neighborhood,'' he
repeated. ``It's going to stay in Austin because I'm not leaving
Austin. This is my hometown.''
</P>
<P>
   He said he figured out he had the winning ticket Thursday and
spent a listless day staring at his ticket and preparing to go
public with his secret.
</P>
<P>
   By Friday, Henderson was hard to find and less eager to talk,
apparently weary of media and well-wishers' calls.
</P>
<P>
   But Henderson did contact the Texas Lottery Commission on Friday
to get informal confirmation that he was the winner. He told
officials that next week or later, after consulting with an
attorney and financial adviser, he plans to surrender the ticket in
return for his multimillion-dollar check.

   Dear Dr. Bombay: The small lettering on my Web pages displayed
with Internet Explorer is very hard to read. The same pages with
Netscape are easy to read. I noticed with Netscape that you can
adjust the lettering size, but no size is listed with Internet
Explorer. _ Going Blind
</P>
<P>
   Dear Going: Either you've got an ancient version of IE or you're
just not looking in the right place. I'm guessing your browser is
showing its age.
</P>
<P>
   Now, that's OK with some kinds of software. I've used the same
word-processing program for 17 years because all I need it to do is
save my work as a simple text file, and it does that nicely without
trying to rearrange my paragraphs or criticize my spelling and
grammar. After all, that's what copy editors are for. Yes, I
purposely ended that sentence with a preposition.
</P>
<P>
   Browser technology and Web design, on the other hand, change
daily. As soon as some new feature is included in a browser, you
can bet 10 million Poindexters are staying up late at night, trying
to take advantage of it on their sites. And, if your browser lacks
the capability to display the newest stuff, you're never going to
be treated to all those dancing, singing hamsters or whatever it is
some nerd thought would be totally cool.
</P>
<P>
   There's an added incentive to upgrading IE: Microsoft includes
improvements to the Windows operating system with each release of
Explorer. Nobody's forcing you to use IE _ at least, Bill Gates
hasn't worked out a totally reliable way to do that yet _ but you
miss out on some nifty stuff like easier-to-use dial-up networking
if you never upgrade. Don't worry. You can still use Netscape.
Nobody will tell Bill.
</P>
<P>
   Once you've installed IE 5.01, go to the View menu and select
Text Size, where you'll have five font sizes to choose from. If
you've got a mouse that has that little wheel between the two
buttons, you can hold down the Control key and roll it up or down
to change text size. Let's see Netscape do that.
</P>
<P>
   And one other thing: Stop using the default text size when you
design a Web page. It's too small for us old-timers to read. Have
some pity and throw a plus-1 or plus-2 into your FONT commands.
That ratchets the viewing size up.
</P>
<P>
   Dear Dr. Bombay: Many greetings. I am from Greece, and I want to
start hacking. I want you to tell me how it could be. _ Wannabe
</P>
<P>
   Dear Wannabe: I've always said there aren't enough hackers in
the world. First, abandon all personal hygiene. Drop all interests
but computing. Don't even try to interact with other people, or you
won't be able to let your sense of values warp beyond all
recognition. Now, develop an unreasonable hatred for society.
Remember: It's not your fault you're a total loser with no friends,
marketable skills or future. Those multinational corporations and
government agencies are the ones to blame. Target them with the
only weapon you have in your pitiful arsenal: not your vote, not
your ideas, not your faith, not your inspiration, but your childish
belief that jamming somebody's Web page for a couple of hours will
make the world finally recognize how truly awesome you are. Trust
me: We'll all be really impressed. Oh, and you should have a really
cool nickname, too. Your cellmate will like that.
</P>

<P>
   Two heads are often better than one. And when it comes to the
task of managing a portfolio of large-capitalization value stocks,
which have badly lagged behind the broader market lately, the extra
brain power may come in handy.
</P>
<P>
   Consider the $138.8 million AHA Diversified Equity fund, run
jointly by Brian M. Barish, senior vice president of Cambiar
Investors, a money management firm in Englewood, Colo., and John D.
Freeman, president of the Investment Research Co., a money manager
in Rancho Santa Fe, Calif. Each oversees about one-half of the
portfolio.
</P>
<P>
   Curiously, the two managers have never met each other, don't
talk to each other, and neither has expressed much desire to do so.
But they sound alike. Asked about their relationship, they replied
with identical words: ``He does his thing, and I do my thing.''
</P>
<P>
   The fund, marketed to members of the American Hospital
Association, has posted exceptional returns. It gained 23.4 percent
a year, on average, for the three years through March 17, more than
double the 11.3 percent for its large-cap value category, according
to Morningstar Inc.
</P>
<P>
   (The minimum investment is $1 million, but the AHA, whose
members include hospitals and other health care groups, may
introduce a share class with a lower minimum.)
</P>
<P>
   The rationale behind the approach? ``Using two value-oriented
managers with different investing styles, we hope to decrease the
volatility that naturally occurs in equity funds over time,'' said
R. John Evans, chief financial officer of the AHA The tobacco-free
portfolio is rebalanced at least once a month.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, the two managers have different approaches to
stock-picking. Freeman, 44, uses a computer-based mathematical
model. Barish, 32, picks stocks using what he calls a modified
value approach.
</P>
<P>
   But Barish doesn't pile into industries with the highest
dividends or the lowest price-to-earnings or price-to-book ratios.
Instead, he said, ``we look for companies that sell at low
valuations relative to their peer group in industries that we think
have favorable prospects.''
</P>
<P>
   That means a strong tilt towards telecommunications, technology
and health care sectors, rather than the chemical, airline and
railroad stocks that many value investors own.
</P>
<P>
   Barish typically looks for stocks that trade at 20 percent to 40
percent discounts to their 52-week highs _ and for catalysts that
can push up the price.
</P>
<P>
   Six analysts work with Barish, preparing spreadsheets of 20
industries. They use a variety of multiples based on historical and
projected numbers, including price to cash flow, price to sales and
price to earnings. But they want the 30 to 35 stocks in their part
of the portfolio to trade at a minimum 30 percent discount to
industry averages.
</P>
<P>
   Meeting management is important. Barish figures that he travels
at least 10 days a month, visiting companies in his portfolio. He
unearths information about new products, capital expenditures,
marketing plans and alliances, among other things, looking for
catalysts.
</P>
<P>
   By contrast, Freeman never talks to management. ``We look at the
traditional variables that apply across the entire universe,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Not unlike Barish, he wants companies that sell for discounts to
their peers, based on price-to-earnings and price-to-cash-flow
ratios. In general, he wants price-to-earnings multiples to be 10
percent to 20 percent below those of the Standard &AMP; Poor's
500-stock index, and historical price-to-sales and
price-to-cash-flow multiples at a 20 percent to 30 percent discount
to the index.
</P>
<P>
   Freeman and his two analysts also measures the gap between cash
flow and earnings _ the bigger it is, the better the earnings'
sustainability, or quality. ``It helps us to avoid short-term
earnings disappointments,'' he said. He also looks for analysts'
forecasts of stable or strengthening earnings.
</P>
<P>
   All that information is used to choose his 170 to 200 stocks,
matching the sector weightings of the S&AMP;P 500.
</P>
<P>
   Freeman likes Caterpillar, the heavy-equipment manufacturer. He
bought shares on March 2 at $31.42, based on a price-to-cash-flow
multiple of 7.5, versus an industry average of nearly 10. Another
plus was the quality of the company's earnings; he predicts a
three-year growth rate of 9.2 percent, annualized.
</P>
<P>
   Caterpillar shares closed on Friday at $39.50, or 13 times his
earnings forecast of $3.07 a share for the next 12 months.
</P>
<P>
   Barish likes Watson Pharmaceuticals, a generie drug maker in
Corona, Calif. At the end of 1998, its stock traded at $60; he
bought shares last September, after prices fell to $35. ``On the
supply side, an enormous number of patent-protected drugs will lose
their protection in the next four years and become subject to
generic competition,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   He expects Watson's earnings to grow 15 percent to 20 percent,
annualized, over the next three years. The stock now trades at
$38.4375, or 19 times his earnings forecast of $2 a share for this
year; his 12-month price target is in the low $50s.

PIANIST ENDS LONG SILENCE ON HER LIFE AND HEALTH 
</HEADLINE>
  (lh) 
 By ANTHONY TOMMASINI   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Few people who have heard the tempestuous
Argentine-born pianist Martha Argerich play ever forget it. She is
a colossal technician, a powerfully intuitive musician and an
electrifying performer. Just last week at Carnegie Hall, as soloist
with the Philadelphia Orchestra in a concert conducted by Charles
Dutoit, Argerich vanquished the formidable challenges of
Prokofiev's Piano Concerto No. 3. Her fiery, ecstatic performance
elicited a frenzied ovation, including 10 curtain calls, from a
sold-out house.
</P>
<P>
   She inspires cultlike devotion, and her admirers include many of
the world's most respected musicians. Mstislav Rostropovich, the
great cellist and conductor, recently called her ``a pianist with
no limits at all, none whatsoever.''
</P>
<P>
   But Argerich, who will perform again Saturday night at Carnegie
Hall, is the most enigmatic figure in classical music today, by
turns passionate, disarming and chaotic. Beset with inner demons
and insecurities, she can be an erratic performer, and she has been
famously prone to canceling concerts precipitously.
</P>
<P>
   ``Martha is an unguided missile,'' as one close friend of hers
has memorably put it.
</P>
<P>
   For years the reclusive pianist assiduously avoided giving
interviews, even as adoring fans worried about her and flocked to
her concerts, hoping that she was well, hoping she would play.
Argerich kept her silence even as rumors spread that she was
fatally ill.
</P>
<P>
   But on one recent night, close to 11 o'clock, Argerich
(pronounced AHR-gur-itch) sat in the lounge of a midtown hotel for
the first extended one-to-one interview she has given in nearly 20
years and talked openly about her work and her health.
</P>
<P>
   Some weeks earlier she had allowed a statement to be released
confirming that she had been treated for melanoma, cancer of the
skin, at the John Wayne Cancer Institute in Santa Monica, Calif.
But now she revealed the extent of the problem: the melanoma had
spread to her lymph nodes and lungs. ``I was afraid of my own
body,'' she said of the trauma she faced. ``I was afraid of myself
for the first time; afraid to be me.''
</P>
<P>
   So far, the treatments appear to have been successful. She is in
remission. Indeed, out of gratitude Argerich's concert is to
benefit the institute. All tickets were scooped up weeks ago. Her
program Saturday night is also significant because, for the first
time in 19 years, she is performing solo repertory in a major
American concert venue.
</P>
<P>
   During the wide-ranging 90-minute interview, Argerich, 58, also
spoke of musical matters and her tumultuous career: her beginnings
as a pint-size prodigy; her early triumphs; her crisis of
confidence when she felt ``out of order,'' as she put it, ``like an
elevator or a telephone;'' her practice habits, which can be ``not
very systematic and not very disciplined''; and her ``contradictory
type of relationship'' to the piano. ``I can be obsessive'' when
there is music to be learned, she said; but at other times ``I
don't touch the piano at all.''
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Pinning Argerich down to a time and place for the interview
proved predictably frustrating. When she finally arrived as
promised, she had just finished practicing in an upstairs studio at
Carnegie Hall and was in work mode: dressed in slacks and a long
sweater, her sleek mane of black hair a bit disheveled. She is 5
feet 4 inches tall, and a striking woman with bright brown eyes and
a sturdy build. Her hands are surprisingly small, and on this night
a few finger tips were protected by band-aids.
</P>
<P>
   In 1981, Argerich announced that she was giving up solo recitals
entirely, and, with occasional exceptions for special, usually
hush-hush events, she has kept to her word. Why?
</P>
<P>
   ``It's really a very obsessive situation, when you are alone
onstage playing on your own,'' she said. ``I have a tendency to be
a very obsessive person. It makes me very ... I don't know.'' Of
course, the solo repertory is wonderful, she added. But she prefers
playing chamber music and concertos, which is more stimulating and
less lonely.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Her insecurities as a performer long predate her health crisis.
The daughter of two university-based economists in Buenos Aires,
Argentina, she began piano lessons at 5. When she was 8, she played
a difficult Beethoven piano sonata (Op. 31, No. 3) for the renowned
pianist Walter Gieseking, who proclaimed her a phenomenon. At 16,
within the space of three weeks, she won both the Busoni and the
Geneva International Piano Competitions.
</P>
<P>
   When she was 21 she suffered a crippling bout of depression that
lasted over two years. After studying in Europe, she moved to New
York and ``didn't do anything,'' she said. ``I just sat in an
apartment watching the late late show.'' Even getting married and
having the first of her three daughters, each by a different man,
did not lift her from the depression.
</P>
<P>
   ``I felt I could not play anymore,'' she said. ``Since I spoke
several languages, I thought I would just become a secretary.'' She
credits a former teacher, the Polish-born pianist Stefan Askenase,
and his strong-willed wife with helping to lift her out of this
hole and back into music. Their intervention clearly worked, for in
1965, at 24, Argerich won first prize in the Chopin International
Competition in Warsaw, Poland, and her career took off. Among the
colleagues who helped was Dutoit, to whom she was married from 1969
until 1973 and with whom she remains good friends.
</P>
<P>
   She was quickly acclaimed for her rhapsodic playing,
particularly of the Romantic repertory. Her hyper-intense recording
of the Tchaikovsky concerto in a live performance from 1980 has
become a cult classic. But as her career developed, she began
missing concerts, quite often. ``I don't know why I had this very
scandalistic reputation,'' she said, coyly. ``I played more
concerts than what I canceled.'' In early 1968 she was scheduled to
play Beethoven's First Piano Concerto for her debut with the New
York Philharmonic, conducted by Leonard Bernstein. She withdrew on
short notice.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was terrible I did this,'' she said. ``It was not for
health reasons. It was some other problems I had. So Bernstein
played the concerto himself. The manager at the time was very
funny. He said: `Lennie played. He had a great success, so he loves
you!''' Argerich burst into hearty laughter.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
   Of course, some real crises compelled her to miss performances
in some cases, like two recitals scheduled in Tokyo early last
month. Argerich had been hoping to try out there the solo works she
will play Saturday night. But a former teacher, the pianist
Friedrich Gulda, a deeply spiritual musician (``my most important
influence''), died, plunging her into distress. After attending his
funeral in Vienna, Austria, Argerich flew that same day to Tokyo,
and within two hours of landing performed, as scheduled, the Chopin
Piano Concerto No. 1 with Vladimir Ashkenazy conducting. ``It was
the best Chopin E Minor I ever played,'' she said. ``I don't know
why.'' But she developed a fever and had to cancel two eagerly
anticipated solo recitals.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Not getting this trial run has added pressure to Saturday
night's concert. Half of her program will be solo repertory, works
by Bach, Chopin and Prokofiev's daunting Seventh Sonata. Argerich
is looking forward much more to the concert's second half, when she
will have some company onstage: the Juilliard String Quartet for a
performance of Schumann's Piano Quintet, and an old friend, the
pianist Nelson Freire, for a performance of Ravel's ``Valse'' in
its arrangement for two pianos.
</P>
<P>
   She has been practicing hard. A night owl, she prefers to work
late. When not availing herself of Carnegie Hall's studios she has
been at the Metropolitan Opera House, where a young friend, the
tenor Kamel Boutros, arranged for access to a studio.
</P>
<P>
   ``Once I start practicing I can stay,'' she explained. ``But I
don't start,'' she added, laughing again. ``OK, if I am in trouble,
I need to practice. But that kind of obsessive practicing is not
good. Ideally, I would like to practice very little, just two hours
and then not more.''
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Obviously, health concerns have contributed to her anxiety.
Though enormously relieved by her medical progress, Argerich
delayed the appointment for her annual checkup until after Saturday
night's concert. ``I was too nervous,'' she said. ``Let's hope for
good news,'' she added, tapping on the cocktail table.
</P>
<P>
   Her first melanoma appeared 10 years ago, at a very difficult
time. ``One year before, my mother had died of cancer,'' she said.
``Then, the same day I was diagnosed, my best friend died from
another type of cancer. She was 49. It was like a nightmare.''
</P>
<P>
   Argerich underwent treatment in Europe, but five years later
another melanoma appeared. Within a year, it had spread. The
condition had become life-threatening.
</P>
<P>
   Through friends, Argerich learned of a surgical oncologist, Dr.
Donald L. Morton, the medical director of the John Wayne Cancer
Institute, a nonprofit organization in Santa Monica, Calif.,
supported by the National Cancer Institute and private funds. Since
1960, Morton had led a research team seeking to develop a vaccine
that could be used to fight melanoma by simulating the body's
immune system. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In addition to recommending the experimental vaccine, which
Argerich is taking, Morton explained that she would have to undergo
surgery to remove cancerous tissue from her lungs.
</P>
<P>
   ``This was March 1997,'' Argerich said. ``Just before the
surgery, I felt, `This is dangerous.' You see, to play the piano
you use these muscles here.'' She pointing to the areas below her
arm, on her side and back.
</P>
<P>
   Morton, speaking by telephone from California, said he had not
realized until then how important those muscles were to a pianist.
``Thank God we were able to accomplish the procedure without doing
damage to the muscles,'' he said. The recovery was grueling for
her, said Morton, who is in New York to attend the benefit. ``But
the same characteristics that make her a world-class pianist also
make her a survivor,'' he said. ``She is a very brave lady.''
</P>
<P>
   While leaving her practice room at Carnegie Hall on the way to
the interview the other night, Argerich was approached by a young
usher who is a big fan. She wound up confiding her nervousness to
him. ``So, he told me, `You must learn the wisdom of
uncertainty,''' she recalled. ``That's nice, no?'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Uncertainty is something Argerich has learned to live with.

MICROSOFT OFFERS SETTLEMENT OF ANTITRUST CASE 
</HEADLINE>
  (rk) 
 By JOEL BRINKLEY   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ With two federal judges pressing Microsoft and the
government to settle their antitrust case soon , Microsoft
presented a formal, written proposal Friday that would restrain
some of the company's business practices, officials said.
</P>
<P>
   Lawyers for the Justice Department and 19 state attorneys
general were studying the proposal Friday night to decide whether
it was promising enough to warrant weekend negotiations.
</P>
<P>
   Officials said the proposal included so much technical detail
that they could not analyze it quickly, although one also said
Microsoft ``appears to have come a long way with this, but not as
far as I think they should.''
</P>
<P>
   Reaching agreement with Microsoft, however, is only half of the
plaintiffs' task. They must also agree among themselves.
</P>
<P>
   The Justice Department and 19 state attorneys general are
partners in the suit, and among them hold a range of opinions on
what they could accept as a settlement. Some attorneys general
believe anything short of breaking up the company would be
ineffective, while others disagree. But officials said proposals
that would restructure the company have not been on the table in
the settlement talks.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday, Judge Thomas Penfield Jackson, who is trying the
case in federal court here, called lawyers from both sides to his
chambers to ask for a progress report on the settlement talks,
which have been under way since Nov. 30.
</P>
<P>
   The trial is over; all that is left is the verdict. But Jackson
is withholding it to give the settlement talks time to run their
course. On Tuesday, however, he made it clear that he was not
willing to wait beyond next week. And given his findings of fact in
the case, published in November, he is almost certain to find
Microsoft in violation of antitrust law _ prompting the company to
offer concessions Friday that officials said it had not offered
before.
</P>
<P>
   Richard Posner, chief judge of the U.S. Court of Appeals in
Chicago, who is serving as mediator, has been making similar
suggestions of urgency for weeks. Originally he said he wanted to
conclude the talks by early February.
</P>
<P>
   Since the meeting with Jackson this week, state and federal
officials have been furiously calling, e-mailing and meeting each
other in an effort to agree on a strategy. Many of the attorneys
general have been in Washington for an annual meeting that ended
Friday, and while here some of them have met with Joel I. Klein,
head of the Justice Department's antitrust division.
</P>
<P>
   But as the attorneys general consider Microsoft's proposal, the
states have no central decision-making process for deciding whether
it warrants serious negotiation, requiring lots of phone calls and
messages to reach a decision.
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday, after reports in The Wall Street Journal and The
Washington Post indicated that the pace of settlement talks had
increased, Microsoft's stock gained more than 7 percent. Friday it
closed at $111.6875, down 18.75 cents.
</P>
<P>
   Both state and federal officials said publicly that they would
not comment on the settlement talks, and none would describe the
proposal in detail. Microsoft declined to comment.
</P>
<P>
   But all of them appear to be keeping their options open to meet
in Chicago with Posner this weekend for talks. If government
lawyers decide Microsoft's new proposal is serious, Bill Gates,
Microsoft's chairman, and Klein might be expected to join the
talks.
</P>
<P>
   Several officials noted, however, that it was not easy to make a
decision because of the technical detail in the proposal. The last
time Microsoft and the government settled an antitrust case, in
1994, Gates insisted on one detail _ the ability to add new
features to Windows _ that seemed unimportant to the government at
the time but later proved to be the basis for the current suit.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our experience with this is not a happy one, not inspiring of
confidence,'' one official said. Several officials said it would
take time to analyze the document to make sure it does not include
similar potential vulnerabilities.
</P>
<P>
   All of Microsoft's proposals, they said, are for changes in
conduct. The company has made it clear, in the settlement talks and
in public, that it would not accept a breakup of the company.
Breakup proposals, the company has said, are ``an extreme and
reckless resolution to the government's antitrust suit.''
</P>
<P>
   But some government officials think anything short of that would
not be effective. As one official put it Friday: ``If we don't make
fundamental changes, then soon enough we'll be fighting this battle
all over again.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS.)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Other officials say they do not believe Jackson would accept a
structural remedy. And when Klein met with leaders of the
technology industry last fall, asking them for public support of
proposed sanctions against Microsoft _ without saying exactly what
he had in mind _ he received something short of enthusiastic
responses. Without industry support, a stringent remedy might be
hard to enact.
</P>
<P>
   Until now, Microsoft and government lawyers have been meeting
separately with Posner in Chicago. One day, the judge would talk to
one side, the next day to the other. And then the judge would try
to draw the two sides together. If the talks go forward next week,
the two sides will probably meet face to face for the first time
since their initial, organizational meeting with the judge on Nov.
30.
</P>
<P>
   At one stage of the talks early this year, Posner asked the
state and federal officials, one by one, for their proposed
remedies, and as each official offered his idea, the suggestions
were all over the map _ from restraining Microsoft's behavior to
breaking up the company. Never have all of the parties _ the
Justice Department and the 19 states _ come to agreement on a
common approach.
</P>
<P>
   Among the conduct remedies that have been discussed, officials
said, is forcing Microsoft to publish a common price list for
Windows so the company could not use prices to penalize or reward
computer makers for their level of cooperation with the company.
</P>
<P>
   Another idea would force Microsoft to publish the codes that
allow software writers to link their programs to Windows _ codes
known as applications program interfaces _ in a uniform, formal
way.
</P>
<P>
   If the settlement talks fail, Jackson's verdict could come
within a few days. After that, in a separate proceeding, the state
and federal governments will offer a remedy proposal to the judge.
For that, the Justice Department and attorneys general will have to
agree, because Jackson has made it clear he wants only one
proposal.

 US AIRWAYS, FLIGHT ATTENDANTS IN 11th-HOUR TALKS TO AVERT STRIKE

 By STEVEN GREENHOUSE   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Facing a strike deadline of 12:01 a.m. Saturday, US Airways and
its flight attendants' union reported modest progress Friday as
they negotiated late into the night in the hope of averting a
shutdown.
</P>
<P>
   The airline's management repeated Friday that if no agreement
was reached by the deadline, US Airways would suspend operations
beginning Saturday to avoid being whipsawed by the attendants'
planned partial strike.
</P>
<P>
   Adopting unorthodox tactics, the union's 10,000 flight
attendants have warned of a partial strike that would disrupt 49 of
the airline's busiest routes. Company officials fear that the
partial strike, which the union calls Chaos _ Create Havoc Around
Our System _ would tie the airline in knots and strand thousands of
passengers.
</P>
<P>
   At a news conference Friday in Washington, Patricia Friend,
president of the Association of Flight Attendants, said that the
union was continuing preparations for a strike, adding, ``We've
been able to settle a large number of issues, mostly the smaller
issues, but the larger issues of pay and pension remain
unresolved.''
</P>
<P>
   The union's leaders and Rakesh Gangwal, the airline's chief
executive, were still negotiating late Friday in an undisclosed
Washington hotel with the assistance of Ernest W. DuBester,
chairman of the National Mediation Board. Officials from both sides
said that the talks were difficult because the airline is intent on
reining in its operating costs, the highest in the industry, while
the attendants want a large raise because they have not had an
across-the-board pay increase in four years.
</P>
<P>
   The flight attendants have been bargaining with the airline
since 1996 and they became free to strike at 12:01 a.m. Saturday
when a federally mandated cooling-off period expired. Under federal
law, President Clinton has the power to order the airline and the
attendants to continue normal operations for 60 days, but officials
for both sides said they doubted he would do that because neither
side had requested such intervention.
</P>
<P>
   If he were to step in, several labor leaders said, it would
upset the AFL-CIO, which was unhappy when he intervened in 1997 to
abort a pilots' strike at American Airlines, a move that unions
felt weakened the pilots' leverage.
</P>
<P>
   The threat of a shutdown of the nation's sixth-largest airline,
whether through a strike or the company's pre-emptive action, was
sowing tension and chaos in airports around the nation Friday as
thousands of passengers rushed to change their reservations or seek
refunds on their tickets. On a typical day, US Airways operates
2,500 flights carrying a total of 150,000 passengers.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a considerable amount of nervousness out there,'' said
Michael Pingrey, owner of Act Travel, a Washington-based travel
agency. ``We're working hard to get people on other flights, but
it's getting tougher and tougher. Everyone has been trying to get
onto other flights, but all the other flights are booked up now.''
</P>
<P>
   A shutdown would do the greatest harm to the East Coast, where
US Airways, with 36 percent of the regional market, has the largest
market share. The cities expected to be hit hardest are Charlotte,
N.C., where the airline has 320 daily departures, accounting for 90
percent of airport traffic, and Pittsburgh, where it has 264 daily
departures, representing 86 percent of traffic.
</P>
<P>
   Delta Airlines has said that if US Air's New
York-Washington-Boston shuttle was suspended, it would add several
planes to the route, while Amtrak said it would add cars to its
trains to carry additional passengers between New York and
Washington.
</P>
<P>
   US Airways has arranged for other airlines and Amtrak to honor
its tickets if its operations are shut down. The airline advises
customers holding electronic tickets to call US Airways or a travel
agent, or to go to a US Airways counter, to get their tickets
reprocessed so that those tickets can be accepted at other
airlines.
</P>
<P>
   Philip Baggaley, an airline analyst at Standard &AMP; Poor's, said
that a shutdown would cost the airline $15 million to $20 million
in losses per day. But he said that the airline has more than $1
billion in cash on hand to help weather a shutdown, including a
$500 million credit line it recently drew down.
</P>
<P>
   To control its costs, US Airways is pressing the attendants to
accept a formula similar to one accepted by its other major unions,
a formula that would link the attendants' pay to the average of
their counterparts at the nation's four largest airlines plus 1
percent.
</P>
<P>
   But US Air's attendants have bridled at this, egged on by union
leaders who say that the formula put forward by management would
cut their pay and benefits. Resistance to the formula has been
fueled further by resentment toward the lofty compensation received
by US Air's top executives. Stephen M. Wolf, the chairman, received
$34.2 million last year in salary, bonus and stock option grants,
several times that of his counterparts at the top four airlines.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's outrageous that when they receive their large salaries
and bonuses and when the airline continues to prosper in a strong
economy, they expect us to take a pay cut and accept concessions,''
said Christopher Spangler, a $32,000-a-year flight attendant based
in Pittsburgh. Attendants' pay starts at $17,145 and rises to
$36,918 after 14 years.
</P>
<P>
   Company officials assert that their pay offer is generous
because it links the attendants not to their counterparts at
struggling companies, but to their counterparts at the industry
leaders: United, American, Delta and Northwest.
</P>
<P>
   US Air officials added that if the union accepted the parity
formula it would go far to restrain the airline's costs. These
officials added that if the attendants were to receive a higher
formula, then the airline's other major unions _ the pilots,
mechanics and passenger-service workers _ might demand to have
their contracts reopened.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is not about who is right or wrong or who wins or
loses,'' said Lawrence Nagin, executive vice president and general
counsel at US Airways. ``It's about this company being competitive
and doing what's right for our employees.''
</P>
<P>
   One sticking point has been the attendants' assertion that
management was pressuring them to accept the same version of the
parity formula as the pilots, and not a formula tailored
specifically to the attendants. But late Thursday the airline
announced that it was presenting different versions of the formula
to address the union's concerns while still enabling the airline to
restrain its costs.

<TEXT>
<P>
   After a three-month review of the risks of doing nothing, NASA
engineers and scientists decided Friday that the safest course
would be to direct the crippled 17-ton Compton Gamma Ray
Observatory to make a suicidal plunge out of orbit and back toward
Earth while they can still control its destructive fall so that it
comes down far from inhabited land.
</P>
<P>
   The decision disappointed astronomers, who had hoped for a few
more years of observations of the enigmatic flashes of gamma rays
that attest to some of the most bizarre and powerful phenomena in
the universe.
</P>
<P>
   But officials of the National Aeronautics and Space
Administration feared that one more failure by navigation
instruments would leave the huge $670 million spacecraft
uncontrollable, and that on its re-entry into the atmosphere it
might scatter debris over populated areas.
</P>
<P>
   At a news conference in Washington, Dr. Edward J. Weiler, NASA's
associate administrator for science, announced that the Compton
observatory's last day in orbit would be June 3, over nine years
after it was deployed by a space shuttle.
</P>
<P>
   ``The safest option is clearly to bring it down in June,''
Weiler said. ``We will lose valuable science. But the bottom line
is: There can be no trade-off between science and the least chance
of loss of life.''
</P>
<P>
   If the spacecraft wound up making an unguided return, he
estimated, there would be a 1-in-1,000 chance of a human fatality.
</P>
<P>
   Flight controllers at the Goddard Space Flight Center in
Greenbelt, Md., said the spacecraft's re-entry into the atmosphere
would be aimed for the sky over a remote 900-mile-long stretch of
the Pacific Ocean. The center of the re-entry area is on the
equator about 2,500 miles southeast of Hawaii, about 120 degrees
longitude.
</P>
<P>
   Though most of the craft should burn up in the atmosphere, 30 to
40 pieces of the titanium structure, each weighing as much as 40
pounds, could survive as potentially lethal shrapnel, NASA said.
</P>
<P>
   The Compton observatory's trouble began in December, when one of
the three gyroscopes used for guidance and navigation failed. If a
second gyroscope were to fail, the flight controllers would be
unable to control the spacecraft reliably. And the Goddard
engineers figured there was a 10 percent chance of losing another
gyroscope within three years.
</P>
<P>
   Under the circumstances, NASA officials said, they had little
choice but to bring the mission to a safe ending as soon as
possible. In the late 1970s, when the Skylab space station, an even
larger vehicle, came down out of control, debris fell over the
Indian Ocean and parts of western Australia, although with no
injuries and very little damage.
</P>
<P>
   Martin E. Frederick, associate chief of the Goddard guidance and
control center, said that nearly all systems on the Compton
spacecraft would be shut down on May 26, in preparation for the
four-stage re-entry maneuver.
</P>
<P>
   For the first step, braking thrusters will be fired to lower
Compton's orbital altitude to 220 miles from 316. The next two
firings, several days apart, will reduce the altitude to 90 miles.
On the fourth firing, the spacecraft will begin its fiery plunge
through the atmosphere.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Neil Gehrels, the Compton mission's chief scientist, said
astronomers ``will be quite disappointed with this decision,'' but
he added: ``We're not done. We have 62 days left, and we're going
to make the best use of every one of those minutes.''

FAMILY OF JASPER VICTIM UPSET OVER KKK STICKER ON GRAVE 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  (Attn: Ohio) 
 
By RICHARD STEWART 
c. 2000 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BEAUMONT, Texas _ The family of Jasper dragging death victim
James Byrd Jr. said Friday that they are upset by a glossy
magazine's photo of a Ku Klux Klan imperial wizard who placed a KKK
sticker on Byrd's grave.
</P>
<P>
   ``He definitely needs to stay away from that gravesite,'' said
Byrd's sister, Clara Taylor, of Houston. ``That won't be
tolerated.''
</P>
<P>
   Byrd, a 49-year-old black man, was killed June 7, 1998, when he
was chained by the ankles to a pickup and dragged for three miles.
His dismembered body was found on a road in front of a black
cemetery east of Jasper. Three white men were convicted of capital
murder and two were sentenced to die for the slaying.
</P>
<P>
   The April edition of Details magazine shows a photograph of
19-year-old James Roesch, imperial wizard of the Knights of the
White Kamellia, and his wife, April, standing beside Byrd's grave
in Jasper City Cemetery.
</P>
<P>
   The magazine said Roesch, who moved to Jasper after Byrd's
death, left a small sticker on the headstone that said, ``A Ku Klux
Klansman Was Here.''
</P>
<P>
   Betty Boatner, another of Byrd's sisters, said she saw the
sticker on the grave but refused to comment further.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's almost sacrilegious,'' Taylor said. ``The nerve of him
to do something like that.''
</P>
<P>
   Roesch, who works as a logger, could not be reached for comment,
and a phone message left with a Details magazine spokeswoman was
not returned.
</P>
<P>
   The Conde Nast publication, promoted as a lifestyles magazine
for Generation X readers, recently announced it was closing. Plans
are to relaunch it as a monthly men's fashion magazine.
</P>
<P>
   Byrd's grave has been vandalized before. Last year someone pried
loose a stainless steel name plate that had been attached to the
concrete vault that covers the grave. After that, Byrd's name was
engraved in a stainless steel slab that covers the vault and a
black granite headstone was erected at the head of the grave.
</P>
<P>
   Taylor said she and other family members are considering what
actions to take. ``A restraining order is a possibility,'' she
said.
</P>
<P>
   She said she wants to find out more about the circumstances of
the article and added that she believed Roesch was ``just doing it
to get publicity.''
</P>
<P>
   Jasper County Sheriff Billy Rowles said authorities are looking
into the matter, but the KKK sticker was gone by the time officers
got there. Rowles said officers will file charges of desecrating a
grave against anyone found defacing Byrd's grave.
</P>
<P>
   Jasper has been the scene of several small Klan rallies as well
as rallies by black power groups since Byrd's death. The rallies
were mainly put on by members from other areas.
</P>
<P>
   Local officials said they knew of no organized Klan activities
before Roesch moved to town from Kettering, Ohio, in 1998.

 &HT;    Gender gap: Legion of male coaches dwindling
 &HT;    By Wendy Parker

<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ The idea of returning to his native state was so
tempting for Bill Fennelly five years ago that he paid little
attention to the fact that Iowa State was regarded as one of the
worst coaching jobs in women's college basketball.
</P>
<P>
   Even before he turned the Cyclones' program into one of the
nation's best, Fennelly, who had modest success at the University
of Toledo for more than a decade, felt he was fortunate to have the
opportunity to move up. As it turns out, he is, and for quite a few
other reasons than what he originally had in mind.
</P>
<P>
   Today, he will be one of four men coaching teams in the women's
Sweet 16. Louisiana Tech coach Leon Barmore, who announced his
retirement effective at the end of the season, could meet Fennelly
and Iowa State in the final of the Midwest Regional if both win
today.
</P>
<P>
   Although it's conceivable that three male-coached teams could
reach the Final Four for the first time, Barmore's impending
departure comes at a time when male coaches in the sport are seeing
their numbers decline in the upper echelons.
</P>
<P>
   Because parity has not risen to the top in women's basketball,
it helps to be at one of the big schools if you want to win a
national championship. Only two men can make that claim: Barmore in
1988, and Connecticut's Geno Auriemma in 1995.
</P>
<P>
   Of 69 positions in the six major conferences, only 13 are held
by men. Two of those leagues _ the Pac-10 and the Big Ten _ don't
have any. The ACC has one.
</P>
<P>
   While a number of other women's collegiate sports are dominated
by male coaches _ particularly volleyball, soccer, swimming and
diving, and track and field _ basketball long has been a
battleground over gender-based hiring issues.
</P>
<P>
   The four men whose teams are still alive _ Fennelly, Barmore,
Auriemma and Georgia's Andy Landers _ all of have coached women's
basketball for 20 years or longer. But because of political
pressures placed on major schools to hire women, and because of the
development of the sport in producing former players who have
gotten into coaching, younger men appear less likely to follow in
their footsteps.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not something a young man can go into thinking, `if I
work hard, in about 10 years I can get a big job,' `` Fennelly
said. ``It's going to be harder for a lot of guys. There are a lot
of (women) players who want to get those jobs. I just think it's an
evolution in the game.''
</P>
<P>
   Roughly one third of Division I women's coaches are women, but
the percentages of men go up as the level of competition goes down.
Men are still the vast majority of girls' coaches at the high
school, youth and AAU levels, where the pay and the prestige are
lower.
</P>
<P>
   Some 30 years after the establishment of the women's college
game, females who benefitted from Title IX playing opportunities
are becoming the candidates of choice. Many earned their coaching
stripes as assistants for men.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a natural progression of our mission to encourage girls
to play,'' said Beth Bass, executive director of the Lilburn-based
Women's Basketball Coaches Association. ``It's natural for them to
be introduced into coaching that way.''
</P>
<P>
   Former Georgia Tech assistant coach Lisa Stockton, a standout
player at Wake Forest in the mid-1980s, has taken Tulane to six
straight NCAA appearances, and her name is frequently mentioned
when openings at major schools occur.
</P>
<P>
   Among those reportedly being wooed by Michigan State is Xavier
coach Melanie Balcomb, whose father was an assistant to the
legendary Pete Carril at Princeton. Another leading prospect for
moving up in the ranks is Evansville coach Kathi Bennett, the
daughter of Wisconsin men's coach Dick Bennett.
</P>
<P>
   Naturally, the subject is a touchy one on the other side of the
spectrum. The appointment of Fennelly's Big 12 rival, Paul
Sanderford of Nebraska, was held up for several weeks in 1997
because of pressure from state legislators to consider women
candidates. Even Fennelly wasn't originally considered by Iowa
State, which eventually extended its search to include men.
</P>
<P>
   ``There haven't been very many (men) in very visible Division I
jobs in recent years,'' Landers said. ``If that's the trend, then
that's the trend. If it's not, then I've misread the deal.''
</P>
<P>
   In the SEC, considered the top conference in women's basketball,
gender hasn't been much of a concern. Five of its 12 coaches are
men, although four of them have been at their schools from between
eight to 20 years.
</P>
<P>
   Georgia assistant coach Michael Shafer has been on Landers'
staff the last five years, and has been involved with the Lady
Bulldogs' program since attending first Landers' camps at the age
of 14. The son of former Georgia associate athletics director and
current Mississippi AD John Shafer, the younger Shafer, now 28, has
moved up from a graduate assistant to a full-time aide with
substantial recruiting responsibilities.
</P>
<P>
   His prospects, should he want to take the next step, are
uncertain, to say the least. Shafer was reluctant to be
interviewed, and according a team spokesman, he hasn't thought much
about becoming a women's head coach.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are a lot of them who like what they do but they'll
always be a well-paid assistant coach or they'll have to take a
step down,'' Fennelly said. ``I get a letter a day from players who
want to get into coaching. I think it's good; this is the women's
game after all.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I understand why it's still an issue and a concern for (male
coaches),'' said Bass of the WBCA, which has set up an advisory
board for male coaches.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's like what women have had to go through for many years.
They're going to have to be better than the average candidate. And
they've got to be twice as good as a female candidate.''

   WASHINGTON WATCH VOTE CHART Questions regarding this
transmission should be directed to 202-628-3100, ext. 227.
WASHINGTON, March 24 -- The following chart shows how senators and
representatives voted on key bills and amendments within the last
week. A ``Y'' means the member voted for the measure; an ``N''
means the member voted against the measure; a ``?'' means the
member did not vote; and a ``P'' means the member voted
``present.''
</P>
<P>
   SENATE VOTES:
</P>
<P>
   1) BILL NUMBER: Security
</P>
<P>
   The Senate on Wednesday approved, 100 to 0, a bill that would
allow senior citizens, ages 65 through 69, to receive full Social
Security benefits if they decide to continue working after reaching
retirement age. Supporters, including President Clinton, said the
bill would help seniors struggling to make ends meet. There were no
opponents to the measure. A ``yes'' vote favors the bill.
</P>
<P>
   2) BILL NUMBER: Insurance
</P>
<P>
   The Senate on Thursday approved, 95 to 5, a $6 billion spending
measure to overhaul the nation's crop insurance system. The plan
puts $5 billion toward revising the current risk management program
and $1 billion toward researching new programs. Supporters said the
insurance plan reduces dependence on government disaster relief
programs. Opponents said the bill contained too much spending. A
``yes'' vote favors the bill.

</P>
<P>
   HOUSE VOTES:
</P>
<P>
   1) BILL NUMBER: Waste
</P>
<P>
   The House on Wednesday approved, 253 to 167, a bill to create a
permanent nuclear waste storage site at Yucca Mountain, Nevada. The
measure would allow 40,000 tons of radioactive waste around the
country to be transported to the site 90 miles north of Las Vegas.
Supporters said removing waste from temporary storage sites was
long overdue. Opponents, including President Clinton -- who intends
to veto the measure, say the plan is not environmentally sound. A
``yes'' vote favors the measure.
</P>
<P>
   2) BILL NUMBER: Oil
</P>
<P>
   The House on Wednesday approved, 382 to 38, a bill that makes it
U.S. policy to work with other oil importing nations to stop price
fixing by some oil exporting nations. Supporters said the bill
forces the president to take a tough stance on oil producers.
Opponents said the scaled-back version was weak and should contain
language instructing Clinton to cut military and economic aid to
countries that fix oil prices. A ``yes'' vote favors the bill.
</P>
<P>
   3) BILL NUMBER: Budget
</P>
<P>
   The House on Thursday rejected, 184 to 233, a five-year budget
plan that contained fewer tax cuts and more debt reduction monies
than a similar plan that later passed. The measure would have
provided prescription drug benefits for Medicare recipients.
Supporters said the bill would offer adequate tax relief while
reducing the nation's debt. Opponents said the tax cuts were not
large enough. A ``yes'' vote favors the measure.
</P>
<P>
   4) BILL NUMBER: Budget2
</P>
<P>
   The House on Thursday approved, 211 to 207, a five-year, $1.8
trillion budget plan. The measure, which would cut taxes $240
billion over five years, increases spending for defense, education,
and prescription drug benefits for Medicare recipients. Supporters
said the bill ensures fiscal discipline while freeing up money for
tax relief. Opponents said the tax cut was too large. A ``yes''
vote favors the measure.

   For AOL-Time Warner, Triumph of the Hard Sell &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   America Online, of course, is a master of the hard sell, from
stuffing mailboxes with free trial offers to forcing subscribers to
click through ads before they can get their e-mail.
</P>
<P>
   Those skills apparently served the company well this year, after
investors fled in the wake of its proposed merger with Time Warner.
</P>
<P>
   For six weeks after the huge deal was announced on Jan. 10,
America Online shares fell steadily. By Feb. 22, they stood at
$49.625, compared with $73.75 before the merger announcement,
wiping out more than $100 billion of the combined market value of
the two companies.
</P>
<P>
   The drop, which was attributed to America Online investors'
disdain for Time Warner's slow growth rate, led some people to
speculate that AOL might have to increase the price it had agreed
to pay for Time Warner _ or that even the merger itself might be at
risk.
</P>
<P>
   But through that rough stretch, America Online and Time Warner
executives said that they remained committed to each other and that
the terms of agreement were set. The selling of the deal went on,
publicly and privately. Reporters who called to ask about the deal
were apt to find themselves on conference calls with senior
executives from both companies. At the same time, America Online
and Time Warner officials fanned out to meet face to face with
institutional investors.
</P>
<P>
   The companies turned on ``a full court press,'' said John
Schreiber, an assistant portfolio manager at Janus Capital, which
will be among the largest holders of the combined company. ``They
made lots of joint appearances and tried to get everybody
introduced to both sides.''
</P>
<P>
   After weeks of delay, top Wall Street analysts began to crank
out positive reports on the proposed deal, complete with the
requisite punditry. ``America Online/Time Warner: Perfect
Time-ing,'' Goldman Sachs chirped in one cheery report.
</P>
<P>
   Lo and behold, the stocks of America Online and Time Warner
began to rally. By the close of trading on Friday, AOL shares stood
at $71, just below their level before the deal was announced. At
that price, the combined company has a market value of more than
$350 billion.
</P>
<P>
   And talk that the merger might not happen has faded.
</P>
<P>
   Schreiber, who sees the stock as still undervalued even after
its recent run-up, said, ``It just takes these things a while to
get understood and communicated.''
</P>
<P>
   AOL shareholders are fortunate that their company is a smooth
communicator.

   Patent No. 6,003,018, For Asset Allocation &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Many people have devised winning investment strategies _
although it helps to have a bull-market wind at your back. But
Richard Michaud and his son, Robert, have gone a step further. They
have received a United States patent for theirs.
</P>
<P>
   The government awarded patent No. 6,003,018 to the pair for what
they call ``the first serious improvement in portfolio construction
and asset allocation technology in almost 50 years.''
</P>
<P>
   Building on the pioneering efforts of Harry Markowitz, the Nobel
laureate from the University of Chicago, the Michauds say numerous
portfolios provide optimal combinations of return and risk _ not
just one, as many academics and investors had long supposed. That
means that a portfolio might not need as much adjustment as it
traditionally has in order to achieve an optimal mix of assets.
That, in turn, could cut trading costs by as much as 60 percent.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a Herculean leap in the state of the art,'' contended C.
Michael Carty, a managing director in New York of New Frontier
Advisors, a Boston-based company founded last year to exploit the
patented technique.
</P>
<P>
   But while the patent appears to be the first in its niche _
identifying optimal portfolio allocation strategy _ the Patent and
Trademark Office issued nearly 600 patents last year alone for
computer-related business methods, some of them involving
investments.
</P>
<P>
   And while the Michauds' method, the ROM Optimizer, met the four
official tests of patentability _ that it be new, useful,
nonobvious (that is, not just slightly incremental) and fully
disclosed _ the government does not insist on take-it-to-the-bank
proof that an investment strategy makes or saves money. It's a
matter of persuading patent examiners of, in effect, plausible
practicality.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our examiners determine that it would do what it says it
does,'' said Brigid Quinn, an agency spokeswoman, ``based on a
written description.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   For all those who doubt that a speculative bubble hangs
dangerously over the economy _ and the doubters number in the tens
of millions _ Robert J. Shiller's new book is sobering. He
describes a market so out of control that the run-up in the Roaring
'20s looks like a molehill, compared with the Mount Everest of the
'90s.
</P>
<P>
   Shiller, a Yale University economist, called his book
``Irrational Exuberance,'' borrowing the phrase coined by Alan
Greenspan in December 1996. The Federal Reserve chairman has tried
ever since to soften stock prices, but investors _ that is, nearly
half the population _ have laughed in his face. The Fed notches up
interest rates and stocks rise anyway, as if they were an addiction
like cigarettes or liquor, just as much in need of a warning label.
</P>
<P>
   Posting such a label _ in this case, coming right out and saying
that we are in a stock market bubble _ would be the sort of
government intervention that Greenspan resists. But stocks today
are greatly overvalued _ perhaps by more than $7 trillion, Shiller
says _ and even free-market economists wonder about the efficacy of
the Fed's interest rate strategy.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some of us believe that the speculation has gone so far that
there is no easy or painless way out,'' said one such economist on
Wall Street, Albert Wojnilower. ``The question is whether to
acknowledge this and open the floor to other solutions. That is
what Greenspan would be doing if he declared that speculation is
driving up stock prices.''
</P>
<P>
   Greenspan said in 1996 _ and he continues to say today _ that
irrational exuberance (italics)might(end italics) be driving up
stock prices. But he has never stepped over the line and bluntly
stated that it is. Instead, he has kept one foot firmly planted in
the camp of those who regard the market's performance as rational.
</P>
<P>
   Rising productivity and the prospect of rising corporate
profits, he says, bring investors tumbling sensibly into stocks in
anticipation of future gains.
</P>
<P>
   Greenspan has acquired enormous prestige for his astute
nurturing of the economy in recent years. But he is in danger of
dissipating that prestige by insisting on rational monetary policy
_ the notching up of interest rates _ to discipline an irrational
situation. Why should investors be deterred from borrowing money at
6 percent or even 10 percent, Wojnilower asks, when they believe
that stocks bought with the borrowed money will go up 20 percent by
year-end? Getting interest rates high enough to stop that fervor
would bust the economy.
</P>
<P>
   What would happen if Greenspan declared bluntly that irrational
exuberance controls the market and is running roughshod over all
the sensible reasons for owning stocks? For one thing, such
frankness would encounter resistance.
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton administration, in an election year, prefers to view
the market as reflecting corporate America's strength and
profitability. And most Wall Street traders like Greenspan's
current ambivalence.
</P>
<P>
   But public recognition of the bubble might finally propel
America into vigorous debate about ways to control the market
fever.
</P>
<P>
   There are a half-dozen remedies besides higher rates. On
everyone's list is tightening margin requirements. Investors could
be required to put up 60 percent or 70 percent of the purchase
price of a stock, instead of the present 50 percent. Greenspan
objects that small investors, the biggest users of margin debt,
would be forced more than big investors to pull back. But they
would also be saved from painful losses in a market sell-off.
</P>
<P>
   Bank regulators could put up another obstacle to the purchase of
securities on credit. They could require banks to increase the
capital that backs such loans, which by one measure rose to $23.4
billion in February from $18.1 billion just last November. The
government, in effect, would be allocating credit, a role shunned
in Washington today.
</P>
<P>
   A transaction tax on all stock trades, of the sort once proposed
by James Tobin, the Nobel laureate in economics, would slow
trading. So would an old Warren Buffett idea: a 100 percent capital
gains tax on stocks held for too short a term, say less than a
year. That would encourage people to invest for the long term, more
cautiously.
</P>
<P>
   The so-called suitability rules could also be extended. These
require brokers to check that a customer's investment goals are in
line with his income, net worth and the like. A broker is bound by
the rules to discourage a grandmother from sinking all her savings
into a profitless Internet company.
</P>
<P>
   Suitability rules do not now cover day traders and online
investors, though formal proposals already exist to extend them.
</P>
<P>
   Remedies like these might sap the speculation without bringing
down the economy. But even proponents worry that it is already too
late to prevent a damaging market crash or a painful sell-off _ the
denouement in the past of speculative bubbles that have gone
unrecognized for so long.

   AREQUIPA, Peru _ When Peru's Congress got in President Alberto
Fujimori's way, he abolished it. When three judges wanted to uphold
a constitutional ban on his running for a third term, Fujimori
simply had them fired. Not even the most vicious terrorist group in
Latin America could resist him.
</P>
<P>
   But when it comes to toughness, Fujimori appears to be no match
for his former wife. Susana Higuchi, who as first lady became the
object of international attention six years ago when she said she
was being held prisoner and screamed out state secrets from a
fourth-story window of the presidential palace, has now taken their
domestic spat on the campaign trail.
</P>
<P>
   Higuchi, divorced from Fujimori four years ago, is running a
strong campaign for Congress, and many pollsters predict she will
win even though she is attached to a minor left-leaning political
party. She carries a symbolic broom on the stump and calls for
social justice and an end to what she calls ``the dictatorship''
led by her former husband.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have to say enough is enough with this immoral, corrupt
system,'' Higuchi recently told an auditorium full of women who
were attending a seminar here about women's issues. ``There are
journalists _ obviously bought off _ who ask if I am still angry at
President Fujimori. And I say yes! What kind of political bossism
is this?''
</P>
<P>
   As the 250 women gasped in horror, she said that Fujimori had
treated Abimael Guzman, the imprisoned leader of the
Maoist-inspired Shining Path terrorist group, better than he had
treated her. ``He sent him a cake for his birthday!'' she said. (In
an interview later, she said that Fujimori never did the same for
her during their 22-year marriage.)
</P>
<P>
   Higuchi, a 49-year-old civil engineer and businesswoman, still
has the political stature of a first lady. She is the object of
long profiles in the political magazines, and her news conferences
are often better attended than those of presidential candidates.
She says little to muffle the widely held speculation that her
ambition is to get the ultimate revenge on Fujimori by becoming the
first woman to serve as Peru's president.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   As her campaign caravan moved through the streets and markets of
this enchanting Andean mountain city of pearl-white colonial
churches, people shrieked and applauded as if she were a movie
star. Some threw flower petals over her and handed her bouquets of
white carnations, while others exploded firecrackers in
celebration.
</P>
<P>
   ``Give Alberto a spanking,'' cried out one middle-aged man as
her campaign van passed. Later, a woman pressed against her van
window as the vehicle became snarled in traffic to plead with her
to get back together with her husband.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Fujimori refuses to criticize her candidacy, and his
intelligence service _ which has helped upend other politicians _
has so far laid off Higuchi's campaign. Fujimori appeared at the
recent funeral of Higuchi's father and walked beside his former
wife and their eldest daughter, Keiko Sofia, during the funeral
procession.
</P>
<P>
   In turn, even while Higuchi sharply criticizes her former
husband's governing style, she has helped him a bit lately by
publicly denying recurring rumors that he has cancer and that he is
not a native Peruvian but was born in Japan.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   She has also dropped her old habits of complaining about
Fujimori's bedside comportment and questioning his commitment to
Roman Catholicism. Nevertheless, Higuchi said in an interview that
there is ``zero'' chance for a reconciliation.
</P>
<P>
   When reporters here asked her to comment on press reports about
irregularities in Fujimori's campaign, including an accusation that
his backers forged 1 million signatures to get him on the ballot,
she simply said, ``He never keeps his word.''
</P>
<P>
   But even if her criticism of the president is somewhat more
muted these days, opposition leaders say her campaign for Congress
is putting a spotlight on the dark side of Fujimori's personality
and hurting his chances for re-election on April 9.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   The Peruvian press has taken to calling the saga of the couple's
relationship ``La Show Susana'' and ``Fujidrama.''
</P>
<P>
   The marriage between the former first couple showed its first
public signs of deterioration in 1992, when Higuchi said that some
of Fujimori's relatives were skimming off aid given by Japan. By
1994, the relationship had soured so much and Higuchi's criticisms
had become so strident that she said Fujimori's bodyguards had
locked her in a room in the presidential palace. Higuchi called
reporters in the middle of the night to complain, and later went on
a hunger strike.
</P>
<P>
   Higuchi announced her intention to run for president against her
husband in 1995, but the electoral tribunal disqualified her.
Congress enacted a bill prohibiting presidential relatives from
running for president in what became known as the ``Susana Law.''
</P>
<P>
   That is all history now, but Higuchi's campaign has revitalized
speculation about the former first couple's love lives.
</P>
<P>
   A few months ago, Fujimori told his favorite television talk
show host, Laura Bozzo, that he did not have a girlfriend but that
he was looking for one. He said he needed at least 10 dates to fall
in love.
</P>
<P>
   As for Higuchi, she said in an interview that she has no
interest in meeting other men and that she has dedicated her life
to Jesus.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am too busy with my work,'' she said.

POPE TELLS YOUTHS TO KEEP THE FAITH 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By CHARLES M. SENNOTT  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   KORAZIN, Israel _ Overlooking the Mount of Beatitudes where
Jesus once gathered his disciples, Pope John Paul II presided
Friday over a Mass devoted to youths that brought together an
estimated 75,000 worshipers from all over the world.
</P>
<P>
   In a voice unusually strong and clear, the ailing, 79-year-old
pope called for faith in Jesus in an age in which young people are
tempted by violence, greed, and ambition.
</P>
<P>
   ``His call has always demanded a choice between the two voices
competing for your hearts, even now on this hill, the choice
between good and evil, between life and death,'' he said. ``Which
voice will the young people of the 21st century choose to follow?''
</P>
<P>
   The pageantry of the event, beginning with the Pope's grand
entrance through a crowd waving national flags and welcoming
banners into a natural amphitheater overlooking the Sea of Galilee,
seemed lifted from another century.
</P>
<P>
   Among the tens of thousands of worshipers were students from
Germany and Poland, immigrant workers from the Philippines and
Nigeria, parishioners from Mexico and Costa Rica, and pilgrims who
had flown in from Detroit and Denver.
</P>
<P>
   Nearly half were from an international movement known as the
Neo-Catechumenal Way that grew out of the slums of Madrid a quarter
century ago and has flourished especially in Europe and Latin
America. The movement, a politically conservative evangelical wing
of the Catholic Church, advocates adult catechism and baptism and
helping the poor.
</P>
<P>
   Peter Waymel, 22, an adherent of the Way from St. Louis Parish
in Denver, said, ``The words of the pope are very encouraging for
youth today, and a very important alternative to the messages they
hear every day in movies, the Internet, the streets, shallow
messages that in the end shatter their lives.''
</P>
<P>
   The pilgrims also included Palestinian Christians, a dwindling
minority in the Holy Land, sprinkled among the Europeans and
Americans. Many were seeing the Galilee for the first time in their
lives, because Israeli checkpoints usually block their access from
traveling from Palestinian-controlled areas to most places in
Israel.
</P>
<P>
   ``I live two hours from here, and I have never been allowed to
come here,'' said Wafa Arga, 19, of Bethlehem. ``We hope that the
Pope's presence here will help show the world what we live with
here as Palestinians and as Christians. We hope his visit will push
forward the peace process in a way that we can someday get on with
our lives.''
</P>
<P>
   Amid the pageantry were some very obvious security measures, as
Israeli police and army deployed in an operation of unprecedented
scale.
</P>
<P>
   The pope delivered his sermon from behind a bulletproof glass
shield. Israeli bomb squad units fanned out around the site. And
Israeli police carrying machine guns ringed the perimeter.
</P>
<P>
   Some Vatican officials have privately criticized the security
measures, saying they appreciated the Israelis' concern but found
the show of force excessive. When the pope travels Sunday to
Nazareth and Monday to Jerusalem's Old City, both flashpoints of
conflict, security is expected to grow even tighter.
</P>
<P>
   The Korazin gathering took place on a rocky hillside, its
terraced slopes blanketed in green grass and wild flowers. This
countryside, with red anemones and blue iris sprouting among the
gray, craggy rocks, was the setting for many of Jesus's parables.
</P>
<P>
   The pope recalled that it was on the same site that Jesus
gathered his 12 disciples for the Sermon on the Mount. One of them,
Peter, a fisherman believed to be from the village of Capernaum at
the foot of the mount, would be handed the responsibility of
building the church.
</P>
<P>
   The aging pontiff, who Catholics believe is the spiritual
successor to Peter, seemed particularly animated and forceful in
delivering his sermon on this site.
</P>
<P>
   He told the gathering that the Sermon on the Mount, which
begins, ``Blessed are the poor in spirit, for theirs is the kingdom
of heaven,'' represents for Christians a new understanding of the
Hebrew Bible's Ten Commandments, a message that the fufillment of
God's Law comes ``through love.''

BUSH'S EDUCATION IDEAS CONTESTED AT ARKANSAS HIGH SCHOOL 
</HEADLINE>
  (With BUSH-EXCERPTS) 
(mk) 
 By FRANK BRUNI   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   LITTLE ROCK, Ark. _ Visiting a high school here that was a
historic battleground in the fight to integrate public schools in
the South, Gov. George W. Bush faced open skepticism Friday from
several educators and a student leader who questioned his proposals
to improve education for minority and disadvantaged children.
</P>
<P>
   Bush traveled to Central High School, where federal troops were
deployed in September 1957 to escort nine black students past
rioters, to say that while minority children were no longer denied
access to institutions of learning, they were too often denied the
same quality of education that more privileged peers received. The
Texas governor said that he wanted to change that.
</P>
<P>
   But a few of the 10 participants in a panel discussion that he
staged in the school's library wondered aloud about the efficacy of
his prescriptions.
</P>
<P>
   The school's principal, Rudolph Howard, said that Bush's
advocacy of greater local flexibility in the use of federal
education funds would not necessarily do enough to help financially
strapped public schools meet the demands of paying teachers higher
salaries and repairing crumbling buildings. Vice President Al Gore
has proposed additional federal money for both of those goals.
</P>
<P>
   Howard began to make that case to Bush in the panel discussion,
then toughened and expanded his criticism in a conversation with
reporters afterward.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want something very tangible in place that would be
encouraging for those of us who have to carry the ball,'' Howard
said, adding that Bush's push for more local control and his plea
for high standards were ``pie-in-the-sky, hopeful kinds of things
that we have existed on for years and years.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd like to hear him say he's going to commit to something,''
the principal added. ``All these catch phrases are horses that are
not going to trot anymore.''
</P>
<P>
   Derrick Williams, the student council president, said that
Bush's support of programs to allow students to use public money
for private education would divert resources and energy from public
schools and make it harder to provide the children who remained
there with an adequate education.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't really agree with the concept of it,'' Williams, who
is 18, told the governor.
</P>
<P>
   The exchanges illustrated the difficulty that Bush, the
presumptive Republican presidential nominee, may encounter in
convincing some Americans that his vision for public schools is the
right one and that it is tailored with the neediest students in
mind. Those claims are cornerstones of Bush's presentation of
himself as a ``compassionate conservative.''
</P>
<P>
   In recent years, polls have shown that on the issue of education
Americans trust Democrats more than Republicans. But Bush is trying
to turn that around, and some polls released over the last two
weeks suggest that he and Gore, the presumptive Democratic nominee,
are on relatively equal footing on the issue.
</P>
<P>
   Bush's appearance at Central High School, where 57 percent of
the roughly 2,000 students are black, demonstrated his confidence
in his ability to sell his ideas and his willingness to hash them
around even with likely critics.
</P>
<P>
   But Bush was clearly after powerful political theater, not
polite public dissent, in staging the event at a place that he
called ``a symbol that prejudice may run deep, but goodness runs
deeper.''
</P>
<P>
   His scripted remarks at the start of the panel discussion took
in the sweep of the civil rights movement and included the comment
that the continuing gap in the achievement of white children and
black children perpetuated a divided society.
</P>
<P>
   ``Whatever the cause,'' Bush said, ``the effect is
discrimination.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Our common ground,'' he added, ``is found in our common
schools. And we must make those schools worthy of all our children.
This, I believe, is the next advance in the cause of equality, the
next frontier of civil rights.''
</P>
<P>
   Although Bush's education proposals call for some enhanced
federal financing, they turn more strongly on giving states and
local school districts additional discretion and authority in how
they use existing federal money. Bush also envisions financial
incentives and punishments to motivate schools whose students test
poorly.
</P>
<P>
   Sustained failure would mean forfeiting some federal assistance,
which would be rechanneled so that parents could use that money to
help pay for private educational options or so that more charter
schools could be established.
</P>
<P>
   The panelists at Central High School largely concurred with
Bush's call for higher educational standards, his vision of an
accountability system and his advocacy of local control.
</P>
<P>
   But several seemed to want a much greater financial commitment
from the federal government, which Bush seemed wary of making.
</P>
<P>
   He told a middle school principal who had raised the issue of
teachers' salaries: ``I just caution you not to expect the federal
government to be paying teachers more money.'' Bush said that was a
local prerogative, which he strongly recommended.

MEXICANS TAKE DIM VIEW OF DAYLIGHT SAVING 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RICHARD CHACON  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   MEXICO CITY _ Ruben Escandon will wake up Sunday at the same
time he does every day _ 6:45 a.m. _ but he's not happy about that.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's going to be dark, and I'm going to have to eat my
breakfast with the lights on,'' said Escandon, 52, a parking lot
attendant. ``I'll probably get to work before the sun comes up.''
</P>
<P>
   Clocks and watches all across Mexico will move ahead one hour at
midnight Saturday, the country's version of daylight saving time,
better known here as summer hours. But a growing number of Mexicans
would prefer to keep their timepieces set just the way they are.
</P>
<P>
   Taking a cue from 75 countries, including the United States,
where daylight saving is observed on the first Sunday in April,
Mexico adopted the spring-forward/fall-back schedule in 1996 as a
way to conserve energy and to keep their work schedules
synchronized with key foreign markets and time zones.
</P>
<P>
   But the time change has created a surge of complaints, from
worried parents to proud citizens, who argue that summer hours
endanger children and hurt national pride.
</P>
<P>
   About a dozen Mexican states have formed a mini-revolt over
summer hours, threatening to pass laws that would supersede the
federal government's program and keep them fixed on standard time.
This year, the states of Morelos and Aguascalientes have joined the
list of provinces opposed to summer hours.
</P>
<P>
   The debate over the time change has also trickled into this
year's heated mayoral campaign in Mexico City, where council
members have vowed to keep the capital on standard time. Santiago
Creel, a mayoral candidate from the center-right National Action
Party, has called for a citywide referendum on the issue.
</P>
<P>
   The biggest beef over summer hours has come from parents who say
their children will be forced to walk or ride from crime-ridden
neighborhoods to school before sunrise for three months of the
school year. On Monday, the sun will be up just before 8 a.m.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've seen some children carry flashlights to school,'' said
Olga Camares, 29, a mother of three daughters. ``At least they
should wait for summer hours until the school year is over.''
</P>
<P>
   Other critics of the change offer a conspiracy theory: Summer
hours is yet another sign of US habits infiltrating Mexican
culture.
</P>
<P>
   Federal officials contend the plan is a more rational use of
sunlight, and they credit the summer program for reducing the
country's electricity demand, especially during peak evening hours,
because the sun sets later.
</P>
<P>
   Government figures show that electricity demand has declined by
1,500 megawatts from 7 p.m. to 10 p.m. Although the change has
increased demand in the pre-dawn by roughly 10 million lightbulbs,
it has cut evening demand by three times that amount, officials
said.
</P>
<P>
   What's more, supporters of the shift argue, less demand on the
country's power plants means less fuel to keep them running, and
less pollution. Mexico's Energy Secretariat estimates the summer
hours initiative saves 2 million barrels of petroleum a year.
</P>
<P>
   Although Mexico's summertime clock is only five years old, the
country has flirted on and off with the idea for decades. The
northern state of Baja California first adopted the schedule in
1942.
</P>
<P>
   The federal government took up the idea in the mid-1990s.
Officials surveyed business leaders and citizens and studied the
possible consequences of the 60-minute change.
</P>
<P>
   ``This idea was considered very carefully,'' one energy official
said Friday with a sigh of exasperation. ``We even looked at
whether it would affect people's health to wake up earlier or stay
up later.''
</P>
<P>
   To be sure, some Mexicans welcome the change, especially the
prospect of a longer and brighter evening, which will last until
the final Sunday in October, when clocks are set back to standard
time.
</P>
<P>
   ``It makes me feel better to have the extra daylight,'' said
Yudi Corvera, a 34-year-old Mexico City writer. ``It's the sign
that spring and summer are finally here.''

CROWD ON MOUNT OF BEATITUDES: `JOHN PAUL II, WE LOVE YOU!' 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By DEBORAH HORAN 
c. 2000 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   KORAZIM, Israel _ They came from as far away as Venezuela,
Uganda and the Philippines on Friday with water bottles, rain coats
and high spirits to listen to Pope John Paul II celebrate Mass on
the mount where they believe Jesus gave his famous sermon nearly
2000 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   By 10 a.m., tens of thousands of young Roman Catholics from all
over the world covered a muddy hillside the size of two football
stadiums overlooking the Sea of Galilee.
</P>
<P>
   They stood in groups or sat together on plastic tarps covering
the wet ground. They sang hymns, played guitars and waved flags,
transforming the hill into a cacophony of sound and hodgepodge of
color and as they waited for the pontiff to arrive.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's so marvelous to be here,'' said Crispin Chanda Witika of
Zambia, ``To see such an event, it's the work of God for me.''
</P>
<P>
   The 79-year-old pope may have waded into the Israeli-Palestinian
conflict during the first few days of his weeklong visit to the
Holy Land. But to the 100,000 people gathered to receive John
Paul's blessings on the Mount of Beatitudes, his presence was
purely spiritual.
</P>
<P>
   ``Two thousand years ago, Christ died, and today we're
celebrating Mass here. It's a gift from God,'' said Carmen Sanchez,
24, one of 200 pilgrims from Venezuela.
</P>
<P>
   At 10:15 a.m., the papal party's first helicopters roared
overhead, and the bustling crowd fell silent. Fifteen minutes
later, the assembly burst into cheers and applause when John Paul
appeared in his Popemobile. Slowly, the vehicle made its way down a
narrow path that ran through the center of the crowd. The pope
passed Lebanese, French, Venezuelan, Japanese and U.S. flags as he
rode toward the altar.
</P>
<P>
   ``John Paul II, we love you!'' the crowd chanted.
</P>
<P>
   Throughout the Mass, clouds cast shadows on the green hills
around the Sea of Galilee, and once or twice light rain fell on the
crowd. But few of the pilgrims seemed to notice. It was here,
according to the Bible, that St. Peter lived and Jesus performed
the miracle of the loaves and fishes.
</P>
<P>
   And it was here, Christians believe, on a stunning cliff
overlooking the Sea of Galilee that Jesus gave his famous Sermon on
the Mount, telling the poor in spirit that theirs is the kingdom of
heaven, the meek that they shall inherit the earth and the
peacemakers that they shall be called children of God.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's something very beautiful about this place,'' said
Rachel Sim, a 21-year-old from England. ``It's a natural
amphitheater. You're brought up with stories. They are almost like
fairy tales. They're almost not real.
</P>
<P>
   ``But when you see this place, you feel that it's true. You feel
uplifted.''
</P>
<P>
   Stephan Galleitner of Frankfurt, Germany, agreed. ``It's very
important to me to walk on the same ground as Jesus did, to breathe
the same air,'' Galleitner said. ``He gets even more real. He's
already present, but now it's more concrete than before.''
</P>
<P>
   A chaperon who led a group of young people from Ireland was
impressed with the historical significance of Friday's Mass.
</P>
<P>
   ``For the kids, I don't think they realize how important it
is,'' said Mary Power. ``It's a spiritual trip, but it's history as
well. He's only the second pope to come here.'' The only other pope
to visit Israel was Paul VI in 1964. His stopover lasted 11 hours.
</P>
<P>
   Friday's three-hour Mass began with hymns sung in Arabic. John
Paul delivered his sermon in English. The Gospel was chanted in
Greek. And just before Communion, the pontiff uttered, ``asalam
aleikum,'' Arabic for ``peace be upon you,'' and 100,000 people
turned to each other in unison and repeated his words in dozens of
languages.
</P>
<P>
   During his sermon, John Paul exhorted the multitudes of young
people gathered before him to live by the Ten Commandments and by
the words of Jesus. He told them not to be afraid to be Christian
and to spread the news of the Gospels.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now, at the dawn of the third millennium, it is your turn to
go out into the world to preach the message,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Many people hunched over short wave radios or plugged ear pieces
into small transistors to hear the sermon in their language.
</P>
<P>
   ``His message was for us to bring the message of God to the
world,'' said Cornelia Bier a resident of Berlin.
</P>
<P>
   After the sermon ended, dozens of priests filed down the
Popemobile's path and dispersed through the crowd to minister
Communion to the faithful. An Israeli-Arab choir sang, and the
throng of people fell into silent reflection.
</P>
<P>
   Minutes later, the Mass ended, and the people moved in a wave
toward the street, where many boarded buses bound for Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's a simple man of peace,'' said Lena Alam, a Maronite
Christian and an Israeli Arab, as she left the celebration. ``He
brings us closer to God.''

<P>
   SAN JOSE, Costa Rica _ What a difference a decade makes. In the
1980s, when I last visited Central America, it was a caldron of
discontent and armed rebellion. The Sandinistas, who had taken over
from the Somoza dictatorship of the right, were hard at work
imposing their own dictatorship of the left while battling the
``Contras'' whom the CIA of the Reagan administration were arming
against them.
</P>
<P>
   In El Salvador, the ``Muchachos'' of the Farabundo Marti
National Liberation Front were challenging the US-backed government
in a bitter guerrilla war. In Guatemala an even more vicious civil
war was to claim an estimated 200,000 deaths.
</P>
<P>
   Today there are still problems,``but at least we are no longer
killing each other,'' says Costa Rica's former president and Nobel
laureate, Oscar Arias. It was Arias who got the warring parties in
El Salvador and Nicaragua together and brokered a peace leading to
elections and national reconciliation.
</P>
<P>
   I asked Arias how he could possibly have thought that he, as the
leader of such a small and powerless country, could pull off such a
deal. He said that a country that has not had a standing army for
nearly half a century had the moral authority to end the wars, and
he has been working ever since to persuade the world to reduce the
arms trade and abolish armies. So far only Panama has followed
Costa Rica's example.
</P>
<P>
   But in the '90s, Guatemala ended its civil war, and death squads
no longer ply their trade in the cities and in the countryside.
</P>
<P>
   In Nicaragua, President Arnoldo Aleman of Anastasio Somoza's old
Liberal Party has made a cynical pact with Daniel Ortega of the
opposition Sandinistas to alter the constitution and ``diminish
pluralism,'' as Christiana Chamorro, the daughter of Nicaragua's
previous president put it, so that they can run the country
together in ironic harmony.
</P>
<P>
   In El Salvador, the former guerrillas have more fully embraced
the democratic process, however, and recently emerged as the
largest party in the national assembly.
</P>
<P>
   The United States military, intelligence services, and fruit
companies no longer intervene in this region to protect their
interests _ or oppress the people, depending on your politics. But,
as the great purchaser of Central American goods, the United States
still looms large. Tourism is booming in the region. In Panama,
tourists are assured that Panamanian coins are the same size as US
coins and therefore slot machine-accessible.
</P>
<P>
   Here in Costa Rica, where political stability has made it a
favorite for foreign investors, computer parts are fast gaining on
agriculture for exports dollars _ now accounting for 38 percent _
promising a day when silicon chips will trump bananas in these
long-suffering republics between the North and South American
continents. The Cold War seems very far away and long ago.

<P>
   Used to be, if your career was in need of a little
rehabilitation, you went on Leno. He'd pitch you a few fat
whiffleballs; you'd self-deprecatingly belt them out of the park;
America loved you again.
</P>
<P>
   Judging from the first couple of episodes of the second season
of ``The Dick and Paula Celebrity Special,'' Dick and Paula's New
England-based chatfest is the new stop for the repentant celeb. No
less than the Blair Witch and Satan wind up on Dick and Paula's
couch, talking up their good works, be it participating in a 10K
walk for testicular cancer (the Blair Witch; say thank you, Tom
Green) or directing Charlton Heston in local community theater
(Satan).
</P>
<P>
   ``Dick and Paula'' comes from Tom Snyder, the guy who developed
``Dr. Katz: Professional Therapist'' and, like that series, the wit
is drier than an empty martini glass and so deadpan it makes Steven
Wright look like Carrot Top. Similarly animated in what Snyder
calls Squiggle Vision, which sort of just simulates motion, the
craftsmanship is rudimentary enough to make ``Pokemon'' look like a
Pixar product. The show takes us backstage, where Paul Revere is
forever haunting the green room (and forever getting bumped from
the show at the last minute), to the stage before the show begins,
where the warm-up comic barely rouses the studio audience; he, at
least, occasionally detects a pulse.
</P>
<P>
   For those who have acquired the taste, it's funny stuff. The
Blair Witch shows up tonight, but not to discuss her movie (a nasty
lawsuit pending). Next week, Satan shows up to mark the third
animated incarnation (following the ``South Park'' movie and ``God,
the Devil and Bob'') in which the Prince of Darkness is depicted as
a good idea man who's a little taken aback at how others have taken
his concept and run with it. Dick and Paula themselves are the
usual fatuous glad-handers, but they're not too obnoxious about it;
maybe Paula can sub for Kathie Lee when she walks. &QL;

   Flowers are a source of romantic inspiration, aesthetic
meditation, perfumed essences and food. Considering the central
role they play in human life, it is a shame that more attention
isn't given to the science of plants in general, says Peter
Bernhardt, a professor of biology at St. Louis University.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we are severely depriving young American citizens of a
very basic education in plant life,'' he said. ``They are a major
part of how this world works.''
</P>
<P>
   Bernhardt's specialty is floral biology. Right now he is looking
at similarities between flowers and their extinct ancestors, whose
fossils are found in deposits of clay, sedimentary stone and amber
from the Cretaceous Period.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want to compare the structure of fossils of flowers that are
between, say, 100 to 120 million years old, against the flowers of
live plants that still retain aspects of the anatomy and shapes of
fossil forms,'' he said. ``These include plants that give us water
lilies, the black pepper we grind onto our food, a group of vines
that are often called cup and saucer magnolias, or Schisandra, and
the star anis bushes _ Illicium _ found from Florida to
Louisiana.''
</P>
<P>
   By examining the anatomy and chemistry of these living species
and their pollinators, Bernhardt is hoping to tease out clues to
the basic mechanics of plant reproduction. Eventually floral
biologists may be able to use these living survivors, or what are
known as relic flowers, to answer more sophisticated questions
about flowering and fertility in more recently evolved groups like
pumpkins and roses.
</P>
<P>
   ``The whole point of comparing a relic like a pepper vine
against something more recent like a squash or a rose is that it
gives you an idea of how flower organs and chemicals have changed
over time,'' said Bernhardt, who is also a research associate of
the Missouri Botanical Garden in St. Louis and the Royal Botanic
Garden in Sydney, Australia.
</P>
<P>
   Although the natural breeding systems of most citrus fruit, the
commercial tomato, many cereal grains and a few other plants have
been altered, in a majority of cases the ancestral breeding system
has remained intact, so that crop, fiber and timber plants still
require cross-pollination. That is one reason farmers still don't
have dependable yields of fruit and seed, said Bernhardt.
</P>
<P>
   ``For example, cold spring temperatures mean sluggish or
inactive honey bees right at the time when peach and apple blossoms
most need their attention,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   He said that advances in technology were raising tricky issues.
Scientists are patenting new life forms, for example: ``When bees
travel between a new genetically altered crop and an old breed of
crop exchanging genes between two different crops owned by two
different people, who owns the genes in the next generation of
seeds?''
</P>
<P>
   Interest in relic flowers arose near the end of the 19th
century, when a few flower fossils had been found, he said.
Spectacular fossil finds in New Jersey as well as in Australia,
Lebanon and Eastern Europe have revolutionized the field in the
last three decades, as have new techniques that reconstruct
evolutionary histories using molecular evidence inside the cells of
living plants.
</P>
<P>
   Bernhardt is planning a trip to northern Australia to study
members of the macadamia nut family.
</P>
<P>
   ``Why the macadamia nut family?'' Bernhardt said. ``The flowers
in this family, especially those that are found in the rain forest,
show flowers that have structures that appear to be intermediate in
structure between those primitive relic flowers and more modern
roses, squashes and orchids.''
</P>
<P>
   ``People will ask the question, What's so great about the
macadamia nut family? Well they are celebrities,'' he said. ``You
see them on television quite frequently. The flowers of these
plants look so peculiar to most Americans that they are regularly
used as alien flowers on most of the `Star Trek' television
shows.''

   Why does the government need to know? That's the irritated
response from some of the households that have received the Census
2000 long form. But while it seems intrusive, the long form is a
precious government tool.
</P>
<P>
   Objections are understandable.
</P>
<P>
   ``Do you have complete plumbing facilities in this house,
apartment or mobile home . . . ?'' one question asks, indicating
that ``complete'' includes a flush toilet, hot and cold piped
water, and a tub or shower. Other questions ask about income, fuel,
and utility costs, educational level, whether children are adopted,
natural born, or step-children. It almost seems as if Census 2000
is a front, covertly gathering data for People Magazine or, worse,
the Internal Revenue Service.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every question is required by law to manage or evaluate
federal programs or is needed to meet federal case law
requirements,'' census documents explain. Confidentiality is
guaranteed.
</P>
<P>
   Five out of six households will get the short form, an
easy-to-answer request for not much more than name, race,
ethnicity, and age. Counting these forms yields a population
figure. This number, however, leaves out households that don't
return forms _ an estimated 35 percent of people in the 1990
Census. (The local estimate was worse. More than half of Boston
residents failed to return their forms.)
</P>
<P>
   To get what officials call a ``progressively more accurate
count,'' the census uses the long form as a sampling tool.
</P>
<P>
   This precision helps put public money where it's most needed.
Officials expect that $182 billion will be distributed based on
crunching census numbers _ sealing the fate of essentials such as
school funding, highway construction, housing assistance, and
hospital services.
</P>
<P>
   ``The census is in the hands of the American people,'' Census
Bureau director Kenneth Prewitt observed last week. This is indeed
raw, suspense-packed democracy in action. People may grumpily
boycott the long form, insisting it is too nosy or burdensome. It
would be better if they take up their pens for the sake of the
public good.

   The World Wide Web has become a cornucopia of free expression.
Government should impose restrictions without a trial only when the
risk of immediate harm is great. Federal Judge Edward Harrington in
Boston should reconsider his restraining order that forced the
removal of material criticizing the Cyber Patrol filtering program.
</P>
<P>
   Individuals have a right to put Cyber Patrol on their computers.
But other people have a right to criticize the selection of banned
sites, many of which are pornographic but some not, such as Planned
Parenthood. Cyber Patrol argues that two persons went beyond mere
criticism when they posted, on the Internet, code used to create
the program. The judge needs to decide whether criticism protected
by the First Amendment includes the code or whether its publication
is barred by copyright law.
</P>
<P>
   The two code breakers are from Canada and Sweden and have
already removed the program from the Web in response to the judge's
order. American sympathizers made copies of the program, and Cyber
Patrol is spreading subpoenas around the Internet to force these
mirror sites to shut down. It sent one to Declan McCullagh,
reporter for the Web magazine Wired News, who posted links to
mirror sites on Politechbot.com, his Web site. He refuses to reveal
the names of people who visited the mirrors from his site.
Compelling him to do so would be a violation of freedom of the
press.
</P>
<P>
   The American Civil Liberties Union will appear before Harrington
Monday to argue that his temporary order against the mirror sites
should not become a longer lasting injunction.
</P>
<P>
   Cyber Patrol engineers have rewritten their program so that the
broken code will not affect it. And Cyber Patrol has the ability,
through the Internet, to instruct computers with the filter to
prevent visits to sites that post the code breaker.
</P>
<P>
   The code breaker program is doing no harm, even though it is
still available on mirror sites not yet reached by subpoenas. The
judge should let people publish what they want until he holds a
trial on the copyright question. Injunctions should not be used to
stifle speech unless absolutely necessary.

JUDGE ORDERS IRAN TO COMPENSATE FORMER HOSTAGE 
</HEADLINE>
  (Eds: Also moving in ``a'' category) 
(lb) 
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ A federal judge on Friday ordered Iran to pay $341
million in damages to former hostage Terry Anderson and his family
for the pain and suffering he experienced during nearly seven years
as a hostage in Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
   Judge Thomas Penfield Jackson ordered the Ministry of
Information and Security of Iran to pay $300 million in punitive
damages to Anderson. In addition, the judge ordered the government
of Iran and its information and security ministry to pay $24.5
million to Anderson, $10 million to his wife, Madeleine Bassil, and
$6.7 million to their daughter, Sulome, 14.
</P>
<P>
   In his ruling, the judge wrote that the ``torturous conduct with
which both defendants are charged, savage and cruel by any
civilized standards, would surely merit such an award.''
</P>
<P>
   But whether Anderson and his family will actually receive
payment remains uncertain.
</P>
<P>
   Anderson said in an interview Friday that he was delighted by
the positive decision issued by Jackson. But the ``ironic part'' of
the case, he said, is that the Clinton administration has been
unwilling to support plaintiffs in their efforts to collect
millions of dollars awarded in similar cases by U.S. courts.
</P>
<P>
   Anderson filed suit a year ago in U.S. District Court here under
a 1996 law that allows legal action against countries that the U.S.
government accuses of sponsoring terrorism against American
citizens.
</P>
<P>
   The suit asserted that Anderson's kidnappers were members of
Hezbollah, or Party of God, ``a politico-paramilitary terrorist
organization'' with ties to Iran. Further, the suit alleged that
Hezbollah received money, training and direction from Iran.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is not about revenge or payback,'' Anderson said. ``The
primary purpose is to hold Iran accountable.''
</P>
<P>
   For American victims of terrorism to sue foreign countries in
courts here, the State Department must list the country as a
sponsor of terrorism. Iran has been on the list since 1984.
</P>
<P>
   Congress passed a measure in October 1998 that called for the
State Department and the Department of Treasury to assist victims
of terrorism to locate money for judgments. But the legislation
contained a waiver that permits President Clinton to decline
support in the interest of national security.
</P>
<P>
   Administration officials have voiced concern that the sanctity
of U.S. diplomatic property abroad, a right extended to all
diplomatic missions under international law, might be compromised
if private citizens here seize foreign government property under
such court decisions.
</P>
<P>
   ``Terrorism should be expensive,'' Anderson said. And with a nod
to other hostages and victims of terrorism, Anderson said, ``I am
not the only one.''
</P>
<P>
   Anderson's case follows others with similar intentions. In March
1998, a federal judge ordered Iran to pay $247.5 million to the
family of Alisa M. Flatow, of West Orange, N.J., who was studying
at a seminary in Jerusalem in 1995 when she was killed in a suicide
bus attack for which Islamic Jihad, with ties to Iran, claimed
responsibility.
</P>
<P>
   And in August 1998, a federal court ordered Iran to pay $65
million in damages for its role in the kidnapping of Joseph J.
Cicippio, Frank H. Reed and David P. Jacobsen, three Americans held
with Anderson in Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
   Thus far, they have been unable to collect on the settlements.
</P>
<P>
   Anderson, 52, a former Marine and Vietnam veteran, was among 18
Americans taken hostage in Beirut in the 1980s. He was held the
longest, spending 2,454 days in captivity before he was freed on
Dec. 4, 1991.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   ``It is never a simple task to calibrate an award of punitive
damages to the gravity of the offense,'' Jackson wrote in his
ruling. ``It is still more difficult in a case such as this, in
which the likelihood that any award will ever be paid is minimal.''
</P>
<P>
   This month, Secretary of State Madeleine Albright ended some of
the United States' economic sanctions against Iran, declaring a
commitment to take extensive steps toward ending two decades of
hostility ``if Iran indicates a desire and commitment to do so.''

AN OPENING TO IRAN

<TEXT>
<P>
   When Secretary of State Madeleine Albright proposed last week to
dismantle the ``wall of distrust'' between Tehran and Washington,
her true audience was the divided leadership in Iran. Because of
the power struggle there between reformers and hardliners, her
appeal might not be heeded for some time to come. Nothing was lost
by her initiative, however, and much may be gained.
</P>
<P>
   It is a privilege of America's present power and wealth that the
vicar of the nation's foreign policy can acknowledge past American
errors in Iran without having to worry about a loss of pride or
prestige. Thanks to the conclusion of the Cold War and a peculiar
American insouciance about the past, Albright had no difficulty
saying certain things Washington had been told Tehran needed to
hear.
</P>
<P>
   Without quite apologizing, she evoked the coup d'etat that the
CIA arranged in 1953 to overthrow the nationalist regime of
Mohammad Mossadegh and install Shah Reza Pahlavi. ``The coup was
clearly a setback for Iran's political development,'' Albright
said, ``and it is easy to see now why many Iranians continue to
resent this intervention by America.''
</P>
<P>
   Her wording was cleverly descriptive, and though it stopped well
short of an apology, the mere recital of unpleasant facts belied
the premise of Iranian hardliners who preach that the Great Satan
cannot and will not acknowledge the evil it has perpetrated against
Iran.
</P>
<P>
   To her credit, Albright went further, admitting that for a
quarter century the United States backed ``the Shah's government''
while it ``brutally repressed political dissent.'' If there is to
be a dialogue between Washington and Tehran, this is a confession
the Iranian side needed to hear. It also has the virtue of being
accurate.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, Saddam Hussein's regime had to say that Albright was
lying when she expressed regret for America's support of Iraq in
its 1980-88 war against Iran. Saddam's flacks said the United
States had backed Tehran. This mendacious commentary from Baghdad
should be a reminder of the benefits that may come from a US-Iran
dialogue, should the reformers win the Iranian power struggle.

JUDGE ORDERS IRAN TO COMPENSATE FORMER HOSTAGE 
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ A federal judge on Friday ordered Iran to pay $341
million in damages to former hostage Terry Anderson and his family
for the pain and suffering he experienced during nearly seven years
as a hostage in Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
   Judge Thomas Penfield Jackson ordered the Ministry of
Information and Security of Iran to pay $300 million in punitive
damages to Anderson. In addition, the judge ordered the government
of Iran and its information and security ministry to pay $24.5
million to Anderson, $10 million to his wife, Madeleine Bassil, and
$6.7 million to their daughter, Sulome, 14.
</P>
<P>
   In his ruling, the judge wrote that the ``torturous conduct with
which both defendants are charged, savage and cruel by any
civilized standards, would surely merit such an award.''
</P>
<P>
   But whether Anderson and his family will actually receive
payment remains uncertain.
</P>
<P>
   Anderson said in an interview Friday that he was delighted by
the positive decision issued by Jackson. But the ``ironic part'' of
the case, he said, is that the Clinton administration has been
unwilling to support plaintiffs in their efforts to collect
millions of dollars awarded in similar cases by U.S. courts.
</P>
<P>
   Anderson filed suit a year ago in U.S. District Court here under
a 1996 law that allows legal action against countries that the U.S.
government accuses of sponsoring terrorism against American
citizens.
</P>
<P>
   The suit asserted that Anderson's kidnappers were members of
Hezbollah, or Party of God, ``a politico-paramilitary terrorist
organization'' with ties to Iran. Further, the suit alleged that
Hezbollah received money, training and direction from Iran.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is not about revenge or payback,'' Anderson said. ``The
primary purpose is to hold Iran accountable.''
</P>
<P>
   For American victims of terrorism to sue foreign countries in
courts here, the State Department must list the country as a
sponsor of terrorism. Iran has been on the list since 1984.
</P>
<P>
   Congress passed a measure in October 1998 that called for the
State Department and the Department of Treasury to assist victims
of terrorism to locate money for judgments. But the legislation
contained a waiver that permits President Clinton to decline
support in the interest of national security.
</P>
<P>
   Administration officials have voiced concern that the sanctity
of U.S. diplomatic property abroad, a right extended to all
diplomatic missions under international law, might be compromised
if private citizens here seize foreign government property under
such court decisions.
</P>
<P>
   ``Terrorism should be expensive,'' Anderson said. And with a nod
to other hostages and victims of terrorism, Anderson said, ``I am
not the only one.''
</P>
<P>
   Anderson's case follows others with similar intentions. In March
1998, a federal judge ordered Iran to pay $247.5 million to the
family of Alisa M. Flatow, of West Orange, N.J., who was studying
at a seminary in Jerusalem in 1995 when she was killed in a suicide
bus attack for which Islamic Jihad, with ties to Iran, claimed
responsibility.
</P>
<P>
   And in August 1998, a federal court ordered Iran to pay $65
million in damages for its role in the kidnapping of Joseph J.
Cicippio, Frank H. Reed and David P. Jacobsen, three Americans held
with Anderson in Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
   Thus far, they have been unable to collect on the settlements.
</P>
<P>
   Anderson, 52, a former Marine and Vietnam veteran, was among 18
Americans taken hostage in Beirut in the 1980s. He was held the
longest, spending 2,454 days in captivity before he was freed on
Dec. 4, 1991.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   ``It is never a simple task to calibrate an award of punitive
damages to the gravity of the offense,'' Jackson wrote in his
ruling. ``It is still more difficult in a case such as this, in
which the likelihood that any award will ever be paid is minimal.''
</P>
<P>
   This month, Secretary of State Madeleine Albright ended some of
the United States' economic sanctions against Iran, declaring a
commitment to take extensive steps toward ending two decades of
hostility ``if Iran indicates a desire and commitment to do so.''

   PANAMA CITY _ Many of the buildings of what was until a few
weeks ago the last of the American empire lie empty. The Panama
Canal, and the five-mile zone on either side with its clipped
lawns, administration buildings, and trim bungalows, passed to the
Republic of Panama on Dec. 31. The vast complex of Fort Clayton,
once the headquarters of the US military's Southern command, the
modern hospital, and Balboa High School await a new development
incarnation the Panamanians are planning.
</P>
<P>
   Not all Panamanians are pleased that the Yankees have gone home.
Some fear that a corrupt government could rob the canal of its
assets and allow it to deteriorate. After all, they say, that is
what happened to the transcontinental railroad that parallels the
canal. It was turned over 12 years ago, and today no trains run and
the tracks are covered with grass.
</P>
<P>
   In the United States there are even more dire predictions from
alarmists who say that the Hong Kong company that will improve the
port facilities will lead to a Chinese takeover.
</P>
<P>
   This worrying about the canal's future reminds me of the fuss I
encountered in Cairo 44 years ago when Gamal Abdal Nasser seized
the Suez Canal from the British. Englishmen said that the
``Gippies'' could not possibly manage the canal on their own. They
predicted that the sands of the desert would soon fill in what was,
until the building of the Panama Canal, the greatest feat of
hydraulic engineering known to man. In fact, the Egyptians have run
the canal without interruption ever since, except for when the
British and French attacked them in a vain attempt to get the canal
back.
</P>
<P>
   The issue of who owns the Panama Canal has been settled more
amiably. In 1977 President Jimmy Carter agreed to hand it to Panama
at century's end, and the turnover has been both gradual and
successful. More than 700,000 vessels have passed through the great
locks between the Pacific and the Caribbean Sea since they opened
in 1914, and today ships sail on in stately tandem as they always
have.

 &HT;    Textile schools face shortage of students, industry changes
 &HT;    By Patti Bond
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Recruiters for area textile colleges might be
wondering whether someone keeps popping ``Norma Rae'' into the VCR
on Career Day.
</P>
<P>
   Sally Field's 1979 character as an impoverished mill worker in
North Carolina gripped the country with its bleak portrayal of
textile manufacturing. And the bad rap lingers, even though the
industry has changed dramatically in the 20 years since Field's
Oscar-winning role.
</P>
<P>
   Despite significant technological innovations, universities are
still having a hard time luring students into textile careers.
</P>
<P>
   For years, recruiters have blamed falling enrollment at textile
schools on headlines about plant closures and rising imports. News
about the loss of jobs in the labor-intensive apparel sector has
overshadowed the industry's thriving sectors, such as research and
design, said Fred Cook, chair and professor of Georgia Tech's
School of Textile and Fiber Engineering.
</P>
<P>
   ``When the word `textile' is mentioned, the first thing that
pops into a student's mind is clothing. We see that time and time
again in recruiting,'' Cook said. ``This is a huge industry that
covers the entire fiber spectrum, but that generally is not how the
public perceives us.''
</P>
<P>
   According to recruiters, there's plenty of high-paying
opportunities. The industry is still alive in the Southeast, where
textile companies have invested billions of dollars to create
highly automated plants. And that means jobs have shifted away from
low-paying mill work to more lucrative positions focusing on
engineering and production processes.
</P>
<P>
   ``We could graduate three times as many students as we do each
year and have absolutely no problem placing them,'' Cook said.
``We've got 22-year-olds with very little experience making $40,000
and up to start. It's the best supply-demand situation that I know
of in favor of the student.''
</P>
<P>
   But that message has failed to trickle down to high schools, he
said. And that's putting a dent in enrollment at schools like
Georgia Tech's textile school, which has lost nearly half its
student body.
</P>
<P>
   Georgia Tech will start the fall with 135 textile
undergraduates, down from 230 students five years ago. It remains
the country's second-largest public textile school after North
Carolina State University's College of Textiles.
</P>
<P>
   Other public textile colleges also report declining enrollment.
One factor, some say, is that students are more bewitched than ever
with the get-rich-quick lure of the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not `dot-com,' and that's part of the problem,'' said
Walter Thomas Jr., department head and professor of Southern
Polytechnic State University in Marietta, Ga. And this year's
recruitment season doesn't show much promise, Thomas said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had a recruiting dinner last week in LaGrange, which is a
big textile city, and 25 people showed up, including parents and
teachers,'' Thomas said. ``Usually, we get about 75 to 125 people
at that dinner.''
</P>
<P>
   Southern Polytechnic's small apparel and textile engineering
technology department graduates about a dozen students a year.
Total enrollment is down to 80 students from 135 three years ago,
Thomas said.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, starting salaries for textile majors in general
have gone up considerably. The average salary for a Georgia Tech
textile engineering graduate last year was $42,500, for example.
That's up from $30,400 four years ago. In the past three to four
years, starting salaries for Southern Polytechnic textile graduates
have gone up an average of $8,000, Thomas said.
</P>
<P>
   The decline in pure textile majors means companies are hiring
more graduates from other disciplines, such as chemical, electrical
and mechanical engineering, and then training them for a company's
specific needs.
</P>
<P>
   ``The need for textile (graduates) is great...but the textile
industry has become so sophisticated that we're recruiting across
all majors,'' said Richard Dillard, director of public affairs at
Spartanburg, S.C.-based Milliken &AMP; Co. Technical and liberal arts
majors alike are welcome, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Milliken, which operates about 15 plants in Georgia, represents
some of the diversity in the textile industry. Its products range
from colorants in Crayola Washable Markers to the orange spacesuits
that shuttle astronauts wear. The company also makes carpet, table
linen and apparel.
</P>
<P>
   It's the commercial textiles that go unnoticed by most students,
recruiters said. The industrial applications, including such
textile products as automotive air bags and flame-resistant
firefighter coats, offer a wide range of jobs.
</P>
<P>
   ``The textile industry is not just cotton farmers in the
South,'' said Sara Johnson, a senior majoring in textile and fiber
engineering at Georgia Tech. ``I got interested in this because
there's so much growth in industrial textiles. I knew I would never
be without a job.''
</P>
<P>
   The 21-year-old has a job lined up at Michelin Tire Corp. in
Winnsboro, S.C., where she'll be monitoring cabling equipment at a
tire cord facility.
</P>
<P>
   But there's a dwindling number of students like Johnson, forcing
most textile colleges to make significant changes to keep their
schools viable.
</P>
<P>
   North Carolina State University's College of Textiles is beefing
up its global focus. The school is teaching students how
international business is conducted, and there's more of an
emphasis on learning foreign languages.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are completely cognizant that the textile industry is
becoming more global,'' said David Buchanan, interim dean of the
textile college. ``The days that a student would come here and go
back to his hometown to work are gone.''
</P>
<P>
   Southern Polytechnic is becoming more international, too. Last
year, the school started an exchange program with Mexico and sent
nine students to study there. Next year, it's adding China to the
program.
</P>
<P>
   At Georgia Tech, some significant changes could be in the works.
</P>
<P>
   The Georgia Textile Manufacturers Association in Atlanta is
creating an endowed chair for the textile school. The position
ideally will be filled with a longtime industry executive who would
bring real-life experience into the school, said Roy Bowen III,
association president.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the school is developing a long-range plan that
addresses the declining enrollment, Georgia Tech's Cook said.
Considerations include research and recruiting strategies and
possible changes to the curriculum.
</P>
<P>
   The textile school's faculty has dropped along with enrollment.
The school presently has 12 faculty members, down from 15 five
years ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've been told we won't be allowed to add any faculty until
we get the student ratio back up,'' Cook said. ``One of our
considerations is if we can legitimately continue offering three
degrees in textiles.''
</P>
<P>
   One controversial consideration is dropping the word `textile'
from the school's name. Cook said he thinks the word conjures up
too many negative associations. Instead, he'd like to see a name
that puts the focus on fiber. ``I'm a firm believer in marketing
strategy,'' Cook said. ``If the old image doesn't work anymore you
develop a new image.''
</P>
<P>
   It won't be easy to get rid of a word that has been on the
school's sign for 103 years, admits Cook, who emphasized that the
name change is only a consideration at this point.
</P>
<P>
   The industry will likely fight such a name change. At the same
time, there's room for a better description of the wide-ranging
industry, said Thomas at Southern Polytechnic.
</P>
<P>
   ``Many of us have a concern about what the proper name is for
what we're doing,'' Thomas said. ``When you think of all the
textile applications there are _ from apparel to filtration systems
to materials for aircraft _ all of it involves taking fiber and
making a product out of it. That's really where we have to go.''

TWO BRITISH MEN ARRESTED IN INTERNET THEFT OF 26,000 CREDIT CARD
NUMBERS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Pa., Canada)  (Eds.: This story has been added to the front page of the business
section) 
(rk) 
 By JOHN MARKOFF   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   The FBI said that it had assisted British and Canadian
law-enforcement officials in the arrest of two 18-year-old British
men in connection with the theft of more than 26,000 credit card
numbers over the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   The two were arrested on Thursday by the Dyfed-Powys Police
Service in Wales and charged with violating the United Kingdom's
Computer Misuse Act of 1990.
</P>
<P>
   An FBI spokesman said the names of the suspected computer
intruders were being withheld under the terms of the British law.
</P>
<P>
   An individual claiming responsibility for obtaining and
publishing the credit card data had in recent months been in
frequent contact with U.S. and European journalists. He had claimed
the break-ins were aimed at exposing the lack of security in
commercial Web sites.
</P>
<P>
   The FBI estimated that losses connected with the intrusions
could exceed $3 million. The Philadelphia field office of the
agency assisted in the investigation, but Jim Davis, a spokesman
for the FBI, said he could not describe the agency's role because
it might jeopardize the British case against the pair. He said it
was unlikely that charges would be leveled against the pair in the
United States.
</P>
<P>
   Calling himself ``Curador,'' the young computer intruder has
spoken by telephone to reporters and claimed to be on a crusade to
eradicate computer security weaknesses in online shopping services.
As part of his vendetta against as many as nine small electronic
commerce sites earlier this year he had begun begun posting
thousands of stolen credit card numbers, addresses and expiration
dates to public Web sites.
</P>
<P>
   The theft and the distribution of the card numbers echoed
another recent extortion attempt against a Connecticut-based online
music retailer. In that incident an anonymous computer vandal stole
about 300,000 credit card numbers from CD Universe and then began
posting them on a Web site when the retailer refused an extortion
demand and went to the FBI.
</P>
<P>
   Credit card industry officials estimate that in 1999, 6 cents of
every $100 charged was fraudulent and that in the same period
credit card fraud totaled $956.2 million in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   However, a Visa official said Friday that U.S. credit card fraud
has declined dramatically in the last seven years, falling from 17
cents per hundred dollars in 1992, for the nation's largest credit
card association.
</P>
<P>
   However, computer security experts said the new incident posed
troubling challenges for Internet retailers because the young
computer vandal had written a simple program that systematically
was able to search tens of thousands of Web sites looking for a
specific vulnerability in a Microsoft Internet Web server.
</P>
<P>
   The vulnerability was identified last year by the Microsoft
Corp. and other computer security experts in the company's Internet
information server, but many computer sites have not yet patched
the flaw and are vulnerable to the attack.
</P>
<P>
   There has long been a bitter debate within the computer security
world over the wisdom of openly publishing information on computer
security vulnerabilities. Many computer security specialists argue
that the free publication of vulnerability information encourages
attacks.
</P>
<P>
   But others respond that open publication of such flaws is the
only way to motivate slow-to-move system administrators to plug
holes that can be easily exploited by intruders.
</P>
<P>
   In the new case, a person who stated in a telephone interview in
February that he is an 18-year-old British computer hacker,
repeatedly posted the stolen numbers anonymously to different Web
sites. At the beginning of February the individual, who identified
himself as Curador had posted the numbers at least three times on
different Web sites. But the Web hosting services, including
Geocities and Tripod, took the information off of the sites.
</P>
<P>
   Among the sites Curador claimed to have stolen credit cards from
were: www.shoppingthailand.com; www.promobility.net;
www.ltamedia.com; www3.ntd.co.uk; www.visioncomputers.com;
www.ascp.org; www.salesgate.com; and www.feelgoodfalls.com.
</P>
<P>
   When notified that the credit cards numbers were posted on the
Web Hosting Services last month several of the service providers
said they had contacted law-enforcement agencies.
</P>
<P>
   In a telephone conversation with a reporter last month, the
British teen-ager Curador predicted his arrest. ``There will be a
knock on the door and I will be arrested,'' he said. However he
claimed to be untroubled by the possibility: ``A couple of days
later I'll escape.''
</P>
<P>
   He also asserted in the interview that he had illegally ordered
the prescription drug Viagra and mailed it to the office of William
Gates, the Microsoft chairman. The claim could not be confirmed.
</P>
<P>
   He said he believed that unless he continued to demonstrate the
vulnerability of many Web sites, computer security would not be
improved.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm hoping I can have an impact,'' he said. ``I realize it
won't happen overnight. But at least they will begin to password
protect their sites, that wouldn't be too much to ask.''

CONFERENCE ON BIOTECH PERILS TO COINCIDE WITH INDUSTRY MEETING 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RAPHAEL LEWIS  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ Hundreds of academics, activists, and consumers arrived
at Northeastern University on Friday for a three-day conference on
the potential perils of biotechnology, one day before industry
leaders arrive in Boston for their own convention.
</P>
<P>
   Called Biodevastation 2000, the conference was billed as the
largest gathering of its kind in the United States and activists
say it signals that the movement against biotechnology is catching
fire in America, well after Europe, where genetically altered foods
have met with widespread protest.
</P>
<P>
   ``The public debate in this country is lacking, and science is
running away like mad without anyone really understanding the
ramifications,'' said Dr. Ricarda Steinbrecher, a British
researcher who quit her job to speak out against biotechnology.
``I'm quite amazed the people here don't even know what's in their
food.''
</P>
<P>
   The fourth conference of its kind, Biodevastation was timed to
coincide with BIO2000, the annual trade meeting of biotechnology
professionals Sunday through Thursday in Boston.
</P>
<P>
   While between 7,000 and 8,000 delegates are expected to show up
for BIO2000, about 500 people attended panel discussions and
lectures at Biodevastation Friday, organizers said. They estimate
that perhaps 1,000 will attend a rally Sunday that begins in Copley
Square and will end near the Hynes Convention Center, site of the
conference.
</P>
<P>
   Organizers of the counter-conference, which includes experts on
science, agriculture, labor rights as well as journalists, hope to
steal the spotlight trained on BIO2000.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, 1,600 biotech companies _ many based in the Boston
area, which some call ``Genetown'' _ generated $18.6 billion in
revenues, according to the Biotechnology Industry Organization,
which is sponsoring BIO2000.
</P>
<P>
   Alarmed by the industry's rapid growth, opponents hope to call
attention to what they say is the industry's untested, and
environmentally harmful and immoral research. They are calling for
a ban on genetically altered foods, stronger oversight of the
industry, strict labeling laws of genetically modified foods and
for the government to stop issuing patents for seeds, plants,
animals, organs, and genes.
</P>
<P>
   Friday's opening of Biodevastation was civil and academic, but
city and police leaders have expressed concerns that violence will
erupt in the streets when Biodevastation 2000 moves to Copley
Square for a rally. Police leaders have spent weeks training
officers, who have been told to come to work prepared to don riot
gear.
</P>
<P>
   Some of their fears stem from the fact that several
Biodevastation participants, including several of its organizers,
took part in the massive protests at the World Trade Organization's
meeting in Seattle in November, police said. Those protests, which
succeeded in shutting down the WTO summit, ended with garbage cans,
rubber bullets and tear gas flying through the streets. All told,
$30 million in property damage resulted, as well as the resignation
of Seattle's police chief.
</P>
<P>
   But if images of violence grabbed the nation's attention, it was
the surprisingly large, diverse group of protesters in Seattle that
helped galvanize many who arrived in Boston Friday.
</P>
<P>
   ``What happened in Seattle was really amazing. I don't know if
it will last, but we're trying,'' said Simon Harris, who came to
Biodevastation from San Francisco.
</P>
<P>
   Violence would merely impede the movement, organizers said
Friday. One of the main goals is to recreate the image of their
opposition campaign from one based on violence to one based on
science.
</P>
<P>
   ``We want to protest the biotech industry with a two-pronged
attack, first by defeating them with sound science, then by showing
that many of us in America care,'' said Heather Albert-Knopp, 23,
who is from Vermont and is one of Biodevastion's organizers. ``We
don't feel that shutting down BIO2000 is the best tactic. Our goal
now is to show we are a legitimate group of people with concerns
that are not only legitimate, but fundamental to the welfare of
ordinary Americans.''

TWO BRITISH MEN ARRESTED IN INTERNET THEFT OF 26,000 CREDIT CARD
NUMBERS 
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   The FBI said that it had assisted British and Canadian
law-enforcement officials in the arrest of two 18-year-old British
men in connection with the theft of more than 26,000 credit card
numbers over the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   The two were arrested on Thursday by the Dyfed-Powys Police
Service in Wales and charged with violating the United Kingdom's
Computer Misuse Act of 1990.
</P>
<P>
   An FBI spokesman said the names of the suspected computer
intruders were being withheld under the terms of the British law.
</P>
<P>
   An individual claiming responsibility for obtaining and
publishing the credit card data had in recent months been in
frequent contact with U.S. and European journalists. He had claimed
the break-ins were aimed at exposing the lack of security in
commercial Web sites.
</P>
<P>
   The FBI estimated that losses connected with the intrusions
could exceed $3 million. The Philadelphia field office of the
agency assisted in the investigation, but Jim Davis, a spokesman
for the FBI, said he could not describe the agency's role because
it might jeopardize the British case against the pair. He said it
was unlikely that charges would be leveled against the pair in the
United States.
</P>
<P>
   Calling himself ``Curador,'' the young computer intruder has
spoken by telephone to reporters and claimed to be on a crusade to
eradicate computer security weaknesses in online shopping services.
As part of his vendetta against as many as nine small electronic
commerce sites earlier this year he had begun begun posting
thousands of stolen credit card numbers, addresses and expiration
dates to public Web sites.
</P>
<P>
   The theft and the distribution of the card numbers echoed
another recent extortion attempt against a Connecticut-based online
music retailer. In that incident an anonymous computer vandal stole
about 300,000 credit card numbers from CD Universe and then began
posting them on a Web site when the retailer refused an extortion
demand and went to the FBI.
</P>
<P>
   Credit card industry officials estimate that in 1999, 6 cents of
every $100 charged was fraudulent and that in the same period
credit card fraud totaled $956.2 million in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   A Visa official said Friday that U.S. credit card fraud has
declined dramatically in the last seven years, falling from 17
cents per hundred dollars in 1992, for the nation's largest credit
card association.
</P>
<P>
   However, computer security experts said the new incident posed
troubling challenges for Internet retailers because the young
computer vandal had written a simple program that systematically
was able to search tens of thousands of Web sites looking for a
specific vulnerability in a Microsoft Internet Web server.
</P>
<P>
   The vulnerability was identified last year by Microsoft Corp.
and other computer security experts in the company's Internet
information server, but many computer sites have not yet patched
the flaw and are vulnerable to the attack.
</P>
<P>
   There has long been a bitter debate within the computer security
world over the wisdom of openly publishing information on computer
security vulnerabilities. Many computer security specialists argue
that the free publication of vulnerability information encourages
attacks.
</P>
<P>
   But others respond that open publication of such flaws is the
only way to motivate slow-to-move system administrators to plug
holes that can be easily exploited by intruders.
</P>
<P>
   In the new case, a person who stated in a telephone interview in
February that he is an 18-year-old British computer hacker,
repeatedly posted the stolen numbers anonymously to different Web
sites. At the beginning of February the individual, who identified
himself as Curador had posted the numbers at least three times on
different Web sites. But the Web hosting services, including
Geocities and Tripod, took the information off of the sites.
</P>
<P>
   Among the sites Curador claimed to have stolen credit cards from
were: www.shoppingthailand.com; www.promobility.net;
www.ltamedia.com; www3.ntd.co.uk; www.visioncomputers.com;
www.ascp.org; www.salesgate.com; and www.feelgoodfalls.com.
</P>
<P>
   When notified that the credit cards numbers were posted on the
Web Hosting Services last month several of the service providers
said they had contacted law-enforcement agencies.
</P>
<P>
   In a telephone conversation with a reporter last month, the
British teen-ager Curador predicted his arrest. ``There will be a
knock on the door and I will be arrested,'' he said. However he
claimed to be untroubled by the possibility: ``A couple of days
later I'll escape.''
</P>
<P>
   He also asserted in the interview that he had illegally ordered
the prescription drug Viagra and mailed it to the office of William
Gates, the Microsoft chairman. The claim could not be confirmed.
</P>
<P>
   He said he believed that unless he continued to demonstrate the
vulnerability of many Web sites, computer security would not be
improved.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm hoping I can have an impact,'' he said. ``I realize it
won't happen overnight. But at least they will begin to password
protect their sites, that wouldn't be too much to ask.''

<P>
   Two hundred years ago Englishmen used to rave about the
beautiful complexions of milk maids who seemed immune from the
dread scourge of smallpox, which disfigured the people it did not
kill. It was Edward Jenner who figured out that milk maids were
exposed to cowpox, a lesser disease, and that cowpox immunized them
from smallpox. He developed a cowpox vaccine that has been so
successful that today the only smallpox bacilli left on earth are
isolated in laboratories in the United States and Russia.
</P>
<P>
   Many people thought, however, that vaccinations were against
nature and dangerous. Illustrated predictions of milk maids with
cows growing out of their bodies appeared in the press.
</P>
<P>
   Today a similar wave of fearful but equally unscientific protest
is rising over the genetic altering of crops. Many Europeans have
said they will not accept genetically altered food.
</P>
<P>
   The focus has moved to Boston this weekend with the BIO 2000
International Meeting and Exhibition, which opens here Sunday _ a
showcase for the nascent industry. Biotechnology is so new that, as
Henri Termeer, CEO of Genzyme, put it: If it were the Boston
Marathon we would be just lacing up our sneakers.
</P>
<P>
   And this is what many critics have against it. They say the
industry is moving too fast, is too commercially driven, that we do
not know the end results of genetic engineering. They say that the
brakes ought to be applied with heavy regulation, and some would
put a stop to the entire enterprise. Protesters compare themselves
to Rachel Carson, whose landmark book, ``Silent Spring,'' blew the
whistle on DDT-based pesticides and probably saved many species
from extinction.
</P>
<P>
   But unlike Carson, the biologically altered food opponents have
little evidence to back up their fears. The idea of mixing fish
genes with tomato genes may make the stomach queasy, but a gene is
a gene _ neither a fish nor a tomato _ and all human beings share
genes with animals and plants. The image of fish heads growing out
of tomatoes misunderstands the process as much as cows growing out
of a milk maid did in the 18th century.
</P>
<P>
   The protesters also seem not to appreciate the careful testing
to which genetically altered crops are subjected by the
Environmental Protection Agency, the Food and Drug Administration,
and the Department of Agriculture.
</P>
<P>
   Mankind has been altering crops since people learned to breed
wild grasses into edible food. And animal husbandry has altered the
wild beasts into the farm animals we see today.
</P>
<P>
   Yes, we need to proceed carefully with proper regulation, and
yes, bio-engineering is different from the cross-breeding of the
past. And although the danger to Monarch butterflies, for example,
has been exaggerated, the industry needs to guard against
unintended consequences.
</P>
<P>
   But to stop the genetic altering of food that can make crops
insect-resistant, for example, or stronger and more able to
survive, would be to deprive mankind of a benefit that may become
necessary to save the world in the centuries to come when
populations increase. Much of the protest in Boston this weekend is
based on the same kind of ignorance that tried to end Edward
Jenner's immunizations two centuries ago.

POEM ON THE RANGE: COWBOY LAUREATES 
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   Ever since books of cowboy poetry began to appear in the 1890s,
the lyrical verses have evoked a sense of lost romance and a
disappearing way of life.
</P>
<P>
   Cowboy poetry's roots date from the end of Civil War, writes
Dave Stanley, a teacher of folklore history at Westminster College
in Salt Lake City, in a new anthology, ``Cowboy Poets and Cowboy
Poetry'' (University of Illinois Press), edited by Stanley and
Elaine Thatcher. Grazers and herders began arriving in the open
grasslands of the West with cattle from Texas and Mexico after
native populations had been driven from the area. Poems were
traditionally recited around the campfire during great cattle trail
drives or roundups, in bunkhouses and line camps, and in bars and
saloons.
</P>
<P>
   The folk historian Alan Lomax says that as trail drives moved
herds from Texas northward ``a variety of poem and song traditions
were recalled, modified, reinvented, and regionalized.'' He
particularly cites ``the verbal art of sailors and soldiers,
largely English and Irish in origin, which combined with the songs
and hollers of black cowboys and the corrido, or Mexican folk
ballad, tradition of the vaqueros.''
</P>
<P>
   A cowboy's work was taken seriously and often treated with
sentimentality, writes James S. Griffith, formerly the coordinator
of the Southwest Folklore Center of the University of Arizona. D.J.
O'Malley's poem ``A Cowboy's Death'' describes a cowboy's fatal
accident:
</P>
<P>
   'Twas a sad death for man to meet
</P>
<P>
   Out on that lonely lea;
</P>
<P>
   His relatives in Texas live,
</P>
<P>
   No more his face they'll see;
</P>
<P>
   But we hope the Father greets him
</P>
<P>
   With a smile upon his face,
</P>
<P>
   And seats him by his right hand
</P>
<P>
   Near the shining throne of grace.
</P>
<P>
   But anything short of death could be considered a subject for
humor, says Griffith. Consider O'Malley's ``D-2 Horse Wrangler,''
about a tenderfoot narrator who after a bucking accident asks for
special treatment:
</P>
<P>
   They picked me up and carried me in.
</P>
<P>
   And rubbed me down with a rolling pin.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now that's the way they all begin.
</P>
<P>
   You are doing well,'' says Brown.
</P>
<P>
   ``And tomorrow morning if you don't die,
</P>
<P>
   I'll give you another horse to try.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Oh won't you let me walk?'' says I.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yes' says he, ``Into town.''
</P>
<P>
   Cowboy poetry is essentially oral. Reciting it aloud seems to
work in two ways, Stanley says. Many of the poems need personal
interpretation to save them from being tedious. And since much of
the subject matter of cowboy poetry _ riding horses, rounding up
cattle, breaking broncs and drinking in saloons _ occurred in
settings inhospitable to written texts, recitation was the way to
share experiences. ``It's as if all these poems had been composed
on horseback and later, grudgingly, committed to paper and ink,''
he writes.
</P>
<P>
   ``At the formal center of cowboy poetry is the ballad,'' the
medieval form used in many of the oldest folk songs in English,
Stanley writes. ``The ballad _ which contrasts the symmetrical and
the asymmetrical, the even and the odd, voice and silence _ creates
a nice kind of tension that drives the language, as in ``The Glory
Trail'' by Charles Badger Clark. (The poem is sometimes called
``High-Chin Bob,'' after the proud cowboy in the verse who ropes a
mountain lion and is doomed to have it follow him forever.)
</P>
<P>
   'Way high up the Mogollons,
</P>
<P>
   Among the mountain tops,
</P>
<P>
   A lion cleaned a yearlin's bones
</P>
<P>
   And licked his thankful chops,
</P>
<P>
   When on the picture who should ride,
</P>
<P>
   A-trippin' down a slope,
</P>
<P>
   But High-Chin Bob, with sinful pride
</P>
<P>
   And mav'rick-hungry rope.
</P>
<P>
   Hal Cannon, founding director of the Western Folklife Center in
Elko, Nev., says that while cowboy poetry is sometimes humorous,
``it is often born of loss, remembrance and grief.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Because there was no home to return to,'' he said, ``even
early cowboy poetry from the 1800s is a song of exile from the
American promise of the West,'' like the 1860s poem ``The
Blizzard,'' by Eugene Ware:
</P>
<P>
   A requiem in a lonesome land,
</P>
<P>
   In a mournful minor key:
</P>
<P>
   ``No matter how long the river,
</P>
<P>
   The river will reach the Sea!''

   It's not easy being an industry apostate. The tobacco giants
reacted furiously when the Liggett company turned state's evidence
in 1997, admitting for the first time that nicotine is addictive
and that tobacco companies had been marketing to youngsters. Now
Smith &AMP; Wesson, one of the most venerable names in firearms
manufacturing, has enraged others in the industry by agreeing to
important safety measures for the manufacture and sale of its
handguns.
</P>
<P>
   The adoption by Smith &AMP; Wesson of principles for the responsible
manufacture and sale of guns should be seen as a model, not a
betrayal, by other firearms companies. It is past time for
manufacturers of the only unregulated consumer product in the
nation to take voluntary steps to ensure that their product is as
safe as possible.
</P>
<P>
   The Springfield, Mass., company said last week that all its
handguns would be shipped with safety locks beginning immediately
to reduce accidental shootings. All new issues would include a
second, hidden serial number to make guns easier to trace. Most
significant, the company pledged within three years to develop
handguns equipped with so-called smart-gun technology _ allowing
the guns to be fired only by their owners. Boston announced
Wednesday that the city would give preferential treatment to
companies working on smart-gun technology in awarding police
contracts; a significant number of officers killed in the line of
duty are shot with their own weapons.
</P>
<P>
   Smith &AMP; Wesson also said that it will require its authorized
dealers to follow uniform guidelines in distributing its guns: not
to sell at gun shows unless buyers have been properly screened, not
to deal in high-capacity magazines or assult weapons, to require
those placing multiple orders to wait 14 days after the first gun
is released to pick up the others.
</P>
<P>
   The federal Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, and Firearms estimates
that of the 100,000-plus licensed gun dealers in America, just 349
of them account for 50 percent of the guns eventually used in
crimes. The vast majority of legitimate gun dealers should have no
problem complying with the Smith &AMP; Wesson principles.
</P>
<P>
   That Smith &AMP; Wesson agreed to these changes under threat of a
lawsuit does not diminish their importance. These are reasonable
steps by a responsible company that wants to become part of the
solution to gun violence. Unless they adopt similar standards,
other manufacturers will continue to be part of the problem.

`HOLLYWOOD' HENDERSON _ SUPER BOWL STAR, PHILANTHROPIST, LOTTO
WINNER
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service Clients) 
By THOMAS TERRY 
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ It was with little of his trademark flair that
Thomas ``Hollywood'' Henderson celebrated his $28 million Lotto
jackpot.
</P>
<P>
   The former star Dallas Cowboys linebacker strolled into a
7-Eleven, ordered a sausage-and-egg biscuit, washed it down with a
pint of milk, then munched some of those little white doughnuts for
dessert.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now in the early '70s that would be cocaine and champagne,'' a
chuckling Henderson, 47, wearing gym shorts and a diamond Rolex
watch, said outside his upscale Austin condominium on Friday.
</P>
<P>
   His heady, drug-flowing days are apparently long gone, and his
recent years have centered on inner-city good works. But flashes of
the high-rolling times came back with a roar for Henderson when he
bought a fistful of lottery tickets at Nau's Drug in Austin.
</P>
<P>
   One carried the winning number to a $28 million jackpot.
</P>
<P>
   ``It blows your mind,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I got drafted by the Dallas Cowboys in 1975. I won the Super
Bowl in 1977. The only thing bigger than winning this lottery was
16 years ago (when) I changed my life and became a clean and sober
man. I am probably the most prepared person to win $28 million that
I know of.''
</P>
<P>
   Lottery officials said the former Cowboy has not yet claimed his
prize but had passed a preliminary validation test.
</P>
<P>
   ``We think he's coming in next week,'' said Lottery Commission
spokeswoman Leticia Vasquez. ``He hasn't given us a date, but he
did tell us he hasn't slept very much. People have been calling him
at his house all night long.''
</P>
<P>
   She said Henderson produced a unique validation number from the
winning ticket.
</P>
<P>
   Henderson estimates that he has spent about $20,000 on Lotto
tickets over the past decade. On Wednesday, he bought $100 worth.
</P>
<P>
   ``I always knew that I was going to win,'' he said. ``I (just)
didn't know when I was going to win. I only played when it was
$20-30 million _ spend one or two hundred dollars at two or three
different stores.''
</P>
<P>
   Henderson was on the golf course when his former wife called on
his cellular phone. She had heard that Nau's, a popular Austin
pharmacy where she knew he bought tickets, had produced a winner.
</P>
<P>
   ``My ex-wife had the numbers,'' Henderson said. ``She tortured
me by saying, `Do you have any tickets with a five on it?'
</P>
<P>
   ``I said, `Yeah, what are the numbers?' And she said, `I'm not
telling you. Look at the tickets and tell me each one that has a
five on it.'
</P>
<P>
   ``I went through about five tickets starting with fives, then I
got to the ticket where I went through six numbers, and she goes,
`Oh my God!' ''
</P>
<P>
   His winning numbers were 5, 8, 17, 35, 38 and 41.
</P>
<P>
   Henderson has not always been so lucky.
</P>
<P>
   He was a linebacker for Dallas from 1975 until the Cowboys cut
him in 1979 because of drug problems.
</P>
<P>
   In 1983, he was arrested in California for smoking crack with
two teen-aged girls. According to police, he sexually assaulted one
of the girls, threatened both with a gun and held them against
their will. He served two years and four months in prison.
</P>
<P>
   Henderson credits the example set by Cowboys coach Tom Landry in
helping him turn his life around.
</P>
<P>
   ``I did not listen to Tom Landry, but I heard him,'' Henderson
said. ``I wish Tom Landry was here to see this, because he would
say to me: `Let's see how you handle this, Thomas.' ''
</P>
<P>
   ``I give him the credit ... Landry taught me quality control.
Through my recovery from drugs and alcohol ... I have his voice,
his message, what he stood for, loud in my head today, (in) my
philanthropy.''
</P>
<P>
   Henderson has been involved in various Austin charities and said
his lottery winnings will allow him to give more. Two years ago, he
went on a week-long hunger strike in a drive to raise money for a
running track in impoverished east Austin, where he grew up.
</P>
<P>
   With his profile raised by charitable endeavors, Henderson
decided he wanted to do more for the community and announced that
he would run for a spot on the Austin City Council.
</P>
<P>
   But he soon discovered that he was ineligible because of his
prior felony conviction.
</P>
<P>
   According to Lotto officials, the winner selected the immediate
cash option, meaning the $28 million jackpot is worth a little more
than $14 million before taxes. Henderson said he is exploring ways
to limit his tax liability on the jackpot.
</P>
<P>
   Either way, he's not in a big rush to spend the money.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm going to take everything under advisement,'' he said.
``I'm not in any hurry. I've got plenty of money already. ... I'm
just going to continue to do the charities that I do, take care of
my children and buy my momma a Town Car.''
</P>
<P>
   Henderson is the most famous Texan to hit a jackpot, according
to Vasquez, the Lotto spokeswoman.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's really come full circle,'' a former Cowboys teammate,
receiver Drew Pearson, told The Associated Press. ``He had it all
when he was playing for the Cowboys; that's when he became
Hollywood. Then he got into trouble and got mixed up with the drugs
and lost it all. He hit rock bottom.''

MAN KILLED IN HOTEL RESTAURANT IN MEXICO IS TWICE MISIDENTIFIED 
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   MEXICO CITY _ Authorities acknowledged Friday that they twice
misidentified a man killed in a shooting Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   For several hours after the shooting in a hotel restaurant here,
law enforcement authorities identified the man in written
statements as Cuauhtemoc Herrera Suastegui, who was a senior aide
to Mexico's attorney general. He resigned in January after becoming
the target of a drug investigation.
</P>
<P>
   Mariano Herran Salvatti, Mexico's top drug prosecutor, discussed
Herrera's supposed demise on a late-night television newscast, only
to realize he was in error, when forensic doctors sent him a photo
of the corpse from the morgue.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know Herrera because I've worked with him, and that wasn't
him,'' Herran Salvatti said in an interview Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Herrera was shot in the back but survived. His defense lawyer
and a woman who had been with him were also shot; they also
survived.
</P>
<P>
   Herran Salvatti said that Mexico City detectives first erred
when they found a document identifying the victim as Army Capt.
Cuauhtemoc Najera, and announced the victim as Cuauhtemoc Herrera.
</P>
<P>
   Correcting that mistake, they then identified the corpse as
Cuauhtemoc Najera. But that was also incorrect. Just before
midnight, authorities finally identified the shooting victim as
Sergio Jorge Chavez, Herrera's driver.
</P>
<P>
   Samuel Del Villar, the Mexico City district attorney, said
Friday that five men had been detained but that police were still
seeking another man whom Herrera and a Canadian tourist have
described as the gunman who burst into the Imperial Hotel, firing
at Herrera and his lawyer.
</P>
<P>
   The attack on Herrera attracted special attention because
William E. Ledwith, a senior Drug Enforcement Administration
official, pointed to him as an example of corruption in Mexican
anti-drug units during a Feb. 29 congressional hearing in
Washington.
</P>
<P>
   Herrera, while serving as the No. 2 official in an elite federal
narcotics investigations unit that worked for Mexico's attorney
general, failed a lie detector test administered by U.S. officials
in September 1998, and other evidence emerged to suggest that
Herrera was collaborating with traffickers, Ledwith said.
</P>
<P>
   Despite those warning signs, Herrera was not dismissed from the
attorney general's staff. Instead he was transferred to a
diplomatic post in Spain, authorities said.
</P>
<P>
   Herran Salvatti said Friday that after authorities discovered
Herrera's name on documents confiscated from drug traffickers in
Cancun, Herrera became the target of a drug investigation in
mid-1999, about the time he returned to Mexico from Spain. But
although he was, officially at least, the target of a criminal
investigation, Herrera continued to hold a job on the attorney
general's staff, although in a lowly post.
</P>
<P>
   He resigned voluntarily on Jan. 14. He had been scheduled to
meet with an aide to Herran Salvatti Friday, to respond to
prosecutors' questions, Herran Salvatti said.
</P>
<P>
   From his hospital bed Friday, Herrera told detectives that he
asked for the meeting with prosecutors in order to ask for their
help in clearing his name.

HOPING PUTIN IS NO RASPUTIN 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (For release Sunday, March 26)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DAVID NYHAN  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Bulletin: This just in! We know who'll win Sunday in Russia's
election. The victor's name is Putin. We just hope his nickname
won't be ``Ras.''
</P>
<P>
   A KGB apparatchik from the age of 22, a wily bureaucrat with an
instinct for survival and a reputation for being sinister when
necessary, Vladimir Putin threaded his way up from being deputy
mayor of St. Petersburg to becoming blustery Boris Yeltsin's
handpicked successor as president of the staggering giant that is
Russia.
</P>
<P>
   There are a dozen names on the ballot, but Putin's huge lead,
his aggressive prosecution of the ruthless but popular war in
Chechnya, and his mastery of political propagandizing through
control of the most important television network, means the only
doubt Sunday is whether he captures 50 percent of the vote and
avoids the need for a runoff next month.
</P>
<P>
   Will he turn out to be a Rasputin of a leader, like the obscure
conspiratorial mystic who wielded mysterious influence over the
last of the czars? Throughout what passes for a political campaign
in the seething caldron that is Russian society today, Putin has
debated no rival, granted few and carefully-choreographed media
interviews, and hidden behind a Western-style media campaign made
easier by the tolerance of corruption and favoritism that underlies
much of Russian commerce and journalism.
</P>
<P>
   ``After the election, he will take off this mask for sure,''
said Harvard's Russian-watcher, Graham Allison. ``He has been a
very accomplished candidate,'' said Allison, director of the Belfer
Center for Science and International Affairs, who flew back from
Moscow last Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Allison says that in the same way Ronald Reagan used his
lifelong acting skills to maximize his political clout, so has
Putin used the techniques he learned as a KGB operative to
frustrate his political opponents.
</P>
<P>
   ``He has been a very accomplished candidate'' for high office in
the Western mold, said Allison, because he is adept at the tactics
of the spy: ``deception, disinformation, seduction of agents, using
cover _ all of those skills have quite interesting applications in
politics.''
</P>
<P>
   Putin is a thoroughly modern man when it comes to market
economics. He's made all the right noises about dragging his
still-feudal countrymen into the modern era. In an obvious overture
to Western investors, he promised The New York Times and ABC-TV
he'll bring in with him an array of KGB types to root out the
corruption for which present-day Russia is notorious.
</P>
<P>
   Putin will know where to look, and whom to look for, in the eyes
of many Westerners. ``Putin's early days as deputy mayor of St.
Petersburg seem to have been spent doing precisely what he says he
will eradicate,'' the Globe's Moscow correspondent, David Filipov,
reported Friday with correspondent Brian Whitmore. ``Documents . .
. appear to reveal a bureaucrat who was less interested in
enforcing the law than mining profits from the loopholes.''
</P>
<P>
   To these jaded eyes, which try to be ever skeptical but never
cynical, the West's hope should be that since it may take one to
catch one, we should pray that Putin has already amassed enough
personal wealth to ensure his family's prosperity into the third
generation, and that he instead seizes an opportunity to be the
savior of a cultured but corrupt country.
</P>
<P>
   Americans have no right to swoon over the installation of a
spook to high public office. George Bush ran the CIA before
becoming president. Reagan put an old spy-chaser named Bill Casey
in as his campaign manager in 1980 _ then gave Casey the CIA top
spot. Spying and politicking are no strangers in this country,
either. And as a 70-ish Russian emigre woman said to me recently of
the Kremlin crowd, ``They were all KGB,'' one way or another.
</P>
<P>
   Little was known of Putin, a low-level lieutenant colonel in the
KGB, till he rose skillfully through the shifting ice floes of the
collapse of Sovietism. Clearly, he is Yeltsin's guy. Just as
clearly, he is the favored choice of the oligarchs, the shadowy
bruisers who control Russian television, journalism, oil and
mineral extraction, and pull the strings over what amounts to a
puppet government, so corrupt that even the cop on the beat is on
the take.
</P>
<P>
   When you have the TV barons who count in your pocket, you can
rubbish any opponent, disembowel any political rival. Russian TV is
apparently rife with sexy expose journalism, some of it even true.
They still show video of the former top state prosecutor frolicking
in the sack with three prostitutes, whether true or not, whether
set up or not, still a boffo show for the late-night viewers who
just ran out of vodka.
</P>
<P>
   Putin's strongest rivals were gut-shot by the journalism
apparatus under the thumb of Mission Control. Allegations of
corruption do not have to be proved to be effective in the Wild
West ways of Moscow television. Smearing an opponent seems to be
the path to power. Lee Atwater would have fit right in.
</P>
<P>
   ``The campaign showed us a Putin who is super agile, cynical,
effective, energetic,'' said Allison. ``So I would say his
transformation into a model modern candidate is very striking.
Everybody has been amazed that his team could have done this.
Everybody's stunned.'' What happens after he's elected?
</P>
<P>
   ``If we look at what he says and does, he seems very realistic.
He says very harsh things about the current conditions in the
country. He's very pragmatic, without any evidence of ideology and
principle.'' So that's a start.
</P>
<P>
   ``He thinks they need to recover economically, which will take a
generation.'' That's the real start. This is a country where, in
the words of the Globe's Stan Grossfeld five years ago, ``every
third person you meet is an engineer _ and nothing works.'' Putin
seems to answer the Russian craving for a tyrant, a strong man, a
butt-kicker who'll make the railroad run on time, or else the train
guys will all be sent to Siberia.
</P>
<P>
   Allison said the typical Russian believes his country's life is
too chaotic, too disorganized. The bombing of Moscow apartment
buildings, supposedly by terrorists, scared the populace. The
feeling is, we need a strong hand now.
</P>
<P>
   To Allison, Putin may improve things. ``This guy wants Russia to
be integrated into the global economy. He is without any illusions
about there being some kind of `third Russian way.' Number one on
his agenda is economic reconstruction. I suspect they'll be open
for international investment.''

FOR PUTIN AND MARKETS, THE HARD PART STARTS  
 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, MARCH 26) 
</HEADLINE>

NYT graphic clients. Non-subscribers can make individual purchase
by calling (888) 603-1036 or (888) 346-9867.) 
(af) 
 By JONATHAN FUERBRINGER   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   MOSCOW _ Boris Fedorov, the former Russian finance minister and
one-time head of the state tax service, knows an expatriate Russian
couple who put a large chunk of their money into Russian stocks in
December. Since then, they have doubled their stake and bought a
house.
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately for Americans, who have probably been avoiding
volatile Russian stocks, the couple's good fortune means that much
of the easy money has been made.
</P>
<P>
   The market rally has come as the Russian economy is rebounding
from its plunge during the financial crisis of August 1998, when
the ruble was devalued and the government defaulted on its foreign
debt. The Russian economy grew 3 percent last year _ a pace that is
expected to continue, if not accelerate, this year.
</P>
<P>
   The turnaround was spurred by a tripling of oil prices, which
also bolstered government revenue, and the ruble's devaluation,
which made domestic companies more competitive.
</P>
<P>
   Investor interest is also perking up. For example, cash flow
into the $68.6 million Lexington Troika fund, which invests in
Russia, was a heavy $9.1 million for the first two months of the
year, according to Lipper estimates. The Morgan Stanley Dean Witter
office here, headed by Rair R. Simonyan, a Russian investment
banker, will be host for a conference for foreign investors in
mid-May.
</P>
<P>
   And last week, the head of the Russian Federal Property Fund,
which controls the remaining government stakes in Russian
companies, met with potential investors in London and New York.
</P>
<P>
   This year's rally, however, may have more to do with the New
Year's Eve resignation of the unpredictable Boris N. Yeltsin as
president. The Russian Trading System Cash index jumped 17 percent
in the wake of the announcement and is now up 39 percent for the
year. The stability that people see coming with the expected
election Sunday of the acting president, Vladimir V. Putin, has
also helped.
</P>
<P>
   Some analysts here say the stock-market rally was powered by
local investors just waiting to sell when foreigners piled back in.
In any event, much of the good news is already in the market.
</P>
<P>
   Once the election ballots are counted, a new uncertainty may
emerge: Will Putin be a reformer, and, if so, can he make the
changes he wants? The needed tax, regulatory and legal reforms are
daunting. There is corruption to deal with, and the rich and
powerful oligarchs. Putin has been difficult to gauge; no one can
say what he will do about these issues.
</P>
<P>
   Alexander Kim, Morgan Stanley's strategist for Russia, said
people were still uncertain about who, precisely, the new policy
makers would be and what reforms would be carried out. ``It is
always implementation that has failed,'' he added.
</P>
<P>
   Fedorov, now an author, said, ``once oil prices go down and
devaluation effects go away, things will be tough for Putin.''
</P>
<P>
   ``More stability will not carry the market,'' he added,
referring to investors' hope that Putin's strong hand will prove
enough to keep stocks rising. ``By the end of the year, there will
have to be other actions.''
</P>
<P>
   Dmitri V. Vasiliev, the former head of Russia's version of the
Securities and Exchange Commission, has a long list of what the
country needs, including laws and regulations that treat investors
and companies equally, lower taxes and improved collections.
</P>
<P>
   Now the head of a shareholders rights organization, backed by
institutional investors with $10 billion in Russian stocks,
Vasiliev said, ``Today, rules are so unclear that there are so many
opportunities for bribery.''
</P>
<P>
   Before the financial crisis, he said, investors looked at Russia
through ``rose-colored glasses'' and bought everything; after the
crisis, Russia was viewed through ``black glasses'' and nothing was
bought. Now, he said, investors need to ponder opportunities here
through ``clear glasses.''
</P>
<P>
   That means ``deep investment analysis'' of companies is
necessary, he said, especially concerning the honesty of executives
and any links to the oligarchs or organized crime. Foreign
investors face not only the risk of a tumbling stock market, but
also of maneuvers by Russian executives that could undermine the
value of a company or dilute the value of a stock.
</P>
<P>
   That kind of analysis, he allowed, ``is not easy, of course.''

TERRAIN ON MARS TOO ROUGH FOR SMALL PROBES, NASA PHOTOS INDICATE 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By MARK CARREAU 
c. 2000 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Most terrain of scientific interest on Mars is too rugged for
the small landing craft NASA has been sending, extensive new
photographs indicate. &UR;
</P>
<P>
   &LR; For more than two years, planetary geologist Ken Edgett has
been among the first experts to examine the steady stream of
photography dispatched to Earth by NASA's Mars Global Surveyor, a
small camera-equipped probe that has been circling the Red Planet
since September 1997.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Mars Global Surveyor is showing us just how rugged most of
the interesting parts of Mars are,'' said Edgett, a staff
researcher at Malin Space Science Systems, the San Diego-based
company that built and operates the probe's cameras.
</P>
<P>
   ``It looks very, very rugged, lots of sharp edges, points and
hills,'' said Edgett. ``We are dealing with a planet where it has
not rained for billions of years, if ever. Rain on the Earth tends
to smooth, erode and flatten down things. This has not happened on
Mars.''
</P>
<P>
   The doomed, 640-pound, 3 1/2-foot tall Mars Polar Lander and the
other small probes that NASA has been planning to launch are no
match for the planet that Global Surveyor is revealing, Edgett
said. Plans to launch a similar lander that would reach Mars in
2001 have been at least temporarily suspended in the wake of the
Polar Lander loss.
</P>
<P>
   Edgett also raised the issue during the annual Lunar and
Planetary Institute conference in Houston earlier this month.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mars Global Surveyor has completely revolutionized (our
understanding of) Mars,'' Edgett said. ``However, most of the
revolution is still under way. A lot of the data has not been
released to the general science community. Once it's released, it
may take a good decade of people sifting through that data before
it really sinks in.''
</P>
<P>
   Next week, the space agency plans to release the results of its
investigation into the Dec. 3 loss of the $221 million Polar
Lander, which was attempting to reach Mars' unexplored south pole.
The findings promise to alter the cost, pace and design of future
Mars probes.
</P>
<P>
   A $273 million mission, Global Surveyor maneuvered into orbit
around Mars in September 1997. Because of a mechanical problem the
probe was unable to begin its two-year mission of mapping the
planet's terrain until early 1999. Findings from the mission's
science teams are just beginning to make their way into prominent
science journals.
</P>
<P>
   Global Surveyor's cameras can detect objects as small as a
school bus. In contrast, features captured by NASA's Viking probes
of the late 1970s had to be as large as football stadium.
</P>
<P>
   Edgett said his greatest concern for the future of Mars
exploration is that the rugged terrains in the imagery collected by
the Global Surveyor are the features that are of highest scientific
value.
</P>
<P>
   ``My impression from what I've seen is that we should be
designing landers for the landing sites.'' said Edgett. ``If a
community of scientists decides, here is where we will find
evidence of life but that spot looks really nasty to land, we darn
well should design something to land there anyway.
</P>
<P>
   ``Otherwise we will be forced to land at places as flat and
smooth as an airport runway,'' he said. ``Those places are very
rare, and they are far away from the kinds of places that would be
of scientific interest.'' &UR;
</P>
<P>
   &LR; Among Mars' most prominent geological features, he notes, is
the 2,500 mile long Valles Marineris, a canyon system that drops to
a six-mile depth in places. Global Surveyor's cameras have revealed
a distinct layering of the canyon walls, including the the upper
most crust.
</P>
<P>
   The layering of Valles Marineris, if it can be accessed with
robotic probes, would offer scientists an unexpectedly thorough
chronological record of Martian climate change. Hidden among the
structures are evidence of volcanic activity, Earthquakes and
meteor impacts. They could reveal whether Mars once harbored oceans
and possibly life.
</P>
<P>
   On Earth, the oldest rocks are about 3.9 billion years-old,
about 600 million years younger than the estimated formation of the
solar system, creating a gap in what geologists can examine to
explain this planet's earliest evolution.
</P>
<P>
   The better preserved features on Mars offer the potential to
fill in the gaps.
</P>
<P>
   ``It might mean that we want something that can land on the wall
of Valles Marineris or that can land on the top and walk, crawl or
snake down,'' said Edgett.
</P>
<P>
   Launched in late 1996, Global Surveyor was part of the first
salvo in a wave of low cost missions that NASA hoped to launch to
Mars every 26 months. Each salvo was to include a lander and an
orbiter.
</P>
<P>
   Mars Pathfinder, the Global Surveyor's companion lander, reached
Mars with equal success July 4, 1997, returning close up images of
rocks scattered on an ancient watershed north of the planets'
equator.
</P>
<P>
   The second salvo in that wave, NASA's Mars Climate Orbiter as
well as the Polar Lander mission, failed.
</P>
<P>
   The $151 million Climate Orbiter mission was lost last Sept. 23
as it was maneuvering into orbit around Mars.

DOUBTS IN THE CYBER-CHURCH 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (For release Sunday, March 26, 2000)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DAVID WARSH  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   For 11 years, Tom Valovic was writer and then editor of perhaps
the liveliest trade publication to cover the dawn of the digital
age. Telecommunications magazine was established in the late 1960s
in suburban Boston and grew to prosperity, eventually competing
against vigorous weeklies such as Communications Week and Network
World, owned by McGraw Hill and IDG. It has remained independent
long past the point at which a lesser magazine would have been
swallowed up, thanks to family ownership and its engaging tone:
even ISDN jokes were permitted (It Still Does Nothing).
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, it was Valovic himself who wrote the article that fairly
can be said to have broken the story of the decade in June 1991:
``A Giant Step Towards Internet Commercialization?'' It began, as
usual, with a tip _ an e-mail tip, no less _ from Brian Kahin,
director of Harvard University's Information Infrastructure
Project. Valovic scrambled to pin it down, and in due course,
announced to the waiting world:
</P>
<P>
   ``According to several sources, ANS (the backbone operator of
the Internet) is expected to make a major announcement concerning
the creation of a separate for-profit subsidiary chartered to
develop the T3-based Internet backbone for commercial use. If this
does happen, it will have significant impacts for further Internet
commercialization.''
</P>
<P>
   The world was underwhelmed. In those days, the
telecommunications industry was a hyper-regulated world of Baby
Bells and switch manufacturers seemingly far removed from the
computer industry, where the networking drive was taking place (the
academic computer industry at that!). The rest of the world had
other things on its mind. So Valovic went on gathering more little
items for print, tracking the Net's ``elaborate progressions,''
until convergence of telecommunications, computers, publishing, and
entertainment was among the foremost topics on the Communal Mind.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would boost the Internet during the day, and come home and
have my doubts at night,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   The result of his evening pensees is ``Digital Mythologies: The
Hidden Complexities of the Internet.'' Published by Rutgers
University Press, Valovic's essays describe the rise of the hype
surrounding the Internet and surveys the counter-literature of
skepticism that it has spawned. It is an uncommonly thoughtful
book. Once again, the reporter has gotten a first-rate scoop.
</P>
<P>
   It was five years ago that technology pundit G. Pascal Zachary
coined the term Cyber-Church to characterize the quasi-religious
fervor that has gripped enthusiasts of the new communication
technologies. No one has come up with a better phrase. The
exuberant phase of revelation is mostly over. The new phase is one
of Second Thoughts.
</P>
<P>
   Thus Bill Joy, chief scientist of Sun Microsystems, recently
made headlines with a piece in Wired magazine that warned darkly
against uncontrolled progress in genetics, nanotechnology, and
robotics. Sinners confessing is a classic way of getting rubes into
the revival tent.
</P>
<P>
   John Seely Brown, director of the Xerox Palo Alto Research
Center (in which many aspects of computer-user interface were
designed), has teamed up with Paul Duguid of the University of
California at Berkeley to write ``The Social Life of Information.''
They argue that technological ``tunnel vision'' _ a narrow focus on
ends _ has pushed into the background important social
considerations that now must be redeemed.
</P>
<P>
   In ``The Evolution of the Wired Life,'' Charles Jonscher of
Harvard University's Program on Information Resouces Technology
argues that it is more important than ever to understand the
difference among data, information, and knowledge. The history of
the wired world he offers is most engaging.
</P>
<P>
   But only Valovic provides a revealing map of how the climate of
opinion got from there to here.
</P>
<P>
   For example, he describes the role of The Well, a dial-up
computer conferencing system organized by Stewart Brand more than a
decade ago in California that proved to be very influential in
framing the terms in which the new technology was to be discussed.
Well subscribers chose to participate in a wide range of
discussions _ chat rooms, we would say today _ and durable
connections formed there among thinkers, doers, and journalists.
</P>
<P>
   He vividly limns the rise of Wired magazine from (more or less)
the ashes of the Whole Earth Catalog. (The remarkable Stewart Brand
was among Wired's founders; Kevin Kelly, its executive editor, had
been a Whole Earth editor.) Despite Wired's self-professed disdain
for media empires, he writes ``Wired and Big Media seemed to be
made for each other.'' Wired's stable of freelance writers _ Steven
Levy, Paulin Borsook, Mitchell Kapor, Howard Rheigold, Jon Katz,
Brock Meeks, John Markoff, and others gradually moved out to
influential magazines, newspapers, foundations, and, of course, the
World Wide Web.
</P>
<P>
   Wired (and its countercultural counterpart, Mondo 2000) ``laid
the foundation for a new technocratic set of values that gained
mindshare not on the basis of being rigorously examined and then
accepted but rather unquestioningly swallowed whole on the basis of
its trendy cachet,'' he writes.
</P>
<P>
   ``The nebulous cloud of assumptions that pervaded Wired's
message tended to belie the notion that science and technology _
with their natural propensity for order, accuracy, and precision _
were involved here. No, there was something else present, a leap of
faith perhaps, or possibly a kind of cultural mutation that
operated conveniently out of the range of the expected set of
journalistic descriptive powers.''
</P>
<P>
   Valovic is no technophobe, as is to be expected of someone who
served as editor in chief of a high-tech trade magazine for five
years. Indeed, he is an expert on bringing seemingly disparate
worlds into communication with one another. (A market research
manager now for International Data Corp., he also teaches courses
at Northeastern University.)
</P>
<P>
   But he insists that context is important to such discussions _
and that context means attention to the concrete. A good portion of
his book is devoted to exploring the pathologies of the online
life, the weird dissociation that often accompanies extensive
virtual schmoozing. He is a persistent, patient advocate for
traditional concerns, for investing in children, spouses, gardens;
for balance.
</P>
<P>
   ``In general, the media seemed to have gotten caught up in the
Internet craze, almost in a pop-culture sense, and became prone to
repeating a single idea: that the new technologies were going to
profoundly change our lives in the realms of business, education,
health care, or just about any other realm that could be thought
of.
</P>
<P>
   ``While this was true enough on the surface of things, it also
became apparent that these breathlessly delivered renditions were
usually devoid of any real specifics. . . . Where were the
specifics of these transformations? How do we get past all the
marketing hype and constantly-invoked mythologies of digital
process and into something more tangible, more grounded in
day-to-day reality?
</P>
<P>
   ``After all, if we don't know what these changes will really
amount to, how can we possibly say that we think they are important
or exciting or wonderful?''
</P>
<P>

MODERATE ULSTER PARTY LEADER CHALLENGED BY FOE OF PEACE PACT 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By WARREN HOGE   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   BELFAST, Northern Ireland _ The Northern Ireland peace agreement
faces a showdown vote Saturday as members of the Ulster Unionists
decide whether to keep David Trimble as their leader or return
their party to its harder-line past.
</P>
<P>
   The 850-member party council is to vote on a leadership
challenge by the Rev. Martin Smyth, 68, a former grand master of
the Orange Order, the militant Protestant group. But the decision
will turn not on the delegates' views of the two men but on their
increasing level of discomfort with the peace pact, which Trimble
embraces and Smyth opposes.
</P>
<P>
   Smyth's bid looms as another setback for the already stalled
peace negotiations, but Trimble, 55, said he was ``relaxed'' about
the race.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think this was coming and it's part of the whole question of
change, generation change within the party, and is part of the way
in which the party is renewing itself at the moment, and some
people aren't comfortable with that,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   In persuading his party to take part in new political
arrangements under which Protestants, long the dominant force in
Ulster politics, share power with the Catholic minority, Trimble
has transformed its stance from a rigid one of surrendering as
little authority as possible to one that accommodates compromise.
In 1998 he shared the Nobel Peace Prize with John Hume, leader of
the Social Democratic and Labor Party, the largest Catholic group.
Trimble's party is the largest Protestant party in the province.
</P>
<P>
   But his moderate stance has cost him the support of party
members who have either opposed the settlement from its signing in
April 1998 or have grown disenchanted by what they perceive as its
favoritism toward the republican movement. Republicans, most of
whom are Catholic, want to see Northern Ireland with closer ties to
the Irish Republic, while the largely Protestant unionists want
Northern Ireland to remain part of Britain.
</P>
<P>
   The peace accord sought to balance these contrasting aspirations
and bring political stability to the province, where more than
3,600 people have died in three decades of sectarian violence. It
created a new power-sharing assembly as its centerpiece with
Trimble as first minister and members of the rival Sinn Fein party,
the political representatives of the Irish Republican Army, in
executive posts.
</P>
<P>
   But in February, the new home rule government abruptly ended
after only two months when the IRA failed to start disarming and
London re-established its authority over Northern Ireland.
</P>
<P>
   The British suspended the new administration to forestall
Trimble's almost certain ouster by his party if the government
continued without any weapons turnovers. Britain believes Trimble
to be essential to progress in Ulster, and Prime Minister Tony
Blair left no doubt Friday which candidate he favored.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's obviously a very clear choice for people, and the Ulster
Unionist Party will make its mind up, but I have got a very great
deal of respect for David Trimble and the enormous courage he has
shown in trying to give people a peaceful future in Northern
Ireland,'' he said in a statement from Lisbon, where he was
attending a European Union summit conference.
</P>
<P>
   Many unionists were angered last week when Trimble suggested
during a St. Patrick's Day visit to Washington that he would be
prepared to go back into government with Sinn Fein with no prior
disarmament as long as the IRA gave guarantees of its intention to
destroy its arsenal.
</P>
<P>
   Smyth said this statement prompted his challenge and showed that
under Trimble, the party was straying too far from its principles.
There should be ``no guns outside the door, no guns under the
table, no guns on the table,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Two years ago, 72 percent of the party council's members voted
to support the agreement, but last November, only 58 percent backed
Trimble's decision to enter government with Sinn Fein. If Smyth can
improve on that 42 percent dissident figure, Trimble's leadership _
and most likely the entire peace agreement _ is probably doomed.

   WASHINGTON WATCH VOTE CHART Questions regarding this
transmission should be directed to 202-628-3100, ext. 227.
WASHINGTON, March 24 -- The following chart shows how senators and
representatives voted on key bills and amendments within the last
week. A ``Y'' means the member voted for the measure; an ``N''
means the member voted against the measure; a ``?'' means the
member did not vote; and a ``P'' means the member voted
``present.''
</P>
<P>
   SENATE VOTES:
</P>
<P>
   1) BILL NUMBER: Security
</P>
<P>
   The Senate on Wednesday approved, 100 to 0, a bill that would
allow senior citizens, ages 65 through 69, to receive full Social
Security benefits if they decide to continue working after reaching
retirement age. Supporters, including President Clinton, said the
bill would help seniors struggling to make ends meet. There were no
opponents to the measure. A ``yes'' vote favors the bill.
</P>
<P>
   2) BILL NUMBER: Insurance
</P>
<P>
   The Senate on Thursday approved, 95 to 5, a $6 billion spending
measure to overhaul the nation's crop insurance system. The plan
puts $5 billion toward revising the current risk management program
and $1 billion toward researching new programs. Supporters said the
insurance plan reduces dependence on government disaster relief
programs. Opponents said the bill contained too much spending. A
``yes'' vote favors the bill.

   HOUSE VOTES:
</P>
<P>
   1) BILL NUMBER: Waste
</P>
<P>
   The House on Wednesday approved, 253 to 167, a bill to create a
permanent nuclear waste storage site at Yucca Mountain, Nevada. The
measure would allow 40,000 tons of radioactive waste around the
country to be transported to the site 90 miles north of Las Vegas.
Supporters said removing waste from temporary storage sites was
long overdue. Opponents, including President Clinton -- who intends
to veto the measure, say the plan is not environmentally sound. A
``yes'' vote favors the measure.
</P>
<P>
   2) BILL NUMBER: Oil
</P>
<P>
   The House on Wednesday approved, 382 to 38, a bill that makes it
U.S. policy to work with other oil importing nations to stop price
fixing by some oil exporting nations. Supporters said the bill
forces the president to take a tough stance on oil producers.
Opponents said the scaled-back version was weak and should contain
language instructing Clinton to cut military and economic aid to
countries that fix oil prices. A ``yes'' vote favors the bill.
</P>
<P>
   3) BILL NUMBER: Budget
</P>
<P>
   The House on Thursday rejected, 184 to 233, a five-year budget
plan that contained fewer tax cuts and more debt reduction monies
than a similar plan that later passed. The measure would have
provided prescription drug benefits for Medicare recipients.
Supporters said the bill would offer adequate tax relief while
reducing the nation's debt. Opponents said the tax cuts were not
large enough. A ``yes'' vote favors the measure.
</P>
<P>
   4) BILL NUMBER: Budget2
</P>
<P>
   The House on Thursday approved, 211 to 207, a five-year, $1.8
trillion budget plan. The measure, which would cut taxes $240
billion over five years, increases spending for defense, education,
and prescription drug benefits for Medicare recipients. Supporters
said the bill ensures fiscal discipline while freeing up money for
tax relief. Opponents said the tax cut was too large. A ``yes''
vote favors the measure.

TRAGEDY AVERTED IN BOSTON COLLEGE DORM FIRE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEWTON, Mass. _ A fast-moving fire in a Boston College dormitory
early sent students fleeing to the roof and banging on their
windows for help.
</P>
<P>
   Six students and two security officers were sent to city
hospitals for treatment for smoke inhalation. None of the injuries
was considered life-threatening, and five of the eight were
released Friday. The other three were expected to be released
Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   What could have been a tragedy became instead a frightening
lesson in fire's deadly potential. Fire, smoke, and heat alarms
worked in the Cardinal Medeiros dormitory for freshmen; Newton
firefighters responded almost immediately, and rescue was prompt
for about a half-dozen students trapped either on the roof or in
their rooms.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think God was good to B.C.,'' college spokesman Jack Dunn
said as he gazed at the charred north wing of the three-story
dormitory. The wing houses 37 students, all of whom have been
displaced by the fire.
</P>
<P>
   The blaze has been traced to a faulty plug strip in a
third-floor room, according to State Fire Marshal Stephen Coan and
B.C. officials. The plug strips are widely used by students on
college campuses, channeling power for computers, printers, CD
players and other appliances.
</P>
<P>
   Dunn said the 37 students are expected to be able to return to
their rooms within two weeks. In the meantime, they have been taken
in by other students who volunteered to house them until repairs
are completed.
</P>
<P>
   Dunn said damage was ``significant'' but he could not provide a
cost estimate.
</P>
<P>
   Friday's fire, however, will not soon be forgotten by the
freshmen in the Medeiros dormitory's C wing, one of three wings in
a townhouse-style complex at Hammond and Tudor streets.
</P>
<P>
   Matthew Breaux, a 19-year-old freshman from Lafayette, La., said
he figured the fire alarm at 5:17 a.m. signaled ``just another
drill.'' But then he hustled outside and saw wisps of smoke, then
flames, coming from the adjoining C wing.
</P>
<P>
   ``After a few minutes, I saw people at their windows, trapped,''
Breaux said. ``They were banging on their screens; they might as
well have been in a jail cell. One kid said he couldn't see his
door from his window, and that's only about 10 feet.''
</P>
<P>
   Firefighters lifted ladders to those windows as well as to two
students who had fled to the sharply pitched dormitory roof, and
rescued everybody. One student, who suffered neck burns, was
discovered unconscious in his room by firefighters.
</P>
<P>
   Dunn said everyone in the dorm had been accounted for by 5:40
a.m. ``The issue wasn't getting students out, but the fast-moving
action of the fire,'' which had heat that reached 1,100 degrees,
Dunn said. The evacuation proceeded without panic, he said.
</P>
<P>
   A Jan. 19 dormitory fire at Seton Hall University in East
Orange, N.J., where three students were killed and 58 were injured,
prompted Boston College to re-evaluate its fire precautions, Dunn
said.

FORMER NFL PLAYER'S BEST HIT: $28 MILLION TEXAS JACKPOT 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  (Eds.: Moved in ``a'' and ``s'' categories) 
 
By JOHN W. GONZALEZ 
c. 2000 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ Thomas ``Hollywood'' Henderson already knew he
was lucky. The former All-Pro Dallas Cowboys linebacker had
survived the NFL, crack addiction, suicidal urges and prison.
</P>
<P>
   And he already considered himself a rich man, at least compared
to the inner-city Austin kids he is devoted to helping.
</P>
<P>
   But Henderson, 47, had powerful new proof of his good fortune
and wealth Friday: a Texas lottery ticket that will bring him about
$14.5 million.
</P>
<P>
   ``I already have money. I've got a nice home, a big truck and
some cars. The only thing that's going to change about me is it's
going to add some zeros to my account,'' Henderson said.
</P>
<P>
   He defied the game's 15.8 million-to-1 odds with six winning
numbers out of 50 in Wednesday's drawing, capturing the biggest
Lotto Texas jackpot of the year and one of the larger unshared
pots.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know the odds of winning are like one in 17 million. But
what are the odds of me winning?'' he asked.
</P>
<P>
   Henderson bought $100 worth of tickets for Wednesday's $28
million jackpot and allowed the computer to choose the winning
numbers _ 5, 8, 17, 35, 38, 41.
</P>
<P>
   Lottery officials said that because Henderson chose the lump sum
``cash-option'' payment, his prize will actually amount to
$14,491,235. After taxes, he'll get a check for $10,433,690,
spokesman Keith Elkins said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Thank you, God. Thank you very much,'' he told Austin's
KXAN-TV Thursday night when he first disclosed he held the winning
ticket. After that interview, he said he celebrated alone.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had a one-man party. I went to 7-Eleven and got a sausage
biscuit with egg, some little white donuts, some whole milk and a
large bottle of water. That was the celebration spread,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was in bed by 11 o'clock, but I didn't go to sleep.''
</P>
<P>
   Henderson said his all-important charitable work with
underprivileged kids just got easier.
</P>
<P>
   ``I won't have to beg so much any more,'' he told KXAN. ``I
won't have to fast any more,'' as he once did to raise money for a
youth sports facility.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been rich, I've been poor. I've been bad, I've been good.
For the last 16 years I've been clean and sober. I've been trying
to make a difference in my children's lives and the lives of
kids,'' Henderson said. ``I've tried to be a good steward in my
community. I've tried to be an activist.
</P>
<P>
   ``A friend of mine said to me tonight, `It's karma. You just got
the big bonus in karma for the work you've done,''' said Henderson,
who counsels substance abusers as well as heading up his nonprofit
foundation.
</P>
<P>
   He accepted the friend's assessment. How else could the Austin
native explain his trip from humble roots to fame, from sports hero
to inmate, from rehabilitated role model to the super-wealthy?
</P>
<P>
   A surprise first-round draft pick out of Langston College in
Oklahoma, the three-time Super Bowl veteran played for the Cowboys
from 1975-79, when he was fired by the late Coach Tom Landry due to
cocaine addiction. When he eulogized Landry just five weeks ago, he
called him ``the greatest man I've ever known.''
</P>
<P>
   Henderson finished out his playing career with Houston, Miami
and San Francisco. But in 1984, his football days behind him, he
hit a low point. He began serving 28 months in a California prison
for felony convictions of sexual assault and bribery. The charges
stemmed from a crack-hazed encounter with two Long Beach teen-age
girls.
</P>
<P>
   ``I received a sexual favor from one for letting them smoke
crack with me. Sex for crack. That is the way it was,'' he said in
a belated apology to his Cowboys teammates in 1997. He also penned
an autobiography, ``Out of Control.''
</P>
<P>
   But even after his prison stint and years as an anti-drug
campaigner, Henderson wasn't through paying for his crimes. This
year, a disappointed Henderson _ ineligible to hold office _ was
forced to abandon plans to run for Austin City Council because he
was never pardoned nor had his criminal record expunged.
</P>
<P>
   Despite his troubled past, in the capital city Henderson is
well-known and admired for his nearly single-handed development of
a sports center for East Austin youths. He went on a hunger strike
in 1997 to raise money for the outdoor track and field facility,
and he has spent copious amounts of time building and maintaining
it. But it's still a work in progress, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We need hurdles, high-jump apparatus, pole vault apparatus. I
called and got a price the other day. It's $15,000,'' he said, and
with a laugh added: ``Oh, well. I'll be writing a check.''
</P>
<P>
   To do the Thursday interview with KXAN, he dropped by the store
where he bought his ticket _ Nau's Enfield Drug, an old-fashioned
pharmacy and hangout in the Clarksville neighborhood one mile west
of the Capitol. The store is about three blocks from his
fashionable condo.
</P>
<P>
   ``I won $28 million in my neighborhood. In my neighborhood,'' he
repeated. ``It's going to stay in Austin because I'm not leaving
Austin. This is my hometown.''
</P>
<P>
   He said he figured out he had the winning ticket Thursday and
spent a listless day staring at his ticket and preparing to go
public with his secret.
</P>
<P>
   By Friday, Henderson was hard to find and less eager to talk,
apparently weary of media and well-wishers' calls.
</P>
<P>
   But Henderson did contact the Texas Lottery Commission on Friday
to get informal confirmation that he was the winner. He told
officials that next week or later, after consulting with an
attorney and financial adviser, he plans to surrender the ticket in
return for his multimillion-dollar check.

 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By CARLTON THOMPSON  
 c. 2000, Houston Chronicle  
VERO BEACH, Fla. _ When Shane Reynolds received the official word
Friday that he would be the Astros' opening-day starter April 3 at
Pittsburgh, he didn't exactly jump for joy.
<TEXT>
<P>
   Perhaps it's because that isn't his nature. Or maybe it's
because he has had the honor four previous times. Then again, it
could be something totally different.
</P>
<P>
   ``Who wants to pitch against the other team's No. 1 starter?''
Reynolds said.
</P>
<P>
   Drawing the opening-day assignment pretty much assures Reynolds
will be matched with the ace _ or at least one of the top pitchers
_ from opposing teams during the early part of the season, until
rotations start getting off kilter.
</P>
<P>
   It makes getting off to a hot start that much more difficult.
</P>
<P>
   ``It makes a big difference,'' Reynolds said. ``I'm sure anyone
would rather face someone besides the No. 1 starter on other
teams.''
</P>
<P>
   Being slotted in the No. 1 position didn't seem to bother
Reynolds in 1999, when he was 4-1 with a 2.65 ERA the first month
of the season. His .650 career winning percentage for April is his
second-best for any month.
</P>
<P>
   Manager Larry Dierker chose Reynolds over Jose Lima despite Lima
having posted better statistics in 1999.
</P>
<P>
   Lima was 21-10 with a 3.58 ERA, while Reynolds was 16-14 and
3.85. The fact Reynolds has started every opening day since 1996
factored heavily into Dierker's decision.
</P>
<P>
   ``Starting on opening day is an honor, but it's also a
challenge,'' Dierker said. ``You get so excited, and you have to
keep your emotions under control. I think Shane has a better chance
to do that because he's started on opening day before.''
</P>
<P>
   By starting on opening day for the fifth time, Reynolds will
match J.R. Richard and Mike Scott for the most opening-day
assignments in franchise history.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a nice honor, but it's not the only thing in the world,''
Reynolds said. ``It's not the reason I work as hard as I do.''
</P>
<P>
   An argument could be made that not all of Reynolds' opening-day
assignments have been based on merit. In 1996, Doug Drabek was
scheduled to pitch the first game but Reynolds was pushed up a day
when Drabek suffered a hamstring injury.
</P>
<P>
   Darryl Kile would have been the likely choice to open in 1998
after winning 19 games the previous season. Reynolds got the nod
because Kile signed a free-agent contract with Colorado after the
1997 season.
</P>
<P>
   Randy Johnson's departure following the 1998 season helped
Reynolds' cause in 1999, just as the Mike Hampton trade opened the
door this time. But while Reynolds may not have delivered the best
season among his mound mates every year, he has been the club's
most consistent pitcher over the past four years.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's kind of funny how things work out,'' Reynolds said.
``There were many different reasons for me starting on opening day
so many times.''
</P>
<P>
   Pirates manager Gene Lamont has tabbed righthander Jason Schmidt
as his opening-day starter; how Pittsburgh's rotation will line up
for the remainder of the series is unclear.
</P>
<P>
   Lima will start the second game of the Pittsburgh series,
followed by Chris Holt.
</P>
<P>
   That puts Octavio Dotel in position to start the first
regular-season game at Enron Field, when the Astros host the
Philadelphia Phillies on April 7. Dwight Gooden would make his
first start in the second game of that series.
</P>
<P>
   Gooden also is in line to start the inaugural game at Enron
Field, Thursday's exhibition against the Yankees _ one of his
former teams.
</P>
<P>
   Lima will start against New York the following night, and Holt
is scheduled to start the final game of the exhibition season April
1 against the Texas Rangers, also at Enron Field.
</P>
<P>
   Where starting pitching looked like a weakness _ or at least a
question mark _ at the beginning of spring training, it has been
one of the most pleasant surprises of the Grapefruit League season.
</P>
<P>
   The five pitchers who will make up the Astros' season-opening
rotation have a combined spring ERA of 3.31. If they carry that
type of success into the season, maybe people will stop asking how
the team plans to manage without Hampton, who won 22 games in 1999.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think Holtie is going to have a great year, and with Shane
and Jose they're going to be fine,'' Hampton said. ``One person
doesn't make that much of a difference on a team, I don't care who
you are. It still takes 25 guys to win.
</P>
<P>
   ``They've still got a powerful lineup, and they've still got
good pitching, so they're going to be fine.''

   SHAKHTY, Russia _ The air is so choked with dust deep in the
October Revolution Mine that only the beams from the coal miners'
head lamps are visible in the distance.
</P>
<P>
   That group of 12 miners is wrestling with a roaring grinding
machine that works its way like an iron mole along the seam. It
gouges chunks of sparkling coal from the wall and spews the shards
onto a conveyor.
</P>
<P>
   All the earth would have to do is shrug, and the lives of 206
Russian miners on the day shift would be extinguished. Yet the
miners consider themselves lucky to have jobs, even though they are
owed wages dating from September.
</P>
<P>
   ``They started paying us again, because now is the time of
election fever, but we will see what happens after the election,''
said Stanislov Gribonov, who has worked underground here for 20 of
his 47 years.
</P>
<P>
   The coal miners are one of the country's most identifiable labor
groups, and because their labor is essential to life itself in the
Russian winter, they played a crucial role in the political
struggles that attended the demise of the Soviet Union.
</P>
<P>
   And with their strikes and marches on Moscow, they enlivened the
election campaigns when Boris Yeltsin fought the powerful tide of
labor discontent over his economic reforms. The miners were
especially motivated because wages, pensions and social benefits
were often the first victims of privatizing industries.
</P>
<P>
   As Russians prepare to go to the polls this weekend to elect
Yeltsin's successor, the miners here, 600 miles south of Moscow,
find themselves, like many Russians, trying to decide whether to
support the front-runner, Vladimir Putin, the acting president, or
to cast a protest vote for one of the other 10 candidates.
</P>
<P>
   ``Putin gives us hope,'' Gennady Zhikharev, 36, said. ``He gives
us hope that he can finish the war in Chechnya, that he can raise
up the economy. At least he has shown us he can do something in
Chechnya.''
</P>
<P>
   But there are also anger and disillusionment.
</P>
<P>
   ``The people in power have cheated us a lot, and Putin is just
continuing in the tradition of Yeltsin,'' Gribonov said, as he and
fellow miners took a break from grinding coal to talk with a
visitor this week. As Gribonov spoke, he shifted on the kneepads
that the miners wear as they scramble on all fours in the cramped
tunnels.
</P>
<P>
   ``I like Zyuganov,'' Gribonov said about the Communist Party
leader, Gennady Zyuganov, ``because what is important to me is that
me and my two daughters will be healthy and that they will have a
chance to grow up and get into a good institute and have a good
life.''
</P>
<P>
   In this mining center there is plenty to be angry about. The
coal industry has been ravaged by economic collapse. The wage
arrears here are among the worst in the country, and working
conditions make it seem heroic each time these miners don their
helmets and sling their battery backs and respirators on their
belts for another descent into the warren of tunnels 1,200 feet
below ground.
</P>
<P>
   On the road from Rostov-on-Don to Shakhty, beyond a landscape of
barren wheat fields, slag piles rise like low mountains in a line
that follows the coal seam deep underground. Half the 26 mines
operated by Rostovugol, the former state coal combine, have closed,
and the work force has declined, from 100,000 to 28,000. Production
dropped from a peak of 20 million tons a year in the 1980s to fewer
than 5 million in 1999.
</P>
<P>
   State subsidies for investment in new equipment have largely
disappeared, forcing the mines to barter with both suppliers and
customers.
</P>
<P>
   Today the company receives hard currency for only one-third of
its sales. The rest is barter.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am voting for Zyuganov,'' Valery Klimovich, 32, said. ``It
was 100 times better under the communists, because we could travel
about our country almost for free and we could take our vacations
at the sea at any resort.''
</P>
<P>
   Vladimir Orlov, 48, agreed, saying, ``For simple workers, life
under the communists was better, more stable, and we lived
better.''
</P>
<P>
   Viktor Sakhabiyev said he was voting for Vladimir Zhirinovsky,
the hard-line nationalist who talks of setting up a police state
and bringing back the KGB. ``He says the right things,'' Sakhabiyev
said. ``He would use the iron fist.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   In Klimovich's view, the economy is like a tree and the roots
are the mines. His metaphor resembled the catechism of the
state-planned economy.
</P>
<P>
   After he had described the leaves of the tree as factories and
their fruits as products, he explained that in the Yeltsin era the
roots have withered for lack of money. He said the government was
``severing the roots while pouring water on the leaves.''
</P>
<P>
   The miners expressed little faith or understanding of the market
economy and questioned whether such a system would be able to
deliver the modest prosperity that they enjoyed in times past.
</P>
<P>
   ``I haven't really understood this market economy,'' Gribonov
said, ``unless it is just a means to degrade the country's
resources.''

WHY THE OLD MATH MAY NOT APPLY IN SAN FRANCISCO

<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Until last week, it seemed likely that The San
Francisco Examiner would be an orphan of the information age.
</P>
<P>
   The Hearst Corp. no longer had any use for The Examiner, its
first property and onetime flagship, once the company bought the
paper's thriving rival, The San Francisco Chronicle, for $660
million last year. Dwindling circulation, red ink and potential
antitrust concerns more or less forced Hearst to sell, and The
Examiner had been on the block since last summer.
</P>
<P>
   In theory, there should have been a host of bidders salivating
over such a well-known if struggling title serving a city full of
the wealthy, well-educated readers whom advertisers covet.
</P>
<P>
   For one thing, the city is awash in venture capital, no small
amount of it pouring into new-media ventures meant to reach that
very audience. And major newspaper chains like Knight Ridder own
papers in suburbs and nearby cities that might fit well with The
Examiner, whose readership is concentrated in San Francisco proper.
</P>
<P>
   Yet The Examiner was shunned like a silver dollar in the middle
of Market Street traffic. Several of the big newspaper companies
looked at its books, but none were among the final bidders. To get
The Examiner off its hands, Hearst agreed to pay expenses _ as much
as $16 million this year and $25 million in 2001 and 2002,
according to court filings _ to Ted Fang, whose family publishes 12
free local newspapers.
</P>
<P>
   The Examiner's near-death experience illuminates the kinds of
risks that newspaper companies are willing _ and unwilling _ to
take today. Knight Ridder, Tribune, The New York Times, Belo and
McClatchy have recently tolerated losses of $8 million to $20
million a year on Internet ventures with unproven business models,
according to company filings and presentations to analysts.
</P>
<P>
   Jim Moroney, president of Belo Interactive, and Ross Jones,
chief financial officer of Knight Ridder, say that building Web
sites is a research-and-development cost. ``People are increasingly
going to be going to the Internet for a local content experience,''
Moroney said. ``We need to be there.'' For Jones, The Examiner, cut
off from the joint operating agreement, is ``not a complete
newspaper.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's something between a newspaper and a start-up,'' Jones
said.
</P>
<P>
   These companies have all bought newspapers in metropolitan
markets in the last six years, but all passed on The Examiner.
</P>
<P>
   Does his willingness to go where they feared to tread make Fang
a visionary, or a fool? In some measure, he is whistling past ``the
graveyard full of mastheads,'' as the newspaper analyst John Morton
put it. Local business interests bought, but could not sustain, the
Cleveland Press (it closed its doors in 1982) and the St. Louis
Globe-Democrat (it folded in 1985).
</P>
<P>
   Judging by circulation figures, the odds this time are just as
steep: The Examiner sells an average of 107,100 copies daily, less
than one-quarter of The Chronicle's 457,000. ``I am aware of the
pressure of history on this project,'' Fang said last week. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   What made The Examiner so unappealing to the industry giants
with the experience and resources to better the odds? Morton offers
the old newspaper math as an answer.
</P>
<P>
   The two biggest costs of producing a daily are labor and
newsprint. Publishing The Examiner at roughly its current size,
110,000 copies of 70 broadsheet pages, six days a week, would
consume some $20 million in paper annually at today's newsprint
prices. Even at half the size, it would take $12 million of paper,
Morton estimated.
</P>
<P>
   As for labor, by the industry rule of thumb of one journalist
for each 1,000 copies sold, the paper's newsroom needs 100 people,
half the size of the current staff. To get and keep them, a new
owner must pay enough to overcome the region's high cost of living
and compete with new media fishing in the same talent pool, like
Salon.com, Quokka Sports, The Industry Standard or Marketwatch.com.
With salary and benefits, figure $75,000 to $100,000 a head, or
$7.5 million to $10 million annually, Morton said.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   There are computers to buy, presses to run, trucks to drive. In
those areas, a buyer's existing resources can help hold down costs.
Still, several million dollars a year would be needed, Morton
estimated.
</P>
<P>
   Add it up and the cost of getting out the paper starts at $25
million a year _ the maximum size of the Hearst subsidy.
</P>
<P>
   Since 1965, The Chronicle and The Examiner have combined their
circulation and advertising departments in a joint operating
agreement and split the income, which, after they paid their
newsrooms, could be taken as profit. It is unclear how The Examiner
can independently match that income, estimated at $50 million.
</P>
<P>
   Advertising brings in 75 percent to 80 percent of revenue at
most newspapers. But high-margin classified ad volume has come
under pressure in recent years from Internet competitors like
Monster.com. And how many display advertisers will want to sell
their wares through the smaller of two general-interest
metropolitan dailies?
</P>
<P>
   Neither is there much room to increase circulation revenue. The
San Francisco Bay area, with 5.4 million people, is home to 19
daily newspapers, many of which dominate their chosen slices of the
region.
</P>
<P>
   Given these cloudy prospects, some critics say Hearst's deal
with Fang is a sham, meant to stave off antitrust action by the
Justice Department while limiting Hearst's costs and shielding The
Chronicle from serious competition.
</P>
<P>
   Others say the old math may not apply. ``I am one of those
weirdos who happen to believe that if The Examiner is spun off it
has a chance,'' said Tim Redmond, executive editor of The Bay
Guardian, an alternative newspaper that has railed editorially for
three decades against the joint operating agreement. ``I'd make it
a tabloid, focus tightly on the city, create flashy front pages,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   Pan Asia Venture Capital, the Fang family company, has a history
of buying failing local newspapers and reviving them by cutting
costs and emphasizing community news. ``It took the local touch my
family brought to these newspapers to make them work,'' Fang said.
</P>
<P>
   Dailies are not weeklies, of course. Still, The Examiner need
not go toe to toe with The Chronicle to survive as a daily, judging
by the experience of the The Palo Alto Daily News, which lives
profitably in the shadow of The San Jose Mercury News by giving
away 26,500 copies and keeping its operations lean _ just 30
employees in all.
</P>
<P>
   Or Fang could find a deep-pockets patron that would subsidize a
newspaper that reflects its views, as the Unification Church does
with The Washington Times. Fang's father, John, came to San
Francisco from Taiwan to be editor of The Young China Daily, backed
by Chiang Kai-Shek's Nationalist Party. He later struck out on his
own.
</P>
<P>
   The family's alternative weeklies, known for fiercely partisan
coverage, have been credited with tipping tight city elections
toward candidates they favored.
</P>
<P>
   But Fang rejects the mouthpiece model for The Examiner. ``I
don't want to be funded by someone with an agenda,'' he said. And
he said he had no plans to convert to free distribution.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're going to think outside of the box, but we intend to run
The Examiner as a paid, subscriber-based morning newspaper,'' he
said, seizing a chance that none of the giant chains was willing to
take.

GORE, EARNEST STUDENT AND NATURAL TEACHER, WITH A SWEET TOOTH 
</HEADLINE>
  (See also GORE-EXCERPTS) 
(mk) 
 By KATHARINE Q. SEELYE   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   MACOMB, Mich. _ Vice President Al Gore was sitting around with a
group of students when Sally Hannert, the drama teacher, plucked
him out to participate in a theatrical exercise. A look of mild
panic froze his face, but he gamely plunged in.
</P>
<P>
   Gore and Stephanie White, 12, were to play a father and daughter
discussing her bad report card. But they could not use words, just
gibberish, while another student, Rachel Burke, 11, had to guess
the plot through their gestures and tone.
</P>
<P>
   ``NNNNAAAARRRRVOOOO,'' the vice president said. Rachel
interpreted the indistinct slur of vowels and choked consonants as
the plight of a girl afraid of being attacked by a bear. Still, she
perceived Gore as a benevolent figure and decided what he was
saying was this: ``Everything will be OK. I'll take care of it. I'm
the vice president.''
</P>
<P>
   Stephanie rated him later as clueless, but a great success.
</P>
<P>
   ``He didn't know what was going on,'' she told a reporter. ``But
it was really fun to play with him.''
</P>
<P>
   From the drama class to a discussion on the Industrial
Revolution to the cafeteria, where he wolfed down two slices of
pepperoni pizza, two chocolate chip cookies and half a brownie, the
vice president delved into suburban school life Friday, showing
himself off as dutiful student and natural pedagogue _ and, his
campaign hoped, as being in touch with ordinary Americans and more
concerned about education than his Republican rival, Gov. George W.
Bush of Texas.
</P>
<P>
   In the first ``school days'' of his campaign _ he promises one
every couple of weeks and pledges to continue them if he is elected
president _ Gore is using the novelty of a presidential candidate's
spending an entire day in school to draw attention to his
commitment to education.
</P>
<P>
   In a recent Pew survey, voters said that Bush cared more about
this vital issue than did Gore. But Gore aides believe that as Gore
and his proposals become better known, he will catch up.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think I can demonstrate to you during the course of this
campaign that I have the perspective and heart to do the job,'' the
vice president told a group of students, teachers and parents in
the course of his day, which ran from a 7:45 a.m. hallway chat with
school custodians to a 2 p.m. rally in the gym.
</P>
<P>
   The site was not random. The school, L'Anse Creuse Middle School
North, sits smack in Macomb County, a landmark bellwether electoral
district northeast of Detroit where Reagan Democrats first emerged
and were then coaxed back to the Democratic fold by Bill Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   Voters here _ many of them white, Roman Catholic, blue-collar
and socially conservative _ represent one of Gore's greatest
challenges. They voted for Sen. John McCain of Arizona in the
Republican primary this year and are being wooed by Bush, whose
father won them over in 1988 and 1992. Gore needs to keep them and
sought his way to their hearts Friday through their children.
</P>
<P>
   Gore uttered nary a word about the Bush family Friday, trying to
focus instead on the concerns especially of suburban mothers here,
from stopping school violence to nurturing their inner selves. He
emphasized the importance of parental involvement and used the day
as he used his town meetings in the primary season _ to convey that
he is not a scripted politician but a real person, and a sensitive
one at that.
</P>
<P>
   In a soft-focus, FM-radio voice, he told students at every
opportunity to be focused and disciplined, as if sharing a campaign
secret from his advisers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Be true to yourself, be honest, keep a good sense of what's
important in your life, set priorities and if it is important
enough for you to reach a goal, you can reach a goal,'' he said in
response to a student who asked him how to succeed.
</P>
<P>
   The day was given over also to small revelations about the vice
president, who, many people here said, once seemed cold and remote
but now seemed like one of them.
</P>
<P>
   His day began after a sleepover on Thursday night at the home of
a teacher, Claudia Amboyer, 52, and her husband, Donald, a former
sheriff.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday night, Amboyer fed the vice president chocolate cake
(``Don't most men like chocolate cake?'' she asked later) and on
Friday morning cooked him scrambled eggs and bacon. She told him
that she sold antiques and was interested to hear that Gore's
father had also sold antiques. She described the experience as
``wonderful and unnerving,'' telling reporters that she did not see
any Secret Service agents but that a Winnebago mysteriously arrived
in her driveway and stayed the night.
</P>
<P>
   She and the vice president rode to school together Friday
morning in a cavalcade of suburban vans. Gore helped guide a civics
discussion that moved from the Industrial Revolution to global
warming to child labor laws. The parents of some students work in
the auto industry, but as Gore questioned the students, he found
few who were interested in doing work like their parents.
</P>
<P>
   Their aspirations, they told him as he toured a
technical-education room, were different: veterinarian, lawyer,
marine biologist. One girl said she wanted to be an author, to
which Gore responded: ``You must be a good writer. Do you know
Annie Proulx? Get a book called `Shipping News' and look at the way
she writes.''
</P>
<P>
   But mostly, he wanted his listeners to know that he came as a
student.
</P>
<P>
   ``I learned in my work setting up the reinventing-government
program,'' he said, ``that the most important insights and lessons
by far actually come from the people who are doing the hands-on
work.''

STRONG OUTING IMPROVES ROSE'S SHOT AT STARTING ROTATION 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DAN SHAUGHNESSY  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   FORT MYERS, Fla. _ The battle for the fifth starting spot in the
Red Sox' rotation continues to rage.
</P>
<P>
   Friday it was Brian Rose's turn. The big righthander registered
4 1/3 innings of one-run ball in a 7-1 victory over the Texas
Rangers. Rose gave up five hits and walked three, but pitched out
of trouble and remains in contention with Juan Pena and Bryce
Florie for the job. Of the three hurlers, only Florie would be kept
as a reliever, which means it's doubtful both Rose and Pena will
start the season with the team.
</P>
<P>
   Rose has started five spring games, giving up four earned runs
in 14 1/3 innings (2.52 ERA). Pena has a 1.32 ERA in five
appearances covering 13 2/3 innings. The Sox have options left on
both pitchers.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel as though I'm getting a little stronger,'' said Rose.
``One more start and spring's over. Everyone would like to know,
but I've got to go out with the same frame of mind. I feel like I
pitched well this spring. I feel as though I put myself in position
to help the team out.''
</P>
<P>
   It's possible another starter could get hurt or the Sox could
put veteran lefthander Jeff Fassero in the bullpen (manager Jimy
Williams says Tim Wakefield is in the starting rotation), but
barring either scenario, Rose or Pena appears bound for the minors
after a good spring.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're two young arms and they were both on the shelf last
year,'' said the manager. ``You never have enough pitching, but we
can only take 25 and both of them are still in the hunt.''
</P>
<P>
   The Sox are still at a whopping 39 players and will leave for
Arizona next Thursday. Williams said the fourth and fifth starters
would stay behind when the team goes to Phoenix for the final two
exhibition games before opening the season in Seattle. He said the
Sox might take five extra players to Arizona and make final cuts
there.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Frye shagging flies
</P>
<P>
   Jeff Frye played left and right field and made a nice catch of a
Frank Catalanotto fly in the second inning. The dugout greeted Frye
with a standing ovation and several ``We're not worthy'' bows. Frye
appears to be in a battle with Donnie Sadler, who plays some
outfield. Frye wasn't particularly happy with the assignment and
said, ``It's not my favorite spot, but it's a spot. I felt all
right. But it's boring out there. It's way too boring.'' Frye had
two hits, as did Jose Offerman . . . The Sox pounded six hits in
scoring five runs in the third inning. Nomar Garciaparra, Mike
Stanley, Darren Lewis, and John Valentin all doubled in the inning
. . . Carl Everett had his second outfield assist when he threw out
Rangers leadoff man Royce Clayton going for a double in the first .
. . John Valentin has a nasty bruise on his left biceps, courtesy
of a Ramiro Mendoza pitch Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Gaetti makes impression
</P>
<P>
   Gary Gaetti started at first base and played six innings. He
rejected any speculation that he'd retire even if the Sox decide to
keep him. ``The knee is sore, but it's coming around,'' he said.
Gaetti fielded everything cleanly and looked good making throws to
second base. Clearly, he's a Williams favorite . . . Lewis stole
his seventh base . . . Another day off for Marty Cordova (ribs).
He's not scheduled to go to Clearwater, Fla., with the team
Saturday for its game with Philadelphia. He hit live batting
practice Friday and is scheduled to do so again Saturday. Rod Beck
has a stiff neck and did not pitch. ``He's day-to-day,'' said
pitching coach Joe Kerrigan. Williams said Beck underwent an MRI .
. . Pedro Martinez is scheduled to pitch against the Phillies and
wants to throw 70-75 pitches . . . Former outfielder Jim Eisenreich
is a scout with the Kansas City Royals and has seen the Sox three
times this week, but he says there's nothing afoot on the trade
front. ... There's a grass-roots campaign afoot to change the zip
code of Hernando, Fla., home of Ted Williams. The Hernando zip is
34442. Williams's lifetime batting average was .34441 and that zip
is unassigned. Sounds like a job for the postmaster general.
Williams used to weigh his bats at the post office.

   NEWTON, Mass. _ A fast-moving fire in a Boston College dormitory
early Friday sent students fleeing to the roof and banging on their
windows for help.
</P>
<P>
   Six students and two security officers were sent to city
hospitals for treatment for smoke inhalation. None of the injuries
was considered life-threatening, and five of the eight were
released Friday. The other three were expected to be released
Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   What could have been a tragedy became instead a frightening
lesson in fire's deadly potential. Fire, smoke, and heat alarms
worked in the Cardinal Medeiros dormitory for freshmen; Newton
firefighters responded almost immediately, and rescue was prompt
for about a half-dozen students trapped either on the roof or in
their rooms.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think God was good to B.C.,'' college spokesman Jack Dunn
said as he gazed at the charred north wing of the three-story
dormitory. The wing houses 37 students, all of whom have been
displaced by the fire.
</P>
<P>
   The blaze has been traced to a faulty plug strip in a
third-floor room, according to State Fire Marshal Stephen Coan and
B.C. officials. The plug strips are widely used by students on
college campuses, channeling power for computers, printers, CD
players and other appliances.
</P>
<P>
   Dunn said the 37 students are expected to be able to return to
their rooms within two weeks. In the meantime, they have been taken
in by other students who volunteered to house them until repairs
are completed.
</P>
<P>
   Dunn said damage was ``significant'' but he could not provide a
cost estimate.
</P>
<P>
   Friday's fire, however, will not soon be forgotten by the
freshmen in the Medeiros dormitory's C wing, one of three wings in
a townhouse-style complex at Hammond and Tudor streets.
</P>
<P>
   Matthew Breaux, a 19-year-old freshman from Lafayette, La., said
he figured the fire alarm at 5:17 a.m. signaled ``just another
drill.'' But then he hustled outside and saw wisps of smoke, then
flames, coming from the adjoining C wing.
</P>
<P>
   ``After a few minutes, I saw people at their windows, trapped,''
Breaux said. ``They were banging on their screens; they might as
well have been in a jail cell. One kid said he couldn't see his
door from his window, and that's only about 10 feet.''
</P>
<P>
   Firefighters lifted ladders to those windows as well as to two
students who had fled to the sharply pitched dormitory roof, and
rescued everybody. One student, who suffered neck burns, was
discovered unconscious in his room by firefighters.
</P>
<P>
   Dunn said everyone in the dorm had been accounted for by 5:40
a.m. ``The issue wasn't getting students out, but the fast-moving
action of the fire,'' which had heat that reached 1,100 degrees,
Dunn said. The evacuation proceeded without panic, he said.
</P>
<P>
   A Jan. 19 dormitory fire at Seton Hall University in East
Orange, N.J., where three students were killed and 58 were injured,
prompted Boston College to re-evaluate its fire precautions, Dunn
said.

BLAIR IS PRESSED TO TAKE PATERNITY LEAVE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By KEVIN CULLEN  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON _ It's not as if Prime Minister Tony Blair doesn't have
enough on his mind, what with the peace process in Northern Ireland
stalled and his handpicked candidate in the upcoming London mayor's
race trailing badly in the polls.
</P>
<P>
   But it all pales in comparison to the pressure Blair is feeling
at home as his wife, Cherie, pregnant with their fourth child,
approaches her May due date.
</P>
<P>
   Under government policy, Blair is, like any new dad, entitled to
take paternity leave, as much as 13 weeks off without pay. His wife
wants him to take at least some of it, and many in his Labor Party
say it is incumbent on the incumbent of 10 Downing St. to show that
what's good for the people is good for the prime minister.
</P>
<P>
   ``Taking leave would be an excellent signal to other men and
other employers that no job is so important that you can't afford
time off to spend with a newborn child,'' said Mary-Ann Stephenson,
director of the Fawcett Society, a group that lobbies for gender
equality in Britain.
</P>
<P>
   But Blair is, like his hard-charging lawyer wife, something of a
workaholic and doesn't exactly relish the idea of relinquishing the
reins of power that he worked his whole life to grasp, no matter
how many brownie points he can score with the public, especially
women voters.
</P>
<P>
   The British public isn't of one mind on the matter, anyway. For
someone who gets accused of making policy with one eye on the polls
and one finger testing the prevailing winds of public opinion,
Blair is in a pickle.
</P>
<P>
   The opposition Conservatives and their cheerleaders in the
right-wing, anti-Blair press, led by the Daily Telegraph and Daily
Mail, are poised to pounce if Blair gives the slightest indication
he wants to become the New Age Dad of British politics.
</P>
<P>
   So far, Blair is keeping his options open. He acknowledges that
his wife wants him to take some time off, but as he put it, ``I
have got to make sure that the country is properly run, too. I have
got a country to run, and I think people would expect me to be
doing my job.''
</P>
<P>
   Speaking from a European Summit in Lisbon to the ITN television
network, Blair said, ``I'm going to have to sit down and discuss it
with the family first. That's the right place to start.''
</P>
<P>
   Some critics are gleefully suggesting part of the dilemma facing
Blair is that he and his spin doctors are terrified at the prospect
of leaving the day-to-day running of the country for any extended
period to John Prescott, the deputy prime minister.
</P>
<P>
   While a competent administrator, Prescott has a habit of, as the
British say, making a bottle of things.
</P>
<P>
   Prescott is in charge of transportation, and a central plank of
the Labor Party is to encourage drivers to leave their cars at home
and use public transportation. Imagine the guffaws then when, after
announcing that policy at Parliament two years ago, Prescott left
Westminster in a chauffeur-driven Jaguar. He added to his legend
last year when he and his wife were chauffeured all of 300 yards
from their hotel to the hall where the Labor Party was holding its
annual conference.
</P>
<P>
   Blair said his hesitation has nothing to do with his confidence
in Prescott.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not a lack of confidence in anyone. I just haven't made
up my mind,'' he insisted.
</P>
<P>
   Blair told the BBC he needs more time to think about it.
</P>
<P>
   ``Of course I want to take some time with the baby when he or
she comes, but I honestly don't know what to do. I will have to
find a third way through,'' said Blair, lightheartedly referring to
his vaunted ``Third Way'' philosophy of merging social spending and
pro-business policy, which left-wing diehards abhor and
right-wingers complain he stole from them.
</P>
<P>
   While in Lisbon, Blair may feel the urge to give a dope slap to
his Finnish counterpart, Paavo Lipponen, who hasn't made things any
easier for Blair. Having just returned from his second paternity
leave, Lipponen has become the poster boy for Europeans who want
men to put family first.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Blair spoke approvingly of Lipponen recently, saying, ``I,
for one, am promoting the widespread adoption of his fine
example.''
</P>
<P>
   Those who know the resolute Mrs. Blair, who uses her maiden
name, Cherie Booth, in her work as a lawyer, say her praise of the
Finnish prime minister means this is a done deal and that her
husband will have to take at least part of his allotted 13 weeks.
</P>
<P>
   Female parliamentarians in the Labor Party, who once called
themselves ``Blair's Babes,'' say the imminent arrival of the new
Blair babe, who will be the first child born to a sitting prime
minister in some 150 years, will help them in their campaign to get
Blair to push for paid paternity leave.
</P>
<P>
   Business leaders are appalled at that prospect, and Blair's
political enemies will make considerable hay if he betrays even the
slightest sympathy for it.
</P>
<P>
   As he ponders the next two months, Tony Blair may be forgiven
for asking why someone once dubbed all this ``the blessed event.''

ROBERT RAY: STARR'S SUCCESSOR COULD BE EVEN MORE OF A MATCH FOR
CLINTONS

<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Kenneth Starr's replacement, the man with the power
to prosecute the president after he leaves office _ and,
potentially, to affect the outcome of a close U.S. Senate race in
New York _ goes about his business here in almost perfect
anonymity.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think I've been noticed yet,'' says Robert Ray, the
39-year-old career prosecutor who took over as independent counsel
last October and appeared on national television for the first time
this week.
</P>
<P>
   Every evening, he commutes to his parents' house in the Virginia
suburbs, where he has been bunking back in his old room for the
last five years. On weekends, he takes the train home to his wife
and three children in New Jersey.
</P>
<P>
   While Starr used to receive boxes of letters _ several thousand
every week _ Ray typically gets just three or four, and answers
them himself. But though America has moved on, Ray is just getting
started. And it is Starr's unfamous, unassuming junior successor
who not only seems to understand the politics of prosecution in a
way Starr never did, but also shows signs that he could become a
more even match for the president than the widely reviled Starr.
</P>
<P>
   In an interview in his office this week, Ray did not come off as
particularly zealous. ``Somebody has to do this,'' he said when
first asked about his job. He also said, ``It's time to bring this
to closure.''
</P>
<P>
   At one point he left the impression that he might like to run
for political office himself someday, a rather remarkable
suggestion from someone in his position and surely a hopeful sign
for the Clintons. After Starr's experience, one would not have to
be a Princeton history major, as Ray was, to conclude that
indicting Bill Clinton might not be a launching pad to a career in
public service.
</P>
<P>
   Yet Ray, the eldest son of a former Carmelite nun, Peggy, and a
retired Army colonel, Robert, also spoke of his work as a duty, a
reason to make certain personal sacrifices and as a service to his
country with a seriousness that might just as reasonably give
President Clinton and his wife, Hillary, goose bumps. And the new
independent counsel made absolutely clear that he had in no way
ruled out prosecuting the president after he left office, in
connection with the same issues that led to his impeachment last
year.
</P>
<P>
   ``The process has to be vindicated,'' Ray said, adding that he
means by that that ``no person is above the law.''
</P>
<P>
   ``That issue has been raised since the beginning of the
Republic,'' he said, ``such as during the Civil War over whether
Lincoln acted over and above the law in suspending habeas corpus.
</P>
<P>
   ``Suppose President Nixon had decided he didn't have to deliver
the tapes,'' he said. ``There's a basic question about whether the
criminal justice system will be allowed to work, and principles
don't get protected in a vacuum.''
</P>
<P>
   Which, like much of what Ray said in the interview, might or
might not be taken to mean that he intends to go beyond what even
Starr apparently thought appropriate. Starr reportedly did not
believe that the president, having been impeached, should be
prosecuted after leaving office, and it is Ray who has reopened the
question.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, he released the first of three final reports on
various investigations involving the Clintons that have gone on for
more than five years and cost upwards of $50 million.
</P>
<P>
   Now, having cleared the Clinton White House of any illegality in
the improper acquisition of some 900 FBI files, Ray continues to
oversee investigations into two more matters involving Clinton: the
Arkansas land deals known as Whitewater and accusations of abuse of
power in the firing of some longtime employees of the White House
travel office.
</P>
<P>
   Reports on these issues are due this summer. Both also involve
Mrs. Clinton, as she campaigns for the Senate against New York City
Mayor Rudolph Giuliani of New York. It was Giuliani, as U.S.
attorney in Manhattan, who gave Ray his first real job, as a
federal prosecutor, though Giuliani left the office before Ray ever
went to work.
</P>
<P>
   Every time Ray spoke of justice in the almost 90-minute
interview, he also mentioned fairness, and he seemed to take a
swipe at his predecessor when he said, ``We all know what the
consequences are of the improper use of power.''
</P>
<P>
   But he would not say directly what he thought of the job Starr
had done.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's not really for me to say,'' Ray said. ``That's for
history.''
</P>
<P>
   And though he has signaled that he had learned from Starr's
mistakes, especially in public relations, he does seem to have
adopted Starr's determination to flout public opinion as he sees
fit.
</P>
<P>
   Recently, Ray not only began expanding an office that most
people thought was already packing up, but also plucked one of his
two new staff members from the politically charged committee run by
Rep. Dan Burton, R-Ind., one of Clinton's most aggressive critics.
</P>
<P>
   Does Ray care how that looks? ``Sure, those things are
factors,'' he said, ``but it's more important for me to have people
with experience with the issues I'm dealing with, and I don't think
it's a bad thing to have people with some political experience.''
</P>
<P>
   When he feels overwhelmed by the size of his responsibilities,
Ray said, he finds it helpful to think of his father's experience
in Vietnam, where he served two tours of duty and nearly died after
his plane crashed into a mountainside.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was a sense of service to it,'' he said, ``that affects
me today. And I always think, `Don't panic; It's nothing like
combat. Relax.'''
</P>
<P>
   Physically compact, temperamentally careful and very earnest,
Ray comes across a little like the boy every mother in the parish
secretly hoped her daughter would grow up and marry.
</P>
<P>
   He spent six years putting away drug dealers and organized crime
figures as a federal prosecutor in New York, and had a reputation
for toughness. A couple of times, judges dressed him down for what
they considered cowboy tactics in the courtroom.
</P>
<P>
   Ray did not become a prosecutor because he enjoyed the thrill of
legal research. ``I wanted to try cases; I love the excitement of a
trial, I love being before a jury,'' he said, becoming much more
animated at the mere thought of courtroom action.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Again, though, he tempered that remark by following it with a
comment about how much he liked to finish one case and move on to
the next. ``The task you're given has a beginning, a middle and an
end. That's my attention span,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   His politics are also hard to pin down. He made two
unsuccessful, nonpartisan runs for the local school board in
Brooklyn, in 1993 and 1996, as an opponent of the ``Rainbow
Curriculum,'' best known for its connection to the book ``Heather
Has Two Mommies.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I had a child in second grade that was going to be exposed to
material I didn't feel was appropriate,'' Ray said.
</P>
<P>
   Though his side lost that battle at the ballot box, he said his
concerns were later taken into account. ``It's funny how life works
out,'' he added.
</P>
<P>
   Despite his involvement in the board battle with the
``children's slate,'' a group generally aligned with social
conservatives, Ray was a registered Democrat until recently. Now he
is an independent, he says, because ``appearances count.''
</P>
<P>
   At Princeton, to which he had applied in emulation of his
boyhood role model, Bill Bradley, he wrote an admiring senior
thesis on John F. Kennedy and the Peace Corps. In a recent article
in an alumni publication, one of Ray's college roommates remembered
him as a ``Kennedy-worshiping liberal Democrat.''
</P>
<P>
   Ray speaks with great pride about his grandmother, Rose Ray,
whom he describes as a local Democratic Party leader _ ``kind of a
power broker''_ in Brooklyn in the 1930s.
</P>
<P>
   And asked if he saw himself running for office again at some
point, he smiled and did not say no.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think I better stay out of that for now,'' he replied. ``I
thought it was a great experience.''
</P>
<P>
   While Giuliani interviewed Ray and hired him 1989, he says
Giuliani's race with Mrs. Clinton has nothing to do with him. But
as he also said: ``You can pretend you live in a political vacuum,
but life is not that way. Pretending things don't exist is not good
judgment. Nobody said this was going to be easy.''
</P>
<P>
   Ray was born in Frankfurt, West Germany, where his father was
stationed, and his father's military career took him away from home
for years at a time. Ray's wife, Kristen, comes from a military
family, too. And Ray said that was the way they saw his service in
Washington _ where he thought he was assigned temporarily five
years ago, when he came here to handle trial work for Donald C.
Smaltz, the special prosecutor investigating Mike Espy, Clinton's
first secretary of agriculture, who was acquitted on all charges.
</P>
<P>
   Every Friday night, Ray takes a three-hour train ride back to
New Jersey, where the family moved from Brooklyn two years ago, and
spends Saturday shuttling his children, ages 10, 12 and 14, to ball
practice and the Boy Scouts while his wife, who works retail six
days a week, is selling glassware.
</P>
<P>
   (The only positive in this arrangement, he says, is that he has
time to catch up on his reading, though his favorite writer now is
still the same today as when he was in high school, John
Steinbeck.)
</P>
<P>
   Showing less ego than may be common among big-deal prosecutors,
Ray told how he and his future wife first got together, when both
were students at Jefferson High School in Alexandria, Va.: ``She
made me a cake for my birthday when I was a junior, and the rest is
history. Her great line was, `Would you like a cake?' I said, Yes
and put it in my locker. My mother said, `You idiot! What did she
give you with the cake?' I said, `Oh, two forks. I guess she wanted
to have some with me.'''
</P>
<P>
   Though sources in his office have indicated that they hope to
issue the two outstanding reports on the Clintons by this fall and
announce whether to indict the president as soon as possible after
he leaves office, Ray says he sees himself ``working in some
cubbyhole long after the public part of this is over.''
</P>
<P>
   He seems confident that both he and the Republic will survive
the final chapter of the investigation.
</P>
<P>
   ``Are people worried about me?'' he asked. ``Yeah. Am I worried
about myself? Sure. But it's important we get it right, and that's
why I'm here.''

<P>
   ``No child in America should be segregated by low expectations,
imprisoned by illiteracy, abandoned to frustration and the darkness
of self-doubt.
</P>
<P>
   ``But there is reason for optimism. A great movement of
education reform has begun in this country. The principles behind
it are the same from New York to Texas, from Florida to Arizona.
Raise the bar of standards. Give schools the flexibility to meet
them. Measure progress. Insist on results. Blow the whistle on
failure. Provide parents with options to increase their influence.
And don't leave any child behind.
</P>
<P>
   ``I believe in these principles. I have seen them turn around
troubled schools in my state. I've seen them bring hope into the
lives of children _ inspiring confidence and ambition...
</P>
<P>
   ``In my administration, we will have minimal regulation and high
standards. We will have local control, with one national goal:
excellence for every child.
</P>
<P>
   ``Forty-three years ago, the right of nine students to a good
and equal education was something worth fighting for. Worth the
full attention of the president of the United States. Worth the
full exercise of his power. Worth a thousand troops on the grounds
of this building. President Eisenhower acted decisively to remove
what he called `a blot upon the fair name and high honor of our
nation.'
</P>
<P>
   ``Public education, and the opportunity it creates, are still
worth fighting for. Still worth the full attention of a
president...
</P>
<P>
   ``A president does not bear responsibility for every policy in
every school in every district. But a president must be the keeper
of our common ideals. A president speaks for everyone. Not just for
schools and those who run them. Not for one interest or ethnic
group over another.''

<P>
   A prominent member of the conservative Muslim clergy warned
reformers who won a landslide victory in February elections not to
try to ease Islamic social taboos. ``It is not like the new
deputies can pass any laws they like,'' Ayatollah Mohammed Yazdi
said in a sermon at Tehran University. ``The young people who you
think voted for you have no right to demand laws to allow them to
dance in the streets, or the annulment of any Islamic mandates.''

   The police continued to defy a court order requiring them to

The police said they needed specific instructions from the
government before moving against the squatters, who are led by
veterans of Zimbabwe's war of independence from Britain. President
Robert Mugabe has spoken out in support of the squatters.

   No Hoop, but Net Is Crucial For This Tournament Champ &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The NCAA crowns its basketball champion next week, but the
powers that be in venture capital have pronounced the University of
California at Irvine the victor in a business-plan competition
among college and graduate school entrepreneurs, a competition
worth $5 million to the winning company.
</P>
<P>
   In a contest it called February Madness, executives of Hummer
Winblad Venture Partners, including a founding partner, Ann
Winblad, compared business plans from 64 schools, then took
meetings with the ``Sweet 16.'' Their investment went to
MyDrugRep.com.
</P>
<P>
   Quang X. Pham, the company's founder, intends to use the
Internet to make drug marketing more efficient. Instead of having
representatives go door to door trying to meet with harried
doctors, he plans to offer a Web site where doctors can learn about
new and existing drugs, order samples, and read sales information.
The Web site will make commissions on the drug sales it generates.
``This replaces the whole sales channel over time,'' Winblad said.
``It'll be a bits-driven business versus a knock-on-the-door
business.''
</P>
<P>
   Knocking on doctors' doors is something Pham knows about as a
former representative of Genentech and Merck. Pham, 35, left
Genentech last year to attend the executive MBA program at the
University of California at Irvine Graduate School of Management.
</P>
<P>
   Winblad predicted that in this tournament, there would in a
sense be 5 or 10 winners, all likely to eventually receive
financing from venture capital firms.

   Of the Future of Mice and Music &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Strauss Zelnick, chief executive of BMG Entertainment, came to
Silicon Alley recently to boast that his business had nothing to
fear from the World Wide Web. His speech, ``How a Major Music
Company is Aggressively Embracing the Net and Expects to Win the
Digital Wars,'' came amid reports that the Napster software was
making free downloads of music easier than ever.
</P>
<P>
   As a book collector, Zelnick explained, he would not want just a
photocopy of a classic. He is confident that his customers will
feel the same.
</P>
<P>
   By Christmas, paying customers will be able to download music at
www.bmg.com, he told the New York InfoTech Forum. ``This revolution
is a good thing for BMG music,'' he said. ``It's wrongheaded to
characterize the Internet as a threat.''
</P>
<P>
   Thousands of students, meanwhile, are voting against him, with
their mice. Geoff C. Gardner, a physics major at Purdue University,
has used Napster to install more than 500 songs on his computer,
and hasn't bought a CD in more than five months, saving hundreds of
dollars.
</P>
<P>
   Zelnick's response? ``There is no question that Napster is a
wholesale copyright violation, pure and simple. It can't be
allowed.''
</P>
<P>
   But if that's the law, how to enforce it? ``It's like
jaywalking,'' Gardner said. ``Everybody does it.''

clients whose needs range from checking utility lines after
earthquakes to tracking elk migration.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's really cool stuff,'' he said. Even cooler is that because
of his serendipitous affiliation with Roots for Peace, a group of
California vintners working to remove land mines, Rus is also
refining the software into a humanitarian tool.
</P>
<P>
   This month, Croatian minesweepers are using the donated software
to pinpoint mines in the town of Dragalic, in a field that children
traverse as a shortcut to school. United Nations officials, whom
Rus met in Croatia in January, believe that the software can speed
up land-mine removal there and in other countries. More than 1,000
people in Croatia have been killed or maimed by mines since
hostilities ceased in 1999.

Our rating: 1{ stars 
By DAVID KRONKE 
c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Should Jennifer Love Hewitt's phenomenal career turn out to be
enduring, in the distant future she'll refer, with the appropriate
desultory chuckle, to this past year as ``a learning experience.''
Among the lessons: Don't believe it when your small circle of
sycophants insists that you're a one-woman entertainment industry.
Don't leave a successful show for a spin-off with no discernible
idea propelling it (e.g., the tank job ``Time of Your Life''), even
if you're offered an executive producer's credit. And never, ever
believe you can play a beloved pop-culture icon just because you
think she's kinda cool.
</P>
<P>
   There are plenty of other lessons _ among them, if you're trying
an accent, hire a competent dialect coach _ but they're hardly
worth wading through, pretty much like Hewitt's latest project, the
arduously protracted telebiopic ``The Audrey Hepburn Story.'' It's
not as godawful as early rumors suggested, but it sure could've
done with an editor capable of shaving an hour out of this
three-hour leviathan.
</P>
<P>
   Hewitt assumes the title role (as well as a co-executive
producer's credit _ warning!), one in which she is thoroughly
miscast. Hepburn carried herself with legendarily elegant feline
grace, never showing the slightest hint of perspiration even when
doing broad comedy (though she was plenty skittish off-camera);
Hewitt skitters about like a frantic puppy who'd be adorable if it
would just !ital!quit hopping up and down in your face.
</P>
<P>
   Hepburn had luminous, saucer-like eyes; one of Hewitt's more
charming moves is scrunching her eyes up so that they're tiny but
gleaming _ when she goes for the wide-eyed effect, she looks as
though she's picking up radio waves from distant worlds; to depict
cool refinement, the actress simply goes blank.
</P>
<P>
   Hewitt plays this young woman born into aristocracy about as
you'd expect from someone who recorded a pop song titled ``Let's Go
Bang'' in her midteens. The filmmakers' way of coping with the fact
that Hewitt and Hepburn don't exactly appear separated at birth is
to cast the roles of Gregory Peck, Humphrey Bogart and William
Holden with performers who don't look remotely like their
characters, either.
</P>
<P>
   The film's hackneyed framing sequence begins on the set of
``Breakfast at Tiffany's,'' only because the filmmakers must've
decided that's the one Hepburn film everyone has heard of. Truman
Capote (imagine Philip Seymour Hoffman imitating Jerry Lewis) is on
the set sniffing at her abilities, and though everyone else, of
course, is utterly charmed, Hepburn decides she must win over
Capote, as well.
</P>
<P>
   Cut, at random, to cheering fans, which inspires a series of
flashbacks to her past life, for no other reason except that's how
these movies work. Heaven forbid that Hepburn would've been
concentrating on her !ital!work on the set of a film that earned
her an Oscar nomination, so obviously she has plenty of time for
lurid navel-gazing _ heck, she even has time to remember a
flashback within the context of another flashback.
</P>
<P>
   Her father was a Nazi sympathizer, but she herself is part of
the resistance movement in Holland (though her first question as
German tanks rumble down her street is a pouty, ``What about my
ballet lessons?''). Pop abandons the family, leaving mom (Frances
Fisher) to fend for herself.
</P>
<P>
   Eventually comes the numbingly dull, peripatetic trek through
Hepburn's career and a fairly sanitized depiction of her personal
life. Men say such things as, ``It is useless for you to try not to
be seen _ you are too beautiful'' and ``Audiences love her _ so do
I.'' As her husband Mel Ferrer, Eric McCormack (Will on ``Will &AMP;
Grace'') is the one actor around who handles his role without
looking utterly at sea. The one vaguely alarming moment in her
career _ she's thrown from a horse while shooting a film _ is
depicted here merely as a radio news item, but there's a long
play-dress-up sequence.
</P>
<P>
   For a three-hour movie, a heck of a lot is omitted.
Thoughtfully, her Oscar win (for ``Roman Holiday'') is mentioned,
but her other four nominations are ignored, as is her Tony win. The
last 30 years of her life, when Hepburn had the bad taste to grow
old and, therefore, not of interest to Hewitt's fans or ABC's
target demographic, are dismissed with a couple of title cards. Her
years of work for UNICEF _ in which she was often plunged into
danger (which, memo to the filmmakers, is a good thing when making
a drama) in Third World countries _ is similarly, and shockingly,
shrugged off. On the upside, we're spared the spectacle of Hewitt
in old-age makeup.
</P>
<P>
   Oh, and obviously, by film's end, Hepburn indeed wins over
Capote. The viewing audience _ well, that likely will be another
story. &QL; 
________ &QL; 
The show: ``The Audrey Hepburn Story.'' &QL; 
What: Hollywood biopic. &QL;

COMMENTARY: STEPHEN KING'S WEEK OF TERROR 
</HEADLINE>
  (jt) 
 By FRANK RICH    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   It took Al Jolson in blackface in ``The Jazz Singer'' to
persuade America that talking pictures were no passing fad. It took
Uncle Miltie in drag for the TV set to usurp radio in the nation's
living rooms. Is Stephen King's ``Riding the Bullet,'' the first
hit book distributed exclusively through the Internet, speeding the
end of the Gutenberg age and the dawn of a fully digitalized
cultural world?
</P>
<P>
   Even before the King e-book was so much as announced, Microsoft
had bet on the death of paper. In lavish ads heralding its new
``book-like'' device, Microsoft Reader, it touts ``the best
estimates of Microsoft researchers and developers'' about the
post-print future: E-books will start outselling printed books in
2009; newspapers will abandon paper editions in 2018; Webster's
will alter its first definition of ``book'' to refer to writing
read on a screen by 2020. Jack Romanos, the CEO of Simon &AMP;
Schuster, King's publisher, likens the fallout of ``Riding the
Bullet'' to the invention of the paperback in the 1930s. ``What
shocks me,'' he says, ``is the number of people who are willing to
read for entertainment on screen.''
</P>
<P>
   Time magazine's cover take on the King phenomenon this week sees
an even broader canvas for e-culture: the Net is becoming a
``global talent show'' in which any amateur novelist, musician or
filmmaker can take to the Internet to ``get discovered and attain
stardom.'' Were this actually true, it's a prescription either for
the greatest democratization of the arts in history (Time's view)
or a dumbing down that may make the advent of public-access cable
TV look in retrospect like the Renaissance.
</P>
<P>
   In my informal sampling of futuristic prognostication, only Lyn
Blake of Amazon.com, a key player in her company's free
distribution of ``Riding the Bullet,'' tried to bring this latest
wave of Net hype back down to non-virtual earth, saying that she
sees no end in sight for the printed book. But Blake does note that
even Amazon, the shrewdest of Web retailers, completely
underestimated the demand for King's novella, with the result that
its famously prompt customer service record was blighted by a rare
snafu.
</P>
<P>
   If Amazon can't unfailingly read the Internet's future _ at
least as far as books are concerned _ why should anyone else try?
Maybe it's easier to take a pass and conclude that ``Riding the
Bullet'' is just a one-week wonder proving merely that people will
always clamor for a brand-name product that is (largely) given
away, especially if the book that must be read on screen is a scant
66 pages. After all, only eight months ago another brief (if not
brief enough) ghost story, ``The Blair Witch Project,'' was alleged
to revolutionize the movie biz, triggering an avalanche of hit
independent movies that would be promoted like wildfire by Internet
buzz. There hasn't been a repeat occurrence since.
</P>
<P>
   Yet if you look at ``Riding the Bullet'' in the context of all
the other sweeping changes in the cultural marketplace just since
New Year's, the future doesn't seem that foggy at all. The
prognosticators writing the ad copy at Microsoft, painful as it is
to concede, may be right. If books aren't abandoning their analog
containers for digital ones, they're about the only mainstream
media product that is not.
</P>
<P>
   Newspapers, facing an aging readership, not to mention the Net's
potential theft of their best brains and classified ad profits, are
running to the Web as fast as stockholders can carry them. In the
past couple of months, the country's top dailies have almost all
been leapfrogging onto an accelerated Internet track. The
multimedia-crazed Chicago Tribune is swallowing up the once
impregnable old-media lion The Los Angeles Times. The New York
Times has switched to continuous news on its Web site and is trying
a joint Webcast with ABC News. Donald Graham, publisher of The
Washington Post, has relinquished day-to-day operation of his paper
in part to focus on Internet strategy. In magazine publishing,
recent print issues of e-centered titles like Red Herring, Fast
Co., Business 2.0 and The Industry Standard have rivaled or
exceeded the daunting 470-page heft of Vanity Fair's Hollywood
issue. Even Harper's Bazaar, a magazine without a Web site, is
reduced to making up for lost Internet time by doing a ``wired''
print issue it hopes will pass for ``young.''
</P>
<P>
   A still speedier, and more revealing, indicator of the rapid
migration of mass media to the Web can be found in music. At
Christmas, few had heard of Napster, a free software program
invented by a 19-year-old college dropout that allows anyone with a
PC to trade music over the Internet (in easy-to-download MP3 files)
with every other Napster user at no cost. But as any parent of
teen-agers now knows, Napster has proliferated like a virus _ so
rapidly that kids are swapping entire CD collections on line and
overloading university computer networks, much as orders for
``Riding the Bullet'' crashed Net booksellers.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   The Wall Street Journal reported this week that Indiana
University (among many others) had to ban Napster upon discovering
that within weeks of catching on it was generating 60 percent of
all electronic traffic between the campus and the Internet. Alec
Foege, a People magazine writer who is doing a book on the
phenomenon, says that by summer panicked record labels will be
selling downloadable music directly on the Web, hoping to co-opt
Napster rather than merely pray that copyright litigation might
stamp out the wholesale pirating of their wares. Movie studios may
eventually have to bow as well: illegally bootlegged Hollywood
features are already circulating in the hackers' underground and
would be ubiquitous were gargantuan video digital files not too
cumbersome for all but the fastest Internet connections.
</P>
<P>
   What makes the culture of Napster pertinent to the future of
print is not just the velocity of its acceptance but the ease with
which its enthusiasts have broken their supposedly entrenched
listening habits, ditching CD's for a less tangible medium. It's
one thing if teen-agers abandon newspapers, not a strong habit
among the young to start with, for Web news sources. But weren't
teen-agers said to be as enamored of the CD as an object as they
were of its music?
</P>
<P>
   Now it turns out they can do very well without the packaging,
cover art and liner notes. Writing in the online magazine Feed,
Julian Dibbell, a former rock critic, describes how easy it was to
overcome years of CD fetishism to embrace instead the same
collection in the form of a ``weightless, borderless cloud of
data'' residing on his computer's hard disk. Wouldn't it be as easy
to abandon the physical object of the book if it can be recast in a
weightless vehicle that is handier and more visually commodious
than the current, early e-books, which make reading even the
relatively short ``Riding the Bullet'' such an eye-straining chore?
</P>
<P>
   Laurence Kirshbaum, who runs trade publishing at Time Warner,
says that the book business faces an aging audience just as
newspapers do, and, like newspapers, must hunt down new customers
wherever it can. ``To get the kids and get the readers of the
future, we've got to go to the space they're in,'' he says, and
that space could be any number of non-paper venues _ not just
e-books, Palm Pilots or computer screens but video game consoles,
now frequented by young audiences more than movie theaters, let
alone libraries.
</P>
<P>
   Where does that leave those of us who still love bindings, crisp
paper and dust jackets? Books will not go the way of eight-track
tapes as long as there are still people around who were raised on
them. That's a large market to be serviced and one that still
includes many, if not most, current teen-agers. But as the
cybernovelist Bruce Sterling put it while speaking at this month's
South by Southwest Interactive Festival in Austin, Texas, a
3-year-old child today finds the computer ``as banal as a fork or
running water.'' Such a child may well grow up on pixels, not
paper, and by the time he or she enters junior high school and
starts consuming books in large volume, it will be 2009 _ the very
year, according to the seers at Microsoft, that electronic books
will overtake print as the reading medium of choice.
</P>
<P>
   None of this means that such a kid will read Stephen King to the
exclusion of Dickens. The child who grows up with the Internet may
well imbibe a more heterogeneous cultural mix than my generation,
the often-passive patsies of three look-alike TV networks. Either
way, what is certain is that sentimental sermons by us old print
fogies aren't going to turn back the clock.

   TV-HEPBURN (Undated) _ It's almost impossible to visualize the
finespun Audrey Hepburn while gazing upon the robust Jennifer Love
Hewitt. Camera tricks and acres of fabric can only do so much.
Moreover, Hewitt's spirited attempt to capture Hepburn's accent, a
challenging mix of English, Dutch and Belgian, is a persistent
obstacle to thoroughly enjoying ``The Audrey Hepburn Story,'' which
airs Monday on ABC. And yet ... And yet ... It's not so bad.

A CASE OF SLIPPING STANDARDS?
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JON WILNER  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUBURN HILLS, Mich. _ There were terrible losses and impressive
victories. There was an NCAA investigation and an academic
suspension. The coaches were vilified and glorified. The players
were awesome and awful, dominant and dormant, sometimes from one
minute to the next. There was a February funk and a March charge.
</P>
<P>
   Yes, it was one of the strangest UCLA seasons in memory, and for
that reason it was not strange at all.
</P>
<P>
   Under fourth-year coach Steve Lavin _ but not always because of
him _ the Bruins have turned tumult into routine. They are
consistently chaotic. Names and events change, but turmoil
persists. Some years,it's drug-related suspensions. Some years,
it's injuries. Some years, it's NCAA violations.
</P>
<P>
   This year, it was the fall-quarter academic suspension of Matt
Barnes and the 24-game NCAA suspension of JaRon Rush. It was the
29-point loss at Arizona State and the overtime victory at
Stanford. It was six losses in seven games followed by an
eight-game winning streak.
</P>
<P>
   But remove the names and events, and the bottom line is a UCLA
team with four high school All-Americans and several future pros
won 21 games, lost 12, finished fourth in the Pac-10 and reached
the Sweet 16 of the NCAA Tournament. That is not cause for alarm;
nor is it cause for celebration. It's very, very . . . solid.
</P>
<P>
   No matter how the Bruins spin it _ and there's nothing they do
better than spin _ it's nothing more than solid.
</P>
<P>
   ``Coach Lavin said he was proud of us and I'm proud of us,
too,'' junior forward and co-captain Rico Hines said. ``Everybody
counted us out. Nobody thought we'd make the Sweet 16. Everyone
thought we'd be in the NIT. We pulled together when we could have
thrown in the towel.''
</P>
<P>
   All true, or course. But what the Bruins fail to mention is that
everything good about the season was rooted in something bad.
</P>
<P>
   They were thrilled with their late-season turnaround, but they
shouldn't have been in that position (13-11 after the Arizona
roadtrip) in the first place.
</P>
<P>
   They were pleased with the intensity and efficiency of their
practices in the final month, but the workouts should have been
like that all along. It was as if they were shamed into practicing
better.
</P>
<P>
   Lavin called this his most rewarding season and mentioned
several memorable victories: North Carolina, Purdue, USC, Stanford
and Maryland. But those look good only when compared to
embarrassing losses to Colorado State, Washington, Oregon, USC and
Arizona State. And since when does a home victory over USC qualify
as significant? Either the standards are declining or the
competition's closing, or both.
</P>
<P>
   Lavin also was pleased with the late-season development of
center Dan Gadzuric and point guard Earl Watson, and rightly so.
But neither player should have been as confused or ineffective as
he was early in the season.
</P>
<P>
   Even their demise was self-inflicted. A day after the 80-56 loss
to Iowa State in the Sweet 16, Watson and Lavin talked about being
emotionally drained. ``We played the NCAA Tournament two times,''
Lavin said. ``To get in the NCAA Tournament, we had to win six
consecutive, Russian-roulette games.''
</P>
<P>
   The reason for that predicament: six losses in seven games.
</P>
<P>
   School officials believe Rush's suspension cost UCLA victories
over Colorado State, Washington and Cal. But the Bruins didn't need
Rush to beat Washington. They simply needed better fundamentals,
better judgment, better preparation and better execution. If Lavin
had run January practices with the urgency and efficiency he ran
March practices, the Bruins would have coasted into the tournament.
</P>
<P>
   ``The coaches and players are aware of what we have to do
starting Oct. 15,'' Watson said. ``We'll just start where we left
off.''
</P>
<P>
   The good news for UCLA fans is the last month showed the
coaching staff is capable. The bad news is it took until the last
month.
</P>
<P>
   What does the future hold? It looks a lot like the present.
</P>
<P>
   Since Lavin took over in 1997, the win total has steadily
declined: 24, 24, 22, 21. The Pac-10 win total has dropped: 15, 12,
12, 10. Pac-10 placement has plummeted, as well: first, third,
third, fourth.
</P>
<P>
   There is no need to panic. The Bruins will continue to recruit
talented players and provide reasonably good coaching. They will
play a difficult schedule and send players to the NBA. They will
win 18-22 games a year, challenge for an occasional Pac-10 title
and make the Sweet 16 every few years.
</P>
<P>
   But unless the coaching staff improves dramatically _ or changes
are made _ the Bruins will not average 25 wins a year like Arizona
and Kentucky and Duke and Kansas. They will not win the Pac-10
title every two or three seasons, and they will not be a consistent
Final Four threat.
</P>
<P>
   In that respect, the Bruins have become wholly consistent. They
are consistently good, with a flash of greatness here and a dash of
ineptitude there.
</P>
<P>
   The question the coaches and administration must answer is this:
Is consistently good good enough?

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Anti-gay attitudes and harassment are commonplace
in the U.S. military, especially in the form of offensive remarks
and gestures, and an overwhelming majority of service members
believe their superiors and colleagues tolerate it ``to some
extent,'' according to a Pentagon survey released Friday.
</P>
<P>
   The survey, ordered after a gay soldier was beaten to death last
July at Fort Campbell, Ky., suggested that despite repeated efforts
to prohibit such behavior, including new directives by the four
armed services late last year, disparaging and even hostile
attitudes toward gay men and women remain a pervasive part of
military culture.
</P>
<P>
   Eighty percent of service members questioned by the Pentagon's
inspector general reported hearing anti-gay remarks during the last
year, and 33 percent said they heard them often or very often.
</P>
<P>
   Even more troubling to Pentagon officials, 37 percent said they
had witnessed or experienced some form of harassment based on
sexual orientation in the last year. Often the harassment involved
offensive remarks or gestures, but in more than half of those
cases, service members said they had witnessed or experienced that
harassment in the form of graffiti, vandalism, threats, unfair
discipline, discrimination in training or career opportunities or
even physical assaults.
</P>
<P>
   ``The report shows that military leaders must do more to make it
clear that harassment based on sexual orientation violates military
values,'' Secretary of Defense William Cohen wrote in a memorandum
sent to the civilian and military leaders of the services Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Investigators surveyed a random sampling of 71,570 officers and
enlisted personnel at 38 military bases and aboard 11 warships and
submarines in the United States and overseas. The survey did not
question people at Fort Campbell, where Pfc. Barry Winchell was
bludgeoned to death last July with a baseball bat. The Army's
inspector general is conducting a separate investigation into why
commanders there ignored reports that soldiers had openly taunted
Winchell about his presumed sexual orientation for months.
</P>
<P>
   The survey's findings surprised many senior officials at the
Pentagon, who had publicly played down the extent of harassment
only a few months ago. Scrambling to respond, Cohen appointed a
committee of civilian and military officials to review the
findings.
</P>
<P>
   Cohen ordered the committee, which will be headed by the under
secretary of the Air Force, Carol DiBattiste, to report back to him
by the end of July with plans for dealing with what the Pentagon's
spokesman, Kenneth H. Bacon, acknowledged was ``a disturbing
amount'' of harassment in the ranks.
</P>
<P>
   The survey's findings have focused new attention on the Clinton
administration's ``don't ask, don't tell'' policy, which Congress
put into law in 1993 after a fierce political battle. The policy
allows gay men and women to serve in the military as long as they
keep their sexual orientation to themselves and do not engage in
homosexual acts, but still bars openly gay people from serving in
uniform. Although meant to make it easier for gays to serve,
thousands have been discharged in recent years.
</P>
<P>
   The findings are also sure to intensify the political debate
over homosexuality and the military, which Vice President Al Gore
has already made an issue in this year's presidential campaign by
vowing to allow gay men and women to serve openly. Gov. George W.
Bush, his Republican opponent, has expressed support for the
existing policy.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Gore's national security adviser, Leon S. Fuerth, said this week
that society's views had evolved and that gay men and women now
deserved the chance to serve their country openly.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're in a posture that makes it impossible for very good
people to serve without living in fear that something private about
themselves will be divulged and held against them,'' Fuerth said in
an interview with reporters. ``In our society that is changing, and
our military has always been a reflection of the society as a
whole.''
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Cohen, in his memo Friday, said it was impossible to say whether
the survey's findings reflected larger social attitudes.
</P>
<P>
   Frank Rush, the deputy under secretary of defense for planning,
who announced the survey at the Pentagon Friday, cited the finding
that 80 percent of service members reported hearing anti-gay
remarks in the last year and added: ``There is nothing out there
that we have seen that says how often would you hear such jokes or
names, or other types of offensive speech, in the broader civilian
society.''
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, Cohen said that harassment ``seriously undermines
the good order and discipline that is critical to an effective
fighting force.'' And the survey suggested that good order and
discipline were under assault in units around the country and in
all the services.
</P>
<P>
   While 80 percent reported hearing ``offensive comments'' about
gays, even more _ 85 percent _ believed that the comments were
tolerated within their units.
</P>
<P>
   Even in more serious incidents, the survey's findings suggested
that anti-gay behavior appeared to be widely accepted, despite the
Pentagon's most recent directives, which explicitly prohibited
harassment based on sexual orientation, just as policy now
prohibits harassment based on race or gender.
</P>
<P>
   Of all respondents, 5 percent believed that harassment based on
sexual orientation was tolerated by superiors in the chain of
command and 10 percent said it was tolerated by colleagues in their
unit.
</P>
<P>
   When asked to describe in detail one incident of harassment, 22
percent said that a more senior person had also witnessed the
behavior, and in 73 percent of those cases, they said that person
did nothing immediately to stop it.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   The findings varied by service. In the Marine Corps, for
example, more than 45 percent of those questioned reported hearing
offensive comments often or very often, compared to only 23 percent
in the Air Force.
</P>
<P>
   Rush attributed the differences to differences in age, education
and training within the services. Marines, generally, tend to be
younger and less educated than personnel in the Air Force, which
requires greater technical expertise. Also, lower-ranking enlisted
personnel were far more likely to hear or witness anti-gay
attitudes than officers.
</P>
<P>
   While Pentagon officials expressed disappointment in the
findings and said more worked needed to be done, a spokesman for
the Marine Corps, Maj. David A. Lapan, played down the results. He
cited the finding that only 5 percent of those questioned believed
that harassment was tolerated by superiors and said the Marine
Corps had not experienced an increase in complaints of harassment.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not necessarily concerned with the results,'' Lapan
said, ``because we're not seeing indicators like increased
complaints of threats or mistreatment that would indicate the
policy is not working.''
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Rush and other officials pointed to one positive finding: About
78 percent of those questioned said they felt free to report
anti-gay harassment to their superiors without fear of retribution,
while 22 percent did not feel free to do so.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, however, the survey found that of those who
said they had seen or experienced harassment within the last year,
only 16 percent actually did report it to a superior.
</P>
<P>
   Advocates for gay men and women in the military seized on the
findings as validation of what they had been saying for years.
</P>
<P>
   David M. Smith, a spokesman for the Human Rights Campaign, the
largest gay political organization in Washington, said the findings
showed that repeated directives issued by the Pentagon had failed
to stop harassment.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nothing is going to change until the uniformed military
leadership, from the Joint Chiefs of Staff on down, send clear and
unambiguous signals that this type of harassment will not be
tolerated under any circumstances,'' he said. ``To date, we have
not heard those messages from the uniformed military leadership.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Earlier this month, the Servicemembers Legal Defense Network, a
legal-aid organization based in Washington, reported that anti-gay
harassment had more than doubled last year. The group reported 968
incidents of verbal abuse or physical assaults. The group also
reported that 1,034 gay men and women were discharged because of
their sexual orientation.
</P>
<P>
   C. Dixon Osborne, one of the group's executive directors, said
the findings released Friday were a direct result of the inherent
inequities in the ``don't ask, don't tell'' policy.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you have a law that treats an entire class of people as
second-class citizens,'' he said, ``it suggests that you can treat
them that way.''

OPEC TO MEET ON INCREASING OIL PRODUCTION 
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   VIENNA, Austria _ After watching oil prices triple over the last
year to their highest level since the Persian Gulf war, the
Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries is groping toward
agreement on a modest increase in production.
</P>
<P>
   But OPEC ministers preparing for a crucial meeting here Monday
still appeared divided Friday on the extent and timetable of any
production increases despite intense lobbying by the United States,
where soaring gasoline prices have created a political uproar.
</P>
<P>
   It is widely expected that OPEC ministers, who control about 40
percent of the world's oil supply, will agree to increase
production. But few outside experts think the increase will be big
enough to cause more than modest price reductions at the gasoline
pump.
</P>
<P>
   Officials from Saudi Arabia, the world's largest producer and
the most powerful OPEC member, have quietly endorsed the goal of
reducing oil prices to about $25 a barrel from its peak on March 8
of $34.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, OPEC production is already running more than 1 million
barrels a day over its stated limit of 23 million barrels, and most
experts believe the bulk of this extra oil is coming from Saudi
Arabia.
</P>
<P>
   Since March 8, the benchmark market price for oil has dropped
about 18 percent and as of Friday it was trading at about $28 a
barrel. Much of that reflects an expectation among oil traders that
OPEC will raise production by about 1.5 million barrels a day. It
also reflects an unofficial increase in production that has already
occurred.
</P>
<P>
   But even if oil does settle at about $25 a barrel, analysts say
that would probably knock only a few pennies off the price of
gasoline in the United States, where a gallon of unleaded regular
costs an average of $1.60.
</P>
<P>
   In the meantime, countries like Iran and Libya are still
fighting against a big production increase and their positions have
hardened in recent days.
</P>
<P>
   ``OPEC is divided,'' said Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono, Indonesia's
oil minister, to reporters in Jakarta on Friday. ``I think it's
going to be a heated debate during the meeting.''
</P>
<P>
   With oil officials already descending on Vienna's
Intercontinental Hotel on Friday, the stakes and the uncertainties
about Monday's meeting are high.
</P>
<P>
   ``The only thing we know is that OPEC is going to increase
production,'' said Peter Ginoux, who oversees petroleum trading at
Salomon Smith Barney in London. ``We don't know how much of an
increase. We don't know how it will be divided between countries
and we don't know the timing.''
</P>
<P>
   It was OPEC's surprisingly unified and disciplined decision to
cut daily production by 2.1 million barrels last March that sent
prices soaring and ignited protests from American drivers and
politicians.
</P>
<P>
   In the U.S. House of Representatives, lawmakers passed a largely
symbolic bill this past week that would require the Clinton
administration to determine whether OPEC nations are colluding to
fix prices, and to punish any deemed to be doing so. There is also
growing pressure on President Clinton to provide relief by selling
oil from the federal government's Strategic Petroleum Reserve.
</P>
<P>
   Bill Richardson, the secretary of energy, has waged an intensive
lobbying campaign with the leaders of oil-producing countries, and
spent much of this past week meeting with officials in Norway,
Nigeria, Algeria and the United Arab Emirates.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. officials have been pushing for an increase of as much as
2.5 million barrels a day, the amount that oil analysts believe is
necessary to stabilize prices at about $25 and allow oil companies
to rebuild their depleted reserves.
</P>
<P>
   Saudi officials are believed to support an increase of about 1.5
million barrels a day, and they appear to have support from
countries like Venezuela and Mexico. Though Mexico is not a member
of OPEC, it joined in last year's production cut and is a
formidable producer.
</P>
<P>
   But analysts say the real issue is not the nominal increase in
the amount that countries pledge to produce. More important is
whether those increases come on top of the current cheating on
restrictions.
</P>
<P>
   If oil-exporting countries increase their formal commitments by
2 million barrels a day but eliminate the roughly 1 million barrels
a day in noncompliance, the net increase would be only about 1
million barrels and its market impact would be limited.
</P>
<P>
   ``The biggest question is how they handle compliance,'' said
Gary N. Ross, chief executive of PIRA Energy Group, a petroleum
industry consulting firm. ``How much do they raise the pledge
volume, and does noncompliance come down as a result?''
</P>
<P>
   Robert Priddle, executive director of the International Energy
Agency, a Paris-based research group, estimated that world output
would need to increase by 500,000 to 1 million barrels a day just
to bring supply back in line with demand.
</P>
<P>
   Oil producers are understandably anxious, having experienced
both an unnerving plunge in prices and an almost equally unexpected
ricochet back up _ all in the last two years.
</P>
<P>
   The 1997-98 Asian financial crisis, which deeply depressed
demand for oil, and a Saudi decision to step up production helped
contribute to a supply glut in 1998 that pushed prices down to
about $11 a barrel, inflicting severe financial pain on OPEC
nations and other big exporters. Analysts estimate that the decline
cost OPEC nations $65 billion in revenue.
</P>
<P>
   The severity of that crisis finally imposed discipline on OPEC
nations, particularly chronic cheaters like Venezuela, and
persuaded non-OPEC producers like Mexico and Norway to join in with
production cuts last year.
</P>
<P>
   Now prices have shot up even more dramatically than they
declined two years ago, leaving consumers as well as producers
almost shell-shocked by the turbulence.
</P>
<P>
   ``They have never really been in this situation before,''
remarked Paul Horsnell, assistant director of the Oxford Institute
for Energy Studies in Oxford, England. ``This is the first time
they have ever had to add more than a million barrels a day on the
market in a coordinated way.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The last time prices shot up so much was during the Persian Gulf
war, when oil producers cranked up their output to compensate for
the cut-off from Iraq and Kuwait. But that case was simpler,
because all producers simply produced as much as they could.
</P>
<P>
   Iran's OPEC governor, Hossein Kazempour Ardebili, said on
Thursday he had become more skeptical about production increases in
the price retreat since the March 8 peak.
</P>
<P>
   ``Two weeks ago it may have been justified to call on OPEC to
increase production,'' Ardebili said. ``But now we have a different
situation in that during the past three to four days oil prices
have fallen by $4 to $5 and this is expected to continue.''
</P>
<P>
   Ross, of PIRA Energy Group, argued that OPEC has extraordinary
leverage at the moment because production growth has been slow in
non-OPEC areas and global economic growth is accelerating. A 1
percent increase in global economic growth increases oil demand by
an estimated 700,000 barrels a day.
</P>
<P>
   ``The momentum is with OPEC,'' said Ross.

UNMARRIED AND LIVING TOGETHER, TILL THE SHERIFF DO US PART 
</HEADLINE>
  (lh) 
 By JIM YARDLEY   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   PERALTA, N.M. _ Richard Pitcher and Kimberly Henry began their
courtship in January with a lunch that led to dinner that incited
three dizzy weeks and talk of marriage. But his second divorce was
still fresh, and her first marriage had been a disaster, so they
decided to try a road test of sorts. They moved in together.
</P>
<P>
   He cleaned out a dresser for her clothes, and she brought her
stereo and her books. Everything seemed to be progressing nicely
until the summons arrived in the mail charging them with violating
Article 30-10-2 of the New Mexico criminal code, otherwise known as
unlawful cohabitation. First offenders get a warning; repeat
offenders could spend six months in jail.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just couldn't believe it,'' Pitcher said. ``I was shocked.''
</P>
<P>
   In many places these days, living together carries less of a
moral stain than smoking, but in New Mexico it is against the law.
Few New Mexicans seem to realize this, and even fewer of the
state's law-enforcement officials have ever chosen to uphold the
statute, perhaps for lack of jail space. But one person familiar
with the law is Pitcher's second ex-wife, and in February she filed
a complaint.
</P>
<P>
   In New Mexico, the statute is a reminder that state legal codes
are like old attics: Almost anything can be in there, and cleaning
them out is never easy. In Oklahoma, for example, a person can be
sentenced to 30 days in jail for ``injuring'' fruit, melons or
flowers. In North Carolina, swearing remains prohibited in all 100
counties _ except two at opposite ends of the state, for balance.
</P>
<P>
   The National Conference of State Legislatures has no details on
how many states have laws against cohabitation, but there are at
least a few. In Arizona, the state Legislature rebuffed efforts
last month to repeal its own 80-year-old cohabitation law after a
committee chairman described it as a bulwark against the ``decaying
fabric of society.'' Massachusetts, on the other hand, chose to
risk decay. In 1987, it repealed its ban on ``lewdly and
lasciviously associating and cohabitating without the benefit of
marriage.'' The law had been on the books since 1784.
</P>
<P>
   These laws are often just statutory reminders of bygone eras
until, of course, a person is charged with breaking one. That
rarely happens since officials regard such laws as unenforceable.
About a decade ago, a sheriff in southern New Mexico announced
plans to enforce the cohabitation law, but an irritated citizenry
soon convinced him otherwise.
</P>
<P>
   Yet Charles E. Knoblauch, a lawyer representing Henry, noted
that private citizens in New Mexico have considerable latitude in
filing misdemeanor criminal charges. Under state law, a person need
only swear out a complaint with the police and pay a fee to charge
someone with a misdemeanor. No police investigation is required.
</P>
<P>
   ``For $25, you can make someone's life a living hell,''
Knoblauch said.
</P>
<P>
   He said New Mexico's code included one law prohibiting
improperly singing the state or national anthems in public while
another charges any registered members of the Communist Party with
a felony if they fail to register with the secretary of state.
</P>
<P>
   The case of Pitcher, 35, and Henry, 31, began in the middle of
February, after she moved into his white mobile home in this small
town about 20 miles south of Albuquerque. Pitcher and his former
wife, Vickie Jenkins Avants, had shared custody of their 5-year-old
daughter since their October divorce, but Henry's arrival roiled
Avants.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a morality issue,'' said Avants, 36. ``We're spending six
days a week trying to teach moral values, and the one day a week
she's with her dad, he's got that woman moved in.''
</P>
<P>
   Avants conceded that she herself was ``not perfect.'' In
January, she married for the fourth time, and she and Pitcher lived
together for six years before marrying. But after becoming a
born-again Christian, Avants said, she has sought to change her
life and provide the proper moral climate for her daughter. She
described Henry as a good person, but she did not seem likely to
retract her complaint.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a law on the books,'' she said. ``Whether they like it or
not, it's still a law.''
</P>
<P>
   Henry, who is director of social services at a nursing home,
said she and Pitcher plan to marry in June. They have a bedroom
decorated with stuffed animals for Pitcher's daughter, and they say
Avants should not be able to dictate how they live.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I get married, I take the vow very seriously,'' Henry said.
``I truly believe you don't really know someone until you get
thrown in together.''
</P>
<P>
   Besides, she said, if the police enforced the law, which was
enacted in 1963, ``the whole state would be in jail.''
</P>
<P>
   There are no official statistics on cohabitation, but enforcing
the law would probably require a new prison construction program.
In an editorial criticizing the failure of the Legislature to
remove such laws from the books, The Albuquerque Journal described
cohabitation as ``more common than speeding'' and said enforcing
the law ``would bankrupt the criminal justice system.'' The couple
will be arraigned before a local magistrate on April 4, and
Knoblauch and his co-counsel, William J. Cooley, plan to fight the
constitutionality of the law on the grounds of ``freedom of
association.''
</P>
<P>
   But such a legal fight may not be needed. Michael Runnels, the
local district attorney, said very few citizens filed criminal
complaints or were aware that they could. He called the
unlawful-cohabitation statute ``weird'' and predicted that his
office would find a legal avenue to dismiss the case.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can't have a 19th-century criminal code and have it
survive into the 21st century and have it make any sense,'' Runnels
said.
</P>
<P>
   Reached on his cell phone while ordering lunch, Runnels, who is
running for Congress, said he did not know how many unmarried
people lived together in his district, but he predicted that ``the
cohabitation vote'' would outnumber those in favor of the law.
</P>
<P>
   Asked if he or his lunch companions had ever violated the
statute, Runnels polled his table, which included a former district
judge, a former state senator and another elected official.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody's taking the Fifth,'' he said.

   DENVER _ He pushed hard for gun control measures, which failed,
and for educational reforms, which passed. But when Colorado's
legislative session has ended, the lasting impression of Gov. Bill
Owens, a first-term Republican, could be of a battle he fought
outside the House and Senate chambers.
</P>
<P>
   For reasons not entirely clear, Owens has injected himself into
the murder investigation of JonBenet Ramsey, the 6-year-old girl
who was found beaten and strangled in the basement of her home in
Boulder more than three years ago. While Boulder investigators
placed the girl's parents, John and Patsy Ramsey, under an
``umbrella of suspicion'' early on, Owens has made it clear that he
believed that the police were looking in the right direction to
solve the murder.
</P>
<P>
   In a news conference last October, he said the Ramseys should
stop hiding behind lawyers and advisers and return to Colorado from
their home in Atlanta to answer questions. The Ramseys, contending
an intruder killed their child, responded in their new book, ``The
Death of Innocence,'' criticizing Owens as acting on political
impulse alone.
</P>
<P>
   Owens shot back this week, repeating his call for the Ramseys to
face investigators and telling ABC's ``Good Morning America'' that
``the focus on this case is really on Patsy Ramsey.''
</P>
<P>
   No one else involved with the case has come so close publicly to
naming a possible suspect.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of people have been talking about it,'' state Sen.
Michael F. Feeley, a Democrat who is minority leader, said of
Owens' sparring with the Ramseys. ``It has been the subject of a
lot of discussion around here.''
</P>
<P>
   Since his appearance on ``Good Morning America,'' Owens has
declined to discuss the matter. His spokesman, Dick Wadhams, said
the governor challenged the Ramseys in October because his youngest
child, Brett, was born the same year as JonBenet, ``and as a father
of three kids, he felt very strongly that from day one the Ramseys
did nothing to cooperate with the authorities.''
</P>
<P>
   The Ramseys waited four months after the killing to meet with
investigators for an interview.
</P>
<P>
   The governor only returned to the subject of the Ramseys,
Wadhams said, because they devoted two pages of their book to
criticize him.
</P>
<P>
   Yet some in Colorado said Owens' comments about the Ramseys
reflected more political concerns than parental ones.
</P>
<P>
   Owens was presiding, after all, in a state where the worst
school shootings in American history happened last year. In the 11
months since 15 people died at Columbine High School, virtually
nothing has changed in Colorado. Almost all of Owens' gun control
initiatives, including requirements for background checks at gun
shows and a safe-storage law for guns kept in the home, died in the
Legislature at the hands of his own party, which controls both
chambers.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, however, statewide polls were showing that
most Colorado residents favored tighter gun control measures,
leading one group to begin a campaign to have the gun-show measure
turned into a ballot initiative in November. Owens said he would
support it.
</P>
<P>
   Whether it was a planned strategy or not, taking on the Ramseys
gave the governor a new _ and nonideological _ chance to flex
Colorado's criminal justice muscles even though a grand jury
completed 13 months of work last fall without indicting anyone in
the case.
</P>
<P>
   ``When he first said those thing about the Ramseys,'' Feeley
said, ``my first reaction was, How dare you? But I've changed my
thinking. He has met with investigators and prosecutors in the
case, and I believe he has been told that there is an awful lot of
evidence pointing to the Ramseys, but there are also holes to
create reasonable doubt. As a result, he is going after them the
only way he can, through the court of public opinion.''
</P>
<P>
   Feeley added: ``I believe he has read the public correctly on
this. After I blasted him for injecting himself in this the first
time, calls to my office ran against me 9 to 1. He had a pretty
good feel of this. I think it's been a political plus for him.''
</P>
<P>
   Rodney Hero, a professor of political science at the University
of Colorado, said Owens' willingness to express his views about the
Ramseys also provided ``a kind of easy national visibility, at the
same time raising some issues that are bothersome to many
Coloradans.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't see any political downside to it,'' Hero said. ``This
was a major crime. This is his way of saying we here in Colorado
have a sense of justice and what's happened so far is an offense to
our state and city.''
</P>
<P>
   While Owens has relinquished the floor on the Ramseys, his views
seemed likely to gain momentum soon.
</P>
<P>
   In a book to be released next month, ``JonBenet: Inside the
Ramsey Murder Investigation,'' Steve Thomas, a former Boulder
detective assigned to the case, has laid out his version of events,
rejecting the intruder theory and asserting that the Ramseys knew
more about what happened than they told police.
</P>
<P>
   ``Governor Owens is aware of a lot of the behind-the-scenes
issues in this case,'' Thomas said in an interview. ``I think he
shares our frustrations over the propaganda from the Ramseys, and
he has been offering some bottom-line comments, making it clear
that their version of events does not stand alone as the last word.
I happen to agree with him.''

GORE GOES TO BUSH COUNTRY TO RAISE CASH FOR DEMOCRATS 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By RICHARD A. OPPEL JR.   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   HOUSTON _ Vice President Al Gore cannot count on Texas for
electoral votes in November, but he can still bank on it for
Democratic money.
</P>
<P>
   The vice president was to attend a reception and dinner Friday
night in Houston that would raise more than $600,000 for the
Democratic National Committee, capping a week of fund raising in
Washington, Cincinnati and Detroit expected to raise an additional
$1 million.
</P>
<P>
   Gore, who has called for an overhaul of campaign finance laws
and challenged Gov. George W. Bush of Texas, the presumptive
Republican presidential nominee, to mutually halt the raising of
large, unregulated donations of ``soft money,'' has shown no signs
of letting up his own prodigious fund raising. Gore is helping the
Democratic Party to raise $35 million in soft money during the next
few months to finance a spate of television commercials intended to
highlight the party's differences with the Republicans.
</P>
<P>
   Bush's back yard may seem an unusual place for Gore to raise
money, given the governor's popularity here and his strong ties to
the state's business community and to wealthy donors who make soft
money donations. But last year, in Dallas, Gore raised about
$500,000 during a reception and luncheon at the Fairmont Hotel as
part of a swing through Texas that raised $1 million for his
campaign, said Jess Hay, a Dallas businessman and longtime Gore
fund-raiser.
</P>
<P>
   This is Gore's first money-raising trip to Texas for the
Democratic committee this year; he made none last year, party
officials said. President Clinton has raised $1.5 million for the
party in Texas over that time, they said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Any time you can raise that kind of money by going into a
guy's home state against him, that's kind of unusual,'' said Ben
Barnes, a former Democratic lieutenant governor of Texas who is now
a lobbyist and is involved in technology venture capital projects
in Austin, Texas.
</P>
<P>
   Scott McClellan, a spokesman for Bush, noting that both events
were being held at the homes of lawyers, said, ``Al Gore is an
obstacle to meaningful lawsuit reform because he's beholden to
powerful personal-injury trial lawyers.''
</P>
<P>
   The first Houston event for Gore, according to officials at the
Gore campaign and the Democratic National Committee, was to be a
$1,000-a-person reception at the home of Denman Heard, a Houston
lawyer. Later, at a dinner held at the home of Lee Godfrey, a
prominent litigator who has previously played host at similar
events, 33 people expected to donate $15,000 each were to dine on
crabmeat parfait, quail stuffed with squash, and pecan pie.
</P>
<P>
   Gore, who is then to return to Washington, plans to make remarks
at both functions. Attendees were expected to include Steve Susman,
one of Godfrey's law partners; F. Kenneth Bailey Jr., a prominent
Houston plaintiff's lawyer; Garry Mauro, a former Democratic land
commissioner of Texas, and Edward G. Rendell, the former mayor of
Philadelphia who is now general chairman of the Democratic National
Committee.

 &HT;    Psyched Sutton in TPC control
 &HT;    By Glenn Sheeley
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   PONTE VEDRA BEACH, Fla. _ Hal Sutton started the week leading
the PGA Tour in psychology, insisting that to praise Tiger Woods
unnecessarily is to be defeated on the first tee.
</P>
<P>
   Thirty-six holes later, Sutton is still leading The Players
Championship at 6-under-par 138, by one shot over non-winner Omar
Uresti and Tom Lehman, and Sutton is still beating Woods.
</P>
<P>
   On the treacherous TPC at Sawgrass, which is getting firmer and
faster after two days of drying wind, that's no easy mission. Proud
of his patience during Friday's round, when he made a 12-foot putt
for bogey at the 18th hole after driving into the water, Sutton
said, ``The only person I can control is myself and I'm out of
control half the time.''
</P>
<P>
   Uresti, one of several players in contention who could gain a
potential last spot in the Masters _ not to mention $1,080,000 with
a victory _ regrouped for a second-round 68 after a potentially
disastrous start. Finishing two holes from Thursday's first round,
Uresti hit a ball in the water at the par-3 island 17th, reloaded
and made a 4-foot putt for a bogey. He took just 23 putts in the
second round.
</P>
<P>
   ``If it happens, it happens,'' he said, pondering the weekend.
``I'm only 31... so I feel like I've quite a few years left.''
</P>
<P>
   South African Fulton Allem, known for his opinions and a hatred
of slow play, shot the low round of the tournament, a 7-under 65,
after an opening 75 and is two shots back at 140.
</P>
<P>
   Woods, who double-bogeyed No. 4, birdied the par-5 ninth to
finish a second consecutive 71. He's tied for fifth at 2-under 142,
along with Len Mattiace and Ernie Els, four behind Sutton.
</P>
<P>
   ``Anything under par is good,'' Woods said. ``It's becoming
quite a challenge out there. I'm very pleased with my position. I'm
in the hunt with a chance to win.''
</P>
<P>
   Defending champion David Duval is at 4-over 148, 10 shots back
after a 73 that included a triple-bogey on the par-3 eighth.
</P>
<P>
   Sutton, who won here in 1983, said course conditions have the
potential to go ``over the edge'' as they did last year, when shots
would not hold on baked greens.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are times out there right now where we're switching from
offense to defense,'' he said. ``You've got to be smart enough to
know when to hit the accelerator and when to hit the brake.''

LAVIN: MOISO, RUSH MIGHT GO
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JON WILNER  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUBURN HILLS, Mich. _ UCLA coach Steve Lavin acknowledged Friday
that sophomore forwards Jerome Moiso and JaRon Rush might turn pro.
</P>
<P>
   ``Those would be the two, for different reasons,'' Lavin said.
``Over the next couple weeks, they'll have to decide.''
</P>
<P>
   Rush must make restitution on the $6,525 he took from a sports
agent and his former AAU coach that resulted in NCAA violations and
a 24-game suspension. He also has legal fees.
</P>
<P>
   Moiso has first-round talent and might creep into the lottery.
Scouts question his toughness but love his skills.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's in the position, because of his size and ability, to make
the jump,'' Lavin said.
</P>
<P>
   Another possible personnel change involves reserve forward Matt
Barnes, who said Thursday that he's considering playing football
and joining the basketball team late. He was a gifted receiver in
high school.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd be real surprised,'' Lavin said. ``That's always something
he has entertained. It's in his mind because he loves football. But
he knows he came here to play basketball and that's his future. I
don't think he wants to do anything that would set him back from
the pack. If he plays football, he'll be playing catch-up the rest
of the (basketball) season.''
</P>
<P>
   __ They're welcomed back: The only staff changes will come if
one of the assistants (Michael Holton, Jim Saia and Steve Spencer)
gets a head-coaching position.
</P>
<P>
   Lavin has no plans to replace anyone on his much-maligned staff.
</P>
<P>
   ``What people have forgotten is the first year . . . they hired
us with the understanding that we were a young staff that would
grow with the program,'' Lavin said. ``(Firing someone) is not a
very good model for loyalty, it kills your continuity and it sends
an odd message when you have that level of success and you're
rolling heads. The worst is when you lose in the first round and
roll heads. That's shifting the blame (from the head coach).
</P>
<P>
   ``They're a critical part of the success we've had, with three
Sweet 16's in the last four years.''
</P>
<P>
   __ Help arriving? The Bruins signed one recruit in November,
power forward T.J. Cummings from the Chicago suburbs, and they
could have used him against Iowa State.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's a tough kid in terms of blocking shots, playing hard,''
Lavin said. ``He's a blue-collar Midwestern kid. His strengths
early in his career will be defense and rebounding. As he develops,
he'll be more like his dad. He'll be an offensive threat, as
well.''
</P>
<P>
   Cummings' father is longtime NBA veteran Terry Cummings.
</P>
<P>
   __ Add recruiting: The Bruins are not recruiting a point guard
to join the team next season. Earl Watson, who will be a senior,
played extremely well in the final month, and the Bruins believe
Ryan Bailey is a capable backup.
</P>
<P>
   ``The way our kids finished out the season, there's not a point
guard in the country that could come in as a freshman and leapfrog
over Earl and (Bailey),'' Lavin said.
</P>
<P>
   __ The lineup: The Bruins will need all the talent they can
muster. Most of the talent returns for Stanford, Arizona, Cal,
Arizona State and USC, and the Bruins' nonconference schedule is
brutal.
</P>
<P>
   They open in the Coaches vs. Cancer tournament, a four-team,
two-game event with St. John's, Kansas and Kentucky. They play
Georgia Tech in the Wooden Classic. They visit DePaul and Purdue
and host North Carolina and Villanova. They also play Hawaii, Cal
State Northridge, UC Irvine and UC Santa Barbara.

WILL CHINESE FOOD GO THE WAY OF PIZZA?  
 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, MARCH 26) 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 By JOEL M. KOTKIN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   SCOTTSDALE, Ariz. _ It is a long way from any kind of Chinatown
to the Fashion Square Mall in this upscale Phoenix suburb. But to
Richard L. Federico, the usually-packed flagship restaurant in the
P.F. Chang's China Bistro chain, nestled close to Nordstrom's and
convenient to the multiplex, is more representative of Chinese
food's future than are the tens of thousands of mom-and-pop Chinese
restaurants that pepper the Main Streets of America.
</P>
<P>
   If he is correct, mass marketing, Wall Street financing and
professional management will finally have broken through in what
has long been a chain-resistant segment of the retail economy. Like
independent department stores, local burger joints and dozens of
other entrepreneurial businesses, the independent ethnic restaurant
may soon find itself, if not headed for extinction, well on the way
to marginalization.
</P>
<P>
   In many ways, Chinese food has been one of the last redoubts.
Donna Gabaccia, a historian at the University of North Carolina who
examined the mainstreaming of ethnic food in her 1998 book, ``We
Are What We Eat,'' said Chinese food presents unique obstacles to
mass marketing compared with, say, Italian or Mexican cuisine.
</P>
<P>
   Individually owned Chinese restaurants were among the first to
offer fast orders, takeout and delivery, she noted, leaving little
room for a franchise fast-food approach to take hold, as it did in
hamburgers, chicken, pizza, tacos and other categories. And the
complexity of Chinese food preparation, whose tools and techniques
have little in common with European cuisine, makes it less
susceptible to standardization.
</P>
<P>
   Federico, president and chief executive of P.F. Chang, dismisses
those concerns. ``In this business, the attitude was that there was
a Chinese restaurant on every corner, and the idea was you could
not penetrate the Chinese segment,'' he said. ``But they said the
same thing about Italian 20 years ago.''
</P>
<P>
   Professionally managed companies made inroads long ago into
other ethnic food categories, with mass chains like Chili's
(Mexican and Tex-Mex, 637 restaurants) and Olive Garden (Italian,
464). In many suburban and Sun Belt communities, chains like these
often became the standard-bearers for their categories, sometimes
by default. Their success told Paul M. Fleming, founder of P.F.
Chang and now a consultant to the chain, that ``authentic'' roots
were far from a prerequisite for success in ethnic food.
</P>
<P>
   Fleming, 45, had a background in chain restaurants, notably as
owner and operator of several Ruth's Chris Steak House locations.
On a business trip to Los Angeles, he once enjoyed a meal at the
swank Mandarin Restaurant in Beverly Hills, but afterward could not
find similar quality food in Phoenix, his hometown. He got in touch
with Phillip Chiang, owner of the Mandarin, in 1992 and asked him
to lend some culinary expertise to a new chain.
</P>
<P>
   Fleming started with Chiang's recipes and ingredient-buying
instructions, but he made some adjustments that he hoped would
enhance the food's appeal to a more mainstream market. He
concentrated on the most familiar menu selections, lowered the oil
content a bit and aimed to hold prices to an average bill of $17 a
person.
</P>
<P>
   He also developed an extended wine list, unusual in Chinese
restaurants, and chose a sleek modern decor that avoided Chinese
cliches.
</P>
<P>
   Fleming believed that starting in a suburban mall rather than in
a cosmopolitan urban setting would be a better way to test the
concept for an eventual national rollout. ``Phoenix may not be a
recognized center for Chinese cooking,'' Fleming said, ``but it is
a good barometer for the rest of the country.''
</P>
<P>
   Opened in 1993 with a name that melds Fleming's initials and a
version of Chiang's surname that Middle America could readily spell
and pronounce, P.F. Chang's took off, and soon expanded to Southern
California, the Boston area and to Westbury, N.Y., on Long Island.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   There are now 39 open nationwide and 13 in development. In 1996,
with the chain growing and more managerial expertise needed,
Fleming brought in Federico, 46, a veteran of the Bennigan's and
Macaroni Grill chains of Brinker International, to run the
operation with a new chief financial officer, Robert T. Vivian.
</P>
<P>
   Fleming remains on the board, and Chiang continues as a
consultant and minor shareholder. The new executives took the
company public in December 1998 at $12 a share; the stock closed on
Friday at $32.75.
</P>
<P>
   As Gabaccia might have predicted, the toughest challenge in
expansion was transmitting cooking expertise to new chefs and staff
members, especially because the chain had no intention of
restricting itself to places where native Chinese workers could be
recruited.
</P>
<P>
   The responsibility for maintaining chainwide food quality falls
on P.F. Chang's executive chef, Paul M. Muller, a German-American
native of Oakdale, N.Y., with experience in the kitchens of the
distinctly non-Asian Waldorf Astoria Hotel in Manhattan and the Old
Ebbit Grill in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   Having been schooled in Chinese cuisine under Chiang's
direction, Muller puts new chefs through six to eight months of
training before giving them restaurants to run.
</P>
<P>
   Only 8 of the 39 head chefs at P.F. Chang's restaurants are
Asian. ``The skills can be taught to gwei-lo's for sure,'' Muller
said, using a Cantonese slang expression for Caucasians. ``It just
takes a different mentality and a kind of passion.''
</P>
<P>
   Critics of the chain approach say the mentality and passion are
not so easily cloned, just as knowing how to daub paint doesn't
make someone a pointillist. Theresa Lin, a of Chinese-food critic
and a restaurateur based in Los Angeles, said P.F. Chang's and
ventures like the New York-based China Grill could compete
effectively only where mainstream diners have not been exposed to
the work of native Chinese chefs.
</P>
<P>
   ``These kinds of businesses are good at marketing, but when the
mainstream people discover the real authentic food, they will go
for it,'' said Lin, who was born in Taiwan and now owns three
upscale restaurants in Las Vegas, Miami and Santa Monica, Calif.
</P>
<P>
   Federico concedes that at the luxury end of the spectrum, Lin
may well be right. P.F. Chang's may never be the first choice of
sophisticated diners who enjoy sampling Chinese fare in meccas like
Manhattan, San Francisco, the Flushing neighborhood of Queens or
the San Gabriel Valley east of Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   But as his chain expands across the country, Federico said he
believes the great majority of consumers will come to think of the
food at places like P.F. Chang's, not the traditional, mom-and-pop
eateries, as setting the standard.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the future, for a lot of people of my kids' generation,''
he said, gazing out at the crowd in the Scottsdale dining room,
``this will be the real definition of a Chinese restaurant.''

CONCLUSION OF SURVEY ON GAYS IN MILITARY 
</HEADLINE>
   (With GAYS-MILITARY)  
(lh) 
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Following is the conclusion of the Pentagon
inspector general's survey on harassment of gays in the military
and familiarity with the Defense Department's Homosexual Conduct
Policy:
</P>
<P>
   According to the respondents, offensive comments about
homosexuals were commonplace and a majority believed they were
tolerated to some extent. Additionally, the respondents stated that
harassment of perceived homosexuals was most often done by junior
enlisted males to other junior enlisted males. Offensive speech was
by far the most recurring type of harassment. However, about 5
percent of the respondents had witnessed or experienced harassment
of perceived homosexuals in the form of vandalism, physical
assault, and limitation or denial of training or career
opportunities.
</P>
<P>
   Although the majority of cited harassment situations had not
been witnessed by someone senior to the person being harassed or
the person doing the harassing, 73 percent of the respondents who
said that a senior person had witnessed the harassment reported
that the senior person did nothing to immediately stop the
harassment. Of those respondents who described a specific situation
of harassment, 61 percent stated the harassment occurred on a
military installation or ship. Just under 50 percent said the
harassment occurred during duty hours. Service members believed
that harassment was more than twice as likely to be tolerated by
other unit members (10.2 percent) than by the unit or
installation/ship commander or the immediate supervisor (4.6
percent.)
</P>
<P>
   Less than 50 percent of the respondents reported that they had
training on the policy. However, prior to our survey, DOD
management had recognized the need to develop training plans
discussing harassment of perceived homosexuals. On Feb. 1, 2000,
the secretary of defense approved the training plans for each
service.
</P>
<P>
   About 50 percent of the respondents believed the policy was
moderately or very effective at preventing or reducing harassment;
46 percent believed it was slightly or not effective; and 4 percent
did not provide a response. There is no basis for speculating on
the extent to which respondent perceptions may change after the
approved training plans are implemented. However, ensuring that
meaningful training is provided to all service members is clearly
essential.

MARTHA GRAHAM BOARD SEEKS TO REMOVE DIRECTOR 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Calif.)  (lb) 
 By JENNIFER DUNNING   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The board of the Martha Graham Dance Company voted
7-5 on Thursday to remove Ron Protas, Graham's heir and handpicked
successor, as artistic director of the company.
</P>
<P>
   Protas was groomed by Graham to direct the troupe after her
death in 1991. Graham also left him her ballets. The company has
received good reviews in recent years for performances in New York
and internationally. But the fund-raising difficulties of Graham's
last years continued under Protas' direction.
</P>
<P>
   Protas agreed two years ago to step down as director in June
2000, when Janet Eilber, a former Graham star, was to join the
troupe as artistic director with his agreement. It appears that the
sudden board vote may have been precipitated by Protas' unexpected
reluctance in early March to accept Eilber as his successor.
</P>
<P>
   As part of the succession agreement, Protas became the director
of the Martha Graham Trust, which he set up to license the Graham
dances. Michael Quinn, the lawyer who represents Protas and the
trust, suggested Friday that it might be difficult for Protas to be
removed as artistic director of the company, given that he owns the
copyrights to the dances.
</P>
<P>
   Charlene Nederlander, chairwoman of the 22-member board, which
is based in New York, was not present at the meeting and did not
return a request for comment.
</P>
<P>
   Francis Mason, a board member since 1973, who voted to remove
Protas, said Friday: ``I believe Ron is responsible for Martha
getting her work together so that by the end of her life everything
was poised for the future. But I'm afraid the time has come. Our
hope is to work out with him and his attorney the best next way to
go.''
</P>
<P>
   Marvin Preston, executive director of the company, said Friday
that the troupe ``would proceed at this time to operate without an
artistic director.''
</P>
<P>
   Eilber, who has served as artistic director designate for the
last two years, withdrew in February after the board failed to
raise money for her salary this year. When a board member proposed
a plan, at a meeting in early March, to raise the funds, Protas
said that he disagreed with some of Eilber's plans and felt that
the appointment had been a mistake.
</P>
<P>
   Eilber, who lives in Los Angeles, said Friday that she would
have to remain there with her family for another year. In a letter
to the board dated Feb. 22, she offered to continue working long
distance as principal artistic adviser with Christine Dakin and
Terese Capucilli, two current lead Graham dancers who are associate
artistic directors in New York.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think this is the end,'' Quinn said Friday. ``Whether
or not the board had the power to do this as a board, Ron holds all
the copyrights in the dances and the rights in the use of Martha
Graham's name as a trademark. As the owner of the Martha Graham
trademark and copyrights, he not only has the right but the duty
under the law to oversee the quality of the company and its
school.''
</P>
<P>
   Protas has agreed to allow the company, now on a national tour,
to continue performing the dances through April 29, when the tour
ends.

c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
WEST REGION CAP 
No. 6 PURDUE (24-9) vs. No. 8 WISCONSIN (21-13)
<TEXT>
<P>
   PURDUE BOILERMAKERS
</P>
<P>
   COACH: Gene Keady is in his 20th season with the Boilermakers
and with a 439-190 record is Purdue's winningest coach. Though he
is well-regarded by his peers, Keady has never taken a team to the
Final Four. This would be an unlikely team to make it, but so is
Saturday's opponent, Wisconsin. Keady was named the Big Ten coach
of the year this season for the seventh time after guiding a team
picked to finish in the middle of the pack to a 12-4 record and a
third-place slot.
</P>
<P>
   KEY STATS: Defense and rebounding fuel this team. Purdue
continued its string of snuffing opposing teams that like to shoot
from beyond the arc in Thursday's semifinal victory over Gonzaga.
In three tournament games, the Boilermakers have held Dayton,
Oklahoma and the Bulldogs to nine 3-point shots in 56 attempts.
They outrebounded Gonzaga, 44-33.
</P>
<P>
   SCOUTING REPORT: Physical, physical, physical. The Boilers play
bruising basketball that isn't always pretty, but tends to wear an
opponent out.
</P>
<P>
   Will win if: They hit more 3-pointers than the Badgers. Both
play about the same around the basket and inside the line, but the
key to this game ironically may be what happens on the perimeter.

</P>
<P>
   COACH: Dick Bennett, in his fifth season, is the first coach in
school history to lead the program to consecutive 20-victory
seasons. He now has the Badgers in their first regional
championship game. He seems capable of taking average players who
would battle for playing time on more talented teams and molding
them into a unit that beats those teams with marquee stars.
</P>
<P>
   KEY STATS: The Badgers held LSU to 14 first-half points in their
victory Thursday night. That's right, 14. Wisconsin doesn't shoot
well, but neither does its opponents.
</P>
<P>
   SCOUTING REPORT: This is a typical Bennett team that plays good
defense, is patient on offense and doesn't rattle by getting into
an early hole. They won two of three against the Boilermakers
during the season and just might have a slight edge in quality
depth.
</P>
<P>
   Will win if: Insiders Andy Kowske and Mark Vershaw can dominate
in the paint and their guards have a good shooting day from the
perimeter against a tenacious Purdue perimeter defense. WISCONSIN
STARTERS G MIKE KELLEY 6-3 185 JR Key stats: Averages 5.2 points,

</P>
<P>
   MIKE JONES' PREDICTION: WISCONSIN 53, PURDUE 48
</P>
<P>
   The Badgers win their third in a row over the Boilermakers
because they can match up with them inside man-for-man and they
have better guard depth.

 &HT;    Park wins pole with record run
 &HT;    By Al Levine
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   BRISTOL, Tenn. _Six drivers bettered the qualifying-lap record
at Bristol Motor Speedway Friday, but no one could outrun Steve
Park's No. 1 Chevrolet all day.
</P>
<P>
   Park had the fastest car in two practice sessions, then backed
it up by taking the pole for Sunday's Food City 500. He dashed
around the half-mile concrete track in 15.184 seconds or 126.370
mph.
</P>
<P>
   It's the first pole of Park's three-year Winston Cup career and
the first for his car owner, Dale Earnhardt, who qualified 11th,
just ahead of the other car in the Earnhardt garage, the No. 8 of
son Dale Earnhardt Jr.
</P>
<P>
   Afterward, Park was rewarded by a congratulatory chat and a rare
wide grin from his intimidating boss.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's a hard guy to please at times,'' Park said of Earnhardt.
``Sometimes if you get just half a smile from him you know you're
doing good. If you do something wrong, you're usually out on the
farm on a tractor, bailing hay with him in the hot sun.''
</P>
<P>
   They won't be bailing together this week, at least.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's like a proud father, really,'' Park said. ``This is his
first Winston Cup pole. He's put a lot of time, effort and money
into developing this team, not only for myself but for his son.
He's seen it grow from a grass field to what it is today. The first
pole for DEI (Dale Earnhardt Inc.) is something that I'll always
remember and he'll always remember.''
</P>
<P>
   And now that he's going to start out front, Park is prepared to
have his boss running hard behind him. Last year, in a
controversial move, Earnhardt bumped Terry Labonte from behind on
the last lap, knocking Labonte out of control and winning the fall
race here.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm going to try to run fast enough to keep him behind me on
that last lap,'' Park said. ``I'll be expecting a bump and maybe be
on the defensive. I think Terry thought he was going to get away
from him last year and Dale's a fighter, he doesn't give up.
</P>
<P>
   It was expected that Rusty Wallace's qualifying lap record of
15.333 seconds set last year would be obliterated after several
drivers broke the record testing earlier this month.
</P>
<P>
   Wallace qualified sixth at 15.328 seconds (125.183 mph). His
brother, Kenny, took the outside pole in 15.242 seconds although he
slightly damaged the right rear of the No. 55 Chevy when he brushed
the wall.
</P>
<P>
   Jeff Gordon qualified third and Mike Skinner was fourth as Chevy
took the first four spots.
</P>
<P>
   Ward Burton, fifth, was the top qualifying Pontiac and Rusty
Wallace had the top Ford.

<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ Put yourself in the shoes of Jack E. Robinson III.
</P>
<P>
   Faster than you can say your own name, your fledgling campaign
for Edward M. Kennedy's U.S. Senate seat has been clobbered by
embarrassing accusations that you are sure came from the senator's
camp: a rush of stories about your driving record, your legal
history and, most mortifying of all, your love life.
</P>
<P>
   At the news conference to announce your candidacy, you find
yourself forced to declare: ``I am not a womanizer. I am not a
groper.''
</P>
<P>
   Imagine how tempting it would be to fight back by dragging up
the scandals that roiled your opponent's past.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, in an interview at the elegant home office that is so
far his campaign's only place of operations aside from its Web
site, www.robinson2000.com, Robinson suggested, ``Perhaps, the
senator should issue `The Kennedy Report' to tell us exactly what
happened at Chappaquiddick.''
</P>
<P>
   In that highly unlikely event, the report would be the second
confessional exercise of the race.
</P>
<P>
   Robinson, a 39-year-old businessman, sixth-generation Republican
and first-time candidate, has already posted ``The Robinson
Report'' on his campaign Web site. Perhaps the most notable effort
at a pre-emptive political strike of the Internet era, it lists and
explains every incident in his life that he thought might be fodder
for attacks.
</P>
<P>
   It includes an ex-girlfriend's restraining order against him,
which was dropped, he writes, because he had phone-record proof
that she was the real harasser, and a drunken driving charge that
was dropped after he passed a Breathalyzer test. He also thrice
flunked bar exams in other states before passing in Massachusetts,
has had some lawsuit tangles and was once arrested for failing to
pay a speeding ticket.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yes, there have been some embarrassing incidents, and we
believe sources close to the Kennedy campaign have basically
launched this attack,'' said Robinson, a bachelor. ``So I decided
to try to put an end to all these extraneous issues by just
releasing everything I could think of in my entire life that could
even possibly be used against us.''
</P>
<P>
   Kennedy's spokesman, Will Keyser, dismissed as ``completely
ridiculous'' Robinson's suggestion that the damaging information
had originated in the senator's camp.
</P>
<P>
   But that has not mollified Robinson. ``You know, there's a
candidate in this race who was actually convicted of a crime, and
it's not me,'' he said. (After Kennedy's 1969 plunge off a
Chappaquiddick bridge, which killed his car's passenger, Mary Jo
Kopechne, he pleaded guilty to leaving the scene of an accident and
was given a two-month suspended sentence.)
</P>
<P>
   But the reasons for Robinson's frustration and anger just keep
growing. Amid the rush of accusations, he was unceremoniously
disowned this week by the Republican governor of Massachusetts,
Paul Cellucci, and the state Republican Party, a rejection that
Robinson called ``unheralded in American history'' and a ``typical
Beacon Hill back room double-cross.''
</P>
<P>
   And almost every day, local papers have carried a new source of
embarrassment, leading some to comment that Kennedy may finally
have a rival with a past as problematic as his own.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday, it was an unidentified woman's account in The Boston
Globe that Robinson had subjected her to unwanted advances after a
heavy-drinking dinner date, including French kisses that led her
and her friends to refer to him as ``Jack the Tongue.'' Robinson
denies the accusation.
</P>
<P>
   And on Thursday, it was reports that he left the scene of an
accident that occurred while he was giving a radio interview on his
cell phone. Robinson, who was not accused of being at fault, has
said he was pulling forward to get out of traffic's way, not
fleeing.
</P>
<P>
   The flood of what he calls ``fallacious and fraudulent
allegations'' has utterly obscured Robinson's campaign message: He
presents himself as a John McCain-style reformer who wants a
radical overhaul of the country's education and campaign finance
system, a less radical overhaul of the health care system and a
more concerted foreign policy.
</P>
<P>
   ``We need to reform the system, and I don't believe the
senator's capable of doing that,'' he said. ``He is the system.''
</P>
<P>
   The accusations have also obscured what is otherwise a quite
distinguished resume. Raised in Boston's Roxbury section, son of
two entrepreneurs who divorced when he was 5, Robinson attended
Brown University and received law and business degrees from
Harvard. He was the top executive of an airline and wrote a book,
``Freefall: The Needless Destruction of Eastern Airlines''
(HarperCollins, 1992). In the mid-'90s, he shifted to the
cell-phone industry and founded a company doing business in the
Caribbean.
</P>
<P>
   Asked why he was running now, Robinson said he had four goals in
his life, and he had accomplished the first three: to graduate from
Harvard; to be president of an airline by the time he was 30, which
he made by about a week, and to be economically self-sufficient by
40. The fourth, he said, was to be a U.S. senator from his home
state, Massachusetts.
</P>
<P>
   He has been living out-of-state for a dozen years, in Manhattan
and then Greenwich, Conn., he acknowledged; but he has voted here
since the mid-'90s, he said, and was moving his possessions back
this week to the stone Tudor-style house on Boston's graceful
Arborway where he grew up.
</P>
<P>
   Some Massachusetts political analysts say that Robinson's
candidacy is so laughable that the Republican Party should be
ashamed for not being able to field a candidate credible enough to
keep Kennedy busy at home instead of off gaining votes for other
Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   But for Robinson, this is the fight of his life, he said,
tougher and nastier than anything he has ever encountered.
</P>
<P>
   He is putting out a ``clarion call for help,'' he said, and
plans to battle on no matter what.
</P>
<P>
   ``Party be damned, full speed ahead,'' he said, ``because I
don't want the next generation of politicians to live through what
I just lived through.''

`HIDDEN RIVER': TRACING A HUSBAND'S SEVERED ROOTS 
</HEADLINE>
  (Eds.: Production notes at end of review.) 
(lh) 
 By STEPHEN HOLDEN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ An air of desolation hangs over ``Hidden River,'' the
feature-film debut of Mercedes Garcia Guevara, an Argentine
director who shows herself an adept conjurer of cinematic moods,
especially when she turns the camera on a sunset illuminating the
wild mountains of western Argentina. ``Hidden River'' might be
described as a murky emotional mystery story that raises more
questions than it answers. What at first appears to be a sudsy
drama about a suspicious wife's investigation of her husband's
possible adultery deepens into a portrait of a woman's instinctive
quest for an elusive spiritual and emotional authenticity.
</P>
<P>
   That quest begins when Ana (Paola Krum), a working mother in
Buenos Aires, discovers a letter in her husband's mail from a
strange woman thanking him for sending money. A search through his
things uncovers a stack of letters mailed from Rio Escondido, a
remote rural village at the foot of the mountains in western
Argentina.
</P>
<P>
   Impulsively taking a plane to the region, Ana rents a pickup
truck and ends up at Hidden River, a children's home in Rio
Escondido. Here, she meets Lucio (Elias Carrasco), a little boy who
turns out to be the son of her husband's brother, Martin (Juan
Palomino), a man she didn't know existed. Martin is serving time in
a nearby prison for murder but is permitted to leave the
institution on Sundays. He often hitchhikes to Hidden River, where
he watches from afar as his son frisks on the riverbank with his
friends.
</P>
<P>
   As Martin returns to prison one Sunday, Ana picks him up in her
truck and, without revealing her identity, begins questioning him.
Following him to an abandoned farmhouse, she learns it is her
husband's childhood home. What begins as an edgy acquaintanceship
between a convicted murderer (who the movie hints may not be
guilty) and his sister-in-law develops erotic sparks.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hidden River,'' which is being shown as part of the New
Directors/New Films series at Lincoln Center, could be read as a
parable about the danger of severing from one's roots. Ana's
husband, Luis (Pablo Cedron), is a harried businessman who has no
interest in dredging up the past and is indifferent when Ana, after
returning to Buenos Aires, suggests that they visit Hidden River
together.
</P>
<P>
   As effectively as ``Hidden River'' sustains a tone of melancholy
(reinforced by Martin Bauer's background music for guitar and
cello), the film feels fragmentary and unfocused. Even though the
movie is a meditation on secrets and the longings that people keep
under wraps, too much about its characters remains concealed.

YANKEE OODLES COME IN HANDY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By WILL MCDONOUGH  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   With apologies to Sports Illustrated, there are millions of
reasons why the Red Sox won't beat the Yankees this year, or in the
near future. About 75 million reasons. A recent confidential
financial memo placed the Yankees' gross income in 1998 at $180
million. That was about $75 million more than the Red Sox grossed.
As long as the New Yorkers have that kind of a financial edge,
there won't be a level playing field.
</P>
<P>
   The Yankees' financial printout the previous five years is
interesting. In 1994, their gross was $85.7 million, and four years
later they were at $180 million. Yet, in that five-year period,
they had a net loss of about $3 million, which illustrates how
ridiculous professional sports has become. The Yankees player
payroll last year was $93.435 million. However, the way they are
going to keep their edge on everyone else is in the farm system.
They annually spend nearly $25 million on player development, which
is about double what the Red Sox spend and can afford.
</P>

   The Yankees have formed a new partnership with the NBA's New
Jersey Nets, and the difference between the teams is laughable. The
Nets have lost money the previous four years, including $45 million
a year ago during the NBA lockout. Fans around here beef about the
price of a Celtics or Bruins game at the FleetCenter. The average
ticket price for a Nets game is $54.45. The average ticket at
Yankee Stadium is $23.30.
</P>
<P>
   What this all says is that until the Red Sox get into a new
ballpark that can produce more revenue, they'll be chasing the
Yankees in vain. Speaking of the new Fenway, we are told that a
representative of House Speaker Tom Finneran had a good question
when George Mitchell, the former senator from Maine, showed up at
the State House on behalf of Major League Baseball. Why doesn't
Major League Baseball put up money to help build new stadiums, like
the National Football League is doing in Foxborough? I understand
there was no answer.

   Somehow, former University of Massachusetts coach John Calipari
got dragged into the Bruiser Flint contract dispute last weekend,
and he doesn't like it. Flint was Cal's righthand man at UMass and
succeeded John when he left to coach the Nets. Calipari has been
very supportive of Flint behind the scenes. When UMass came close
to firing Flint last weekend, some spinmasters tried to save Flint
by saying he saved the program after Calipari left.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I was at UMass, we never cheated, and for anyone to write
that or say that, they don't know what they are talking about,''
said Calipari. ``When I was there we graduated a great percentage
of our players, much better than the average for the student body.
We had a bunch of good kids. They tried hard. Our players didn't
have cars. Why don't they write about these schools where all of
the players are driving around in cars, and ask how that happens?
</P>
<P>
   ``We had one blemish. Marcus (Camby). That happened in Hartford,
not on our campus. We reported that (to the NCAA). Our
administration and our coaching staff were cleared completely by
the NCAA. Now let me say this. I love UMass. I love the people
there, but they will never compete at the highest level of
basketball until they spend more money on the program. Connecticut
spends twice the money on basketball that UMass does.''
</P>
<P>
   Said UMass athletic director Bob Marcum, ``We have been No. 1 in
our conference academically and athletically four of the last five
years.''
</P>
<P>
   Calipari is settling in as the new head coach at Memphis
University. ``I wanted to stay in basketball, and I wanted
something long term. I want my kids to be in one place, going to
school for the next seven or eight years. You don't get that in the
NBA. You last four years on a job in that league and you're ready
for the Hall of Fame. I think we have a good chance to win here,
and this is the right spot for me at this time in my life.''
</P>

   How odd is it that in a five-day span at the FleetCenter, two
teams got robbed of a chance to win by referees choking on their
whistles at the end of the game? Last Saturday, Maine and Boston
College were tied, 1-1, in the closing seconds of the Hockey East
championship when a Maine player hooked BC defenseman Mike Mottau
to the ice, allowing a teammate to score the winner with two
seconds left. Maine won because the official choked on his whistle,
instead of the game going to overtime with BC on the power play.
</P>
<P>
   Then Wednesday, the Celtics and Minnesota were tied, 106-106,
with less than five seconds left. The Celtics' Paul Pierce is
directly in front of Minnesota's Anthony Peeler, who is set to
launch a 3-pointer to win the game. Peeler's teammate, Kevin
Garnett, comes up behind Pierce and shoves him with both hands in
the lower back and sends him to the floor. Peeler, with no one in
front of him, has a clear look at the basket and sinks the shot.
Again, the referees choked. If justice had been done, Pierce would
have been at the foul line with two-10ths of a second left, with
two fouls shots, and the Peeler basket would not have counted.
</P>
<P>
   Message to the officials in both games: If you don't have the
heart to make the right call when the game is on the line, get out
of the business.

   Nearly 25 years ago, what happened to Alan Cregg when he was
playing for Yale prompted college hockey to have players wear face
shields. Now Cregg is hoping that the same terrible accident that
happened to Bryan Berard of the Toronto Maple Leafs will force the
same kind of action in the National Hockey League.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was playing hockey at Yale and caught the tip of the stick
in my eye,'' Cregg said. ``That ended my hockey career and cost me
90 percent of the sight in my eye. The doctor at Yale at the time,
Dr. Peter Jokl, petitioned the ECAC to have face shields
mandatory.''
</P>
<P>
   Berard, a promising young Maple Leafs defenseman from
Woonsocket, R.I., had his eye shattered by a stick and probably
will never play again.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a terrible thing to go through, especially for a young
athlete,'' said Cregg, who is now executive director of Prevent
Blindness Massachusetts. Cregg's group is going to conduct a
fund-raiser at the Boston Billiard Club, 126 Brookline Ave., Monday
night with the Bruins' Don Sweeney one of the participants in the
Celebrity Billiards Challenge.
</P>
<P>
   Sweeney, who played at Harvard, has always worn a face shield
since his college days, and probably doesn't know that what
happened to Cregg created the change.
</P>
<P>

<P>
   Here are some words to remember about Jets coach Al Groh's
statement that his team is not trading talented wide receiver
Keyshawn Johnson. The words to focus on are ``at this time.'' The
words that weren't in the release but could prove appropriate are
``franchise player.''
</P>
<P>
   Johnson, a truly great player, wants a $15 million bonus and $9
million a year. He has two years left on his contract. The Jets
won't renegotiate. Even though they will deny it, if the right deal
comes along, they'll make it. If they don't, they still have the
franchise ``tag'' available and Keyshawn may be ``it.'' Either
that, or retire.

   It appears Florida State's Peter Warrick is this year's Ricky
Williams. Williams was pegged early as the first pick in the draft
after coming off a record-breaking Heisman Trophy season a year
ago. Then he got fat and slipped to the fifth spot in the draft.
Warrick was the early front-runner for No. 1. Now he is sliding
after running a 4.6-second 40-yard dash in his personal workout.
Some of the Florida State linemen were nearly as fast. A wide
receiver running that speed, who is not big (Warrick is 6 feet)
won't go on top. Incidentally, Williams, who has been a flop on and
off the field for the New Orleans Saints, paid back Woolf
Associates of Boston the $65,000 he owed them for when they were
his original agents. He is on agent No. 2, but reportedly is
looking for agent No. 3 and the Saints to redo his contract . . .
The NBA and Celtics have made a deal to return to UMass-Boston this
summer with 10 teams. Last year, eight teams came with Summer
League teams and put on a great show, coming close to selling out
the gym every night. This is where the Celtics fell in love with
Adrian Griffin and signed him. One of the hits of that week was
Providence's Austin Croshere, who has become a very good player for
Larry Bird's Indiana team. Speaking of UMass-Boston, good guy
Johnny Parker, one of the best athletic trainers/strength coaches
in the country, has volunteered to help aspiring trainers at the
school. Parker is between NFL jobs after being let go by new
Patriots coach Bill Belichick.

   Sadly, just as its wrestling program is on the way out, Boston
College has its first All-American. In an incredible performance,
sophomore Antonio Garay, also a football player, finished fourth in
the NCAA championships in St. Louis. Garay lost his first match and
then won six in a row before losing to the No. 2 wrestler in the
country. Garay, I'm told, has a chance to be one of the best
defensive linemen in school history if he continues to progress.
Unfortunately, BC has decided to drop wrestling, men's lacrosse,
and water polo after the 2002 season because of budget constraints
. . . I must be dreaming. Thought I read where the Texas Con Man
says he owes it to Dan Duquette that he's a Yankee. Didn't Toronto
trade the former fat boy to New York? How did Duquette have
anything to do with that? If Clemens wanted so badly to go to the
Yankees, why didn't he sign with them when he was a `free agent'
with the Red Sox? Know why? Because the money was bigger in
Toronto, where, when he was traded to New York, pitcher Pat Hentgen
said the other 24 Blue Jays were glad to see him go. Now look for
this to happen: If for some reason the Yankees don't extend his
contract, which expires this year, look for TCM to try to sell his
Hall of Fame ``hat'' to some other team.

POLICE SHOOTING PUTS FOCUS ON DRUG CRACKDOWN 
</HEADLINE>
  (rk) 
 By KEVIN FLYNN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Two months ago, to curb drug dealing and the violence
it spawns, New York City embarked on an ambitious $24 million
narcotics enforcement drive known as Operation Condor. Each day,
500 additional police officers _ some in uniform, some in
plainclothes _ have taken to the streets in high-crime
neighborhoods, working overtime to stage drug stings and roust
dealers from their street corner haunts. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Police officials say that Operation Condor has been an
unqualified success: drug trafficking has largely been driven
indoors, overall crime is down 8 percent and narcotics arrests have
increased 36 percent.
</P>
<P>
   But critics inside and outside of the department say they are
not convinced. And the March 16 death of an unarmed man, Patrick
Dorismond, in a scuffle with members of an undercover narcotics
squad in Midtown has raised questions about the effectiveness,
tactics and training of officers involved in expanded narcotics
efforts like Operation Condor.
</P>
<P>
   Though that undercover unit was not on overtime, and thus not
being paid with Condor funds, its tactics and training were
identical to those used by most of the city's narcotics squads.
Dorismond's death has led the critics to question how those squads
are operating, much the way the death of Amadou Diallo led to
intense scrutiny, and ultimately an overhaul, of the Street Crime
Unit.
</P>
<P>
   Although the narcotics division has doubled in the last five
years, supervisors say that great care has been taken to ensure
that officers in the expanded ranks are properly trained and
adequately supervised. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   But some community leaders are charging that the use of
aggressive tactics to arrest people for often minor crimes has only
increased tensions in a city where many black and Hispanic
residents already view the police with suspicion and fear.
Dorismond, an off-duty security guard, was the fourth unarmed black
man to be fatally shot by the police in 13 months.
</P>
<P>
   What is more, the critics note that the homicide rate has risen
22 percent this year, while all shootings have increased by 8
percent. For another, the expanded effort has produced a tide of
arrests that is almost entirely made up of misdemeanors, like
smoking marijuana or trespassing. There has even been a 9 percent
decline in felony narcotics arrests, for crimes like selling
cocaine and heroin.
</P>
<P>
   Many in the department view Operation Condor as something of a
strategic successor to the Street Crime Unit, which was widely
credited with helping to reduce violent crime by seizing illegal
guns during searches of people in high-crime areas. That unit's
effectiveness is widely viewed as diminished in the aftermath of
the Diallo shooting in the Bronx. Its gun seizures have declined.
</P>
<P>
   In its place, several narcotics supervisors said, the city is
using the Operation Condor account to put the extra 500 officers on
the streets each day to keep the pressure on drug gangs whose
interactions so often end in violence.
</P>
<P>
   ``Why is Condor in existence?'' said Tom Scotto, president of
Detectives Endowment Association, the union whose members fill many
of the squads. ``The fact is that the Street Crime Unit has been
decentralized, and as a result, the success of the Street Crime
Unit no longer existed and, as expected, homicides started to tick
up. There is no mystery here.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Under Condor, narcotics officers in a variety of divisions,
including the Housing Bureau, the Patrol Services Bureau and the
Narcotics Division, are asked to volunteer to work a sixth day of
the week for overtime. Generally these officers are then assigned
to work in teams in one of the several dozen precincts that have
been designated as Condor precincts because of their crime rates.
</P>
<P>
   By themselves, these squads have produced 21,445 arrests since
the program began two months ago, the police said. ``Since the
program's inception,'' Police Commissioner Howard Safir told the
City Council earlier this month, ``major crime has decreased
dramatically when compared to last year. Preliminary statistics
show weekly reductions ranging from 4 percent to over 19
percent.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In time, Safir said, ``We believe that this increased
enforcement will have an impact on the homicide rate.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   But critics say they do not believe the program will
significantly affect violent crime, because they say the narcotics
squads, under pressure to make many arrests quickly to satisfy
their bosses, have spent most of their time pursuing people for
minor offenses. Some 75 percent of the arrests under the program
have been for misdemeanors or even lesser offenses, known as
violations.
</P>
<P>
   ``It raises a question of what is the impact,'' said David
Kapner, the arraignments supervisor for the Legal Aid Society in
Manhattan.
</P>
<P>
   Kapner said that in reviewing hundreds of cases each week he
finds that the Condor arrests are typically of people who have been
caught using marijuana or another drug _ not selling them. He
estimated that as many as a third of the arrests are for offenses
like trespassing, farebeating, peddling or drinking in public. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   But police officials countered that misdemeanor arrests, far
from being trivial, are an integral part of the zero tolerance
strategy that the Giuliani administration has devised to
successfully fight crime. Deputy Chief Thomas Fahey, a police
spokesman, added that the marijuana trade is a far different
industry today than what many people might remember from the
Woodstock era.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a lot of money being made in marijuana,'' he said,
``and that is causing both street violence and homicides.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Dorismond was shot after becoming involved in a scuffle with
undercover officers who had approached him in an attempt to buy
marijuana, which he did not have. Detective Anthony Vasquez, who
fired the shot, has said through his lawyer that his gun went off
accidentally when he rushed to help an undercover who had given a
verbal signal that he was in trouble. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   At least some of the anger stirred by the death has come from
the perception that Dorismond was approached because he was black.
But police officials said race played no part. They said units are
trained to stage undercover operations where there have been
specific allegations about drug dealing. In recent years, the
training, experience level and supervision of narcotics officers
has increased, according to police officials, even as the number of
Narcotics Division officers has doubled from 1,600 in 1995 to
roughly 3,200 today. Officials would not specify the current number
of undercover officers, citing security concerns, but they said
their formal training course was expanded from two to three weeks
last summer. The average years of experience for undercover
officers has also risen to 6.3 years, from 5.8 years in 1999,
officials said.

   LEAD SHIFTS IN POLL
</P>
<P>
   After a series of tough primary battles, Gov. George W. Bush
appears to have lost his edge over his likely Democratic opponent,
Vice President Al Gore, in the race for president, a national
survey shows.
</P>
<P>
   In a poll conducted last week by the Pew Research Center for the
People and the Press, 49 percent of the registered voters surveyed
said they would vote for Gore in the general election or were
leaning toward supporting him, up from 40 percent last December.
Only 43 percent said the same for Bush, down from 55 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Gore scored especially well among the sort of voters that Sen.
John McCain of Arizona courted in his campaign, including
independents, older men and people who live on the East Coast.
Bush's standing also declined among white Catholic voters, who are
now evenly split between Bush and Gore, Pew said; in December, Bush
held a two-to-one advantage. The survey's margin of error is plus
or minus four percentage points.
</P>
<P>
   GROUP'S ADS ATTACK MICHIGAN SENATOR
</P>
<P>
   Michigan has one of the closest Senate races in the United
States, as Rep. Debbie Stabenow, a Democrat, challenges Sen.
Spencer Abraham, a freshman Republican seeking re-election. But the
heaviest political advertising right now is not by either
candidate.
</P>
<P>
   The Washington-based Federation for American Immigration Reform,
which seeks strict limits on immigration, has paid for heavy radio
and print advertising criticizing Abraham's record as chairman of
the Senate Judiciary Subcommittee on Immigration. The ads assail
the senator's support for a bill that would increase sharply the
number of visas available for companies to bring in foreign
high-technology workers.
</P>
<P>
   The senator continues to push for the legislation, which is
intended to alleviate a labor shortage that is making it harder for
companies to start new projects and that is pushing up wages for
American workers in the computer sector.
</P>
<P>
   WASHINGTON SENATE RACE IS GETTING EXPENSIVE
</P>
<P>
   Both Democrats vying in Washington state for the right to take
on Sen. Slade Gorton, the Republican incumbent, have demonstrated
an ability to generate campaign funds, but in different ways.
</P>
<P>
   After a year of solicitations, Deborah Senn, the state insurance
commissioner, recently reported that she would soon pass the $1
million mark.
</P>
<P>
   Her opponent in the Democratic primary, former U.S. Rep. Maria
Cantwell, is worth at least $12 million and has indicated that she
is willing to dip into her personal fortune to make the race.
Cantwell, who became an Internet company executive after she lost
her congressional seat in the 1994 Republican tide, announced in
January that she would run for Gorton's post. The senator himself
is attempting to amass even more than the $5.4 million he raised
for his 1994 campaign.
</P>
<P>
   A HUG FOR GORE
</P>
<P>
   While he was raising money in Detroit on Thursday, Vice
President Al Gore showed up in a taped segment on NBC's ``Tonight
Show With Jay Leno.'' Angela Ramos, who has hugged the major
presidential candidates at Leno's behest, was shown greeting and
embracing Gore at the New York Sheraton Hotel on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Ramos had hugged Gov. George W. Bush of Texas, Sen. John McCain
and former Sen. Bill Bradley while they were campaigning in
California before the March 7 primary there. NBC and the Gore
campaign finally arranged a get-together this week.
</P>
<P>
   SATURDAY'S SCHEDULES
</P>
<P>
   Neither Gov. George W. Bush nor Vice President Al Gore has
public events scheduled Saturday.

 &HT;    Jamil Al-Amin's attorney wants restrictions lifted
 &HT;    By Ernie Suggs
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   MONTGOMERY, Ala. _ Attorneys for Jamil Abdullah Al-Amin filed a
petition in the district court of Montgomery demanding that the
Muslim cleric be allowed to spend more than one hour outside of his
cell and be allowed to pray along with other Muslims who are locked
up.
</P>
<P>
   Rose Sanders, who is representing Al-Amin in Montgomery, along
with attorney J.L. Chestnut, complained to Montgomery County
District Judge Lynn Bright that Sheriff D.T. Marshall has violated
Al-Amin's right to religious expression by refusing to let him
attend Friday's prayer service with other Muslims.
</P>
<P>
   Since being captured Monday in White Hall, Al-Amin has been in
solitary confinement for 23 hours a day. The only time he is
allowed out of his 10-by-10 foot cell is to go to court or for the
one hour he can leave his cell to bathe or exercise.
</P>
<P>
   During court appearances, he has worn a stripped prison uniform
with orange slippers. He is not allowed to wear any religious garb,
including his Kofu.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Montgomery County Sheriff's Department is maliciously
impinging on Al-Amin's civil rights and human rights to religious
freedom without any reasonable or legitimate penological purpose,''
said Sanders.
</P>
<P>
   Al-Amin did get a chance to meet with his wife, Karima Al-Amin
and his brother, Ed Brown, for about 30 minutes Friday morning.
Because they drove from Atlanta early Friday morning, the two were
able to visit Al-Amin. The normal visiting day for those in
solitary confinement is Saturday from 3:30 to 4 p.m.
</P>
<P>
   The two immediately drove back to Atlanta after the visit
without commenting to a reporter.
</P>
<P>
   Al-Amin is facing murder charges in Atlanta for the shooting of
Fulton County Deputy Ricky Kinchen. Kinchen, along with his partner
Aldranon English, were shot March 16 while trying to serve Al-Amin
with an arrest warrant. Kinchen died the next afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   Al-Amin's attorneys said they were anticipating that the Fulton
county grand jury might indict Al-Amin Friday, starting the
extradition machinery rolling.
</P>
<P>
   The grand jury met on its regular schedule Friday but did not
indict Al-Amin. Fulton County prosecutors would not comment on
whether the grand jury considered Al-Amin's case Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Sanders wanted Al-Amin to be able to attend Jaamu, which is a
religious collective prayer held on Fridays, the Muslim Sabbath.
</P>
<P>
   But Larry Haverland, director of the Montgomery County Detention
Facility, where Al-Amin is being held, said Muslim prisoners have
never requested permission to pray together on Fridays and that
they generally pray alone.
</P>
<P>
   Haverland said there about 20 Muslim prisoners in the detention
center's 429-person population.
</P>
<P>
   ``As long as he is a prisoner, he will be treated just like any
other inmate,'' said Haverland.
</P>
<P>
   ``And because he is a Muslim, the food hasn't been an issue,
because we don't serve any pork products. They eat turkey baloney,
turkey ham and turkey turkey.''
</P>
<P>
   Haverland said his most famous inmate is presenting no special
concerns to the center's staff.
</P>
<P>
   ``He hasn't been a problem since he came here,'' said Haverland,
adding that Al-Amin has been eating. ``I think he has more
important things to worry about right now.''

AN IRREVERANT POKE AT RUSSIAN POLITICOS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BRIAN WHITMORE  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   MOSCOW _ A playboy president cruises Moscow's streets looking
for prostitutes and finds them in parliament. A sadomasochistic
communist, decked out in leather, begs to be hit _ hard. A virgin
liberal refuses to participate in group-sex with other politicians.
</P>
<P>
   This is how Russia's top three presidential hopefuls were
recently portrayed on national television _ on a weekly puppet show
that spoofs Russia's political leaders and has become one of the
nation's most popular television programs.
</P>
<P>
   The show, called ``Kukly'' or Puppets, has stood out in a
political season notable for its lack of humor. As most media have
slavishly praised Vladimir V. Putin, the heavy favorite to win
Sunday's election, Kukly has mercilessly lampooned the acting
president, along with the rest of Russia's elite.
</P>
<P>
   Irreverently ridiculing Russia's rich and powerful, by showing
their vanities, quirks, and idiosyncrasies, is a something Kukly
has been doing for five years. Equal opportunity humor, with
anybody in power as fair game, has earned the show a loyal
following.
</P>
<P>
   Viktor Shenderovich, the show's 42-year-old creator, said the
program seeks to keep Russia's leaders accountable.
</P>
<P>
   ``Society needs to keep the authorities under control, and I
like to think that what we do is in the interests of society,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   For many aspiring politicians, being spoofed on Kukly is a sure
sign that they have hit the big time. Others, however, are not
amused.
</P>
<P>
   A group of Putin supporters sought to have criminal charges
brought against Kukly for ``insulting the president.'' And on the
floor of Russia's parliament, some lawmakers said they were
``deeply appalled'' by the show's humor.
</P>
<P>
   Shenderovich brushed off the criticism with a sly smile.
</P>
<P>
   ``Personally, I understand that some people may be offended by
what we do,'' he said. ``But at the same time they need to
understand us. Politicians are public figures and are subject to
public evaluations of their activities.''
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton has made a few appearances. One 1998 episode
showed puppets of Clinton and former President Boris Boris Yeltsin,
both facing impeachment. In the show, Yeltsin called Clinton to
offer advice about how to deal with his unruly foes: shoot up the
legislature and put your opponents in jail.
</P>
<P>
   ``We wanted to make the point that the American president can be
held accountable for his actions and removed from office. Our
president, on the other hand, can do just about anything,''
Shenderovich said.
</P>
<P>
   The episode with Putin and the prostitutes is rooted in a
historical Russian reference. Soviet founder Vladimir Lenin was
known to call his opponents ``political prostitutes.''
</P>
<P>
   Shenderovich used the metaphor to expose what he sees as
hypocrisy among the political elite.
</P>
<P>
   Communist leader Gennady Zyuganov appeared as a puppetdecked out
in leather and chains and wielding a whip, who tried to seduce the
novice Putin.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hit me!'' Zyuganov demanded.
</P>
<P>
   ``What for?'' Putin asked.
</P>
<P>
   ``Then I'll hit you! And then you'll hit me again! Let's wear
each other out! In front of everybody, publicly!'' Zyuganov said.
</P>
<P>
   When Putin refused, parliamentary speaker Gennady Seleznyov
stepped in.
</P>
<P>
   ``You don't understand anything. You're just very young,''
Seleznyov said. ``Later, close to election time (and in private),
he'll give in to you,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   In another scene, liberal presidential candidate Grigory
Yavlinsky, who is running third in the polls, appeared as a
sanctimonious virgin.
</P>
<P>
   ``You all disgust me individually as it is. But I absolutely
refuse to take part in this group thing,'' Yavlinsky said.
</P>
<P>
   The Seleznyov puppet responded: ``You little political prude.
Been preening for five years, and won't give up a thing to
anybody.''
</P>
<P>
   The segment, Shenderovich said, was meant to demonstrate that
Yavlinsky was the only candidate really opposing Putin. At the same
time, it was a subtle dig at Yavlinsky, a prickly loner.
</P>
<P>
   Kukly broadcasts on the private NTV television station, the only
national network that has openly criticized Putin.
</P>
<P>
   NTV's stand has drawn the wrath of pro-Kremlin media. This week,
ORT television has attacked NTV and its owner, Vladimir Gusinsky,
accusing him of being an Israeli provocateur.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the attacks, Shenderovich said he wasn't afraid of
censorship under Putin. ``The most important thing,'' he said, ``is
not to show fear, because the authorities can sense this. We must
act like we are in the right, because we are right.''

2 LEADING RABBIS VOICE APPRECIATION FOR JOHN PAUL 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By GUSTAV NIEBUHR   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   When Pope John Paul II stood in silent meditation on Thursday
inside Yad Vashem, the Holocaust memorial in Jerusalem, he created
a visually riveting moment symbolic of a major theme in his
22-year-old pontificate: the establishment of healthy relations
between Roman Catholics and Jews. Those who have followed the
pope's statements know it as a concern to which he has returned
again and again.
</P>
<P>
   In an apostolic letter in 1989, for example, he reflected on the
``anti-human'' events of World War II, declaring that ``there is
one that will forever remain a shame for humanity: the planned
barbarism which was unleashed against the Jewish people.'' Two
years ago, the Vatican issued a document on the Holocaust that
repented inaction of many Catholics in the face of Nazi genocide.
</P>
<P>
   Many people, particularly Jews, remain disappointed that the
pope has declined to go so far as to apologize for the silence of
his predecessor Pius XII during the Holocaust. That aside, are not
John Paul's statements of contrition and remembrance having a
cumulative effect, working a gradual but profound change in
Catholic-Jewish relations?
</P>
<P>
   Yes, said Rabbi Eric Yoffie, president of the Union of American
Hebrew Congregations, which represents nearly 900 Reform synagogues
in the United States and Canada. ``I think it's an absolute
revolution,'' Yoffie said in an interview Friday.
</P>
<P>
   A similar response came from Rabbi Ismar Schorsch, chancellor of
the Jewish Theological Seminary, an institution of Conservative
Judaism, in New York. ``I think there's been enormous progress,''
he said. ``One just need compare the visit of Paul VI to Israel to
the visit of John Paul II. They are worlds apart.'' (Pope Paul VI,
in a very brief sojourn on Israeli soil three decades ago, never
uttered the word ``Israel.'')
</P>
<P>
   Yoffie spoke by telephone from his native Worcester, Mass.,
where he had gone to give a speech about Catholic-Jewish relations.
In that speech, at Assumption College, a Catholic institution, he
said he was distressed that in responding to the pope on previous
occasions, some Jewish leaders seemed to focus more on what the
Vatican had not done (particularly with regard to Pius XII) than on
efforts to improve interfaith relations. ``When my friend
apologizes to me for a sin he has committed,'' he said in the
speech, ``the appropriate response is for me to thank him, to
welcome his repentance and to express my desire to continue our
discussion.''
</P>
<P>
   He also said he thought that unlike those leaders, whom he did
not identify, Jews of many congregations felt positively about the
progress in Catholic-Jewish relations.
</P>
<P>
   He went on to say in his speech that Reform Judaism had fallen
behind in teaching its youth about important changes that had
occurred since the Second Vatican Council, in the 1960s, an event
whose emphasis on interfaith engagement is the foundation that John
Paul has built upon. The Reform movement, Yoffie said, will revise
religious-school textbooks to reflect ``accurately and
sympathetically'' the church's position on Jews and Judaism.
</P>
<P>
   To be sure, Yoffie remains troubled by the case of Pius XII. He
made that clear in his speech, while also saying he recognized that
some Catholics felt quite differently, believing that Pius actually
encouraged secret efforts to help Jews. Yoffie said Catholics and
Jews might soon have to recognize that they were at an impasse on
this issue. And he said he regarded the possibility that the church
might move to declare Pius a saint to be a religious matter
internal to the church.
</P>
<P>
   But as a way to frame the discussions about canonizing Pius, he
proposed that Catholic and Jewish theologians sit down together to
talk about the standards for righteous conduct in a time of evil.
</P>
<P>
   ``Are we to assume at such a time that anyone who is not totally
evil can be called righteous?'' Yoffie said in the speech. ``Or are
we to assume exactly the opposite: that anyone fighting evil in an
evil time has to be particularly good? The relevance of these
questions to the Nazi era is immediately apparent.''
</P>
<P>
   As for Schorsch, he noted that the present pope had experienced
the Nazi era directly, as a young seminarian in Poland. John Paul
grew up with Jewish neighbors and schoolmates. Jews, who numbered
more than 3 million in prewar Poland, ``were not an abstraction to
him, as they must have been to so many Italian popes,'' Schorsch
said. ``The Nazi trauma'' is a source ``of his empathy for Jews,''
the rabbi said, and of ``his courage in taking the church so far in
its progress.''
</P>
<P>
   Schorsch said he regarded John Paul's visit to Yad Vashem as a
climactic ``expression of a personal mission.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the pattern of efforts of reconciliation,'' he added,
``is unmistakable and cumulative.''

COMMENTARY: SMALL STATUES AND TALL TALES 
</HEADLINE>
  (lh) 
 By JOHN TIERNEY   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Should a movie that claims to be a true story get an
Oscar even though it's not true? If you think not, you have plenty
to root against Sunday. But you would be missing the big picture.
</P>
<P>
   Sure, you can quibble with ``Music From the Heart,'' in which a
white violin teacher and black principal in Harlem battle hostile
parents and lazy teachers to introduce classical music to students
in a violence-ridden cultural wasteland. In reality, it was a
peaceful, highly regarded school with a white principal, supported
by enthusiastic parents and teachers. The real students were
putting on operas before the violin teacher arrived.
</P>
<P>
   Sure, the tobacco-industry whistle-blower in ``The Insider''
might not have been threatened as shown in the movie. A scene of
his being tailed by a shadowy figure is pure invention. A bullet
was indeed found in his mailbox, as shown, but an FBI investigator
and the whistle-blower's wife at the time say he planted it
himself. Mike Wallace of ``60 Minutes'' says he's misquoted and
misrepresented.
</P>
<P>
   And sure, ``Hurricane'' may distort the legal case and include
pure fantasies. The real Rubin Carter was not robbed of the
middleweight boxing title by a racist decision. (He lost fair and
square.) The movie's racist detective obsessed with framing Carter
for murder never existed, as the director freely concedes.
</P>
<P>
   But why nitpick? Why criticize producers who would otherwise
spend all their money on ordinary fiction? The more ``true
stories'' they pay for, the more they spread Hollywood's wealth
across America. And the more creative they become, the more hope
for all of us.
</P>
<P>
   I once despaired of selling my life to the movies. My reporting
had never saved a life, rescued a city or put me in mortal danger.
An article against recycling had angered some environmental groups
and provoked a lot of angry letters, and a carton of smelly
garbage, but that didn't seem to be enough for a movie.
</P>
<P>
   Now, however, I know better. With the right director, someone
who understands Hollywood's concept of ``higher truth,'' I could be
sitting at next year's Oscar ceremony watching scenes from my
life's story. Call it ``The Heart of the Cyclone.''
</P>
<P>
   Fade in to suburban schoolchildren being forced by their
teacher, a stern but beautiful brunette, to sort bottles into
recycling bins. One child coughs and collapses, followed by others.
Watching from the parking lot is Joao Tierneiro, a tall, elegant
ebony-skinned Brazilian-American journalist.
</P>
<P>
   He befriends one student, a sad but savvy homeless child. They
steal a bottle from the recycling bin and discover it harbors
deadly bacteria. Tierneiro, nicknamed Cyclone for his writing
speed, stays up all night typing and carries his scoop to New York
Times executives planning the next day's front page.
</P>
<P>
   The meeting is run by the ruthless director of advertising, who
barks orders: ``We need room on A1 for that puff piece on the auto
industry. Kill the Middle East story _ those countries aren't
buying full pages.'' He sneers at Cyclone's article. ``Recycling
industry threatens millions? Kid, their ads pay your salary.''
</P>
<P>
   He crumples the article and orders it buried in The New York
Times Magazine, where it is slashed to 8,000 words by an editor
bigoted against Brazilians. But even that doesn't satisfy Big Can,
the unholy alliance of recycling companies and environmentalists.
In a blood-curdling pre-dawn scene, Cyclone is awakened by a death
threat, the sound of glass ominously splintering inside a recycling
truck outside his apartment. He stumbles to the window in time to
see two mysterious hooded figures speeding away on the truck.
</P>
<P>
   Cyclone goes into hiding in the cardboard box of the homeless
student. The boy carries the article to their last hope, the Nobel
Prize committee. The judges are about to give Cyclone the first
combined prize for medicine and peace when the meeting is
interrupted by the two hooded figures, now revealed as
environmentalists with the Natural Resources Defense Council. The
thugs hold shards of contaminated glass to the necks of the judges,
who dutifully change their votes.
</P>
<P>
   In despair, Cyclone visits the boy's teacher. Romance ensues.
She lets the students skip recycling one day for another
after-school activity that they learn from Cyclone. It's a sport
from his homeland never before seen by the suburbanites, soccer,
which quickly becomes so popular that it replaces recycling. All
the students recover their health, and the homeless boy moves in
with Cyclone and the teacher. They all gleefully toss bottles into
the regular garbage as the credits roll.

US AIRWAYS NEGOTIATORS TRY TO AVERT STOPPAGE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MATTHEW BRELIS AND GREGG KRUPA  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   US Airways management and flight attendants negotiated into the
night late Friday in an effort to reach a settlement in a contract
dispute, and avoid a shutdown of the airline, which would cripple
travel along the East Coast.
</P>
<P>
   The airline sent letters Friday to all 42,000 employees
regarding reporting to work in the event of a shutdown, and said
that ``almost all employees will be busy with activities related to
the shutdown.''
</P>
<P>
   The AFL-CIO president, John Sweeney, issued a statement saying
he hoped an agreement could be reached, but said the US Airways
demand for concessions from flight attendants was ``not only
unacceptable; it is absolutely unconscionable.'' He added that the
labor federation was ready to assist the flight attendants in any
way it could.
</P>
<P>
   Airport officials were preparing for the worst.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're planning for a complete shutdown of the air carrier,''
said Thomas Kinton, aviation director for Massport, which operates
Logan International Airport in Boston . ``We're hoping that does
not occur. We hope that the parties can come to some kind of mutual
agreement.''
</P>
<P>
   In some cities, such as Philadelphia and Pittsburgh, the airline
has well over 50 percent of the market.
</P>
<P>
   While other major carriers have said they would honor US Airways
tickets on a space-available basis, Kinton said many airlines had
little space available out of Boston.
</P>
<P>
   ``The concern we have, obviously, is that there is not a lot of
excess capacity in the aviation system. There are not a lot of
extra airplanes that can be put into a market to take care of that
kind of demand, nor are there a lot of excess seats available in
the market. A lot of the carriers who fly in and out of here are
close to booked if not overbooked.''
</P>
<P>
   There was a little softening in negotiations when the company
agreed to discuss alternative formulas for reaching parity plus 1
percent with the big four airlines _ United, American, Delta and
Northwest.
</P>
<P>
   Other unions representing USAir workers have agreed to that pay
scheme, but the flight attendants say that the company's offer
would result in an erosion of their pay and benefits.
</P>
<P>
   To remain competitive, grow domestically and internationally, US
Airways management has said it must control operating costs _ which
are the highest in the industry in part because after a series of
mergers in the 1970s and 1980s, workers were able to keep the best
parts of many different contracts.
</P>
<P>
   But the more than 9,000 flight attendants have been working
without a new contract for three years and want raises and better
pensions. While the airline has lost money in the past two quarters
and will probably be in the red for the first two quarters of this
year, it turned a profit of more than $1.5 billion in 1997 and
1998.
</P>
<P>
   A month ago, management said it would shut down the airline, the
busiest carrier along the East Coast, rather than subject
passengers to the uncertainty of flights in the face of wildcat
walkouts threatened by flight attendants starting Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   Airline analysts said a shutdown would cost the airline at least
$15 million a day; flight attendants have put the figure at $30
million. US Airways said it would pay the salaries of employees
other than flight attendants for as long as possible. It has more
than $800 million in cash and has drawn down a $500 million line of
credit.
</P>
<P>
   But in addition to payroll, the airline also has to continue to
pay for airplanes _ it is under contract with Airbus Industrie to
accept about one new plane every week _ and continue to rent space
at airports.
</P>
<P>
   A shutdown would cause massive disruptions in travel in the
Northeast, where US Airways operates a Boston-LaGuardia-Washington
shuttle as Philadelphia and Pittsburgh as hubs.
</P>
<P>
   Massport's Kinton said that he was contacted Friday by the
federal Department of Transportation. ``They are going to be
contacting certain airports _ Boston is one of them _ over the next
two days to get a report on the disruptions that may be occurring
at this airport. So they want to be kept abreast of any of the
problems. They want to know how we are coping.''
</P>
<P>
   If there is a shutdown, President Clinton can create an
emergency board that would investigate and report on the labor
dispute and make recommendations for a settlement. The creation of
a board would stop any strike or lockout, generally for 60 days.
Aviation officials said it is not considered likely that Clinton
would act immediately, if at all.
</P>
<P>
   Kinton said that in the event of a shutdown, extra Massport
staff would be in front of ticket counters at Terminal C where
Delta Airlines is located and Terminal A where the Delta Shuttle
and Continental are located.
</P>
<P>
   ``We expect those two terminals to feel the brunt of this
shutdown, should it occur, because, obviously, the Delta Shuttle
and Continental have frequent service to the New York and Newark
area, and Terminal C, where Delta airlines has frequent service to
Florida,'' Kinton said. ``The Florida markets will be heavily
impacted with the US Airways shutdown of service here in Boston.''
</P>
<P>
   The airline is expected to staff its ticket counters at Terminal
B to accommodate passengers and have its mechanics do maintenance
work on the fleet if the planes are grounded.

 &HT;    Turner grants helping preserve
 &HT;    By Don Melvin
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _When the latest recipients of Ted Turner's global
giving were announced earlier this week, public attention focused
on the showiest package of grants _ more than $6 million to help
fight the spread of AIDS in southern Africa.
</P>
<P>
   But also included were funds for a cause dear to Turner's heart:
the environment. Grants went to identify areas in need of
international protection and to promote energy conservation in
China.
</P>
<P>
   Turner's philanthropic interests, clearly, are not limited to
fighting disease, poverty and war. His lifelong enjoyment of the
outdoors as a yachtsman, rancher and fisherman has led to a deep
appreciation of the environment. And that appreciation has been
deep enough to prompt him to reach into his pockets to try to help
protect the environment around the world.
</P>
<P>
   ``If anything happens to the environment, there's not going to
be any human race,'' Turner said in an interview. ``We depend on
the environment. It's absolutely imperative that we have a healthy
environment if we're going to have a healthy human race.''
</P>
<P>
   The latest grants were announced Thursday by the U.N.
Foundation, set up to disburse Turner's gift of $1 billion over 10
years to United Nations projects. It was the sixth round of grants
awarded since the foundation was created just over two years ago.
</P>
<P>
   In the past, public attention has been paid to grants aimed at
eradicating polio, controlling population growth, giving loans to
poor women and reintegrating child soldiers into their homes,
schools and villages.
</P>
<P>
   But every round of grants has also included money for
environmental projects, such as controlling ``invasive species'' in
the Galapagos Islands or protecting wildlife parks in the
Democratic Republic of Congo while the country is at war.
</P>
<P>
   That, of course, is by design.
</P>
<P>
   After Turner, the Atlanta businessman who founded CNN and is
vice chairman of Time Warner, announced in 1997 that he would
donate $1 billion to U.N. projects, he decided that, to have the
greatest impact, he would focus on three areas: improving the
health of children, controlling population growth while empowering
women and protecting the environment.
</P>
<P>
   In the last two years, the foundation has given away more than
$237 million of Turner's money. About 18 percent _ more than $42
million _ has gone to 31 environmental projects.
</P>
<P>
   Among the grants so far:
</P>
<P>
   $1.5 million to assess coral reef degradation around the globe.
</P>
<P>
   $4 million to protect native species in the Galapagos Islands
from ``invasive species'' such as pigs and rats.
</P>
<P>
   $500,000 to develop an electronic U.N. Atlas of the Oceans to
track threats to the marine environment.
</P>
<P>
   At this pace, by the end of the 10 years the foundation will
have awarded $180 million of Turner's wealth to efforts to protect
the environment around the world.
</P>
<P>
   In general, Turner has been using his gift to induce the U.N. to
improve in areas he finds important. For example, cooperation among
different U.N. agencies has often been difficult to achieve in the
past; the U.N. Foundation seeks to change that by frequently
awarding grants to proposals developed by two or more U.N. agencies
working together.
</P>
<P>
   That is also the approach with the environmental projects.
</P>
<P>
   ``The U.N. has been relatively weak in the environmental area,''
Turner said. ``But they do have an environmental component, and we
want to encourage that component. And that's why we're making these
grants.''
</P>
<P>
   The foundation's grants focus largely on slowing global warming
and preserving diverse species, two areas that were agreed upon as
important by participants in the 1992 U.N.-sponsored Rio Earth
Summit, said Nicholas Lapham, a program officer with the U.N.
Foundation.
</P>
<P>
   Because the U.N. Foundation is accountable only to its board _
and board chairman Ted Turner _ it can make grants that other
organizations might deem too risky.
</P>
<P>
   Last November, the foundation gave $2.9 million over four years
to the U.N. Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization,
known as UNESCO, to help five wildlife areas survive the current
multi-nation war in the Democratic Republic of Congo.
</P>
<P>
   The parks are home to some of the world's rarest large mammals,
such as the northern white rhinoceros, Grauer's gorilla and the
okapi.
</P>
<P>
   All the parks are designated by UNESCO as World Heritage sites,
worthy of international protection. Four of the five are in the
eastern part of Congo, and staff members, who are employees of the
Congolese government, have not been paid since 1998, said Natarajan
Ishwaran, a senior program specialist with UNESCO World Heritage
Center.
</P>
<P>
   Yet they continue to show up, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's amazing to see how dedicated these people are to the
sites,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Threats to the parks abound, said Terese Hart, an official with
the Wildlife Conservation Society. She works at one of the parks,
the Okapi Wildlife Reserve.
</P>
<P>
   ``Right now the guards have control over less than half of the
reserve,'' Hart said. ``There is heavy poaching in these areas.
Particularly notable is killing of elephants _ at least 11
elephants were killed just in January and February. There is also a
fair amount of small-scale mining.''
</P>
<P>
   In some cases, rebel groups are thought to have actually set up
military operations on protected park land, said Ishwaran.
</P>
<P>
   Turner's money will be used to pay park employees' salaries and
for equipment, training and monitoring of the species in the
reserves, he said. After the war has ended, tourist revenue from
the parks will be needed to help rebuild the economy, he added.
</P>
<P>
   Most other donors were not interested in making environmental
investments in a war zone, Ishwaran said. ``The main reason is the
risk,'' he said. ``There are so many groups, you don't know who is
loyal to what. There can be a lot of accidental things, because you
don't know who is fighting each other.''
</P>
<P>
   But the risk did not deter the U.N. Foundation.
</P>
<P>
   ``Basically, you know, the U.N. Foundation, like the U.N.
itself, is about risk, to a degree,'' said Turner. ``When the U.N.
sends peacekeepers into a place like Kosovo, they take a risk. I
mean, life is about risk.''
</P>
<P>
   Now other donors are beginning to follow the U.N. Foundation's
example, Hart said. The U.S. Agency for International Development
and the European Union have begun targeting money for the parks in
Congo, she said.
</P>
<P>
   Turner said he is working to develop an even more important
environmental proposal _ one that he cannot do through the U.N.
Foundation. The foundation always works through United Nations
agencies, which are governed, in large measure, by the world's
nuclear powers.
</P>
<P>
   In this case, Turner said, he is working through the Turner
Foundation, a domestic philanthropic organization he set up years
ago, to launch a ``major initiative to get nuclear weapons back on
the global agenda.''
</P>
<P>
   The issue has been downplayed since the end of the Cold War, he
said, but there is no greater threat to the environment.
</P>
<P>
   ``It turns out that the United States and Russia have 6,000
warheads on hair-trigger alerts pointed at each other around the
clock all the time, and it's a very dangerous situation,'' Turner
said. ``There could be an accident or somebody could go mad and
push a button somewhere and annihilate us all. You know, just when
we thought it was safe to come out of our bomb shelters.''

GIVING AWAY THE ENDING AT THE OSCARS? SHOCKING.  
 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, MARCH 26) 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 By FELICITY BARRINGER   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service

<P>
   It had been weeks, or at least days, since journalists last
found themselves besieged by accusations of Peeping-Tomism,
prurience, piling on or general tawdriness. But on Friday, some
were at it again.
</P>
<P>
   Flying in the face of accusations that it was spoiling
everyone's fun, The Wall Street Journal published the results of a
poll on which actors and movies are likely to win Oscars.
</P>
<P>
   This was not a list of critics' picks or consensus of such
informal oddsmaking like office pools, mind you.
</P>
<P>
   No, Journal reporters gathered the putative picks of 356 of the
5,607 voting members of the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and
Sciences, the people whose votes award the Oscars. The ceremonies
are Sunday night.
</P>
<P>
   To academy officials, this was the equivalent of someone
releasing exit-poll results before the voting precincts had closed.
Once word of what the newspaper was up to got out, Bruce Davis, the
academy's director, told his membership in a letter quoted in
Friday's Journal that the poll was ``a threat to the Academy Awards
process.''
</P>
<P>
   In this case, though, publication of the results could not
discourage voting for the Oscars, which finished at 5 p.m.
Thursday, long before the Weekend Journal came out on Friday. But
it sure could poke a hole in the suspense that keeps people up _
and tuned in _ on Oscar night.
</P>
<P>
   Hollywood was indignant, in its way, at The Journal's
undertaking, questioning the poll's methodology and the newspaper's
intent.
</P>
<P>
   ``Anything goes in journalism these days, even at The Wall
Street Journal,'' sighed Anita Busch, editor of The Hollywood
Reporter, in an interview on Friday. Journalism, she added, ``has
gone into a yellow age.''
</P>
<P>
   Vickee Adams, director of corporate communications for Dow
Jones, the paper's publisher, defended the poll. ``It is not a
scientific study. It's a best and educated guess _ a fun look at
some of the top six awards.''
</P>
<P>
   But would The Journal turn the same level of scrutiny on the
process by which journalists are awarded Pulitzer Prizes? ``As with
any story that may or may not appear in The Wall Street Journal, I
cannot give you a response on that,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   So, what, exactly, did The Journal's poll find?
</P>
<P>
   That ``American Beauty'' was the clear favorite for Best
Picture. Respondents gave Denzel Washington a thin lead over Kevin
Spacey for Best Actor and Hilary Swank a wider lead over Annette
Bening for Best Actress. Michael Caine got double the number of
votes as Haley Joel Osment in the Best Supporting Actor category,
and Angelina Jolie seemed the favorite for Best Supporting Actress.

PENTAGON ADMITS `DON'T ASK' POLICY ISN'T WORKING 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JOHN DONNELLY  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The Pentagon acknowledged Friday that its ``don't
ask, don't tell'' policy for gays needs to be carried out better,
after an extensive survey revealed widespread hostility to
homosexuals on bases and aboard ships and submarines.
</P>
<P>
   A Pentagon inspector general's report found that 85 percent of
the servicemen and women surveyed believed that antigay comments
were tolerated on their base. The report called offensive comments
about gays commonplace.
</P>
<P>
   Thirty-seven percent said they had personally witnessed or been
the target of harassment because of perceived homosexuality.
</P>
<P>
   Based on surveys of 71,500 members of the Army, Air Force, Navy,
and Marine Corps, the report declared that the Clinton
administration's ``don't ask, don't tell'' policy has not worked.
President Clinton himself had recently said the policy, enacted in
1993, was now ``out of whack.''
</P>
<P>
   The report, ordered by Defense Secretary William S. Cohen in
December after the bludgeoning death last July of a gay Army
private at Fort Campbell, Ky., now puts the onus on base commanders
to end the verbal and physical abuse of gays.
</P>
<P>
   ``This behavior is not acceptable and can't be tolerated in the
military,'' Pentagon spokesman Kenneth H. Bacon told reporters
Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Cohen announced he would form a committee of military and
civilian officials to create measures that would improve how the
policy is carried out.
</P>
<P>
   ``The inspector general's report convinces me that additional
actions are necessary to address the problem of harassment of
service members who are alleged or perceived to be homosexual,''
Cohen said in a memorandum to the services.
</P>
<P>
   The policy says gays and lesbians may serve in the military, as
long as they keep their sexual orientation to themselves. The
policy bars those who are openly homosexual from the military and
says harassment or violence toward other service members will not
be tolerated.
</P>
<P>
   The defense secretary also said in his memo: ``The report shows
that military leaders must do more to make it clear that harassment
based on sexual orientation violates military values.''
</P>
<P>
   Among the survey's findings, which were conducted on 38 US bases
and aboard 10 Navy ships and one submarine:
</P>
<P>
   --Most of the harassment was done by junior enlisted men to
other junior enlisted men.
</P>
<P>
   --Some 73 percent who said that when a ``senior person'' had
witnessed harassment, the senior person did nothing to stop it.
</P>
<P>
   --Eighty percent said they had heard offensive speech or jokes
or derogatory names or remarks about gays in the past year.
</P>
<P>
   --The offensive behavior was reported most frequently in the
Marine Corps and least frequently in the Air Force.
</P>
<P>
   --Nine percent said they had witnessed physical assaults of
gays.
</P>
<P>
   --Less than 50 percent said they had received training on the
``don't ask, don't tell'' policy.
</P>
<P>
   --About 50 percent of all service members surveyed said they
believed the policy was at least moderately effective at reducing
harassment of gays; 46 percent believed it was not effective.
</P>
<P>
   C. Dixon Osburn, co-executive director of Servicemembers Legal
Defense Network, which has helped represent about 2,200 service
members since the ``don't ask, don't tell'' policy was enacted,
called the findings ``very significant.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We need commanders in the field to stop the harassment when
they see it and hold people accountable when they see it,'' Osburn
said. ``The commander in the field now has support from the very,
very top of the Pentagon.''
</P>
<P>
   Osburh said his group has received 982 reports of incidents of
harassment against gays in the service in 1999, up from 400 the
year before, a 142 percent increase.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've been saying for a long time that antigay harassment is a
huge problem in the military,'' he said. ``The position of the
Pentagon for the last few years was that it wasn't a problem. Today
they quite clearly changed their position.''
</P>
<P>
   Representative Martin T. Meehan, a Lowell Democrat, said he
hoped that ``Secretary Cohen's comments set a tone for the whole
military chain of command.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Anti-gay harassment will disappear when it's no longer
tolerated,'' Meehan said.
</P>
<P>
   Pentagon officials Friday acknowledged that the current policy
gives no specific guidelines to those in the military on what would
be considered offensive and what needed to be reported to
superiors.
</P>
<P>
   ``That is, I think, always a judgment for the service member,''
said Frank Rush, deputy undersecretary of defense for planning in
personnel and readiness. ``But this may be something that needs to
be addressed.''
</P>
<P>
   But Rush grew defensive when asked about the lack of policy
directives, saying: ``What we've been focusing on today
specifically, (is) on the issue of offensive speech, which is
always going to be a problem with junior members, and harassment. .
. . There are a number of areas where we are always dealing with
harassment of one type or another, whether it has to do with sexual
orientation or whether it has to do with other matters.''
</P>
<P>
   The survey was conducted from Jan. 24 to Feb. 11. The committee
examining the ``don't ask, don't tell'' policy will report to Cohen
by July 31.

WARREN MAGEE, 91, A LAWYER IN UNPOPULAR CASES 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By PAUL LEWIS   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Warren Egbert Magee, a lawyer who represented Nazi war
criminals, corrupt politicians, and Sen. Joseph McCarthy, died on
Feb. 25 in Washington. He was 91.
</P>
<P>
   Magee represented the last seven Nazi war criminals condemned to
death at the Nuremberg trials and then hanged after World War II.
Another client was Baron Ernst von Weizsaecker, state secretary to
the German Foreign Office and the Nazis' ambassador to the Vatican.
</P>
<P>
   In 1949 Magee failed to save Rep. Andrew May, D-Ky., who was
chairman of the House Military Affairs Committee during World War
II, from a prison sentence for bribery and corruption, though
President Harry S. Truman later pardoned him.
</P>
<P>
   Magee acted for the anti-communist crusader McCarthy, R-Wis., in
the $2 million libel suit that McCarthy brought against Sen.
William Benton, D-Conn., charging that Benton had slandered him by
calling for his removal from the Senate. But in 1954 McCarthy
dropped his action.
</P>
<P>
   Magee's willingness to represent unpopular defendants stemmed
from his enjoyment of testing the law's limits, his daughter,
Dianne M. Nordyke, told The Washington Post. ``He was a lawyer
first,'' Nordyke said.
</P>
<P>
   A native of Washington, Magee graduated in 1929 from what is now
American University's Law School and was admitted to the District
of Columbia bar in 1930. After working at the Justice Department,
he entered private practice in 1938, forming what later became the
firm of Magee &AMP; Bulow. He retired in the late 1980s.
</P>
<P>
   In 1946 and 1947, Magee tried to save the last major Nazi war
criminals from death for crimes against humanity, sentences imposed
by the International Military Tribunal in Nuremberg, Germany. Those
condemned to die, all former senior officers in the SS, included
Oswald Pohl, blamed for the destruction of the Warsaw Ghetto and
the killing or deportation of more than 56,000 Jews; Otto
Ohlendorf, responsible for the murder of some 90,000 people; and
Paul Blobel, convicted of ordering the deaths of 60,000 Jews.
</P>
<P>
   Magee delayed their executions until 1951 with a barrage of
appeals in the U.S. courts. In one instance, by arguing that the
United States was bound to respect the new West German
Constitution, which banned the death penalty, he won a reprieve
after the condemned men's wives had paid what they were told would
be their last visit.
</P>
<P>
   On June 6, 1951, the U.S. Supreme Court refused to grant any
further stays of execution. The next day the seven prisoners were
hanged in the courtyard of Landsberg prison in Bavaria. They were
the last of the 275 World War II criminals executed by the United
States.
</P>
<P>
   In 1948 Magee was back in Nuremberg to represent von
Weizsaecker, one of 21 Nazi diplomats and officials accused of
lesser war crimes. Magee argued that his client had sought to brake
the excesses of his Nazi superiors.
</P>
<P>
   Von Weizsaecker was sentenced to seven years' imprisonment, but
Magee later succeeded in getting this reduced to five years.
</P>
<P>
   In his book ``Hitler's Pope: The Secret History of Pius XII''
(Viking, 1999), the British historian John Cornwell paints a
reasonably creditable picture of the baron, saying his great fear
was that moves against the Italian Jews would be an unbearable
strain on the pope's promise of impartiality toward the war.
</P>
<P>
   Magee's propensity for representing unpopular and difficult
clients made him a natural choice to represent McCarthy in his 1953
libel suit against Benton, who had called McCarthy a corrupt liar
who deserved to be expelled from the Senate.
</P>
<P>
   In his 1976 book ``Men Against McCarthy,'' Richard M. Fried of
Illinois University, paraphrasing von Clausewitz, said that the two
senators regarded the court case as ``politics carried on by other
means'' and sought to politicize the hearings. Benton even
suggested calling Winston Churchill to testify.
</P>
<P>
   As that year's presidential election campaign heated up, Judge
Matthew McGuire of the District of Columbia U.S. District Court
decided to delay his ruling on disputed points in the case ``for
some little time,'' which meant until after the election. When
Benton lost his Senate seat that November, McCarthy decided there
was no point in pursuing the litigation, which risked doing him
more harm than good.
</P>
<P>
   Magee appeared in several other unusual cases.
</P>
<P>
   In 1947 he represented the publisher Douglas MacCollum Stewart
on perjury charges arising from an accusation that he had accepted
money from the German charge d'affaires in Washington in the early
days of World War II to finance a magazine urging the United States
to keep out of the war.
</P>
<P>
   In 1950 he represented Louis P. Lochner and Frank E. Mason, who
had compiled the book ``The Goebbels Diaries,'' based on the
presumed papers of the Nazi leader Joseph Goebbels, papers that
Russian troops in Berlin had ordered a junk book dealer to remove
from the ruins of the Propaganda Ministry in 1946. The U.S.
government contended that the papers were war loot and that any
profits made from a book based on them should go toward war
reparations.
</P>
<P>
   Magee is survived by his second wife, Leslie Magee, and two
children from his marriage to Sue Mayfield Wren, who died in 1946.

THE IDEA THAT ALMOST GOT AWAY  
 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, MARCH 26) 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 By ANDREA ADELSON   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Nine years after patenting a helicopter-deployed fishing net,
Kent Thomas finally went fishing last month in New Zealand's Bay of
Plenty.
</P>
<P>
   Thomas, a veteran helicopter pilot, used a specially designed
net to encircle a cloud of fish called trevally. The fish had
little to fear, though, because the net's closure mechanism failed.
Thomas had been waiting six months for the right fishing conditions
while his net sat idle at an airfield; unknown to him, grass had
grown through some of the lines and snarled them.
</P>
<P>
   Disappointments and delays don't faze Thomas, an entrepreneur
who has nursed his idea for an environmentally friendly fishing net
with persistence, self-sacrifice and a willingness to change
course.
</P>
<P>
   Even though it failed to capture any fish, the ``drop net''
developed by Thomas' Ocean Friendly Co. of Signal Hill, Calif., is
described by some people in the fishing world as a breakthrough.
Moreover, fishing regulators, who helped finance the net, consider
it an economically and environmentally promising alternative for an
industry facing restrictions on more and more declining species.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the first real innovative fishing technique in
decades,'' said James M. Meehan, a tuna biologist for the National
Marine Fisheries Service, which imposed curbs last April on coastal
catches of shark, Atlantic tuna and marlin.
</P>
<P>
   When dropped from a helicopter, the net forms a sort of
mid-ocean aquarium. A 38-foot-wide hexagonal ring of floats
supports a strong, light cylindrical net weighted at the bottom.
Five tons of fish may be caught when the three-story cylinder is
twisted closed.
</P>
<P>
   In earlier tests, the net had closed properly, but in empty
water. The latest test failed to trap fish permanently, but it did
show how they would react inside the enclosure.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was an unknown,'' Thomas, 54, said in a telephone interview
from New Zealand. ``They were just swimming; they didn't have a
clue!''
</P>
<P>
   As a boy growing up on California's Santa Catalina Island, he
saw firsthand the collapse of sport fishing as commercial fleets
depleted the waters of bait fish. After serving in Vietnam as an
Army helicopter pilot, he flew commercially, spotting fish for tuna
boats.
</P>
<P>
   Wasteful methods _ the indiscriminate killing of juvenile fish
and protected species along with the desired catch in mile-long
purse seine nets _ galvanized him.
</P>
<P>
   He designed a net to improve a boat's yield of a single species.
Traditional nets kill the fish they snare, but the drop net keeps
them alive, allowing unwanted fish to be sorted out and returned to
the sea.
</P>
<P>
   And though the net's potential volume is less than that of
traditional nets, its live catch is suitable for aquariums, sea
farming or demanding sushi chefs, and thus has higher value.
</P>
<P>
   The concept was endorsed by the executive director of the
Inter-American Tropical Tuna Commission in La Jolla, Calif., which
sets fishing limits in the eastern Pacific.
</P>
<P>
   Ocean Friendly got a $170,000 federal research grant for the
project, one of the few backed annually by the Commerce Department.
Reducing the ``bycatch'' _ unintended netting of dolphins, sea
turtles and other species _ is a top concern of the agency's
National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're just funding the best of the best,'' said Joseph M.
Bishop, a Commerce official. ``Japan is at the cutting edge,''
using infrared imaging devices to seek the birds and dolphins that
are a telltale sign of tuna, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Ocean Friendly's prototype nets, finished in September 1998 by
Ocean Spar Technologies, a Seattle maker of sea cages, met a chilly
reception from American fishermen.
</P>
<P>
   Thomas thinks that an unwillingness to try new methods unraveled
a pledge by a Tacoma, Wash., shipowner to permit a crucial sea
trial of the drop net from one of its tuna trawlers. When the
company stopped returning his calls, Tom Meneghini, an Ocean
Friendly vice president, met the boat as it pulled into dock in
Guam in December 1998.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no way that drop net is coming aboard,'' the boat
captain told him, according to a report Ocean Friendly filed with
the Commerce Department.
</P>
<P>
   The fishing company's president, Joseph S. Martinac, said a
trial was aborted over potential liability issues as well as the
skipper's reluctance. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   As Ocean Friendly scrambled for another option, and the money to
pay for a demonstration, Commerce officials agreed to let the net
be tested outside American waters. Thomas settled on New Zealand,
where migrating fish often school close to land; he calculated that
a helicopter could carry a net a few miles from shore; no reluctant
boat captains would be involved.
</P>
<P>
   Tangled lines did not figure in his thinking, however. Nor did
running out of money. When the grant ended in September, Thomas
tapped some of his 28 private investors. For his personal needs,
his sister lent him $400. He raised $4,000 by selling his
Volkswagen van.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm always concerned he's going to starve to death,'' said
Leon La Porte, a commerce official. ``We funded him as far as we
can,'' he said, adding that Thomas has resisted fresh rounds of
venture capital to avoid ceding control.
</P>
<P>
   Other governments may help. The Green Party of New Zealand wants
the minister of fisheries to consider support for Ocean Friendly
and has scheduled a presentation. Indonesia, which granted Ocean
Friendly fishing licenses, has also asked for a presentation from
Thomas.
</P>
<P>
   But none of this is certain. ``I'm having difficulty getting a
read on the potential for support from the governments of New
Zealand and Indonesia,'' Meneghini said. ``They are long shots, in
my opinion.''
</P>
<P>
   During the years that Thomas has been proving his concept, new
methods for managing fish resources have been emerging _ a change
that could benefit his company. Besides the familiar Norwegian
salmon farms, aquaculture is taking hold in countries like the
Philippines, Australia and Japan.
</P>
<P>
   Gary F. Loverich, chairman and senior engineer of Ocean Spar,
says the drop net _ which his company made for $18,000 _ is a
reasonable fit with aquaculture, particularly for countries short
of cash. ``You don't have to buy big boats,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Loverich figures that Ocean Spar will soon be making Ocean
Friendly nets. ``This would not have happened without Kent,'' he
said. ``He's got a PhD in tenacity.''

   MICROSOFT SAID TO OFFER PLAN TO SETTLE ANTITRUST CASE
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft presented a proposal in an attempt to settle the
antitrust case filed by the Justice Department and 19 states
against the company. Lawyers were studying the plan to decide
whether it was promising enough to warrant weekend negotiations.
</P>
<P>
   Representatives of the government said Microsoft agreed to
restrain some of its business practices but the document contained
so many technical details that they could not analyze it quickly.
Judge Richard A. Posner, chief judge of the U.S. Court of Appeals

   A volatile week on Wall Street ended quietly, as the Dow Jones

composite index crept closer to the record it set earlier in March.
The Dow was down 7.14 points, to 11,112.72, while the Nasdaq rose
22.42 points, to 4,963.03. The Standard &AMP; Poor's 500-stock index
rose 0.11 point, to 1,527.46. The real action Friday was in the
bond market, with the price of the benchmark 30-year Treasury bond
falling, sending the bond's yield, which moves in the opposite
direction from its price, up to 5.99 percent from 5.91 percent on
Thursday.

<P>
   DENVER _ He pushed hard for gun control measures, which failed,
and for educational reforms, which are expected to pass later this
month. But when Colorado's legislative session has ended, the
lasting impression of Gov. Bill Owens, a first-term Republican,
could be of a battle he fought outside the House and Senate
chambers.
</P>
<P>
   For reasons not entirely clear, Owens has injected himself into
the murder investigation of JonBenet Ramsey, the 6-year-old girl
who was found beaten and strangled in the basement of her home in
Boulder more than three years ago. While Boulder investigators
placed the girl's parents, John and Patsy Ramsey, under an
``umbrella of suspicion'' early on, Owens has made it clear that he
believed that the police were looking in the right direction to
solve the murder.
</P>
<P>
   In a news conference last October, he said the Ramseys should
stop hiding behind lawyers and advisers and return to Colorado from
their home in Atlanta to answer questions. The Ramseys, contending
an intruder killed their child, responded in their new book, ``The
Death of Innocence,'' criticizing Owens as acting on political
impulse alone.
</P>
<P>
   Owens shot back this week, repeating his call for the Ramseys to
face investigators and telling ABC's ``Good Morning America'' that
``the focus on this case is really on Patsy Ramsey.''
</P>
<P>
   No one else involved with the case has come so close publicly to
naming a possible suspect.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of people have been talking about it,'' state Sen.
Michael F. Feeley, a Democrat who is minority leader, said of
Owens' sparring with the Ramseys. ``It has been the subject of a
lot of discussion around here.''
</P>
<P>
   Since his appearance on ``Good Morning America,'' Owens has
declined to discuss the matter. His spokesman, Dick Wadhams, said
the governor challenged the Ramseys in October because his youngest
child, Brett, was born the same year as JonBenet, ``and as a father
of three kids, he felt very strongly that from day one the Ramseys
did nothing to cooperate with the authorities.''
</P>
<P>
   The Ramseys waited four months after the killing to meet with
investigators for an interview.
</P>
<P>
   The governor only returned to the subject of the Ramseys,
Wadhams said, because they devoted two pages of their book to
criticize him.
</P>
<P>
   Yet some in Colorado said Owens' comments about the Ramseys
reflected more political concerns than parental ones.
</P>
<P>
   Owens was presiding, after all, in a state where the worst
school shootings in American history happened last year. In the 11
months since 15 people died at Columbine High School, virtually
nothing has changed in Colorado. Almost all of Owens' gun control
initiatives, including requirements for background checks at gun
shows and a safe-storage law for guns kept in the home, died in the
Legislature at the hands of his own party, which controls both
chambers.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, however, statewide polls were showing that
most Colorado residents favored tighter gun control measures,
leading one group to begin a campaign to have the gun-show measure
turned into a ballot initiative in November. Owens said he would
support it.
</P>
<P>
   Whether it was a planned strategy or not, taking on the Ramseys
gave the governor a new _ and nonideological _ chance to flex
Colorado's criminal justice muscles even though a grand jury
completed 13 months of work last fall without indicting anyone in
the case.
</P>
<P>
   ``When he first said those thing about the Ramseys,'' Feeley
said, ``my first reaction was, How dare you? But I've changed my
thinking. He has met with investigators and prosecutors in the
case, and I believe he has been told that there is an awful lot of
evidence pointing to the Ramseys, but there are also holes to
create reasonable doubt. As a result, he is going after them the
only way he can, through the court of public opinion.''
</P>
<P>
   Feeley added: ``I believe he has read the public correctly on
this. After I blasted him for injecting himself in this the first
time, calls to my office ran against me 9 to 1. He had a pretty
good feel of this. I think it's been a political plus for him.''
</P>
<P>
   Rodney Hero, a professor of political science at the University
of Colorado, said Owens' willingness to express his views about the
Ramseys also provided ``a kind of easy national visibility, at the
same time raising some issues that are bothersome to many
Coloradans.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't see any political downside to it,'' Hero said. ``This
was a major crime. This is his way of saying we here in Colorado
have a sense of justice and what's happened so far is an offense to
our state and city.''
</P>
<P>
   While Owens has relinquished the floor on the Ramseys, his views
seemed likely to gain momentum soon.
</P>
<P>
   In a book to be released next month, ``JonBenet: Inside the
Ramsey Murder Investigation,'' Steve Thomas, a former Boulder
detective assigned to the case, has laid out his version of events,
rejecting the intruder theory and asserting that the Ramseys knew
more about what happened than they told police.
</P>
<P>
   ``Governor Owens is aware of a lot of the behind-the-scenes
issues in this case,'' Thomas said in an interview. ``I think he
shares our frustrations over the propaganda from the Ramseys, and
he has been offering some bottom-line comments, making it clear
that their version of events does not stand alone as the last word.
I happen to agree with him.''

 By LYNDA RICHARDSON   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Karen Barkey is far from alone among scholars in
trying to untangle the Balkans' tumultuous past and present.
Shelfloads of books and articles have been written on the region's
ancient ethnic and religious hatreds as well as on the modern
machinations of today's leaders.
</P>
<P>
   But Barkey, a sociologist at Columbia University, argues that
the region's history is much more cooperative than many of the
current explanations suggest.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody talks about the Balkans as a powder keg, the Balkans
and ethnic nationalism and ethnic cleansing,'' she said, ``but
there is a lot that is nonethnic and much more interesting, such as
the traders, the way in which society ordered itself, even with
religion and the courts.''
</P>
<P>
   Barkey is of Turkish-Jewish origin, a native of Istanbul,
Turkey, and is now at work on a book about the historical roots of
the Balkan conflict. She believes it is crucial to rethink the
structure of the Ottoman Empire in the 18th century, a pivotal
period in the region's history.
</P>
<P>
   Until the 18th century, Barkey said, the Ottomans had developed
a vertically organized society in which every level looked to the
state. If conflicts arose, for instance, the peasants, traders or
local officials involved would confer with the person above them,
following a chain of command that ultimately led to Constantinople.
</P>
<P>
   But in the 18th century, Barkey argues, those vertical lines of
association began to fracture because of a reorganization of the
empire's system of rule and taxation, which transformed the way in
which people did business. People started turning to other members
of the same group or class to resolve disputes. Neighbors sorted
out problems with neighbors. Civic associations formed. Traders
dealt with their difficulties through a proliferation of trade
associations and networks.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was an unbelievable mixing of people, the creating of
low-level, autonomous, free associations,'' Barkey said. ``People
started creating slowly a civil society in the 18th century that
was kind of removed from the state.''
</P>
<P>
   She believes that if these groups of traders, merchants and
multireligious networks had become more powerful, a more diverse
Balkans would have been the outcome.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, Barkey said, although more tolerance developed, it did
not lead to greater civic cooperation. War with the Hapsburg and
Russian empires along with ideas of self-determination that were
imported from Western Europe produced a fractious legacy. When the
Ottoman Empire broke up after World War I, a number of insecure
nations like Serbia, Greece, Romania, Bulgaria and Albania went on
to fight for territory among themselves, which in turn led to
further divisions and warfare.
</P>
<P>
   ``All these groups that were so interethnic and understood each
other and their differences,'' she said, ``they became the losers
in many ways. Understanding didn't win out. What wins out is the
war, the warriors, the warlords emerge and that kind of defines the
Balkans.''
</P>
<P>
   Barkey takes issue with policy analysts and historians who, she
believes, focus too much on nationalism.
</P>
<P>
   ``Part of my work is to show that the Balkans cooperated and
lived together and produced social capital for a long time. We have
to emphasize that as well as understand the conditions in which
they became antagonistic to each other.''

MORE BODIES FOUND FROM UGANDA CULT; MURDER IS SUSPECTED

<P>
   MBARARA, Uganda _ The Ugandan police said Friday that they had
discovered the bodies of 153 people buried in shallow graves on a
patch of land belonging to the same doomsday cult involved in the
mass deaths of hundreds of its followers last week.
</P>
<P>
   The people were murdered, and among the dead were at least 59
children, a police spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
   ``They were killed,'' said Eric Naigambi, the deputy spokesman
for the police. ``With 153 people, how could it be anything else?
They are trying to figure out how they were killed.''
</P>
<P>
   A week ago, hundreds of followers of the group, the Movement for
the Restoration of the Ten Commandments of God, died in a fire in a
makeshift church at their headquarters in Kanungu, on the
southwestern edge of the country.
</P>
<P>
   While the fire appeared at first to be a mass suicide, motivated
by prophecies about the end of the world, evidence is mounting that
the fire, which took at least 330 lives, may have been murder.
</P>
<P>
   Investigators went to the site of Thursday's discovery, about 30
miles from Kanungu, in search of additional information on the
group, which had a base in the town as well, according to local
news media here in the regional capital. ``They had reasonable
suspicions that there were mass graves around that place,''
Naigambi said.
</P>
<P>
   When they arrived, the investigators noticed a foul odor and
immediately began digging, the local news media said. They found at
least two mass graves, one with 105 bodies and the other with 48
bodies, according to local news media.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the victims appeared to have been strangled, while
others may have been slashed, the police told Agence France-Presse.
</P>
<P>
   It was the second discovery of more dead bodies in the week
since the fire. On Tuesday, the bodies of six people were pulled
from a pit latrine in a building next to the site of the fire. The
six people, who could not be identified, also appeared to have been
slain, the police said.
</P>
<P>
   Already staggered by the scale of the investigation, the
country's police now have an even more complicated case to piece
together.
</P>
<P>
   So far, investigators have not found any survivors of the fire
last week, which has left the police and the public with, at best
educated hypotheses, and at worst wild conjecture, as they try to
figure out what happened in the makeshift church on that morning.
</P>
<P>
   Hundreds of followers of the cult, which promotes a return to
life according to the Ten Commandments, assembled in the hillside
chapel on March 17, perhaps for a morning of prayer, perhaps for a
morning that they were told would mark the end of the world as they
knew it.
</P>
<P>
   They were lured into one room, and no one is known to have made
it out. A raging fire swept the room, apparently killing everyone
inside. Amid the charred detritus of the building and its
occupants, the police were able to count 330 people dead. But an
untold number are believed to have been burned to ashes, so the
exact toll may never be known.
</P>
<P>
   As the police have learned more about the cult, they have begun
looking at the case more as a murder investigation and less as a
suicide. ``We feel the leaders of this cult murdered their
followers,'' the police department's deputy regional commander,
Stephen Musoke, said Friday in an interview here.
</P>
<P>
   Founded about a decade ago, the movement imposed a rigid
lifestyle on its adherents, encouraging them to give up sex even
between married couples, and demanding that they sell off all their
possessions and contribute the proceeds to the organization.
</P>
<P>
   It is the last finding that has emerged as most troubling to
police, who suspect that the cult's leaders may have been fleecing
their flock. ``It looks like they have been robbing the people,''
Musoke said.
</P>
<P>
   That theory has led police to suspect that the cult's leaders
may have eluded or escaped the fire. ``We think that some of the
leaders may be off somewhere enjoying this wealth,'' Musoke said.
``We are really looking for these people using all of our available
resources.''
</P>
<P>
   At the top of their list is Joseph Kibwetere, 68, who helped
found the sect, and became the spiritual and financial force behind
it. Active in the region's Roman Catholic life for many years, he
was a teacher and a supervisor in Catholic schools. But he broke
with the Catholic Church in the late '80s and was eventually
expelled by the local bishop.
</P>
<P>
   Estimates of the cult's membership have ranged from 1,000 to
5,000. And it is only the most troubling tip of a problem the
government faces with religious cults, which have been growing in
popularity in recent years. The government has tried to crack down
on those that have emerged as threats to security, including two
shut down recently.

<P>
   &LR; AUBURN HILLS, Mich. _ The first thing the UCLA basketball
players scoped out after checking in at their hotel here Tuesday
afternoon wasn't the minibar or anything in a miniskirt. It wasn't
the room-service menu, the game room, the pay-movie selections or
the shopping mall across the street.
</P>
<P>
   For starting point guard Earl Watson and six of his teammates
who also were enrolled this quarter in a ``History of the European
Economy in the 20th Century'' course, their priority was locating
computers on which they could compose the 10- to 12-page research
papers that had to be faxed to their professor by Friday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   Iowa State's suffocating defense two nights later wouldn't
strike as much terror in Watson as did the sight in the hotel of a
solitary computer that all the Bruins were going to have to share.
Next to divvying one computer among seven guys, Watson has to admit
sharing one basketball among five players is a breeze.
</P>
<P>
   Watson was wise enough not to even try. He and a couple of other
players located a Kinko's that was open all night and paid to use
the computers until four in the morning.
</P>
<P>
   Later that night, after spending most of their afternoon at The
Palace for practice and mandatory media interviews, Watson and
senior forward Sean Farnham sat at opposite ends of a hotel room,
taking a 100-question multiple-choice exam in astronomy under the
fierce gaze of a member of the Bruins' academic staff.
</P>
<P>
   Welcome to the dark side of Bracketville. Come tournament time,
the NCAA loves to parade its participating players _ um, excuse us,
make that !ital!student-athletes _ as paragons of higher education.
For all the lip service paid to academics via endless
student-athlete references and the florid public-service spots
during the network telecasts of the games, you'd think State U's
monster rebounder was also a Renaissance man.
</P>
<P>
   The fact is, the NCAA could do a lot more to help the basketball
player who is sincerely trying to be a student. It certainly
couldn't do much less.
</P>
<P>
   It sends players across the country with 48 or 72 hours' notice
for the first two rounds of the tournament, their class schedules
(or in the case of the Bruins, their final-exam schedules) be
damned. It parades them in front of television cameras and
reporters for hours on end and schedules their games so some end
well past midnight, local time.
</P>
<P>
   The players are too keyed up the day of a do-or-die tournament
game to get much quality studying in and they're too spent
afterward.
</P>
<P>
   The NCAA can make its athletes account for every dollar in their
pockets. Yet there has been no concerted campaign to keep track of
every hour of study and class time lost in the name of promoting
and playing in the revenue-rich postseason extravaganza.
</P>
<P>
   ``Personally,'' said UCLA junior swingman Todd Ramasar, ``I
think the term during the NCAAs should be athlete-student.''
</P>
<P>
   He'll get no argument from Farnham, who said, ``During the (NCAA
postseason) everything is focused on athletics. People are coming
up to you and asking who's going to win and boosters who fly in for
the games want to wish you luck and there are a lot more demands on
your time, in general. No matter how hard you try, academics is
going to fade to number two. That's just the way it is.''
</P>
<P>
   Ramasar redshirted this season after undergoing shoulder surgery
in October. He felt overburdened this week just the same.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm kind of uptight, kind of stressing out and I'm not even
playing,'' Ramasar said when stopped in a hallway at the Bruins'
hotel Friday.
</P>
<P>
   He did look a little fidgety just standing there. Ramasar had
inhaled a continental breakfast and was hurrying back to his room
to get ready for two history essay exams stacked one on top of the
other, starting later in the morning.
</P>
<P>
   Like the rest of his teammates, Ramasar had gotten back to the
hotel at about 2 a.m. after the Bruins' 24-point loss to Iowa
State. He stayed up for three more hours studying. His eyes were as
red as the lettering on Iowa State's jerseys.
</P>
<P>
   Watson's left eye was nearly swollen shut Friday. He admits he
started to panic after he absorbed an elbow to the eye in UCLA's
blowout win over Maryland last Saturday that required four stitches
and led to laser eye surgery two days later.
</P>
<P>
   People who didn't know any better thought he was alarmed he
wouldn't be able to play against Iowa State. That wasn't it. Watson
was worried he wouldn't be able to see well enough to prepare
properly for his exams.
</P>
<P>
   ''That was my scariest thought,'' Watson said. ``I was thinking,
`How am I supposed to study when I can't see anything?' On
Wednesday my vision was still blurry and I had really bad
headaches.''
</P>
<P>
   He considered asking his professors if he could postpone his
exams until next week, when the student body is on spring break.
Watson decided against it, reasoning, ``If I was a professor, I'd
say if you can play basketball, then you can take your exams.''
</P>
<P>
   Copernicus couldn't keep Watson out of the Midwest Regional
semifinal. On Wednesday he sat in a room with Farnham and took his
astronomy exam, as scheduled.
</P>
<P>
   Watson and the others would get a welcome reprieve from their
economics professor. After explaining the computer crisis at the
hotel in an e-mail to the professor, the players were granted an
extension on their papers.
</P>
<P>
   So instead of worrying about finishing them this week, they get
to spend their spring break writing at length on such topics as,
``The great Depression and its effect on the German economy.''
</P>
<P>
   Yes, basketball players at UCLA certainly do lead charmed lives.
</P>
<P>
   ``Had we not been able to get an extension on our papers,''
Farnham said, ``you would have seen the whole team at Kinko's
before and after the (Iowa State) game trying to finish them.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's very frustrating for us,'' he added. ``We want to handle
our business. Sometimes there's just circumstances out of our
control.''
</P>
<P>
   The NCAA has the power to help. It could lean on a sponsor to
lend laptop computers to the participating teams, if nothing else.
It should do something, lest people start to think NCAA stands for
Not Caring About Academics.

SUTTON MAINTAINS CONTROL OF EMOTIONS AND ROUND

   PONTE VEDRA BEACH, Fla. _ In almost every round at the Players
Championship, adversity is unavoidable. Players who remain
resilient have a chance to win. Players who succumb to frustration
find themselves hopelessly behind.
</P>
<P>
   Hal Sutton reached a crucial crossroad midway through Friday's
round, when back-to-back bogeys threatened to send him tumbling off
the leader board. But instead of collapsing, Sutton regrouped with
three consecutive birdies. And at the midway point of a demanding
tournament, Sutton remained the man to catch.
</P>
<P>
   Shooting his second consecutive 69, including a 32 over his
final nine holes, Sutton held a one-stroke lead at six under par
for the tournament (138) after Friday's second round of the TPC at
Sawgrass. Tom Lehman and Omar Uresti, both of whom shot 68, were
tied for second place at five under par, while Fulton Allem, who
had the tournament's best round (65), was in fourth place at four
under par.
</P>
<P>
   Only nine players remained under par in an event that has forced
some of the world's best players to reach for a pain reliever.
Tiger Woods, who shot 71, was tied at two under par with Ernie Els
and Len Mattiace, while Lee Janzen and Scott Dunlap were tied at
one under par.
</P>
<P>
   It will be an interesting weekend with names like Sutton,
Lehman, Woods, Els and Janzen chasing the biggest purse in golf
($1.08 million) on a course that demands excellent play.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's a great test,'' said Sutton, who answered a bogey
at No. 18 with birdies at Nos. 1, 2 and 3. ``There are times where
we are switching from offense to defense. You've got to be smart
enough to know when to hit the accelerator and when to hit the
brake. I think that's what makes this course great. It's easy to
hit the accelerator constantly, or to hit the brake constantly.
It's hard to know when to hit each one.''
</P>
<P>
   As always, this tournament showed no mercy for those who were
not playing well, even though the wind was much calmer than it was
during Thursday's first round. Prominent names who missed the
six-over-par-cut included Jesper Parnevik (seven over), Darren
Clarke (seven over), Phil Mickelson (10 over), Jose Maria Olazabal
(10 over), Sergio Garcia (10 over), and Duffy Waldorf (14 over).
The defending champion David Duval made a costly double bogey on
No. 18, and fell to four over par for the tournament, 10 strokes
behind Sutton.
</P>
<P>
   Even the leaders had their precarious moments. Woods (one
under), who has yet to break 70 in 14 rounds at Sawgrass, was
nearly victimized by the island green at No. 17. On Thursday, Woods
hit his tee shot at 17 into the water, which led to a double bogey.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday, a gust of wind grabbed his 8-iron tee shot from 145
yards and sent it left of the pin. The ball landed on the green,
but trickled down the slope and came to rest at the edge of green,
just an inch from tumbling into the water. Balancing himself on the
ledge, with his heels hanging over the water, Woods used a 3-wood
to putt up the hill, then made an 8-footer to save par.
</P>
<P>
   Not only did Woods escape without a bogey, but he did not fall
into the water.
</P>
<P>
   ``I told Stevie to grab me if a gust of wind came,'' said Woods,
referring to his caddie, Steve Williams. ``I'm proud of my round
today because as well as I hit the ball, I didn't think I deserved
to be even par.''
</P>
<P>
   But Woods had to scramble, and he made his second double bogey
of the tournament at the par-4 No. 4. He caught a bad break on that
hole, when his drive landed in a sand divot. Woods' next shot was
short and right of the green, then his chip from a terrible lie was
still 30 feet short of the hole. Woods lagged his putt to four
feet, but he missed the 4-foot bogey attempt and walked away with a
double bogey.
</P>
<P>
   Woods ended the day with a birdie at the par-5, 583-yard ninth
hole. After a huge drive, Woods hit a monstrous 3-wood from 255
yards that nearly reached the green, then chipped to 8 feet and
made the putt. That left Woods in his best position ever at the
Players Championship starting a weekend.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm right in the hunt with a chance to win,'' said Woods,
hoping to win for the fourth time in seven starts this year. ``And
I'm very pleased with how I'm hitting the ball.''
</P>
<P>
   So is Sutton, who bounced back after hitting his tee shot into
the water at No. 18. After taking a drop, his next shot from the
deep rough almost landed in the water again, stopping a foot from
the bank. But Sutton chipped to 12 feet, then made the putt to save
bogey. After making the turn, Sutton made a 12-footer for birdie at
No. 1, and 18-footers for birdies at No. 2 and No. 3. As a result,
Sutton will start the weekend in front, with some impressive names
close behind.
</P>
<P>
   ``It doesn't make any difference,'' said Sutton, when asked if
he noticed the names on the leader board. ``I can only control
myself, and I'm out of control half the time. I'm going to do the
best I can with me.'' &QL;

SPARTANS' CLEAVES PROVIDES INSPIRATION
</HEADLINE>
   (rk) 
 By JOE DRAPE   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUBURN HILLS, Mich. _ Michigan State trailed Syracuse by 10
points Thursday night, and Mateen Cleaves was so angry that he
stormed into the locker room's bathroom and herded the Spartans
freshmen out of their usual halftime hiding place. His teammate,
the starting power forward A.J. Granger, smiled about the scene
Friday, but made it clear no one was laughing at the time.
</P>
<P>
   ``He charged in and screamed at them to `get out here now, you
guys need to hear this, too,''' said Granger, explaining that the
young reserves usually try to get as far away from the team's
intense point guard as they can during tight games. ``He's the type
of guy to lead the charge in the locker room, and it's better than
just hearing it from the coach.''
</P>
<P>
   So in a voice as gravelly as the abrasive style he plays,
Cleaves, the senior point guard, laid down the law: missed shots
are one thing; not getting back on defense is an unacceptable other
thing. It was vintage Cleaves, and it powered the Spartans to an
explosive 75-58 victory over Syracuse and a spot in the Midwest
Regional final.
</P>
<P>
   When he spent the preseason and the Spartans' first 13 games on
the injured list with a stress fracture of his foot, Cleaves
demonstrated unwavering leadership. While his teammates practiced,
he sat on the side of the court working out on a combination
bicycle and rowing machine. ``He'd be there for an hour sweating
more than us,'' Granger said.
</P>
<P>
   When the top-seeded Spartans meet second-seeded Iowa State on
Saturday night in the regional final, Cleaves will take on a
less-heralded but just as maniacal point guard in Jamaal Tinsley of
Brooklyn. Asked who would win a playground one-on-one between
Cleaves and Tinsley, Iowa State's all-American forward Marcus Fizer
slumped in his chair and just sighed.
</P>
<P>
   ``The only thing that would decide that game is who got
dehydrated first and passed out,'' Fizer said. ``I'd like to watch
them go at it.''
</P>
<P>
   Instead, the nation will see 10 players on the floor and two
teams that absolutely believe that NCAA tournament games are won
and lost on the defensive end. The Spartans have won eight straight
games overall by holding opponents to 54.4 points a game and 36
percent shooting. The Cyclones are just as suffocating: they held
opponents to 41 percent shooting from the field over 35 games, and
stifled UCLA _ a team that had scored 105 points last week against
Maryland _ in Thursday's 80-56 regional semifinal victory.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is not a game of individual matchups,'' Iowa State coach
Larry Eustachy said. ``It is our team versus their team. Neither
team got to where we are without a collection of great players, and
these are two great teams.''
</P>
<P>
   Even when Cleaves was injured, Michigan State coach Tom Izzo
said, he improved the Spartans both on and off the court. His
impact was especially strong on his teammates and close friends
from Flint, Mich., Charlie Bell and Morris Peterson.
</P>
<P>
   Izzo said: ``When he was out, Charlie had to learn how to handle
the ball and create his shots, and Morris learned that this was his
team; he was the one to take the big shots. The great thing was
that Mateen was right there on the bench, in the locker room, on
the side of court reinforcing these things.''
</P>
<P>
   The Spartans went 9-4 without Cleaves _ losing to Texas,
Arizona, Kentucky and Wright State. It was excruciating for
Cleaves, who had spent the spring and summer working on his
strength and shooting. He still cringes about losses he believes he
could have turned into victories, but he has been single-minded
since his return.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't try to look at the past,'' Cleaves said. ``I put my
mind and focus on the task at hand. If I run my team now, we can
win the title with three more victories.''
</P>
<P>
   But first Iowa State and Tinsley stand in his way. The muscular
guard barely missed a triple-double against UCLA _ he had 14
points, 11 assists and nine rebounds. Eustachy says the blossoming
during the tournament of Tinsley, a New York summer league legend,
has as much to do with his buying into Iowa State's structure as it
does with pure talent.
</P>
<P>
   The coach concedes he likes Tinsley's chances against Cleaves.
``He has an unconventional way of creating havoc,'' Eustachy said.
``He doesn't get enough credit for his discipline, thinking,
switching, finding the right post and running the offense. He can
play with the other guy.''

BROTHER SAYS SLAYING SUSPECT MISLED HIM
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service Clients) 
By MITCH MITCHELL 
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   IRVING, Texas _ William Harris said his brother, murder suspect
Robert Wayne Harris, misled him and apparently police about how the
slayings at the Mi-T-Fine Car Wash in Irving took place Monday.
</P>
<P>
   At first, William Harris said, he believed his brother's account
that he had snapped while arguing with a carwash manager when he
asked for his job back. Now, William Harris said, his brother's
account doesn't match the evidence _ and his brother didn't tell
him about his connection to Sandra Estes Scott, in whose slaying he
is also the suspect.
</P>
<P>
   William Harris said that he is unsure about what happened at the
carwash and about his brother's lifestyle.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought I knew him,'' William Harris said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I asked him to look me in the eye and tell me the truth,
because I wanted to know,'' William Harris said. ``I was defending
him, and I wanted to know what happened so I would know what to
do.''
</P>
<P>
   The carwash victims were all shot in the head, and one had his
neck cut, according to medical examiner reports. Crime scene
experts said that the head wounds were consistent with calculated
killings, not with shootings that happen during a fight.
</P>
<P>
   Robert Harris, 28, was charged Friday with five counts of
capital murder and one count of attempted capital murder in the
carwash slayings, authorities said.
</P>
<P>
   He is also is expected to face murder charges in the slaying of
Scott, 37, said David Tull, an Irving police spokesman.
</P>
<P>
   Scott's body was found Wednesday morning after Robert Harris
told investigators where to find her, police said.
</P>
<P>
   Harris was transferred Friday from the Irving Jail to the Lew
Sterrett Justice Center in Dallas. As he was being escorted into
the jail, Robert Harris quietly said he was sorry when asked if
there was anything he had to say to the victims' families.
</P>
<P>
   Robert Harris is accused of fatally shooting five carwash
employees and critically wounding another. The dead are Dennis Lee,
48; Rhoda Wheeler, 45; Benjamin Villasenor, 32; and Roberto Jimenez
Jr., 15, all of Irving; and Agustin Villasenor, 36, of Arlington.
</P>
<P>
   Octavio Ramos, 36, of Irving was in critical condition Friday
night at Parkland Memorial Hospital in Dallas.
</P>
<P>
   William Harris said that he has spoken to a relative of one of
the victims, and that the families are praying for each other.
</P>
<P>
   But the agony experienced by the families touched by these
shootings has caused William Harris to search his memories for
missed opportunities that might have prevented Monday's tragedy.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been tormenting myself,'' he said. ``I've felt guilty.
I've been looking for what I could have done differently that might
have made things different. I tried to help him, but maybe it was
the wrong kind of help.''
</P>
<P>
   The shame her husband feels is shared by her whole family,
Beverly Harris said. Beverly Harris said that she has been on both
sides of the situation. Her cousin was slain years ago, and Beverly
Harris said she remembers the pain that she and her sister felt.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been on that side, and I've been on the other side,''
Beverly Harris said. ``The side of the accused is much worse. It's
one of the worst feelings you could ever have. You wonder if there
was anything you could have done, if you should have prayed harder,
if you should have witnessed to him more.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The hardest thing for me has been watching'' her husband, she
said.
</P>
<P>
   Since getting out of prison in May, Robert Wayne Harris kept
most people in the dark about his life, William Harris said. He
said that he may have never really known his brother _ that he
remains unable to unlock whatever secrets his brother kept.
</P>
<P>
   ``The only memories I have of him are good memories, childhood
memories,'' William Harris said. ``I hold onto those. Those are
precious.''
</P>
<P>
   Family members were poor when they were children. Many of the
houses in the Dallas suburb where they lived are now boarded up and
condemned. William Harris was 10 when their parents separated after
moving from Lubbock. The father returned to Lubbock.
</P>
<P>
   The family went from having what they needed to live an ordinary
middle-class life to being very poor, William Harris said.
</P>
<P>
   ``My mom didn't work,'' William Harris said. ``It was like she
didn't have the will to do what it took to raise two children.''
</P>
<P>
   They ate syrup sandwiches, he said, and they had to borrow money
to keep the gas and lights from being cut off. Sometimes, one of
the boys would go next door to bring water home to bathe in, Harris
said.
</P>
<P>
   Robert Harris liked to work, his brother said. When he did odd
jobs around the neighborhood, he would give his mother half the
money and split the rest with him, William Harris said.
</P>
<P>
   William Harris said he and his brother had grown apart during
the past 11 years, most of which Robert spent in prison.
</P>
<P>
   ``When he got out, he got a driver's license, he got a job at
the carwash, and he got a 1980 Oldsmobile,'' William Harris said.
``He got a promotion at his job. They were small accomplishments
for most people, but it was a great deal for him.''

BROKER ADMITS SELLING DRUGS ON FLOOR OF STOCK EXCHANGE 
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   NEW YORK _ Shares of Time Warner and Citigroup are among the
typical things bought and sold at the New York Stock Exchange. But
one broker pleaded guilty on Thursday to selling cocaine to
undercover officers on the trading floor, prosecutors said.
</P>
<P>
   The arrest, and three others, resulted from a sting in which an
undercover officer took a clerical job on the exchange floor and
was able to buy drugs, packaged in stock exchange envelopes, from
four people from July to September of last year, the Manhattan
district attorney's office said.
</P>
<P>
   The broker, Frank Geneva, 45, of Staten Island, N.Y., an
employee of B.R. Doyle &AMP; Co., pleaded guilty to charges of drug
possession and drug selling. He faces up to six years in state
prison when he is sentenced on May 18.
</P>
<P>
   The police also arrested two messengers for the stock exchange,
Sandra Corson, 37, of Staten Island, and Shawn Moore, 34, of
Manhattan, and a telephone clerk, Hector Almonte, 59, of Queens
County, N.Y., who worked for another brokerage, Asiel &AMP; Co. Their
cases are still pending.
</P>
<P>
   Louis Diamond, a lawyer for Geneva, said that his client became
addicted to cocaine and then started selling the drug around 1997.
Geneva did not know the other three people and made his sales
independently, Diamond said.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was selling to a few friends,'' Diamond said. ``It was just
a handful of people, to supplement his own use.''
</P>
<P>
   Geneva had worked at the exchange for 20 years and lives in a
modest home on Staten Island, Diamond said. He would not say where
his client bought the drugs.
</P>
<P>
   Robert Zito, a spokesman for the New York Stock Exchange, said
the market cooperated with investigators, allowing the police to
post an undercover officer on the trading floor.
</P>
<P>
   ``We think it was an isolated incident,'' Zito said.
</P>
<P>
   The four who were arrested were among the sea of 3,300 workers _
along with the undercover officer, Detective Rodney Rodriguez _ at
the exchange. The two stock exchange employees who were arrested
were among the 148 messengers who take confirmation slips from
traders on the floor to the booths where brokers work. The job of
the messenger is a dying art form, since many brokerages are
replacing the paper slips with e-mail messages, Zito said.
</P>
<P>
   The two brokerages could face an investigation and fines from
regulators who work for the exchange.
</P>
<P>
   The stock exchange conducts pre-employment drug testing, but
does not test employees. But Zito said the exchange has a
zero-tolerance drug policy and had banned all four people after the
arrests and the exchange's internal investigation.
</P>
<P>
   ''If you cross the line on our trading floor, no matter who your
employer is, you will no longer be allowed in this building,'' Zito
said.

CLINTON LAUDS TECHNOLOGY AS KEY TO INDIA'S ECONOMY 
</HEADLINE>
   (EDS: Updates and rewrites completely.)  
(See also CLINTON-PAKISTAN, INDIA-TB) 
(js) 
 By JANE PERLEZ   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   HYDERABAD, India _ President Clinton saluted India's
information-technology industry Friday, the core of the country's
steady economic growth and a supplier of brain power to Silicon
Valley in California.
</P>
<P>
   This was the last full day of Clinton's visit to India, and
after having dealt with tricky strategic and political questions,
it seemed appropriate that the president should concentrate on the
economy, the area where there is probably the most commonality
between the United States and India.
</P>
<P>
   For the moment, trade between the two countries is relatively
small, $12 billion last year compared with $94.9 billion between
the United States and China. But it is the potential for dramatic
growth, especially with an expanding middle class with a taste for
American consumer goods, that excites the administration and
American businesses.
</P>
<P>
   The United States is India's largest trading partner. But India,
because of its high tariffs and largely state-run economy, accounts
for less than 1 percent of American global investments. Clinton,
accompanied throughout his India trip by Commerce Secretary William
Daley, made clear that he hoped that would change.
</P>
<P>
   After touring booths that displayed information technology and
receiving an Indian driver's license through the Internet, the
president spoke at a software center, popularly known as HITEC
City, an acronym for the Hyderabad Information
Technology-Engineering Consultancy. Computer companies including
Microsoft, Oracle and Toshiba have set up shop here, alongside new
Indian giants and smaller start-ups.
</P>
<P>
   In extolling Indian achievements in information technology,
Clinton cited computer superstars like Vinod Khosla, who helped
build Sun Microsystems, and Vinod Dahm, who created the Pentium
chip.
</P>
<P>
   India is ``fast becoming one of the world's software
superpowers,'' Clinton said, proving that ``in a globalized world,
developing nations not only can succeed, developing nations can
lead.''
</P>
<P>
   The number of Internet users in India is expected to grow 10
times in the next four years, he added. The worth of India's
information-technology exports have catapulted, to $4 billion from
$150 million 10 years ago. The Indian government projects that by
2008 the exports will grow to $85 billion.
</P>
<P>
   Most important for India, Clinton said, the significant effects
of Indian computer engineers on the American industry is beginning
to pay back at home. ``We're moving from brain drain to brain
gain,'' Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
   A group, IndUS Entrepreneurs, whose members include the leading
Indian software engineers in Silicon Valley, estimates that 30
percent of the software engineers there are of Indian origin. Most
were educated at Indian technology institutes and went to the
United States to give an impetus to Silicon Valley. But now, with
the Indian economy growing at 6 percent a year, and with 10 percent
growth within sight, some Silicon Valley veterans are beginning to
return.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton also struck one of his favorite themes about the
Internet, that it can be used to lift the poor. India, he told his
audience, accounts for 30 percent of the world's software
engineers, but also 25 percent of the world's malnourished. Thus,
he said, India is in a special position to show how its brains and
inventiveness in the new technologies could improve health care and
education across the nation's villages.
</P>
<P>
   This is ``good economics,'' Clinton said. If for example,
villages had computers with educational software, and printers,
that would create a potential for a revolution in education in a
country where almost 50 percent of the population is illiterate.
</P>
<P>
   ``It would mean, among other things,'' he said, ``that the
world's most populous nation would have the world's largest number
of educated people and, therefore, in no time would have the
world's largest economy.''

 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JEROME SOLOMON  
 c. 2000, Houston Chronicle  
ALBUQUERQUE, N.M. _ Even the beholders who get to play aren't
trying to convince us this one will be a beauty.
<TEXT>
<P>
   Wisconsin vs. Purdue. Round Four of ugly, almost-brawl ball.
</P>
<P>
   The two Big Ten brutes have traveled west to play for the fourth
time this season, and like their other three contests, Saturday's
NCAA Tournament West Regional final is not likely to be pretty.
</P>
<P>
   ``We beat up on each other one time, then we beat up on each
other a second time, then we beat up on each other a third time,''
Purdue point guard Jaraan Cornell said. ``Now, here we go. We're
just going to beat up on each other again.''
</P>
<P>
   Of course Cornell may have taken ``beat up on each other'' a bit
too far when in the heat of battle he allegedly threatened to break
Wisconsin guard Mike Kelly's jaw.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know about his reputation, and maybe I have come out trying
to say, `He can't guard me,' and that has taken me out of my
game,'' Cornell said. ``I let my emotions get the best of me.''
</P>
<P>
   Cornell denies he made the jaw threat, but Kelly was quite clear
in his memory of the incident, though he said he understood the
frustration Cornell was feeling at the time.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was hacking him pretty bad, and the refs weren't calling
it,'' said Kelly, who holds Wisconsin's single-season and career
steals records. ``I was all over his arms and got a couple of
steals that way.''
</P>
<P>
   The defense rests its case, your honor.
</P>
<P>
   ``There you go there you go,'' said Cornell, who scored just
nine points on 3-of-19 shooting in the Boilermakers' two losses to
Wisconsin this season. ``That's the way they play. They're taught
to hack. I can't fault them, though. They're just playing tough
defense and doing what they can get away with.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't let that bother me, even when the refs won't let it go
on the other end. I've got to control my emotions.''
</P>
<P>
   Hence the belief that today's game will be brutal _
aesthetically and physically.
</P>
<P>
   ``Oh, I'm sure it'll be ugly,'' Wisconsin coach Dick Bennett
said. ``These are two of the hardest-playing teams you can find,
and I'm sure we'll both get after it. Purdue plays at least as hard
as if not harder than we do.''
</P>
<P>
   Bennett credits Purdue coach Gene Keady with bringing toughness
into the Big Ten.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think Gene Keady may have the patent on intensity _ getting
people to play hard,'' Bennett said. ``That has been a cornerstone
of their program and his coaching forever. When you play a team
coached by this man, you tighten your belt buckle, you pull up your
socks, you lace your shoes very tight, and know that there will be
no quarter given and none asked.''
</P>
<P>
   Bennett, on the other hand, should be credited with bringing
another gear into the conference _ reverse. The Badgers' brand of
basketball is a slow, grind-it-out style that frustrates opponents
and leads to wins, especially in a tournament setting where
Wisconsin's foes are not accustomed to its tactics.
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately for the Badgers, Purdue is not one of those teams.
</P>
<P>
   ``Playing Purdue, we'll lose that advantage because they know
what to expect,'' Bennett said. ``They have seen it before three
times.''
</P>
<P>
   Sixth-seeded Purdue (24-9) reached the Elite Eight with wins
over Dayton, Oklahoma and Gonzaga, while No. 8 seed Wisconsin
(21-13) advanced with victories over Fresno State, Arizona and LSU.
</P>
<P>
   The Boilermakers lost two of their previous three games with
Wisconsin, putting up some of their worst numbers of the season.
</P>
<P>
   Purdue hit only 36.2 percent of its shots but won the first
matchup of the teams 63-52. In Game 2, the Boilermakers managed
only 45 points and shot a horrendous 28.6 percent from the floor,
their worst shooting effort of the season, in a 10-point defeat.
</P>
<P>
   Wisconsin jumped out to a 14-4 lead and never trailed in the
third meeting two weeks ago in the quarterfinals of the Big Ten
tournament. That game's highlight was a head-to-head collision
between Kelly and Purdue's Carson Cunningham. Both took stitches
but returned to the game.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's the type of teams we are,'' Kelly said. ``We need hard
hats. It seems like when you match up with those guys, you come out
with a lot of bruises and bumps _ even stitches.''
</P>
<P>
   The bizarre thing about the collision was that it occurred on an
inbounds play away from the ball, and Kelly wasn't even guarding
Cunningham at the time.
</P>
<P>
   These two teams know each other's personnel and schemes so well
that Keady said his staff had little preparation to do for the
game. Sometimes, he said, you can ``over-know'' an opponent.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you play a team for the fourth time, they know everything
about you, and you know everything about them,'' Wisconsin forward
Andy Kowske said. ``It really emphasizes execution.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are no surprises. They know our defense. The last three
games we surprised our opponents with the kind of defense we put on
them.''
</P>
<P>
   Wisconsin held LSU to a season-low 48 points in the West
Regional semifinal, and Cornell said he could see it coming.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was sitting there watching the game and thinking, `They (the
Tigers) don't have a clue,''' he said. ``You can't put the ball on
the floor like LSU was doing. That's what Wisconsin wants.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have to keep moving and keep the ball moving to find the
open man, and he has to take the shot. You can't put it on the
floor. That's playing right into their hands.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, fluid offensive execution is the last thing either team
expects in this one. Purdue had an 8:51 stretch without points at
Wisconsin, and the Badgers had a 10-minute stretch in West
Lafayette, Ind., in which they managed just two points. The last
time the teams played, there were 49 fouls called, and the teams
shot 63 free throws.
</P>
<P>
   ``While you're playing, your adrenaline is flowing, so it's not
a real brutal experience,'' Cunningham said of the teams' penchant
for physical battles. ``It's definitely physical, but it's fun. We
like contact. We like aggressive, hard-nosed basketball. I think
Wisconsin does, too. We're just ready to get it on.''

MICROSOFT OFFERS SETTLEMENT OF ANTITRUST CASE 
</HEADLINE>
   (SUBS 13th graf with possible timetable for talks; REMOVES 1st
sentence after optional trim   with speculation on Jackson's plans.

 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ With two federal judges pressing Microsoft and the
government to settle their antitrust case soon , Microsoft
presented a formal, written proposal Friday that would restrain
some of the company's business practices, officials said.
</P>
<P>
   Lawyers for the Justice Department and 19 state attorneys
general were studying the proposal Friday night to decide whether
it was promising enough to warrant weekend negotiations.
</P>
<P>
   Officials said the proposal included so much technical detail
that they could not analyze it quickly, although one also said
Microsoft ``appears to have come a long way with this, but not as
far as I think they should.''
</P>
<P>
   Reaching agreement with Microsoft, however, is only half of the
plaintiffs' task. They must also agree among themselves.
</P>
<P>
   The Justice Department and 19 state attorneys general are
partners in the suit, and among them hold a range of opinions on
what they could accept as a settlement. Some attorneys general
believe anything short of breaking up the company would be
ineffective, while others disagree. But officials said proposals
that would restructure the company have not been on the table in
the settlement talks.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday, Judge Thomas Penfield Jackson, who is trying the
case in federal court here, called lawyers from both sides to his
chambers to ask for a progress report on the settlement talks,
which have been under way since Nov. 30.
</P>
<P>
   The trial is over; all that is left is the verdict. But Jackson
is withholding it to give the settlement talks time to run their
course. On Tuesday, however, he made it clear that he was not
willing to wait beyond next week. And given his findings of fact in
the case, published in November, he is almost certain to find
Microsoft in violation of antitrust law _ prompting the company to
offer concessions Friday that officials said it had not offered
before.
</P>
<P>
   Richard Posner, chief judge of the U.S. Court of Appeals in
Chicago, who is serving as mediator, has been making similar
suggestions of urgency for weeks. Originally he said he wanted to
conclude the talks by early February.
</P>
<P>
   Since the meeting with Jackson this week, state and federal
officials have been furiously calling, e-mailing and meeting each
other in an effort to agree on a strategy. Many of the attorneys
general have been in Washington for an annual meeting that ended
Friday, and while here some of them have met with Joel I. Klein,
head of the Justice Department's antitrust division.
</P>
<P>
   But as the attorneys general consider Microsoft's proposal, the
states have no central decision-making process for deciding whether
it warrants serious negotiation, requiring lots of phone calls and
messages to reach a decision.
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday, after reports in The Wall Street Journal and The
Washington Post indicated that the pace of settlement talks had
increased, Microsoft's stock gained more than 7 percent. Friday it
closed at $111.6875, down 18.75 cents.
</P>
<P>
   Both state and federal officials said publicly that they would
not comment on the settlement talks, and none would describe the
proposal in detail. Microsoft declined to comment.
</P>
<P>
   But all of them appear to be keeping their options open to meet
in Chicago with Posner this weekend. But they have decided not to
meet on Saturday. If government lawyers decide Microsoft's new
proposal is serious, Bill Gates, Microsoft's chairman, and Klein
might be expected to join the talks, when they do reopen, perhaps
as soon as Sunday or Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Several officials noted, however, that it was not easy to make a
decision because of the technical detail in the proposal. The last
time Microsoft and the government settled an antitrust case, in
1994, Gates insisted on one detail _ the ability to add new
features to Windows _ that seemed unimportant to the government at
the time but later proved to be the basis for the current suit.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our experience with this is not a happy one, not inspiring of
confidence,'' one official said. Several officials said it would
take time to analyze the document to make sure it does not include
similar potential vulnerabilities.
</P>
<P>
   All of Microsoft's proposals, they said, are for changes in
conduct. The company has made it clear, in the settlement talks and
in public, that it would not accept a breakup of the company.
Breakup proposals, the company has said, are ``an extreme and
reckless resolution to the government's antitrust suit.''
</P>
<P>
   But some government officials think anything short of that would
not be effective. As one official put it Friday: ``If we don't make
fundamental changes, then soon enough we'll be fighting this battle
all over again.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS.)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   And when Klein met with leaders of the technology industry last
fall, asking them for public support of proposed sanctions against
Microsoft _ without saying exactly what he had in mind _ he
received something short of enthusiastic responses. Without
industry support, a stringent remedy might be hard to enact.
</P>
<P>
   Until now, Microsoft and government lawyers have been meeting
separately with Posner in Chicago. One day, the judge would talk to
one side, the next day to the other. And then the judge would try
to draw the two sides together. If the talks go forward next week,
the two sides will probably meet face to face for the first time
since their initial, organizational meeting with the judge on Nov.
30.
</P>
<P>
   At one stage of the talks early this year, Posner asked the
state and federal officials, one by one, for their proposed
remedies, and as each official offered his idea, the suggestions
were all over the map _ from restraining Microsoft's behavior to
breaking up the company. Never have all of the parties _ the
Justice Department and the 19 states _ come to agreement on a
common approach.
</P>
<P>
   Among the conduct remedies that have been discussed, officials
said, is forcing Microsoft to publish a common price list for
Windows so the company could not use prices to penalize or reward
computer makers for their level of cooperation with the company.
</P>
<P>
   Another idea would force Microsoft to publish the codes that
allow software writers to link their programs to Windows _ codes
known as applications program interfaces _ in a uniform, formal
way.
</P>
<P>
   If the settlement talks fail, Jackson's verdict could come
within a few days. After that, in a separate proceeding, the state
and federal governments will offer a remedy proposal to the judge.
For that, the Justice Department and attorneys general will have to
agree, because Jackson has made it clear he wants only one
proposal.

NEW JERSEY MOVES AGAINST EXTREME WRESTLING 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By RONALD SMOTHERS   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEWARK, N.J. _ New Jersey's governor and a leader of the
Assembly joined forces Friday against a violent form of pro
wrestling in which contenders use chairs, kitchen implements and
other sharp items to draw blood from one another and squeals from
the audience.
</P>
<P>
   At a news conference here, Gov. Christie Whitman, a Republican,
and the Assembly's Democratic leader, Joseph Doria, said they would
propose legislation to regulate what is known as extreme or
hard-core wrestling. Their main concerns, they said, were to
prevent young children from attending the matches and to give local
officials some say in whether the matches should take place in
their towns.
</P>
<P>
   ``Extreme wrestling is a grotesque and depraved activity,'' said
Doria, who is also the mayor of Bayonne, where matches are held
almost every week. ``It's a blood sport with no redeeming value for
our children.''
</P>
<P>
   The two officials said they planned a bill that would bar
children under 16 from attending matches and would establish a
licensing mechanism for the matches within the State Athletic
Commission. Communities would be able to appeal the commission's
permits for such events.
</P>
<P>
   The regulations would not affect the more popular mainstream
matches of the World Wrestling Federation and World Championship
Wrestling.
</P>
<P>
   Whitman said the new legislation would apply to only a small
percentage of wrestling going on in the state. And she said that
although she had not seen any extreme wrestling herself, she had
received letters and e-mail messages from parents urging her to
take some action.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't seek to outlaw it completely,'' she said. ``But we do
want to prohibit children from seeing it. It is one thing for
consenting adults to attend these events and it is quite another to
allow impressionable children to sit ringside as participants set
out to maim and attack each other with objects such as razors and
chairs.''
</P>
<P>
   The advent of extreme wrestling matches in New Jersey is an
unintended result of the state's decision three years ago to
deregulate wrestling altogether and remove it from the State
Athletic Commission's supervision. That move was made, Whitman
said, only after the mainstream wrestling groups stopped insisting
that they were a sport requiring strength and skill, but were a
form of entertainment that was staged and choreographed.
</P>
<P>
   Jeff Schapiro, co-owner of Jersey All-Pro Wrestling, which
stages groups of matches weekly in Bayonne and other places that
feature one or two extreme events complete with chairs, pots and
pans, tables and barbed wire, said that such events had grown
rapidly with deregulation and the growing audience for wrestling,
which seems to demand more and greater thrills.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's real blood in these matches even though they are
choreographed,'' he said. ``But we do it because the fans want to
see blood. It's the fans' appetite for bloodier matches that drives
this.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   But Shapiro, who packs up to 300 people into Charity Hall for
his matches in Bayonne when the hall is not being used for church
bingo, said that the more extreme matches had lost much of their
allure and lately were ``falling flat.'' Thus, he said, he could
easily phase them out and live with any of the proposed
regulations.
</P>
<P>
   ``The age restriction will be a problem because we have a fan
base that goes from 10 years old and up,'' he said. ``But I think I
can live with the regulations they are proposing. Plus, people
don't want that stuff as much now, and want more acrobatics in the
ring.''
</P>
<P>
   While he expected his matches to survive regulation, he was not
so sure about groups like CZW, a southern New Jersey company that
promotes extreme wrestling almost exclusively. Officials of the
company could not be reached for comment on the proposed
legislation, but their Web site carried a drily written account of
one of their recent matches featuring performers with such names as
Wifebeater and Mac Smack.
</P>
<P>
   ``CZW champion Zandig fought Kronus to a no contest,'' the
account began. ``The bloody match ended when Wifebeater and Mac
Smack interfered. They taped Zandig onto the ring ropes, then
whipped him with barbed wire and then used two Weedwhackers to
slice his back and arms open. Then Wifebeater poured salt, lemon
juice and lighter fluid onto his cuts. Finally they set him on fire
before CZW security stopped the attack.''

ADAM HOME AT SECOND
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By KEVIN MODESTI  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   One of the questions on the Cal State Northridge sports
information department's athlete questionnaire is, ``Where might
you be 10 years from now?'' Adam Kennedy answered, ``Playing
professional ball.''
</P>
<P>
   Another question goes, ``If you weren't in college, where might
you be?'' Kennedy wrote, ``Playing pro ball.''
</P>
<P>
   It has been a few years since Kennedy, then the Matadors'
All-America shortstop, revealed his uncomplicated soul so
concisely. And the years don't seem to have changed him one bit.
For him, baseball isn't merely a game, isn't only a career. It's a
place, a destination.
</P>
<P>
   So when Kennedy, a 24-year-old rookie second baseman, went from
the St. Louis Cardinals to the Angels in a three-player trade on
Thursday, the fact he's coming home was not the main reason he
proclaimed himself ``happy as I can be.''
</P>
<P>
   ``That's my second worry,'' he said of playing in Anaheim, close
to his parents and his boyhood home in Riverside, and not far from
his friends at Matador Field. ``I'm trying to win a job on a
big-league roster, and playing to compete in October (in the World
Series). Being at home is great, but (playing) is my biggest
priority.''
</P>
<P>
   That's good news for the Angels, one reason general manager Bill
Stoneman's first significant transaction is a smart one.
</P>
<P>
   Over the decades, now numbering four, the Angels have put
uniforms on too many players who were thrilled to come to Southern
California for the beach, the girls or the cameras. They were the
ones who always looked comfortable in their well-tanned skin, as
long as they didn't have to scrape it in the process of breaking up
a double play.
</P>
<P>
   Kennedy sounds different. He's thrilled to come to Southern
California because this is where he'll get a chance to play
major-league baseball every night.
</P>
<P>
   He wasn't getting that chance with the Cardinals, who acquired
veteran second baseman Fernando Vina from the Milwaukee Brewers
over the winter and demoted Kennedy to their minor-league
spring-training camp last Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   ``I haven't even really calmed down (since hearing about the
trade),''Kennedy said Friday afternoon on a cellular phone from a
Chili's restaurant in Tempe, Ariz.
</P>
<P>
   He'd hopped on an early Friday-morning flight from South
Florida, where the Cardinals train. By afternoon, he was fielding
practice ground balls in a No. 2 Angels uniform.
</P>
<P>
   Now he'll have a week of Cactus League games to convince Angels
manager Mike Scioscia he's a better choice for opening-day second
baseman than Scott Spiezio or Trent Durrington. The Angels begin
the season April 3 at Edison Field against the New York Yankees.
</P>
<P>
   Stoneman seemed to be convinced before he made the trade.
</P>
<P>
   Kennedy was the keystone in the Thursday deal that brought
18-game winner Kent Bottenfield to the Angels and sent center
fielder Jim Edmonds to the Cardinals. Stoneman said he wouldn't
have agreed to a straight-up Bottenfield-for-Edmonds deal.
</P>
<P>
   ``I believe Adam Kennedy is ready to play at the major-league
level,''Stoneman said. ``We intend to throw him right into the
mix.''
</P>
<P>
   The Angels think Kennedy is the best all-around of the three
second-base candidates. He'll outhit Durrington and outfield
Spiezio. That fits the Kennedy portrait scouts have painted since
his Northridge days, when he was the Matadors' first three-time
All-America baseball player and the first player to lead the nation
in hits in back-to-back seasons.
</P>
<P>
   After the college junior was drafted by the Cardinals with the
20th pick of the first round in June 1997, the club's scouting
director described him as ``the best pure hitter in the draft'' and
a sure-handed, quick-footed infielder with a good head for
baseball. Two weeks later, Kennedy accepted a $650,000 signing
bonus, less than the going rate for a first-rounder, because he
wanted to get on with his pro career.
</P>
<P>
   Moved to second base after St. Louis traded for 23-year-old
shortstop Edgar Renteria, Kennedy was a .300-10 homers-20 steals
kind of player at Triple-A Memphis in 1999, and was named the
Cardinals' Minor League Player of the Year. A nice honor _ but only
a step toward the place Kennedy wants to be.
</P>
<P>
   In the big leagues. On opening day. And in October.
</P>
<P>
   ``As a player, as a competitor, you're trying to win wherever
you're at,'' Kennedy said. ``I'm trying to win every game. That's
the way I was raised.''
</P>
<P>
   Destination: the lineup card.

<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBUQUERQUE, N.M. _ They are Big Ten Conference rivals, but in
the case of Wisconsin and Purdue, familiarity breeds hostility, not
contempt. The last meeting between the Badgers and the
Boilermakers, a 78-66 Wisconsin victory in the quarterfinals of the
Big Ten tournament, surpassed the lofty standards of physical play
in the conference. It produced 49 fouls, 63 free throws, two cuts,
seven stitches and numerous bruises in a variety of colors.
</P>
<P>
   Purdue guard Carson Cunningham needed four stitches, and
Wisconsin guard Mike Kelley required three stitches to close wounds
from a head-on collision.
</P>
<P>
   Such accidents can happen in any game, but these teams have a
recent history of taking intensity to a higher level.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was about like a football game,'' Purdue center Greg McQuay
said. ``Maybe worse. It was brutal down in the low post with all
the elbows flying. We all had scratches and bruises.''
</P>
<P>
   If that game was a preview of Saturday's West Regional final of
the National Collegiate Athletic Association tournament, expect an
even more action-packed sequel. There will be no secrets in either
team's half-court games or the strategies of the two coaches,
Wisconsin's Dick Bennett and Purdue's Gene Keady, who both cited
Vince Lombardi as a profound influence.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a situation of how much more can we know about them after
three games,'' Keady said. ``Sometimes you can over-know
somebody.''
</P>
<P>
   A sense of urgency exists for both programs. Wisconsin has not
survived this far into the NCAA tournament since 1941, when it won
the national championship.
</P>
<P>
   Purdue has reached the Round of Eight for the second time in
Keady's 20 seasons at the school, but has yet to make the Final
Four.
</P>
<P>
   Purdue's patience and depth wore down Gonzaga in a 75-66 victory
Thursday night. As they hope to do against the Badgers, the
Boilermakers shut down the 3-point shooting of Gonzaga (5-20) and
capitalized on 20 offensive rebounds.
</P>
<P>
   Guard Jaraan Cornell broke out of a shooting slump to lead
Purdue with 18 points.
</P>
<P>
   ``The teams that have given us fits are the ones with a senior
point guard like Cornell,'' Bennett said. ``He's good. We've got to
keep him in check and hope that affects the rest of their
players.''
</P>
<P>
   Wisconsin's defense suffocated Louisiana State, forcing 23
turnovers. The Badgers shot only 38 percent, but hit four 3-point
shots at key moments in the second half to win easily.
</P>
<P>
   Guard Jon Bryant led them with 16 points and Mike Kelley had
five steals.
</P>
<P>
   ``The last three games in the tournament, we surprised opponents
with the defense we put on them,'' center Andy Kowske said.
``That's not going to be the case with Purdue. We both know what's
going to happen out there. They're going to be in our face, and
we're going to be in theirs.''
</P>
<P>
   The Badgers won two of the three games against Purdue this
season. On Jan. 26, they won, 55-45, as both teams combined for 45
fouls. On Jan. 15, Purdue routed Wisconsin by 72-52.
</P>
<P>
   They met again in the tunnel between Thursday night's semifinal
games at the Pit. The Badgers congratulated Purdue on their victory
over Gonzaga; the Boilermakers wished Wisconsin luck against LSU.
It is that grudging respect that should result in another physical
battle that may or may not be closely watched by the officials.
</P>
<P>
   ``If they call it close, there's going to be foul trouble on
both teams,'' Keady said.
</P>
<P>
   ``That would be a push,'' Bennett said. ``I don't want the
officials to swallow the whistles, so to speak. I want them to let
the kids determine the game.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ More than a thousand mourners filled a funeral home
in Brooklyn on Friday night to pay respects to Patrick Dorismond,
the 26-year-old security guard killed by a plainclothes policeman
last week.
</P>
<P>
   Dozens carried or wore the Haitian flag, and members of his
family of renowned Haitian musicians sang for him. Across Flatbush
Avenue, picketing protesters demanded justice for the fourth
unarmed black man to be killed by the police in the last 13 months.
</P>
<P>
   Inside the Andrew Torregrossa Funeral Home in Marine Park,
Dorismond lay in a coffin lined with white satin, underneath an
arch with his name written in white and green carnations. Several
women, overcome with grief, let out hoarse, muffled cries and had
to be escorted out.
</P>
<P>
   Johnny Dorismond, the victim's older brother, said his brother
had gone to a better place, in contrast to whoever killed him. ``If
he has a guilty conscience, that's his torture for life.''
</P>
<P>
   Dorismond was shot on March 16 after a plainclothes police
officer approached him outside a bar in midtown Manhattan and asked
if he knew where to buy marijuana. Dorismond reacted angrily, and
in the ensuing scuffle one of the officer's backups, Detective
Anthony Vasquez, shot him in the chest.
</P>
<P>
   Vasquez has said through his lawyer that the shooting was
accidental.
</P>
<P>
   The wake Friday night was attended by Haiti's consul general to
the United States, Therese Guitos, and by Alan Hevesi, the city
comptroller.
</P>
<P>
   ``The overwhelming majority of New Yorkers who are decent caring
people offer their most profound sympathy and understanding for
your loss,'' Hevesi told the Dorismond family. ``This is an awful,
awful day.''
</P>
<P>
   Outside the funeral home, about four dozen peaceful protesters,
surrounded by dozens of police officers in powder-blue
windbreakers, chanted and carried signs, mostly in Haitian Creole,
denouncing Mayor Rudolph Giuliani. Some of the signs compared the
mayor to a ``loup garou,'' a Haitian demon who seeks the blood of
babies.
</P>
<P>
   The death of Dorismond has inflamed political and racial
tensions in the city, not just because of the shooting itself but,
critics say, because of the way the Giuliani administration has
handled its aftermath.
</P>
<P>
   Shortly after the incident, Giuliani and Police Commissioner
Howard Safir released Dorismond's police record, including a sealed
court record of an incident when he was 13. They did not
immediately release Vasquez's disciplinary record _ which included
his shooting a neighbor's Rottweiler and pulling a gun in a 1997
bar fight.
</P>
<P>
   Critics, including Hillary Rodham Clinton, Giuliani's opponent
in the race for the U.S. Senate in New York, accused city officials
of blaming Dorismond for his own death. But the mayor said that he
was merely pointing out that Dorismond had acted violently in the
past and might have acted violently in the moments that led to the
shooting.
</P>
<P>
   Dorismond was a security guard for the 34th Street Partnership
and had two children. He was never convicted of a crime as an
adult. His arrests for punching a man in an argument over drugs in
1993 and for pulling a gun during a traffic dispute in 1996
resulted in disorderly-conduct charges, for which he did community
service, and no jail time. The case against him in 1987, when he
was 13, was dropped.
</P>
<P>
   His death was a bitter blow to Haitian Americans, still reeling
from the brutalization by the police of Abner Louima, who in 1997
was sodomized with a stick in a Brooklyn precinct station house
after being arrested in a case of mistaken identity.
</P>
<P>
   And Dorismond's death comes soon after the verdict on Feb. 25 in
the Amadou Diallo case, where four plainclothes police officers
were cleared of criminal charges after firing 41 shots at the
unarmed Guinean street peddler, hitting him 41 times.
</P>
<P>
   Five days after that verdict, Malcolm Ferguson, 23, and also
black and unarmed, was killed by plainclothes officers in the
Bronx, three blocks from where Diallo was shot. The other unarmed
black man killed by the police recently was Richard Watson, who was
shot in the back last September.
</P>

   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   At Dorismond's wake, Delroy LaRoc, a friend of Dorismond since
1989, when they attended high school together, remembered making
music with him.
</P>
<P>
   ``He would be the beat and I would be the lyrics,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   LaRoc recalled how his friend recently celebrated receiving his
tax refund by taking him out to a $90.07 dinner.
</P>
<P>
   ``He ate so much food, you just gotta love him,'' he said. ``The
next day he got up and went to work, and after work he never came
back.''
</P>
<P>
   Dorismond's death left one mourner, Felix Serieux, 12, of East
New York, afraid and perplexed.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's just sad,'' said Felix, a seventh-grader. ``It makes
afraid for my own life, you understand. ```Say no to drugs.' They
tell you that in school, to say no. So what happens now? Do you
have to say yes?''

RAPIST IS EVALUATED IN EFFORT TO CONFINE HIM 
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   HACKENSACK, N.J. _ A rapist who was captured this week after a
nationwide manhunt has undergone a court-ordered psychiatric
evaluation as part of the state's effort to have him committed to a
treatment center as a violent sexual predator, a state official
involved in the case said Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Judge Joseph S. Conte of Superior Court, who conducts New
Jersey's commitment hearings, ordered the examination Thursday of
the rapist, Raymond Alves, at the request of the state attorney
general, John J. Farmer Jr., the state official said. No date has
been set for a hearing on whether he should be committed, the
official said.
</P>
<P>
   Alves, 57, a convicted rapist, has been held without bail in the
Bergen County Jail since his arrest on Tuesday night, 12 days after
his bungled release from a state prison enraged law-enforcement
officials in northern New Jersey and touched off a nationwide
search.
</P>
<P>
   He spent nearly all the time he was hunted as a fugitive on a
meandering bus journey through the East, South and Southwest.
Law-enforcement authorities captured him in the rural hamlet of
Annandale in western New Jersey after receiving a tip that he
planned to take a commuter train there, the authorities said.
</P>
<P>
   After Alves was freed on March 9, William H. Schmidt, the Bergen
County prosecutor, called him a threat to public safety because of
his conviction for raping one teen-age girl in Bergen County and
throwing another off a railroad bridge in 1976.
</P>
<P>
   Schmidt also denounced prison officials for freeing Alves
without providing his office with a 30-day notice, which is
required under New Jersey's law dealing with the release of sex
offenders, commonly known as Megan's Law.
</P>
<P>
   Schmidt has said he would have used the 30 days to start civil
commitment proceedings against Alves.
</P>
<P>
   To obtain a commitment under state law, the authorities must
prove that Alves suffers from a mental abnormality or a personality
disorder that makes him likely to commit another violent sexual
crime unless he is confined for treatment.
</P>
<P>
   Under the law, commitment hearings are closed to the public
unless a sex offender waives his privacy rights.
</P>
<P>
   Alves is now charged with only a minor felony that carries an
18-month prison term: violating the sex-offender law by lying about
the address he was to have after after prison. A bail hearing is
scheduled in Superior Court here on Monday.

<P>
   ROBERT-GOBER-ART (Washington) _ Robert Gober, 46, is among the
best known of the American artists who established careers during
the late 1980s and 1990s, a time when AIDS, identity politics and
culture wars produced a surreal, gothic, dystopian sensibility in
art. His work is much in evidence this spring, both in the
traveling survey ``Robert Gober: Sculptures and Drawings'' at the
Hirshhorn and in the 2000 Biennial that opened at the Whitney
Museum of American Art in New York last week. In the Hirshhorn show
in particular it is art that feels resonant with a recent past but
in tune with art shaping up in a new decade. By Holland Cotter.

   CZECH-PHILHARMONIC (Prague, Czech Republic) _ The Czech
Philharmonic, led by its chief conductor Vladimir Ashkenazy, will
give the first of three concerts this Sunday at Avery Fisher Hall
in New York City, having just completed two weeks of touring in
Florida and California. These concerts, the orchestra's first in
New York since 1996, consist mostly of Bohemian or Czech music and
are part of Lincoln Center's Prague Festival, which celebrates the
10th anniversary of the Velvet Revoution and began Saturday with a
symposium on the cultural history of Prague. By James R. Oestreich.

   BEAU-TRAVAIL-FILM (New York) _ Dressed in a leather jacket and
jeans, the director Claire Denis, whose latest film, ``Beau
Travail,'' opens on Friday, has a casual sophistication. At 49, she
is petite, intense, reticent and, on occasion, disarmingly honest.
The daughter of a French civil servant, Ms. Denis grew up in
Cameroon in West Africa during the final days of the colonial
empire. ``Beau Travail,'' the story of a troop of French Foreign
Legionnaires, is set in present-day Djibouti, in East Africa. By

   PEOPLE-OF-THE-WIND-VIDEO (Undated) _ Anthony Howarth's ``People

of Iran as they drive a million sheep, goats and pack animals into
great boulder fields, across icy turquoise rivers, upward into
mountain passes and down to vast expanses of pasture. By Peter M.

   RUSSIAN-HAMLET-BALLET (New York) _ As far as Russian czars go,
Paul I is not exactly a household name in the West or a likely
subject for a ballet. Unlike his mother, Catherine the Great, he
was not even worth a costume drama with a film superstar (Marlene
Dietrich in ``The Scarlet Empress''). Serious historians, however,
are familiar with his turbulent life and reign in the 18th century,
and the verdict is not positive. But to the Russian choreographer
Boris Eifman, Paul was a young idealist whose spirit was broken by
the murderous court milieu that turned him into a tyrant. That, he
said, is why his new ballet, ``Russian Hamlet (the Son of Catherine
the Great),'' focuses on the youthful Paul, still to be czar. By

<P>
   JAVA-PUPPET-THEATER (Cirebon, Java) _ In Java, the world's most
populous island and the political and cultural center of Indonesia,
the traditional drama still mainly survives the way it has for
centuries: by popular demand. Itinerant puppeteers, known as
dalangs, travel from village to village, performing the ancient
tales of gods and demons, heroes and fools, for anyone with the
wherewithal to hire them. In most cultures, puppets imitate human
actors; in Java and the neighboring island of Bali, the reverse is
true. The traditional dramas have always been performed with
puppets; indeed, the Indonesian word for puppet, wayang, is used to
denote the various forms of the drama. When a piece is performed by
people, for example, it is called the wayang orang _ literally, a
human puppet show. By Jamie James. (Moved). WITH PHOTO. &QL;

</P>
<P>
   NIETZSCHE-THEATER (New York) _ Has Richard Foreman, 62, found
his alter ego at last? Could it be that the poor mad philosopher
Friedrich Nietzsche is the perfect analogue for the playwright and
director, who for more than 30 years has been breaking the
boundaries of theater to combine the surreal, the disordered, the
mysterious and, sometimes, the just plain nutty? This year is the
centenary of Nietzsche's death, and he is the subject of Foreman's
new play, ``Bad Boy Nietzsche!,'' currently at his
Ontological-Hysteric Theater at St. Mark's Church in Manhattan. By
Dinitia Smith. (Moved).  &QL;

<P>
   &UR; CLASSICAL MUSIC &LR;  &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   THEATER-NOISE (New York) _ Every so often, a critic feels
compelled to write a crabby column about the rudeness of audience
members. Such columns seldom do much good, but at least the critic
feels better. The traditional disruptions, like coughing, will
always be with us. But although colds afflict us all, the kind of
unabashed hacking that you hear from people who don't even seem to
be trying to control themselves has to be a passive-aggressive
expression of boredom. Some irritants are particularly exasperating
because they are so preventable. Why would a woman choose to adorn
her wrist with a clinking set of bracelets when she goes to the
opera, so that every time she fidgets in her seat or tinkers with
her Met Titles she becomes a human wind chime? Crinkling plastic
bags drive me nuts. The cell phone represents a new level of
intrusiveness. So far this season, it has been the rare concert or
opera I've attended during which at least one didn't ring. By
Anthony Tommasini. (Moved). &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ZAMPA-OPERA (New York) _ ``Zampa,'' the pirate king in Ferdinand
Herrold's opera, introduced to wild acclaim at the Opera-Comique in
Paris in 1831, remained a fixture in French, Italian and German
opera houses throughout the 19th century. Today the overture is the
sole excerpt that enjoys any name recognition, and that only
barely. A whirlwind potpourri of infectious tunes from the opera,
it displays orchestration of a zest and finesse that recalls Weber,
Mendelssohn and Berlioz. On April 3, at Alice Tully Hall, a concert
revival by L'Opera Francais de New York _ with narration written
and delivered by the composer's descendant Alexander Herold
replacing the original spoken dialogue _ restores the subsequent
action in what is said to be the opera's first New York airing in
more than a hundred years. By Matthew Gurewitsch. (Moved). WITH

   &UR; POP MUSIC &LR;  &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   JAZZ-MAINSTREAM (Undated) _ Jazz is a music of unmistakable
personalities. Though ensemble interaction between these
personalities remains one of the music's glories, the expression of
individual identity has always been the essence of jazz, with
players cultivating solo sounds as singular as fingerprints.
Increasingly, though, classic recordings by these consummate
individualists are being deployed as a sort of mood music,
background noise for everything from Broadway drama to television
hucksterism to coffee bar drinking. Some view this as a sign of
jazz's mainstreaming, its wider dissemination. Still, how
distressing it is to hear music conceived as the purest
distillation of individuality rendered so anonymously. By Barry
Singer. (Moved).  &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   NY-IMPRESARIOS (New York) _ These days, in the brave world of
new music in New York, versatility is the key word. Limor Tomer, a
Juilliard-trained pianist and former music history teacher at New
York University, is one of a small but avid group of advocates who
are presenting music that falls between the cracks of genres. It is
music that won't fill 600-seat auditoriums but may be the
wellspring for mainstream music to come. Call Tomer and her ilk
downtown Diaghilevs, mini-impresarios, or settle for a less
grandiose term, music curator. By Eric V. Copage. (Moved). WITH

   DESIGN-ARCHITECTURE (Undated) _ Design has abandoned Socrates
for Nietzsche. This is the take-away idea at the first edition of
the National Design Triennial at the Cooper-Hewitt Museum. No more
pure geometric shapes. No more strict correspondences between form
and function. No more efforts to refine materials and production
methods to their pure Platonic essence. Instead, we behold room
after room of dancing stars. Fluid shapes. Appetizing colors.
Laughter in the dark. Flesh. Organized by the curatorial team of
Donald Albrecht, Ellen Lupton and Steven Skov Holt, this is the
first of a series of surveys to be conducted every three years by
the Cooper-Hewitt, the Smithsonian Institution's New York venue for
the study and exhibition of design. By Herbert Muschamp. (Moved).

<P>
   BRAUN-PHOTOGS (Undated) _ The interplay of aesthetic and
commercial concerns in the 19th century is vividly set forth in
``Image and Enterprise: The Photographs of Adolphe Braun,'' at the
Rhode Island School of Design in Providence through April 22 and at
the Cleveland Museum of Art from June 18 through Aug. 27. The first
American show to examine Braun's career, it features 100 of his
photographs, along with related material. By Vicki Goldberg.

<P>
   ROMAN-GLASS-ART (New York) _ A stunning variety of glass objects
in daily use in sixth century Rome incorporates virtually every
glass-working technique known today, as can be seen in ``Roman
Glass: Reflections on Cultural Change,'' an exhibition at the Bard
Graduate Center for Studies in the Decorative Arts in Manhattan,
through June 11. The 200 pieces date from the first century B.C. to
the sixth century A.D. and were selected from the university of
Pennsylvania Museum in Philadelphia by Stuart Fleming, the show's
curator. It is the first exhibition of the museum's collection of
ancient glass since the museum opened a century ago. By Rita Reif.

   TV-WONDERLAND (Undated) _ The scene in the opening episode of
ABC's ``Wonderland'' is harrowing. A pregnant doctor in the
emergency room of a hospital patterned after New York's Bellevue
intervenes when a violently unhinged patient tries to harm himself
with a syringe. In the scuffle that follows, the syringe pierces
the doctor's stomach. ``It's a powerful scene,'' said Lloyd Braun,
co-chairman of the ABC Television Entertainment Group. ``Like any
series that pushes the envelope _ and this one clearly does _ there
may be some people who will find the show too intense. But we
repeatedly talk at the network about how important it is to take
risks with programming. Without question, this show represents a
risk.'' The risk, of course, is that a drama about psychiatric
patients and their doctors will prove simply too unsettling to
network audiences accustomed to sitcom humor and twentysomething
angst. By Bernard Weinraub. (Moved). WITH PHOTO. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   TV-FOUNTAIN-OF-YOUTH (New York) _ ``The Fountain of Youth,''
written and directed by Orson Welles, the pilot for an anthology
series, and rarely seen, will be presented at the Museum of
Television and Radio along with an Edward R. Murrow interview and a
very funny 1956 ``I Love Lucy'' episode with Welles as guest star.
(The program begins on Friday and runs through May 7 at the museum
in New York and through May 31 in Los Angeles. By Caryn James.

MAN ADMITS FRAUD IN JOINING CD CLUBS THOUSANDS OF TIMES 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   For the second time since November, a New Jersey man has pleaded
guilty to defrauding mail-order music clubs of thousands of compact
discs by using false names and addresses to exploit the clubs'
introductory offers.
</P>
<P>
   The man, Joseph Parvin, 60, said that between 1993 and 1998 he
received 26,554 compact discs addressed to 2,417 customer accounts
at 16 post office boxes and slight variations on the address of his
house in Lawrenceville. He got the discs from BMG Music Services
and Columbia House Music Club, both based in Manhattan.
</P>
<P>
   He pleaded guilty Friday before Judge Alfred M. Wolin in U.S.
District Court in Newark to one count of mail fraud, and faces up
to five years in prison and a $250,000 fine when sentenced June 13.
</P>
<P>
   Parvin's lawyer, William F. Maderer, said Parvin also ran a
legitimate business registering and selling Internet domain names.
</P>
<P>
   In November, David Russo, 33, of Aberdeen Township, pleaded
guilty to cheating the same two mail-order companies out of more
than 22,000 CDs valued at $350,000.
</P>
<P>
   Russo, who is to be sentenced by Judge Joseph A. Greenaway of
U.S. District Court in Newark, sold the discs at flea markets.
</P>
<P>
   In both cases, the men took advantage of the companies' offer of
free CDs in exchange for agreeing to future purchases. Columbia
House, for example, now offers 15 free CDs if a customer agrees to
buy just 5 at full price over a two-year period, said Maura
McLoughlin, a company spokeswoman.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. attorney in the case, Scott S. Christie, said the
independence and the magnitude of the two schemes suggested that
others may be doing the same thing.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is absolutely no evidence we know of that connects Russo
and Parvin, which makes you wonder how prevalent this kind of thing
is,'' he said.

SENATOR IS POSSIBLE VICE PRESIDENTIAL CONTENDER 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By DAVID M. HERSZENHORN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   BRIDGEPORT, Conn. _ In New York there is the colossal battle
known as Hillary vs. Rudy. In the Senate race in New Jersey, the
winner of a hugely expensive fight for the Democratic nomination
will face the survivor of a four-way clash among obscure
Republicans. But in Connecticut, things are so quiet that voters
could be forgiven for not realizing that Sen. Joseph Lieberman is
actually up for re-election.
</P>
<P>
   Lieberman, a two-term Democrat, has sky-high approval ratings,
overflowing campaign coffers and, as yet, no opponent. The one
Republican who has expressed any interest in mounting a challenge,
Mayor Philip Giordano of Waterbury, has been discouraged from doing
so by two of the most important members of his party, Gov. John
Rowland and the state Republican chairman, Chris DePino.
</P>
<P>
   So when Lieberman's name comes up these days, it is not in terms
of the Senate race in November but the result of a recent bubble of
speculation about him as a possible running mate for Al Gore.
</P>
<P>
   In a more substantive way, though, the lack of a U.S. Senate
contest in Connecticut is allowing Lieberman to do actual work,
like crisscrossing the state last week to visit schools and push
for a major new education bill. ``This bill actually dramatically
increases federal support of education, by $7 billion,'' he told
the 40 students in the senior class at Bridge Academy, a charter
school in downtown Bridgeport, last Friday.
</P>
<P>
   In many ways, the visit encapsulated Lieberman's current
political state: his confidence, his popularity and his bipartisan
reputation.
</P>
<P>
   Bridge Academy, with 160 students, was founded three years ago
with the help of federal money made possible by a bill Lieberman
sponsored with a Republican senator, Dave Durenberger of Minnesota.
Lieberman arrived at the school to thunderous applause, smiled
proudly as students told him of the school's success and spoke
earnestly of the need for more federal money to replace a start-up
grant that ends this year.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's nice to hear it,'' Lieberman said of the recent
speculation, which includes a column urging his selection as a vice
presidential candidate in the Capitol Hill journal Roll Call last
week and a recent article in the conservative Weekly Standard.
``But I don't expect it,'' he added.
</P>
<P>
   A list of possible vice presidential contenders in the magazine
Campaigns and Elections also puts him on the Democratic short list.
</P>
<P>
   Far-fetched as a spot on the national ticket may be, the fact
that Lieberman, 58, an observant Jew who does not work on the
Sabbath, is mentioned at all is testimony to his stature, both in
the Democratic Party and in the Senate.
</P>
<P>
   One reason for his increased prominence was his willingness to
become the first Democrat to condemn President Clinton publicly for
his affair with Monica Lewinsky, a stand that reinforced
Lieberman's reputation as one of the Senate's stronger moral
voices.
</P>
<P>
   But much of his rise has to do with his reputation as an
independent-minded New Democrat whose religious observance is
appreciated by some of his more conservative colleagues across the
aisle and whose policy interests have at times diverged with the
majority view in the Democratic Party. For example, he speaks
favorably about school vouchers.
</P>
<P>
   ``People don't want you to agree with them on everything,''
Lieberman said over tea and a cheese omelet at a Bridgeport diner
last Friday. ``They want to feel that you are doing what you feel
is right. Part of what I have tried to do is be independent and not
walk the political party line if I didn't think the party happened
to be right in that case. And this state is very supportive of that
kind of representation.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   (Phoenix) - Phoenix area gas prices have increased an average of
a penny a day this month, but motorists aren't budging from behind
their steering wheels.
</P>
<P>
   Local transportation officials say they have no evidence that
people are driving less, although the current $1.58-per-gallon
average for gas has made the drive more bumpy.
</P>
<P>
   Teresa Bejarano, a shift leader at a downtown Pizza Hut, said
she first started hearing complaints from her delivery drivers two
weeks ago. Now, the drivers, who pay for their own gas, are asking
for a raise.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're very upset because the gas price is so high,'' she
said. ``They put $5 in, and it doesn't get them nowhere. It very
definitely makes a great difference in their pocket.''
</P>
<P>
   AAA Arizona has been tracking the steady climb in gas prices.
But spokeswoman Laura Rightenburg says she's seen no change on the
road.
</P>
<P>
   ``Personally, on my drives to and from work, even though we've
been preaching a lot of fuel conservation, I'm not seeing anybody
changing their driving behavior,'' she said. ``Unless, of course,
there's a police officer next to them.''

POLITA GRAU, 84; HEADED EFFORT ON BEHALF OF CUBAN CHILDREN 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By WOLFGANG SAXON   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Polita Grau, a daughter of a prominent Cuban political family
who helped to spirit thousands of children out of Castro Cuba,
which later jailed her for 14 years as a CIA conspirator, died
March 22 at a nursing home in Miami. She was 84.
</P>
<P>
   Grau, politically engaged since adolescence, spent four separate
periods in exile in Miami because of her work. There, many admired
her as a patron of the Catholic Church-sponsored Operacion Pedro
Pan to give Cuban children a non-Communist education.
</P>
<P>
   She came to Miami from her native Havana for the first time
during her senior year in high school, graduating there from a
local parochial school.
</P>
<P>
   She was a niece of Dr. Ramon Grau San Martin, a professor of
physiology who served as Cuba's provisional president in 1933 and
'34 and as president from 1944 to 1948. During his first term,
Grau, a bachelor, made his niece, then known as Maria Leopoldina
Grau, his official first lady at state events.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Grau had been a central figure in the student rebellion
against President Gerardo Machado (1925-33), a nationalist who grew
increasingly autocratic. Ms. Grau was involved in the campus
rebellion as a member of radical and liberal student groups.
</P>
<P>
   Born into a wealthy family, she at first also supported the
movement that sent the dictator Fulgencio Batista into exile in
1959. But her enthusiasm for the ensuing Castro regime did not last
when it instituted its program of nationalizing businesses.
</P>
<P>
   With her brother, Ramon Grau Alsina, she helped send some 14,000
children to Miami in the early 1960s. They were the offspring of
parents who feared their Communist indoctrination or were involved
in the anti-Castro resistance.
</P>
<P>
   Operacion Pedro Pan smuggled them out of Cuba with the help of
the State Department. Once in the United States, they were placed
by the church in camps or foster homes; some of them were never
reunited with their parents.
</P>
<P>
   Grau and her brother were arrested in 1965 and accused of
plotting to overthrow Fidel Castro, who was then Cuba's prime
minister. They were convicted for their role in Pedro Pan and of
having had dealings with the CIA, which denied the connection.
</P>
<P>
   They both got 30-year sentences, but Ms. Grau was freed in 1978
when Castro released a large number of political prisoners as part
of a relaxation encouraged by President Jimmy Carter. Ramon Grau
was freed in 1986 and followed her to Miami, where he died in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Grau's survivors include a daughter, Hilda Aguero, six
grandchildren, and one great-granddaughter.

 SNOWBIRDS ARE CRUCIAL IN (For use by N.Y. Times News Service
 clients) 
 BY MAUREEN WEST AND
 SHAUN MCKINNON 
 c.2000 The Arizona Republic 
<TEXT>
<P>
   (Phoenix) - It's an uncivil tug-of-war between Arizona and other
states, and befuddled retirees are the rope.
</P>
<P>
   ``People don't know what the heck to do,'' said Beverly Houwman
of Minnesota, who along with an esti mated 180,000 other U.S.
snowbirds will spend April 1, the official U.S. Census Day, in
Arizona.
</P>
<P>
   Should they list Arizona, where they consume state resources, or
their hometowns in the Midwest and elsewhere, where they have emo
tional roots?
</P>
<P>
   Depending on which state these snowbirds declare as ``home'' on
census forms, Arizona could gain or lose upward of $720 million
over the next decade in federal tax dollars.
</P>
<P>
   There is no in-between.
</P>
<P>
   Census forms have no provision for dual-state residency, though
that is how a growing number of Americans live, especially
retirees.
</P>
<P>
   The Arizona Winter Visitors Associ ation in Apache Junction gets
daily calls from snowbirds confused about which state to list as
``home'' in this year's census. And Census Bureau offices in
snowbird-exporting com munities, like Fargo, N.D., also are swamped
with calls from Arizona and Florida retirement communities.
</P>
<P>
   Arizona, which finds itself feeding these retirees in senior
centers, pro tecting them with paramedic services and paving the
roads they drive on, wants them to write down Arizona as their
home.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have been telling snowbirds that if they are in the Valley
April 1, they should fill out the form here,'' said Dan Austin,
president of the Arizona Winter Visitors Association. ``That is
what we have been told by the census office.''
</P>
<P>
   But faraway towns and states are asking their wandering retirees
to list them as their home. Minnesota officials have shown up at
Arizona events, such as last month's Minne sota Picnic in Mesa,
handing out leaflets and message-embossed pen cils, telling
wandering Minnesotans to list their old home on the census.
</P>
<P>
   An estimated 300,000 retired winter visitors stay in Arizona.
Although January and February are the peak months, about
three-fourths of them still are here April 1. Of those, as many as
180,000 are U.S. residents.
</P>
<P>
   Many retirees stay from October through May, but still declare
some where else as their home on the census forms. They may fear
having to pay the extra freight here: Car tags and insurance, for
example, are often more expensive in Arizona. But the census forms
are confidential and not used for determining residency status,
even for illegal immigrants who are counted.
</P>
<P>
   Each person counted in a state translates into more federal
dollars and more representatives in Con gress. Every extra Arizonan
counted adds $3,500 to $4,000 in federal funds over the next 10
years, accord ing to various estimates. That money goes to health
care, transportation and social service programs.
</P>
<P>
   Although Arizonans 65 and over make up about 14 percent of the
population, the same as the national average, the number of
retirement age residents here would grow to nearly 19 percent if
all Ariozna snowbirds were counted, according to Tom Rex of the
Arizona Center for Business Development.
</P>
<P>
   Many believe senior services suffer in Arizona and other Sun
Belt states because they serve more elders than indicated by past
census statistics.
</P>
<P>
   ``Go to any senior center during the winter and you will find
winter visitors eating lunch for free,'' said Anne Lindeman,
executive director of the Arizona Governor's Advisory Council on
Aging. Some of it evens out, she adds, when Arizona-based retirees
travel northward in the summer.
</P>
<P>
   Delia Garcia Kim, Arizona's census director, said the state
isn't actively campaigning to persuade winter visi tors to consider
this their official home. But ``in all fairness to the community,
if they're spending a significant amount of time here, they're
using community resources,'' she said. ``They may not think of this
as their home, but in reality, if they're spending time here, it
is.''
</P>
<P>
   A ``significant amount of time'' generally is defined as six
months and a day, or more than half the year, Garcia Kim said. When
asked, state officials will tell visitors this: If they're here on
or about April 1, they should mark Arizona as home.
</P>
<P>
   Arizona cities with large winter visitor populations also have
kept their efforts low-key, but encourage people to consider the
services they use when they're in Arizona.
</P>
<P>
   ``Wherever you use the most govern ment services or spend the
majority of your year is where you should answer the census from,''
Peoria spokesman Kelly Corsette said.
</P>
<P>
   Robert Hall, field operations man ager for the Census Bureau's
Phoe nix office, said the general rule when filling out a census
form is to base the information on a person's ``usual address,''
where he or she lives most of the time. For most people, that's not
difficult, but for winter visitors the issue gets confusing, he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Lowell Lundberg, a retired lawyer who divides his time evenly
between Fargo and a home in Mesa, has no doubt about what he wants.
If he has to choose ``home,'' which seems to be the case this year
with the census, it's North Dakota.
</P>
<P>
   ``With our low population, we have a heck of a time hanging on
to people,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Lundberg has been checking his mailbox each day to see whether
his census form from North Dakota has been forwarded. But census
forms aren't forwarded because they are addressed to the residence,
not the individual. Still, many travelers have their mail forwarded
anyway, by family, friends or a private mail service. Lundberg did
receive a cen sus form, but it was addressed to his Mesa residence.
</P>
<P>
   Starting in late April and continuing through July, census
workers will begin visiting homes that didn't return forms.
</P>
<P>
   A major effort is planned for RV camps in Arizona's deserts.

 By EDDIE SEFKO  
 c. 2000, Houston Chronicle  
PONTE VEDRA BEACH, Fla. _ Mulligans are fine on the first hole. But
you don't get many in life. And Fulton Allem would like to have
avoided this particular do-over.
<TEXT>
<P>
   The 43-year-old South African, who might as well have been
enjoying early retirement given his thorough lack of success the
past six years on the PGA Tour, had to tee it up again in his
personal life, going through a divorce that he called pathetic.
</P>
<P>
   As he recounted it in great detail Friday, ``They're all
pathetic, as far as I'm concerned.''
</P>
<P>
   Oddly, Allem's comments came after an incredibly good round.
</P>
<P>
   His 7-under-par 65 scorched the Tournament Players Course at
Sawgrass and propelled him into solid contention at the midpoint of
The Players Championship. Hal Sutton leads at 6-under 138 after his
second consecutive 69.
</P>
<P>
   But at 4-under 140, Allem is right in the hunt _ unexpectedly
so. His sudden bolt of greatness caught just about everybody off
guard.
</P>
<P>
   Allem has been so far off the radar since his magical season in
1993 that he was considered lost. He has not had a top-three finish
since '93, when he won twice, including the Colonial in Fort Worth.
The first of his three career wins was the Independent Insurance
Agents Open at The Woodlands in 1991.
</P>
<P>
   On Friday, Allem fired verbal darts at his ex-wife, slow play on
tour, Tiger Woods and cursing _ which by the way, is one of his
favorite pastimes.
</P>
<P>
   But it was clear that his protracted stretch of pitiful play on
tour was directly related to his divorce _ in Allem's mind, at
least.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was on the golf course, but my mind was nowhere near golf,''
Allem said of those bad years. ``I tried to play through it all,
and it leads to frustration, then it leads to losing your
confidence. Fortunately, I got my mulligan. It's a pity it didn't
happen 10 years ago.''
</P>
<P>
   Allem added: ``I couldn't care less what my ex-wife does. She
just must take care of my kids.''
</P>
<P>
   Allem's story of despair is a tough one. But it's no more
shocking than the fact he was fined and suspended last year for
cursing aloud at the PGA Tour event in Reno, Nev., and that he
openly berates fellow pros for playing too slow.
</P>
<P>
   Because of his brash, sometimes crude nature, a few of Allem's
cohorts on tour would rather see anybody else have a good day on
the course. He's not the most popular figure on tour, partly
because he has a little Charles Barkley in him. He says what he
thinks, and the consequences don't concern him.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some of them like me, and some of them think I'm a jackass,''
Allem said. ``What can I tell you? Nobody's perfect.''
</P>
<P>
   As Sutton said: ``If you don't want to hear how things really
are, don't talk to Fulton.''
</P>
<P>
   Now living near Orlando, Fla., Allem has started a new life with
his girlfriend. But the divorce from his first wife, Colleen, left
him bitter.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was leading the Colonial (in '93) going into the last
round,'' Allem said. ``My ex-wife and two kids were flying back to
South Africa, so they weren't going to get to watch the final
round.
</P>
<P>
   ``I won the tournament, and I knew I'd be able to call South
Africa if I waited a few hours. I called, and she answered. I was
so excited. I said: `Hi, sweetheart, I just won the golf
tournament.'
</P>
<P>
   ``She said: `I don't love you anymore. I want a divorce. I'm not
coming back to the United States.' That was it.''
</P>
<P>
   The pair tried to patch things up. Allem won the World Series of
Golf later in '93.
</P>
<P>
   ``Then she came running,'' Allem said. ``There was money. She
came running. Then we spent the next four or five years between
misery and happiness. Eventually, she left with some ski instructor
from Denver.''
</P>
<P>
   Where Colleen now lives with the kids. As always, there are two
sides to this story. But for Allem, all that matters is the
present, not the past.
</P>
<P>
   His separation from Colleen was the start of the lean times for
Allem, who never finished higher than 109th on the money list from
1994-99.
</P>
<P>
   Since then? Allem has become notorious for other things, like
his intolerance of slow play.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just think it's wrong,'' Allem said. ``Bob Estes, I played
with him the first time and wrote it right across his scorecard:
`You are too slow.'
</P>
<P>
   ``We should all try to play the game within the rules. Etiquette
is not a small city in France. You have 40 seconds. Don't stand
there and mess around, because it's not fair to everybody else.''
</P>
<P>
   And Allem will vent his frustration when things don't go his
way. He was fined and suspended for a week last year for cursing
near an elderly woman.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Woods, who is four shots out of the lead and only two
behind Allem, doesn't intimidate Allem in the least.
</P>
<P>
   ``Not unless he's got a gun,'' Allem said. ``I know a lot of
them (other players) are (intimidated). But I'm going for the
gusto.
</P>
<P>
   ``Look, the kid is great. He's the best player, bar none. But
you have to go out there and enjoy the challenge, not go out there
and say: `I wonder how I'm going to beat this guy.' If I look at
his record and look at my record, ain't no way.
</P>
<P>
   ``But he can make mistakes. You might hole a 6-iron.''
</P>
<P>
   On Friday, Allem birdied five of his first seven holes,
including a 35-foot bomb on the par-4 14th. He then eagled the
par-5 second hole when his 2-iron cozied to within five feet of the
hole.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a lot of luck involved shooting 65 on a course like
this in these conditions,'' said Allem, who added his putting was
crucial. ``For the last 10 years, all I've done is hit the ball and
putt like an absolute idiot.''
</P>
<P>
   Of course, there were mitigating factors. And Allem hopes never
to repeat the personal problems.

MARK LOMBARDI, 48, ARTIST INSPIRED BY SCANDALS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Texas, N.H., Calif.)  (lb) 
 By ROBERTA SMITH   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Mark Lombardi, an artist whose elegant, minutely
detailed diagrams of political and financial scandals brought a
distinctive voice to late conceptualism, was found hanged in his
loft in Brooklyn on Wednesday evening, the police said. He was 48.
</P>
<P>
   A police spokesman said that an autopsy had been ordered by the
medical examiner.
</P>
<P>
   As an artist, Lombardi was an unusual case: a late bloomer who
developed his mature style after the age of 40, but who was
experiencing the rapid ascent of a younger artist.
</P>
<P>
   One of his large drawings, an airy composition of small circles
and crisscrossing arced lines that resembled rose windows or
fanciful architectural rendering, is included in the ``Greater New
York'' exhibition at P.S. 1 in Long Island City.
</P>
<P>
   Lombardi's interest in presenting pure information qualified him
as a conceptual artist, but in many ways he was an investigative
reporter after the fact.
</P>
<P>
   He liked to say that his drawings were probably best understood
by the newspaper reporters who had covered the scandals he
diagramed.
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes measuring as much as 10 feet across, these drawings
nonetheless had tremendous visual verve, delicately tracing the
convoluted unfoldings of contemporary morality tales like the
savings and loan scandal, Whitewater, Iran-contra and the Vatican
bank scandal.
</P>
<P>
   The small circles in his drawings identified the main players _
individuals, corporations and governments _ along a time line. The
arcing lines showed personal and professional links, conflicts of
interest, malfeasance and fraud.
</P>
<P>
   Solid lines traced influence, dotted lines traced assets and
wavy lines traced frozen assets. Final denouements like court
judgment, bankruptcy and death were noted in red.
</P>
<P>
   Lombardi, who was born in Syracuse in 1951, received a
bachelor's degree in art history from Syracuse University. After
graduating from college he moved to Houston, where he worked
briefly as an assistant curator at the Museum of Contemporary Art.
</P>
<P>
   Lombardi ran a small gallery while making abstract paintings on
the side. He began making his drawings in 1993, inspired by a
doodled diagram he had made while talking on the phone to a banker
friend about the savings and loan scandal.
</P>
<P>
   Reading several newspapers a day, he culled his information
entirely from published sources, keeping track of the articles with
a card file that eventually held more than 12,000 cards.
</P>
<P>
   Lombardi began exhibiting his drawings in Houston in 1995. He
came to wider attention in a group show at the Drawing Center in
SoHo in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   He moved to New York and had his first solo show, ``Silent
Partners,'' in 1998 at Pierogi 2000, a gallery in Brooklyn. His
second show, ``Vicious Circles,'' was at the Devon Golden Gallery
in Manhattan in 1999.
</P>
<P>
   Lombardi, whose marriage ended in divorce, is survived by his
parents, Donald A. and Shirley Rolfe Lombardi, of Manlius; two
sisters, Lisa La Rue of Clayton and Laura Miels of Hopkinton, N.H.;
and a brother, Matthew Lombardi, of Anselmo, Calif.

HELEN VENTURELLI, 86; FOUGHT FOR POLICE WIDOWS 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By DOUGLAS MARTIN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Helen Venturelli, a champion of better benefits for
widows of police officers and firefighters killed on the job, died
March 15 at Westchester Square Hospital in the Bronx. She was 86
and lived in the Bronx.
</P>
<P>
   In 1943, Venturelli's husband, Pasquale, a policeman, leapt onto
the running board of an automobile to try to apprehend two
teen-agers who were stealing the car. He died instantly when they
rammed the vehicle into a wall.
</P>
<P>
   Venturelli was left with two sons, Robert, 9, and Alfred, 7, and
a pension of $125 a month, with no increases for inflation. She
earned extra money from various part-time jobs, and was eager to
get involved when Florence Churchill, who was trying to raise three
children with polio on a $125 monthly pension after her husband
died in the line of duty, wrote her in 1960 about forming an
organization to fight for higher payments to police widows.
</P>
<P>
   At the first meeting of what became the Police and Fire Line of
Duty Widows of New York City, Venturelli pressed to include
firefighters' widows, a suggestion that was immediately embraced.
The group started a series of demonstrations at City Hall and
elsewhere, and in 1962 won an increase in pensions equal to half
the average monthly salary of a police officer, $347. In 1968,
after years of struggle, they won hospitalization insurance, the
same as that given to city workers.
</P>
<P>
   Venturelli succeeded Churchill as president in 1977 and served
in that post for 20 years. A striking woman with blue eyes,
perfectly coiffed hair and a collection of distinctive hats, her
powers of persuasion at City Hall and in Albany were keen, said
Louise Crane, vice president of the widows' group.
</P>
<P>
   ``She knew how to talk, she could talk to anybody,'' said Crane,
whose husband was shot six times as he chased a robbery suspect up
a Harlem fire escape in 1963.
</P>
<P>
   Venturelli is survived by her son, Alfred of Westchester County;
seven grandchildren; and two great-grandchildren.
</P>
<P>
   Venturelli visited Albany each year to fight for inflation
adjustments. Beginning in 1978, she and her allies were successful
each year.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you don't keep after something, you sometimes get
forgotten,'' Crane said. ``And another thing Helen did: she always
had them write thank-you notes.''

NEW YORK TIMES CREATES SCHOLARSHIP FUND 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The New York Times announced Friday that it had
established an endowment fund to support and supplement a college
scholarship program that it created last spring.
</P>
<P>
   The fund recently received $1 million from the Starr Foundation,
a nonprofit organization in New York City that supports educational
efforts.
</P>
<P>
   The Times announced last spring that its affiliate The New York
Times Co. Foundation would award scholarships of $12,000 a year for
four years to each of six high school seniors from New York City
who had surmounted daunting personal challenges to attain academic
excellence.
</P>
<P>
   Dozens of readers asked how they could help the winners and the
other finalists. In response, The Times set up a public fund, which
last year financed 15 additional scholarships.
</P>
<P>
   By converting the fund to an endowment, the foundation will be
able to use income from investments to pay for more scholarships.
</P>
<P>
   This month the program awarded five scholarships of $12,000 a
year, financed by the foundation, as well as a sixth, also of
$12,000, paid by a grant from the Ochs-Sulzberger family, the
controlling shareholders of the Times Co.
</P>
<P>
   Seven scholarships of $6,000 a year are being financed from
public contributions.

 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, MARCH 26)  
 (af)  
 By LAURA M. HOLSON   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   HONG KONG _ On a sultry Sunday evening earlier this month,
Taiwanese death-metal rock music echoed from a party in a hillside
apartment far above the ribbon of headlights snaking through the
skyscrapers below. The living room was emptied of all but a couch,
a table and a couple of pairs of socks balled up in the corner.
</P>
<P>
   Over the din, a dozen young Internet entrepreneurs swapped
business plans and financing tips, gushing over the millions they
hoped to make when their companies went public.
</P>
<P>
   Such soirees were unheard of a year ago, as was Matei Mihalca,
an Internet analyst from Merrill Lynch who was the host of these
festivities. His unbridled enthusiasm, and his embrace of the Net
culture, have quickly made him a favorite among Asia's new cyber
jet set. That and the fact that he can help make them all very,
very rich.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ehr-fei! You  &UR; (italics)have(end italics) &LR;  to meet these
guys!'' Mihalca shouted across the room, charging toward Ehr-fei
Liu, a Merrill technology banker, two Web design executives in tow.
``They already beat their revenue forecasts for the year. This is a
real growth story! Huge. I mean  &UR; (italics)huge!(end italics) &LR;
</P>
<P>
   This company is all about opportunity!'' Then the cell phone in
his pocket rang, and Mihalca walked away, lost in the next big
opportunity, leaving the three men behind to exchange awkward
hellos.
</P>
<P>
   Asia is sick with dot-com fever. But no one has the bug so badly
as American investment banks hoping to take Asia's new Internet
companies public. Asian economies, left for dead two years ago when
the tumbling dominoes of a currency crisis brought the region's
growth to an abrupt halt, are being reinvented overnight. Or, at
least, Asia's stock markets are.
</P>
<P>
   As many as 50 Internet concerns in countries like China, India
and Singapore are likely to go public this year alone, more than
double the number that did so last year. Fueling that boom is the
rising number of people in Asia going online, projected to more
than triple over the next four years.
</P>
<P>
   Expectations like those attract opportunists. So for investment
banks that largely missed the technology boom in the United States
over the last five years, lagging behind the powerhouses Morgan
Stanley Dean Witter and Goldman Sachs, Asia has become a place to
reinvent themselves, too.
</P>
<P>
   Merrill Lynch is among them. The technology practice of Merrill,
one of the world's biggest brokerage firms, pales when compared
with its peers over that period. Merrill ranks seventh worldwide in
the number of Internet businesses it has taken public, according to
Thomson Financial Securities Data.
</P>
<P>
   One reason is that Merrill has been slow to foster the oversized
personalities necessary these days to attract high-profile,
big-name clients. It has no technology analysts, for example, with
the renown _ and entree _ of Mary Meeker, who helped put Morgan
Stanley's practice on the map.
</P>
<P>
   But with Asia awakening to the Internet, Merrill sees the
possibility for a fresh start. ``The idea was: It's a land grab,
and we wanted to be there,'' said Adam Quinton, Merrill's former
head of Asia-Pacific research, who now helps coordinate
telecommunications research in New York.
</P>
<P>
   So last year, Merrill began the task of grooming Mihalca into an
Internet celebrity. He seems the unlikeliest of candidates _ a
30-year-old former Communist from Romania with no technology
background to speak of and little finance expertise. Even his
mother is surprised at the transformation.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is something of a paradox that somebody who was raised in a
Communist state went on to work for a Wall Street firm,'' said
Doina Bochis, who still lives in Romania. ``He was always so
literary, like me, with a very strong, developed mind.''
</P>
<P>
   But he is eager, and willing, to avail himself of a public and a
business culture chasing dot-com fantasies. Mihalca is a tireless
traveler who visits as many as 25 companies a week and often takes
the lead in wooing potential clients into Merrill's fold. If he is
successful, it will mean millions of dollars in lucrative initial
public offering fees for his firm, and a bigger salary for him.
</P>
<P>
   His hunger to put Merrill Lynch and himself on the map, though,
raises a fundamental question for investors in both Asia and the
United States who rely on analysts like him to be their trail
guides through the vast plains of the Internet's Wild Wild East:
When does boosterism end and critical analysis begin?
</P>
<P>
   Even in the United States, the line between research and
salesmanship _ that is, between the traditional roles of stock
analyst and investment banker _ has blurred. Here, it has all but
been erased.
</P>
<P>
   Mihalca has no quibble with that. ``In many places, people think
this is a conflict,'' he said. ``I see it as working together.'' If
he doesn't believe in a company, he added, he simply won't
recommend taking it public.
</P>
<P>
   Such boldness concerns those who see Asia's Internet market as
immature and driven mostly by hype.
</P>
<P>
   ``I remember reading a report from a guy talking about
philosophy and love, and that's because analysts are at a complete
loss,'' said J. Mark Mobius, who as managing director of Templeton
Asset Management has spent years searching the world for
undiscovered companies.
</P>
<P>
   It is more difficult finding sound investments in Asia, because
there is little in the way of a venture capital community to ferret
out the best ideas, he said. The danger is that untested businesses
will be sold to a ravenous public, with only investment bankers as
a buffer against speculative excess.
</P>
<P>
   It is too early to tell if Merrill's gamble on Mihalca will pay
off. So far, he has yet to make any headline-grabbing stock
predictions like those of his American colleague Henry Blodget, who
made his name more than a year ago by predicting that Amazon.com
would hit $400 a share months before it did.
</P>
<P>
   And it may not be long before Mihalca follows in the footsteps
of other Merrill up-and-comers who have left for venture firms or
dot-com companies. He has been approached by a handful of
start-ups, and rivals say privately that in the past he has talked
about making a switch.

ROTATION ALL BUT SET
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BRIAN DOHN  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   VERO BEACH, Fla. _ The Dodgers tentatively set their starting
rotation for the season.
</P>
<P>
   Kevin Brown opens in Montreal, but Darren Dreifort won't pitch
until the club begins a three-game series in New York. Chan Ho Park
is scheduled to start the April 14 home opener.
</P>
<P>
   An announcement wasn't made, but manager Davey Johnson said,
``You can see how it's set up for the rest of spring training.''
</P>
<P>
   Brown starts the April 3 opener at Montreal and is followed by
Park, who was told two weeks ago he'd start the second game in
Montreal.
</P>
<P>
   Orel Hershiser is third and, most likely, Carlos Perez, the lone
lefty in the rotation, will finish the season-opening series.
Johnson hasn't said whether Perez or Eric Gagne will grab the final
spot in the rotation, but Perez is scheduled to start again Tuesday
in Grapefruit League action while Gagne is pitching in minor-league
games.
</P>
<P>
   Also , Perez has shown improvement lately, which Johnson wanted
to see.
</P>
<P>
   Typically, Dreifort would have earned the third spot in the
rotation based on last season and a strong spring (2-1, 2.12 ERA),
but the Dodgers want to save him for the series opener in New York
on April 7 because of the better matchup.
</P>
<P>
   Dreifort has pitched well against the Mets. He was 2-0 with a
1.26 ERA against them last season and is 2-1 with a 3.00 ERA in 13
career games.
</P>
<P>
   Though the Dodgers' 10-game season-starting road trip could
allow Brown to start the home opener, an April 10 off day before a
three-game series in San Francisco prohibits it.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not going to hold my No. 1 up if there's a day off,''
Johnson said.
</P>
<P>
   And that's not to mention Hershiser and Brown pitch well against
San Francisco, which is why they figure into each spot in the
rotation. Hershiser is 22-9 with a 3.24 ERA in 44 games against the
Giants. Brown is 7-1 with a 1.20 ERA in nine games.
</P>
<P>
   Dreifort would start the middle game of the Giants' series. Park
is slated to start the home opener against Ken Griffey Jr. and the
Cincinnati Reds.
</P>
<P>
   __ Cora surprised by move: It was expected by many but not Alex
Cora. The 24-year-old, bidding to be the Dodgers' opening- day
shortstop, was optioned to Triple-A Albuquerque early Thursday,
clearing the way for Kevin Elster to be the opening-day shortstop.
</P>
<P>
   Cora, known for his defense, led the Dodgers with four errors
and hit .176 in 34 at-bats. Barring injuries, he can't be recalled
until opening day.
</P>
<P>
   ``The last few weeks I've been playing great, especially
defensively,''Cora said. ``I think I'm back. The way I played the
last few weeks, I was a little surprised. But the way it came down,
the way I look at . . . I was on a roller coaster and I need to be
more consistent.''
</P>
<P>
   Cora could be the second young player the Dodgers expected to be
on the opening day roster who now won't be.
</P>
<P>
   The Dodgers said one of the reasons they traded right-hander
Ismael Valdes in the offseason was the emergence of Gagne late last
season. He went 1-1 with a 2.10 ERA in five starts, but he's
pitched miserably this spring. His 15.63 ERA landed him a start in
today's Triple-A game against the Mets and basically secured lefty
Carlos Perez's spot in the rotation.
</P>
<P>
   And though Johnson stopped short of calling Elster his starting
shortstop, that's the organization's plan, several team officials
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``He didn't do anything to lose his job as far as I'm concerned,
and he played rather brilliantly at times,'' Johnson said of Cora.
``But with the emergence of Elster and (Jose) Vizcaino, I thought
it best we don't put Alex in a part-time situation at short.''
</P>
<P>
   __ Odds and ends: Outfielder Tony Mota, son of longtime Dodgers
player and coach Manny Mota, was optioned to Triple-A Albuquerque.
. . . Shawn Green went 1 for 3 and is hitting .458 during an
eight-game hitting streak.

 HONG KONG: a switch.  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Opportunism, after all, is not just for institutions. ``Now that
there is attention being paid to this one sector, there is a
pedestal to step on,'' said Jay Chang, who competes with Mihalca as
an Internet analyst at Credit Suisse First Boston in Hong Kong.
``So, why not?''
</P>
<P>
   It was 1:15 p.m. on March 8, a Wednesday, and the last day of a
technology conference Merrill had put on for Asian investors.
Mihalca was nowhere to be found. A dozen or so journalists were
milling around the ballroom lobby of the Island Shangri-La Hotel,
eagerly awaiting his arrival at a news conference. Mihalca,
nicknamed ``the mad scientist of Internet analysts'' by colleagues
because of his quirky ideas, was found napping on a couch. The
reason? He had spent all night writing a research report on an
Internet portal company that Merrill was hoping to take public.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is an experiment in selling,'' Mihalca said of the report
after he showed up in the lobby, quaffing a cup of coffee as he
rubbed sleep from his bloodshot eyes.
</P>
<P>
   For an analyst, Mihalca talks a lot about selling: selling
stocks to investors, selling companies on Merrill, selling himself
to all of them. In February 1999, just when the cyberworld in Asia
was beginning to take off, Merrill needed a bold and articulate
spokesman to better its image among journalists and potential
clients.
</P>
<P>
   ``The objective I gave him was to raise his profile in the
corporate world as quickly as possible,'' Quinton said. ``If
someone wanted to interview someone who was knowledgeable, he would
be the person the media turned to.''
</P>
<P>
   Never mind that his relevant experience was limited. He was a
fluent Mandarin speaker and well-versed in Asian culture and
politics, a necessity in countries where government and business
are so closely intertwined. And he showed an early affinity for
writing; his father was a journalist in Romania.
</P>
<P>
   After a brief stint at the United States Chamber of Commerce in
Taiwan, Mihalca was hired by Merrill in 1997 as an analyst. He was
not a natural fit at first, so was hired on a temporary basis,
Merrill executives said. But he showed promise, particularly as a
skilled networker.
</P>
<P>
   ``He seemed to know more people in Taiwan in one year than I did
in 10,'' said Peter Kurz, the director at Merrill in Taiwan who
hired him. ``He is disarmingly honest, and people trust him for
that reason.'' After first covering the semiconductor industry, he
was appointed head of Asia-Pacific Internet research last year.
</P>
<P>
   Soon after that, Merrill began its Mihalca campaign. He was
introduced to reporters at major media outlets, some of whom he
knew already from his stint freelancing for The Asian Wall Street
Journal. Merrill took out newspaper advertisements touting his
research and included his e-mail address. He made himself a regular
visitor to the CNBC studios on the 25th floor of the Asia Pacific
Finance Tower in central Hong Kong, eight floors above his own
humble cubicle.
</P>
<P>
   ``I promote myself,'' he said unabashedly in a recent interview.
Last month, he moderated an hourlong panel on CNBC Asia about the
Internet there. That was a result of an elevator conversation with
a ``Squawk Box'' anchor, Bernard Lo.
</P>
<P>
   And he always returns reporters' calls. When America Online and
Time Warner announced plans to merge in January, for instance, he
was disturbed at midnight by a reporter seeking comment.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was happy about that,'' Mihalca said. ``You have to put
yourself in the customer's shoes.''
</P>
<P>
   But who, in fact, are Mihalca's customers? Some may still think
that analysts are the eyes and ears of investors, or at least their
brokers. But in truth, analysts like Mihalca labor to suit the
companies their bankers court.
</P>
<P>
   Thomas Rosenthal, a fan and president of MeetChina.com, a
business-to-business Web site in China, said of Mihalca: ``I see
him as a salesman. He is out there getting the business.'' Mihalca
recently offered to broker an introduction between MeetChina
executives and a potential partner interested in setting up a joint
venture. He is also a trusted confidant; after an investor meeting,
Mihalca said he gently suggested that a MeetChina executive refrain
from talking about his colleagues' wives.
</P>
<P>
   Mihalca connects with young entrepreneurs in tradition-bound
Asia because he, like many of them, is an outsider. On a recent
Sunday morning, Mihalca, along with his Taiwanese wife, Ching-Fang
Hu, and Rajesh Jain, an Indian entrepreneur who recently sold his
Internet company for $115 million, took the ferry from Hong Kong
island to Kowloon for breakfast. The two men had met only once last
October, but they greeted each other with smiles and a hearty bear
hug.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I first met Matei, we talked for three hours at a Bombay
hotel,'' Jain said over a breakfast of Egg McMuffins (a favorite of
Mihalca's) and coffee. ``I met someone who was as excited as I was
and really understood what I wanted to do.''
</P>
<P>
   Such exuberance is rare on Wall Street. One colleague teased
that David Komansky, Merrill's chief executive, would grow pale if
he knew about the all-nighters Mihalca spent at the office. Mihalca
waves goodbye with two hands, and the floor shakes under his gait
as he runs down the hall.
</P>
<P>
   ``Personally, I think there is something neurologically wrong
with him,'' joked Duncan Wooldridge, a Merrill senior economist in
Hong Kong. ``One of the great things is that his excitement and
enthusiasm are contagious. He likes to talk about ideas. If you
don't have free time, don't go by his desk.''
</P>
<P>
   But can Mihalca adapt his style to more traditional clients,
particularly as the Internet sector matures? His discomfort with
established society became apparent hours after his meeting with
Jain. Mihalca and his wife were invited to the exclusive Hong Kong
Jockey Club for a private party held by Champion Technology, a
multibillion-dollar communications concern. It was Derby Day, the
equivalent of the Kentucky Derby in the United States. Clearly
Mihalca was not on familiar terrain.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nice carpet,'' he said sarcastically, pointing to the burst of
purple and orange on one of the floors. The guest list was a who's
who of Hong Kong's diplomatic corps and business society. They had
arrived in private cars, while Mihalca took a cab because he missed
the train. His khakis and tweed jacket looked pedestrian compared
with other guests' tailored suits and dresses. And while Champion's
chairman, Paul Kan, held court with older, more polished investment
bankers, Mihalca was briefly introduced when he arrived.
</P>
<P>
   To him, the business culture of the jockey club's patrons was a
curiosity to be studied and understood. Theirs is a social
structure being displaced by newer entrants. And to comprehend
where society was going, one had to understand from where it had
come.

 HONG KONG: had come.  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``Sure, I felt more comfortable this morning with Rajesh,'' he
said later, during the cab ride home. ``But you have to understand
this world, too. You can't turn your back on them just because it
is not comfortable.''
</P>
<P>
   Mihalca was born on April 5, 1969, an only child, and lived in
the small Romanian mountain town of Baia Sprie, 100 miles from
Bucharest. Food was scarce under the tyranny of Nicolae Ceausescu,
and the lights in young Matei's house ran on a car battery.
</P>
<P>
   He remembers his mother, a hospital psychiatrist, treating
``depressed people who swallowed detergent and stuff.'' (His
stepfather, Mircea Bochis, an artist, married his mother 24 years
ago.)
</P>
<P>
   ``I am a lone cowboy,'' Mihalca said. And at times that has cost
him.
</P>
<P>
   ``He had problems in school because he spoke against the
system,'' his mother recalled. ``He presented himself openly as an
anti-Communist. I always said, `Shut up! Be quiet!'''
</P>
<P>
   Despite his views, Mihalca joined the Communist Party in 1988.
If he hadn't, he said, he might have missed the opportunity that
has defined his career: a chance to study Chinese in Beijing in
1989, as one of a handful of students plucked from the University
of Bucharest for a summer exchange program.
</P>
<P>
   Turmoil seems to chase him, or he, it. Then just 20, he arrived
at the Beijing Language Institute on June 7, days after the
massacre at Tiananmen Square. Armored vehicles rolled past his
dormitory-room window. Many foreign students had returned to their
embassies, and as their mail piled up in the dorm lobby, he spent
his summer skipping classes, reading Western magazines and learning
to ride a bicycle.
</P>
<P>
   Six months later, back in Baie Sprie, he and his family huddled
around a television set and watched the Ceaucescu government
crumble.
</P>
<P>
   Mihalca returned to Beijing and was later accepted into a
doctoral program at Harvard University to study history and East
Asian languages. He spent five years there but never finished his
dissertation. In Cambridge, too, he had a difficult time getting
along. Nikolas Gloy, a Harvard friend and next-door neighbor, said
Mihalca openly criticized the research of fellow students and
corrected the grammar of native Chinese speakers.
</P>
<P>
   When pressed to reflect, Mihalca acknowledges that those were
not happy days. ``Being a Romanian guy studying Chinese in America
did not work that well,'' he said. He paused for a moment, deep in
thought, the memory seemingly raw. ``In a way I am like my father,
somewhat cold. I do not feel the need to be sentimental about my
past.''
</P>
<P>
   If anyone best understands Mihalca, it is probably his wife, Hu.
The two met in Taipei in 1997, where she was editor in chief of
Playboy Taiwan, for which she now consults.
</P>
<P>
   Having a dialogue with society is important to her husband, she
said. And at Merrill Lynch, he gets the attention he craves. ``He
has a childish side _ like a baby, naughty,'' she said. ``He needs
a lot of love. He is like a complicated child who is always
thinking, and it is hard to get to the heart of where his mind
is.''
</P>
<P>
   It is still early in the race to take Asia's Internet industries
public. Among investment banks, Lehman Brothers, an also-ran in the
United States, has captured much of the attention here so far with
two high-profile offerings last year. One was for Chinadotcom, the
other for Pacific Internet.
</P>
<P>
   Ravi Sarathy, Lehman's chief Internet analyst and an early
dot-com celebrity in Asia, played a key role in attracting that
business.
</P>
<P>
   Like many other Wall Streeters, he has since departed to create
his own online start-up. But he remains a consultant to Lehman
clients.
</P>
<P>
   Other aspects of the banking business here are as peculiar. Some
analysts are also entrepreneurs. Eric Gan, who works for Goldman
Sachs Japan, is also co-founder of eAccess Ltd., an Internet
service provider in which Goldman has invested, said a spokeswoman
for the firm.
</P>
<P>
   As long as Internet stocks keep going up, there seem to be few
complaints about such arrangements. The real test will come when
companies begin to stumble. Then, the true Internet stars will
shine, the analysts and bankers who can separate the novas from the
black holes.
</P>
<P>
   Clients and investors say Mihalca's strength is understanding a
concept _ and, even better, marketing it. But as the investing
world comes to focus more on revenue and profits, the ability to
sell a story will hold less appeal. Then the plodding, less
glamorous, but more incisive analysis will prevail.
</P>
<P>
   That may prove uncomfortable to Mihalca and others like him who
are making young Asian entrepreneurs rich today, but will be
duty-bound to chastise them if they fail to execute.
</P>
<P>
   ``If it were to happen, it would be a personal disappointment,''
Mihalca said. ``You invest a lot of time and energy and personal
commitment.'' But by then, he added, he may have a large-enough
staff to help him work through the numbers. ``How I delegate the
nitty-gritty to our team members,'' he said, ``is something I will
have to learn.''
</P>
<P>
   He is acutely aware that if Asia's Internet companies fail to
deliver, his 15 minutes in the spotlight are up. But in this
market, where everything is a ``buy,'' he does not seem to worry.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you pick companies that go up in flames, well, it is
everyone who goes up in flames,'' he said. ``Then it is not about
you anymore. The story is fairly sound. If the Internet as a whole
doesn't work out, it is not my problem.''

 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, MARCH 26)  
 (af)  
 By JOHN MARKOFF   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   PALO ALTO, Calif. _ In June 1975, a solitary computer hacker
slipped quietly into a van in the parking lot of a local hotel,
Rickey's Hyatt House, and ``borrowed'' a copy of Microsoft BASIC,
the first commercial program from a tiny Albuquerque, N.M., company
started by two other young hackers, William H. Gates and Paul G.
Allen.
</P>
<P>
   The van was on a nationwide tour to show off the MITS Altair
8800, one of the world's first personal computers. The program _
stored as a set of punched holes in a long paper tape _ was
``liberated'' to be shared by a rag-tag group of Silicon Valley
computer hobbyists who had banded together only four months earlier
as the Homebrew Computer Club.
</P>
<P>
   The tape was handed to Dan Sokol, then 31, a semiconductor
engineering manager who did what he thought was right.
</P>
<P>
   ``I made convenient copies for the members of the Homebrew Club,
because I was the only one who had easy access to a paper tape
reader,'' Sokol recalled recently.
</P>
<P>
   The act outraged Gates, of the company then spelled as
Micro-Soft, who saw nothing but outright theft in the stunt. He
wrote an angry letter to the computer hobbyists. ``As the majority
of hobbyists must be aware, most of you steal your software,'' the
letter said. ``Hardware must be paid for, but software is something
to share. Who cares if the people who worked on it get paid?''
</P>
<P>
   This initial confrontation between Gates, then 20, who was to
become the most powerful figure in the computer industry and the
world's richest man, and an anarchic cadre of programmers and
hardware tinkerers was the forge of a basic tension that is still
shaping the computer industry.
</P>
<P>
   The emergence of the PC as the ubiquitous tool of the
information age had its roots in the Homebrew Club. A central value
of its founders _ the free sharing of information _ has until
recently been submerged in the Silicon Valley gold rush.
</P>
<P>
   But today, the argument has returned as a battle cry in a range
of confrontations, from the challenge of the free Linux operating
system to the patent protection and copyright issues facing the
music industry and other businesses.
</P>
<P>
   On one hand, the valley has long been motivated by what the
author Michael S. Malone called ``The Big Score'' _ or more simply
put, greed. Indeed, it was not long after the Homebrew Club's first
meeting in Menlo Park that it began spawning companies _ with names
like Apple, Osborne, Cromemco and Northstar _ owing their roots,
directly or indirectly, to the enthusiasm that was captured in the
initial club meetings.
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, the valley also continues to be driven by a
more ethereal and in many ways purer motive _ what the author has
called ``the hacker ethic,'' a reference to the values of
passionate programmers (and not, in the more modern definition of
``hacker,'' to an outlaw subculture).
</P>
<P>
   The ethos, which finds its clearest expression today in Linux
software and in the commitment of the so-called open source
movement to the shared ownership and development of computing
tools.
</P>
<P>
   Linux, which now has about a 25 percent share of the computer
server market and the backing of big companies like IBM, is a
freely available operating system that has been developed and
supported by volunteer programmers.
</P>
<P>
   The PC industry ``began with people who had a passion for
computers,'' said Paul Freiberger, co-author of ``Fire in the
Valley: The Making of the Personal Computer'' (McGraw Hill, 1999)
``They were followed by people who had a passion for money. It's
the mixture of those passions that defines Silicon Valley.''
</P>
<P>
   On a rainy night 25 years ago, it was the original hacker spirit
that captivated a small group of young men who were drawn early on
to the potential of powerful personal computers. One of them, a
Hewlett-Packard technician named Stephen Wozniak, has long
maintained that he had no intention of creating a company when he
built his first computer, but that he rather was intent on building
a machine he could show off to the members of the Homebrew Club.
</P>
<P>
   By happenstance, Sokol sat next to Wozniak at an early club
meeting. ``He bemoaned the fact that he couldn't get any parts to
make his computer from H-P,'' Sokol remembered. ``So I told him to
come by my company and I found a shoe box full of parts that became
the components used in the first Apple I computer.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   There was no initial-public-offering gleam in either man's eye.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were interested in playing with toys,'' Sokol said.
``People looked at our hand-wired computers and laughed at us and
asked, `What are you going to do with it?'''
</P>
<P>
   Thirty-two people showed up at the first meeting after a peace
activist named Frederick Moore Jr. rode his bicycle around Palo
Alto and Menlo Park, tacking up small 3-by-5-inch notices on
bulletin boards and telephone poles.
</P>
<P>
   ``I slipped Fred $5 and he went to the copy store and printed up
a bunch of fliers,'' recalled Gordon French, an engineer who along
with Moore is considered a co-founder of the group and who held the
first club meetings in his Palo Alto garage.
</P>
<P>
   The tiny flier read in part: ``Are you building your own
computer? Terminal? TV Typewriter? I/O device? or some other
digital black magic box? Or are you buying time on a time-sharing
service? If so, you might like to come to a gather of people with
like-minded interests. Exchange information, swap ideas, help work
on a project, whatever ...''
</P>
<P>
   One person who saw the flier on a telephone pole was Alan Baum,
who became an early employee of Apple Computer. He called his
friend Wozniak, and the two agreed to attend.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, Wozniak had already heard about the meeting from
another friend, John Draper, even then a legendary figure in the
Bay Area. Draper had been nicknamed ``Cap'n Crunch'' after he
discovered that the whistle prize in the cereal box would unlock
the AT&AMP;T long-distance system by generating a specific tone; he was
considered a pioneer ``phone phreak,'' part of a subculture of
hobbyists who explored the inner workings of the telephone network
in the 1960s and '70s.
</P>
<P>
   Wozniak and his friend Steven P. Jobs had met Draper several
years earlier, in Wozniak's dormitory room at the University of
California at Berkeley. From him, they learned about devices called
blue boxes that could be used to gain free telephone calls.
</P>
<P>
   Briefly, Wozniak and Jobs sold blue boxes. But after Jobs
realized from the Homebrew Club meetings that there might be an
enthusiastic market for PCs, the two men founded Apple Computer.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   By the third meeting, the Homebrew Club was bursting at the
seams and had outgrown French's garage. It ultimately settled for
many years at the Stanford Linear Accelerator auditorium, where as
many as 750 computer enthusiasts would gather twice a month.
</P>
<P>
   Neither graphics nor sound were common computer features in
those days, so when a hobbyist, Steve Dompier, demonstrated at the
fourth meeting that he had laboriously programmed his new MITS
Altair computer kit to play the Beatles' ``Fool on the Hill,'' the
assembly gave him a wild standing ovation.
</P>
<P>
   A typical Homebrew meeting began with a ``mapping'' session. The
moderator _ for many years Lee Felsenstein, a political activist
turned computer hardware engineer _ would point to people around
the room, and each would describe what they were working on. A
formal presentation would follow. The meeting would conclude with a
``random access'' session in which people with similar interests
would cluster to share information.
</P>
<P>
   It was at one such meeting, in the fall of 1981, that the
transition from the hobbyist era of computing to today's booming
world of corporate computing took place _ though virtually no one
in attendance realized the shift.
</P>
<P>
   Felsenstein pried open the case of the first IBM PC, examined
its motherboard and pointed with glee to three ``blue lines'' _
wires that were evidence, he proclaimed, of a hastily
patched-together computer that had been rushed to market. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   It was a sweet _ if momentary _ vindication for the assembly
that blended several hundred computer hackers with the vibrant
counterculture and antiwar movement that had come to define the San
Francisco Bay Area in the 1960s and '70s.
</P>
<P>
   IBM, of course, overcame whatever early assembly problems it
faced, and the broad sale of its PCs gave rise to an industrial
explosion unmatched in American history.
</P>
<P>
   The club also represented the birth of the software industry.
Until the rise of the PC, software had been largely developed in
the image of the Homebrew Club _ as a freely shared resource used
to breathe life into computer hardware. Now it was being converted
into a powerful economic force that would swiftly transform
society. And Gates' software, in particular _ the operating system
of IBM's machine _ secured a controlling position that it still has
not relinquished.
</P>
<P>
   So even today, an uneasy tension remains between the
get-rich-on-Internet-time fever that has swept the valley and the
original hacker ethic.
</P>
<P>
   ``Information wants to be free,'' said Stewart Brand, the author
and social commentator who coined the term ``personal computer'' in
1973, ``and information also wants to be very expensive.''
</P>
<P>
   Many of the new Linux start-ups _ companies like Red Hat and
Corel _ are grappling with precisely that paradox by creating
businesses in which new software is shared and free, while service
and support are for sale.
</P>
<P>
   Sokol's career has mirrored the same tension. Shortly after the
birth of Homebrew, he decided that it was time to get out of the
semiconductor industry, which was then under assault from foreign
competition.
</P>
<P>
   ``I could read the handwriting on the wall,'' he said. ``I
couldn't tell what it said, but I could see it was written in
Japanese.''
</P>
<P>
   Although Sokol kept his passion for computers and continued to
tinker with them, he left the industry and worked in the video
business in Texas for a number of years. But he remained a close
friend of Wozniak _ the two men have always found time to explore
with the latest computer technologies _ and in 1987 he was lured
back to the valley as a software consultant.
</P>
<P>
   Seated in his office recently in San Francisco's South of Market
district, surrounded by three computer screens and three Macintosh
computers, Sokol was the very image of the computer hacker, bearded
and wearing a Hawaiian print shirt, baggy army pants and running
shoes.
</P>
<P>
   But that also made him all but indistinguishable from most any
Silicon Valley chief technology officer who had just closed the $9
million second round of financing for his start-up.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, with his partner Kirk Knight, Sokol has had a string of
start-up ventures over the last decade _ a company to create
interactive movies, for example, and a Web infrastructure company
with technology to speed up the Internet. Neither was a success. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Their latest venture may have a much better chance of taking
off. Called Cobaltcard, the company is marketing an Internet debit
card for teenagers; it has solid financial backing and an
association with Visa, the credit card association.
</P>
<P>
   If it succeeds, it will be because Sokol has managed to straddle
the contradictions between the world of the hacker and that of the
entrepreneur.
</P>
<P>
   As in the Homebrew Club's early days, it remains an uneasy
balancing act. Twenty-five years after Gates's broadside, Sokol is
still righteous about those days of software anarchy.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bill Gates owes his fortune to us,'' he said. ``If we hadn't
copied the tape there would never have been an explosion of people
using his software.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   MENLO PARK, Calif. _ The founders of the Homebrew Computer Club
could not have made an odder couple.
</P>
<P>
   Gordon French had been a weapons designer who helped build
missile guidance systems; Frederick Moore Jr. was a long-haired,
bearded peace activist who was running a community information
network that he maintained from index cards in a shoe box at his
funky office in the Whole Earth Truck Store, a back-to-the-land
venture.
</P>
<P>
   Moore was involved in the club for just its first year _ as
secretary, treasurer and newsletter editor. But two and a half
decades later, his original communitarian vision of the power of
personal computers has re-emerged to challenge the computer
industry's status quo, in the form of the free software movement.
</P>
<P>
   Moore saw computers as a way to help pull the world together. In
the Homebrew Club, he saw the potential for using personal
computers in political organizing.
</P>
<P>
   Both truisms now, these were lonely views at the time.
Thoreau-like in his personal morality, Moore often found himself
out of step with his fellow hobbyists.
</P>
<P>
   ``He would suggest cake sales to raise funds for the group, or
publish cute little poems in the newsletter,'' Steven Levy wrote in
``Hackers: Heroes of the Computer Revolution,'' (Doubleday, 1984)
``Meanwhile, most of the club members would be turning to the back
of the newsletter to study the schematics in the contribution
called `Arbitrary Logic Function Generation Via Digital
Multiplexers.' That was the way to change the world, and a lot more
fun than a cake sale.''
</P>
<P>
   The Homebrew Club quickly became the hot spot for an industrial
revolution, and Moore soon dropped out, returning to his life as a
political organizer.
</P>
<P>
   His roots there were deep. He briefly became a national figure
in the fall of 1959, a result of an individual act of conscience
that in many ways was the opening act of the American student
movement of the 1960s.
</P>
<P>
   Early in the morning of Oct. 17, 1959, as a freshman at the
University of California at Berkeley, he sat down on the steps in
front of Sproul Hall, the campus administration building, and
announced that he was beginning a seven-day fast against the
university's ROTC program, then compulsory.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, his hunger strike lasted only two days. His father, an
Air Force colonel stationed in Colorado, arrived on campus at the
request of the university administration, and Moore withdrew from
school.
</P>
<P>
   The act of conscience had not failed, however. His solitary
protest had a profound impact on the school, which was then still
the embodiment of the ``silent generation'' of the 1950s. ``If you
want to speak about courage, speak about Fred Moore. He stood
alone,'' wrote David Horowitz in ``Student: The Political
Activities of the Berkeley Students'' (Ballantine, 1962). Horowitz
was among those at Berkeley who were moved by the protest; he would
become a student leader during the 1960s.
</P>
<P>
   For the rest of his life, Moore remained a committed pacifist.
He became a ``long walker,'' wandering across the country several
times as a peace activist. He remained an inveterate inventor and
something of a hacker, too: he found big computers at the Stanford
University medical center and he would often spend long hours there
teaching himself to program.
</P>
<P>
   A planned round-the-world peace walk led him, at the age of 50,
from the Pacific coast of Canada down to San Francisco. Along the
way, he came up with the idea of a ``Redwood Summer'' of
environmental protests against Pacific Lumber's logging of redwood
forests on the California coast.
</P>
<P>
   Moore died in 1997 after a traffic accident in eastern Arizona.
He was 57. He had had a seminal impact on both the antiwar movement
and the personal computer industry, but none of the three major Bay
Area newspapers published an obituary to mark his passing.

EDITORIAL: RENDEZVOUS WITH ASSAD

<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial for Saturday, March 25:
</P>
<P>
   Syria's aging and autocratic president, Hafez Assad, does not
travel abroad very often. His willingness to meet with President
Clinton in Geneva on Sunday is a sign that he may be ready to
return to peace talks with Israel.
</P>
<P>
   The Geneva meeting comes just four months before Israeli troops
are scheduled to withdraw from Lebanon. It will be much better for
all concerned if Israel and Syria can negotiate a peace agreement
before then. The two countries are already fairly close to a deal.
But the few issues that still separate them have proved difficult.
Clinton is right to try to narrow the differences so that direct
talks between Israel and Syria can resume within the next few
weeks.
</P>
<P>
   Since the last round of talks, at Shepherdstown, W.Va., broke
off in January, U.S. diplomacy has closed the gap between the two
sides. Prime Minister Ehud Barak of Israel has signaled that he
would be prepared to restore Syrian sovereignty to all of the
occupied Golan Heights if there are acceptable security
arrangements. Still to be settled is whether that would entail a
Syrian presence on the shore of the Sea of Galilee, Israel's
largest source of water.
</P>
<P>
   Syria, meanwhile, seems willing to accept the idea of an
international military monitoring station inside the Golan, atop
Mount Hermon. But it resists allowing Israeli participation.
Potential compromises may be possible. For example, Israel is
willing to swap valuable land adjacent to the Golan for control of
the Galilee shoreline and water rights.
</P>
<P>
   But if no deal with Syria is reached before Israel withdraws
from Lebanon, compromise could prove harder. With the unpopular
Lebanon occupation no longer a factor in Israeli politics, Barak
will have less incentive to compromise over Golan issues. If
Damascus tried to offset this by permitting Lebanese guerrillas to
shell northern Israeli villages, the result could be renewed
warfare in Lebanon and the total breakdown of peace talks between
Israel and Syria.
</P>
<P>
   Ultimately, Israel and Syria must work out their own solutions
to the questions dividing them. But the United States can help.
Wisely, the Clinton administration kept diplomatic channels open to
Damascus throughout the 1990s, even when prospects for peace looked
exceedingly bleak. That has earned Washington a degree of trust
from Assad and the authority to ask him to negotiate realistically
on border and security issues.
</P>
<P>
   In particular, Clinton should stress that Barak's desire for
peace is genuine and that with the Lebanon withdrawal approaching
and the administration's own time in office running out, the time
for Assad to make a deal is now.

EDITORIAL OBSERVER: THE MAYOR CAN DEFUSE THE DORISMOND CASE 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By BRENT STAPLES   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   New Yorkers are especially sensitive to racial tensions and have
historically placed great emphasis on how politicians deal with
issues of race.
</P>
<P>
   In the 1960s, for example, Mayor John Lindsay was hailed as a
civic hero for walking the streets of black neighborhoods to head
off urban unrest. In more recent years two mayors, Edward Koch and
David Dinkins, were sent packing from City Hall at least partly
because of public disappointment over how they handled racial
conflicts.
</P>
<P>
   Term-limit laws have already put an expiration date on Rudolph
Giuliani's service as mayor. But Giuliani's oral attacks this week
on an unarmed black man who was killed by the police may yet harm
his chances of winning a Senate seat _ and have created a racial
issue every bit as serious as those that dogged his predecessors.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, Giuliani's strained relationship with black New
Yorkers _ and the scanty representation of African-Americans in the
upper levels of his administration _ makes the current controversy
all the more difficult to defuse. Given the situation, Giuliani
would be wise to admit error in his handling of the Patrick
Dorismond case and apologize _ both to the dead man's family and to
the voters as a whole.
</P>
<P>
   The death of Dorismond last week marks the fourth time in little
more than a year that the police have killed an unarmed black man
on the street. This case was egregious, given that Dorismond had
broken no law and was minding his own business until an undercover
officer approached him seeking to buy drugs.
</P>
<P>
   The proper thing for the mayor to do was express sympathy for
the dead man's family and, at all costs, refrain from divisive
rhetoric. Instead Giuliani labeled Dorismond a violent man who was
less than ``an altar boy'' and whose behavior pattern as a
teen-ager may have contributed to his death. The administration
angered many New Yorkers by releasing parts of a sealed record
showing that Dorismond had been convicted of disorderly conduct
when a juvenile.
</P>
<P>
   New York's racial tensions, of course, did not begin with
Giuliani. Koch generated more than his share in the late 1980s,
when he embarked on a strenuous campaign against the Rev. Jesse
Jackson in the Democratic primary, then made a series of tactical
missteps following the death of Yusuf Hawkins, a 16-year-old
African-American who was set upon by a crowd of whites in the
Bensonhurst section of Brooklyn.
</P>
<P>
   Koch's abrasive style was wearing on voters anyway, but he was
mainly driven from office by the sense in the electorate that he
was making race relations in the city markedly worse. Voters hoped
that David Dinkins would succeed where Koch had failed. But Dinkins
met a racial debacle of his own when he failed to deal competently
with the Crown Heights riot. The riot crystallized the city's worst
fears about racial friction and paved Giuliani's way to City Hall.
</P>
<P>
   Giuliani arrived in office with almost no black support, and has
kept black New Yorkers at a distance ever since. He ignored a plea
by former Schools Chancellor Rudy Crew to meet with black citizens
about their concerns, simply to hear them out.
</P>
<P>
   The stonewalling extended even to the city's highest-ranking
black elected official, Virginia Fields, the Manhattan borough
president. She says the mayor declined to meet with her at all
until the demonstrations that followed the death of Amadou Diallo,
an unarmed black man who was shot by the police in the Bronx 13
months ago.
</P>
<P>
   Which brings us back to the Dorismond case. The outrage over
Giuliani's smearing of the dead man began in the black community
but has quickly spread, reaching Democrats and Republicans all over
the state.
</P>
<P>
   As one Republican strategist told The Times' Elisabeth Bumiller,
Giuliani is coming close to crossing a line he ought not to cross.
Another GOP strategist, Nelson Warfield, said Giuliani ``is kind of
playing to his two worst qualities: No. 1, he's being divisive, and
No. 2, he's refusing to admit that he's made a mistake.''
</P>
<P>
   Giuliani can allay doubts about his leadership by admitting that
defaming the dead man _ and failing to express sympathy to the
Dorismond family _ was a mistake. Such an apology would show
minority voters that the mayor is not completely insensitive to
their fears _ and would remove this issue from the Senate campaign,
where Hillary Rodham Clinton is trying to use it against him.
</P>
<P>
   More important, an apology would disarm the many demagogues who
will surely exploit this matter in the long, hot months to come.

EDITORIAL: TRADING STOCK FOR THE BEST PRICE 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial on Saturday, March 25:
</P>
<P>
   A technological revolution is shaking up Wall Street, and
federal regulators are scrambling to keep up. The explosive growth
of electronic brokers is bringing investors lightning-quick,
low-cost execution of trades. But with the benefits of this new
form of competition come threats that some investors may not get
the best price for their stock.
</P>
<P>
   The Securities and Exchange Commission worries that the pillars
of American stock trading, the New York Stock Exchange and Nasdaq,
are moving sluggishly to meet the challenge posed by the growth of
electronic communications networks. These electronic brokers use
sophisticated software programs that match buyers and sellers. By
contrast, the floor exchanges and Nasdaq rely on slower, costlier
human intermediaries to complete many trades.
</P>
<P>
   Electronic brokers can match buyers and sellers perfectly well
when there are lots of buyers and sellers hovering around. But for
stocks that are only infrequently traded, human intermediaries
serve the valuable function of smoothing what would otherwise be
erratic swings in price, for example by purchasing shares during
periods when buyers are nowhere in sight.
</P>
<P>
   Intermediaries provide something else that electronic brokers
cannot: price improvement. Specialists on the floor exchange, after
analyzing their roster of offers to buy and sell at specified
future prices, often offer customers prices better than those that
were posted at the time their orders arrived. Electronic brokers
merely search for the best current price.
</P>
<P>
   With the growth of trading on several electronic networks comes
fragmentation, or splitting of trades among different exchanges,
dealers and electronic networks.
</P>
<P>
   The upside of fragmentation is that investors get more choices
of where to trade stocks. The downside is that some markets will
offer better prices than others in ways that will not be clear to
individual investors. Current rules require brokers to provide
customers the best price available anywhere. But the rule is often
violated.
</P>
<P>
   A troubling example of fragmentation comes from dealers who
match buy and sell orders from their own customers without
directing them to floor exchanges, Nasdaq or anywhere else. They
probably represent a bigger threat to the floor exchanges than do
electronic brokers. The question lingers how well these dealers are
serving their customers.
</P>
<P>
   To address some of these problems the SEC chairman, Arthur
Levitt Jr., has proposed that traders disclose customer offers to
buy and sell stocks on a central electronic display for everyone to
inspect simultaneously. He also called for electronic linkages so
traders can send orders wherever the price is best _ to floor
exchanges, Nasdaq or electronic networks. Both recommendations
should be adopted.
</P>
<P>
   But another idea, designed to encourage brokers to be aggressive
in offering customers better prices, should be embraced more
cautiously. Under current rules, if a specialist on the floor of
the stock exchange offers to pay $20 for a stock, up from $19, in
hopes of attracting trades, other dealers can hold their own
customers merely by matching the new $20 offer. That squashes the
incentive to make aggressive bids.
</P>
<P>
   To attack this problem, the commission has issued for comment a
controversial plan that would require that trades go to the broker
who first posts the best price. This time-based rule would reward
aggressive offers.
</P>
<P>
   Big brokerage houses like the idea. But the New York Stock
Exchange fears that a time-based rule could destroy the way the
specialists and brokers interact on the floor of stock exchanges,
undermining the most competitive arena of stock trading. That is
why Levitt started with the easier calls _ electronic display and
links _ and proceeds cautiously before rewriting rules that dictate
where trades take place.

KNICKS HEAT UP AND THEN HOLD ON 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By SELENA ROBERTS   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Once Latrell Sprewell ducked out of the locker room
after halftime to offer a visual on assertiveness Friday night, the
New York Knicks perked up just long enough to tuck away a
crestfallen Atlanta Hawks team that was auditioning its young
talent for next season.
</P>
<P>
   Although the Hawks' best player, Dikembe Mutombo, only played in
the first and third quarters, the Knicks still had hiccups on their
way to a 95-83 victory Friday night at Madison Square Garden.
</P>
<P>
   This was not exactly the send-off of the Knicks' dreams, not
when their sloppiness enabled the Hawks to cut a fourth-quarter
16-point lead to eight, but the Knicks managed to set themselves up
for their five-game West Coast trip with a needed victory.
</P>
<P>
   By scoring 15 of his 30 points in the third quarter, by giving
his languid team a boost with defensive energy, Sprewell made sure
the Knicks (42-26) would not slip against an easy opponent.
</P>
<P>
   After the Hawks cut the Knicks' lead to eight with four minutes
remaining, Sprewell came up with a three-pointer and a steal that
led to another basket to provide his team with breathing room.
Allan Houston ended the game with 27 points, while Patrick Ewing
ended with eight points in 34 minutes against Mutombo (three
points, 24 minutes).
</P>
<P>
   The Hawks arrived as a team that in no way resembled the one
that faced the Knicks in the playoffs last season. On their way to
the worst season since the 1970-1971 team, the Hawks have been a
dysfunctional mess, punctuated on March 17, when the organization
severed ties with Isaiah Rider.
</P>
<P>
   He was the very player they believed could give them a lift
against the Knicks, but the erratic Rider delivered only headaches.
</P>
<P>
   Only on occasion have the Hawks taken a break from their
troubles and found success. Twice the Knicks have provided relief
for them. In their two previous meetings, both in Atlanta, the
Hawks leaned on Mutombo's sharpened elbow to intimidate the Knicks.
</P>
<P>
   Circling Ewing, Mutombo averaged 15 points and 22 rebounds in
those two games. With his ominous positioning in the paint, Mutombo
turned the Knicks into jump-shooters who were too timid to confront
him with a driving layup.
</P>
<P>
   For that reason, coach Jeff Van Gundy wanted his team focused on
being the aggressor Friday night. Not only as a way to grab the
victory but also to set them up mentally for their West Coast road
trip, which will begin in Portland, Ore., on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you're 0-2 against a team like we are against Atlanta,
and you have problems historically against teams that rebound and
have size in the paint like Atlanta does, you don't think about the
trip,'' Van Gundy said before the game. ``But also, if you do think
about it, you get depressed. It's going to be quite a challenge. As
I told our team today, our West Coast trip starts now.''
</P>
<P>
   This was not the start he imagined Friday night. Although the
Knicks began the game driving inside to test Mutombo, they shook at
the sight of him, changed their shots and missed a stream of
layups. On the other end, the Hawks were driving inside on Ewing
and then Camby for uncontested layups and popping open jumpers over
the loose coverage of Houston and Sprewell.
</P>
<P>
   This slack mentality by the Knicks extended into their ball
handling as well. After consecutive turnovers by Houston and Kurt
Thomas, the Hawks stopped trading baskets with the Knicks and
grabbed a 43-38 lead with five minutes left in the first half. At
that point, the Hawks were shooting 55 percent and outrebounding
the Knicks. And most of this damage was done with Mutombo on the
bench.
</P>
<P>
   For several weeks, the Hawks have been in future mode, wanting
to look at young players such as center Lorenzen Wright. He was
playing well in the second quarter, so coach Lenny Wilkens kept him
on the floor.
</P>
<P>
   Late in the second quarter, the Knicks finally awoke to the fact
that Mutombo was off the floor and made a 14-6 run to close out the
half. Strangely enough, they junked driving to the basket, even
with Mutombo out of their way, and rode the hot touch of Houston to
take a 52-49 lead at the half.
</P>
<P>
   Sprewell provided the jolt. With 15 energetic points in the
third, he pushed the Knicks out to a 78-66 lead entering the
fourth. From the second-half tip, Sprewell's force was uncorked. He
raced down the court for a dunk off the fast break while being
fouled in the process and then turned a steal into another
opportunity for his team.
</P>
<P>
   By pushing the ball and passing crisply to the open man, he was
the energy boost the Knicks needed.
</P>
<P>
   Sprewell brought everyone along for the ride. Even Larry
Johnson, who has been mired in a slump for two weeks, found his
rhythm. It did not matter if Ewing and Mutombo were getting nowhere
as they banged heads inside; the Knicks had intensity on defense.

MISSOURIAN'S RESEARCH INTO BIBLICAL TIMES GETS POPE'S ATTENTION 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By LYNN FRANEY  
 c. 1999 Kansas City Star   KANSAS CITY, Mo. _ In the Tabgha
Monastery by the Sea of Galilee on Friday, young people sang
``Kumbaya,'' and nuns and priests filled the chapel.
<TEXT>
<P>
   Jack Magruder, president of Truman State University in
Kirksville, Mo., sat in a folding chair, awaiting Pope John Paul
II.
</P>
<P>
   The pope came through the door, approached the altar and prayed.
Then it was time for the ceremony that had drawn Magruder thousands
of miles.
</P>
<P>
   A Benedictine monk handed the pope two books that Truman State
University Press had published about the lost town of Bethsaida, an
ancient fishing village nearby. Scholars believe it was the home of
the apostle Peter and other disciples of Jesus.
</P>
<P>
   The Catholic Church considers Peter the first pope; Jesus told
Peter he was the rock on which he would build his church.
</P>
<P>
   ``Peter. Peter.''
</P>
<P>
   A frail John Paul II repeated the name of his predecessor and
smiled at Magruder's small delegation from the Bethsaida
Excavations Project, based at the University of Nebraska-Omaha.
</P>
<P>
   Magruder, a Methodist, said his heart would forever cherish
Friday's brief meeting and his travels along the Sea of Galilee.
The area around Bethsaida is where the New Testament says Jesus
performed miracles, including feeding thousands of people with a
few fish and loaves of bread, curing a blind man and walking on the
sea's water to strengthen the faith of his followers.
</P>
<P>
   ``This has been overwhelming,'' Magruder said by telephone from
a kibbutz hotel, where his window overlooks the Sea of Galilee.
``All my life I have heard of these places, and it never occurred
to me that I would ever go. We're seeing Jerusalem, Bethlehem, the
Sea of Galilee, (the place) where Jesus said the Beatitudes. All
those things _ they're just pretty impressive.''
</P>
<P>
   The road to Galilee for Magruder began a decade ago when he was
a vice president at Northeast Missouri State University, now called
Truman State.
</P>
<P>
   Professor Mark Appold asked Magruder whether the school could
join other universities in digging out the lost town of Bethsaida,
just north of the Sea of Galilee on the east bank of the Jordan
River. Magruder approved.
</P>
<P>
   Appold now takes Truman students to Israel, Jordan and Syria
every summer. They work with the Bethsaida Excavation Project's
founder, Israeli archaeologist Rami Arav, an adjunct professor at
Nebraska-Omaha.
</P>
<P>
   The students sift dirt and move rocks. Lots of rocks.
</P>
<P>
   They discover pottery shards and fishing hooks. They hold in
their hands clues to what the world looked like 2,000 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's exciting because it's like a treasure hunt and you never
know what you're going to find,'' Appold said of the dig.
</P>
<P>
   The excavations have revealed an old city gate believed to
predate Jesus' birth by several centuries, a statue of an Egyptian
god, a small Roman temple and a large house with a courtyard. The
researchers also found a Roman key. A replica of the key also was
given to John Paul II on Friday.
</P>
<P>
   The finds aren't complete, but archaeologists and historians are
using the pieces to unravel the history of this town that had
disappeared from maps for hundreds of years.
</P>
<P>
   In the late 1980s, Arav decided to investigate a mound just east
of the Jordan River called et-Tell to see whether it was the site
of Bethsaida.
</P>
<P>
   Scholars now say it was. Now Bethsaida is marked on Israeli
maps, and Truman State University's books on Bethsaida are sold in
the Israel Museum. And the Truman State students participate in the
discovery of history.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was incredible just to think about how old the place you
were standing is,'' said senior Kenny Boyce, a nondenominational
Christian from Raymore who participated in the dig. ``All the
things that had taken place there _ it was amazing. We got to go
swimming in the Sea of Galilee every day we were on the dig.''
</P>
<P>
   Boyce is working toward a physics degree with a minor in
philosophy and religion. ``It was a chance to explore my faith a
little and see the historical places associated with my faith. I
felt a deeper connection,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   That's also what the trip has given Magruder _ a chance to live
the words in his Bible.
</P>
<P>
   Today, Magruder plans to visit the archaeological site and
witness the placing of a marker honoring Truman State and the other
colleges in the Bethsaida Excavations Project.
</P>
<P>
   Magruder said he has been moved by the pope's emphasis on peace
between people of different faiths, especially between Catholics
and Jews and between Jews and Muslims.
</P>
<P>
   In reading one of the pontiff's books during his Israeli trip,
Magruder found a piece of wisdom which he said will ``be on my lips
often.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Ethnic and cultural differences should never be seen as
justifying conflict,'' John Paul II wrote. ``Rather, like the
various voices in a choir, these differences can exist in harmony,
provided there is a real desire to respect one another.''

NEW SCHEDULE DRAWS REACTIONS

<TEXT>
<P>
   IRWINDALE, Calif. _ The newly configured 2000 Irwindale Speedway
schedule could be one of feast or famine, according to several
drivers who competed at the track last year.
</P>
<P>
   The speedway _ which begins its second season at 7 tonight with
a full slate of NASCAR races, including the $15,000 Home Depot
Super Late Model 100 _ has eliminated its heat races and will have
longer feature events.
</P>
<P>
   ``For the top guys, it's not a big deal,'' said Rip Michels of
Mission Hills, who will compete in tonight's Grand American
Modified class race. ``We rarely were in the heats. But for the
guys trying to qualify, it will make a difference.''
</P>
<P>
   The track's trophy dashes _ for the fastest six qualifiers _
will remain in place. But instead of qualifying heats, the track
will have a lesser main event for the slower qualifiers, with the
top finishers being added to the main event.
</P>
<P>
   ``If something was not right, you could change things and check
for leaks during the heat races,'' said John Watkinson of Santa
Clarita, a Grand American driver. ``I think (the change) is
political.''
</P>
<P>
   Track competition director Chris Morgan says the elimination of
the heats and lengthening of the feature event will save wear and
tear on the cars and add to the night.
</P>
<P>
   ``This makes for better racing,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Tonight's Super Late Model winner will receive $3,000 with the
last-place finisher receiving $200, double the entry fee. More than
60 cars are expected to vie for the 30-car field.
</P>
<P>
   Late Models, Grand American and Super Stocks will also be
competing.
</P>
<P>
   The ticket office opens at noon, the gates at 5 p.m.

   ``In the hot Kansas City sun, those heat up and burn hands and
feet,'' said Denise Dowd, an emergency room doctor at Children's
Mercy Hospital.
</P>
<P>
   Underfoot, mixed in with the sand and pea gravel around the
equipment, half-buried pieces of broken glass glinted menacingly.
They are a sure source of lacerations for any child running
barefoot, Dowd said.
</P>
<P>
   Playground hazards like these are common to the parks and
schools of central Kansas City, where antiquated equipment and
years of neglect put children at risk. But safety experts from
Children's Mercy and community leaders said Friday at a news
conference at Montgall Park that they hope to eliminate many of
these perils.
</P>
<P>
   Beginning with Montgall Park this spring, and eventually
focusing on other parks, they plan to replace broken-down
playgrounds with newer, safer equipment. And by encouraging local
residents to get involved in the design and construction of the
playgrounds, Children's Mercy intends to use the improvements as a
catalyst to revive inner-city neighborhoods.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody plays a role in this. It's a neighborhood effort,''
said Lenita Johnson, manager of the Center for Childhood Safety at
Children's Mercy.
</P>
<P>
   Unsafe playgrounds have been recognized in recent years as a
serious problem in neighborhoods across the country, particularly
in urban cores. And many communities in the Kansas City area and
elsewhere, including suburbs that generally have more resources for
playground improvements, have been working to eliminate such
hazards.
</P>
<P>
   The Children's Mercy project, called Safe Places, is modeled
after a similar program in New York's Harlem neighborhood, where
Harlem Hospital Center has worked to improve more than 30
playgrounds over the past decade. During that time, the incidence
of accidental injuries among children there has been cut in half.
</P>
<P>
   ``We want children out exercising, not playing in abandoned
buildings and in the street, and not sitting in front of a
television,'' said Barbara Barlow, the physician who organized the
Harlem playgrounds program.
</P>
<P>
   Although city tax money will pay for some of the Kansas City
park improvements, Children's Mercy is seeking private donations to
buy new equipment for playgrounds. A Safe Places fund has been set
up at the Greater Kansas City Community Foundation to accept
donations.
</P>
<P>
   A 1998 study by the Consumer Federation of America found that
nationwide, 87 percent of all public playgrounds lacked adequate
protective surfaces. Climbing equipment was too high in 62 percent
of playgrounds, and 58 percent had swings placed too close
together.
</P>
<P>
   Locally, Children's Mercy researchers have identified these
kinds of playground hazards as a significant cause of childhood
injuries, especially in the inner city, Dowd said.
</P>
<P>
   From August 1997 through September 1998, the emergency room at
Children's Mercy treated 146 children for playground-related
injuries. Fourteen had to be hospitalized. The total cost of
treating their injuries was $205,294.
</P>
<P>
   More than half the injuries occurred in playgrounds in Kansas
City's 3rd City Council district, which covers roughly the area
bounded by Ninth Street on the north, 41st Street on the south,
Troost Avenue on the west and the city line on the east.
</P>
<P>
   A survey by the hospital of 42 playgrounds at parks, schools and
community organizations in the 3rd District found more than a dozen
had hazardous or outmoded equipment.
</P>
<P>
   The problems included equipment in which a child's head could
become trapped; broken swing chains, metal bolts projecting from
climbing equipment, an unstable climbing dome, broken glass,
chipped paint and cement play surfaces.
</P>
<P>
   With neighborhood residents pitching in to help, two new
playgrounds will be built in Montgall Park in late April.
</P>
<P>
   One playground is designed for children about 2 to 5 years old;
the other, for older children up to about 12. Equipment will be
made of vinyl, and both playgrounds will have spongy rubber play
surfaces that will be poured into place.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's probably about the best surfacing you can get,'' Johnson
said.
</P>
<P>
   The city is adding a walking trail, two drinking fountains and a
baseball diamond. But Children's Mercy is seeking donations to
cover the $64,000 cost of playground equipment.
</P>
<P>
   Children's Mercy has been working on the project with the
Washington Wheatley Neighborhood Association, which represents
residents living around Montgall Park. Parents and children in the
neighborhood helped choose the playground equipment and their
preferred colors.
</P>
<P>
   Local social service organizations such as the Seton Center
Family and Health Services, schools and the city parks and
recreation and police departments also have lent their support.
</P>
<P>
   And as plans for the new playgrounds have progressed, they have
already stimulated community interest in new projects, Johnson
said.
</P>
<P>
   For example, a local artist plans to work with young people in
the neighborhood to paint murals, a way to cut down on graffiti.
And several residents have expressed interest in starting a Little
League team.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's a great opportunity to revitalize the
neighborhood,'' said Rachel Asaro, director of Seton Center, which
is a block from the park.
</P>
<P>
   ``Up to now, we've been afraid to use the park because of the
crime element. This is a way for the community to take hold and
make this a safe place,'' Asaro said.
</P>
<P>
   ``My vision is to see children out here playing safely. Older
adults coming out and seeing the beauty of the community.''
</P>
<P>
   Children's Mercy expects the new playgrounds to be very
well-used. The Washington Wheatley neighborhood has more than 3,000
residents. Another 11,000 people in nearby neighborhoods are also
likely to use the park. About 25 percent of the population of those
neighborhoods is under age 18.
</P>
<P>
   Other Kansas City area communities also are addressing the
problem of unsafe playgrounds:
</P>
<P>
   - Independence is halfway through a roughly six-year, $620,000
program to upgrade the city's playgrounds.
</P>
<P>
   ``Within the last two to three years we have removed a lot of
outdated playground equipment,'' said Jim Fisher, who oversees the
city's playgrounds.
</P>
<P>
   Many times, because funding wasn't readily available, those
playgrounds were not replaced right away. Independence officials,
however, felt such steps were necessary to protect children from
potentially hazardous equipment and the city from lawsuits.

<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ More than a thousand mourners filled a funeral home
in Brooklyn on Friday night to pay respects to Patrick Dorismond,
the 26-year-old security guard killed by a plainclothes policeman
last week.
</P>
<P>
   Dozens carried or wore the Haitian flag, and members of his
family of renowned Haitian musicians sang for him. Across Flatbush
Avenue, picketing protesters demanded justice for the fourth
unarmed black man to be killed by the police in the last 13 months.
</P>
<P>
   Inside the Andrew Torregrossa Funeral Home in Marine Park,
Dorismond lay in a coffin lined with white satin, underneath an
arch with his name written in white and green carnations. Several
women, overcome with grief, let out hoarse, muffled cries and had
to be escorted out.
</P>
<P>
   Johnny Dorismond, the victim's older brother, said his brother
had gone to a better place, in contrast to whoever killed him. ``If
he has a guilty conscience, that's his torture for life.''
</P>
<P>
   Dorismond was shot on March 16 after a plainclothes police
officer approached him outside a bar in midtown Manhattan and asked
if he knew where to buy marijuana. Dorismond reacted angrily, and
in the ensuing scuffle one of the officer's backups, Detective
Anthony Vasquez, shot him in the chest.
</P>
<P>
   Vasquez has said through his lawyer that the shooting was
accidental.
</P>
<P>
   The wake Friday night was attended by Haiti's consul general to
the United States, Therese Guitos, and by Alan Hevesi, the city
comptroller.
</P>
<P>
   ``The overwhelming majority of New Yorkers who are decent caring
people offer their most profound sympathy and understanding for
your loss,'' Hevesi told the Dorismond family. ``This is an awful,
awful day.''
</P>
<P>
   Outside the funeral home, about four dozen peaceful protesters,
surrounded by dozens of police officers in powder-blue
windbreakers, chanted and carried signs, mostly in Haitian Creole,
denouncing Mayor Rudolph Giuliani. Some of the signs compared the
mayor to a ``loup garou,'' a Haitian demon who seeks the blood of
babies.
</P>
<P>
   The death of Dorismond has inflamed political and racial
tensions in the city, not just because of the shooting itself but,
critics say, because of the way the Giuliani administration has
handled its aftermath.
</P>
<P>
   Shortly after the incident, Giuliani and Police Commissioner
Howard Safir released Dorismond's police record, including a sealed
court record of an incident when he was 13. They did not
immediately release Vasquez's disciplinary record _ which included
his shooting a neighbor's Rottweiler and pulling a gun in a 1997
bar fight.
</P>
<P>
   Critics, including Hillary Rodham Clinton, Giuliani's opponent
in the race for the U.S. Senate in New York, accused city officials
of blaming Dorismond for his own death. But the mayor said that he
was merely pointing out that Dorismond had acted violently in the
past and might have acted violently in the moments that led to the
shooting.
</P>
<P>
   Dorismond was a security guard for the 34th Street Partnership
and had two children. He was never convicted of a crime as an
adult. His arrests for punching a man in an argument over drugs in
1993 and for pulling a gun during a traffic dispute in 1996
resulted in disorderly-conduct charges, for which he did community
service, and no jail time. The case against him in 1987, when he
was 13, was dropped.
</P>
<P>
   His death was a bitter blow to Haitian Americans, still reeling
from the brutalization by the police of Abner Louima, who in 1997
was sodomized with a stick in a Brooklyn precinct station house
after being arrested in a case of mistaken identity.
</P>
<P>
   And Dorismond's death comes soon after the verdict on Feb. 25 in
the Amadou Diallo case, where four plainclothes police officers
were cleared of criminal charges after firing 41 shots at the
unarmed Guinean street peddler, hitting him 41 times.
</P>
<P>
   Five days after that verdict, Malcolm Ferguson, 23, and also
black and unarmed, was killed by plainclothes officers in the
Bronx, three blocks from where Diallo was shot. The other unarmed
black man killed by the police recently was Richard Watson, who was
shot in the back last September.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   At Dorismond's wake, Delroy LaRoc, a friend of Dorismond since
1989, when they attended high school together, remembered making
music with him.
</P>
<P>
   ``He would be the beat and I would be the lyrics,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   LaRoc recalled how his friend recently celebrated receiving his
tax refund by taking him out to a $90.07 dinner.
</P>
<P>
   ``He ate so much food, you just gotta love him,'' he said. ``The
next day he got up and went to work, and after work he never came
back.''
</P>
<P>
   The Rev. Al Sharpton arrived later in the evening and entered
the funeral home with his arm around Louima. Sharpton give a brief
prayer and Louima spoke to the mourners, saying there must not be a
repeat of these incidents. After Sharpton left, a crowd of
demonstrators spilled into the street.
</P>
<P>
   Dorismond's death left one mourner, Felix Serieux, 12, of East
New York, afraid and perplexed.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's just sad,'' said Felix, a seventh-grader. ``It makes
afraid for my own life, you understand. ```Say no to drugs.' They
tell you that in school, to say no. So what happens now? Do you
have to say yes?''

SAFETY, ACCESSIBILITY BECOME FOCUS FOR KC AREA PLAYGROUNDS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 BY ALAN BAVLEY AND RUTH E. IGOE  
 c. 1999 Kansas City Star   KANSAS CITY, Mo. _ Installation for six
brand-new playgrounds is underway and expected to be completed by
May. Another six playgrounds are planned in another two years.
<TEXT>
<P>
   New playgrounds feature shorter slides and
handicapped-accessible equipment.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to new playgrounds funded by a one-eighth cent sales
tax, city officials have also started a matching grant program that
provides partial funding to neighborhood groups that also help pay
for more playgrounds.
</P>
<P>
   ``Those things would've, should've, could've been taken care of
years ago,'' Fisher said. ``Playground safety has been around a
long time, but it hasn't been a household term until the last few
years. Now, people are paying attention.''
</P>
<P>
   - Overland Park has been spending between $50,000 and $100,000
annually to remove and replace outdated or unsafe playground
equipment.
</P>
<P>
   Such ongoing efforts are necessary in the city's 50 playgrounds,
explained Parks and Forestry Manager Greg Ruther, because safety
standards and guidelines change almost every year.
</P>
<P>
   ``We do have older equipment out there that was current when it
was purchased, but like everything else, that changes,'' Ruther
said.
</P>
<P>
   Three city staff members certified in playground inspection also
make monthly checks on playground equipment, he said, looking for
things like protruding screws, damaged equipment or thinning mulch
around structures. Those areas most in need get highest priority.
Another focus is making all playgrounds handicapped-accessible.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've gotten more aggressive in the last couple of years,''
Ruther said.
</P>
<P>
   - Lee's Summit has started regular playground equipment
inspections, replacement and modernization.
</P>
<P>
   ``Almost all our playgrounds have gone through a cycle in
changes in the last few years,'' said Parks and Recreation
Administrator Tom Lovell. ``We yanked all the equipment out,
replaced all the equipment and materials. The old jungle gyms you
used to find in playgrounds? You won't find those anymore.''
</P>
<P>
   This year, the city is spending roughly $90,000 on new
playground equipment at three parks: Hartman, Lowenstein and
Summit.
</P>
<P>
   As in Overland Park, officials in Lee's Summit still know there
is equipment in their parks that does not meet current guidelines,
said Lovell, but that the city is only within a few years until all
that is gone also.
</P>
<P>
   ``We try to make adjustments as rapidly as'' standards change,
he said.

NETS IN PAINFUL LOSS TO TIMBERWOLVES, 116-115 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By STEVE POPPER   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   EAST RUTHERFORD, N.J. _ As the Nets desperately chased the
Timberwolves around the court trying to foul, to somehow prolong a
game that they needed to win, the horn sounded, ending the game.
The next sound was Kevin Garnett's booming voice, screaming in
search of Stephon Marbury.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's over,'' he shouted. ``Give me some love.''
</P>
<P>
   That Marbury could do, hugging his former Minnesota teammate and
friend. But what Marbury could not do was smile, not after the Nets
saw an emotional comeback ruined in the final seconds of overtime
Friday night as they fell to the Timberwolves, 116-115, at
Continental Arena.
</P>
<P>
   With Orlando winning Friday night, the 11th-place Nets slipped
four games from the eighth and last playoff spot in the Eastern
Conference, with 14 games to play.
</P>
<P>
   Garnett methodically pounded nails into the Nets' playoff hopes.
He hit seven of his first eight shots and finished with 38 points.
</P>
<P>
   In the first meeting of the two teams since Marbury forced his
way out of Minnesota, Marbury had 39 points and the victory.
Garnett had 27 points and 18 rebounds in that game, but he shot
just nine for 33.
</P>
<P>
   In that game, Marbury had the burden of traveling back to
Minnesota, but it was his friend Garnett who seemed most affected
by the reunion. While Marbury was booed regularly, Garnett seemed
to shrink under the emotion of the game.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think I rushed a couple of shots, probably didn't take as
much time as I should have,'' Garnett said before Friday night's
game. ``At the same time, they came to play. Last time was more
emotional, just because I hadn't seen Steph in a long time. When
you take that out of the equation, I'm a lot more relaxed.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every time you step on the floor with an ex-teammate things
are going to always come back. It won't probably be as high-profile
or high-intensity, but it will be there.''
</P>
<P>
   That performance got the Timberwolves to rethink their approach
to the game, diversifying their attack rather than running
everything through Garnett. Since that game, Garnett had shot 55.3
percent and the team had won 13 of 16 games.
</P>
<P>
   ``That game was probably a blessing in disguise,'' Minnesota
coach Flip Saunders said. ``After that we really ended up
diversifying our offense more. We do not run nearly as much stuff
through Kevin, and Kevin's been a lot more efficient. If you look
at our last game, he scored 40 points with 23 shots. We've done
some things to take some pressure off him. Wally Szczerbiak has
come in and played well. We have a lot more team balance.''
</P>
<P>
   Garnett added: ``It woke us up, man. It woke us up to the point
that we're not as good as we think we are. We've got to come out
and bring it every night.''
</P>
<P>
   There was little danger of Garnett's slipping into that sort of
shooting night this time as he dropped in his first shot and then
rarely missed after that. He hit seven of eight from the floor in
the first quarter, piling up 14 points as the Timberwolves built a
30-21 lead after one period.
</P>
<P>
   The Timberwolves built the lead to as many as 14 points in the
second period, but the Nets, despite allowing Minnesota to shoot
62.5 percent in the first half, continued to hang around.
</P>
<P>
   Trailing by 11 with less than two minutes left in the half, the
Nets got a breakaway dunk by Jamie Feick on a steal by Marbury, and
then Marbury added a pull-up 3-point field goal on the next trip.
</P>
<P>
   That cut the lead to 6, and the Nets went into the locker room
down by just 56-48.
</P>
<P>
   In their second-half comeback, the Nets made big shots, with
Keith Van Horn, Kerry Kittles and Marbury taking turns converting
in the clutch.
</P>
<P>
   The game went back and forth for the final minute of regulation,
with the lead changing hands six times.
</P>
<P>
   Trailing by 1 point with 7.7 seconds left when Marbury fouled
out, Lucious Harris entered the game. Kittles attempted a short
jumper, and as the ball bounced off the rim, Harris darted into the
lane, leaping inside and above the 7-foot Garnett to tip in the
go-ahead shot with 2.2 seconds to play.
</P>
<P>
   Garnett then drew a foul at the other end as he and Burrell
battled for position. He converted one of two shots with the clock
not moving to send the game into overtime.

NEW CONTRACT URGED FOR ASSOCIATED'S UNION WORKERS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RANDOLPH HEASTER  
 c. 1999 Kansas City Star   KANSAS CITY, Mo. _ About 300 supporters
of Associated Wholesale Grocers Inc.'s union workers gathered
Friday near the food wholesaler's Kansas City, Kan., headquarters,
calling for a new contract for more than 600 employees.
<TEXT>
<P>
   Friends, family members, and area union activists picketed and
chanted on Kansas Avenue, across the street from Associated's
offices.
</P>
<P>
   The rally was held with just eight days remaining on a
three-year agreement between Associated and Teamsters Local 955.
The local represents Associated's warehouse and transportation
department employees.
</P>
<P>
   Associated gave those workers a 60-day layoff notice on Feb. 1,
saying it was outsourcing those operations to private companies on
April 2 unless a new contract could be reached.
</P>
<P>
   A similar notice was delivered to nearly 700 Associated
employees at its Springfield division.
</P>
<P>
   Associated, an 850-member store food cooperative, said it needed
work-rule changes to boost productivity and efficiency in the face
of competition from Wal-Mart Stores Inc. and other national chains.
</P>
<P>
   Teamsters officials have contended they have made proposals to
increase efficiencies for the cooperative but have been rejected at
every turn.
</P>
<P>
   On Friday, supporters of Associated's employees made their
viewpoint known.
</P>
<P>
   ``My question is, how can (Associated) negotiate in good faith
when they have already given the workers a 60-day notice?'' asked
Beverly Welling, whose husband has worked in the garage of
Associated's transportation department for 30 years.
</P>
<P>
   Welling said her husband and other employees are not interested
in working for another company that would handle Associated's
transportation department.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you have 30 years in and a retirement plan with the
Teamsters, he wouldn't consider working in a new nonunion
environment,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Perryman Refrigerated Lines, which has a tentative agreement to
operate Associated's transportation department in Kansas City,
Kan., on April 2, employs owner-operators who are nonunion.
</P>
<P>
   Daniel Goodman, a union driver for Fleming Companies Inc., said
he was supporting the work force of a competing company in efforts
to sustain a middle-class standard of living.
</P>
<P>
   ``(Associated) is a profitable company that the union has helped
build up through the years,'' said Goodman, a 14-year driver for
Fleming. ``Now, the company has achieved superiority in the
marketplace, and they want to throw the union aside.''
</P>
<P>
   Former Kansas Gov. Joan Finney also attended Friday's rally.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you know you are right, nothing can stop you,'' she told
a cheering crowd.
</P>
<P>
   Associated reiterated Friday that it is seeking to resolve the
dispute.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are committed to the negotiations,'' said Jerry Garland,
Associated's senior vice president of marketing. ``But time is
running short. We're disappointed the Teamsters have only met with
us six times since Feb. 1.''
</P>
<P>
   Associated and Teamsters officials met March 16-17 in Clinton,
Mo., and a follow-up session was held on Wednesday. Bobby Davidson,
president of Local 955, said the union presented a new proposal to
pay drivers based on hours and mileage, but it was soundly
rejected.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're trying to get there, but it's difficult when they reject
everything that's put on the table,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Robert Baker, Associated's chief negotiator, said the two sides
have made little progress.
</P>
<P>
   ``We looked at their proposal for the drivers versus our
tentative contract with Perryman, and it was woefully inadequate,''
Baker said. ``It fell far short of the savings we would gain from
Perryman.''
</P>
<P>
   Baker said the company was hoping the union would present a
written proposal on Tuesday, when daily negotiations begin as the
contract deadline approaches.
</P>
<P>
   ``We can talk about these issues in theory and concept, but the
union needs to get to the specifics as AWG has done in our proposal
that has been on the table for six weeks,'' Baker said.

KCP&AMP;L SUBSIDIARY JOINS E-COMMERCE VENTURE 
</HEADLINE>

 By STEVE EVERLY  
 c. 1999 Kansas City Star   KANSAS CITY, Mo. _ A Kansas City Power &AMP;
Light Co. subsidiary has become a partner in a venture that aims to
boost the use of e-commerce in purchasing supplies by electric
utilities in the U.S. and abroad.
<TEXT>
<P>
   KLT Inc., KCP&AMP;L's deregulated subsidiary, and the St.
Louis-based utility Ameren UE, have become partners with bex.com on
an electronic site that will allow electric utilities to combine
their buying power and shop for everything from paper clips to
heavy machinery.
</P>
<P>
   ``This...exchange for the electrical utilities industry
effectively brings an old economy market into the new economy,''
said Greg Orman, president of KLT.
</P>
<P>
   The amount of KLT's investment was not disclosed, although KCP&AMP;L
spokesman Tom Robinson described it as ``small.''
</P>
<P>
   The project is expected to begin operating in the second
quarter. Other utilities also might become partners, said Erin
Lutz, a spokeswoman for bex.com based in San Diego.
</P>
<P>
   Lutz said the electronic platform will allow electric utilities
to amass more buying power. In addition, it is expected to smooth
the purchasing of supplies by putting in one place everything from
quotations to payment.
</P>
<P>
   Formed in 1996, bex.com operates e-marketplaces specializing in
business-to-business transactions.

A SPRING DIP INTO THE MAILBAG 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JERRY HEASTER  
 c. 1999 Kansas City Star   KANSAS CITY, Mo. _ The time has come,
the walrus said, to speak of many things, mostly of how long it has
been since Uncle Fearless turned the column's reins over to his
valued contributors. Dipping into the ol' mailbag, the first
contribution is from a guy wondering about the stock market's
recent whuppin' of Procter &AMP; Gamble.
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``When P&AMP;G announced quarterly profits were going to be lower
than expected...P&AMP;G shares dropped $28 (and when) computer trading
kicked in (it caused) the fourth-largest one-day dip in (Dow Jones
industrial average) history. What if the market had said, `OK. So
what?' What would the impact to shareholders have been if there had
not been this large sell-off?''
</P>
<P>
   Dear Wondering: There are two answers to your question, both
simple. If the market had ignored P&AMP;G's transgression, P&AMP;G
investors would be a lot richer today, at least on paper. It's a
meaningless hypothetical, though. The market never says `OK. So
what?' when companies mislead Wall Street on earnings prospects.
The punishment is always certain and swift, because analysts will
forgive earnings disappointments a lot sooner than they will being
played for fools.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking of being played for fools, another reader had some
questions about how those demonizing the tobacco industry to enrich
themselves could do so without disinterested bystanders asking
obvious questions.
</P>
<P>
   ``Why is it illegal for a child to smoke because it might kill
him, yet OK for a mother to kill him in the womb? Why is it I can
sit in a bar in some states, consume (beer), then drive anywhere,
yet...I have to step outside into the weather (to) smoke? Why is it
in this supposedly free country an immigrant (co-worker) from
Russia would comment, `I guess I'll have to go back to Russia to
enjoy the freedom of smoking,' (which) made me ashamed to admit I
served in the armed forces.''
</P>
<P>
   Dear Questioning: Having no good answers to your questions, some
advice will have to do. As one veteran to another, never be ashamed
of your military service. This type of contribution may be out of
fashion, but it's still a highly honorable aspect of your life.
Meanwhile, there are worse things than being harassed as a smoker.
Living in Russia would top my list in that regard.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking of the military, one reader wrote a letter to the
editor to point out that the cost of maintaining a U.S. defense
presence in the Middle East means gasoline taxes are really too
low.
</P>
<P>
   ``America acquiesces to the role of Mideast military policeman
at a taxpayer expense that exceeds $100 billion, according to the
Center for Defense Information. If we Americans insist on having
our SUVs and car-centric ways, we should pay the true ongoing cost
of this increasing Mideast oil flow dependency.''
</P>
<P>
   Dear Mr. Geopolitics: If the military existed solely to protect
U.S. energy interests in the Middle East, this view would make more
sense. The military, however, exists to protect myriad American
interests that go far beyond defending against foreign attackers. A
secure supply of petroleum is but one of those interests.
Maintaining a military is part of the geopolitical overhead cost
that goes with being a powerful nation.
</P>
<P>
   Keep them cards and letters comin', hear?
