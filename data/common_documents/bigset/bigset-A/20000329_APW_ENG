Fort Worth Hit By Tornado
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   FORT WORTH, Texas (AP) -- A powerful tornado blew through downtown just after
rush hour Tuesday night, shattering windows in high-rise buildings, overturning
cars and uprooting trees. Four people were killed and at least 36 were injured,
police said. The tornado hit shortly after 6:30 p.m. amid severe thunderstorms
that were accompanied by torrential rains, softball-sized hail and strong winds.
In South Texas, funnel clouds were reported near Dripping Springs but there were
no reports of damage.

OPEC Agrees To Boost Oil Production
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   VIENNA, Austria (AP) -- OPEC ignored objections of its second-biggest member
and agreed to increase oil production. But opinions varied on whether the amount
of new oil flowing into the market would be enough to significantly bring down
gasoline prices in the United States. While some said the decrease would be just
a few pennies per gallon, the Clinton administration projected it would be 11
cents to 18 cents by late summer. In a rare departure from its normal quest for
unanimity, ministers of the 11-nation cartel announced Wednesday morning that
nine members would raise production by 6.3 percent, or a total of 1.45 million
barrels a day.

Bush Reaches Out to McCain
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   PARSIPPANY, N.J. (AP) -- George W. Bush reached out to vanquished
presidential rival John McCain on Tuesday, declaring ''the past is the past''
and it's time for them to meet. Another former rival, Steve Forbes, endorsed
Bush as the Republicans moved toward reconciliation after a bruising primary
season. McCain suspended his campaign March 9 after Bush won a string of
primaries two days earlier on Super Tuesday. The Arizona senator won seven GOP
primaries, including the leadoff contest in New Hampshire.

Cuba Fears Elian Move Outside US

   HAVANA (AP) -- President Fidel Castro said Tuesday his government told U.S.
officials it is worried that Miami-based exiles might take Elian Gonzalez to
another country or even harm him if they lose their battle to block the boy's
return to Cuba. Castro said a group of Cuban-Americans in Miami was studying the
possibility of taking Elian and his Miami relatives to a third nation, probably
Nicaragua or Costa Rica. Castro said his government had shared its concerns with
the U.S. State Department about the possibility of such a move.''

three people and prompting an international search for the missing. Four people
swam to safety on a nearby island and were rescued early today, said Lisa Lapin,
a spokeswoman for the University of California, Davis. A search was on for the
others. The school said graduate student Mike Rose and a visiting Japanese
scholar were killed. The Coast Guard also said two people died, although the

New Soybean Oil Said Healthier
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Government scientists have developed a new soybean that's
healthier for the heart because the oil need not go through a process that
produces artery-clogging trans fatty acids and it has less than half the
saturated fat of conventional soybeans. Food manufacturers -- who use soybean
oil in everything from margarine to crackers -- are eager to get the healthier
oil because of Food and Drug Administration plans to require the listing of
trans fats on food nutrition labels. Consumers won't see the new product before
next year at the earliest.

<HEADLINE> Magic 122, Celtics 87  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   ORLANDO, Fla. (AP) -- No Darrell Armstrong was no problem for
Orlando.
</P>
<P>
   The Magic floor leader was ejected following his second
technical at the 10:39 mark of the third quarter with Orlando
trailing the Boston Celtics 52-50 Tuesday. But his backup, Chucky
Atkins, calmly stepped in and scored 12 of his 21 points in the
third quarter to help Orlando to a 122-87 victory.
</P>
<P>
   Atkins said he knew what he had to do with Armstrong out.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's a confidence boost to play like this, but it's nothing
new to me,'' Atkins said. ''As the backup point guard, I'm counted
on to come in and get things done. Darrell went out and I was able
to come in and compensate. My mindset was to go out and play
hard.''
</P>
<P>
   The Magic seemed to get inspired from Armstrong's ejection as it
outscored the Celtics 40-11 in the quarter. After Dana Barros made
both free throws following the technical, the Magic went on a 19-0
run as Boston missed its first 11 field goal attempts. Danny
Fortson gave Boston its first basket of the third quarter at the
6:45 mark to make it 69-56.
</P>
<P>
   From there, Orlando ended the quarter on a 21-7 run to lead
90-63. The Magic made 16 of 24 field goals in the quarter while
Boston was 3-for-23.
</P>
<P>
   ''When he (Armstrong) got thrown out, that gave them a lot of
momentum at that point,'' Celtics coach Rick Pitino said. ''It was
truly a bad game, a debacle. They trap like a college team and you
have to attack it to make the extra pass and make good shots.
You've got to give them credit.''
</P>
<P>
   Boston also had trouble slowing Bo Outlaw, who had 10 points, 14
rebounds, 10 assists and four blocked shots. Ron Mercer had a
game-high 23 points as Orlando shot 55.3 percent. Ben Wallace added
13 points and nine rebounds and Corey Maggette had 12 and 11. Every
Magic player who dressed scored at least two points.
</P>
<P>
   The victory moves Orlando to within 1{ games of Detroit for the
seventh-place playoff position in the Eastern Conference. The
Celtics, who led by as many as 13 points in the first half, have
lost five in a row.
</P>
<P>
   Boston made 37.0 percent of its shots and had only one starter
in double figures as Vitaly Potapenko scored 10 points. Starters
Antoine Walker (five points) and Paul Pierce (eight) were a
combined 4-for-24 from the field. Barros came off the bench to lead
Boston with 19 points.
</P>
<P>
   ''We have been inconsistent like this all year,'' Barros said.
''Half to half, quarter to quarter, game to game. Tonight was just
a classic example of what has happened over a seven-month period.
Great at times, good at times, terrible at times.''
</P>
<P>
   Barros' running jumper with seven-tenths of a second remaining
gave Boston a 52-50 lead at halftime. Boston held a 13-point lead
at the 7:27 mark of the second quarter, but the Magic used a 20-4
run to go ahead 50-47 after Armstrong hit a 3-pointer and a running
jump shot on consecutive possessions. But the Celtics answered with
a 3-pointer by Adrian Griffin before Barros' shot to give Boston
the lead.
</P>
<P>
Notes: Orlando has won 13 of its last 14 at home. ... The Magic
(36-36) are at .500 for the first time this season since Jan. 5.
... Outlaw had his second career triple-double. The first was
against New Jersey on April 17, 1998, when he had 25 points, 13
rebounds and 10 assists. ... Boston set a franchise low for
third-quarter scoring with 11 points. In the last two games,
Orlando has allowed only 23 third-quarter points.

<HEADLINE> Brazil Opens World Cup Quest  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOGOTA, Colombia (AP) -- Four-time world champion Brazil opened
its drive to the 2002 World Cup with a scoreless tie against
Colombia on Tuesday in the first night of South American qualifying
matches.
</P>
<P>
   Depleted by injuries that sidelined its best scorer,
Spanish-league star Rivaldo, Brazil still controlled play
throughout the game and deprived Colombia of all but one serious
scoring chance.
</P>
<P>
   After a hard-fought match, both teams seemed to go away content
with the 0-0 result.
</P>
<P>
   The game's best scoring chance came 25 minutes into the first
half when Brazilian defender Roberto Carlos, a star with Spain's
Real Madrid, blasted a free kick just wide of lunging goaltender
Oscar Cordoba and the top right corner of Colombia's net.
</P>
<P>
   Striker Juan Pablo Angel had Colombia's best chance 11 minutes
into the first half with a long distance shot that caught Brazilian
goalkeeper Dida off guard and too far out of the net, but narrowly
missed the lower left corner.
</P>
<P>
   After a closely-played first half Brazil dominated the second,
creating several good scoring chances. Colombian defenders Ivan
Ramiro Cordoba and Mario Alberto Yepes thwarted several Brazilian
rushes with last-second tackles.
</P>
<P>
   The game was played at Bogota's El Campin stadium before a crowd
of more than 45,000 fans, including President Andres Pastrana.

<HEADLINE> GOP lawmaker: Pataki not fit to be vice president  </HEADLINE>
By MARC HUMBERT, AP Political Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) -- As they prepare for crucial presidential,
U.S. Senate and state legislative races this year, there are new
signs of disunity among New York Republicans.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday, a Republican state lawmaker said Gov. George Pataki
isn't fit to be vice president and questioned the GOP chief
executive's ability to win a third term in 2002.
</P>
<P>
   ''Here's a guy who wreaks vengeance on innocent people. What
would he do as president or vice president? He'd have us at war,''
said state Assemblyman Pat Casale, a Rensselaer County Republican.
</P>
<P>
   Casale, upset with Pataki over the firing of a half-dozen of the
administration's patronage appointees from Rensselaer County in a
feud with state Senate Republican Majority Leader Joseph Bruno,
said the governor also has ''really got some problems'' if he wants
a third term in 2002.
</P>
<P>
   Such blistering commentary from a GOP state lawmaker would have
been unthinkable earlier in Pataki's tenure, but Casale is the
second Republican state lawmaker to openly criticize Pataki or his
top aides this month. That is on top of the battling between the
governor and Bruno, the Legislature's most powerful Republican.
</P>
<P>
   ''The governor has always and will always put the interests of
the entire state first,'' Pataki spokesman Michael McKeon said when
asked for comment. ''Unfortunately, there will always be
individuals who put their egos first.''
</P>
<P>
   Pataki, who is hosting a major fund-raising luncheon in New York
City on Wednesday for George W. Bush, is considered a potential
presidential running mate for the Texas governor. But such a
selection likely hinges on convincing the Bush camp that Pataki can
deliver New York state to the GOP in November. Dissension within
GOP ranks in New York makes that even more unlikely in a state
where Democrats outnumber Republicans by a 5-3 margin.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to the presidential race, New York has a Senate race
pitting Hillary Rodham Clinton against Republican New York City
Mayor Rudolph Giuliani and all 211 seats of the state Legislature
go to voters this year.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this month, state Assemblyman Thomas Kirwan, a former
state trooper from Orange County, called on Pataki to fire his top
in-house political adviser, Zenia Mucha. Kirwan said he had heard
Mucha was threatening to have him challenged in a GOP primary
because he had supported Sen. John McCain in New York's
presidential primary over Bush, the governor's choice.
</P>
<P>
   Mucha, who served as Pataki's campaign manager in his successful
1998 run for a second term, denied any such threats and said
Kirwan's charges were ''a sad commentary that people will say or do
anything to get attention.''
</P>
<P>
   Casale, whose criticism of Pataki was first reported by the New
York Post, said Tuesday that the governor's move to use the state's
complex ballot access law to keep McCain out of the New York
presidential primary is one thing that could hurt the governor as
he seeks a third term.
</P>
<P>
   ''The veterans are turned off,'' said the GOP lawmaker, known
for mercurial behavior.
</P>
<P>
   Also, Casale, elected to the Assembly in 1992, said New York
sportsmen may be upset with Pataki for proposing sweeping
gun-control legislation that would require, among other things,
ballistic testing of all handguns before they are sold.
</P>
<P>
   And, the assemblyman said voters are getting upset that Pataki
doesn't spend more time in Albany, especially at a time when state
budget negotiations should be getting hot and heavy.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's a slap in the face to the people of the state ... He
should take the lead in this governing process and to do that he's
got to stay right here in Albany,'' Casale said.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, with the state's new fiscal year just five days away
and no budget agreement in sight, Pataki was not even in Albany and
aides refused to say exactly where he was. They said the governor
was away on a ''personal'' matter and wouldn't say if he was even
in New York state.
</P>
<P>
   Casale is a political ally of Bruno, the Senate leader who has
been at war with Pataki for several months over differences on
state policy and the related political strategy for this year's
legislative elections.
</P>
<P>
   Republican state Sen. Nicholas Spano of Westchester called
Casale's comments ''inexcusable'' and ''irresponsible.''
</P>
<P>
   ''This guy has crossed the line,'' Spano said.

<HEADLINE> Influential Jewish politician wants Clinton-Giuliani alternative  </HEADLINE>
By MARC HUMBERT, AP Political Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) -- A leader in New York's politically important
Orthodox Jewish community, state Assemblyman Dov Hikind, is calling
for an alternative to Hillary Rodham Clinton and Mayor Rudolph
Giuliani in New York's Senate race.
</P>
<P>
   ''People are dissatisfied with both Hillary and Giuliani. We
must find a senatorial candidate acceptable to more people,''
Hikind wrote in a letter Tuesday to state Conservative Party
Chairman Michael Long.
</P>
<P>
   Long described Hikind's interest in an alternative candidate as
''great'' and said it represented ''a significant crack in the dam
of both campaigns.''
</P>
<P>
   Long said he believes many Republicans and Democrats would like
other choices in the Senate race.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, Hikind and Long are not alone in their desire to have
other candidates step forward.
</P>
<P>
   A poll conducted last month by Marist College's Institute for
Public Opinion found that 50 percent of registered voters surveyed
statewide would like to see someone else run. Forty-six percent of
voters said they were satisfied with the choices.
</P>
<P>
   Hikind has been critical of the first lady for not supporting
the release of jailed Israeli spy Jonathan Pollard. And while the
Brooklyn Democrat once was a political supporter of Giuliani,
Hikind blames the Republican mayor for his indictment more than two
years ago on federal charges that the assemblyman diverted public
funds to personal uses. Hikind was acquitted by a federal jury in
July 1998.
</P>
<P>
   Long has said the Conservative Party will not back Giuliani
unless the mayor comes out for a legal ban on what critics call
''partial-birth'' abortions. Giuliani, an abortion-rights
supporter, has refused to do so.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike other states, New York allows major party candidates to
also collect votes on third-party ballot lines and no Republican
has won statewide office in New York in more than 25 years without
Conservative Party support.
</P>
<P>
   Long said Tuesday that he believes a credible alternative
candidate will step forward before the end of April. He has been
talking with leaders of the Reform Party-linked New York
Independence Party and the antiabortion Right to Life Party about
fielding a fusion candidate on all three ballot lines.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday, Giuliani was raising money in Washington at a
reception hosted by power couple Susan Molinari and Bill Paxon, two
former New York members of Congress. Clinton was in California,
also raising money.

<HEADLINE> State's Catholic leaders: provide state aid to our schools  </HEADLINE>
By ANNY KUO, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) -- Private and parochial schools in New York
are entitled to public funding when it comes to helping students
meet the new educational standards set by the state Board of
Regents, the state's Roman Catholic leaders say.
</P>
<P>
   The state Catholic Conference, which gathered Tuesday in its
annual public policy forum meeting, called for the state
Legislature to add $5.8 million in mandated services aid to private
and parochial schools in the upcoming state budget.
</P>
<P>
   The money would help cover costs for providing Regents-mandated
Academic Intervention Services for students struggling to meet the
new standards and for training teachers, said Bishops Howard
Hubbard of Albany and Henry Mansell of Buffalo.
</P>
<P>
   ''What we're asking for is a fraction of a fraction,'' Mansell
said, referring to the more than $12 billion the state spends on
public school education.
</P>
<P>
   More than 277,000 students attend the 857 Catholic schools in
the state. This is the 200th anniversary of the opening of the
first Catholic school in America, in St. Peter's Parish in New York
City, in 1800.
</P>
<P>
   Mansell said the Catholic leaders also support a state Assembly
tax credit bill that would allow parents of public, private and
parochial school students to deduct up to $1,500 per student or
$3,000 per family for educational expenses.
</P>
<P>
   The bishops' position was echoed by other religious groups.
Brooklyn Rabbi Sholem B. Hecht, chairman of the National Committee
for the Furtherance of Jewish Education, said the issue is ''not a
problem of church and state.''
</P>
<P>
   ''Kids who are going to religious schools are being
discriminated right now because they are not getting education
money,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Hecht said he, too, supports a voucher or tax credit program,
but added that he would like to see them without a maximum cap.
</P>
<P>
   But Steven Sanders, chairman of the Assembly's Education
Committee, said he doesn't expect funding increases to go beyond
the narrow categories that the state has traditionally reimbursed
nonpublic schools for, like transportation and special education.
</P>
<P>
   ''Those people who favor the state underwriting the cost of
tuition of a private or parochial school will be disappointed,''
Sanders, a Manhattan Democrat, said. ''We pretty much know with
respect to education funding what the parameters will be. I don't
see any possibility to go beyond that.''
</P>
<P>
   Hubbard and Mansell also said the Catholic Conference will
challenge legislative proposals that require health care facilities
to provide services that are at odds with Catholic beliefs.
</P>
<P>
   ''The state should collaborate with, rather than obstruct, the
efforts of religious organizations to help New Yorkers obtain
adequate health care, quality education and needed human
services,'' Hubbard said.
</P>
<P>
   Catholic health care providers should not have to provide
coverage for treatments related to infertility and treat rape
victims using abortion-inducing procedures, they said.
</P>
<P>
   One-fifth of Catholic hospitals that replied to a survey
conducted last year by the National Abortion and Reproductive
Rights Action League reported providing emergency contraception -- a
double dose of birth control pills -- in cases such as rape.
</P>
<P>
   The bishops also said they will fight legislation that would
require abortion coverage in Medicaid managed care plans and
proposals that would allow facilities affiliated with the Catholic
hospitals to provide abortion and contraception.
</P>
<P>
   ''These proposals, if enacted, would compromise the very essence
of Catholic health care, subordinating the teachings of the Church
to a narrow pro-abortion ideology,'' Mansell said.
</P>
<P>
   Some 7.3 million New Yorkers, or about 40 percent of the state's
population, are Catholic.

<HEADLINE> Research panel largely backs EPA research on future PCB levels  </HEADLINE>
By L. ANNE NEWELL, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   SARATOGA SPRINGS, N.Y. (AP) -- An independent research panel
largely supports Environmental Protection Agency methods to predict
PCB levels in the upper Hudson River.
</P>
<P>
   But two of the seven researchers say the computer-aided models
behind the predictions are seriously flawed in some areas.
</P>
<P>
   Grace Luk -- a civil engineering professor from Ryerson
Polytechnic University in Ontario -- prescribed major revisions,
noting that research on the buildup of PCBs in fish ''is in general
of poor quality.''
</P>
<P>
   The panel's findings were announced Tuesday. The panelists'
reviews are intended to ensure the EPA uses accurate research to
make a final decision -- scheduled for June 2001 -- on how to clean
the Hudson.
</P>
<P>
   That decision could mean GE, which released PCBs, or
polychlorinated biphenyls, into the Hudson decades ago, will have
to dredge polluted sections of the river. PCBs, which were banned
by the federal government in 1977, were used as an insulating
material in electric equipment.
</P>
<P>
   General Electric officials, which could be forced to spend
billions cleaning the Hudson, say the findings emphasize the
criticisms the company has made for months about the EPA's work.
</P>
<P>
   Panel members were asked to grade two sections of EPA research.
Five members found the research on levels and locations of PCBS in
the water was acceptable with minor revisions, while one said it
needed major revisions. Five said the second area of research, on
PCB buildup in fish, was acceptable with minor revisions, while one
said it needed major changes. One member's grades were not included
with the findings.
</P>
<P>
   The criticisms ranged in scope. Ellen Bentzen -- a research
scientist at Trent University's Environmental Modeling Center --
suggested only minor revisions and her complaints were mostly about
spelling errors.
</P>
<P>
   While suggesting only minor changes to the entire report, Per
Larssen, of Sweden's Lund University, stressed the EPA needs to
look at the river as a whole.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think that the models capture the big picture of PCB fate in
the upper Hudson River,'' he wrote. ''The upper parts are not
isolated from the rest of the river, and this needs to be
considered in the 'big picture.'''
</P>
<P>
   The panel's findings are the latest step over how to best clean
the river. The EPA in May released its computer model results,
which predict that PCB levels in fish will still be unacceptable in
two to three decades if no cleansing is undertaken. The
announcement came a week after GE unveiled its own computer model
showing the river is cleansing itself.
</P>
<P>
   The EPA will now review the research and make any necessary
changes, spokeswoman Ann Rychlenski said.
</P>
<P>
   ''We're certainly going to look at what they had to say,'' she
said. ''And if we feel the suggestions are reasonable and
necessary, we will do something about that.''
</P>
<P>
   The revision is tentatively scheduled for release this summer.
</P>
<P>
   Mark Behan, a GE spokesman, said the company was disappointed
the EPA would not guarantee the panel's recommendations would be
included in the new report.
</P>
<P>
   ''The point is for the EPA to make a decision based on the very
best science and if they foreclose opportunities to use the very
best science, they have not served the river or the public,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Rich Schiafo, an environmental associate for Scenic Hudson, was
pleased with the panel's findings. ''I think this is a favorable
review for the EPA,'' he said, adding that his biggest hope is that
the process moves forward.
</P>
<P>
   ''PCBs were banned in 1977 and 23 years later, they're still
here,'' he said. ''This needs to be taken care of. Overall, the EPA
should be commended and proud of what they've done, but they do
need to stay on track.''

<HEADLINE> Mood Bleak at Rover  </HEADLINE>
By IAN PHILLIPS, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONGBRIDGE, England (AP) -- It's mid-afternoon at Britain's
largest car manufacturing plant and a new Rover engine -- probably
one of a dying breed -- lies unattended on an assembly line while
five brooding workers hover around the radio news.
</P>
<P>
   That's how the gray-overalled workers at Longbridge learned BMW
was to offload the loss-making Rover company, one of motoring's
most illustrious names. Convinced they're now on borrowed time,
they expect to also hear soon that their jobs will be axed.
</P>
<P>
   ''The writing was on the wall the day Rover was sold to BMW,''
said one worker, requesting anonymity. ''What does it matter to a
German company if a few thousand of us in England end up on the
scrapheap? Rover should have stayed in our hands.''
</P>
<P>
   Rover actually looks set to revert to British ownership but, at
century-old Longbridge, that's seen as a short stay of execution.
The 3-year-old British venture capital group Alchemy Partners,
hoping to tie up the purchase in April, has no track record in cars
or manufacturing, making its task even more daunting.
</P>
<P>
   If mighty BMW couldn't turn the company around, Rover workers
say, what hope is there for a private equity firm of entrepreneurs
based on the third floor of an office building in London's Covent
Garden?
</P>
<P>
   The vast Longbridge plant -- including 35 miles of test roads
alongside the central England city of Birmingham's green belt --
will be a prime target one day for real estate developers or the
leisure industry, they fear.
</P>
<P>
   BMW bought Rover for $1.28 billion in 1994. But despite heavy
investment, its models have failed to capture the imagination of
buyers. The company lost $3.2 million a day last year.
</P>
<P>
   The German car giant blamed the strong British pound -- which it
called ''a major U.K. manufacturing illness'' -- and uncertainty
whether Britain will join Europe's single currency for its
dwindling exports. The British government, embarrassed after being
caught unaware by the sale, denies its economic policies are to
blame.
</P>
<P>
   Ambitiously, Alchemy hopes to post a profit within three years
and sell the company within seven. It acknowledges that job losses
are inevitable, although BMW says reports that 50,000 jobs will go
in the Birmingham region -- including Rover suppliers -- are
exaggerated.
</P>
<P>
   With demand for Rovers expected to plummet, Longbridge
production targets were slashed by 20 percent this month; the work
week has been cut to four days, and a three-day Easter break may
now be extended to two weeks.
</P>
<P>
   Anxiety has led to outbreaks of violence, with some local BMW
owners reporting attacks on their vehicles. One nearby BMW dealer
had ''Scum'' daubed in red paint across his main showroom.
</P>
<P>
   Under the proposed sale, Rover will become the MG Car Company, a
niche producer of sports cars.
</P>
<P>
   Alchemy will cut costs by outsourcing most components. Whereas
BMW had $2.72 billion earmarked for development of a new range of
cars, Alchemy plans to spend ''tens of millions'' and halve
production to less than 100,000 cars per year.
</P>
<P>
   To counter criticism that it lacks industry expertise, Chris
Woodwark, a former Rolls-Royce boss, will head the company. Brandon
Gough -- formerly involved in the management of accounting and water
companies, as well as Britain's national lottery -- will be
chairman.
</P>
<P>
   The British government still hopes another buyer will launch a
rival bid for Rover, and Birmingham-based millionaire John Hemming
is forming a consortium to try to do just that. But BMW says it is
not seeking other offers, describing its preliminary agreement with
Alchemy as ''exclusive.'' It also plans to sell the lucrative Land
Rover brand to Ford Motor Co.
</P>
<P>
   British Trade and Industry Secretary Stephen Byers said it is
impossible ''to say confidently that (Alchemy) offers a long-term
future for Longbridge.''
</P>
<P>
   Angry unionists are more blunt. Under the terms of the sale,
''Longbridge has no future,'' says Tony Woodley of the Transport
and General Workers' Union.
</P>
<P>
   Tens of thousands of workers are expected to vent their anger at
a march through Birmingham on April 1, and police fear violence.
</P>
<P>
   Marguerita Grimshaw, whose brother works for Land Rover, blames
successive British governments for destroying the country's
manufacturing base. She lived in Yorkshire, north England, during
the coal-mine closures of the 1980s and then moved to the
Birmingham area.
</P>
<P>
   ''This was the heartland of British industry,'' she said. ''But,
slowly, the metal, tool and tire factories were closed down. And
now the car industry is vanishing. We import our coal, cars and
food. Soon, there'll be nothing left that Britain can call its
own.''

<HEADLINE> OPEC Agrees To Boost Oil Production  </HEADLINE>
By BRUCE STANLEY, AP Business Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   VIENNA, Austria (AP) -- OPEC's decision to boost crude oil output
by 6.3 percent offers scant relief for consumers staggered by
skyrocketing prices for gasoline, industry analysts said.
</P>
<P>
   But the Clinton administration, citing Energy Department
research, projected the move would bring down U.S. unleaded
gasoline prices by 11 cents to 18 cents a gallon by late summer.
</P>
<P>
   Ignoring objections from Iran, its second-biggest member, OPEC
announced Wednesday that a majority of its members would increase
production, in a rare departure from the group's usual quest for
unanimity.
</P>
<P>
   Ministers of the 11-nation cartel said that nine members would
begin pumping an additional 1.45 million barrels of oil a day above
their current official output levels. The increase becomes
effective Saturday, after existing production cuts expire.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton called OPEC's decision a ''positive
development.''
</P>
<P>
   ''These increases will help sustain worldwide economic growth
and provide greater balance between oil supply and demand,''
Clinton said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
   However, analysts were guarded about the effect OPEC's move was
likely to have on prices.
</P>
<P>
   ''It does very little to really take the heat out of the
market,'' said Julian Lee of the Center for Global Energy Studies
in London. ''I don't think it will have a big effect. I think what
it will probably do is prevent prices from going up again
significantly.''
</P>
<P>
   That's far less than what the United States and other
oil-importing countries were hoping for.
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton administration had been lobbying for an increase of
2 million to 2.5 million barrels a day in order to trim gasoline
prices, which have soared in the United States from less than $1 a
gallon just over a year ago to an average of almost $1.60 today.
</P>
<P>
   Falah Aljibury, an industry consultant based in Alamo, Calif.,
said the OPEC agreement would knock, at most, ''a few cents'' off
the average price of unleaded gas. ''I'm disappointed,'' he said.
''The market expected more.''
</P>
<P>
   U.S. Energy Secretary Bill Richardson has said it would take
four to six weeks for the additional oil to reach U.S. markets.
Gasoline prices, however, may remain high this summer because
inventories of gasoline are at ''an all-time low,'' Aljibury said.
</P>
<P>
   Refiners may not be able to build up inventories in time for the
peak summer driving season, analysts said.
</P>
<P>
   Under the plan, the nine OPEC members would revert to higher
levels of production that prevailed before April 1, 1999. OPEC
would hold another meeting in Vienna on June 21 to review oil
markets and adjust output if warranted.
</P>
<P>
   Iran refused to endorse the action. Bijan Namdar Zangeneh,
Iran's oil minister, told reporters he believed production should
be increased by less than 1 million barrels a day and objected to
attempts by others to push through an agreement to boost output by
some 1.7 million barrels.
</P>
<P>
   While Zangeneh did not mention other OPEC countries by name,
Saudi Arabia -- urged on by the United States -- had led the drive to
raise output as much as 7 percent from official quotas, or by 1.7
million barrels.
</P>
<P>
   ''Our difference is on principle and not on merely a few
barrels,'' Zangeneh told reporters after the meeting broke up. ''In
my view, OPEC is not an organization to rubber stamp a decision
already made.''
</P>
<P>
   The agreement also excludes Iraq, which never was part of last
year's production cuts that sent prices surging.
</P>
<P>
   Peter Gignoux, head of the petroleum desk at Salomon Smith
Barney in London, said an increase of the size approved by the OPEC
majority might be enough to stabilize prices.
</P>
<P>
   ''You're taking some of the froth off the cappuccino,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   But the decision sends a mixed signal to the marketplace and
probably would not add enough oil to let importers replenish their
inventories, he added.
</P>
<P>
   Because of cheating by OPEC members on the old output ceiling,
the increase amounts only to an estimated 300,000 barrels a day,
analysts said.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think there will be continued pressure on OPEC in the next
six months to increase output further,'' said Lee of the Center for
Global Energy Studies.
</P>
<P>
   In trading before the meeting broke up, contracts for May
delivery of West Texas Intermediate crude fell 70 cents a barrel to
close Tuesday at $27.09 on the New York Mercantile Exchange.
</P>
<P>
   But in after-hours trading, prices started edging higher.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. oil prices tripled to a March 8 peak of $34.37 per barrel
following OPEC's decision last March to slash production.
</P>
<P>
   OPEC members are Algeria, Indonesia, Iran, Iraq, Kuwait, Libya,
Nigeria, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates and
Venezuela.
</P>
<P>
   OPEC pumps more than 26 million barrels of crude each day, or
about 35 percent of the world's supply. Key non-OPEC producers,
such as Mexico and Norway, have said they were watching to see what
OPEC will do before adjusting their own output.

<HEADLINE> Analysts: Xerox May Cut Jobs  </HEADLINE>
By DENISE LAVOIE, AP Business Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   STAMFORD, Conn. (AP) -- Xerox Corp. is expected to announce this
week that it will cut about 5,000 jobs and take a first-quarter
charge of between $500 million and $900 million, analysts said.
</P>
<P>
   The business machines maker continues to struggle with
stepped-up competition and a reorganization of its sales force.
</P>
<P>
   Chief Executive Rick Thoman told analysts in January that the
company would take a first-quarter restructuring charge in the
''hundreds of millions of dollars,'' but less than the $1.1 billion
charge it took in 1998, when it eliminated about 9,000 jobs.
</P>
<P>
   At the time, Thoman said the company would be pursuing
cost-cutting moves, but he did not say how many jobs would be
eliminated.
</P>
<P>
   Jack L. Kelly, managing director at Goldman Sachs, said he
expects that about half of the charge will be to cover the costs of
cutbacks in manufacturing operations, including some possible plant
closings. The remainder will be used to cover the costs of
severance packages for anywhere from 3,000 to 5,000 employees who
could lose their jobs, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ''When they made the cutback in 1998, it was an offensive
cutback because things were going well. I think this one is at
least partly due to the disappointing results they had last year,''
Kelly said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   The company's profits fell 52 percent in the fourth quarter, to
$294 million, or 41 cents per share, compared with $615 million, or
84 cents per share, a year earlier.
</P>
<P>
   Revenues in the quarter fell 6 percent to $5.44 billion from
$5.79 billion a year ago.
</P>
<P>
   The company has said it expects to see another decline in
earnings in the first quarter.
</P>
<P>
   Greg Gieber, an analyst at Brown Brothers Harriman &AMP; Co., said
he expects the charge will be at least $500 million, although the
number of job cuts is still unclear.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think the more important question is, are they going to have
to do another round after this?'' Gieber said.
</P>
<P>
   Xerox spokeswoman Christa Carone said the company will make an
announcement on its restructuring charge within the first quarter,
which ends Friday. She would not comment on either the amount of
the charge or the number of job cuts.
</P>
<P>
   ''We look at those numbers (provided by analysts), and it's
speculation, so our policy is not to comment on speculation,'' she
said.

<HEADLINE> Panel Discusses Biotech Food Labels  </HEADLINE>
By LAURA VOZZELLA, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON (AP) -- Proposed warning labels on genetically modified
foods would needlessly scare the millions of Americans who fill
their shopping carts with the food each week without even realizing
it, food industry leaders say.
</P>
<P>
   ''It looks like the surgeon general's warning on cigarettes,''
Gene Grabowski, spokesman for Grocery Manufacturers of America,
told a gathering at the BIO 2000 convention Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Specifically, Grabowski referred to ''a square warning label''
that would be required on biogenetic foods under a bill introduced
in Congress by Rep. Dennis Kucinich, D-Ohio.
</P>
<P>
   Whether they know it or not, Americans fill their shopping carts
each week with genetically altered foods. Soda, crackers, breakfast
cereals, cheeses and many other products are made with sweeteners,
fats and grains derived from modified crops.
</P>
<P>
   Sixty percent to 70 percent of all processed foods on
supermarket shelves contain some genetically modified ingredient,
Grabowski said.
</P>
<P>
   While some European countries have either banned certain biotech
crops or mandated labeling of biogenetic foods, the federal Food
and Drug Administration has not imposed similar restrictions in the
United States.
</P>
<P>
   Some of those gathered at the Boston convention said they were
worried that the labeling called for under Kucinich's bill could
deter people from buying products that the industry claims are
safe.
</P>
<P>
   But Kucinich said big business cannot be trusted to put public
safety above profits.
</P>
<P>
   ''Tobacco companies were telling people for years and years that
there's no problem with tobacco and all of a sudden we found out
differently,'' he said from his office in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   ''In a democracy, people have a right to know and government has
a moral responsibility to ensure the purity and safety of the food
supply,'' Kucinich said. ''We can't abdicate that responsibility to
global corporations whose goals may be limited to profit
orientation.''
</P>
<P>
   No one at the conference spoke in favor of labeling, but some
said that if it comes to pass, they hoped the information would not
be presented as a warning. Several people suggested that since most
processed foods contain genetically altered ingredients, it would
make more sense for non-biogenetic foods to be labeled as such,
just as organic foods are today.
</P>
<P>
   Whether or not they prevail in Congress, biotech advocates said
the folks they really have to win over are consumers. Unlike
Europeans, Americans on the whole have not voiced strong opposition
to genetically altered foods.
</P>
<P>
   But they expressed concern that anti-biotech activists, like the
ones who staged colorful street protests outside the Boston
convention this week, might make headway with the public.
</P>
<P>
   Susan Harlander, vice president for biotechnology development
and agriculture at Pillsbury Co., told convention participants to
use ''your own, small sphere of influence'' to spread the word
about the benefits of biotech.
</P>
<P>
   ''Talk to your own child's class. ... Talk to your mother,'' she
said. ''Only one side is out there now.''

<HEADLINE> Casual Dress Is Causing Confusion  </HEADLINE>
By RACHEL BECK, AP Business Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Dressing casual at work was supposed to make
life easier.
</P>
<P>
   But now, confusion is rampant across corporate America, with
some stodgy types thinking casual means taking off your suit
jacket, while others show up to the office in ratty T-shirts or
baring their bellybuttons.
</P>
<P>
   The situation has gotten nerves so jangled that some businesses
are hiring consultants to help people figure out what is
appropriate for work -- and what is better left at home.
</P>
<P>
   One law firm has even teamed up with Polo Ralph Lauren and
Esquire magazine to hold a ''business casual'' seminar for its
attorneys next week.
</P>
<P>
   ''There is a lot of casual confusion out there, people showing
up at work in outfits that they wash their cars or walk their dogs
in,'' said Sherry Maysonave, author of ''Casual Power: How to Power
Up Your Nonverbal Communication and Dress Down for Success.''
</P>
<P>
   ''Companies are realizing that it isn't so easy to go casual, in
fact it can cause some headaches.''
</P>
<P>
   Casual dress has long been the norm for those working in the
high-tech sector, but it began creeping into mainstream corporate
culture in the early 1990s.
</P>
<P>
   At first, companies allowed employees to ditch their suits and
ties on Fridays during the summer. That was soon extended to
Fridays throughout the year, and eventually was permitted everyday
during the summer.
</P>
<P>
   Now, lots of big companies -- including most Wall Street
powerhouses such as Morgan Stanley Dean Witter and blue-chip giants
like Coca-Cola -- are dressing down year-round.
</P>
<P>
   Many want to keep pace with the oh-so-casual dot-com companies
that they do business with -- and with whom they compete for
employees.
</P>
<P>
   According to a 1999 survey of about 750 corporate benefit
executives by the Society for Human Resource Management, 42 percent
said that their companies had casual dress every day, up from 36
percent in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   Fifty-one percent of companies with more than 5,000 workers are
casual five days a week, according to the Alexandria, Va.-based
trade group.
</P>
<P>
   But shifting into casual mode doesn't come easy for many people,
and companies are learning that everyone interprets the new rules
differently.
</P>
<P>
   That's what happened at Development Counsellors International, a
New York-based marketing firm with 25 employes that went casual
year-round in 1998. While most of its staff stuck to appropriate
wears, some did come to work in gym clothes and without bras.
</P>
<P>
   The company now has a detailed list of what workers can or can't
wear to work. Button-down shirts and dress sandals are in; bare
midriffs and beach attire are out.
</P>
<P>
   Those who break the rules risk getting casual dress revoked for
the entire company.
</P>
<P>
   ''It took more time to come up with this policy than anyone
would have thought,'' said Rob DeRocker, executive vice president
at DCI. ''We never thought it would be so complicated.''
</P>
<P>
   That's why many companies are hiring consultants to develop and
enforce casual dress codes. They hold seminars on proper dress and
can trouble shoot when necessary, like telling employees that wet
hair and short skirts are a no-no.
</P>
<P>
   ''One company asked me to try to help them with a little
problem. One girl was wearing thong underwear and for some reason
everyone knew'' because her clothes were too tight and skimpy, said
Myra McElhaney, president of the Atlanta-based consulting firm
McElhaney &AMP; Associates.
</P>
<P>
   Instead of talking to the young woman individually, McElhaney
held a group discussion on what is appropriate work attire and
pointed out that the way one dresses has a great influence on how
they are judged in the workplace.
</P>
<P>
   ''I reminded them that they didn't want to be remembered by
their co-workers for their underwear,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Law firm Cadwalader, Wickersham &AMP; Taft is turning to design
house Polo Ralph Lauren and the men's magazine Esquire for help.
The firm went totally casual on March 6, and next Tuesday will
offer its workers a one-night seminar at Polo's flagship store in
New York.
</P>
<P>
   Under its policy, men have to wear shirts with collars and
buttons, and socks are a must. No jeans, no sneakers, and for
women, halters and tanktops are out. Everyone must keep a suit on
hand in case they have to go to court or meet with a client that
doesn't dress casually.
</P>
<P>
   While Cadwalader hasn't run into too many rule-breakers in its
switch to casual, it wants to give its attorneys the opportunity to
learn how to put together a wardrobe far different from what they
have known.
</P>
<P>
   ''Before this, I knew the suits, ties and shirts I had and what
worked together,'' said Jason Cohen, a 29-year-old lawyer at the
firm. ''Now, I'd like someone to show me the spectrum of what
business casual means ... to see what the options really are.''

<HEADLINE> Texas Tornado Kills Four  </HEADLINE>
By STEPHEN HAWKINS, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   FORT WORTH, Texas (AP) -- Two tornadoes carved paths of
destruction through the Fort Worth area on Tuesday, shattering
windows in high-rise buildings, overturning cars and uprooting
trees. At least four people were killed and 48 injured.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's somewhat of a miracle that there aren't more injuries,''
said Mayor Kenneth Barr.
</P>
<P>
   The manager of a popular restaurant on the top floor of the
35-story Bank One building said his business was destroyed.
</P>
<P>
   ''Imagine a large bomb going off,'' Sean Finley said. ''It got
pretty hectic in here.''
</P>
<P>
   Patrons and employees had to go down 35 flights of stairs to
safety, he said.
</P>
<P>
   The tornado hit shortly after 6:30 p.m. amid severe
thunderstorms that were accompanied by torrential rains,
softball-sized hail and strong winds.
</P>
<P>
   Based on reports from tornado spotters, Fire Chief Larry
McMillen said the storm spawned two tornadoes. One took a northerly
route, while the second moved southeast through downtown.
</P>
<P>
   Two people died in the tornadoes and two others died in
storm-related flooding, said Lt. Kent Worley, a spokesman for the
Fort Worth Fire Department.
</P>
<P>
   ''We have a number of high-rise buildings that have sustained
heavy damage,'' Worley said. ''They looked like they did not have a
single pane of glass left in them.''
</P>
<P>
   At the downtown Renaissance Worthington Hotel, windows were
broken out in about 12 guest rooms and in the public area, manager
Bob Jameson said.
</P>
<P>
   Robert and Wendi Sparlins were eating dinner downtown to
celebrate their second anniversary on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   ''The windows starting popping, people were running trying to
get under the table,'' Robert Sparlins said. ''I saw a chair in the
straight line winds going down the street.''
</P>
<P>
   Katrina Weston of Arlington, just east of Fort Worth, told
WFAA-TV that when she opened the door of her house, she saw the
storm blowing shingles off her roof.
</P>
<P>
   ''We have no back fence at all, it literally wiped paint off the
back of the house,'' she said. ''There are sirens everywhere and we
have no power.''
</P>
<P>
   One side of the Calvary Cathedral International suffered major
damage. Pastor Bob Nichols said his damaged church looks like it
had been ''in a war zone.''
</P>
<P>
   ''We just know God's going to bring us out stronger,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Numerous power outages were reported by TXU Electric and Gas in
western, northern and central parts of the city.
</P>
<P>
   The storms delayed some flights at Dallas-Fort Worth
International Airport.
</P>
<P>
   ''As a precaution, we evacuated the passengers in the Delta
terminal to the tunnels,'' said Harmony Sockman, a spokeswoman for
Delta Air Lines in Atlanta. ''When everything was safe, we brought
everyone back up to the terminal.''
</P>
<P>
   In South Texas, funnel clouds were reported near Dripping
Springs but there were no reports of damage. Marble-sized hail was
reported in downtown San Antonio.

<HEADLINE> UC Research Boat Sinks, Killing 3  </HEADLINE>
By BEN FOX, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   BAHIA DE LOS ANGELES, Mexico (AP) -- A boat carrying nine college
researchers studying spiders and scorpions sank off the coast of
Baja California in rough seas, killing three people and prompting
an international search for two others.
</P>
<P>
   Four survivors clung to the side of the overturned boat for two

65-degree water before reaching land Monday.

Davis, students and scholars overturned Monday afternoon when
strong winds churned up 4- to 6-foot waves, survivors said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   The researchers had been returning to Bahia de Los Angeles, a
remote bay on the Gulf of California about 300 miles south of the
U.S.-Mexico border, after spending Monday morning on a research
expedition to Isla Cabeza de Caballo, about four miles from here.
</P>
<P>
   Thirty mph winds caused the boat to fill with water and capsize,
survivors said.
</P>
<P>
   ''It all happened within a couple of minutes. There was a big
wave every two minutes that just pounded us,'' said Gary Huxel, 38,
a post-doctorate researcher in ecology.
</P>
<P>
   After hanging on for a couple of hours, the waves forced Huxel
and three others to swim off with life jackets or seat cushions, he
said. They became separated during the next several hours, Huxel
ending up on one island, the rest on another.
</P>
<P>
   ''The water was so strong we couldn't stay together.''
</P>
<P>
   The students spent the night on those islands before being
rescued by Mexican authorities Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to Huxel, survivors included UC Davis students Sarah
Ratay, Becca Lewison and Ralph Haygood.
</P>
<P>
   The bodies of graduate student Mike Rose and a visiting Japanese
scholar were recovered Tuesday, according to UC Davis. The third
victim was not identified.
</P>
<P>
   Among the missing was Gary Polis, chairman of the university's
Department of Environmental Science and Policy and one of the
world's leading experts on scorpions and spiders, said Paul
Sabatier, the department's vice chair.
</P>
<P>
   Huxel said when he was forced to abandon the overturned boat,
Polis was still hanging on to it.
</P>
<P>
   Two Mexican naval ships, a helicopter and a plane searched the
region Tuesday under clear skies before suspending the search at
nightfall.
</P>
<P>
   The Coast Guard sent a Jayhawk H-60 helicopter to assist after
receiving permission from the Mexican Navy, Lt. Cmdr. Jeff
Robertson said. A C-130 plane sent by the Coast Guard had to turn
back when it proved too large to land at the airstrip.
</P>
<P>
   The helicopter searched the region Tuesday afternoon and the
Coast Guard planned to send another plane to help Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Coast Guard spokeswoman Shannon Knight said rescue crews would
conduct a first light search Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Located in a rugged, desert landscape, Bahia de Los Angeles is a
tiny collection of hotels and tourist campgrounds that is a popular
destination for sports fishermen, kayakers and wildlife biologists.

<HEADLINE> Connecticut lobstermen join effort to investigate lobster dieoff  </HEADLINE>
By DENISE LAVOIE, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   STAMFORD, Conn. (AP) -- Connecticut lobstermen will participate
in independent testing to help determine what has been killing
millions of lobsters in Long Island Sound.
</P>
<P>
   Beginning next week, five lobstermen's groups will collect dead
lobsters and sediment in the western Sound waters, between Norwalk
and Glen Cove, N.Y. The samples will be sent to a laboratory in
Fairfax, Va., where they will be tested.
</P>
<P>
   The testing, expected to cost from $75,000 to $100,000, will be
funded by FISH Unlimited Inc., a Shelter Island, N.Y.-based
fisheries conservation group with 14,000 members nationwide.
</P>
<P>
   ''In Western Long Island Sound, there are no more lobsters ...
these guys are completely wiped out,'' said Bill Smith, executive
director of FISH Unlimited.
</P>
<P>
   Many lobstermen in the Sound reported death rates of 50 percent
or more last fall.
</P>
<P>
   Michael Horvath, president of the Western Connecticut
Lobstermen's Association, said he is planning to sell his business
because of the financial losses he has suffered from the lobster
dieoff.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is taking out the fishermen,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ''There is no stock out there. It is completely devastated, and
now we're in debt and we've got nowhere to go.''
</P>
<P>
   In November, the Connecticut Department of Environmental
Protection said preliminary tests indicated that a tiny parasite
known as paramoeba may be to blame for the lobster deaths.
</P>
<P>
   But Smith said his group believes the dieoff may have been
caused by contaminated dredge material that was dumped into Western
Long Island Sound last fall from Mamaroneck Harbor, N.Y. The
material contained pesticides and other heavy metals, Smith said.
</P>
<P>
   He said that at the same time the material was being dumped in
the Sound, officials in New York and Connecticut were spraying
pesticides to prevent the spread of the West Nile encephalitis
outbreak. He said his group believes that heavy rains from
Hurricane Floyd in September may have washed the pesticides into
the Sound.
</P>
<P>
   Lawmakers from New York and Connecticut have lobbied for money
to help the lobstermen.
</P>
<P>
   Last month, President Clinton asked Congress for $10 million in
aid and for research to determine what is killing off the lobsters.
The Clinton administration named the Sound a Commercial Fishery
Disaster area in January.
</P>
<P>
   The Long Island Sound is the No. 3 lobster market behind Maine
and Massachusetts. Connecticut brings in about 3.5 million pounds a
year, while New York brings in about 8.5 million pounds
</P>
<P>
   Smith said his group expects to have the test results back by
mid-May.
</P>
<P>
   The five groups participating in the sample collection and
testing are: The Long Island Sound Lobstermen's Association, the
Western Long Island Sound Lobstermen's Association, The Connecticut
Lobstermen's Association, The Western Connecticut Lobstermen's
Association and the Westchester Lobstermen's and Dealers
Association.

<HEADLINE> Lawmaker: Two Conn. inmates injured by rubber bullets in Va.prison  </HEADLINE>
By ADAM GORLICK, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   HARTFORD, Conn. (AP) -- A state lawmaker is worried that
Connecticut could be sued by two inmates he says were shipped to a
Virginia prison and shot by a guard with rubber bullets.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Michael Lawlor, D-East Haven, said the Connecticut inmates
were shot while fighting each other Monday night at Wallens Ridge
State Prison in Big Stone Gap, Va.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's the state of Connecticut that's going to have to pay if
they sue,'' Lawlor said.
</P>
<P>
   Connecticut Department of Correction spokeswoman Christina Polce
said her department had been informed of ''an incident in
Virginia,'' but refused to elaborate. Polce said the DOC is
investigating the incident with Virginia corrections officials.
</P>
<P>
   ''They were treated in our infirmary and have been charged with
fighting in prison,'' Traylor said. ''Their injuries certainly were
not life-threatening.''
</P>
<P>
   When a fight broke out between two inmates at about 8 p.m.
Monday, prison guards yelled a warning to them, Traylor said. The
inmates continued to fight and a guard fired a blank warning shot
from a shotgun, he said.
</P>
<P>
   After another verbal warning failed to stop the scuffle, the
inmates were shot in the ''lower extremities'' with so-called
stinger rounds -- hard, rubber balls about 1/3 of an inch in
diameter, Traylor said.
</P>
<P>
   ''The corrections officers acted within our policy and were
completely within procedure,'' Traylor said. ''We are dealing with
adults, and adults know the rules. These adults did not obey the
rules, and they suffered the consequences.''
</P>
<P>
   Traylor said the inmates will be in solitary confinement until
an investigation is completed. He did not say how long that would
take.
</P>
<P>
   Carol Westberg of West Haven said her son Daniel was one of the
wounded inmates. She said two rubber bullets hit him in the back
near his heart. Westberg said her son called her Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   ''Those jerks just fired their 12-gauge shotguns at him,''
Westberg said. ''He was on the floor and didn't get medical
treatment for an hour and a half. I'm afraid he's going to come
home in a body bag.''
</P>
<P>
   Since October, 480 prisoners have been moved to Wallens Ridge.
Gov. John G. Rowland and corrections officials say the transfers
ease overcrowding in Connecticut prisons. They also save money
because the per-inmate cost is lower at the Virginia prison,
administration officials say.
</P>
<P>
   Connecticut's contract with Virginia allows 500 inmates to be
housed at Wallens Ridge for $11 million a year.
</P>
<P>
   Some lawmakers have accused guards at the Virginia prison of
racial intolerance, and the FBI is investigating allegations of
abuse made by New Mexico inmates who were shipped to the prison.
</P>
<P>
   Prisoner advocates and friends and family members of the inmates
call the transfers unfair.
</P>
<P>
   Lawlor, who says prison overcrowding could be eased if the state
put some inmates in treatment facilities instead of prisons, said
the shootings are another reason why the transfers are a bad idea.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is very extraordinary stuff,'' Lawlor said. ''It would
never happen in Connecticut.''
</P>
<P>
   Connecticut DOC guards do not carry guns or other weapons, Polce
said.
</P>
<P>
   If a fight breaks out, supervisory guards are allowed to use a
chemical spray such as Mace to break it up, she said.
</P>
<P>
   ''We know what the standard operating procedure is at Wallens
Ridge, and our inmates are advised about their rules when they get
there,'' Polce said.

<HEADLINE> Mall opponents to try again to repeal state aid  </HEADLINE>
By ADAM GORLICK, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   HARTFORD, Conn. (AP) -- Supporters of the proposed New Haven mall
are confident they'll get the votes they need to keep the project
on track.
</P>
<P>
   The House of Representatives was expected to vote today on
whether to repeal $28 million in state funding for the Galleria at
Long Wharf. The same measure was defeated on a 89-59 vote last
year. Rep. Chris DePino, R-New Haven, predicted Tuesday that this
year's attempt would fail by a similar margin.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'd say we could get at least 90 votes,'' DePino said Tuesday
after about 50 construction workers and union leaders gathered in
front of the state Capitol to support funding the project.
</P>
<P>
   Benedict Cozzi, president of New Haven Building Trades, said
lawmakers against the mall should ''stop playing with people's
lives and livelihoods.''
</P>
<P>
   ''Have your vote ... and then it's time to stop stalling,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Proponents of the $500 million dollar mall, slated to be built
at Long Wharf, say it will create about 3,000 construction jobs and
generate more tax dollars for the state and greater New Haven
economies.
</P>
<P>
   ''The Galleria will give people a chance to work, and that's a
great gift,'' said Rep. John Martinez, D-New Haven. Martinez said
the mall would generate about $7 million in taxes for New Haven.
</P>
<P>
   Mall opponents say it will hurt business in downtown New Haven
and surrounding communities.
</P>
<P>
   They also argue that the mall, which is to be built near the
intersection of Interstates 95 and 91, will create traffic and
pollution problems.
</P>
<P>
   Westfield America, the corporate owner of malls in Waterford,
Milford, Trumbull, Meriden and Enfield, has lobbied to repeal the
state funding.
</P>
<P>
   ''The New Haven mall would have a negative effect on everything
around it,'' said Rep. Raymond Collins, R-West Haven. ''If a
private enterprise wanted to pay for it, that's fine. But we
shouldn't use public money to pay for it.''

   PORTLAND, Ore. (AP) -- San Antonio Spurs center David Robinson
was ejected with 3:16 left in Tuesday night's game against the
Portland Trail Blazers for heatedly arguing with the officials over
a foul.
</P>
<P>
   Robinson was called for an offensive foul by referee Bennie
Adams with the Spurs trailing 82-75.
</P>
<P>
   Robinson fumed and shouted at Adams and was assessed a

<HEADLINE> 2 state Senate special elections draw interest  </HEADLINE>
By KATHERINE ROTH, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- In special elections in Queens and upstate, a
real estate developer who had the ballot lines of four different
parties and a Buffalo city councilman have been elected state
senators.
</P>
<P>
   In the 10th Senate District in Queens, Democrat Malcolm Smith,
who also had the Republican, Conservative and Working Families
Party lines, soundly defeated former state Sen. Andrew Jenkins on
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Jenkins, a Democrat who was thrown out of office after being
convicted in a money laundering scandal, was trying a political
comeback as the Liberal Party candidate.
</P>
<P>
   Smith took home a whopping 90 percent of the votes, with 7
percent going to Jenkins and the remaining 3 percent going to
Gerard Borriello, a Right to Life candidate.
</P>
<P>
   In the 57th Senate District, covering parts of Erie and Niagara
counties, Democrat Alfred Coppola, a Buffalo city councilman,
defeated Democrat Renae Kimble, a former majority leader of the
Niagara County Legislature running on the GOP ballot.
</P>
<P>
   With 96 percent of the votes counted, Coppola had 70 percent of
the votes to Kimble's 26 percent, with the remaining 4 percent
going to Anthony Murtle, a Right to Life candidate.
</P>
<P>
   The outcome of the special elections in the heavily Democratic
districts does not affect control of the 61-member state Senate, in
which Republicans already held 36 seats going into the elections.
</P>
<P>
   In the 10th Senate District, the Smith-Jenkins showdown was set
up by the resignation of Democrat Alton Waldon Jr., a former
congressman nominated for a seat on the state Court of Claims by
Gov. George Pataki. Eighty percent of voters in the district are
Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   Jenkins, 58, is an administrator at York College who served a
year in prison after being convicted in a money laundering scandal
involving a bank in Zaire. With his 1990 conviction, Jenkins was
expelled from the Senate, where he had served for eight years. He
had been in the state Assembly for four years before that.
</P>
<P>
   Smith, 43, ran unsuccessfully for the state Senate seat in 1990
after Jenkins' expulsion and failed in a bid for the New York City
Council the following year. Smith was a top aide to the Rev. Floyd
Flake when the Queens Democrat served in Congress.
</P>
<P>
   Both Smith and Jenkins are black, as are two-thirds of the
district's residents.
</P>
<P>
   In the 57th Senate District, the vacancy came about because of
the election of Democrat Anthony Nanula as Buffalo city
comptroller. Seventy percent of voters there are Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   Democrat Coppola, 58, has held a seat on Buffalo's common
council since 1983 and had run unsuccessfully in the past for both
the state Senate and Assembly. In Tuesday's special election, he
had the Democratic, Independence, Conservative, Working Families
and Green Party ballot lines.
</P>
<P>
   Democrat Kimble, 46, is a Niagara County legislator who ran on
the Republican line after GOP officials were unable to come up with
one of their own to take on Coppola. There is also a political feud
between Democratic Party leaders in Erie and Niagara counties.
</P>
<P>
   Kimble, a law school graduate, is the former director of the
Niagara County Human Rights Commission. By joining with the
Senate's GOP majority, Kimble said she could bring more services
back to the district.

<HEADLINE> Mavericks 112, Clippers 102  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Michael Finley recorded his fourth
triple-double of the season and fifth of his career with 20 points,
12 rebounds and 10 assists Tuesday night as the Dallas Mavericks
beat the Los Angeles Clippers 112-102 for their fourth straight
road victory.
</P>
<P>
   Hubert Davis finished with 15 points, including three 3-pointers
in a 2:05 span of the fourth quarter to break open a tie game, and
Greg Buckner made five of six free throws in the final minute,
helping send the Clippers to their eighth straight loss.
</P>
<P>
   Dirk Nowitzki added 20 points for the Mavericks, who had 13
3-pointers in the game -- the ninth time this season they have made
at least 10 from behind the arc. They also went 17-for-18 from the
foul line.
</P>
<P>
   Eric Piatkowski scored 28 points and second-year center Michael
Olowokandi added a career-high 27 points for the Clippers, who have
lost eight straight and 36 of their last 40. It was Olowokandi's
fourth game with at least 20 points this season and his second in a
row.
</P>
<P>
   One night after beating the Midwest Division-leading Jazz at
Utah for the first time in more than 11 years, the Mavericks blew a
seven-point lead during a one-minute span of the fourth quarter
against the NBA's worst team. The Clippers rallied to tie it at 87
on Olowokandi's two free throws, a dunk by Derek Anderson off an
offensive rebound, and a 3-pointer by Piatkowski with 7:16
remaining.
</P>
<P>
   But the Mavericks responded with a 3-pointer by Davis, two free
throws by Nowitski and another trey by Davis.
</P>
<P>
   The Clippers lost their sixth straight game against Dallas,
missing leading scorer Maurice Taylor for the fourth straight game
with a sprained left ankle and second-leading scorer Lamar Odom for
the second straight game because of a strained left calf muscle.
</P>
<P>
   Olowokandi paced the Clippers to a 55-51 halftime lead with 19
points. The Mavericks built a 32-25 advantage through one quarter
with six 3-pointers -- two of them by the 6-foot-11 Nowitzki, who
made four in the contest and needs only three more to become the
seventh player in Mavericks history with at least 100 3-pointers in
a season.
</P>
<P>
Notes: With 14 victories, the Clippers have to go 4-6 the rest of
the way to avoid tying the mark for the second-fewest wins during a
full season in franchise history. They had 17 in four of the
previous 18 seasons, and just 12 in 1986-87 under Don Chaney. Their
nine wins last season came during a lockout-shortened 50-game
schedule. ... Los Angeles waived guard Troy Hudson and signed
forward Etdrick Bohannon to a 10-day contract. ... The Mavericks
are 5-11 in the second game of back-to-back sets -- but the second
game has been on the road all 16 times. They finally get a chance
to conclude a back-to-back set at home on April 14 against Seattle.
... The Clippers, who lost to the Mavericks on Feb. 5 in Jim Todd's
first game after replacing Chris Ford as head coach, are 3-24 since
the change.

<HEADLINE> Oscars, 'Millionaire' Help ABC  </HEADLINE>
By DAVID BAUDER, AP Television Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- ABC's winning streak in the ratings stands at 13
weeks, thanks to the Academy Awards and its companion shows.
</P>
<P>
   The Oscars, traditionally the year's top-rated entertainment
special, drew 46.3 million viewers Sunday night, a slight increase
over last year. The half-hour ''Countdown to Oscar 2000'' special
preceding it had 30 million people tuning in to see what the stars
were wearing, Nielsen Media Research said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Barbara Walters' Oscar-themed interview special at 7 p.m. Sunday
was watched by 18.1 million people and was one of the rare shows to
ever outrate ''60 Minutes'' in its time slot.
</P>
<P>
   Even Regis Philbin got into the Oscar act. The movie-themed
''Who Wants to Be a Millionaire'' special last Friday drew nearly
22 million people. While below the game show's typical viewership,
it was enough to finish among the week's 10 most popular programs.
</P>
<P>
   It was another big week for networks to try out new shows. Fox
was encouraged by the premiere of ''Titus,'' a comedy seen by 14.1
million people.
</P>
<P>
   In NBC's trial of two new shows on Thursday night, ''Daddio''
performed far better than ''Battery Park.'' ''Daddio'' lost 2
million viewers from its lead-in, ''Friends,'' while ''Battery
Park'' lost more than 5 million from its predecessor, ''Frasier.''
</P>
<P>
   ABC's limited-run series on a pre-fab singing group, ''Making
the Band,'' drew 11.5 million viewers on Friday. But that meant
roughly half the audience from its preceding show, ''Millionaire,''
either changed the channel or turned off the TV.
</P>
<P>
   ABC had an average of 17.6 million viewers in prime-time last
week (11.8 rating, 20 share). NBC was second with 11.1 million
viewers (7.9, 13), narrowly beating CBS's 11 million viewers (7.8,
13).
</P>
<P>
   Fox had 7.9 million viewers (5.2 rating, 8 share), UPN had 4
million (2.8 rating, 4 share), the WB had 3.1 million viewers (2.3,
4) and Pax-TV had 1.1 million viewers (0.8, 1).
</P>
<P>
   On a rare week when the three evening news anchors traveled
overseas, NBC's ''Nightly News'' won a narrow victory with 10.1
million viewers (7.6 rating, 16 share). ABC's ''World News
Tonight'' had 10 million viewers (7.5, 16), while the ''CBS Evening
News'' had 8.1 million viewers (6.3, 13).
</P>
<P>
   A rating point represents 1,008,000 households, or 1 percent of
the nation's estimated 100.8 million TV homes. The share is the
percentage of in-use televisions tuned to a given show.
</P>
<P>
   For the week of March 20-26, the top 10 shows, their networks
and ratings were ''Academy Awards,'' ABC, 29.2; ''Countdown to
Oscars,'' ABC, 20.6; ''Who Wants to Be a Millionaire'' (Tuesday),
ABC, 19.5; ''ER,'' NBC, 18.3; ''Who Wants to Be a Millionaire''
(Thursday), ABC, 17.3; ''Who Wants to Be a Millionaire'' (Friday),
ABC, 14.4; ''Friends,'' NBC, 14.3; ''Frasier,'' NBC, 13.7;
''Daddio,'' NBC, 13.5; ''Law and Order,'' NBC, 13.4.

<HEADLINE> Memory Problems After Chemotherapy  </HEADLINE>
By DANIEL Q. HANEY, AP Medical Editor
<TEXT>
<P>
   TAMPA, Fla. (AP) -- Ordinary doses of chemotherapy sometimes
appear to leave patients with poor memories, muddy thinking and
inability to do math in their heads, new research suggests.
</P>
<P>
   Cancer patients often complain of ''chemobrain'' during
treatment. While they are typically reassured this will go away,
little attempt has been made until now to see if these subtle
problems linger years later.
</P>
<P>
   The new study, conducted at Dartmouth Medical School, found that
people who get standard chemotherapy appear to be about twice as
likely as other cancer patients to score poorly on various
intelligence tests an average of 10 years after their treatment.
</P>
<P>
   Doctors say the findings suggest that aggressive treatment with
chemotherapy may be unwise in some people with early-stage cancer
unless the drugs can substantially improve chances of survival.
</P>
<P>
   Tim Ahles, a psychologist, presented the results Tuesday at a
meeting in Tampa of the American Cancer Society. He said that while
his is one of the first formal studies of the problem, the results
are unlikely to surprise many cancer patients.
</P>
<P>
   Ahles said that when he spoke recently about the findings at a
meeting of cancer survivors, he worried his discouraging news would
upset the audience. Instead, they seemed relieved that scientists
were finally taking seriously a complaint they had made for years.
</P>
<P>
   He said that many years after treatment, some cancer survivors
say they still have trouble remembering and concentrating. Some say
they need a calculator for math problems they once could have
solved in their heads. Others have to read a page twice to absorb
what's being said.
</P>
<P>
   ''In talking to someone, you'd never notice this,'' Ahles said.
''But it is very relevant to them.''
</P>
<P>
   Ahles noted that lots of things during chemotherapy can make
people feel unfocused. Often they are anemic, sick from the
chemotherapy and sleepy from anti-nausea medicines. But
intellectual ability gradually comes back as they recover.
</P>
<P>
   ''The question is whether it returns to pretreatment levels,''
he said. ''The inference from our data is that for a subgroup of
patients, it does not.''
</P>
<P>
   In his study, Ahles tested 71 patients who were cancer-free
after getting chemotherapy an average of 10 years earlier for
breast cancer or lymphoma. They were compared with 58 who had been
treated with radiation or surgery alone.
</P>
<P>
   Overall, the chemotherapy patients scored significantly worse,
though most were still thinking clearly.
</P>
<P>
   However, between one-quarter and one-third of those who got
chemotherapy scored near the bottom in at least four of the nine
areas of intellectual ability that the researchers measured. Only
half as many of the patients who got surgery or radiation alone did
this badly.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. William Wood of Emory University in Atlanta noted that
patients with early-stage cancer often opt for aggressive
chemotherapy, even though statistically it offers only a percentage
point or two improvement in survival.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is may give second thoughts to people who really would
not get much benefit'' from chemotherapy, Wood said.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier studies have found a chance of lingering intellectual
problems in people who receive high-dose chemotherapy, such as
those undergoing bone marrow transplants. Doctors treating children
with leukemia have also successfully turned to less toxic doses
after finding the drugs cause learning problems.

<HEADLINE> Neanderthal, Modern Man DNA Differ  </HEADLINE>
By JEFF DONN, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   Researchers say DNA extracted from a 29,000-year-old bone has
cast doubt on the theory that modern humans evolved in part from
squat, heavy-browed Neanderthals.
</P>
<P>
   Researchers compared DNA from a Neanderthal skeleton found in
Russia to an older sample tested in 1997. While the two Neanderthal
samples turned out to be just 3.5 percent different from one
another, they were roughly 7 percent different from DNA in modern
humans.
</P>
<P>
   Scientists consider that to be a substantial gap.
</P>
<P>
   ''It all points away from the Neanderthal,'' said one of the
researchers, William Goodwin, a molecular biologist at the Human
Identification Center in Glasgow, Scotland.
</P>
<P>
   The findings are being published in Thursday's issue of the
journal Nature.
</P>
<P>
   The researchers challenge the theory that modern humans evolved
at least partly from Neanderthals, which some believe mated in
large numbers with modern Europeans before disappearing 25,00 0
years ago.
</P>
<P>
   If that had happened, some argue, today's Europeans would show
stronger genetic similarities to Neanderthals than other humans do.
Yet the latest DNA analysis shows Neanderthal DNA to be no closer
to Europeans than to other modern humans.
</P>
<P>
   Neanderthals were burly, primitive creatures with a prominent
brow, thick jaw and short, powerful limbs. Originating in Africa,
they appeared in Europe and Asia perhaps 100,000 years ago or
longer.
</P>
<P>
   The 29,000-year-old Neanderthal DNA, which was recovered from a
rib bone in a baby's skeleton found in Russia's Caucasus Mountains,
was in better condition than the roughly 40,000-year-old
Neanderthal DNA from Germany analyzed in 1997, the researchers
said.
</P>
<P>
   The research team from Scotland, Sweden, Russia and the United
States reassembled more than 2 percent of the later Neanderthal DNA
from a tiny cellular structure known as the mitochondria.
</P>
<P>
   Molecular biologist Matthias Hoss, an expert in ancient remains
now working at the Swiss Institute for Cancer Research, said the
research appears to support the theory that Neanderthals were an
evolutionary dead end.
</P>
<P>
   ''This adds quite a lot of confidence that the Neanderthal
didn't contribute to modern populations,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The study does support an opposing theory known as
''out-of-Africa,'' the research team said. This theory says modern
humans descended from the true Homo sapiens, who originated in
Africa and came to replace other early humans worldwide without
great mixing. Homo sapiens would have arrived in Europe perhaps
30,000 to 40,000 years ago, scientists believe.
</P>
<P>
   However, some experts question the researchers' broader
conclusions, saying mitochondrial DNA may evolve faster than the
researchers assume.
</P>
<P>
   ''Maybe 40,000 years ago, everybody's mitochondrial DNA is very
different from humans of today,'' said Fred H. Smith, an
anthropologist at Northern Illinois University.
</P>
<P>
   Milford Wolpoff, a University of Michigan anthropologist who
studies early human fossils, said fossils suggest an evolutionary
link between Neanderthals and modern humans. He said late
Neanderthal fossils seem to be evolving toward modern humans in
some ways, as they develop chins and lose their low, sloping
foreheads.

<HEADLINE> Columbine Report To Be Edited  </HEADLINE>
By JON SARCHE, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   DENVER (AP) -- After consulting with victims' families,
authorities have decided to release only an edited report on the
Columbine High School shooting rampage in late May.
</P>
<P>
   Jefferson County sheriff's officials want to minimize additional
trauma for the families by editing out graphic details. They also
want to avoid releasing the report around the April 20 anniversary
of the attack.
</P>
<P>
   The report will be issued on CD-ROM, with about 200 pages of
text, and video and audio data, Undersheriff John Dunaway said
Monday. It has not yet been completely assembled.
</P>
<P>
   The public report will exclude grisly details and information
about the continuing investigation, Dunaway said.
</P>
<P>
   Tom Mauser, whose son Daniel was killed, said he favors the
exclusion of some details.
</P>
<P>
   ''We, as parents, had the opportunity to sit down with
investigators months ago and went through any amount of detail that
we wanted to go through,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ''Certainly some of those details, including a picture of my
dead son on the library floor, I would not want released to the
public. I saw and heard some things that were just very
difficult.''
</P>
<P>
   But some victims' families were upset that the department plans
to withhold some of the details from the public.
</P>
<P>
   ''I want the full version,'' Angela Sanders, daughter of slain
teacher Dave Sanders, said in Tuesday's Denver Rocky Mountain News.
</P>
<P>
   Teen-agers Eric Harris and Dylan Klebold stormed Columbine last
April, killing 12 students and Sanders and wounding about two dozen
others before committing suicide.
</P>
<P>
   Dunaway said authorities have no evidence suggesting anyone
other than Harris and Klebold was involved, but have kept the probe
open to ''preserve the ability to prosecute such an individual or
individuals.''
</P>
<P>
   The sheriff's department has been criticized by victims'
families in the past, when Sheriff John Stone allowed a magazine
reporter to see videotapes made by the gunmen before the family
members viewed them.
</P>
<P>
   An article about the videos was published shortly before the
Christmas holidays, causing fresh grief for the victims' families.

<HEADLINE> Depression Pill Used Vs Hot Flashes  </HEADLINE>
By DANIEL Q. HANEY, AP Medical Editor
<TEXT>
<P>
   TAMPA, Fla. (AP) -- Antidepressants may also help ease the misery
of hot flashes, according a small study that suggests Paxil
relieves the effects of estrogen withdrawal in women being treated
for breast cancer.
</P>
<P>
   Estrogen pills are the standard medicine for the hot flashes,
mood swings and night sweats of menopause, but they are often not
recommended for women at high risk of breast cancer.
</P>
<P>
   Women who are already on estrogen are typically told to stop
taking the hormone after a diagnosis of breast cancer.
</P>
<P>
   Cancer treatment can itself trigger menopause in younger women.
Doctors say about half of breast cancer patients complain of hot
flashes, the sudden spike of temperature that makes them break into
a sweat and want to pull off their clothing.
</P>
<P>
   At Georgetown University Medical Center in Washington, doctors
noticed that the problem sometimes seems to ease when women go on
antidepressants called selective serotonin-reuptake inhibitors. In
a pilot study, they gave Paxil, one brand of these prescription
drugs, to 30 women.
</P>
<P>
   They started out at 10 milligrams daily for one week, then upped
the dose to 20 milligrams a day for four weeks. On the pills, the
frequency of hot flashes fell by two-thirds and their intensity
eased by three-quarters. Afterward, 25 of the women chose to
continue taking Paxil.
</P>
<P>
   ''Women can tell fairly quickly whether this drug will work for
them,'' Dr. Vered Stearns said at an American Cancer Society
meeting in Tampa. ''The women called and thanked me.''
</P>
<P>
   She said a larger study will start soon to see how Paxil
compares to dummy pills. This study will also enroll women who are
going through menopause but don't have cancer. In other studies,
about one-third of women report improvement when taking placebos.
</P>
<P>
   Typically hot flashes and other symptoms ease after six months
or so and go away completely after two to six years, though some
women may suffer them much longer.
</P>
<P>
   Besides estrogen, ''this is the first thing that appears to be
dramatically helpful for hot flashes,'' said Dr. William Wood of
Emory University in Atlanta. ''This is very exciting stuff for a
lot of women.''
</P>
<P>
   Early data from other studies testing drugs similar to Paxil,
such as Prozac and Effexor, suggest they also may ease hot flashes.

<HEADLINE> Wells, Water Sources Running Dry  </HEADLINE>
By JOHN KELLY, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   PARIS, Ill. (AP) -- In pockets of rural Illinois, families who
rely on wells for the water they need to run businesses, tend the
farm or wash their clothes are finding underground water sources
are dry.
</P>
<P>
   Most of Illinois has gotten less than normal rain since July,
and the National Weather Service suggests drought conditions could
persist here through the summer.
</P>
<P>
   Without rain, lake levels are dropping and underground streams
aren't flowing. Wells, especially shallow ones, are emptying faster
than homeowners can buy water to fill them up.
</P>
<P>
   ''I've been here since 1976, and this is the worst I've ever
seen it,'' said Rick Craig, superintendent of the Paris Water
Plant.
</P>
<P>
   Don Keys is one of those farmers watching the skies over his
family's farm in Edgar County. He's getting ready to plant his 55th
crop and remembers few dry spells like the current one.
</P>
<P>
   ''Usually in the spring around here, you dig post holes for a
fence and the holes would fill up with water,'' Keys said. ''Right
now, there is no water.''
</P>
<P>
   His son, Joe Keys, owns the fertilizer business next door and is
sending a tanker to Paris regularly to buy water -- water he used to
draw from the ground at a pumping station. This is the time of year
when he needs water most, thousands and thousands of gallons of it
to apply fertilizer on his customers' fields.
</P>
<P>
   ''We've got to have water to do business,'' Joe Keys said.
</P>
<P>
   Every neighbor Don and Joe Keys have along County Road 1900
North is hurting for water. But they note having to haul in water
now is far less of a concern than the ominous possibility of
summer-long drought.
</P>
<P>
   ''People just don't realize what a thin line we're on right now,
how close we are to a very precarious position,'' Joe Keys said.
''Everything will be fine if we could just get a good, steady rain.
But we've been saying that since last July.''
</P>
<P>
   Craig, the water plant supervisor, says during a normal, rainy
Illinois March, he would sell 2,000 gallons of water a week at the
plant. He's seen that swell to more than 100,000 gallons in some
recent weeks. Companies that haul water for hire are struggling to
keep up with calls from people with dry wells.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's a losing battle with wells because anything you put into
the well is just going to seep back out right now,'' said Charlie
Dunne of Dunne Water Hauling in Charleston.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the losing battle, Dunne's company is hauling water to
an ever-growing list of customers in a quickly widening service
area. ''You gotta have water,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Dunne normally needs two or three loads of water a year to keep
the well at his own home functioning. Now, he's trucking water
there about once a month. Usually people need a little extra water
in the winter, but it's very unusual to have this many well
problems in late March, Dunne said.
</P>
<P>
   But state climatologist Jim Angel said changes can come suddenly
in Illinois.
</P>
<P>
   ''You know how the weather in Illinois is,'' said Angel, who
works for the Illinois State Water Survey in Champaign. ''One day
we're talking about drought, and the next week we're talking about
flooding. There's always danger in putting too much stock in
forecasts.''

<HEADLINE> Michigan Sand Dunes Disputed  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   HAGAR SHORES, Mich. (AP) -- A legal battle has erupted over plans
to mine 5 million tons of sand from the Lake Michigan shore,
leveling a dune considered a critical part of one of the world's
longest stretches of freshwater sand.
</P>
<P>
   Environmentalists say the 285,000 acres of sand are being
ravaged by strip miners who have removed 46.5 million tons in the
past 25 years. The sand is crucial to the production of auto parts
as cylinder heads, intake manifolds and brake components.
</P>
<P>
   The latest dispute stems from TechniSand Inc.'s plan to mine
more than 70 acres at a site that contains what is designated as a
critical dune. Such dunes are considered unique and fragile
resources, protected by state law.
</P>
<P>
   The protection law contains a key exception: the state can allow
mining of critical dunes on their own property, providing they had
a mining permit before 1989.
</P>
<P>
   The state granted TechniSand a mining permit based on that
provision.
</P>
<P>
   ''We believe our interpretation of the statute is correct and
appropriate,'' said Department of Environmental Quality spokesman
Ken Silfven. ''The land they want to mine is adjacent to a
permitted area where they already mine.''
</P>
<P>
   The permit has been challenged in court by Preserve the Dunes,
an environmental group formed two years ago by Charles Davis and
other neighbors near the site.
</P>
<P>
   ''To me, it was just government gone wrong,'' he said. ''It's
the duty of government to enforce the law.''
</P>
<P>
   Berrien County Circuit Court Chief Judge Paul Malone is expected
to rule in May.
</P>
<P>
   The disputed dune is in Berrien County, in southwestern
Michigan, an area where summer homes and state parks are nestled
among small sand mountains towering as high as 300 feet and wider
than many farm fields.
</P>
<P>
   During two weeks of testimony that ended last week, Preserve the
Dunes said there was no need to continue tearing down dunes,
priceless treasures sculpted by Ice Age glaciers, wind and water.
</P>
<P>
   TechniSand said the even-textured sand remains critical to the
casting of key auto parts, and could fetch between $40 million and
$75 million at $8 to $15 per ton.
</P>
<P>
   ''The auto industry is robust and they're hungry for it,''
mining company vice president Joe Fodo said.
</P>
<P>
   Kalamazoo attorney James Geary, a lawyer for TechniSand, said
U.S. automakers are fortunate to have the source of high-quality
sand. He said foreign automakers resort to costlier measures, such
as dredging the ocean bottom.
</P>
<P>
   Another environmental group, the Chicago-based Lake Michigan
Federation, contends the state is squandering a natural treasure to
provide large, multinational companies with a cheap source of
industrial sand.

<HEADLINE> Activist witnesses, lectures on Bosnian war's aftermath  </HEADLINE>
By JENNIFER JORDAN, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) -- As a Bosnian leader called on America to
donate building supplies to help refugees return home, a
Massachusetts mother of four planned her fourth trip to the Balkan
region to witness families trying to recreate domestic rituals and
community ties.
</P>
<P>
   Long after the Balkans faded from headlines and most minds,
Claire Schaeffer-Duffy, an antiwar activist from Worcester, began
photographing and interviewing survivors about the effects of war.
</P>
<P>
   When homes were destroyed, so were domestic routines that keep a
family running smoothly -- bonding moments like getting children
ready for school, cleaning, eating together.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's what war actually means for most people -- that disruption
of intimate space,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Schaeffer-Duffy travels to Kozarac, where the first major
expelling of Muslims took place in 1992. Thousands of Muslims died.
</P>
<P>
   In three visits, she met with families who had near-mansions
with decks overlooking countrysides who can now claim only
burned-out structures, and who hope for aid to just allow
bare-bones homes. She's seen that change for many people: last
year, 150 homes under construction during a visit.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday, Bosnian presidential adviser Mirza Hajric said tens
of thousands more refugees could go home this year if the
international community did away with bureaucracy that delays
construction help for months.
</P>
<P>
   Most people, Schaeffer-Duffy said in a telephone interview
Tuesday, try to supplement foreign aid with their own funds, but
the ''opportunities for incomes are very limited'' as the region
attempts the transition to peace.
</P>
<P>
   Schaeffer-Duffy went to Bosnia first in May 1998 because she was
moved by the story of a Muslim woman saved by a Serb soldier, and
has focused especially on the role of women in rebuilding the
community. On her next trip, which she hopes to make in May, she
will try to find the soldier who first piqued her interest.
</P>
<P>
   Schaeffer-Duffy shares with college students and other audiences
what she calls ''the small stories'' of war -- images and personal
stories that replace the maps, statistics and politicians of the
conflict with average people trying to remake life.
</P>
<P>
   In one photo, a wrinkled couple smiles, sipping coffee at a
table covered in lace. Behind them is a boarded-up door and a
partially reconstructed home.
</P>
<P>
   In another, a mother holds a T-shirt that reads, ''I will not
raise my child to kill your child.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1998, hundreds of Muslims returned to their pre-war homes in
Kozarac, living side-by-side with their pre-war Serb neighbors.
</P>
<P>
   Most of those who returned were elderly women.
</P>
<P>
   Schaeffer-Duffy said that in her own home, ''There are so many
hours consumed keeping just relative order ... I am fatigued by
what I have to do here. I had empathy for how these women had to
begin again and what they must be thinking.''
</P>
<P>
   Hajric, the Muslim representative of Bosnia's joint presidency
who was in the U.S. to rally support for the refugees and for
economic development, said security has now improved to the point
where refugees could soon go back to their homes in 80 percent of
the country.
</P>
<P>
   On Schaeffer-Duffy's last trip, in October 1999, she saw signs
of that improvement.
</P>
<P>
   ''It was really wonderful -- a school reopened which I would have
said in May wouldn't reopen,'' she said. ''The most memorable sight
to see on the main street is children with backpacks and the place
looking gloriously ordinary.''

<HEADLINE> Clinton Courting Old Foes  </HEADLINE>
By TOM RAUM, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- From North Korea to Iran to Libya, President
Clinton is courting former adversaries, some of them still on the
State Department's terrorism list, as he nears the end of his term
and ponders his legacy.
</P>
<P>
   He is attempting to rehabilitate ties with some of the same
governments and leaders long vilified by the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Some examples:
</P>
<P>
   --Two decades after President Reagan warned that Libyan ''hit
squads'' might invade U.S. cities, the Clinton administration is
considering easing restrictions on American travel to the North
African country and exploring whether its oil might be made
available to U.S. markets again.
</P>
<P>
   --The administration this month lifted a ban on U.S. imports of
Iranian luxury goods and said it would seek a legal settlement that
could free Iranian assets frozen since 1979. Secretary of State
Madeleine Albright invited Iran to enter a ''new relationship''
with the United States.
</P>
<P>
   --Last September, the United States lifted trade, banking and
other sanctions that had been in place against isolationist North
Korea for decades. Former Defense Secretary William Perry has
visited Pyongyang seeking closer ties, and a high-ranking North
Korean official may visit the United States next month.
</P>
<P>
   These three remain on the State Department's list of seven
countries that support or sponsor terrorism. Trade between the
United States and these countries is essentially prohibited. The
others are Syria, Iraq, Cuba and Sudan.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton met with Syrian President Hafez Assad last weekend in
Geneva in an attempt -- fruitless, as it turned out -- to revive
stalled Sryian-Israeli peace talks. And there have been tentative
overtures to Cuba, including an increase in humanitarian aid and
travel by Americans. The administration also supported Cuba's
position that 6-year-old Elian Gonzalez be returned to his father
in Cuba.
</P>
<P>
   So what gives?
</P>
<P>
   ''It's not troubling that he's reaching out. But I want to see
what he's getting for reaching out,'' said Sen. Sam Brownback,
R-Kan., chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations subcommittee on
Near Eastern and South Asian affairs.
</P>
<P>
   Administration supporters counter that the openings come as
either old authoritarian leaders, such as Libya's Moammar Gadhafi,
seem to be mellowing; or where moderates are gaining ground, as in
Iran.
</P>
<P>
   In many cases, Clinton's overtures are following economic
opportunities, his supporters say.
</P>
<P>
   For instance, normalizing trade relations with China could open
vast new markets to U.S. exporters and farmers, they argue. The
president and top members of his administration are working hard to
win congressional support for giving China permanent access to U.S.
markets as a prelude to Beijing's acceptance in the World Trade
Organization.
</P>
<P>
   The intelligence community continues to warn that some of these
nations -- namely North Korea, Iran and Iraq -- pose a growing threat
to the United States. China and Russia already pose such a threat.
</P>
<P>
   Over the next 15 years, U.S. cities could be within range of
ballistic missiles from ''North Korea, probably Iran and possibly
Iraq,'' CIA Director George Tenet has told congressional hearings.
</P>
<P>
   One House Republican leader, Rep. Tom Delay of Texas, complained
earlier this month that Clinton was putting Taiwan at risk with his
''appeasement'' of Beijing, which has stepped up its threats
against the island of late.
</P>
<P>
   But, just as Clinton reached out to political adversaries in
trying to build support for his domestic agenda, he's been reaching
out to foreign leaders -- of all stripes.
</P>
<P>
   ''Like all key moments in human history, this one poses some
hard choices, for this era does not reward people who struggle in
vain to redraw borders with blood. It belongs to those with the
vision to look beyond borders, for partners and commerce and
trade,'' Clinton said in a speech last weekend in military-ruled
Pakistan.
</P>
<P>
   That controversial visit -- some advisers urged him not to go --
was part of an effort by Clinton to persuade Pakistan to return to
democracy.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think that, what is clear is that over the past year the
president has spent more time on foreign policy. I don't know if
that's an attempt to secure a place in history, of if he's just
that he ignored it so long,'' said Stephen Cohen, a former State
Department official and South Asia specialist at the Brookings
Institution.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Americans have no choice other than to try to engage
countries that are developing weapons of mass destruction, said

<HEADLINE> Choate Seeks Reform Party Stability  </HEADLINE>
By LAURIE KELLMAN, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Pat Choate is a bit of a wonk, a highly
educated government type who cares deeply about public policy and
less about the razzmatazz of party politics.
</P>
<P>
   ''Policy! That's what my career is about!'' he declared in 1993.
</P>
<P>
   But as the new Reform Party chairman, Choate (pronounced choht)
finds himself at the center of the nation's most rollicking party
politics and far from his highbrow world of international
economics.
</P>
<P>
   When a federal judge upheld Choate's chairmanship on Monday, he
effectively handed the bearded economist a hefty to-do list:
</P>
<P>
   -- Soothe a party still rife with festering hostilities;
</P>
<P>
   -- Replace images of party leaders wrestling and hollering at a
meeting last month with the notion that the Reform Party is a
credible political force in American politics.
</P>
<P>
   -- Convince Americans to fill its coffers with $1 million by its
August convention.
</P>
<P>
   -- Make the case that Pat Buchanan is a presidential candidate
who can unite the party on the common ground of protectionism,
rather than divide it on social issues -- and win the White House.
</P>
<P>
   -- Poke holes in the credibility of George W. Bush and Al Gore,
the expected Republican and Democratic presidential nominees, who
are calling themselves reformers;
</P>
<P>
   -- Convince an independent commission to let Buchanan participate
in the fall debates.
</P>
<P>
   -- Do it all without pay.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is my civic contribution,'' Choate explained.
</P>
<P>
   It's a tall order for anyone, least of all a scholar, economist,
lecturer, commentator and author of six books.
</P>
<P>
   But Choate is no stranger to Washington or party politics. He
was party founder Ross Perot's running mate in 1996 when the two
got 8 percent of the vote -- enough to secure $15 million in public
funding this year for the party's convention and general election.
</P>
<P>
   Four years earlier, he helped Perot secure 18 percent of the
vote, a significant chunk that may well have decided the election
in Bill Clinton's favor.
</P>
<P>
   Choate grew up in Red Oak, Texas, picking cotton on his father's
farm. After earning a doctorate degree from the University of
Oklahoma in 1969, he moved to Washington to work for the Commerce
Department. He now lives on his own farm in Washington, Va., with
his wife, Kay.
</P>
<P>
   Choate often has taken positions outside the mainstream of
economic thought, which generally promotes free trade.
</P>
<P>
   He has advised his friend Buchanan on foreign policy and coached
Perot before a 1993 debate with Gore over the North American Free
Trade Agreement. Choate argues that open markets have cost millions
of American jobs by forcing U.S. workers to compete with cheap
overseas labor.
</P>
<P>
   Choate's views cost him his job as a policy analyst with
Cleveland-based TRW, a manufacturing conglomerate. The company's
Japanese customers didn't like his 1990 book, ''Agents of
Influence,'' which accused Japan of spending millions of dollars on
government-officials-turned-lobbyists to influence U.S. policy.
</P>
<P>
   But if Choate and Buchanan share ideas on international trade,
they differ on many other matters. Where Buchanan is staunchly
anti-abortion, Choate believes it's the woman's choice. Buchanan
rails against excessive government regulation; Choate thinks the
federal Food and Drug Administration should regulate tobacco.
</P>
<P>
   Within 24 hours of the federal judge's ruling Monday in Choate's
favor, the new chairman announced plans for a party makeover,
including establishing headquarters in Washington and raising $1
million by the party's convention in August.
</P>
<P>
   Of the party's problems, Choate was optimistic Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   ''We have plenty of time to work this out,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> Third Party Convention Site Sought  </HEADLINE>
By LAURIE KELLMAN, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Reform Party's search for a place to hold
its nominating convention has hit new logistical and political
hurdles six months after the issue helped split the party into
bitter factions.
</P>
<P>
   Reform Party Chairman Pat Choate confirmed Tuesday that holding
the event in Long Beach, Calif., the locale for which he and other
allies of party founder Ross Perot fought, might no longer work.
</P>
<P>
   Not enough hotel rooms remain available for delegates, the
campaigns and reporters, and the convention center's busy schedule
wouldn't leave the group enough setup time, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ''What was envisioned is no longer possible,'' Choate said.
</P>
<P>
   Pat Buchanan, the front-runner for the party's presidential
nomination, wants the convention moved to another city, such as
Nashville, Tenn., mostly because of the lack of hotel rooms, said
Bay Buchanan, his sister and campaign manager.
</P>
<P>
   ''There was nothing wrong with the city'' of Long Beach, she
said. Aides have scouted sites from New Orleans to San Diego and
were most satisfied with Nashville, she said.
</P>
<P>
   ''It would make a marvelous statement,'' Bay Buchanan added.
''It's middle America.''
</P>
<P>
   The problems came to light after U.S. District Judge Norman K.
Moon ruled Monday that Choate is the legitimate chairman of the
party -- not Jack Gargan.
</P>
<P>
   Moon's decision appeared to seal the convention in Long Beach.
Gargan, an ally of Minnesota Gov. Jesse Ventura, who recently quit
the party, insisted on having it in St. Paul, Minn.
</P>
<P>
   The seemingly petty issue helped spark an internal party feud
that exploded into a brawl during a meeting last month in
Nashville, and which eventually reached Moon's courtroom.
</P>
<P>
   To move the site, Choate must convince the party's executive
committee to give up thousands of dollars in deposits to vendors in
Long Beach.
</P>
<P>
   The argument to move centers on the fact that the Long Beach
Convention &AMP; Entertainment Center is rented out the same week by
the Jehovah's Witnesses, which would leave the Reform Party less
than 12 hours to set up the convention.
</P>
<P>
   The building also is public and there's concern that party
officials wouldn't be able to keep opponents of Buchanan's
positions from protesting in the hallways.
</P>
<P>
   But Ron Walker, special projects officer for the city of Long
Beach, said local police would help keep protesters outside. ''Once
we rent it to somebody, it isn't a public area anymore,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> Bush To Raise $15M in One Night  </HEADLINE>
By JONATHAN D. SALANT, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Having set a new financial benchmark for
presidential candidates, George W. Bush for the first time will use
his fund-raising prowess to help the Republican National Committee
set a new mark by raising $15 million at its annual black-tie
dinner.
</P>
<P>
   Bush, the presumed Republican presidential nominee, will be the
featured guest at the April 26 RNC gala. GOP officials said they
expected to raise $15 million, surpassing the previous record of
$14 million collected last year when Bush's father, the former
president, headlined the affair.
</P>
<P>
   Bush's one-day take will be nearly double the amount that
President Clinton and Vice President Al Gore -- the expected
Democratic presidential nominee -- have raised for their party in a
series of fund-raisers across the country so far this year.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's been clear that the parties play a major role in the
election campaign,'' said Anthony Corrado, a professor of
government at Colby College in Waterville, Maine. ''In 2000, they
will play an even greater role and thus the party fund raising is
particularly important.''
</P>
<P>
   While Bush helps the RNC fatten its bank account, he also is
raising money for his own campaign. He netted $2.7 million for
himself in the last two weeks at events in nine states, pushing his
own record-setting presidential campaign total past the $75 million
mark, officials said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Democratic officials acknowledge their money disadvantage.
</P>
<P>
   ''We're never going to outraise the Republicans,'' Democratic
National Committee spokeswoman Jenny Backus said. ''They're going
to throw all this money behind negative partisan ads. It didn't
work in 1996 and it didn't work in 1998.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, the DNC is counting on Clinton and Gore to help narrow
the gap. The president is expected to raise $400,000 this weekend
in Las Vegas.
</P>
<P>
   Through Dec. 31, the DNC had less than $6 million in the bank.
The Republicans, who report their finances monthly, started March
with $20 million on hand.
</P>
<P>
   ''We're very focused on gathering the resources we need to get
our message out,'' GOP spokesman Bill McCarthy said.
</P>
<P>
   The latest RNC report showed six-figure donations from
traditional ideological givers and special interests with business
pending before the Republican-controlled Congress.
</P>
<P>
   The big givers last month ranged from Marilynn Berry, a
housewife in New Carlisle, Ohio, who gave $100,000, to Joseph
Canizaro, a New Orleans developer who forked over $240,000.
</P>
<P>
   In all, 11 individuals and business interests gave at least
$100,000 to the RNC in February.
</P>
<P>
   The others include US West, one of the Baby Bells seeking
federal approval to send data over long-distance telephone lines;
and First USA Bank, a credit card company with a stake in
legislation that would make it harder for indebted Americans to
file for bankruptcy.
</P>
<P>
   The brisk pace of money raising provides a stark contrast to the
debate raging on the campaign trail over reforming the current
system and lessening the influence of big money in elections.
</P>
<P>
   Gore unveiled a plan Monday to outlaw so-called soft money and
publicly finance congressional elections through an endowment. But
at the same time, he is working with Clinton to raise money for the
party. Together they've brought in more than $8 million so far this
year, Backus said.
</P>
<P>
   Bush offered a campaign finance plan of his own while overseeing
a presidential money machine that obliterated all previous records.
It would outlaw soft money contributions from corporations and
unions, but not from individuals.

<HEADLINE> Another Mass Grave Found in Uganda  </HEADLINE>
By CRAIG NELSON, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   RUGAZI, Uganda (AP) -- To the curious, Dominic Kataribabo always
offered a reasonable answer.
</P>
<P>
   The hole in the floor? For a refrigerator, he told his nephew.
The trench in the backyard? A new latrine, he told a local
councilman.
</P>
<P>
   This week, the explanations proved anything but innocent. On
Monday, authorities uncovered a mass grave in the backyard of a
home the Christian doomsday sect leader owned until three weeks
ago. The pit contained the strangled, mutilated bodies of 74
people.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday, they discovered 28 corpses in a room adjoining the
foyer of Kitaribabo's spacious brick home. Many of the victims also
appeared to have been strangled -- knotted cloths still ringed their
necks as their bodies were pulled from the dank hole in the floor.
</P>
<P>
   The death toll was certain to climb. When night fell and the
grisly work ended for the day, more corpses were still were
crammed, limb across limb, beneath the floor of the 10-by-10 room.
Forensic experts were to continue the exhumation today.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday's gruesome discovery brought to at least 591 the number
of dead in three compounds in southwestern Uganda that once
belonged to the sect, known as the Movement for the Restoration of
the Ten Commandments of God. Authorities believe the sect's leaders
are responsible for one of the largest mass murders in recent
history.
</P>
<P>
   The sect had up to 1,000 members, and officials believe they
make up most of the dead, though the identities of the victims
remain mostly unknown. Five other compounds in southwestern Uganda
belonging to the sect have not yet been examined, police spokesman
Assuman Mugenyi said.
</P>
<P>
   Scenes of horror linked to the apocalyptic sect have emerged
since March 17, when fire engulfed the chapel of a sect compound in
nearby Kahunga.
</P>
<P>
   At least 330 people burned to death. Kataribabo, a defrocked
Roman Catholic priest, is believed to have been among the dead -- a
body thought to be the 64-year-old's was found in the ruins, still
wearing a clerical collar.
</P>
<P>
   Authorities initially called the conflagration a mass suicide.
But within days, investigators discovered six strangled, mutilated
corpses in the latrine of the compound, triggering a murder
investigation.
</P>
<P>
   Days after the fire, 153 more bodies were found buried in a
Buhunga village compound belonging to the sect. Police discovered
the first Rugazi mass grave on Friday, when they came to inspect
Kataribabo's compound.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday, investigators including a pathologist arrived from
the capital, Kampala, to unearth 74 bodies local officials exhumed
from a trench in Kataribabo's backyard and quickly reburied.
</P>
<P>
   While tissue and blood samples were drawn, investigators
questioned Kataribabo's neighbors and relatives. His nephew, Bart
Bainomukama, led them to the foyer, where there were signs of
freshly poured concrete. Bainomukama told police that his uncle had
said he was digging a pit to install a refrigerator. A hole driven
through the floor quickly revealed the sight of a human leg.
</P>
<P>
   Authorities are pursuing the two main leaders of the movement --
Cledonia Mwerinde and Joseph Kibwetere, an excommunicated Roman
Catholic. The pair had predicted that the world would end Dec. 31.
When that failed to occur, authorities believe, sect members
demanded the return of possessions they surrendered to join the
sect and became an insurgent force that was put down with brutal
force.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the victims have been dead for ''about a month,'' police
official Geoffrey Bangirana said.
</P>
<P>
   Kataribabo was drawn to the sect soon after its inception in
1990. From a parish pulpit in the valley below his hilltop compound
in Rugazi, 160 miles southwest of Kampala, he urged the church to
adhere more strictly to the Ten Commandments.
</P>
<P>
   The Rev. John Baptist Kabuki, then-bishop of the Mbarara
diocese, did not tolerate Kataribabo's criticism, says Michael
Karyango, one of his nephews. The two also clashed over an offer of
money for development projects Kataribabo had received from friends
he made in California, where he studied theology in the mid-1980s.
</P>
<P>
   Kabuki barred him from receiving the funds, Karyango says. Soon,
Kabuki stripped the priest of his duties and Kataribabo joined the
sect full-time, later leading seminars at his compound on the
movement's secretive, often harshly regimented brand of
Christianity.
</P>
<P>
   In the days leading up to the fire, he shed many of his
belongings. He sold his house to Bainomukama for $3,300 on March
11. A day later, he and two others left the house after burning
religious literature, grass mats and bottles. He told Bainomukama
he planned to travel, spread the sect's teachings and buy a $13,200
home in Kampala.
</P>
<P>
   As one by one bodies were unearthed this week from the compound
he left behind, neighbors wondered how the strangulation deaths of
so many people could go unheard, how the digging of graves and the
burials of more than 100 people could pass unnoticed.
</P>
<P>
   Arsene Oworyanawe, Kataribabo's brother who lives in a mud-wall
house 30 yards from the compound, said, ''I didn't know anything. I
stayed in my house at night.''

<HEADLINE> Hasidic courier sentenced in designer drug import scheme  </HEADLINE>
By TOM HAYS, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- An ultra-Orthodox Jewish man who recruited
demure-looking couriers in Brooklyn for an international ecstasy
ring has been spared a harsh prison term by a federal judge.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. District Judge Leo Glasser sentenced the defendant, Shimon
Levita, 18, Tuesday to 2{ years in federal custody -- but not before
taking his Hasidic supporters to task.
</P>
<P>
   ''Where was the community when all of this was going on?'' the
judge asked in a crowded Brooklyn courtroom. ''Who was keeping tabs
on 18-year-olds who were flying drugs back (from Europe) and taking
money there?''
</P>
<P>
   Levita had faced up to 15{ years in prison after pleading guilty
to conspiring with six others to import millions of ecstasy pills.
</P>
<P>
   ''I was raised in a real Orthodox religious home,'' Levita told
the judge while asking for mercy.
</P>
<P>
   Before joining the conspiracy, Levita added, ''I didn't know
what drugs were.''
</P>
<P>
   The judge called the prison term, which starts with six months
in a boot camp, ''extremely lenient given the enormity of the acts
in which you were engaged.''
</P>
<P>
   Outside court, one supporter, Jacob Friedman, said, ''I hope the
whole community takes this as a warning to be on the lookout to
help these kids.''
</P>
<P>
   Authorities said Levita was swept up in a burgeoning trade in
ecstasy, a synthetic psychedelic amphetamine dealt to young
customers on college campuses, in dance clubs and elsewhere. Last
year, U.S. Customs seized 1.3 million pills from smugglers entering
the New York City area; only about 48,000 were seized in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   Levita was named in an indictment describing an Amsterdam-based
trafficking operation headed by Sean Erez. Authorities say Erez
began recruiting couriers from Hasidic enclaves in Brooklyn and
Monsey, N.Y., with the help of Levita in late 1998.
</P>
<P>
   Erez believed the young men, with their black hats, dark suits
and sidecurls, would deflect the suspicions of customs inspectors,
authorities said. The men each were promised a free trip to Europe
and about $1,500 if they agreed to retrieve packages in cities like
Brussels and Frankfurt; Levita was paid $2,000 per recruit.
</P>
<P>
   The couriers were told they were carrying diamonds. But
authorities say they ignored obvious signs that each shipment
consisted of up to 45,000 pills destined for sale in New York City
and Miami Beach. They also allegedly smuggled proceeds back to
Amsterdam in suitcases holding as much as $500,000.
</P>
<P>
   Narcotics agents began investigating the case last October. A
break came when Dutch authorities turned over tapes of wiretaps on
Erez's phones, which revealed conversations with Levita and others.
</P>
<P>
   When authorities started rounding up couriers last spring,
Levita fled with $100,000 to Amsterdam, where he ''experimented
with personal use of ecstasy,'' court papers said. He also began
plotting ''his own modest scheme to import ecstasy into Israel,''
the papers added, before he, Erez and five others were arrested
last July by federal agents and Dutch police.
</P>
<P>
   So far, five of the defendants have pleaded guilty. Erez and his
girlfriend remain in Dutch custody and are fighting extradition.

<HEADLINE> Spurs 89, Trail Blazers 85  </HEADLINE>
By LANDON HALL, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   PORTLAND, Ore. (AP) -- Tim Duncan scored eight of his 36 points
in the final 3:16 after David Robinson was ejected as the San
Antonio Spurs rallied from 11 points down in the fourth quarter to
beat the Portland Trail Blazers 89-85 on Tuesday night.
</P>
<P>
   Robinson was ejected for heatedly arguing an offensive foul with
the Spurs trailing 82-75.
</P>
<P>
   Damon Stoudamire's free throw made it an 83-75 lead, but Duncan
took over from there. His hook shot and a 20-foot jumper by Avery
Johnson, followed by four free throws by Duncan, tied it at 83 with
1:18 left.
</P>
<P>
   On the Spurs' next possession, Duncan was double-teamed but
still sank an off-balance 18-foot jumper to give the Spurs an 85-83
lead with 32.6 seconds left.
</P>
<P>
   Two free throws by Mario Elie made it a four-point game with
26.4 seconds to go, and after Brian Grant's layup, Johnson was
fouled and made both free throws for an 89-85 lead with eight
seconds left.
</P>
<P>
   Scottie Pippen's 3-point shot was far short as time ran out.
</P>
<P>
   Robinson scored 15 points and Johnson had 14 for the Spurs, who
won their fourth straight. Duncan added 15 rebounds.
</P>
<P>
   Pippen scored a season-high 25 points and Rasheed Wallace added
17 for the Blazers, who have lost four straight at home and six of
eight. Portland has its longest home losing streak since dropping
six straight from Jan. 29-Feb. 20, 1996.
</P>
<P>
   Duncan played 47 minutes and made 13 of 21 shots. He also was
10-of-11 at the line.
</P>
<P>
   The Blazers began the fourth quarter leading 66-61 and stretched
it to 74-63 on a 3-pointer by Greg Anthony. The Spurs began to chip
at the lead on an 18-foot baseline jumper by Jerome Kersey,
followed by a three-point play by Duncan that cut the lead to 78-73
with 6:06 to go.
</P>
<P>
   A 21-foot jumper by Wallace made it 82-75 Blazers, and the
momentum seemed to go Portland's way when Robinson was called for
the foul by referee Bennie Adams. Robinson had to be restrained by
teammates, and he finally stormed off the court. Spurs coach Gregg
Popovich also had to be held back by an assistant coach.
</P>
<P>
   It was Robinson's first ejection since March 2, 1996, against
Philadelphia.
</P>
<P>
   As it turned out, that's all it took to fire Duncan up.
</P>
<P>
   Pippen tried to atone for the Blazers' slump by himself early
on, pushing the ball and attacking the Spurs' interior defense.
</P>
<P>
   He hit two straight 21-foot jumpers, then a 3-pointer, and fed
Detlef Schrempf for an easy hook shot to cap an 11-2 run to open
the second quarter and put the Blazers ahead 26-22.
</P>
<P>
   The lead changed hands five times after that, and Sean Elliott's
3-pointer from the corner broke a 38-all tie with 1:05 left. After
a jam by Wallace on a lob from Schrempf, Elliott added two free
throws for a 43-40 Spurs lead at halftime.
</P>
<P>
Notes: Duncan had scored just 21 points on 7-of-18 shooting in his
previous two games against the Blazers this season. ... Portland's
Jermaine O'Neal made his third straight start in place of Arvydas
Sabonis, who is on the injured list with a sprained right foot.
O'Neal, recovering from a strained lower back, scored just two
points in 12 minutes. ... Stoudamire again lost his matchup with
Johnson, who outscored him 14-7. In three games, Stoudamire has
been outscored by Johnson 47-22. ... Elliott made one of four
3-pointers and finished with five points in his eighth game back
from kidney transplant surgery.

Memory Problems Connected to Chemotherapy
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   TAMPA, Fla. (AP) -- Ordinary doses of chemotherapy sometimes appear to leave
patients with poor memories, muddy thinking and inability to do math in their
heads, new research suggests. Cancer patients often complain of ''chemobrain''
during treatment. While they are typically reassured this will go away, little
attempt has been made until now to see if these subtle problems linger years
later. The new study, conducted at Dartmouth Medical School, found that people
who get standard chemotherapy appear to be about twice as likely as other cancer
patients to score poorly on various intelligence tests an average of 10 years
after their treatment.

   DENVER (AP) -- After consulting with victims' families, authorities have
decided to release only an edited report on the Columbine High School shooting
rampage in late May. Jefferson County sheriff's officials want to minimize
additional trauma for the families by editing out graphic details. They also
want to avoid releasing the report around the April 20 anniversary of the
attack. The report will be issued on CD-ROM, with about 200 pages of text, and
video and audio data, Undersheriff John Dunaway said Monday. It has not yet been
completely assembled.

Texas Tornadoes Kill Four

   FORT WORTH, Texas (AP) -- Two tornadoes carved paths of destruction through
the Fort Worth area on Tuesday, shattering windows in high-rise buildings,
overturning cars and uprooting trees. At least four people were killed and 48
injured. ''It's somewhat of a miracle that there aren't more injuries,'' said
Mayor Kenneth Barr. The tornado hit shortly after 6:30 p.m. amid severe
thunderstorms that were accompanied by torrential rains, softball-sized hail and
strong winds. Based on reports from tornado spotters, Fire Chief Larry McMillen
said the storm spawned two tornadoes. One took a northerly route, while the
second moved southeast through downtown.

OPEC Agrees To Boost Oil Production
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   VIENNA, Austria (AP) -- OPEC's decision to boost crude oil output by 6.3
percent offers scant relief for consumers staggered by skyrocketing prices for
gasoline, industry analysts said. But the Clinton administration, citing Energy
Department research, projected the move would bring down U.S. unleaded gasoline
prices by 11 cents to 18 cents a gallon by late summer. Ignoring objections from
Iran, its second-biggest member, OPEC announced Wednesday that a majority of its
members would increase production, in a rare departure from the group's usual
quest for unanimity.

   BAHIA DE LOS ANGELES, Mexico (AP) -- A boat carrying nine college researchers
studying spiders and scorpions sank off the coast of Baja California in rough

Four survivors clung to the side of the overturned boat for two hours, then
spent about three hours swimming through the choppy, 65-degree water before
reaching land Monday. The 20-foot launch carrying nine University of California,

<HEADLINE> High Court To Rule on School Prayer  </HEADLINE>
By RICHARD CARELLI, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- School prayer is back at the Supreme Court.
Nearly four decades after it banned organized, officially sponsored
prayers from public schools, the court is deciding whether schools
can let students lead stadium crowds in prayer before high school
football games.
</P>
<P>
   After hearing arguments in a Texas case today, the justices must
determine whether a pre-game prayer over a stadium's public address
system violates the constitutionally required separation of
government and religion.
</P>
<P>
   Their decision, expected by late June, could help clarify the
law surrounding school prayer -- a confusing jumble the nation's
highest court helped create. Texas Gov. George W. Bush, the
presumed Republican presidential nominee, and state Attorney
General John Cornyn, filed briefs supporting student-led prayer.
</P>
<P>
   The court's newest venture into the politically volatile issue
comes as an ABC News poll says two-thirds of Americans think
students should be permitted to lead such prayers.
</P>
<P>
   The poll, based on more than 1,000 interviews, found that 67
percent of those asked favored student-led prayers; 27 percent
opposed them and 6 percent gave no opinion. The poll's margin of
error was plus or minus 3 percentage points.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this month in Texas' Republican primary, 94 percent of
voters approved a nonbinding resolution backing student-initiated
prayer at school sporting events.
</P>
<P>
   The Supreme Court, however, often ignores public sentiment in
fulfilling its role as the ultimate arbiter of constitutional
disputes.
</P>
<P>
   In the Texas case, the Santa Fe Independent School District's
policy of allowing students to deliver any ''message'' or
''invocation'' at home football games was challenged in 1995 by
four students and their parents.
</P>
<P>
   Santa Fe, a community of some 10,000 residents about 40 miles
southeast of Houston, has seen deep divisions created by the prayer
dispute.
</P>
<P>
   Banning such prayers ''would be a huge disappointment not only
for us but for the nation,'' school board president John Couch II
said in a recent interview with The Associated Press.
</P>
<P>
   But Debbie Mason, a Baptist who is on the other side, testified
that allowing prayers at sporting events ''probably will destroy my
faith in the Constitution and what this country stands for.''
</P>
<P>
   At the Supreme Court, lawyers for the school district and Texas
are aligned against lawyers representing the students and parents
who filed the 1995 lawsuit.
</P>
<P>
   Their lawsuit also attacked the school district's policy of
letting students lead prayers at graduation ceremonies.
</P>
<P>
   A federal appeals court ruled last year that school officials
must tell students to keep their graduation-ceremony comments and
prayers ''nonsectarian and non-proselytizing'' but also ruled that
student-led prayers at high school football games are always out of
bounds.
</P>
<P>
   School district officials appealed both parts of the 5th U.S.
Circuit Court of Appeals ruling but the Supreme Court agreed only
to focus on the football games, passing up the graduation-ceremony
dispute.
</P>
<P>
   The justices' last major ruling on school prayer was announced
in 1992, and barred clergy-led prayers -- invocations and
benedictions -- at public school graduation ceremonies. ''The
Constitution forbids the state to exact religious conformity from a
student as the price of attending her own high school graduation,''
the court said then.
</P>
<P>
   The ruling was viewed as a strong reaffirmation of the court's
1962 decision banning organized school prayer.
</P>
<P>
   But in 1993, the justices refused to review a 5th Circuit ruling
in another Texas case that allowed student-led prayers at
graduation ceremonies.
</P>
<P>
   That ruling still is binding law in Louisiana and Mississippi as
well. But it conflicts with another federal appeals court's
decision barring student-led graduation prayers in nine Western
states. The justices also refused to review that decision.
</P>
<P>
   The case is Santa Fe Independent School District vs. Jane Doe,
99-62.

<HEADLINE> New Soybean Oil Said Healthier  </HEADLINE>
By PHILIP BRASHER, AP Farm Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- A new soybean developed by government
scientists yields oil that, once processed, has far less
heart-damaging fats and other substances than other cooking oils.
</P>
<P>
   The oil straight from the soybean has less than half the
saturated fat of conventional varieties. Also, it does not have to
go through a process that produces artery-clogging trans fatty
acids.
</P>
<P>
   Soybean oil is used in foods from margarine to crackers. Food
manufacturers are eager to find a healthier version, because the
Food and Drug Administration plans to require the listing of trans
fats on food nutrition labels.
</P>
<P>
   The soybean holds ''excellent potential'' for food makers and
''will provide the needed flexibility to be used in a wide variety
of products,'' the Institute of Shortening and Edible Oils, which
represents companies that process vegetable oils, said in a letter
to the United Soybean Board. The board helped fund the USDA
research.
</P>
<P>
   ''Just by changing the kind of oil that's used by food
manufacturers and restaurants would go a long way to reducing heart
disease in this country,'' Margo Wootan, director of nutritional
policy for the Center for Science in the Public Interest, said
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Shoppers won't see the new product before next year at the
earliest, because the first commercial crop being planted next
month in North Carolina will be saved for seed and testing.
</P>
<P>
   The new soybean was developed by Agriculture Department
scientists in Raleigh, N.C., using conventional breeding methods
and not genetic engineering, which has become controversial in
Europe and Asia.
</P>
<P>
   More than 80 percent of the vegetable oil used in cooking and
food manufacturing comes from soybeans because of its relatively
low price and wide availability.
</P>
<P>
   But soybean oil cannot be used for cooking unless it is
hydrogenated to extend its shelf life and improve its flavor.
Hydrogenation, which also solidifies the oil, removes linolenic
acid, a substance that causes the oil to taste rancid when heated.
The new soybeans have a third as much linolenic acid as
conventional varieties.
</P>
<P>
   Pioneer Hi-Bred International, a unit of DuPont, has a soybean
with half as much linolenic acid as conventional soybeans. Unlike
the USDA soybean, however, the Pioneer variety isn't lower in
saturated fat.
</P>
<P>
   Hydrogenated oil would still be needed for some products, such
as baked goods, to give them the proper texture and body, but
manufacturers could blend in unhydrogenated oil to lower the
overall content of trans fat, industry experts say.
</P>
<P>
   Health experts say trans fatty acids may be even worse for the
heart than saturated fat, but consumers have no way of knowing how
much of it is in food.
</P>
<P>
   Margarine made from hydrogenated soybean oil now lists only the
saturated fat -- about 2 grams per serving -- and not the 3 grams of
trans fat. Three Nabisco's Chips Ahoy! cookies, for example, total
2 grams of saturated fat along with another 2 grams of trans fat.
</P>
<P>
   The FDA's labeling plan spurring the search for healthier
cooking oil would require the amount of trans fat in a footnote on
nutrition labels while adding the amount of saturated fat in the
usual listing.
</P>
<P>
   ''We want to do everything we can to avoid the labeling when it
comes,'' Jay Franklin, an Oklahoma soybean farmer, said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   About 1,000 acres of USDA's new soybean will be planted this
year, enough to produce seed for 50,000 acres in 2001, said Richard
Wilson, a scientist working on the project. Varieties with similar
traits are being bred for local growing conditions in nine other
states: Georgia, Indiana, Maryland, Minnesota, Missouri, Ohio,
South Carolina, Tennessee and Virginia.

<HEADLINE> Pairs Event Gains Interest  </HEADLINE>
By SALVATORE ZANCA, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   NICE, France (AP) -- Usually, the first final at the World Figure
Skating Championships is the pairs. And it's usually the first
event forgotten once the men's and women's events get started.
</P>
<P>
   But this has not been your normal world championships.
</P>
<P>
   So far this week, two-time world pairs champions Yelena
Berezhanya and Anton Sikarulidze of Russia had to withdraw because
of a failed drug test, and a French pairs skater was attacked with
a razor.
</P>
<P>
   So even with the spectacular skating of Alexei Yagudin on
Tuesday and the anticipated meeting of Michelle Kwan and Irina
Slutskaya in today's women's qualifying, the pairs event has become
more of a focus than in the past.
</P>
<P>
   The Russian pair had to withdraw on Sunday, hours before the
opening draw. She was found to have taken a prohibited stimulant in
the form of medication for bronchitis. The test came at the
European championships, where the Russians won the title five weeks
ago.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday, the day after the short program for the pairs,
Stephane Bernadis was cut on the forearm by a man wielding a razor
when Bernadis opened his hotel room door, skating officials said.
Bernadis managed to slam the door shut, and the attacker fled.
</P>
<P>
   The 26-year-old skater required several stitches, but was
determined to skate with his partner, Sarah Abitbol, in today's
final long program. The seven-time French champions were in medal
contention after finishing fourth in the short program Monday. They
practiced Tuesday night although they did not do any lifts.
</P>
<P>
   ''We are unable to say if the attack is random or premeditated
or the act of a crazy person,'' said Didier Gailhaguet, head of the
championships organizing committee and president of the French
skating federation.
</P>
<P>
   Kwan, a two-time women's world champion, and Slutskaya -- who
beat Kwan in the Grand Prix final in January -- are in a loaded
group that has five medal contenders. Defending champion Maria
Butyrskaya is in the opposite group.
</P>
<P>
   In the men's event, Yagudin easily won the short program
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   The two-time defending champion moved rapidly across the ice,
strumming an air guitar, pounding imagined piano keys and banging
invisible drums. He won straight 5.9s for presentation.
</P>
<P>
   ''There is just one way to win a third world title -- to work
hard and to give your best,'' Yagudin said.
</P>
<P>
   Russian teammate Yevgeny Plushchenko, who took Yagudin's
European title last month in Vienna, also hit a quad and the
required elements. But he lacked the 20-year-old Yagudin's artistry
and polish, and finished second going into Friday's free skate,
which counts for 50 percent of the score.
</P>
<P>
   American Michael Weiss finished third, doing a quad, but
stepping out of the required double axel. Elvis Stojko of Canada
fell on his quad attempt and wound up fifth in the short program
and fourth overall.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. runner-up Timothy Goebel, who struggled in the qualifying
round, wasn't much better in the short program. His seventh-place
finish put him ninth overall, although he did do a quadruple
salchow.
</P>
<P>
   French ice dancers Marina Anissina and Gwendal Peizerat took
first in the compulsories, but Peizerat could not help but think
bout Bernadis' problems.
</P>
<P>
   Peizerat, who received threats following the 1998 Olympics,
rushed to see Bernadis after learning of the attack. ''He was in
shock, but in good shape,'' Peizerat said.
</P>
<P>
   Anissina and Peizerat won the compulsory dances -- the Viennese
Waltz and Argentine Tango -- over Italians Barbara Fusar-Poli and
Maurizio Margaglio. Russians Irina Lobacheva and Ilya Averbukh were
third.
</P>
<P>
   The ice dance continues Thursday with the original dance, and
the free dance is Friday.

<HEADLINE> Spring Training Roundup  </HEADLINE>
By The Associated Press	   Before the season even started, the Arizona
Diamondbacks caught
a bad break in their bid to defend the NL West title.
<TEXT>
<P>
   Matt Williams, Arizona's All-Star third baseman, will miss six
weeks after breaking a bone in his right foot Tuesday in the
Diamondbacks' 12-3 loss to the Seattle Mariners in Tucson, Ariz.
</P>
<P>
   ''Obviously, I'm disappointed,'' Williams said. ''I was really
looking forward to beginning the season and playing on opening day.
There are some things, especially in this game, that you can't
control.''
</P>
<P>
   Williams fouled a pitch from Frankie Rodriguez off the foot in
the second inning. Despite the obvious pain, he completed his
at-bat, lining out to center. He was replaced by Lenny Harris in
the top of the third inning.
</P>
<P>
   Williams immediately underwent an X-ray, which showed his second
metatarsal was broken. He will not require surgery.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's a tremendous loss,'' teammate Greg Colbrunn said. ''He's
the key hitter in our lineup and defensively. ... You can't sit
around and cry about it. You have to move on and do other things to
help make up for it.''
</P>
<P>
   The news was better for the Los Angeles Dodgers, who received a
scare when first baseman Eric Karros fouled a ball off his left
ankle in the seventh inning and was carted off the field.
</P>
<P>
   X-rays revealed no fracture, and Karros is expected to be
sidelined for just a couple of days with a bad bruise.
</P>
<P>
   Shawn Green hit two solo home runs as the Dodgers beat Montreal
4-3 in 10 innings at Jupiter, Fla.
</P>
<P>
   At Winter Haven, Fla., John Rocker received a warm reception
from Cleveland fans who have been hearing trade rumors, and Keith
Lockhart hit an inside-the-park homer, leading Atlanta to a 7-6 win
over the Indians.
</P>
<P>
   Rocker, the Braves' notorious closer, pitched an uneventful
seventh inning as the Braves won for just the second time in their
last 10 exhibition games.
</P>
<P>
   The left-hander has been mentioned in trade rumors with the
Indians and Montreal Expos.
</P>
<P>
   ''What rumors?'' Cleveland GM John Hart said. ''We've had no
conversations at all with the Braves. I don't know where that's
coming from. It's not even worth a comment.''
</P>
<P>
   In other games:
Orioles 10, Twins (ss) 9:
</P>
<P>
   At Fort Lauderdale, Fla., Brady Anderson hit a leadoff homer in
his first at-bat since March 10, and Calvin Pickering ended the
game with a two-run shot in the bottom of the ninth. Anderson had
been sidelined with a nerve injury in his leg.
Yankees 9, Tigers 7:
</P>
<P>
   At Tampa, Fla., Paul O'Neill went 2-for-2 with a homer and three
RBIs as New York won its sixth straight. Ricky Ledee also homered
for the Yankees.
Pirates 13, Twins (ss) 3:
</P>
<P>
   At Fort Myers, Fla., Warren Morris homered twice and Pete
Schourek allowed two runs in six innings to apparently wrap up the
No. 5 spot in Pittsburgh's rotation.
Blue Jays 8, Rangers 5:
</P>
<P>
   At Dunedin, Fla., Brad Fullmer homered twice and drove in five
runs to lead Toronto. Fullmer has five homers in the last four
days.
Marlins 7, Cardinals 4:
</P>
<P>
   At Melbourne, Fla., Brad Penny allowed two runs -- one earned --
and six hits in six innings in his first start since finding out he
made Florida's starting rotation.
Devil Rays 8, Phillies 5:
</P>
<P>
   At Clearwater, Fla., Miguel Cairo, Mike Defelice and Fred
McGriff each homered off Randy Wolf as Tampa Bay beat Philadelphia.
Earlier in the day, the Phillies acquired second baseman Mickey
Morandini from Montreal for cash.
Red Sox 11, Reds 8:
</P>
<P>
   At Fort Myers, Fla., Gary Gaetti's two-run double lifted Boston
over Cincinnati. Gaetti, invited to camp as a long shot non-roster
player, looks to have made the Red Sox after Boston trimmed its
roster to 26, leaving just one cut remaining.
Royals 18, Astros 9:
</P>
<P>
   At Kissimmee, Fla., Octavio Dotel was pounded for 10 runs in
three innings as Houston lost to its final spring game in Florida.
Rockies 7, Brewers 1:
</P>
<P>
   At Phoenix, Scott Karl recovered from a rocky start to throw
seven strong innings for Colorado against his former team.
Giants 7, Padres 5:
</P>
<P>
   At Peoria, Ariz., Shawn Estes, out of the rotation since March 8
with shoulder inflammation, allowed two earned runs in four innings
to earn the victory. Rich Aurilia went 3-for-4 with a home run and
three RBIs.
Angels 3, Athletics 2:
</P>
<P>
   At Tempe, Ariz., Jason Dickson allowed one run in six innings in
his second consecutive strong outing in his comeback from shoulder
surgery.

<HEADLINE> Mets, Cubs Get Early Start in Tokyo  </HEADLINE>
By BEN WALKER, AP Baseball Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   TOKYO (AP) -- The Lieber family, like a lot of baseball fans
across America, set the alarm clock real early.
</P>
<P>
   Jon Lieber was pitching on opening day for the Chicago Cubs, and
his parents wanted to watch it on television. Problem was, they
were in Council Bluffs, Iowa, and the game today against the New
York Mets was in Japan.
</P>
<P>
   First pitch at the Tokyo Dome for the major league opener was
scheduled for 7:08 p.m. local time -- that was 5:08 a.m. EST in New
York and 4:08 a.m. CST at the Lieber's house.
</P>
<P>
   And then it dawned on them. Throw a party, complete with a bunch
of friends, breakfast and a big-screen TV.
</P>
<P>
   ''We're going to start at 4 a.m.,'' Lynn Lieber said from her
home. ''My husband, Ray, will probably throw some bacon on the
grill, and we'll have about eight people over at the house.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's early, but how could we miss this?'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Truth is, most fans around the country were probably sound
asleep when baseball 2000 got started.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, Sammy Sosa could've hit four home runs or Mike Hampton
could've pitched the first no-hitter in Mets history, and not a lot
of people would've known it. Not right away, anyway.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think it's great my mom and dad are doing that,'' Lieber
said Tuesday before the Cubs' final spring training game against
Seibu. ''It's kind of wild.''
</P>
<P>
   The Liebers planned to pull in the Fox Sports Net telecast on
their satellite dish. For Mets and Cubs fans, there were plenty of
places to watch the earliest opener in big league history.
</P>
<P>
   In New York, large-screen televisions were being set up at Penn
Station so subway and rail commuters can see the game. The Official
All-Star Cafe at Times Square was holding a party and, because no
alcohol is allowed after 4 a.m., free hot chocolate was being be
served.
</P>
<P>
   In Chicago, the Harry Caray's restaurants were to open for a
breakfast buffet. At its downtown location, Caray's widow, Dutchie,
was going to lead patrons in singing ''Take Me Out to the Ball
Game'' during the seventh-inning stretch.
</P>
<P>
   Hampton faced Lieber in the opener, then Rick Reed starts for
New York against Kyle Farnsworth in the second game. After that,
with every other club still playing exhibitions, the Cubs and Mets
get three days off to rest and readjust to the jet lag.
</P>
<P>
   Most teams begin playing Monday. That's when Ken Griffey Jr.
makes his debut in his hometown of Cincinnati against Milwaukee and
also the day the Home Run Central features its first head-to-head
matchup -- Mark McGwire vs. Sosa.
</P>
<P>
   Sosa was hoping his regular season got off to a better start
than the way his spring training ended.
</P>
<P>
   Sosa finished up in an 0-for-15 rut, having gone hitless in
eight at-bats during a pair of exhibitions against Japanese teams.
The Mets and Cubs took turns playing Seibu and Tokyo Yomiuri, and
both series wound up in splits.
</P>
<P>
   ''The real season starts tomorrow,'' Sosa said. ''Tomorrow is
opening day, and I'll be ready.''
</P>
<P>
   Players on each team get $25,000 apiece for taking part in this
series, set up to help promote baseball worldwide. Though many
players got see Japanese culture and traditions, they kept
reminding each other that the purpose of their 7,400-mile trip was
to win.
</P>
<P>
   ''If we come all this way and go home without something to show
for it, that wouldn't be any good,'' Mets manager Bobby Valentine
said.

   In the latter category, Jane Eaglen sang her first Bruennhilde
at the Met on Tuesday night as the company presented ''Die
Walkuere,'' the second in the series of four operas that make up
''Der Ring des Nibelungen,'' as the full cycle is called.
</P>
<P>
   Eaglen, the prodigious English soprano who triumphed earlier
this season in another Wagner role, Isolde, took awhile to come
into her own as the warrior daughter of the god Wotan.
</P>
<P>
   After dazzling the audience upon her first entrance in Act 2
with her ''Ho-jo-to-ho'' battle cry, complete with trills and
ringing high Cs, she was less effective in the confrontation scene
with Siegmund, the hero to whom she must break the news that he is
about to die. Much of her music here lies in the lower register,
where she seemed to have difficulty projecting, possibly suffering
the after-effects of a cold. Nor did she succeed especially well in
conveying Bruennhilde's emotional transformation as she learns to
empathize with Siegmund so deeply that she disobeys Wotan's orders
and tries to save his life.
</P>
<P>
   And where Hildegard Behrens, who created the role in this Otto
Schenk production more than a decade ago, used to scamper friskily
up and down the rocky paths of Guenther Schneider-Siemssen's
mountainous set, Eaglen -- given her vast size and unfamiliarity
with the staging -- had to tread with painful caution.
</P>
<P>
   It was different story in Act 3, when Bruennhilde pleads with
Wotan to temper his punishment for her disloyalty. Here most of her
music lies in the middle to upper register, where Eaglen produced
gleaming pillars of sound that easily rose above the heavy
orchestration without ever turning shrill. Dramatically, too, she
was much more effective, simply by standing still and conveying the
emotion in her phrasing.
</P>
<P>
   This final scene was made immensely moving by her partnership
with bass-baritone James Morris, who has deepened his
interpretation of the role of Wotan over the years, even as his
voice has lost some power and security.
</P>
<P>
   Other familiar singers in the cast were tenor Placido Domingo
and soprano Deborah Voigt, who continue to set the standard in the
roles of Siegmund and Sieglinde; and mezzo Hanna Schwarz,
frighteningly vivid in her one scene as Wotan's nagging wife,
Fricka. Bass Eric Halfvarson was suitably menacing as Sieglinde's
husband, Hunding.
</P>
<P>
   Conductor James Levine drew some incredibly beautiful playing
from the orchestra, especially in the many lush string passages of
Act 1.
</P>
<P>
   ''Die Walkuere'' will be repeated with the same cast this
Saturday afternoon, a performance that will be broadcast live on
radio. Two weeks later, on April 15, the third opera in the cycle,
''Siegfried,'' will be presented, with Eaglen again as Bruennhilde
and Danish tenor Stig Andersen making his debut in the title role.

<HEADLINE> NFL Celebrations Targeted  </HEADLINE>
By BARRY WILNER, AP Football Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   PALM BEACH, Fla. (AP) -- The Green Bay Packers still can do the
Lambeau Leap, as long as it's one at a time.
</P>
<P>
   The St. Louis Rams can still the Bob and Weave, as long as only
one of them does it.
</P>
<P>
   The Dirty Bird? Fine, but just one Atlanta Falcon.
</P>
<P>
   Concerned about the choreographed celebrations throughout the
league, NFL owners scheduled a vote today on fining players who
conduct group demonstrations of their happiness. The competition
committee voted 7-0 to recommend a ban after viewing tapes of NFL
games, then seeing many of the elaborate celebrations on another
film of high school games.
</P>
<P>
   No yardage penalties would be assessed unless a celebration
turns into an act of taunting, which draws a 15-yard penalty.
</P>
<P>
   ''This gets to the 10 guys who make a circle to do something,''
said Minnesota Vikings coach Dennis Green, co-chairman of the
competition committee. ''That is out.
</P>
<P>
   ''There is nothing wrong with enthusiasm. But it's more than it
used to be. There's more publicity and the chance to be on the
evening news, and maybe a guy makes the Pro Bowl if what he does is
showing over and over every half hour.''
</P>
<P>
   Tampa Bay Buccaneers general manager Rich McKay, the other
co-chairman of the committee, stressed that the NFL is not looking
to become the ''no fun league.''
</P>
<P>
   ''We want to give some teeth to eliminate something a lot of
people find offensive,'' Green said. ''Two or more players
performing an act they created is not in line with the game. Hard
feelings can kick into place and can cause retaliation or
fisticuffs on the field. We don't like any act that can be
demeaning to an opponent.
</P>
<P>
   ''We think the best way to get it under control is fines.''
</P>
<P>
   Another recommendation deals with offsides rule on kickoffs.
That would be changed so it applies to any part of the body that is
past the 30-yard line before the ball is kicked. In the past,
players on the coverage team could be beyond the 30 while in the
air, as long as they landed after the ball was kicked.
</P>
<P>
   A clarification of what is a pass reception was made by the
committee; it doesn't have to be voted on, and will be used
beginning with the 2000 season.
</P>
<P>
   ''A receiver has to have possession of the ball and control of
the ball,'' Green said. ''Then, if his knee hits the ground and the
ball hits the ground, as long as he maintained control of the ball,
it's a catch.''
</P>
<P>
   That interpretation could become known as the Bert Emanuel Rule.
In the NFC championship game in January, Emanuel made a diving
catch in the final two minutes. It was then reversed by the referee
after examining the replay, because the tip of the ball touched the
ground -- even though Emanuel never lost control.
</P>
<P>
   This year, that catch will count.
</P>
<P>
   The committee voted 6-1 to recommend keeping the instant replay
system installed last year after a seven-year absence. Cincinnati
owner Mike Brown dissented.
</P>
<P>
   ''There were 110 games where it was never used, and 95 where it
was used once,'' McKay said. ''It wasn't intrusive. That's what we
wanted from the system. It's an insurance policy to fix the
(officiating) disaster that just occurred.''
</P>
<P>
   McKay said the owners have dropped plans for annual games
between natural geographic rivals such as the 49ers and Raiders,
Giants and Jets, Redskins and Ravens. The scheduling of such games
would be complex for the realigned league, which will add expansion
Houston in 2002 and change to a setup with eight divisions of four
teams each.
</P>
<P>
   ''Besides, some teams don't have those rivals, and there are
owners who are concerned about competitive balance,'' McKay said.
''A team will say, 'We want to play those guys, they're our natural
rivals,' and that team is struggling.''

<HEADLINE> Women's Final 4 Has Strong Coaches  </HEADLINE>
By CHUCK SCHOFFNER, AP Sports Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   Add the individual totals and you get a staggering figure: 2,293
victories. Coaching acumen definitely will not be lacking at the
women's Final Four.
</P>
<P>
   Four of the game's most successful coaches are getting together
in Philadelphia this weekend to decide the national championship.
</P>
<P>
   Pat Summitt of Tennessee is No. 2 on the career victory list
with 728. And there's Rutgers' Vivian Stringer, who's third with
621 wins.
</P>
<P>
   They'll meet in one semifinal game Friday night. The other will
send Penn State's Rene Portland (553 victories) against
Connecticut's Geno Auriemma (391).
</P>
<P>
   There's not much in the game these coaches haven't seen.
</P>
<P>
   ''What I'm looking forward to the most is the competition,''
Summitt said. ''You have four great teams there. It should be
exciting.''
</P>
<P>
   This Final Four is all the more interesting because of the
Philly flavor that runs through the teams. Auriemma and Portland
grew up in Philadelphia. Stringer coached just outside the city at
Cheyney State.
</P>
<P>
   It will be homecoming from some players as well. Penn State's
Andrea Garner and Rashana Barnes, Rutgers' Shawnetta Stewart and
Tennessee's Kristen Clement all are Philly products. Look for those
personal cheering sections to be a little larger and louder than
usual.
</P>
<P>
   And imagine how it must feel for Portland. The three other
coaches all have been to the Final Four at least twice. This will
be a first for Portland, in her 24th season as a coach.
</P>
<P>
   ''There's obviously (another) group of people that this means a
lot to,'' she said. ''A husband who for 24 years has watched this
woman do anything she wanted. He did a heck of a job raising my
three kids. They've allowed me to be me.
</P>
<P>
   ''And there's not many families in this world that lets their
mom be 100 percent themselves. I hope I've been a good mommy coach,
so that made it special.''
</P>
<P>
   Penn State (30-4), the Big Ten champion, has improved steadily
during the careers of its two senior leaders: Garner and Helen
Darling. The Lady Lions have gone from a 15-12 record and no NCAA
tournament berth when they were freshmen to a school-record victory
total and a chance to win the national championship.
</P>
<P>
   ''We thought about it our first year,'' Darling said. ''And she
told us our first year we were going to be the class to take us to
the Final Four, and here we are.''
</P>
<P>
   Connecticut (34-1) has reason to be grateful, too, even though
the No. 1-ranked Huskies expected to get this far all along.
</P>
<P>
   UConn won the national championship in 1995, returned to the
Final Four in 1996 and just now is getting back for the first time
since. Despite a 130-10 record the last four years, no current
Connecticut player has appeared in a Final Four.
</P>
<P>
   ''You're just glad when it works out for them because there are
a lot of kids in this country ... who make sacrifices and work hard
and don't get an opportunity to do this,'' said Auriemma, whose
team beat Penn State 87-74 on Dec. 5. ''So when it works, you're
really, really happy for them.
</P>
<P>
   ''When you score a lot of points, it just means that you've
scored a lot of points. When you can say, 'I'm going to the Final
Four,' it means you're a winner.''
</P>
<P>
   Tennessee (32-3), which is making its 12th Final Four trip under
Summitt, now will take its turn at trying to crack Rutgers' pesky
matchup zone. The Scarlet Knights' defense was so effective that it
held Georgia to seven points in the first 15:55 of their 59-51
victory in the West Regional final.
</P>
<P>
   Back in January, Georgia was good enough to beat Tennessee by
27.
</P>
<P>
   ''They'll have to play together,'' Summitt said of her team.
''We'll have to have excellent ball movement and player movement.
That's what we've been able to do a better job of since probably
late January, early February. We've learned to play the game better
together on the offensive end.''
</P>
<P>
   Her team's health is a concern for Summitt. All-American Tamika
Catchings sprained her right ankle in the regional final against
Texas Tech, and point guard Kara Lawson has been playing with a
stress fracture in her lower back.
</P>
<P>
   ''Lawson's dealt with some pain,'' Summitt said. ''I do think
it's affected her play. I just want her healthy.''
</P>
<P>
   Stringer is the first coach to take three schools to the Final
Four. She did it at Cheyney and Iowa before working her magic again
at Rutgers (26-7), which made it for the first time.
</P>
<P>
   ''She's a phenomenal woman,'' Rutgers' Linda Miles said. ''She's
a coach who gets you to buy into a philosophy of defense.''

<HEADLINE> Gore Seems Untroubled by Inquiries  </HEADLINE>
By SANDRA SOBIERAJ, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- While Republicans press for new investigations
into his missing e-mail and staff contacts with the Internal
Revenue Service, Vice President Al Gore waves them off as red
herrings and says there is no scandal there.
</P>
<P>
   But, in an interview with The Associated Press, Gore offered
little additional explanation about either controversy and
Republican rival George W. Bush indicated he would keep both
brewing.
</P>
<P>
   ''The problem with this administration is that we've heard all
about these red herrings before, but they always turn into
additional ethical problems when the truth comes out,'' said Bush
campaign spokesman Ari Fleischer.
</P>
<P>
   With a confident grin, Gore said: ''I hope they spend a lot of
time and a lot of energy on this.''
</P>
<P>
   In a West Wing interview Tuesday, the No. 2 man in one of the
most investigated administrations in U.S. history appeared as
untroubled by the newest inquiries -- and their implications for his
presidential campaign -- as he was vague about their details.
</P>
<P>
   Asked how much he used e-mail to communicate about fund raising
during the 1996 re-election campaign, Gore replied simply,
''Didn't.''
</P>
<P>
   Pressed to go on, he said: ''Well, first of all, I don't know.
But whatever is there will be disclosed -- fully and completely.''
</P>
<P>
   Reminded of his reputation as an Internet-savvy person who uses
e-mail frequently, he said: ''Not about this. First of all, I just
don't know. I just don't know. ... They're reconstructing this.''
</P>
<P>
   A Justice Department task force is investigating whether the
White House engaged in obstruction by failing to surrender e-mails
related to 1996 campaign fund-raising allegations, including Gore's
use of White House telephones and a Buddhist temple to solicit
campaign contributions.
</P>
<P>
   This week, Rep. Dan Burton, the Republican chairman of the House
Government Reform Committee, asked Attorney General Janet Reno to
turn the matter over to a special outside counsel. Republican Sen.
John McCain told Gore in a telephone call Monday that an
independent investigation is needed.
</P>
<P>
   Bush also is making a campaign issue of a recent Joint Committee
on Taxation finding that two of Gore's White House aides had
improperly attempted to get secret IRS information for a labor
union.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, Bush again pressed Gore to name the union.
</P>
<P>
   ''I don't really know,'' the vice president said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Communications Director Laura Quinn said aides had scoured
''schedules and briefing materials'' from the two months
surrounding 1997 contacts but had not come up with an answer.
</P>
<P>
   The two staffers who called the IRS on Jan. 28, 1997, ''have no
recollection of the calls at all themselves,'' Quinn said.
</P>
<P>
   Gore, asked if he recalled directing aides to contact the IRS,
said, ''No. No.''
</P>
<P>
   Without his knowledge, Gore said, the White House counsel's
office had given his aides advice on making requests of the IRS. He
blamed any appearance of impropriety on differences in ''a kind of
body of administrative practice'' used by the IRS and the White
House.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever his aides had been seeking, ''it wasn't a tax return,''
Gore added.
</P>
<P>
   As for Republicans looking for wrongdoing, ''I hope they spend a
lot of time and a lot of energy on this,'' Gore said, leaning
comfortably into his armchair.
</P>
<P>
   His confidence belied concern among Democrats that persistent
murmurs about scandal will only remind voters of Whitewater,
Travelgate, Filegate and Monica Lewinsky -- the unwanted catchwords
of Gore's shared tenure with President Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   ''I don't know where it's going, who's at fault or where the
missing e-mails are,'' said Democratic strategist Jim Duffy. ''But
none of this is a good story because it ties him right back to the
Clinton White House.''
</P>
<P>
   And it feeds into Bush's strategy. ''The American people are
tired of scandals and investigations. The best way to make them go
away is to elect someone different,'' said Fleischer.
</P>
<P>
   Gore, who has initiated campaign events called ''School Days''
and ''Working Family Days'' to get him closer to average Americans,
declined to let a news photographer in to take his picture during
Tuesday's 15-minute interview in his suite near the Oval Office.
</P>
<P>
   He also deflected questions about possible running mates, twice
saying, ''I'm not going to discuss the process.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore offered the interview because he wanted to talk about
Bush's education agenda before the Republican, who is dedicating
three days of campaigning to education this week, made an afternoon
announcement on literacy.
</P>
<P>
   Fighting accusations of dishonesty from the Bush camp, Gore
tried to blow a whiff of that accusation back at Bush by alleging
he was only pretending to be interested in improving education.
</P>
<P>
   ''His top priority is this risky tax scheme; he's made that
clear,'' Gore said.

<HEADLINE> Jane Eaglen Sings First Bruennhilde  </HEADLINE>
By MIKE SILVERMAN, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- The Metropolitan Opera is throwing its hat into
the Ring again, reviving its production of Richard Wagner's epic
cycle with a largely familiar cast and some notable newcomers.
</P>
<P>
   In the latter category, Jane Eaglen sang her first Bruennhilde
at the Met on Tuesday night as the company presented ''Die
Walkuere,'' the second in the series of four operas that make up
''Der Ring des Nibelungen,'' as the full cycle is called.
</P>
<P>
   Eaglen, the prodigious English soprano who triumphed earlier

<HEADLINE> Bush Making Up With McCain, Forbes  </HEADLINE>
By GLEN JOHNSON, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEWARK, N.J. (AP) -- After a bruising presidential primary
campaign, the Republican Party is moving toward reconciliation,
with George W. Bush reaching out to former rival John McCain and
picking up an endorsement from Steve Forbes, another vanquished
foe.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, Bush, the expected Republican presidential
nominee, is courting Democrats and independent voters with a
continued focus on education.
</P>
<P>
   Bush was touring an inner-city charter school today, less than
24 hours after rolling out a $5 billion plan aimed making sure
every child can read by the end of the third grade.
</P>
<P>
   Bush telephoned McCain on Tuesday while campaigning in suburban
Washington, declaring the ''past is the past'' and laying the
groundwork for a face-to-face meeting down the road.
</P>
<P>
   The Texas governor reached out to McCain after Bob Dole, the
defeated 1996 GOP nominee who has been acting as peacemaker, had
lunch with the Arizona senator and then called Bush.
</P>
<P>
   Bush wants McCain's endorsement, too, but McCain aides said it
is too soon to talk about that.
</P>
<P>
   Still, McCain adviser John Weaver said, ''The ice has been
broken.''
</P>
<P>
   ''I think John and I both understand that the past is the past
and it's time to move forward,'' Bush said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Later, Forbes welcomed Bush to his home state of New Jersey with
the endorsement.
</P>
<P>
   ''As the American people are learning and will learn, he is a
good man,'' Forbes told a meeting of Somerset County Republicans in
Manville, N.J. ''He has been tested -- I tried to test him -- and he
emerged the stronger for it.''
</P>
<P>
   By knitting together Forbes' conservative base with the
coalition of Democrats and independents who supported McCain's
maverick candidacy, Bush hopes to broaden his political base as he
squares off against Vice President Al Gore, the presumed Democratic
presidential nominee.
</P>
<P>
   During the primary battle, Forbes complained that Bush wasn't
conservative enough and McCain claimed he was too far right and a
hostage of ''Pat Robertson Republicans.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore already has seized on the themes and terminology,
incorporating McCain's attacks into his own anti-Bush rhetoric.
</P>
<P>
   The GOP politicking Tuesday threatened to overshadow the rollout
of Bush's $5 billion ''Reading First'' initiative.
</P>
<P>
   It would fund programs to diagnose problem readers, teach
instructors to identify them as such and correct the problem.
Initially targeted at 900,000 kindergarten and first graders, aides
said Bush wants to expand the five-year plan to address second
graders as well.
</P>
<P>
   ''Our economy is the envy of the world; unfortunately, our
schools are not,'' Bush said.
</P>
<P>
   Today's stop at the North Star Academy charter school was aimed
at highlighting Bush's earlier pledges to transfer federal
education authority to the states in return for the development of
accountability standards.
</P>
<P>
   Bush also favors fostering educational competition with
alternatives such as charter schools. North Star, the first such
school in New Jersey, has an enrollment of 144 students -- and a
waiting list of more than 700.
</P>
<P>
   There were several ear-catching subtexts to Tuesday's events.
</P>
<P>
   Bush attended $500,000 fund-raiser in Parsippany, N.J., where he
was introduced by Gov. Christie Whitman. While some political
analysts doubt he can pick her as a running mate because she
supports abortion rights, unlike him, his comments about her had a
teasing ring to them.
</P>
<P>
   ''I can't wait to campaign with her not only in the state of New
Jersey but all around America,'' Bush said. ''We share a passion,
we share a common passion. We want to do what's right for this
country. We want to elevate the spirit of America.''
</P>
<P>
   Forbes poked fun at Gore, the investigation of his missing White
House e-mail and his excuse that he may have missed critical
portions of a meeting about fund raising for the 1996 campaign
because he took frequent bathroom breaks after drinking too much
iced tea.
</P>
<P>
   ''Just the other day here we have the inventor of the Internet
saying he's had trouble with his e-mail,'' Forbes said. ''I don't
know whether he spilled iced tea on it or whether his dog ate the
discs, but it is simply a symptom of what is wrong with the
nation's White House today.''

<HEADLINE> Rights Groups Criticize U.S. Plans  </HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   UNITED NATIONS (AP) -- Human rights groups have strongly
criticized U.S. proposals to change the world's first permanent war
crimes tribunal, arguing that they would give the United States
veto power over the prosecution of Americans.
</P>
<P>
   William Pace, head of a coalition of more than 1,000 grass-roots
groups backing the court, said Tuesday the proposals would
undermine the independence, effectiveness and credibility of the
court.
</P>
<P>
   The United States was one of seven countries voting ''no'' when
120 countries approved the treaty to establish the International
Criminal Court in July 1998 in Rome. American officials felt the
treaty yielded too much prosecutorial power to the new court,
leaving U.S. troops and citizens vulnerable to politically
motivated prosecutions.
</P>
<P>
   This month the United States formally introduced proposals,
aimed at insulating Americans from the court's jurisdiction, to the
commission preparing for its operation. U.S. Ambassador David
Scheffer, the ambassador-at-large for war crimes issues, has been
discussing the proposal with delegates to the commission.
</P>
<P>
   Under the treaty, the court can exercise jurisdiction when
either the country where the crime takes place or the country whose
nationals commit the crime have ratified the statute.
</P>
<P>
   Bruce Broomhall of the Lawyers Committee for Human Rights said
the U.S. proposal would give countries that don't sign the treaty
power to prevent the court from prosecuting their nationals --
unless the country agrees or the U.N. Security Council approves.
</P>
<P>
   ''In our view this would provide an incentive to states not to
ratify the Rome statute, to stay out of the system,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The Rome statute also barred the Security Council from
interfering with the court taking a case unless all five permanent
council members and the majority of the 15-member council approved.
</P>
<P>
   Richard Dicker, associate counsel of Human Rights Watch, said
the U.S. proposal would undo this compromise by giving any of the
five permanent council members -- the United States, Russia,
Britain, France or China -- veto over the court taking jurisdiction.
</P>
<P>
   ''It would increase the control of the Security Council and its
five permanent members over the court and decrease the court's
independence and hence its legitimacy that is so necessary to
credibility and effectiveness,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Pace, head of the Coalition for an International Criminal Court,
said the United States tried but failed to exempt Americans from
prosecution during the treaty negotiations.
</P>
<P>
   A U.S. official, speaking on condition of anonymity, insisted
that the proposal is not an amendment to the treaty and said the
proposal doesn't bar trials in any country willing to prosecute.
</P>
<P>
   ''It is an attempt to ensure the balance that is needed in this
treaty between its worthwhile aims to prosecute perpetrators of
heinous crimes and the need for responsible nations to maintain or
restore international peace and security, and to undertake
humanitarian missions,'' the official said.
</P>
<P>
   The treaty has been signed by 95 countries and ratified by
seven. The 60 ratifications needed for it to go into force are
expected as early as 2002. The United States is not expected to
sign the treaty in the near future.

<HEADLINE> EU, World Bank Open Conference  </HEADLINE>
By JEFFREY ULBRICH, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) -- The European Union and the World Bank
are seeking up to $1.8 billion dollars to pay for economic and
reform programs in the Balkans.
</P>
<P>
   A funding conference, which opens today, will focus on launching
visible projects this year that will put people to work and show
them recovery is on the way after years of regional conflicts and
economic hard times.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is not a classic donor conference. It's very much a
partnership, very much a two-way process,'' said Catherine Day, the
EU's deputy director-general for external affairs. ''We will be
putting emphasis on what countries do to help themselves.''
</P>
<P>
   Forty-four countries -- mostly European, but also including the
United States, Canada, Japan and Korea -- are attending the two-day
conference, along with 36 international organizations.
</P>
<P>
   It is being held as part of the EU's Stability Pact for
southeastern Europe. That pact, adopted in June, is aimed at
fostering peace, prosperity and stability in the region and
eventually integrating Balkan countries into the European
mainstream.
</P>
<P>
   In return for the aid and investment, Albania, Bosnia, Bulgaria,
Croatia, Macedonia and Romania have committed themselves to
democratic and economic reform, as well as creating a stable
environment that will attract private investment.
</P>
<P>
   More than 400 projects were proposed by the countries, including
roads and bridges as well as projects to help reform economies,
banking systems and tax systems.
</P>
<P>
   Thirty-five ''quick-start'' infrastructure projects are expected
to cost $1.1 billion, officials said. The rest of the money will go
to projects aimed at shoring up democracy, security and reform
projects.
</P>
<P>
   ''We hope to have a quick-start package fully funded right
away,'' said Daniel Hamilton, a Stability Pact coordinator at the
U.S. State Department.
</P>
<P>
   Instead of funding infrastructure projects, the United States is
focusing on reform programs, said Larry Napper, the State
Department's coordinator for Eastern Europe assistance.
</P>
<P>
   Before pledging begins, representatives from each of the
recipient countries will report on what is being done to improve
the investment climate.
</P>
<P>
   The donor countries are looking for action to fight corruption,
reduce trade barriers and improve democracy, human rights and press
freedom. ''The reform elements here are absolutely critical,''
Hamilton said.

<HEADLINE> Pact on Helping Poor Areas Nears  </HEADLINE>
By PAUL SHEPARD, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The problem is etched on every boarded-up
storefront and vacant, overgrown lot across the country: Some
Americans are missing out on the economic boom.
</P>
<P>
   The question of how to spread prosperity to poor areas has been
the subject of negotiations between House Republicans, pushing
their American Community Renewal Act, and the White House, with its
New Markets Initiative.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday, Rep. J.C. Watts, R-Okla., said that while
differences still remain, agreement is close.
</P>
<P>
   While President Clinton proposes $15 billion in new spending and
the Republicans favor tax breaks, ''we share a common goal for
these distressed communities,'' Watts told the National Congress
for Community Economic Development, a trade association for
community-based economic development groups.
</P>
<P>
   Watts said the main sticking points in the negotiations are the
extent to which religious groups will be permitted to receive
federal money and a provision for capital gains tax relief as part
of the package.
</P>
<P>
   The GOP plan would involve religious institutions in drug
counseling and rehabilitation, using government money.
</P>
<P>
   White House spokesman Jim Kennedy said he couldn't characterize
the negotiations but said the president continues to view the New
Markets plan as crucial.
</P>
<P>
   ''It is a real priority this year,'' Kennedy said. ''The
president believes there is bipartisan support for using this
unique opportunity to reach out to those who are not fully
benefiting from our nation's prosperity.''
</P>
<P>
   The House Banking Committee is scheduled to vote on Clinton's
plan today.
</P>
<P>
   Watts, the fourth-ranking Republican in the House, said, ''The
negotiators tell me we are close. I don't think there is anything
on the table that would quash a deal.''
</P>
<P>
   Watts said he understood the concerns of some over routing
government money to churches but said they often do a better job of
helping drug abusers than other groups.
</P>
<P>
   ''If I'm wrong, I'm wrong but no one has shown me that allowing
these faith-based organizations to get involved is wrong,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Watts also proposed allowing people who get the earned income
tax credit to put a portion of their credit into a special account
the government would match.
</P>
<P>
   He said he anticipated getting legislation to Clinton's desk by
May 15.

<HEADLINE> President Wades Into Flag Debate  </HEADLINE>
By ANNE GEARAN, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Clinton is wading into debates over
display of the Confederate flag and religious tolerance in South
Carolina that roiled Republican presidential politics this year.
</P>
<P>
   The symbolism will be potent and the political undertones strong
as Clinton appears tonight at a $500-per-person fund-raiser
honoring Rep. Jim Clyburn, D-S.C., chairman of the Congressional
Black Caucus.
</P>
<P>
   Along with many other blacks in South Carolina, Clyburn wants
the flag removed from atop the South Carolina Statehouse.
</P>
<P>
   And in a state likely to vote Republican in the fall, Clinton
will point to the political controversy over the flag in this
year's pivotal South Carolina GOP primary.
</P>
<P>
   Presumptive Republican presidential nominee George W.Bush
demurred on the question of whether the flag belongs at the
Statehouse, calling it a local issue. Bush's former GOP challenger,
Arizona Sen. John McCain, also refused to take a position.
</P>
<P>
   On the Democratic side, Vice President Al Gore and
then-challenger Bill Bradley both called for the flag's removal.
</P>
<P>
   ''South Carolina is certainly a state that framed the
differences between the two parties,'' White House spokesman Jake
Siewert said.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's message also will apply to the controversy arising
from Bush's primary-season visit to Bob Jones University. Bush came
under fire for failing to criticize the university's racial
policies and the anti-Catholic statements on its Web site.
</P>
<P>
   At the time, the conservative Christian school banned
interracial dating.
</P>
<P>
   Supporters say the flag, which has flown atop the Statehouse
since 1962, honors those who died in the Civil War.
</P>
<P>
   The National Association for the Advancement of Colored People
is leading a tourism boycott of South Carolina until the flag is
removed.
</P>
<P>
   This week, the NAACP offered some support for a compromise
proposed by state legislators on both sides of the flag issue. That
plan would remove the flag from the Statehouse dome but erect other
Civil War-era flags on the Capitol grounds.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton will likely expand on rhetoric he used earlier this
month during a commemoration of the civil rights march on Selma,
Ala.
</P>
<P>
   ''As long as the waving symbol of one American's pride is the
shameful symbol of another American's pain, we have another bridge
to cross,'' Clinton said then.
</P>
<P>
   Clyburn said he wanted to hold the fund-raising benefit at
predominantly black Allen University to make a statement, even
though he could have been raised more money at a larger, more
lavish location. There will be seating for about 1,000 people.
</P>
<P>
   ''I want to make a statement about that flag every chance I
get,'' Clyburn said recently.
</P>
<P>
   By his presence, Clinton will ally himself with the movement to
remove the flag as a symbol of racism, said Bruce Ransom, a
political science professor at Clemson University.
</P>
<P>
   ''You've got the president in South Carolina, he's at a
predominantly black college, talking about the flag, and he's there
with Clyburn,'' Ransom said. ''As far as symbolism, there's a
bundle all together there.''
</P>
<P>
   Oklahoma Republican Rep. J.C. Watts, chairman of the House
Republican Conference, said he personally supports removing the
flag from the Statehouse, but that it remains a matter for South
Carolina's elected leaders to decide.
</P>
<P>
   ''All I ask for is consistency,'' Watts said Tuesday. ''If
you're going to ask Governor George Bush why he won't get involved
in South Carolina's business, then ask (South Carolina) Democratic
Governor Jim Hodges why it still flies over the state capitol,''
Watts said.
</P>
<P>
   Only the state Legislature has the authority to remove the
banner, which has flown since 1962.

<HEADLINE> Reno Deposed in Waco Case  </HEADLINE>
By MICHELLE MITTELSTADT, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Lawyers for Branch Davidians who are suing the
government over the 1993 Waco siege say Attorney General Janet Reno
has testified that she never gave approval for the FBI to use tanks
to demolish the sect members' compound.
</P>
<P>
   During a two-hour deposition Tuesday, the attorneys said, Reno
also indicated she does not believe the FBI intentionally destroyed
the building during a tear-gassing operation designed to end the
51-day siege. They said she described the damage caused by tanks
punching through the building's thin wooden walls as a function of
the tear-gassing.
</P>
<P>
   The Justice Department declined to discuss details of Reno's
testimony at the deposition, which is a rare event for an attorney
general to undergo.
</P>
<P>
   Lawyers for the plaintiffs, whose wrongful-death suit goes to
trial in mid-May, also claim Reno was less than forthcoming in
discussing whether the FBI acted deliberately to dismantle the
complex.
</P>
<P>
   One Davidian attorney, James Brannon of Houston, described Reno
as an ''an artful dodger'' who turned aside questions by saying she
wasn't familiar with all the facts.
</P>
<P>
   ''We expected her, quite frankly, to be a lot more familiar with
the details of this case,'' Brannon said.
</P>
<P>
   The plaintiffs' lead attorney, Michael Caddell, said Reno was
''less than candid'' on one issue, the demolition.
</P>
<P>
   ''The problem that she's got is she testified to Congress in
1995 that the damage done to the building was the result of
tear-gas insertion,'' Caddell said outside the Justice Department.
''And I think it's very difficult for her to back off of that
testimony.''
</P>
<P>
   Michael Bradford, U.S. attorney for the Eastern District of
Texas, disputed Caddell's claim. ''We would strongly disagree with
his interpretation,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ''She was forthcoming and candid and answered all the
questions,'' said Bradford, one of the government's chief defenders
in the Davidian suit. ''Her testimony will speak for itself, but it
was consistent throughout the deposition with her past testimony.''
</P>
<P>
   Davidian leader David Koresh and some 80 followers died April
19, 1993, when fire raced through their building several hours into
the tear-gassing. The government says the Davidians died by their
own hand, whether by fire or gunfire.
</P>
<P>
   Reno acknowledged Tuesday that the plan she approved did not
authorize the use of pyrotechnic tear gas, flash-bang devices
inside the Davidians' Mount Carmel compound, or building
demolition, Caddell said.
</P>
<P>
   ''She also testified she was never told ... that there would be
no plan to fight a fire at Mount Carmel should one develop,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   The plaintiffs contend the FBI's on-scene commanders ordered the
dismantling of the Davidians' compound several hours into the
operation -- in defiance of a Reno-approved plan that permitted such
destruction only after 48 hours if the tear-gassing proved
unsuccessful.
</P>
<P>
   While Reno refused to acknowledge deliberate demolition
occurred, Caddell said, she did concede that the on-scene
commanders would have been required to consult with FBI leadership
before speeding up the plan -- which didn't occur.
</P>
<P>
   Bradford declined to discuss Reno's testimony, saying the
federal district judge presiding over the case ordered depositions
sealed for 30 days.
</P>
<P>
   ''The judge has expressed a fairly strong preference that we not
get into a public debate over depositions,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Caddell said he will release both Reno's deposition and a
videotape of the proceeding in 30 days.
</P>
<P>
   The attorney said he does not hold Reno responsible for any
negligence at Waco.
</P>
<P>
   But he is using his depositions with Reno and high-ranking FBI
officials to buttress his contention that the FBI's on-scene
commanders -- special agent in charge Jeffrey Jamar and hostage
rescue team leader Richard Rogers -- deviated from the approved plan
by escalating the tear-gas insertion and destroying the building.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, U.S. District Judge Walter Smith granted a request
from the plaintiffs to dismiss their case against FBI sharpshooter
Lon Horiuchi. Caddell said an analysis of spent shell casings
indicated Horiuchi was not among those who started the gun battle
that sparked the siege.

<HEADLINE> President To OK Soc. Security Bill  </HEADLINE>
By CURT ANDERSON, AP Tax Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Without a dissenting vote, Congress sent
President Clinton legislation repealing a Depression-era law that
reduces the Social Security benefits of thousands of older workers.
The president intends to sign the bill into law.
</P>
<P>
   The bill, passed Tuesday by the House on a 419-0 vote, will
scrap a law that would have cut benefits this year by $1 for every
$3 a Social Security recipients age 65 to 69 earns in outside
income above $17,000.
</P>
<P>
   ''The victory today goes to the hundreds of thousands of older
Americans who don't see retirement as an end, but as a new
beginning,'' said Rep. Bill Archer, R-Texas, chairman of the House
Ways and Means Committee.
</P>
<P>
   About 800,000 people are directly affected, including 415,000
due refunds averaging $3,500 each because of deductions made since
Jan. 1 from their Social Security. In all, older workers or their
dependents stand to gain $6 billion in Social Security benefits
this year, or $6,700 each on average, according to the Social
Security Administration.
</P>
<P>
   The House had previously passed the bill unanimously, followed
by the Senate 100-0 last week. The House's action Tuesday was
necessary because of minor changes made by the Senate.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Charles Rangel of New York, senior Democrat on the House
Ways and Means Committee, called the legislation ''long overdue''
and said it demonstrates that Democrats and Republicans can work
together.
</P>
<P>
   ''There are plenty of differences between our parties,'' Rangel
said. ''Certainly, there should be a lot of things we can agree
on.''
</P>
<P>
   Although the legislation would not affect the financial
soundness of the Social Security trust fund over the long term, it
does carry a price tag of $35 million to implement this year.
Clinton has asked Congress to approve that amount for
administrative costs and additional claims expected from people who
delayed retirement because of the cap.
</P>
<P>
   Social Security Commissioner Kenneth Apfel said the agency's
computers will identify which people are affected and who gets
retroactive payments. People should only contact the agency, he
added, if they've recently changed their address or their bank.
</P>
<P>
   About 7.5 million people between the ages of 62 and 70 who
receive Medicare, Social Security or both will receive notices in
the mail detailing the change.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Fed Report Cites Tensions in S.D.  </HEADLINE>
By STEVEN BARRETT, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   SIOUX FALLS, S.D. (AP) -- The bodies of Ronald Hard Heart and
Wilson Black Elk Jr. were found last summer in a culvert near the
Nebraska line, the apparent victims of a brutal beating.
</P>
<P>
   Though the slayings are unsolved, they haven't been forgotten.
</P>
<P>
   Those deaths -- as well as several recent violent incidents
involving American Indians -- have heightened long-standing tensions
between whites and the state's largest minority group.
</P>
<P>
   Alarmed at the rising racial enmity, the U.S. Civil Rights
Commission released a report Tuesday saying South Dakota law
enforcement agencies must work harder to change American Indians'
dim view of authorities.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to the deaths of Hard Heart and Black Elk,
frustration has built over the handling of an Indian who died after
being stuffed into a garbage can in Mobridge, and an Indian who was
struck and killed on a road in Roberts County, in northeastern
South Dakota.
</P>
<P>
   ''I have not been in an area where the divide and the suspicion
between racial groups is as great as it is in South Dakota,'' said
Cruz Reynoso, vice chairman of the commission.
</P>
<P>
   The white population in South Dakota is 669,007, or 90.6 percent
of the total. American Indians are by far the largest minority
group, making up 8 percent, or 59,292. Only Alaska and New Mexico
have larger percentages of American Indian residents.
</P>
<P>
   Still, distrust of law officers runs high in and around South
Dakota's nine reservations, where unemployment often is staggering
and alcoholism widespread.
</P>
<P>
   ''There is a widespread perception that there is a dual system
of justice -- one for whites and another for Indians,'' said Marc
Feinstein, chairman of the advisory panel.
</P>
<P>
   Highlighting the divide, several members of the Sioux tribe,
which includes Lakota, Dakota and Nakota, held up a banner Tuesday
in the back of the meeting room as the report was released. It read
''Stop Lakota Ethnic Cleansing.''
</P>
<P>
   Much of the distrust can be traced to the American Indian
Movement's 1973 armed takeover of a trading post at Wounded Knee to
protest the government's handling of their complaints. In 71 days
of unrest, two Indians were killed and a deputy marshal was
wounded.
</P>
<P>
   The commission noted a series of Indian deaths -- in addition to
the slayings of Hard Heart and Black Elk -- all of which have
deepened the perception of inequality:
</P>
<P>
   -- Since May 1998, the bodies of eight men, six of them Indian,
have been found drowned in the shallow waters of Rapid Creek. Most
were homeless; all but one had a high blood-alcohol level. No
arrests have been made.
</P>
<P>
   -- In Mobridge, near the Standing Rock Sioux Indian Reservation,
the body of 22-year-old Robert Many Horses was found June 30. He
had been stuffed headfirst into a garbage can. After an autopsy
revealed he died of alcohol poisoning, charges against the four
white teen-agers implicated in his death were dropped.
</P>
<P>
   -- In the spring of 1999, a pickup truck struck and killed a
21-year-old Justin Redday on a deserted stretch of road in Roberts
County. Though a grand jury indicted Mark Appel for vehicular
homicide, prosecutors instead charged Appel with driving while
intoxicated.
</P>
<P>
   The report urges Attorney General Janet Reno to appoint a task
force to address claims that race dictates how authorities
investigate and prosecute criminal cases.
</P>
<P>
   The report also recommends hate-crimes legislation at the state
level and stronger federal measures to deal with race-related
crime. And it urges Gov. Bill Janklow to convene a summit with
Indian groups to come up with legislation more responsive to their
needs.
</P>
<P>
   Mary Frances Berry, chairwoman of the commission, reiterated
Tuesday the claim she made in December that federal law officers
often care little about Indians' concerns over justice.
</P>
<P>
   An FBI official who oversees agents in South Dakota disputed
allegations in the report, saying the commissioners' two-day visit
in December was too brief to provide a clear view of relations
between federal law enforcement and Indians.
</P>
<P>
   ''A lot of the research they did is just wafer-thin,'' said Chip
Burrus, assistant special agent in charge of the FBI's Minneapolis
office.
</P>
<P>
   ''They basically tar every agent in South Dakota,'' he said of
the report's authors. ''It's a vote of no confidence, and I think
that's just wrong.''
</P>
<P>
   Burrus denied the suggestion that FBI agents are slow to act
when a crime involves Indians. ''We have moved heaven and earth
trying to solve murder cases in South Dakota.''
</P>
<P>
   Burrus said Indians called on the FBI recently when protesters
took over Sisseton-Wahpeton Sioux tribal headquarters at Agency
Village. Indians also sought the FBI's help in the ongoing takeover
of Oglala Sioux headquarters at the Pine Ridge reservation.
</P>
<P>
   Those are not the actions of a people who have no faith in the
FBI, Burrus said, adding that the FBI also does informal public
relations work and tries to keep Indians up to date on a given
probe.
</P>
<P>
   ''Our agents are very comfortable with native Americans,'' he
said. ''Native Americans and non-native Americans have a lot of
confidence in the FBI.''

<HEADLINE> HMO Group Launches Ad Campaign  </HEADLINE>
BY KAREN GULLO, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- An ad campaign focusing on medical errors has
been launched by an HMO group that opposes legislation that would
give Americans harmed by bad care the right to sue health plans.
</P>
<P>
   The 30-second spots that began airing today aim to shift the
focus on protecting patients to eliminating medical errors instead
of settling patient disputes in court, said Karen Ignani, president
of the American Association of Health Plans, which sponsored the
ads.
</P>
<P>
   ''For too long, too many have been looking to the courts to
solve health care problems,'' said Ignani. ''It will not work to
improve patient safety.''
</P>
<P>
   The ad, which will cost $200,000 and run nationwide on CNN and
other networks over the next two weeks, says that ''medical
mistakes can kill'' and warns that ''Washington prefers more
lawsuits'' to taking steps to prevent mistakes.
</P>
<P>
   The solution, the ad suggests, is to ''get patients the care
they need instead of getting lawyers the clients they want.''
</P>
<P>
   Medical errors have gotten the attention of lawmakers and
President Clinton since the Institute of Medicine released a study
last November showing that as many as 98,000 people are killed
annually because of medical mixups.
</P>
<P>
   The president has called for a national reporting system for
collecting information about preventable deaths and major injuries.
</P>
<P>
   The American Association of Health Plans hopes to build support
for the proposal. It also wants to discourage lawmakers from
passing a patients' rights bill that would subject insurers to
lawsuits, which they are now protected from by federal law. The
group contends that lawsuits will drive up costs and prompt
employers to drop coverage.
</P>
<P>
   The insurance industry lobbied hard but ultimately failed to
derail a bipartisan House bill last fall that would allow lawsuits.
Some Republicans, traditional allies of the industry, crossed over
to vote for the bill.
</P>
<P>
   Lawmakers are now working out a compromise between the House
bill and a Senate-passed bill -- written and supported by
Republicans -- that doesn't allow lawsuits. They haven't yet reached
agreement on the lawsuit issue.
</P>
<P>
   Neither bill includes remedies or protections against medical
mistakes, although they could be added.
</P>
<P>
   Patients' rights are a popular issue with a public frustrated
with restrictions and cost-cutting in health maintenance
organizations. Both Republicans and Democrats have said they
support a patients' bill of rights.
</P>
<P>
   But there are serious disagreements about whether health plans
should be held legally liable when patients believe they are harmed
by care decisions and whether the bill should overtake state laws
providing patient protections.

<HEADLINE> EU Commissioner Meets China Premier  </HEADLINE>
By ELAINE KURTENBACH, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   BEIJING (AP) -- Europe's top trade negotiator met Chinese Premier
Zhu Rongji today amid signs that negotiations on China's entry to
the World Trade Organization were making progress.
</P>
<P>
   Pascal Lamy, EU trade commissioner, and Zhu set out their sides'
positions in an 80-minute session held a day after they resumed
fitful, yearslong negotiations.
</P>
<P>
   ''The fact that we met Zhu this early on in the process is a
reflection of the importance that both sides attach to what we're
doing,'' said Anthony Gooch, Lamy's spokesman.
</P>
<P>
   Zhu intervened at critical moments during China-U.S.
negotiations in November, helping forge a market-opening deal that
cleared Beijing's biggest hurdle to joining the WTO. The 15-nation
European Union is now the most important among eight WTO members
with which China needs to conclude market-opening deals.
</P>
<P>
   Lamy, absent from two previous rounds this year, joined the
talks to help deal with thorny political issues blocking a final
bilateral trade agreement.
</P>
<P>
   He opened Tuesday's session with Chinese Foreign Trade Minister
Shi Guangsheng, and the pair were scheduled to resume their talks
later today, following the Zhu meeting.
</P>
<P>
   Neither side would detail what Gooch on Tuesday described as
''sticking points on a number of issues.''
</P>
<P>
   After 14 years of trying, China's communist leadership has made
joining WTO this year a priority. It hopes the rules-based WTO
regime will bring in foreign investment and force long-protected
state industries to make reforms they have resisted.
</P>
<P>
   EU negotiators want greater access to China's automobile,
insurance and telecommunications markets and guarantees that more
European insurers will get Chinese business licenses, EU officials
said.
</P>
<P>
   Negotiators are pushing for more concessions than China granted
the United States last November. But in the last round of talks in
Geneva this month, Chinese officials hinted they would be
hard-pressed to give the EU more than the United States.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. pact gives foreign companies the right to own up to 50
percent of Chinese telecommunications companies and secures wider
access for foreign insurers and bankers, who are now limited by
tight geographical restrictions and an erratic licensing process.
</P>
<P>
   As part of that deal, the Clinton administration has asked
Congress to end annual reviews of China's low-tariff trading rights
and grant them permanently. Legislators have balked. Critics
question whether China will meet WTO obligations or erect new
barriers to trade even as it lowers tariffs.

<HEADLINE> 2 Kids Die As Train Hits School Bus  </HEADLINE>
By DUNCAN MANSFIELD, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   TENNGA, Ga. (AP) -- By many accounts, Rhonda Cloer is a competent
and conscientious school bus driver.
</P>
<P>
   ''Every time that lady has come through there, that bus has
stopped at that road,'' resident Edward Watson said Tuesday after a
freight train struck Cloer's school bus, killing two children and
injuring five others -- including the driver's daughter.
</P>
<P>
   ''If you have children on the bus, even if the train had blowed
its horn, she may not have even heard it,'' Watson said.
</P>
<P>
   An engineer apparently was blowing the train's horn, but federal
investigators don't know if Cloer heard it before the train slammed
into the bus at 50 mph.
</P>
<P>
   A ''black box'' aboard the 33-car CSX train and a
student-monitoring video camera on the bus may provide clues to the
early morning accident, said Kenneth Suydam, lead investigator with
the National Transportation Safety Board.
</P>
<P>
   ''We have initial, preliminary information from the event
recorder on the engine which indicates that the horn was sounding
and the bells were continuously sounding as the train approached
the crossing,'' Suydam said.
</P>
<P>
   Traveling under the allowed speed of 60 mph through this
600-member community on the Tennessee-Georgia line, the train hit
the bus broadside, spun it around and ripped the body off the
chassis.
</P>
<P>
   The one-lane crossing has only a sign. In Tennessee and Georgia,
school buses are required to stop at all rail crossings.
</P>
<P>
   ''It is unknown at this time in the investigation if this school
bus came to a stop,'' Suydam said.
</P>
<P>
   Kate Pannell, personnel director for Murray County schools, said
she knew of no previous accidents on Cloer's record.
</P>
<P>
   Cloer, 34, who has worked as a county school bus driver for
three years, had picked up seven students early in her route to
Northwest Elementary School near Chatsworth.
</P>
<P>
   Killed were 6-year-old Kayla Silvers and 9-year-old Daniel Pack.
The fatalities were the first aboard a Georgia public school bus in
15 years.
</P>
<P>
   Three children were in critical condition and two were listed as
serious, said Sharon Cahill, a spokeswoman Erlanger Medical Center
in Chattanooga, Tenn. Cloer, whose 5-year-old daughter was among
the injured, was in fair condition.
</P>
<P>
   Dana Keeton, spokeswoman for the Tennessee Highway Patrol said
it was ''way too early'' to decide about criminal charges in the
accident.
</P>
<P>
   About 150 cars pass the crossing daily, and 13 trains pass the
intersection at about 60 mph, said Luanne Grandinetti, spokeswoman
for the Tennessee Department of Transportation.
</P>
<P>
   Of the 3,424 railroad crossings in the state, 61 percent are
''passive,'' meaning there is a warning sign, but no lights or
gate. Electronic warning systems are only required at crossing
where more than 100 cars cross each day, there is regular school
bus and train traffic and a fatal accident has happened.
</P>
<P>
   The crossing now appears to meet all those requirements,
Grandinetti said. She said some sort of warning system would be
installed.

<HEADLINE> China, Berger Discuss Security  </HEADLINE>
By JOHN LEICESTER, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   BEIJING (AP) -- With the two countries at odds over Taiwan and
human rights, China's foreign minister told U.S. National Security
Adviser Sandy Berger today that ties between Beijing and Washington
are at a ''critical juncture.''
</P>
<P>
   Foreign Minister Tang Jiaxuan expressed hope at the start of
their talks that Berger would personally play a constructive role
to help China-U.S. ties improve and develop.
</P>
<P>
   ''You are our old friend,'' Tang said. ''Every time China-U.S.
relations reach a critical stage, you play a positive role. And now
our relationship is at a critical juncture.''
</P>
<P>
   Berger is one of the most senior U.S. officials to visit since
ties soured after NATO bombed the Chinese Embassy in Belgrade last
May during airstrikes against Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
   Berger told Tang he was pleased to be in Beijing and said, ''I
very much look forward to our talks today.''
</P>
<P>
   Aside from Tang, Berger was also to meet today with Premier Zhu
Rongji and Vice Premier Qian Qichen, a foreign policy expert. On
Thursday, he meets President Jiang Zemin and Liu Huaqiu, an expert
on security issues.
</P>
<P>
   Berger, who accompanied President Clinton to South Asia last
week, was expected to discuss shared U.S. and Chinese concerns over
Pakistan and India's nuclear programs and other regional security
issues.
</P>
<P>
   He also will likely raise human rights concerns and reiterate
appeals for Chinese restraint following Taiwan's March 18
presidential election.
</P>
<P>
   China views Taiwan as the most sensitive issue in its often
difficult relationship with Washington. Beijing recently protested
U.S. arms sales to Taiwan and a U.S. congressional bill that would
strengthen cooperation between the U.S. and Taiwanese militaries.
The Clinton administration opposes the measure.
</P>
<P>
   Washington, meanwhile, was unsettled by China's threats of force
against Taiwan ahead of the island's March 18 presidential
election. China regards Taiwan as part of its territory and warned
it would attack if the island declares independence. The two sides
split in 1949 in the Chinese civil war, and Beijing says Taiwan
must eventually reunify with the Chinese mainland.
</P>
<P>
   China also is fighting a U.S. effort at the current meeting of
the U.N. Human Rights Commission in Geneva to censure Beijing for
what Washington says is a worsening Chinese rights record.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday, a Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman accused
Washington of double standards by seeking U.N. censure of Beijing
despite having its own ''very serious human rights problem.''
</P>
<P>
   Sun Yuxi predicted that the U.S. effort would fail, as in
previous years. He said the United States should examine its own
problems ''instead of making irresponsible remarks and accusations
against other countries.''

<HEADLINE> Court case filed over mayor's release of Dorismond records  </HEADLINE>
By BETH J. HARPAZ, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Public Advocate Mark Green says he is certain
Mayor Rudolph Giuliani violated the law in releasing Patrick
Dorismond's sealed criminal records, and he's asking the courts to
intervene.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday, Green filed papers seeking a judicial inquiry into
how Giuliani and his police commissioner, Howard Safir, obtained
Dorismond's records and whether they broke the law in making them
public.
</P>
<P>
   ''The only way these records, under the law, can be publicly
released is by a court order, not a mayoral fiat,'' Green said.
</P>
<P>
   Asked if the mayor should step down, Green said ''no'' and added
that he is ''not seeking any penalty. My goal is that if a court
rules that the mayor acted illegally and abused his power, this
will stop him from doing this again. ... No mayor should
unilaterally decide to do it because it politically advantages him
in a public controversy.''
</P>
<P>
   Told of Green's attempt to declare the release of the records
illegal, Giuliani responded: ''I'm willing to defend it anywhere.''
</P>
<P>
   Dorismond, 26, was fatally shot March 16 in Manhattan during a
confrontation with undercover police looking to buy drugs.
</P>
<P>
   Shortly after the shooting, Dorismond's criminal records -- a
robbery arrest at age 13, and adult arrests for gun possession and
assault -- were given out a City Hall press conference.
</P>
<P>
   The juvenile case was dismissed and the records sealed, and in
the other two cases, Dorismond pleaded guilty to disorderly
conduct.
</P>
<P>
   Giuliani said Tuesday that the records came from the Police
Department and that the Corporation Counsel, which is the city's
legal arm, advised him it was legal to release them because privacy
rights end with death.
</P>
<P>
   But Giuliani acknowledged that the law does not explicitly
authorize the post-mortem release of sealed records.
</P>
<P>
   ''It is silent on that,'' Giuliani conceded. ''So the area is
clearly ambiguous.''
</P>
<P>
   Green disagreed. ''The records are sealed, and there is nothing
in any statute that this ends with the death of a person,'' Green
said. ''... It may be true that you can't libel a dead person but
that has nothing to do with this.''
</P>
<P>
   Green cited previous legal cases in which sealed records of
deceased individuals were sought but could not be opened without
court order.
</P>
<P>
   Giuliani said Tuesday he released the records because what they
''demonstrate is a propensity to violence. That is important for
people to know in judging whether the police officers were telling
the truth that (Dorismond) began the violence and caused his own
death.''
</P>
<P>
   A hearing on whether Green's case should proceed was scheduled
for April 13 before Justice Louise Gans in state Supreme Court in
Manhattan.
</P>
<P>
   Green, one of Giuliani's most vocal critics, intends to run for
mayor in 2001 when Giuliani's term ends.
</P>
<P>
   If Giuliani is elected to the U.S. Senate later this year, the
City Charter mandates that the public advocate is first in line to
fill out the remaining year of his term.
</P>
<P>
   In bringing the case, Green invoked an obscure provision of the
City Charter that allows taxpayers and certain public officials to
seek judicial inquiries into government affairs.
</P>
<P>
   Until now, no public official has ever sued under the provision,
which dates to 1901. But taxpayers have used it to bring cases
before, notably in the late '70s when a group of citizens sought to
investigate the treatment of animals at the Central Park Zoo.
</P>
<P>
   Green asserted that the mayor's release of information related
to Dorismond's adult criminal record was also illegal. Green's
legal counsel, Laurel Eisner, said that under state law, disorderly
conduct is a violation of the law -- an even lesser crime than a
misdemeanor -- and that such cases are supposed to be sealed.
</P>
<P>
   Green was joined in his petition for a judicial inquiry by U.S.
Reps. Charles Rangel of Manhattan, Jose Serrano of the Bronx and
Gregory Meeks of Queens, six state legislators, and six City
Council members.

<HEADLINE> Model of White House on Display  </HEADLINE>
By CARL HARTMAN, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Tourists visiting the White House don't get to
see the master bedroom or the first lady's dressing room, but a
reasonable facsimile of both goes on view today, part of a 60-foot,
10-ton model on exhibit at the National Building Museum.
</P>
<P>
   The master bedroom in ''The White House in Miniature'' has
off-white wallpaper and a Chinese design of small bluebirds. The
dressing room includes a full-length oval mirror and family
pictures, all on a scale of one inch to a foot.
</P>
<P>
   Designer John Zweifel, 63, his wife Jan and their six children
have been working on the model for 38 years. They have shown it
more than 350 times in all 50 states, Europe and Japan.
</P>
<P>
   Clocks tick, phones ring, chandeliers and working TV sets light
up, smoke rises from the chimney in the East Wing. But Zweifel has
not put any carvings in Hillary Rodham Clinton's sculpture garden,
explaining that the exhibits change every few months.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is really the end of the tour, we're looking for a home
for it,'' he said. Washington would be an ideal place, he added.
</P>
<P>
   Since President Ford's administration, Zweifel has been granted
unusual access to explore and examine the entire White House,
including the living quarters that are off limits to virtually
everyone but the first family.
</P>
<P>
   As new presidents and their families change the decor, Zweifel
does the same with his model.
</P>
<P>
   John Adams and wife Abigail were the first to move into the
pre-plumbing Executive Mansion -- that will be just 200 years ago on
Nov. 1. They gave the dressing room one of the first water closets.
</P>
<P>
   The room served as a bedroom for Tad Lincoln, the president's
son. Woodrow Wilson and his second wife, whom he married during his
presidency, used it as a newlyweds' hideaway.
</P>
<P>
   The exhibit also has a 20-foot model of the building as it
looked under construction, as George Washington saw it on a trip to
the future capital after he left the presidency in 1796.
</P>
<P>
   Since then, the White House has undergone a series of
transformations, beginning after British forces burned out almost
everything but the outside walls in 1814. Dolley Madison, the first
lady, saved the big portrait of George Washington that now hangs in
the East Room.
</P>
<P>
   In 1949, when the building seemed about to collapse, President
Truman had it entirely gutted and rebuilt.
</P>
<P>
   Visitors to the exhibit can see not only President Clinton's
Oval Office and the Rose Garden, but separate models of the office
as it looked under Presidents Kennedy and Reagan. Curator Michael
Harrison explained that Zweifel has designed rooms in the model so
they can be pulled out like drawers, redesigned and replaced.
</P>
<P>
   ''The White House in Miniature'' will be at the National
Building Museum through Sept. 17. Admission is free. Zweifel said
it would open in Dallas Sept. 28, but doesn't know where it will go
after that.

<HEADLINE> Former bank employee pleads guilty  </HEADLINE>
By LARRY NEUMEISTER, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- A former Bank of New York employee who pleaded
guilty to charges stemming from a $7 billion Russian money
laundering scam is not cooperating with prosecutors even though her
plea deal calls for a light sentence, her lawyer says.
</P>
<P>
   ''She has nothing to offer,'' said Charles D. Adler, the lawyer
for Svetlana Kudryavtsev, a 50-year-old Brooklyn woman.
</P>
<P>
   Kudryavtsev's plea Tuesday came in response to two charges that
carry a potential penalty of 35 years in prison, but the six-to-12
month sentence of home detention to which prosecutors have agreed
is more in line with what Adler described as a ''minor and
peripheral'' role.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. District Judge Jed S. Rakoff set sentencing for July 7.
</P>
<P>
   Kudryavtsev admitted accepting $500 a month to monitor bank
accounts, which were used to launder money. She pleaded guilty to
single counts of accepting illegal payments as a bank employee and
lying to investigators.
</P>
<P>
   Afterward, Kudryavtsev stood in the back of the courtroom,
fighting back tears. She declined to comment. Her lawyer issued a
statement calling the prosecution ''somewhat heavy handed.''
</P>
<P>
   Adler said he did not know where the investigation into Russian
money laundering was heading.
</P>
<P>
   ''It would be surprising and disappointing if Svetlana turns out
to be among the prize coral captured by the government in their
enormous investigation,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The plea came just a month after Kudryavtsev, originally from
Leningrad, which is now known as St. Petersburg, was identified as
a critical part of the money laundering scheme by a former Bank of
New York vice president who pleaded guilty.
</P>
<P>
   Lucy Edwards, the bank's former vice president in the Eastern
European Division, named Kudryavtsev when Edwards and her husband,
Peter Berlin, pleaded guilty last month.
</P>
<P>
   Edwards said during her plea that the couple paid Kudryavtsev
$500 a month after they moved from New York to London in 1996 to
protect the accounts used for money laundering.
</P>
<P>
   Edwards said Kudryavtsev served as a contact at the bank in the
event there were any problems with transfers. She also sent Berlin
account statements so he could calculate commissions the couple was
owed.
</P>
<P>
   Kudryavtsev was an associate in the bank's Eastern European
division in August when she was questioned by the FBI, which was
investigating several bank accounts.
</P>
<P>
   Her culpability was questioned several times during her plea by
Rakoff, who noted Kudryavtsev said she did not understand she was
doing something wrong when she received the monthly payments.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm guilty that I was given $500 a month beginning in 1996,''
she said in Russian in a soft voice.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking through an interpreter, she conceded that she lied to
investigators several times but told the judge the investigators
had come ''to the bank all of a sudden and started asking me the
questions.''
</P>
<P>
   ''I made on some questions false statements. Some questions I
just misunderstood because of the language barrier,'' she said.

<HEADLINE> Arab Leaders Grooming Their Sons  </HEADLINE>
By HAMZA HENDAWI, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   CAIRO, Egypt (AP) -- In their pursuit of absolute power, some
Arab leaders have gone to great lengths -- killing opponents,
banishing critics and convincing citizens that life couldn't be the
same without them.
</P>
<P>
   More recently, they have been experimenting with another tactic:
grooming their sons to establish ''republican dynasties'' in hopes
that their power -- or at least some of it -- remains in the family
after they're gone. In countries like Syria and Iraq the succession
moves are obvious; in other places they may be more subtle.
</P>
<P>
   Iraqi President Saddam Hussein's oldest son, Odai, won an
overwhelming victory in parliamentary elections Monday in what is
seen as his first step toward joining the power structure.
</P>
<P>
   ''They can have all the elections and parliaments they want, but
I do believe that they only exist in name if the ruler of a
republic has the ability to engineer succession for his
offspring,'' said David Mack of the Middle East Institute, a
Washington-based think tank.
</P>
<P>
   Of the 21 Arab states, eight are monarchies. Recent successions
in four of them -- Jordan, Morocco, Bahrain and Qatar -- have been
trouble-free, but the practice is yet to be tested in republics.
</P>
<P>
   The absence of a precedent, Arab and Western experts say, is a
source of serious concern in Iraq and Syria, where the presidents'
sons are seen as the heirs apparent. But how the political and
military establishments would respond to a hereditary-style
transfer of power remains uncertain.
</P>
<P>
   ''It all depends on that group of maybe 200 people around the
leader who his successor is,'' said Charles Hayman, who writes on
the Middle East for Jane's World Armies. ''If their way of life and
their perks are likely to continue, it's possible then that the
leader can nominate a successor.''
</P>
<P>
   In Syria, President Hafez Assad -- 69, ailing and in power for 30
years -- plucked his son Bashar from a career as an eye doctor to
prepare him for the presidency. Assad chose Bashar after the 1994
death of his eldest son, Basil.
</P>
<P>
   Already, Bashar Assad has acted as a personal envoy of his
father on foreign trips, led a crusade against corruption at home
and overseen affairs in Lebanon, where Syria controls policy. But
experts are divided on whether he can succeed his father without
conflict.
</P>
<P>
   ''It is not an impossibility,'' said Daniel Pipes of the
Philadelphia-based Middle East Forum think tank. ''The Alawites'' --
the fringe Muslim sect to which Assad and his family belong --
''have always stuck together and will stick together over this
one.''
</P>
<P>
   But Al Venter, a Washington-based Middle East expert, points to
history in saying a smooth succession is unlikely. In 1983, Assad
was recovering from a heart attack when his brother and deputy,
Rifaat, launched a foiled attempt to seize power.
</P>
<P>
   Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak, in power since 1981, recently
named his younger son Gamal as a member of the general secretariat
of his ruling National Democratic Party. Analysts don't rule out a
career in politics for Gamal, an economist in his 30s.
</P>
<P>
   In Libya, Moammar Gadhafi's sons Al-Saadi and Seif al-Islam have
been assuming larger public roles, standing in for their father at
some public occasions.
</P>
<P>
   Yemeni President Ahmed Ali Abdullah Saleh's son, Ahmed, 30, is
an army colonel and has been a parliament member since 1997. He is
rumored to be a possible successor to his father.
</P>
<P>
   Hayman and other experts see the potential for conflict in
rivalries between possible successors, such as in Iraq -- where
Saddam's younger son Qusai also is in an influential position.
</P>
<P>
   For more than a decade, Odai has maintained a high profile as
newspaper publisher, owner of a TV station and head of the
journalists' union and a paramilitary force. Qusai has shunned the
limelight while effectively leading the Republican Guard, an elite
army corps, and has a firm grip on security and intelligence
agencies.
</P>
<P>
   ''The rivalry between the two brothers is explosive,'' said
Mohammed Bahr el-Eloum, a London-based Iraqi dissident.
</P>
<P>
   Now that he has won a seat in Parliament, Odai could become
parliament speaker -- a job that will allow him to sit on the
all-powerful Revolutionary Command Council headed by his father.
</P>
<P>
   But Bahr el-Eloum and other Iraqi dissidents said they doubt
Odai's landslide victory has put an end to the succession race,
arguing that his victory may actually stoke the rivalry between the
two brothers now that both wield considerable powers.
</P>
<P>
   While Qusai currently enjoys wider powers through his role in
the military and security forces, Odai could bolster his own
influence by turning Parliament, a toothless body that only
recommends policy, into a valuable power base.

	   BEIJING (AP) -- With the two countries at odds over Taiwan and human rights,
China's foreign minister told U.S. National Security Adviser Sandy Berger today
that ties between Beijing and Washington are at a "critical juncture." Foreign
Minister Tang Jiaxuan expressed hope at the start of their talks that Berger
would personally play a constructive role to help China-U.S. ties improve and
develop. "You are our old friend," Tang said. "Every time China-U.S. relations
reach a critical stage, you play a positive role. And now our relationship is at

Memory Problems Connected to Chemotherapy
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
	   TAMPA, Fla. (AP) -- Ordinary doses of chemotherapy sometimes appear to leave
patients with poor memories, muddy thinking and inability to do math in their
heads, new research suggests. Cancer patients often complain of "chemobrain"
during treatment. While they are typically reassured this will go away, little
attempt has been made until now to see if these subtle problems linger years
later. The new study, conducted at Dartmouth Medical School, found that people
who get standard chemotherapy appear to be about twice as likely as other cancer
patients to score poorly on various intelligence tests an average of 10 years

prices by 11 cents to 18 cents a gallon by late summer. Ignoring objections from

<HEADLINE> Texas Tornadoes Kill Four  </HEADLINE>
By STEPHEN HAWKINS, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   FORT WORTH, Texas (AP) -- Two tornadoes carved paths of
destruction through the Fort Worth area on Tuesday, shattering
windows in high-rise buildings, overturning cars and uprooting
trees. At least four people were killed and more than 100 injured.
</P>
<P>
   City officials urged people who work downtown to stay home
Wednesday. Firefighters planned to continue their floor-by-floor
work at daybreak.
</P>
<P>
   ''We have a number of high-rise buildings that have sustained
heavy damage,'' said Lt. Kent Worley, a spokesman for the Fort
Worth Fire Department. ''They looked like they did not have a
single pane of glass left in them.''
</P>
<P>
   Worley said two people died in one of the tornadoes. One victim
was inside a building that collapsed, and another was hit by flying
debris.
</P>
<P>
   Strong winds blew two other people from their car into the
Trinity River. Worley said their bodies had not been found and they
were presumed dead. A search will resume Wednesday morning.
</P>
<P>
   The manager of a popular restaurant on the top floor of the
35-story Bank One building said his business was destroyed.
</P>
<P>
   ''Imagine a large bomb going off,'' Sean Finley said. ''It got
pretty hectic in here.''
</P>
<P>
   Patrons and employees had to go down 35 flights of stairs to
safety.
</P>
<P>
   Based on reports from tornado spotters, Fire Chief Larry
McMillen said, the storm spawned two tornadoes. One took a
northerly route, while the second moved southeast through downtown.
</P>
<P>
   The tornadoes hit shortly after 6:30 p.m. amid severe
thunderstorms that were accompanied by torrential rains,
softball-sized hail and strong winds.
</P>
<P>
   By early Wednesday, virtually all of those injured in the storms
had been treated and released from area hospitals. Of the six who
remained in hospitals, three were in critical condition.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's somewhat of a miracle that there aren't more injuries
than we've found out about so far,'' Fort Worth Mayor Kenneth Barr
said at a news conference with other city officials.
</P>
<P>
   TXU Electric and Gas reported about 30,000 customers were
without power. Fort Worth is a city of about 480,000 people, 30
miles west of Dallas.
</P>
<P>
   At the downtown Renaissance Worthington Hotel, windows were
broken out in about 12 guest rooms and the public area, manager Bob
Jameson said.
</P>
<P>
   Robert and Wendi Sparlins were eating dinner downtown to
celebrate their second anniversary on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   ''The windows starting popping, people were running trying to
get under the table,'' Robert Sparlins said. ''I saw a chair in the
straight line winds going down the street.''
</P>
<P>
   Katrina Weston of Arlington, just east of Fort Worth, told
WFAA-TV that when she opened the door of her house, she saw the
storm blowing shingles off her roof.
</P>
<P>
   ''We have no back fence at all, it literally wiped paint off the
back of the house,'' she said. ''There are sirens everywhere and we
have no power.''
</P>
<P>
   One side of the Calvary Cathedral International suffered major
damage. Pastor Bob Nichols said his damaged church looks like it
had been ''in a war zone.''
</P>
<P>
   ''We just know God's going to bring us out stronger,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The storms delayed some flights at Dallas-Fort Worth
International Airport.
</P>
<P>
   ''As a precaution, we evacuated the passengers in the Delta
terminal to the tunnels,'' said Harmony Sockman, a spokeswoman for
Delta Air Lines in Atlanta. ''When everything was safe, we brought
everyone back up to the terminal.''

<HEADLINE> Danang Marks War Anniversary  </HEADLINE>
By TINI TRAN, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   DANANG, Vietnam (AP) -- Clusters of multicolored balloons filled
the air while hundreds of troops paraded past a giant soldier's
memorial today as Danang commemorated the 25th anniversary of the
communist ''liberation'' of the city.
</P>
<P>
   The celebration in this former U.S. military base, marking the
second-most strategic capture of the last days of the Vietnam War,
drew 15,000 spectators and performers.
</P>
<P>
   Decorated floats and costumed performers streamed through
Danang's public square during the two-hour event, televised live
nationally. Army, air force, navy and militia troops marched past a
war memorial inscribed, ''The nation remembers their
contributions.''
</P>
<P>
   The 1965 landing of U.S. troops in Danang marked the United
States' official entry into the war. On March 29, 1975, Danang --
the largest military base north of Saigon -- became the third city
to fall as communist forces advanced down the coastline in an
aggressive offensive that ended April 30 with the capture of the
South Vietnamese capital.
</P>
<P>
   That victory reunited the country and ended the conflict that
killed 58,000 Americans and 3 million Vietnamese.
</P>
<P>
   Underscoring the significance of the Danang victory, those
attending today's event included former Prime Minister Vo Van Kiet,
Vice President Nguyen Thi Binh and Gen. Van Tien Dung, the North
Vietnamese commander who led the campaign to capture Saigon.
</P>
<P>
   ''The liberation of Danang pushed the Saigon government into a
desperate situation and disintegration, providing an important
contribution to our final victory in spring 1975,'' Mayor Nguyen Ba
Thanh said. ''Our massive attack, which lasted 30 hours, smashed
one of the U.S.'s strongest military bases in Vietnam.''
</P>
<P>
   Col. Nguyen Ngoc Phi, now 75, led the forces that took over the
city and hoisted a communist flag over the government building
shortly before noon on that March 29.
</P>
<P>
   ''The city was in chaos,'' he said. ''The Saigon army tried to
evacuate with their families, and they ran, leaving their weapons
and uniforms behind.''
</P>
<P>
   Danang fell with no bloodshed as Southern troops and their
families frantically sought escape via boat, plane or road. The
port was chaotic as overcrowded barges and boats carried some of
the half-million people trying to flee the advancing troops.
</P>
<P>
   A quarter century later, the frenzy was repeated -- without the
fear -- as hundreds of flag-festooned boats lined up Tuesday for a
spirited race that kicked off the celebrations.
</P>
<P>
   Danang had been a flurry of festive activity in recent days,
with red and yellow flags and colored banners planted along every
corner. Performers practicing for the parade filled the streets
with music and dance.
</P>
<P>
   The Vietnamese government, in an effort to boost patriotism as
its leadership faces a crisis in confidence, has been holding large
and lively celebrations in each of the cities taken during the
spring of 1975. Today's event was the biggest yet.
</P>
<P>
   During the war, Danang was a major base for U.S. troops, with
the nearby white sands of China Beach a favorite rest and
relaxation spot.
</P>
<P>
   Boosted by its shipping port and manufacturing industry, the
city has since doubled in population to 700,000, becoming one of
Vietnam's four largest cities.
</P>
<P>
   Danang is under a constant dust cloud as construction crews
widen roads, and scaffolding covers many new homes along the
roadside. As part of anniversary festivities, the city will
officially inaugurate a third bridge spanning the Han River and a
cable car system from the mountainous Ba Na resort area.
</P>
<P>
   ''You can say that Danang is a construction project these
days,'' Vice Mayor Nguyen Hoang Long said. ''Anyone who lived here
25 years won't recognize it anymore.''
</P>
<P>
   After years of wartime sacrifice, the dividends of peace have
paid off, said Pham Trung Kien, a 23-year-old soldier when the war
ended.
</P>
<P>
   ''Things were tough after the war, but I think my son will have
a brighter future than me,'' Kien said of 6-year-old Hien, who won
a student drawing contest held in conjunction with the anniversary.
</P>
<P>
   ''I believe he will enjoy a life of peace, not like me, who
experienced the destruction and misery of war,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> Senate Unveils $1.83T 2001 Budget  </HEADLINE>
By ALAN FRAM, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Democrats say a Republican-written $1.83
trillion budget for next year cuts taxes and domestic programs too
deeply, but there is little they can do to prevent the Senate
Budget Committee from approving it.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Pete Domenici, R-N.M., the panel's chairman, planned to
push the measure through his panel today. Passage was virtually
assured after conservatives won some concessions on procedures that
control spending and agreed to support the blueprint.
</P>
<P>
   ''I have a budget that will pass,'' Domenici said Tuesday as he
unveiled his plan.
</P>
<P>
   Though largely similar to a budget the House approved last week,
the Senate measure would allow smaller tax cuts than the House's
version. It would also cut taxes and domestic programs further than
President Clinton wants.
</P>
<P>
   ''We will not support plans ... that abandon fiscal discipline
and threaten our economic prosperity,'' said Sen. Frank Lautenberg
of New Jersey, the committee's top Democrat.
</P>
<P>
   The budget, which does not need the president's signature, sets
overall tax and spending totals for the year, but leaves decisions
on details for later bills.
</P>
<P>
   While both the House and Senate fiscal blueprints plan at least
$150 billion in tax cuts over the next five years, Domenici's
package would give lawmakers leeway to increase those reductions to
up to $190 billion. The House measure would permit a maximum of
$240 billion in lower levies, reflecting a stronger pro-tax cut
sentiment among Republicans there.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Frank Lautenberg of New Jersey, the top Democrat on the
budget committee, noted that Domenici's tax cut is smaller than the
five-year, $483 billion reduction proposed by George W. Bush, the
GOP's apparent presidential nominee.
</P>
<P>
   Domenici's decision to have a smaller reduction ''does send a
powerful statement, and it should help Americans understand just
how extreme the Bush tax program is,'' Lautenberg said.
</P>
<P>
   The two tax plans are not directly comparable because they cover
slightly different five-year periods, but Bush's is clearly larger.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton proposed $99 billion in tax cuts through 2005 -- nearly
completely offset by $96 billion in higher taxes on cigarettes and
some businesses.
</P>
<P>
   Domenici's budget would also set aside $20 billion over five
years to create a prescription drug benefit for Medicare recipients
or otherwise change the program. The House budget allowed $40
billion.
</P>
<P>
   Both the House and Senate budgets would use the nearly $1
trillion in Social Security surpluses expected through 2005 for
debt reduction, just as Clinton would do.
</P>
<P>
   Both would also provide $307 billion for defense spending next
year, $1 billion more than Clinton proposed. And they would set
aside $290 billion for domestic programs, nearly $30 billion below
Clinton's request.
</P>
<P>
   They also recommend increases for education and scientific
research, and extra money this year and next for farmers.

<HEADLINE> Senate To Vote on Flag Amendment  </HEADLINE>
By JIM ABRAMS, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Senate stands as the only obstacle -- but a
big one -- to a constitutional amendment banning flag desecration.
Exhorted to ''do something great,'' but warned of the consequences
to free speech, the Senate is expected once again to kill the
amendment.
</P>
<P>
   The House last year approved the amendment by more than the
needed two-thirds majority, but the Senate outcome is expected to
be similar to a 1995 attempt that fell three votes shy. The vote
could come today.
</P>
<P>
   A constitutional amendment must also be ratified by
three-fourths of state legislatures. That step would be a near
certainty if the effort cleared the Senate because every state
except Vermont has passed resolutions urging Congress to approve
the amendment.
</P>
<P>
   The move to amend the Constitution grows out of two 5-4 Supreme
Court decisions, one in 1989 striking down a Texas flag desecration
law, and another in 1990 ruling that a federal law was
unconstitutional because it infringed on free speech rights.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Orrin Hatch, R-Utah, speaking to veterans who support the
amendment, said it was needed because the flag is the nation's
unique symbol of unity and sovereignty. ''This debate is about
whether the Congress can do something great and extraordinary to
restore the power to Congress to protect the flag.''
</P>
<P>
   But opponents argued attacks on the flag are rare and a
constitutional prohibition against desecration would be an
unprecedented weakening of the First Amendment guarantee of freedom
of speech.
</P>
<P>
   ''We do not consecrate the flag by punishing its desecration,
for by doing so we dilute the freedom that this cherished emblem
represents,'' said Sen. Paul Wellstone, D-Minn.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Russell Feingold, D-Wis., also warned of serious law
enforcement problems, showing a photo of soccer fans waving a flag
on which they had written ''thanks girls'' after the U.S. women's
team won the world championship. He wondered if that would qualify
as criminal desecration.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, one of four Republicans who
voted against the amendment in 1995, proposed that flag desecration
be handled through legal statute rather than constitutional change,
but his proposal was defeated 64-36.
</P>
<P>
   The Senate also rejected, 67-33, a measure offered by Sen.
Ernest Hollings, D-S.C., that would have added language to the
amendment also giving Congress the authority to pass laws limiting
campaign spending.
</P>
<P>
   Including the 10 articles of the Bill of Rights, the
Constitution has only been amended 27 times. Since taking control
of Congress in 1995, Republicans have pushed constitutional
amendments on a wide range of issues, including a balanced budget,
term limits, the line item veto, school prayer and super-majorities
for tax increases, but have yet to send an amendment to the states.

<HEADLINE> Lott To Block Colombia, Kosovo Bill  </HEADLINE>
By ALAN FRAM, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Top House Republicans say a $9 billion package
bearing money for U.S. action in Colombia and Kosovo is needed now.
But in the Senate, Majority Leader Trent Lott says the money can
wait a couple of months.
</P>
<P>
   The House planned to debate the measure today, and members of
both parties predicted passage despite opposition by many
conservatives who said it is too expensive. The measure is nearly
double the $5.2 billion President Clinton requested.
</P>
<P>
   ''We consider this essential ... to the whole stability of our
hemisphere,'' House Majority Leader Dick Armey, R-Texas, said
Tuesday of the $1.7 billion the package contains to help the
Colombian government battle drug traffickers and strengthen its
tenuous hold on the country.
</P>
<P>
   Colombia provides most of the cocaine and heroin used in the
United States, U.S. officials say.
</P>
<P>
   If anything, the measure is expected to grow even larger.
Pro-defense lawmakers, backed by House GOP leaders, were planning
to try adding $4 billion in extra spending for the Pentagon.
</P>
<P>
   In the Senate, however, Lott said he would to try to block the
legislation, dampening prospects that Congress will provide the
money quickly.
</P>
<P>
   He said he wants to provide money for Colombia, U.S.
peacekeeping troops in Kosovo, and aid to East Coast victims of
last fall's Hurricane Floyd. But he said he would take that money,
shrink the rest of the legislation and include what is left in
regular spending bills for fiscal 2001, which begins Oct. 1.
</P>
<P>
   Congress will probably work on those bills into the fall. But
Lott said he hopes the money can be provided in one of them and
approved within the next two months.
</P>
<P>
   Lott said the bill has become ''bloated,'' adding, ''I don't
think we should begin the year in that way.''
</P>
<P>
   No sooner had Lott spoken, however, when the Clinton
administration and members of the Senate Appropriations Committee
began pressuring him to relent.
</P>
<P>
   White House budget chief Jack Lew wrote congressional leaders
that the bill is ''time-sensitive.'' He warned that without quick
approval, the Pentagon would have to curtail training and
maintenance, and victims of Hurricane Floyd ''may have to spend a
second winter in temporary shelters.''
</P>
<P>
   Senate Appropriations Committee Chairman Ted Stevens, R-Alaska,
said he would try pushing his version of the $9 billion bill
through his panel next Tuesday, despite Lott's remarks. Stevens,
who met later with Lott, said he ''didn't ask'' whether Lott would
allow the bill to come to the Senate floor.
</P>
<P>
   The House bill would provide the $2 billion the president wants
for U.S. troops in Kosovo, and nearly twice the $1.1 billion
Clinton requested for Hurricane Floyd and other domestic natural
disasters.
</P>
<P>
   It also has far more for farmers, the Defense Department and
other items than Clinton requested.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Clinton asked Congress on Tuesday to add $253 million
more to the package. The money would be for people who contracted
the HIV virus through blood transfusions, summer jobs for
teenagers, administrative costs of legislation that lets many
elderly people keep their full Social Security benefits and other
items.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the overall bill would be paid for from the budget
surplus. Clinton proposed paying for the new $253 million from
unused federal spending, including money for the Y2K computer
problem.

   But in January, appalled at President Clinton's decision to ask
Congress for $1.6 billion over two years in counterdrug assistance
to Colombia, Salcedo decided he must register a protest: He mailed
his medal to the White House.
</P>
<P>
   Salcedo believes efforts to interdict drug flows from South
America are futile. The money, he says, would be better spent on
treating drug addicts at home.
</P>
<P>
   The House was due to take up the Clinton proposal today, and
Salcedo, who lives in New York City, was planning to be on hand,
hoping to influence undecided lawmakers.
</P>
<P>
   A key component of the aid package is 63 helicopters, designed
to provide mobility for Colombia's counterdrug effort.
</P>
<P>
   ''Its chances for success are ridiculous,'' Salcedo said in a
recent telephone interview. ''It's impractical. ...There are just
too many variables beyond our control.''
</P>
<P>
   Accompanying the medal he received was a certificate that cited
his ''professional achievement in the superior performance of his
duties'' and his ''exceptional diplomatic aplomb.''
</P>
<P>
   He has seen the drug problem from both ends of the pipeline --
from the supply side in Latin America and the demand side in
Boston, where he worked for a time as a Spanish teacher in a low
income area.
</P>
<P>
   He received the medal after serving about 2{ years with Joint
Task Force Six, a Pentagon unit that provides military specialists
to law enforcement agencies. His assignment, among other goals, was
to penetrate drug gangs.
</P>
<P>
   Salcedo said he mailed the medal to the White House public
liaison office. He has tried through e-mail and phone calls to
communicate with that office, but without success.
</P>
<P>
   His view has some support in the House, but probably not enough
to block the aid proposal, which is part of a $9 billion aid
package that also includes money for Kosovo and other programs.
</P>
<P>
   Among Salcedo's allies is Rep. Janice Schakowsky, D-Ill., who
said recently, ''Treatment is 10 times more effective than drug
interdiction schemes.''
</P>
<P>
   And a GAO study last year showed that cocaine availability in
the United States was unaffected by record cocaine seizures in
Colombia in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   Another ally of Salcedo's is Robert White, a former ambassador
to El Salvador and now president of the Center for International
Policy. The Clinton administration, says White, has yet to explain
''what is at stake in Colombia or how massive military assistance
can do anything but make matters worse.''
</P>
<P>
   But critics of the proposal face an uphill battle. Most
lawmakers, especially Republicans, agree with Clinton that with the
nation awash in drugs, decisive action is called for.
</P>
<P>
   The United States, Clinton said recently, is a lot better off
trying to help Colombia ''fight narcotics there and keep more drugs
out of this country, than if we walk away from it.

<HEADLINE> Military Stockpiles 'Expired' Drugs  </HEADLINE>
By DAVID HO, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The military is using expired medications
under a testing program that found the drugs often remained safe
and potent years beyond the manufacturer's recommended shelf life.
</P>
<P>
   To avoid the cost of regularly replacing its massive stockpile
of medicine, the Air Force asked the Food and Drug Administration
in 1985 to see if it could extend the effective lifetimes of the
drugs it purchased, Pentagon spokesman Kenneth Bacon said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   ''The FDA did this and found basically that the expiration dates
tended to be very conservative, and as a result, many of these
drugs could have a much longer shelf life than the manufacturer
said,'' Bacon said.
</P>
<P>
   Under the Shelf Life Extension Program, the FDA tested more than
100 drugs, prescription and over-the-counter, and found that 90
percent of them were safe beyond the expiration date. The drugs
were tested by either the manufacturer or the FDA, but always with
FDA supervision.
</P>
<P>
   In 1998, the last year for which figures were available, the
military spent $664,000 to have drugs tested and saved $49.3
million by not purchasing replacements, Bacon said.
</P>
<P>
   But consumers shouldn't assume their expired drugs are still
safe and effective because, unlike prescriptions sitting in
medicine cabinets, the military's stockpile has remained sealed in
the manufacturer's original packaging, said Thomas McGinnis, the
FDA's director of pharmacy affairs.
</P>
<P>
   ''The chance of the product not degrading from moisture or heat
or light exposure is much better than what consumers get when they
bring home a medication from a pharmacy in these amber vials with
childproof caps,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Keeping old drugs around can also be confusing and increases the
risk that a person will accidentally take the wrong medication,
McGinnis said. He added that consumers should discard drugs when
their course of treatment is finished.
</P>
<P>
   The military buys about $1.2 billion in prescription and
nonprescription drugs every year, and needs reserves that can be
drawn upon in large quantities in wartime, Bacon said.
</P>
<P>
   Many of the drugs also are used to take care of families,
retirees and others as part of the military's health care program.
</P>
<P>
   Francis Flaherty, a former director of FDA's military drug
testing program, said his experience with the program showed him
that a manufacturer's expiration date doesn't indicate anything
about a drug's effectiveness, The Wall Street Journal quoted him as
saying in Tuesday's editions.
</P>
<P>
   ''Manufacturers put expiration dates on for marketing, rather
than scientific reasons,'' he said. ''It's not profitable for them
to have products on a shelf for 10 years. They want turnover.''

<HEADLINE> Lessons From Twisters of 1999  </HEADLINE>
By LIBBY QUAID, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- They can't stop Mother Nature, but for a
relatively small sum, people in tornado-prone areas can better
protect their families and belongings from twisters, says the
government's disaster relief chief.
</P>
<P>
   Homeowners can raise the odds of surviving tornadoes by spending
$1,000 to $2,000 to reinforce their houses while local governments
can help by adopting better building codes and wind engineering
standards, said James Lee Witt, director of the Federal Emergency
Management Agency.
</P>
<P>
   ''We cannot control the weather, but we can in many cases
control its effects on people,'' Witt said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   He released recommendations resulting from a study of more than
70 tornadoes that swept from Texas to the Northern Plains in May,
killing 49 people in Oklahoma and Kansas and injuring at least 800
others.
</P>
<P>
   The estimated $1.5 billion in damage made the outbreak the
costliest in U.S. history, and the agency sent engineers and
architects to Oklahoma and Kansas to see why buildings failed or
withstood the onslaught.
</P>
<P>
   ''Unlike what many of us believe, we do not have to be helpless
victims in the face of even the most violent tornadoes,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The agency recommended:
</P>
<P>
   --Retrofitting garage doors, particularly two-car doors, to
strengthen them against high winds. At a news conference, Witt used
a computer simulation to demonstrate how strong winds can rip a
two-car garage from its foundation and cut a wide swath through the
central portion of a house that is not built to comply with newer
codes and engineering standards.
</P>
<P>
   --Strengthening masonry chimneys with vertical reinforcement
steel in the corners.
</P>
<P>
   --Reinforcing double entry doors and bracing the ends of gable
roofs, and, for businesses, securing metal siding and roofs.
</P>
<P>
   --Securely anchoring mobile homes or, even better, placing them
on permanent foundations.
</P>
<P>
   --Building steel-reinforced, closet-sized ''safe rooms.''

<HEADLINE> Heston Speech Attracts Protesters  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   WALTHAM, Mass. (AP) -- Charlton Heston's speech at Brandeis
University attracted hundreds of protesters, including some who lay
on the pavement, fake blood oozing from fake gunshot wounds.
</P>
<P>
   ''Political correctness is tyranny with manners,'' Heston told
the crowd of about 700 students, administrators and members of the
community in a speech at the university's student center Tuesday
night.
</P>
<P>
   Heston, the president of the National Rifle Association, told
the crowd to ''question authority'' when it comes to gun control
laws.
</P>
<P>
   Before Heston's address, protesters -- most of them students --
chanted anti-gun slogans and waved signs outside during a rally
sponsored by the American Jewish Congress.
</P>
<P>
   Congress President Sumner Kaplan railed against the NRA's
resistance to stricter gun control measures.
</P>
<P>
   ''The blood of innocents -- children or adults -- by the illegal,
inadvertent and improper use of guns ... it's cause for
revulsion,'' he said. ''The Second Amendment was never meant to
condone lawlessness.''
</P>
<P>
   Pro-NRA demonstrators were also on hand to air their views. Tim
Labbe, 31, said he came to support Heston.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm here to stand up for the rights of citizens to keep the
Second Amendment,'' he said.

<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- When Judy Chase won two tickets to watch her
beloved New York Mets open the baseball season in Japan at the ESPN
Zone restaurant today, she immediately picked her 8-year-old son,
Jesse, to go with her.
</P>
<P>
   She wasn't concerned about whether the fellow diehard would want
to go. What concerned her was whether he could wake up in time to
catch the game's start -- before dawn in New York -- and then stay
awake for a few innings.
</P>
<P>
   New York hurler Mike Hampton tossed the game's first pitch at
5:06 a.m. EST, which was just after 7 p.m. in Tokyo.
</P>
<P>
   ''I figured I'd give him some soda,'' Chase, 37, said of her
son, whose last name is Friedman and who was headed to school later
in the day.
</P>
<P>
   Coffee was the beverage of choice for most of the other 150-plus
people attending the Opening Day bonanza, which was sponsored by
two of New York's top sports media outlets, ESPN and WFAN sports
talk radio.
</P>
<P>
   About 75 people won tickets for two by calling the radio station
in recent weeks, while a handful of others, including one from
Montreal, got theirs via the station's Web site.
</P>
<P>
   ''I didn't go to sleep,'' said a proud Dave Gaylinn, 23, of
Hackensack, N.J., who arrived just before 4 a.m. to take the first
spot in line. ''I don't need much sleep -- I'm unemployed right
now.''
</P>
<P>
   A similar scene was taking place a block away in Times Square at
the All Star Cafe, where more Mets fans went to watch Major League
Baseball's opening game -- held in Japan to promote the sport.
</P>
<P>
   Cheers erupted at the ESPN Zone when Hampton's first pitch
landed for a strike in catcher Mike Piazza's glove. The crowd was
temporarily silenced when the Chicago Cubs scored the game's first
run, but the boisterous group sounded off when the Mets' infield
turned a double play moments later.
</P>
<P>
   Joe Benigno, an overnight host at WFAN, said New York fans have
just been waiting for the season to start because they are excited
about their team's potential.
</P>
<P>
   ''But it's typical of any hardcore baseball fans,'' Benigno
said. ''If the Yankees were playing in Japan, the place would be
packed, too.''
</P>
<P>
   Ralph Armstead Jr., 34, and his father, both of whom live in
Freehold, N.J., said he makes it a point to watch every Opening
Day. Like many of the people there, Armstead was dressed in his
finest Mets regalia.
</P>
<P>
   ''This makes it so much better,'' he said as his father, Ralph
Armstead Sr., 61, sat down with a small plateful of donuts in their
booth. ''I'm around Mets fans, and I've never been to the
restaurant before.''

<HEADLINE> NY state sells 2 nuclear plants for $967 million  </HEADLINE>
By LARRY McSHANE, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- It took a week and endless hours of haggling,
but New York power officials finally received their price for a
pair of state-owned nuclear plants: a record $967 million.
</P>
<P>
   The sale, the largest privatization of state assets in New York
history, was reached Tuesday afternoon after a last-minute revised
offer by Entergy Nuclear Inc.
</P>
<P>
   The New Orleans company won out over its lone competitor,
Dominion Resources Inc., for the Indian Point 3 nuclear unit in
Buchanan and the James A. Fitzpatrick nuclear site in Oswego.
</P>
<P>
   ''We thank you for the trust you've shown in us,'' said Jerry
Yelverton, chairman and CEO of Entergy Nuclear. ''We'll come in and
bring all the expertise we have, and maintain your expertise.''
</P>
<P>
   The Richmond, Va.-based Dominion, insisting its bid was actually
higher than Entergy's, said it would consider legal action against
the New York Power Authority over the sale.
</P>
<P>
   Both Dominion and Entergy submitted updated bids on Tuesday
morning, one week after NYPA officials debated for 11 hours without
reaching a decision between the two suitors. The debate continued
for another four hours Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is one of the most complex things I've ever seen,'' said
Power Authority chairman and CEO C.D. Rappleyea. ''Both of these
offers were very significant. But to me an offer doesn't mean
anything unless you can close it.''
</P>
<P>
   The purchase price includes nuclear fuel and 1,700 staffers. As
part of the agreement, Entergy agreed to accept full responsibility
for possible tax liability over the plants' decommissioning fund --
a potential $250 million tab.
</P>
<P>
   Dominion called the possible tax bill a deal breaker, although
the company's head complained that state officials were too
impatient.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's a shame that NYPA was unwilling to wait for our company
to resolve the tax issue, and selected a competing bid that offered
less cash,'' said Thos. E. Capps, president and CEO of Dominion.
</P>
<P>
   Although advisers to the authority put Dominion's bid at $21
million less than Entergy put up, the company insisted that was the
result of convoluted math and called their bid $35 million better.
</P>
<P>
   Asked about possible legal action, Dominion spokesman Mark
Lazenby said, ''We're looking at all options.''
</P>
<P>
   Either way, the cost of $536 per kilowatt was almost four times
as high as the previous best sale of a nuclear plant, establishing
a new benchmark, officials said.
</P>
<P>
   Dominion made an unsolicited bid for the two plants in February,
three months after state officials began negotiating exclusively
with Entergy. The bidding was reopened, with the two companies
battling for control of the plants.
</P>
<P>
   Entergy now owns seven nuclear plants, making it the
second-largest owner of nuclear stations in the United States. The
sale still requires the approval of the Nuclear Regulatory
Commission.
</P>
<P>
   Yelverton said Tuesday that Entergy would also ''very much like
to buy'' the Indian Point 2 plant, adjacent to Indian Point 3, from
Con Edison. That plant is currently idle because of an accident
last month that resulted in a minor release of radioactive steam.
</P>
<P>
   Con Ed, which once spoke of reopening Indian Point 2 by late
March, indicated Tuesday that the plant will remain closed much
longer. Officials said its current inspection has found so many
flawed tubes in its steam generator that it will have to get NRC
permission to restart, which can take weeks or months.

<HEADLINE> Poll: Giuliani-Clinton dead heat; mayor hurt by Dorismond shooting  </HEADLINE>
By MARC HUMBERT, AP Political Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) -- With voters overwhelmingly disapproving of
Mayor Rudolph Giuliani's handling of the fatal shooting by New York
City police of an unarmed man, his Senate race against Hillary
Rodham Clinton has become a dead heat, a statewide poll reported
today.
</P>
<P>
   The poll, from Marist College's Institute for Public Opinion,
had the Republican mayor of New York City favored by 46 percent of
registered voters and the first lady backed by 43 percent, a
statistical tie given the poll's error margin.
</P>
<P>
   With one exception -- in October, when the Marist poll had
Giuliani at 46 percent and Clinton at 42 percent, also a
statistical tie -- the mayor has been leading the first lady in the
Marist poll since July of last year.
</P>
<P>
   A New York Post poll, out Sunday from Zogby International, also
showed the race had become a statistical dead heat, erasing an
earlier lead held by the mayor.
</P>
<P>
   Once again, the latest poll from Marist showed a relatively
small number of undecided voters, 11 percent statewide, with the
election still more than seven months away. When those undecided
voters were pressed to make a choice, the race remained a tie, with
Giuliani at 48 percent and Clinton at 46 percent with 6 percent
still undecided.
</P>
<P>
   The Poughkeepsie-based pollsters found that 50 percent of voters
disapproved of the mayor's handling of the shooting of Patrick
Dorismond. Twenty-six percent said they approved of how the mayor
handled that.
</P>
<P>
   The mayor has come under heavy criticism for releasing criminal
records about Dorismond, including sealed juvenile records, in the
wake of the police shooting.
</P>
<P>
   In New York City, 72 percent of voters disapproved of the
mayor's handling of the situation with just 18 percent backing him.
Only in the suburban counties surrounding the city was the mayor's
handling of the case not a major negative for him, with 40 percent
disapproving and 38 percent approving, a statistical tie.
</P>
<P>
   The telephone poll of 561 registered voters was conducted Monday
and Tuesday and has a margin of error of plus or minus 4 percentage
points.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, a leader in New York's politically important Orthodox
Jewish community, state Assemblyman Dov Hikind, is calling for an
alternative to Clinton and Giuliani in New York's Senate race.
</P>
<P>
   ''People are dissatisfied with both Hillary and Giuliani. We
must find a senatorial candidate acceptable to more people,''
Hikind wrote in a letter Tuesday to state Conservative Party
Chairman Michael Long.
</P>
<P>
   Long described Hikind's interest in an alternative candidate as
''great'' and said it represented ''a significant crack in the dam
of both campaigns.''
</P>
<P>
   Long said he believes many Republicans and Democrats would like
other choices in the Senate race.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, Hikind and Long are not alone in their desire to have
other candidates step forward.
</P>
<P>
   A poll conducted last month by Marist College's Institute for
Public Opinion found that 50 percent of registered voters surveyed
statewide would like to see someone else run. Forty-six percent of
voters said they were satisfied with the choices.
</P>
<P>
   Hikind has been critical of the first lady for not supporting
the release of jailed Israeli spy Jonathan Pollard. And while the
Brooklyn Democrat once was a political supporter of Giuliani,
Hikind blames the Republican mayor for his indictment more than two
years ago on federal charges that the assemblyman diverted public
funds to personal uses. Hikind was acquitted by a federal jury in
July 1998.
</P>
<P>
   Long has said the Conservative Party will not back Giuliani
unless the mayor comes out for a legal ban on what critics call
''partial-birth'' abortions. Giuliani, an abortion-rights
supporter, has refused to do so.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike other states, New York allows major party candidates to
also collect votes on third-party ballot lines and no Republican
has won statewide office in New York in more than 25 years without
Conservative Party support.
</P>
<P>
   Long said Tuesday that he believes a credible alternative
candidate will step forward before the end of April. He has been
talking with leaders of the Reform Party-linked New York
Independence Party and the antiabortion Right to Life Party about
fielding a fusion candidate on all three ballot lines.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday, Giuliani was raising money in Washington at a
reception hosted by power couple Susan Molinari and Bill Paxon, two
former New York members of Congress. Clinton was in California,
also raising money.

<HEADLINE> Byrd Changes Vote on Flag Amendment  </HEADLINE>
Byrd Changes Vote on Flag Amendment   
By JIM ABRAMS, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Senate stands as the only obstacle -- but a
big one -- to a constitutional amendment banning flag desecration.
Exhorted to ''do something great,'' but warned of the consequences
to free speech, the Senate is expected once again to kill the
amendment.
</P>
<P>
   The House last year approved the amendment by more than the
needed two-thirds majority, but the Senate outcome is expected to
be similar to a 1995 attempt that fell three votes shy. The vote
could come today.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Robert Byrd, D-W.Va., who voted for the amendment in 1995,
on Tuesday told a gathering of the American Legion, a strong
advocate of the measure, that he had changed his mind because it
''may be unintentionally detrimental to the freedoms we all so
zealously guard.''
</P>
<P>
   Byrd, on hand to receive a distinguished-citizens award from the
veterans group, deplored what he said was a tendency of Congress to
amend the Constitution as a first rather than a last resort.
''Within this trend lies the seeds of the complete undoing of the
noble work of the founding fathers,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   A constitutional amendment must also be ratified by
three-fourths of state legislatures. That step would be a near
certainty if the effort cleared the Senate because every state
except Vermont has passed resolutions urging Congress to approve
the amendment.
</P>
<P>
   The move to amend the Constitution grows out of two 5-4 Supreme
Court decisions, one in 1989 striking down a Texas flag desecration
law, and another in 1990 ruling that a federal law was
unconstitutional because it infringed on free speech rights.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Orrin Hatch, R-Utah, speaking to veterans who support the
amendment, said it was needed because the flag is the nation's
unique symbol of unity and sovereignty. ''This debate is about
whether the Congress can do something great and extraordinary to
restore the power to Congress to protect the flag.''
</P>
<P>
   But opponents argued attacks on the flag are rare and a
constitutional prohibition against desecration would be an
unprecedented weakening of the First Amendment guarantee of freedom
of speech.
</P>
<P>
   ''We do not consecrate the flag by punishing its desecration,
for by doing so we dilute the freedom that this cherished emblem
represents,'' said Sen. Paul Wellstone, D-Minn.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Russell Feingold, D-Wis., also warned of serious law

as criminal desecration.

<P>
   Sen. Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, one of four Republicans who
voted against the amendment in 1995, proposed that flag desecration
be handled through legal statute rather than constitutional change,
but his proposal was defeated 64-36.

   The Senate also rejected, 67-33, a measure offered by Sen.
Ernest Hollings, D-S.C., that would have added language to the
amendment also giving Congress the authority to pass laws limiting
campaign spending.

<P>
   Including the 10 articles of the Bill of Rights, the
Constitution has only been amended 27 times. Since taking control
of Congress in 1995, Republicans have pushed constitutional
amendments on a wide range of issues, including a balanced budget,
term limits, the line item veto, school prayer and super-majorities
for tax increases, but have yet to send an amendment to the states.

<HEADLINE> Kathleen Turner Does Scene Naked  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON (AP) -- Are you trying to seduce us, Ms. Turner?
</P>
<P>
   Producers of the West End production of ''The Graduate'' said
ticket sales have doubled after it became known that actress
Kathleen Turner bares all on stage as Mrs. Robinson.
</P>
<P>
   The show officially opens in a week, but preview audiences have
spread the word that Turner emerges from a shower and then drops
her towel on the stage, playing the ensuing scene without a stitch
on.
</P>
<P>
   In the 1967 film version, Dustin Hoffman is seen watching Anne
Bancroft's Mrs. Robinson as she saucily removes her stockings, but
her nakedness is merely hinted at.
</P>
<P>
   It won't be the first time a Hollywood star disrobes on a
theater stage.
</P>
<P>
   The Broadway production of ''The Blue Room,'' which ran from
December 1998 to February 1999, starred Nicole Kidman in various
stages of demure undress. The 82-performance run was sold out.

<HEADLINE> Dow Up 30.49; Nasdaq Down 42.69  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Stocks were mixed in early trading today. A
flurry of new deals by AT&AMP;T dominated activity in the
telecommunications sector, but most technology shares were lower as
investors once again took profits.
</P>
<P>
   In the first hour of trading on Wall Street, the Dow Jones
industrial average was up 30.49 at 10,966.60.
</P>
<P>
   Broader stock indicators were mixed. The Standard &AMP; Poor's 500
index was up 2.87 at 1,510.60, and the Nasdaq composite index was
down 42.69 at 4,791.20.
</P>
<P>
   AT&AMP;T fell { to 58 15/16 in active trading. After the close of
Tuesday's regular session, the company revealed details of its
long-awaited tracking stock for the fast-growing wireless business.
AT&AMP;T wants to sell between 360 million and 414 million shares in
the new AT&AMP;T Wireless Group for between $26 and $32 per share. The
offering, expected in late April or early May, could raise as much
as $13.25 billion and would be the biggest initial public offering
in U.S. history.
</P>
<P>
   AT&AMP;T helped buoy shares of Excite At Home, which rose 3\ to 37
9/16. The company, a provider of cable Internet access, extended
distribution arrangements with AT&AMP;T through 2008. Also, AT&AMP;T
offered to buy out two of its partners in its relationship with
Excite At Home, giving Comcast Corp. and Cox Communications the
right to sell their Excite At Home shares to AT&AMP;T for a minimum
price of 48 per share.
</P>
<P>
   The broader technology sector was mostly lower. Since the Nasdaq
composite index hit its last record on March 10, investors have
begun selling technology stocks to garner profits from their big
run. Selling gathered momentum on Tuesday, when Abby Joseph Cohen,
Goldman Sachs's chief investment strategist, said many technology
stocks are now fully valued and have little room for further gains.
</P>
<P>
   Applied Materials fell 3 13/16 to 98\ and Yahoo! fell 3{ to
191{.
</P>
<P>
   A year ago today, the Dow closed above the 10,000-point
threshold for the first time. Since then, the blue-chip index has
risen as much as 13 percent above the mark and has dipped back
below it several times. Currently, the Dow is about 9.5 percent
above 10,000.
</P>
<P>
   Advancing issues outnumbered decliners by a 9-to-5 margin on the
New York Stock Exchange, where volume came to 121.13 million
shares, behind Tuesday's early pace.
</P>
<P>
   The Russell 2000 index of smaller companies fell 3.55 to 555.49.

   Overseas, Japan's Nikkei stock average rose 1.6 percent. In
afternoon trading, Germany's DAX index was up 0.02 percent,

up 0.3 percent.

<HEADLINE> Still no verdict in Michael Ross death penalty case  </HEADLINE>
dsstf
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW LONDON, Conn. (AP) -- Jurors today began a fourth day of
deliberations in the death penalty case of serial killer Michael
Ross.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday, the 12-member reheard the judge's instructions on
the legal definition of aggravating factors. The jury must find
such a factor to recommend a death penalty sentence against Ross.
</P>
<P>
   An aggravating factor is found if the jury decides the killings
were committed in an especially cruel, heinous or depraved way.
</P>
<P>
   The jury also listened again to testimony about how two victims,
April Brunias and Leslie Shelley, died. Both 14-year-old girls were
killed on Easter Sunday 1984.
</P>
<P>
   State Medical Examiner Dr. Wayne Carver testified that a
ligature made of fabric was found tied around Shelley's neck,
leading the medical examiner to believe she had been strangled. No
exact cause of death could be found for Brunias.
</P>
<P>
   Ross was convicted and sentenced to death in 1987 for killing
Shelley, Brunias, Robyn Stavinsky, 19, and Wendy Baribeault, 17.
The Supreme Court threw out the death sentence and ordered a new
penalty hearing.
</P>
<P>
   The 40-year-old Ross already is serving two life sentences for
killing two other women, Tammy Williams, 17, and Debra Smith
Taylor, 23, in Windham County in 1982. Ross has admitted to killing
two other women in New York, but has not been prosecuted there.

<HEADLINE> Court Upholds Ban on Nude Dancing  </HEADLINE>
By LAURIE ASSEO, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Supreme Court today limited some of the
freedom-of-expression protections that permit nude dancing.
</P>
<P>
   The justices, by a 6-3 vote, reinstated an Erie, Pa.,
public-indecency ordinance that requires women who work as barroom
dancers to wear at least pasties and a G-string when performing.
</P>
<P>
   Pennsylvania's highest court had struck down the law, ruling
that it unlawfully infringed expressive freedom, as protected by
the Constitution's First Amendment.
</P>
<P>
   Today's decision is sure to have broad impact. Nude
entertainment is featured in some 3,000 adult clubs nationwide, the
justices had been told.
</P>
<P>
   They said the Pennsylvania court was wrong.
</P>
<P>
   Writing in the court's main opinion, Justice Sandra Day O'Connor
said nude dancing is ''expressive conduct'' that merits some First
Amendment protection.
</P>
<P>
   However, she added, the nude-dancing ban furthers Erie's
''interest in combating the negative secondary effects associated
with adult entertainment establishments,'' such as crime.
</P>
<P>
   O'Connor said the ordinance was aimed at combating crime and
other negative effects of having adult entertainment
establishments, and not at the erotic message of nude dancing.
</P>
<P>
   Even if the ban ''has some minimal effect on the erotic message
by muting that portion of the expression that occurs when the last
stitch is dropped,'' O'Connor said, the dancers are free to perform
wearing pasties and G-strings. Any effect on overall expression is
minimal, she said.
</P>
<P>
   The main part of her opinion was joined by Chief Justice William
H. Rehnquist and Justices Anthony M. Kennedy and Stephen G. Breyer.
</P>
<P>
   Justices Antonin Scalia and Clarence Thomas, in a separate
opinion by Scalia, voted to uphold the law on different grounds,
citing ''the traditional power of government to foster good morals
... and the acceptability of the traditional judgment ... that nude
public dancing itself is immoral.''
</P>
<P>
   However, Scalia also contended the case was moot because the
nightclub at issue, known as Kandyland, had been sold.
</P>
<P>
   Justice David H. Souter wrote separately that he agreed with
O'Connor's analysis, but that he believed the city had not shown
its ordinance was designed to deal with ''real harms.'' He said the
city should be given a chance to do so.
</P>
<P>
   Justices John Paul Stevens and Ruth Bader Ginsburg dissented
from the ruling, saying in an opinion by Stevens that the court had
decided for the first time that secondary effects ''may justify the
total suppression of protected speech.''
</P>
<P>
   ''Indeed, the plurality opinion concludes that admittedly
trivial advancements of a state's interests may provide the basis
for censorship,'' Stevens wrote.

<HEADLINE> Connecticut lobstermen join effort to investigate lobster dieoff  </HEADLINE>
By DENISE LAVOIE, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   STAMFORD, Conn. (AP) -- Connecticut lobstermen will participate
in independent testing to help determine what has been killing
millions of lobsters in Long Island Sound.
</P>
<P>
   Beginning next week, five lobstermen's groups will collect dead
lobsters and sediment in the western Sound waters, between Norwalk
and Glen Cove, N.Y. The samples will be sent to a laboratory in
Fairfax, Va., where they will be tested.
</P>
<P>
   The testing, expected to cost from $75,000 to $100,000, will be
funded by FISH Unlimited Inc., a Shelter Island, N.Y.-based
fisheries conservation group with 14,000 members nationwide.
</P>
<P>
   ''In Western Long Island Sound, there are no more lobsters ...
these guys are completely wiped out,'' said Bill Smith, executive
director of FISH Unlimited.
</P>
<P>
   Many lobstermen in the Sound reported death rates of 50 percent
or more last fall.
</P>
<P>
   Michael Horvath, president of the Western Connecticut
Lobstermen's Association, said he is planning to sell his business
because of the financial losses he has suffered from the lobster
dieoff.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is taking out the fishermen,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ''There is no stock out there. It is completely devastated, and
now we're in debt and we've got nowhere to go.''
</P>
<P>
   University of Connecticut scientists have found a parasite
called a paramoeba that is infecting the lobsters, but are checking
whether other factors, such as pollution or contamination of the
sound, is contributing to the die-off.
</P>
<P>
   But Smith said his group believes the dieoff may have been
caused by contaminated dredge material that was dumped into Western
Long Island Sound last fall from Mamaroneck Harbor, N.Y. The
material contained pesticides and other heavy metals, Smith said.
</P>
<P>
   He said that at the same time the material was being dumped in
the Sound, officials in New York and Connecticut were spraying
pesticides to prevent the spread of the West Nile encephalitis
outbreak. He said his group believes that heavy rains from
Hurricane Floyd in September may have washed the pesticides into
the Sound.
</P>
<P>
   Lawmakers from New York and Connecticut have lobbied for money
to help the lobstermen.
</P>
<P>
   Last month, President Clinton asked Congress for $10 million in
aid and for research to determine what is killing off the lobsters.
The Clinton administration named the Sound a Commercial Fishery
Disaster area in January.
</P>
<P>
   The Long Island Sound is the No. 3 lobster market behind Maine
and Massachusetts. Connecticut brings in about 3.5 million pounds a
year, while New York brings in about 8.5 million pounds
</P>
<P>
   Smith said his group expects to have the test results back by
mid-May.
</P>
<P>
   The five groups participating in the sample collection and
testing are: The Long Island Sound Lobstermen's Association, the
Western Long Island Sound Lobstermen's Association, The Connecticut
Lobstermen's Association, The Western Connecticut Lobstermen's
Association and the Westchester Lobstermen's and Dealers
Association.

<HEADLINE> Bush making up with McCain, Forbes amid education focus  </HEADLINE>
By GLEN JOHNSON, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEWARK, N.J. (AP) -- George W. Bush, keeping his focus on
education, today visited a special school that he said proves his
point that there are good options for parents ''dissatisfied with
the status quo.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush toured the 3-year-old North Star Academy, an inner-city
charter school where he watched as students in a math class went
through academic calisthenics, racing up and down addition tables
in groups and answering such questions as what is a quadrangle.
</P>
<P>
   The expected Republican presidential nominee, courting Democrats
and independent voters with a continued emphasis on education, also
toured a computer lab where children were learning history through
an interactive program written by one of the school's co-founders.
Later, in remarks to students clad in polo shirts and khakis, Bush
heralded the school's example.
</P>
<P>
   ''This charter school shows that all children can learn, and I
resent those who stand in the way of education reform, those who
say that giving parents different options if they're dissatisfied
with the status quo isn't right,'' Bush said. ''This is a bottom-up
example of reform. Had we tried to invent North Star at the federal
government, they'd still be in committee hearings.''
</P>
<P>
   The Texas governor spoke at the school the day after rolling out
a $5 billion plan aimed at making sure every child can read by the
end of the third grade.
</P>
<P>
   After a bruising presidential primary campaign, Bush also was
moving toward reconciliation with former primary rivals, reaching
out to John McCain and picking up an endorsement from Steve Forbes.
</P>
<P>
   Bush telephoned McCain on Tuesday while campaigning in suburban
Washington, declaring the ''past is the past'' and laying the
groundwork for a face-to-face meeting down the road.
</P>
<P>
   The Texas governor reached out to McCain after Bob Dole, the
defeated 1996 GOP nominee who has been acting as peacemaker, had
lunch with the Arizona senator and then called Bush.
</P>
<P>
   Bush wants McCain's endorsement, too, but McCain aides said it
is too soon to talk about that.
</P>
<P>
   Still, McCain adviser John Weaver said, ''The ice has been
broken.''
</P>
<P>
   ''I think John and I both understand that the past is the past
and it's time to move forward,'' Bush said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Later, Forbes welcomed Bush to his home state of New Jersey with
the endorsement.
</P>
<P>
   ''As the American people are learning and will learn, he is a
good man,'' Forbes told a meeting of Somerset County Republicans in
Manville, N.J. ''He has been tested -- I tried to test him -- and he
emerged the stronger for it.''
</P>
<P>
   By knitting together Forbes' conservative base with the
coalition of Democrats and independents who supported McCain's
maverick candidacy, Bush hopes to broaden his political base as he
squares off against Vice President Al Gore, the presumed Democratic
presidential nominee.
</P>
<P>
   During the primary battle, Forbes complained that Bush wasn't
conservative enough and McCain claimed he was too far right and a
hostage of ''Pat Robertson Republicans.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore already has seized on the themes and terminology,
incorporating McCain's attacks into his own anti-Bush rhetoric.
</P>
<P>
   The GOP politicking Tuesday threatened to overshadow the
announcement of Bush's $5 billion ''Reading First'' initiative.
</P>
<P>
   It would fund programs to diagnose problem readers, teach
instructors to identify them as such and correct the problem.
Initially targeted at 900,000 kindergarten and first graders, aides
said Bush wants to expand the five-year plan to address second
graders as well.
</P>
<P>
   ''Our economy is the envy of the world; unfortunately, our
schools are not,'' Bush said.
</P>
<P>
   Today's stop at the North Star Academy charter school was aimed
at highlighting Bush's earlier pledges to transfer federal
education authority to the states in return for the development of
accountability standards.
</P>
<P>
   Bush also favors fostering educational competition with
alternatives such as charter schools. North Star, the first such
school in New Jersey, has an enrollment of 144 students -- and a
waiting list of more than 700.
</P>
<P>
   There were several ear-catching subtexts to Tuesday's events.
</P>
<P>
   Bush attended $500,000 fund-raiser in Parsippany, N.J., where he
was introduced by Gov. Christie Whitman. While some political
analysts doubt he can pick her as a running mate because she
supports abortion rights, unlike him, his comments about her had a
teasing ring to them.
</P>
<P>
   ''I can't wait to campaign with her not only in the state of New
Jersey but all around America,'' Bush said. ''We share a passion,
we share a common passion. We want to do what's right for this
country. We want to elevate the spirit of America.''

<HEADLINE> House To Vote on Late-Term Abortion  </HEADLINE>
By JIM ABRAMS, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The House on April 5 will again vote on
legislation to ban some late-term abortions. President Clinton has
vetoed similar legislation twice before and the White House says he
will do so once more.
</P>
<P>
   House Majority Leader Dick Armey, R-Texas, said today that the
House will return to the issue of what opponents call ''partial
birth'' abortion because ''this barbaric procedure has no place in
a civilized society.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton vetoed the legislation in 1996 and 1997, stating that it
did not provide adequate exceptions to protect the health of the
mother. The House both times voted to override the veto but the
Senate failed to come up with the necessary two-thirds majority for
an override.
</P>
<P>
   The Senate last October voted 63-34 for a bill that would
subject doctors who perform the procedure illegally to up to two
years in prison unless the procedure is ''necessary to save the
life of a mother whose life is endangered by a physical disorder,
illness or injury.'' The mother could not be prosecuted under the
measure.
</P>
<P>
   The Senate rejected a broader exception for women whose
pregnancies endangered their health.
</P>
<P>
   Armey said he hoped ''the president will search his heart and do
the right thing this time.''
</P>
<P>
   The vote will put lawmakers on record on the abortion issue in
an election year but there is no indication the legislation has a
better chance of becoming law.
</P>
<P>
   The procedure in question involves the partial, feet-first
delivery of a fetus and the draining of its skull contents.
</P>
<P>
   Supporters of the bill say it amounts to infanticide. Opponents
say the procedure is rare, and violates court rulings that
abortions necessary to preserve a woman's life or health may not be
banned.
</P>
<P>
   According to the National Abortion and Reproductive Rights
Action League, 31 states have enacted legislation banning ''partial
birth'' abortion or other abortion procedures, but court challenges
have been initiated in 21 states and in 20 of those states courts
or attorneys general have prohibited full enforcement of the laws.

<HEADLINE> Herbicide Linked to Diabetes  </HEADLINE>
By ROBERT BURNS, AP Military Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- An Air Force study of veterans who sprayed
Agent Orange during the Vietnam War found the strongest evidence to
date that exposure to the herbicide is associated with diabetes,
officials said today.
</P>
<P>
   A 47 percent increase in diabetes was detected in those veterans
with the highest levels of dioxin.
</P>
<P>
   The lead investigator, Joel Michalek of the Air Force surgeon
general's office, was scheduled to release the findings at a
Pentagon news conference today.
</P>
<P>
   An outline of the results of the study -- which was based on 1997
physical examinations of 1,000 Air Force veterans -- was made
available to The Associated Press after the findings were reported
in today's editions of The Washington Post and The New York Times.
</P>
<P>
   Today's report, which compared the health of exposed veterans
with 1,300 other Vietnam veterans who had no contact with Agent
Orange, said that as dioxin levels in the body increased, the
presence and severity of adult diabetes increased.
</P>
<P>
   Dioxin is the component of Agent Orange linked to many health
effects in laboratory animals.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Bernard Sanders, I-Vt., a member of the House Government
Reform Committee that oversees veterans affairs, said the Air Force
findings confirm a diabetes link that many people have long
suspected.
</P>
<P>
   ''Given this latest evidence, the federal government must
acknowledge the suffering of Vietnam veterans with diabetes and
provide them with compensation to which they are entitled,''
Sanders said today.
</P>
<P>
   The report said it found no consistent evidence that Agent
Orange is related to cancer.
</P>
<P>
   It also found that exposed veterans experienced a 26 percent
increase in heart disease, although the rate did not increase as
dioxin levels increased. In a related finding, the report said that
instances of high blood pressure among the 1,000 veterans did
increase with higher levels of dioxin.
</P>
<P>
   The results of the report are being reviewed by the National
Academy of Sciences. The Academy will report to the Department of
Veterans Affairs to inform decisions on compensation to victims.
</P>
<P>
   In testimony to Congress earlier this month, Michalek called the
Air Forcd study ''one of the best epidemiological studies ever
conducted.'' The study was started in 1981 and the first physical
examinations of exposed Air Force veterans were done a year later.
The work is to be completed in 2006.
</P>
<P>
   The Vietnam Veterans of America and other groups have criticized
the study as being too small and they have accused the Air Force of
being too secretive about its findings and too slow to make them
available to other researchers.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this month, the General Accounting Office, the
investigative arm of Congress, said that veterans needing health
compensation have benefited little from thze study, known as the
Ranch Hand study, named after the spraying operation in Vietnam.

<HEADLINE> Court Limits Strippers' Freedom  </HEADLINE>
By LAURIE ASSEO, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Supreme Court today limited some of nude
dancing's freedom-of-expression protections.
</P>
<P>
   The justices, by a 6-3 vote, upheld against a free-speech
challenge an Erie, Pa., public-indecency ordinance that requires
women who work as barroom dancers to wear at least pasties and a
G-string when performing.
</P>
<P>
   Pennsylvania's highest court had struck down the law, ruling
that it unlawfully infringed expressive freedom, as protected by
the Constitution's First Amendment.
</P>
<P>
   Although the court's rationale was splintered, today's decision
is sure to have broad impact. Nude entertainment is featured in
some 3,000 adult clubs nationwide, the justices had been told.
</P>
<P>
   They said the Pennsylvania court was wrong.
</P>
<P>
   Writing in the court's main opinion, Justice Sandra Day O'Connor
said nude dancing is ''expressive conduct'' but that it ''falls
only within the outer ambit'' of First Amendment protection.
</P>
<P>
   She added that the nude-dancing ban furthers Erie's ''interest
in combating the negative secondary effects associated with adult
entertainment establishments,'' such as crime, and was not aimed at
the erotic message of nude dancing.
</P>
<P>
   In that way, she said, the nude-dancing ban ''is no different
than the ban on burning draft registration cards'' previously
upheld by the Supreme Court, in which the government ''sought to
prevent the means of the expression and not the expression of
antiwar sentiment itself.''
</P>
<P>
   Even if the nude-dancing ban ''has some minimal effect on the
erotic message by muting that portion of the expression that occurs
when the last stitch is dropped,'' O'Connor said, the dancers are
free to perform wearing pasties and G-strings. Any effect on
overall expression is minimal, she said.
</P>
<P>
   Valerie Sprenkle, the assistant Erie city solicitor, said ''the
nudity ban will be reinstated'' but was not sure when.
</P>
<P>
   ''We're delighted. From what we see, it's a win,'' Sprenkle
said.
</P>
<P>
   The main part of O'Connor's opinion was joined by Chief Justice
William H. Rehnquist and Justices Anthony M. Kennedy and Stephen G.
Breyer.
</P>
<P>
   Justices Antonin Scalia and Clarence Thomas, in a separate
opinion by Scalia, voted to uphold the law on different grounds,
citing ''the traditional power of government to foster good morals
... and the acceptability of the traditional judgment ... that nude
public dancing itself is immoral.''
</P>
<P>
   However, Scalia also contended the case was moot because the
nightclub at issue, known as Kandyland, had been sold.
</P>
<P>
   Justice David H. Souter wrote separately that he agreed with
O'Connor's analysis, but that he believed the city had not shown
its ordinance was designed to deal with ''real harms.'' He said the
city should be given a chance to do so.
</P>
<P>
   Justices John Paul Stevens and Ruth Bader Ginsburg dissented
from the ruling, saying in an opinion by Stevens that the court had
decided for the first time that secondary effects ''may justify the
total suppression of protected speech.''
</P>
<P>
   ''Indeed, the plurality opinion concludes that admittedly
trivial advancements of a state's interests may provide the basis
for censorship,'' Stevens wrote.
</P>
<P>
   The Erie dispute was not the Supreme Court's first tour of the
far reaches of free-speech law. In 1991, a badly splintered court
ruled that nude dancing is a form of expression within the First
Amendment's ''outer perimeters'' and is entitled to some protection
from government censorship.
</P>
<P>
   But that 1991 ruling also allowed Indiana to ban all
barroom-style nude dancing under a state law generally prohibiting
public nudity.
</P>
<P>
   The Pennsylvania Supreme Court, voting 4-3 in 1998, struck down
Erie's ordinance after calling the splintered 1991 decision a
''hodgepodge of opinions'' that offered little guidance.
</P>
<P>
   The 1994 ordinance had been challenged by Nick Panos, who used
to own the Kandyland nude-dancing club. He since has sold the club
to a new owner, Joseph Cunningham, who closed it down and opened a
similar club, Kandy's Dinner Theater, at a new location.
</P>
<P>
   The newer club, surrounded by auto parts stores, gas stations
and fast-food restaurants, is the only establishment in Erie where
women performers dance while naked. A lighted sign out front
proclaims: ''First Amendment Rights Headquarters.''
</P>
<P>
   A key issue in the Erie case was whether city officials enacted
a ''content-neutral'' law against public nudity in general, or
whether they specifically targeted nude dancing.
</P>
<P>
   O'Connor said the ordinance was ''on its face a content-neutral
restriction that regulates conduct, not First Amendment
expression.''
</P>
<P>
   ''The ordinance regulates conduct, and any incidental impact on
the expressive element of nude dancing'' is minimal, O'Connor said.
The requirement to wear G-strings and pasties ''leaves ample
capacity to convey the dancer's erotic message,'' she added.
</P>
<P>
   Stevens' dissent contended the ordinance was ''aimed directly at
the dancers in establishments such as Kandyland'' and should be
held ''patently invalid.''
</P>
<P>
   One issue before the justices had been whether Panos' departure
from the scene had made the dispute legally moot, but the court
last June denied his attempt to have them declare just that and
thereby preserve his state Supreme Court victory.
</P>
<P>
   O'Connor said the case was not moot because the club could
reopen and also because the court has an interest in keeping people
who won a lower court ruling from seeking to ''insulate a favorable
decision from review.''
</P>
<P>
   The case is Erie vs. Pap's A.M., 98-1161.

<HEADLINE> President Wades Into Flag Debate  </HEADLINE>
By ANNE GEARAN, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Clinton is wading into debates over
display of the Confederate flag and religious tolerance in South
Carolina that roiled Republican presidential politics this year.
</P>
<P>
   The symbolism will be potent and the political undertones strong
as Clinton appears tonight at a $500-per-person fund-raiser
honoring Rep. Jim Clyburn, D-S.C., chairman of the Congressional
Black Caucus.
</P>
<P>
   ''The president will compliment those who have been trying to
work through this issue,'' White House spokesman Joe Lockhart said
today. ''He thinks it's right that people are trying to work
through this issue.''
</P>
<P>
   Along with many other blacks in South Carolina, Clyburn wants
the flag removed from atop the South Carolina Statehouse.
</P>
<P>
   And in a state likely to vote Republican in the fall, Clinton
will point to the political controversy over the flag in this
year's pivotal South Carolina GOP primary.
</P>
<P>
   Presumptive Republican presidential nominee George W.Bush
demurred on the question of whether the flag belongs at the
Statehouse, calling it a local issue. Bush's former GOP challenger,
Arizona Sen. John McCain, also refused to take a position.
</P>
<P>
   On the Democratic side, Vice President Al Gore and
then-challenger Bill Bradley both called for the flag's removal.
</P>
<P>
   ''South Carolina is certainly a state that framed the
differences between the two parties,'' White House spokesman Jake
Siewert said.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's message also will apply to the controversy arising
from Bush's primary-season visit to Bob Jones University. Bush came
under fire for failing to criticize the university's racial
policies and the anti-Catholic statements on its Web site.
</P>
<P>
   At the time, the conservative Christian school banned
interracial dating.
</P>
<P>
   Supporters say the flag, which has flown atop the Statehouse
since 1962, honors those who died in the Civil War.
</P>
<P>
   The National Association for the Advancement of Colored People
is leading a tourism boycott of South Carolina until the flag is
removed.
</P>
<P>
   This week, the NAACP offered some support for a compromise
proposed by state legislators on both sides of the flag issue. That
plan would remove the flag from the Statehouse dome but erect other
Civil War-era flags on the Capitol grounds.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton will likely expand on rhetoric he used earlier this
month during a commemoration of the civil rights march on Selma,
Ala.
</P>
<P>
   ''As long as the waving symbol of one American's pride is the
shameful symbol of another American's pain, we have another bridge
to cross,'' Clinton said then.
</P>
<P>
   Clyburn said he wanted to hold the fund-raising benefit at
predominantly black Allen University to make a statement, even
though he could have been raised more money at a larger, more
lavish location. There will be seating for about 1,000 people.
</P>
<P>
   ''I want to make a statement about that flag every chance I
get,'' Clyburn said recently.
</P>
<P>
   By his presence, Clinton will ally himself with the movement to
remove the flag as a symbol of racism, said Bruce Ransom, a
political science professor at Clemson University.
</P>
<P>
   ''You've got the president in South Carolina, he's at a
predominantly black college, talking about the flag, and he's there
with Clyburn,'' Ransom said. ''As far as symbolism, there's a
bundle all together there.''
</P>
<P>
   Oklahoma Republican Rep. J.C. Watts, chairman of the House
Republican Conference, said he personally supports removing the
flag from the Statehouse, but that it remains a matter for South
Carolina's elected leaders to decide.
</P>
<P>
   ''All I ask for is consistency,'' Watts said Tuesday. ''If
you're going to ask Governor George Bush why he won't get involved
in South Carolina's business, then ask (South Carolina) Democratic
Governor Jim Hodges why it still flies over the state capitol,''
Watts said.
</P>
<P>
   Only the state Legislature has the authority to remove the
banner, which has flown since 1962.

<HEADLINE> AIDS Cases Rise in China  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   BEIJING (AP) -- New cases of Chinese with the AIDS virus grew by
more than 40 percent last year, with women increasingly at risk,
the newspaper of China's Health Ministry reported Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Health experts detected 4,677 new cases of HIV, the virus that
causes AIDS, last year -- a 41.5 percent rise over 1998, the Health
News said. It said that all told, China has recorded 17,316 Chinese
carriers of HIV, 647 of them with full-blown AIDS, since the first
case was reported in 1985.
</P>
<P>
   The number of reported cases is tiny by international standards,
especially given China's population of 1.25 billion. India, with
about 1 billion people, has an estimated 3.7 million people
infected with the HIV virus.
</P>
<P>
   Chinese and foreign AIDS experts believe the actual number of
Chinese infected with HIV may be closer to 400,000.
</P>
<P>
   Chinese health officials increased testing of high-risk groups
last year, conducting more than 4.4 million tests, the Health News
said.
</P>
<P>
   Women now account for 15.4 percent of all HIV cases -- ''an
obvious increase,'' the newspaper said, without providing
comparisons. It quoted a vice chairman of the Association for the
Prevention of AIDS and Sexually Transmitted Diseases, Dai Zhicheng,
as calling the increase among women ''a special warning.''
</P>
<P>
   For much of the last 15 years, HIV has largely been confined to
needle-sharing heroin addicts and their sexual partners. But in
recent years, the disease has begun to show up among truck drivers
and prostitutes in areas with thriving sex trades, foreshadowing an
outbreak in the general population.

<HEADLINE> Senate Unveils $1.83T 2001 Budget  </HEADLINE>
By ALAN FRAM, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Democrats criticized a Republican-written
$1.83 trillion budget today for cutting taxes and domestic programs
too deeply. But there is little they can do to prevent the Senate
Budget Committee from approving it.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Frank Lautenberg, D-N.J., said that to make room for their
proposed tax cut, Republicans would hold spending for many domestic
programs to 6.5 percent below what is needed to stay even with
inflation over the next five years -- levels he said are politically
intolerable.
</P>
<P>
   ''It pretends that Congress will make deep cuts in most domestic
programs,'' Lautenberg, the committee's top Democrat, said of the
GOP plan. ''And it pretends the president and American people will
let that happen.''
</P>
<P>
   But as the committee chairman, Sen. Pete Domenici, R-N.M., began
pushing his plan through his panel, he said the measure would give
domestic programs more money than they are getting this year, and
still leave room for a tax cut.
</P>
<P>
   ''We have plenty of room for government to grow,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Though largely similar to a budget the House approved last week,
the Senate measure would allow smaller tax cuts than the House's
version. It would also cut taxes and domestic programs further than
President Clinton wants.
</P>
<P>
   ''We will not support plans ... that abandon fiscal discipline
and threaten our economic prosperity,'' said Lautenberg.
</P>
<P>
   The budget, which does not need the president's signature, sets
overall tax and spending totals for the year, but leaves decisions
on details for later bills.
</P>
<P>
   While both the House and Senate fiscal blueprints plan at least
$150 billion in tax cuts over the next five years, Domenici's
package would give lawmakers leeway to increase those reductions to
up to $190 billion. The House measure would permit a maximum of
$240 billion in lower levies, reflecting a stronger pro-tax cut
sentiment among Republicans there.
</P>
<P>
   Lautenberg noted that Domenici's tax cut is smaller than the
five-year, $483 billion reduction proposed by George W. Bush, the
GOP's apparent presidential nominee.
</P>
<P>
   Domenici's decision to have a smaller reduction ''does send a
powerful statement, and it should help Americans understand just
how extreme the Bush tax program is,'' Lautenberg said.
</P>
<P>
   The two tax plans are not directly comparable because they cover
slightly different five-year periods, but Bush's is clearly larger.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton proposed $99 billion in tax cuts through 2005 -- nearly
completely offset by $96 billion in higher taxes on cigarettes and
some businesses.
</P>
<P>
   Domenici's budget would also set aside $20 billion over five
years to create a prescription drug benefit for Medicare recipients
or otherwise change the program. The House budget allowed $40
billion.
</P>
<P>
   Both the House and Senate budgets would use the nearly $1
trillion in Social Security surpluses expected through 2005 for
debt reduction, just as Clinton would do.
</P>
<P>
   Both would also provide $307 billion for defense spending next
year, $1 billion more than Clinton proposed. And they would set
aside $290 billion for domestic programs, nearly $30 billion below
Clinton's request.
</P>
<P>
   They also recommend increases for education and scientific
research, and extra money this year and next for farmers.

<HEADLINE> High Court Ponders School Prayer  </HEADLINE>
By RICHARD CARELLI, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- A clearly divided Supreme Court returned to
the politically volatile subject of school prayer today as the
justices sought to determine whether school districts can let
students lead stadium crowds in prayer before high school football
games.
</P>
<P>
   Nearly four decades after the court banned organized, officially
sponsored prayers from public schools, the justices' questions and
comments alternately displayed their concern for both church-state
separation and students' free-speech rights.
</P>
<P>
   Justice David H. Souter appeared most critical of a Texas school
district's policy allowing pregame prayers over a stadium's public
address system. It ''requires these students to sit there while a
prayer is going on,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   But Justice Antonin Scalia, who seemed most sympathetic to the
now-suspended policy, noted that it would allow a representative
elected by students to give a ''message or invocation,'' adding,
''You can't say that in every case it's going to produce a
prayer.''
</P>
<P>
   A decision will be announced by late June. And as in many of the
most divisive cases to confront the nine-member court, the votes of
Justices Sandra Day O'Connor and Anthony M. Kennedy may prove
pivotal.
</P>
<P>
   Both asked numerous questions today and appeared troubled by the
policy at issue. But their questions did not signal which way they
might rule. The eventual decision could help clarify the law
surrounding school prayer beyond sporting events -- a confusing
jumble the nation's highest court helped create.
</P>
<P>
   The court's newest venture into the politically volatile issue
comes as an ABC News poll says two-thirds of Americans think
students should be permitted to lead such prayers.
</P>
<P>
   The poll, based on more than 1,000 interviews, found that 67
percent of those asked favored student-led prayers; 27 percent
opposed them and 6 percent gave no opinion. The poll's margin of
error was plus or minus 3 percentage points.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this month in Texas' Republican primary, 94 percent of
voters approved a nonbinding resolution backing student-initiated
prayer at school sporting events. Texas Gov. George W. Bush, the
presumed Republican presidential nominee, filed a brief supporting
student-led prayer.
</P>
<P>
   The Supreme Court, however, often ignores public sentiment in
fulfilling its role as the ultimate arbiter of constitutional
disputes.
</P>
<P>
   Washington lawyer Jay Sekulow, defending the Texas school
district's policy, argued that it is a neutral one that does not
involve government speech. Only who will speak -- not the message
given -- is subjected to a majority vote, he said. ''The student is
the circuit breaker here,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Texas Attorney General John Cornyn also urged the justices to
reinstate the policy and avoid ''viewpoint discrimination'' against
those who want their messages to be prayers.
</P>
<P>
   Asked by O'Connor whether student-led prayers in classrooms
could begin each school day, Cronyn said no. Football games are
different because ''this is an extracurricular event,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   But Anthony Griffin, a Galveston, Texas, lawyer representing
those who challenged the policy, said high school football games
''are just as much a part of these schools'' as a homeroom class.
''They're part of the school system,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The Santa Fe Independent School District's policy was challenged
in 1995 by four students and their parents. Their lawsuit also
attacked the school district's policy of letting students lead
prayers at graduation ceremonies.
</P>
<P>
   Santa Fe, a community of some 10,000 residents about 40 miles
southeast of Houston, has seen deep divisions created by the prayer
dispute.
</P>
<P>
   A federal appeals court ruled last year that school officials
must tell students to keep their graduation-ceremony comments and
prayers ''nonsectarian and non-proselytizing'' but also ruled that
student-led prayers at high school football games are always out of
bounds.
</P>
<P>
   School district officials appealed both parts of the 5th U.S.
Circuit Court of Appeals ruling but the Supreme Court agreed only
to focus on the football games, passing up the graduation-ceremony
dispute.
</P>
<P>
   The justices' last major ruling on school prayer was announced
in 1992, and barred clergy-led prayers -- invocations and
benedictions -- at public school graduation ceremonies. ''The
Constitution forbids the state to exact religious conformity from a
student as the price of attending her own high school graduation,''
the court said then.
</P>
<P>
   The ruling was viewed as a strong reaffirmation of the court's
1962 decision banning organized school prayer.
</P>
<P>
   But in 1993, the justices refused to review a 5th Circuit ruling
in another Texas case that allowed student-led prayers at
graduation ceremonies.
</P>
<P>
   That ruling still is binding law in Louisiana and Mississippi as
well. But it conflicts with another federal appeals court's
decision barring student-led graduation prayers in nine Western
states. The justices also refused to review that decision.
</P>
<P>
   The case is Santa Fe Independent School District vs. Jane Doe,
99-62.

<HEADLINE> Cancer-Fighting Chemical Found  </HEADLINE>
By MARY ANN LICKTEIG, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO (AP) -- Researchers say they've found the active
ingredient of Taxol in hazelnuts, a discovery that could lead to
new ways to make the cancer-fighting drug.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is potentially good news for cancer patients,'' said
Angela Hoffman, a member of the research team at the University of
Portland in Oregon, who was to present the study today at the
national meeting of the American Chemical Society.
</P>
<P>
   The finding may be of interest to competitors of Bristol-Myers
Squibb, which holds the exclusive license to make Taxol, the
nation's top selling cancer drug. Worldwide sales of Taxol brought
the company $1.5 billion last year, 7.3 percent of its total sales.
The drug is now made using chemicals from yew tree needles.
</P>
<P>
   One thing is clear: Eating hazelnuts has no cancer-prevention or
cancer-fighting benefits.
</P>
<P>
   ''Won't do any good at all, because Taxol is not active
orally,'' said Robert Holton, a Florida State University chemist
who gets royalties from Bristol-Myers for the method he developed
of synthesizing the drug.
</P>
<P>
   However, having a new source of the active ingredient,
paclitaxel, is compelling, said Steve Tighe, senior pharmaceutical
analyst at Merrill Lynch. He said much more information is needed
before anyone can say if it can be used against cancer.
</P>
<P>
   It took nearly 30 years after paclitaxel was found in yew trees
to get Taxol on the market. The latest discovery is still in the
lab.
</P>
<P>
   Many questions remain unanswered. Is it economical or even
possible to extract paclitaxel from hazelnuts commercially? Will
regulators approve it? How many companies would get the license to
do it?
</P>
<P>
   Gram for gram, hazelnuts carry just one-tenth of the chemical
that yew trees do, researchers said.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm not sure I see what the advantage of the hazelnut over the
yew tree would be,'' said oncologist Clifford Hudis, chief of the
Breast Cancer Medicine Service at Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer
Center.
</P>
<P>
   Taxol and the yew needles used to make it are not in short
supply.
</P>
<P>
   Controversy surrounded the drug when the Food and Drug
Administration first approved it in late 1992 because Pacific yew
trees, its only known source, were being cut down to make it.
</P>
<P>
   But Bristol-Myers quickly found a synthetic production method
that starts with the needles of European and Asian yews. No trees
die and the needles are plentiful. ''By the gazillions, and they
grow back,'' said Holton.
</P>
<P>
   The Oregon researchers found paclitaxel in hazelnut trees while
looking for a compound that makes some trees resistant to a fatal
plant disease called Eastern Filbert Blight. They isolated the
chemical from nuts, branches and shells.
</P>
<P>
   Bristol-Myers goes to trial in May in New Jersey to defend its
patent against nine pharmaceutical companies seeking to market
generic versions of Taxol. The company did not return calls
requesting comment Tuesday.

<HEADLINE> Encyclopedia Traces Black Culture  </HEADLINE>
By VERENA DOBNIK, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Some news from the virtual grapevine: The work
that black slaves did in America would be worth more than $1
trillion in today's dollars.
</P>
<P>
   That's just one fact flying through cyberspace on a new Web site
-- Africana.com -- which aims to be a live forum linking blacks
worldwide.
</P>
<P>
   ''The grapevine is of huge importance to the black community,
since historically we were excluded from the mainstream media,''
says Henry Louis Gates Jr., the site's co-founder and head of
Harvard University's African-American studies department.
</P>
<P>
   ''A Web site with black content is the new place to 'hang
out,''' he says. ''It's a talking drum for the 21st century.''
</P>
<P>
   Africana.com is an educational portal that offers a black
perspective on everything from the daily news, history and the arts
to practical advice, like how to make it in business or manage your
hair.
</P>
<P>
   Visitors to the site can share views, and differences, in online
discussions, sign up for free e-mail or buy books and music. And
they can listen to 80 radio stations in places from Benin in
Africa, and Guadeloupe in the Caribbean, to the United States.
</P>
<P>
   ''We don't advocate anything, we don't tell you how to be
black,'' says Gates. ''We want to help raise a healthy black
community, by addressing concerns about health, wealth, love.''
</P>
<P>
   The site was launched to accompany a new 2,095-page book called
Africana, billed as the most complete record of Africa and the
black Diaspora in one volume. A parallel CD-ROM is called Encarta
Africana.
</P>
<P>
   The book realizes the dream of civil rights pioneer W.E.B.
DuBois, himself a Harvard alumnus. By the time he died in Ghana in
1963, he had sketched the beginnings of the encyclopedia. Then
Gates came along, equipped with a brainy Rolodex, the Internet and
millions of dollars in capital.
</P>
<P>
   He is a practical dreamer: The company that runs the Web site is
for-profit. Its president, Darrol Roberts, is a marketing expert
who once worked for Reebok. With Gates' help, he hopes to raise $15
million this year from investors and keep the site
advertising-free. However, sponsors are promised online
acknowledgment and items sold on the Web contribute to profits.
</P>
<P>
   Gates' chief business partners are a fellow Harvard professor,
Ghanaian-born philosopher Kwami Anthony Appiah, and Harry Lasker
III, a designer of educational media who helped create ''Sesame
Street.'' Music mogul Quincy Jones chipped in money, too. (By the
way, the encyclopedia reveals, Jones' middle name is Delight.)
</P>
<P>
   The need for a special ''black'' Web site points to a new ethnic
problem linked to the Internet: failure of blacks to match whites
in digital literacy.
</P>
<P>
   Among the 35 million blacks in the United States, far fewer
households use the Internet than the general population -- about 11
percent compared to 26 percent in general, according to Commerce
Department figures. And the 700 million blacks in Africa presumably
have even less access.
</P>
<P>
   With Africana.com, ''we want the black content to inspire people
to log on and learn,'' says Roberts. ''We want to be a digital
bridge.''
</P>
<P>
   Africana.com is in the process of hiring 50 people to staff its
offices in Cambridge, Mass. Their goal reaches beyond the Internet
-- to try to close the gap between America's plugged-in blacks and
those with meager financial and educational resources.
</P>
<P>
   With that aim, the site offers free lesson plans for teachers
based on entries from the encyclopedia.
</P>
<P>
   The lessons will go to schools ''with white kids and yellow kids
and brown kids and black kids and change the landscape of what they
take for granted about how the world works,'' says Appiah.
</P>
<P>
   Thousands of encyclopedias and CD-ROMS have been donated to
schools across the United States through individual and corporate
grants. And a copy of the printed encyclopedia will be donated to
every library in Africa.
</P>
<P>
   Africana also will tap traditional black markets by setting up
sites in churches and mosques.
</P>
<P>
   With his presence on television and the media, Gates' name
recognition has drawn a lineup of expert commentators like Nobel
Prize-winning Nigerian novelist Wole Soyinka; Benjamin Carson, a
Johns Hopkins Hospital neurosurgeon and innovator in separating
Siamese twins; feminist critic Bell Hooks; and personal trainer
Roberta Leonard.
</P>
<P>
   But Gates, a 49-year-old academic who grew up in a West Virginia
working-class family, also has drawn the disdain of some of the
black intelligentsia. He's called an elitist whose Harvard
department once was dubbed ''Cotton Club on the Charles'' by the
Rev. Eugene Rivers, a Boston-based activist.
</P>
<P>
   Rivers has now signed up as a commentator on the Web site. And a
Boston court is sentencing troubled youth to attend a pilot
Africana program in Rivers' church.
</P>
<P>
   The fact is, Africana.com is both highbrow and popular.
</P>
<P>
   It spotlights public figures from 18th-century
inventor-astronomer Benjamin Banneker to Michael Jordan and Puff
Daddy, offers advice on daily concerns from health and careers to
fashion, cooking and parenthood, and displays art from historically
black colleges in an online ''gallery.''
</P>
<P>
   Both site and encyclopedia span Africa-rooted cultures in the
Americas, the Caribbean, Europe and Asia. Topics range from ancient
African kingdoms to the continent's modern dictatorships, from a
17th-century Brazilian state created by runaway slaves to
contemporary black Jews in Harlem.
</P>
<P>
   Another entry touts the best-selling book ''The Debt: What
America Owes to Blacks,'' by activist attorney Randall Robinson,
who calculated the $1.4 trillion figure as the total value of slave
labor.
</P>
<P>
   A year old, Africana.com claims a half million ''hits'' a month.
Still, it has some strong black-centric competition, including
BlackVoices.com, known for its chat groups and job referrals and
owned by the powerful Tribune Co., and NetNoir.com, heavy with
celebrity interviews and partly owned by America Online.
</P>
<P>
   But the weighty printed encyclopedia, despite some errors in its
first edition and a list price of $100 (often discounted), has
little competition in bookstores for the sheer amount and range of
information.
</P>
<P>
   Co-edited by Appiah and Gates, the entries are signed by 220
contributors, and balance is sought on controversial topics. For
example, the Nation of Islam's Louis Farrakhan is described as an
African-American religious leader who advocates black
self-sufficiency but has been criticized for ''anti-Semitic
statements.''
</P>
<P>
   ''It's very important to us that the heart of this is telling
the truth, and it's not just cheerleading,'' says Appiah. ''The
truth includes the 10 million AIDS orphans in Africa -- and
Farrakhan.''

<HEADLINE> 'Wonderland': A Wondrous New Drama  </HEADLINE>
By FRAZIER MOORE, AP Television Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- The worst thing that could happen is for viewers
to dismiss ''Wonderland,'' sight unseen, as just another medical
drama. That is, who needs more docs on the Box -- especially going
up against the undisputed champ of the genre, ''ER''?
</P>
<P>
   But ''Wonderland,'' which premieres Thursday at 10 p.m. EST on
ABC, is a startlingly different series. Different from ''ER'' and
all its gurneys-and-bandages brethren. A drama of the mind,
''Wonderland'' is as different from what we've seen before as a
panic attack from a stubbed toe.
</P>
<P>
   Granted, there are moments early on when we may think we're
tuned to something safe and familiar.
</P>
<P>
   Compulsive womanizer Dr. Abe Matthews heads to work, leaving a
bedmate who, after finding evidence of other girlfriends, trashes
his apartment (hey, didn't that happen last week on UPN's cop drama
''The Beat''?).
</P>
<P>
   And when five-months-pregnant Dr. Lyla Garrity laments her
bygone svelteness, hubby Dr. Neil Harrison has just the right
sensitive-guy comeback: ''This is add-on beauty.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, judging from its first two episodes, ''Wonderland''
represents a seismic shift for TV. It has upped the ante on
commercial-network drama no less unmistakably than ''Hill Street
Blues'' almost 20 years ago. ''Wonderland'' is risky, honest and
hauntingly fresh.
</P>
<P>
   Filmed on location in New York City, it focuses on the doctors
of fictional Rivervue Hospital's psychiatric and emergency
services.
</P>
<P>
   Ted Levine (''Silence of the Lambs'') stars as Dr. Robert
Banger, a psychiatrist who specializes in criminal behavior. Banger
works with Harrison, played by Martin Donovan (''The Opposite of
Sex''). Harrison's expectant wife, played by Michelle Forbes
(''Homicide''), treats psychiatric emergencies.
</P>
<P>
   The splendid cast also includes Michael Jai White (HBO's biopic
''Tyson'') as a fellow physician in the emergency suite, Billy
Burke as lady-killer Matthews and Joelle Carter as Dr. Heather
Miles, an intern.
</P>
<P>
   Creator and executive producer of ''Wonderland'' is Peter Berg,
until now best known for his on-screen role as Dr. Billy Kronk on
''Chicago Hope.'' He also wrote and directed the 1998 black comedy
''Very Bad Things.''
</P>
<P>
   What a worthy new vision he brings to TV. Not to mention the
guts to penetrate a world no drama series has confronted since --
what, ''The Eleventh Hour'' in 1962?
</P>
<P>
   Penetrate it Berg does. But the most striking quality of
''Wonderland'' isn't its rough-and-tumble documentary style or its
shattering scenes. What truly sets ''Wonderland'' apart from other
medical dramas, and most other TV, is its all-inclusive spirit.
</P>
<P>
   Like it or not, this is a show about everyone. The message:
Staying balanced -- mentally and otherwise -- is a day-to-day
challenge from which no one is exempt.
</P>
<P>
   Here is Dr. Banger, in the midst of a divorce, as he pleads his
case for child custody. During this evaluation, a court-appointed
psychologist asks him to explain his job.
</P>
<P>
   ''When the pressures of modern society become too great for a
person, they come to us,'' says Banger, that very pressure building
inside him. ''These are the people (who) remind us just how tenuous
mental health is. Our worst fears: They remind us how easy it can
be to slip.''
</P>
<P>
   At almost the same time, a man who sees himself as Atlas with
the world on his shoulders is gunning down pedestrians in Times
Square.
</P>
<P>
   Thus does ''Wonderland'' cross-cut between ''well'' and ''sick''
people going through their day, their paths intersecting without
notice. Let's face it: There is no reliable boundary between us and
them.
</P>
<P>
   We meet the Morgan Stanley broker who, since his divorce, has
turned suicidal. In a wrenching performance, guest star Jay O.
Sanders mourns a terrible loss.
</P>
<P>
   ''Without her, I am unknown,'' the man says of his ex-wife.
''She fed me: my food, my water, my oxygen! She's my heart. Do you
understand that?''
</P>
<P>
   But this wretch is telling it to lover-boy Matthews, who
understands that he can't fathom such devotion. It's a problem for
which he is seeing his own shrink.
</P>
<P>
   During much of ''Wonderland,'' a dozen things are happening at
once. And with multiple realities in force, anything seems
possible.
</P>
<P>
   We see a patient's druggy smile as a tiny rhinoceros scampers
across the floor. Another patient, brought in from the Lincoln
Tunnel, rages at having been dropped by Lloyd's of London from its
''list of preferred customers.'' Anyway, HE believes it.
</P>
<P>
   Grimly funny. Heartbreaking. An eye-opener. And, against all
odds, civilized. This is a series that respects its characters as
well as its audience.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, ''Wonderland'' knows that the rules exist to be
broken. And, happily for viewers, at Rivervue there is no quick
fix.
</P>
<P>

   '20/20': It seemed to be a modern-day ''Romeo and Juliet.'' The
young lovers would end their lives together. Except that Jennifer

Now the young man faces charges of assisted suicide. Jennifer's
parents and Maryland prosecutors believe he played a major role in
the death of the 15-year-old girl. Cynthia McFadden reports on this
twisted and terrible death on ABC News' ''20/20.'' Her report airs
Wednesday at 10 p.m. EST.

<HEADLINE> Spencer Tracy Is the Actor's Actor  </HEADLINE>
By HILLEL ITALIE, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   MILWAUKEE, Wisc. (AP) -- As unglamorous as its namesake, the
Spencer Tracy House doesn't have stars on the front walk or even a
sign on the door. It's a plain, private home made of stucco -- a
''craftsman,'' they call it -- in a quiet neighborhood known as
Story Hill.
</P>
<P>
   No official dedicated this house; the title's just an old
nickname for where the actor lived as a teen-ager, shortly before
World War I. Owners Bob and Judi Rehm keep a few Tracy books and
photos on a living room shelf, but otherwise think of the
connection as simply ''a point of interest.''
</P>
<P>
   ''They told us about Tracy when we were first looking at the
house, but I can't say that affected our decision,'' said Bob Rehm,
who moved here seven years ago.
</P>
<P>
   The city has few reminders of its long-departed native son, a
two-time Academy Award winner who would have turned 100 next week
(April 5). The rare place even to show his picture is the Milwaukee
County Historical Society, which mentions Tracy briefly in a slide
show. (Fellow Milwaukean Pat O'Brien, a lesser actor but apparently
a more solid citizen, gets equal time).
</P>
<P>
   ''The ones who tend to come back to Milwaukee are the ones who
get memorialized,'' said local historian John Gurda, noting city
sites named after Gen. Douglas MacArthur and others. ''Tracy didn't
really make an effort to keep his ties. He never came back.''
</P>
<P>
   However dignified he could be on screen, Tracy was never an easy
role model. He was cranky with the press, cranky on movie sets and
attended no Academy Award ceremonies after 1940, despite several
nominations. His drinking problems were reported even in his
lifetime, and his most lasting romance was with a woman, Katharine
Hepburn, who wasn't his wife.
</P>
<P>
   Neither the city of Milwaukee nor the local historical society
has plans to mark his centennial. A state-run Web site
(www.wpt.org/weekend/century/people--midframe.html) notes his year
of birth but incorrectly credits him with three Oscars. The lone
repertory theater, Times Cinema, will have a weeklong tribute -- in
June.
</P>
<P>
   Tracy, who died in 1967, was a major star for three decades. But
today's public probably thinks of him more as the partner -- public
and private -- of Hepburn. Robert Sklar, a film historian and
professor of cinema studies at New York University, said Tracy
rarely comes up in class. Author Neal Gabler thinks Tracy's fame
suffers for the same reason the actor has been admired.
</P>
<P>
   ''Because Tracy was such an unflamboyant performer, he really
has receded from people's consciousness in ways that Cagney and
Cary Grant and Jimmy Stewart have not,'' said Gabler, whose books
include the Hollywood history ''An Empire of Their Own.''
</P>
<P>
   While Tracy made more than 70 movies, many now are hard to find.
Virtually all of his early work, including the classic ''The Power
and the Glory,'' is unavailable on video. When Times Cinema looked
into screening such later films as ''Judgment at Nuremberg'' and
''Inherit the Wind,'' it couldn't find a usable print.
</P>
<P>
   ''There just hadn't been any demand,'' explained the theater's
co-owner, Eric Levin. He plans instead to show ''Dr. Jekyll and Mr.
Hyde,'' a 1941 release even Tracy didn't care for.
</P>
<P>
   Tracy was an ''actor's actor'' in his lifetime and he remains so
now -- remembered above all by the film community. Each year UCLA
presents the Spencer Tracy Award for lifetime achievement. The
American Film Institute recently ranked him ninth among male
''screen legends.'' (Hepburn tops the women's list). Buried in the
exclusive Forest Lawn cemetery in Glendale, Calif., he has a dark
headstone that reads just ''Tracy,'' no first name needed.
</P>
<P>
   ''When I first began thinking about acting it was obvious Tracy
was one of the masters,'' said the stage and screen performer Brian
Dennehy. ''He was extremely sincere and as he himself said,
'Sincerity is the hardest part of acting. When you can fake that
you really have it made.'''
</P>
<P>
   Born on April 5, 1900, Tracy was a troublemaker more interested
sports than in school. He enlisted in the Navy when the United
States entered World War I -- he never got past training camp -- and
after his discharge spent a year at Ripon College (in Ripon,
Wisc.). Discovering a talent for performing, he moved to New York
to try his luck in the theater. His father had preferred he join
the family trucking business.
</P>
<P>
   Tracy's reputation as an actor begins with a story from the
mid-1920s. He was appearing in the Broadway melodrama ''Yellow''
and the director was the demanding George M. Cohan, who sat in the
front row during one rehearsal and interrupted the actor by banging
his shoes against the orchestra railing.
</P>
<P>
   ''Mister Tracy,'' he called out. ''You are the best actor I have
ever seen!'' Tracy stared back, not sure if he had heard correctly.
''I said,'' Cohan shouted, ''Tracy, you're the best goddamned actor
I've ever seen! Now, go ahead!''
</P>
<P>
   Tracy's first film, ''Up the River,'' came out in 1930. Cohan
was his mentor and Tracy would mind his advice: ''Spencer, you have
to act less.'' Tracy remains the ideal for the clear, ''just learn
your lines'' style used by countless others. Without him, it's hard
to imagine a Gene Hackman or a Richard Farnsworth or an Ed Harris.
They all depend more on character than looks, on craft rather than
charisma.
</P>
<P>
   ''When we look at Tracy we learn something about ourselves,''
Dennehy said. ''A lot of people admire Bogart and want to be like
him. When I was growing up I wanted to be like him, too. But
there's a difference between wanting to be like someone and
learning from someone. One is the definition of a star. The other
is the definition of an artist.''
</P>
<P>
   Robert Duvall once complained that ''You go to old movies, and
you see crappy acting, except for a handful -- like Spencer Tracy.''
Stars in the old Hollywood system were often set personalities --
the ''manly'' Clark Gable, the ''cool'' Myrna Loy -- but Tracy was
different. He could be lighthearted (''Libeled Lady''), explosive
(''Fury''), a criminal (''20,000 Years in Sing'') a priest (''San
Francisco,'' ''Boys Town'').
</P>
<P>
   This year's acting nominations for the Academy Awards paid
unintentional tribute to Tracy. He could have played so many of
those roles: Michael Caine's stern but kindly doctor in ''The Cider
House Rules,'' Farnsworth's single-minded old man in ''The Straight
Story,'' Russell Crowe's moody whistleblower in ''The Insider.''
</P>
<P>
   ''Tracy is an interesting figure because he's a quite complex
synthesis of the stage actor and the movie star,'' said author
Jeanine Basinger, whose books include ''American Cinema: One
Hundred Years of Filmmaking.''
</P>
<P>
   ''He has that low-key, natural quality on film, the underplayed
movie persona. But he also had real theatrical skills and had the
acting chops when needed.''
</P>
<P>
   The rugged-looking Tracy didn't think of himself as a leading
man, but he became part of Hollywood's most beloved screen couple,
paired with a spirited actress once labeled ''box office poison.''
The first of his nine films with Hepburn, the comedy ''Woman of the
Year,'' came out in 1942.
</P>
<P>
   They were a different kind of team. Earlier marital comedies let
nothing get in the way of the fun -- not divorce in ''The Awful
Truth,'' alcoholism in ''The Philadelphia Story'' or suicide in
''His Girl Friday.'' But in ''Woman of the Year'' Tracy sets a firm
tone. Whether the subject is sex or parenthood, he's reserved but
well-spoken, romantic but not unpractical.
</P>
<P>
   ''There's a maturity in terms of how marriage and heterosexual
coupling was treated that was extremely uncommon,'' said film
historian Thomas Schatz, whose books include ''The Genius of the
System'' and ''Boom and Bust.''
</P>
<P>
   Tracy won back-to-back Oscars in the late '30s for ''Captains
Courageous'' and ''Boys Town'' and by middle age he was almost
literally canonized. Frank Sinatra started calling him ''The
Pope.'' As if living up to the part, Tracy let his red hair turn
white and his solid build turn round. While Gable and Grant still
made love to young women on screen, a more typical Tracy role was
the title character in ''Father of the Bride.''
</P>
<P>
   A fighter within the studio system, Tracy proved oddly passive
when the system collapsed after World War II. Unlike Kirk Douglas
or Burt Lancaster, he didn't start his own production company. The
extra pounds only gave him more weight as an actor, but nothing he
did was as risky as the Westerns Jimmy Stewart made with Anthony
Mann or Lancaster's work in ''Sweet Smell of Success.''
</P>
<P>
   Biographers tell a sad story of his last few years. He was
ailing, reclusive and depressed by the deaths of such peers as
Gable, Bogart and Gary Cooper. Although long-separated from his
wife, Louise Treadwell, he couldn't bring himself to divorce her.
Hepburn would write years later that even she never really
understood him.
</P>
<P>
   On screen, meanwhile, he played the Grand Old Man: the clenched,
compassionate face of Justice in ''Judgment at Nuremberg,'' the
high-minded patriarch in ''Guess Who's Coming to Dinner.'' It was
an image Tracy must have longed to live up to, an image of
eloquence and achievement, of conflicts resolved and standards
uncompromised.
</P>
<P>
   ''If you looked behind his eyes there was a great sadness and a
great knowledge of the world, which probably had to do with his own
unhappiness,'' Dennehy said.
</P>
<P>
   ''These days, you have a hardness and a kind of irony. There's a
protective plastic covering over everything. Tracy lived in times
where virtue mattered. And even though his life may not have been
filled with virtue, he still cared about it. His agony, his pain
and his weakness was a great example of someone who wanted to be
better.''

<HEADLINE> Versatile Hands of Awadagin Pratt  </HEADLINE>
By RICHARD BENKE, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBUQUERQUE, N.M. (AP) -- Coffee cups rattle and an oak table
rings like a Zen bell when Awadagin Pratt drums his fingers on it.
If he were at a piano, he'd shake the room.
</P>
<P>
   The hands otherwise seem unremarkable: middle fingers bent
slightly sideways at the joint as if dinged by basketball. Pratt
does play basketball -- three times a week -- but so far his hands
are unscathed.
</P>
<P>
   He drums digits -- b-r-r-umppp! -- to punctuate a point about his
hands, which are not particularly large.
</P>
<P>
   ''That's standard. A pianist's hands are more muscled. Most
people think long, slender fingers; that's just not the case,'' he
says. ''Pianists have pretty thick fingers -- strong muscles.''
</P>
<P>
   So does at least one world-class violinist -- Pratt, again. He
also conducts, something he wanted to do since he was 5. His mother
remembers him waving his arms around while the family listened to
classical music.
</P>
<P>
   ''The only problem I can think of,'' says Pratt's conducting
professor, Frederick Prausnitz, ''is he has too many talents. He's
a brilliant pianist, but any time he wants to be a brilliant
conductor, he can be. I always thought he would.''
</P>
<P>
   Prausnitz, who is retired from the Peabody Conservatory of Music
in Baltimore where he taught Pratt, recalls more than 100
conducting students over the years, ''and most are working as
conductors today.''
</P>
<P>
   Then there's Pratt.
</P>
<P>
   ''He's probably the most basically gifted student I've ever
had,'' Prausnitz said by telephone from Lewes, Del. ''He is one of
my favorite people. All my memories of him are vivid and
wonderful.''
</P>
<P>
   Like the day in class when the orchestra was called upon to play
some music that was ''very thoroughly unpopular.''
</P>
<P>
   ''Awadagin volunteered to conduct it. Within minutes, the
orchestra was sitting up and playing as if they liked it. The class
and I were astonished at what he found in it; he creates something
of his own (in the music),'' Prausnitz says.
</P>
<P>
   The 34-year-old Pratt, who was born into a family of musicians,
has been playing piano since he was 6, doing recitals since he was
9.
</P>
<P>
   That's when he also took up the violin. Now he averages 70
concerts a year worldwide. Venues have included the White House,
Lincoln Center and Wolf Trap. April 1 features a return to the
Kennedy Center. Pratt also performs in April in Rhode Island,
Connecticut, New Jersey, Pennsylvania and Indiana.
</P>
<P>
   His new CD, ''Awadagin Pratt/Transformations'' (EMI Classics),
features Bach's ''Passacaglia and Fugue in C Minor,'' which Pratt
transcribed from the organ work himself, along with Mussorgsky's
''Pictures at an Exhibition'' and Brahms' ''Variations and Fugue in
B-flat on a Theme by Handel.''
</P>
<P>
   Pratt concentrates on piano because of the wealth and range of
music available for piano. And the piano itself offers a wider
range of expression, he said during an interview at his modest
white adobe house in Albuquerque's Old Town.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's possible with the piano to create these lines of music,
like unending phrases -- lines that are both parallel and
intertwining,'' he says over Turkish coffee.
</P>
<P>
   When at home between concerts, Pratt practices at a polished
baby grand in his mirrored living room, which features a Southwest
''kiva''-style fireplace, triangular in the corner. He hums along
while he practices.
</P>
<P>
   Pratt plays much more piano now than violin, but he was a violin
major when he entered the University of Illinois at age 16.
</P>
<P>
   ''I applied as a double major, and they said they don't take
double majors. I ended up just taking the violin audition,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   So Pratt studied piano with a teaching assistant who kept
insisting he audition before the piano faculty, which accepted him
for ''sort of an undeclared double major.''
</P>
<P>
   Peabody allowed multiple majors, and Pratt became the Maryland
conservatory's first student to receive performer certificates in
piano and violin and a graduate performance diploma in conducting.
</P>
<P>
   For most of his life, people have tried to change his approaches
to music: his interpretations, his tempos -- some said faster, some
slower -- the height of his piano bench (he sits low), how he pedals
Beethoven, what he wears (black pants, colorful Versace print
shirts) and whether he should concentrate on piano, violin or the
baton.
</P>
<P>
   One piano teacher told him -- critically: ''You're playing as if
you're Awadagin Pratt,'' meaning he was just a student; he should
conform.
</P>
<P>
   But conform to what? It's all different.
</P>
<P>
   To sort out the conflicting information, Pratt took three months
off in 1991 and went to an arts retreat at Banff, the majestic
mountain resort west of Calgary, Alberta, ''to find my center
again'' and to think about how he needed to work -- how to prepare
for performances, how to learn and relearn the music. With
inspiration from the Canadian Rockies, it was a mission
accomplished.
</P>
<P>
   And he decided to let himself play like Awadagin Pratt.
</P>
<P>
   ''It was amazing,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   In the ensuing year back at Peabody he gave several recitals
and, in 1992, took a first place in the prestigious Naumburg
International Piano Competition. His victory and vindication came
out of left field, but that's typical of the Naumburg, says Ursula
Oppens, one of the Naumburg judges.
</P>
<P>
   ''He's such an imaginative and expressive and exciting young
musician,'' Oppens said by telephone from New York City.
</P>
<P>
   As for what sets Pratt apart, she said: ''His intensity, for
one; the absolute clarity of his sense of structure. He has very
beautiful sounds. He has a large palette of beautiful sounds.''
</P>
<P>
   A key musical influence for Pratt has been the late Glenn Gould,
a piano superstar who quit touring and concentrated on recording.
Pratt started reading about Gould after a teacher remarked that the
lowness of Pratt's piano bench was reminiscent of Gould.
</P>
<P>
   ''I got a book called 'Glenn Gould: Music and Mind.' I had not
listened to anything (by Gould), but I was fascinated by his
intellect and the decisions that he made, and the fact that he did
what he wanted to do in spite of people's opinions,'' Pratt says.
</P>
<P>
   ''And then I started listening to his playing. The work remains
stunning to me.''
</P>
<P>
   To Pratt, music is passionate communication. He finds and tests
the passion in a piece -- ''what made the composer write it'' --
during practice, then releases it during performance.
</P>
<P>
   ''The ideal performance state is an ecstatic one,'' he says,
borrowing an idea from Gould.
</P>
<P>
   Like Gould, Pratt has become very influential among young
musicians, says Oppens, the John Evans Distinguished Professor of
Music at Northwestern University.
</P>
<P>
   And, says Eileen Cline, retired dean of Peabody, don't
underestimate his violin.
</P>
<P>
   Cline recalls his violin audition, the last of the day scheduled
among several. But there had been some cancellations, and some
judges had sought to streamline the day and cancel his, as well.
Cline wouldn't allow it. She sent the panel out for dinner. They
came back to hear Pratt's fiddle, and one of them told her
afterward: ''I'd have slit my throat if I'd missed that.''
</P>
<P>
   His mother, Mildred Pratt, credits her late husband, Theodore
Allatantu Emmanuel Cyril Pratt, for their son's musical
development.
</P>
<P>
   Mildred Pratt has a Ph.D. in social work from the University of
Pittsburgh. She met her husband while he was earning a Ph.D. in
physics from the Carnegie Institute of Technology, also in
Pittsburgh. The Pratts later moved to Normal, Ill., where Awadagin
grew up and where his mother still lives.
</P>
<P>
   Theodore Pratt, who died at age 60 in 1996 after a stroke and a
battle with cancer, had been an accomplished organist. ''He had a
great talent for music,'' Mildred Pratt said. It ran in his family.
</P>
<P>
   ''They were not only gifted in math but in music,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Awadagin's sister, Menah, a year younger, also plays piano and
violin and has a degree in law and a Ph.D. in sociology.
</P>
<P>
   Theodore Pratt was born in Sierra Leone. He came to the United
States as an exchange student in the 1950s. His son's given name,
Awadagin, is Nigerian.
</P>
<P>
   ''It means one who is wise and gives counsel,'' says Pratt, who
moved to Albuquerque in 1993. He says he likes the energy and the
wide-open skies -- and the chess games he plays every week at a cafe
near the University of New Mexico.
</P>
<P>
   ''It seemed the places I had the most powerful feeling about
were Banff and Hawaii and here,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   And perhaps that strong sense of place touches his artistry. But
while he's passionate about the music inside, he calls on the
conductor in him to help oversee the performance, ''directing
traffic and navigating from above.''
</P>
<P>
   ''If I love music and I love playing the piano, I can do that at
home,'' he says. ''The need to play for other people is a need to
share and a need to communicate.''
</P>
<P>
   Pratt doesn't think of himself as having been a child prodigy.
His mother says she and her husband had to prod him to practice,
like any kid. Pratt was more into tennis. Both he and his sister
were ranked players, and he passed up a tennis scholarship to study
music at Illinois.
</P>
<P>
   But a kid gets the seed of such grand thoughts from music, one
reason why Pratt visits schools in about half the cities where he
performs.
</P>
<P>
   Youngsters at George Washington Carver Elementary in Newark,
N.J., heard Pratt a few years back, and then-principal June Lockett
recalls the students, ranging from about 10 to 14 years old, all
wanted to know: ''How'd you learn to play like that?''
</P>
<P>
   Hard work, Pratt told them.
</P>
<P>
   ''He was so down-to-earth, and out of his hands came this
glorious, glorious music,'' Lockett says. ''He talked to the kids.
He wasn't staid at all, nor was he flamboyant. He wore a silk
T-shirt. They wanted to know about his hair, because he had those
beautiful (braided) dreads.''
</P>
<P>
   Pratt feels, perhaps more than anything, the thing that moves
his audiences is his energy. But the overall effect of that energy
also may shock them a little.
</P>
<P>
   ''I sit at the piano differently. I look differently, and
they're just convinced there's going to be a lot happening
differently. I might just be more expressively committed to
communicating,'' he says. ''That energy really gets to people. And
then they decide that something weird is going on.''
</P>
<P>
   Pratt says he's not all that different.
</P>
<P>
   But you haven't heard Mussorgsky, Bach, Beethoven or anybody
else until you've heard him play.
</P>
<P>
   What does it take to realize the potential of a musical gift?
</P>
<P>
   Is it the quickness of an athlete?
</P>
<P>
   ''More than that it's just sort of mental focus. You really have
to concentrate,'' Pratt says.
</P>
<P>
   He carries around every note of his repertoire in his head, but
he returns to the text as if it were a good book one might read
over and over again, always finding something new.
</P>
<P>
   Quickness is part of it, though -- the quickness you might need
in tennis or basketball.
</P>
<P>
   Pratt plays more basketball these days than tennis, joining a
pickup game at a local gym.
</P>
<P>
   At almost 5 feet and 11 inches, he's definitely a guard, driving
the lane and forcing the defense to commit before he either takes
the shot or dishes to the open man.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm wide enough that I can do some stuff in the post,'' he
says.
</P>
<P>
   But he is probably a little too short to play center full-time.
</P>
<P>
   Big men better hope he doesn't take that as a challenge.

<HEADLINE> GOP Pushes Aid Bill for Colombia  </HEADLINE>
By ALAN FRAM, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Amid skepticism by Democrats over U.S.
involvement in Colombia, House Republicans are pushing a $9 billion
measure that also has money for American troops in Kosovo and
natural disasters at home.
</P>
<P>
   The measure contains $1.7 billion for U.S. equipment and
advisers to help Colombia's government battle drug traffickers and
strengthen its tenuous hold on the country. Colombia provides most
of the cocaine and heroin used in the United States, U.S. officials
say.
</P>
<P>
   ''I cannot believe any member is going to pull out the white
flag and say we surrender on the war on drugs,'' said Rep. Porter
Goss, R-Fla.
</P>
<P>
   But many Democrats questioned an escalated American intervention
in the South American country -- even though President Clinton
requested $1.3 billion for Colombia, on top of $300 million already
in the pipeline.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Joe Moakley, D-Mass., said much of the money would be going
to a Colombian military ''with one of the worst human rights
records in the hemisphere.''
</P>
<P>
   Members of both parties predicted passage of the bill, despite
opposition by many Democrats and some conservatives who said the
overall price tag is too expensive. The measure is nearly double
the $5.2 billion Clinton requested.
</P>
<P>
   If anything, the measure is expected to grow even larger.
Pro-defense lawmakers, backed by House GOP leaders, were planning
to try adding $4 billion in extra spending for the Pentagon.
</P>
<P>
   In the Senate, however, Majority Leader Trent Lott, R-Miss.,
said he would to try to block the legislation, dampening prospects
that Congress will provide the money quickly.
</P>
<P>
   He said he wants to provide money for Colombia, U.S.
peacekeeping troops in Kosovo, and aid to East Coast victims of
last fall's Hurricane Floyd. But he said he would take that money,
shrink the rest of the legislation and include what is left in
regular spending bills for fiscal 2001, which begins Oct. 1.
</P>
<P>
   Congress will probably work on those bills into the fall. But
Lott said he hopes the money can be provided in one of them and
approved within the next two months.
</P>
<P>
   Lott said the bill has become ''bloated,'' adding, ''I don't
think we should begin the year in that way.''
</P>
<P>
   No sooner had Lott spoken, however, when the Clinton
administration and members of the Senate Appropriations Committee
began pressuring him to relent.
</P>
<P>
   White House budget chief Jack Lew wrote congressional leaders
that the bill is ''time-sensitive.'' He warned that without quick
approval, the Pentagon would have to curtail training and
maintenance, and victims of Hurricane Floyd ''may have to spend a
second winter in temporary shelters.''
</P>
<P>
   Senate Appropriations Committee Chairman Ted Stevens, R-Alaska,
said he would try pushing his version of the $9 billion bill
through his panel next Tuesday, despite Lott's remarks. Stevens,
who met later with Lott, said he ''didn't ask'' whether Lott would
allow the bill to come to the Senate floor.
</P>
<P>
   The House bill would provide the $2 billion the president wants
for U.S. troops in Kosovo, and nearly twice the $1.1 billion
Clinton requested for Hurricane Floyd and other domestic natural
disasters.
</P>
<P>
   It also has far more for farmers, the Defense Department and
other items than Clinton requested.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Clinton asked Congress on Tuesday to add $253 million
more to the package. The money would be for people who contracted
the HIV virus through blood transfusions, summer jobs for
teenagers, administrative costs of legislation that lets many
elderly people keep their full Social Security benefits and other
items.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the overall bill would be paid for from the budget
surplus. Clinton proposed paying for the new $253 million from
unused federal spending, including money for the Y2K computer
problem.

<HEADLINE> President To OK Soc. Security Bill  </HEADLINE>
By CURT ANDERSON, AP Tax Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Without a dissenting vote, Congress sent
President Clinton legislation repealing a Depression-era law that
reduces the Social Security benefits of thousands of older workers.
The president intends to sign the bill into law.
</P>
<P>
   The bill, passed Tuesday by the House on a 419-0 vote, will
scrap a law that would have cut benefits this year by $1 for every
$3 a Social Security recipients age 65 to 69 earns in outside
income above $17,000.
</P>
<P>
   ''The victory today goes to the hundreds of thousands of older
Americans who don't see retirement as an end, but as a new
beginning,'' said Rep. Bill Archer, R-Texas, chairman of the House
Ways and Means Committee.
</P>
<P>
   Republican leaders today officially dispatched the legislation
to the White House at a public signing ceremony featuring the
oldest member of Congress, 97-year-old Sen. Strom Thurmond, R-S.C.
</P>
<P>
   ''As a working senior myself, I recognize the importance of
staying active,'' Thurmond said. ''It contributes to keeping your
mind and body in shape.''
</P>
<P>
   About 800,000 people are directly affected, including 415,000
due refunds averaging $3,500 each because of deductions made since
Jan. 1 from their Social Security. In all, older workers or their
dependents stand to gain $6 billion in Social Security benefits
this year, or $6,700 each on average, according to the Social
Security Administration.
</P>
<P>
   The House had previously passed the bill unanimously, followed
by the Senate 100-0 last week. The House's action Tuesday was
necessary because of minor changes made by the Senate.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Charles Rangel of New York, senior Democrat on the House
Ways and Means Committee, called the legislation ''long overdue''
and said it demonstrates that Democrats and Republicans can work
together.
</P>
<P>
   ''There are plenty of differences between our parties,'' Rangel
said. ''Certainly, there should be a lot of things we can agree
on.''
</P>
<P>
   Although the legislation would not affect the financial
soundness of the Social Security trust fund over the long term, it
does carry a price tag of $35 million to implement this year.
Clinton has asked Congress to approve that amount for
administrative costs and additional claims expected from people who
delayed retirement because of the cap.
</P>
<P>

<HEADLINE> PM-NJ--Bush, 2nd Ld-Writethru,0873  </HEADLINE>
By GLEN JOHNSON, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEWARK, N.J. (AP) -- George W. Bush, reaching out to moderate
Republicans and Democrats, focused anew on education today and also
suggested that support for abortion rights wouldn't necessarily
disqualify a potential running mate.
</P>
<P>
   Asked about the chances of New Jersey Gov. Christie Todd
Whitman, mentioned by some as a possible No. 2, Bush said as he has
in the past that he is not even working on a list. He also said
their opposing views on abortion were no reason ''we can't be
pulling for the same thing, being on the same team.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush, keeping his emphasis on education, was in New Jersey to
visit a special school that he said proves his point that there are
good options for parents ''dissatisfied with the status quo.''
</P>
<P>
   He also had harsh words for Democratic rival Al Gore, calling
Gore's criticism of his education proposals ''slash and burn
politics.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush, the expected Republican presidential nominee, was asked
about Whitman as a running mate, even though he opposes abortion
and she supports abortion rights.
</P>
<P>
   ''Good people can disagree on the issue, and I understand that
and I'm standing up here with a friend of mine,'' Bush said. ''That
doesn't mean we can't be pulling for the same thing, being on the
same team, and I respect Governor Whitman's views and I respect her
as a person.''
</P>
<P>
   He toured the 3-year-old North Star Academy, an inner-city
charter school where he watched as students in a math class went
through academic calisthenics, racing up and down addition tables
in groups and answering such questions as what is a quadrangle.
</P>
<P>
   Later, in remarks to students clad in polo shirts and khakis,
Bush heralded the school's example.
</P>
<P>
   ''This charter school shows that all children can learn, and I
resent those who stand in the way of education reform, those who
say that giving parents different options if they're dissatisfied
with the status quo isn't right,'' Bush said. ''This is a bottom-up
example of reform. Had we tried to invent North Star at the federal
government, they'd still be in committee hearings.''
</P>
<P>
   The Texas governor spoke at the school the day after rolling out
a $5 billion plan aimed at making sure every child can read by the
end of the third grade.
</P>
<P>
   That proposal brought a critical reaction from Gore, who said
that Bush's $483 billion tax-cut plan would not leave money for any
such programs. Gore's staff also distributed a newspaper article
questioning whether some Texas educational achievements had been
inflated.
</P>
<P>
   Asked about the criticism today, Bush said, ''I know he likes
the slash and burn politics.''
</P>
<P>
   ''The man is going to run a campaign that tries to diminish his
opponent. He has done that in the past. ... I wouldn't say the vice
president is the most objective analyst when it comes to school
reform and progress in schools, but objective analysts have looked
at Texas and realized that we're making great progress toward
achieving educational excellence.''
</P>
<P>
   After a bruising presidential primary campaign, Bush also was
moving toward reconciliation with former primary rivals, reaching
out to John McCain and picking up an endorsement from Steve Forbes.
</P>
<P>
   Bush telephoned McCain on Tuesday while campaigning in suburban
Washington, declaring the ''past is the past'' and laying the
groundwork for a face-to-face meeting down the road.
</P>
<P>
   The Texas governor reached out to McCain after Bob Dole, the
defeated 1996 GOP nominee who has been acting as peacemaker, had
lunch with the Arizona senator and then called Bush.
</P>
<P>
   Bush wants McCain's endorsement, too, but McCain aides said it
is too soon to talk about that.
</P>
<P>
   McCain adviser John Weaver said, ''The ice has been broken.''
</P>
<P>
   ''I think John and I both understand that the past is the past
and it's time to move forward,'' Bush said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Later, Forbes welcomed Bush to his home state of New Jersey with
the endorsement.
</P>
<P>
   ''As the American people are learning and will learn, he is a
good man,'' Forbes told a meeting of Somerset County Republicans in
Manville, N.J. ''He has been tested -- I tried to test him -- and he
emerged the stronger for it.''
</P>
<P>
   The GOP politicking Tuesday threatened to overshadow the
announcement of Bush's $5 billion ''Reading First'' initiative.
</P>
<P>
   It would fund programs to diagnose problem readers, teach
instructors to identify them as such and correct the problem.
Initially targeted at 900,000 kindergarten and first graders, aides
said Bush wants to expand the five-year plan to address second
graders as well.
</P>
<P>
   ''Our economy is the envy of the world; unfortunately, our
schools are not,'' Bush said.
</P>
<P>
   Today's stop at the North Star Academy charter school was aimed
at highlighting Bush's earlier pledges to transfer federal
education authority to the states in return for the development of
accountability standards.
</P>
<P>
   Bush also favors fostering educational competition with
alternatives such as charter schools. North Star, the first such
school in New Jersey, has an enrollment of 144 students -- and a
waiting list of more than 700.

<HEADLINE> Foundations Gave $22.8B in 1999  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Foundations gave away an estimated $22.8 billion
to non-profit organizations last year, a 17.2 percent increase over
the $19.5 billion reported for 1998, according to a study released
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   The expanding economy, dramatic gains in the value of holdings
of several major foundations and a record rise in the value of
corporate foundation endowments propelled the growth in giving,
according to the Foundation Center, which tracks foundation giving.
</P>
<P>
   Sara Engelhardt, president of the Foundation Center, said 1999
was ''a watershed for corporate foundations. They have been
building their assets for several years, and the impact of that
trend is making itself felt in greatly increased giving.''
</P>
<P>
   The Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, for example, has
committed itself to providing $750 million over five years to
vaccinate children in developing countries. The foundation is
expected to give away about $1 billion in grants this year.
</P>
<P>
   The David and Lucile Packard Foundation, among the largest in
the nation, spent $50 million over the last two years toward the
purchase of 271,000 acres in California as part of its conservation
efforts. The foundation hopes to preserve another 500,000 acres in
the next few years.
</P>
<P>
   Much of the rise in giving results from the soaring value of
foundation endowments, which reached $385 billion at the end of
1998, according to the center. By law, most foundations are
required to donate at least 5 percent of their assets each year.
</P>
<P>
   New foundations have also been a factor in increased
grantmaking, according to the report. The number of grantmaking
foundations nearly doubled, from just over 22,000 to nearly 47,000,
between 1980 and 1998. The number of grantmakers grew by more than
5,200, or more than 6 percent a year, in 1997 and 1998.

<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Yields on two-year Treasury notes fell in
Wednesday's auction.
</P>
<P>
   The yield was 6.580 percent, down from 6.590 percent at the last
auction on Feb. 23. It was the lowest rate since two-year notes
sold for 6.434 percent on Jan. 26.
</P>
<P>
   The notes will carry a coupon interest rate of 6{ percent with
each $10,000 in face value selling for $9,985.20.
</P>
<P>
   A total of $12 billion in notes were sold out of bids totaling
$30.8 billion.
</P>
<P>
   Separately, Treasury also sold 19-day cash management bills at a
discount rate of 6.00 percent.
</P>
<P>
   The discount rate understates the actual return to investors --
6.11 percent with a $10,000 bill selling for $9,968.30. A total of
$30 billion in bills were sold out of bids totaling $57.2 billion.

<HEADLINE> Celine Dion Enjoys Life Off Stage  </HEADLINE>
By BETH HARRIS, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   RANCHO MIRAGE, Calif. (AP) -- There are no screaming fans, shows
to perform or awards to accept in Celine Dion's new life.
</P>
<P>
   And she loves it.
</P>
<P>
   ''You don't know how happy I am,'' she said. ''It's wonderful.''
</P>
<P>
   After a decade of having record sales in the millions and
appearing everywhere, Dion began a two-year hiatus from her singing
career in January.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm going to become a professional golfer,'' she joked. ''It's
a game that drives me crazy, but it's a wonderful game.''
</P>
<P>
   She briefly interrupted her self-imposed break to sing five
songs for 1,000 people attending a dinner for an LPGA tournament
here.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm nervous. I haven't trained,'' she told the audience before
launching into her hits ''Because You Loved Me'' and ''My Heart
Will Go On.'' Dion brought three backup singers, but performed to
recorded music.
</P>
<P>
   Dion is comfortable performing in front of thousands of people,
but she's out of her element on the golf course. She's an
18-handicapper whose best round in 2{ years is 84.
</P>
<P>
   ''When I go on stage and I sing a song, I'm nervous, but I know
what I'm doing. I'm sure of myself, I can just go for it. If I make
a mistake, I know where to hit the next note,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   ''On the golf course, I'm an amateur and I'm trying to think of
everything I have to do, but you hear your knees shaking big, big
time.''
</P>
<P>
   Sporting a drastically short hairdo, Dion played with her
husband-manager Rene Angelil in the pro-am of the Nabisco
Championship. In a move sure to jar longtime fans, she got rid of
her famous long locks ''just for fun.'' Her spiky new style is
blond with dark roots showing.
</P>
<P>
   ''Now I don't have to protect an image or be careful because a
new video is coming up for me and I need the long hair,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   One aspect of a superstar's life that she can't escape during
her break is the tabloids. Dion and Angelil are suing the National
Enquirer for $20 million over a Feb. 1 story that said she is
pregnant with twins.
</P>
<P>
   Dion, 32 , denies that she is expecting, going so far as to turn
sideways and lift up her top, revealing a flat stomach that
accentuates her size-2 body.
</P>
<P>
   Asked if the story started because she had been pregnant at one
time, she replied, ''Absolutely not. I've never been pregnant. I
wish, but not yet.''
</P>
<P>
   The Los Angeles Superior Court lawsuit accuses the tabloid of
invasion of privacy, unfair business practices and intentional
infliction of emotional distress. The Enquirer is standing by its
story.
</P>
<P>
   ''We don't think it's right,'' Angelil said. ''We're suing them
and when we win, we will give that money to charities.''
</P>
<P>
   The couple's very public desire to have a baby is one reason
Dion took time off.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is our dream. We would both love for Celine to be
pregnant,'' Angelil said. ''We're working hard on it.''
</P>
<P>
   That comment prompted Dion to jump out of her seat and dash
behind a tournament sign. She slowly peered out at the laughing
crowd, feigning embarrassment.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm enjoying life for the first time very, very much,'' she
said. ''I can be with Rene much more now and it makes me feel
really, really happy.''
</P>
<P>
   Angelil, who had surgery to remove a cancerous lump on his
throat, has been in remission for a year.
</P>
<P>
   ''I feel really great,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Dion said her vacation will definitely last two years.
</P>
<P>
   ''Maybe two and a half, maybe three and a quarter. I love
singing as much as I used to but ... it's a lot of pressure because
I have to deliver. But now I can wake up early, I can go to bed
late. There's no schedule, which I love.''

<HEADLINE> Nashville Sound: Trisha Yearwood  </HEADLINE>
By JIM PATTERSON, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   NASHVILLE, Tenn. (AP) -- Eighteen months ago, Trisha Yearwood
found a new signature song, the title of her new album and a
starting point for a fresh musical direction.
</P>
<P>
   That's when singer-songwriter Bobbie Cryner put ''Real Live
Woman'' in her mailbox.
</P>
<P>
   ''It was just kind of stuffed in there with a note that I might
like it,'' Yearwood said with a laugh. The album was just released
by MCA Nashville.
</P>
<P>
   Though she can match any singer in Nashville for power and
stylistic range, she chose not to pursue the slick pop direction on
the ''Real Live Woman'' CD that has translated into huge sales for
Shania Twain and her imitators.
</P>
<P>
   ''Obviously, the top artists that are selling huge numbers are
doing the pop thing,'' Yearwood said. ''The bottom line if you're
an artist is you've got to make music totally shutting out all of
those (marketplace) influences. Then once that's done ... you sit
down and figure out how to get it out there.''
</P>
<P>
   ''Real Live Woman'' is sung by a mature woman who is brimming
with confidence: ''I don't need to be 19 years old/Or starve myself
for some weight I'm told/Will turn men's heads, been down that
road/And I thank God I finally know just who I am/I'm a real, live
woman.''
</P>
<P>
   It's an earthy sentiment worthy of Tammy Wynette, Loretta Lynn
and K.T. Oslin.
</P>
<P>
   ''Women write and say, 'Thank God, somebody's finally singing a
song about me,''' said Yearwood, 35, dressed in black sweater and
jeans. ''I think I represent a lot more of what's really out there
than what you see in Glamour magazine.''
</P>
<P>
   Recently divorced for the second time, Yearwood admits she isn't
quite as confident as the song's narrator.
</P>
<P>
   ''Sometimes you may not feel that confident, but you want to
hear a song that makes you feel that way,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Yearwood was born and raised in Monticello, Ga. She studied the
music business at Belmont College in Nashville before ''She's in
Love With the Boy'' made her a star in 1991. Her other hits include
the ballad ''How Do I Live,'' the uptempo ''XXX's and OOO's (An
American Girl)'' and the pop confection ''Believe Me Baby (I
Lied).''
</P>
<P>
   During an interview, she reflected on her place in today's
country music scene, which is more Twain than Patsy Cline.
</P>
<P>
   ''If you make an album that's pop because that's who you are and
who you want to be, then cool. I respect (Shania Twain) for making
the music she wants to make. It's different from the music I want
to make. So people like Patty Loveless and I have to make a choice
whether we're going to change our music to sell records. ... And if
you do that, then are you an artist?''
</P>
<P>
   Linda Ronstadt was her original role model, and their voices are
comparable. But she is starting to look at the career of Emmylou
Harris for inspiration. Sometimes Harris sells and sometimes she
doesn't. But she is always interesting.
</P>
<P>
   ''If you make it through the stretch where you've got to
work-work-work-work to make sure you don't disappear and you earn
your place, then you get more artistic freedom and the future's
wide open,'' Yearwood said.
</P>
<P>
   ''Real Live Woman'' was made ''totally from the heart, totally
for the music's sake,'' she said. ''How it's received will
determine what comes next.''

<HEADLINE> Jennifer Wilson Big in Branson  </HEADLINE>
By DOUG JOHNSON, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   BRANSON, Mo. (AP) -- America loves its Jennifers.
</P>
<P>
   Just check the magazine covers at the newsstand: Jennifer Lopez,
Jennifer Aniston, Jennifer Love Hewitt. You can't turn around
without running into a famous Jen.
</P>
<P>
   So if you are trying to make a name for yourself in the
entertainment business, it doesn't hurt to emphasize that you're a
Jennifer. Or in the case of Jennifer Wilson, trademark it, plaster
it all over town, and be the first to grab Jennifer.com as your
official Web site.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's short and sweet and it fits well on the billboards,''
said her manager Bill Dailey. ''I guess you might say it's like
Madonna -- no one really knows her last name, either.''
</P>
<P>
   The name strategy has paid off. After coming to Branson a decade
ago, the singer-dancer is now the only ''Jennifer'' in town.
</P>
<P>
   Thousands of people pack into Wilson's Americana Theater each
year for her variety show, which opens for its eighth season on
April 3.
</P>
<P>
   Her show seems tailored for Branson with a mix of country,
gospel, Texas-swing and show tunes. Wilson's dance numbers range
from the Charleston to disco to a hillbilly step she invented
called the ''Missouri Clog.''
</P>
<P>
   But her name isn't the only thing that Wilson emphasizes. Next
to Branson neighbors Andy Williams and Mel Tillis, this 36-year-old
whippersnapper promises a show with a quick pace unlike any other
in town.
</P>
<P>
   ''I brought a new freshness and innocence to the area,'' the
5-foot-8-inch Wilson said. ''I was happy and perky and young and
could really dance and sing. It was something that was missing from
this market.''
</P>
<P>
   Her billboards, which show off her blond-bombshell looks,
typically get a second or third look from passers-by.
</P>
<P>
   In 1995, she did a remake of Betty Grable's ''Million Dollar
Legs'' pinup photo for the United Service Organizations and sent it
out to thousands of troops worldwide.
</P>
<P>
   Her manger makes no apologies.
</P>
<P>
   ''If you want to be successful, you have to saturate your
market; a picture says a thousand words,'' Dailey said. ''It's not
my fault that she's a tall blonde and that she's built good. It's
an asset.''
</P>
<P>
   Wilson was born in Moberly, a small town in central Missouri.
She studied ballet under Vladimir Mereck of the San Antonio Ballet.
When she was 17, she moved back to central Missouri to open her own
dance studio.
</P>
<P>
   In 1987, she landed a role as the featured dancer and vocalist
at the now-defunct Salt River Opry, a 1,000-seat theater in
northeast Missouri. That's when people advised Wilson to bag the
small market stuff and try her luck in Branson.
</P>
<P>
   ''Everyone always told me I needed to come to Branson to make it
big. I kept saying to myself, 'What's a Branson?''' Wilson said.
</P>
<P>
   ''I happened to come in at about the same time the town just
exploded. Roy Clark came, Tony Orlando came, Charlie Pride, the
Oakridge Boys, Box Car Willie was booming, Jim Stafford was
booming, the Osmonds rolled into town. ... It was just boom, boom,
boom and I was in the middle of it all.''
</P>
<P>
   Wilson was discovered at a talent show by Dailey, a producer
married to romance novelist Janet Dailey. He dropped her last name
and landed her a gig doing the morning show at Roy Clark's
Celebrity Theater.
</P>
<P>
   The ''Jennifer in the Morning Show'' became one of the most
popular early-bird specials in town. So successful, in fact, that
in 1995 she bought her own theater and added evening shows.
</P>
<P>
   ''People used to call me 'Jennifer in the Morning' like it was
my last name,'' she said. ''We still are trying to get people to
stop calling me that.''
</P>
<P>
   More recently, Wilson and Dailey have expanded her role as a
celebrity entertainer for the USO. Her show has been broadcast on
the Armed Forces Television network and she occasionally tours at
U.S. military bases in Europe.
</P>
<P>
   To make sure troops remember her, Wilson hands out the
''Jennifer'' version of the Grable pinup wherever she appears.
</P>
<P>
   Wilson's quick ride to Branson stardom doesn't seem to have gone
to her head. She attributes most of her fortune to God, a little
luck and some good marketing strategies by her manager.
</P>
<P>
   ''Show business is all about facade. If you are not grounded, it
will turn you inside out until you can no longer recognize
yourself,'' she said. ''You must simply have your head on straight
and remember who you are.''

<HEADLINE> Susan Graham: Gatsby to Death Row  </HEADLINE>
By MARY CAMPBELL, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Susan Graham is going from ''The Great Gatsby''
to ''Dead Man Walking.''
</P>
<P>
   Mezzo-soprano Graham sang the part of Daisy Buchanan's friend
Jordan Baker in the premiere of ''The Great Gatsby'' at the
Metropolitan Opera this season. The opera is based on F. Scott
Fitzgerald's novel.
</P>
<P>
   ''John Harbison's music made sense to me,'' Graham said. ''It
was exciting to be part of the collaboration that brings an opera
to life.''
</P>
<P>
   She will sing the role of Sister Helen Prejean in the premiere
of ''Dead Man Walking'' at the San Francisco Opera in October. The
opera is based on Prejean's book, which tells the story of a nun in
Louisiana who is the spiritual adviser to a convicted murderer on
death row. Susan Sarandon won an Oscar for her performance in the
1995 film.
</P>
<P>
   ''A lot of people find a new opera daunting,'' said Graham, 39,
who made her Met debut in 1991. ''With 'Gatsby,' everyone asked,
'Aren't you nervous?'
</P>
<P>
   ''(But) I find it so freeing. It's brand-new. There's no one to
compare you with. It's mine and the composer's and director's
interpretation. It's my job to fuse those elements and breathe life
into a character. To me, that's very freeing and a great
adventure.''
</P>
<P>
   Composer Jake Heggie wrote the part of Sister Prejean with
Graham in mind.
</P>
<P>
   ''He didn't want a soprano,'' she said. ''The first thing that
comes into your mind for this warm and nurturing person isn't a
soprano screaming high notes all night.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think when you're dealing with subject matter that is highly
charged and emotional as 'Dead Man Walking' is, you really want a
vocal portrayal that is going to reach out and touch the
listener.''
</P>
<P>
   She believes that one reason she is cast in modern roles is her
philosophy of naturalism.
</P>
<P>
   ''I have a hard time making sense out of operatic gesture for
the sake of being an operatic gesture. Some directors say, 'You
walk to the right.' I say, 'But why?' Sometimes they have an answer
and sometimes they don't. When they don't, I have to invent one for
myself.''
</P>
<P>
   Besides ''Gatsby,'' Graham sang Cherubino in ''The Marriage of
Figaro'' and Octavian in ''Der Rosenkavalier'' at the Met this
season. Both parts are male teen-agers. Opera composers often write
such parts for mezzo-sopranos.
</P>
<P>
   Cherubino has been a staple of Graham's career. ''But you can
only sing Cherubino for so long. It's a great role, but at a
certain point you move on and sing mature woman characters, as
opposed to teen-age boys. After a while, you get a little tired of
hiding under chairs. I can't get under them as easily anymore.''
</P>
<P>
   A year ago in Paris, Graham sang in her first Handel opera, the
1735 ''Alcina,'' with Renee Fleming in the title role. She was one
of Fleming's ardent young suitors. Graham will sing ''Ariodante''
in Houston next year.
</P>
<P>
   ''I sang 'Iphigenie en Aulide' (1774) in Salzburg last summer,''
Graham said. ''It was my first dive into Gluck and it was pretty
exciting. I'm starting the path that leads to heroic ladies in
opera. I think that's fitting for an artist who is moving out of
the early years of her career.''
</P>
<P>
   Graham remembers the first time she heard ''Der Rosenkavalier.''
It was a performance at the Met in 1983. She was visiting New York
on a college trip.
</P>
<P>
   ''It was Kiri Te Kanawa, Kathleen Battle and Tatiana Troyanos as
Octavian. ... I thought, 'I really think I'm going to be able to do
that. Wouldn't it be nice to do it on this stage someday?'
</P>
<P>
   ''Sometimes if you don't have exposure to great things, you
don't know they exist on the level they do. Before that day, I
don't think I had any idea.
</P>
<P>
   ''I grabbed the roller coaster as it went swinging by and hung
on. I'm still trying to hang on,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   She follows her Met Opera season with singing Octavian at
London's Covent Garden and an April recital tour to seven
countries.

<HEADLINE> Five Questions With Joshua Jackson  </HEADLINE>
By SAMANTHA CRITCHELL, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Rising star Joshua Jackson is ambitious, but not
in the traditional sense of the word.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm not ambitious in the business world, I'm not ambitious in
the money world beyond what I need to live off of. But I am
extremely ambitious in my personal life.
</P>
<P>
   ''I have high expectations of myself as a person, but my
ambition is more to succeed as a human being than a business
entity,'' said Jackson -- without a trace of pretension or piousness
-- during a recent interview.
</P>
<P>
   But for someone who says he isn't worried about building a
career, the 21-year-old is well on his way. He is familiar to TV
audiences as Pacey on The WB's ''Dawson's Creek.'' He has top
billing in ''The Skulls'' and is one of the stars of ''Gossip,''
scheduled for release in April.
</P>
<P>
   In ''The Skulls,'' Jackson's character joins a secret society at
an Ivy League college to use the group's connections to get into
law school. But by joining the society, he is forced to choose
between new friends and old.
</P>
<P>
   Jackson said that's not an issue in his personal life.
</P>
<P>
   He pals around with his ''Dawson's Creek'' co-stars while on
location in Wilmington, N.C. But when the show goes on hiatus, he
heads for Vancouver, British Columbia, to spend as much time as
possible with his family and friends.
</P>
<P>
   Despite its young cast, Jackson said the predominant theme of
''The Skulls'' -- choosing whether to stand strong or stand alone --
is relevant at every age.
</P>
<P>
   1. What is different about your life compared with other
21-year-olds?
</P>
<P>
   Jackson: I'm really a normal guy with an abnormal job.
</P>
<P>
   2. And that job has led to many fans. How does it feel when you
arrive for a public appearance and scores of teen-agers are waiting
for you?
</P>
<P>
   Jackson: Nobody is responding to me, they're responding to the
characters I'm playing. ... But I'd rather have people waiting to
see me because that means I'm doing a good job.
</P>
<P>
   3. Have you ever been in a secret society like your ''The
Skulls'' character?
</P>
<P>
   Jackson: I was in a hockey club.
</P>
<P>
   3{: Would Joshua Jackson join a secret society?
</P>
<P>
   Jackson: I don't think there is anything necessarily bad about a
club. However, the particular rituals of the Skull and Bones and
the bad habit that the membership has of achieving extremely
powerful positions in American society leads me to believe that the
agenda of the Skull and Bones is perhaps to the detriment of
society at large.
</P>
<P>
   4. Do you prefer working in movies or television?
</P>
<P>
   Jackson: They are totally different beasts. The workload on
television can be oppressive at times. It's 10 months day-in and
day-out. A movie is higher pressure, higher energy, but for a
shorter amount of time.
</P>
<P>
   As far as the acting goes, the upshot of television is that you
get to work with the same people, so you can reach a comfort zone
so that you're not worried about failing. You're in a very
protective society. In a film, the fun is taking the story of a
character where you know the definitive beginning and the
definitive ending and fleshing out everything in between.
</P>
<P>
   5. How do you choose your roles?
</P>
<P>
   Jackson: Taking a movie just because you think it'll help your
career seems beside the point to me. You can never tell if it's
going to work. You can group together the 50 most talented people
you know and have an unlimited budget and still produce a terrible
movie -- which happens sometimes. ... The decision process for me is
based on how much I think I will enjoy the experience.

<HEADLINE> Iraq Fears Sharp Drop in Oil Prices  </HEADLINE>
By LEON BARKHO, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) -- Iraq is determined to boost its own oil
output although it fears a sharp drop in prices following OPEC's
decision to raise production, senior Oil Ministry officials said
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Iraq tried to persuade its partners in the Organization of
Petroleum Exporting Countries to delay a decision on raising output
until later this year. But under heavy pressure from Western
nations, including the United States, nine OPEC members agreed
Tuesday to add a total of 1.45 million barrels a day to the
production ceiling.
</P>
<P>
   Iraq is exempt from the 11-nation cartels quotas because it is
under U.N. sanctions to punish it for its 1990 invasion of Kuwait.
Iran, which declined to go along with the OPEC majority, on
Wednesday said it would raise output.
</P>
<P>
   An Iraqi oil official called OPEC's decision harmful because it
will reduce the price for crude oil. But the official, speaking on
customary condition of anonymity, said this would not affect Iraq's
plan to raise its own output to 3 million barrels a day in coming
weeks.
</P>
<P>
   At that level, Iraq should be able to export up to 2.4 million
barrels a day. Iraq's exports in recent weeks fell to 1.6 million
barrels a day.
</P>
<P>
   An official at Iraq's State Organization for the Marketing of
Oil said Iraqi exports are on the increase and should soon exceed 2
million barrels a day.
</P>
<P>
   Iraq has had trouble increasing production because of the poor
condition of its oil field equipment and refineries. The U.N.
Security Council is expected later this week to approve a
resolution doubling the $300 million in funding for spare parts for
Iraq's oil industry.
</P>
<P>
   Under the U.N. sanctions, Iraq must use funds from its crude oil
sales for the U.N.-supervised oil-for-food program, which provides
food and medicine to the country's 22 million people.

<HEADLINE> Nasdaq Down 166.38; Dow Down 7.05  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Technology stocks fell sharply today as
investors once again took profits from their recent rally.
Blue-chip computer makers and high-flying Internet companies were
lower, weighing on major market indexes.
</P>
<P>
   In afternoon trading on Wall Street, the technology-heavy Nasdaq
composite index was down 166.38 at 4,667.51. Decliners outnumbered
advancers by a 5-to-2 margin.
</P>
<P>
   Other stock indicators fared better. The Dow Jones industrial
average was down 7.05 at 10,929.06 and the Standard &AMP; Poor's 500
index was down 6.69 at 1,501.04.
</P>
<P>
   Since the Nasdaq composite index hit its last record March 10,
investors have begun selling technology stocks to garner profits
from their big run. Selling gathered momentum on Tuesday, when Abby
Joseph Cohen, Goldman Sachs's chief investment strategist, said
many technology stocks are now fully valued and have little room
for further gains.
</P>
<P>
   Applied Materials fell 4 15/16 to 97[, Sun Microsystems lost 3}
to 96~ and Yahoo! fell 10| to 184]. Dow component Hewlett-Packard
fell 5 7/16 to 135 7/16.
</P>
<P>
   Also, Redback Networks was off 19 13/16 at 269} and eBay fell 17
31/64 to 206 21/64.
</P>
<P>
   ''There's some carryover concern that a lot of these stocks are
overvalued,'' said Barry Berman, managing director of equity
trading for Robert W. Baird &AMP; Co. in Milwaukee. ''So there's money
coming out of stocks that are highly priced relative to earnings
and into some groups that had been ignored for a long time.''
</P>
<P>
   Some of those sectors, analysts said, are pharmaceuticals and
retailers. Today, Merck rose 2 5/16 to 63} and WalMart gained 2
11/16 to 57 3/16, keeping the Dow in positive territory.
</P>
<P>
   Also, oil stocks rose after OPEC oil ministers agreed on
production increases to boost the world's crude oil supplies.
Analysts forecast improved profit margins for oil companies,
helping the sector gain ground even as prices of crude oil tumbled
on world markets. Exxon Mobil was up 2[ to 81[.
</P>
<P>
   A flurry of new deals by AT&AMP;T dominated activity in the
telecommunications sector.
</P>
<P>
   AT&AMP;T fell 1 1/16 to 58] in active trading. After the close of
Tuesday's regular session, the company revealed details of its
long-awaited tracking stock for the fast-growing wireless business.
AT&AMP;T wants to sell between 360 million and 414 million shares in
the new AT&AMP;T Wireless Group for between $26 and $32 per share. The
offering, expected in late April or early May, could raise as much
as $13.25 billion and would be the biggest initial public offering
in U.S. history.
</P>
<P>
   AT&AMP;T helped buoy shares of Excite At Home, which rose 2 1/16 to
36]. The company, a provider of cable Internet access, extended
distribution arrangements with AT&AMP;T through 2008. Also, AT&AMP;T
offered to buy out two of its partners in its relationship with
Excite At Home, giving Comcast and Cox Communications the right to
sell their Excite At Home shares to AT&AMP;T for a minimum price of 48
per share.
</P>
<P>
   A year ago today, the Dow closed above the 10,000-point
threshold for the first time. Since then, the blue-chip index has
risen as much as 13 percent above the mark and has dipped back
below it several times. Currently, the Dow is about 9 percent above
10,000.
</P>
<P>
   Advancing issues outnumbered decliners by a 10-to-9 margin on
the New York Stock Exchange, where volume came to 684.43 million
shares, slightly ahead of Tuesday's pace.
</P>
<P>
   The Russell 2000 index of smaller companies fell 16.23 to
542.81.

<HEADLINE> Sister Turns In Kidnapping Suspect  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   GAINESVILLE, Fla. (AP) -- The man suspected of kidnapping a
10-year-old girl from her driveway and holding her for three days
was turned in by his sister after he told relatives he had ''done a
horrible crime,'' according to court papers.
</P>
<P>
   James P. Johnson's sister, Sheryl Stutz, called sheriff's
deputies on March 14 and told them what he had said, according to
an application for a search warrant released Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson, 38, was arrested the next day and charged with the
March 6 abduction of Jessica Rodriguez, who was snatched by the
driver of a Jeep Cherokee after she got her school bus. She was
released three days later at a Gainesville Wal-Mart after being
held inside a house.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson was jailed on kidnapping charges, one of them alleging
lewd and lascivious acts against a child.
</P>
<P>
   In most cases, The Associated Press does not identify the
victims of sexual assault. In this case, however, the name of the
victim had been widely used because of the circumstances of her
abduction.
</P>
<P>
   Jessica told detectives the house where she was held had blue
carpet, an unusual table lamp with ornate leaves and a framed Monet
print or ocean scene on the wall, according to the application for
a warrant to search Johnson's home.
</P>
<P>
   When Jessica was left alone, she was tied to a bolt on the floor
with a length of plastic-coated wire, she told detectives. She also
said her kidnapper played pornographic videos, some featuring
children.
</P>
<P>
   According to the application, Johnson's family told detectives
that in the days after the girl's release, Johnson changed the
tires and seat covers of his Cherokee, cleaned and removed the
furniture from the bedroom-bathroom suite in his home and returned
a gift lamp to his sister.
</P>
<P>
   He told relatives he had ''done a horrible crime'' and probably
would be imprisoned for years, the court documents said.
</P>
<P>
   He then checked himself into a mental hospital, where he was
arrested.
</P>
<P>
   Tom Kurrus, a lawyer hired by the family to represent Johnson,
said Stutz has no intention of claiming a $15,000 reward that was
offered for the kidnapper's arrest.

<HEADLINE> Reform Rabbis Debate Gay Marriage  </HEADLINE>
By ESTES THOMPSON, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   GREENSBORO, N.C. (AP) -- Reform Jewish leaders debated on
Wednesday whether to give rabbis the option of presiding at gay
commitment ceremonies.
</P>
<P>
   With a vote in favor of the resolution, the Central Conference
of American Rabbis would become the most influential U.S. religious
group to sanction same-sex unions.
</P>
<P>
   The resolution would apply to the 1,800 members of the Central
Conference of American Rabbis, who serve at least 1.5 million
Reform Jews. Reform Judaism is the largest and most liberal of
Judaism's three major branches in North America.
</P>
<P>
   ''If it passes, this will be a groundbreaking resolution in that
a major religious body will have indicated its support for any of
its clergy who decide to officiate at same-gender ceremonies,''
said Rabbi Paul Menitoff, the conference's executive vice
president.
</P>
<P>
   Because of the issue's volatility, some sessions at the group's
annual convention here this week were held privately. Two years
ago, the rabbis delayed voting on a similar proposal.
</P>
<P>
   The resolution reads: ''The relationship of a Jewish,
same-gender couple is worthy of affirmation through appropriate
Jewish ritual. In accordance with the principles of Reform Judaism,
each rabbi should decide about officiation according to his/her own
rabbinic conscience.''
</P>
<P>
   Some female rabbis introduced the resolution in January.
</P>
<P>
   An alternative proposal urged the Reform rabbinate to
''strengthen its efforts to seek justice for gays and lesbians in
American society'' by pushing for civil and political rights for
partners. It stopped short of sanctioning same-sex unions.
</P>
<P>
   The Torah condemns male homosexual intercourse, but Reform
Judaism now supports same-sex civil unions and a decade ago
approved openly gay rabbis. Some Reform rabbis have already
officiated at same-sex ceremonies at synagogues.
</P>
<P>
   Reform Judaism's rabbinate bases its position on contemporary
understanding of homosexuality and the Jewish values of human
dignity and justice.
</P>
<P>
   Opponents feared the resolution would divide rabbis and alienate
Reform Judaism from Israel, where it seeks stronger recognition.
</P>
<P>
   ''The bottom line is that the Reform rabbinate is deeply divided
on this issue,'' said Rabbi Clifford Librach of Temple Sinai of
Sharon, Mass. ''We're not opposed to the dignity and Jewish
integrity of gays and lesbians in our midst.''
</P>
<P>
   The Union of American Hebrew Congregations, a coalition of 895
Reform congregations, has approved resolutions supporting civil
unions and nondiscrimination against gays, and the Unitarian
Universalist Association has officially endorsed decisions by its
clergy to perform same-sex unions.
</P>
<P>
   Presbyterian, United Methodist and Episcopal church leaders are
expected to take up the issue this year.

<HEADLINE> Pension Back-Up Fund in Good Health  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Thanks to the strong economy, the government's
back-up fund for private workers' pensions had a surplus of $7
billion in 1999.
</P>
<P>
   It was the fourth consecutive year in the black for the Pension
Benefit Guaranty Corp., after 20 years of deficits that reached a
high of $2.9 billion in 1993.
</P>
<P>
   ''The millions of Americans whose pension benefits are backed up
by PBGC can be assured that there is a strong PBGC protecting their
retirement security,'' Labor Secretary Alexis Herman said.
</P>
<P>
   The PBGC insures nearly 40,000 private pension plans relied upon
by about 43 million Americans, promising to pay benefits if
employers fail to. It is financed from insurance premiums paid by
companies as required under a 1974 law.
</P>
<P>
   A separate account kept by PBGC to insure pension plans that are
jointly sponsored by several employers had a surplus of $199
million in 1999.
</P>
<P>
   The agency has taken responsibility for paying benefits to about
532,000 people, either retired now or in the future, who were
enrolled in 2,785 corporate pension plans that have terminated.
</P>
<P>
   In 1999, PBGC paid $902 million in benefits to 214,890 people.
</P>
<P>
   The strong economy has helped the pension back-up fund because
there have been fewer failures of corporate pension plans and the
reserve account's own investments have done better.
</P>
<P>
   But the fund's executive director, David M. Strauss, said,
''Although our financial condition is strong today, we must always
remain vigilant.''

<HEADLINE> Greek Mayor Discusses Globalization  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- As globalization makes the world smaller, the
role of cities is growing in size and importance, the mayor of
Athens said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Dimitris Avramopoulos said cities can act with greater speed
than national governments in dealing with everyday problems and
finding practical solutions because they are unhampered by the
competing interests of central governments and their bureaucracies.
</P>
<P>
   ''The number of questions which cannot be tackled at the level
of the nation state is growing,'' Avramopoulos said in a speech to
the Woodrow Wilson International Center for Scholars.
''Accordingly, today's globalized and interdependent world requires
solutions to be found within the framework of a structure and
organization beyond the nation state.''
</P>
<P>
   Avramopoulos, a former diplomat and member of the Greek
parliament, is on a trip promoting the budding ''united cities of
the world'' program.
</P>
<P>
   He and other mayors from around the world took part in a summit
in Paris last week designed to show the political will of local
leaders to assume a bigger role on the international stage. He will
host the mayors' second summit in Athens in 2002.
</P>
<P>
   Avramopoulos said a growing proportion of the world's population
now lives in cities. As an example he cited the 15 member states of
the European Union, 80 percent of whose population now lives in
cities compared to 40 percent at the end of World War II.
</P>
<P>
   ''For a vast proportion of the world's population,''
Avramopoulos said, ''their town, their city constitutes the
predominant point of reference of their identity and social,
political and cultural awareness.''
</P>
<P>
   He said that while many of the world's problems are global in
cause, their impact is most acutely felt at the local level, ''so
it is not surprising that more and more people are looking towards
the city'' for solutions.
</P>
<P>
   An example of the new reality, Avramopoulos said, was the
cooperation between Athens and Istanbul last year when devastating
earthquakes hit the historically hostile nations of Greece and
Turkey.
</P>
<P>
   ''Cities reacted quickly, while the state machinery, driven by
other imperatives and interests, remained mistrustful, at least at
the beginning,'' Avramopoulos said.

<HEADLINE> Last-Minute Rush Causes Tax Errors  </HEADLINE>
By CURT ANDERSON, AP Tax Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- As Americans enter the stretch run of the
dreaded tax filing season, it is easy in the last-minute rush to
make mistakes or misunderstand the law. The most common mistake:
putting down the wrong Social Security number. The top myth:
believing that tax law is an exact science with yes-or-no answers
to every question.
</P>
<P>
   ''Tax law is subject to interpretation based on factual
situations,'' said Sanford Warren, a tax accounting instructor at
Millsaps College in Jackson, Miss. ''Always establish the facts
first and then ask the questions.''
</P>
<P>
   Warren and Richard Davis, an accounting professor at Susquehanna
University in Selinsgrove, Pa., are both former Internal Revenue
Service officials who have compiled lists of the top mistakes and
myths encountered year in and year out by taxpayers. This year's
filing deadline of midnight April 17 is fast approaching, and
millions of people have yet to file.
</P>
<P>
   To the IRS, Social Security numbers are the coin of the realm --
they establish a taxpayer's identity and those of any dependents.
Taxpayers often transpose numbers or forget to let the Social
Security Administration know when a woman marries and changes her
name, which can lead to a computer mismatch that raises a red flag
at the IRS.
</P>
<P>
   People also frequently fail to put a child's Social Security
number on the forms, which is needed to claim a dependent
exemption, a child care credit or the earned income tax credit.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, out of roughly 125 million returns, the IRS got
nearly 1.7 million with a Social Security mistake. ''That's the top
math error we see,'' agency spokesman Don Roberts said. The IRS
will notify taxpayers about the mistake and allow it to be
corrected over the phone, but it can slow down a refund.
</P>
<P>
   Other frequent tax errors:
</P>
<P>
   --Making math miscalculations, particularly among lower-income
people who claim the complicated earned income tax credit. For
taxpayers who are not using a computer or a tax professional, Davis
and Warren say careful double-checking of the math is essential.
</P>
<P>
   --Forgetting to sign and date the tax return. If a joint return
is being filed, both spouses must sign even if one had no income to
report.
</P>
<P>
   --Failing to attach all the proper paperwork, such as a W-2 form.
</P>
<P>
   --Reporting income in the wrong place. For example, many people
report earnings from money market funds as interest when the IRS
can consider them a dividend. ''The IRS computer will think that
you underreported your income in the amount of the missing
dividends -- and you will be receiving unwanted mail,'' Davis said.
</P>
<P>
   --Unnecessarily declaring a state tax refund from last year as
income. It is not.
</P>
<P>
   People also believe a number of myths about tax law and what
happens when they file their tax returns.
</P>
<P>
   For instance, people frequently delay filing a tax return past
the April deadline because they believe they must have all the
money in hand before the paperwork can go to the IRS. In fact, a
taxpayer should always file the return as soon as possible to avoid
penalties, although interest will be charged on the amount due.
</P>
<P>
   ''Willful failure to file a return is a federal crime,'' Davis
warned.
</P>
<P>
   The IRS also has a number of options now for people who cannot
pay, such as payment over the telephone by credit card and easily
approved installment agreements. Sometimes taking out a loan is
better than paying IRS interest rates.
</P>
<P>
   Some other tax myths:
</P>
<P>
   --''People who owe zero taxes don't need to file.'' Not
necessarily, because workers who had taxes withheld from their
paychecks may be due a refund.
</P>
<P>
   --''The IRS can go back many years to audit my returns.'' The
statute of limitations is three years, unless fraud is involved.
</P>
<P>
   --''I must do whatever the IRS tells me, even if I disagree.''
Taxpayers can request a meeting with IRS managers to contest an
agent's conclusion, take their case to the Taxpayer Advocate or the
agency's appeals process. The U.S. Tax Court is another avenue for
taxpayers to bring disputes with the IRS.
</P>
<P>
   --''I got a refund, so I know the IRS won't audit me.'' A refund
is not a sign that the IRS agrees with a tax return, only that the
math is correct. An audit can still occur within three years.
</P>
<P>
   --''Child support payments are tax deductible.'' Not so. Alimony
payments are, however, and the recipient has to declare them as
income.
</P>
<P>
   --''Single people living together can file a joint tax return.''
Couples must be married to file jointly. In fact, if each partner
has roughly the same income filing jointly could trigger the
''marriage penalty'' that forces them to pay higher taxes.

<HEADLINE> LifeSavers Keeping Pineapple Flavor  </HEADLINE>
By WAYNE PARRY, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   TRENTON, N.J. (AP) -- Jim Goldman doesn't want to be known as the
man who presided over the candy equivalent of New Coke. So he's
keeping LifeSavers' basic Five Flavor roll just the way it is,
complete with pineapple.
</P>
<P>
   The company, a division of Parsippany-based Nabisco Inc., had
toyed with the idea of dropping pineapple from the Five Flavor
roll, which is to hard candy as the Dow Jones Industrial Average is
to the stock market.
</P>
<P>
   But a wave of telephone and Internet votes from customers
thought the idea was, well, un-holey.
</P>
<P>
   ''There are a lot of pineapple aficionados out there,'' said
Goldman, LifeSavers' president. ''That's what they want, so that's
what we're going to give them.''
</P>
<P>
   He said the company did research indicating that pineapple was
the least popular of the Five Flavor roll, which also includes
lime, lemon, cherry and orange, and has been sold that way for 65
years.
</P>
<P>
   They thought adding strawberry or watermelon would boost sales
and please palates. So they set up special telephone lines and an
Internet site to let people decide whether to deep-six pineapple.
</P>
<P>
   More than a million votes were cast, and Goldman says there's no
evidence they all came from just one die-hard pineapple disciple.
Pineapple tallied 54 percent of the vote, whipping watermelon (25
percent) and strawberry (21 percent.)
</P>
<P>
   To celebrate pineapple's reprieve, the company is hiding special
pineapple-only rolls among shipments of Five Flavor. Those who get
one will win its weight in gold, a prize Goldman said could be
worth as much as $4,000.

<HEADLINE> Poll: Giuliani-Clinton dead heat; mayor hurt by police shooting  </HEADLINE>
By MARC HUMBERT, AP Political Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) -- With voters overwhelmingly disapproving of
his handling of the fatal shooting by New York City police of an
unarmed man, Mayor Rudolph Giuliani's slight lead over Senate rival
Hillary Rodham Clinton has disappeared, a statewide poll reported
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   It was the second poll this week to show that.
</P>
<P>
   The latest poll, from Marist College's Institute for Public
Opinion, had the Republican mayor of New York City favored by 46
percent of registered voters and the first lady backed by 43
percent, a statistical tie given the poll's error margin.
</P>
<P>
   With one exception -- in October, when the Marist poll had
Giuliani at 46 percent and Clinton at 42 percent, also a
statistical tie -- the mayor has been leading the first lady in the
Marist poll since July of last year. He led, 47 percent to 41
percent, just last month in the Marist poll.
</P>
<P>
   A New York Post poll, out Sunday from Zogby International, also
showed the race had become a statistical dead heat, erasing an
earlier lead held by the mayor. The Zogby poll had Clinton at 45
percent with the mayor at 42 percent. Three weeks earlier, Giuliani
led Clinton, 49 percent to 42 percent.
</P>
<P>
   As in previous polls, the new Marist poll showed a relatively
small number of undecided voters, 11 percent statewide, with the
election still more than seven months away.
</P>
<P>
   The Poughkeepsie-based pollsters found that 50 percent of voters
disapproved of the mayor's handling of the police shooting of
Patrick Dorismond while 26 percent approved.
</P>
<P>
   The mayor has come under heavy criticism for releasing criminal
records about Dorismond, including sealed juvenile records, in the
wake of the police shooting.
</P>
<P>
   In New York City, 72 percent of voters disapproved of the
mayor's handling of the situation with just 18 percent backing him.
In traditionally more conservative upstate New York, 41 percent of
voters disapproved of Giuliani's actions while 25 percent approved.
Only in the suburban counties surrounding the city was the mayor's
handling of the case not a major negative for him, with 40 percent
disapproving and 38 percent approving, a statistical tie.
</P>
<P>
   Marist pollster Lee Miringoff said the backlash against Giuliani
played into the hands of the Clinton camp.
</P>
<P>
   ''When Rudy looks like a one-man wrecking crew, that's the image
that they like to have in terms of making the case that he can't
work well with others,'' the pollster said.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, voters gave the edge to Clinton, 49 percent to 40
percent, when asked who would work better with others in the
Senate. Giuliani led, 55 percent to 34 percent, when it came to
being a fighter for New York.
</P>
<P>
   Miringoff warned that with so many voters having already made up
their minds about the race, and with the high negatives for both
candidates -- Clinton with a 46 percent unfavorable rating and
Giuliani at 36 percent -- ''these blunders don't create stampedes''
when it comes to shifts in the poll results.
</P>
<P>
   The relatively small shift was noted by Giuliani.
</P>
<P>
   ''If you're asking me has there been some fallout, yes,'' he
said. ''If you're asking me has it been major, that poll would
actually come to the opposite conclusion where you would say, 'Gee,
with a torrent of bad publicity, whatever the cause of it, you
wouldn't think I'd be three points ahead.'''
</P>
<P>
   ''This latest poll proves New Yorkers will not fall for the
negative, divisive style of politics Mrs. Clinton continues to
use,'' said Bruce Teitelbaum, Giuliani's campaign manager.
</P>
<P>
   ''Hillary is going to continue running a race of issues, not
insults,'' Clinton campaign spokesman Howard Wolfson said.
</P>
<P>
   The telephone poll of 561 registered voters was conducted Monday
and Tuesday and has a margin of error of plus or minus 4 percentage
points.
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday, Clinton was returning from California after a
three-day, fund-raising foray to the West Coast while Giuliani
attended a major fund-raising luncheon for expected Republican
presidential nominee George W. Bush in New York City.
</P>
<P>
   Giuliani, whose fund-raising reception in Washington, D.C., on
Tuesday attracted Sen. John McCain, plans to visit Salt Lake City
and Phoenix on Friday to raise money for his campaign. Democrats
were quick to note that Giuliani had said earlier this week that
his time to campaign in upstate New York was limited because of his
mayoral duties.
</P>
<P>
   ''The Rudy Giuliani hypocrisy tour rolls on,'' said David
DiMartino, a spokesman for the Democratic Senatorial Campaign
Committee. ''Rudy says he is too busy for upstate, but not too busy
to go out of state.''

<HEADLINE> Poll: Clinton's Policy on China Good  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Americans are increasingly pleased with the
Clinton administration's dealings with China, but support for the
Kosovo operation has slipped, according to a national poll.
</P>
<P>
   Despite China's recent threats against Taiwan, the poll by the
Pew Research Center shows a softening of criticism of the
administration's stance on China, where issues have ranged from
trade to human rights. In the poll, 42 percent of respondents said
Clinton's dealings are ''about right,'' compared to 35 percent nine
months ago. The percent saying U.S. dealings are ''not tough
enough'' has dropped from 51 percent to 42 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Even with no American deaths or serious casualties, support for
U.S. military operations in Kosovo has declined from 57 percent in
June 1999 to 51 percent in the latest survey, conducted March
15-19.
</P>
<P>
   Among Republicans, support for the Kosovo deployment declined
from 49 percent to 44 percent and among Democrats from 66 percent
to 61 percent.
</P>
<P>
   The poll of 1,184 adults has a margin of error of plus or minus
3.5 percentage points.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Hails OPEC Production Boost  </HEADLINE>
By SONYA ROSS, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Calling the OPEC oil production increase
''good news for our economy and for the American consumer,''
President Clinton urged the U.S. oil industry today to quickly pass
the savings on to consumers. ''Right now, I think the prudent thing
is to see how quickly these prices can come down,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton said he doubts Congress will vote to repeal the
4.3-cent-a-gallon gasoline tax he helped push to passage in 1993,
and that the only legislation that should be enacted quickly was a
bill in the House to renew his authority over the oil stockpile in
the strategic petroleum reserve. The authority expires on Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Oil supplies and prices were a recurrent topic at Clinton's news
conference, which ranged also over politics, campaign reform, China
trade and other issues.
</P>
<P>
   The president said his embattled proposal to Congress to approve
Chinese membership in the World Trade Organization -- even Vice
President Al Gore, campaigning to succeed him, has reservations --
is a clear benefit to the U.S. economy.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is a hundred to nothing deal for America when it comes to
the economic consequences,'' Clinton said. He said that if Congress
balked, the benefits of increased trade would go instead to Europe
and Japan.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton said he agrees with Gore that deals on trade terms
should include environmental and labor-standard requirements -- and
that the vice president should pursue that ''when he gets to be
president.''
</P>
<P>
   The president also endorsed Gore's proposal for a ''Democracy
Endowment'' of $7 billion to be raised in tax deductible donations
over the next seven years to finance congressional election
campaigns beginning in 2008.
</P>
<P>
   ''I kind of wish I'd thought of it myself,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton said the OPEC agreement to increase production by 6.3
percent should reduce both home heating costs and gasoline prices
over the next few weeks, and he asked the American industry to try
to accelerate those price breaks.
</P>
<P>
   ''I urge the oil companies to do everything they can to bring
savings to consumers as quickly as possible,'' Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
   He also said Congress should act now on a long-term energy plan
to promote U.S. production and the development of alternate fuel
sources. ''We can become much more energy efficient,'' Clinton
said.
</P>
<P>
   With that, he turned to his agenda for the Republican Congress
this year, on gun control and safety, saying ''stop the delay'' on
Medicare reform and a patients bill of rights, on a minimum wage
increase, on school construction aid and anti-smoking legislation.
</P>
<P>
   In the Mideast, Clinton said, both Syria and Israel should
''come up with some ideas and start talking'' about the peace
negotiations in which he tried, and failed, to prod Syrian
President Hafez Assad in Geneva on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   He said Assad ''now knows in great detail what the Israeli
proposals were. ... I don't think its enough to say 'I don't like
your position, come back and see me when I like your position.''
</P>
<P>
   On another international subject, Clinton praised new Russian
President Vladimir Putin for taking a positive stand on economic
reform and pledged to work with the new leader ''regardless of
personal chemistry.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton also was asked about police shootings in New York City --
a topic his wife, Hillary, has made an issue against Mayor Rudolph
Giuliani in their campaign for a Senate seat.
</P>
<P>
   He declined to comment on the three shooting cases that have
become an issue there. With police training and policy leadership,
he said, ''we can bring the crime rate down and the tenor of
community relations up.''
</P>
<P>
   ''The two things are not inconsistent,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   On another controversial subject, Clinton said the Miami
relatives of Elian Gonzalez, the 6-year-old Cuban boy enmeshed in
an international custody case, ''should observe the rule of law''
and accept the decision of federal courts should they order the boy
returned to his father in Cuba.
</P>

   Miami-Dade County Mayor Alex Penelas said earlier that he would
not offer any police help to deal with the situation should federal
officials try to remove the child from the home of his great uncle,
where he has lived since his mother died in an attempt to flee Cuba
by boat.
</P>
<P>
   ''I would just hope that the law would be followed by
everyone,'' Clinton said, whether the courts uphold or reverse the
Immigration and Naturalization Service order that the boy be
returned to Cuba.
</P>
<P>
   On still another subject, the taxation of Internet sales by the
states, Clinton said he favored the current moratorium on taxes,
and added that he thinks a consensus on what to do about the whole
matter will begin taking shape in the next year.
</P>
<P>
   On gun control, he said National Rifle Association attacks on
him are ''part of the president's job description, being attacked
by people who disagree with him.''
</P>
<P>
   ''I still think Charlton Heston's a great actor and I enjoy
watching his movies,'' Clinton said of the NRA president who has
been criticizing his gun control stands in television ads.
</P>
<P>
   On the ruling of a federal judge that Clinton committed ''a
criminal violation of the privacy act'' by releasing letters to
cast doubt on the credibility of a woman who accused him of a
sexual advance, he said he obviously did not agree.
</P>
<P>
   He said that the letters from Kathleen Willey were released
''reluctantly'' after her charges in 1998 because it was ''the only
way I knew to refute allegations against me that were untrue.''

<HEADLINE> Bush: Abortion No Litmus for V.P.  </HEADLINE>
By GLEN JOHNSON, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEWARK, N.J. (AP) -- George W. Bush, reaching out to women and
political moderates, kept up his focus on education Wednesday and
suggested that support for abortion rights wouldn't necessarily
disqualify any potential running mate.
</P>
<P>
   Bush, the expected Republican presidential nominee, toured a
charter school that he said showed how his proposal for
alternatives to failing schools could work. New Jersey Gov.
Christie Whitman, mentioned by some as a possible vice presidential
choice, accompanied him.
</P>
<P>
   While saying he had not made any running mate lists, Bush spoke
warmly of Whitman when reporters asked about her chances, even
though he opposes abortion and she favors abortion rights.
</P>
<P>
   ''Good people can disagree on the issue, and I understand that
and I'm standing here with a friend of mine,'' Bush said after he
and Whitman toured the North Star Academy, an inner-city charter
school with a 700-child waiting list.
</P>
<P>
   ''We disagree on some aspects of the issue,'' Bush added. ''That
doesn't mean we can't be pulling for the same thing, being on the
same team, and I respect Governor Whitman's views and I respect her
as a person.''
</P>
<P>
   The Texas governor's comments on abortion and his focus this
week on education were part of his move back toward the political
center after a bitter Republican primary campaign in which some
analysts believe he moved too far right.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday, Bush rolled out a $5 billion reading initiative. On
Thursday in Wisconsin, Bush plans to promote teacher recruiting and
retraining.
</P>
<P>
   Bush started his day Wednesday by having breakfast with
Archbishop Theodore McCarrick, the Roman Catholic head in Newark.
During the primary campaign, Bush was criticized for speaking at
Bob Jones University, a South Carolina school whose leaders have
embraced anti-Catholic views.
</P>
<P>
   In the last two elections, the GOP has been plagued by a gender
gap, the trend for men to support Republicans and women to support
Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   In recent polls, Vice President Al Gore, the likely Democratic
nominee, is running only several percentage points ahead of Bush
among women, however, while the Texas governor is out polling Gore
among men by about one dozen percentage points.
</P>
<P>
   Steve Salmore, a Republican political analyst from New Jersey,
said Whitman would be an unlikely choice for Bush because her
pro-abortion views could inflame internal conflict.
</P>
<P>
   ''She has become a symbol for many people of the pro-choice
Republicans. I think it would make that issue a major issue of
division at the convention, and I don't think George Bush needs
that,'' Salmore said.
</P>
<P>
   Chuck Donovan, who replaced former GOP presidential candidate
Gary Bauer as head of the Family Research Council, said in a
statement ''it is common practice for guests to compliment their
hosts.''
</P>
<P>
   But Donovan also delivered an implicit warning to Bush, saying
that when presidential candidates pick running mates they ''send a
strong signal to the American people about whether they are serious
about defending the most defenseless members of the human family,
our unborn children.''
</P>
<P>
   Abortion-rights supporters were quick to pounce on Bush.
</P>
<P>
   Kate Michelman, president of the National Abortion and
Reproductive Rights Action League, said Bush is ''madly to try to
reposition himself from being out on the right-wing,'' but it won't
work.
</P>
<P>
   ''Christie Todd Whitman is not going to change the reality that
George W. Bush is a threat to women's constitutional and legal
right to reproductive choice -- no matter what he says,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Whitman, campaigning with Bush on Tuesday and Wednesday in New
Jersey, twice introduced him by saying his compassionate
conservative philosophy ''transcends litmus tests.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush, calling Whitman a friend, said, ''I can't wait to campaign
with her, not only in the state of New Jersey but all around
America.''
</P>
<P>
   The two served as co-chairmen of the 1996 Republican National
Convention.
</P>
<P>
   Touring the North Star Academy, Bush watched math students doing
academic calisthenics, racing through addition tables and answering
questions such as what is a quadrangle.
</P>
<P>
   ''This charter school shows that all children can learn, and I
resent those who stand in the way of education reform, those who
say that giving parents different options if they're dissatisfied
with the status quo isn't right,'' Bush told students clad in polo
shirts and khakis.
</P>
<P>
   Whitman signed legislation in 1996 paving the way for North
Star, the first charter school in the state.
</P>
<P>
   Both Bush and Gore back charter schools, created by a group of
teachers, community members or parents. They operate free of most
state laws and regulations but must be approved by a local
chartering authority after outlining educational goals, procedures
and standards.
</P>
<P>
   Later Wednesday, Bush held a private reception with New York
Gov. George Pataki, then spoke at a $500,000 fund-raiser in New
York that also was attended by Mayor Rudolph Giuliani.

<HEADLINE> Nasdaq Down 147.55; Dow Up 68.65  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Technology stocks fell sharply today as
investors once again took profits from their recent rally.
Blue-chip computer makers and high-flying Internet companies were
lower, weighing on major market indexes.
</P>
<P>
   With an hour remaining in Wall Street's regular session, the
technology-dominated Nasdaq composite index was down 147.55 at
4,686.34. Decliners outnumbered advancers by a 5-to-2 margin.
</P>
<P>
   Other stock indicators had turned positive after midday
declines. The Dow Jones industrial average was up 68.65 at
11,004.76 and the Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 index was up 1.27 at
1,509.00.
</P>
<P>
   Since the Nasdaq composite index hit its last record March 10,
investors have begun selling technology stocks to garner profits
from their big run. Selling gathered momentum on Tuesday, when Abby
Joseph Cohen, Goldman Sachs's chief investment strategist, said
many technology stocks are now fully valued and have little room
for further gains.
</P>
<P>
   Applied Materials fell 4 9/16 to 97{, Sun Microsystems lost 2
63/64 to 97 41/64 and Yahoo! fell 9 11/64 to 185 53/64. Dow
component Hewlett-Packard fell 5 5/16 to 135 9/16.
</P>
<P>
   Also, Redback Networks was off 19 13/16 at 269} and eBay fell 17
31/64 to 206 21/64.
</P>
<P>
   ''There's some carryover concern that a lot of these stocks are
overvalued,'' said Barry Berman, managing director of equity
trading for Robert W. Baird &AMP; Co. in Milwaukee. ''So there's money
coming out of stocks that are highly priced relative to earnings
and into some groups that had been ignored for a long time.''
</P>
<P>
   Some of those sectors, analysts said, are pharmaceuticals and
retailers. Today, Merck rose 3 5/16 to 64} and WalMart gained 2
13/16 to 57 5/16, keeping the Dow in positive territory.
</P>
<P>
   Also, oil stocks rose after OPEC oil ministers agreed on
production increases to boost the world's crude oil supplies.
Analysts forecast improved profit margins for oil companies,
helping the sector gain ground even as prices of crude oil tumbled
on world markets. Exxon Mobil was up 2 9/16 to 81 9/16.
</P>
<P>
   A flurry of new deals by AT&AMP;T dominated activity in the
telecommunications sector.
</P>
<P>
   AT&AMP;T fell 13/16 to 58| in active trading. After the close of
Tuesday's regular session, the company revealed details of its
long-awaited tracking stock for the fast-growing wireless business.
AT&AMP;T wants to sell between 360 million and 414 million shares in
the new AT&AMP;T Wireless Group for between $26 and $32 per share. The
offering, expected in late April or early May, could raise as much
as $13.25 billion and would be the biggest initial public offering
in U.S. history.
</P>
<P>
   AT&AMP;T helped buoy shares of Excite At Home, which rose 3 to 37
5/16. The company, a provider of cable Internet access, extended
distribution arrangements with AT&AMP;T through 2008. Also, AT&AMP;T
offered to buy out two of its partners in its relationship with
Excite At Home, giving Comcast and Cox Communications the right to
sell their Excite At Home shares to AT&AMP;T for a minimum price of 48
per share.
</P>
<P>
   A year ago today, the Dow closed above the 10,000-point
threshold for the first time. Since then, the blue-chip index has
risen as much as 13 percent above the mark and has dipped back
below it several times. Currently, the Dow is about 9 percent above
10,000.
</P>
<P>
   Advancing issues outnumbered decliners by a 10-to-9 margin on
the New York Stock Exchange, where volume came to 824.89 million
shares, slightly ahead of Tuesday's pace.
</P>
<P>
   The Russell 2000 index of smaller companies fell 14.59 to
544.45.

<HEADLINE> German Cabinet Rounds Up Euro Value  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   BERLIN (AP) -- Taking a pre-emptive step against bookkeeping
headaches, Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder's Cabinet approved a law
Wednesday rounding up the value of the mark to the euro for tax
purposes.
</P>
<P>
   According to rates set when the euro took effect Jan. 1, 1999, 1
euro is worth 1.95583 marks.
</P>
<P>
   While euro coins and bank notes will not be in consumers'
pockets until 2002, the currency can be bought and sold
electronically around the world. It also can be used for credit
card or traveler check purchases.
</P>
<P>
   To ease the awkwardness of calculations, the Cabinet said the
rounding up will take effect when the euro currency goes into use
in 2002, making 2 marks equal 1 euro.
</P>
<P>
   The move will cost the government an estimated 700 million marks
($350 million) in tax revenue -- most of that coming from savings to
individuals on their income taxes of about 400 million marks ($200
million).
</P>
<P>
   The rounding-up for taxes is just a precursor to other potential
financial losses faced by business if they decide to round off
their prices to euros when the currency comes into use.

<HEADLINE> Court Limits Nude Dancing Rights  </HEADLINE>
By LAURIE ASSEO, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Supreme Court made it easier for local
governments to ban nude dancing, the entertainment in about 3,000
adult clubs nationwide, ruling Wednesday that a performer's freedom
of expression can be restricted by forcing her to wear pasties and
a G-string.
</P>
<P>
   Nude dancing can be banned in an effort to combat crime and
other harms that adult entertainment clubs often attract, the
justices said in a splintered decision reinstating a public-nudity
ordinance in Erie, Pa.
</P>
<P>
   Such dancing is ''expressive conduct'' but it falls ''only
within the outer ambit'' of the Constitution's First Amendment
free-speech protection, Justice Sandra Day O'Connor wrote in the
court's main opinion.
</P>
<P>
   The ban promotes Erie's ''interest in combating the negative
secondary effects associated with adult entertainment
establishments,'' such as crime, and was not aimed at a dancer's
erotic message, O'Connor said.
</P>
<P>
   Although the court's rationale was divided, the decision is sure
to have broad impact. Nude entertainment is featured in about 3,000
adult clubs nationwide, the justices were told when the case was
argued in November.
</P>
<P>
   ''We're delighted,'' said Valerie Sprenkle, Erie's assistant
city solicitor. ''We didn't ban any expression.... What's being
regulated is the means of expression.''
</P>
<P>
   Sprenkle said dancers at a nude dancing club in the city ''will
be required to cover up to the extent required by the ordinance.''
</P>
<P>
   The ruling bolsters the effect of a 1991 Supreme Court ruling
that let Indiana ban all barroom-style nude dancing under a state
law generally prohibiting public nudity.
</P>
<P>
   That decision was badly splintered, however, and when the
Pennsylvania Supreme Court struck down Erie's ordinance, it said
the 1991 ruling offered little guidance.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday's ruling was divided too. The court voted 7-2 to allow
bans on nude dancing but voted 6-3 to reinstate the Erie ordinance.
</P>
<P>
   O'Connor said that even if the ordinance ''has some minimal
effect on the erotic message by muting that portion of the
expression that occurs when the last stitch is dropped, the dancers
... are free to perform wearing pasties and G-strings.''
</P>
<P>
   She compared the nude-dancing ban to a prohibition on burning
draft cards, which the Supreme Court upheld in 1968. In that case,
the government ''sought to prevent the means of the expression and
not the expression of antiwar sentiment itself,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Most of O'Connor's opinion was joined by Chief Justice William
H. Rehnquist and Justices Anthony M. Kennedy and Stephen G. Breyer.
</P>
<P>
   Justices Antonin Scalia and Clarence Thomas, in a separate
opinion by Scalia, voted to go further. They cited ''the
traditional power of government to foster good morals.''
</P>
<P>
   Justice David H. Souter wrote separately that he agreed with
O'Connor's rationale, but that the city needed to provide more
evidence that its ordinance was designed to deal with ''real
harms.''
</P>
<P>
   Justices John Paul Stevens and Ruth Bader Ginsburg dissented.
Stevens wrote for the two that the court had decided for the first
time that an effort to combat secondary effects such as crime ''may
justify the total suppression of protected speech.''
</P>
<P>
   While Souter was among the 7-2 majority in supporting a ban on
nude dancing, he voted with the minority, along with Stevens and
Ginsburg, against the 6-3 decision to reinstate Erie's specific
ordinance.
</P>
<P>
   The ordinance was ''aimed directly at the dancers in
establishments such as Kandyland'' and should be held ''patently
invalid,'' Stevens said.
</P>
<P>
   Erie's 1994 ordinance was challenged by Nick Panos, who used to
own the Kandyland nude-dancing club. He later sold the club to a
new owner, Joseph Cunningham, who closed it and opened a similar
club, Kandy's Dinner Theater, at a new location with a sign out
front that proclaims: ''First Amendment Rights Headquarters.''

<HEADLINE> German Parents Get Parental Leave  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   BERLIN (AP) -- Maybe British Prime Minister Tony Blair should
have had his fourth child in Germany.
</P>
<P>
   Under a law approved by Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder's Cabinet
on Wednesday, both parents can take up to three years off when they
have a child. With the agreement of their employer, they can take
another year off when their child is between 3 and 8 years old.
</P>
<P>
   Previously, only one parent at a time could take the leave. Only
1.5 percent of those taking the parental leave in the past have
been men.
</P>
<P>
   The imminent arrival of Blair's new child has spurred debate in
Britain over whether he should take some time off after his wife
gives birth, and Blair himself has said he hasn't made a decision
yet.
</P>
<P>
   Under new European Union-wide regulations, parents are entitled
to a minimum 13 weeks of unpaid time off during the first five
years of a child's life. However, the rules don't apply to elected
officials such as Blair.
</P>
<P>
   Taking the time off wouldn't mean no work at all, according to
the new German law. In order to keep the family going, the Cabinet
also raised the amount of part-time work parents can do while on
family leave from 19 to 30 hours a week, for a total of 60 hours
per week between both parents.
</P>
<P>
   The state also raised the amount of money it pays while parents
take off work, to up to $450 a month. That is per child for as long
as at least one of the parents is not working.

<HEADLINE> Some independent scientists criticize EPA's research on upperHudson River  </HEADLINE>
By L. ANNE NEWELL, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   SARATOGA SPRINGS, N.Y. (AP) -- Two independent researchers
sharply criticized parts of federal studies that could lead to a
multi-billion dollar cleanup of the upper Hudson River from a
substance linked to cancer.
</P>
<P>
   However, the panel of seven scientists, including the critics,
generally supported the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency's
work.
</P>
<P>
   Rich Schiafo of the environmental group Scenic Hudson was
pleased with the panel's findings. ''I think this is a favorable
review for the EPA,'' he said, adding that his biggest hope is that
the process moves forward.
</P>
<P>
   The criticism bolsters General Electric Co.'s opposition to the
EPA's research. GE hopes to avoid paying for a large-scale dredging
of the river, saying the river is improving naturally.
</P>
<P>
   The company would have to help pay for any cleanup of PCBs,
which GE legally used for 30 years in plants in Fort Edward and
Hudson Falls before the chemical was banned in 1977 by the federal
government. Polychlorinated biphenyls used in electrical equipment
have been linked to cancer in laboratory animals, but the effect on
humans is less clear.
</P>
<P>
   Grace Luk -- a civil engineering professor from Ryerson
Polytechnic University in Ontario -- said the EPA's research on the
buildup of PCBs in fish ''is in general of poor quality.''
</P>
<P>
   The panelists' reviews are intended to ensure the EPA uses
accurate research to make a final decision -- scheduled for June
2001 -- on the Hudson cleanup.
</P>
<P>
   Five panel members found the research on levels and locations of
PCBs in the water was acceptable with minor revisions, while one
said it needed major revisions. Five said the second area of
research, on PCB buildup in fish, was acceptable with minor
revisions, while one said it needed major changes.
</P>
<P>
   While suggesting only minor changes to the entire report, Per
Larssen, of Sweden's Lund University, stressed the EPA needs to
look at the river as a whole.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think that the models capture the big picture of PCB fate in
the upper Hudson River,'' he wrote. ''The upper parts are not
isolated from the rest of the river, and this needs to be
considered in the 'big picture.'''
</P>
<P>
   The panel's findings are the latest step over how to best clean
the river. The EPA in May released its computer model results,
which predict that PCB levels in fish will still be unacceptable in
two to three decades if no dredging is done. The announcement came
a week after GE released its computer model showing the river is
cleansing itself.
</P>
<P>
   The EPA will now review the research and make any necessary
changes, spokeswoman Ann Rychlenski said.
</P>
<P>
   GE spokesman Mark Behan, said the company was disappointed the
EPA would not guarantee the panel's recommendations would be
included in the new report.

<HEADLINE> Portugal Banks Call Off Merger Plans  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   LISBON, Portugal (AP) -- Two leading banks called off a planned
merger that would have created Portugal's largest private financial
group.
</P>
<P>
   Banco Espirito Santo and Banco Portugues do Investimento said in
a statement late Tuesday they had reached the decision ''by mutual
accord'' and cited lack of conditions for success.
</P>
<P>
   The collapse of the deal announced in January could leave Banco
Espirito Santo and Banco Portugues do Investimento vulnerable as
takeover targets.
</P>
<P>
   Both have foreign shareholders. Credit Agricole has a 6.2
percent stake in Banco Espirito Santo, while Spain's La Caixa,
Brazil's Itau and Germany's Allianz together hold 34 percent of the
Banco Portugues do Investimento Group.
</P>
<P>
   Had the merger gone through, Portuguese banking assets would
have been concentrated in the hands of three major groups, compared
with six a year ago.
</P>
<P>
   The two other big financial groups are state-owned Caixa Geral
de Depositos and Banco Comercial Portugues/Banco Mello.
</P>
<P>
   The trend toward consolidation is aimed at generating enough
financial muscle to expand abroad and protect against hostile
takeovers.
</P>
<P>
   There had been speculation the deal was on the rocks after
executives from the two banks were seen bickering in recent weeks
over the structure of the merged entity which would have had
combined assets of about $38.3 billion.

<HEADLINE> Denmark Neo-Nazi Leader Sentenced  </HEADLINE>
By JAN M. OLSEN, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   ROSKILDE, Denmark -- The leader of Denmark's largest neo-Nazi
group was sentenced to a year in prison Wednesday for attempting to
run down a group of activists outside his organization's
headquarters last year.
</P>
<P>
   Jonni Hansen and his supporters left court in this city 25 miles
west of Copenhagen under heavy police protection as while dozens of
demonstrators shouted ''Down with the Nazis!''
</P>
<P>
   Hansen said he would appeal the sentence, which included a
two-year suspension of his driver's license.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm stunned ... it's way out, it sucks.'' he said about the
sentence.
</P>
<P>
   During the four-week trial, the 34-year-old head of Denmark's
National Socialist Movement admitted he drove a car into a group of
activists who were trying to knock down a 13-foot wooden fence that
surrounds the group's bungalow in suburban Copenhagen. Three were
injured with serious head and leg injuries in the pre-dawn episode
on Dec. 21.
</P>
<P>
   The activists -- members of trade unions that for years have
opposed the Danish neo-Nazis -- used a chain-saw and tossed several
flares over the fence.
</P>
<P>
   The trial attracted dozens of anti-Nazi activists who
demonstrated outside the courthouse and could often be heard
blowing whistles and booing during the trial.
</P>
<P>
   Inside the courtroom, five neo-Nazis -- some in white shirts
wearing red arm bands emblazoned with swastikas -- quietly listened
as the judge, Niels Foldberg, announced the verdict. Afterward,
police escorted the group and Hansen out of town in separate vans.
</P>
<P>
   Hansen's lawyer Peter Hjoerne said his client acted in
self-defense ''because he saw hostile hooded men armed with bats
and chain-saws outside his house,'' throwing flares. The house was
not set on fire.
</P>
<P>
   Hansen was released under a Danish rule that waives prison terms
for those sentenced to less than 18 months who have already served
more than two months in jail awaiting trial. Hansen was jailed for
more than three months before his trial.

<HEADLINE> McDonald's Corp. Plans Expansion  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   OAK BROOK, Ill. (AP) -- McDonald's Corp., is planning to increase
the number of its non-hamburger restaurants this year, a
spokeswoman for the world's largest fast-food chain said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   McDonald's will open 160 to 180 new restaurants under its
Chipotle Mexican Grill, Donatos Pizza and London-based Aroma Cafe
brands, said spokeswoman Anna Rozenich.
</P>
<P>
   There are 37 Chipotle, 147 Donatos and 30 Aromas currently
operating. Rozenich could not say how many restaurants will be
added to each chain.
</P>
<P>
   McDonald's also plans to add between 1,800 to 1,900 hamburger
restaurants this year, with 90 percent of the expansion taking
place outside the United States, Rozenich said. The Oak Brook-based
chain added 1,790 restaurants last year, bring its total to 26,800.
</P>
<P>
   The restaurant giant, which had sales of $38.5 billion last
year, has received stiff competition from other fast-food chains
like Wendy's and Burger King. McDonald's acquired the Chipotle
chain in 1998 and the Donatos and Aroma Cafe chains last year to
ensure continued growth of the company.
</P>
<P>
   Also last year, McDonald's agreed to purchase 751 Boston Market
restaurants and the franchise rights for an additional 108
restaurants from bankrupt Boston Chicken Inc. The purchase is
expected to close this summer.
</P>
<P>
   Some Boston Market restaurants will be closed or turned into
McDonald's, Chipotle or Donatos Pizza outlets, according to
Rozenich.

<HEADLINE> Gerains, Soybeans Move Higher  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHICAGO (AP) -- Grain and soybean futures prices moved higher in
trading Wednesday on the Chicago Board of Trade.
</P>
<P>
   Corn futures prices led the market higher in a technical bounce
following Tuesday's sharp decline, which was precipitated by a
bearish National Weather Service forecast of normal- or
above-normal rains in coming days.
</P>
<P>
   However, there were differing forecasts circulating in the
market Wednesday, some calling for continued dryness in the
Midwest, prompting some hedging, according to analyst Dale
Gustafson of Salomon Smith Barney.
</P>
<P>
   Belief the recent decline in corn prices could spur demand from
cattle and hog producers also was a boost to the market.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to getting a boost from corn's rally, wheat futures
were helped by Egypt's tender for 150,000 metric tons of wheat. The
U.S. Agriculture Department also announced a foreign buyer has made
a tender for 125,000 metric tons of wheat.
</P>
<P>
   Soybean futures prices were lifted by heavy commodity fund
buying of soyoil futures.
</P>
<P>
   Wheat for May delivery was 1\ cents higher at $2.51 a bushel;
May corn was 1 cent higher at $2.26 a bushel; May oats were
unchanged at $1.18{ a bushel; May soybeans were 1 cent higher at
$5.27{ a bushel.
</P>
<P>
   Cattle and pork futures prices were mixed in trading on the
Chicago Mercantile Exchange.
</P>
<P>
   Pork belly futures, after reaching a contract high in early
trading, fell into negative territory briefly due to profit-taking
before settling higher.
</P>
<P>
   Cattle futures prices were pushed lower by falling cash prices
paid at feedlots.
</P>
<P>
   April live cattle were 1.45 cents lower at 71.72 cents a pound;
April feeder cattle were .87 cent lower at 83.70 cents a pound;
April hogs were .10 cent higher at 63.05 cents a pound; May pork
bellies were .85 cent higher at 85.70 cents a pound.

<HEADLINE> EU To Widen Echelon Spy Probe  </HEADLINE>
By CONSTANT BRAND, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) -- Many Europeans fear Big Brother has
been watching them for decades. Now, they are starting to find out
whether a vast U.S.-led espionage network has been snooping into
their lives.
</P>
<P>
   The European Parliament opens a probe Thursday into allegations
of economic espionage by the U.S.-led Echelon network, accused of
snooping on European business communications in a controversial
report last month.
</P>
<P>
   The report sent shivers up the spines of many Europeans,
especially in Brussels, where key economic and political decisions
are made at European Union headquarters.
</P>
<P>
   It painted the picture of an elaborate spy network, masterminded
in Washington, eavesdropping on phone calls, faxes and e-mails in
the pursuit of commercial gain.
</P>
<P>
   Echelon, a vast global network of electronic monitoring
stations, was created in the 1970s as part of an
intelligence-gathering agreement between the United States,
Britain, Canada, Australia and New Zealand to monitor the
activities of the Soviet Union and its Warsaw Pact allies.
</P>
<P>
   After the demise of the Soviet threat, Echelon's extensive
surveillance operation did not evaporate but actually increased its
monitoring capabilities worldwide, the report said.
</P>
<P>
   It said new threats to national security like terrorism and
organized crime continued to drive the thirst for information. But
political, commercial and diplomatic intelligence were also
intercepted, frequently via new communication technologies like the
Internet and mobile phones.
</P>
<P>
   ''We have to ask ourselves what the security threats are,'' said
Robert Evans, vice chairman of the European Parliament's Committee
on Citizen's Freedoms and Rights. ''We are not in an era of massive
secrecy any more,'' since the Cold War is over.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. National Security Agency, which is believed to head
Echelon, said last month in a letter to the U.S. Congress that it
could ''neither confirm nor deny the existence of specific
operations.''
</P>
<P>
   ''However we can tell you that NSA operates in strict accordance
with U.S. laws and regulations,'' it said.
</P>
<P>
   In an interview with the French daily Le Figaro on Tuesday,
former CIA director James Woolsey admitted the United States
secretly collects information on European companies, but denied
giving it to their U.S. competitors.
</P>
<P>
   Woolsey said the operations were limited to companies that
violate United Nations sanctions or use bribery or other unethical
practices to gain more business.
</P>
<P>
   However, even in the United States, some are not convinced.
''More needs to be done to establish the scope and impact of
unlawful monitoring,'' said Marc Rotenberg of the Electronic
Privacy Information Center in Washington, D.C.
</P>
<P>
   Yaman Akdeniz of the British Cyber-Rights and Cyber-Liberties
group likened the Echelon spy network to ''something out of George
Orwell's '1984.'''
</P>
<P>
   ''This is happening in our democratic societies. The genie is
now out of the bottle,'' he said, warning that ''we cannot rely on
governments anymore for protection.''
</P>
<P>
   ''If you want to do business you must take security seriously,''
especially in the high-tech communications sector, Akdeniz said.
</P>
<P>
   Heidi Hautala, a leader of the Green Party, which has
spearheaded the investigation, urged European businesses to
''rapidly develop their own technology and encryption systems to
defend themselves against the attacks which are conducted in the
name of the universal security interests of the United States.''
</P>
<P>
   ''The big challenge is to get governments to talk on this ... it
is all veiled in secrecy,'' Hautala said.

<HEADLINE> AM-NY--Nuclear Sale, Bjt,0775  </HEADLINE>
By ANNY KUO, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) -- As sale of two state-owned nuclear power
plants come closer to completion, another debate is just beginning
-- how to spend the $967 million the New York Power Authority will
eventually receive for the transaction.
</P>
<P>
   NYPA agreed Tuesday to sell its Indian Point 3 nuclear plant in
Westchester County and the James A. FitzPatrick nuclear facility in
Oswego County to New Orleans-based Entergy Corp. If approved by the
federal Nuclear Regulatory Commission, the sale would be the
largest privatization of state assets in New York history.
</P>
<P>
   NYPA plans to use part of the proceeds from the sale to pay off
debts of the Indian Point 3 plant, but beyond that, nothing is
certain at this point, authority spokesman Mike Petralia said.
</P>
<P>
   Some ideas NYPA may consider include electric rate reduction,
economic development, infrastructure maintenance and research and
development, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's premature to tell what exactly are suggestions we're
coming up with. We expect and welcome input from the Legislature
and the governor,'' Petralia said.
</P>
<P>
   The purchase price for the 980-megawatt Indian Point 3 plant and
the 825-megawatt FitzPatrick plant includes the value of nuclear
fuel at the two plants. The 1,700 staffers at the authority's
nuclear division will also start working for Entergy.
</P>
<P>
   Petralia said Entergy will make an initial payment of $50
million at closing of the transaction, followed by seven years in
equal installments of $108.1 million for the plants and the fuel.
These payments would begin one year after closing.
</P>
<P>
   When the seven-year payments are complete, Entergy will then
make eight annual cash payments of $20 million toward the plants'
decommissioning expenses and other costs.
</P>
<P>
   Most state legislators seemed to agree that part of the proceeds
should go toward debt reduction for Indian Point 3, but opinions
varied on how the remainder should be spent.
</P>
<P>
   Petralia said although NYPA has the most say on how to spend the
money, its decision could still be overidden legislatively -- a
route that some lawmakers said they may take.
</P>
<P>
   The nuclear plant sale provides a ''golden opportunity'' to put
together a ''blueprint to help people in energy conservation and
rate reduction in the time of an energy crisis,'' said Assemblyman
Paul Tonko, chairman of the Assembly energy committee.
</P>
<P>
   Tonko, an Amsterdam Democrat, said proposed Assembly legislation
called Energy 2000 would require that the money be spent on energy
conservation, pollution reduction and innovative rate reduction
initiatives. For instance, he said sale proceeds could be used to
help businesses and farms retrofit facilities to ultimately
decrease their energy consumption.
</P>
<P>
   Assemblyman Richard Brodsky, chairman of the Assembly
environmental conservation committee, said he is concerned that if
the power authority shifts proceeds for debt reduction or
maintenance of its facilities upstate, it could end up being
''regionally discriminatory.''
</P>
<P>
   ''They have been unable to recognize energy needs of downstate
New York ... communities that bore the burden of Indian Point 3,''
the Westchester County Democrat said.
</P>
<P>
   Brodsky wants the power authority to spend the money on energy
conservation projects, environmental cleanup and funding community
and public oversight of the plants.
</P>
<P>
   Michael McKeon, a spokesman for Gov. George Pataki, said there
are still ''twists and turns'' before the money starts coming in.
He added that ultimately the proceeds should go toward ''lowering
energy rates and creating economic opportunities.''
</P>
<P>
   While NYPA and lawmakers ponder about what to do with the money
that would come in when the deal is complete, the sale is already
greeted with enthusiasm by local officials.
</P>
<P>
   Privatizing the nuclear plants would mean the facilities are no
longer tax-exempt. The sale contract does not include any provision
for special tax status for Entergy, NYPA's Petralia said.
</P>
<P>
   Entergy Carl Crawford said the utility will meet with local
taxing jurisdictions once the sale is finalized and discuss tax
payments.
</P>
<P>
   ''We expect to pay fair taxes,'' Crawford said.
</P>
<P>
   Oswego County Administrator Jack Tierny said it's still too
early to tell how much in taxes the sale of the FitzPatrick plant
will generate for the county, the town of Scriba and the Mexico
Central School District. But nevertheless, the sale is ''all good
news,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ''We were getting zero before. Now we're getting more than
zero,'' Tierny said.

<HEADLINE> Iran, Mexico To Boost Oil Output  </HEADLINE>
By BRUCE STANLEY, AP Business Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   VIENNA, Austria (AP) -- After first refusing to join its OPEC
colleagues in an agreement to increase oil production, Iran
reversed course Wednesday, saying it will pump more to keep other
producers from taking away its market share.
</P>
<P>
   Mexico, one of the leading oil producers not in the Organization
of Petroleum Exporting Countries, also plans to increase output.
</P>
<P>
   Oil prices fell on world markets on the prospect of more crude
flowing into markets, but stocks of oil companies rose on the
prospect that lower crude prices would improve profit margins on
sales of refined products, such as gasoline.
</P>
<P>
   At a White House news conference Wednesday, President Clinton
said the OPEC agreement should reduce both home heating costs and
gasoline prices over the next few weeks, and he urged ''oil
companies to do everything they can to bring savings to consumers
as quickly as possible.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton said lower oil prices would help to sustain economic
growth in the United States and throughout the world.
</P>
<P>
   Iran is OPEC's second-largest producer, after Saudi Arabia. If
Iran increases production on the same scale as its OPEC peers, the
cartel would boost total output by 1.7 million barrels a day -- more
than 7 percent above the ceiling it set for itself last March.
</P>
<P>
   Mexico, which was instrumental in orchestrating the worldwide
production cuts that sent crude oil prices tripling in the past
year, said it would boost its exports by 150,000 barrels a day on
Saturday in a coordinated move with OPEC.
</P>
<P>
   Mexico isn't a member of OPEC, but played a key role in forging
agreements in 1998 and 1999 that reduced global oil supply, leading
to the increase in prices. As part of those agreements, Mexico
reduced its oil exports by 325,000 barrels a day.
</P>
<P>
   John Llewellyn, global chief economist for the Lehman Brothers
securities firm, told reporters in New York Wednesday that in
addition to increased production limits, he also expected cheating
on quotas to ''continue or accelerate.''
</P>
<P>
   He said that he expects an additional supply of about 2 million
barrels a day from OPEC and non-OPEC countries, something he said
''would bring the market back into balance.'' Llewellyn also said
that a price of $20 to $25 per barrel of crude would be consistent
with additional supply ranging between 1.5 million and 2 million
barrels a day.
</P>
<P>
   In trading Wednesday on the New York Mercantile Exchange, the
main blend of U.S. crude fell 64 cents to close at $26.45 a barrel
in contracts for May delivery. On the International Petroleum
Exchange in London, the contract for May delivery of Brent crude
oil was down $1.11 a barrel to close at $24.40.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. oil prices had tripled to a March 8 peak of $34.37 per
barrel following OPEC's decision last March to slash production.
Since that intraday trading high, oil has retreated 23 percent.
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton administration had been lobbying for an increase of
2 million to 2.5 million barrels a day in order to trim gasoline
prices, which have soared in the United States from less than $1 a
gallon just over a year ago to an average of almost $1.60 today.
</P>
<P>
   Llewellyn said OPEC nations, especially Saudi Arabia, are eager
to keep prices from rising to such heights that consumers are
encouraged to step up conservation, bolster the search for
alternative energy sources or increase output from marginal
producers. That in the long run reduces the demand for OPEC oil,
now one-third of global supply.
</P>
<P>
   Some analysts suggested that the production increases announced
by OPEC were modest, and won't have a significant effect on gas
prices.
</P>
<P>
   Iran had refused to join in OPEC's latest production increase as
a protest against U.S. diplomatic pressure on the group. In fact,
Iranians' commercial concerns won out over their political
posturing.
</P>
<P>
   ''I will not give up my market share for anyone,'' Iran's
representative to OPEC, Hossein Kazempour Ardebili, told reporters
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   His announcement came several hours after a majority of OPEC
members agreed to boost crude oil output by 6.3 percent, a figure
that analysts said would offer scant relief for motorists staggered
by skyrocketing prices at the pump.
</P>
<P>
   Ardebili refused to say how much more oil Iran would contribute
to global supplies but said his country would start pumping
additional barrels as early as Saturday, after OPEC's current
production cuts expire.
</P>
<P>
   ''The world is very short of oil,'' said John Toalster, an
analyst in London with SG Securities. ''Anything which is available
from Iran will be gratefully received.''
</P>
<P>
   Refineries need to rebuild depleted gasoline inventories.
Together with stronger seasonal demand for oil during the summer
and fall, this means that crude prices should firm up later in the
year, Toalster said, regardless of the new barrels Iran and the
rest of OPEC plan to add to the market.
</P>
<P>
   He predicted that U.S. crude prices could reach $29.50 per
barrel by the end of the year.

<HEADLINE> Insurers Faulted on Kids' Surgeries  </HEADLINE>
By MATT KELLEY, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Sen. John McCain denounced insurance companies
Wednesday for refusing to pay for surgeries to correct some
children's facial deformities, such as his daughter's cleft lip and
palate.
</P>
<P>
   The Arizona Republican joined surgeons' groups and actor Stacy
Keach at a news conference to rally support for McCain's bill to
stop insurers from refusing to pay for procedures labeled
''cosmetic.'' Keach was born with a cleft lip, which was corrected
surgically.
</P>
<P>
   McCain and his wife, Cindy, have spent about $40,000 of their
own money on surgeries for 8-year-old Bridget McCain, whom they
adopted from Bangladesh.
</P>
<P>
   ''It is disgraceful that many insurance companies claim that
medical services to restore to children some semblance of a normal
appearance are merely cosmetic,'' McCain said.
</P>
<P>
   Health insurers oppose the McCain proposal, as they have opposed
other requirements for coverage of certain treatments or
conditions.
</P>
<P>
   ''The issue is whether people should be mandated to pay higher
premiums to cover the costs of cosmetic surgery,'' said Richard
Coorsh, spokesman for the Health Insurance Association of America.
''We think it makes more sense for people to choose the kind of
coverage that they wish rather than having additional costs foisted
upon them by a mandate.''
</P>
<P>
   McCain and Sen. Olympia Snowe, R-Maine, introduced the child
deformity bill last year, and it awaits a committee hearing.
</P>
<P>
   The measure would require health plans to cover reconstructive
surgeries for children that improve the function of abnormal body
structures or give them a more normal appearance.
</P>
<P>
   A similar bill sponsored by Reps. Sue Kelly, R-N.Y., and Greg
Ganske, R-Iowa, is pending in the House.

<HEADLINE> Basdaq Off 189.22; Dow Ends Up 82.61  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Technology stocks tumbled for a third
consecutive session today, dragging the Nasdaq composite lower and
providing the only blemish on a broad-based advance by the Dow
Jones industrials.
</P>
<P>
   According to preliminary calculations, the technology-dominated
Nasdaq composite index fell 189.22 to close at 4,644.67. Five
stocks fell for every two that rose.
</P>
<P>
   The Dow Jones industrial average rose 82.61 to close at
11,018.72.
</P>
<P>
   Broader stock indicators were mixed.
</P>
<P>
   Technology stocks fell as investors once again took profits from
their rally early this year. Since the Nasdaq composite index hit
its last record high close on March 10, the index has fallen about
8 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Today, investors continued a wave of selling that gained
momentum on Tuesday, when Abby Joseph Cohen, Goldman Sachs's chief
investment strategist, said many technology stocks are now fully
valued and have little room for further gains.
</P>
<P>
   Applied Materials, Sun Microsystems and Yahoo! fell. Dow
components IBM and Hewlett-Packard also closed lower.
</P>
<P>
   The Nasdaq's losses were exacerbated by sharp plunges from
companies like Redback Networks and eBay, which have risen
significantly this year.
</P>
<P>
   ''There's some carryover concern that a lot of these stocks are
overvalued,'' said Barry Berman, managing director of equity
trading for Robert W. Baird &AMP; Co. in Milwaukee. ''So there's money
coming out of stocks that are highly priced relative to earnings
and into some groups that had been ignored for a long time.''
</P>
<P>
   Some of those sectors, analysts said, are pharmaceuticals and
retailers. Today, Merck and WalMart rose, leading the Dow's
advance.
</P>
<P>
   ''With a couple of days left in the quarter, there's some mutual
fund money still looking for a home,'' said Charles G. Crane, chief
market strategist at Key Asset Management in New York. ''There are
some outstanding bargains if you look in the right corners.''
</P>
<P>
   General Electric rose after Prudential Securities analyst
Nicholas Heymann reiterated his ''strong buy'' rating on the stock.
Heymann also raised his 12-month price target to 210 from 185 and
boosted his earnings estimate for this year to $3.75 a share from
$3.73.
</P>
<P>
   Also, oil stocks rose after OPEC oil ministers agreed on
production increases to boost the world's crude oil supplies.
Analysts forecast improved profit margins for oil companies,
helping the sector gain ground even as prices of crude oil tumbled
on world markets.
</P>
<P>
   A flurry of new deals by AT&AMP;T dominated activity in the
telecommunications sector.
</P>
<P>
   AT&AMP;T fell in active trading a day after the company revealed
details of its long-awaited tracking stock for the fast-growing
wireless business. AT&AMP;T's offering, expected in late April or early
May, could raise as much as $13.25 billion and would be the biggest
initial public offering in U.S. history.
</P>
<P>
   AT&AMP;T helped buoy shares of Excite At Home. The company, a
provider of cable Internet access, extended distribution
arrangements with AT&AMP;T through 2008. Also, AT&AMP;T offered to buy out
two of its partners in its relationship with Excite At Home, giving
Comcast and Cox Communications the right to sell their Excite At
Home shares to AT&AMP;T for a minimum price of 48 per share.
</P>
<P>
   Today marked the first anniversary of the Dow's first close
above 10,000. Since then, the blue-chip index has risen as much as
13 percent above the mark and has dipped back below it several
times. With today's advance, the Dow is about 10.2 percent above
10,000.

<HEADLINE> Algeria Invites Human Rights Groups  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   GENEVA (AP) -- Algeria said Wednesday it will welcome visits from
four human rights groups that have criticized its humanitarian
record, an about-face as the government tries more pragmatic
efforts to resolve a bloody struggle with Islamic militants.
</P>
<P>
   Amnesty International, Human Rights Watch, the International
Federation of Human Rights and Reporters Without Borders have been
told they are welcome for separate visits of up to 11 days in May
and June, according to a statement from the Algerian diplomatic
mission in Geneva.
</P>
<P>
   The multiple invitations would mark a change from the policy
adopted at the start of the Islamic insurgency in 1992, when the
nation shut its doors to human rights groups and most media.
</P>
<P>
   Fighting began when the military-backed government canceled
elections that the Islamic Salvation Front, known by its French
initials FIS, was poised to win. The party was banned and since
then, some 100,000 people have been killed in the violence and
thousands more have disappeared
</P>
<P>
   President Abdelaziz Bouteflika, who personally extended the
invitations, has sought to restore peace with a partial amnesty for
militants who surrendered by Jan. 13. Violence continues, however,
with almost daily reports of deaths of civilians, soldiers and
militants.
</P>
<P>
   In Paris, International Federation of Human Rights president
Patrick Baudouin welcomed the invitation, although he described the
move as ''political.''
</P>
<P>
   ''We've been asking to go to Algeria for two years,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   There was no immediate comment from London-based Amnesty
International, Human Rights Watch of New York, and the Paris-based
reporters' rights group, also based in Paris.

<HEADLINE> Huge Wave Overcomes Destroyer Deck  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO (AP) -- A huge wave swept over the bow of a Navy
destroyer Wednesday, knocking six crewmen around on the deck and
leaving one with two broken legs.
</P>
<P>
   The sailors were airlifted from the USS David R. Ray to Stanford
Medical Center, said Petty Officer Jeff Alger. The other injuries
included a concussion, a dislocated hip and a slight head injury,
Alger said.
</P>
<P>
   The destroyer was about seven miles west of the Golden Gate
Bridge, on its way out to sea after a weekend in San Francisco,
when the wave slammed into it, officials said.
</P>
<P>
   The Coast Guard reported 10- to 14-foot swells in the area at
the time.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's known to get some swells out there,'' Alger said.

<HEADLINE> Barak Reassures Arafat on Peace  </HEADLINE>
By SARI BASHI, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   JERUSALEM (AP) -- With negotiations with Syria stalled, Israeli
Prime Minister Ehud Barak turned to peace talks with the
Palestinians on Wednesday, assuring Yasser Arafat that he is
serious about reaching an agreement.
</P>
<P>
   ''Our eyes are looking ahead to the Palestinian track ... with
the goal of reaching peace between the two peoples,'' Barak's
office quoted him as telling the Palestinian leader by telephone.
</P>
<P>
   Barak updated Arafat on Sunday's Geneva summit between President
Clinton and Syrian President Hafez Assad, Barak's office said in a
statement.
</P>
<P>
   That summit failed to restart Israeli-Syrian peace talks,
stalled since January, and Barak aides said the prime minister will
concentrate his diplomatic efforts on the Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
   Israel and the Palestinians face a May deadline to reach an
outline, or framework agreement, for a final peace deal. The deal
itself, due in September, is to resolve thorny issues like the
future of contested Jerusalem, the fate of Palestinian refugees and
final borders between Israel and a future Palestinian state.
</P>
<P>
   A round of Israeli-Palestinian talks outside Washington ended
this week with neither side reporting any breakthrough. Another
10-day round is to take place next month in the United States, and
on Sunday in Jerusalem the two sides are to hold talks on interim
issues.
</P>
<P>
   Palestinian negotiator Saeb Erekat, returning from the
Washington talks Wednesday, said the large gaps between the sides
require intervention by Barak and Arafat.
</P>
<P>
   ''These issues require political decisions rather than
negotiations,'' Erekat said.
</P>
<P>
   Later Wednesday, Arafat gave a speech commemorating Land Day, a
day of protest to be marked Thursday by Palestinians and Arab
citizens of Israel. The tradition dates back to violent clashes
between police and Israeli Arabs in 1976. That year, Arab residents
held a general strike to protest an Israeli government campaign to
confiscate 20,000 acres of Arab-owned land.
</P>
<P>
   ''We have a legitimate right to be here in Palestine, in our
independent Palestinian state and its capital, holy Jerusalem,''
Arafat said in the speech broadcast on Palestinian TV and radio. He
called for the return of Palestinian refugees to ''build their
future in this good earth.''
</P>
<P>
   The Palestinians claim east Jerusalem, captured by Israel in the
1967 Mideast War, as the capital of a future state.

<HEADLINE> Turkish Coalition Govt. Loses Vote  </HEADLINE>
By SELCAN HACAOGLU, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   ANKARA, Turkey (AP) -- Turkey's coalition government failed to
win passage Wednesday for a constitutional reform to lift the
single-term limit for the presidency and allow President Suleyman
Demirel to seek re-election.
</P>
<P>
   The loss in parliament came as a blow to Prime Minister Bulent
Ecevit, who believes Demirel is a stabilizing factor in Turkey and
wants to avoid political bickering over the president's successor.
</P>
<P>
   Backers of the reform say Demirel has helped preserve a balance
between the staunchly secular military and the main opposition
Islamic Virtue Party, which faces closure for anti-secular
activities.
</P>
<P>
   But the coalition fell short of the 367 votes in the 550-member
chamber needed to change the constitution. The amendment would
reduce the president's term from seven to five years, but allow for
a second five-year term. Demirel's term ends in May.
</P>
<P>
   Only 253 deputies voted in favor, while 236 deputies voted
against. The remainder abstained, cast invalid votes or were
absent.
</P>
<P>
   The coalition has 352 seats in parliament, so the low approval
meant many in the government did not back the amendment.
</P>
<P>
   The amendment is to be debated and voted on a second time next
week.
</P>
<P>
   Hoping to garner opposition support, the government had proposed
two other constitutional amendments. The first offers a lucrative
pension plan to deputies, while the second would make it more
difficult for courts to shut down political parties -- an offer
particularly attractive for the Virtue party, which is battling a
closure case.
</P>
<P>
   The two other amendments also failed to be approved Wednesday
and will be voted on again next week.
</P>
<P>
   Ecevit also wants to prevent likely tensions over Demirel's
successor from straining his coalition government, which is being
hailed as the most stable one Turkey has known in years.
</P>
<P>
   Political turmoil may hamper the government's ambitious
inflation-fighting program which is backed by a $4 billion loan
package with the International Monetary Fund. The annual inflation
rate is hovering around 60 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Turkey's powerful military has kept silent but analysts say they
would prefer extension of Demirel's term. Islamic circles accuse
Demirel of serving as the mouthpiece of the army.

<HEADLINE> Celebrities Push Exotic Animal Bill  </HEADLINE>
By G. STEPHEN BIERMAN, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Owners of large cats, bears, apes and other
exotic large mammals would have be licensed by the federal
government under a bill being promoted by three actresses and a
puppet frog.
</P>
<P>
   ''Not everyone of us up here today is a celebrity or just
another one of those talking frogs on Capitol Hill,'' Kermit the
Frog said at a news conference Wednesday to promote the bill by
Rep. Tom Lantos. ''I'm a representative of the animal kingdom and
we all need your help,'' the Sesame Street character said with the
help of puppeteer Steve Whitmire.
</P>
<P>
   After exchanging flirtations with actresses Bo Derek, Melanie
Griffith and Griffith's mother, Tippi Hedren, Kermit quipped, ''I,
too, am endangered. When I go home to Miss Piggy, I'm going to be
in serious trouble.''
</P>
<P>
   Hedren, a long-time animal protection activist, went to Lantos,
D-Calif., with the idea for the legislation because too many people
are being mauled by ocelots, wolves and tigers that are adopted as
pets when cubs but then outgrow the ability of owners to feed and
control them.
</P>
<P>
   Griffith said as many as 7,000 tigers alone are living in
people's back yards as pets or, in the case of drug dealers, guard
animals to ward off police.
</P>
<P>
   Many are abandoned or euthanized once they become too much of a
burden to their owners, Hedren said.
</P>
<P>
   Lantos' bill would require the owners of exotic mammals to get a
license from the Agriculture Department and show that they have the
facilities and capability to keep the animals safely and humanely.

<HEADLINE> Bush speaks glowingly of Whitman while continuing education talk  </HEADLINE>
By GLEN JOHNSON, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEWARK, N.J. (AP) -- George W. Bush, reaching out to women and
political moderates, kept up his focus on education Wednesday and
suggested that support for abortion rights wouldn't necessarily
disqualify any potential running mate.
</P>
<P>
   Bush, the expected Republican presidential nominee, toured a
charter school that he said showed how his proposal for
alternatives to failing schools could work. New Jersey Gov.
Christie Whitman, mentioned by some as a possible vice presidential
choice, accompanied him.
</P>
<P>
   While saying he had not made any running mate lists, Bush spoke
warmly of Whitman when reporters asked about her chances, even
though he opposes abortion and she favors abortion rights.
</P>
<P>
   ''Good people can disagree on the issue, and I understand that
and I'm standing here with a friend of mine,'' Bush said after he
and Whitman toured the North Star Academy, an inner-city charter
school with a 700-child waiting list.
</P>
<P>
   ''We disagree on some aspects of the issue,'' Bush added. ''That
doesn't mean we can't be pulling for the same thing, being on the
same team, and I respect Governor Whitman's views and I respect her
as a person.''
</P>
<P>
   The Texas governor's comments on abortion and his focus this
week on education were part of his move back toward the political
center after a bitter Republican primary campaign in which some
analysts believe he moved too far right.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday, Bush rolled out a $5 billion reading initiative. On
Thursday in Wisconsin, Bush plans to promote teacher recruiting and
retraining.
</P>
<P>
   Bush started his day Wednesday by having breakfast with
Archbishop Theodore McCarrick, the Roman Catholic head in Newark.
During the primary campaign, Bush was criticized for speaking at
Bob Jones University, a South Carolina school whose leaders have
embraced anti-Catholic views.
</P>
<P>
   In the last two elections, the GOP has been plagued by a gender
gap, the trend for men to support Republicans and women to support
Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   In recent polls, Vice President Al Gore, the likely Democratic
nominee, is running only several percentage points ahead of Bush
among women, however, while the Texas governor is outpolling Gore
among men by about one dozen percentage points.
</P>
<P>
   Steve Salmore, a Republican political analyst from New Jersey,
said Whitman would be an unlikely choice for Bush because her
pro-abortion views could inflame internal conflict.
</P>
<P>
   ''She has become a symbol for many people of the pro-choice
Republicans. I think it would make that issue a major issue of
division at the convention, and I don't think George Bush needs
that,'' Salmore said.
</P>
<P>
   Chuck Donovan, who replaced former GOP presidential candidate
Gary Bauer as head of the Family Research Council, said in a
statement ''it is common practice for guests to compliment their
hosts.''
</P>
<P>
   But Donovan also delivered an implicit warning to Bush, saying
that when presidential candidates pick running mates they ''send a
strong signal to the American people about whether they are serious
about defending the most defenseless members of the human family,
our unborn children.''
</P>
<P>
   Abortion-rights supporters were quick to pounce on Bush.
</P>
<P>
   Kate Michelman, president of the National Abortion and
Reproductive Rights Action League, said Bush is ''madly to try to
reposition himself from being out on the right wing,'' but it won't
work.
</P>
<P>
   ''Christie Todd Whitman is not going to change the reality that
George W. Bush is a threat to women's constitutional and legal
right to reproductive choice -- no matter what he says,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Whitman, campaigning with Bush on Tuesday and Wednesday in New
Jersey, twice introduced him by saying his compassionate
conservative philosophy ''transcends litmus tests.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush, calling Whitman a friend, said, ''I can't wait to campaign
with her, not only in the state of New Jersey but all around
America.''
</P>
<P>
   The two served as co-chairmen of the 1996 Republican National
Convention.
</P>
<P>
   Touring the North Star Academy, Bush watched math students doing
academic calisthenics, racing through addition tables and answering
questions such as what is a quadrangle.
</P>
<P>
   ''This charter school shows that all children can learn, and I
resent those who stand in the way of education reform, those who
say that giving parents different options if they're dissatisfied
with the status quo isn't right,'' Bush told students clad in polo
shirts and khakis.
</P>
<P>
   Whitman signed legislation in 1996 paving the way for North
Star, the first charter school in the state.
</P>
<P>
   Both Bush and Gore back charter schools, created by a group of
teachers, community members or parents. They operate free of most
state laws and regulations but must be approved by a local
chartering authority after outlining educational goals, procedures
and standards.
</P>
<P>
   Later Wednesday, Bush held a private reception with New York
Gov. George Pataki, then spoke at a $500,000 fund-raiser in New
York that also was attended by Mayor Rudolph Giuliani.

<HEADLINE> Haiti Protesters Turn Violent  </HEADLINE>
By MICHAEL NORTON, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   PORT-AU-PRINCE, Haiti (AP) -- Small groups of protesters blocked
traffic and threw rocks at vehicles in parts of Port-au-Prince on
Wednesday in a third day of protests over Haiti's election process.
</P>
<P>
   Many store owners refused to open their shops as protesters set
up flaming tire barricades at intersections leading to the downtown
business district. Some protesters fired shots into the air in the
midtown Sans Fil slum, and two cars were set afire on a seaside
boulevard.
</P>
<P>
   Four people, including a local voter registration official, were
killed during protests Monday. Late Tuesday, gunmen shot and killed
a local opposition party official, Legitime Atis, and his wife in
their home some 25 miles west of the capital, opposition politician
Hubert Deronceray said.
</P>
<P>
   The protesters claim to be partisans of former President
Jean-Bertrand Aristide. Some have demanded the resignation of
Haiti's elections council, which has twice postponed elections,
citing organizational difficulties. Other demonstrators want more
time to register for the legislative and municipal elections, now
set for April 9.
</P>
<P>
   Opposition politicians say the conflicting demands are evidence
that protesters are simply trying to cause a disruption and delay
the legislative and local elections until presidential elections in
December, when Aristide, Haiti's most popular politician, is
running for a second term. That way, pro-Aristide candidates could
ride his coattails into office, the politicians claim.
</P>
<P>
   Aristide was president from 1991 to 1996 but was forced to step
down by Haiti's constitution, which bars presidents from successive
five-year terms. The current president, Rene Preval, is an Aristide
supporter.
</P>
<P>
   The latest impasse began in January 1999, when Preval shut down
Parliament, appointed a provisional electoral council and called
for new elections. The council set voting for April 9 and May 21,
but Preval is claiming the dates are invalid.
</P>
<P>
   Premier Jacques-Edouard Alexis insisted Tuesday that elections
will be held as soon as possible. On Wednesday, Justice Minister
Camille Leblanc pleaded for calm.
</P>
<P>
   ''Nobody is preventing people from demonstrating lawfully, but
nobody has the right to hold the population hostage,'' Leblanc said
in an interview with the private Radio Signal.

<HEADLINE> Teen Band 'N Sync Breaks Record  </HEADLINE>
By DAVID BAUDER, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- It's been nothing but ''buy buy buy'' for 'N
Sync fans.
</P>
<P>
   In a remarkable display of teen-age buying power, the pop
heartthrobs sold 2.4 million copies of their new disc in seven days
-- more than double the previous record. The disc features their
latest hit ''Bye, Bye, Bye.''
</P>
<P>
   Sales of their ''No Strings Attached'' album swamped the 1.13
million sold by 'N Sync's fellow boy band, the Backstreet Boys,
last year.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, executives at 'N Sync's label, Jive Records, suspect
the sales record was broken in just one day, when ''No Strings
Attached'' first appeared in stores March 21. But they have no
figures to confirm this.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's pretty staggering,'' Barry Weiss, Jive Records president,
said Wednesday. ''It's pretty amazing, it's pretty numbing, it's
pretty great. This is really what the music business needs -- it's
getting young people interested in music again.''
</P>
<P>
   Since 'N Sync came from the same Orlando-based hit factory as
fellow Jive artists Backstreet Boys, they have long been considered
junior partners at best, knockoffs at worst. Not anymore.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's like going into the Super Bowl,'' said 'N Sync's manager,
Johnny Wright. ''You always want to come out on top. If you have
defending champions, you want to knock them off.''
</P>
<P>
   A burgeoning teen population -- the children of the original rock
'n' roll generation -- and a booming economy combined to trigger the
explosion of sales, said Alan Light, editor of Spin magazine.
</P>
<P>
   The success of the Backstreet Boys, Britney Spears and Christina
Aguilera have paved the way for mainstream media acceptance of 'N
Sync, Light said. The band has appeared on magazine covers, was on
''Saturday Night Live'' three weeks ago and is a regular on MTV.
</P>
<P>
   'N Sync touched off a mini-riot outside MTV's Times Square
studio when it performed there the weekend before the album was
released.
</P>
<P>
   Band members are personable and accessible to their fans,
particularly girls aged 8 to 18 who worship them, Weiss said.
</P>
<P>
   Besides the Backstreet Boys' ''Millennium,'' only two other
albums are known to have sold more than 1 million copies in a week:
Garth Brooks' ''Double Live'' album and the soundtrack to ''The
Bodyguard,'' according to Soundscan. The company has been measuring
album sales in the U.S. since 1991; precise sales figures before
then are considered somewhat unreliable.
</P>
<P>
   Jive, which pressed more than 6 million copies of the CD to be
ready for the consumer rush, will try to break its own record when
the Backstreet Boys release a new album in October.

<HEADLINE> Notorious Mexico Kidnapper Captured  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   MEXICO CITY (AP) -- Federal police have captured one of the
country's most-wanted kidnappers: a man known as the Colonel whose
trademark was cutting off his victims' pinkie fingers.
</P>
<P>
   Marcos Tinoco was arrested Monday in Mexico City, police said in
a news release. At the time of his capture, he was carrying a 9mm
Beretta pistol, a diamond-encrusted gold Rolex watch, more than
$8,000 in cash and a fake driver's license.
</P>
<P>
   Later, during an inspection of his hotel room on a highway
between Mexico City and Toluca, the capital of Mexico state, police
found a rifle, stun gun, fake mustaches, handcuffs and false
stationery from the Mexican attorney general's office and the
interior ministry.
</P>
<P>
   Tinoco, 41, headed more than five separate kidnapping cells and
was responsible for at least 11 abductions, the last of which took
place last week, authorities said. He allegedly cut the last finger
of the right hand off some of his victims.

<HEADLINE> AM-NY--Nuclear Sale, 1st Ld-Writethru,0850  </HEADLINE>
By ANNY KUO, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) -- As sale of two state-owned nuclear power
plants come closer to completion, another debate is just beginning
-- how to spend the $967 million the New York Power Authority will
eventually receive for the transaction.
</P>
<P>
   NYPA agreed Tuesday to sell its Indian Point 3 nuclear plant in
Westchester County and the James A. FitzPatrick nuclear facility in
Oswego County to New Orleans-based Entergy Corp. If approved by the
federal Nuclear Regulatory Commission, the sale would be the
largest privatization of state assets in New York history.
</P>
<P>
   NYPA plans to use part of the proceeds from the sale to pay off
debts of the Indian Point 3 plant, but beyond that, nothing is
certain at this point, authority spokesman Mike Petralia said.
</P>
<P>
   Some ideas NYPA may consider include electric rate reduction,
economic development, infrastructure maintenance and research and
development, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's premature to tell what exactly are suggestions we're
coming up with. We expect and welcome input from the Legislature
and the governor,'' Petralia said.
</P>
<P>
   The purchase price for the 980-megawatt Indian Point 3 plant and
the 825-megawatt FitzPatrick plant includes the value of nuclear
fuel at the two plants. The 1,700 staffers at the authority's
nuclear division will also start working for Entergy.
</P>
<P>
   Petralia said Entergy will make an initial payment of $50
million at closing of the transaction, followed by seven years in
equal installments of $108.1 million for the plants and the fuel.
These payments would begin one year after closing.
</P>
<P>
   When the seven-year payments are complete, Entergy will then
make eight annual cash payments of $20 million toward the plants'
decommissioning expenses and other costs.
</P>
<P>
   Most state legislators seemed to agree that part of the proceeds
should go toward debt reduction for Indian Point 3, but opinions
varied on how the remainder should be spent.
</P>
<P>
   Petralia said although NYPA has the most say on how to spend the
money, its decision could still be overidden legislatively -- a
route that some lawmakers said they may take.
</P>
<P>
   The nuclear plant sale provides a ''golden opportunity'' to put
together a ''blueprint to help people in energy conservation and
rate reduction in the time of an energy crisis,'' said Assemblyman
Paul Tonko, chairman of the Assembly energy committee.
</P>
<P>
   Tonko, an Amsterdam Democrat, said proposed Assembly legislation
called Energy 2000 would require that the money be spent on energy
conservation, pollution reduction and innovative rate reduction
initiatives. For instance, he said sale proceeds could be used to
help businesses and farms retrofit facilities to ultimately
decrease their energy consumption.
</P>
<P>
   Assemblyman Richard Brodsky, chairman of the Assembly
environmental conservation committee, said he is concerned that if
the power authority shifts proceeds for debt reduction or
maintenance of its facilities upstate, it could end up being
''regionally discriminatory.''
</P>
<P>
   ''They have been unable to recognize energy needs of downstate
New York ... communities that bore the burden of Indian Point 3,''
the Westchester County Democrat said.
</P>
<P>
   Brodsky wants the power authority to spend the money on energy
conservation projects, environmental cleanup and funding community
and public oversight of the plants.
</P>
<P>
   Michael McKeon, a spokesman for Gov. George Pataki, said there
are still ''twists and turns'' before the money starts coming in.
He added that ultimately the proceeds should go toward ''lowering
energy rates and creating economic opportunities.''
</P>
<P>
   Even local officials want a piece of the proceeds pie. Susan
Tolchin, spokeswoman for Westchester County Executive Andrew Spano,
said any energy cost savings resulting from the sale of the Indian
Point 3 plant should be passed onto county residents.
</P>
<P>
   Tolchin said another issue is taxes. Privatizing the nuclear
plants would mean the facilities are no longer tax-exempt. The sale
contract does not include any provision for special tax status for
Entergy, NYPA's Petralia said.
</P>
<P>
   With Entergy showing interest in purchasing Indian Point 2,
adjacent from the Indian Point 3, plant from Con Edison, Tolchin
said the county would need to sit down and ''determine the real
estate issues'' with Entergy.
</P>
<P>
   ''We need to be sure that the tax base will be at leas the
same,'' she said. The utility would have to pay taxes to
Westchester County, the village of Buchanan and the Hendrick Hudson
School District.
</P>
<P>
   Entergy Carl Crawford said the utility will meet with local
taxing jurisdictions once the sale is finalized and discuss tax
payments.
</P>
<P>
   ''We expect to pay fair taxes,'' Crawford said.
</P>
<P>
   Oswego County Administrator Jack Tierny said it's still too
early to tell how much in taxes the sale of the FitzPatrick plant
will generate for the county, the town of Scriba and the Mexico
Central School District. But nevertheless, the sale is ''all good
news,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ''We were getting zero before. Now we're getting more than
zero,'' Tierny said.

   Nasdaq Off 189.22; Dow Ends Up 82.61
</P>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Technology stocks tumbled for a third
consecutive session today, dragging the Nasdaq composite lower and
providing the only blemish on a broad-based advance by the Dow
Jones industrials. The technology-dominated Nasdaq composite index
fell 189.22 to close at 4,644.67. Five stocks fell for every two
that rose. The Dow Jones industrial average rose 82.61 to close at
11,018.72. Investors today continued a wave of selling that gained
momentum yesterday, when Abby Joseph Cohen, Goldman Sachs's chief
investment strategist, said many technology stocks are now fully
valued and have little room for further gains. Applied Materials,
Sun Microsystems and Yahoo! fell. Dow components IBM and
Hewlett-Packard also closed lower.

   Clinton Hails OPEC Production Boost
</P>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Clinton said today the OPEC decision
to increase oil production is ''good news for our economy and for
the American consumer,'' and he urged U.S. oil companies to act
quickly to deliver savings at the gas pump. At a White House news
conference, Clinton said the OPEC agreement to up production by 6.3
percent should reduce both home heating costs and gasoline prices
over the next few weeks, and he asked the U.S. industry to try to

Communications Inc. AT&AMP;T stock was up 11/16 at 60 5/16. The new
arrangement gives AT&AMP;T a majority on the board of directors at
ExciteAtHome, which will be scrapping plans to issue a new
''tracking'' stock that would represent its Web content and
programming operations. No money is changing hands in the
agreement, though new warrants to buy stock in ExciteAtHome have
been issued to all three cable companies as an incentive. AT&AMP;T aksi
agreed to feature the ExciteAtHome service on its cable systems
through 2008, while Comcast and Cox will feature the service

93 percent of the nearly 41,000 actors who voted. Fewer than a
third of the unions' members cast ballots, however. The
authorization allows the unions' boards of directors to call a work
stoppage but doesn't require it. Only work on commercials would be

<HEADLINE> Few Cities Devastated by Tornadoes  </HEADLINE>
By The Associated Press	   About 1,200 tornadoes touch down in the United States
every
year, but few hit densely populated areas.
<TEXT>
<P>
   ''Mathematically, the United States will see an urban tornado
once every year, once every other year,'' said Joe Schaefer,
director the National Weather Service's Storm Prediction Center.
</P>
<P>
   The one that struck Fort Worth, Texas, on Tuesday caused
extensive damage but few deaths, unlike a tornado that struck St.
Louis in 1896, killing 400.
</P>
<P>
   Advanced warning systems have saved many lives by predicting
where and when a tornado may strike. Nevertheless, Schaefer has
this advice to people living in tornado-prone areas: ''Watch the
sky, listen to the radio and use a little common sense.''
</P>
<P>
   Some recent examples of urban areas being hit by twisters:
</P>
<P>
   -- Jan. 21, 1999: Little Rock, Ark., three killed.
</P>
<P>
   -- Aug. 11, 1999: Salt Lake City, one killed.
</P>
<P>
   -- May 3, 1999: Oklahoma City and surrounding area, 44 killed.
</P>
<P>
   -- Feb. 22, 1998: Daytona Beach, Fla., one killed.
</P>
<P>
   -- April 16, 1998: Nashville, Tenn., one killed.
</P>
<P>
   -- Dec. 7, 1996: Tampa, Fla., one killed.
</P>
<P>
   Some examples of urban areas struck in the 19th century:
</P>
<P>
   -- May 7, 1840: Natchez, Miss., more than 300 dead.
</P>
<P>
   -- May 27, 1896: St. Louis, more than 400 dead.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Calls for China Trade Vote  </HEADLINE>
By TOM RAUM, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The economic fallout will be bad, but ''the
national security consequences will be worse'' if Congress rejects
China trade legislation, President Clinton said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Passing the bill is ''a 100-to-nothing deal for us,'' Clinton
asserted.
</P>
<P>
   Trying to increase pressure on Congress to pass the troubled
measure as soon as possible, Clinton told a White House news
conference that the United States has nothing to lose and
everything to gain from the legislation.
</P>
<P>
   ''All the concessions are being made by China in return for
entering an open trading system,'' Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
   But supporters of the measure, which has heavy labor opposition,
conceded the battle for granting China permanent normal trade
relations this year remains a difficult one.
</P>
<P>
   ''I know it's an uphill battle. But I do believe that it is
possible,'' said Senate Majority Leader Tom Daschle, D-S.D.
</P>
<P>
   Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott, R-Miss., said he hoped the
bill could be debated in the Senate by late May or early June, a
timetable that has the support of the administration.
</P>
<P>
   The administration is asking Congress to give China the same
permanent low-tariff access to U.S. markets it routinely gives
nearly all other trading partners. Currently, China's status must
be renewed annually.
</P>
<P>
   The legislation would facilitate China's bid to join the World
Trade Organization, the Geneva-based organization that sets the
rules for world trade. Congress does not get to vote directly on
China's WTO membership, only on whether to make its trade status
permanent.
</P>
<P>
   In the House, Democratic Whip David Bonior, D-Mich., gathered
signatures Wednesday on a letter to Clinton urging him to call off
the vote.
</P>
<P>
   The letter, to be made public on Thursday, includes the
signatures of 15-20 Democrats who in the past have supported annual
trade benefits with China, according to Bonior spokesman Fred
Clarke.
</P>
<P>
   Republican House leaders have said they need at least 90-100
Democratic votes for the China trade bill for it to pass.
Democratic supporters concede that will be a hard target to meet.
</P>
<P>
   While most Republicans support expanded trade with China,
Democrats are divided -- largely because of opposition by labor and
environmental groups.
</P>
<P>
   But Clinton insisted the opposition was misplaced. Rejecting the
trade deal won't help protect U.S. jobs, it will only turn China
away from U.S. markets and block American access to Chinese ones,
Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
   ''Especially we need to give our businesses, farmers, and
workers access to the world's largest consumer market in China,''
Clinton said. ''There is no more important long-term international
economic or national security issue facing us today.''
</P>
<P>
   ''If we do not do this, then the full benefits of all we
negotiated will flow to all the other countries in the WTO, but not
to the United States. The economic consequences will be bad. The
national security consequences will be worse,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ''We're not giving up anything here ... It's a 100-to-nothing
deal for us,'' he added. ''If we reject it, we'll lose economic
opportunities we will regret for 20 years and we'll hurt our
national security interests.''
</P>
<P>
   The administration claims that turning away from China
economically will only aggravate tensions and lead to greater
instability in the U.S.-Chinese relationship.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton, meanwhile, said he was ''very impressed'' with Taiwan's
President-elect Chen Shui-bian for not further inflaming tensions
with the mainland since his election victory last week.
</P>
<P>
   In advance of the election, China had strongly criticized what
it viewed as Chen's pro-independence position, and had threatened
the use of force if Taiwan resisted reunification talks
indefinitely.
</P>
<P>
   The flare up had made it even more difficult for the
administration to win support for its China trade package, given
strong pro-Taiwan sentiment in Congress.
</P>
<P>
   ''He seems to be quite well aware of the weighty responsibility
he now has and the great opportunity he has,'' Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
   Neither China nor Taiwan ''need this crisis right now,'' Clinton
said.
</P>
<P>
   Beijing regards Taiwan as a renegade province.

<HEADLINE> AP Makes 2 Appointments  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- The Associated Press has made two appointments
to enhance its state news reports and editorial staff training.
</P>
<P>
   Sarah Nordgren, an assistant managing editor of the Daily Herald
in Arlington Heights, Ill., and a former AP assistant chief of
bureau in Chicago, is rejoining the AP as deputy director of state
news.
</P>
<P>
   John Dowling, news editor in the AP's Chicago bureau, has been
promoted to deputy director of editorial training.
</P>
<P>
   The appointments were announced Wednesday by William E. Ahearn,
vice president and executive editor.
</P>
<P>
   Dowling and Nordgren both will be based in the Chicago bureau.
Dowling reports to Barbara King Lord, director of editorial
training, and Nordgren will report to Martin C. Thompson, director
of state news.
</P>
<P>
   Nordgren, 45, has been editor for Page 1 at the Daily Herald
since moving there last year after 14 years with the AP. She joined
the AP in Chicago and worked as a reporter specializing in children
and family issues and as a desk supervisor. She was promoted to
assistant chief of bureau in 1997. She won three Lisagor Awards
from the Chicago Headline Club, one each for writing, reporting and
magazine writing.
</P>
<P>
   Nordgren is a native of Omaha, Neb., and graduate of William
Smith College and Boston University. She previously worked for
Chicago's City News Bureau and for United Press International.
</P>
<P>
   Dowling, 42, began his AP career in 1979 as an office assistant
in Chicago and worked as a newsman there and in the AP's statehouse
bureau in Springfield before being named correspondent in charge of
the Springfield bureau in 1988. He shared Lisagor awards in 1982
for coverage of the Tylenol murders and in 1984 for a series on
lobbyists. He was promoted to news editor in Minneapolis in 1991
and to news editor in Chicago two years later.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Senate GOP Weighs in on Tax Relief  </HEADLINE>
By CURT ANDERSON, AP Tax Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Senate Republicans are leaning toward
expanding their legislation easing the tax code's marriage penalty
in order to provide $10 billion in additional tax relief for
couples on the higher and lower rungs of the income ladder.
</P>
<P>
   One proposed change, sought by GOP conservatives, would
gradually adjust the 28 percent tax rate so it applies to more of a
married couple's income, making the bracket twice that of single
filers. The original bill did the same thing only to the bottom 15
percent tax bracket, similar to the House-passed version.
</P>
<P>
   In current law, two people who are married pay income taxes at
higher rates in both the 15 percent and 28 percent brackets than
they would if they were single. About 25 million couples nationwide
are hit by the tax code's marriage penalty.
</P>
<P>
   The other change would raise the income cutoff by $2,500 for
lower-income couples who claim the earned income tax credit, up
from $2,000 in the original bill. This change was suggested by Sen.
Jim Jeffords of Vermont, a leading GOP moderate.
</P>
<P>
   The two changes would bring the bill's total cost over 10 years
to about $250 billion using projected budget surpluses, according
to Senate aides who described the proposed changes Wednesday on
condition of anonymity. The House bill, which has drawn a veto
threat from President Clinton over its cost, carries a price tag of
$182 billion over 10 years.
</P>
<P>
   The Senate Finance Committee was to consider the measure
Thursday. The committee chairman and chief sponsor of the bill,
Sen. William Roth, R-Del., was expected to incorporate both of the
GOP's changes in an amendment, the sources said.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Democrats on the Finance Committee were working on an
alternative by Sen. Daniel Patrick Moynihan of New York that would
eventually allow couples the choice of filing their income taxes as
singles or as a married couple. The change would be phased in
slowly to avoid a sudden drain on the budget surplus. It still
would cost an estimated $150 billion over 10 years.
</P>
<P>
   Other Democrats were pushing for an amendment that would further
increase the income cutoff for couples who claim the earned income
tax credit and would allow the lower-earning spouse to claim a tax
credit of up to $500 as a way of offsetting the marriage penalty.

<HEADLINE> Priest: No Role in Guatemala Death  </HEADLINE>
By WILL WEISSERT, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   GUATEMALA CITY (AP) -- A priest who returned here from the United
States to face murder charges denied Wednesday that he had any role
in the 1998 slaying of his former boss, outspoken human rights
leader Bishop Juan Gerardi.
</P>
<P>
   Gerardi, 65, was bludgeoned to death with a concrete block in a
seminary in 1998, two days after he presented a report blaming the
military for the vast majority of the 200,000 deaths that occurred
during Guatemala's 36-year civil war.
</P>
<P>
   Though many have accused the military of killing him,
prosecutors earlier this month charged Gerardi's assistant, Rev.
Mario Orantes, in the slaying for the second time.
</P>
<P>
   ''I didn't see anything, I didn't hear anything, I didn't do
anything,'' Orantes told journalists Wednesday from a hospital bed
in his first comments since returning to the country on Feb. 9.
</P>
<P>
   ''All I did was find my brother, Bishop Gerardi, murdered,''
said Orantes, 42, at a hospital in the northern suburbs of
Guatemala City. His lawyers say he is too sick with an unidentified
nervous system problem to be taken into police custody.
</P>
<P>
   Orantes, who told police he found Gerardi's body in the
seminary's garage, was arrested in the weeks following the murder.
The Roman Catholic priest spent seven months in jail, but
prosecutors never said what motive he may have had for killing his
superior.
</P>
<P>
   Orantes was released and allowed to travel to Houston for
medical reasons last fall after church leaders and human rights
groups protested that authorities were overlooking possible
military involvement in the crime.
</P>
<P>
   Judge Flor de Maria Garcia ordered Orantes to return to
Guatemala in February after a ''reexamination'' of the nearly
2-year-old evidence on record.
</P>
<P>
   Orantes was charged with murder again on March 10. Since then
police officers have been posted outside his room.
</P>
<P>
   ''After all this time here I still do not know the reasons I
have again been charged. If the evidence was so important you would
think I would have heard about it by now,'' Orantes said.
</P>
<P>
   Court-appointed doctors will decide Friday whether Orantes is
well enough to be taken into police custody or should remain
hospitalized.
</P>
<P>
   Orantes' lawyers will meet with Judge de Maria Garcia on
Thursday in an attempt to persuade her to dismiss the new charges.
</P>
<P>
   ''We are confident we can show that the witness testimony that
prompted these charges is contradictory and that there is no other
evidence that points to Father Orantes,'' said defense lawyer Luis
Mazariegos. ''There can be no doubt he is innocent and we will show
that.''

<HEADLINE> Ben &AMP; Jerry's Stock Soars  </HEADLINE>
By ROSS SNEYD, AP Business Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   MONTPELIER, Vt. (AP) -- Denying frosty relations that might add a
Ben &AMP; Jerry's Split to a quirky ice cream lineup, Ben Cohen and
Jerry Greenfield say they are better friends than ever amid reports
Cohen is taking the company private without Greenfield.
</P>
<P>
   The company's shares soared almost 15 percent Wednesday as Ben &AMP;
Jerry's Homemade Inc. confirmed it has received a takeover offer
but denied its board had approved a deal.
</P>
<P>
   The company's statement followed a report Wednesday in The New
York Times that Ben &AMP; Jerry's would go private in a $260 million
deal that could pay stockholders $38 a share.
</P>
<P>
   Ben &AMP; Jerry's stock surged $4.40| to close at $34.37{ a share on
the Nasdaq Stock Market, almost $3 above its previous 52-week high.
</P>
<P>
   Ben &AMP; Jerry's stock has traded as low as $15 a share in the past
year.
</P>
<P>
   ''If I were a shareholder, I would jump at it,'' said financial
analyst Lewis H. Alton of L.H. Alton &AMP; Co. in San Francisco.
</P>
<P>
   The report said Cohen, who currently controls about 1 million
shares of Ben &AMP; Jerry's, would take a 36 percent stake in the
company. It said Meadowbrook Lane Capital, an investors group
describing itself as socially responsible, would get a similar
share and Unilever, a British-Dutch company that owns Breyer's ice
cream and Good Humor bars, would take 28 percent.
</P>
<P>
   None of the principals in the reported deal would discuss it
Wednesday. Ben &AMP; Jerry's confirmed that a proposed deal among
Cohen, Meadowbrook and Unilever had been presented to its board
last Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   ''There are a number of unresolved issues that would need to be
agreed upon before such a transaction could be presented for its
definitive approval,'' the company's statement said. ''Accordingly,
there can be no assurance that these issues will be resolved or
that such a transaction will, in fact, be approved by the board.''
</P>
<P>
   A telephone message left for Terry Mollner, a principal in
Meadowbrook Capital, was not immediately returned.
</P>
<P>
   The deal reportedly would leave Greenfield out of the
reorganized company. The New York Times reported that had created a
rift between Cohen and Greenfield, the irreverent ex-hippies who
founded the company in a converted gasoline station in Burlington
22 years ago, but Ben &AMP; Jerry's officials denied it.
</P>
<P>
   ''Recent rumors of a rift? We have been friends since we met
over 35 years ago in junior high school, where we were the two
slowest, fattest kids in our gym class. Today we are slower and
fatter and better friends than ever. We expect that trend to
continue,'' said a joint statement issued by Cohen and Greenfield.
</P>
<P>
   Ben &AMP; Jerry's executives and the board have been mulling the
fate of the manufacturer of such ice cream as Cherry Garcia and
Phish Food since December, when the company received what it only
has described as expressions of interest in taking over the
company.
</P>
<P>
   It has left Cohen and Greenfield in a quandary because much of
their company is built on a dedication to their notion of corporate
social responsibility. They and others involved in that movement,
including some owners of Ben &AMP; Jerry's franchises, have said they
were worried that a traditional business might move the company
away from that movement.
</P>
<P>
   Alton said his understanding of the pending deal led him to
believe that Ben &AMP; Jerry's would be able to maintain its existing
corporate climate, despite the involvement of a company such as
Unilever.
</P>
<P>
   ''Under this setup, Unilever would have a minority position,''
he said. ''Ben Cohen would have roughly a third of the company.''

<HEADLINE> BellSouth To Issue Tracking Stock  </HEADLINE>
By JUSTIN BACHMAN, AP Business Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA (AP) -- BellSouth Corp., the regional phone company
serving the Southeast, hopes to capitalize on the growth of
communications in Latin America by issuing stock to track the
performance of its operations there.
</P>
<P>
   BellSouth lost $316 million in Latin America last year on
revenues of $2.4 billion, including $1.1 billion from Venezuela and
nearly $800 million from Argentina.
</P>
<P>
   But with a Latin American population of nearly half a billion
people and rising living standards, the company expects the number
of Internet, voice mail, pager and cellular phone customers to
increase dramatically.
</P>
<P>
   The number of Internet accounts in the region is expected to
increase 87 percent through 2002, according to research BellSouth
filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission.
</P>
<P>
   Tracking stocks have become popular among companies as a way to
exploit the growth in one or more of their divisions, allowing
investors to purchase opportunities in a specific segment of a
company's business. They don't confer actual ownership of the
company.
</P>
<P>
   If approved by the SEC and BellSouth shareholders, the stock
would be offered in late summer on the New York Stock Exchange.
</P>
<P>
   In late trading, BellSouth's stock was up $2.13 at $47.25
Wednesday on the New York Stock Exchange.
</P>
<P>
   BellSouth has 4.2 million customers in Argentina, Brazil, Chile,
Ecuador, Guatemala, Nicaragua, Panama, Peru, Uruguay and Venezuela.
Through local partnerships, it serves an additional 2 million.

<HEADLINE> Crude Oil Prices Fall  </HEADLINE>
By HERBERT G. McCANN, AP Business Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   Crude oil and other energy futures prices fell sharply Wednesday
on the New York Mercantile Exchange as the market continued to
react to OPEC's decision to increase production and Iran's decision
to go along with the other members of the cartel.
</P>
<P>
   Mexico, one of the leading oil producers not in the Organization
of the Petroleum Exporting Countries, also plans to increase
output. The expectation is that Norway on Thursday will also
announce a production increase.
</P>
<P>
   In other markets, gold and silver futures prices fell.
</P>
<P>
   Iran, OPEC's second-largest producer after Saudi Arabia, had
refused to join in the cartel's latest production increase, a
decision made after a two-day meeting in Vienna, Austria. However,
Iran's OPEC representative said Wednesday his country would not
give up market share to other members, prompting a reversal of its
stance.
</P>
<P>
   If Iran increases production on the same scale as other OPEC
members, the cartel would boost total output by 1.7 million barrels
a day -- more than 7 percent above the ceiling it set for itself
last March.
</P>
<P>
   Mexico on Wednesday said it would boost its exports by 150,000
barrels a day on Saturday in a coordinated move with OPEC. And
although Norway, the world's largest oil producer, has little
additional capacity, it is expected to increase its oil production,
said analyst James Steel of Refco Inc.
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton administration lobbied OPEC for an increase of 2
million to 2.5 million barrels a day to lower gasoline prices,
which now average $1.60 a gallon in the U.S. The curb in production
caused U.S. oil prices to triple to a March 8 peak of $34.37 per
barrel.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton on Wednesday praised OPEC's decision to
increase production and urged U.S. oil companies to pass on the
savings at the gas pump.
</P>
<P>
   It is expected the decision by OPEC will result in several
members producing beyond their quotas. Already, Qatar, Libya and
Indonesia are overproducing, which is contributing to the market's
selloff, Steel said.
</P>
<P>
   OPEC currently is producing 26.6 million barrels of crude daily,
about 1 million barrels above its 25.6 million barrel target set
last March.
</P>
<P>
   OPEC plans to review market conditions in June, which could open
the door to further production increases.
</P>
<P>
   The cartel indicated it will try to keep the price of oil
between $22 to $28 a barrel. If the market is above or below that
range, the cartel will take action to correct that, Steel said.
</P>
<P>
   Saudi oil minister Ali Naimi said OPEC is not seeking to
micromanage the price of oil, but to put a stop the wide price
swings.
</P>
<P>
   Gasoline futures were hit by profit-taking prompted by belief
the increased production will result in an increase in gasoline
stocks, Steel said.
</P>
<P>
   The latest American Petroleum Institute figures show unleaded
gasoline stocks grew by 299,000 barrels to 198.5 million barrels
for the week ended March 24 as refineries operated at 90.4 percent
capacity, up from 90.1 the week before.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, U.S. crude oil stockpiles declined by 1.2 million
barrels to about 292 million barrels, according to API.
</P>
<P>
   Light sweet crude for May delivery settled 64 cents lower at
$26.45 a barrel; April heating oil was $1.65 cents lower at 72.51
cents a gallon; April unleaded gasoline was 3.88 cents lower at
91.30 cents a gallon; April natural gas was 6.3 cents lower at
$2.90 per 1,000 cubic feet.
</P>
<P>
   In London, North Sea Brent crude for May delivery sank $1.11 to
$24.40 a barrel on the International Petroleum Exchange.
</P>
<P>
   Dollar strength, particularly against the Euro, and a revived
stock market sent gold and silver futures prices tumbling on the
New York Mercantile Exchange.
</P>
<P>
   The market was led by the selloff of silver futures, which fell
below $5 for the first time in nearly nine months. Demand for
silver remains strong, which limited its decline, according to
analysts.
</P>
<P>
   Gold futures declined as bullion sales in Europe increased as
investors moved to the dollar.
</P>
<P>
   April gold was $4 lower at $275.50 a troy ounce, May silver was
12.4 cents lower at $4.98 a troy ounce.

<HEADLINE> Doctor: Aid Needed for Iraqi Victims  </HEADLINE>
By CLAR NI CHONGHAILE, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   PARIS (AP) -- A British doctor called for international medical
aid Wednesday for thousands of Iraqi Kurds suffering from a cancers
and congenital diseases 12 years after Iraq dropped chemical
weapons on the city of Halabja.
</P>
<P>
   Christine Gosden, head of medical genetics at Liverpool
University, said medical aid was desperately needed in the remote
northern Iraqi city where clouds of mustard and sarin gas killed
4,500 to 8,000 people in 1988.
</P>
<P>
   ''There is no palliative care and they suffer agonizing deaths.
Potential parents are dying before they can have children,'' said
Godsen, who has been campaigning for international help since
visiting Halabja in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   She cited a range of diseases afflicting the town's population,
including cancers, spina bifida and Downs Syndrome.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is only 12 years after the attack and the number of
cancers and congenital defects are increasing. It does not seem to
have reached a plateau,'' she told a news conference.
</P>
<P>
   She said she had no firm figures on how many people have died
since the attack. ''We would like to get the exact figures. We
would like to do a systematic survey,'' she added.
</P>
<P>
   The doctor accused the Iraqis of using the Kurds as guinea pigs
in the bombings, which were part of a campaign of repression
against Kurds who had supported Iran during the Iran-Iraq war.
</P>
<P>
   Gosden also said there were many cases of mental illness and an
increase in suicide attempts, even among the group judged least
prone to suicide -- young women with children.
</P>
<P>
   Around 250,000 people were exposed to chemical and biological
weapons during Iraqi bombardment of the region in 1988, and many
more were indirectly exposed through drinking contaminated water or
eating contaminated food, Gosden said.

<HEADLINE> Reform Rabbis Approve Gay Marriage  </HEADLINE>
By ESTES THOMPSON, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   GREENSBORO, N.C. (AP) -- Reform Jewish leaders on Wednesday
overwhelmingly approved a resolution giving rabbis the option of
presiding at gay commitment ceremonies.
</P>
<P>
   With the vote, the Central Conference of American Rabbis became
the most influential U.S. religious group to sanction same-sex
unions.
</P>
<P>
   The resolution applies to the 1,800 members of the Central
Conference of American Rabbis, who serve at least 1.5 million
Reform Jews. Reform Judaism is the largest and most liberal of
Judaism's three major branches in North America.
</P>
<P>
   Rabbi Charles Kroloff, CCAR's president, said the resolution
shows the conference's belief that ''gay and lesbian Jews, and the
committed relationships they form with their partners, deserve the
recognition and respect due to people created in the image of
God.''
</P>
<P>
   ''It is not sinful to be a gay and lesbian,'' said Rabbi Paul
Menitoff, executive vice president of CCAR. ''It is sinful to have
these prejudices and act out on them.''
</P>
<P>
   Menitoff said he hoped other religions would adopt the
resolution as a model.
</P>
<P>
   The resolution calls for the rabbinate to develop sample
ceremonies for rabbis who choose to officiate at same-gender
ceremonies. It also said the relationship between two same-gender
Jewish people is worthy of affirmation through Jewish ritual.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is a call to all religious denominations to bring the
same prophetic voice to lift our nation from the bonds of prejudice
to embrace all members of the American family,'' said Rabbi Eric
Weiss, executive director of the Bay Area Jewish Healing Center in
San Francisco, speaking on behalf of the Gay and Lesbian Rabbinic
Network.
</P>
<P>
   Because of the issue's volatility, sessions at the group's
annual convention here this week were held privately. The
resolution was approved overwhelmingly by a voice vote during
Wednesday's plenary session, CCAR officials said.
</P>
<P>
   Two years ago, the rabbis delayed voting on a similar proposal.
</P>
<P>
   The Torah condemns male homosexual intercourse, but Reform
Judaism now supports same-sex civil unions and a decade ago
approved openly gay rabbis. Some Reform rabbis have already
officiated at same-sex ceremonies at synagogues.
</P>
<P>
   Reform Judaism's rabbinate bases its position on contemporary
understanding of homosexuality and the Jewish values of human
dignity and justice.
</P>
<P>
   Opponents feared the resolution would divide rabbis and alienate
Reform Judaism from Israel, where it seeks stronger recognition.
</P>
<P>
   The Union of American Hebrew Congregations, a coalition of 895
Reform congregations, has approved resolutions supporting civil
unions and nondiscrimination against gays, and the Unitarian
Universalist Association has officially endorsed decisions by its
clergy to perform same-sex unions.
</P>
<P>
   Presbyterian, United Methodist and Episcopal church leaders are
expected to take up the issue this year.

<HEADLINE> College Expedition Ends in Tragedy  </HEADLINE>
By BEN FOX, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   BAHIA DE LOS ANGELES, Mexico (AP) -- As one of the world's
foremost experts on scorpions and spiders, Gary Polis wanted to
teach the world that the creatures should not be loathed or feared
but appreciated for their integral place in the ecosystem.
</P>
<P>
   This week, he and four other researchers apparently died in the
rough waters off Baja California while returning from a expedition
to study Polis' passion. Their 20-foot power boat was upended by
wind-churned waves, and they were tossed into the thrashing Sea of
Cortez.
</P>
<P>
   The bodies of three team members were found Tuesday. Polis and
another researcher were still missing Wednesday, but university
officials said they were presumed dead.
</P>
<P>
   Polis' enthusiasm for the kinds of creepy crawlies that send
shivers up the spines of many people inspired scores of students to
follow him to Mexico over the years to poke through the arid
Mexican landscape and discover their virtues.
</P>
<P>
   Polis, three Japanese researchers and five students from the
University of California at Davis were headed for Bahia de los
Angeles, a remote village 300 miles south of the Mexican border,
just before noon Monday after a morning of studying spiders and
scorpions on an island.
</P>
<P>
   After being thrown into the rough water, the group spent two
hours clinging to the boat, while the waves ''just pounded us,''
said one of the four survivors, Gary Huxel, 38, a post-doctoral
researcher in ecology.
</P>
<P>
   The 53-year-old Polis appeared to suffer a heart attack and die,
UC Davis spokeswoman Sylvia Wright said, citing accounts from the
survivors and U.S. officials.
</P>
<P>
   Eventually, Huxel said, the group used life jackets and seat
cushions to float away. After three more hours in the water, Huxel
washed up on one deserted island; three students reached another.
</P>
<P>
   The four of them were rescued Tuesday, sunburned and spent.
</P>
<P>
   Mexican authorities recovered the bodies of three team members:
UC Davis researcher Michael D. Rose, 28; and two ecology professors
from Japan's Kyoto University -- Takuya Abe, 55, and Masahiko
Higashi, 45.
</P>
<P>
   A Japanese assistant professor, Shigeru Nakano, 37, was missing
and also presumed dead.
</P>
<P>
   A U.S. Coast Guard plane and helicopter helped Mexican military
boats and aircraft search the waters Tuesday and Wednesday for the
missing men. More than 100 soldiers scanned the coastline without
success.
</P>
<P>
   The survivors and fellow UC Davis researchers -- who avoided the
disaster in a companion boat and alerted authorities -- quietly left
Bahia de los Angeles on Wednesday, driving out on the dirt road in
vans and cars sent in by the school.
</P>
<P>
   Polis, married and the father of two children, had tried to
spread his love of scorpions and spiders to a wide audience -- from
top scholars to children.
</P>
<P>
   ''He was a tremendously likable person, intense and bright,''
said Laurence Pringle of West Nyack, N.Y., who wrote ''Scorpion
Man,'' a 1994 children's book that described Polis' work and
featured his photos from the field.
</P>
<P>
   Polis, the chairman of UC Davis' environmental sciences
department and president of the American Society of Naturalists,
said in ''Scorpion Man'' that he decided to study biology because
he had fun outdoors. His fascination with scorpions began when he
saw one on a 1972 camping trip and discovered little was known
about the venomous creatures.
</P>
<P>
   ''When you talk about scorpions, you tend to use a lot of words
like 'the only known example,' 'the first,' 'the largest,''' Polis
said in the book. ''It's just one gee-whiz fact after another.''
</P>
<P>
   Philip Brownell, a professor of zoology at Oregon State
University, met Polis at the University of California at Riverside
in 1971. Over the years, they teamed up on books, television
projects and Smithsonian work.
</P>
<P>
   ''Gary was trying to understand the flow of nutrients and energy
from the ocean onto land. Spiders and scorpions are a step in that
movement. The material that floats onto shore is eaten by insects.
Scorpions and spiders eat the insects. Birds and other reptiles eat
the spiders and scorpions,'' Brownell said.
</P>
<P>
   The enormous variety of species in Baja California had drawn the
men to the harsh landscape since the 1980s. The last time the pair
visited the area, Brownell got caught in the bay's rough seas.
</P>
<P>
   ''When you get beyond the headlands, it gets rough and suddenly
winds come up,'' Brownell said.
</P>
<P>
   Knowing the boats they use for the expeditions, ''it's no wonder
they couldn't hold onto it. They just got in seas that were too
much for their boat.''

<HEADLINE> Lawmakers Try To Keep Elian in U.S.  </HEADLINE>
By TOM RAUM, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- A group of lawmakers seeking to block the
deportation of Elian Gonzalez introduced legislation Wednesday to
confer permanent American residency status on the 6-year-old boy
and nearly all his Cuban relatives.
</P>
<P>
   However, even supporters suggested the measure's chances of
being enacted seemed slight.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Bob Smith, R-N.H., the principal author, said the drama
unfolding in Miami presented a ''frightful'' possibility: ''a
little boy being dragged from his home by law enforcement people
and sent to Cuba. The Senate can stop this.''
</P>
<P>
   And Sen. Connie Mack, R-Fla., accused the Justice Department in
a Senate floor speech of putting ''unrealistic demands'' on the boy
and those caring for him.
</P>
<P>
   ''The government ... has bulldozed over the rights of Elian and
his Miami family,'' Mack said.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the heightened emotions, Smith said he didn't know
whether his measure would find much support, and conceded that
opponents could find parliamentary ways to delay it.
</P>
<P>
   The intensifying tug of war prompted President Clinton to urge
those on both sides of the issue to let the courts resolve the
dispute.
</P>
<P>
   ''There is a legal process here, we ought to let it play out,''
he told a nationally televised news conference.
</P>
<P>
   Smith said his legislation offers an alternative to colleagues
who want to do something to allow the youthful shipwreck victim to
remain in Florida -- but don't want to impose U.S. citizenship on
him.
</P>
<P>
   The bill would give Elian the residency status immediately while
offering the same protection to his father and other Cuban
relatives should they come to the United States, Smith said.
</P>
<P>
   The full citizenship bill, by Mack, is also before Congress but
leaders in both chambers have made no moves to bring it to a vote.
</P>
<P>
   There was a lot of apparent enthusiasm for Mack's bill in early
January, but that faded after lawmakers learned Elian's family
situation was more complicated than initially thought, and polls
showed most Americans favored returning the boy to his father.
</P>
<P>
   Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott, R-Miss., will take ''a
serious look'' at the new proposal and decide whether it should be
scheduled for floor action, said Lott spokesman John Czwartacki.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Patrick Leahy of Vermont, the senior Democrat on the Senate
Judiciary Committee, said he sees no more support in Congress for
the ''permanent residency'' measure than for the original
citizenship bill.
</P>
<P>
   ''We have a youth who's been made a political pawn,'' said
Leahy. ''Just let the child be with his father.''
</P>
<P>
   The legislative activity came as the tug of war over Elian
intensified in Miami.
</P>
<P>
   In advance of a meeting between immigration officials and
Elian's Florida relatives, Miami-Dade County Mayor Alex Penelas
said the city would not offer any help -- including police resources
-- to help federal officials remove the child from his home.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton said, ''there is a legal process here. I have done my
best to avoid politicizing it. ... I think that the people on all
sides should accept the rule of the court.''
</P>
<P>
   About the Penelas' comments, Clinton said that when a decision
is made ''the rest of us ought to obey it.''

<HEADLINE> Mom Charged in Boy's Knife Incident  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   BATAVIA, N.Y. (AP) -- The mother of a kindergartner has been
charged with allowing her son access to the switchblade he
allegedly pulled on a 5-year-old girl as they waited in line for
lunch.
</P>
<P>
   Cindy Vaca, 25, was charged Monday with endangering the welfare
of a child and criminal possession of a weapon, said Timothy
Buckley, the officer assigned to the school.
</P>
<P>
   The 6-year-old boy found the switchblade knife on top of the
refrigerator at his home and pulled it on the girl on March 15,
Buckley said. It is illegal in New York to have a switchblade that
opens when a button is pushed on the handle.
</P>
<P>
   The boy was removed from class after the incident. A hearing is
pending to consider further disciplinary action.
</P>
<P>
   ''We're trying to handle this the best way we can. We've got to
take this stuff seriously,'' Superintendent Richard Stutzman said.

<HEADLINE> Ruling Hurts Nude Dancing Industry  </HEADLINE>
By LAURIE ASSEO, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Supreme Court made it easier for local
governments to ban nude dancing, the entertainment in about 3,000
adult clubs nationwide, ruling Wednesday that a performer's freedom
of expression can be restricted by forcing her to wear pasties and
a G-string.
</P>
<P>
   Nude dancing can be banned in an effort to combat crime and
other harms that adult entertainment clubs often attract, the
justices said in a splintered decision reinstating a public-nudity
ordinance in Erie, Pa.
</P>
<P>
   Such dancing is ''expressive conduct'' but it falls ''only
within the outer ambit'' of the Constitution's First Amendment
free-speech protection, Justice Sandra Day O'Connor wrote in the
court's main opinion.
</P>
<P>
   The ban promotes Erie's ''interest in combating the negative
secondary effects associated with adult entertainment
establishments,'' such as crime, and was not aimed at a dancer's
erotic message, O'Connor said.
</P>
<P>
   Although the court's rationale was divided, the decision is sure
to have broad impact. Nude entertainment is featured in about 3,000
adult clubs nationwide, the justices were told when the case was
argued in November.
</P>
<P>
   ''We're delighted,'' said Valerie Sprenkle, Erie's assistant
city solicitor. ''We didn't ban any expression.... What's being
regulated is the means of expression.''
</P>
<P>
   Sprenkle said dancers at a nude dancing club in the city ''will
be required to cover up to the extent required by the ordinance.''
</P>
<P>
   John H. Weston, attorney for the former Erie nude-dancing club
owner who challenged the ordinance, said the ruling may lead to a
flurry of attempts to ban nude dancing, but that ''sexually
oriented businesses will always thrive'' because of their
popularity.
</P>
<P>
   Weston said the ruling appeared to leave room for club owners to
force governments to ''defend their assumptions'' that such
establishments lead to crime.
</P>
<P>
   ''Everybody wants to put these businesses out of business,''
added Jim Waple, general manager of Archibald's, a Washington D.C.
nightclub that offers nude dancing two blocks from the White House.
''What crime does it cause? We don't have any drug dealers out
front. We don't have any prostitutes out front.''
</P>
<P>
   However, J. Robert Flores of the National Law Center for
Children and Families said, ''The Supreme Court has sent an
unmistakably clear message to those who exploit women and feed on
the lusts of men that the First Amendment does not provide a
license for immorality or illegality.''
</P>
<P>
   The ruling bolsters the effect of a 1991 Supreme Court ruling
that let Indiana ban all barroom-style nude dancing under a state
law generally prohibiting public nudity.
</P>
<P>
   That decision was badly splintered, however, and when the
Pennsylvania Supreme Court struck down Erie's ordinance, it said
the 1991 ruling offered little guidance.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday's ruling was divided too. The court voted 7-2 to allow
bans on nude dancing but voted 6-3 to reinstate the Erie ordinance.
</P>
<P>
   O'Connor said that even if the ordinance ''has some minimal
effect on the erotic message by muting that portion of the
expression that occurs when the last stitch is dropped, the dancers
... are free to perform wearing pasties and G-strings.''
</P>
<P>
   She compared the nude-dancing ban to a prohibition on burning
draft cards, which the Supreme Court upheld in 1968. In that case,
the government ''sought to prevent the means of the expression and
not the expression of antiwar sentiment itself,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Most of O'Connor's opinion was joined by Chief Justice William
H. Rehnquist and Justices Anthony M. Kennedy and Stephen G. Breyer.
</P>
<P>
   Justices Antonin Scalia and Clarence Thomas, in a separate
opinion by Scalia, voted to go further. They cited ''the
traditional power of government to foster good morals.''
</P>
<P>
   Justice David H. Souter wrote separately that he agreed with
O'Connor's rationale, but that the city needed to provide more
evidence that its ordinance was designed to deal with ''real
harms.''
</P>
<P>
   Justices John Paul Stevens and Ruth Bader Ginsburg dissented.
Stevens wrote for the two that the court had decided for the first
time that an effort to combat secondary effects such as crime ''may
justify the total suppression of protected speech.''
</P>
<P>
   While Souter was among the 7-2 majority in supporting a ban on
nude dancing, he voted with the minority, along with Stevens and
Ginsburg, against the 6-3 decision to reinstate Erie's specific
ordinance.
</P>
<P>
   The ordinance was ''aimed directly at the dancers in
establishments such as Kandyland'' and should be held ''patently
invalid,'' Stevens said.
</P>
<P>
   Erie's 1994 ordinance was challenged by Nick Panos, who used to
own the Kandyland nude-dancing club. He later sold the club to a
new owner, Joseph Cunningham, who closed it and opened a similar
club, Kandy's Dinner Theater, at a new location with a sign out
front that proclaims: ''First Amendment Rights Headquarters.''

<HEADLINE> Russian Colonel Arrested in Killing  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   MOSCOW (AP) -- A Russian colonel commanding a tank regiment in
Chechnya has been arrested in the killing of a Chechen woman,
Russian news reports said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   The Interfax news agency identified the colonel only by his
surname, Budanov. The RTR television channel cited Col. Gen.
Anatoly Kvashnin, chief of the Russian general staff, as saying the
woman was abused before she was killed.
</P>
<P>
   The reports gave no further details on the killing, including
where or when it took place.
</P>
<P>
   Russia has been under strong international criticism for alleged
human-rights violations in Chechnya, including reports of torture
and of summary execution of civilians.
</P>
<P>
   Officials have rejected most of the criticism, but Russia's
human-rights envoy to Chechnya, Vladimir Kalamanov, said Wednesday
that 130 cases have been opened against soldiers for alleged rights
violations.
</P>
<P>
   Kvashnin said the killing of the woman was ''brutish and
shameful'' and ''out of the ordinary,'' Interfax reported.

<HEADLINE> Elian Battle May Hurt Gore in Fla.  </HEADLINE>
By BRENT KALLESTAD, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   TALLAHASSEE, Fla. (AP) -- In a close presidential race, the
Cuban-American vote could be critical in Florida where the fate of
6-year-old Elian Gonzalez has angry Miami-area voters saying they
will unite behind Republican George W. Bush.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the 780,000 Cuban-Americans who live in the area are
furious at the Clinton administration for ordering the youngster's
return to Cuba. And the political fallout could be devastating for
Democrat Al Gore as President Clinton's vice president, whatever
his own views on the Gonzalez case.
</P>
<P>
   ''My position has always been that this is a custody matter for
the courts to decide based on due process, with a full hearing in
which all parties are heard,'' Gore said last week.
</P>
<P>
   Bush's stance: ''This case should be decided by a Florida family
court, which will protect the best interests of Elian, not by a
Clinton-Gore Justice Department whose record of putting politics
ahead of the law does not inspire confidence.''
</P>
<P>
   Florida generally votes Republican in the presidential election,
but Clinton won it in a three-way race in 1996, gaining 40 percent
of the Cuban-American vote -- unprecedented for a Democrat. That
result, coupled with Gore's strength among senior citizens, had
given the vice president hope for 2000 in the state with the
fourth-most electoral votes.
</P>
<P>
   For Gore, the political tightrope he must navigate stretches
well beyond Florida's Cuban-American community. Each of the 16
members of the Congressional Hispanic Caucus in Washington has
telephoned the White House to weigh in -- from all sides -- on the
Elian Gonzalez question.
</P>
<P>
   ''There have been two key events that made Cubans Republicans,''
said Dario Moreno, a political science professor at Florida
International University in Miami.'' There was the Bay of Pigs and
the 1978 dialogue between the Carter administration and Cuba.
</P>
<P>
   ''Elian Gonzalez has the potential to be the third,'' Moreno
said.
</P>
<P>
   The boy was found clinging to an inner tube off Florida on Nov.
25. His mother and 10 other people drowned when their boat capsized
during an attempt to reach the United States. The boy's father in
Cuba has asked for his return. Cuban President Fidel Castro has
made it a major issue.
</P>
<P>
   Florida was already going to be difficult for Gore and the
Democrats. Gov. Jeb Bush remains popular with voters across the
state and will do what he can to help his brother.
</P>
<P>
   Miami-Dade County Mayor Alex Penelas, a Gore supporter, says the
vice president is stuck in the middle.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's guilt by association and a lot of people think there is
more he should be doing,'' Penelas said Wednesday. ''The ultimate
responsible parties. though, are the president and Janet Reno.''
</P>
<P>
   The Cuban American National Foundation recently said it will
work against Gore's election. And, Moreno said, a significant
number of the 40,000 or so Cuban-Americans who are registered
Democrats are either changing party affiliation or will vote for
Bush.
</P>
<P>
   ''The Democratic Party is going down,'' said Ralph Medina, who
was at a rally this week outside the Little Havana home where the
boy is staying.
</P>
<P>
   Teresa Bequer, a 58-year-old registered Republican who came to
the United States from Cuba in 1961, voted for Clinton and Gore in
1996.
</P>
<P>
   ''That was the biggest mistake,'' she said. ''We need a strong
president who would fight against Castro.''
</P>
<P>
   Many Florida Democrats are also upset with the administration.
</P>
<P>
   ''They messed up this case from the beginning,'' said Attorney
General Bob Butterworth, who is Gore's campaign chairman in
Florida.
</P>
<P>
   However, Democratic Sen. Bob Graham of Florida said Gore ''has
done everything he could possibly do'' to spell out his position,
including a statement after the boy was picked up from the sea
''about his feeling that the issue should be resolved in what was
in Elian's best interest.''
</P>
<P>
   Cuban-Americans have not usually needed much extra reason to
vote Republican. Ronald Reagan won 88 percent of their votes as
recently as 1984.
</P>
<P>
   This year, said Moreno, ''If Republicans can get over 70 percent
of the Cuban-American vote it becomes difficult for Democrats to
win the state.''
</P>
<P>
   Jeb Bush said Wednesday his brother will do very well in the
Miami area, however the Gonzalez case turns out. ''But this should
not be a political issue.''
</P>
<P>
   He and Butterworth teamed up Wednesday to ask Attorney General
Reno, who is from Miami, to withdraw a Thursday ultimatum to the
boy's Florida relatives.
</P>
<P>
   ''We've put enormous pressure on the community of Miami by these
deadlines and requirements,'' Jeb Bush said. ''It's in the best
interests of this whole issue to let it depressurize a bit.''

<HEADLINE> Fla. Smokers Seek Compensation  </HEADLINE>
By CATHERINE WILSON, AP Business Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   MIAMI (AP) -- Three smokers with cancer deserve $14.4 million
from the the five biggest tobacco companies for their decades of
deceit about the dangers of cigarettes, the smokers' lawyer told a
jury Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   ''Let them now reap the consequences for the harm they have
caused good, decent people,'' attorney Stanley Rosenblatt said in
closing arguments in a landmark lawsuit that could be the gravest
threat to the tobacco industry yet.
</P>
<P>
   This is the nation's first class-action lawsuit by smokers to
reach trial, covering an estimated 500,000 sick Floridians.
</P>
<P>
   The jury already has ruled that the industry makes a dangerous
product. In the current phase, it is deciding whether to award
compensatory damages to three sick smokers. Later, there will have
to be mini-trials for each smoker who signs on as part of the
class.
</P>
<P>
   If the jury awards any compensatory damages, it will then be
asked to award punitive damages, which are intended to punish. The
industry fears a ruinous verdict of $300 billion.
</P>
<P>
   Tobacco attorney Dan Webb gave 25 minutes of what he said would
be a 13-hour industry reponse to the smokers' claims, promising
what he called ''reality checks'' to Rosenblatt's three days of
closing arguments.
</P>
<P>
   The jury is expected to begin deliberating next week.
</P>
<P>
   For now, the jury will be asked to assess the medical bills,
lost income, pain and suffering for the three smokers -- Mary
Farnan, who has lung cancer; Angie Della Vecchia, who died of lung
cancer; and Frank Amodeo, who has throat cancer. Their doctors
testified their cancer was caused by smoking.
</P>
<P>
   Rosenblatt said the cigarette companies for years hid the
dangers of smoking.
</P>
<P>
   ''You're lying to Mary, and Frank and Angie and millions of
other American smokers who are buying your product, which you spend
$5 billion a year on glamorizing and promoting and advertising and
hustling,'' Rosenblatt said.
</P>
<P>
   ''Get 'em hooked. You've got a customer for life,'' he said.
''Or until they get cancer, until they get heart disease or until
they can't smoke any more.''
</P>
<P>
   The industry has offered evidence that bronchioalveolar cancer --
a form of lung cancer that the jury decided is not linked to
smoking -- caused the women's cancer. It blamed industrial wood dust
as a possible cause of the throat cancer in the third.
</P>
<P>
   The defendants are Philip Morris Inc., R.J. Reynolds Tobacco
Co., Brown &AMP; Williamson Tobacco Corp., Lorillard Tobacco Co.,
Liggett Group Inc. and the industry's Council for Tobacco Research
and Tobacco Institute.

<HEADLINE> Buchanan Hopes To Inspire Voters  </HEADLINE>
By DENISE LAVOIE, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   TRUMBULL, Conn. (AP) -- Reform Party presidential candidate Pat
Buchanan expressed a desire Wednesday to follow John McCain's lead
in attracting voters to a maverick candidate.
</P>
<P>
   Buchanan said he thought he would have wide appeal in
Connecticut and other states where the Arizona senator won seven
Republican presidential primaries by running as a non-establishment
candidate before he withdrew from the race earlier this month.
</P>
<P>
   But he acknowledged that his conservative views probably would
not sit well with some voters.
</P>
<P>
   ''If you're a liberal Republican and you're doing very well,
you're probably not going to vote for Pat Buchanan,'' he said at a
news conference.
</P>
<P>
   Buchanan was in Connecticut as part of a four-day campaign swing
through New England, including a $100-per-person fund-raiser in
Stratford on Wednesday night.
</P>
<P>
   He said he would emphasize the ''re-industrialization'' of
America by opposing what he called unfair trade agreements with
China and Mexico that have sent American jobs overseas.
</P>
<P>
   Buchanan left the GOP last October after party leaders gave
their early endorsement to Texas Gov. George W. Bush, the likely
Republican presidential nominee.

Play Shows Battle vs. Alzheimer's   
An AP Entertainment Review, 
By MICHAEL KUCHWARA
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- The mental decline of Gladys Green, Greenwich
Village art gallery owner, longtime political activist and free
spirit, is not easy to watch.
</P>
<P>
   Yet it is a gallant struggle and a theatrical one, judging from
the success of ''The Waverly Gallery,'' Kenneth Lonergan's new
memory play that has the good fortune to star 81-year-old Eileen
Heckart as the indefatigable Gladys.
</P>
<P>
   Heckart, whose lengthy theater career has included such plays as
''Picnic,'' ''The Bad Seed'' and ''Butterflies Are Free,'' inhabits
the role with such authority that she lifts the already sturdy play
into the realm of something special.
</P>
<P>
   The actress, with her wide smile and gravelly voice, captures
the woman's tireless energy as she -- and her family -- battle
against the relentless, cruel progress of Alzheimer's disease.
</P>
<P>
   It's that fiercely personal fight that forms the heart of ''The
Waverly Gallery,'' on view at off-Broadway's Promenade Theater.
Despite its depressing subject matter, the evening never descends
into the maudlin.
</P>
<P>
   The play is narrated by Gladys' grandson, Daniel, a speechwriter
for the Environmental Protection Agency. The youth -- winningly
played by Josh Hamilton -- develops an ambivalent attitude toward
his grandmother's illness. Love and sorrow are mixed with a high
degree of exasperation as the old woman requires more and more
care.
</P>
<P>
   ''Her mind was smashed to pieces, and the person she used to be
hadn't really been around for a long time,'' he says in one of the
play's more poignant passages. ''But the pieces were still her
pieces.''
</P>
<P>
   Lonergan also chronicles the effect the disease has on other
members of the family, particularly Gladys' daughter, Ellen, played
with a quiet, almost angry despair by Maureen Anderman.
</P>
<P>
   Mother and daughter battle in what becomes a one-way war, with
only the offspring realizing that both women eventually will lose
in the end.
</P>
<P>
   The play begins with Gladys just beginning to slip into dotage.
She still runs the art gallery, although her only artist is a
hapless young man (a wonderful comic performance by Anthony Arkin)
who accidentally wanders into the place from a small town in
Massachusetts.
</P>
<P>
   Arguments erupt between Gladys and her kin, mostly around the
dinner table. There's a grim humor to these confrontations as the
old woman unintentionally irritates everyone around her. Ellen gets
jittery, nervous support from her second husband, portrayed
sympathetically by Mark Blum.
</P>
<P>
   Director Scott Ellis keeps the evening from descending into
sentimentality, even in the play's most emotional moment, when
Ellen and her son realize that they have to hang on to each other
to survive.
</P>
<P>
   Their realization only heightens Heckart's fearless performance,
making the character's slippage all the more poignant, particularly
after you catch glimpses of what this woman must have been like at
the height of her powers.
</P>
<P>
   One more thing. Watch Heckart at the curtain call. The
infirmities slip away, and there stands a radiant actress who in
''The Waverly Gallery'' has demonstrated a full command of her
craft.

<HEADLINE> NATO Moves Into Kosovo Boundary Zone  </HEADLINE>
By DANICA KIRKA, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) -- NATO peacekeepers crossed into the
no man's land just outside Kosovo's boundary for the first time
Wednesday -- a significant move aimed at checking reports of
Yugoslav military activity in the 3{-mile zone.
</P>
<P>
   About two dozen peacekeepers moved into the no man's land about
12 miles east of Pristina to search for evidence of a tank and an
armored personnel sighted Saturday. The fact-finding mission, led
by British Brig. Richard Shirreff, came after NATO's governing body
approved the move.
</P>
<P>
   Merely stepping into the zone is a significant step for NATO,
which has been patrolling Kosovo's administrative boundary with
Serbia proper with ever-increasing intensity in recent weeks.
Western governments are worried that cross-border tensions will
suck peacekeepers into another conflict.
</P>
<P>
   Both Kosovo and the region right across the border are
technically part of Serbia, the larger member of the Yugoslav
federation led by Slobodan Milosevic. But Kosovo, which has a
heavily ethnic Albanian population, has been under international
control since last year's conflict between ethnic Albanians and
Milosevic's Serb forces led to the NATO bombing.
</P>
<P>
   The presence of Yugoslav military forces in the safety zone
would break the agreement that ended NATO's 78-day bombing campaign
in Yugoslavia last year.
</P>
<P>
   There have been consistent reports of incursions into the zone
where Kosovo and Serbia proper meet. Usually it was unclear whether
those operating in the area were local police, which are permitted.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier sightings of activity, however, did not involve tanks.
The presence of even one would mark an escalation of tensions in an
already hot region.
</P>
<P>
   With a substantial contingent of peacekeepers looking on
Wednesday, Shirreff's group first traveled to a Serbian police
checkpoint, where they met a Serb delegation that accompanied them.
The peacekeepers took photographs and looked for indications that
undergrowth had been disturbed by tank tracks.

<HEADLINE> Nasdaq Off 189.22; Dow Ends Up 82.61  </HEADLINE>
By EILEEN GLANTON, AP Business Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Technology stocks tumbled for a third
consecutive session Wednesday, dragging the Nasdaq composite lower
and providing the only blemish on a broad-based advance by the Dow
Jones industrials.
</P>
<P>
   The technology-dominated Nasdaq composite index fell 189.22 to
close at 4,644.67. Seven Nasdaq stocks fell for every three that
rose.
</P>
<P>
   The Dow Jones industrial average rose 82.61 to close at
11,018.72.
</P>
<P>
   Broader stock indicators were mixed. The Standard &AMP; Poor's 500
rose 0.79 to 1,508.52. The Russell 2000 index, which measures the
performance of smaller companies, dropped 16.61 to 543.00.
</P>
<P>
   Investors once again collected profits from the recent rally in
high-tech stocks. Since the Nasdaq composite index reached its last
record high close on March 10, the index has fallen about 8
percent. Market watchers consider a decline of 10 percent a
correction, which signifies a downturn in a rising market but not
necessarily a long-term change.
</P>
<P>
   The Nasdaq's losses were exacerbated by sharp plunges from
companies like Redback Networks, down 25 11/16 to 263~, and eBay,
down 24 13/16 to 199. Both have risen significantly this year.
</P>
<P>
   Applied Materials fell 5\ to 96 13/16, Sun Microsystems lost 3{
to 97[ and Yahoo! fell 17 15/16 to 177 1/16. Dow component
Hewlett-Packard fell 6 13/16 to 133~.
</P>
<P>
   The profit-taking had gained momentum Tuesday, when Abby Joseph
Cohen, Goldman Sachs's chief investment strategist, said many
technology stocks are now fully valued and have little room for
further gains.
</P>
<P>
   ''There's some carryover concern that a lot of these stocks are
overvalued,'' said Barry Berman, managing director of equity
trading for Robert W. Baird &AMP; Co. in Milwaukee. ''So there's money
coming out of stocks that are highly priced relative to earnings
and into some groups that had been ignored for a long time.''
</P>
<P>
   Some of those sectors, analysts said, are pharmaceuticals and
retailers. Merck rose 2 7/16 to 64 and WalMart rose 4| to 59[.
</P>
<P>
   ''With a couple of days left in the quarter, there's some mutual
fund money still looking for a home,'' said Charles G. Crane, chief
market strategist at Key Asset Management in New York. ''There are
some outstanding bargains if you look in the right corners.''
</P>
<P>
   General Electric rose 7{ to 163{ after Prudential Securities
analyst Nicholas Heymann reiterated his ''strong buy'' rating on
the stock. Heymann also raised his 12-month price target to 210
from 185 and boosted his earnings estimate for this year to $3.75 a
share from $3.73.
</P>
<P>
   Also, oil stocks rose after OPEC oil ministers agreed on
production increases to boost the world's crude oil supplies.
Analysts forecast improved profit margins for oil companies,
helping the sector gain ground even as prices of crude oil tumbled
on world markets. Exxon Mobil rose 1 9/16 to 80 9/16.
</P>
<P>
   A flurry of new deals by AT&AMP;T dominated activity in the
telecommunications sector.
</P>
<P>
   AT&AMP;T rose 19/32 to 60\ in active trading a day after the company
revealed details of its long-awaited tracking stock for the
fast-growing wireless business. AT&AMP;T's offering, expected in late
April or early May, could raise as much as $13.25 billion and would
be the biggest initial public offering in U.S. history.
</P>
<P>
   AT&AMP;T helped buoy shares of Excite At Home, which rose 3] to 37
11/16. The company, a provider of cable Internet access, extended
distribution arrangements with AT&AMP;T through 2008. Also, AT&AMP;T
offered to buy out two of its partners in its relationship with
Excite At Home, giving Comcast and Cox Communications the right to
sell their Excite At Home shares to AT&AMP;T for a minimum price of 48
per share.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday marked the first anniversary of the Dow's first close
above 10,000. Since then, the blue-chip index has risen as much as
13 percent above the mark and has dipped back below it several
times. With Wednesday's advance, the Dow is about 10.2 percent
above 10,000.
</P>
<P>
   Advancing issues outnumbered decliners by a 6-to-5 margin on the
New York Stock Exchange, where composite volume totaled 1.28
billion shares, compared with 1.16 billion in the previous session.
</P>
<P>
   Overseas, Japan's Nikkei stock average rose 1.6 percent.
Germany's DAX index fell 0.9 percent, Britain's FT-SE 100 fell 0.8
percent, and France's CAC-40 fell 0.3 percent.

<HEADLINE> Putin Seeks Russia Mandate Extension  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   MOSCOW (AP) -- President Vladimir Putin asked the upper house of
parliament Wednesday to extend Russia's peacekeeping mandate in the
separatist Abkhazian region of Georgia, the ITAR-TASS news agency
reported.
</P>
<P>
   Russian peacekeepers have patrolled the mountainous region on
the Black Sea coast following a civil war in 1992-3, in which
ethnic Abkhazian militias won de facto independence.
</P>
<P>
   The Russian troops are acting under the auspices of the
Commonwealth of Independent States -- the alliance that replaced the
Soviet Union -- and are accompanied by United Nations observers, but
their mandate expires on June 30.
</P>
<P>
   In his letter to members of the Federation Council, Putin said
that Georgia has stalled talks on a more permanent security force
in the region and that Russia's troops are needed to defend ethnic
Abkhazians' rights.
</P>
<P>
   He said withdrawing Russian peacekeepers could further
destabilize the Caucasus region. To the northeast of Abkhazia in
the Caucasus Mountains, Russia is fighting a separatist movement in
Chechnya.
</P>
<P>
   The Caucasus region, a mountainous spine of land separating the
Black and Caspian Seas, has traditionally been an area of
overlapping interests of powerful countries, and in recent years
has taken on new significance as an important export corridor for
Caspian Sea oil.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Comments on Oscar Winner  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The movie ''American Beauty'' has a bloody
end, but President Clinton said Wednesday he didn't think the film
that won five Academy Awards last week glorified violence. ''If
anything, it was an anti-violence movie.''
</P>
<P>
   After the killings at Columbine High School in Littleton, Colo.,
in April 1999, Clinton urged Hollywood to re-evaluate the way it
portrays killing. He implored the entertainment industry to reflect
on its responsibility in molding the nation's youth.
</P>
<P>
   ''I still think there's too much gratuitous violence produced in
entertainment, but I don't think ... that's a fair criticism of
''American Beauty,'' Clinton told reporters at a news conference.
</P>
<P>
   The movie is about a suburban couple -- Kevin Spacey and Annette
Bening -- whose marriage has become a farce. Looking for new meaning
in his life, Spacey smokes pot with a neighbor kid, lusts after his
daughter's high school friend and tries unsuccessfully to cut
through the icy materialism that has possessed his wife, a real
estate agent. It ends in death.
</P>
<P>
   ''I thought it was an astonishing movie, actually. And I
certainly don't think anyone who watched it and understood it would
think of it as glorifying violence. I think it would be -- I think
a lot of the tragedy and fear that is behind people who misuse guns
would be apparent there. And so I think, if anything, it was an
anti-violence movie.''

<HEADLINE> Renowned Hedge Fund Closing  </HEADLINE>
By NOELLE KNOX, AP Business Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Julian H. Robertson Jr., one of the most
powerful money managers on Wall Street, is expected to announce
this week that he is closing Tiger Management, the investment
company he started 20 years ago, according to an investor.
</P>
<P>
   Just two years ago, the Tiger Management hedge fund family was
one of the largest in the world with $21 billion in assets. But
investors have bailed out in the wake of dismal results, leaving
the fund with about $6 billion in assets today.
</P>
<P>
   Robertson has made some bad bets of late. Instead of investing
in hot Internet or technology stocks, he has focused on undervalued
industrial or transportation companies, like US Airways and General
Motors.
</P>
<P>
   Tiger was down almost 14 percent through the first two months of
the year, about twice the decline suffered by the Standard &AMP; Poor's
500 index, which was down 7 percent.
</P>
<P>
   ''The guy is one of the best money managers in history,'' said
Alex Shogren, president and chief executive officer of
HedgeFund.net, an Internet news service for hedge funds. ''Value
investing just hasn't worked for anyone recently.''
</P>
<P>
   Hedge funds like Tiger are incorporated overseas and cater to
superrich individuals, universities, endowments and the like. Hedge
funds, which are largely unregulated, can make riskier investments
than mutual funds. For example, hedge funds often borrow huge sums
of money to pour into stocks, bonds, currencies and commodities.
</P>
<P>
   Over the lifetime of the company, Tiger is still up 25 percent
per year, after management fees. And Robertson's own wealth is
still impressive -- $1.5 billion of Tiger's assets are his.
</P>
<P>
   Robertson, born in North Carolina, described himself as a late
bloomer who got average grades in high school. He started his
career as a stock broker at Kidder Peabody in 1957 and later led
the company's money management division. He retired to New Zealand,
but hated the idle lifestyle. So, in 1980 he Founded Tiger with $8
million in capital, naming the firm after a suggestion from one of
his young sons.
</P>
<P>
   Rumors that Robertson, now 67, was liquidating his holdings
spread quickly Wednesday, though a company spokesman declined to
comment.
</P>
<P>
   The investor, who spoke on the condition of anonymity, said most
of Tiger's investors had not yet been told the company was closing.

<HEADLINE> Quotes About Elian Gonzalez Case  </HEADLINE>
By The Associated Press	   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ''This is a child, a 6-year-old child. How the INS and the
Justice Department got into the mess they got. ... It would've been
so much simpler to have had a custody hearing in state court to
deal with this.'' -- Florida Gov. Jeb Bush.
</P>
<P>
   ''Let's be clear: The real fault here lies with the oppressive
regime of Fidel Castro. Elian should never have been put in the
position of having to choose between freedom and his own father.
... We still need a full and fair court hearing based on due
process in a court of law according to the facts available about
what is in the best interests of the child.'' -- Vice President Al
Gore.
</P>
<P>
   ''I urge Attorney General Janet Reno to reconsider her plans to
send Elian back to Cuba, back to the place his mother died trying
to escape. This case should be decided by a Florida family court,
which will protect the best interests of Elian, not by a
Clinton-Gore Justice Department whose record of putting politics
ahead of the law does not inspire confidence.'' -- Texas Gov. George
W. Bush on March 23.
</P>
<P>
   ''If their continued provocation, in the form of unjustified
threats to revoke the boy's parole, leads to civil unrest and
violence, we are holding the federal government responsible, and
specifically Janet Reno and the president of the United States, for
anything that may occur in this community.'' -- Miami-Dade County
Mayor Alex Penelas.
</P>
<P>
   ''I also came to this land of freedom at 6. I remember clearly
about how the militia men would come while I was playing, asking me
if my parents were with Castro or not. I realized then the
sacrifice my parents made for me.'' -- Miami Mayor Joe Carollo.
</P>
<P>
   ''Mr. Coward Clinton -- Let Elian Stay here in freedom. Respect
his mother's last will.'' -- Sign held by 24-year-old Mario Medina,
who came to the United States four years ago and is not a citizen.
</P>
<P>
   ''We have a youth who's been made a political pawn. Just let the
child be with his father.'' -- Sen. Patrick Leahy of Vermont, the
senior Democrat on the Senate Judiciary Committee.
</P>
<P>
   ''It has been four months since Elian has been separated from
his father and lost his mother. It is time for this little boy, who
has been through so much, to move on with his life at his father's
side.'' -- Attorney General Janet Reno.
</P>
<P>
   ''In light of the attorney general's clearly articulated views
on the matter of whether Elian Gonzalez should return home, as well
as the reality that each passing day is another day lost between
Juan Gonzalez and his son, the court can only hope that those on
each side of this litigation place the interests of Elian Gonzalez
above all others.'' -- U.S. District Judge K. Michael Moore's March
21 ruling, dismissing a plea for an asylum hearing.

<HEADLINE> Board Warns of Plutonium Storage  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   RICHLAND, Wash. (AP) -- Bulging canisters of plutonium that could
rupture and leak have not been adequately monitored at the Hanford
nuclear reservation, an independent safety panel warns.
</P>
<P>
   The Defense Nuclear Facilities Safety Board contends Hanford
managers have pushed their luck at the Plutonium Finishing Plant,
where the canisters are stored.
</P>
<P>
   The canisters bulge when air mixes with the plutonium inside
what are supposed to be sealed stainless-steel containers. Rustlike
plutonium oxide forms on the plutonium metal, and the oxidation can
bend and crack the canister.
</P>
<P>
   In the past 10 years, two-thirds of the canisters -- the actual
number is classified -- have not been checked for the weight gains
that would indicate oxidation is occurring, according to a Feb. 25
defense board memorandum.
</P>
<P>
   Plutonium-laced emissions from a cracked container could
contaminate workers and the storage vault, creating possible health
hazards and delays in plans to convert 4.4 tons of scrap plutonium
into safer forms by mid-2004.
</P>
<P>
   The number of containers managers believe could crack is
classified.
</P>
<P>
   ''We're not finding anything so far that is causing us
extraordinary concern,'' said George Jackson, vice president for
nuclear materials stabilization at Flour Hanford, the main
contractor at the government site.
</P>
<P>
   Hanford was established as part of the secret Manhattan Project
to build an atomic bomb during World War II. Today, the mission at
the 560-square-mile site in southeast Washington state is cleaning
up the radioactive and hazardous waste created during 40 years of
plutonium production for the nation's nuclear arsenal.

<HEADLINE> Boys Accused of Plot To Kill Parents  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   MARTINEZ, Ga. (AP) -- Three young boys are accused of plotting to
drug their parents, take them hostage and execute them, authorities
said.
</P>
<P>
   Two brothers, ages 11 and 13, and another 11-year-old were
charged with theft of a firearm, aggravated assault and other gun
charges after the plot was uncovered Monday, said Columbia County
Sheriff Clay Whittle.
</P>
<P>
   According to the plans, the boys intended to drug both sets of
parents with sleeping pills, barricade them in ''holding cells''
and execute them, investigators said. The plans had swastikas drawn
on them and listed military-style ranks for each boy.
</P>
<P>
   The boys were to appear Thursday before a juvenile court judge.
</P>
<P>
   A search of the 13-year-old's bedroom turned up a .22-caliber
semiautomatic pistol, three ''commando'' knives, ammunition for
various guns and detailed drawings and plans of the plot in a
locked box, the sheriff said.
</P>
<P>
   A questionnaire that Whittle said the 13-year-old may have used
to recruit helpers asked, ''Do you feel like your parents treat you
like a slave?''
</P>
<P>
   The boys, whose identities were withheld because of their ages,
are being held in a youth detention center pending the hearing,
prosecutor Brian Bush said.
</P>
<P>
   Police learned of the plot Monday after the 14-year-old sister
of one 11-year-old found the three boys at home when they should
have been at school, Whittle said.
</P>
<P>
   The girl tried to phone her mother but her brother ''pulled a
handgun on her,'' Whittle said. She ran next door and called her
parents.

   The peace effort ''could serve as an example of what the
international community, with the full cooperation of the national
actors, could do with minimal resources,'' Undersecretary-General
Kieran Prendergast told the council.
</P>
<P>
   Guinea-Bissau's former president, Joao Bernardo Vieira, was
deposed last May by a breakaway military faction at the end of an
11-month conflict.
</P>
<P>
   Since late November, the former Portuguese colony has elected a
new legislature and president, Kumba Yala, in balloting which was
deemed free and fair.
</P>
<P>
   But the military junta that staged the May rebellion was never
dismantled. Yala last week offered five junta members posts as
junior government ministers. Prendergast said they have accepted.
</P>
<P>
   The council on March 10 approved keeping a small U.N. mission in
Guinea-Bissau until March 31, 2001, to support efforts to build
peace -- a contrast to the costly new peacekeeping missions it
recently approved in Sierra Leone and Congo.
</P>
<P>
   The U.N. budget committee recommended Tuesday that the General
Assembly approve Secretary-General Kofi Annan's request for $2.7
million to fund the political mission in Guinea-Bissau.
</P>
<P>
   The Security Council called on all sides to ensure that the new
army stay out of politics.
</P>
<P>
   Prendergast stressed the importance of demobilizing and
reintegrating ex-combatants into civilian life. He said the
economic situation ''remains worrying,'' noting that the government
still doesn't have money to pay long overdue salaries to soldiers
and civil servants.
</P>
<P>
   The Security Council urged donors to provide urgent assistance
for the government's 100-day transition program aimed at restoring
basic services such as water and electricity.
</P>
<P>
   The United States, which suspended aid after the coup last May,
is reviewing ways to restart assistance in trade and de-mining
efforts, said U.S. diplomat Mark Minton.

<HEADLINE> Two experts selected to monitor State Police  </HEADLINE>
By RALPH SIEGEL, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   TRENTON, N.J. (AP) -- Federal and state authorities have selected
a Texas law enforcement expert and a former federal prosecutor to
keep a close eye on New Jersey State Police in coming years.
</P>
<P>
   Both monitors will observe the patrol practices and inner
workings of the State Police to ensure that racially discriminatory
practices, which were acknowledged last year, are stopped.
</P>
<P>
   The team will file periodic reports with U.S. District Court
Judge Mary L. Cooper, who was assigned to enforce a legal
settlement of civil rights charges against the New Jersey State
Police.
</P>
<P>
   In a joint announcement Wednesday, Attorney General John Farmer
and Bill Lann Lee, head of the U.S. Division of Civil Rights, named
police expert James Ginger and Newark attorney Alberto Rivas as
monitors.
</P>
<P>
   The appointment closes a chapter on a difficult year for the
State Police, with two reports by Farmer's office about racial
profiling, internal discrimination and lackluster handling of
civilian complaints. These occurred in the shadow of the federal
civil-rights inquiry and the indictments of two troopers in a
shooting on the New Jersey Turnpike in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   But the appointment also marks the beginning of an era of
determining whether promises of reforms and accountability by the
State Police will be met.
</P>
<P>
   The civil rights division of the U.S. Justice Department began a
probe four years ago into the State Police regarding claims that
they stopped minority motorists on the New Jersey Turnpike on the
basis of their race.
</P>
<P>
   In December, Farmer signed a legal settlement with the Justice
Department agreeing to implement changes. Had that deal fallen
through, Justice Department lawyers would have proceeded with a
civil rights lawsuit against the Whitman administration and the
State Police.
</P>
<P>
   Cooper will monitor State Police compliance with the legal
settlement, using the Rivas-Ginger team as her eyes and ears.
</P>
<P>
   Ginger, an ex-cop and noted authority on police management, is a
consultant and professor at St. Mary's University in San Antonio.
He has worked at the national Police Foundation and other police
training and policy institutes.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. Justice Department has worked with Ginger before,
selecting him to conduct audits of the Pittsburgh police department
to monitor compliance with a similar legal settlement over civil
rights and police brutality concerns. Ginger did not return phone
messages Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Rivas, who is Hispanic, is a Princeton- and Rutgers-educated
lawyer who spent nine years as a prosecutor in the U.S. Attorney's
office in Newark, where Farmer also worked. Rivas said they knew
each other there.
</P>
<P>
   According to a legal document filed with Judge Cooper, Rivas
''conducted and supervised investigations of law enforcement
agencies.''
</P>
<P>
   Rivas would not comment about his appointment or the role of a
monitor, saying many details of how the team will proceed have yet
to be worked out. ''It is a significant issue and I appreciate the
confidence that both parties have expressed in me,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> Farmers Celebrate Peanut Month  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Peanut farmers Wednesday tested whether the
quickest way to a congressman's heart is through his stomach.
</P>
<P>
   March is National Peanut Month, and the Southeastern Peanut
Farmers Federation used the occasion to hold a luncheon for
lawmakers featuring celery with peanut butter and raisins,
chocolate-covered peanuts, peanut-butter candies mixed with jelly
beans, and various peanut butter sandwiches -- crunchy or creamy,
with jam, and on bread, toast or crackers.
</P>
<P>
   An Elvis impersonator passed out peanut butter-and-banana
sandwiches, a favorite of the real King.
</P>
<P>
   ''My dad raised me on the Bible,'' said Democratic Sen. Max
Cleland, who hails from the peanut-producing Georgia. ''He taught
me, 'Man cannot live by bread alone. He must have peanut butter.'''
</P>
<P>
   While peanut growers wanted to point out their product's good
taste and health benefits, they also were asking for help. They
want Congress to approve a $35 million bailout plan for peanut
growers.

<HEADLINE> De Leon Confirmed for Pentagon Post  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Senate on Wednesday confirmed Rudy de
Leon, a longtime senior civilian defense official, to the No. 2
spot at the Pentagon.
</P>
<P>
   De Leon, approved by voice vote, succeeds John Hamre as deputy
secretary of defense. Hamre, who managed the effort to rid Pentagon
computers of Y2K glitches, will become head of a major think tank.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton nominated de Leon earlier this month on the
recommendation of Defense Secretary William Cohen. De Leon has been
the Pentagon's undersecretary for personnel and readiness for the
past two years. He previously was undersecretary of the Air Force
and was an aide to the late Les Aspin when Aspin was defense
secretary in Clinton's first term.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Takes Campaign Finance Blame  </HEADLINE>
By SONYA ROSS, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Clinton said Wednesday that he was
appalled when he first learned that his campaign had taken illegal
foreign donations in 1996 -- contributions that he called both wrong
and unneeded. In a wide-ranging news conference, Clinton also urged
oil companies to quickly translate increased OPEC oil production
into lower prices at the gas pump.
</P>
<P>
   ''Right now, I think the prudent thing is to see how quickly
these prices can come down,'' Clinton said after welcoming the oil
producers' decision to fill a 2-million-barrel-a-day shortfall that
has led to a tripling of crude prices over the last 14 months.
</P>
<P>
   The president spent more than an hour before reporters in the
White House East Room, his second news conference this year. He
discussed serious matters -- New York police shootings, trade with
China -- and irreverent ones: the possibility of paternity leave for
British Prime Minister Tony Blair, and whether the five Oscars won
by the dark satire ''American Beauty'' means Hollywood is ignoring
his call to abandon violent images.
</P>
<P>
   ''I certainly don't believe that movie glorified violence,''
Clinton said. He even made light of Clinton-bashing television ads
by Charlton Heston, president of the National Rifle Association.
''I still think Charlton Heston's a great actor and I enjoy
watching his movies,'' Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
   The president said he was ''as appalled as the next person''
when he learned his 1996 campaign had accepted illegal
contributions from foreigners.
</P>
<P>
   ''We didn't need it to win, it was wrong, and we did everything
we could to try to correct it and set it right,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   He railed against a campaign finance system that requires
lawmakers to go out and raise cash, rather than devote that time to
passing laws or being with their families. ''It wears them out, and
I worry about them. I really believe that Congress would function
better if they didn't have to spend this much time (fund
raising),'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   On another political controversy, Clinton said he disagrees with
a federal judge's ruling that he committed a criminal violation of
the Privacy Act by releasing letters to cast doubt on the
credibility of former White House volunteer Kathleen Willey, who
accused him of a sexual advance.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton said he hadn't thought about violating Willey's privacy
-- he was merely trying to defend himself when he released her
letters after her accusations were lodged in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   ''It was the only way I knew to refute allegations that were
made against me that were untrue,'' Clinton said. ''I would not
have done it otherwise.''
</P>
<P>
   But oil supplies and prices were the day's recurrent theme.
Clinton said he doubts Congress would repeal the 4.3-cent-a-gallon
gasoline tax he helped push to passage in 1993. And he pressed
lawmakers to renew his authority over the oil stockpile in the
strategic petroleum reserve, which expires Friday, and to take up
his proposals for developing alternative fuels.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton said the OPEC agreement to increase production by 6.3
percent should bring down both home heating costs and gasoline
prices over the next few weeks.
</P>
<P>
   He sought to deflect criticism that he hasn't been aggressive
enough about energy conservation.
</P>
<P>
   ''Well, maybe not, but I've done a lot more than the Congress
has,'' he said. ''I have talked until I was blue in the face about
this for years.''
</P>
<P>
   The president also gave two nods to his vice president, Al Gore,
who is seeking to succeed him. He endorsed Gore's plan for a $7
billion ''democracy endowment'' to finance congressional campaigns,
and said he believes Gore, ''when he gets to be president,'' should
incorporate environmental and labor-standard requirements in the
trade deals he pursues.
</P>
<P>
   On other matters, Clinton said:
</P>
<P>
   --His proposal before Congress to allow China entry into the
World Trade Organization is ''a hundred-to-nothing deal for
America'' that, if ignored, would ensure that the rewards of open
trade go to Europe and Japan.
</P>
<P>
   --Congressional Republicans should ''stop the delay'' on his
legislative proposals for gun safety, Medicare reform, a
''patients' bill of rights,'' a minimum wage increase, school
construction and tobacco regulation.
</P>
<P>
   --Both Syria and Israel should develop ideas and resume talking
peace, especially since Syrian President Hafez Assad ''now knows in
great detail what the Israeli proposals were.''
</P>
<P>
   --Regardless of their ''personal chemistry,'' he hopes to have
the same type of warm relationship with new Russian President
Vladimir Putin that he had with Boris Yeltsin.
</P>
<P>
   --Declined to discuss the police shooting deaths of three unarmed
black men in New York City. His wife, Hillary, has made them an
issue against Mayor Rudolph Giuliani in their Senate campaign. With
better training policies and ''consistent'' effort, he said, crime
can fall and community relations improve.
</P>
<P>
   ''The two things are not inconsistent,'' Clinton said. ''I think
I should say no more, particularly in view of the latest incident,
which was tragic.''

<HEADLINE> Supreme Court Debates School Prayer  </HEADLINE>
By RICHARD CARELLI, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Prayer in public schools, for 40 years a
divisive and politically charged issue, split the Supreme Court
anew as the justices heard arguments Wednesday over letting
students lead stadium crowds in invocations at high school football
games.
</P>
<P>
   ''Where do we draw the line?'' asked Justice Stephen G. Breyer,
adding that the court must decide whether student-led prayers over
the public address system ''fall on the permissive side of the
line.''
</P>
<P>
   In comments and questions on a Santa Fe, Texas, school
district's now-suspended policy of allowing such prayers, Chief
Justice William H. Rehnquist and Justice Antonin Scalia were
clearly sympathetic to students' free-speech rights.
</P>
<P>
   But Justices David H. Souter and Ruth Bader Ginsburg repeatedly
portrayed the policy as a breach in the constitutionally required
separation of church and state.
</P>
<P>
   If the court's decision, expected by late June, were to follow
its ideological fault line, Justice Clarence Thomas would join
Rehnquist and Scalia; Justices John Paul Stevens and Breyer would
side with Souter and Ginsburg.
</P>
<P>
   The court's newest venture into this area of constitutional law
comes as an ABC News poll says two-thirds of Americans think
students should be permitted to lead such prayers.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this month in Texas' Republican primary, 94 percent of
voters approved a nonbinding resolution backing student-initiated
prayer at school sporting events. Texas Gov. George W. Bush, the
presumed Republican presidential nominee, filed a brief supporting
student-led prayer.
</P>
<P>
   In a written statement released after Wednesday's court session,
Vice President Al Gore, who's running for the Democratic
nomination, said allowing students to engage in voluntary
individual or group prayer is not only permissible, but worthy of
protection. ''Truly voluntary prayer should be allowed in school
but government sponsored violates our constitution,'' Gore said.
</P>
<P>
   As in many of the most divisive cases to confront the
nine-member court, the pivotal votes would belong to Justices
Anthony M. Kennedy and Sandra Day O'Connor.
</P>
<P>
   Both asked numerous questions Wednesday and appeared troubled by
a policy that allows student-elected representatives to give a
''message or invocation.''
</P>
<P>
   Kennedy worried aloud that such elections might result in
''schools becoming a forum for religious debates.''
</P>
<P>
   When Jay Sekulow, the school district's lawyer, said the policy
leaves the message up to the speaker, O'Connor interrupted to say
school officials had to be involved to ''bring about the selection
of the student by majority votes.''
</P>
<P>
   O'Connor also asked Texas Attorney General John Cornyn, who
defended the policy, whether his argument would allow classroom
student-led prayers. ''We have to look at the extended application
of this concept,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Cornyn said football games are different because they are
extracurricular.
</P>
<P>
   But Anthony Griffin, a lawyer from Galveston, Texas,
representing students and parents who challenged the policy, said
football games are ''part of the school system.''
</P>
<P>
   Putting himself in the place of a pro-prayer student, Griffin
said, ''I can pray before, after and even during the game. I don't
need the government's forum. I don't need an absolute right to take
over the microphone.''
</P>
<P>
   Sekulow emphasized ''the crucial difference between the state as
a speaker and a student as a speaker,'' adding, ''The student is
the circuit breaker here.'' And Cornyn warned the court about
''viewpoint discrimination'' against students who want their
message to be a prayer.
</P>
<P>
   But Souter challenged both, saying the school district policy
would require some captive students ''to sit there while a prayer
is going on.'' And he doubted aloud whether a student could give
the message that ''all religion is bunk.''
</P>
<P>
   When four students and their parents sued the Santa Fe
Independent School District in 1995, its policy called for election
of a student ''chaplain'' to lead ''prayers.'' The policy then was
changed to its current wording but it still let students lead
prayers at graduation ceremonies.
</P>
<P>
   A federal appeals court ruled last year that school officials
must tell students to keep their graduation-ceremony comments and
prayers ''nonsectarian and non-proselytizing'' but also ruled that
student-led prayers at high school football games are always out of
bounds.
</P>
<P>
   The Supreme Court chose to focus only on the football games,
passing up the graduation-ceremony dispute.
</P>
<P>
   Marian Ward, the Santa Fe senior who won a federal judge's
permission last fall to lead such prayers at her school's home
football games, attended the argument session.
</P>
<P>
   ''I feel like this country is founded on principles of ...
individual freedom,'' she said afterward. ''I'm not here to put
down other people ... but I still don't think that changes my right
to exercise free speech.''

<HEADLINE> Wednesday's Spring Training Roundup  </HEADLINE>
By The Associated Press	   The Cincinnati Reds and Pittsburgh Pirates found
their fifth
starters, forcing Mark Portugal and Pete Schourek to look for new
jobs.
<TEXT>
<P>
   Three days after announcing that Portugal was their fifth
starter, the Reds changed their minds and released him Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   The Pirates did the same to Pete Schourek, who thought he had
earned the No. 5 spot in Pittsburgh's rotation with a strong outing
a day before.
</P>
<P>
   The about-face stunned Portugal, rotation replacement Rob Bell
and a clubhouse full of teammates who thought the pitching staff
was set. Portugal's rough outing on Tuesday prompted general
manager Jim Bowden to change his mind.
</P>
<P>
   ''Bewildered is probably the best word I can come up with,''
right-hander Pete Harnisch said. ''Shocked is probably another
one.''
</P>
<P>
   Portugal had a 4.50 ERA when Bowden announced that he'd won the
fifth starter's job. His Tuesday outing raised it to 6.00, still
the second-lowest in a rotation that has struggled this spring.
</P>
<P>
   ''They didn't really get into some of the reasons, but I just
think the timing of it's kind of weird,'' Portugal said.
</P>
<P>
   Convinced that Schourek was no longer the pitcher who won 18
games for Cincinnati in 1995, the Pirates released Schourek and
gave rookie left-hander Jimmy Anderson the job.
</P>
<P>
   Only one day earlier, Schourek -- who is guaranteed $2 million --
seemed to have secured a spot in the rotation by limiting a
Minnesota split squad to two runs in six innings, his best start
this spring.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm confident I can pitch,'' said Schourek, 4-7 with a 5.34
ERA last season. ''They told me it was a numbers game. The $2
million apparently didn't mean anything.''
</P>
<P>
   Owner Kevin McClatchy gave general manager Cam Bonifay
permission to eat Schourek's contract if he and manager Gene Lamont
felt the Pirates were better with Anderson in the rotation.
</P>
<P>
   Their spring numbers were nearly identical. Schourek was 2-1
with a 5.40 ERA and eight strikeouts in 20 innings and Anderson was
3-1 with a 5.17 ERA and nine strikeouts in 15 2-3 innings.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm not real worried about the baseball side of it,'' Schourek
said. ''I thought I threw well this spring and worked out some
things I had problems with last season. I think I'll have a
productive season for somebody.''
</P>
<P>
   At Jupiter, Fla., Mark McGwire was removed with stiffness in his
back in the third inning of the St. Louis Cardinals' 3-1 win over
the Montreal Expos.
</P>
<P>
   McGwire was replaced by a pinch-runner after drawing a walk in
the third inning.
</P>
<P>
   ''He just said he felt achy all over and couldn't get loose,''
manager Tony La Russa said. ''He could have scored in the first
inning, but he said he just couldn't run well enough.''
</P>
<P>
   Outfielder J.D. Drew was hit on his right pinkie by a pitch from
Scott Strickland in the sixth inning. His status was uncertain.
</P>
<P>
   ''We'll know more in the morning,'' La Russa said. ''He seems to
be OK.''
</P>
<P>
   In other games:
Dodgers 7, Braves 2:
</P>
<P>
   At Kissimmee, Fla., Gary Sheffield hit a pair of home runs,
including a two-run shot off Greg Maddux, and drove in five runs.
Kevin Brown allowed one run and four hits in 4 2-3 innings, giving
up only a solo homer to Chipper Jones.
Orioles 8, Expos (ss) 2:
</P>
<P>
   At Fort Lauderdale, Fla., Mike Mussina allowed two runs over six
innings in his last start before opening day. Harold Baines went
3-for-3 with two RBIs.
Red Sox 4, Reds 3:
</P>
<P>
   At Sarasota, Fla., Pete Harnisch gave up three runs in six
innings, including an RBI single and a sacrifice fly by Nomar
Garciaparra, on the day Cincinnati picked him as its opening day
starter.
Indians 3, Astros 2:
</P>
<P>
   At Kissimmee, Fla., Dave Burba pitched five scoreless innings
and Jolbert Cabrera went 5-for-5 with an RBI.
Pirates 3, Blue Jays 1:

<HEADLINE> Poll: Corzine narrowing gap but Florio still leads in Senateprimary race  </HEADLINE>
By RALPH SIEGEL, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   TRENTON, N.J. (AP) -- A new poll has Jon Corzine narrowing the
gap on Jim Florio in the contest for the Democratic nomination for
the U.S. Senate, most likely because of heavy spending on
television ads.
</P>
<P>
   A Quinnipiac College Poll released Wednesday said 50 percent of
registered Democrats supported Florio and 26 percent supported
Corzine. The poll was conducted March 21 to March 27.
</P>
<P>
   It indicates that Corzine has narrowed a gap that was 35 points
in February, to 24 points now, cutting it by a third over four
weeks with about 10 weeks to go until Primary Day.
</P>
<P>
   Corzine, the former chairman of Goldman Sachs, is deploying his
personal fortune to build name recognition among Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   The Corzine campaign two weeks ago launched a pair of
commercials that have been running continuously on major network
affiliates at a cost of at least $1.5 million. Corzine could spend
$10 million or more just on the TV ad blitz if it is maintained
through the June 6 primary, as is expected.
</P>
<P>
   Quinnipiac political analyst Scott McLean said the strategy is
working, and that Corzine has hit a pace that will bring him even
with Florio in plenty of time for the June 6 vote.
</P>
<P>
   Michael Murphy, cochairman of the Florio campaign, agreed. He
said Corzine's gain ''is exactly what we expected.''
</P>
<P>
   ''At the end of the day, it is going to be a close race. A month
from now, I would expect to see that number narrow,'' Murphy said.
''Our theme has been over the last month or so that Jim Florio has
the experience that money can't buy.''
</P>
<P>
   The February and March polls sought the opinions of 400 people
identifying themselves as registered Democrats who said they
intended to vote. Both polls had a margin of error of 4.9
percentage points.
</P>
<P>
   The poll touched other points that both camps could seize upon.
</P>
<P>
   Most importantly, the Quinnipiac poll found Democratic voters
are not nearly as outraged over Corzine's wealth and his
willingness to use it as Florio would like them to be.
</P>
<P>
   Florio has made Corzine's spending a prime point in his
campaign, but the poll question on this issue found only 17 percent
of Democratic voters said big spending by a candidate would turn
them off.
</P>
<P>
   Among the rest, 53 percent said big spending did not matter or
they had no view about it, and 14 percent said heavy spending by a
wealthy candidate would actually improve his chance of getting
their vote.
</P>
<P>
   Oddly, though, the Quinnipiac poll found that while 26 percent
of the Democrats said they supported Corzine in a race with Florio,
on a separate question, only 23 percent of them said they actually
knew enough about Corzine to form any opinion. And among those with
an opinion about Corzine, only 11 percent regarded him favorably.
</P>
<P>
   How can the same poll give Corzine 26 percent of the vote but
only 11 percent approval?
</P>
<P>
   McLean said the explanation is plain enough: Some voters will
simply vote against Florio no matter who the opponent is.
</P>
<P>
   Regarding experience, 67 percent of the Democrats said they felt
that political experience was more important than business
experience in selecting a nominee. Only 21 percent said business
experience mattered more.
</P>
<P>
   But McLean said other questions on favorability showed that 35
percent of those who were either Republicans or Democrats had an
unfavorable view of Florio, and that among male respondents the
disapproval rating jumped to 42 percent.
</P>
<P>
   ''That is going to be a hard number for (Florio) to overcome,''
McLean said.

<HEADLINE> Ex-Prison Director Killed in Mexico  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   MEXICO CITY (AP) -- A former prison director under investigation
for alleged mismanagement was gunned down by unknown assailants a
little more than a month after he resigned his post, authorities
said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Mario Dominguez Gonzalez was shot at least 11 times Tuesday by
two assailants who had forced his car to a stop along a highway in
the Pacific coast state of Sinaloa, the state attorney general's
office said.
</P>
<P>
   The shooters escaped. Authorities said they were still
investigating possible motives in the killing. Sinaloa has been
plagued by drug-related violence. A friend who was accompanying
Dominguez was wounded.
</P>
<P>
   Dominguez, 58, was director of the high-security state prison in
Culiacan from Jan. 1, 1999, until about 40 days before his death,
the authorities said.
</P>
<P>
   He resigned as the state attorney general's office investigated
him for alleged mismanagement.

<HEADLINE> Mich. St. Students Rally for Team  </HEADLINE>
By DEE-ANN DURBIN, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   EAST LANSING, Mich. (AP) -- As they gathered for a rousing
send-off Wednesday in the gym where Magic Johnson used to play,
Michigan State fans were confident the school will see its first
NCAA championship since Johnson played for the school.
</P>
<P>
   ''We plan on bringing back a national championship,'' coach Tom
Izzo told hundreds of cheering students during a send-off rally
Wednesday evening shortly before the team departed for the NCAA
tournament Final Four at Indianapolis.
</P>
<P>
   ''You've been behind us this whole time,'' said guard Mateen
Cleaves, one of the seniors who spoke to the crowd. ''I just want
to ask you to stay behind us two more times.''
</P>
<P>
   The Spartans face Wisconsin on Saturday afternoon in the
semifinals. Their confidence is understandable: Michigan State has
beaten Wisconsin three times this season and is playing in its
second consecutive Final Four.
</P>
<P>
   Team members threw miniature green-and-white basketballs into
the crowd as they strode onstage. Izzo and Michigan State president
Peter McPherson praised students for their support of the team.
</P>
<P>
   ''I just want to tell you that we've tried to represent the
school as best we could,'' Izzo said.
</P>
<P>
   Joe Acker, a sophomore studio art major, spent the afternoon
making a large charcoal drawing of Cleaves. Acker, 20, could barely
contain his excitement as he boosted the drawing into the air.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm screaming like a little schoolgirl,'' he said. ''My
prediction is Florida and us, and we're taking 'em.''
</P>
<P>
   Mark Nicholson, 22, a senior trumpet player with the team's pep
band, said he's certain the team will win this year despite last
year's loss in the Final Four.
</P>
<P>
   ''They're all seniors, and this is their year,'' said Nicholson,
a history major from Detroit.
</P>
<P>
   The rally lasted about 45 minutes, with the pep band playing the
school fight song, cheerleaders performing and the crowd waving
green and white pompoms. After the rally the team boarded a bus and
headed to the airport for the flight to Indianapolis.
</P>
<P>
   Even when non-Michigan State fans were asked about the Spartans'
chances, most Michigan residents were optimistic. A poll of 600
Michigan residents released Wednesday indicated that 60 percent
expect the Spartans to win the NCAA title, Lansing-based Marketing
Resource Group said.

<HEADLINE> Bush Keeps Focus on Education  </HEADLINE>
By GLEN JOHNSON, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEWARK, N.J. (AP) -- George W. Bush, reaching out to women and
political moderates, kept up his focus on education Wednesday and
suggested that support for abortion rights wouldn't necessarily
disqualify any potential running mate.
</P>
<P>
   Bush, the expected Republican presidential nominee, toured a
charter school that he said showed how his proposal for
alternatives to failing schools could work. New Jersey Gov.
Christie Whitman, mentioned by some as a possible vice presidential
choice, accompanied him.
</P>
<P>
   While saying he had not made any running mate lists, Bush spoke
warmly of Whitman when reporters asked about her chances, even
though he opposes abortion and she favors abortion rights.
</P>
<P>
   ''Good people can disagree on the issue, and I understand that
and I'm standing here with a friend of mine,'' Bush said after he
and Whitman toured the North Star Academy, an inner-city charter
school with a 700-child waiting list.
</P>
<P>
   ''We disagree on some aspects of the issue,'' Bush added. ''That
doesn't mean we can't be pulling for the same thing, being on the
same team, and I respect Governor Whitman's views and I respect her
as a person.''
</P>
<P>
   The Texas governor's comments on abortion and his focus this
week on education were part of his move back toward the political
center after a bitter Republican primary campaign in which some
analysts believe he moved too far right.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday, Bush rolled out a $5 billion reading initiative. On
Thursday in Wisconsin, Bush plans to promote teacher recruiting and
retraining.
</P>
<P>
   Bush started his day Wednesday by having breakfast with
Archbishop Theodore McCarrick, the Roman Catholic head in Newark.
During the primary campaign, Bush was criticized for speaking at
Bob Jones University, a South Carolina school whose leaders have
embraced anti-Catholic views.
</P>
<P>
   In the last two elections, the GOP has been plagued by a gender
gap, the trend for men to support Republicans and women to support
Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   In recent polls, Vice President Al Gore, the likely Democratic
nominee, is running only several percentage points ahead of Bush
among women, however, while the Texas governor is out polling Gore
among men by about one dozen percentage points.
</P>
<P>
   Gore campaign spokesman Doug Hattaway said Bush would not fool
anyone about his stance on the issue by picking an abortion right
supporter to be his vice presidential candidate.
</P>
<P>
   ''His record is staunchly anti-choice and he would be an
anti-choice president no matter who he picks as a running mate,''
Hattaway said.
</P>
<P>
   Steve Salmore, a Republican political analyst from New Jersey,
said Whitman would be an unlikely choice for Bush because her
pro-abortion views could inflame internal conflict.
</P>
<P>
   ''She has become a symbol for many people of the pro-choice
Republicans. I think it would make that issue a major issue of
division at the convention, and I don't think George Bush needs
that,'' Salmore said.
</P>
<P>
   Chuck Donovan, who replaced former GOP presidential candidate
Gary Bauer as head of the Family Research Council, said in a
statement ''it is common practice for guests to compliment their
hosts.''
</P>
<P>
   But Donovan also delivered an implicit warning to Bush, saying
that when presidential candidates pick running mates they ''send a
strong signal to the American people about whether they are serious
about defending the most defenseless members of the human family,
our unborn children.''
</P>
<P>
   Abortion-rights supporters were quick to pounce on Bush.
</P>
<P>
   Kate Michelman, president of the National Abortion and
Reproductive Rights Action League, said Bush is ''madly to try to
reposition himself from being out on the right-wing,'' but it won't
work.
</P>
<P>
   ''Christie Todd Whitman is not going to change the reality that
George W. Bush is a threat to women's constitutional and legal
right to reproductive choice -- no matter what he says,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Whitman, campaigning with Bush on Tuesday and Wednesday in New
Jersey, twice introduced him by saying his compassionate
conservative philosophy ''transcends litmus tests.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush, calling Whitman a friend, said, ''I can't wait to campaign
with her, not only in the state of New Jersey but all around
America.''
</P>
<P>
   The two served as co-chairmen of the 1996 Republican National
Convention.
</P>
<P>
   Touring the North Star Academy, Bush watched math students doing
academic calisthenics, racing through addition tables and answering
questions such as what is a quadrangle.
</P>
<P>
   ''This charter school shows that all children can learn, and I
resent those who stand in the way of education reform, those who
say that giving parents different options if they're dissatisfied
with the status quo isn't right,'' Bush told students clad in polo
shirts and khakis.
</P>
<P>
   Whitman signed legislation in 1996 paving the way for North
Star, the first charter school in the state.
</P>
<P>
   Both Bush and Gore back charter schools, created by a group of
teachers, community members or parents. They operate free of most
state laws and regulations but must be approved by a local
chartering authority after outlining educational goals, procedures
and standards.
</P>
<P>
   Later Wednesday, Bush held a private reception with New York
Gov. George Pataki, then spoke at a $500,000 fund-raiser in New
York that also was attended by Mayor Rudolph Giuliani.

<HEADLINE> Ky. Senate OKs Ten Commandments Bill  </HEADLINE>
By BRUCE SCHREINER, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   FRANKFORT, Ky. (AP) -- The Ten Commandments could be displayed in
schools and on Statehouse grounds under a measure passed Wednesday
by the Kentucky Senate that now heads to the governor.
</P>
<P>
   The legislation urging public schools to post the code in
classrooms passed 33-2.
</P>
<P>
   A spokesman for Gov. Paul Patton said until the governor had a
chance to review the legislation, it was premature to comment on
whether he would sign it.
</P>
<P>
   ''Generally, when a strong majority approves such a measure, he
(the governor) is inclined to accept it as public policy,''
spokesman Mark Pfeiffer said.
</P>
<P>
   If it becomes law, the measure will likely provoke another legal
fight in Kentucky on the posting of the religious commandments in
public buildings.
</P>
<P>
   The measure also requires that a large monument of the Ten
Commandments be taken out of storage and placed outside the
Capitol.
</P>
<P>
   Jeff Vessels, executive director of the American Civil Liberties
Union in Kentucky, said the group would challenged the move.
</P>
<P>
   ''Our belief is that the monument would represent government's
promotion of religion, which is forbidden by the First Amendment,''
Vessels said.
</P>
<P>
   The 7-foot-high monument was donated to the state by the
Fraternal Order of Eagles in 1971. It stood in an obscure corner of
the Capitol grounds until the late 1980s when it was removed to
make room for the Capitol complex's heating and cooling plant.
</P>
<P>
   The proposal also urges schools to teach about the influence of
Christianity on this country.
</P>
<P>
   The measure says documents depicting the Ten Commandments may be
posted in classrooms and on public property as part of ''an
historical display along with other historical documents.'' No
specific religion or faith is mentioned.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Albert Robinson, a Republican, said the commandments would
be used as a historical document, not for religious purposes.
</P>
<P>
   ''I see no controversy in this,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Vessels expressed reservations about the school postings.
</P>
<P>
   ''We will have to wait and see what happens with local
implementation if it becomes law, and challenge specific postings
as they occur,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The ACLU has sued Harlan County schools for posting commandments
in each school building. It sued Pulaski County and McCreary County
for posting commandments in their schools and courthouses as signs
of support.

<HEADLINE> Tennessee-Martin Players Injured  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   LAMAR, Miss. (AP) -- A van carrying nine members of the
Tennessee-Martin baseball team ''disintegrated'' after colliding
with a tractor-trailer early Wednesday. The coach and two players
were in critical condition.
</P>
<P>
   The crash occurred around midnight, 45 miles east of Memphis,
Tenn. Three university vans were about 100 miles from home after an
8-5 victory at Mississippi in Oxford.
</P>
<P>
   Coach Victor ''Bubba'' Cates, 40, was driving the lead van,
which was hit by the truck driven by James L. Leonard Jr. The
driver for Specialty Feeds Inc. of Memphis, Tenn., was not hurt.
</P>
<P>
   Players David Tillman and Jason Alford were hospitalized in
critical condition, and four others had lesser injuries.
</P>
<P>
   ''From indications we've received from Mr. Leonard and people on
the van, the van had stopped but apparently pulled out in front of
the 18-wheeler,'' said Sgt. H.L. Kitchens, spokesman for the
Mississippi Highway Patrol. ''The van completely disintegrated,
throwing the people out.''
</P>
<P>
   The van occupants were wearing seat belts, Kitchens said.
</P>
<P>
   Player Paul Slack told his mother that the truck hit the van,
spinning it and turning it on its side. He viewed the accident from
another van that wasn't hit.
</P>
<P>
   ''He said it could have been much worse if the trucker hadn't
tried to avoid the van,'' Linda Stack told radio station WCMT in
Martin, Tenn. ''He commended the driver for helping get the injured
players out and covering them up.''
</P>
<P>
   Other drivers stopped to help the injured players, covering them
with blankets, Linda Slack said.
</P>
<P>
   Cates will be issued a citation for failing to yield the right
of way in connection with the accident, said Capt. Johnny Kerr of
the Mississippi Highway Patrol.
</P>
<P>
   Cates, Tillman and Alford were being treated at Regional Medical
Center in Memphis.
</P>
<P>
   Doctors removed Cates' spleen and repaired a punctured lung. His
injuries did not appear to be life-threatening, Martin spokesman
Bud Grimes said.
</P>
<P>
   The injuries sustained by Tillman and Alford were not released.
Alford, 23, is from Bradford, Tenn. Tillman, 20, is from Waverly,
Tenn.
</P>
<P>
   ''People are generally shocked and saddened by what has
happened,'' Grimes said. ''At the same time, everyone I come in
contact with is very grateful there were no fatalities. We are also
encouraged that the updates we're hearing on coach Cates are very
favorable.''
</P>
<P>
   Students and faculty at the 5,700-student university planned to
sign an oversized card during lunch to send to the victims, Grimes
said. Athletes with other Tennessee-Martin teams on the northwest
Tennessee campus planned to tie ribbons on a fence to show their
support.
</P>
<P>
   Two players -- Curtis Wooten, 20, of Memphis and Billy Holt, 21,
of Bartlett, Tenn. -- were treated and released from Regional
Medical Center. Hospitalized in fair condition there were Dan
Stephens, 20, of Clarksville, Tenn.; Michael Roof, 20, of Paducah,
Ky.; and Adam Green, 18, of Cordova, Tenn. Adam Gibson, 20, of
Louisville, Ky., was upgraded Wednesday from fair to satisfactory
condition.
</P>
<P>
   Player Lanier English was at Jackson-Madison County Hospital in
his hometown of Jackson, Tenn. English, 20, injured his hand and
was listed in fair condition.

<TEXT>
<P>
   BELLE GLADE, Fla. (AP) -- A father fired a gun in a busy high
school parking lot Wednesday at a student who had had a fight with
his 16-year-old son over a hat, authorities said.
</P>
<P>
   No one was injured in the 2:45 p.m. shooting at Glades Community
High School, Palm Beach County School Police Chief Jim Kelly said.
</P>
<P>
   Artis Harwick Jr., 42, was arrested and charged with armed
trespass, possession of a firearm on school property, aggravated
battery, reckless display of a firearm and discharge of a firearm
in public, Kelly said.
</P>
<P>
   Harwick's 18-year-old son, a senior at the school, has been
charged with aggravated battery. The son returned to the campus
with his father to point out the boys who allegedly had fought with
his 16-year-old brother, Kelly said.
</P>
<P>
   The 16-year-old also faced an aggravated battery charge, Kelly
said.
</P>
<P>
   Kelly said the violent exchange was spawned earlier in the day,
when classmates took the 16-year-old's hat. After retrieving the
hat, he allegedly was attacked by three teens.

<HEADLINE> Tokyo Sstocks Fall  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   TOKYO (AP) -- Tokyo stocks fell moderately early Thursday
following declines in technology issues on Wall Street. The dollar
was lower against the yen.
</P>
<P>
   The benchmark 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average shed 105.82 points,
or 0.51 percent, to 20,600.83 in the first 30 minutes of trading.
On Wednesday, the average closed up 332.31 points, or 1.63 percent.
</P>
<P>
   The dollar bought 105.68 yen, down 0.34 yen from late Wednesday
in Tokyo and also below its late New York level of 105.81 yen.
</P>
<P>
   On the stock market, the Nikkei average started lower after the
technology-rich Nasdaq composite index lost 189.22 to 4,644.67 at
Wednesday's close in New York.
</P>
<P>
   Some investors also locked in profits after the Nikkei rose over
the past four consecutive trading days, traders said.
</P>
<P>
   In currency dealings, the dollar slipped against the yen
following weakness in New York, where the greenback was hurt by a
stronger-than-expected increase in Japanese industrial production
for February.
</P>
<P>
   The latest data suggested parts of Japan's ailing economy may be
moving toward recovery.
</P>
<P>
   Also on Wall Street, the Dow Jones industrial average closed at
11,018.72 on Wednesday, up 82.61.
</P>
<P>
   In other currencies, the euro was traded at 100.67 yen, down
from 101.64 yen late Wednesday in Tokyo.
</P>
<P>
   The broader Tokyo Stock Price Index of all issues listed on the
first section was up 2.98 points, or 0.17 percent, to 1,735.82. The
TOPIX closed up 52.08 points, or 3.1 percent, the day before.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Megan's Law amendment to constitution a bold but possibly flawedtactic  </HEADLINE>
By RALPH SIEGEL, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   TRENTON, N.J. (AP) -- New Jersey Republicans are proposing to
amend the state constitution to clear the way for the enactment of
a tougher version of Megan's Law.
</P>
<P>
   Their idea is to post sex-offender notifications on the Internet
and to provide them in the mail to anyone who asks.
</P>
<P>
   This breaks sharply with the current procedure of notifying only
those who live near sex offenders in carefully defined
neighborhoods.
</P>
<P>
   Legislation for the Internet version of Megan's Law has been
introduced, but Gov. Christie Whitman and other Republicans said
this week they believe a change in the New Jersey Constitution is
needed first to make sure the Internet law is not rejected by the
state Supreme Court.
</P>
<P>
   Whitman's amendment is designed to make it clear that convicted
sex offenders who have preyed on children in the past, and who pose
a risk of doing it again, have no privacy rights.
</P>
<P>
   Changing the constitution to negate holdings of the court is the
ultimate form of political brinksmanship between the branches of
government.
</P>
<P>
   ''It is an outrageously wrong-headed idea that the New Jersey
Legislature should propose a constitutional amendment every time
they disagree with an interpretation of the Supreme Court,'' said
lawyer John Gibbons. ''For the Legislature to take on the court on
a civil rights or human rights issue is, I think, really bad
politics.''
</P>
<P>
   Gibbons represented the American Civil Liberties Union in 1995
when Megan's Law was argued before the Supreme Court.
</P>
<P>
   He also has served as chief judge of the 3rd U.S. Circuit Court
of Appeals in Philadelphia and has seen countless cases of
lawmakers trying to intimidate judges. He claims he never saw one
such effort succeed. ''It is more a show for the public,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   This could be more true of Whitman's amendment idea.
</P>
<P>
   On civil liberties matters such as the right to privacy or the
right to be free of government intrusion, state judges from the
county courthouse to the Supreme Court often use the federal Bill
of Rights in rendering decisions.
</P>
<P>
   The late Chief Justice Robert Wilentz in the 1995 ruling that
upheld Megan's Law wrote about privacy.
</P>
<P>
   ''Grounded in the Fourteenth Amendment's concept of personal
liberty, the right of privacy safeguards at least two different
kinds of interests: the individual interest in avoiding disclosure
of personal matters, and the interest in independence in making
certain kinds of important decisions.''
</P>
<P>
   Wilentz concluded that Megan's Law had to be in balance with a
person's right to privacy, whatever their past crimes. He said the
balance could be maintained if notification about sex offenders was
done carefully.
</P>
<P>
   ''Thus, we conclude, under both the state and federal
constitutions, that neither the registration, nor the notification
law, violates the right to privacy,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Megan's law was initially affirmed in February 1995 by a judge
in Burlington County, Harold B. Wells, who also cited federal law.
Wells compared sex offender notifications to federal court rulings
to allow government agencies to issue warning lists about firms
convicted of Medicaid fraud.
</P>
<P>
   Gibbons said no one can be surprised to find federal citations
by New Jersey judges. ''State judges are obliged to do it,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   So what does this imply, should an effort succeed to insert a
new phrase into the New Jersey Constitution?
</P>
<P>
   ''There is a major difficulty with it. The constitutional
pronouncements with respect to privacy have come not only from the
New Jersey courts but from the federal courts relying on the
federal Constitution. An amendment of the New Jersey Constitution
will have no effect at all on what is already well established in
(rulings over) privacy,'' Gibbons said.
</P>
<P>
   Wilentz concerned himself with a Megan's Law program that has
authorities going door-to-door distributing information. The
Internet bill ventures into new legal territory.
</P>
<P>
   But there is a common thread: the privacy of a person's home
address.
</P>
<P>
   Privacy seems like a recent legal issue regarding Megan's Law,
but this is only because the privacy aspect of Wilentz's 1995
decision is usually overlooked.
</P>
<P>
   After citing a case by the U.S. Supreme Court, Wilentz said,
''We believe that public disclosure of (an offenders) home address
does implicate privacy interests. ... We are reluctant to disparage
the privacy of the home, which is accorded special consideration in
our constitution, laws, and traditions.''
</P>
<P>
   No state constitutional amendment can rewrite that conclusion.

<HEADLINE> Report: Kidnappings Need Attention  </HEADLINE>
By GEORGE GEDDA, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The U.S. government needs to respond more
aggressively to the overseas abduction of American children because
in only about 24 percent of the cases are the children returned or
are ''left behind'' parents granted visitation rights, according to
a congressional report.
</P>
<P>
   The report by the General Accounting Office, the investigative
arm of Congress, also concluded that there are gaps in federal
services to left behind parents that make it difficult for them to
recover their abducted children.
</P>
<P>
   Under the Hague Convention of 1980, signatory countries are
required to secure the prompt return of children wrongfully removed
to or retained in another member country. According to State
Department estimates, about 1,000 children are abducted from the
United States each year.
</P>
<P>
   In most cases, the abductions are carried out by foreign-born
spouses who depart the United States and travel to their native
lands. The report said there were 2,347 abductions from May 1997 to
December 1999 that were looked into by federal authorities. Of this
figure, 1,199 cases have been closed.
</P>
<P>
   In 503 cases, involving signatories and non-signatories to the
Hague Convention, the child was returned to the United States and
in 50 cases, the left behind parent was granted access, the study
said.
</P>
<P>
   The report found that the Justice Department has made only
limited use of a 1993 law which allows criminal prosecution of
abducting parents. Since then, the Justice Department has indicted
62 parents under the act and obtained 13 convictions.
</P>
<P>
   ''Left-behind parents believe that Justice has not used this law
sufficiently to prosecute parents who abduct children from the
United States,'' the report said.
</P>
<P>
   In response to complaints about its performance, the State
Department, according to the report, said it has to deal with
''foreign governments and judicial systems that make it difficult
if not impossible to acquire the abducted children.''
</P>
<P>
   The report also noted that neither the State nor Justice
Departments provide sufficient financial assistance to offset
left-behind parents' costs.
</P>
<P>
   ''Securing the return of adducted children can entail
significant expenses,'' the study said. ''For example, left behind
parents usually need to travel abroad, retain a lawyer and pay
other fees.''
</P>
<P>
   A May 1999 State Department report on compliance with the Hague
Convention identified Austria, Honduras, Mexico and Sweden as the
most serious violators.
</P>
<P>
   The issue of parental abduction has been attracting
congressional attention lately.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, House members introduced a resolution that seeks to
help parents who have been cut off from their children because
foreign courts fail to recognize U.S. custody orders.
</P>
<P>
   ''Children belong with their natural parents and they belong in
the country of their citizenship,'' Rep. Nick Lampson, D-Texas,
said.
</P>
<P>
   Lampson pledged to use any opportunity to embarrass offending
countries, if necessary, ''point the finger, call the names of
Germany and Sweden, anyone else that is not living by the
agreement.''

<HEADLINE> Pillsbury Eliminating 750 Jobs  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   MINNEAPOLIS (AP) -- The Pillsbury Company announced Wednesday it
is eliminating about 750 positions and will focus on its expertise
in dough-based foods.
</P>
<P>
   ''We know dough,'' said Pillsbury president and chief executive
officer John Lilly, ''and we want to leverage that expertise in a
significant way to win in the marketplace. To accomplish this, we
are changing how we approach our dough businesses from research and
development to how we market to the consumer.''
</P>
<P>
   Pillsbury will also completely redesign its packaged goods sales
approach in North America, the company said in a news release.
</P>
<P>
   The company has announced an alliance with Dallas-based
Crossmark, a national food broker. Crossmark will offer positions
to many Pillsbury field sales people, Pillsbury said.
</P>
<P>
   Lilly also said the alliance with Crossmark will allow Pillsbury
products to be sold in a greater variety of stores.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is a very significant change for Pillsbury,'' Lilly said.
''Not in terms of the number of jobs affected, but rather in how
the company will be organized, how we operate internally and how we
move more innovation to the marketplace. We want to win in our
categories, and this will get us there.''
</P>
<P>
   Pillsbury employs 17,500 people worldwide. The company is the
packaged food division of London-based Diageo and sells food under
the Pillsbury, Green Giant, Haagen-Dazs, Progresso and other
labels.

<HEADLINE> House Refuses To Cut Colombia Bill  </HEADLINE>
By ALAN FRAM, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The House refused Wednesday to slash a planned
$1.7 billion for battling drug lords in Colombia and edged toward
approving a $13 billion bill that would also finance U.S.
peacekeepers in Kosovo and aid victims of natural disasters at
home.
</P>
<P>
   The House voted 239-186 to reject an effort by Rep. David Obey,
D-Wis., that would have delayed, and perhaps eventually killed,
$522 million of the Colombia aid. The roll call came after House
Speaker Dennis Hastert, R-Ill., who rarely joins floor debate, took
to the well of the chamber to ask colleagues for the full amount of
money.
</P>
<P>
   Hastert, whose staunch support for the aid for Colombia has
helped keep the overall bill alive, said the money was crucial for
controlling the drug problem in the United States. U.S. officials
say 90 percent of the cocaine and 65 percent of the heroin used in
the United States comes from Colombian-grown coca.
</P>
<P>
   ''We can't ignore this issue,'' Hastert said. ''We can't ignore
it in this Congress, we can't ignore it on our street corners, and
we can't ignore it in the place where this stuff comes from.''
</P>
<P>
   Critics, both liberal and conservative, said the proposal would
risk an intensified, lengthy, and perhaps unsuccessful American
involvement in the South American country's long-running and bloody
civil war.
</P>
<P>
   ''If this doesn't work, what is the next step?'' Obey said.
''Will we then cut and run ... or deepen our involvement?''
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton had requested $1.3 billion for Colombia, on
top of $300 million already in the pipeline. Administration
officials worked actively to oppose Obey's amendment.
</P>
<P>
   By a 380-39 vote, the House approved bipartisan language tying
about $500 million of the aid to Colombia adopting tactics to
eliminate drug production by 2005, though Clinton could waive that
requirement. Colombia's military leaders would also have to be
given powers to crack down on human rights violations.
</P>
<P>
   As expected, the House voted to add $4 billion to the measure
for the Pentagon for this year, including funds for upgrading
helicopters and AWACS radar warning planes, equipment repair, and
military housing and health care. The money, backed by House
leaders to satisfy pro-defense lawmakers who wanted a bigger
defense budget for 2001, was approved 289-130.
</P>
<P>
   Other parts of the bill also were under fire.
</P>
<P>
   A group of bipartisan lawmakers wanted to make half the bill's
nearly $2.1 billion for U.S. forces in Kosovo contingent on
European countries stepping up their activity in the Balkan
enclave. Conservatives said the bill's overall price tag -- nearly
twice the $5.5 billion Clinton now wants -- was too hefty.
</P>
<P>
   ''We've sent too many of our soldiers on too many missions to
too many countries,'' said Rep. Greg Ganske, R-Iowa.
</P>
<P>
   Even so, the bill seemed certain to be approved by a bipartisan
majority, testament to the election-year allure of spending money
for drug fighting and supporting American soldiers abroad.
</P>
<P>
   Another attraction was hundreds of millions of dollars the
measure contained for lawmakers' home districts. Included was $40
million to help Florida citrus growers whose trees have been
damaged by the citrus canker, $7.1 million for Southern California
farmers whose crops have been harmed by a bacterial disease, and
$20 million for a new Food and Drug Administration laboratory in
Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   The bill's ultimate fate is questionable. Senate Majority Leader
Trent Lott, R-Miss., has said he wants to shrink it and put the
remnants into spending measures for fiscal 2001 that Congress will
write later this year.
</P>
<P>
   House leaders were hoping their chamber's passage would pressure
Lott into reconsidering. Clinton used a news conference Wednesday
to urge lawmakers to pass the bill ''without delay,'' and
administration officials sent letters to congressional leaders
warning of harm to various programs if the money is blocked.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. aid to Colombia is to be part of a $7.5 billion,
three-year effort announced last summer by Colombian President
Andres Pastrana to regain control over southern regions dominated
by leftist rebels who protect the drug trade. Most of the money
would come from Colombia.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. aid includes money for training and equipping Colombian
troops and police, intelligence operations, giving farmers
incentives to grow other crops, and assisting neighbors Peru,
Ecuador and Bolivia.
</P>
<P>
   A year after the start of the 78-day air war against Yugoslavia,
there are 37,000 NATO-led peacekeepers in Kosovo, including 5,300
Americans. Amid recent flare-ups of ethnic violence in the
Yugoslavian province, some lawmakers want European countries to
contribute more for rebuilding and maintaining security there.
</P>
<P>
   The spending bill also includes $1.6 billion for rising Pentagon
fuel costs; $858 million for its fiscally ailing health care plan;
$2.2 billion for victims of Hurricane Floyd, which battered North
Carolina last autumn, and other natural disasters; and $600 million
for help poor families pay utility bills.
</P>
<P>
   All but $421 million of the bill would be paid for from this
year's projected $26 billion budget surplus.
</P>
<P>
   In a nod to conservatives, the House voted 420-0 to approve an
amendment by Rep. Patrick Toomey, R-Pa., aimed at reserving $4
billion of the surplus for debt reduction.

<HEADLINE> Bill Would Decriminalize Abandonment  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   DOVER, Del. (AP) -- Legislation that would allow parents of
newborns to escape child abandonment charges if they leave their
baby at a hospital emergency room is being drafted in the General
Assembly.
</P>
<P>
   The two bills are intended to give parents who don't want their
babies an option other than abandoning the newborn -- and possibly
killing the child.
</P>
<P>
   ''This bill gives any adult in charge of a newborn that's at
risk of injury or harm the chance to deliver that baby to a
hospital without having to face criminal charges,'' said state Rep.
Nancy Wagner, the author of one of the bills. ''My goal is to have
the baby safe.''
</P>
<P>
   Delaware has seen several high-profile cases of abandoned
newborns, some of whom have died. And Delaware prosecutors accused
New Jersey teen-agers Brian Peterson and Amy Grossberg of killing
their baby boy in November 1996 after he was delivered in a motel
room. The two teens each served prison time for the death of the
child, which drew national attention.
</P>
<P>
   Several other states, including California, Minnesota, Georgia
and Texas, are either considering or have adopted similar laws.

<HEADLINE> INS, Elian Family To Square Off  </HEADLINE>
By ALEX VEIGA, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   MIAMI (AP) -- With Elian Gonzalez's Miami relatives and the U.S.
government still at an impasse, Cuban leader Fidel Castro announced
that the 6-year-old's father is ready to travel to Florida to
retrieve his son.
</P>
<P>
   Castro made the announcement during a live television broadcast
Wednesday. Castro said Juan Miguel Gonzalez ''is ready to
immediately'' go to Florida to take custody of the boy, but he
added that the trip was conditional on guarantees that the U.S.
government would turn Elian over to his father or at least make a
maximum effort to do so.
</P>
<P>
   It was the first time anyone has said the boy's father would be
willing to stay in the United States during the legal process.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. Immigration and Naturalization Service officials were
meeting Wednesday night with the boy's Miami relatives, including
his great-uncle, Lazaro Gonzalez, who he has been living with.
</P>
<P>
   The INS has demanded that the family promise in writing to hand
the boy over if it loses its court battle to keep Elian in this
country. The INS has warned it will revoke the boy's temporary
permission to stay in the United States at 9 a.m. Thursday if the
family does not agree by then.
</P>
<P>
   If the family misses the Thursday morning deadline, the INS will
tell the great-uncle how and when he is to relinquish custody of
Elian, said INS spokeswoman Maria Cardona in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   Cardona would not say exactly what timetable would be given, but
said that the INS will probably not call for Elian's turnover
immediately, or even later on Thursday. Officials would not say
whether they would pick up Elian or ask the uncle to deliver him
somewhere.
</P>
<P>
   Lazaro Gonzalez has said he would be willing to release Elian to
his father if Juan Miguel Gonzalez came to Florida from Cuba, but
he said he would not deliver the boy to the INS.
</P>
<P>
   ''The boy lives in my house, and they'll have to go find him
there,'' Lazaro Gonzalez told Spanish-language network Telemundo.
</P>
<P>
   Before Wednesday's meeting between the Miami relatives and the
INS got under way, the Miami family's lawyer, Kendall Coffey, said:
''We are not going to sign what we consider to be a blank check
that could have a psychological effect on the child.''
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday evening, Elian was playing in the yard with other
children on a swing set as news helicopters flew overhead, and
about 250 protesters stood outside his home. A prayer vigil was
planned nearby, and about 60 trucks that had blocked the streets
earlier in the day in protest had moved away.
</P>
<P>
   Some demonstrators have talked of forming a human chain and
laying down their lives to prevent the little boy from being taken
away.
</P>
<P>
   ''The federal authorities of INS need to understand that we are
free and this is a country of laws and we are not going to accept
their stubborness. We are not going to allow them to take the
kid,'' said Oscar Pupo, 56, a Cuban-born U.S. citizen and trucker.
</P>
<P>
   Elian was found in an inner tube off the coast of Florida in
November after the boat he was on capsized and his mother died.
</P>
<P>
   The INS has said it would not do anything that would traumatize
the boy. INS spokeswoman Karen Kraushaar said her agency has ''gone
to great lengths to bring about a resolution that is carried out in
a manner that creates as little disruption for Elian as possible.''
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. relatives have asked a federal appeals court in Atlanta
to overturn a federal judge's ruling affirming an INS decision to
send Elian back to Cuba. The court has scheduled arguments for the
week of May 8.
</P>
<P>
   Also Wednesday:
</P>
<P>
   --Miami-Dade County Mayor Alex Penelas announced that he will not
let the police help federal officials remove the boy from his
great-uncle's home, though police officers would help keep the
peace.
</P>
<P>
   Penelas and the mayors of 22 nearby towns warned they would hold
President Clinton and Attorney General Janet Reno responsible for
any violence that breaks out if immigration officials try to return
the boy to Cuba.
</P>
<P>
   --In Washington, a group of U.S. lawmakers seeking to block the
deportation of the child introduced legislation to confer permanent
American residency status on Elian and nearly all his Cuban
relatives. But even supporters of the measure -- written by Sen. Bob
Smith, R-N.H. -- suggested its chances of being enacted seemed
slight.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton, in a news conference at the White House,
said: ''I have done my best not to overly politicize this. And I
don't think we should. There is a legal process here; we ought to
let it play out.''
</P>
<P>
   --Florida Gov. Jeb Bush and his Cabinet adopted a resolution
Wednesday asking the U.S. government to allow the appeals process
to continue. In a letter, Bush also urged Reno and Clinton to
instruct the INS to remove the pledge requirement.
</P>
<P>
   --ABC, meanwhile, aired footage of the boy saying he didn't want
to be sent to Cuba. On ''Good Morning America,'' Elian said in
Spanish that he didn't want his father to visit him in Miami
''because he'll take me to Cuba and I don't want to go to Cuba.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked if he would like it if his father stayed in Miami, he
answered: ''He can stay here. I don't want to go.''

<HEADLINE> Bret Saberhagen Plans Early Return  </HEADLINE>
By JAY LINDSAY, Associated Press
<TEXT>
<P>
   FORT MYERS, Fla. (AP) -- Doctors told Bret Saberhagen after his
offseason shoulder surgery that he wouldn't be pitching for Boston
until July at the earliest.
</P>
<P>
   The timetable has since been adjusted.
</P>
<P>
   The 35-year-old right-hander says he'll be back by May 15, and
insists his projection isn't the product of wishful thinking, or a
foolish acceleration of his rehabilitation from surgery on a torn
rotator cuff.
</P>
<P>
   His shoulder feels stronger now than before the operation.
</P>
<P>
   ''The first day I picked up the ball, I felt no pain,''
Saberhagen said. ''It feels real good.''
</P>
<P>
   His early return to the rotation would give the Red Sox a major
boost. The 1985 World Series MVP was 10-6 with a 2.95 ERA last
year, and is 25-15 over three years with Boston.
</P>
<P>
   Last season, he volunteered to pitch on three days rest in the
fifth game of the ALCS against New York despite the shoulder pain,
something manager Jimy Williams hasn't forgotten.
</P>
<P>
   ''This guy tried to pitch with a hole in his shoulder,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   But Williams said the team will be cautious about Saberhagen's
return.
</P>
<P>
   ''We don't have any expectations,'' he said. ''There's no
timetable. It's good that he feels good. It doesn't prove anything
to rush things. We're not going to let him rush things.''
</P>
<P>
   Saberhagen's been throwing off the mound regularly, and said
he's throwing all his all pitches with no discomfort. Pitching
coach Joe Kerrigan has him going hard for 20 minutes, then cooling
down to get him back in the rhythm of a starting pitcher.
</P>
<P>
   He's scheduled to throw batting practice in early April, though
he says he feels strong enough to do it now.
</P>
<P>
   ''I just keep pushing myself,'' he said. ''Pushing myself to
where my arm can tolerate it.''
</P>
<P>
   At times, he said, he has to stop himself from pushing too hard.
</P>
<P>
   ''The progress is good,'' he said. ''But I'm not back yet.''
</P>
<P>
   If there's one thing Saberhagen knows, it's rehab.
</P>
<P>
   Saberhagen's been on the disabled list nine times in his 17-year
major league career. He won AL Comeback Player of Year in 1987
after shoulder problems limited his effectiveness in 1986. He
missed the entire 1996 season after offseason shoulder surgery,
then spent almost all of 1997 rehabilitating in Boston's farm
system.
</P>
<P>
   Saberhagen said the constant injuries have been draining.
</P>
<P>
   ''I could have given up many times,'' he said. ''But you can't
play this game forever, so you do it when you can. As long as I'm
effective, I'll keep coming back.''
</P>
<P>
   Saberhagen admitted he notices his name doesn't come up often
when talk turns to the Red Sox 2000 pitching staff.
</P>
<P>
   ''I don't hear a whole lot about me at all in this year's
plans,'' he said. ''It pushes me.''
</P>
<P>
   Saberhagen said by the end of the year, his contributions will
have been noticed.
</P>
<P>
   ''I expect to get back in the rotation and start winning games
very quickly,'' he said. ''That's what I plan on. That's my job.''

<HEADLINE> Rwandan-Canadians Decry War Criminal  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   OTTAWA (AP) -- Dozens of Rwandan-Canadians protested Wednesday
outside Parliament to demand the arrest of an alleged Rwandan war
criminal living in Canada.
</P>
<P>
   The protesters want Leon Mugesera, a former Rwandan government
official accused of helping incite the 1994 genocide of 500,000
people in the East African country sent back to Rwanda to stand
trial.
</P>
<P>
   ''We feel cheated that he's just ... an immigration case,'' said
Patrick Bulingufi Habamenshi, a relative of some victims of the
1994 killings.
</P>
<P>
   Mugesera was ordered deported from Canada in 1996, but has
remained in the country during the appeals process.
</P>
<P>
   According to evidence submitted to Canada's Immigration and
Refugee Board, Mugesera gave a speech in 1992 calling for the
extermination of Tutsis. At the time, he was an adviser to Rwandan
President Juvenal Habyarimana, whose death in a plane crash in
April 1994 sparked a civil war and the slaughter of Tutsis and
moderate Hutus.
</P>
<P>
   Mugesera fled Rwanda for Canada before the killing began and was
given refugees status in 1993. But his suspected role in inciting
the Rwandan genocide led to the deportation order for lying about
his background in his refugee application, along with the war
crimes allegations.

<HEADLINE> Israel Wants Withdrawal Safeguard  </HEADLINE>
By SARI BASHI, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   JERUSALEM (AP) -- Israel wants international intervention to
ensure a quiet border in case its withdrawal from Lebanon is done
without an agreement with Syria, Foreign Minister David Levy said
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Israel TV reported that Israel agreed to a U.S. request to delay
a campaign to enlist international support for three weeks,
apparently to avoid alienating Syria, the main power broker in
Lebanon, in last-ditch eforts to renew peace talks.
</P>
<P>
   A summit Sunday in Geneva between President Clinton and Syrian
President Hafez Assad failed to bring about a resumption of the
peace talks, stalled since January. Israel is not giving up on the
talks, but with its self-imposed July deadline to withdraw from
Lebanon looming, it is preparing for a unilateral pullout.
</P>
<P>
   Unless Syria agrees to rein in Hezbollah guerrillas in south
Lebanon, a withdrawal from a border zone Israel occupies to protect
its northern towns could lead to an escalation of the violence.
</P>
<P>
   ''It is in the Israeli interest,'' Levy said, ''if international
elements will take steps to ensure the quiet and prevent a
deterioration of the situation.'' He said Israel would cooperate
with any efforts by the U.N. Security Council to prevent attacks on
its northern border. U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan says the
world body has been planning for the possibility of a unilateral
withdrawal by Israel, but he hasn't released details.
</P>
<P>
   Israel has repeatedly declared its support for U.N. resolutions
calling for the withdrawal from Lebanon in an attempt to win
international legitimacy for the pullout -- and international
support if it is attacked from Lebanese soil following a
withdrawal.
</P>
<P>
   Over the past several days, Barak and Levy have spoken by phone
and in person to their counterparts in France, Egypt, Cyprus, Japan
and Russia about their intention to honor U.N. resolution 425
calling for an Israeli pullout.
</P>
<P>
   Syria demands an upfront Israeli commitment to withdraw from all
of the Golan Heights, captured in 1967. Israel wants to retain land
adjoining the Sea of Galilee, a major source of drinking water, and
says it wants answers on security arrangements and normalization
before drawing borders.
</P>
<P>
   Barak has been careful not to rule out the option of talks,
telling a group of Golan residents in comments released by his
office that ''the door is still not closed all the way.''

<HEADLINE> First lady tours women's technology incubator  </HEADLINE>
By CLIFF EDWARDS, AP Technology Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO (AP) -- Taking her U.S. Senate campaign to
California, first lady Hillary Rodham Clinton showed her support
for women entrepreneurs Wednesday at an incubator for
Internet-related companies.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton joined San Francisco Mayor Willie Brown at the Women's
Technology Cluster and took part in a roundtable discussion with
women who own Internet companies to discuss their role in the
future of technology.
</P>
<P>
   ''We need to build that new girls' network to compete with the
old boys' network,'' she proclaimed.
</P>
<P>
   Recent polls have shown Clinton locked in a virtual dead heat
with Republican rival New York City Mayor Rudolph Giuliani to
replace retiring Democratic Sen. Daniel Patrick Moynihan.
</P>
<P>
   While the roundtable was not billed as a fund-raising trip,
political candidates of all stripes have become frequent visitors
to Northern California in hopes of tapping support from an Internet
industry flush with new wealth.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton also has been heavily courting women and minorities in
her Senate race. Tuesday night, she received an award for her work
on behalf of breast cancer patients at a star-studded gala in
Beverly Hills, Calif., and organizers of Wednesday's event planned
to broadcast the discussion over the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   During the roundtable, Clinton listened to several CEOs talking
about starting their businesses, and asked the women questions
about funding. She appeared impressed.
</P>
<P>
   ''Today, I've met a lot of women who just don't know -- and don't
want to know -- what can't be done,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton also helped launch a new Web site, MsMoney.com, a
financial site aimed at women.
</P>
<P>
   ''We're glad that she's very interested in the issues of
economic empowerment of women,'' said Margarita Quihuis, director
of the Women's Technology Cluster, which provides technical and
financial advice and space for 20 female entrepreneurs at a time in
exchange for a share of their future stock.
</P>
<P>
   Women now receive less than 4 percent of venture capital
funding, Quihuis noted, ''so it's great that she's showing her
support in terms of what we're trying to do here.''
</P>
<P>
   Venture capitalists typically invest in a company in its early
stages in return for stock in that company. While many of those
companies will not succeed, the venture capitalists are betting
some will be hits, like Amazon.com.
</P>
<P>
   The Women's Technology Cluster, a 30,000 square-foot space where
some of the entrepreneurs live as well as work, gets help from the
Panasonic Corp.'s venture capital and technology development
subsidiary.
</P>
<P>
   Paul Liao, president of Panasonic Technologies Inc., said the
incubator's help for a select few eventually helps everyone. ''They
are really unleashing the potential of a whole group of people,
another class of innovators who can really drive the economy.''
</P>
<P>
   After the roundtable, Clinton was scheduled to attend a
fund-raiser at the home of Apple Computer founder Steve Jobs.

<HEADLINE> Congressional Notebook  </HEADLINE>
By DAVID ESPO, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Sen. John McCain will make his initial
campaign foray on behalf of House Republican candidates early next
month, officials said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   The disclosure came shortly after McCain held an unannounced
meeting in his Senate office with Rep. Tom Davis, the head of the
House GOP campaign committee.
</P>
<P>
   Two GOP aides, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said
McCain's first campaign swing would be in the Northeast. One added
that McCain would likely campaign for Mark Nielsen, challenging
Rep. Jim Maloney in Connecticut, and Greg Becker, running against
Rep. Carolyn McCarthy in New York.
</P>
<P>
   McCain has said previously that he wants to help New York Mayor
Rudolph Giuliani, who is running for a Senate seat against first
lady Hillary Rodham Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   McCain won seven presidential primaries and showed strong appeal
among independent voters before abandoning the race for the White
House earlier this month. He appeared before the House Republican
rank and file last week and offered to campaign on behalf of GOP
candidates.
</P>
<P>
   The meeting with Davis came one day after McCain and Texas Gov.
George W. Bush, the GOP presidential nominee-in-waiting, talked by
phone, the latest step in a post-primary dance of reconciliation.
They are expected to meet, but no date has been set.
</P>
<P>
   --------
</P>
<P>
   Top Democrats are urging the rank and file to reach for their
checkbooks in the next few days, so key candidates can have as much
money in the bank as possible when they file campaign fund raising
reports on March 31.
</P>
<P>
   ''Maximize your early support. Please remember to help them as
much as you can,'' Rep. Patrick Kennedy, D-R.I., wrote fellow
Democrats recently, adding that Democratic leader Dick Gephardt was
in full support of his appeal.
</P>
<P>
   Kennedy's letter went on to name several candidates who should
be helped. The incumbents included Reps. Shelley Berkley of Nevada;
Mike Forbes of New York; Joe Hoeffel of Pennsylvania; Rush Holt of
New Jersey; Jay Inslee of Washington state; Dennis Moore of Kansas;
and David Wu of Oregon. All are freshmen except Forbes, a former
Republican who jumped to the Democratic party last summer.
</P>
<P>
   Also making Kennedy's list were several challengers, including
Jim Matheson, bidding for a seat in Utah; and Mike Taylor, in a
rematch for a seat in North Carolina. One challenger left off the
list was Adam Schiff, challenging GOP Rep. Jim Rogan in California.
Officials said they believed Schiff's fund raising had been
excellent, and no special attention was needed.
</P>
<P>
   A fat bank balance provides more than psychological comfort for
a candidate. It can also scare off potential challengers or
discourage contributors from making donations to a rival whose
candidacy looks like it will be overwhelmed.
</P>
<P>
   ------
</P>
<P>
   House Republicans served notice during the day that they'll
force a vote early next month on legislation to ban certain
late-term abortions, resurrecting an issue that has proved
politically useful to them in the past.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton has twice vetoed similar ''partial-birth
abortion'' bills on grounds that they didn't make exceptions to
protect the health of the mother, and is expected to do so once
again. But the measure has splintered abortion rights supporters in
Congress, and to some extent, placed them on the defensive.
</P>
<P>
   The House voted to override Clinton's veto of similar
legislation in 1998, for example, with Democrats joining
Republicans in supplying the two-thirds majority needed.
</P>
<P>
   The Senate passed a similar bill last fall, but not before
abortion rights supporters forced a vote on a nonbinding provision
expressing support for the Supreme Court's 1973 decision that
legalized the right to abortion. It passed, 51-47.
</P>
<P>
   The ''partial birth'' issue could surface in the presidential
campaign, as well. Vice President Al Gore has supported Clinton's
vetoes. Bush has said he would sign the legislation.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Soft-Pedals Flag Issue in SC  </HEADLINE>
By ANNE GEARAN, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   COLUMBIA, S.C. (AP) -- To the applause of a racially mixed
audience, President Clinton said Wednesday the Confederate flag
flying over the Statehouse here remains a painful and divisive
symbol.
</P>
<P>
   But Clinton stopped short of saying outright that the flag
should come down.
</P>
<P>
   ''As long as the waving symbol of one American's pride is the
shameful symbol of another American's pain, we still have bridges
to cross,'' Clinton said during a fund-raising tribute to Rep. Jim
Clyburn, D-S.C., who leads the Congressional Black Caucus.
</P>
<P>
   His remarks echoed an address earlier this month in Alabama,
where the president commemorated the 35th anniversary of the Selma
voting rights march.
</P>
<P>
   The National Association for the Advancement of Colored People
calls the flag a racist emblem and is leading a tourism boycott of
South Carolina until it is removed. The debate over the flag boiled
over during the Republican presidential primary this year.
</P>
<P>
   Both Texas Gov. George W. Bush and his then-challenger, Arizona
Sen. John McCain, refused to take a position on the flag. They both
called it a local issue.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats accused them of pandering to the far-right of the
Republican party.
</P>
<P>
   Vice President Al Gore and his then-challenger, Bill Bradley,
each said the flag should come down.
</P>
<P>
   The flag's defenders say it is a symbol of Southern heritage,
and that it honors Confederate soldiers who died during the Civil
War.
</P>
<P>
   ''I know everyone expects me to say something about that,''
Clinton said of the flag. But he seemed resolved to keep the
rhetoric low at a time when a compromise over the flag may be at
hand.
</P>
<P>
   This week, the NAACP offered some support for a plan to remove
the flag from the Statehouse but display other Civil War-era flags
on the building grounds.
</P>
<P>
   Clyburn, who in 1992 became South Carolina's first black elected
to Congress in more than 100 years, favors removing the flag. So
does the African Methodist Episcopal Bishop who introduced Clinton
at the campus of historically black Allen University on Wednesday
night.
</P>
<P>
   Senior bishop John Hurst Adams said the flag has ''no right'' to
be atop the Statehouse dome, and a majority of South Carolinians
would prefer to remove it.
</P>
<P>
   ''But the majority of the people of South Carolina are held
captive by an intractable (state) House of Representatives that
will not take that flag down,'' Adams said.
</P>
<P>
   Aboard Air Force One earlier Wednesday, Clinton said he is still
jet-lagged from his week-long trip to India, Pakistan and
Bangladesh. South Asia is 10 hours ahead of Eastern Standard Time.
</P>
<P>
   ''I was a little afraid to do that press conference today,''
Clinton told reporters just after his one-hour question and answer
session at the White House. ''At weird times of the day, I get
dizzy.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton said that although he is a natural night owl, he has
found himself retiring early and waking in the wee hours. Clinton
said he went to bed at 9:15 p.m. Tuesday, but still managed to read
two books.

<HEADLINE> Judge Lifts Stay of Tenn. Execution  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   NASHVILLE, Tenn. (AP) -- A federal judge Wednesday lifted a stay
of execution that she ordered last week for a condemned child
rapist and murderer.
</P>
<P>
   The order by U.S. District Judge Aleta Trauger clears the way
for Robert Glen Coe's death by injection once the Tennessee Supreme
Court sets an execution date. There is no indication when the high
court will do that.
</P>
<P>
   Coe came within 16 hours of being Tennessee's first person
executed in 40 years when Trauger indefinitely delayed his death
scheduled for March 23. That was to consider a motion that the
state's process for determining mental competency was flawed.
</P>
<P>
   The order issued Wednesday said Tennessee courts had followed
requirements of a 1986 U.S. Supreme Court ruling that barred the
execution of insane inmates.
</P>
<P>
   Coe's attorney Robert Hutton said the defense team would
probably appeal to the 6th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in
Cincinnati.
</P>
<P>
   Coe, 43, is condemned in the 1979 kidnapping, rape and murder of
8-year-old Cary Ann Medlin.

<HEADLINE> Colombia Court Upholds Quota Law  </HEADLINE>
By VIVIAN SEQUERA, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOGOTA, Colombia (AP) -- Colombia's highest court upheld a law
Wednesday requiring that 30 percent of the country's cabinet posts
and top judgeships be held by women.
</P>
<P>
   The law rightly aims to ensure women's ''adequate and effective
participation'' in high-level decisions, Constitutional Court
president Alejandro Martinez told a news conference.
</P>
<P>
   The quotas do not have to be met immediately, but can be
achieved ''progressively,'' as vacancies come open, Martinez
explained.
</P>
<P>
   The matter now turns to President Andres Pastrana, who can sign
the law -- which would require changes in his own cabinet -- or veto
it. He has not stated his position.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is only fair, because 51 percent of Colombians are
women,'' said Sen. Viviane Morales, a key advocate of the
legislation which failed five previous attempts in Congress before
being approved in June.
</P>
<P>
   Critics say that while the law may have laudable goals, quotas
are discriminatory against men. Federal tax chief Fanny Kertzman,
the most prominent and popular woman in Pastrana's administration,
testified in Congress against the legislation.
</P>
<P>
   At the moment, women hold three of Colombia's 16 ministerial
posts. Pastrana would have to bring that number to five, and also
include at least one woman in slates he proposes to Congress for
choosing the Attorney General, Public Prosecutor and Comptroller.
</P>
<P>
   The law would also mandate changes in the Constitutional Court
and Supreme Court, currently composed entirely of men. Thirty
percent of the justices would have to be women.
</P>
<P>
   Although men still dominate politics, Colombia has been a leader
in Latin America in placing women in high-ranking positions. Two
have served in recent years as foreign minister.
</P>
<P>
   A similar quota law exists in Argentina, and has led to a
dramatic increase in the presence of women at the upper echelons of
government.

<HEADLINE> Tokyo Stocks Fall  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   TOKYO (AP) -- Tokyo stocks fell moderately early Thursday
following declines in technology issues on Wall Street. The dollar
was lower against the yen.
</P>
<P>
   The benchmark 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average shed 105.82 points,
or 0.51 percent, to 20,600.83 in the first 30 minutes of trading.
On Wednesday, the average closed up 332.31 points, or 1.63 percent.
</P>
<P>
   The dollar bought 105.68 yen, down 0.34 yen from late Wednesday
in Tokyo and also below its late New York level of 105.81 yen.
</P>
<P>
   On the stock market, the Nikkei average started lower after the
technology-rich Nasdaq composite index lost 189.22 to 4,644.67 at
Wednesday's close in New York.
</P>
<P>
   Some investors also locked in profits after the Nikkei rose over
the past four consecutive trading days, traders said.
</P>
<P>
   In currency dealings, the dollar slipped against the yen
following weakness in New York, where the greenback was hurt by a
stronger-than-expected increase in Japanese industrial production
for February.
</P>
<P>
   The latest data suggested parts of Japan's ailing economy may be
moving toward recovery.
</P>
<P>
   Also on Wall Street, the Dow Jones industrial average closed at
11,018.72 on Wednesday, up 82.61.
</P>
<P>
   In other currencies, the euro was traded at 100.67 yen, down
from 101.64 yen late Wednesday in Tokyo.
</P>
<P>
   The broader Tokyo Stock Price Index of all issues listed on the
first section was up 2.98 points, or 0.17 percent, to 1,735.82. The
TOPIX closed up 52.08 points, or 3.1 percent, the day before.
</P>
<P>
   The yield on the benchmark 10-year Japanese government bond fell
to 1.8300 percent from Wednesday's finish of 1.8500 percent. Its
price rose 0.18 point to 100.60.

<HEADLINE> Stars 4, Panthers 1  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   SUNRISE, Fla. (AP) -- Scott Thornton scored a pair of goals and
Ed Belfour stopped 36 shots Wednesday night as the Dallas Stars
clinched their fourth straight Pacific Division title, winning 4-1
over the Florida Panthers.
</P>
<P>
   Florida lost for the first time in four games. The Stars,
unbeaten in seven road contests, have six wins in eight contests
(6-1-1).
</P>
<P>
   Dallas has won an NHL-record 34 straight road games when scoring
at least three goals.
</P>
<P>
   Belfour was not expected to start because of a court hearing
that resulted from his March 8 arrest for assault and resisting
arrest.
</P>
<P>
   The Panthers got scoring chances, but Belfour was up to the task
nearly every time, including a nice glove save on Pavel Bure in the
second.
</P>
<P>
   Bure scored on a rebound off a Ray Whitney shot with 11:14 to
play -- extending his point-scoring streak to nine games -- ending
Belfour's bid for his 50th career shutout.
</P>
<P>
   The Stars went up 1-0 in a fight-filled first period. Joe
Nieuwendyk scored on the power play just 2:42 in after Florida's
Mike Sillinger was sent off for interference. Nieuwendyk's shot
from the right circle beat Trevor Kidd on the stick side.
</P>
<P>
   The Stars added a pair of goals 59 seconds apart in the second
to take command. Guy Carbonneau scored his 10th when his shot from
the left circle hit Kidd's pads and trickled in at 12:24. Thornton
made it 3-0 when he flicked the puck in behind Kidd.
</P>
<P>
   The last time the teams met, Dec. 10 at Dallas, Florida also
fell behind 3-0 but rallied to tie it. The Panthers were then
beaten by Jamie Langenbrunner's late goal.
</P>
<P>
   There would be no comeback in the rematch.
</P>
<P>
   Thornton added his second goal at 4:32 of the third. Brett Hull
broke a two-game scoreless streak with three assists.
</P>
<P>
   The Stars played without Mike Modano, who has 20 goals in his
last 29 games. He has a hip flexor injury and was held out for
precautionary measures.
</P>
<P>
   Dallas has now won five of six meetings between the clubs. The
Panthers were trying for a franchise record 24 home wins.

<HEADLINE> $6.5M Awarded in Brain Damage Case  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON (AP) -- A judge has awarded an estimated $6.5 million to
the family of a boy who suffered brain damage shortly after his
birth at a Boston hospital.
</P>
<P>
   The parents of Dylan Keene, who contracted meningitis and
suffered severe brain damage shortly after he was born May 15,
1986, sued Brigham and Women's Hospital for compensatory damages
and pain and suffering.
</P>
<P>
   The hospital's inability to find its records on the boy's care
had prompted another judge to lift the $20,000 cap on the amount
for which the hospital could be sued. The plaintiffs could have
used the records to sue medical personnel individually.
</P>
<P>
   ''The family is continuing to prosecute the case in court and
assert the rights of their son and hope there will be a positive
outcome for their son,'' said Chris Milne, an attorney for the
Keenes.
</P>
<P>
   The hospital intends to appeal, according to a statement.
</P>
<P>
   The March 13 ruling detailed Dylan's physical and mental
disabilities and estimated the cost of his care with interest. The
13-year-old boy has the mind of a 6-month-old, is mostly blind and
has little voluntary control of his body.

<HEADLINE> Japan Volcano Activity Intensifies  </HEADLINE>
By GARY SCHAEFER, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   TOKYO (AP) -- More than 9,000 residents took refuge in evacuation
centers in school gymnasiums Thursday, after scientists warned the
Mount Usu volcano could erupt at any time.
</P>
<P>
   Increasingly powerful tremors shook snow-covered Mount Usu, an
active volcano on Japan's northernmost main island of Hokkaido that
last erupted in 1978.
</P>
<P>
   The sudden buildup in seismic activity prompted experts to warn
late Wednesday that the 2,416-foot volcano may erupt at any time.
Some 9,300 residents of nearby areas were evacuated by Thursday
morning.
</P>
<P>
   ''The type of activity at Mount Usu, especially surface
activity, is short-term critical,'' said Dr. Hiromu Okada of the
Usu Volcano Observatory in a news conference broadcast by the
semipublic NHK television.
</P>
<P>
   A 4.2 magnitude quake jolted Mount Usu Wednesday evening. It was
the most intense of the nearly 2,996 tremors that have been
recorded in the area over the last three days.
</P>
<P>
   Worried that an eruption would melt snow on the volcano's flanks
and cause mudslides, authorities ordered the evacuation of 3,832
homes in the towns of Date, Sobetsu and Abuta, hot-spring resorts
with a combined population of 51,300.
</P>
<P>
   Hundreds of other residents had already left their homes
voluntarily, frightened by the tremors and the smoke and steam
spewing out of the mountain. Many of the evacuees slept in school
gymnasiums.
</P>
<P>
   ''I wish it would just erupt and get it over with,'' said
Toshiko Oishi, a 69-year-old housewife who had evacuated to a local
elementary school. ''But I'm worried about my house because it's
near the mountain.''
</P>
<P>
   National news broadcasts showed hospital patients in wheelchairs
being taken to ambulances and families preparing to spend the night
in makeshift shelters organized in schools and other public
facilities.
</P>
<P>
   Police officer and town officials checked for stragglers, and
3,000 Ground Self-Defense Force units in Hokkaido were placed on
standby, a prefectural official said.
</P>
<P>
   ''Making absolutely sure people are safe is our top priority,''
said Takashi Odajima of the Hokkaido government's
disaster-prevention section.
</P>
<P>
   In Tokyo, Japan's central government set up an emergency task
force at Prime Minister Keizo Obuchi's residence.
</P>
<P>
   The threat of natural catastrophe is taken very seriously in
Japan, an archipelago prone to seismic and volcanic activity.
</P>
<P>
   The last eruption at Mount Usu, 475 miles north of Tokyo, killed
two people and destroyed 196 homes in October 1978.
</P>
<P>
   Yoshiaki Ida, chairman of the Meteorological Agency's
Coordinating Committee for Prediction of Volcanic Eruption, was
quoted as saying by Kyodo News that Mount Usu could be expected to
eject a large amount of pyroclastic flow -- a mixture of rocks,
pumice, volcanic ash and gas.

<HEADLINE> Hornets 98, Pistons 91  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUBURN HILLS, Mich. (AP) -- Anthony Mason had 22 points, 10
rebounds and eight assists to lead the Charlotte Hornets to a 98-91
victory over the Detroit Pistons in a battle of two of the East's
hottest teams Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   The Hornets now lead the Pistons by three games in the race for
the No. 6 seed in the Eastern Conference playoffs.
</P>
<P>
   The win extended Charlotte's winning streak to four games and
took some of the luster off Detroit's 4-1 West Coast trip.
</P>
<P>
   David Wesley added 18 points for Charlotte, while Elden Campbell
had 16 points and 13 rebounds. Grant Hill led Detroit with 26 and
Jerry Stackhouse added 19.
</P>
<P>
   Detroit led by as many as 13 points in the second quarter, but
seven points from Mason in the period got the Hornets within 47-43
at the half. Stackhouse had 14 in the half, while Mason had 12.
</P>
<P>
   Charlotte took its first lead of the game, 60-57 midway through
the third, by using a 6-0 run. But John Crotty's 3-pointer and a
driving layup by Grant Hill let the Pistons regain a 71-69
advantage by quarter's end.
</P>
<P>
   Charlotte opened the fourth period with a 5-0 run, taking the
lead 74-71 with 10:16 to go. After Hill's two free throws, the
Hornets increased their edge to 79-73 with a three-point play by
Todd Fuller and two foul shots by Eddie Jones.
</P>
<P>
   Charlotte led by as many as seven, but Hill's three-point play
finished a rally that brought Detroit within 84-83 with 5:44 to go.
The Pistons got no closer as the Hornets scored the next four
points from the line.
</P>
<P>
   Derrick Coleman missed two free throws, but Jones grabbed the
long rebound and David Wesley hit a jumper to keep the Hornets'
lead at 92-88.
</P>
<P>
   Hill's short jumper with 45 seconds left got the Pistons within
94-91, but Campbell iced the game with a 10-footer.
</P>
<P>
Notes: Detroit lost reserve guard Michael Curry to a sprained
right ankle in the third quarter. His status for Friday's home game
against Phoenix is unknown. ... Detroit's 4-1 West Coast trip was
their best trip to the Pacific Coast since a 5-0 mark in March
1992. ... The Hornets have won 9 of 11 against Detroit, including
four of the last six at the Palace.

<HEADLINE> Tokyo Stocks Rise  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   TOKYO (AP) -- Tokyo stocks rose moderately Thursday morning,
shrugging off declines in technology issues on Wall Street. The
dollar slipped against the yen.
</P>
<P>
   The benchmark 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average, which was down
some 105 points early in the session, gained 101.76 to finish the
morning session at 20,808.41. On Wednesday, the average closed up
332.31 points, or 1.63 percent.
</P>
<P>
   The dollar bought 105.78 yen, down 0.24 yen from late Wednesday
in Tokyo and also below its late New York level of 105.81 yen.
</P>
<P>
   On the stock market, the Nikkei average started lower after the
technology-rich Nasdaq composite index lost 189.22 to 4,644.67 at
Wednesday's close in New York.
</P>
<P>
   Some investors also locked in profits early in the session after
the Nikkei rose the past four straight sessions.
</P>
<P>
   But the market's main index later reversed course as investors
bought major information-related issues in anticipation that
Japan's fiscal new year beginning April 1 will unleash buying by
funds, traders said.
</P>
<P>
   In currency dealings, the dollar carried over from similar
weakness in New York where the greenback was hurt by a
stronger-than-expected increase in Japanese industrial production
for February.
</P>
<P>
   The latest data, released Wednesday, suggested parts of Japan's
ailing economy may be moving toward recovery.
</P>
<P>
   Traders said demand for yen also apparently grew as some
European investors were moving to invest in Japanese stocks by
selling the greenback or the euro.
</P>
<P>
   In other currencies, the euro was traded at 100.70 yen, down
from 101.64 yen late Wednesday in Tokyo.
</P>
<P>
   The broader Tokyo Stock Price Index of all issues listed on the
first section was up 18.29 points, or 1.06 percent, to 1,751.13.
The TOPIX closed up 52.08 points, or 3.1 percent, the day before.
</P>
<P>
   The yield on the benchmark 10-year Japanese government bond fell
to 1.8350 percent from Wednesday's finish of 1.8500 percent. Its
price rose 0.13 point to 100.55.

<HEADLINE> Mexico Lawyer Accuses Ex-Mayor  </HEADLINE>
By AMPARO TREJO, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   MEXICO CITY (AP) -- The chief prosecutor for Mexico City accused
a former mayor of embezzlement Wednesday and asked the nation's
congress to remove the suspect's legal immunity as a cabinet
secretary.
</P>
<P>
   The allegations against Tourism Secretary Oscar Espinosa come
amid a presidential election campaign, though city Attorney General
Samuel Del Villar denied politics was involved in the timing.
</P>
<P>
   Del Villar said the city controller's office had found that
Espinosa approved diversions of $45 million to an account
controlled by a senior aide and that there is no evidence of what
happened to the money.
</P>
<P>
   Espinosa, of the governing Institutional Revolutionary Party,
held a news conference to deny any wrongdoing and accused the
current opposition-led city administration of raising the issue for
political reasons ahead of the July 2 elections.
</P>
<P>
   ''What they are seeking is nothing more than a scandal,'' he
said, calling it ''a smokescreen to cover up the many problems the
city faces and the failure of their administration.''
</P>
<P>
   Espinosa was the last presidentially appointed mayor of Mexico
City, serving from 1994 until 1997 -- a time of economic crisis
nationwide and dramatically soaring crime rates in Mexico City.
</P>
<P>
   The leftist Democratic Revolution Party won a landslide victory
over the PRI in the city's first direct mayoral elections in
generations. The winner, Cuauhtemoc Cardenas, stepped down late
last year to run for president.
</P>
<P>
   Del Villar said that as a cabinet secretary, Espinosa cannot be
prosecuted unless the lower house of congress votes to waive his
immunity. The PRI is the largest single party in congress, but
opposition parties together have a slender majority.
</P>
<P>
   According to the city controller's office, the suspect funds
were channeled into a fund supposedly meant for publicity. But it
said the former head of the city public relations department denied
any knowledge of the fund.
</P>
<P>
   The new scandal comes as congress is debating whether -- or how --
to release the names of people suspected of wrongdoing in overdue
loans that led to a nearly $100 billion bank bailout.
</P>
<P>
   Some Democratic Revolution leaders have charged that senior
members of the PRI and other parties are among those whose business
debts were eventually covered by taxpayers' money.

<HEADLINE> Poaching Endangers Sumatran Tiger  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON (AP) -- New demand across Southeast Asia for the skins,
teeth and claws of tigers is endangering much of the great cats,
particularly the Sumatran tiger, environmentalists said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Traffic, a joint program between the World Wide Fund for Nature
and the World Conservation Union to keep tabs on illegal trading of
animals, said in a statement that ''the illegal trade in tiger
skins has reared its ugly head again.''
</P>
<P>
   A WWF field report in Indonesia said that at least 66 Sumatran
tigers have been killed in the last two years, amounting to nearly
20 percent of the tiger population. It said 24 were taken from the
Bukit Barisan Selatan national park.
</P>
<P>
   ''The report revealed that major illegal supplying markets still
operate openly in Southeast Asian countries such as Cambodia,
Indonesia, Laos, Myanmar and Vietnam,'' said Traffic Executive
Director Steven Broad. ''Trade volumes are sizeable and there has
been little enforcement action against poachers and traders.''
</P>
<P>
   ''This new trend threatens to undermine the progress made in
curtailing the use of tiger bone in Chinese medicines,'' said
Stuart Chapman, head of the WWF's Wildlife Trade Programme.
</P>
<P>
   ''Until now we knew very little about what was happening to the
Sumatran tiger,'' he added. ''What we have found is deeply
disturbing, even more so because much of this slaughter is
happening in and around national parks and protected areas.''
</P>
<P>
   The tiger trade will be one of the main topics at next month's
Convention on Trade in Endangered Species meeting in Nairobi,
Kenya, which will be attended by 150 countries.
</P>
<P>
   There were nearly 100,000 wild tigers at the beginning of the
20th century but their numbers have dwindled. Experts estimate only
7,500 tigers are left in the wild today.

<HEADLINE> Coyotes 3, Thrashers 2  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA (AP) -- Dallas Drake knocked in a rebound with 7:21
remaining Wednesday night as the Phoenix Coyotes ended a seven-game
losing streak with a 3-2 victory over the Atlanta Thrashers.
</P>
<P>
   The expansion Thrashers, who lost their fourth straight, are
winless at home in 17 games (0-15-2).
</P>
<P>
   Drake's 13th goal came with Phoenix captain Keith Tkachuk in the
penalty box for high-sticking Johan Garpenlov. Playing his first
game since serving a two-game suspension for high-sticking
Colorado's Aaron Miller, Tkachuk hit Garpenlov out of frustration
after the Atlanta forward fell on him and stole the puck.
</P>
<P>
   With play stopped, Tkachuk was looking toward the Phoenix net
and standing at the Atlanta blue line when Thrashers goalie Damian
Rhodes charged from behind and shoved him to the ice.
</P>
<P>
   Garpenlov served Rhodes' charging penalty, and the teams were
skating 4-on-4 when Drake scored the game-winner.
</P>
<P>
   Coyotes goalie Sean Burke ended a six-game losing streak by
making 28 saves. Neither Burke nor Phoenix had won since his second
consecutive shutout, a 5-0 win over Vancouver, on March 11.
</P>
<P>
   Rhodes, who made 30 saves, dropped to 1-7-1 since returning from
a sprained ankle that sidelined him for nearly four months.
</P>
<P>
   Hnat Domenichelli forged a 2-2 tie 9:16 into the second period
when Shean Donovan failed to see Steve Guolla's pass from the slot.
Standing behind Donovan, about five feet to the left of the crease,
Domenichelli punched in his 10th goal
</P>
<P>
   Ray Ferraro made it 2-1 with 1:20 left in the first. Ferraro's
18th goal -- his 10th on the power play -- sailed over Burke's glove
side.
</P>
<P>
   Travis Green's 23rd goal -- a wrist shot to Rhodes' left -- put
the Coyotes up 2-0. Stationed just outside the crease, Green
knocked in the rebound of Jyrki Lumme's slap shot with 7:47 gone in
the first.
</P>
<P>
   Louie DeBrusk's third goal, scored on the power play, made it
1-0 just 2:23 into the game.

<HEADLINE> Hurricanes 3, Predators 1  </HEADLINE>
By ELIZABETH A. DAVIS, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   RALEIGH, N.C. (AP) -- Marek Malik, Ron Francis and Andrei
Kovalenko each scored as the Carolina Hurricanes beat the Nashville
Predators 3-1 Wednesday night.
</P>
<P>
   The Hurricanes, who have won three of five games, are still
solidly in the hunt with Buffalo and Montreal for the eighth and
final Eastern Conference playoff spot.
</P>
<P>
   Arturs Irbe, who gave up five goals in Monday's loss to Buffalo,
stopped 24 shots as he notched his 30th win. He is the franchise's
first goalie to reach the mark since Mike Liut had 31 wins 13 years
ago.
</P>
<P>
   Nashville's Cliff Ronning stopped Irbe's bid for his fifth
shutout of the season with his 25th goal with 2:19 left.
</P>
<P>
   Francis scored his 23rd goal at 10:50 of the first period to
make it 2-0. Jeff O'Neill redirected a pass from Gary Roberts from
the right side, and Francis fired it past Nashville goalie Mike
Dunham as he crossed in front of the net.
</P>
<P>
   Malik's fourth goal, set up by Jeff Daniels and Paul Ranheim,
put Carolina ahead 1-0 at 2:57. Malik's shot from the left corner
behind the goal line grazed Dunham's right skate and slipped past
the post.
</P>
<P>
   Kovalenko sealed Carolina's win with his 15th goal at 14:28 of
the third.
</P>
<P>
   Carolina's all-star forward Sami Kapanen, tied for second on the
team with 23 goals, was scratched from the game and will likely
miss Friday's crucial game at Buffalo as he recovers from
concussion symptoms.
</P>
<P>
   Hurricanes officials aren't sure when Kapanen was injured, but
decided to keep him out for precautionary reasons.
</P>
<P>
   The Predators are one win shy of matching last year's win total
of 28 in their inaugural season.

<HEADLINE> Ohio Newspaper Wins Privacy Lawsuit  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   AKRON, Ohio (AP) -- A jury ruled Wednesday that journalists from
the Akron Beacon Journal acted reasonably when they tried to
interview the police chief's wife about her claims that her husband
was abusive.
</P>
<P>
   A Summit County jury rejected the bulk of Edward and Geneva
Irvine's $8 million invasion of privacy lawsuit, however it awarded
$206,500 to the couple for alleged telephone harassment by the
newspaper as it tried to get the couple to subscribe to the paper.
</P>
<P>
   The Beacon Journal may appeal that decision, an attorney for the
paper said.
</P>
<P>
   The couple claimed the newspaper hounded Geneva Irvine after she
was hospitalized and told a police officer that her husband abused
her. She later dropped the allegations, and no charges were filed.
</P>
<P>
   The paper last spring ran a series of stories on Geneva Irvine's
claims and the internal police investigation into them, and it sent
a reporter to try to interview her in Louisiana where she was
staying with relatives and undergoing cancer surgery.
</P>
<P>
   The Beacon Journal maintained it was doing its duty as a public
watchdog by checking on serious charges against a high-ranking
official.
</P>
<P>
   Edward Irvine said he was pleased the jury found the newspaper
liable for telephone harassment.
</P>
<P>
   ''The most important thing was that they were found guilty,'' he
said. Asked if he still believed the newspapers' reporters went too
far, he said, ''they definitely did.''
</P>
<P>
   Geneva Irvine did not respond when asked to comment.
</P>
<P>
   Janet Leach, the newspaper's editor, said she was proud of the
jury for upholding the freedom of the press. ''It was about being
fair,'' she said. ''It was never about being intrusive.''

Judge Rules Clinton Violated Privacy
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Resurrecting an impeachment controversy, a federal judge
ruled today that President Clinton ''committed a criminal violation of the
Privacy Act'' by releasing personal letters to undermine the credibility of one
of his accusers. Clinton immediately disputed the decision, saying he
reluctantly released the letters two years ago because ''it was the only way I
knew to refute allegations'' by Kathleen Willey of an unwanted sexual advance.
U.S. District Judge Royce Lamberth, a Republican appointee, concluded the
president and three top White House lawyers disregarded an earlier court ruling
in making Willey's letters public in the midst of the Monica Lewinsky scandal in
1998.

Israel Wants Withdrawal Safeguard

   JERUSALEM (AP) -- Israel wants international intervention to ensure a quiet
border in case its withdrawal from Lebanon is done without an agreement with
Syria, Foreign Minister David Levy said Wednesday. Israel TV reported that
Israel agreed to a U.S. request to delay a campaign to enlist international
support for three weeks, apparently to avoid alienating Syria, the main power
broker in Lebanon, in last-ditch efforts to renew peace talks. A summit Sunday
in Geneva between President Clinton and Syrian President Hafez Assad failed to

Bush Keeps Focus on Education

   NEWARK, N.J. (AP) -- George W. Bush, reaching out to women and political

abortion rights wouldn't necessarily disqualify any potential running mate.
Bush, the expected Republican presidential nominee, toured a charter school that
he said showed how his proposal for alternatives to failing schools could work.
New Jersey Gov. Christie Whitman, mentioned by some as a possible vice
presidential choice, accompanied him. While saying he had not made any running
mate lists, Bush spoke warmly of Whitman when reporters asked about her chances,
even though he opposes abortion and she favors abortion rights.

natural disasters at home. The House voted 239-186 to reject an effort by Rep.
David Obey, D-Wis., that would have delayed, and perhaps eventually killed, $522
million of the Colombia aid. The roll call came after House Speaker Dennis
Hastert, R-Ill., who rarely joins floor debate, took to the well of the chamber
to ask colleagues for the full amount of money. Hastert, whose staunch support
for the aid for Colombia has helped keep the overall bill alive, said the money
was crucial for controlling the drug problem in the United States.

Japan Volcano Activity Intensifies

<P>
   TOKYO (AP) -- More than 9,000 residents took refuge in evacuation centers in
school gymnasiums Thursday, after scientists warned the Mount Usu volcano could
erupt at any time. Increasingly powerful tremors shook snow-covered Mount Usu,
an active volcano on Japan's northernmost main island of Hokkaido that last
erupted in 1978. The sudden buildup in seismic activity prompted experts to warn
late Wednesday that the 2,416-foot volcano may erupt at any time. Some 9,300
residents of nearby areas were evacuated by Thursday morning.

<HEADLINE> West 146, East 120  </HEADLINE>
By HOWARD ULMAN, AP Sports Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON (AP) -- Win or lose in the NCAA tournament Final Four,
Michigan State has a bright future. Its two top recruits, Zach
Randolph and Marcus Taylor, starred in the West's run-and-gun
victory in the McDonald's All America High School game Wednesday
night.
</P>
<P>
   The West outscored the East 146-120 as Randolph won the game's
MVP award with 23 points and 15 rebounds and Taylor, a point guard,
had 14 points, six rebounds and three assists.
</P>
<P>
   Their next stop: Indianapolis, to watch the Spartans play
Wisconsin in the NCAA semifinals Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   It was a record-shattering night at the FleetCenter featuring 24
of the top high school seniors in the country chosen by a
seven-member selection committee and an advisory panel of scouts
and media members.
</P>
<P>
   The 146 points broke last year's mark set by the West in a
141-128 victory. And the crowd of 18,624 was over 3,000 more than
the biggest previous crowd of 15,527 set in 1982 at the Rosemont
Horizon outside Chicago. The first McDonald's game was played in
1978 in Philadelphia.
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday night, the fans saw a game of sprinting players,
quick shots and enough alley-oops and dunks to fill a highlight
show.
</P>
<P>
   The West's DeShawn Stevenson, who will attend Kansas, led all
scorers with 25 points as he hit 12-of-19 shots in just 25 minutes.
He won the slam-dunk contest Monday night.
</P>
<P>
   Darius Rice, a nephew of NFL wide receiver Jerry Rice, led the
East with 24 points, making 9-of-18 shots in 24 minutes. The
Mississippi high schooler is leaning toward Kentucky.
</P>
<P>
   There were 254 shots in the four-quarter, 48-minute game. The
West went 67-for-137 from the field, the East 49-for-117. The West
also had a massive advantage off the boards, outrebounding the East
84-54.
</P>
<P>
   The West led 37-32 after one quarter and 74-63 at the half. It
scored the first 10 points of the fourth quarter on 3-pointers by
Alton Ford, who plans to attend Houston, and Taylor, a dunk by
Travon Bryant and a layup by Chris Duhon.
</P>
<P>
   The West led 106-85 after three quarters, and Randolph and
Taylor made sure the East wouldn't come back, scoring their team's
first seven points of the fourth period for a 113-87 advantage.
</P>
<P>
   The crowd missed the FleetCenter record of 20.153 set Dec. 9,
1995 in a game between Boston College and Massachusetts.

Anna Sokolow
</P>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Anna Sokolow, a modern dancer who performed with
Martha Graham and later choreographed with such luminaries as
Jerome Robbins and Leonard Bernstein, died Wednesday of pneumonia.
She was 90.
</P>
<P>
   Sokolow, born of Russian immigrants, began studying dance at age
10 with Blanche Talmud, then with Graham and Louis Horst at the
Neighborhood Playhouse on Manhattan's Lower East Side. She made her
debut in 1936 at the Young Men's Hebrew Association.
</P>
<P>
   Sokolow was a member of Graham's renowned company from 1930 to
1939, when she formed the first modern dance company in Mexico,
training both dancers and choreographers. She also started her own
New York company, Players' Project.
</P>
<P>
   Her dances focused on such disturbing topics as the plight of
refugees, sweatshops, fascism and Nazi concentration camps.
</P>
<P>
   The dance critic Walter Terry once wrote that after seeing an
evening of Sokolow works, you want to go home and kill yourself.
</P>
<P>
   Her masterpiece generally is considered to be the 1955
''Rooms,'' which she choreographed for actors in her movement class
at the Actors Studio.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to composers Bernstein and Aaron Copland, and fellow
choreographer Robbins, artists with whom Sokolow worked included
playwright Bertolt Brecht and actors Marlon Brando and Eli Wallach.
</P>
<P>
   Sokolow created the steps for ''Street Scene,'' a Kurt Weill
musical directed by Elia Kazan for a 1947 Broadway production. She
also worked for television and the New York City Opera.
</P>
<P>
   Since the 1950s, Sokolow was often a guest artist in Israel,
training generations of that country's dancers.

<HEADLINE> Iraq's Top U.N. Official Leaves  </HEADLINE>
By LEON BARKHO, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) -- A former U.N. official left Iraq Wednesday
vowing to continue his fight against U.N. trade sanctions which he
accused of depriving the Iraqi population of its basic supplies.
</P>
<P>
   Several U.N.-employed Iraqis wept when Hans Von Sponeck shook
their hands for the last time. Signs of grief were evident on the
faces of his international staff.
</P>
<P>
   But Von Sponeck, who resigned last month over the impact of
sanctions on ordinary Iraqis, said his mission was not over. He
said he would work to persuade ''governments that enough is
enough.''
</P>
<P>
   Iraq blames the sanctions for people's suffering, but U.N.
relief officials say the government's priorities and wars are also
responsible for the deprivation.
</P>
<P>
   Von Sponeck, a German, is the second U.N. coordinator in Iraq to
resign over the sanctions issue. The sanctions were imposed for
Iraq's 1990 invasion of Kuwait and will only be lifted when the
government proves to U.N. weapons inspectors that it has scrapped
its weapons of mass destruction and means to produce and deliver
them.
</P>
<P>
   But the weapons inspectors left Iraq more than a year ago and
the government has vowed it will never allow them to return. Two
former chief weapons inspectors said Tuesday they believed Baghdad
has utilized the inspectors' absence to resurrect its weapons
programs.
</P>
<P>
   Secretary-General Kofi Annan, who had urged von Sponeck not to
speak out against the sanctions while still on the U.N. payroll,
issued a statement Wednesday saying he ''wishes to record his
appreciation for the dedication that Mr. von Sponeck brought to
this complex assignment.''
</P>
<P>
   Annan has named Tun Myat of Myanmar, a World Food Program
official, as the new humanitarian coordinator to replace Von
Sponeck.
</P>
<P>
   Von Sponeck said he could not continue watching a population
that is ''deprived of everything ... the right proper life, the
right to work, the right to shelter, good services and most of all
the right to education.''
</P>
<P>
   A recent UNICEF report said at least 20 percent of Iraqi
children have dropped out of school and are now engaged in petty
trade in major urban centers.

<HEADLINE> Al-Amin Extradition Papers Signed  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   MONTGOMERY, Ala. (AP) -- Alabama officials agreed Wednesday to
extradite Jamil Abdullah Al-Amin to Georgia in the slaying of a
deputy in Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   Al-Amin, a 1960s black militant known as H. Rap Brown, would be
returned to Georgia under the extradition paperwork signed
Wednesday by aides to Gov. Don Siegelman. Al-Amin's attorneys have
said they will oppose extradition and questioned the validity of
the papers.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier Wednesday, FBI agents found a car that they believe
Al-Amin drove in a field in the White Hall community where Al-Amin
was arrested last week, FBI spokeswoman Celestine Armstead said in
Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   Armstead said the car has been transported to Montgomery and
would be processed by the FBI's evidence response team.
</P>
<P>
   Al-Amin faces murder and assault charges in the killing of
Deputy Ricky Kinchen and the wounding of Deputy Aldranon English.
They were shot March 16 as they tried to serve Al-Amin with an
arrest warrant at his grocery store in Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   Al-Amin remained jailed in Montgomery.
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutors said the extradition process could take two weeks to
two months.

<HEADLINE> Cavaliers 86, Bulls 81  </HEADLINE>
By NANCY ARMOUR, AP Sports Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHICAGO (AP) -- The Cleveland Cavaliers weren't about to let this
one slip away.
</P>
<P>
   A night after blowing a 17-point, fourth-quarter lead, Bob Sura
and Lamond Murray hit 3-pointers in the final 2{ minutes Wednesday
night as the Cleveland Cavaliers held off the Chicago Bulls 86-81.
</P>
<P>
   Sura, who blasted his team for its lack of unity after Tuesday
night's loss to Toronto, led the Cavaliers with 20 points. Murray
added 16 points, and Shawn Kemp and Brevin Knight each scored 10.
</P>
<P>
   Elton Brand led the Bulls with 27 points and eight rebounds.
Hersey Hawkins scored 20 points on 5-of-6 shooting from 3-point
range, and reserve Chris Anstey added 18 points and 11 rebounds.
</P>
<P>
   The Bulls got within 81-78 on Brand's putback with 42 seconds
left, but Murray hit a 3-pointer 20 seconds later and the Bulls got
no closer.
</P>
<P>
   Cleveland led by as much as nine in the third quarter, but Brand
scored on a putback and a hook shot to cut Cleveland's lead to
60-55 at the end of the quarter. Ron Artest opened the fourth with
a 3-pointer, and Anstey converted on a three-point play to bring
the Bulls within one.
</P>
<P>
   Chicago took a 66-64 lead with 7:55 left on a Hawkins'
3-pointer, and it looked like Cleveland might be headed for another
fourth-quarter collapse.
</P>
<P>
   But Sura wasn't about to let that happen. He answered right back
with his own 3, and Kemp scored on a putback and a three-point play
to give Cleveland a 70-66 lead with 6:52 left.
</P>
<P>
   The Bulls cut Cleveland's lead to 74-73 on another Hawkins' 3,
but Sura was there again. Kemp scored on a jumper, and Sura made a
3-pointer to give the Cavaliers a 79-73 lead.
</P>
<P>
Notes: Randy Brown hyperextended his left knee in a third-quarter
collision with Andrew Declercq. ... The Bulls outrebounded the
Cavaliers 43-39. ... Simpkins had 10 rebounds. The Cavaliers were
called for a technical in the first quarter for their second
illegal defense violation. ... Cleveland has won five of its last
nine road games.

<TEXT>
<P>
   ST. LOUIS (AP) -- Jonas Hoglund and Steve Thomas each had a goal
and an assist and Mats Sundin set up three goals Wednesday night as
the Toronto Maple Leafs ended the St. Louis Blues' dominance over
Canadian teams with a 3-2 victory.
</P>
<P>
   The loss was the first for the Blues this season against a team
from Canada (13-1-3). No U.S. based team has gone undefeated in a
season against Canadian teams.
</P>
<P>
   Maple Leafs goalie Curtis Joseph made 34 saves to preserve the
victory and snap the Blues' six-game unbeaten streak. Toronto
scored three times on just 16 shots against Roman Turek.
</P>
<P>
   Craig Conroy and Jochen Hecht scored for the Blues, who lead
Detroit by just one point for the NHL's best record. The teams meet
Saturday at St. Louis.
</P>
<P>
   Cory Cross scored the other goal for the Maple Leafs.
</P>
<P>
   Thomas broke a 2-2 tie with his 22nd goal at 5:57 of the third
period. Sundin started the play by stealing the puck from
defenseman Chris Pronger at the point. He dumped it into the corner
to Hoglund, who centered in front and Thomas tipped it home.
</P>
<P>
   St. Louis had allowed only four goals in five games.
</P>
<P>
   Cross got Toronto on the board just 1:25 in with his fourth
goal. Sundin shot the puck into the St. Louis zone then chased down
his own rebound along the right boards. When the Blues converged on
Sundin, he centered to Cross, who beat Turek for a 1-0 lead.
</P>
<P>
   After Conroy tied it at 5:56 with his 12th goal, Hoglund gave
the Maple Leafs the lead again 2:28 into the second with a
power-play goal that banked in off Pronger. St. Louis had killed 66
of 68 power plays before Hoglund's goal, his 28th.
</P>
<P>
   Hecht tied it 2-2 with a power-play goal of his own at 4:58 of
the period. lifting his own rebound over Joseph for his 10th goal.

<TEXT>
<P>
   DETROIT (AP) -- Sergei Fedorov got his 300th goal and Detroit
scored four times in the third period as the Red Wings dampened the
Vancouver Canucks' playoff chances with a 6-3 victory Wednesday
night.
</P>
<P>
   Steve Duchesne had two goals for the Red Wings, who are chasing
St. Louis for first place in the Central Division and Western
Conference. Detroit, which has won four straight and is 5-1-1 in
its last seven, plays at St. Louis on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   Detroit trails the Blues, who lost at home to Toronto, by just
one point.
</P>
<P>
   The loss snapped a two-game winning streak for Vancouver, 5-1 in
six contests. The Canucks began Wednesday two points out of the
final Western playoff spot with only five games remaining.
</P>
<P>
   Vancouver took a 3-2 lead on third-period goals from Marty Baron
and Brendan Morrison before Detroit rallied.
</P>
<P>
   Todd Gill tied it by pushing a nice centering pass from Kirk
Maltby past goalie Felix Potvin at 8:09.
</P>
<P>
   Kris Draper put Detroit ahead by deflecting Duchesne's shot
behind Potvin 2:26 later, and Stacy Roest added an insurance goal
at 15:21 when he gloved down Fedorov's rebound and fired it into
the net.
</P>
<P>
   Duchesne scored into an empty net with 1:02 remaining.
</P>
<P>
   Chris Osgood made 19 saves for Detroit. Potvin stopped 26 shots.
</P>
<P>
   Detroit played the third period without captain Steve Yzerman,
held out as a precaution after a second-period leg injury.
</P>
<P>
   Red Wings forward Tomas Holmstrom missed the final two periods
after he was hit in the face with an Yzerman shot in the first. He
suffered a cut lip and left the arena for dental work.
</P>
<P>
   Morrison broke a 2-2 tie 4:13 into the third when he converted a
pass from Andrew Cassels. Morrison has seven points in as many
games since the Canucks acquired him March 14 in the trade that
sent Alexander Mogilny to New Jersey.
</P>
<P>
   Baron wiped out a 2-1 Detroit lead 1:18 earlier when his shot
from the top of the left circle got through traffic and past
Osgood.
</P>
<P>
   Vancouver scored just 1:11 into the game after Mark Messier won
a left circle faceoff back to Marcus Naslund, who blasted a shot
over Osgood's left shoulder.
</P>
<P>
   Fedorov's 300th goal tied it on a power play 2:59 into the
second when he converted a short pass from Brendan Shanahan in
front of the net.
</P>
<P>
   The Red Wings took a 2-1 lead at 7:55 of the second when
Shanahan made a long drop near the Canucks' line to Murphy, who
shot the puck through Potvin's legs.

<HEADLINE> EU, China Open WTO Discussion  </HEADLINE>
By ELAINE KURTENBACH, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   BEIJING (AP) -- Talks between Chinese and EU trade leaders
focused Thursday on key issues of China's entry into the World
Trade Organization.
</P>
<P>
   EU trade commissioner Pascal Lamy met again with his Chinese
counterpart, foreign trade minister Shi Guangsheng, after meeting
Wednesday with Premier Zhu Rongji to discuss opening China's
long-closed markets.
</P>
<P>
   Though the EU has billed the meetings as a positive sign,
officials sought to dampen expectations for a speedy agreement.
</P>
<P>
   ''The fact that we met Zhu this early on in the process is a
reflection of the importance that both sides attach to what we're
doing,'' Lamy spokesman Anthony Gooch said following Wednesday's
meetings.
</P>
<P>
   Also Wednesday, Zhu told President Clinton's top security
adviser, Sandy Berger, that the election of a new,
independence-minded leader in Taiwan had placed U.S.-China
relations at an ''important, if not critical, juncture,''
</P>
<P>
   Chinese leaders have grown suspicious of Washington's intentions
toward Taiwan and are particularly worried about possible sales of
sophisticated warships and anti-missile defenses to the island as
well as proposed U.S. legislation to formalize ties with Taiwan's
military.
</P>
<P>
   China sees unification with the island, which split off 51 years
ago amid civil war, as a cherished national goal.
</P>
<P>
   Berger was in Beijing for two days of meetings to appeal for
Chinese restraint following the election of Shui-bian, whose party
advocates formal independence for Taiwan. Ahead of the March 18
election, Beijing threatened to use force against Taiwan, fueling
tensions with Washington, which maintains close, though unofficial,
ties with the island.
</P>
<P>
   Reunification with Taiwan and WTO entry are key, though
potentially conflicting, goals of the current Chinese communist
leadership. U.S. lawmakers friendly to prosperous, democratic
Taiwan, have warned that Chinese threats against the island may
prompt them to block moves vital to implementing Washington's
agreement with Beijing on WTO entry.
</P>
<P>
   After 14 years of trying, China has made joining WTO this year a
priority. It hopes the rules-based WTO regime will bring in foreign
investment and force long-protected state industries to make
reforms they have resisted.
</P>
<P>
   Zhu intervened at critical moments during China-U.S.
negotiations in November, helping forge a market-opening deal that
cleared Beijing's biggest hurdle to joining the WTO. China still
needs to reach separate agreements with eight WTO members, the
15-nation European Union foremost among them.
</P>
<P>
   Lamy joined the talks in Beijing this week to help deal with
thorny political issues blocking a final agreement that the sides
say they hope to reach during the talks.
</P>
<P>
   He opened Tuesday's session with Chinese foreign trade minister
Shi Guangsheng and the pair met again for nearly two hours
Wednesday, following the Zhu meeting. They met again Thursday
morning.
</P>
<P>
   Both sides have started to discuss the ''nitty gritty of the
political issues,'' Gooch said.
</P>
<P>
   Neither side has publicly detailed the obstacles to the
agreement. EU officials, speaking on condition of anonymity, have
said Europe wants greater access to China's automobile, insurance
and telecommunications markets and more licenses for insurers.
</P>
<P>
   Negotiators are pushing for more concessions than China granted
the United States last November, although Chinese officials have
hinted they would be hard-pressed to allow that.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. pact gives foreign companies the right to own up to 50
percent of Chinese telecommunication companies and secures wider
access for foreign insurers and bankers, who are now limited by
tight geographical restrictions and an erratic licensing process.

   SALT LAKE CITY (AP) -- Karl Malone scored 30 points and John
Stockton added 20 as the Utah Jazz beat Philadelphia 98-84
Wednesday night, snapping the 76ers' seven-game winning streak.
</P>
<P>
   Malone had 12 points in the third quarter, including eight of
Utah's first 10 in the period as the Jazz stretched a 45-41
halftime lead to 55-45 just over three minutes into the second
half.
</P>
<P>
   Allen Iverson scored 18 points one night after he had 43 in a
victory at Minnesota. But maybe that took too much out of him, as
he shot 7-of-21 against the defense of Stockton and Howard Eisley.
</P>
<P>
   The Sixers never led, but they never gave up either. Twice in
the fourth quarter they came within three points. The Jazz found an
answer each time, and Stockton sealed it with a six-point spurt
midway through the fourth quarter.
</P>
<P>
   A basket by Tyrone Hill trimmed Philadelphia's deficit to 79-76
with 5:33 to play, but Stockton hit 18-foot jumper, then came off a
screen by Malone to make an 8-footer on the baseline with 4:28 to
go.
</P>
<P>
   With 4:01 on the clock, he hit a runner from the lane for an
85-76 lead.
</P>
<P>
   Jeff Hornacek scored 13 points, Bryon Russell 12 and Greg
Ostertag collected 13 rebounds for Utah.
</P>
<P>
   The Jazz shot 17-of-17 from the foul line, led by Stockton's
6-of-6 effort.
</P>
<P>
   Toni Kukoc scored 18 points, Matt Geiger 15 and Theo Ratliff 12
for the Sixers, who had scored at least 100 points in five straight
games. But Philadelphia never found a steady rhythm offensively,
shooting 41.6 percent (32-of-77).
</P>
<P>
Notes: Malone needs 185 points to become the first player in NBA
history to score 2,000 points in 12 consecutive seasons. ... Hill
drew a first-quarter technical while he sat on the bench. Referee
Derrick Stafford blew the whistle after Hill mouthed off while the
Sixers set up their offense. ... Ratliff, the NBA's No. 4
shot-blocker with 2.98 a game, had four in the first quarter and
finished with five. ... The Jazz have beaten the 76ers eight
straight times at home. Philadelphia is one of four teams that has
never won at the Delta Center.

<HEADLINE> Actors Unions Authorize Strike  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Members of two unions representing film and
television actors authorized a strike if negotiations for a new
commercial contract with advertisers break down.
</P>
<P>
   Only work on commercials would be affected.
</P>
<P>
   The Screen Actors Guild and the American Federation of
Television and Radio Artists said Tuesday that a strike
authorization was approved by 93 percent of the nearly 41,000
actors who voted. Fewer than a third of the unions' members cast
ballots, however.
</P>
<P>
   The authorization allows the unions' boards of directors to call
a work stoppage but doesn't require it. The current contract
expires Friday.
</P>
<P>
   The unions have been in talks since Feb. 14 with representatives
of advertising associations over a new contract. The unions want a
20 percent increase in residuals, the payments actors receive each
time a commercial runs, and they are seeking increases for ads
running on Spanish-language television and in foreign markets.
</P>
<P>
   SAG is based in Los Angeles and AFTRA has a New York
headquarters. The negotiations are being held in New York with
representatives of the Association of National Advertisers and the
American Association of Advertising Agencies.
</P>
<P>
   SAG members last went on strike in 1988, a walkout that lasted
three weeks. That also was the year of Hollywood's last major
strike, when the Writers Guild of America walked out for 22 weeks
and cost the industry an estimated $500 million.

   Garcia scored in the 26th minute and Uruguay held off an
energized Bolivia to help new coach Daniel Passarella earn his

</P>
<P>

elude a lunging defender, Garcia fired a left-footed shot into the
net.
</P>
<P>
   In Quito, Ecuador overcame an ejection to beat Venezuela 2-0 at
home, getting goals from Agustin Delgado and Alex Aguinaga.
</P>
<P>
   Delgado scored in the 17th minute, deflected the ball past
goalkeeper Rafael Dudamel off a free kick by Aguinaga, who scored
six minutes into the second half on a low shot.
</P>
<P>
   Ecuador defender Alberto Montano was ejected in the 27th minute
for a foul against Javier Villafraz.
</P>
<P>
   The two nations are the only South American counties never to
qualify for the World Cup.

Solano in the 53rd and Claudio Pizarro in the 60th. On Tuesday

<HEADLINE> Georgian Principal Arrested  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   DECATUR, Ga. (AP) -- An elementary school principal who was
jailed for preventing police from arresting a seventh-grader was
simply following school policy, a school spokesman said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   DeKalb County authorities later dropped charges against the
principal, saying the officer who arrested her acted too hastily.
</P>
<P>
   Two girls got into a fight Tuesday in the office of Atherton
Elementary principal Patti Reid, and a school police officer who
was present told Reid he was going to arrest one of them, said
Spencer Ragsdale, a spokesman for DeKalb County schools.
</P>
<P>
   Reid objected, saying the policy in elementary schools is to
call the fighting students' parents and send them home.
</P>
<P>
   When the officer insisted, Reid locked herself and the student
in her office to keep the girl from being arrested, he said. Reid
initially was charged with obstruction of a police officer, a
misdemeanor.
</P>
<P>
   Ragsdale said he did not know if the girl was arrested.

<HEADLINE> Texas Tornadoes Kill Four  </HEADLINE>
By SHERRI CHUNN, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   FORT WORTH, Texas (AP) -- Cleanup crews sent huge dangling pieces
of glass crashing to the pavement from Fort Worth's skyscrapers
Wednesday as rescuers searched for more victims of tornadoes that
ripped through the city, killing at least four people.
</P>
<P>
   ''We still feel there may be more victims trapped in the
debris,'' Fire Chief Larry McMillan said.
</P>
<P>
   Four people were killed, one was missing and presumed dead, more
than 80 were injured and dozens were left homeless as two twisters
blasted windows out of dozens of offices and tore homes apart
shortly after the evening rush hour Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   The twister stripped the brick walls off a cathedral tower as
two women prayed inside.
</P>
<P>
   ''It looks like a battlefield and yet God brought us
miraculously through,'' said the Rev. Bob Nichols as he surveyed
the damage at Calvary Cathedral International.
</P>
<P>
   About 30,000 people were left without power at the height of the
storm. About 800 were still without power Wednesday evening.
</P>
<P>
   Downtown Forth Worth, a city of 480,000 about 30 miles west of
Dallas, was sealed off as crews pushed 200-pound panes of glass to
the ground from 35 floors up.
</P>
<P>
   Crews went floor by floor in downtown office buildings for a
closer look at damage
</P>
<P>
   ''You will have one building that looks almost unscathed, and
next door to that you have a building that looks like it's downtown
Beirut,'' said Lt. Gov. Rick Perry.
</P>
<P>
   The search for bodies was centered on seven demolished buildings
west of downtown Forth Worth, McMillan said.
</P>
<P>
   Two people were crushed to death -- one by a falling wall and the
other by a truck trailer that flipped on him. Two others in a car
were swept into the Trinity River near Arlington to the east. One
body was recovered, and rescuers searched for the other victim.
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday, a 19-year-old Fort Worth man died at a hospital
from injuries he suffered during the storm.
</P>
<P>
   The tornado that hit Arlington cut a path about two miles long
and several blocks wide, destroying 93 houses, officials said.
Another 1,000 homes received light to moderate damage and 33
businesses were damaged.
</P>
<P>
   It next touched down in the Grand Prairie area about 10 miles to
the east, destroying at least eight homes and damaging six.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's total devastation everywhere you look,'' Mike Anderson, a
Salvation Army spokesman, said of one Arlington neighborhood of
mostly two-story houses of around $200,000.
</P>
<P>
   Many residents spent the night in their cars in their driveways
rather than leave their damaged homes.
</P>
<P>
   Gov. George W. Bush, campaigning in New Jersey, declared Tarrant
County a disaster area.
</P>
<P>
   ''Last night's tornado damage was a tragic reminder of the
fierce power of nature. My thoughts and prayers are with the
victims and their families,'' he said.
