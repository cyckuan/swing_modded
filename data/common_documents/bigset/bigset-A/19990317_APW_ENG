<HEADLINE> Study: Marijuana Helps Fight Pain </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Marijuana has medical benefits for people  
suffering from cancer and AIDS and should undergo scientific trials 
to see how it works best, a panel of medical experts concluded 
Wednesday in a report to the federal government. 
</P>
<P>
	The drug remains illegal under federal law, despite ballot  
measures approving its use in Alaska, Arizona, California, Nevada, 
Oregon and Washington. The new report is sharpening debate over its 
use. 
</P>
<P>
	The Institute of Medicine, an affiliate of the National Academy  
of Sciences, said marijuana's active ingredients can ease pain, 
nausea and vomiting. It urged the development of a standard way to 
use the drug, such as an inhaler. 
</P>
<P>
	The conclusion was greeted warmly by most marijuana advocates,  
but opponents said they worry the report will encourage marijuana 
use. 
</P>
<P>
	``Let us waste no more time in providing this medication through  
legal, medical channels to all the patients whose lives may be 
saved,'' said Daniel Zingale of AIDS Action. 
</P>
<P>
	But Rep. Bill McCollum, R-Fla., who led the fight to get the  
House to condemn medical marijuana last fall, said he is ``deeply 
concerned'' the report might encourage people to smoke marijuana. 
</P>
<P>
	It's known that some of the chemicals in marijuana can be  
useful, he acknowledged, but their place is in inhalers or pill 
form. ``We should not sanction smoked marijuana because there is no 
way to control that,'' McCollum said. 
</P>
<P>
	``Providing good medicine -- not marijuana -- is the compassionate  
response to patients' pain and illnesses,'' said Robert Maginnis of 
the conservative Family Research Council. He insisted doctors have 
other medicines to treat any ailment that marijuana can help. 
</P>
<P>
	White House drug adviser Barry McCaffrey said the findings are  
unlikely to send pharmaceutical companies scrambling to do research 
on marijuana. ``Our experience is there is little market 
interest,'' McCaffrey said. 
</P>
<P>
	Ironically, the new analysis was requested and paid for by  
McCaffrey's White House Office of National Drug Control Policy, 
after an expert panel formed by the National Institutes of Health 
concluded in 1997 that some patients could be helped by marijuana, 
mainly cancer and AIDS victims. 
</P>
<P>
	At the White House, spokesman Joe Lockhart said: ``What we found  
out is that there may be some chemical compounds in marijuana that 
are useful in pain relief or anti-nausea, but that smoking 
marijuana is a crude delivery system. So I think what this calls 
for ... is further research.'' 
</P>
<P>
	That's already under way at the NIH, which is running three  
studies of smoked marijuana and expects to approve a fourth this 
year. 
</P>
<P>
	One study looks at marijuana's safety in people with AIDS, a  
second is checking the extent of medical marijuana use by patients 
of health maintenance organizations and the third is studying 
marijuana's ability to reduce nausea. Nearing approval is a study 
of marijuana's effect on pain. 
</P>
<P>
	The National Cancer Institute is looking into the comparative  
value of a pill form of marijuana vs. a hormone in reducing nausea. 
</P>
<P>
	Breaking ranks with the pro-medical marijuana groups was the  
National Organization for Reform of Marijuana Laws, which condemned 
the report as ``tepid.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Clearly, the time has come for this administration to amend  
federal law to allow seriously ill patients immediate legal 
access,'' said Allen St. Pierre, executive director of the NORML 
Foundation. 
</P>
<P>
	The arguments over using marijuana as a medication have grown  
particularly intense in the last few years in western states where 
supporters got initiatives on the ballot to legalize the practice. 
</P>
<P>
	Voters in Alaska, Arizona, California, Nevada, Oregon and  
Washington have approved measures in support of medical marijuana. 
</P>
<P>
	But the drug remains banned by federal law and doctors may be  
wary of prescribing it, even in those states. 
</P>
<P>
	In its report, the Institute of Medicine said that because the  
chemicals in marijuana ease anxiety, stimulate the appetite, ease 
pain and reduce nausea and vomiting, they can be helpful for people 
undergoing chemotherapy and people with AIDS. 
</P>
<P>
	It also said there is no evidence that use of marijuana leads to  
other drug use. 
</P>
<P>
	But the panel warned that smoking marijuana can cause  
respiratory disease and called for the development of standardized 
forms of the drugs, called cannabinoids, that can be taken, for 
example, by inhaler. 
</P>
<P>
	Even so, the panel said, there may be cases where patients could  
in the meantime get relief by smoking marijuana.

<TEXT>
<P>
	PHOENIX (AP) -- Florida point guard Eddie Shannon, who played his  
senior season with just one eye, has received the Frontier Most 
Courageous Player Award from the U.S. Basketball Writers 
Association. 
</P>
<P>
	Shannon has had limited vision in his right eye since the  
seventh grade, when he was hit by a rock. In recent years, the 
condition worsened. 
</P>
<P>
	Finally, last October, he was fitted with a prosthetic eye after  
having the damaged parts removed surgically. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think I've inspired a lot of people by being in the  
situation I'm in and continuing to play and contribute,'' Shannon 
said. ``It just goes to show what you can achieve no matter what, 
if you just put your head to it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Coach Billy Donovan said it's not just that Shannon has played,  
but the way he's played, that makes the story astounding. 
</P>
<P>
	``Here's a kid who lost his vision in the seventh grade yet  
overcame it and was recruited by some top-notch programs,'' Donovan 
said. ``And not only did he go to college and play, but he went to 
college as basically a four-year starter at 5-foot-9. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's the all-time steals leader in school history, one of the  
top assist leaders in school history. He's scored over 1,000 
points. Just his accomplishments as a player with one eye is 
unheard of.''

	 *COMPLIMENTING DAVIS:* Connecticut coach Jim Calhoun admires  
Iowa coach Tom Davis and the way he has handled his final season 
with the Hawkeyes. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think very few of us would have the decorum and the dignity  
with which he conducted himself,'' Calhoun said. ``What Tom has 
done so wonderfully is he has talked about his team and the game of 
basketball. To me that is a lesson for all of us.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Calhoun said Davis was an innovator with his pressing defense,  
tactics he first showed in his days as coach at Boston College in 
the late 1970s and early 1980s. 
</P>
<P>
	``A lot of the stuff you see by Rick Pitino, by Jim Calhoun, by  
a whole bunch of coaches from our part of the country, really 
evolved from when Tom came to Boston College,'' Calhoun said. ``His 
influence in college basketball continues to live on in literally 
hundreds and hundreds of teams across America.''

coach, was an assistant at the Spokane school for nine years before 
taking over as coach in 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	``We've almost had a sense of state pride, for the first time  
since I've been at Gonzaga,'' he said. ``It's almost equal to what 
Washington State did a couple of years at the Rose Bowl. It doesn't 
matter if you're a (Washington) Husky or a (Washington State) 
Cougar, if you root for Eastern Washington. Everybody is for 
Gonzaga. 
</P>

	Hamilton scored 22 points and hit the game-winning shot at the  
buzzer as the Huskies beat Washington 75-74 in the East Region 
semis. 
</P>
<P>
	The game-winner was a fadeaway jumper on a rebound.  
</P>
<P>
	``Yeah, I'm very superstitious about the Sweet 16,'' he said.  
``Last year I made a shot that I think I will never make again.''

<HEADLINE> Types of anesthesia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	There are many different forms of anesthesia, some easy to apply  
and some requiring special training: 
</P>
<P>
	--Local anesthesia, usually from a shot, numbs just one part of  
the body. Regional anesthesia numbs a broader area, like the 
epidurals used in childbirth. Anti-anxiety agents also may be used, 
like the fast-acting ``laughing gas,'' or nitrous oxide, which is 
popular with dentists. 
</P>
<P>
	--Eighty percent of office-based surgery is performed under  
``conscious sedation,'' where patients are heavily sedated, drowsy 
but still awake enough to breathe on their own. Potent sedatives -- 
usually Versed, sometimes narcotics and sometimes a mix of drugs -- 
are given, either intravenously, orally or rectally. 
</P>
<P>
	--With general anesthesia, the patient is unconscious and loses  
control of his or her reflexes, requiring help to breathe. 
</P>
<P>
	Anesthesia experts say the line between conscious sedation and  
general anesthesia easily can be crossed if the doctor gives too 
much sedative. Experts say all sedated patients should be monitored 
for breathing, oxygen levels and heart function.

<HEADLINE> Masters Buildup Begins at Bay Hill  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ORLANDO, Fla. (AP) -- The road to the Masters is a little shorter  
this year. 
</P>
<P>
	Instead of starting at Doral, it begins Thursday in the Bay Hill  
Invitational. And it's not just because the field features 10 of 
the top 12 players in the world ranking. 
</P>
<P>
	Seve Ballesteros, last seen zooming across Valderrama in a cart  
during the Ryder Cup, was on the practice green at Bay Hill Club 
rolling 20-foot putts toward his caddie. On the range was Lee 
Westwood and Darren Clarke, the ``Spice Boys'' from the European 
tour. 
</P>
<P>
	Ian Woosnam stood outside the locker room, his face beet red  
from a day in the sun. 
</P>
<P>
	``Quite a few of the European guys have come,'' defending  
champion Ernie Els said Wednesday. ``This is probably the run-up 
for the Masters now.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Throw Tiger Woods into the mix. Playing his first stroke-play  
tournament in a month, Woods shook off a case of the flu in recent 
weeks and was looking forward to the warm wind and slick greens of 
Florida, which he hoped would be a nice way to prepare for the 
deceptive breezes and extremely slick greens of Augusta National. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's my first time in Florida, and a different type of wind,''  
Woods said. ``It something I need to get used to again.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Don't get the idea that Bay Hill is simply four days of  
fine-tuning for either The Players Championship next week or the 
Masters the second week in April. History will show that Fred 
Couples is the only player who has won Bay Hill and the Masters in 
the same year, and no one has ever won the Players and Masters in 
the same year. 
</P>
<P>
	But as strong as fields are these days, as deep as the talent  
runs around the globe, there's no use waiting a month to get the 
game in shape. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't want to think about the Masters until I really get  
there,'' Els said. ``We've got most of the best players here. Next 
week we call the fifth major -- probably the best field you'll find 
throughout the year. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've tried to really just get myself in good shape and not go  
as hard. You can't do that anymore,'' he said. ``I think you waste 
your time to come out here and just work on your game instead of 
really giving it a big shot. I'm going to try to have a good 
week.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Els won last year and then fizzled in the Masters. Westwood won  
in New Orleans the week before the Masters, and he also failed to 
be a factor. 
</P>
<P>
	``I want to win this week,'' Westwood said. ``I haven't played  
much this year, so I need to get some confidence and get some kind 
of a roll going. Winning New Orleans gave me confidence. I proved 
to myself I could come over here and win.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The only top 10 players missing from Arnold Palmer's tournament  
are David Duval, who usually takes most of Florida off and has only 
played Bay Hill once in the past three years, and Nick Price, whose 
kids are on spring break this week. 
</P>
<P>
	Besides Greg Norman, resting his shoulder for a three-week run  
that starts next week, the only other absentee worth noting this 
week is Fluff Cowan. Woods fired his caddie earlier this month and 
replaced him with Steve Williams, who used to work for Norman a 
decade ago and most recently Raymond Floyd. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've told him things I want and expect, and he tells me how he  
likes it,'' Woods said. ``It's going to be great. He's very 
professional, and that's what I've always wanted and always admired 
about him.'' 
</P>
<P>
	So how does a caddie go from the senior tour (Floyd) to one of  
the longest players on the PGA Tour? 
</P>
<P>
	``He caddied for Norman, and at the time Greg probably hit his  
irons almost as far as I do now,'' Woods said. ``So he remembers 
back to those days.'' 
</P>
<P>
	It doesn't take much for Els to remember what happened last year  
at Bay Hill. 
</P>
<P>
	Because of the rain, the final 36 holes were played on Sunday  
with a threesome that included three of the four major championship 
winners -- Els, Woods and Davis Love III -- in the last group. 
</P>
<P>
	Els shot a 65 to take control and went on to a four-stroke  
victory. Woods and Love finished a dozen strokes back. 
</P>
<P>
	``I want to have some good vibes from last year,'' Els said.  
</P>
<P>
	Els has a chance to become only the second player to repeat as  
Bay Hill champion in its 21-year history. Loren Roberts won in 
1994-95.

<HEADLINE> Sosa Angers Stottlemyre With Bows </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MESA, Ariz. (AP) -- Sammy Sosa's new home run bow has Todd  
Stottlemyre bent out of shape. 
</P>
<P>
	``Nobody wants to be embarrassed,'' Stottlemyre said after Sosa  
hit two homers off him Wednesday in the Chicago Cubs' 8-5, 
10-inning loss to the Arizona Diamondbacks. 
</P>
<P>
	``I sure don't remember Mickey Mantle bowing after home runs,''  
Stottlemyre said. ``I guarantee Joe DiMaggio didn't bow. I bet 
everything I got Lou Gehrig didn't, Jackie Robinson, Roberto 
Clemente. Those are great players. Those are guys who paved the way 
for us.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Sosa raised his home run total to seven, the most in spring  
training and two more than his 1999 spring total. He picked up the 
habit of bowing to fans during the All-Star tour of Japan last 
November. 
</P>
<P>
	``They're going to have a lot of opportunities to see me showing  
the bows, showing respect for fans,'' said Sosa, who has hit the 
home runs in just 22 at-bats. 
</P>
<P>
	Sosa, 3-for-17 (.167) against Stottlemyre during the regular  
season with no homers and eight strikeouts. hit a two-run homer to 
right-center in the first and a solo shot to left-center in the 
third. 
</P>
<P>
	Each time he crossed the plate, he stopped after a few steps for  
a crisp bow to the seats. 
</P>
<P>
	``I respect the way he and Mark McGwire put baseball back on the  
map last year,'' Stottlemyre said. ``It's a huge credit to him 
personally.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The bows, however, crossed Stottlemyre's line.  
</P>
<P>
	``I took it as offensive,'' he said. ``I don't bow after a  
strikeout or a win. Just play the game, be professional and move 
on.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Sosa was, well, unbowed.  
</P>
<P>
	``No comment,'' he said when informed of Stottlemyre's remarks.  
The bows, he said, are ``showing respect for all the fans who come 
out here seeing the game.'' 
</P>
<P>
	After hitting 66 homers last year, four short of the record set  
by Mark McGwire, Sosa bulked up during the offseason. He is two 
ahead of McGwire in the meaningless spring training race. 
</P>
<P>
	``I have a gym in my house. I was working out two times a day,''  
Sosa said. 
</P>
<P>
	Did he exercise during his numerous travels, too?  
</P>
<P>
	``I was working out on the plane,'' he joked.  
</P>
<P>
	Stottlemyre, making his fourth spring start, allowed three runs  
and five hits in 2 2-3 innings. 
</P>
<P>
	Cubs starter Kevin Tapani gave up five runs -- four earned -- and  
six hits in 2 1-3 innings. He has an 8.59 ERA in three spring 
starts, allowing seven earned runs in 7 1-3 innings. 
</P>
<P>
	Matt Williams drove in three runs for the Diamondbacks with a  
two-run double in the first and a solo homer in the third. 
</P>
<P>
	Henry Rodriguez hit his fourth homer of the spring, a two-run  
shot in the fifth off Vladimir Nunez. 
</P>
<P>
 *Notes:* Cubs first-base coach Dan Radison was ejected by plate  
umpire Greg Bonin after Scott Stahoviak was called out on strikes 
in the ninth. ... Tony Batista broke a 5-all tie in the 10th with a 
two-run triple off Marc Pisciotta and scored on Dante Powell's 
single. ... Dan Carlson won and Aaron Small got a save. ... Arizona 
placed outfielder Yamil Benitez on unconditional release waivers. 
He hit .199 with nine homers and 30 RBIs last year.

<HEADLINE> Web Sites To Play Role in 2000 Race </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Seeking to capitalize on the Internet craze,  
presidential hopefuls are building Web sites that offer everything 
from candidate biographies and issue papers to online chats and 
information on how to volunteer. 
</P>
<P>
	Most of the 2000 campaign Web sites are remarkably similar, both  
in layout and content. But Steve Forbes and Rep. John Kasich offer 
a bit more, giving voters daily reports and photos from the 
campaign trail and mass e-mail updates on the candidates. 
</P>
<P>
	Forbes declared his candidacy for the GOP presidential  
nomination Tuesday in an announcement carried first on his Web 
site. Lamar Alexander made a similar declaration during the 1996 
campaign. 
</P>
<P>
	``The Internet combines the best of American ingenuity,  
innovation and high tech,'' Forbes said at a New Hampshire campaign 
event. 
</P>
<P>
	Of the presidential hopefuls who have formed exploratory  
committees, Vice President Al Gore and Gary Bauer are the only ones 
without active campaign Web sites. Both plan to have sites on the 
World Wide Web soon. 
</P>
<P>
	Gore's site will be ``fresh and dynamic'' and should be up  
before the end of March, said Roger Salazar, spokesman for Gore's 
campaign. 
</P>
<P>
	The implications of Internet campaigning could be significant,  
bringing voters and candidates together in a way previously 
unimaginable. Some think that the power of the Internet will come 
to rival other mediums. 
</P>
<P>
	``The Internet will be to the 2000 campaign what television was  
to the 1960 campaign,'' says Todd Harris, communications director 
for Kasich. ``It is a crucial medium that you have to employ to get 
your message out.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``It is the focal point for campaign activity in a high-tech  
world,'' said Jonathan Baron, communications director for former 
Vice President Dan Quayle. ``Any campaign that makes full use of 
the Internet will have a competitive advantage over those who 
don't.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Gov. George W. Bush of Texas inaugurated his campaign Web site  
the day he announced formation of a presidential exploratory 
committee. Computers were set up at the announcement site and 
people were able to log on to his page -- offered both in English 
and Spanish. 
</P>
<P>
	The campaign Web sites are designed to cater to activist voters  
-- ones who will take the initiative to seek out a candidate and 
vote in the crucial party primaries. 
</P>
<P>
	``People who use the Internet to garner information on  
candidates are much more invested in the political process,'' 
Harris said. 
</P>
<P>
	He said 3,000 people have signed up with Kasich on the World  
Wide Web and are ``now in a dialogue with the campaign.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Web sites give candidates an advantage in building and  
organizing a grass-roots organization. 
</P>
<P>
	Former Sen. Bill Bradley's campaign site has an extensive ``get  
involved'' section that garners information such as age, job and 
e-mail address -- all voluntarily submitted. It will undoubtedly 
help the campaign to organize its volunteers in ways previously 
untapped before the Internet became such a force. 
</P>
<P>
	``It is a great way to put an instant organization together,''  
says Larry Sabato, a professor at the University of Virginia. He 
points to Minnesota Gov. Jesse Ventura's successful campaign as the 
model for using Web sites. 
</P>
<P>
	``Ventura used his Web site to build his organization and get  
people to his events,'' says Sabato. 
</P>
<P>
	``The technology is there for grass-roots efforts,'' said Mark  
Smith, spokesman for Bauer. ``You might as well take advantage of 
it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Web sites also allow the campaigns to communicate with  
voters directly. Candidates can offer a range of policy positions, 
statements, speeches and information without editing or 
interpretation by the news media. 
</P>
<P>
	Elizabeth Dole's site, for example, has video of her entire  
speech announcing her formation of an exploratory committee. Her 
campaign will eventually allow voters to ``customize'' the site, 
giving them the speeches, issue positions and other information 
they are most interested in. 
</P>
<P>
	One thing the Web sites cannot do is directly raise money for  
candidates through credit card donations, which are prohibited 
under Federal Election Commission rules. They, however, can take 
pledges and tell voters where to send checks. 
</P>
<P>
	Sabato thinks that the Internet's role is being somewhat  
overestimated and that it will be a tool primarily of underdog 
candidates. 
</P>
<P>
	``The real revolution will be when we have Internet voting,''  
says Sabato, a phenomenon he thinks will occur within 10 years -- 
changing the face of politics.

<HEADLINE> Countries That Use Nuke Pill </HEADLINE>

<P>
	Some European countries' policies on using the drug potassium  
iodide to protect the thyroid gland in the event of a nuclear 
accident: 

</P>
<P>
                             *Germany    	
</P>
<P>
	Under a 1998 policy, tablets are to be pre-distributed to  
households within 3 miles of nuclear plants, and possibly to 
households within 6 miles. Tablets also are to be stored at central 
locations, such as schools, factories and town halls, for quick 
distribution within 15.5 miles of plants. 
</P>
<P>
	Tablets are kept at one or two central locations for pregnant  
women and children under 12 who live further away. Anyone can buy 
the drug at a pharmacy without a prescription, but it is not 
recommended for people over 45 because risks may outweigh benefits. 

</P>
<P>
                              *Sweden    	
</P>
<P>
	Since 1982, households within about 9 miles of four nuclear  
plants have received tablets. Every five years, regional 
authorities repeat the distribution, to approximately 50,000 
households, through the mail. 
</P>
<P>
	Mailings also include information about radiation, related risks  
and what to do in case of an accident. Drug stockpiles are also 
kept at two central storage sites. The program is funded by the 
nuclear power industry through the government. 

</P>
<P>
                          *United Kingdom    	
</P>
<P>
	Local authorities are responsible for rapid distribution of  
tablets, along with information on dosage and contraindications, to 
people within about 2.2 miles of a nuclear accident. 
</P>
<P>
	Tablets may be pre-distributed to police stations, hospitals,  
pharmacies, schools and evacuation reception centers, and to houses 
and communities that are not easily accessible. Stockpiles are to 
be kept by plant operators and local authorities.

<P>
	Here are excerpts from editorials in newspapers in the United  
States and abroad: 

</P>
<P>
	March 12  
</P>
<P>
	The Washington Post, on new NATO countries:  
</P>
<P>
	Today is a good day for the West. NATO -- the military alliance  
that kept its members stable, prosperous and free through the Cold 
War -- takes in Poland, Hungary and the Czech Republic, long 
involuntary members of NATO's now-extinct Communist counterpart. At 
Independence, Mo., the three formally move out from behind the 
liberty-crushing side of a vanished East-Wide divide, recreate a 
good part of a single, culturally Western and peaceful Europe and 
project stability and democracy eastward. Not a bad day's work. ... 

</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
	Los Angeles Times, on low oil prices:  
</P>
<P>
	Asia's economic woes have slashed its energy needs and helped  
push down world oil prices to an inflation-adjusted level not seen 
for decades. The response from oil producers ... has been to try to 
reduce output. ... 
</P>
<P>
	While oil markets rallied modestly on that news, few expect the  
announced reductions in output to be fully implemented or to last 
long. ... 
</P>
<P>
	A quarter-century ago the OPEC oil cartel held the world in  
thrall, steadily escalating prices and bringing on a global 
recession. Today only about 40 percent of global oil production 
comes from OPEC countries. ... 
</P>
<P>
	Cheap oil has contributed significantly to holding inflation in  
check, but cheap oil is a mixed blessing. ... The United States now 
imports about half of the oil it consumes, and while it is much 
less dependent than it once was on oil from the volatile Persian 
Gulf, it nonetheless invites political and economic risks by such 
heavy reliance on foreign sources. That was the grim lesson of the 
1970s, and it shouldn't be forgotten. 

</P>
<P>

<P>
	The Columbus Dispatch, on workers and pensions:  
</P>
<P>
	In the years that lawmakers and presidents have argued and  
agonized over what to do about the looming insolvency of Social 
Security, America's workers have not been sitting on their hands 
waiting for deliverance. 
</P>
<P>
	Millions have taken advantage of a variety of private  
investments and pension options to build retirement nest eggs far 
more dependable than Social Security. 
</P>
<P>
	But all of these private savings and pension options are  
straitjacketed with restrictions and red tape. 
</P>
<P>
	U.S. Reps. Rob Portman, R-Cincinnati, and Benjamin L. Cardin,  
D-Maryland, have proposed a major overhaul of pension law intended 
to greatly expand the flexibility, availability and portability of 
private retirement plans. 
</P>
<P>
	Every step taken to encourage private saving will bolster the  
retirement security of Americans and leave them less dependent on a 
federal pension system whose prospects are uncertain. 

</P>
<P>
	March 15  
</P>
<P>
	The Times-Picayune, New Orleans, La., on airport safety:  
</P>
<P>
	The flying public takes airport security measures for granted.  
We know we'll have to answer some questions about our baggage, go 
through a metal detector before walking up to the gate and subject 
out carry-ons to X-rays or hand inspection. ... 
</P>
<P>
	But guess what? Behind the scenes, security isn't nearly as  
tight as we would like to believe. The Federal Aviation 
Administration found that out recently when it sent undercover 
agents to five major airports. Now the FAA is going to give 78 of 
the country's largest airports the same kind of scrutiny to see if 
the lapses are systemic. ... 
</P>
<P>
	The situation prompted retired Adm. Cathal Flynn, the agency's  
associate administrator for civil aviation security, to say that 
the FAA might start requiring guards at every airplane. ... 
</P>
<P>
	Before the FAA makes such a drastic move, it needs to address  
the human error that characterizes many of the holes in the safety 
net. ... 
</P>
<P>
	No security system can be perfect, but air passengers deserve  
better than the farce that was passing for security at the airports 
targeted by the FAA undercover operation. No one minds the metal 
detectors or X-ray machines. But we do mind being left vulnerable.

	Corpus Christi (Texas) Caller Times, on Bush and abortion:  
</P>
<P>
	If there was any doubt that the gloves are now definitely off  
regarding the putative presidential candidacy of George W. Bush, it 
came to an end in the generous boxing about the ears he received 
for his statements on abortion last week. The criticisms underline 
the fact that Bush's toughest critics will not be just his primary 
opponents, who will try to dislodge his apparent front-runner 
status, but the Christian far-right. 
</P>
<P>
	Bush's overwhelming gubernatorial victory in November confirmed  
his ability to forge consensus across the broad middle, drawing 
support from moderate Democrats, inner-city dwellers, Hispanics and 
blacks. It's a long way to November 2000, but Bush's chances now 
would have to be regarded as good, if not gold-plated. But it's not 
the opposing Democrats who are his biggest worry; it's his friends, 
a Republican party too much in the grip of zealots and extremists.

<P>
	The Spokesman-Review, Spokane, Wash., on direct-mail sweepstakes  
</P>
<P>
	You, too, can be rich. Here's how: Rip off lonely, elderly  
people. They don't get much personal mail from people who actually 
care about them. But you can make them think you care. You can send 
them computer-generated junk mail, inserting their names in big 
black letters and announcing they'll win millions if they will 
return an enclosed sweepstakes form. 
</P>
<P>
	It's a scummy way to make a living but it works.  
</P>
<P>
	Recently, the U.S. Senate held a hearing on legislation cracking  
down on the direct-mail sweepstakes business. The legislation would 
outlaw misleading statements and require that the fine print be 
displayed more prominently. ... 
</P>
<P>
	But there's a better way to shut these predators down: Never,  
ever, send them money. Don't buy magazine subscriptions you don't 
need from junk mail you didn't request. Above all, if some has-been 
TV star you've never met sends you a personal note congratulating 
you on your new status as multimillionaire, don't be a sucker. Dick 
Clark and Ed McMahon aren't trying to make you rich. They're trying 
to make themselves richer. They want your money. ... 

</P>
<P>
	March 13  
</P>
<P>
	Las Cruces (N.M.) Sun-News, on welfare reform:  
</P>
<P>
	Welfare reform is putting a lot of pressure on local private  
businesses to create jobs. The businesses didn't ask for that 
pressure. 
</P>
<P>
	But as the Sun-News reported recently, the realities of federal  
and state welfare restructuring are critical and severe, and the 
time element allows little leeway for dealing with this major 
social issue. 
</P>
<P>
	The real story in the next few years will be told in human  
terms, very individualistic ones in which real people -- some of our 
friends and neighbors -- are suddenly off of public assistance and 
reliant upon jobs -- many of which don't now exist -- to support 
themselves and their families. ... 
</P>
<P>
	Politically driven reform has thus reached the point where the  
rubber hits the road. Government agencies and well-meaning panels 
of people cannot cope with this problem alone. 
</P>
<P>
	Private business owners are being challenged as they never have  
before to look closely at their own organizations to see how hiring 
people coming off the welfare rolls could help their businesses 
grow, while at the same time helping people who need a break. 

</P>
<P>
	March 12  
</P>
<P>
	The (Portland) Oregonian, on Chinese espionage:  
</P>
<P>
	What went wrong? Did Clinton administration officials downplay  
Chinese espionage at Los Alamos Laboratory for diplomatic or 
political reasons? Or was the administration's seeming laxity 
simply a matter of ineptitude? 
</P>
<P>
	Either explanation is profoundly troublesome after the firing of  
a Chinese-American scientist at Los Alamos. 
</P>
<P>
	It's up to Congress to ferret out a credible explanation, and  
Clinton's team should provide its fullest cooperation, no matter 
how embarrassing that may turn out to be. 
</P>
<P>
	Secretary of State Madeleine Albright says ``this very serious  
issue'' must not dominate efforts to stay engaged with China. But 
it's precisely because this relationship is so important to the 
United States and the world that the issue must be faced head on. 
...

</P>
<P>
	March 17  
</P>
<P>
	Le Monde, Paris, on European Union:  
</P>
<P>
	Jacques Santer's team at the European Commission had no choice  
but to resign. This marks the beginning of the biggest 
institutional crisis Europe has known in the 42 years since the 
community was born. 
</P>
<P>
	The collective resignations offer an unprecedented chance to  
reconcile morale, efficiency, ethics, democracy, dynamics and 
transparency. 
</P>
<P>
	Heavily burdened by rules and tarnished by scandals, Europe  
could finally undergo a political revival. 
</P>
<P>
	The biggest mistake Brussels made was to underestimate the  
evolution of the European public's mood. 
</P>
<P>
	``Eurocritical'' but not Europhobe, the public demands more of  
the Union's institutions than of its own governments. 
</P>
<P>
	The public wants an irreproachable commission. It feels the  
commission has for a long time tried to cover up internal scandals. 
</P>
<P>
	With the changing of the guard in Brussels, it is time for  
everybody to meet their responsibilities. The future commission 
should streamline administration and finances and improve the 
decision-making process. 

</P>
<P>
	March 17  
</P>
<P>
	The Mirror, London, on European Union:  
</P>
<P>
	The worst argument for the European Union is the way it is run.  
It has never recovered from how it was set up 40 years ago. ... The 
Eurocrats have been allowed to carry on as they wished, arrogantly 
refusing to consider the intersts of member states and recklessly 
wasting their money. Now it has blown up in their faces. 
</P>
<P>
	What is needed is a revolution. Not to undermine the European  
ideal, but to strengthen it. 
</P>
<P>
	This scandal gives national governments the chance to change the  
EU forever. The European Parliament has already made a start by 
acting with toughness and determination for the first time. 
</P>
<P>
	This is a black moment for the European Union and there is no  
point in pretending otherwise. But it gives the chance of sweeping 
away the mess of the past so there can be a fresh start. 

</P>
<P>
	March 17  
</P>
<P>
	The Sun, London, on European Commission:  
</P>
<P>
	The European Commission is a mighty big barrel. And a lot of its  
apples are rotten. There is no point trying to save any of them. 
...
</P>
<P>
	Now the 20 commissioners have resigned in the hope that most of  
them will be offered their jobs back. What an appalling mistake 
that would be. The president, Jacques Santer, isn't fit to be in 
charge of a stall selling frogs' legs. His smug rejection of the 
charges against the Commission was outrageous. 
</P>
<P>
	The Euro elite and their cronies must never rule again.  

</P>
<P>
	March 17  
</P>
<P>
	The Daily Mail, London, on European Commission:  
</P>
<P>
	How indicative that even now, the wretched Jacques Santer cannot  
bring himself to admit the slightest fault. ... His egregious 
arrogance stands as a monument to the rottenness at the heart of 
Europe. All the heady hopes which once lent a certain grandeur to 
the federalist project now lie buried under the tawdry evidence of 
sleaze, cronyism and contempt for the basic standards of public 
life. 
</P>
<P>
	Is there a realistic chance of a new beginning? It takes an  
almost heroic optimism to believe that the stables can be cleaned. 

</P>
<P>
	March 17  
</P>
<P>
	The Sydney (Australia) Morning Herald, on European Union:  
</P>
<P>
	The resignation of all 20 members of the European Union's  
executive commission is a dramatic way for the many to take 
collective responsibility for the failings of some. But why wasn't 
a different kind of responsibility -- steady and unspectacular -- 
seen earlier, and instead? 
</P>
<P>
	The committee of experts' report on fraud, mismanagement and  
nepotism in the European Union shows an organization insufficiently 
restrained by internal sanctions against inefficiency and waste. 
</P>
<P>
	The inquiry found that it was ``becoming difficult to find  
anyone who has even the slightest sense of responsibility'' adding 
``the temptation to deprive the concept of responsibility of all 
substance is a dangerous one. That concept is the ultimate 
manifestation of democracy.'' It is a sorry indictment of an 
organization that was supposed to be a shining light, overriding 
petty nationalism and showing the way of the future that this 
inquiry would find it necessary to restate such a simple, 
fundamental truth. 

</P>
<P>
	March 17  
</P>
<P>
	The Irish Times, Dublin, on St. Patrick:  
</P>
<P>
	... There have been many aspects of our traditional celebration  
of St. Patrick which failed to reflect the character of the man -- 
or the men -- who brought Christianity to this island. The Christian 
community he founded divided into a number of larger churches and a 
myriad of sub-groups. Catholics and Protestants have seen St. 
Patrick uniquely as their own and they have staked their rival 
claims accordingly down the centuries, often in the most bitter, 
exclusivist terms. It is only in the most recent times that they 
have begun to recognize that Patrick can be a unifying figure, a 
symbol of common historical experience, rather than a focus of 
rivalry.... 
</P>
<P>
	It is a paradox -- a positive one -- that the feast which once  
marked some of the sharpest collision points between the Irish 
churches and between differing Irish identities should now become 
the focus of political rapprochement in Washington -- even as it 
develops into a great public celebration, spread over a number of 
days, at home. Differing strands of the Irish people are coming 
closer together. In spite of the wickedness and cruelty of the 
gunmen and the bombers, there is a gradual taking down of barriers 
and a growing hope that we will face the future in harmony and 
cooperation. St. Patrick -- both of him -- would surely approve and 
give his blessing. 

</P>
<P>
	March 15  
</P>
<P>
	Der Bund, Zurich, Switzerland, on the Kosovo talks:  
</P>
<P>
	Perhaps the western mediators have acted for too long as if  
there is a political solution for the various Balkan conflicts. 
They strove for democratization, to build a civil society, to 
strengthen the moderates -- NATO diplomats can use pacifist 
terminology too. 
</P>
<P>
	But the citizens didn't go along with it. In the Republika  
Srpska they elected the nationalist Nikola Poplasen as president, 
and he is now fighting against his dismissal by the international 
official Carlos Westendorp who says he is Milosevic's henchman. ... 
</P>
<P>
	In Kosovo, where Milosevic had taken away the economic and  
political future from the Albanian majority, the result was an 
uncompromising Albanian nationalism. ... 
</P>
<P>
	NATO's compromise solution -- autonomy but for the moment no  
independence for Kosovo -- is at best supported by the Kosovo 
Liberation Army for tactical reasons. ... 
</P>
<P>
	And the second round of Kosovo negotiations ... will end without  
a political solution. At the most, it will succeed in forcing a 
ceasefire -- but then only if NATO doesn't put its credibility at 
risk with empty threats. 

</P>
<P>
	March 15  
</P>
<P>
	Clarin, Buenos Aires, on landmines treaty:  
</P>
<P>
	With the entry into force of an international treaty to ban  
landmines, a small but significant step has been taken for peace 
and international security. The more than 100 million mines 
scattered throughout the world are one of the most ominous 
testaments to a century of wars of annihilation and of massive 
death. ... In Latin America, a great quantity of these landmines 
remain, still causing mourning and anguish today. The treaty's 
implemention is a significant expression of the advances toward a 
civil world order ... but steps remain, including the adhesion to 
the treaty of the Unied States, Russia and China, among others.

<P>
	La Repubblica, Rome, on Castro's repression of dissidents:  
</P>
<P>
	It is now evident that Fidel Castro's opening-up-to-the-world  
policy was little more than a request of Pope John Paul II and 
never turned into something concrete. 
</P>
<P>
	The Pope's visit to Cuba in January 1998 gave free rein to the  
enthusiasm of those who believed that the Cuban regime was headed 
towards a greater respect for civil, religious and political 
liberties. ... 
</P>
<P>
	The whole world began to open up, without realizing that the  
routine repression of dissidents continued. Four innocents, who had 
dared pronounce the forbidden word -- liberty -- had been in jail for 
months, unnoticed by the world. 
</P>
<P>
	The regime has gone too far this time.  
</P>
<P>
	The trial behind closed doors, the guilty sentences were too  
much even for those willing to give credit to the regime. 
</P>
<P>
	Now it's back to square one for Castro and probably back to a  
new long phase of isolation.

<HEADLINE> Dow Is Synonymous With Wall Street </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- If it's just 30 stocks, why do people still talk  
about the Dow Jones industrial average like it's the entire stock 
market? 
</P>
<P>
	Well, when it comes to stock indexes, it pays to be first and it  
helps to have your own newspaper. 
</P>
<P>
	The Dow was created in 1896 by Charles Dow, co-founder of Dow  
Jones &AMP; Co., and soon became a permanent fixture in the company's 
fledgling newspaper. The Wall Street Journal is now the world's 
most influential business publication. 
</P>
<P>
	It wasn't until 1928 that Standard &AMP; Poor's introduced a broader  
stock index tracking the nation's 90 biggest companies. The 
now-familiar Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 stock index was born nearly 30 
years later, in 1957, when the ``S&AMP;P 90'' was expanded to include 
the 500 biggest companies. 
</P>
<P>
	While the Dow also grew in the early days -- from 12 stocks to 20  
in 1916, and then to 30 in 1928 -- the editors of The Wall Street 
Journal haven't changed the number since. 
</P>
<P>
	Naturally, an index consisting of just 30 companies might seem  
like an odd way to measure a market with more than 10,000 stocks. 
</P>
<P>
	It's not that the Dow is inconsequential. Those 30 companies  
have a combined market value of more than $2.5 trillion, or about 
one-fifth of the roughly $12 trillion value of all U.S. stocks. 
</P>
<P>
	Some experts point out that the blue-chip names in the Dow are  
major players in at least 70 businesses. General Electric alone is 
a leader in a dozen different industries. 
</P>
<P>
	And despite their vast size difference, the Dow and the S&AMP;P 500  
almost always move in tandem. 
</P>
<P>
	``On any given day, the pace of the stroll is different, but  
directionally, they tend to walk the same walk,'' said Charles G. 
Crane, chief market strategist at Key Asset Management. 
</P>
<P>
	But the Dow hardly reflects every facet of the U.S. economy, at  
least not as well as the S&AMP;P 500 -- whose 500 companies have a 
combined market value of about $10.5 trillion. 
</P>
<P>
	In fact, the S&AMP;P 500 is to Wall Street what the Dow is to Main  
Street. The S&AMP;P is the yardstick against which mutual funds and 
investment pros are compared. 
</P>
<P>
	Individual investors have $750 billion tied up in mutual funds  
that mimic the S&AMP;P 500. Nonetheless, people rarely pay homage to 
its numerical milestones like they do for the Dow. 
</P>
<P>
	When the S&AMP;P 500 crossed 1,000 for the first time in February  
1998, there was no fanfare like the one accompanying the Dow's 
assault on 10,000. 
</P>
<P>
	A frequent complaint about the Dow is that its membership is  
restricted to companies that trade on the New York Stock Exchange. 
</P>
<P>
	Thanks to that residency requirement, the Dow is not open to  
Microsoft, Intel and Cisco Systems, the mammoth technology 
companies that dominate the Nasdaq Stock Market. 
</P>
<P>
	While the Dow's two technology components, IBM and  
Hewlett-Packard, hold considerable sway in the world of computers, 
some contend the Dow is Internet-deficient. 
</P>
<P>
	Analysts, however, caution against the hasty addition of an  
Internet company like America Online. 
</P>
<P>
	``If it's five years down the pike and AOL or one of its cousins  
is truly reshaping the way America is doing business, (an Internet 
stock) could easily be added,'' said Charles G. Crane, chief market 
strategist at Key Asset Management. 
</P>
<P>
	In the meantime, the Dow will just have to rely on the  
substantial cyber forays of IBM, H-P, GE, Disney and AT&AMP;T.

<HEADLINE> Teen Loses Ear in Angry Scuffle </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TAVERNIER, Fla. (AP) -- A man bit off part of a teen-ager's ear  
in a fight that started with a traffic dispute, authorities say. 
</P>
<P>
	Lazaro Enrique Vento, a 33-year-old house painter, was charged  
Tuesday with aggravated battery and causing an accident. 
</P>
<P>
	Sheriff's Deputy Phil Graham said he arrived to find 18-year-old  
Derek Crawford pressing a flannel shirt to his right ear and 
holding the torn piece in his hand. 
</P>
<P>
	``It wasn't just a little bite. It's a good-size chunk. Mike  
Tyson would be impressed,'' Graham said. 
</P>
<P>
	Doctors were unable to reattach the piece.  
</P>
<P>
	Police said the argument began on the highway, with Vento  
accusing Crawford of tailgating. The fight spilled over to a 
parking lot, where Vento rammed Crawford's pickup truck with his 
own, deputies said.

<HEADLINE> Expelled IOC Members Speak Out </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LAUSANNE, Switzerland (AP) -- His voice cracking with emotion,  
Paul Wallwork couldn't suppress his feeling of betrayal toward the 
organization that had just kicked him out. 
</P>
<P>
	``It really hurts,'' said the former Samoan weightlifter, one of  
six members expelled Wednesday from the International Olympic 
Committee. ``I can't explain how painful it is. It's something I 
put my life into.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``They are probably sacrificing me to purge the IOC, to tell the  
world there is cleansing going on,'' he said. ``That is sad. I am 
the proverbial sacrifical lamb.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Wallwork then turned his ire on Dick Pound, the head of the IOC  
inquiry panel which investigated the Salt Lake City bribery 
scandal. 
</P>
<P>
	Pound's commission recommended that Wallwork be ousted because  
his wife received a $30,000 loan from Salt Lake bid chief Tom 
Welch. Wallwork said he was unaware of the loan, which was repaid. 
</P>
<P>
	Noting that Pound's wife was arrested in a scuffle with police  
during the 1996 Atlanta Games, Wallwork said, ``Was he made 
responsible for his wife? Yet he sat at the head of the (inquiry) 
committee.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Wallwork said Pound should be investigated for receiving a  
family tree from the Mormon Church in Salt Lake City. 
</P>
<P>
	``When you accept a $40,000 gift from the Mormon Church, you're  
crazy,'' Wallwork said. ``How can you do a thing like that?'' 
</P>
<P>
	Pound has denied any wrongdoing and said he received the family  
tree after Salt Lake City won the games. 
</P>
<P>
	While Wallwork was the only of the six expelled members to  
attack the IOC leaders, Ecuador's Agustin Arroyo lauded IOC 
president Juan Antonio Samaranch for spreading the Olympic spirit 
to the world. 
</P>
<P>
	He ruled out any legal challenge to undo his exclusion, saying,  
``Action against the IOC, no matter how wrong? No.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``The public and the press wanted to have heads knocked down.  
Mine happened to be in the way,'' Arroyo said, looking weak and 
fragile in an unrelenting media crush. 
</P>
<P>
	Jean-Claude Ganga of the Republic of Congo, the most powerful of  
the six as president of Africa's national Olympic committees and 
long expected to take on the IOC over his expulsion, was 
surprisingly moderate in his response. 
</P>
<P>
	Ganga spoke of ``sporting goodwill -- good winners, good  
losers.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Only one emotion united the six on their final day as IOC  
members. 
</P>
<P>
	``There was a massive vote of confidence in the president of the  
IOC ... and the consequences of it is that some members have been 
sacrificed,'' said Lamine Keita of Mali as got into a cab for the 
airport. 
</P>
<P>
	The expelled members leave behind an Olympic lifestyle of  
first-class travel, the poshest hotels and assured reverence from 
every city bidding to stage the games. 
</P>
<P>
	Ganga made his farewell statement from a gilded, throne-like  
chair in the marble lobby of the Palace Hotel, the members' home in 
this wealthy city on Lake Geneva and a symbol of Olympic opulence. 
</P>
<P>
	Other IOC members were milling around the lobby, but many  
ostracized the six. Voting to expel them, however, still hurt. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was very difficult to vote, but there was just no other  
way,'' said Monaco's Prince Albert. 
</P>
<P>
	The six all come from poor nations, raising claims the IOC took  
the easy way out by pouncing on the powerless while leaving the 
mighty untouched. 
</P>
<P>
	``It probably happened because Chile is a small country,'' said  
Santander. 
</P>
<P>
	Few countries come smaller than the Pacific island of Samoa.  
</P>
<P>
	``It's unfair because of the double standard that was applied,''  
Wallwork said. ``If I had an inkling of how this was going to 
happen, I would have resigned four weeks ago.''

<HEADLINE> NFL Brings Back Instant Replay </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PHOENIX (AP) -- Upon further and further and further review,  
instant replay is back in the NFL for the 1999 season. 
</P>
<P>
	The league's owners, who had killed replay every year for the  
last seven, overwhelmingly approved a new system Wednesday that 
will give coaches two challenges per game, with ``a replay 
assistant'' to determine if something is to be reviewed in the 
final two minutes of each half. 
</P>
<P>
	The referee on the field will make the final decision.  
</P>
<P>
	But unlike the system in effect from 1986-91, it's not intended  
to cover routine mistakes. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are implementing this system to correct the major, major,  
big mistake,'' said Seattle coach Mike Holmgren, cochairman of the 
competition committee, which came up with the plan. 
</P>
<P>
	The action comes after a season marked by several high-profile  
mistakes. It even led commissioner Paul Tagliabue to propose 
bringing it back for the playoffs, a move that was turned down. 
</P>
<P>
	Wednesday's vote was 28-3, the most overwhelming vote for replay  
since it first came up in 1986. The three ``no'' votes came from 
Cincinnati, the New York Jets and Arizona, while the New York 
Giants, who had voted against it every year, were among the ``yes'' 
votes. 
</P>
<P>
	That was primarily the reason why replay wasn't put in for  
longer than one year. 
</P>
<P>
	``There were several teams that were traditionally against it  
that voted for it this time,'' said the other cochairman, Rich 
McKay of Tampa Bay, another team that was often against replay. 
``They wanted to see how it works for a year before we put it in 
for a longer period.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Under the system to be used, coaches will have to act in the 40  
seconds between the time a play ends and the ball is put back into 
play again to make the challenge. All said they would rely on word 
from an assistant upstairs. 
</P>
<P>
	``That won't be a problem,'' Holmgren said. ``We always get five  
voices at once shouting, `Yell at someone.' '' 
</P>
<P>
	The referee on the field will then review the play. If he turns  
down the challenge, the team making it will lose a time out. If he 
upholds the challenge, the team will retain the time out. 
</P>
<P>
	In the final two minutes of each half, the replay assistant --  
probably a retired official -- will stop the game if he sees a call 
that might be challenged, and the same procedure will be followed. 
The replay assistant's challenge will extend into any overtime. 
</P>
<P>
	That idea, which swayed the final votes to get over the total of  
24 needed for approval, came from commissioner Paul Tagliabue. 
</P>
<P>
	``The main thing the coaches objected to was the last two  
minutes,'' Tagliabue said. 
</P>
<P>
	So he proposed the system in which the last two minutes of each  
half would be overseen by the replay assistant. 
</P>
<P>
	He added that George Young, the league's vice president for  
football operations, then told him that might break the logjam and 
get the votes. As general manager of the Giants and cochairman of 
the competition committee, Young had been replay's most steadfast 
opponent. 
</P>
<P>
	The coaches were overwhelmingly for it.  
</P>
<P>
	``There will be a lot of strategy for us to think about,'' said  
Wade Phillips of Buffalo, one of the teams hurt most last season by 
calls that were later found to be incorrect. ``We'll be doing a lot 
of studying. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's not likely we're going to challenge something in the  
middle of the field in the second quarter,'' Holmgren said. 
</P>
<P>
	``If someone tells me our receiver was in on a 10-yard play on  
which he was ruled out in the second quarter, I'd probably let it 
go. But if it's something that can get us points, then we'd 
challenge.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Replay will be like the old system -- applicable to goal-line and  
sideline plays and possession, but not to penalties. 
</P>
<P>
	The league also put off a decision on the $800 million sale of  
the Washington Redskins to Howard and Edward Milstein and until 
early April. Tagliabue said there weren't enough votes to approve 
the sale. 
</P>
<P>
	The only other rule change was on clipping near the line of  
scrimmage, which now will apply all over the field. In the past, 
clipping was legal in a small area between the tackles near the 
line of scrimmage. 
</P>
<P>
	The owners also formally took away the 2003 Super Bowl from San  
Francisco and invited San Diego, south Florida and other locations 
to submit bids. 
</P>
<P>
	That game could be the first Super Bowl played in February.

	Reno To Oppose Counsel Law  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Attorney General Janet Reno will  
``reluctantly'' oppose extending the law governing independent 
counsels when she testifies before a Senate committee today, 
Justice Department sources said. The Justice Department reversed 
course in recent weeks to oppose another five-year extension for 
the independent counsel law. Reno concluded the 21-year-old 
Independent Counsel Act is fundamentally flawed and should be 
scrapped rather than subjected to congressional tinkering, sources 
familiar with her testimony said yesterday.

	Amtrak Accident Investigated  
</P>
<P>
	BOURBONNAIS, Ill. (AP) -- Federal investigators are hoping the  
driver of a truck and the engineer of an Amtrak train that slammed 
into the semitrailer loaded with steel can explain why the vehicle 
was straddling the tracks at the time of the accident. Authorities 
say the crossing gates were down and the signal lights were 
flashing red when the collision occurred, killing at least 13 
people and injuring 100 at a rural crossing 50 miles south of 
Chicago. At least three people are still missing and feared dead.

were unarmed civilians. But the report by the Finnish team stopped 
short of calling the killings a massacre or directly blaming the 
Serbs. The sensitive report was released amid an ominous buildup of 
Yugoslav forces in Kosovo and with the two sides deadlocked at a 
second round of peace talks that continued today in Paris.

leader David Trimble and Sinn Fein leader Gerry Adams -- were

<HEADLINE> Mrs. Clinton Takes to Internet </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Hillary Rodham Clinton took to the Internet to  
promote reading and her new book about Socks and Buddy. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Clinton chatted in an America Online session late Tuesday  
evening. But politics wasn't the subject: Instead, parents, 
teachers and a few children asked Mrs. Clinton about the book, 
``Dear Socks, Dear Buddy: Kids' Letters to the First Pets.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``We should realize that literacy is not just reading, but also  
writing,'' Mrs. Clinton wrote in her chat session. Writing ``helps 
a child's language development, helps them formulate ideas and 
improves vocabulary.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Focusing on the lighter side of life at the White House, the  
book was inspired by the 300,000 annual letters sent to Socks, a 
black-and-white domestic shorthair cat, and newcomer Buddy, a 
chocolate Labrador retriever. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Clinton explained how the pets' letters are answered by  
local military retirees, and how Socks and Buddy do their White 
House jobs, such as greeting guests and visiting children's 
hospitals and nursing homes. 
</P>
<P>
	It was the first time Mrs. Clinton's has held a chatting session  
online, and it drew at least 23,000 browsers. 
</P>
<P>
	Even though it started at 10 p.m. EST, past many children's  
bedtimes on the East Coast, some children stayed up for the chat. 
</P>
<P>
	``I LOVE MRS. CLINTON AND I AM 7 YEARS OLD,'' read one message.  
</P>
<P>
	The questions, selected in advance, were mostly from people  
identifying themselves as teachers and parents and focused on 
education. 
</P>
<P>
	Many chatters speculated among themselves about Mrs. Clinton's  
prospects for the Senate seat she has been courted to seek. ``She 
could be good for the state's children,'' wrote one. 
</P>
<P>
	``Dear Socks, Dear Buddy'' includes a pet history of the White  
House, from Dolley Madison's parrot, who escaped a British attack 
on the White House, to the Bushes' English springer spaniel Millie, 
who also has a book. 
</P>
<P>
	The Socks and Buddy book, the royalties from which are donated  
to the National Park Service Foundation, reprints 50 letters from 
children nationwide and includes more than 80 photographs of the 
pets in the Oval Office, on the lawn and even in the pool. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't think Socks and Buddy know that anyone in the White  
House is a VIP other than them,'' she wrote. 
</P>
<P>
	She recounted the family's semi-successful efforts to get cat  
used to dog: ``Bill has worked hard to bring peace to many parts of 
the world and was determined that Buddy and Socks would get along. 
... I guess you could say they are living in a state of peaceful 
but uneasy coexistence.''

<HEADLINE> Amtrak Accident Investigated </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BOURBONNAIS, Ill. (AP) -- It is a railroad crossing that is  
supposed to be as safe as any in the country, one with modern 
crossing gates and flashing lights and three decades of relative 
peace. 
</P>
<P>
	Authorities insist those gates were down and the signal lights  
were flashing red when an Amtrak train slammed into a semitrailer 
loaded with steel Monday night in the nation's deadliest railroad 
accident since 1993. 
</P>
<P>
	At least 13 people were killed and more than 100 injured.  
</P>
<P>
	Federal investigators were hoping the engineer and the truck  
driver will be able to explain why the truck was straddling the 
tracks. 
</P>
<P>
	``There have been reports that possibly this truck went around  
the gates and we are trying to determine if that's what happened,'' 
John Goglia of the National Transportation Safety Board said late 
Tuesday. He told the ``Today'' show this morning that investigators 
were checking tire tracks that went around the gates to see if they 
matched the truck. 
</P>
<P>
	``We will pursue this with vigor to determine if this is a  
signal problem or if in fact we have a driver problem,'' Goglia 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	There were 217 people on board the City of New Orleans when it  
crashed Monday night at a rural crossing 50 miles south of Chicago. 
At least three people were still missing and feared dead in the 
scorched and twisted wreckage. 
</P>
<P>
	Truck driver John Stokes, 58, told investigators that he didn't  
see the train approach and that the warning lights started flashing 
after he started across the tracks near a Birmingham Steel Co. 
mill. 
</P>
<P>
	Stokes was driving on a probationary license after receiving  
three speeding tickets in a year, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
	Amtrak's chairman, Wisconsin Gov. Tommy Thompson, said Stokes  
was trying to dodge the crossing gates, thinking the oncoming train 
was a slow-moving freight train instead of a faster passenger 
train. 
</P>
<P>
	``The engineer said he saw the lights flashing, he saw the  
barriers down and then he saw the truck stop and try to get around 
it,'' Thompson said. ``There was no way to avoid it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Both Stokes and the engineer were questioned Tuesday, but  
investigators said the engineer was taking medication as a result 
of the crash and had trouble answering questions. 
</P>
<P>
	Goglia said that a breath test of the truck driver showed no  
sign of alcohol, but that investigators were still waiting on blood 
and urine tests. 
</P>
<P>
	The two-locomotive train pulling 14 cars smashed into the truck  
and then into two rail cars on a siding. The cars jackknifed and 
piled up behind the locomotives over a quarter-mile, with leaking 
diesel fuel erupting in flames. 
</P>
<P>
	Those killed were in a double-decker sleeping car. Authorities  
said a locomotive ripped into the car, crushing some passengers and 
setting the car ablaze. 
</P>
<P>
	Goglia, who is in charge of the NTSB investigation, said the  
black box in the lead locomotive showed the train was moving at 79 
mph -- the legal maximum -- just before the crash. He also said the 
engineer was blowing his whistle and trying to stop the train. 
</P>
<P>
	A private study released last month found that more than 80  
percent of the nation's railroad crossings -- about 130,000 -- lack 
gates and light signals to warn pedestrians and motorists of 
trains. 
</P>
<P>
	But near the Bourbonnais crash site, two gates block the narrow  
two-lane road, which provides access to the nearby mill. The gates 
and lights at the crossing appear to have been functioning at the 
time of the crash, said David Farrell, a spokesman for the Illinois 
Commerce Commission. 
</P>
<P>
	Mike Stead, head of rail safety at the ICC, said the gates were  
intact, and authorities have not been able to verify where the 
truck was at the time of impact or when the gates were lowered. 
</P>
<P>
	Sensors turn on the lights and bells 26 seconds before a train  
reaches the crossing, and five seconds later the gates come down, 
Farrell said. Officials said the gates did not malfunction and were 
last inspected Feb. 24. 
</P>
<P>
	There have been three deaths at the crossing in the last 35  
years, in 1964, 1968 and 1988. Forty trains and 1,800 vehicles use 
the crossing daily. 
</P>
<P>
	NTSB officials said they would also investigate whether a rail  
car on a siding north of the crash site may have blocked the truck 
driver's view. 
</P>
<P>
	Authorities have not released the names of the victims. The  
Commercial Appeal in Memphis reported today that the victims 
included a woman and three children from Nesbit, Miss., who were 
returning from a doll show in Chicago. 
</P>
<P>
	June Bonnin, 47; her 12-year-old granddaughter, Jessica  
Whitaker; Rainy Lipscomb, 10; and Lacey Lipscomb, 8, were killed. 
Another girl, Bonnin's daughter, was injured. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was to be a dream trip for the little girls,'' said  
Bonnin's husband, Max. ``It turned out to be a nightmare.''

<HEADLINE> Price Returning to Georgia Tech </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ATLANTA (AP) -- Mark Price, who retired last month after a  
12-year NBA career, returned to Georgia Tech as an assistant coach 
on Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Price was the first big-time recruit to join Bobby Cremins'  
program in 1983, leading the Yellow Jackets from the bottom of the 
Atlantic Coast Conference to a tournament championship two years 
later. 
</P>
<P>
	He was a three-time NBA All-Star during a playing career spent  
primarily with the Cleveland Cavaliers. Price, 35, maintained a 
home in Atlanta after his graduation from Georgia Tech in 1986. 
</P>
<P>
	An opening was created on the Georgia Tech staff when Frank  
Beall, the director of basketball operations, went into private 
business. Assistant Gary Leiner will assume Beall's non-coaching 
duties, with Price likely to fill Leiner's spot on Cremins' staff.

<HEADLINE> Eagles' Reid Knows Quarterbacks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PHOENIX (AP) -- Andy Reid, who worked with Brett Favre as  
quarterbacks coach of the Green Bay Packers, knows he can get a 
quality player at the position now that he's head coach of the 
Philadelphia Eagles. Philadelphia has the second pick in a draft 
deep in quarterbacks. 
</P>
<P>
	Although he doesn't rule out drafting Heisman Trophy-winning  
running back Ricky Williams, Reid on Wednesday sounded as if he's 
thinking quarterback. Here's his quick assessment of some top 
candidates: 
</P>
<P>
	-- Tim Couch of Kentucky: ``He has plenty of arm to play in the  
NFL, so it's not necessarily a negative that he doesn't have as 
strong an arm as some others. He has great touch on the football 
for intermediate and short routes. They didn't ask him to throw 
downfield, but he can do that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	-- Akili Smith of Oregon: ``Akili is upbeat, sharp and  
articulate. He's not afraid to laugh. Some of these guys feel like 
they have to put up a facade. He loosened up right away. 
</P>
<P>
	``He has a big arm and confidence and is very athletic.''  
</P>
<P>
	-- Donovan McNabb of Syracuse: ``He might be the best athlete and  
might have the strongest arm of the bunch. He doesn't come from a 
pro-style offense. I'm very impressed with the smarts of Donovan 
McNabb, and his athletic ability intrigues me.'' 
</P>
<P>
	-- Daunte Culpepper of Central Florida: ``He has unbelieveable  
size and, at 250 (pounds) he ran a 4.5 40. He's a strong-armed guy 
who did not have to move much, but we know he can do that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	-- Cade McNown of UCLA -- ``He's different physically and  
size-wise. I think he will be a tremendous quarterback in the NFL. 
I think he will come in and win a lot.'' 
</P>
<P>
	As for which one he favors, Reid didn't say. But he admitted the  
class is deep enough that he might consider trading out of the 
second spot, although not low enough to miss out on one of the top 
QBs. 
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	 *CAREFUL REEVES:* Atlanta Falcons coach Dan Reeves said that  
after Eugene Robinson was arrested for solicitation the night 
before the Super Bowl in Miami, he wanted to find Reggie White, 
Robinson's former teammate in Green Bay, to counsel him. ``I knew 
Reggie was in town, but we couldn't track him down.'' Reeves said 
of White, an ordained minister. 
</P>
<P>
	Asked what he thought Robinson was thinking when he went out on  
the eve of the game. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't think Eugene was thinking at all,'' Reeves said. ``He  
even went to the commissioner's party the night before. I never 
heard of a player going to that. It's the worst party going.'' 
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	 *BORN TO COACH:* Dick Jauron has known since childhood he'd be a  
football coach. He just never expected to play in the NFL. 
</P>
<P>
	Jauron, the new coach of the Chicago Bears, went to Yale, where  
he starred in baseball and football. He turned down the St. Louis 
Cardinals to try the NFL with Detroit, where he played five seasons 
before moving to the Cincinnati Bengals. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1985, Jauron began his pro coaching career with Buffalo and  
eventually became defensive coordinator at Jacksonville. The Bears 
hired him after the fiasco with Dave McGinnis, whom the team 
announced as its coach before he agreed to a deal. 
</P>
<P>
	``I never thought about playing after college, but I can say now  
I always knew I'd coach,'' Jauron said. ``When a playing career 
happened, it was a break for me. It put the game in a better 
perspective for me and what the game meant, and it gave me more 
time to think about what I'd like to do after the game. 
</P>
<P>
	``It ended at 31 for me, and I said to my wife that I knew I  
wanted to coach. So when Buffalo called, I said, `This is the 
time.' I never had a goal to play professional football. I never 
made a plan to coach or play, but I knew coaching is a part of 
me.'' 
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	 *HIRING PRACTICES:* Dennis Green says owners go about hiring  
coaches the wrong way. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's all on who's the hot coordinator,'' the Minnesota Vikings  
coach said. ``I can tell you who the next five coaches will be.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Green, one of the NFL's three black head coaches, said the key  
element is an ability to communicate with people, particularly an 
owner and general manager. 
</P>
<P>
	Was that the reason, he was asked, there are so few minority  
coaches, given that all the owners and most executives are white. 
</P>
<P>
	``No,'' Green replied. ``The white coaches get fired in two  
years, just like everyone else.''

<HEADLINE> Weapons Labs Get New Security </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Energy Secretary Bill Richardson imposed new  
security measures for national weapons laboratories Wednesday and 
ordered an internal investigation into whether a department 
official was prevented from briefing Congress on alleged Chinese 
espionage. 
</P>
<P>
	Richardson outlined the new measures in a closed-door hearing of  
the Senate Intelligence Committee as the Clinton administration 
moved on several fronts to blunt criticism that it was slow to 
respond to the espionage threat. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's plenty of blame to go around,'' Richardson told  
reporters. ``This started during the Reagan-Bush years. ... There 
are also problems on our side.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The committee was questioning Richardson on how the  
administration responded when it first learned of an inquiry into 
the alleged Chinese theft of top-secret nuclear warhead technology 
from the Los Alamos National Laboratory in the 1980s. 
</P>
<P>
	``China did get information relating to the W-88 which is  
damaging to our national security,'' Richardson said. ``The extent 
of that damage is not yet known.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Intelligence officials first learned of the apparent security  
breach in 1995 and an FBI investigation began in early 1996. A 
scientist at Los Alamos in New Mexico was fired March 8 after being 
the target of the FBI investigation. He has not been charged with 
any crime. 
</P>
<P>
	Richardson rejected a proposal by Sen. Richard Shelby, R-Ala.,  
chairman of the Intelligence Committee, that the administration 
impose a moratorium on exchange programs involving lab scientists 
going overseas and foreign scientists coming to the labs. 
</P>
<P>
	``The foreign visitors program is important to our national  
security,'' Richardson said. ``We want Russian scientists to know 
how they should control their nuclear weapons. ... Let's not get 
hysterical and overreach.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Shelby, emerging later from the closed-door meeting, said no one  
was getting hysterical and that the issue was not being 
politicized. 
</P>
<P>
	``This isn't about Democrats or Republicans,'' Shelby said. He  
questioned whether the security measures imposed by Richardson, 
particularly on electronic mail, would provide sufficient 
protection. And he called the espionage case the most serious to 
come to his attention since he's been on the intelligence 
committee. 
</P>
<P>
	Earlier Wednesday, Gary Samore, the senior White House official  
in charge of nuclear proliferation issues, defended the Clinton 
administration's steps to protect the labs. 
</P>
<P>
	``This administration has done more to strengthen lab security  
in the past year than all previous administrations have done in the 
past 20 years. We did not duck this issue,'' Samore said in a forum 
at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace. 
</P>
<P>
	Richardson said he was directing a formal inquiry into  
allegations that a senior department counterintelligence officer 
had been prevented from disclosing to Congress his concerns about 
the security breach at Los Alamos. 
</P>
<P>
	According to published reports, Notra Trulock, a senior  
intelligence officer at the department, had said he had been 
prevented from sharing information with Congress about the Los 
Alamos investigation by Elizabeth Moler, then deputy energy 
secretary. 
</P>
<P>
	Moler, who became deputy energy secretary in July 1997 and for a  
time in 1998 was acting energy secretary before Richardson's 
arrival, reportedly has denied ever making such a demand. 
</P>
<P>
	Neither Moler nor Trulock could be reached for comment  
Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Moler, former chairman of the Federal Energy Regulatory  
Commission, and 12-year Senate staffer, has extensive background in 
civilian energy matters, but little in areas of nuclear weapons or 
counterintelligence. 
</P>
<P>
	The new security measures unveiled by Richardson include  
stricter controls on secret documents, tighter safeguards on 
computer messages and a re-examination of all of the department's 
counterintelligence files ``to identify cases that may need further 
review and possible investigation,'' officials said. 
</P>
<P>
	Richardson also said he had asked former CIA Director John  
Deutch to review the weapons laboratories' foreign visitors program 
to ensure it ``meets the highest standards of security.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The visitors program has come under attack because of concerns  
about security at the labs. Richardson on Tuesday strongly defended 
the program, saying it allows the United States to teach other 
countries, including Russia and China, about nuclear 
nonproliferation. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, FBI Director Louis Freeh told a House hearing that  
the FBI still is trying to determine whether the leak at Los Alamos 
occurred through the passage of physical documents or simply 
viewing and memorizing information that was seen or read. 
</P>
<P>
	Freeh, asked about the security at weapons labs, also said he  
could not rule out information getting into Chinese hands by ways 
other than traditional espionage in which a person ``is not 
intending to transmit secret information.''

<HEADLINE> Congress Eyes Unspent Welfare Money </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- With welfare rolls at a 30-year low, billions  
of dollars in welfare money has yet to be spent, prompting some in 
Congress to covet the money for other priorities. 
</P>
<P>
	It's a prospect that has governors and many of the architects of  
the 1996 welfare overhaul angry, fearing they will never be able to 
turn domestic programs over to the states if Congress turns its 
back on the welfare deal. 
</P>
<P>
	Under the 1996 law, $16.5 billion is put in federal accounts  
each year earmarked for states. Many states have saved the money in 
case the economy slows down, and many say it will be needed to 
provide more intensive services for welfare recipients who need the 
most help getting off welfare. 
</P>
<P>
	``There is no question that the Congress made a pledge, a  
promise,'' Wisconsin Gov. Tommy Thompson, a Republican, said 
Tuesday. ``How can you ever be trusted again if on such a serious 
issue as this you give your word and give your pledge, and then you 
go back on it?'' 
</P>
<P>
	House Ways and Means Committee Chairman Bill Archer, R-Texas,  
noted that states are just beginning to work with welfare 
recipients who have the most barriers to self-sufficiency. 
</P>
<P>
	``As state legislatures confront the toughest challenges of  
welfare reform, Congress is proposing to pull the rug from under 
them,'' Archer wrote to Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott, R-Miss. 
</P>
<P>
	Americans have left the welfare rolls more quickly than anyone  
predicted, propelled by a strong economy that helped people find 
jobs and tougher rules that discouraged them from staying on the 
dole. 
</P>
<P>
	With fewer people on welfare, there are fewer benefit checks to  
write. But the amount the federal government is giving the states 
was based on earlier years when caseloads were much higher. 
</P>
<P>
	At the end of September, after two years under the new system,  
more than $3 billion promised to the states was sitting unused in 
federal accounts. 
</P>
<P>
	In the Senate, an emergency spending bill would use $350 million  
of that money. And in the House, a Republican instrumental in 
crafting the 1996 welfare law wants to let states use their welfare 
money for education programs that may have nothing to do with the 
poor. 
</P>
<P>
	That would let Republicans support popular school programs  
without having to find new cash, responding to President Clinton's 
education initiatives while still allowing for a tax cut. 
</P>
<P>
	Neither proposal is going over well with other Republicans who  
helped shape the 1996 welfare law, which fundamentally changed how 
the nation aids its poor. 
</P>
<P>
	The federal government used to set the rules and promised to  
help pay benefits of each person who qualified for assistance. 
Under the new system, states agreed to live with a specific amount 
of money in exchange for enormous flexibility in creating their 
programs. 
</P>
<P>
	Like Thompson, Archer warned that future attempts to turn  
education, child protection, housing, food and health programs into 
similar ``block grants'' to states will fail if Congress breaks the 
welfare deal. Indeed, opponents of the welfare overhaul had warned 
that Congress would raid welfare money when it hit a financial 
crunch. 
</P>
<P>
	``If Congress cannot be trusted to keep its word, ... it will be  
all but impossible to enact additional reforms,'' Archer said in 
his letter to Lott that also was signed by other welfare overhaul 
leaders, Reps. Clay Shaw, R-Fla., and Nancy Johnson, R-Conn. 
</P>
<P>
	In the Senate, Appropriations Committee Chairman Ted Stevens,  
R-Alaska, wants to use $350 million to help provide disaster relief 
to the Central American victims of Hurricane Mitch. 
</P>
<P>
	States that have spent all their welfare money wouldn't be  
punished, but those with money left would lose a portion. The 
biggest loser would be New York, which would forfeit more than $79 
million of the $689 million it still holds unspent. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, House Budget Committee Chairman John Kasich, central  
to creation of the 1996 welfare overhaul, introduced a plan Tuesday 
to let states use their welfare money for education programs such 
as building new schools or hiring more teachers. 
</P>
<P>
	``It should be as broadly based on education as possible,'' said  
Bruce Cuthbertson, spokesman for Kasich, who is seeking the GOP 
presidential nomination. 
</P>
<P>
	Even Republicans who support flexibility in federal funding  
reject that. 
</P>
<P>
	``Using it for school construction and things of that nature is  
a nonstarter,'' said Archer's spokesman, Trent Duffy. 
</P>
<P>
	Thompson agreed: ``You've got to be in the realm of what's good  
for the welfare clientele.''

<HEADLINE> New York Probes Disputed Fight </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) -- New York's attorney general plans to focus  
his inquiry into last weekend's disputed Evander Holyfield-Lennox 
Lewis fight on how boxing's sanctioning bodies govern the sport. 
</P>
<P>
	The relationship between the sanctioning bodies and fight  
promoters like Don King is ``highly problematic,'' as is the way 
the three chief governing bodies choose judges for major fights, 
Eliot Spitzer said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Spitzer's criticism came as the Manhattan district attorney's  
office said it is now investigating possible illegalities in how 
the fight was judged. It is the fourth such inquiry into Saturday 
night's fight. 
</P>
<P>
	Spitzer said his public hearing Friday in New York City on the  
controversial draw in the Holyfield-Lewis fight will seek to find 
ways states or the federal government can ``redefine'' the roles of 
the principal players in the sport. 
</P>
<P>
	Gov. George Pataki said it was time for the federal government  
to step into the ring. 
</P>
<P>
	The IBF, WBC and WBA raise conflicts of interest questions by  
selecting judges for major title bouts and paying their expenses 
and their fees for being at ringside, Spitzer said. 
</P>
<P>
	When a judge selected by a governing body backs that body's  
champion despite evidence that his opponent did better during the 
bout -- as the IBF-selected judge is under fire for doing in the 
Holyfield-Lewis fight -- that calls into question the impartiality 
of the judging and the integrity of the sport, Spitzer said. 
</P>
<P>
	``The way in which judges are picked certainly breeds the lack  
of confidence that the public has,'' Spitzer said. ``The entire 
world of judging these days is insufficiently regulated and the 
aura of incompetence and perhaps worse, corruption, that permeates 
the industry flows from this.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Spitzer said he also wants to look at how governing bodies  
determine their rankings and who gets title shots and who doesn't. 
To outsiders, fighters appear to ``move up and down based upon, 
apparently, their relationships with promoters,'' the attorney 
general said. 
</P>
<P>
	``It is very troublesome to say the least and would suggest the  
ranking system is less than pure,'' Spitzer said. 
</P>
<P>
	Spitzer is chairman of a boxing task force within the National  
Association of Attorneys General. The task force has been working 
with U.S. Sen. John McCain of Arizona on boxing reform. 
</P>
<P>
	In the Holyfield-Lewis bout, judge Eugenia Williams of New  
Jersey, selected by the IBF, declared Holyfield the winner. The IBF 
and the WBA recognize Holyfield as champion; Lewis is the WBC 
champ. 
</P>
<P>
	The WBC judge, Larry O'Connell of England, said Tuesday he was  
surprised when he tallied his scorecard and found it was a draw. 
But he said he made no mistake in judging the fight. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was a lot closer than it might have appeared,'' he said.  
</P>
<P>
	The WBA judge, Stanley Christodoulou of South Africa, had Lewis  
the winner. 
</P>
<P>
	Referee Arthur Mercante Jr., who did not have a vote, said he  
felt Lewis was the clear winner. 
</P>
<P>
	``He took the fight to Evander,'' Mercante told The New York  
Times. ``If I were scoring, I'd have given Holyfield three rounds. 
</P>
<P>
	``Evander, he really wasn't focused and into the fight. His mind  
looked like it was somewhere else.'' 
</P>
<P>
	WBC president Jose Sulaiman said Tuesday that Lewis was  
``robbed'' of the unified heavyweight crown. 
</P>
<P>
	Sulaiman said the WBC objected to Williams as a judge because of  
her inexperience in championship bouts. He also questioned if she 
would favor Holyfield, an American, in a fight with an Englishman. 
</P>
<P>
	Pataki has ordered the state Athletic Commission to examine how  
fights can be assured of impartial judging. 
</P>
<P>
	``I certainly believe there should be some federal changes to  
prevent a repeat of that incident,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	The state Senate Committee on Investigations said it would hold  
a hearing on the bout Thursday in New York. 
</P>
<P>
	Among the witnesses scheduled to attend the Senate hearing are  
Williams, referee Arthur Mercante Jr.,King and fellow promoter Dino 
Duva. Lewis might participate in person or by conference call. 
Sulaiman will speak by phone from Mexico City.

	BOCA RATON, Fla. (AP) -- Movers and shakers of the futures  
industry met here Wednesday worried about their own future despite 
their booming business. 
</P>
<P>
	While U.S. futures and options are shattering monthly volume  
records and enjoying increases in prices for membership seats after 
years of decline, the traditional methods of trading products 
ranging from grains to U.S. Treasury bonds are succumbing to rapid 
advances in technology. 
</P>
<P>
	Critics say the system of frantic gesturing and yelling -- called  
open outcry -- has no place in the 21st century marketplace because 
it employs swarms of people, whereas a computer could do the same 
job with one person. 
</P>
<P>
	``Electronic markets and technology are finally forcing the hand  
of the established exchanges to look long and hard at their 
structure in order that they, too, can participate in what's going 
to happen in the year 2000 and beyond,'' said John Damgard, 
president of the Futures Industry Association trade group, which 
sponsors the annual meeting here. 
</P>
<P>
	``From now on, the people who make the right decisions are going  
to be the beneficiaries, and people who make the wrong decisions 
are going to pay the price,'' Damgard said. ``And it's all going to 
happen more quickly than any of us would expect.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The program, now in its 24th year, will include discussions on  
how to employ more technology at exchanges, the growing dominance 
of over-the-counter electronic trading and ways to achieve greater 
collaboration among the current market leaders. 
</P>
<P>
	Behind the scenes, participants are hoping a keynote speech by  
Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan will give them clues on 
Friday on how federal regulators might react to the inherent risks 
of electronic trading. 
</P>
<P>
	There also are likely to be backroom discussions on the future  
of the Commodity Futures Trading Commission after the regulatory 
agency's leader steps down later this year. And Damgard predicts 
there will be plenty of talks aimed at breaking a decades-long 
desire to protect individual turf, which has long has stymied 
efforts to forge new alliances or merge operations. 
</P>
<P>
	For their part, exchange leaders believe volatility late last  
year reinforced the need -- at least for now -- for open outcry. 
</P>
<P>
	David Brennan, chairman of the Chicago Board of Trade, the  
world's largest futures exchange, said there is no need to rush 
into action, echoing a stance he took in recently defeating Patrick 
Arbor for the position. 
</P>
<P>
	``My view is that you try to do small things instead of the big  
things that don't ever come across the finish line,'' Brennan said, 
referring to a recently rejected Arbor-backed proposal to develop a 
joint electronic trading system with Eurex, a German-Swiss 
electronic exchange. 
</P>
<P>
	Alone, Eurex this year is poised to overtake the Board of Trade  
as the largest exchange in terms of volume. And in addition to the 
fast-growing Eurex, new threats appear to be surfacing regularly. 
</P>
<P>
	An electronic exchange launched by brokerage Cantor Fitzgerald,  
after initially attracting little interest, has suddenly enjoyed an 
increase in its volume, while several other potential competitors 
have recently come forward. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, Brennan said observers shouldn't expect to see a flurry  
of announcements. He spoke after meeting with leaders from the 
London futures exchange about the possibility of developing 
technology or other business links but avoided using the term 
``alliance.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``There's going to be threats going forward anytime you have a  
leadership spot in the industry,'' Brennan said. ``Instead of 
focusing on specific threats, you have to look at your specific 
business plan ... and make sure you're there.''

<HEADLINE> Stocks Fall; Dow Down 54.39 / Wall Street Report  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Stock prices fell today, carrying the Dow Jones  
industrial average further from 10,000, as interest rates moved 
higher in the bond market. 
</P>
<P>
	At noon on Wall Street, the Dow was down 54.39 at 9,876.08, or  
nearly 124 points shy of 10,000. 
</P>
<P>
	Broader stock indicators were lower as well. The Standard &AMP;  
Poor's 500 index was down 12.93 at 1,293.45, while the 
technology-heavy Nasdaq composite index was off 16.47 at 2,422.80. 
</P>
<P>
	The Dow made some headway in the first hour of trading today,  
rising as high as 9,960.71, or less than 40 points away from 
10,000. But bond prices backed off, and stocks followed. 
</P>
<P>
	The 30-year Treasury bond was down 5/16 point at midday, pushing  
its yield to just under 5.5 percent from 5.47 percent late Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Charles Pradilla, chief investment strategist at SG Cowen  
Securities, said the higher yields in the bond market reminded 
investors how expensive stocks are. 
</P>
<P>
	``A lot of very seasoned people are seeing that the market has  
some valuation problems,'' Pradilla said. ``The market's up 10 
percent, and interest rates are up almost 1 percent -- something has 
to shift.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Dow briefly passed 10,000 Tuesday, climbing to 10,001.78  
just 20 minutes after trading began. But profit-takers descended on 
the market almost immediately, and the Dow ended the day down 28.30 
at 9,930.47, leaving for another day its first close above 10,000. 
</P>
<P>
	Today the Dow industrials were led lower by technology and  
financial stocks, which fell in reaction to the higher interest 
rates. IBM was down 2 3/8 at 178 5/8. Citigroup was down 1 3/8 at 63 1/8. 
</P>
<P>
	But Dow component Caterpillar was up 2 3/4 at 46 3/4, after Salomon  
Smith Barney upgraded the stock to ``buy'' from ``neutral.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Declining issues outnumbered advancers by a margin of 5 to 3 on  
the New York Stock Exchange, where volume came to 337.61 million 
shares, up slightly from Tuesday's pace of 333.43 million.

<HEADLINE> Salt Lake Supports Expulsions </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SALT LAKE CITY (AP) -- The International Olympic Committee's  
booting of six members and the IOC president's willingness to take 
responsibility for the crisis are good first steps, say Salt Lake 
Olympic organizers. 
</P>
<P>
	But the financial viability of the 2002 Winter Games hinges on  
reforms swift and dramatic enough to win back corporate sponsors, 
said Robert Garff, chairman of the Salt Lake Organizing Committee. 
</P>
<P>
	``Words, in the world's opinion, are not enough and action needs  
to follow and not five months from today,'' Garff said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	``Not to have these things resolved puts us in a terrible  
position of making decisions on a time line that is critical to the 
success of the games.'' 
</P>
<P>
	President Juan Antonio Samaranch, who received a near-unanimous  
vote of confidence from committee members on Wednesday, presented 
an ambitious reform plan. It includes a radical change in picking 
the 2006 Winter Games site, open financial records, the IOC's first 
ethics panel and a star-studded commission to plot the Olympics' 
fate, dubbed ``IOC 2000.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But he gave the panel until later this year to come up with the  
plan. 
</P>
<P>
	The SLOC has not signed a single corporate sponsor since the  
scandal broke late last year and diminished the value of the 
Olympic rings to corporate marketers. The committee needs $288 
million more from sponsors and licensees to meet the $1.4 billion 
budget. 
</P>
<P>
	``That is a mistake if it takes five months to a year to resolve  
these issues,'' Garff said. ``I don't believe the world's press or 
the world's opinion or the sponsors will wait. The patience of 
everyone is too thin.'' 
</P>
<P>
	It was the SLOC's predecessor, the bid committee, whose lavish  
courting of IOC members led to the Olympics' biggest corruption 
scandal, culminating in the resignations of four and Wednesday's 
expulsion of six. Executives of the bid committee, investigators 
said, spent $1.2 million unethically wooing IOC votes with cash 
payments, shopping sprees, vacations and free medical care. 
</P>
<P>
	Sen. John McCain of Arizona, the powerful chairman of the Senate  
Commerce Committee, said the expulsions are not enough. 
</P>
<P>
	``Expelling members does nothing to address the utter lack of  
transparency and accountability in IOC processes. What we must see 
are concrete reforms,'' McCain said in a written statement on 
Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	``The time to study the problem has passed. The abuses are well  
documented. It is time for the IOC to take action,'' McCain said. 
``Until reforms are implemented, the IOC will be unable to begin to 
restore its reputation.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Earlier in the week, McCain sent a letter to the United States'  
senior IOC member, Anita DeFrantz, urging quick adoption of reforms 
and warning that otherwise Congress' demand for action will be 
``irrepressible.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Sen. Ted Stevens of Alaska already has drawn up legislation that  
would strip the IOC of tax-exempt status, limit the percentage of 
fees sponsors can deduct from taxes and reroute U.S. TV rights fees 
through the U.S. Olympic Committee rather than sending the billions 
of dollars directly to the IOC. 
</P>
<P>
	Utah Gov. Mike Leavitt said he would leave it to the world to  
judge the adequacy of the IOC's actions, which come weeks after a 
top-to-bottom reorganization of the SLOC and hiring of a new 
president, Mitt Romney. 
</P>
<P>
	``Our focus in Utah must be to move forward with the business of  
planning for the 2002 Winter Olympics,'' the governor said. ``Our 
emphasis needs to be the athletes who have trained their entire 
lives for this event.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Romney, who met with the IOC's executive committee in Lausanne  
on Tuesday, was traveling back to Salt Lake and unavailable for 
comment on Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	He did not press the IOC to lower its expectations of what the  
SLOC will spend on 100-plus IOC members during the Olympics. Garff 
had suggested two months ago that Salt Lake would seek reductions 
in the ``fancy treatment'' it is required to provide. 
</P>
<P>
	The SLOC plans to spend nearly $3.4 million on meetings, visits  
to Salt Lake, language interpretation, food, hospitality rooms and 
transportation for IOC members, Romney said last week. 
</P>
<P>
	That's about $1 million less than was budgeted before he began  
trimming $84 million in ``frills and pageantry'' now contingent on 
whether enough revenue comes through. Most of the $1 million was 
budgeted for personnel to assist IOC members.

<HEADLINE> Medicare Plan Lacks Enough Votes </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- After a year of work, the commission charged  
with overhauling Medicare is poised to adjourn without making any 
formal recommendation, though leaders say they'll renew the fight 
for their ideas in Congress. 
</P>
<P>
	On the eve of today's final vote, the panel's leaders said they  
remained one vote shy of the 11 votes needed to make a formal 
recommendation to Congress. 
</P>
<P>
	Ten of the 17 members of National Bipartisan Commission on the  
Future of Medicare support a plan that would inject competition 
into the health insurance program for the elderly by letting 
seniors choose from a menu of options. 
</P>
<P>
	The panel, which includes Republicans, Democrats, members of  
Congress and private economists, hoped to rise above politics and 
offer Congress a blueprint for overhauling a program that has been 
a magnet for partisan warfare. 
</P>
<P>
	But in the end, the plan is largely supported by Republicans and  
backed by just two Democrats -- Louisiana Sen. John Breaux, the 
commission's chairman, and Sen. Bob Kerrey of Nebraska. 
</P>
<P>
	Breaux and his co-chairman, Rep. Bill Thomas, R-Calif., promised  
to fight for it in Congress, saying they hoped to move legislation 
this year that would make their ideas law even without commission 
endorsement. 
</P>
<P>
	``What do you do? Do you just cry about it or do you introduce  
legislation based on this?'' Breaux said Monday. ``What we've got 
is very important. ... We've changed the debate in a major, major 
way.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He predicted the plan would attract at least 60 votes in the  
Senate, enough to overcome any filibuster. Thomas was less 
confident about its prospects in the House, though he said there 
was substantial support. 
</P>
<P>
	President Clinton has remained on the sidelines publicly, though  
all four of the people he appointed to the commission have declined 
to support the Breaux-Thomas plan. Thomas has accused those 
commissioners of bowing to White House pressure, but Clinton 
spokesman Barry Toiv said Monday that the president did nothing to 
influence them. 
</P>
<P>
	As for the plan that emerged, Toiv said Clinton has not had a  
chance to review it and would have no comment. 
</P>
<P>
	``But the president wants very much to achieve bipartisan reform  
this year,'' Toiv said. 
</P>
<P>
	Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott was skeptical of Clinton's  
intentions. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a sign to me that apparently he's going to try and  
politicize Medicare instead of introduce real reform,'' Lott said 
Monday on PBS' ``NewsHour With Jim Lehrer'' program. 
</P>
<P>
	Breaux defended his detractors, saying there was a ``legitimate  
policy disagreement'' with opponents. ``There's always the fear of 
the unknown,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Thomas was less charitable: ``The proposal we will present is,  
in fact, the only reasonable way to go.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Their plan would make Medicare more like health benefits that  
many companies and the federal government offer to workers. 
</P>
<P>
	Retirees could choose from a menu of health-insurance policies  
and get a subsidy to help cover the cost. The more expensive plans 
would require participants to pay more out of their own pockets. 
Meanwhile, the government-run system that serves most retirees now 
would compete with the private health plans, which would have to 
offer similar coverage. 
</P>
<P>
	The plan also would gradually raise the eligibility age from 65  
to 67. 
</P>
<P>
	One of the most controversial issues has been prescription drug  
coverage, which is not part of the 34-year-old, traditional 
Medicare plan. The plan would require private companies to offer at 
least one option that includes drug coverage. The popular private 
plans that supplement Medicare coverage, known as Medigap, would be 
required to offer drugs as well. 
</P>
<P>
	Drugs would be available through the traditional Medicare  
program too, but the elderly would have to pay for the extra cost. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton has proposed using 15 percent of the budget surplus to  
shore up Medicare, and he has suggested that the program add drug 
payments, though the details of his program are not clear. 
</P>
<P>
	The Breaux-Thomas plan does not anticipate funneling extra money  
into Medicare from the budget surplus. But the commission staff 
estimates that their plan would save the program $100 billion 
between 2000 and 2009 and enough to keep the program solvent 
through 2017. The program is now expected to go broke in about a 
decade -- just as the huge baby boom begins to retire.

<HEADLINE> Study: Lack of Sleep Dangerous </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	People who have a sleep disorder that causes them to wake up  
repeatedly during the night run a higher risk of getting into 
traffic accidents, researchers reported today in the New England 
Journal of Medicine. 
</P>
<P>
	The research linked sleep apnea to car crashes in Spain.  
</P>
<P>
	With apnea, breathing is briefly and repeatedly cut off during  
sleep, often causing a person to wake up. Sufferers can be awakened 
hundreds of times a night, leaving them feeling tired the next day. 
Habitual snoring can be a symptom. 
</P>
<P>
	A University of Wisconsin study two years ago found that that  
people with undiagnosed sleep apnea were seven times more likely to 
have multiple traffic accidents. 
</P>
<P>
	In the latest study, doctors in Spain looked at drivers who  
received emergency treatment at two hospitals after getting into 
accidents. About 30 percent of them were found to have sleep apnea. 
That suggests that apnea sufferers are six times more likely to get 
into an accident, the researchers said. 
</P>
<P>
	In an accompanying editorial, Drs. Paul Suratt from the  
University of Virginia Medical Center and Larry Findley of the 
Sleep Disorders Center of Northern Colorado noted that an estimated 
80 percent of sleep apnea cases go undiagnosed. 
</P>
<P>
	Doctors ``have an important role in helping to prevent accidents  
through identifying people with sleep apnea, providing treatment 
and education, and reporting patients who have had accidents to 
state authorities according to applicable laws,'' they wrote.

<HEADLINE> Mass. Bus Driver Charged </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PLYMOUTH, Mass. (AP) -- A school bus driver was charged with  
drunken driving for hitting a car after dropping off her 
passengers. 
</P>
<P>
	Rayna Heroux, 28, had alcohol on her breath and her eyes were  
red and glassy after the accident Tuesday morning, authorities 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	No one was hurt. Ms. Heroux had just dropped students off at a  
middle school and was scheduled to pick up some elementary school 
children. 
</P>
<P>
	Her license was suspended for four months for refusing to take a  
blood-alcohol test after the accident. She was also suspended from 
Laidlaw Transit Co. without pay. She pleaded innocent and was 
released without bail. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Heroux was hired by Laidlaw in September and passed a 90-day  
probationary period. Motor vehicle records show she has had at 
least five accidents and two speeding violations since 1988. 
</P>
<P>
	Ken Rezendes, a district director at Laidlaw, said that the  
company knew about her driving record but that her last infraction 
was 3 1/2 years ago.

<HEADLINE> Redskins' Sale Decision Delayed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PHOENIX (AP) -- The NFL put off a decision on the sale of the  
Washington Redskins to Howard and Edward Milstein and Dan Snyder 
until April. 
</P>
<P>
	Commissioner Paul Tagliabue on Wednesday said there were not  
enough votes to approve the $800 million offer that was accepted by 
the trustees of Jack Kent Cooke's estate in January. The league 
will hold a special meeting during the week of April 5 and 
Tagliabue expects a vote then. Passage requires 24 votes. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're still struggling with the terms of the financing, and  
there was some feeling that a lot of work has been done under a lot 
of time pressure in the last week or 10 days,'' Tagliabue said. 
``We felt more could be accomplished if we gave it more time. 
</P>
<P>
	``There was nothing to prevent us from voting it down. This, we  
feel, is a reasonable thing to do in terms of good business 
management.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Also included in the sale is the new Jack Kent Cooke Stadium in  
suburban Landover, Md. It is the largest bid for a U.S. franchise 
in any sport. 
</P>
<P>
	Cooke died in April 1997 and his will called for ownership of  
the team to be put up for bidding. His son, John Kent Cooke, is the 
president of the Redskins and lost out in the bidding. 
</P>
<P>
	``We've been working in good faith, but the unprecedented price  
and the financing has to be put in place,'' Tagliabue said. 
``Everybody walked a long walk and we should continue to see what 
we can get accomplished.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Tagliabue said he doesn't believe the league's financing rules  
can't be met by prospective owners, citing the recent acquisitions 
of the Minnesota Vikings, Philadelphia Eagles and Tampa Bay 
Buccaneers, plus the $530 million price tag for the expansion 
Cleveland Browns. 
</P>
<P>
	He also insisted it wasn't his role to support or oppose the bid  
for the Redskins. 
</P>
<P>
	``The owners are making a decision on who their business  
partners will be,'' Tagliabue said. ``I don't think the 
commissioner's office's role is to say I'll side with this group or 
the other group. That is not the commissioner's job.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Howard Milstein and Snyder both expressed approval of the delay.  
</P>
<P>
	``It became apparent everyone needed more time to air the  
issues,'' Milstein said. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's important to make it clear the process has been very fair  
and we look forward to continue in the process of trying to 
purchase the Washington Redskins,'' Snyder added. 
</P>
<P>
	Tagliabue said the team will be run by the current  
administration until a decision is made in April on the bid. 
</P>
<P>
	``We were sensitive to the management of the team and it's need  
to be competitive,'' Tagliabue said.

<HEADLINE> Panel Wants Tougher Seat Belt Laws </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Hundreds of children's lives could be saved  
each year if they used booster seats and seat belts more, says an 
expert panel that recommends strengthening seat belt laws and 
having children use booster seats longer before graduating to seat 
belts. 
</P>
<P>
	Transportation Secretary Rodney Slater had asked the panel to  
come up with recommendations for children ages 4 through 15 because 
so many die in auto crashes while riding unrestrained. The 
blue-ribbon panel made its recommendations Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1997, car crashes killed 1,627 children in that age group. Of  
those, 1,015 were unrestrained. Properly used booster seats and 
safety belts would have prevented about 500 of the deaths, said 
Phil Haseltine, head of the panel of government, medical, industry 
and consumer safety experts. 
</P>
<P>
	``In a crash, unrestrained kids become missiles flying about the  
vehicle interior,'' Haseltine said. 
</P>
<P>
	Another problem is that children often are not secured by  
restraints appropriate for their ages and weights, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	The panel said children who have outgrown child seats should use  
booster seats at least to age 8. Only 5 percent of children ages 4 
to 8 currently ride in booster seats, which allow lap and shoulder 
belts to be positioned properly over a child's hips and chest. 
</P>
<P>
	``Parents frequently do not know what a booster seat is,''  
Haseltine said. ``Retail sales (of booster seats) are so low some 
manufacturers don't want to stock them on their shelves.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The panel also recommended that:  
</P>
<P>
	--States tighten seat belt laws and enforce them so children must  
buckle up. 
</P>
<P>
	In all 50 states, laws require children to be restrained in  
vehicles but normally target children only to ages 4 or 5. In 
contrast, although the government recommends that all children 
under age 13 ride in back seats, most states lack seat belt laws 
requiring older children to be restrained in the back. 
</P>
<P>
	--A crash dummy representing a 10-year-old dummy should be  
developed to help understand child injuries better. 
</P>
<P>
	--After-market devices used to lower the height of seat belt  
shoulder belts for children be tested by the government to make 
sure they are safe. 
</P>
<P>
	The panel said Congress should increase the federal motor fuel  
tax by one-half of a cent, generating $750 million to pay for 
research and other safety programs.

	MEXICO CITY (AP) -- About 200 women protested outside the office

scores of young women in the northern border city of Ciudad Juarez.

	RIO DE JANEIRO, Brazil (AP) -- The state of Rio de Janeiro has  
passed a law requiring the sterilization of pit bulls, following a 
rash of attacks on children. 
</P>
<P>
	The law would ban the sale, import and breeding of pit bulls.  
Owners will have 120 days to sterilize the dogs or face fines of up 
to $2,580. 
</P>
<P>
	Another restriction says pit bulls can appear in public places  
only between 10 p.m. and 5 a.m. and must have muzzles and choke 
chains. 
</P>
<P>
	The law was unanimously approved Tuesday and now goes to Gov.  
Anthony Garotinho for signing. The Rio city government is preparing 
a similar law.

	A spokesman for Monsanto, who declined to be identified, said  
the company withdrew the application to make revisions, and plans 
to file a corrected version shortly. 
</P>
<P>
	The Roundup Ready soybeans are genetically altered to allow  
liberal application of powerful Monsanto herbicides without harming

<HEADLINE> Potassium Iodide Stirs Controversy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- State and federal officials are wrestling with  
potassium iodide's costs and benefits 20 years after the Three Mile 
Island nuclear accident brought the drug to prominence as a shield 
against thyroid cancer. 
</P>
<P>
	In Massachusetts, for example, officials emphasize evacuation in  
the event of a nuclear accident while worrying that people with 
allergies or on medication could have a bad reaction from potassium 
iodide. 
</P>
<P>
	``You don't know if they might take it because they hear their  
neighbor say, 'Ooh, there's a meltdown','' said Mark Leccese, 
spokesman for the state Department of Public Health. ``We don't 
believe in handing out a potentially dangerous medication on a mass 
basis.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, New Hampshire activists are pressing their state to  
have the drug stocked in pharmacies so that people who want it can 
get it. 
</P>
<P>
	Potassium iodide protects the thyroid by blocking its absorption  
of radioactive iodine. 
</P>
<P>
	After the 1978 nuclear accident in Pennsylvania, a presidential  
commission strongly recommended stockpiling the drug near all U.S. 
reactor sites. 
</P>
<P>
	But in 1985, the NRC concluded that stockpiling was not  
worthwhile, although agency staff at the time estimated the cost at 
about 10 cents per year for each of the nearly 800,000 people 
potentially protected. The drug was recommended only for emergency 
workers and institutionalized people who could not be moved quickly 
to safety. 
</P>
<P>
	Last year, the NRC reversed that policy in light of evidence  
that the drug reduced the incidence of thyroid cancer among 
children in Poland following the 1986 Chernobyl nuclear accident in 
Ukraine. 
</P>
<P>
	While leaving the decision to state and local officials, the NRC  
concluded it would be prudent to stockpile potassium iodide near 
reactor sites. It directed states to consider its use and offered 
to pay for it or, in some cases, make it available from an existing 
federal supply. 
</P>
<P>
	A federally led committee is trying to publish a brochure by  
October to guide decision-making. The drug is now stockpiled by 
only Alabama, Arizona and Tennessee. 
</P>
<P>
	One committee member who supports the drug's use is Tony  
Sheridan, first selectman of Waterford, Conn., home of the 
Millstone plant. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's highly unlikely there will ever be an accident,''  
Sheridan said. ``But there are people who are anxious about it ... 
So they have a right to have it available.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The nuclear power industry, hesitant to heighten public concern  
about the likelihood of an accident, has opposed stockpiling. 
Industry officials say such programs are costly, confusing and 
probably would not get the pills to people in time to do any good. 
</P>
<P>
	But even supporters are cautious, stressing that the drug should  
not replace evacuation and sheltering. 
</P>
<P>
	They are concerned that people would be slow to evacuate a  
nuclear accident zone if they assume, wrongly, that the drug 
confers broad protection. Potassium iodide only protects the 
thyroid from radioactive iodine and stands to benefit infants, 
children and pregnant women the most. 
</P>
<P>
	``You can run into problems where people think it's a magic  
radiation cure,'' said Joelle Key, a health physicist with the 
state division of radiological health in Tennessee, where the 
Tennessee Valley Authority operates three nuclear power plants. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1981, Tennessee officials reached two-thirds of households  
with a door-to-door distribution. But the most recent call to 
replace old pills with fresher ones had just a 15 percent response. 
</P>
<P>
	Distribution can be tricky because officials do not want people  
kept in a contaminated area for too long. 
</P>
<P>
	Even dosage is under review by the U.S. Food and Drug  
Administration, which in 1982 recommended a three- to seven-day 
course of 130-milligram tablets for everyone older than a year, 
while the youngest would get half a tablet. 
</P>
<P>
	The World Health Organization has drafted recommendations for  
smaller doses for young children, down to 16 milligrams for 
newborns. But that raises the practical question of how to divide 
an already small pill to deliver such a tiny dose. 
</P>
<P>
	Activists say such issues can be worked out and should not  
obscure the basic right of people to potassium iodide's protective 
qualities. In Connecticut, hundreds have signed petitions in 
support of a two-year trial in three towns near Millstone. 
</P>
<P>
	``We want people to have a choice,'' said Mark Holloway, a  
member of Connecticut's Nuclear Energy Advisory Council, which 
recommended the trial. ``It's like having a seat belt in your 
car.''

<HEADLINE> Clinton's Debt Plan Is Opposed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Clinton's proposal to offer greater  
debt relief to the world's poorest countries met with bipartisan 
criticism Wednesday in Congress. Republicans charged the plan could 
threaten needed economic reforms while Democrats complained it did 
not provide enough help to the world's poor. 
</P>
<P>
	Treasury Secretary Robert Rubin faced that opposition when he  
appeared before a key House Appropriations subcommittee to sell 
Clinton's plan to expand current debt relief efforts by the 
International Monetary Fund and the World Bank. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have a lot of concerns,'' Rep. Sonny Callahan, R-Ala. and  
chairman of the House Appropriations subcommittee on foreign 
operations, told Rubin. ``We ask for no accountability for the 
money they borrowed. Some of that money just disappeared. Now we 
say we have to forgive all this debt.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton, who unveiled Monday in a speech to a conference of top  
African officials, wants to expand a current program to forgive 
about $30 billion in debt, so that $100 billion in debt relief 
would be covered. 
</P>
<P>
	Now, about 41 nations, mostly in Africa and Latin America, are  
eligible for the Highly Indebted Poor Countries program. That 
number would grow to 50 countries under Clinton's initiative. 
</P>
<P>
	The president would finance part of the debt relief by allowing  
the sale of a portion of the gold reserves held by the IMF. 
</P>
<P>
	Rubin told the committee the administration's plan would require  
that nations follow stringent economic reforms; debt would not be 
erased until a nation had established a six-year track record of 
performance. 
</P>
<P>
	Also Wednesday, the secretary, in a State Department meeting  
with senior African ministers, said their countries could expect 
more private investment if they opened up their economies, maintain 
political stability and fight corruption. 
</P>
<P>
	Tanzania's finance minister, Jakaya Kikwete, was glad the United  
States was aware of the debt predicament many African countries 
face. Many nations must use scarce currency reserves to service 
their debts and therefore lack funds for basic health and school 
care programs. 
</P>
<P>
	``We hope the United States will use its influence with the IMF  
and the World Bank to move faster on relieving debts.'' 
</P>
<P>
	On Capitol Hill, some Democrats questioned the president's  
approach, given that the IMF and World Bank program, launched in 
September 1996, had so far provided significant benefits to only 
two nations -- Uganda and Bolivia. 
</P>
<P>
	Rep. Jesse Jackson, D-Ill., told Rubin he was concerned that so  
little debt relief was being offered. He said that Mozambique, one 
of the nations making an effort to qualify for help, would see its 
annual debt service payments reduced by only about 10 percent even 
after all its economic reforms. 
</P>
<P>
	Rep. Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., said she believed the United States  
needed to ``develop a more comprehensive strategy on debt relief to 
address this crushing burden.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Separately, Democratic Sen. Richard Bryan of Nevada raised  
strong objections to the part of Clinton's proposal that would 
involve sales of IMF gold reserves. He said this could have a 
serious economic impact on Nevada, the largest U.S. producer of 
gold. 
</P>
<P>
	``The gold mining industry is too important to Nevada's economy  
to be so easily sacrificed by this ill-conceived proposal,'' Bryan 
said in a statement. 
</P>
<P>
	Rubin told reporters that under the administration's proposal,  
about 5 percent of the IMF's gold reserves of 103 million ounces 
would be sold over a period of time designed to ``minimize market 
intervention.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Any IMF gold sales would have to win approval from Congress and  
also from other wealthy nations who are major shareholders in the 
organization. Both France and Germany have indicated they are 
reconsidering their past opposition to such sales. 
</P>
<P>
	The outlook for Clinton's proposal was unclear given the frosty  
initial reception by Callahan's subcommittee. But Rubin stressed to 
reporters that a formal bill had not been drafted and the 
administration was willing to work with members of Congress to come 
up with an acceptable plan. 
</P>
<P>
	The House Banking Committee chairman, Rep. James Leach, R-Iowa,  
has introduced an even broader debt relief proposal which has 
received support from both Democrats and Republicans on his 
committee. 
</P>
<P>
	The issue of debt relief for poor nations is expected to be a  
key agenda item at this year's economic summit of the world's seven 
richest countries to be held in Germany in June.

<HEADLINE>  Israel Political Leader Convicted </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	JERUSALEM (AP) -- A powerful ally of Prime Minister Benjamin  
Netanyahu was convicted today of taking bribes, fraud and breaching 
the public trust in a case that has raised tensions prior to 
general elections. 
</P>
<P>
	Arieh Deri, a close Netanyahu associate, leads the influential  
Shas party, made up mostly of religious voters of Middle Eastern 
origin. 
</P>
<P>
	The scandal first made headlines nine years ago, and went to  
court as a criminal case five years ago. 
</P>
<P>
	Judge Yaakov Tzemach said the Moroccan-born politician used the  
Interior Ministry in the late 1980s to illegally direct government 
funds toward Shas projects in local municipalities and that he 
pocketed $155,000 in bribes. 
</P>
<P>
	The bribery conviction carries a maximum sentence of seven years  
imprisonment. Sentencing will take place on Mar. 25. 
</P>
<P>
	Outside the court, Deri's supporters, burst into wails and  
prayers. Security was heavy as two of three judges in the case have 
received death threats. 
</P>
<P>
	``I view the threats on judges with extreme seriousness,''  
Netanyahu said after the verdict. ``We will not tolerate it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Deri's followers say the charges are prompted by religious and  
ethnic bias. Police reported tire burnings in a neighborhood heavy 
with Shas followers after the verdict was announced. One youth was 
arrested. Shas leaders urged calm. 
</P>
<P>
	Three Deri associates were convicted on related charges.  
</P>
<P>
	``This is a black day for Israel,'' said Arieh Gamliel, Shas  
deputy minister for religious affairs. 
</P>
<P>
	Shas followers and human rights activists have said the  
nine-year gap between the launching of the investigation and the 
verdict was a sign of prosecutorial excess. 
</P>
<P>
	Judge Tzemach blamed Deri for the delays. ``He played a cat and  
mouse game with the police for three years,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	The verdict could rally Shas supporters to the polls and help  
Netanyahu in May 17 elections. Like Deri, the prime minister has 
successfully cast himself as an outsider seeking to puncture the 
power of ``elites'' in Israel, including the police and courts. 
</P>
<P>
	The bribery conviction bars Deri from serving as a governmental  
minister for a period of 10 years, but does not necessarily 
disqualify him from serving in parliament. 
</P>
<P>
	Deri left the court smiling. ``To my surprise, I feel good,  
thank God,'' he said. Shas leaders said there would be an appeal.

<HEADLINE> Starr's Top Deputy Resigns </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Jackie M. Bennett Jr., a top deputy to  
Independent Counsel Kenneth Starr, is joining a law firm in the 
latest in a string of departures that suggests the prosecutor's 
inquiry is winding down. 
</P>
<P>
	Bennett will become a partner at McTurnan &AMP; Turner, a firm in  
his hometown of Indianapolis, starting April 12. 
</P>
<P>
	``To say it's been challenging is an understatement,'' said  
Bennett of his three years with the independent counsel, whose 
investigation led to President Clinton's impeachment. 
</P>
<P>
	Regarded as a tough prosecutor and interrogator, Bennett ran the  
daily operations of Starr's investigation into Clinton's affair 
with former White House intern Monica Lewinsky and an alleged 
cover-up. 
</P>
<P>
	Bennett was at the forefront of Starr's team as it pursued  
Lewinsky in January 1998 after receiving a tip that she and Clinton 
had been involved. 
</P>
<P>
	When prosecutors detained Lewinsky at a Virginia hotel and tried  
to gain her cooperation in their investigation, Lewinsky said she 
wanted to call her mother. Bennett told her, ``You're 24, you're 
smart, you're old enough, you don't need to call your mommy,'' 
according to Lewinsky's grand jury testimony. 
</P>
<P>
	Bennett was one of three prosecutors who questioned Clinton  
about the Lewinsky matter when he testified for the grand jury last 
August. 
</P>
<P>
	Starr called Bennett ``a stellar performer on the most difficult  
issues,'' and said he ``served with great integrity.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Bennett's departure comes less than a week after Starr spokesman  
Charles Bakaly resigned under a cloud. Bakaly left March 11 after 
Starr asked the Justice Department to investigate him in connection 
with a recent press leak. Bakaly's lawyer said he did not violate 
any court orders or regulations. 
</P>
<P>
	Robert Bittman, another Starr deputy, left recently for a law  
firm. Another deputy, Solomon Weisenberg, also plans to leave. 
</P>
<P>
	Starr still has several areas of unfinished business relating to  
the Clinton investigation, including three trials and three 
different investigations of his office.

<HEADLINE> Netscape Shareholders OK Merger </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DULLES, Va. (AP) -- America Online Inc. completed its nearly $10  
billion acquisition of Netscape Communications Corp. today, 
creating a powerful new Internet force with two of the top Web 
destinations. AOL completed its all-stock purchase after Netscape 
shareholders voted overwhelmingly in favor of the deal, removing 
the last remaining hurdle. The Justice Department said last week it 
wouldn't oppose the takeover. 
</P>
<P>
	Dulles, Va.-based AOL, the world's largest Internet access and  
online service provider, plans to use Netscape's assets to gain key 
advantages in its battle with Microsoft Corp. to dominate the main 
Web sites where people get information and buy goods and services. 
</P>
<P>
	AOL chairman Steve Case has said he wants to give AOL's 16  
million subscribers easy links to Netscape's already popular 
Netcenter Web site, which is a portal to a range of services and 
information geared toward businesses. 
</P>
<P>
	AOL already runs the popular aol.com Internet site, made for  
consumers, which is ranked the most popular Web destination by 
Media Metrics Inc. Netcenter is No. 5. 
</P>
<P>
	AOL also may create versions of Netscape's Internet browser  
software for a new generation of Internet-navigation gizmos, such 
as wireless hand-held computers and smart phones with screens. 
</P>
<P>
	While AOL plans for now to keep Netscape's 2,500-person work  
force autonomous, with separate headquarters in Mountain View, 
Calif., its purchase marks the end of independence for a software 
pioneer. 
</P>
<P>
	Netscape's founders created the popular Navigator software for  
finding and retrieving information on the Web, but the company 
withered in recent years in a punishing counterattack by Microsoft. 
</P>
<P>
	Shareholders voting for the deal, in Santa Clara, Calif., were  
optimistic the AOL marriage would give a needed lift to Netscape's 
existing businesses. 
</P>
<P>
	``I knew immediately AOL was going to be a leader in encouraging  
the masses to use the Internet. I'm glad to be a part of it now,'' 
said Sarah Green, owner of a computer consulting firm who has 
quadrupled her investment in Netscape shares bought a few years 
ago.

<HEADLINE> Olivetti Would Cut Jobs at Telecom </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LONDON (AP) -- Olivetti SpA said Wednesday that it would  
eliminate 13,000 jobs at Telecom Italia SpA if successful in buying 
its much larger rival. 
</P>
<P>
	The cuts at Telecom's fixed-line telephone business would amount  
to more than 10 percent of all jobs at Italy's biggest phone 
company, or more than 16 percent of its telephone-related jobs. 
</P>
<P>
	The proposal is the latest from Olivetti since it launched a  
hostile $58 billion bid for Telecom last month. A takeover of the 
former state monopoly would be the biggest telecommunications deal 
so far in Europe. 
</P>
<P>
	A Telecom official in Rome declined to comment on the Olivetti  
plan. 
</P>
<P>
	Olivetti expects the job cuts to yield savings of $2.6 billion  
by 2002, chief executive Roberto Colaninno told analysts in Milan, 
Italy. 
</P>
<P>
	Telecom now has about 124,000 employees, of which some 80,000  
work in its telephone operations. 
</P>
<P>
	Colaninno also said Olivetti would invest $9.7 billion in  
Telecom's fixed-line operations, $2.8 billion in its mobile phone 
business and $2.6 billion in other operations. 
</P>
<P>
	The investment plan was based on expectations that the Italian  
government would reduce rates on both fixed-line and mobile phone 
calls, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Olivetti's plan also calls for sales of Telecom assets worth  
$9.1 billion over three years. 
</P>
<P>
	Olivetti has announced no immediate intention to reduce  
Telecom's stake in its 60 percent-owned subsidiary, Telecom Italia 
Mobile SpA. Olivetti said earlier that it would decrease Telecom's 
share in TIM but still keep control of the cellular unit, which is 
Europe's largest. 
</P>
<P>
	In an effort to thwart Olivetti's bid, Telecom has proposed  
merging with TIM and expanding shareholder voting rights. 
</P>
<P>
	A merger with its cellular subsidiary would create more Telecom  
shares and boost the price of the takeover by some $22 billion. 
Telecom said it will ask shareholders to approve the mobile phone 
merger by April 16. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition, Telecom will buy back as much as 10 percent of its  
stock as soon as its board obtains shareholder approval. 
</P>
<P>
	Olivetti, with the help of four banks, is trying to obtain  
nearly $25 billion in financing for the takeover. 
</P>
<P>
	Telecom and its banks are seeking to raise a $22 billion loan to  
help repel Olivetti.

<HEADLINE> Balloon Team Crosses Mexico </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MEXICO CITY (AP) -- A Swiss-English balloon team soared over  
Mexico early today after completing a six-day journey across the 
Pacific Ocean in an attempt to become the first balloonists to 
travel nonstop around the world. 
</P>
<P>
	``So, that little puddle is what they call the Pacific,'' Brian  
Jones of England deadpanned in a message sent to the team's support 
crew in Geneva. 
</P>
<P>
	The support crew in Geneva popped open a bottle of champagne as  
the balloon approached the Mexican coast. ``We're pleased that the 
Pacific is now behind them,'' flight controller Brian Smith said. 
</P>
<P>
	Jones and Bertrand Piccard of Switzerland, who lifted off from  
the Swiss Alps on March 1, were over Belize in Central America this 
morning. They were heading into the Caribbean toward Jamaica, the 
Dominican Republic and Haiti, the control center said in a 
statement. 
</P>
<P>
	The team will try to pick up a stream over the eastern Caribbean  
by Friday and then head for North Africa. At the moment, it is 
expected to cross the ``finish'' line in Mauritania -- somewhere 
along longitude 9 degrees west -- Saturday afternoon. 
</P>
<P>
	If the team makes it to North Africa, it will have traveled more  
than 26,000 miles around the world and Piccard and Jones will have 
conquered one of the last great challenges facing aviators. 
</P>
<P>
	``If I get there, I really won't be able to believe it,''  
Piccard told Swiss Television. 
</P>
<P>
	The Anheuser-Busch company is offering a $1 million prize --  
$500,000 to the first person or team to make it, and $500,000 to 
the charity of the winner's choice. 
</P>
<P>
	Chicago millionaire Steve Fossett, British tycoon Richard  
Branson and Per Lindstrand of Sweden were forced to ditch their 
balloon off Hawaii on Dec. 25 after flying around more than half 
the globe. 
</P>
<P>
	A U.S.-Australian team canceled its planned attempt in  
mid-January. On March 7, two British balloonists abandoned their 
attempt because of bad weather, landing in the Pacific near Japan. 
</P>
<P>
	Smith said Piccard and Jones set a record on Tuesday, breaking  
the old mark for longest distance flown in a balloon: 14,236 miles. 
</P>
<P>
	The Pacific crossing was sluggish at first, with the Breitling  
Orbiter balloon slowing at times to 30 mph. But the team managed to 
catch a ride on the jetstream southeast of Hawaii. 
</P>
<P>
	The balloonists cruised over Mexico at 53 mph at an altitude of  
36,000 feet, their control center reported. 
</P>
<P>
	The center said the speed helped conserve propane, which fuels  
the burners in the lower, hot-air section of the balloon. The 
burners are needed to keep the balloon afloat. 
</P>
<P>
	The center said it still is unable to predict where the balloon  
will land if it reaches North Africa, but that it probably won't 
make it as far as the pyramids, where Jones had hoped to come down 
</P>
<P>
	It said predictions of the landing spot will probably begin  
Thursday and will get progressively more accurate.

<HEADLINE> Business Measuring System Unveiled </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Government economists are jettisoning a  
business classification system dating from the 1930s in favor of a 
new system that recognizes such features of modern life as the fact 
that computers run on electricity. 
</P>
<P>
	Until now, ``computers used to be counted in nonelectrical  
machinery because the first computers were likened to adding 
machines, and adding machines were hand-cranked,'' said Commerce 
Undersecretary Robert Shapiro. 
</P>
<P>
	The North American Industry Classification System, replacing the  
six-decade-old Standard Industry Classification system, also will 
allow the government to separately track such new businesses as 
fiber-optic cable manufacturing, cellular telephone service, 
telemarketing, weight-reducing centers, pet supply stores, 
bed-and-breakfast inns, oil-change and lube shops and casino 
hotels. 
</P>
<P>
	Previously, service-industry ``data on haircuts and brain  
surgery were all dropped in the same statistical pot,'' said 
Frederick Knickerbocker, the Census Bureau's associate director for 
economic programs. 
</P>
<P>
	All told, the new system provides 1,170 industry  
classifications, 15 percent more than the old system. It includes 
358 new industries, 390 revised classifications and 422 industries 
that will be measured the same way as before. 
</P>
<P>
	Users of government statistics received their first glimpse of  
the new system on Tuesday in the Census Bureau's advance report on 
the 1997 Economic Census. It revealed, for instance, that the 
information sector -- movies, broadcasting, telecommunications, 
data-processing -- provided 3.2 million jobs at 115,000 locations in 
1997. 
</P>
<P>
	The health-care and social assistance sector provided 13.6  
million jobs at 645,000 locations, while professional and technical 
services -- scientists, engineers, architects, programmers, 
designers -- employed 5.4 million people at 622,000 places. 
</P>
<P>
	``The 1997 Economic Census provides the first snapshot of the  
economy as it enters the new millennium,'' Shapiro said. 
</P>
<P>
	It offers, he said, more precise numbers to back up such already  
recognized trends as the growing importance of computers, the rise 
of new types of businesses such as temporary help firms and 
warehouse club superstores, the increase in information technology 
and the increasing importance of high-skill jobs. 
</P>
<P>
	The new system was jointly developed with Canada and Mexico and  
will make comparisons among the signatories of the North American 
Free Trade Agreement easier, the officials said.

<HEADLINE> IOC Chief Gets Vote of Confidence </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LAUSANNE, Switzerland (AP) -- The embattled leader of the  
Olympics won a resounding vote of confidence today after saying the 
IOC ``is now on trial'' in the Salt Lake City bribery scandal and 
must take quick action to avoid ``very, very serious'' damage. 
</P>
<P>
	International Olympic Committee president Juan Antonio Samaranch  
said a watershed general assembly to vote on unprecedented 
expulsions and start a reform process was ``the most important 
session'' in IOC history. 
</P>
<P>
	``Our main goal is to take the necessary steps to be absolutely  
certain that this very sad episode never happens again,'' he told 
reporters before the session started. ``Throughout the remaining 
time of my presidency, I intend to make this our highest 
priority.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In his opening speech to the delegates, Samaranch went further,  
saying he accepted responsibility for the development of a ``crisis 
of this magnitude'' and that the IOC should shoulder the blame 
``even if some of the conduct by bidding cities has itself been 
unethical.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``It is the IOC that is being judged, and the IOC that must deal  
with the situation,'' he said. ``Bidding cities which may have 
acted improperly are a matter of the past; it is our IOC which is 
now on trial.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He said the committee ``must root out all forms of inappropriate  
or unethical behavior among our membership'' and called on the 
delegates to uphold unprecedented expulsions of six members. 
</P>
<P>
	``It is my firm conviction that, unless we act quickly,  
decisively and unanimously ... the damage which may be done to the 
Olympic movement and to the IOC as a result of recent disclosures 
will be very, very serious,'' Samaranch said. 
</P>
<P>
	The six members, starting with Agustin Arroyo of Ecuador, went  
in alphabetical order before the general assembly and presented 
their defenses in separate, 20-minute sessions. Arroyo was followed 
by Zein El Abdin Ahmed Abdel Gadir of Sudan. Jean-Claude Ganga of 
the Congo Republic, Lamine Keita of Mali, Sergio Santander of Chile 
and Paul Wallwork of Samoa. 
</P>
<P>
	Officials expected results by midafternoon in Lausanne. All of  
the cases were considered in a secret ballot of eligible delegates, 
who wrote ``yes'' to expel their colleagues or ``no'' to let them 
stay. 
</P>
<P>
	One officials said there could be ``a risk'' on some of the  
votes, with 30 ballots -- a third of the membership present -- needed 
to escape expulsion. 
</P>
<P>
	Mario Pescante, the secretary general of the European Olympic  
Committees Association who has become a spokesman for the IOC's 
rank-and-file, said there was some feeling among the members that 
the investigation was flawed. 
</P>
<P>
	``Some people are not satisfied with the work of our inquiry  
commission,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Samaranch's speech, which received two rousing standing ovations  
from the delegates, was followed by an overwhelming vote of support 
for the 78-year-old Spaniard who has led the Olympics from the doom 
of boycotts to the height of the sports world -- but also the pain 
of its worst scandal. 
</P>
<P>
	The secret ballot in the closed-door meeting was 86-2, with one  
blank ballot and another not returned, according to delegates 
emerging from the conference room on a coffee break. 
</P>
<P>
	``He is happy,'' executive board member Jacques Rogge of Belgium  
said. ``What gives him so much strength is that he won so 
overwhelmingly.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``The message is there is great support for the president,''  
Pescante said. ``We need a strong president at this moment.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Samaranch, in his speech, offered a rundown of accomplishments  
of his 18 years as president and a list of reforms, including 
public release of financial records, changes in selecting Olympic 
cities and establishing an independent reform commission to make 
recommendations in time for another special assembly late this 
year. 
</P>
<P>
	``Starting today, our mandate is to heal the wounds inflicted by  
the inappropriate actions of some members of the IOC and by others 
outside of our organization, and return the prestige to the entire 
Olympic movement,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	The era of the clubby IOC was over, Samaranch declared. It was  
time to open the doors and let people see that the leaders of the 
games could operate as fairly and honestly as the athletes are 
supposed to. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have had to make compromises,'' he said. ``This (gains of  
the past 18 years) has all been accomplished with the best will in 
the world, but not without some cost in terms of the manner in 
which the IOC has operated in the past, as a relatively restricted 
group of individuals acting with a sense of shared values.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But, while he said he wanted to lead the IOC through these  
changes, Samaranch gave perhaps his clearest signal yet that he 
might not finish his term, scheduled to conclude late in 2001. 
</P>
<P>
	``I have personally given the best of myself to the Olympic  
movement over the last 18 years and ... my last service to Olympism 
would be to restructure our organization in order to enter the new 
millennium stronger than ever,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	The IOC is meeting under pressure from sponsors, Olympic sports  
officials and even Congress to take major steps in the wake of the 
$1.2 million bribery scheme that had six members facing expulsion 
votes. 
</P>
<P>
	Sen. John McCain, the powerful Commerce Committee chairman, said  
in a letter this week to the senior Olympic official in the United 
states that ``the demand for Congress to act will be 
irrepressible'' unless the IOC adopts major reforms. 
</P>
<P>
	``The participation of U.S. athletes in the Olympic Games  
represents a vested interest by American citizens in reestablishing 
the integrity of the Olympic ideal of fairness and excellence in 
competition,'' McCain wrote to IOC vice president Anita DeFrantz. 
``This expectation of integrity extends beyond the playing fields 
and into all aspects of the Olympic movement.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In the letter, a copy of which was obtained by The Associated  
Press, McCain noted that his committee has scheduled hearings April 
14 on the Olympic scandal; that the IOC has tax-exempt status in 
the United States; and that sponsorships from U.S. corporations 
``represent a substantial majority of IOC revenues.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``In the strongest terms, let me communicate to you my hope that  
the IOC will move quickly to adopt reforms necessary to provide 
transparency and accountability to the IOC organization and 
processes,'' McCain wrote. ``Without such independent action, the 
demand for Congress to act will be irrepressible.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Another Commerce Committee member, Sen. Ted Stevens, has drawn  
up legislation that would strip the IOC of tax-exempt status, limit 
the percentage of fees sponsors can deduct from taxes and reroute 
U.S. TV rights fees through the U.S. Olympic Committee rather than 
sending the billions of dollars directly to the IOC. 
</P>
<P>
	DeFrantz called McCain's letter ``an expression of concern''  
rather than a threat. 
</P>
<P>
	``Sen. McCain understands, especially in the United States, the  
importance of sponsors to Olympic athletes,'' she said. ``I'm 
confident he knows athletes need financial support.''

<HEADLINE> IOC Chief Wins Confidence Vote </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LAUSANNE, Switzerland (AP) -- In her years in the Olympics, first  
as an athlete, now as a leader, Anita DeFrantz has known the joy 
the games can bring. 
</P>
<P>
	This week, she feels the sadness.  
</P>
<P>
	DeFrantz and 90 International Olympic Committee colleagues  
gathered today for a historic meeting that could strip their ranks 
of members for the first time. 
</P>
<P>
	Six IOC delegates -- three from Africa, two from South America  
and one from Samoa -- were to present their cases to the rank and 
file, then wait to hear if the expulsions imposed by IOC leaders in 
January would be upheld. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's sad,'' DeFrantz said Tuesday. ``It's disappointing to me,  
the actions some IOC members have taken. ... I think all the 
reports are very clear. We take an oath of office that we are 
`accorded the honor' of serving the IOC. The reports show that 
their actions were without honor.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The expulsions imposed by the leadership will be a first in the  
panel's 105 years and result from a scheme to buy votes for Salt 
Lake City's winning bid for the 2002 Winter Games. 
</P>
<P>
	DeFrantz said it would be a decision with ``long-term impact.''  
</P>
<P>
	She said that and other actions by the IOC in the next two days  
would show federal officials the committee was serious about 
reforms, because ``the athletes demand it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In a news conference, DeFrantz said she had received a letter  
from Sen. John McCain, chairman of the Senate Commerce Committee, 
which has scheduled hearings on the Olympic corruption case for 
April 15. 
</P>
<P>
	Another committee member, Sen. Ted Stevens, has drawn up  
legislation that would strip the IOC of tax-exempt status, limit 
the percentage of fees sponsors can deduct from taxes and reroute 
U.S. TV rights fees through the U.S. Olympic Committee rather than 
sending the billions of dollars directly to the IOC. 
</P>
<P>
	But DeFrantz, who has been briefed regularly on the Senate  
measures, said McCain's letter was ``an expression of concern'' 
rather than a threat. 
</P>
<P>
	``Sen. McCain understands, especially in the United States, the  
importance of sponsors to Olympic athletes,'' she said. ``I'm 
confident he knows athletes need financial support.'' 
</P>
<P>
	DeFrantz said she hoped to be asked to testify at the hearings.  
</P>
<P>
	``What I think about is how to save the athletes who are  
training for 2000, 2002, 2004 and 2006, and how to make sure there 
will be games for them,'' she said. ``If that means talking to 
members of Congress or members of the American public, that is what 
I will do.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Closed-door sessions, votes by acclamation and behind-the-scenes  
deals are still the order of the day as the IOC convenes a 
watershed general assembly to deal with its biggest crisis. 
</P>
<P>
	Closely watching the outcome will be the corporate sponsors who  
pay hundreds of millions of dollars to finance the games. Worried 
that their investment will be devalued by continuing scandal, the 
sponsors have told the IOC to act decisively or risk a revolt. 
</P>
<P>
	With critics outside the IOC calling for him to resign,  
president Juan Antonio Samaranch received a resounding 86-2 vote of 
confidence from the membership. 
</P>
<P>
	``Everybody wants to get through these two days calmly,''  
Italian member Mario Pescante said. ``We have to close the matter 
as soon as possible. People must put water on the fire, not 
petrol.''

<HEADLINE> Hughes Invests $1.4B in Network </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	EL SEGUNDO, Calif. (AP) -- Hughes Electronics Corp. is investing  
$1.4 billion in the advanced Spaceway global satellite network, 
promising high-speed and affordable two-way communications between 
consumers and companies. 
</P>
<P>
	The first system is expected to begin in North America in 2002  
and eventually be marketed in regions worldwide. 
</P>
<P>
	Customers will be able to transmit and receive data, voice,  
video, audio and multimedia but only pay for the amount of 
bandwidth needed to communicate with high-speed corporate networks. 
</P>
<P>
	Spaceway will provide access for everyone from large businesses  
to home office users to two-way, high speed applications including 
desktop video conferencing, according to a company statement. 
Hughes said the applications would be less expensive than those 
offered by current land-based systems. 
</P>
<P>
	The Federal Communications System has allocated orbital slots to  
Hughes to operate the satellite system. 
</P>
<P>
	Customers will no longer have to go through a retransmission  
service or hub but will be able to communicate directly via 
satellite, company officials said. 
</P>
<P>
	``Hughes is the market leader in satellite business networks,  
satellite Internet access, satellite manufacturing, satellite-based 
direct-to-home entertainment and satellite services,'' said Michael 
T. Smith, chairman of Hughes Electronics. 
</P>
<P>
	He said Spaceway would provide the most advanced satellite  
platform in the world. 
</P>
<P>
	Hughes, through its Hughes Network Systems unit, will develop  
terminals and ground infrastructure. Another subsidiary, PanAmSat, 
will operate the telemetry and Hughes-owned DIRECTV will market 
several data services to subscribers. 
</P>
<P>
	DIRECTV has about 4.5 million subscribers.

<HEADLINE>  Japanese Parliament OKs Budget </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TOKYO (AP) -- Japan's budget for fiscal 1999, meant to revive the  
sputtering economy, passed into law today even though a chamber of 
Parliament voted against the record-high spending package. 
</P>
<P>
	The approval of the $698 billion budget was the swiftest in  
postwar history, and it reflects a growing urgency within the 
government to reinvigorate the world's second-largest economy. 
</P>
<P>
	``Speedy establishment of the budget demonstrates how important  
the matter is,'' Prime Minister Keizo Obuchi told reporters today. 
</P>
<P>
	The legislation boosts government spending by 5.4 percent and  
calls for $85.2 billion in new public works. It is combined with a 
plan to slash taxes by $77 billion. 
</P>
<P>
	Opposition parties rejected the budget in Parliament's upper  
house, where the ruling coalition is in the minority, but the vote 
was a formality as the bill had already passed the more powerful 
lower house. 
</P>
<P>
	Obuchi said he had instructed his Cabinet to boost the economy  
by concentrating on public works projects, assistance to small and 
midsize companies and keeping loans affordable for new homeowners. 
</P>
<P>
	The measures are widely expected to bring short-term relief to  
Japan's economy, but critics fear that extra spending will delay 
the painful process of making Japanese industry more efficient. 
</P>
<P>
	There are also worries that the budget will dangerously inflate  
Japan's staggering national debt, already one of the highest in the 
industrialized world. Japan's government will have to float a 
record $606 billion worth of bonds to finance the package. 
</P>
<P>
	Obuchi has vowed to make fiscal 1999, which begins April 1, the  
year Japan's economy returns to the growth track after two straight 
years of recession. 
</P>
<P>
	Last week, the government announced that the economy had shrunk  
for the fifth straight quarter. But on Monday, the Economic 
Planning Agency said the economy was showing signs of bottoming 
out. 
</P>
<P>
	The budget includes large increases for spending on social  
security, scientific research and programs to retrain unemployed 
workers. 
</P>
<P>
	Military spending will slip 0.2 percent as Tokyo cancels or  
postpones purchases of new ships and aircraft. But the budget adds 
$8 million to begin study of a joint ballistic missile defense 
system with the United States.

<HEADLINE> Remains of 3 Vietnam MIAs ID'd </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Pentagon said Wednesday it has identified  
the remains of three American servicemen who had been listed as 
missing from the Vietnam War. 
</P>
<P>
	They are Navy Cmdr. John C. Mape of San Francisco, Air Force  
Maj. John E. Bailey of Minneapolis, and Navy Petty Officer 2nd 
Class John F. Hartzheim of Appleton, Wis. 
</P>
<P>
	Mape was flying an armed reconnaissance mission over North  
Vietnam on April 13, 1966, when his A-1H Skyraider was destroyed by 
a surface-to-air missile. Remains illegally excavated and removed 
from the site were confiscated by Vietnamese authorities in 1994 
and given to U.S. officials. They turned out to be from Mape. 
</P>
<P>
	Bailey was on a combat strike mission over North Vietnam on May  
10, 1966, when his F-105D Thunderchief slammed into the ground with 
its canopy in place. His remains were recovered from the site 
during a joint U.S.-Vietnamese excavation in August 1995. 
</P>
<P>
	Hartzheim was on board an OP-2E Neptune flying a reconnaissance  
mission over Laos on Feb. 27, 1968, when the plane was hit by a 
37mm antiaircraft round. Shrapnel from the explosion struck 
Hartzheim and he was unable to parachute from the plane before it 
crashed. 
</P>
<P>
	A series of visits to the crash site by joint U.S.-Lao teams in  
1994-96 recovered the remains. 
</P>
<P>
	With the accounting of Mape, Bailey and Hartzheim, 2,069  
Americans are now listed as unaccounted-for from the Vietnam War.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Plans News Conference </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Clinton will hold his first full  
White House news conference in nearly a year Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	The session, at 2 p.m. EST in the East Room, comes five weeks  
after Clinton was acquitted in a Senate impeachment trial of 
charges of perjury and obstruction of justice. 
</P>
<P>
	``We haven't done one for a while,'' presidential spokesman Joe  
Lockhart said. ``The president thought it was about time to do 
one.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Lockhart said Clinton would begin having news conferences on a  
more regular basis. He said it might be ``a little ambitious'' to 
plan on a news conference every month, ``but we can certainly 
try.'' Clinton also has begun meeting with reporters in informal, 
off-the-record sessions to try to repair relations after a 
scandal-strained year. 
</P>
<P>
	Although he has held numerous news conferences with foreign  
leaders with limited questioning over the last few months, this 
will be Clinton's first full news conference at the White House 
since April 30, 1998.

<HEADLINE> Studios Spend Millions Wooing Oscar </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Millions of dollars are spent to sway voters.  
Glossy ads deluge newspapers and TV. Backslapping campaign 
officials work the crowds. 
</P>
<P>
	All this effort isn't for the White House -- it's for an Oscar.  
</P>
<P>
	This year's race for the Academy Awards, which officially ended  
Tuesday with the deadline for voters to submit their ballots, has 
been reminiscent of an expensive political campaign. 
</P>
<P>
	With the movies ``Saving Private Ryan'' and ``Shakespeare in  
Love'' locked in what appears to be a tight race for the best 
picture Oscar, the studios have expended enormous time, effort and 
cash to influence Academy Award voters. 
</P>
<P>
	The four studios behind the five movies nominated for best  
picture have so far spent at least $9 million, with DreamWorks and 
Miramax leading the way. 
</P>
<P>
	That works out to $1,600 for each of the 5,557 members of the  
Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences eligible to vote. 
</P>
<P>
	One studio official has had enough and is talking campaign  
reform. 
</P>
<P>
	``I hope the Academy will take a look at this process and get  
involved in some kind of reform,'' said Terry Press, marketing 
chief of DreamWorks, which released ``Saving Private Ryan.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The executive administrator of the Academy isn't holding his  
breath. 
</P>
<P>
	``In my experience that actually hasn't ever come up,'' said Ric  
Robertson. ``I'm not even sure that it would be within our rights 
to try to restrict the amount of money a company spends on 
advertising.'' 
</P>
<P>
	That leaves self-regulation, and there are signs of second  
thoughts. Harvey Weinstein, co-chair of Miramax Films, said in a 
recent interview with The Washington Post that he may reconsider 
his ways next year. 
</P>
<P>
	``Maybe we did go too far,'' he told the Post. ``I hope not.''  
</P>
<P>
	For weeks, DreamWorks has been in a tough marketing battle with  
Miramax, whose ``Shakespeare in Love'' and ``Life is Beautiful'' 
have emerged as contenders with ``Saving Private Ryan.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Academy members are often invited to lavishly catered screenings  
of the film, where studio officials hope to woo undecided voters. 
Souvenirs and soundtracks are offered -- all emblazoned with the 
film's logo. 
</P>
<P>
	Oscar campaign money has flowed more freely this season than it  
has in recent memory, a stark change from last year's relatively 
low-key race when ``Titanic'' rolled over the competition. 
</P>
<P>
	Miramax West Coast President Mark Gill said this year's campaign  
for best picture honors has drawn more attention because of the 
close race. 
</P>
<P>
	``It shouldn't come as any surprise that we're doing this,'' he  
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Exactly how much studios have spent this year is difficult to  
pin down: They are under no obligation to report spending and the 
line between Oscar marketing and larger marketing efforts is often 
blurry. 
</P>
<P>
	Press said DreamWorks spent ``probably double'' what it intended  
on ``Saving Private Ryan'' because of the aggressive campaign by 
Miramax. She declined to provide figures. 
</P>
<P>
	Studio sources put DreamWorks' spending at about $4 million.  
That figure includes print ads, TV commercials and copying and 
mailing special Academy cassettes of ``Saving Private Ryan.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Gramercy Pictures and 20th Century Fox are believed to have  
spent less than $1 million each on their respective campaigns for 
``Elizabeth'' and ``The Thin Red Line.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Miramax sources have placed its Oscar campaign costs for  
``Shakespeare in Love'' at about $2 million and at about $1.3 
million for ``Life is Beautiful,'' with most of the money spent on 
trade ads, travel expenses and videos. 
</P>
<P>
	Another $1.1 million was spent on recent newspaper and  
television advertising for ``Shakespeare in Love'' in New York and 
Los Angeles, with the dual purpose of reaching both Academy voters 
and ticket buyers. 
</P>
<P>
	The Oscars will be presented Sunday night.

<HEADLINE> NY Statue To Comply With Leash Law </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- It's only a bronze statue -- a dog that can't run  
wild, chase cars or bite anyone -- but that doesn't make it exempt 
from the city's leash laws. 
</P>
<P>
	In the wake of the city's crackdown on leash law violators, the  
creator of a life-sized park statue called ``Man &AMP; His Dog'' 
reaffirmed Tuesday that his work will include a leash. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've always intended to have a leash. Because a man wouldn't  
sit on a park bench with a dog without having a leash on it,'' 
artist Jack Dowd said. ``The dog wouldn't stay there. He'd probably 
be off chasing birds.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The statue will be unveiled in Tompkins Square Park next month.  
</P>
<P>
	Parks Department officials last month began cracking down on  
those who let their dogs run free. They have proposed fining repeat 
violators as much as $1,000. 
</P>
<P>
	Officials became nervous when they saw photographs of Dowd's  
400-pound statue depicting a man sitting on a bench beside a 
leashless dog. 
</P>
<P>
	But Dowd said he had left the bronze leash off the statue  
because he feared vandals would damage it while the work was on 
display in front of galleries in Florida and Hawaii. Dowd said he 
has made adjustments to prevent the leash from being bent or 
removed.

<HEADLINE> Medicare Plan Lacks Enough Votes </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- On the eve of a final vote, leaders of a  
commission charged with reforming Medicare acknowledged Monday they 
remain one vote shy of the consensus needed to make a 
recommendation to Congress. 
</P>
<P>
	After a year of meetings, 10 of the 17 members of the National  
Bipartisan Commission on the Future of Medicare support a plan that 
would inject competition into the health insurance program for the 
elderly by letting seniors choose from a menu of options. Eleven 
votes are needed. 
</P>
<P>
	The commission, which includes Republicans, Democrats, members  
of Congress and private economists, hoped to rise above politics 
and offer Congress a blueprint for reforming a program that has 
been a magnet for political warfare. 
</P>
<P>
	But in the end, the plan is largely supported by Republicans,  
backed by just two Democrats -- Sen. John Breaux, D-La., the 
commission's chairman, and Sen. Bob Kerrey, D-Neb. 
</P>
<P>
	Breaux and co-chairman Rep. Bill Thomas, R-Calif., vowed to  
fight for it in Congress, saying they hoped to move legislation 
this year that would make their ideas law even without commission 
endorsement. 
</P>
<P>
	``What do you do? Do you just cry about it or do you introduce  
legislation based on this?'' Breaux said Monday. ``What we've got 
is very important. ... We've changed the debate in a major, major 
way, and that in my opinion is a real success.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He predicted the plan would attract at least 60 votes in the  
Senate, enough to overcome any filibuster. Thomas was less 
confident about its prospects in the House, though he said there is 
substantial support. 
</P>
<P>
	President Clinton has remained on the sidelines, though all four  
of the people he appointed to the commission have declined to 
support the Breaux-Thomas plan. It is unclear whether Clinton will 
support the plan if and when it moves through Congress. 
</P>
<P>
	Breaux said Clinton has declined to tell him whether he will  
eventually support the plan but said he was hopeful. Senate 
Majority Leader Trent Lott was less optimistic, saying he was 
discouraged that none of Clinton's appointees supported the plan. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a sign to me that apparently he's going to try and  
politicize Medicare instead of introduce real reform,'' Lott said 
Monday on PBS' ``NewsHour With Jim Lehrer.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Breaux-Thomas plan would make Medicare more like health  
benefits that many companies and the federal government offer to 
workers. 
</P>
<P>
	Retirees could choose from a menu of health-insurance policies  
and get a subsidy to help cover the cost. The more expensive plans 
would require participants to pay more out of their own pockets. 
Meanwhile, the government-run system that serves most retirees now 
would compete with the private health plans, which would have to 
offer similar coverage. 
</P>
<P>
	The plan would also gradually raise the eligibility age from 65  
to 67, though it would not require wealthier elderly people more 
for their coverage, as was considered. 
</P>
<P>
	One of the most controversial issues has been prescription drug  
coverage, which is not part of the 34-year-old, traditional 
Medicare plan. The plan would require private companies to offer at 
least one option that includes drug coverage. The popular private 
plans that supplement Medicare coverage, known as Medigap, would be 
required to offer drugs as well. 
</P>
<P>
	Drugs would be available through the traditional Medicare  
program, too, but the elderly would have to pay for the extra cost. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton has proposed using 15 percent of the budget surplus to  
shore up Medicare, and he has suggested that the program add drug 
payments, though the details of his program are not clear. 
</P>
<P>
	The Breaux-Thomas plan does not anticipate funneling extra money  
into Medicare from the budget surplus. But the commission staff 
estimates that their plan would save the program $100 billion 
between 2000 and 2009 and enough to keep the program solvent 
through 2017. The program is now expected to go broke in about a 
decade -- just as the huge baby boom begins to retire.	   Thomas has repeatedly expressed frustration that 11 votes are 
needed to make a recommendation, given that his plan enjoys 
majority support. 
</P>
<P>
	``The fact that we don't have a super-super majority should in  
no way be judged as a failure,'' he said. ``The proposal we will 
present is, in fact, the only reasonable way to go.''

<HEADLINE> Ex-Minn. Employee Will Cooperate </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MINNEAPOLIS (AP) -- A former University of Minnesota employee  
will cooperate with an investigation of her allegations of academic 
cheating by basketball players, her lawyer says. 
</P>
<P>
	``Ultimately she'd like to cooperate in every respect, because  
she has nothing to hide,'' Miles Lord, attorney for Jan Gangelhoff, 
said Tuesday. ``And she doesn't feel that she did anything wrong. 
All she did is try to help where help was needed.'' 
</P>
<P>
	University President Mark Yudof is expected to announce Thursday  
which law firm will handle the probe. 
</P>
<P>
	Bill Donohue, university associate general counsel, left a  
message on Gangelhoff's home answering machine Tuesday, telling her 
directly for the first time that university officials wanted to 
meet with her. He said the university would like to review an 
estimated 400 research and test papers she said she wrote for 
basketball players. 
</P>
<P>
	The Saint Paul Pioneer Press reported the allegations in a  
copyright story last Wednesday. Gangelhoff told the newspaper she 
had done course work for at least 20 basketball players from 1993 
to 1998 when she was an office manager in the academic counseling 
unit. 
</P>
<P>
	Last fall, Gangelhoff was angered when university officials  
failed to speak with her before sending her a letter 
``disassociating'' her from the men's basketball program. She cited 
that incident as one of the reasons she talked about the 
allegations of academic fraud. 
</P>
<P>
	A day after the story broke, players Miles Tarver, Antoine  
Broxsie, Kevin Clark and Jason Stanford were declared ineligible 
for last Thursday's NCAA tournament game in Seattle. Minnesota lost 
75-63 to Gonzaga. 
</P>
<P>
	Tarver and Broxsie have hired attorneys. Stanford said he is  
considering hiring a lawyer, and attorney Earl Gray said Clark has 
contacted him. 
</P>
<P>
	The attorneys for Tarver and Broxsie question whether the  
players' rights of due process were violated in the wake of the 
allegations, specifically whether they should have been allowed 
counsel before being questioned. 
</P>
<P>
	Mark Rotenberg, the university's general counsel, said NCAA and  
university rules did not require that the students have legal 
representation or advice before they talked to university officials 
about the allegations. He said the students knew they were being 
tape-recorded. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile Tuesday, former Gopher Kevin Loge confirmed again that  
Gangelhoff looked up answers for him on a take-home test, but said 
he didn't consider that cheating. Loge now attends Fergus Falls 
Community College.

	A cold front moved into the northern Plains early today,  
bringing the potential for snow to the Great Lakes and the Ohio 
Valley. Unseasonably warm weather dominated the East. 
</P>
<P>
	By tonight, up to 4 inches of snow were possible in parts of  
northern North Dakota and Minnesota, with lesser amounts in 
Wisconsin and Michigan. 
</P>
<P>
	Snow was also possible in the mountains of the Southwest, where  
another storm system was pushing east today. Up to 5 inches were 
possible in Arizona and New Mexico, and rain and thunderstorms were 
forecast into Texas. 
</P>
<P>
	In the Northwest, rain was possible in Oregon, Washington and  
northern California. Up to 6 inches of snow was possible in the 
mountains.

	More warm and dry weather was predicted for the Northeast, as  
well as the West and Southeast. 
</P>
<P>
	On Tuesday, several communities in Nebraska set record highs,  
including North Platte at 81 degrees, breaking the record for the 
date of 78 set in 1934. A huge range fire in north-central Nebraska 
had burned for nearly 40 miles, aided by wind and dry conditions. 
At least one home was destroyed. 
</P>
<P>
	The highest temperature reported Tuesday in the continental  
United States was 84 at Carlsbad, N.M., and Cotulla, Texas. The low

<HEADLINE> Teller Pleas in Missing Millions </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHARLOTTE, N.C. (AP) -- A former bank teller has agreed to plead  
guilty to money laundering in the last open case stemming from the 
robbery of $17 million from a vault at Loomis, Fargo &AMP; Co. 
</P>
<P>
	Kim Goodman, scheduled to go to trial in April, filed the plea  
agreement Friday, U.S. Attorney Mark Calloway said Tuesday. No 
court date was scheduled for the formal plea. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Goodman's husband, Mike Goodman, pleaded guilty Tuesday to  
money laundering. 
</P>
<P>
	Eighteen other defendants have pleaded guilty in connection with  
the heist on Oct. 4, 1997, and federal agents said they still are 
trying to find $2 million of the loot. One defendant was convicted 
of money laundering. 
</P>
<P>
	Two of the people charged in the case attracted attention when  
they went on a spending spree, moved from a small mobile home to a 
$635,000 house, buying art work, furniture and expensive cars.

<HEADLINE> Court: Sodomy Law Unconstitutional </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW ORLEANS (AP) -- Louisiana's sodomy law was thrown out  
Wednesday by a state judge who said the statute unconstitutionally 
criminalizes private sexual behavior by adults. 
</P>
<P>
	``The state has presented no evidence, much less the required  
compelling state interest, to justify its intrusion on plaintiffs' 
constitutionally protected right of privacy,'' Judge Carolyn 
Gill-Jefferson wrote. 
</P>
<P>
	The law makes consensual oral and anal sex a felony punishable  
by five years in prison. 
</P>
<P>
	The ruling was the second victory for opponents of the sodomy  
law. In February, the state 4th Circuit Court of Appeal reversed 
the conviction of a man found guilty of having oral sex with a 
woman. The appeal court said the law violated privacy rights. 
</P>
<P>
	John Rawls, attorney for the gay men and women who challenged  
the law, predicted the decision, made public Wednesday, will be 
appealed and upheld by the state Supreme Court. 
</P>
<P>
	The opinion applies to 63 parishes. A separate case governs  
Jefferson Parish in suburban New Orleans, where a judge has granted 
a temporary order suspending enforcement of the law while the case 
is heard. 
</P>
<P>
	Because it is a civil case dealing directly with a  
constitutional issue, Gill-Jefferson's case would go directly to 
the Supreme Court if the state challenges it. The 4th Circuit 
ruling is pending before the high court.

<HEADLINE> Teen Sentenced in Child's Death </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW PHILADELPHIA, Ohio (AP) -- A teen-age boy proclaimed his  
innocence Wednesday as a judge sentenced him to stay in detention 
until he is 21 for the stabbing death of a 5-year-old neighbor. 
</P>
<P>
	``I did not commit this crime,'' Anthony Harris, 13, said at his  
sentencing for the killing of Devan Duniver last June. 
</P>
<P>
	But Judge Linda Kate said she was convinced the teen had killed  
the girl. She showed Harris a picture of the crime scene and said 
that Devan's killing was beyond her comprehension. 
</P>
<P>
	Kate then imposed the maximum sentence possible, putting Harris  
in the custody of the Ohio Department of Youth Services for nearly 
eight years. 
</P>
<P>
	Harris, who was 12 when Devan was killed, could not be tried as  
an adult under state law because he was younger than 14 when the 
crime happened. 
</P>
<P>
	Devan's body was found June 28, a day after she died, underneath  
brush near the townhouses where both she and Harris lived in this 
city about 70 miles south of Cleveland. 
</P>
<P>
	The two youths played together, and Harris helped search for  
Devan after her mother reported her missing.

<HEADLINE> Simpson Does Ads for Lawyer's Group </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Is America ready to welcome O.J. Simpson back  
as a commercial spokesman? A lawyer referral service thinks so, and 
the company has videotaped him making a pitch for legal 
representation. 
</P>
<P>
	Simpson, the former spokesman for Hertz and other companies,  
said he made the appearance on behalf of Justice Media as a favor 
to a friend and because he believes in the rights of all defendants 
to have adequate legal representation. He said he was paid only 
enough to cover his expenses. 
</P>
<P>
	Simpson said the proposal interested him because it is aimed at  
minority defendants. 
</P>
<P>
	``The main thing I have learned is you can't walk into a  
courtroom without competent legal representation,'' Simpson said in 
a telephone interview Wednesday with The Associated Press. 
</P>
<P>
	The football Hall of Famer said he was grateful he had the money  
to hire the best lawyers in the business to represent him at his 
1994 criminal trial. He was acquitted on charges of murdering 
ex-wife Nicole Brown Simpson and Ronald Goldman after a trial with 
a defense focused on racism and alleged misconduct by the Los 
Angeles Police Department. 
</P>
<P>
	Simpson was found liable for the deaths of Ms. Simpson and  
Goldman in a separate civil trial and was ordered to pay $33.5 
million in damages. Any income he receives can be seized by the 
estate of Ms. Simpson and the Goldman family to satisfy the 
judgment. 
</P>
<P>
	Some wonder if a referral from Simpson would help a lawyer's  
business. 
</P>
<P>
	``The message is not bad, but people may have problems with the  
messenger,'' said Laurie Levenson, associate dean of Loyola 
University Law School. 
</P>
<P>
	``Assuming they are targeting an African-American audience, it's  
still iffy,'' she said. ``And it's kind of sad. Isn't there anybody 
else in the African-American community who can speak out for 
justice?'' 
</P>
<P>
	Simpson said he has been following a number of recent cases in  
which defendants convicted long ago were released from prison. 
</P>
<P>
	``These people lost years of their lives,'' Simpson said. ``If  
any of them had the money to properly defend themselves, maybe they 
wouldn't have had to spend any time in jail.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``I was innocent,'' he said, ``but what if I had had to wait 16  
years to be vindicated?'' 
</P>
<P>
	He acknowledged a lot of people are convinced he is guilty but  
said that reflects a public unwillingness to believe that police do 
bad things. 
</P>
<P>
	Asked if he has any new evidence that might help convince the  
public of his innocence, he said, ``I'm working on it.''

<HEADLINE> Designers Prepare Oscar Fashions </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- It will be the moment she's been waiting for  
all her life. The star who wins the Oscar as best actress will 
sweep to the stage swathed in silk or spangles, her hair done up 
just so and her makeup a work of art. 
</P>
<P>
	Millions of eyes will be sizing up her appearance, and by then  
everyone will know who created her spectacular dress. 
</P>
<P>
	``My dear, WHO are you wearing?'' the interviewers will ask as  
she wends her way down the red carpet in the glare of TV lights. 
</P>
<P>
	The star will oblige with the designer's name and maybe do a  
twirl or two to show off the dress. 
</P>
<P>
	And why not? It's the least she can do since the gown is either  
on loan or is a gift from a designer who knows the value of 
publicity and the impact of Oscars night on fashion. 
</P>
<P>
	``Designers will make history if they do something different for  
the Academy Awards,'' said Fred Hayman, a perennial arbiter of 
style for the starry set. 
</P>
<P>
	``Whoever designs Gwyneth Paltrow's gown will become very famous  
that night,'' said Hayman of the actress who is the front-runner in 
the Oscar race. ``The show is almost as much about clothes as it is 
about movies.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ostensibly, the Oscars are about celebrating movies. But the  
faithful who tune in early each year for the pre-show know there's 
another angle, one at least as intriguing as who wins best picture: 
Who's wearing what. 
</P>
<P>
	Phillip Bloch, a stylist who puts together ``total concepts''  
for star appearances, said he has been besieged by designers who 
want the stars to wear their fashions. 
</P>
<P>
	``The red carpet is worth more to them than any runway,'' Bloch  
said. ``They send dresses, handbags, bras. They ask, 'Can you get 
my stuff on anybody?''' 
</P>
<P>
	Valentino, an Italian couture house, sends sketches to stars in  
advance, then tailors the gowns specifically to their needs. An 
off-the-rack Valentino, which costs about $5,000, would never do 
for the Oscar nominees, whose dresses are in the $40,000 range. 
</P>
<P>
	Best actress nominee Emily Watson will be wearing a Valentino  
this year. So will the wives of two producers of ``Saving Private 
Ryan.'' 
</P>
<P>
	So what will other stars be wearing?  
</P>
<P>
	Individual choices are guarded secrets until the last minute,  
but a survey of design watchers suggests that glamour is back in 
style. 
</P>
<P>
	A fashion show staged by the movie academy before the awards was  
a dazzling display of ball gowns with dramatic bustles and trains 
and beaded slip dresses that hugged those all-too-perfect bodies. 
One ensemble featured a bright pink full-length marabou feather 
coat. 
</P>
<P>
	``The gowns are gorgeous this year,'' said Mr. Blackwell, the  
normally acid-tongued purveyor of the worst-dressed list. ``If 
these gowns show up on the stage, I'll be out of business.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Colors were bright, almost garish, from fuchsia to orange to  
cobalt blue and peach. The classic little black dress was nowhere 
to be seen in the academy show coordinated by Hayman. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm tired of black and just wanted to see some brighter  
colors,'' Hayman said. 
</P>
<P>
	The fashion industry will be watching for trends, and so will  
America's women. 
</P>
<P>
	``There are trends that come out of the Academy Awards,'' said  
Elizabeth Reed of Valentino. ``After Minnie Driver wore a burgundy 
dress to last year's awards, everyone was buying burgundy. ... The 
trend in fashion right now is colors, especially pastels. But black 
is never completely out. On certain people it's the right color, 
especially if they have a dark complexion.'' 
</P>
<P>
	For male stars, there are also variations on the classic tuxedo.  
In the academy fashion show, Tommy Hilfiger showed a black leather 
tux with black boots. Shanghai Tang added an Asian touch with black 
velvet frog closures. 
</P>
<P>
	And it's not just dresses that will get attention.  
</P>
<P>
	Kathrine Baumann has designed two purple heart handbags to honor  
the film, ``Saving Private Ryan.'' 
</P>
<P>
	One of the handbags was made for actress Kate Capshaw, wife of  
Steven Spielberg, and is worth $40,000. The other limited edition 
bag, crafted in solid gold with diamonds and a 35-carat amethyst, 
has a price tag of $250,000. This bag will be carried to the Oscars 
by Rita Wilson, wife of nominee Tom Hanks. After the Oscars, the 
purple heart bags will be auctioned off for charity. 
</P>
<P>
	Other celebrity bags -- a $35,000 queen's crown for ``Elizabeth''  
nominee Cate Blanchett and a $30,000 baby grand piano for music 
nominee Carole Bayer Sager -- will be presented to them as gifts. 
</P>
<P>
	Extravagant diamond necklaces and other jewelry will mostly be  
on loan from society jewelers. 
</P>
<P>
	Shoes are of such concern that designer Stuart Weitzman is  
suspending work on all other shoes this week to concentrate on 
creating rhinestone-studded sandals for Lisa Kudrow and glamour 
shoes for nominees Lynn Redgrave and Brenda Blethyn. 
</P>
<P>
	Will the audience ever wear clothes as elegant as these?  
Probably not. ``It's all about dreams,'' Bloch said. ``The greatest 
thing you can accomplish is to have a little kid go to sleep after 
the Oscars and say, 'When I grow up I want to be a glamorous movie 
star like so-and-so.'''

</P>
<P>
	In 1990, the NBA became the first American professional league

Phoenix Suns and the Utah Jazz opened the 1990-1991 season in 
Tokyo. 
</P>
<P>

<HEADLINE> It's Been a Dark Spring Training </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TAMPA, Fla. (AP) -- Word about Kerry Wood spread swiftly. Bad  
news tends to travel fast, and there's been a lot of it lately in 
baseball. 
</P>
<P>
	Joe Torre, Andres Galarraga and Mike Lowell were diagnosed with  
cancer. Joe DiMaggio died, and a minor league pitcher was killed in 
a car crash. 
</P>
<P>
	Moises Alou wrecked his knee, Kerry Ligtenberg threw out his  
elbow. And now, Wood is out for the year. 
</P>
<P>
	``It brings everything into perspective about the game and how  
quickly it can come and go,'' New York Yankees pitcher Roger 
Clemens said Tuesday night. 
</P>
<P>
	``One day Joe (Torre) is talking upbeat about his situation,  
then you see and hear about Kerry and Galarraga and his 
situation,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Supposed to be a time of hope and optimism, this has instead  
turned into a spring training full of sickness and severe injuries. 
</P>
<P>
	``You think about all the wonderful things that happened in  
baseball last year -- McGwire and Sosa, Kerry Wood having his great 
rookie year and Joe Torre winning 114 games with the Yankees -- and 
you wonder if things are trying to balance out now with a lot of 
bad things,'' Houston manager Larry Dierker said. 
</P>
<P>
	The rash of ill fortune has become topic No. 1 in some spring  
locker rooms, more so than talk about the early exhibition home 
runs hit by Mark McGwire and Sammy Sosa. 
</P>
<P>
	``There are always injuries in spring training, but I've never  
seen so many stars get hurt,'' Detroit outfielder Luis Polonia said 
in Lakeland, Fla. ``There have been a lot of big names this year.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Wood became this spring's latest victim when the Chicago Cubs  
learned their 21-year-old pitcher would probably miss the season 
because of an elbow injury. The setback not only took away the 
team's strikeout ace, but robbed the sport of one of its most 
exciting phenoms. 
</P>
<P>
	``That is not good for baseball,'' Atlanta manager Bobby Cox  
said. ``I don't like to face the guy, but he's a special, special 
pitcher. We need those to come along in the game like that who 
really pack them in. It's too bad for him, too bad for baseball.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Atlanta lost Galarraga last month on the same day pitchers and  
catchers were to report to camp. The first baseman, who hit .305 
with 44 home runs and 121 RBIs, will miss the season because of 
lymphoma. 
</P>
<P>
	The Braves also will be minus Ligtenberg for at least a month,  
and possibly the whole year. Coming off a rookie season in which he 
recorded 30 saves, Ligtenberg partially tore a ligament in his 
right elbow last week. 
</P>
<P>
	Dierker and the Astros are trying to make up for the loss of  
Alou, expected to miss most of the season, if not all of it. 
</P>
<P>
	The All-Star outfielder, who hit .312 with 38 homers and 124  
RBIs, tore the anterior cruciate ligament in his left knee last 
month when he fell off a treadmill at home. 
</P>
<P>
	The Yankees' camp has been subdued. First, Joe DiMaggio died.  
Then, Torre disclosed he had prostate cancer. 
</P>
<P>
	Torre, who led the Yankees to an AL-record 114 victories and the  
World Series championship, will undergo surgery Thursday. He did 
not set a date for his return, though he managed to maintain his 
humor in discussing his illness. 
</P>
<P>
	``I mentioned to someone that now I know why all of those bloop  
singles fell in last year,'' he said in Tampa. 
</P>
<P>
	Lowell, a rookie third baseman traded by the Yankees to the  
Florida Marlins last month, was diagnosed with testicular cancer a 
few days before he was supposed to start workouts. 
</P>
<P>
	Former major league pitcher Ken Robinson was killed in a car  
crash on Feb. 28, shortly before he was to report to Arizona's 
minor league camp. He was buried in his Diamondbacks uniform, and 
the car's driver, teammate John Rosengren, was indicted on a 
manslaughter charge. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1993, Cleveland pitchers Steve Olin and Tim Crews were killed  
and Bob Ojeda was injured in a boating accident on Little Lake 
Nellie near the Indians' camp in Winter Haven, Fla.

<HEADLINE> Gore Pushes Down-Home Image </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- When Vice President Al Gore opened his Iowa  
campaign this week, his privileged upbringing as the son of a 
senator was nowhere in sight. Instead, he talked about how he 
slopped hogs, drove mules, built homes and cleared land -- by hand 
and with a double-bladed ax, no less. 
</P>
<P>
	The man running for president was a boy who lived and was  
schooled in the rarefied air of Washington, spending summers and 
congressional breaks on the family farm in Tennessee. But as far as 
Iowans could tell, it was all sweat and no refinement. 
</P>
<P>
	Solid and savvy by reputation, Gore goes into his presidential  
campaign with a thus-far small but nagging question -- is he also 
one to embellish his past? 
</P>
<P>
	To his defenders, a misstep here and there is inconsequential in  
such a long run under the public eye. To critics, he has shown a 
vain streak likely to become increasingly exposed in the rough and 
tumble of the emerging campaign. 
</P>
<P>
	If Gore has a tendency toward puffery, it has yet to register  
with the public. When pollster Andrew Kohut of the Pew Research 
Center asks people for quick characterizations of the vice 
president, he gets a mix like `good,' `boring,' `OK,' `unexciting' 
and `stable.' 
</P>
<P>
	Gore laid it on thick in Iowa, contending in a round of  
appearances and interviews that he was a small-business person and 
a homebuilder. ``I lived on a farm,'' he went on, and learned how 
to plow a ``steep hillside'' with mules, hose out the hog waste and 
``take up hay all day long in the hot sun.'' 
</P>
<P>
	His spokesman, Chris Lehane, said Gore still owns his farm in  
Carthage, Tenn. -- the land is currently leased -- and spent some 
time in the early 1970s in a real estate project as well as his 
youthful summers as a family farm hand. ``These are all part of his 
life experience,'' he said, and when Gore goes around the country, 
``he looks for the opportunity to share those life experiences.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Gore's ruminations were meant to contrast himself with rival  
Bill Bradley, the former pro basketball player, who has tried to 
paint the vice president as a career-long politician. The last time 
Gore tried to draw distinctions with Bradley, a week earlier, he 
overstepped. 
</P>
<P>
	Republicans threw gleeful barbs when Gore suggested then that  
he'd created the Internet, that huge, amorphous communications 
vehicle that got rolling long before he entered politics. More than 
a year ago, he claimed he and his wife were models for the romantic 
novel ``Love Story,'' leaving the author of that book 
``befuddled.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The ribbing over the Internet claim was playful, but the GOP  
obviously senses future opportunity to hammer the early favorite 
for the Democratic nomination. 
</P>
<P>
	``Earnest boastfulness does not play well,'' said William  
Kristol, editor of the conservative Weekly Standard magazine. As 
former chief of staff for Vice President Dan Quayle, Kristol has 
painful personal knowledge of how a public figure's blunders can 
blow up in one's face. 
</P>
<P>
	``Certain gaffes hurt when they fit into a stereotype,'' he  
said. ``I think Gore's comment taking credit for the Internet is an 
example of that. I think it's a damaging gaffe because it 
reinforces something out there.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Andrei Cherny, senior speechwriter for Gore in 1997 and 1998,  
disputes that view. He also contends Gore, whose stiffness is the 
stuff of self-parody, won't become even more so out of fear of 
saying something silly. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's been in public life for almost a quarter century now and  
has been under a great deal of scrutiny for at least the past seven 
years,'' said Cherny, now editing a magazine of Democratic ideas 
called Blueprint. ``I think in many ways he is who he is, and 
that's not going to change because of ... one stray remark.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In December 1997, Gore told a reporter he and Tipper Gore were  
models for the characters in ``Love Story,'' Erich Segal's 1970s 
bestseller. A surprised Segal said Gore, whom he knew at Harvard, 
inspired one side of his male hero's personality -- the one 
controlled by a domineering father -- but his book had nothing to do 
with Mrs. Gore. 
</P>
<P>
	Back in his 1988 campaign for the presidential nomination, Gore  
defended his use of a brochure with a picture of him carrying an 
M-16 rifle in Vietnam, denying he was trying to make people think 
he served in combat. He had also appeared in TV ads wearing an 
olive-green field jacket and saying: ``I'm a Vietnam veteran -- one 
of the lucky ones.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Gore spent five months in Vietnam as a military information  
officer, a noncombat role that he says included brushes with enemy 
fire. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1988, he said he helped develop a subdivision on his father's  
land over several years starting in 1969, when he was also 
attending university and working as a journalist. Gore ``came by a 
time or two, but not too often,'' the contractor for the nine-house 
project told The Philadelphia Inquirer in 1988. 
</P>
<P>
	Gore responded then that he had helped lay out the subdivision,  
pick blueprints, negotiate with county officials and test soil, 
among other duties.

<HEADLINE> Vote Expected on Netscape-AOL Deal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MOUNTAIN VIEW, Calif. (AP) -- Shortly after America Online Inc.  
revealed it would buy Netscape Communications Corp., AOL chairman 
Steve Case flew out to the Web software pioneer's headquarters to 
address its workers. The subject was hairy. 
</P>
<P>
	``You can still bring your dogs to work,'' he told a cheering  
crowd of 2,000 Netscape employees. 
</P>
<P>
	That comment, related by several attendees, seemed no small  
concession from a company whose cautious corporate culture, some 
feared, could snuff out the freewheeling creativity of Netscape. 
</P>
<P>
	Netscape shareholders vote today on the $9.9 billion deal. If  
they say yes, as expected, the merger could close shortly after. 
But the real work in combining these very different companies is 
just starting. 
</P>
<P>
	AOL's ability to soothe Netscape's coveted army of software  
designers is key to creating what could be a powerful new threat to 
Microsoft's computer software dominance. 
</P>
<P>
	Once the deal is completed, AOL becomes the distributor of  
Netscape's Internet browser software and adds the Netcenter Web 
site, giving it two of the four most popular Internet destinations. 
Also part of the deal, Sun Microsystems Inc., a maker of business 
software and computers, will distribute Netscape's corporate 
software for three years. 
</P>
<P>
	So far, AOL's assurances to Netscape staff appear to be working.  
Common goals, such as making the Internet easy to navigate, are 
helping to bridge the divide of culture and distance. 
</P>
<P>
	Relatively few Netscape employees have quit since the Nov. 24  
agreement, thanks in part to Case's promise to pay an extra month's 
salary as a bonus for sticking around. Others are waiting for 
Netscape stock options to take effect so they can sell stock at fat 
profits. 
</P>
<P>
	Netscape's Marc Andreessen, who co-invented the first widely  
used browser for finding and retrieving Internet information, 
signed on as chief technology officer of AOL. 
</P>
<P>
	``The reason I'm here is because they have a really good  
story,'' Andreessen, 27, said Monday from his car phone near AOL's 
Dulles, Va. headquarters. Though not discussing pay, he recently 
bought a Virginia ``starter palace'' so he can shuttle from his 
Palo Alto, Calif. home. The hardest choice is which home his three 
dogs will live in. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, the differences that make the marriage a leap of faith  
were apparent in visits this year to the companies' headquarters 
3,000 miles apart. 
</P>
<P>
	It's tough to find AOL subscribers, and there are 16 million of  
them, in Netscape's Mountain View, Calif. offices. While Netscape 
created the tool for people to surf the Net on their own, AOL 
supplies neatly organized channels of information for ``newbies,'' 
or Internet beginners who otherwise might be groping. 
</P>
<P>
	Netscape conference rooms are named after Dennis the Menace and  
other cartoon characters. One top software manager wore his hair 
shoulder-length, and sported black fingernail polish and a T-shirt 
emblazoned with a heavy-metal band logo. 
</P>
<P>
	In contrast, America Online's halls are dotted with posters  
touting ``Valued Work Behaviors'' and ``Valued Leadership 
Abilities.'' While many of its 10,000 employees playfully decorate 
their offices -- giant chess pieces adorn the online games 
department -- the company's corporate-sounding ``Mission Statement'' 
is carved into common entrances. 
</P>
<P>
	Such platitudes seem bound to rankle freer spirits.  
</P>
<P>
	While AOL pledges to keep Netscape autonomous with separate  
headquarters and staff, it may merge some overlapping parts. 
Netscape also could be hit by cuts in divisions that make software 
already made by Sun Microsystems, observers say. Morale may suffer 
due to the departure of James Barksdale, Netscape's well-liked 
chief executive. 
</P>
<P>
	The physical distance is a challenge; staff needs to spend  
longer hours swapping e-mails and shuttling cross-country. ``The 
issue is it takes a lot of stamina and a lot of willingness to 
communicate through a longer day,'' said Barry Obrand of Russell 
Reynolds Associates Inc., a Silicon Valley recruiting firm. 
</P>
<P>
	Yet similarities could help smooth things.  
</P>
<P>
	Both companies arose in the Internet's dawn, and are infused  
with go-getter mentalities. 
</P>
<P>
	They repeatedly ``morphed'' to survive -- AOL by linking its  
members-only online service to the broader Internet, and Netscape 
by going from just browsers to building corporate software and a 
Web site geared toward businesses. 
</P>
<P>
	AOL already has practice preserving the unique identities of  
acquired companies. 
</P>
<P>
	Despite concerns that users of ICQ, a sophisticated instant  
messaging service AOL bought last June, would flee, membership has 
soared. CompuServe, the competing members-only online service also 
bought by AOL, retains its Columbus, Ohio headquarters and much of 
its staff. 
</P>
<P>
	``We learned some things about respecting the special cultural  
ways of companies involved'' in acquisitions, said AOL spokeswoman 
Kathy Bushkin. 
</P>
<P>
	The lack of worry permeated even Netscape's Mozilla.org unit,  
which develops the famous Navigator browser that faces an 
increasingly difficult challenge from Microsoft. 
</P>
<P>
	Asked if the takeover could quash Netscape's competitive  
essence, Mozilla.org's nail polish-wearing manager Jamie Zawinsky 
seemed nonplussed. 
</P>
<P>
	``There were a lot of people worried about that,'' he said.  
``But it sounds like business as usual.''

<HEADLINE> Train Crash a Nightmare for Victims </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NESBIT, Miss. (AP) -- The last time Cindy Lipscomb saw her two  
oldest daughters was when they kissed her goodnight and headed to 
the front sleeper car of Amtrak's City of New Orleans train. 
</P>
<P>
	The girls, Rainey, 10, and Lacey, 8, wanted to spend Monday  
night with friends who had accompanied them on a spring break trip 
to Chicago -- June Bonnin, 46, and her granddaughter, Jessica 
Whitaker, 11. 
</P>
<P>
	Less than an hour later, all four died when the train plowed  
into a tractor-trailer loaded with steel and derailed. Leaking 
diesel fuel erupted in flames. 
</P>
<P>
	Dazed but unhurt, Ms. Lipscomb searched frantically for her  
daughters. Her heart fell when she realized how bad the accident 
was. 
</P>
<P>
	``I wanted to die when I saw the flames because I knew,'' she  
told The Commercial Appeal of Memphis, Tenn. on Tuesday. ``It was 
either lay down and die or pray, and I just sat down and prayed. It 
just felt like my heart was ripped out of my chest.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Lipscomb's youngest daughter, Jesse Anne, 5, was unhurt.  
</P>
<P>
	Authorities had not officially released the names of the 11  
people killed in the crash. 
</P>
<P>
	More than 100 people were injured, including Ashley Bonnin, 8,  
Ms. Bonnin's daughter, who lost part of a leg. 
</P>
<P>
	``She thought she might be a bit able to do more to get my wife,  
June, out of that car,'' Max Bonnin said Wednesday. ``We assured 
her that she did everything that she possibly could.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Laura Bell and her 2-year-old great-grandson survived the crash,  
but her homecoming to Muskegon, Mich., was marred by another 
tragedy: A fire destroyed her home. No one was hurt, however.

<HEADLINE> Dad Sentenced in Car-Pool Accident </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PANAMA CITY, Fla. (AP) -- A father has been sentenced to 14 years  
in prison for the death of his 6-year-old daughter, who flew off 
the back of his pickup truck while sitting in a plastic swimming 
pool. 
</P>
<P>
	``I want to say this is the last thing I ever wanted to  
happen,'' Jeffrey Sakemiller said Wednesday. ``I didn't foresee it 
happening. I thought it was safe. There's nothing I can do to bring 
her back.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But the girl's mother was unforgiving.  
</P>
<P>
	``I know he loved her, but he should've known better,'' said  
Catriona's mother, Rebecca Miller. ``And as far as I'm concerned he 
can rot in that jail.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Sakemiller said he was just trying to make his daughter happy by  
letting her ride in a plastic pool they had just bought last June 
15, on the way home in the back of his truck. But wind picked up 
the pool -- with Catriona in it -- and flung them off the truck. 
</P>
<P>
	Police said the little girl apparently was not seriously hurt,  
but died when she stood up in the street and got hit by a car. 
</P>
<P>
	Sakemiller's blood-alcohol level was just over the legal limit  
at the time. His record showed he had four previous drunken driving 
convictions. 
</P>
<P>
	A jury convicted him last month of drunken driving, vehicular  
homicide, driving with a suspended license and culpable negligence 
in exposing another to injury.

<HEADLINE> Gov't Urged To Stockpile Vaccines </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Senators concerned that the nation isn't  
prepared for biological terrorism urged the government Tuesday to 
stockpile more anthrax and smallpox vaccines and to develop new 
ones. 
</P>
<P>
	Sen. Arlen Specter, R-Pa., also called on the Clinton  
administration to declassify a Pentagon list of some two dozen 
biological weapons in order to warn Americans, saying he would 
write a letter to Defense Secretary William Cohen asking him to do 
so. 
</P>
<P>
	``This ought to be on the front burner,'' Specter told a joint  
hearing of the Veterans Affairs Committee and the Appropriations 
Committee's health panel, both of which he chairs. ``The American 
people have a right to know what's happening here.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Sen. Jay Rockefeller, D-W.Va., said the United States is ``way  
behind in our efforts in dealing with bioterrorism,'' calling the 
potential danger ``extremely real.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``It is as great a threat or a greater threat than the Soviet  
Union posed to us,'' Rockefeller declared. 
</P>
<P>
	The Pentagon is inoculating all 2.4 million U.S. troops and  
reserves against anthrax to protect against possible germ warfare. 
Vaccine supplies are limited, however, since only one U.S. company 
manufactures it. 
</P>
<P>
	Anthrax kills 80 percent of those who inhale germ spores and are  
not treated. It is not spread by person and can be prevented by 
antibiotics taken before symptoms appear. 
</P>
<P>
	Smallpox is a highly contagious, untreatable virus. The disease  
was eradicated decades ago, but the former Soviet Union and other 
countries experimented with turning laboratory supplies of the 
virus into bioweapons, so the risk still exists. 
</P>
<P>
	Smallpox vaccines are no longer being manufactured, but the U.S.  
government maintains 6 million to 7 million doses of vaccine. 
</P>
<P>
	President Clinton last year ordered federal agencies to expand  
steps against possible chemical and biological attacks in the 
United States. His fiscal 2000 budget proposes boosting spending by 
$2.8 billion to safeguard against such attacks, as well as against 
assaults on sensitive computer networks. 
</P>
<P>
	The Health and Human Services Department is spending $158  
million this year to prepare for possible bioterrorism and is 
asking for $230 million next year. A top HHS priority is creating a 
stockpile of treatments and vaccines, focusing first on antibiotics 
against anthrax and the plague and enhancing the existing smallpox 
vaccine supply, U.S. officials said. 
</P>
<P>
	Specter and Rockefeller called for the development of a broader  
range of vaccines. 
</P>
<P>
	``There is a large number of biological threats for which the  
United States has no vaccine,'' Specter said. 
</P>
<P>
	Rockefeller added, ``Everything needs to be taken seriously.''  
</P>
<P>
	Margaret Hamburg, the HHS assistant secretary for planning and  
evaluation, said there is ``wide agreement in the scientific 
community'' that the United States should develop an improved 
smallpox vaccine. And she agreed other vaccines should be 
developed, but said it could take years and be costly. 
</P>
<P>
	There is a potential for runaway anti-terrorism spending,  
cautioned the General Accounting Office, the investigative arm of 
Congress. 
</P>
<P>
	``Our message is not that we should stop funding,'' said Henry  
Hinton, GAO's assistant comptroller general for national security 
and international affairs. ``What we see missing from the picture 
is ... focusing the federal machinery and resources out there to 
make sure we get to the highest part of the threats.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Hinton said intelligence assessments conclude the greatest  
terrorist threats remain conventional weapons, such as bombs that 
destroyed a federal building in Oklahoma City in 1995 and hit two 
U.S. embassies in Africa last year. 
</P>
<P>
	A Japanese cult's release of the nerve gas sarin in a Tokyo  
subway in March 1995 -- killing 12 people and injuring more than 
5,000 -- raised global concerns about bioterrorism.

<HEADLINE> Train Survivors Recount Ordeal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BOURBONNAIS, Ill. (AP) -- Sidney Knox was running late, but he  
persuaded the Amtrak conductor to hold up the City of New Orleans 
while a relative bought his ticket. Everything was working out. 
</P>
<P>
	He settled back in his seat, the windows dark as the train  
pulled out of Chicago. Like others on the train, Knox was looking 
forward to going to sleep and seeing his 6-year-old son in 
Mississippi the next day. 
</P>
<P>
	Then came a shuddering jolt. The screech of twisting metal and  
screams of pain. The darkness now reached inside the train, 
derailed at a crossing 50 miles south of Chicago after hitting a 
truck loaded with steel. 
</P>
<P>
	``When I finally realized what happened, I was on the floor,''  
Knox said. 
</P>
<P>
	Monday night's crash was the nation's deadliest railroad wreck  
in three years. 
</P>
<P>
	Fifteen passengers were Mississippi teens returning from a  
10-day Canadian ski trip with three chaperones. 
</P>
<P>
	``You could hear screaming,'' said 17-year-old Anna Fulson.  
``You could feel the car derailing .... It was like in slow motion. 
Everything was turning over. Luggage was falling. And you were 
being slammed against the ceiling and walls.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Many in the ski group were riding in a double-decker car next to  
the sleeper car where the dead were found. A locomotive smashed 
into that car and it was set ablaze. 
</P>
<P>
	``People were laying on the ground,'' said Melissa Watson, 14,  
who was playing cards in the club car when the train derailed. 
``You could hear children scream, `Where is my mom?' You could hear 
parents scream, `Where are my children?''' 
</P>
<P>
	The crash happened shortly after 9:30 p.m. as many of the  
passengers on the train to New Orleans were preparing for bed. Some 
were listening to music, others were gossiping. 
</P>
<P>
	Then it happened.  
</P>
<P>
	A twisting motion. A hurling crash that toppled some of the  
passenger cars on their sides. Then total darkness. 
</P>
<P>
	Someone lit a cigarette lighter every few seconds in the teens'  
car, which had turned on its side. Some of the boys in the group 
forced open an escape window. They began pulling out the girls, who 
used the train seats as makeshift ladders. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was like your worst nightmare of what could happen on a  
train,'' said Christina Bomgaars, 15, who recounted the night as 
she sat in a hotel lounge. ``You can't imagine the terror of not 
knowing if you're above water, if you're on a cliff, or if you're 
going to roll over.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The boys told them not to panic, but to move fast. And they did.  
</P>
<P>
	Clinton Barnette, 70, of Portland, Ore., said he helped pull  
fellow passengers from the wreckage ``until I couldn't breathe.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``There was junk everywhere. You kept falling over things,'' he  
said. ``I was shivering and shaking trying to help people. My teeth 
were chattering.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Daniella Bauman, a 28-year-old graphics designer from Melbourne,  
Australia, was riding Amtrak on a months-long trip across the 
United States. 
</P>
<P>
	She was traveling with two friends, but could not find one after  
the crash. She feared the woman had been killed, but found her at a 
hospital. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was better than winning the lottery,'' Miss Bauman said.  
``We just grabbed each other and hugged. It was such a beautiful 
moment. After seeing that horrible sight, I was just thinking, `How 
could anyone survive?''' 
</P>
<P>
	As for Knox, he intended to head back to Chicago today.  
</P>
<P>
	``I just thank my lucky stars that I'm alive. I'll go down there  
to see him next week,'' Knox said of his son. ``I don't know if 
I'll take the train, though.''

<TEXT>
<P>
	HAYWARD, Calif. (AP) -- A male stripper who performed for  
teen-age girls at a Halloween party was sentenced Wednesday to 
three years' probation and 240 hours of volunteer work. 
</P>
<P>
	Steven Schmitt, 29, had pleaded guilty to one misdemeanor count  
of participating in obscene live conduct in a public place and one 
felony count of sexual battery. 
</P>
<P>
	As part of his plea agreement, Schmitt also was ordered to pay  
$1,200 in fines and told he could not strip for anyone younger than 
21, prosecutors said. 
</P>
<P>
	His punishment may be reduced to misdemeanor probation after one  
year of good conduct. Last week, the mother of the girl who hosted 
the Oct. 30, 1998, party was sentenced to three years of probation. 
</P>
<P>
	Carye McGrath, 39, also was ordered to apologize in writing to

<HEADLINE> Organ Sales Indictment Thrown Out </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- A judge has thrown out a highly-publicized  
conspiracy case against two men charged with plotting to sell body 
parts of executed Chinese prisoners. 
</P>
<P>
	U.S. District Judge Deborah Batts tossed out the charges Monday  
against Cheng Yong Wang, a former prosecutor in China, and Xing Qi 
Fu, saying a key government witness was unreliable and that the two 
could no longer be guaranteed a fair trial. 
</P>
<P>
	Wang is a Chinese citizen and both men live in Queens.  
</P>
<P>
	The government's case relied heavily on Paul Risenhoover, an  
American who headed an organization that wanted to overthrow the 
Chinese Communist Party. He told prosecutors he had traveled to 
China with people with military training who had photographed 
various official buildings so they could figure out how to destroy 
them. 
</P>
<P>
	Prosecutors said they cut off contact with Risenhoover last  
summer after learning about his political agenda, but didn't tell 
defense lawyers until this year that he would be unavailable at the 
trial. They don't know where he is. 
</P>
<P>
	Risenhoover, Batts wrote, appears to be ``a fraudulent  
opportunist whose credibility at any stage of his involvement with 
any government entity ... should have been, and must now be, 
seriously questioned.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Prosecutors with U.S. Attorney Mary Jo White's office say they  
may appeal. 
</P>
<P>
	The case was built largely on taped conversations involving  
Risenhoover, Wang and Harry Wu, a well-known human rights activist. 
</P>
<P>
	Wu posed as a doctor and secretly videotaped Wang allegedly  
trying to arrange the sale of body parts. Afterward, Wu contacted 
the FBI, which videotaped and arrested Wang a week later. 
</P>
<P>
	Beijing has consistently denied accusations that it allows  
prisoners' organs to be sold.

<HEADLINE> Grand Jury To Get Holyfield-Lewis </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) -- A grand jury is investigating the disputed  
draw in the heavyweight title fight between Lennox Lewis and 
Evander Holyfield. 
</P>
<P>
	The panel will issue subpoenas and hear testimony about the  
judging of Saturday night's bout at Madison Square Garden, a 
spokeswoman for Manhattan District Attorney Robert Morgenthau said 
Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Spokeswoman Barbara Thompson declined to discuss what  
illegalities, if any, Morgenthau thinks could be involved. 
</P>
<P>
	One source close to the investigation, who asked not to be  
identified, said: ``We could be looking at tampering or illegal 
payments. Then again, maybe we're looking at lousy judging, which 
is not a crime.'' 
</P>
<P>
	State Attorney General Eliot Spitzer will offer Morgenthau's  
investigators ``any and all assistance in their attempt to pursue a 
criminal case,'' Spitzer spokesman Darren Dopp said. 
</P>
<P>
	Spitzer, who worked for Morgenthau for six years, canceled a  
public hearing for Friday involving many of the principals in the 
fight Lewis was widely believed to have won. 
</P>
<P>
	Among those who had been scheduled to attend were promoter Don  
King and judge Eugenia Williams, the IBF judge who had Holyfield 
winning. 
</P>
<P>
	Holyfield is the IBF and WBA heavyweight champion. Lewis of  
Britain holds the WBC title. 
</P>
<P>
	Another hearing, scheduled for Thursday in Manhattan by the  
state Senate Committee on Investigations, will go forward, 
according to its chairman, state Sen. Roy Goodman of Manhattan. 
</P>
<P>
	Among those to appear are King and Dino Duva, Lewis' American  
promoter; Bob Lee, the IBF president; Arthur Mercante Jr., the 
bout's referee; and Williams. 
</P>
<P>
	Testifying by phone will be Larry O'Connell of England, the WBC  
judge who scored the fight a draw; Stanley Christodoulou of South 
Africa, the WBA judge who declared Lewis the winner; and WBC 
president Jose Sulaiman. 
</P>
<P>
	Goodman said his hearing will focus on the judging of Saturday's  
fight, the relationships between the sanctioning bodies and the 
boxing industry and health issues involving fighters. 
</P>
<P>
	``We'll really be taking a helicopter trip over all of the  
terrain of big-time boxing and whether there were improprieties in 
this fight,'' Goodman said. 
</P>
<P>
	The New York State Athletic Commission is also investigating the  
fight. 
</P>
<P>
	U.S. Sen. John McCain of Arizona, who sat ringside at the bout,  
said Wednesday that state athletic commissions must take the lead 
in reforming professional boxing and not wait for the federal 
government to step in. 
</P>
<P>
	He added that meaningful nationwide reforms might result from  
the dispute surrounding the bout and the four investigations it has 
prompted. 
</P>
<P>
	For a start, he said, state athletic commissions should appoint  
all ringside officials at bouts and not give international 
sanctioning bodies the opportunity to place potentially biased 
judges at a fight. 
</P>
<P>
	``State commissioners should not surrender any of their  
authority to sanctioning organizations or promoters,'' McCain said 
in a letter to Spitzer. ``When they do, boxers are subject to 
manipulation and the public is cheated.'' 
</P>
<P>
	McCain has been working with a task force of state attorneys  
general, headed by Spitzer, to develop federal legislation to 
reform boxing that has been named of Muhammad Ali. 
</P>
<P>
	McCain said boxing is rife with ``conflicts of interest and  
fraudulent practices'' that contributed to the Lewis-Holyfield 
draw. 
</P>
<P>
	``The best outcome of the Holyfield-Lewis bout would be a  
complete overhaul of boxing industry abuses in America,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Lee, the IBF president, defended the work of Williams, the judge  
his organization selected for the bout. 
</P>
<P>
	``I am sure they aren't going to find anything irregular at  
all,'' he said. ``It is a subjective viewing of a fight and you 
can't tell these judges what to see or what not to see. All I tell 
them is, `Do the best you can.''' 
</P>
<P>
	Also Wednesday, two state legislators, Sen. John DeFrancisco and  
Assemblyman Paul Tokasz, filed similar bills to require that 
judges' scores be posted after every round in New York to give 
others an idea of which fighter is ahead.

<HEADLINE> Salt Lake Organizers Address Perks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LAUSANNE, Switzerland (AP) -- Salt Lake City's new master of  
Olympic frugality, sitting on a velvet couch in the marbled, 
crystal-chandeliered hotel lobby, wants IOC members to forget about 
such perks as chauffeur-driven limos when they come to the 2002 
Winter Games. 
</P>
<P>
	Cut and slash, freeze and reduce were recurring themes as Salt  
Lake Organizing Committee president Mitt Romney assessed the budget 
for IOC members before and during the games. Yet he could not help 
notice something was wrong with the picture. 
</P>
<P>
	He was sitting in one of Europe's nicest hotels, right on Lake  
Geneva, while the IOC members were in a somewhat-less-palatial inn 
uptown. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't know why I'm here. This is where the staff put me,''  
he said. It was the only time Romney was on the defensive after a 
meeting with the IOC's executive board on the eve of today's 
crucial general assembly. 
</P>
<P>
	He called on Olympic leaders to restore sponsor confidence as  
quickly as possible and outlined budget cuts that would go as deep 
as the transportation of IOC members during the Winter Games. 
</P>
<P>
	``There are no chauffeur-driven limousines. IOC members will be  
driven by volunteers in cars which have been loaned to us by 
General Motors,'' he said. He said hospitality suites and 
furnishings would suffer. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're scaling back those plans as well,'' he said. ``We all  
expect a level of frugality.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A lack of thrift by IOC members has become a benchmark of the  
scandal that has hit the Olympics. 
</P>
<P>
	Because of the scandal, Salt Lake City is still short of  
sponsors and is in dire need of a computer hardware backer. 
</P>
<P>
	``To meet our budget objective, we still need a substantial  
number of new sponsors,'' Romney said after pressing that point 
with the IOC's executive board. ``It is important to us that it be 
concluded as quickly as possible.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Salt Lake City is working on a $1.44 billion budget, but at this  
stage, making ends meet looks like a stretch, said Romney, 
necessitating a more forceful search for sponsors and ruthless 
spending cuts. 
</P>
<P>
	He said sponsorship has been scared off by the scandal.  
</P>
<P>
	``We are hopeful the IOC will take substantive action ... so  
that we will be able to meet our sponsoring objectives,'' Romney 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	And once the IOC revamps its structure and clears the cloud of  
fraud and corruption hanging over the Olympics, Romney wants 
intensified cooperation. 
</P>
<P>
	``We look forward to receiving help from the IOC in the area of  
marketing and cost budgeting,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> Paul Allen May Sell Some Stock </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Microsoft co-founder Paul Allen may sell stock  
in his growing cable TV empire to raise money for more 
acquisitions. 
</P>
<P>
	Allen's Charter Communications Inc. could sell $2 billion to $3  
billion worth of stock through an initial public offering in the 
second half of the year if market conditions remain positive, 
spokeswoman Anita Lamont said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	The IPO would be the largest ever in the cable television  
industry and could rank among the richest of any kind. 
</P>
<P>
	Allen entered the cable business last year and has been  
expanding his holdings rapidly, hoping demand will increase for 
high-speed Internet access and phone services over cable lines, 
which have much greater capacity than phone lines. 
</P>
<P>
	With the stock sale, Charter hopes to cash in on cable's  
increasing popularity on Wall Street. Investors have been bidding 
up shares of cable operators in hopes that their lines will one day 
be widely used for more than just television services. 
</P>
<P>
	That movement has already started to take shape with AT&AMP;T  
Corp.'s recent acquisition of Tele-Communications Inc. and an 
alliance with Time Warner Inc., the two biggest cable companies in 
the nation. The plan is to use those cable systems to offer 
consumers one-stop shopping for phone, Internet and TV services. 
</P>
<P>
	St. Louis-based Charter is the nation's seventh-largest cable  
operator. Five pending acquisitions, due to close by late summer, 
would give the company a total of 3.4 million subscribers, mainly 
in the Northeast, South and West. 
</P>
<P>
	Allen's first cable purchase was a $2.8 billion takeover last  
year of Marcus Cable Co., then the nation's largest privately held 
cable operator. He then acquired Charter, the 10th-largest cable 
company, for $4.5 billion and combined it with his other holdings 
under the Charter name. 
</P>
<P>
	Allen, who co-founded Microsoft Corp. with Bill Gates in 1975,  
also owns stakes in several technology companies, as well as 
football's Seattle Seahawks and basketball's Portland Trail 
Blazers.

<HEADLINE> Vietnamese Man Charged With Piracy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WESTMINSTER, Calif. (AP) -- The Vietnamese immigrant who sparked  
weeks of demonstrations by hanging a picture of Ho Chi Minh in his 
store pleaded innocent Tuesday to a felony charge of video piracy. 
</P>
<P>
	The charge against Truong Van Tran, 37, was brought after police  
raided his Little Saigon shop on March 5 and found more than 15,000 
allegedly pirated videos and 130 VCRs hooked up to one master 
machine with an original tape, said Lt. Bill Lewis. 
</P>
<P>
	Tran was released on his own recognizance and ordered to return  
to court on March 30 for another hearing. 
</P>
<P>
	Tran faces up to five years in prison if convicted. Similar  
charges brought against other video store owners in Westminister's 
Little Saigon area resulted in sentences of three to six months in 
prison, Lewis said. 
</P>
<P>
	The tapes were of Hong Kong-produced soap operas dubbed in  
Vietnamese, Lewis said. 
</P>
<P>
	The investigation began Feb. 20, when about 200 police officers  
escorted Tran through an angry crowd into his shop so he could 
rehang the poster of the late communist leader and a Vietnamese 
flag. Tran had said he put up the display to encourage his 
neighbors to see their homeland in a new light.

<HEADLINE> Holyfield Said To Have Been Sick </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ATLANTA (AP) -- Evander Holyfield's attorney says the heavyweight  
boxing champion had a stomach ache before his controversial 
unification fight with Lennox Lewis. 
</P>
<P>
	Attorney Jim Thomas said Tuesday that Holyfield was sweating  
during a routine stretching session two days before the fight and 
that the boxer told him his ``stomach doesn't feel right'' and his 
``legs were sticking'' in the locker room before Saturday night's 
bout in Madison Square Garden. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't want to sound like a guy who says, `Well, here's the  
excuse,''' Thomas said. ``There was something bothering him, and it 
probably affected his performance. I'm not saying he would've won. 
Who knows? But there was a problem. Everybody says, `Well, that 
could be old age.' The answer is, I don't know. I can't dismiss 
that possibility. But clearly Evander wasn't at his best, and I 
want to know why.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In a 12-round fight many thought Lewis clearly won, the judges  
called it a draw. 
</P>
<P>
	Thomas said he asked Holyfield why he didn't say something  
earlier, and Holyfield responded, ``I thought it would be a short 
fight, so it didn't matter.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Holyfield had predicted he would knock out Lewis in the third  
round. 
</P>
<P>
	Holyfield had a virus about three weeks before the fight, but  
said he had recovered. It's possible the virus returned, Thomas 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	The attorney said the fighter will submit a blood sample and  
have other tests, directed by his physician, Dr. Chris Vaughns. 
</P>
<P>
	Holyfield, who has returned to Atlanta, could not be reached for  
comment Tuesday night, The Atlanta Journal-Constitution said. 
</P>
<P>
	Thomas said Holyfield has watched a tape on the fight, but had  
no comment on the judges' decision. 
</P>
<P>
	``He really had no comment on the fight, other than to note that  
he was never hurt and never in trouble,'' Thomas said.

<HEADLINE> 'Truth in Rock Act' Hearings Open </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- It was as if the soundtrack to ``Happy Days''  
sprang to life Tuesday in the unlikely venue of a House committee 
room. 
</P>
<P>
	Mary Wilson struck the famous arm-jutting ``Stop! In the Name of  
Love'' pose. Two of the Drifters led an a capella ``Under the 
Boardwalk.'' Sha Na Na's Bowzer mugged for television cameras, 
without his trademark undershirt but with regulation greased-back 
hair. 
</P>
<P>
	Not your usual afternoon on Capitol Hill, but these were not the  
usual lobbyists gathered to press for change in federal trademark 
law. 
</P>
<P>
	Members of rhythm and blues, doo-wop and girl group acts from  
the 1950s and 1960s were there because they want greater authority 
to challenge competing acts performing under the names that topped 
the charts. 
</P>
<P>
	For instance, at least three different sets of Drifters perform  
in the United States without any of the voices responsible for 
``Under the Boardwalk,'' ``Up on the Roof'' and other hit records. 
</P>
<P>
	Rep. Dennis Kucinich, D-Ohio, sponsor of legislation he calls  
the ``Truth in Rock Act,'' said fans who go to see substitute 
groups get cheated, and orginal artists are deprived of the chance 
to work. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are all affected by bogus groups, because there is only a  
finite amount of work for people from our time period,'' said Peggy 
Davison, who sang the lead on the Angels hit, ``My Boyfriend's 
Back.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Just think of how you'd feel if all your life's  
accomplishments, all your history, was usurped without your 
permission,'' said Frank Maffei of Danny and the Juniors. 
</P>
<P>
	The revival-group packager who inspired the legislation, Larry  
Marshak of RCI Corp. in New York, said everything he does is legal 
and aboveboard, including his stable of multiple Platters, Drifters 
and Coasters. 
</P>
<P>
	``We make no illusions to be otherwise than what they are.  
Nobody expects to see the original members when they see us,'' he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Marshak said he started putting together revival shows in the  
1970s. He reunited some original band members, he said, or used 
originals as advisers to work with entirely new groups performing 
the old material. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's like we don't exist,'' said Sam Moore, half of Sam &AMP;  
Dave. 
</P>
<P>
	Moore spent years suing former partner Dave Prater after Prater  
hired a substitute and toured as the New Sam &AMP; Dave. At one point, 
Moore lost his home to legal fees, his wife Joyce said. 
</P>
<P>
	And Bowzer, who in real life is a serious, suit-wearing  
entrepreneur named Jon Bauman, told of watching substitute 
performers ``standing on stage saying `I recorded this song in 
1962,' when they had nothing to do with that song in 1962?'' 
</P>
<P>
	New York agent John Villano, who represents Herb Reed of the  
Platters, Carl Gardner of the Coasters and Charlie Thomas of the 
Drifters, said it's not just the golden oldies who would benefit if 
the trademark law is changed. 
</P>
<P>
	``Twenty years from now when the Spice Girls aren't spicy  
anymore there's going to be some unscrupulous idiot who puts five 
girls out there and your kids and grandkids are not going to know 
the difference,'' said Villano.

<HEADLINE> GOP Pushes Plan for Budget Surplus </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Republicans are muscling a pair of similar  
fiscal 2000 budgets through Senate and House budget committees that 
would set aside Social Security's huge surpluses while reducing 
taxes and increasing spending for schools and the Pentagon. 
</P>
<P>
	Senate Budget Committee Chairman Pete Domenici, R-N.M., planned  
votes on his $1.74 trillion proposal today, a day after releasing 
it. House Budget Committee Chairman John Kasich, R-Ohio, unveiled 
his own, similar plan today, and his committee planned to debate 
it. 
</P>
<P>
	Domenici's plan would set aside $133 billion over the next 10  
years for the program. But that money could instead be used for 
debt reduction or other purposes and was a fraction of the $350 
billion President Clinton wants to reserve for Medicare. 
</P>
<P>
	Kasich's budget projected having $97 billion left after all its  
tax cuts and spending changes, but it made no mention of how that 
money would be used. And in a controversial plan, it proposes 
letting the nation's governors use unspent welfare funds to boost 
education spending. 
</P>
<P>
	Democrats were already accusing Republicans of not doing enough  
to prepare Medicare for the retirement of the nation's 76 million 
baby boomers, beginning in a decade. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't see a guarantee of a single extra dollar for  
Medicare,'' said Sen. Frank Lautenberg of New Jersey, top Democrat 
on the Senate budget panel. He accused Republicans of instead 
pouring money into tax cuts, ``which I think will go 
disproportionately to the well-heeled.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Republicans said Clinton's budget was inadequate because it does  
nothing to fundamentally revamp either Social Security or Medicare 
for the coming demographic crunch. And they defended their plan to 
use expected surpluses to cut taxes. 
</P>
<P>
	``The working people of this country are entitled to be rewarded  
for their success in bringing prosperity to America,'' Domenici 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	The GOP budgets are aimed at letting Republicans pursue their  
priorities while arguing they are protecting Social Security and 
Medicare. Clinton and other Democrats have repeatedly accused 
Republicans of jeopardizing the two popular programs. 
</P>
<P>
	To make their argument, Republicans would use the $1.8 trillion  
in Social Security surpluses projected over the next decade to 
reduce the national debt. Reducing the debt would strengthen the 
economy, making it easier for the government to raise money to pay 
Social Security and Medicare's swelling ranks of beneficiaries. 
</P>
<P>
	But like Clinton, Republicans are not proposing to change either  
program's benefits or the taxes supporting it. Both parties fear 
voter backlash should they issue such proposals alone. 
</P>
<P>
	The GOP would allow tax cuts totaling up to $15 billion next  
year and $778 billion over the next 10 years. That would be far 
more than Clinton sought in the budget he proposed last month, 
underlining the fact that reducing taxes remains a defining 
Republican issue as the parties prepare for the 2000 elections. 
</P>
<P>
	In another contrast, the GOP would use most of the projected  
surpluses from the non-Social Security side of the budget -- $800 
billion over the next decade -- for tax cuts. Clinton would divide 
that money into three roughly equal parts: for Medicare, for 
defense and domestic programs and for helping Americans set up new 
personal retirement accounts. 
</P>
<P>
	The congressional budget is a blueprint that sets overall tax  
and spending targets but leaves decisions on specifics for later 
legislation. Taking advantage of that, Domenici's plan only hints 
at the answers to tough questions that will have to be answered by 
lawmakers later. 
</P>
<P>
	He does not say which taxes would be cut, but suggests several  
that are possible. These include phased-in income-tax rate 
reductions, education credits and an end to the so-called marriage 
penalty, under which some couples pay higher income taxes than they 
would if they were single. 
</P>
<P>
	Republicans also recommend hefty increases for schools, another  
area where polls show the public trusts Democrats more than 
Republicans. And like Clinton, they would increase the Pentagon's 
budget. 
</P>
<P>
	Despite those increases, the Republicans say they would honor  
spending limits imposed on defense and many domestic programs by 
the 1997 budget-balancing deal. But they do not fully identify all 
the savings needed to do so. 
</P>
<P>
	Domenici would pay for the $133 billion, 10-year fund that could  
finance Medicare partly by assuming that much of federal spending 
will only grow by about 1 percent annually for that period -- 
without detailing how. 
</P>
<P>
	Republicans envision their budget as a place-holder until this  
summer. That is when they say the humming economy will probably 
produce higher budget surplus projections, which they would devote 
to making next year's tax cuts bigger.

<HEADLINE> America West Airlines Faces Strike </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PHOENIX (AP) -- America West Airlines and its flight attendants  
resumed talks Wednesday in a last-ditch effort to avoid a strike or 
shutdown that could strand tens of thousands of travelers this 
weekend. 
</P>
<P>
	Negotiations met in so-called super-mediation with a member of  
the National Mediation Board for seven hours Wednesday and were to 
meet again Thursday, just a day before the end of a cooling-off 
period expires at 12:01 a.m. EST Saturday. Neither side would 
comment when the session ended Wednesday night. 
</P>
<P>
	The airline's 2,300 flight attendants say they will stage a  
series of random, unannounced work stoppages -- dubbed CHAOS for 
``Creating Havoc Around Our System'' -- after the deadline expires 
if there is no agreement. 
</P>
<P>
	``We hope all this mystery will make the company consider the  
impact going into the negotiations,'' said Jeff Zack, a spokesman 
for the Association of Flight Attendants. ``Until now all they've 
had to think about is unhappy flight attendants and that hasn't 
seemed to matter.'' 
</P>
<P>
	America West, the nation's ninth-largest carrier, with hubs in  
Phoenix, Las Vegas and Columbus, Ohio, has said it may shut down 
the airline rather than submit to the flight attendants' plan. 
</P>
<P>
	That could leave more than 100,000 passengers stranded over the  
weekend. 
</P>
<P>
	Michael Boyd, an airline analyst from Golden, Colo., said he  
doubts the airline will follow through with its grounding threat. 
</P>
<P>
	``Sure, CHAOS is very disruptive, but by shutting the whole  
airline, (the company) would anger not just some, but all 
passengers, and not just the flight attendants, but all employees. 
I don't think it's really an option,'' Boyd said. 
</P>
<P>
	What's more, he said, a shutdown would be a huge loss to  
shareholders of America West Holdings Corp., of which America West 
is the major component. 
</P>
<P>
	A shutdown by America West, which carries only about 3 percent  
of the nation's passenger traffic, would be unlikely to snarl air 
traffic as much as the sickout by pilots last month at AMR Corp.'s 
American Airlines. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, a shutdown or a strike by the Tempe, Ariz.-based carrier  
could wreak havoc on cities like neighboring Phoenix, where America 
West accounts for more than 40 percent of all traffic and Las 
Vegas, where the airline is second only to Dallas-based Southwest 
Airlines. 
</P>
<P>
	For Phoenix, the strike deadline falls on a weekend when college  
basketball fans are converging on the city for the NCAA basketball 
tournament, joining baseball fans already feasting on Major League 
spring training, sun-seeking golfers and students on spring break. 
</P>
<P>
	Las Vegas, too, could be hit hard as it prepares for the arrival  
of an estimated 110,000 people for a construction industry trade 
show that opens Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	America West serves 53 domestic destinations overall and eight  
cities in Mexico and Canada. 
</P>
<P>
	The labor dispute between America West and its flight attendants  
has been brewing for more than four years. 
</P>
<P>
	Its attendants have been working without a contract since voting  
to unionize in 1994, three years after America West filed for 
Bankruptcy Court protection from creditors and employees took pay 
cuts. 
</P>
<P>
	``The (union) members want the company to put dollars on the  
table that show a commitment to the future and sacrifices of the 
past,'' said union President Bill McGlashen. 
</P>
<P>
	About two-thirds of America West's flight attendants earn the  
top-scale salary of $23,800. Top-scale flight attendants at rival 
Southwest Airlines earn $41,200. 
</P>
<P>
	The flight attendants also want the same daily expenses pilots  
receive, $1.80 an hour away from their base city. Currently, the 
attendants get no per diem. 
</P>
<P>
	In a letter to flight attendants in February, America West  
Chairman William Franke said the company could not meet union 
demands without compromising its competitive position. 
</P>
<P>
	But with the company posting record profits of $108.6 million  
last year -- up 45 percent from the previous record of $75 million 
in 1997 -- the union is adamant that the company can improve its 
offer, and as a result, make up for lost time and pay. 
</P>
<P>
	Stephen Cabot, a management labor relations attorney who has  
represented airlines in past disputes, said airlines like America 
West have not done an effective job conveying to employees that 
profits may appear greater than they are, after calculating for 
debts and past losses. 
</P>
<P>
	Further, airlines don't know when the gravy train will end, he  
said. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's too little and too late when one tries to educate  
(employees) during negotiations. When emotions get to this peak, 
people don't hear. That leads to greater emotions until there is an 
outlet,'' Cabot said.

<HEADLINE> House Passes Steel Quota Bill </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Supporters of limits on foreign steel are  
counting on using a strong House showing to persuade senators to 
take stronger action to combat low-priced imports. 
</P>
<P>
	The 289-141 House vote Wednesday -- one short of the total needed  
to override a veto if all 435 members vote -- showed lawmakers' 
desire to help an industry struggling against a recent surge of 
imports from Japan, Russia and other countries. 
</P>
<P>
	Sen. Jay Rockefeller, D-W.Va., vice chairman of the Senate Steel  
Caucus, said supporters ``have a great opportunity to build on the 
momentum of the House passage,'' although he conceded they face a 
tough battle in the Senate. 
</P>
<P>
	The bill also faces a presidential veto threat. White House  
chief of staff John Podesta called the measure ``not in our 
nation's economic interest.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Republicans from steel-producing areas joined minority House  
Democrats in passing the bill despite the rare union of Republican 
leaders and the White House in opposition. 
</P>
<P>
	George Becker, president of the United Steelworkers of America,  
said he considered it a victory to come this far and dismissed talk 
of the hurdles in the Senate and with President Clinton. 
</P>
<P>
	``When we started in the struggle, they said we never had a  
snowballs-in-hell chance that this would even pass the House,'' 
Becker said. ``We're winning the battle. We've elevated the 
discussion on trade to a much higher level in the United States.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The domestic industry has been critical of the administration's  
response to the recent surge of steel imports, which reached record 
highs in 1998. 
</P>
<P>
	The Asian economic crisis reduced demand for steel abroad and  
forced foreign producers to turn to the United States to unload 
their goods, resulting in thousands of U.S. layoffs and three 
bankruptcies, the U.S. industry contends. 
</P>
<P>
	``The lack of effective response from the Clinton-Gore  
administration has forced Congress today to take action,'' said 
Rep. Phil English, a Pennsylvania Republican who comes from a 
region with several steel mills. 
</P>
<P>
	Voting for the bill were 91 Republicans, 197 Democrats and one  
independent. Thirteen Democrats joined 128 Republicans in rejecting 
the bill. Four members did not vote; there is one vacancy now. 
</P>
<P>
	Prospects are dimmer in the Senate, which has not decided on a  
specific remedy and cannot match the industry's strength in the 
House. Sen. Arlen Specter, R-Pa., chairman of the Senate Steel 
Caucus, said he would meet next week to devise a strategy. 
</P>
<P>
	The House-passed measure would limit steel imports to the  
average levels in the three years before July 1997. Imports already 
are declining, but the industry fears that only is temporary. The 
measure also would set up an import notification system to better 
track shipments into the country.

<HEADLINE> GOP Pushes To Scrap Income Tax Code </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- A year after falling short in their effort to  
scrap the income tax code and replace it with something simpler, 
Republicans are trying again. 
</P>
<P>
	The legislative effort announced Tuesday is aimed as much at the  
2000 elections as at this congressional session. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are ultimately going to win this,'' said Sen. Sam  
Brownback, R-Kan. ``We are the party of tax reform. I want to make 
this part of the presidential debate.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Rep. Steve Largent, R-Okla., and Sen. Tim Hutchinson, R-Ark.,  
are the main sponsors of bills to ``sunset'' the 5.5 million-word 
tax code by Dec. 31, 2003, and give Congress time to devise a 
replacement. 
</P>
<P>
	``All of us work better with deadlines,'' Hutchinson told  
reporters. 
</P>
<P>
	The House passed similar legislation last year, but it went  
nowhere in the Senate. President Clinton called that plan 
irresponsible and promised a veto. Many on Wall Street feared 
possible damaging economic repercussions. 
</P>
<P>
	Despite long odds again this year, sponsors chose to begin their  
new tax-reform campaign 30 days before the April 15 tax-filing 
deadline. The National Federation of Independent Business, which 
represents 600,000 small businesses, is launching a media campaign 
in the next month to highlight inequities in the current tax code. 
</P>
<P>
	``The next 30 days, the American people will appreciate this  
more than any other time of the year,'' Hutchinson said. 
</P>
<P>
	Several GOP leaders have introduced legislation that could  
replace the tax code, including House Majority Leader Dick Armey, 
R-Texas, who is sponsoring a bill that would tax all income at a 
flat 17 percent rate. A flat tax also is championed by Republican 
presidential hopeful Steve Forbes. 
</P>
<P>
	Business federation president Jack Faris said his group favors a  
national referendum in which voters would be asked to decide among 
the current code, a new kind of income tax or a national sales tax. 
Congress would then vote on the choice without amendments. 
</P>
<P>
	``Surely we can produce a better evil than the one we have  
now,'' Faris said.

<HEADLINE> Gator Hoops Challenges Football </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	GAINESVILLE, Fla. (AP) -- Florida fans have had this week circled  
on their calendar for months. After all, it's the start of spring 
football practice. 
</P>
<P>
	But even that is taking a back seat to basketball in Gainesville  
these days. 
</P>
<P>
	Billy Donovan's team is preparing for the regional semifinals  
against Gonzaga at a time when it is usually holding its 
end-of-season banquet. 
</P>
<P>
	And suddenly, Florida seems like a real ``basketball school,''  
something that never really seemed possible in the checkered 
84-year history of the program. 
</P>
<P>
	``I have enjoyed the journey, it's been fun,'' Donovan said  
Tuesday from Phoenix. ``But I don't want to embrace anything. If 
you sit back too much and say, `Wow, we made it to the Sweet 16,' 
that can burn you. I believe the time to reflect is when it's 
done.'' 
</P>
<P>
	When it is, it will be time to look back on one of the best --  
and maybe most unexpected -- basketball seasons in Florida history. 
</P>
<P>
	Some critics have dismissed Florida as nothing more than a  
decent team, fortunate enough to be in the right place at the right 
time. 
</P>
<P>
	Due to a series of upsets in the West region, the sixth-seeded  
Gators have beaten No. 11 seed Penn and No. 14 seed Weber State and 
next face No. 10 seed Gonzaga for a spot in the Elite Eight. 
</P>
<P>
	But doubters are nothing new to this program.  
</P>
<P>
	Florida wasn't expected to make the tournament at all this year.  
Coming off consecutive losing seasons, the Gators were chosen to 
finish fifth in the SEC East and possibly make a run at the NIT. 
</P>
<P>
	Somehow, Donovan squeezed more out of last year's highly  
regarded recruiting class than even he expected. The results were 
on display last week. 
</P>
<P>
	Freshman Teddy Dupay hit two big shots late in the 82-74  
overtime victory over Weber State. First-year classmates Mike 
Miller, Udonis Haslem and LaDarius Halton are all playing key roles 
in this unexpected run. 
</P>
<P>
	``You know when you're relying on freshmen, you're going to have  
your ups and downs,'' Donovan said. ``You hope guys like (seniors) 
Greg Stolt and Eddie Shannon are going to carry you, and whatever 
bonus you get from the freshmen is real helpful.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Stolt, a sweet-shooting forward, and Shannon, the point guard  
with only one eye, figured to finish their careers without a whiff 
of the NCAA. Instead, they were beneficiaries of an influx of 
talent at just the right time. 
</P>
<P>
	``In the past, we didn't have the talent to be in the Sweet  
16,'' Shannon said. ``Now that we got the talent, we've had to use 
that talent and gel it with a good work ethic.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The appearance in the round of 16 matches Florida's progress in  
its first NCAA appearance in 1987, when Vernon Maxwell and Dwayne 
Schintzius led the downtrodden program to national prominence for 
the first time. 
</P>
<P>
	Drug charges and NCAA violations under then-coach Norm Sloan  
left a black mark on that team. Since then, that era of Florida 
basketball has largely been swept under the rug. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1994, the Gators made the Final Four, only to see a quick  
decline and the eventual departure of coach Lon Kruger. 
</P>
<P>
	Donovan stepped in, bringing his tournament experience as a  
player and coach, along with the idea that Florida didn't have to 
settle for simply being a football school anymore. 
</P>
<P>
	In three seasons, the Gators have shed their label as a  
perennial doormat. The next test will be to see if they can make 
the success last. 
</P>
<P>
	But that's for later. This season's adventure is still in full  
swing. 
</P>
<P>
	``We didn't come to lose at the Sweet 16,'' Shannon said. ``We  
came to battle. If we give 150 percent, we'll accept that. But 
we're not going in there happy just to be there.''

<HEADLINE> Winds Fan Nebaska Grass Fire </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	VALENTINE, Neb. (AP) -- Gusty wind today fanned a prairie fire  
that already had charred a 40-mile-long swath of north-central 
Nebraska prairie, and a small town was evacuated. One person died 
fighting the flames. 
</P>
<P>
	Emergency managers declared the blaze mostly under control this  
morning but wind gusts up to 45 mph were forecast during the day. 
</P>
<P>
	Gov. Mike Johanns declared an emergency to make state resources  
available to help fight the fire. National Guard members were 
alerted. 
</P>
<P>
	The cause of the fire, believed to have started Tuesday, was not  
yet known. 
</P>
<P>
	The path of the fire was up to 10 miles wide in places. One  
rural house had been destroyed and Peterson said some cattle were 
killed in the sparsely settled region. 
</P>
<P>
	A highway, U.S. 83, was reopened today but the town of Thedford,  
population about 315, was still evacuated, said Deb Bertrand, a 
state public information officer. 
</P>
<P>
	``It is a miracle the fire never got into the town of  
Thedford,'' she said. The fire burned up to the edge of the town, 
about 300 miles west of Omaha, more than once, she said. 
</P>
<P>
	Four planes dropping fire retardant helped bring the blaze under  
control today but there were still hot spots, Bertrand said. 
</P>
<P>
	Bertrand estimated about 200 people from some 25 regional  
volunteer fire companies already were on the scene, not including 
local volunteers.

<HEADLINE> Sampras Hopes To Rebound at Lipton </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	KEY BISCAYNE, Fla. (AP) -- Pete Sampras wanted rest, and he's had  
a lot of it lately. 
</P>
<P>
	Sampras skipped the Australian Open in January, saying he needed  
a break. He rejoined the tour last month but has played only six 
matches, failing to reach the final in three consecutive 
tournaments. 
</P>
<P>
	He withdrew at San Jose because of a strained ankle tendon. He  
lost at Scottsdale to Jan-Michael Gambill, lost at Indian Wells to 
Felix Mantilla, then lost the No. 1 ranking to Carlos Moya. 
</P>
<P>
	Now the problem is rust, not rest.  
</P>
<P>
	Sampras will try to get back on track at the Lipton  
Championships, which begin Thursday. He has an opening-round bye 
and likely will play Jim Courier in the second round. 
</P>
<P>
	The women's draw offers the tantalizing prospect of a final  
between sisters Serena and Venus Williams. Serena has won her past 
two tournaments to reach a career-best No. 16 in the rankings. 
Venus, Lipton's defending champion, is ranked sixth. 
</P>
<P>
	Also in the field are four-time champion Steffi Graf, top-ranked  
Martina Hingis and Wimbledon champ Jana Novotna. The top 20 women 
are entered, and the only top-20 player absent from the men's draw 
is Todd Martin, sidelined with an abdominal strain. 
</P>
<P>
	Among those entered -- as of now -- is Boris Becker, who hasn't  
played a singles match in the United States since 1996. Tournament 
officials aren't counting on Becker, however, because he has pulled 
out of Lipton six times. 
</P>
<P>
	Sampras, a two-time Lipton champion, brings a modest 4-2 record  
and a two-match losing streak to Key Biscayne. He's seeded No. 2 
behind Moya. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's just a matter of getting the confidence back in my  
game,'' Sampras said. ``Not having played many matches this year, 
you can't try to find your form. It's going to take some time, but 
I'm a pretty impatient guy. I want to win everything I play.'' 
</P>
<P>
	There are those who question Sampras' motivation at 27, an age  
when some players -- Courier and Michael Chang, for example -- are in 
decline. 
</P>
<P>
	He spent much of last year complaining about the grind of the  
ATP Tour and refused to play Davis Cup. His decision to skip the 
Australian Open was surprising given the emphasis he places on 
Grand Slams. 
</P>
<P>
	Sampras won his 11th major title last year at Wimbledon, leaving  
him only one behind Roy Emerson's record of 12. But it's been more 
than two years since he won a Grand Slam on a surface other than 
grass. 
</P>
<P>
	``It gets harder as you get older,'' Andre Agassi told Tennis  
magazine. ``And I have this feeling that Pete is close to the point 
where he's just going to say, `Enough of all this.' But he's 
capable of winning two more Grand Slams.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Sampras claims he's not close to quitting. He said the break at  
the beginning of the year left him rejuvenated and ready to 
reassert himself as the world's best player. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm not going to be done with this game anytime soon,'' he  
said. ``I still enjoy playing. Traveling for 10 years, 30 weeks a 
year, gets a little tiring, but I still love competing. ... 
</P>
<P>
	``These next four or five years, I'm going to give myself an  
offseason -- two or three months just to chill out, like the guys do 
in other sports. That will hopefully help me to have a long 
career.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Sampras has a chance to regain No. 1 at Lipton. Others who could  
emerge from the tournament with the top ranking are No. 3 Yevgeny 
Kafelnikov, No. 4 Alex Corretja and No. 5 Patrick Rafter. 
</P>
<P>
	Sampras has always downplayed the race for No. 1 early in the  
year. 
</P>
<P>
	``If it was a priority, I would have gone down to Australia,''  
he said. ``It doesn't matter what you're ranked in February or 
March. It comes down to December. It's always been an 
end-of-the-year goal for me.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Sampras has finished the past six years ranked No. 1, a record.  
He has spent 262 weeks atop the rankings, just eight weeks shy of 
Ivan Lendl's record. Sampras expects to be No. 1 again -- perhaps 
after Lipton. 
</P>
<P>
	``When I'm eager and fresh,'' he said, ``I'm tough to beat.''

<HEADLINE> Survey: Asian Cities Most Costly </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	GENEVA (AP) -- Tokyo and four other cities in Japan and China  
have the world's highest cost-of-living for foreigners despite 
Asian financial turmoil, according to an annual survey released 
Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Besides Moscow in sixth place and London in 8th, all the top 10  
cities were in Asia. The least expensive cities were Madras, India, 
in 148th place; Volgograd, Russia, 149, Blantyre, Malawi, 150; and 
Harare, Zimbabwe, 151. 
</P>
<P>
	The cost-of-living report, which is intended for use by  
governments and corporations, was based on a survey conducted last 
autumn, said the Corporate Resources Group, a division of the 
consultant William M. Mercer Companies. 
</P>
<P>
	Seoul led the Asian cities that have been recovering from  
economic problems in recent years. The South Korean capital climbed 
from 48th place a year ago to 10th. Jakarta, Bangkok, Kuala Lumpur 
and Manila also showed signs of recovery, the survey showed. 
</P>
<P>
	The firm checked the prices of housing, food, clothes,  
utilities, transportation and entertainment. Some 15 cities ranked 
higher than New York City, which was taken as the base with an 
index of 100. 
</P>
<P>
	New York climbed from 21st place last year because of moderate  
inflation, a slight increase in real estate prices and the strength 
of the dollar. Chicago was in 53rd place, Miami 54th, San Francisco 
58th, Los Angeles 60th and Honolulu 55th. Houston was 62nd, 
Washington, D.C., 72nd and Boston 74th. 
</P>
<P>
	The company said the gap between the most and least expensive  
cities had widened to 143.8 points, compared with 114 points last 
spring. 
</P>
<P>
	Most major European cities ranked below New York, thanks to the  
strong value of the U.S. dollar, the company said.

<HEADLINE> Legacy of First Ladies Celebrated </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Hillary Rodham Clinton saluted the women who  
preceded her in the White House and accepted an award for her own 
contributions in shaping the role of the first lady. 
</P>
<P>
	Receiving a crystal statue etched with her image from the  
National First Ladies' Library, Mrs. Clinton noted Tuesday night 
that history has sometimes forgotten the causes championed by the 
first ladies before her. 
</P>
<P>
	``Before the explosion of information, we were pretty much  
dependent on what people wrote about themselves or what other 
people wrote about them,'' she said at an awards dinner. 
</P>
<P>
	In the case of the first ladies, Mrs. Clinton said, ``Their  
contributions have often been overlooked.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Clinton described the many ways in which first ladies have  
left their own mark on history, from Eleanor Roosevelt's efforts on 
behalf of civil rights to Betty Ford's work to raise awareness of 
to breast cancer and drug addiction. 
</P>
<P>
	``Many of them have used the platform that history gave them to  
great advantage,'' Mrs. Clinton said. 
</P>
<P>
	She watched as actresses Mary Steenburgen and Jane Alexander  
performed a reading written by first lady historian Carl Sferrazza 
Anthony that captured some words of past first ladies in their 
letters, diaries and interviews. 
</P>
<P>
	Afterward, Mrs. Clinton acknowledged that becoming a first lady  
comes with its own share of pressures and tensions. But these will 
``create not only some issues and problems that one has to address, 
but also some opportunities.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Secretary of State Madeleine Albright, who presented Mrs.  
Clinton with the award, slyly suggested that this first lady might 
capitalize on more opportunities to come. 
</P>
<P>
	``Speaking of your leadership, I join with others in hoping that  
we ain't seen nothing yet,'' Albright said. Mrs. Clinton is 
pondering a run for the New York Senate. 
</P>
<P>
	Albright herself was saluted at the event, as the first female  
secretary of state and for her accomplishments in that post. She 
emphasized womens' commitment to improving their position. 
</P>
<P>
	``We dedicate ourselves to a future of many, many first women  
and even more importantly to a future where no woman is left 
behind,'' Albright said. 
</P>
<P>
	Other honorees included Supreme Court Justice Sandra Day  
O'Connor; Pulitzer Prize winning poet, Gwendolyn Brooks; the first 
African-American woman elected to the U.S. House of 
Representatives, Shirley Chisholm; and Elizabeth Campbell, the 
founder of Washington's WETA Public Television.

<HEADLINE> 22 Arrested at Jerry Brown's Office </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	OAKLAND, Calif. (AP) -- Twenty-two people protesting military  
exercises in the city were arrested when they stormed Mayor Jerry 
Brown's office and allegedly disconnected phones and computers. 
</P>
<P>
	Two of the demonstrators were charged with felony robbery and  
the rest will face misdemeanor charges, said Van Jones, an attorney 
representing them. 
</P>
<P>
	Brown would have been willing to meet with the demonstrators if  
they had behaved reasonably, said Gilda Gonzales, the mayor's chief 
of staff. 
</P>
<P>
	``These people who were in the mayor's office were not  
peaceful,'' said Gonzales. 
</P>
<P>
	Jones said the protesters were sprayed with Mace and three were  
injured. 
</P>
<P>
	The City Council split 4-4 last week in a vote expressing  
concern that it wasn't consulted when Brown welcomed the war games. 
</P>
<P>
	Some 800 troops are involved in the $4.5 million Urban Warrior  
Advanced Warfighting Experiment in Oakland, part of a national 
program that included Marine landings in Monterey Bay.

<HEADLINE> MLS Ready for Another `Must' Season </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Major League Soccer starts its fourth season  
Saturday, facing two straight years of declining attendance but 
with far fewer concerns than any time since it began. 
</P>
<P>
	``The question doesn't seem to be anymore if we're going to  
survive, but how we're going to make the next step to being one of 
the top sports,'' Columbus Crew forward Brian McBride said. 
</P>
<P>
	The 12-team league opens after considerable movement of big-name  
players, a shakeup at MLS headquarters, the absence of coach Bruce 
Arena and a pending lawsuit attacking the structure of the league. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've said every year that each season is the most important,''  
MLS commissioner Doug Logan said. ``You have to take that with a 
grain of salt.'' 
</P>
<P>
	There are five games on opening day, highlighted by defending  
champion Chicago Fire at San Jose, and a new look to rosters 
following major trades involving Raul Diaz Arce, Alexi Lalas, Tony 
Meola and John Harkes. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm OK, but the ones who are really hurt are the fans, who are  
loyal to teams and players and then get treated like this,'' Meola 
said. ``But it's a reality in this league.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Most rosters are all but set, with only a few foreign  
allocations still pending. D.C. United, Chicago and Los Angeles are 
still the powers, but Columbus is a contender for MLS Cup '99 on 
Nov. 21 in Foxboro, Mass. 
</P>
<P>
	The Crew, run by Lamar Hunt, inaugurate their stadium May 15  
against New England. The 22,500-seat park is the first stadium in 
the United States built specifically for soccer. Season-ticket 
sales are up 45 percent in Columbus. 
</P>
<P>
	D.C. lost the MLS title game to Chicago in October but still won  
the bigger prize -- the InterAmerican Cup against Brazil's Vasco da 
Gama. 
</P>
<P>
	``D.C. is still the team to beat in the East, until somebody  
knocks them off,'' McBride said. 
</P>
<P>
	Washington went through the most dramatic changes. While Chicago  
and Los Angeles return virtually intact, United had to send 
defender Tony Sanneh (to Germany) and midfielder John Harkes (to 
New England) to get under the approximate $1.7 million salary cap. 
</P>
<P>
	Washington also lost Arena to the U.S. national team. Arena won  
the first two MLS titles and the InterAmerican crown. He is 
succeeded by Thomas Rongen. 
</P>
<P>
	The average crowd at MLS games last year, including two  
expansion franchises, dropped to 14,312 from 14,616, but overall 
attendance increased by more than 400,000. 
</P>
<P>
	Season-ticket sales are up just 2 percent from a year ago, but a  
shift in the schedule to have 58 percent of the league's 192 games 
on Saturday is expected to boost the gate. 
</P>
<P>
	The season begins with a big change at league headquarters.  
Sunil Gulati was stripped of his post as deputy commissioner last 
month, supposedly over renewing the contract of midfielder Tab 
Ramos without consulting the MetroStars. 
</P>
<P>
	Many are skittish about how the league will function without the  
one man primarily responsible for all player-contract negotiations. 
</P>
<P>
	Another issue is an antitrust lawsuit filed by the players'  
association. The case concerns the foundation of the league's 
business structure as a single entity. 
</P>
<P>
	The suit was filed before the start of the 1997 season and is  
not expected to go to trial until after the season. Even if a 
verdict comes before then, the league doesn't expect all appeals to 
be settled until late 2001. 
</P>
<P>
	In the front office, Los Angeles Kings owner Philip Anschutz  
bought into his third MLS club, the Los Angeles Galaxy, and 
installed Kings president Tim Leiweke as head of the soccer team. 
</P>
<P>
	Jonathan Kraft bought the rights to the San Jose Clash, his  
second club. He ousted president and general manager Peter 
Bridgwater and replaced him with 30-year-old Lynn Meterparel. 
Meterparel was an executive with Kraft's other club, the 
Revolution, and helped make New England one of the league's top 
draws. 
</P>
<P>
	A decision on expansion is expected by the end of August. The  
league would like to put teams next year in Houston and 
Philadelphia. Rochester, N.Y., and Cleveland also have outside 
shots. 
</P>
<P>
	Additionally, some teams are building or are thinking of  
building their own stadiums in an effort to avoid stadium clashes 
with more established tenants, usually NFL clubs.

	Amtrak Crash Is Investigated  
</P>
<P>
	BOURBONNAIS, Ill. (AP) -- Federal investigators are still looking  
for clues in Monday night's collision between a semi-trailer truck 
and an Amtrak train that killed at least 11 people. More than 100 
people were injured. Authorities say they are looking into whether 
the driver of the truck drove around a rural crossing barrier in an 
attempt to beat the train. The two-locomotive train pulling 14 cars 
on the way from Chicago to New Orleans slammed into the truck and 
then into two rail cars, which jackknifed and piled up behind the 
locomotives over a quarter-mile, with leaking diesel fuel erupting 
in flames.

them all to cross ``the last divide of the peace process'' by 
finally forming their Protestant-Catholic government. Clinton met

parade's grand marshal and star of such movies as ``The Quiet 
Man,'' celebrated the Irish connection ``that I feel so strongly in

<HEADLINE>  Serbs Raise New Peace Objections </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PARIS (AP) -- With earlier progress in Kosovo talks threatening  
to unravel, Western mediators tried to convince the Serbs today 
that major changes they are demanding in the proposed peace deal 
are unacceptable. 
</P>
<P>
	The new sticking point for the Serbs has been the political part  
of the peace accord, which during the first round of talks last 
month the Serbs said the were ready to sign. 
</P>
<P>
	Chief negotiator Christopher Hill told a news conference that  
based on the last few days ``we would not anticipate any further 
progress'' and a signing signature with the ethnic Albanians would 
take place ``very shortly.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Apparently at odds with his fellow mediators, Russian negotiator  
Boris Mayorsky said ``as long as there is time, there is hope'' and 
that unless both sides signed there would be no agreement. 
</P>
<P>
	Hill also criticized the Serb military buildup in and around  
Kosovo, saying it violated both an October agreement on the Serb 
military presence in the area as well as the spirit of the talks. 
</P>
<P>
	Talks are expected to continue Thursday, but the negotiators  
declined to say when the expected signing signature would take 
place. 
</P>
<P>
	``We aren't even discussing the text'' of the accord, chief  
talks spokesman Phil Reeker told The Associated Press. 
</P>
<P>
	The Serbs ``are demanding substantive changes, which we cannot  
accept,'' Reeker said. 
</P>
<P>
	The ethnic Albanians, who agreed Monday to sign the plan,  
claimed the Serbs were trying to change 70 percent of the proposed 
political agreement -- revisions that would put ethnic Albanians 
even further from the autonomy they want. 
</P>
<P>
	Fighting in Kosovo, a province in Yugoslavia's republic of  
Serbia, has killed more than 2,000 people and displaced 300,000 
over the past year. 
</P>
<P>
	The proposed agreement would give the ethnic Albanian majority  
in Kosovo wide political autonomy, while keeping the province 
within Serbia's borders. 
</P>
<P>
	Last month in Rambouillet, France, during the first round of  
talks, Serbs said they would sign the political part of the plan 
but not the military part that calls for NATO-led troops to enforce 
the peace deal. 
</P>
<P>
	Western nations sponsoring the talks have said the military and  
political components are inseparable, and have warned of an armed 
intervention if Serbs continue to reject the U.S.-sponsored plan. 
</P>
<P>
	A British diplomat at the talks said today that mediators are  
already making contingency plans for failure of this round. The 
plans would involve a European foreign ministry mission to 
Belgrade, Yugoslavia, to try to sway hard-line Yugoslav President 
Slobodan Milosevic. 
</P>
<P>
	If that fails, top NATO officials might make the trip, the  
diplomat said on condition of anonymity. They would then deliver a 
clear deadline to Milosevic to agree or face airstrikes. 
</P>
<P>
	State Department spokesman James P. Rubin arrived in Paris today  
and was briefed by Hill. On Tuesday, Rubin accused Serb negotiators 
of backtracking on key elements of the draft agreement. 
</P>
<P>
	His comments came amid an ominous new buildup of forces in and  
around Kosovo. Pentagon spokesman Kenneth Bacon said 16,000 to 
21,000 Yugoslav army troops are now on the perimeter of the 
province, up from 4,500 in late February. An additional 14,000 to 
18,000 Yugoslav army forces are deployed inside Kosovo, Bacon said. 
</P>
<P>
	Adding urgency to the talks in Paris, a forensic team  
investigating the deaths of dozens of ethnic Albanians that 
prompted world outrage in January concluded the victims were 
unarmed civilians, contrary to Serb claims. 
</P>
<P>
	But the long-awaited report by the Finnish team, sponsored by  
the European Union, stopped short of calling the killings in the 
Kosovo village of Racak a massacre.

<HEADLINE> Delay Denied in NCAA Scores Case </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PHILADELPHIA (AP) -- A federal judge today denied the NCAA's  
request to delay enforcement of a court order that stops the use of 
minimum standardized test scores as an eligibility requirement for 
freshmen athletes. 
</P>
<P>
	U.S. District Judge Ronald Buckwalter, who issued the initial  
ruling last week that struck down Proposition 16, denied the NCAA's 
request for a stay. The NCAA had said it needed more time to form 
new guidelines and to work on appeals. 
</P>
<P>
	Immediate enforcement of Buckwalter's initial ruling could cause  
chaos among the 302 Division I schools who would suddenly be 
without a critical recruiting guideline, NCAA counsel David Bruton 
said in court. The NCAA also said the ruling could affect teams 
participating in the men's and women's basketball tournaments now 
going on. 
</P>
<P>
	``Because the number of spots available for recruiting and  
athletic scholarships are limited, the rules of the game are 
knocked out,'' Bruton said in court Monday about the end of the 
minimum test score requirements for freshmen. 
</P>
<P>
	Attorneys for the four black athletes who filed the suit said  
the NCAA should adopt a nondiscriminatory eligibility policy rather 
than fight to delay or overturn the court's decision. The NCAA has 
said it would appeal regardless of how Buckwalter ruled on the 
stay. 
</P>
<P>
	The four plaintiffs in the case, all of whom have since  
graduated or are no longer freshmen in college, maintained they 
were denied NCAA scholarships or sports eligibility because they 
did not meet the minimum test score. 
</P>
<P>
	Under Proposition 16, the association required freshmen athletes  
to have a high-school diploma and a minimum grade-point average in 
13 core academic courses with the GPA contingent on an indexed, 
sliding scale with a student's score on either the Scholastic 
Assessment Test or American College Test. 
</P>
<P>
	However, students scoring lower than 820 on the SAT, or 16 on  
the ACT, could not participate, regardless of their other academic 
credentials. 
</P>
<P>
	Buckwalter's ruling on Proposition 16 did not limit the use of  
standardized tests, which many educators have long said are 
racially and culturally discriminatory. Its forerunner, Proposition 
48, resulted from a tumultuous NCAA convention in 1983 when a group 
of reform-minded school presidents began pushing for toughened 
academic requirements. 
</P>
<P>
	The NCAA has said the earliest it could establish new guidelines  
is October, since it first has to consult its member schools before

<HEADLINE> Goldman Sachs Will Conduct IPO </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Goldman Sachs &AMP; Co., the last major, private  
investment bank on Wall Street, outlined plans to sell 13 percent 
of its shares to the public for as much as $3 billion to bankroll 
an expansion in an increasingly competitive industry. 
</P>
<P>
	Goldman Sachs will sell 60 million shares for between $40 and  
$50 apiece in an initial public stock offering expected in May, 
according to documents filed Tuesday with securities regulators. 
</P>
<P>
	Goldman's initial public offering stock could be the  
second-largest in history, falling just below the $4.4 billion 
Conoco Inc. sale last October, and just above the $2.9 billion 
raised by Infinity Broadcasting Corp. in December. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is going to be a very sought-after deal,'' said Linda R.  
Killian, a portfolio manager for the Renaissance IPO Plus 
Aftermarket mutual fund. 
</P>
<P>
	Goldman's partners voted earlier this month to turn the New  
York-based firm into a public company. Goldman originally planned 
to go public last year, but abandoned its plans in September after 
a market rout. 
</P>
<P>
	Both the stock market, and Goldman's balance sheet have since  
recovered. On Tuesday, the Dow Jones industrial average briefly 
traded above 10,000 for the first time ever, then retreated to 
close at 9930.47. 
</P>
<P>
	But the stock market's height could concern some potential  
investors. 
</P>
<P>
	``As an investor, I would certainly be concerned about the  
overall market at this point,'' Killian said. 
</P>
<P>
	Nevertheless, Goldman's numbers look strong.  
</P>
<P>
	Goldman Sachs on Tuesday said its profits increased 16 percent  
to $1.19 billion in its first fiscal quarter ended Feb. 26. Revenue 
jumped 21 percent to $3 billion. 
</P>
<P>
	``The firm's trading business achieved a strong performance,  
recovering significantly in the first quarter 1999 from the 
difficult conditions experienced in the second half of 1998,'' 
David A. Viniar, Goldman's chief financial officer, said in a 
statement. 
</P>
<P>
	Goldman Sachs expects to post a ``substantial'' pretax loss in  
the second quarter to cover the costs associated with its public 
offering. 
</P>
<P>
	At the price range proposed for the stock sale, Goldman Sachs  
would have a market value of between $18.7 billion and $23.4 
billion. In addition, underwriters would be allowed to sell an 
additional 9 million shares, depending on demand, which could the 
value of the deal. 
</P>
<P>
	In exchange for the capital Goldman needs to raise to grow and  
acquire other businesses, the elite and secretive firm will have to 
give up the control it has cultivated over 130 years. 
</P>
<P>
	Goldman's current partners would own 47 percent of the firm, the  
remaining employees would own 10 percent, with retired partners 
also owning 10 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Goldman's retired partners will also receive a combined $892  
million in cash and $295 million in bonds, according to the filing. 
</P>
<P>
	Japan's Sumitomo Bank Capital Markets Inc. and Kamehamea  
Activites Association, a giant landowner and education fund in 
Hawaii, plan to sell a total of 18 million shares to the public. 
</P>
<P>
	After the public offering, Sumitomo will own 22.6 million  
shares, just under 5 percent of the company. Kamehamea will hold 
21.9 million shares, also just below 5 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Goldman plans to make a $200 million charitable contribution  
following the IPO, but it was not immediately clear what form it 
would take.

<HEADLINE> Senate OKs Nursing Home Bill </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- A bill to bar nursing homes from evicting  
residents who rely on Medicaid to pay their bills is awaiting 
signature into law by President Clinton. 
</P>
<P>
	The bill, given final congressional approval Monday by voice  
vote in the Senate, says nursing homes that decide to withdraw from 
the Medicaid program may not expel or transfer current residents 
who pay through the government health insurance program for the 
poor. The bill was approved by the House last week in a 398-12 
vote. 
</P>
<P>
	The White House said in a statement that it supports the  
legislation because ``America's nursing home residents must not 
live in fear that they will be evicted solely because they rely on 
Medicaid to pay for their care.'' It also has strong backing from 
senior citizen groups. 
</P>
<P>
	Florida legislators pushed for the measure after a nursing home  
operator, saying it was doing renovations, sought to remove more 
than 50 Medicaid patients from a home in Tampa, Fla. The company, 
Louisville, Ken., -based Vencor, later reversed that decision under 
public pressure. 
</P>
<P>
	The Health Care Financing Administration, which oversees  
Medicaid, estimates that 58 nursing homes a year are withdrawing 
from Medicaid, which generally pays less than people who pay with 
their own money. 
</P>
<P>
	Under the measure, nursing homes could still choose to leave the  
Medicaid program, but they could not oust current residents and 
they would be required to tell incoming residents that Medicaid 
payments were no longer acceptable and they might be asked to leave 
if they later came to depend on Medicaid. 
</P>
<P>
	Two-thirds of elderly nursing home patients rely on Medicaid to  
pay for their care. With nursing home costs averaging $40,000 a 
year, about half of residents who begin by paying with their own 
money and health insurance must turn to Medicaid within three to 
five years.

<HEADLINE> Senate Passes Missile-Defense Bill </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Senate voted overwhelmingly today to  
approve a bill calling for a nationwide defense against limited 
ballistic missile attack after President Clinton and most Senate 
Democrats dropped their long-standing opposition to the 
legislation. 
</P>
<P>
	On a 97 to 3 vote, the Senate adopted the bill committing the  
military to deploy a national missile as soon as ``technologically 
possible.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The House takes up a similar version Thursday.  
</P>
<P>
	Senate passage came after the Clinton administration on Tuesday  
dropped a long-standing veto threat, saying several amendments had 
made the measure more palatable. 
</P>
<P>
	One of those stressed a continued U.S. commitment to seeking  
nuclear arms reductions with the Russians. Opponents had suggested 
the original measure would have violated restrictions on a missile 
defense in the 1972 Anti-Ballistic Missile (ABM) Treaty. 
</P>
<P>
	With passage of the legislation assured, senators had spent most  
of the day skirmishing over political considerations, with 
Republicans accusing President Clinton and congressional Democrats 
of an eleventh-hour conversion. 
</P>
<P>
	Sen. Paul Wellstone, D-Minn., one of a handful of Democrats to  
oppose the final version, called the president's change of position 
``a serious mistake.'' He said the bill ``jeopardizes years of 
gains in achieving arms reductions.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Voting against the measure were three Democrats: Wellstone, and  
Sens. Richard Durbin of Illinois and Patrick Leahy of Vermont. 
</P>
<P>
	Republicans welcomed the belated support of the administration  
and its Democratic allies -- but questioned the timing. 
</P>
<P>
	The president ``should pick his fights with Congress on foreign  
policy issues'' more carefully, asserted Sen. John Warner, R-Va., 
chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee. He said the debate 
over missile defense should have been resolved earlier and that 
Clinton's slowness to recognize this set back development of such a 
system. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm glad to hear (Clinton) has now dropped his veto threat.  
But as usual, his pledge comes a little late and falls short,'' 
said Sen. Bob Smith, R-N.H., a 2000 presidential aspirant. ``For 
whatever reason, the president has failed to help us build a system 
to protect the nation against ballistic missile attack.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Democrats cited reports of North Korean ballistic-missile tests  
and Chinese nuclear-weapons espionage in suddenly dropping their 
opposition, along with an amendment designed to keep the 
development of such a system from interfering with efforts to 
negotiate further nuclear weapons decreases with Russia. 
</P>
<P>
	``I come to the floor supportive of the notion that we are in a  
new world today. ... It is a new world that seeks to protect us 
against a rogue, accidental or unauthorized'' missile firing, Sen. 
John Kerry, D-Mass., told the Senate. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, he said, the United States shouldn't ``rush headlong into  
the building of a system that just creates greater unrest ... and 
more question marks.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Senate was expected to pass the bill later today by a  
lopsided margin. 
</P>
<P>
	The bill would make it U.S. policy to deploy a national  
ballistic-missile defense ``as soon as technologically possible.'' 
The administration had wanted to delay a decision on whether to 
field such a system until June 2000, after which actually building 
it would take an additional five years. 
</P>
<P>
	The administration agreed to a compromise Tuesday with  
Republicans designed to keep deployment of a national missile 
defense from interfering with arms-control efforts with Moscow. 
</P>
<P>
	The 99-0 acceptance of a proposal by Sens. Mary Landrieu, D-La.,  
and Olympia Snowe, R-Maine, all but assured passage of the overall 
measure. 
</P>
<P>
	Although Senate Democrats praised the compromise, critics  
suggested it was a face-saving gesture that recognized the growing 
popularity of the bill -- in the face of reports of North Korean 
missile tests and alleged Chinese weapons espionage. 
</P>
<P>
	Tom Collina of the Union of Concerned Scientists, which opposes  
the legislation, called the result ``sort of vacuous policy'' that 
he said will do little except annoy China and Russia. 
</P>
<P>
	``The Democrats are running scared on this,'' he said. ``The  
Republicans have had this issue for years. Now the threat has 
appeared and the Democrats were caught flat-footed.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But Sen. Carl Levin, D-Mich., who had fought for years to keep  
the bill from even coming to a Senate vote, praised the measure and 
said he did not think it would undermine the 1972 Anti-Ballistic 
Missile treaty with Moscow, as he claimed the original version 
would have. 
</P>
<P>
	Russia contends that the legislation violates the treaty and  
would put on hold any further nuclear weapons reductions. Russian 
lawmakers introduced a bill Tuesday that would make their approval 
of the START II arms reduction treaty -- which the United States is 
anxious to see ratified -- dependent on a U.S. commitment to the ABM 
treaty. 
</P>
<P>
	The administration had threatened a veto.  
</P>
<P>
	But, Levin told reporters after Tuesday's vote on the amendment,  
he was not certain that such a veto could have been sustained this 
year. The missile-defense bill ``was going to pass anyway, perhaps 
over the president's veto,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	The Landrieu-Snowe amendment still commits the United States to  
a missile-defense system. But it adds: ``It is the position of the 
United States to seek continued negotiated reductions in Russian 
nuclear forces.'' 
</P>
<P>
	That would uphold the spirit, if not the letter, of the ABM  
treaty, supporters said. That 1972 pact restricts the kinds of 
ballistic-missile defense that either Moscow or Washington can 
deploy.

<HEADLINE> Story Absolves Cleland in Explosion </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Sen. Max Cleland's deepest wound from the  
Vietnam War blast that cost him both legs and an arm has been the 
haunting prospect that it was his own grenade that exploded on that 
fateful day near Khe Sanh. 
</P>
<P>
	But now, 31 years later, a former Marine corporal has come  
forward with a story that absolves the Georgia Democrat of any 
blame for the tragic accident that happened just after his Army 
unit jumped from a helicopter to set up a radio relay station. 
</P>
<P>
	David Lloyd, who says he was one of the first to reach Cleland  
after the explosion, said in an interview Monday that he treated 
another soldier that day who was sobbing uncontrollably, ``It was 
my grenade, it was my grenade.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Lloyd doesn't know the identity of the other solider, but he  
said he was an Army private who had gotten off the helicopter just 
after Cleland and who suffered minor shrapnel wounds in the 
explosion. 
</P>
<P>
	``I put maybe 20 battle dressings on him and the whole time he  
was crying,'' said Lloyd, ``but he wasn't crying from the pain. He 
was crying more from knowing it was his grenade.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Lloyd said he was in Vietnam from November 1967 until November  
1968. The explosion occurred on April 8, 1968, as Cleland reached 
for the grenade he thought had fallen from his belt as he jumped 
from the helicopter. A Marine Corps spokesman said it would take 
several days to confirm Lloyd's military service from Vietnam-era 
records. 
</P>
<P>
	But Cleland said he met with the Annapolis, Md., man last week,  
viewed pictures and maps he brought back from Vietnam, shared 
battlefield memories and has no reason to doubt his account. 
</P>
<P>
	``It makes more sense than anything I've heard,'' said Cleland,  
who never knew the identity of any of the soldiers or corpsmen who 
came to his aid on the battlefield. 
</P>
<P>
	Cleland never knew for sure where the grenade came from, but he  
said it was ``easy after Vietnam to blame yourself as the victim. 
... What poured salt into my wounds was the possible knowledge that 
it could have been my grenade.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Cleland said he was stunned when Lloyd first called him two  
weeks ago. Lloyd had seen the senator on a cable television show 
relating how he had been saved by Navy corpsmen after a grenade 
that fell from his belt exploded. 
</P>
<P>
	Lloyd said he always knew Cleland was the soldier left crippled  
by the grenade explosion he witnessed, but before the television 
show, he never realized that Cleland didn't know what actually 
happened. 
</P>
<P>
	Lloyd contacted Cleland's office, the two spoke by phone a few  
days later, and then they had lunch together last week. 
</P>
<P>
	``I couldn't believe it,'' said Cleland. ``For 31 years you have  
in your mind a certain set of circumstances that you've pretty much 
come to terms with and all of a sudden a call like this out of the 
blue changes everything for you. ... It sent cold chills down my 
spine, caused me to relive the whole thing.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Cleland said he'd like to meet the soldier Lloyd treated. He  
said he probably was a soldier he didn't know who had joined his 
unit just before they left on the fateful helicopter ride. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'd tell him, don't feel guilty,'' said Cleland. ``We were all  
in situations where this could have happened to any of us. Live 
life the best you can, which is what I'm trying to do. There should 
not be any guilt there. It was just a tragic accident.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Cleland said he hopes to get to know Lloyd better, and plans to  
accept his invitation for a fishing trip. 
</P>
<P>
	``The Vietnam War requires a great deal of healing afterwards,''  
he said. ``The deepest wounds and scars we carry are the ones that 
are not visible and I've had a deep wound and scar about this all 
my life. I think this will help me move on to a little deeper 
healing than I was experiencing.''

<HEADLINE> Congress Asked To Aid Performers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Yes, indeed, rock 'n' roll is here to stay.  
And in some cases, it's not only lasted, it's multiplied, with 
several sets of Platters, Drifters and other 50s favorites 
performing at the same time in different cities. 
</P>
<P>
	Carl Gardner, an original member of The Coasters, has been  
irritated by what he considers impostors for more than 20 years. 
Now he's one of about a dozen golden-oldie performers who've asked 
Congress to protect them from competitors using the same names and 
singing the same songs. 
</P>
<P>
	``These guys are making like they're the real Coasters. They're  
in their 20s and 30s and I'm 70 years old,'' Gardner said Monday 
from his home in Florida. ``This trademark law must be changed. If 
we don't nip this thing in the bud now it's going to go across the 
whole United States with all entertainers.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Reps. Dennis Kucinich, D-Ohio, and Charles Norwood, R-Ga., were  
introducing legislation today that would help old chart-toppers 
defend their crowns. If they sue for damages under trademark law 
and win, the law would allow higher damages. 
</P>
<P>
	``You have to pay a $50,000 bond just to start a court case, in  
case you lose. That's a lot of money,'' said Gardner. ``I'm 
working, but sporadically. These other guys, they don't even charge 
the kind of money I charge. If I charge $10,000 a night they'll 
charge $2,000 a night.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The groups that climbed the Top 40 in the 1950s and 1960s often  
had rosters that changed through the years. Sometimes, later-year 
replacements took the material on the road with their own groups, 
even though some member of the core group was still performing. 
</P>
<P>
	Other times, dispute over the ownership of the group's name made  
it possible for entire new bands to be hired to re-create the music 
without any direct link to the original group. 
</P>
<P>
	Larry Marshak of RCI Corp. in New York, who packages East Coast  
and West Coast versions of the Platters, Drifters and Coasters, 
said he has valid, legal rights to those names, and does nothing 
deceptive with his troupes of young singers performing old hits. 
</P>
<P>
	``We make no illusions to be otherwise than what they are.  
Nobody expects to see the original members when they see us,'' he 
said. ``It's like on any given weekend you'll have six Glenn Miller 
Orchestras or Tommy Dorsey Orchestras performing, and Glenn 
Miller's been dead for years.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Marshak said he started putting together revival shows in the  
1970s, reuniting some original band members or using originals as 
advisers to work with entirely new groups performing the old 
material. 
</P>
<P>
	Kucinich, who takes seriously his home town's role as host of  
the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame, said he was pushing for a change in 
a 1947 trademark law because both artists and consumers need 
protection. 
</P>
<P>
	``The knockoff groups should not be permitted to pass themselves  
off as the real thing,'' the Cleveland congressman said. ``Those 
artists who have put their heart and soul into building a career 
and making a name and into stunning achievements in music ought not 
be deprived in later life from the fruits of their labor.''

<HEADLINE> Gold Prices Fall on Selloff Talk </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	RENO, Nev. (AP) -- Gold prices have fallen 3 percent since French  
President Jacques Chirac and then President Clinton endorsed the 
sale of International Monetary Fund vast gold reserves to help 
countries ravaged by poverty. 
</P>
<P>
	Sen. Richard Bryan, D-Nev., warned on Wednesday that the drop in  
prices is just a hint of the chilling effect the actual sale would 
have. 
</P>
<P>
	``It is abundantly clear that if the administration and IMF  
carried through on this proposal it would hurt an already injured 
gold mining industry,'' Bryan said. ``It makes no sense to run the 
risk of sacrificing thousands of mining jobs in the United States 
at the expense of a misguided proposal.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Mining executives in South Africa were less gloomy.  
</P>
<P>
	``It's not particularly confidence-inspiring, but it's not  
something we are too worried about,'' Chris Thompson, chairman of 
Gold Fields Ltd., the world's fourth-largest producer, said on 
Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	South Africa is the world leader in gold output, followed by  
Australia. Nevada by itself is No. 3. 
</P>
<P>
	Gold prices, which only last week hovered near $295 an ounce,  
have dropped 3 percent since Chirac's suggestion on Monday. It 
recovered a bit on Wednesday, rising 30 cents in trading on the New 
York Mercantile Exchange to close at $283.50. 
</P>
<P>
	Chirac said that the money could be used owed by the poorest  
Latin American countries that already were reeling in poverty even 
before they were hit by Hurricane Mitch 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton suggested on Tuesday that revenue from IMF gold could be  
used to ease the financial misery in African countries as well. 
</P>
<P>
	Bryan, who sits on the Senate Banking Committee, has argued that  
the selloff could wind up hurting many of the poor countries it's 
intended to help because they are significant gold producers. 
</P>
<P>
	Mining represents 37 percent of Ghana's exports, 36 percent of  
Mali's and 24 percent of Guyana's, according to 1997 figures. 
</P>
<P>
	The South African Cabinet echoed that concern on Wednesday.  
</P>
<P>
	``The actual detail ... would have to be discussed taking into  
account the impact it would have on gold-producing countries,'' it 
said in a statement. ``The impact of any mechanism decided upon 
should not be to cause new problems.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In Australia, director Robert Guy of NM Rothschild and Sons  
urged individual central banks to delay auctions if the IMF 
proceeds with a sale. ``There is a strong case for a self-denying 
ordinance,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	IMF spokesman William Murray said earlier that if any sale does  
occur, it likely would involve less than 5 million ounces and would 
take place gradually. 
</P>
<P>
	``It wouldn't be dumped on the market. We're not in the business  
of disrupting financial markets,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> Fed: Economic Growth Still Robust </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The economy's strong points -- consumer  
spending and construction -- are gaining still more and even 
long-beleaguered manufacturing industries are showing modest 
improvement this year, the Federal Reserve said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Robust demand for labor is making qualified workers harder to  
find than last year, contributing to an acceleration in wage 
increases, but inflation nevertheless remains tame, the central 
bank said in a survey of regional economic conditions before March 
8. 
</P>
<P>
	``Prices of most goods remained little changed, and ...  
businesses remain reluctant to press for price increases,'' it said 
in its ``beige book'' report, named after the color of its cover. 
</P>
<P>
	The reported combination of thriving growth and scant inflation  
implied Fed policy-makers probably will decide against a change in 
interest rates when they meet March 30. 
</P>
<P>
	With world economic turmoil roiling Wall Street, they cut  
interest rates three times last fall to cushion what most 
economists thought would be a significant slowdown in the United 
States. The slowdown has not arrived, nor have inflation problems 
that can accompany strong economic growth. 
</P>
<P>
	The beige book, a compilation of anecdotal information collected  
by the Fed's 12 regional banks, confirmed statistical reports 
showing the economy maintained its vigor despite problems in 
agriculture and energy production and lingering weakness in some 
manufacturing industries, particularly apparel. 
</P>
<P>
	But for many manufacturers, ``the tone ... improved in most  
districts,'' the survey said. 
</P>
<P>
	Six banks -- New York, Philadelphia, Richmond, Va., St. Louis,  
Minneapolis and San Francisco -- reported stronger manufacturing; 
five -- Boston, Cleveland, Atlanta, Chicago and Dallas -- reported 
mixed conditions. Only one, Kansas City, said manufacturing 
remained weak. 
</P>
<P>
	``The Fed's view of the manufacturing sector is important  
because it is one of the few areas of the U.S. economy that has 
been struggling,'' said economist Mark Vitner of First Union Corp. 
in Charlotte, N.C. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, ``post-holiday discounting and mild weather in some  
regions'' contributed to continued strength in consumer spending, 
it said. ``Motor vehicle sales increased, led by light trucks, and 
furniture sales benefited from robust home sales.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Agriculture, however, ``continued to be plagued by low farm  
commodity prices, and an increasing number of farmers were under 
financial stress.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Also, three districts -- Minneapolis, Kansas City and San  
Francisco -- ``reported that falling oil prices were causing some 
oil and gas wells to be withdrawn from production.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In a speech Tuesday, Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan  
said that despite near-term challenges in agriculture, most farmers 
and farm lenders remained optimistic about the sector's long-term 
prospects. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, the beige book said, ``finding qualified workers has  
become more difficult in several districts, and reports of faster 
wage increases were more widespread than in recent months.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In the Philadelphia district, factories planned to add workers.  
Employers told the New York and Kansas City districts that finding 
even entry-level workers was difficult.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Prices remain stable, the report said, with the exception of  
construction material such as lumber, drywall and insulation.

<HEADLINE> Gates May Contradict Trial in Book </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Microsoft Corp. Chairman Bill Gates, writing  
in an upcoming book about the benefits of technology for business, 
appears to directly contradict a key witness for his company at its 
antitrust trial when he describes how Microsoft tracks important 
sales figures. 
</P>
<P>
	A prominent economist testifying for Microsoft just weeks ago  
told a federal judge that the company's accounting records were 
kept ``by hand on sheets of paper.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But Gates, in his new book, ``Business at the Speed of  
Thought,'' says the figures are recorded digitally. 
</P>
<P>
	``When figures are in electronic form, knowledge workers can  
study them, annotate them, look at them in any amount of detail,'' 
Gates wrote. ``Going digital changes your business.'' 
</P>
<P>
	And in an interview Tuesday with the Financial Times newspaper,  
which is publishing a four-part series from his book, Gates 
described how Microsoft, with $14.4 billion in sales last year, 
already uses an array of high-tech tools. 
</P>
<P>
	``The sales results are in digital form, so anytime I want to I  
can look by country, by product, exactly how sales compare to 
budget, how they compare to other groups,'' Gates said. 
</P>
<P>
	But that wasn't how the company's accounting practices were  
described in sworn testimony for presiding U.S. District Judge 
Thomas Penfield Jackson, who's expected to return a verdict in the 
case this summer. 
</P>
<P>
	Justice Department lawyer David Boies asked Richard Schmalensee  
of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology about the 
profitability of the company's dominant Windows operating system. 
</P>
<P>
	``I will be honest with you,'' answered Schmalensee, an  
important witness for the company. ``The state of Microsoft's 
internal accounting systems do not always rise to the level of 
sophistication one might expect from a firm as successful as it 
is.'' 
</P>
<P>
	When Boies pressed him, Schmalensee added: ``They record  
operating system sales by hand on sheets of paper.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Spectators in the courtroom gasped, and Boies immediately told  
the judge, ``Your honor, I have no more questions.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Microsoft spokesman Mark Murray said Tuesday that Gates was  
describing sales data, while Schmalensee was testifying about 
methods to track profits. 
</P>
<P>
	``We obviously have our sales receipts,'' Murray said, ``but how  
you assign profit is not something that we have'' in digital form. 
</P>
<P>
	In his new book, also serialized in current issues of Time  
magazine, Gates also encourages companies to ``insist that 
communication flow through e-mail.'' He called it ``a key component 
of our digital nervous system.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``There's no doubt that e-mail flattens the hierarchical  
structure of an organization,'' Gates wrote. ``It encourages people 
to speak up. It encourages managers to listen. That's why, when 
customers ask what's the first thing they can do to get more value 
out of their information systems and foster collaboration in their 
companies, I always answer, e-mail.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Throughout the company's antitrust trial, government lawyers  
have produced a string of embarrassing e-mails -- many from Gates 
himself -- that appear to contradict its witnesses. 
</P>
<P>
	Microsoft has protested loudly that lawyers are using  
``snippets'' of its e-mail taken out of context, and it has 
produced equally humiliating e-mails from some of its business 
rivals. 
</P>
<P>
	``I do not have a single piece of e-mail of a business nature  
that I would be embarrassed to have made public,'' Gates told 
Financial Times. ``Every piece of e-mail I have sent over the past 
decade has been read by 50 government lawyers, so there is nothing 
new. I live the examined life.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Microsoft trial is in the midst of a six-week recess and is  
scheduled to resume no earlier than April 12. 
</P>
<P>
	Gates' book goes on sale March 24.

<HEADLINE> Hale Takes Plea Bargain in Sex Case </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	FORT LEWIS, Wash. (AP) -- A retired Army general has agreed to  
plead guilty to charges involving sexual improprieties with the 
wives of his subordinate in exchange for a reduced sentence. 
</P>
<P>
	Retired Maj. Gen. David Hale, 53, offered to enter the pleas  
before a military judge today ``because he is guilty'' of eight 
military offenses, defense attorney Frank Spinner said. 
</P>
<P>
	Spinner insisted his client wasn't admitting to ``non-consensual  
sexual offenses.'' He declined to discuss details of the deal, as 
did Army prosecutors and the court-martial judge, Col. Stephen 
Saynisch. 
</P>
<P>
	Saynisch will forward sentencing recommendations to Fort Lewis  
commander Lt. Gen. George Crocker, who will impose sentence. 
</P>
<P>
	In exchange for Hale's pleas, the Army has dropped nine charges  
against him. The remaining charges include seven counts of conduct 
unbecoming an officer -- including having four improper 
relationships with the wives of subordinates -- and one count of 
making false official statements. 
</P>
<P>
	Hale faces up to 11 years in prison, the loss of his  
$75,000-a-year pension and dismissal from the service. Under the 
initial 17 charges, he had faced the possibility of 56 years in 
prison if convicted. 
</P>
<P>
	Hale, 53, was allowed to retire with honor in February 1998  
after four months as a deputy inspector general, despite suspicions 
about alleged improprieties while he was a top NATO commander in 
southern Europe. 
</P>
<P>
	The allegations surfaced last year when The Washington Times  
reported that a woman named Donnamaria Carpino Madden had accused 
Hale of forcing her into a four-month sexual relationship in Turkey 
while her husband, an Army colonel, was posted there. 
</P>
<P>
	He was also accused of having improper relationships with the  
wives of subordinate officers in Turkey as well as Virginia, Maine, 
Connecticut and Nevada. The alleged relationships occurred from 
1996 to 1998. 
</P>
<P>
	``Today I feel elated and vindicated because Maj. Gen. Hale will  
soon stand before the country and the world as a convicted felon,'' 
Mrs. Madden said in a statement. 
</P>
<P>
	``Justice has prevailed in what was a long and tortuous struggle  
for myself and my family,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Madden also has filed a civil action against the Army and  
Air Force officials, alleging they tried to discredit her and 
``defend one of their own,'' said her lawyer, Mark Zaid. 
</P>
<P>
	Last fall, Defense Secretary William Cohen tightened retirement  
rules for top officers after some congressmen complained that 
Hale's quiet retirement represented a double standard when people 
of lower rank were court-martialed over such allegations.

<HEADLINE> Jags' Boselli Signs $26M Extension </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	JACKSONVILLE, Fla. (AP) -- Tony Boselli, widely considered the  
best offensive lineman in the NFL, is going to be paid like it. 
</P>
<P>
	The Jacksonville Jaguars finally made good on a promise to make  
Boselli the highest-paid offensive lineman in the NFL on Tuesday, 
agreeing to a four-year contract extension worth $26 million. 
</P>
<P>
	The All-Pro left tackle will play out two of the final three  
years of his current contract, which pays him an average of $2.5 
million per year. 
</P>
<P>
	The contract will take effect in 2001 and will keep him in  
Jacksonville through 2004, a source familiar with the negotiations 
told The Associated Press. 
</P>
<P>
	The Jaguars would not comment on the signing, but the Florida  
Times-Union and radio station WBWL in Jacksonville also reported 
the four-year extension Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's nice to be rewarded for playing at a certain level,''  
Boselli was quoted in today's Times-Union. ``I appreciate the 
commitment being made by the Jaguars.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Boselli will average $6.5 million a year under the new deal,  
surpassing tackle Orlando Brown as the highest-paid offensive 
lineman in the NFL. Last month, the Cleveland Browns signed Brown 
to a contract that averaged out to $4.5 million per year. 
</P>
<P>
	The newspaper reported that Boselli's deal included a $4 million  
signing bonus and an additional $4 million in roster bonuses to be 
paid in $2 million installments in 2002 and 2003. 
</P>
<P>
	The deal secures the player who became the cornerstone of the  
franchise in 1995, when the Jaguars used their first-ever draft 
pick to select him. 
</P>
<P>
	It also closes a contentious period that began last year when  
team owner Wayne Weaver, pressed about the possibility of 
renegotiating Boselli's contract, promised that he would ``take 
care'' of his star lineman in the near future. 
</P>
<P>
	A whole season passed with no deal and this week's NFL meetings  
in Phoenix -- where Jaguars officials met with Boselli's agent -- 
were considered a crucial period for the negotiations, with the 
team's voluntary offseason workout program set to begin March 23. 
</P>
<P>
	With Boselli's signing, the Jaguars now have the entire core of  
their offense -- quarterback Mark Brunell, receivers Jimmy Smith and 
Keenan McCardell, running back Fred Taylor and right tackle Leon 
Searcy -- in the midst of long-term deals.

<HEADLINE> Yugoslav Army Buildup Continues </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Clinton administration is giving no  
indication that a threatened NATO air attack on Serbia is imminent, 
even as the Yugoslav Army continues a troop buildup in and around 
Kosovo. 
</P>
<P>
	``There should be no doubt that the Serb forces, military and  
police, and some irregular paramilitary forces are continuing the 
fighting at this time,'' Gen. Wesley Clark, NATO's supreme 
commander, said today. 
</P>
<P>
	In testimony before the House Armed Services Committee, Clark  
contended that the Serb forces were ``prepared to resume the 
conflict on a very large scale should these peace talks fail to 
result in an agreement or should they conclude that for some reason 
NATO wasn't serious in its expressed intent.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He said the warning about NATO military action was a ``credible  
threat.'' 
</P>
<P>
	National Security Council official Jim Steinberg said U.S.  
officials in Belgrade had put the Serbs on notice that they were 
monitoring the troop movements. ``We're obviously very concerned 
about what we're seeing in terms of military movements,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	The second round of Kosovo peace talks continued for a third day  
today, with Serbs demanding major changes in the proposed accord 
that Western negotiators deemed unacceptable. 
</P>
<P>
	Pentagon spokesman Kenneth Bacon said Tuesday that 16,000 to  
21,000 Yugoslav Army troops are now on the perimeter of the Serb 
province of Kosovo, up from about 10,000 reported two weeks ago and 
4,500 in late February. An additional 14,000 to 18,000 Yugoslav 
Army forces are deployed inside Kosovo, Bacon said. 
</P>
<P>
	``They certainly are bracing for war,'' even while continuing to  
participate in peace talks in Paris, Bacon said. 
</P>
<P>
	NATO has about 12,000 troops in Macedonia, on Kosovo's southern  
border, but they are intended only for a peacekeeping mission in 
the event of a peace agreement in which both sides accept the use 
of NATO troops, Bacon said. Most of the NATO troops are from 
Britain and other European countries, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	At the State Department, officials warned the Serbs anew about  
blocking a settlement in Kosovo. But they but gave no indication 
that NATO was about to unleash its long-threatened air strikes on 
Serbia. 
</P>
<P>
	Secretary of State Madeleine Albright had threatened last month,  
when the talks broke off inconclusively, that NATO would strike 
hard at Serb facilities if the Serbs became the only obstacle to a 
peace deal. The Kosovar Albanians, who are fighting for 
independence from Yugoslavia, gave their consent to the peace plan 
this week, leaving the Serbs alone in opposing the plan. 
</P>
<P>
	Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic has not relented in his  
refusal to permit NATO peacekeepers on Serb territory as enforcers 
of a peace settlement. On top of that, State Department spokesman 
James Rubin said, Serb negotiators have raised ``a whole series of 
questions'' about the self-rule plan itself. 
</P>
<P>
	``There is not a lot of reason for optimism,'' Rubin said  
Tuesday, adding that the Serbs must decide ``whether they want a 
peace agreement rather than a catastrophe.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The spokesman said Albright has no plan to join the negotiations  
in Paris. 
</P>
<P>
	However, Rubin then flew to Paris unannounced, again raising  
speculation that Albright may join the talks. 
</P>
<P>
	Bacon at the Pentagon told reporters that Yugoslav Army troops  
had moved seven T-72 battle tanks into Kosovo. He called this the 
``most disturbing'' news provided by the team of international 
verifiers monitoring Kosovo under auspices of the Organization for 
Security and Cooperation in Europe. 
</P>
<P>
	Bacon said U.S. and allied aircraft remain prepared to conduct  
airstrikes against Serb targets if NATO authorities issue the 
orders. He said about 400 allied aircraft are in the area, 
including about 250 American planes. 
</P>
<P>
	The number of U.S. planes declined when the aircraft carrier USS  
Enterprise -- home to about 70 aircraft -- left the Mediterranean Sea 
on Sunday to take up station in the Persian Gulf. There is no U.S. 
aircraft carrier in the Mediterranean now, although one is due to 
arrive there next month. 
</P>
<P>
	To fill the gap created by the Enterprise's departure, an  
unspecified number of Air Force F-15 Strike Eagle aircraft will be 
moved to Aviano air base in Italy from elsewhere in Europe, Bacon 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition to an array of European naval vessels in the  
Mediterranean, there are several U.S. Navy ships, including the 
cruiser USS Philippine Sea, the destroyers USS Nicholson and USS 
Gonzalez, two attack submarines and USS Thorn, which is the 
flagship for NATO's naval force in Mediterranean, which is now in 
the Adriatic. All six of those ships are armed with Tomahawk cruise 
missiles. 
</P>
<P>
	Also in the NATO force are a Greek destroyer and frigates from  
Germany, Italy, the Netherlands, Spain, Britain and Turkey, Bacon 
said.

<HEADLINE> Global Crossing Buys Frontier </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Global Crossing Ltd. of Bermuda is buying the  
larger U.S. telephone company Frontier Corp. for about $11.2 
billion in stock in the latest alliance in the telecommunications 
industry. 
</P>
<P>
	The deal announced today gives Global Crossing a foothold in the  
U.S. market where Frontier competes with long-distance phone 
service providers like AT&AMP;T Corp., MCI WorldCom Inc. and Sprint 
Corp. 
</P>
<P>
	Frontier also provides local phone service in its home market of  
Rochester, N.Y., as well in 31 other states and the District of 
Columbia. 
</P>
<P>
	Together, the combined companies in 1999 would have revenue of  
more than $4 billion, a stock-market value of nearly $30 billion 
and more than 8,500 employees. 
</P>
<P>
	Global Crossing has been building a fiber-optic communications  
network to carry voice and data traffic worldwide. Together, the 
companies will connect 159 cities worldwide with more than 71,000 
miles of fiber- optic cable. 
</P>
<P>
	Frontier had $2.6 billion in revenue last year and boasts over  
8,000 employees. Global Crossing, based in Hamilton, Bermuda, has 
about 200 employees and is on track to achieve $1 billion in 
revenue this year, according to The Wall Street Journal, which 
first reported the deal. 
</P>
<P>
	The acquisition has been approved by the boards of both  
companies but is subject to approval by shareholders and regulatory 
clearance. The deal is expected to close before October. 
</P>
<P>
	Global Crossing is headed by Robert Annunziata, a former top  
executive at AT&AMP;T who became its chief executive just a few weeks 
ago. Annunziata built Teleport Communications Group before selling 
the local-exchange carrier to AT&AMP;T for $12 billion in 1998. 
</P>
<P>
	Frontier's chief executive, Joseph P. Clayton, will become a  
vice chairman of Global Crossing. 
</P>
<P>
	Global Crossing is offering $62 a share in stock under certain  
conditions for each Frontier share, a 40 percent premium over 
Frontier's closing price Tuesday of $44.62 1/2 on the New York Stock 
Exchange. Global Crossing shares fell $5.06 1/4 to $51.50 on Tuesday 
in Nasdaq Stock Market trading. 
</P>
<P>
	On the news, Frontier shares shot up almost 14 percent, rising  
$6.12 1/2 to $50.75 a share at midmorning on the New York Stock 
Exchange. Global Crossing tumbled 10 percent, or by $5.25, to 
$46.25 a share on the Nasdaq Stock Market. 
</P>
<P>
	The offered price depends on shares of Global Crossing trading  
between $34.56 and $56.78.

<TEXT>
<P>
	ROCHESTER, N.Y. (AP) -- Frontier Corp., a century-old telephone  
carrier with a nationwide long-distance network, is being snapped 
up for $11.2 billion in stock by Global Crossing Ltd., a 
Bermuda-based upstart in telecommunications. 
</P>
<P>
	The deal, announced Wednesday, provides a U.S. foothold for  
Global Crossing, a two-year-old company that's building a worldwide 
fiber-optic network to carry voice, data, video and Internet 
traffic. 
</P>
<P>
	With the addition of Frontier, that network would connect 159  
cities in the United States, Japan, Europe and Latin America. 
</P>
<P>
	But while Global Crossing has more than twice the fiber reach of  
Frontier with 51,000 miles of cable, it's the smaller company by 
far with just 200 employees and sales of $424 million in 1998, 
although that's expected to reach $1 billion this year. 
</P>
<P>
	Frontier, founded in 1899 as Rochester Telephone, has more than  
8,000 employees and had $2.6 billion in revenues last year. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, Global Crossing has been raising many industry eye brows  
of late, having snatched away a top AT&AMP;T executive to become its 
chief executive just weeks ago. 
</P>
<P>
	That man, Robert Annunziata, was the former head of Teleport  
Communications Group, a local telephone company he built up and 
sold to AT&AMP;T for $12 billion last year. 
</P>
<P>
	Frontier sprouted beyond its roots as a local phone monopoly in  
Rochester, N.Y., by buying more than a half-dozen long-distance 
carriers in the 1990s and becoming one of the nation's top 10 
long-distance providers. 
</P>
<P>
	Then, in 1996, it paid $500 million for part of a national  
fiber-optic network being built by Qwest Communications 
International -- a pittance by today's values. 
</P>
<P>
	Frontier competes with long-distance phone service providers  
like AT&AMP;T, MCI and Sprint by serving small and medium-sized 
businesses. It also provides local phone service in 32 states and 
the District of Columbia. 
</P>
<P>
	Global Crossing, which is planning undersea networks to link up  
four continents, has previously operated only as a wholesaler, 
selling space on its network to long-distance telephone providers. 
</P>
<P>
	``They're going to continue to have a big wholesale strategy as  
well as migrating more and more into retail, focusing on 
businesses, and primarily businesses that are multinational,'' said 
Todd Scott, an analyst with ING Baring in New York City. 
</P>
<P>
	``By the time they're done building their network, they're going  
to be going into every major city in the world and certainly be big 
enough to be a global player,'' he said. ``And Frontier's network 
in the U.S. is as big as anyone else's.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Frontier's chief executive, Joseph P. Clayton, will become a  
vice chairman of Global Crossing. Analysts had viewed Clayton's 
hiring by Frontier in 1997 as designed to shape it up for a 
probable takeover. 
</P>
<P>
	Global Crossing is offering $62 a share in stock for each  
Frontier share, a 40 percent premium over Frontier's closing price 
on Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	In Wednesday's trading on the New York Stock Exchange, Frontier  
surged $5.87 1/2, or 13 percent, to $50.50 a share on the New York 
Stock Exchange. Global Crossing fell $4.37 1/2, or 8.5 percent, to 
$47.12 1/2 on the Nasdaq Stock Market.

<P>
	ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) -- A grand jury is investigating the disputed  
draw in the heavyweight title fight between Lennox Lewis and 
Evander Holyfield. 
</P>
<P>
	The panel will issue subpoenas and hear testimony about the  
judging of Saturday night's bout at Madison Square Garden, a 
spokeswoman for Manhattan District Attorney Robert Morgenthau said 
Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Spokeswoman Barbara Thompas declined to discuss what  
illegalities, if any, Morgenthau thinks could be involved. 
</P>
<P>
	One source close to the investigation, who asked not to be  
identified, said: ``We could be looking at tampering or illegal 
payments. Then again, maybe we're looking at lousy judging, which 
is not a crime.'' 
</P>
<P>
	State Attorney General Eliot Spitzer will offer Morgenthau's  
investigators ``any and all assistance in their attempt to pursue a 
criminal case,'' Spitzer spokesman Darren Dopp said. 
</P>
<P>
	Spitzer, who worked for Morgenthau for six years, canceled a  
public hearing for Friday involving many of the principals in the 
fight Lewis was widely believed to have won. 
</P>
<P>
	Among those who had been scheduled to attend were promoter Don  
King and judge Eugenia Williams, the IBF judge who had Holyfield 
winning. 
</P>
<P>
	Holyfield is the IBF and WBA heavyweight champion. Lewis of  
Britain holds the WBC title. 
</P>
<P>
	Another hearing, scheduled for Thursday in Manhattan by the  
state Senate Committee on Investigations, will go forward, 
according to its chairman, state Sen. Roy Goodman of Manhattan. 
</P>
<P>
	Among those to appear are King and Dino Duva, Lewis' American  
promoter; Bob Lee, the IBF president; Arthur Mercante Jr., the 
bout's referee; and Williams. 
</P>
<P>
	Testifying by phone will be Larry O'Connell of England, the WBC  
judge who scored the fight a draw; Stanley Christodoulou of South 
Africa, the WBA judge who declared Lewis the winner; and WBC 
president Jose Sulaiman. 
</P>
<P>
	Goodman said his hearing will focus on the judging of Saturday's  
fight, the relationships between the sanctioning bodies and the 
boxing industry and health issues involving fighters. 
</P>
<P>
	``We'll really be taking a helicopter trip over all of the  
terrain of big-time boxing and whether there were improprieties in 
this fight,'' Goodman said. 
</P>
<P>
	The New York State Athletic Commission is also investigating the  
fight. 
</P>
<P>
	U.S. Sen. John McCain of Arizona, who sat ringside at the bout,  
said Wednesday that state athletic commissions must take the lead 
in reforming professional boxing and not wait for the federal 
government to step in. 
</P>
<P>
	He added that meaningful nationwide reforms might result from  
the dispute surrounding the bout and the four investigations it has 
prompted. 
</P>
<P>
	For a start, he said, state athletic commissions should appoint  
all ringside officials at bouts and not give international 
sanctioning bodies the opportunity to place potentially biased 
judges at a fight. 
</P>
<P>
	``State commissioners should not surrender any of their  
authority to sanctioning organizations or promoters,'' McCain said 
in a letter to Spitzer. ``When they do, boxers are subject to 
manipulation and the public is cheated.'' 
</P>
<P>
	McCain has been working with a task force of state attorneys  
general, headed by Spitzer, to develop federal legislation to 
reform boxing that has been named of Muhammad Ali. 
</P>
<P>
	McCain said boxing is rife with ``conflicts of interest and  
fraudulent practices'' that contributed to the Lewis-Holyfield 
draw. 
</P>
<P>
	``The best outcome of the Holyfield-Lewis bout would be a  
complete overhaul of boxing industry abuses in America,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Lee, the IBF president, defended the work of Williams, the judge  
his organization selected for the bout. 
</P>
<P>
	``I am sure they aren't going to find anything irregular at  
all,'' he said. ``It is a subjective viewing of a fight and you 
can't tell these judges what to see or what not to see. All I tell 
them is, `Do the best you can.''' 
</P>
<P>
	Also Wednesday, two state legislators, Sen. John DeFrancisco and  
Assemblyman Paul Tokasz, filed similar bills to require that 
judges' scores be posted after every round in New York to give 
others an idea of which fighter is ahead.

	Fed: Economic Growth Still Robust  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The robust economic growth of 1998 carried  
into the new year with strong consumer spending, brisk construction 
activity and increasing demand for labor, the Federal Reserve said 
today. Despite that, ``Prices of most goods remained little 
changed, and ... businesses remain reluctant to press for price 
increases,'' the central bank said in a survey of regional economic 
conditions before March 8. The report, known as the ``beige book,'' 
after the color of its cover, implies Fed policy-makers probably 
will opt for no change in interest rates when they meet March 30.

	Netscape Shareholders OK Merger  
</P>
<P>
	DULLES, Va. (AP) -- America Online Inc. completed its nearly $10  
billion acquisition of Netscape Communications Corp. today, 
creating a powerful new Internet force with two of the top Web 
destinations. AOL completed its all-stock purchase after Netscape 
shareholders voted overwhelmingly in favor of the deal, removing 
the last remaining hurdle. The Justice Department said last week it 
wouldn't oppose the takeover. Dulles, Va.-based AOL, the world's 
largest Internet access and online service provider, plans to use 
Netscape's assets to gain key advantages in its battle with 
Microsoft Corp. to dominate the main Web sites where people get 
information and buy goods and services.

	NEW YORK (AP) -- Stock prices drifted lower today, halting  
another attempt by the Dow Jones industrial average to close above 
10,000, as interest rates rose in the bond market. The Dow Jones 
industrial average closed down 51.06 at 9,879.41, or nearly 121 
points shy of 10,000. On Tuesday, the index briefly passed that 
milestone for the first time before falling back and closing with a 
loss. The Nasdaq composite index declined 10.30 to 2,428.97. The 
Dow made some headway in the first hour of trading today, rising as 
high as 9,960.71, or less than 40 points away from 10,000. But bond 
prices backed off, and stocks followed.

	BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) -- Members of the European Commission who  
resigned over a report about fraud and mismanagement said today 
they will take on no new initiatives while waiting to be replaced. 
The 20-member Commission, which oversees the European Union's 
bureaucracy and $94 billion budget, said in a statement it would 
only deal with current and urgent business.''We have resigned and 
have no desire or intention of remaining in office a moment longer

	Kaiser Members Sue HMO Over Ads

<P>
	SAN FRANCISCO (AP) -- Members of one of the nation's largest HMOs  
have sued the organization, claiming they were duped by ads that 
said its doctors weren't influenced by financial concerns. The 
proposed class-action lawsuit contends Kaiser Permanente and its 
parent, The Permanente Federation, compromised care with their 
policies. The lawsuit was brought by the nonprofit Foundation for 
Taxpayer and Consumer Rights and filed in Superior Court yesterday. 
It contends that Kaiser withheld up to 30 percent of doctors' 
salaries and tied physician bonus pay and other compensation to 
reaching certain profit goals. Kaiser called the allegations 
``patently false.''

	DaimlerChrysler Unveils Concept Car  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- DaimlerChrysler AG stepped forward today in  
the competition among automakers to develop fuel-cell cars with a 
version that seats five passengers. Ferdinand Panik, head of 
DaimlerChrysler's fuel-cell program, said NECAR 4 was a 
breakthrough because the fuel-cell technology was small enough to 
fit in a compact car but there was still room to seat five 
passengers instead of just two. The fuel cells were stacked 
underneath the car's floorboard and the liquid hydrogen tank took 
up some space in its small trunk.

	House Considers FCC Changes  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The chief of the commission that shapes how  
Americans get telephone and TV services told House lawmakers who 
want to overhaul the agency that protecting consumers and keeping 
phone rates affordable for the poor must remain priorities. A major 
priority for one of the top lawmakers, meanwhile, is for the 
Federal Communications Commission to reduce regulations. ``The 
expansion of communications choices is already leading to greater 
consumer confusion,'' FCC Chairman Bill Kennard told a House 
hearing. ``Consumers will need clear and accurate information about 
their choices, guarantees of basic privacy and swift action if any 
company cheats rather than competes for business.''

	House Passes Steel Quota Bill

passed the House today as supporters criticized the Clinton 
administration's trade policies and its commitment to U.S. 
steelworkers. The bill passed 289-141 over the objections of GOP 
leaders and President Clinton, who has threatened a veto. It faces 
an uncertain future in the Senate. But today's vote showed 
lawmakers' desire for tougher action to help an industry struggling 
against low-priced imports from Japan, Russia and other countries.

property in Brazil, agriculture officials said today. The company 
called the move temporary, but the environmental group Greenpeace 
said it was prompted by weeks of protests by various groups, 
including a lawsuit aimed at halting a license to plant the 
``Roundup Ready'' soybeans. The soybeans are genetically altered to 
allow the application of Monsanto's Roundup herbicides without 
harming the crop.

<HEADLINE>  DaimlerChrysler Unveils New Car </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- DaimlerChrysler AG stepped forward Wednesday  
in the competition among automakers to develop fuel-cell cars with 
a version that seats five passengers. 
</P>
<P>
	``Now we begin the race to make the vehicles affordable to our  
customers,'' DaimlerChrysler co-chairman Juergen Schrempp said at a 
press conference where the NECAR 4, a compact car, was formally 
unveiled. 
</P>
<P>
	Although DaimlerChrysler claims to lead in such technology,  
other companies are working on their own fuel-cell cars, aiming to 
market them to consumers by 2004. Ford Motor Co. officials said 
they expect to have a driveable version of their five-seat 
fuel-cell car, the P2000, sometime this spring. 
</P>
<P>
	Ferdinand Panik, head of DaimlerChrysler's fuel-cell program,  
said NECAR 4 was a breakthrough because the fuel-cell technology 
was small enough to fit in a compact car but there was still room 
to seat five passengers instead of just two. The fuel cells were 
stacked underneath the car's floorboard and the liquid hydrogen 
tank took up some space in its small trunk. 
</P>
<P>
	``It is the first time ever that such a car is on the streets of  
America,'' Schrempp said. 
</P>
<P>
	The car drives like a normal automobile, has a top speed of 90  
mph and can go 280 miles without refueling. It weighs 1,100 pounds 
more than a typical compact gasoline-powered car because of the 
fuel-cell technology. DaimlerChrysler engineers plan to make it 660 
pounds lighter before selling it to the public. 
</P>
<P>
	The NECAR 4 produces no pollutants in using fuel cells to  
convert hydrogen and oxygen into electricity to power the vehicle, 
DaimlerChrysler officials said, making it a favorite among 
environmentalists. 
</P>
<P>
	Environmental Protection Agency Administrator Carol Browner, who  
appeared with the DaimlerChrysler officials at their news 
conference, said there are about 200 million gasoline-powered 
vehicles on the road today in the United States. That number is 
expected to increase to 270 million by 2010, bringing a ``massive 
increase in pollution,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	Browner called fuel-cell vehicles ``a real step forward''  
because they ``leave a trail of water vapor, not clouds of carbon 
dioxide, nitrous oxide and other pollutants.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Fuel cells also are a favorite among automakers trying to comply  
with California's standard of zero emissions by 2003 for 10 percent 
of the cars sold in the state. But DaimlerChrysler co-chairman Bob 
Eaton insisted the company's fuel-cell vehicles would be available 
to consumers in 2004 ``not because we were forced to but because we 
wanted to.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Other automakers hoping to meet that deadline include Ford,  
General Motors Corp. and Honda Motor Co. Companies are putting 
hundreds of millions of dollars into developing the technology. 
</P>
<P>
	But the demise of gasoline-powered cars is not imminent. NECAR 4  
is powered by liquid hydrogen, an impractical fuel for mass 
marketing since it must be kept at extremely cold temperatures. 
</P>
<P>
	Eaton acknowledged there is still a lot of work to be done to  
decrease the cost and weight of fuel-cell cars. 
</P>
<P>
	A mass produced fuel-cell car would now cost about $30,000 for  
the fuel cell hardware alone. Today's engines cost $3,000 -- 
one-tenth as much. 
</P>
<P>
	DaimlerChrysler officials are working on NECAR X, which will run  
on methanol. Methanol contains hydrogen and is the auto industry's 
favored fuel to power fuel cells. However, methanol-fueled cars 
would require a national network of methanol pumping stations that 
do not now exist.

<HEADLINE> Holyfield Said To Have Been Sick </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ATLANTA (AP) -- Evander Holyfield's attorney says the heavyweight  
boxing champion had a stomach ache before his controversial 
unification fight with Lennox Lewis. 
</P>
<P>
	Attorney Jim Thomas said Tuesday that Holyfield was sweating  
during a routine stretching session two days before the fight and 
that the boxer told him his ``stomach doesn't feel right'' and his 
``legs were sticking'' in the locker room before Saturday night's 
bout in Madison Square Garden. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't want to sound like a guy who says, `Well, here's the  
excuse,''' Thomas said. ``There was something bothering him, and it 
probably affected his performance. I'm not saying he would've won. 
Who knows? But there was a problem. Everybody says, `Well, that 
could be old age.' The answer is, I don't know. I can't dismiss 
that possibility. But clearly Evander wasn't at his best, and I 
want to know why.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In a 12-round fight many thought Lewis clearly won, the judges  
called it a draw. 
</P>
<P>
	Thomas said he asked Holyfield why he didn't say something  
earlier, and Holyfield responded, ``I thought it would be a short 
fight, so it didn't matter.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Holyfield had predicted he would knock out Lewis in the third  
round. 
</P>
<P>
	Holyfield had a virus about three weeks before the fight, but  
said he had recovered. It's possible the virus returned, Thomas 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	The attorney said the fighter will submit a blood sample and  
have other tests, directed by his physician, Dr. Chris Vaughns. 
</P>
<P>
	Holyfield, who has returned to Atlanta, could not be reached for  
comment Tuesday night, The Atlanta Journal-Constitution said. 
</P>
<P>
	Thomas said Holyfield has watched a tape on the fight, but had  
no comment on the judges' decision. 
</P>
<P>
	``He really had no comment on the fight, other than to note that  
he was never hurt and never in trouble,'' Thomas said.

<HEADLINE> Lawyer Says Holyfield Was Ailing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ATLANTA (AP) -- Evander Holyfield was weakened by leg cramps and  
a stomachache before his title fight with Lennox Lewis, his lawyer 
said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	``No one's saying he would have beat Lennox Lewis to a pulp if  
he had been feeling better,'' attorney Jim Thomas said. ``That was 
the best he could do on that night.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Thomas said the 36-year-old fighter's aches and pains were not  
offered as an excuse for Holyfield's showing in the disputed draw 
Saturday night at Madison Square Garden 
</P>
<P>
	The outcome in the heavyweight unification bout left both  
fighters with their titles -- Holyfield with the WBA and IBF crown, 
Lewis with the WBC crown. 
</P>
<P>
	Thomas said Holyfield told him his stomach didn't ``feel right''  
and his legs were ``sticking'' in the locker room before the bout. 
Two days earlier, the lawyer added, Holyfield broke into a sweat 
while stretching. 
</P>
<P>
	Thomas said he asked Holyfield why he didn't say something  
earlier, and Holyfield responded, ``I thought it would be a short 
fight, so it didn't matter.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Holyfield had predicted he would knock out Lewis in the third  
round. 
</P>
<P>
	Thomas said Holyfield had a virus about three weeks before the  
fight, but Holyfield said he had recovered. 
</P>
<P>
	``Maybe it was hanging on,'' Thomas said.  
</P>
<P>
	In the next few days, Thomas said Holyfield planned to submit a  
blood sample and undergo other tests, directed by his physician, 
Dr. Chris Vaughns. 
</P>
<P>
	Thomas said Holyfield, who has returned to his suburban Atlanta  
home, has watched a tape on the fight but had no comment on the 
judges' decision. 
</P>
<P>
	``We reviewed it together,'' Thomas said. ``He really had no  
comment on the fight, other than to note that he was never hurt and 
never in trouble.'' 
</P>
<P>
	WBO heavyweight champion Herbie Hide offered Holyfield some  
advice: retire. 
</P>
<P>
	Hide, speaking from Norwich, England, on Wednesday, said  
Holyfield ``looked 36 going on 80.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``His legs are gone,'' he said.  
</P>
<P>
	But, Hyde added, ``I saw little wrong with the result -- Lewis  
missed his big chance.'' 
</P>
<P>
	If there is a rematch, and one has been ordered by the  
presidents of the WBA, WBC and IBF, Hyde wants to fight the winner. 
</P>
<P>
	Many thought Lewis clearly won, and the announcement of a draw  
drew boos from the sellout crowd. State and local officials in New 
York are investigating the bout. 
</P>
<P>
	John Morris, secretary of the British Boxing Board of Control,  
said he is astonished by the ``total hysteria'' surrounding the 
post-fight uproar. 
</P>
<P>
	``But there's no doubt the structure of world boxing needs and a  
complete and utter change,'' he said. ``Until we get some respected 
and neutral form of control of contests of this type, then we are 
going to continue to get problems.''

<HEADLINE> Tire Marks Key to Train Probe </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BOURBONNAIS, Ill. (AP) -- Investigators are analyzing tire tracks  
in the mud to determine whether the truck driver at the center of 
the deadly Amtrak crash had tried to go around the crossing gates 
and beat the train. 
</P>
<P>
	The crash between the tractor-trailer and Amtrak's City of New  
Orleans killed 11 people Monday night in the nation's deadliest 
train wreck in three years. 
</P>
<P>
	Tire marks were found on the road, on timbers at the crossing  
and in the mud along the shoulder of the road, said Bob Lauby, 
director of the National Transportation Safety Board's office of 
railroad safety. 
</P>
<P>
	``The tire marks may belong to the truck, they may not,'' Lauby  
said Wednesday. ``Put all these marks together and we should be 
able to recreate exactly where the truck was and how it negotiated 
that crossing.'' 
</P>
<P>
	On Tuesday, Wisconsin Gov. Tommy Thompson, Amtrak's chairman,  
said the train engineer had accused the truck driver of trying to 
go around the lowered crossing gates instead of waiting for the 
train to pass. 
</P>
<P>
	But John Goglia of the NTSB said the engineer had been too  
shaken Tuesday to provide a good account of what happened. 
Investigators talked to him again on Wednesday at the hospital. 
They would not comment on what was said. 
</P>
<P>
	Investigators staged a re-enactment of the crash at about 9:45  
p.m. -- almost the same time the fated City of New Orleans 
approached the crossing on Monday. This time, a single engine moved 
slowly down the tracks in darkness, sounding its whistle while 
crossing gates came down and warning lights flashed. A 
tractor-trailer carrying steel beams sat parked behind the gates. 
</P>
<P>
	NTSB officials hoped the re-enactment would help clarify what  
could be seen from the truck and the train in the crucial seconds 
before the collision. 
</P>
<P>
	The truck driver, John Stokes, who was driving on a probationary  
license after three speeding violations in Indiana, told 
investigators that he had already proceeded into the crossing when 
the gates came down. His rig was loaded with steel rods produced at 
a mill nearby. 
</P>
<P>
	Investigators planned to question Stokes again and use a truck  
and a locomotive to re-create the scene and determine whether the 
driver could have seen the train approaching at 79 mph. 
</P>
<P>
	Authorities said there was no indication that crossing gates had  
failed to work. The red signal light flashes for five seconds 
before the gates descend, each blocking one lane of the two-lane 
access road. The train comes through 26 seconds later. 
</P>
<P>
	Goglia said Stokes, who suffered only minor injuries in the  
crash, underwent a breath test for alcohol. ``All I know is that it 
didn't show he went over the limit,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	The onrushing twin locomotives swept the truck aside and smashed  
into two railroad cars on a siding. 
</P>
<P>
	When the locomotives stopped, many of the 14 cars hurtling along  
behind plowed into the engines, jackknifed and piled up in a heap 
of twisted metal. All of the victims were killed in a double-deck 
sleeper car that was ripped open and burned. 
</P>
<P>
	The initial count of those killed was 13. But Goglia revised  
that to 11 on Wednesday. NTSB spokesman Jamie Finch said two people 
walked away from the wreck after the accident and were assumed 
dead. 
</P>
<P>
	Finch also said all 216 people aboard the train had been  
accounted for. 
</P>
<P>
	Family members of those who died boarded two buses and were  
driven from their motel to the crash site, where they hugged, 
placed flowers on the ground and laid a wreath on a fence.

<HEADLINE> Feds Probe Amtrak Accident </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BOURBONNAIS, Ill. (AP) -- Federal investigators said today they  
are looking into whether the driver of a semitrailer drove around a 
crossing barrier in an attempt to beat an oncoming train, causing 
the nation's deadliest railroad accident in three years. 
</P>
<P>
	Officials with the National Transportation Safety Board said the  
driver, John Stokes, was just one part of the investigation into 
the wreck of the City of New Orleans, and that the train engineer 
and the warning system were also being examined. 
</P>
<P>
	At least 11 people were killed and more than 100 injured in  
Monday night's accident, federal officials said today, lowering the 
death toll from 13. 
</P>
<P>
	National Transportation Safety Board member John Goglia said the  
agency was frustrated with Amtrak's delays in getting accurate 
information about passengers to investigators. 
</P>
<P>
	Goglia also said investigators were going to wait until  
interviews today with the driver and the engineer before reaching 
any conclusions on the cause of the crash. 
</P>
<P>
	Amtrak's chairman, Wisconsin Gov. Tommy Thompson, said Tuesday  
that Stokes was trying to dodge the crossing gates, thinking the 
oncoming train was a slow-moving freight train instead of a faster 
passenger train. 
</P>
<P>
	``The engineer said he saw the lights flashing, he saw the  
barriers down and then he saw the truck stop and try to get around 
it,'' Thompson said. ``There was no way to avoid it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Stokes has said the barriers did not go down until he was on the  
tracks. 
</P>
<P>
	Tire marks were found on the road, the timber of the crossing,  
and on the road shoulder in the dirt, said Bob Lauby, director of 
the NTSB's office of railroad safety. 
</P>
<P>
	``The tire marks may belong to the truck, they may not,'' Lauby  
said today. ``Put all these marks together and we should be able to 
recreate exactly where the truck was and how it negotiated that 
crossing.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Investigators also planned to recreate the driver's approach to  
the crossing to see whether he could not see the train approaching, 
Goglia said today. 
</P>
<P>
	Authorities insist those gates were down and the signal lights  
were flashing red when the train slammed into a semitrailer loaded 
with steel. 
</P>
<P>
	Goglia said that because of difficulties in getting information  
from Amtrak, investigators were unsure of the numbers of passengers 
the train was carrying and whether anyone was still missing. 
</P>
<P>
	Earlier, authorities said the passenger train was carrying 217  
people when it crashed at a rural crossing 50 miles south of 
Chicago, and that at least three people were missing. 
</P>
<P>
	Stokes, 58, told investigators that he didn't see the train  
approach and that the warning lights started flashing after he 
started across the tracks near a Birmingham Steel Co. mill. 
</P>
<P>
	Stokes was driving on a probationary license after receiving  
three speeding tickets in a year, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
	Both Stokes and the engineer were questioned Tuesday, but  
investigators said the engineer was taking medication as a result 
of the crash and had trouble answering questions. 
</P>
<P>
	Goglia said that a breath test of the truck driver showed no  
sign of alcohol, but that investigators were still waiting on blood 
and urine tests. 
</P>
<P>
	The two-locomotive train pulling 14 cars smashed into the truck  
and then into two rail cars on a siding. The cars jackknifed and 
piled up behind the locomotives over a quarter-mile, with leaking 
diesel fuel erupting in flames. 
</P>
<P>
	Those killed were in a double-decker sleeping car. Authorities  
said a locomotive ripped into the car, crushing some passengers and 
setting the car ablaze. 
</P>
<P>
	Goglia, who is in charge of the NTSB investigation, said the  
black box in the lead locomotive showed the train was moving at 79 
mph -- the legal maximum -- just before the crash. He also said the 
engineer was blowing his whistle and trying to stop the train. 
</P>
<P>
	A private study released last month found that more than 80  
percent of the nation's railroad crossings -- about 130,000 -- lack 
gates and light signals to warn pedestrians and motorists of 
trains. 
</P>
<P>
	But near the Bourbonnais crash site, two gates block the narrow  
two-lane road, which provides access to the nearby mill. The gates 
and lights at the crossing appear to have been functioning at the 
time of the crash, said David Farrell, a spokesman for the Illinois 
Commerce Commission. 
</P>
<P>
	Mike Stead, head of rail safety at the ICC, said the gates were  
intact, and authorities have not been able to verify where the 
truck was at the time of impact or when the gates were lowered. 
</P>
<P>
	Sensors turn on the lights and bells 26 seconds before a train  
reaches the crossing, and five seconds later the gates come down, 
Farrell said. Officials said the gates did not malfunction and were 
last inspected Feb. 24. 
</P>
<P>
	There have been three deaths at the crossing in the last 35  
years, in 1964, 1968 and 1988. Forty trains and 1,800 vehicles use 
the crossing daily. 
</P>
<P>
	NTSB officials said they would also investigate whether a rail  
car on a siding north of the crash site may have blocked the truck 
driver's view. 
</P>
<P>
	Authorities have not released the names of the victims. The  
Commercial Appeal in Memphis reported Wednesday the dead included a 
woman and three children from Mississippi, who were returning from 
a doll show in Chicago. 
</P>
<P>
	They were identified as June Bonnin, 47 and her 12-year-old  
granddaughter, Jessica Whitaker, both of Nesbitt, Miss.; and Rainy 
Lipscomb, 10, and Lacey Lipscomb, 8, of Lake Cormorant, Miss. 
Another girl, Bonin's daughter, was reported injured. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was to be a dream trip for the little girls,'' said  
Bonnin's husband, Max. ``It turned out to be a nightmare.''

<HEADLINE> Juror Testifies in McDougal Case </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LITTLE ROCK, Ark. (AP) -- In an unusual move by the prosecution,  
a Whitewater grand juror took the witness stand today in Susan 
McDougal's trial and said she never felt Kenneth Starr's 
prosecutors were out to get President Clinton or the first lady. 
</P>
<P>
	It is rare that grand jurors, who meet in secrecy to weigh  
whether to bring criminal charges, are called as witnesses or even 
named publicly. 
</P>
<P>
	But prosecutors said in this case, the grand jury is considered  
the victim of the alleged crime -- Mrs. McDougal's refusal to answer 
questions during the grand jury's investigation. Mrs. McDougal has 
complained she was mistreated by prosecutors eager to get the 
Clintons. 
</P>
<P>
	The witness, Jennifer Castleberry of Mayflower, a small town 20  
miles north of Little Rock, served on the grand jury investigating 
the Clintons' Whitewater business dealings from May 1996 to 
September 1997. She was present on one of the occasions when Mrs. 
McDougal refused to testify. 
</P>
<P>
	``She wouldn't talk,'' Mrs. Castleberry testified. ``She wanted  
to give a statement. She would not allow us to read the statement. 
She refused to answer the questions.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Castleberry said the grand jurors met for about 15 or 20  
minutes, out of the presence of Mrs. McDougal or the prosecutors, 
to consider whether to let her read the statement. They decided to 
deny the request. 
</P>
<P>
	The grand jurors wanted to hear Mrs. McDougal testify because of  
her role as part owner of the Whitewater land development and the 
failed savings and loan at the heart of the case, Mrs. Castleberry 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	``We wanted to hear what she had to say,'' said Mrs.  
Castleberry, who spoke in a voice so soft that people in the 
courtroom strained to hear it. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. McDougal was questioned by Ray Jahn, a Starr prosecutor who  
earlier had won four felony convictions against her for receiving a 
fraudulent $300,000 federally backed loan. 
</P>
<P>
	The grand juror said Jahn's demeanor during the questioning was  
``pleasant'' and he used a ``normal tone of voice that he uses with 
all the witnesses.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Were you out to get the Clintons?'' prosecutor Julie Myers  
asked the grand juror. 
</P>
<P>
	``No,'' she replied.  
</P>
<P>
	Myers also asked whether Starr's office was out to get the  
Clintons, or out to get anyone else. Mrs. Castleberry answered each 
question, ``no.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``They wanted to give us the facts to determine whether any  
crimes were committed,'' she said. Under questioning, it was clear 
that she was familiar with the details of the complicated 
Whitewater loans and business deal. 
</P>
<P>
	Kenneth Starr's prosecutors are wrapping up their case against  
Mrs. McDougal. 
</P>
<P>
	They showed a videotape Tuesday of first lady Hillary Rodham  
Clinton's grand jury testimony in the case. 
</P>
<P>
	Two days after Mrs. McDougal's refusal to respond in a 1998  
grand jury appearance, Mrs. Clinton answered some of the same 
questions, declaring in videotaped testimony that she has no 
knowledge of a $27,600 Whitewater loan in her husband's name and is 
unaware of how it was paid off. 
</P>
<P>
	The centerpiece of the Susan McDougal trial, the $27,600  
cashier's check made out to ``Bill Clinton,'' is linked through a 
series of transactions to a fraudulent $300,000 loan to Mrs. 
McDougal. 
</P>
<P>
	``I have never seen these documents before and have no  
information about them,'' Mrs. Clinton said of the Clinton loan in 
a 40-minute segment of a videotaped deposition from 1998 that was 
played Tuesday for the jury in Mrs. McDougal's trial. 
</P>
<P>
	The first lady testified that she ``never spent any significant  
time at all'' monitoring the records of the Whitewater real estate 
venture. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Clinton also said she didn't know anything about a  
$5,081.82 check signed by Mrs. McDougal and bearing the notation 
``payoff Clinton.'' The check was used to make a payment on the 
$27,600 Clinton loan, the prosecution says. 
</P>
<P>
	Starr's office may finally get a chance to hear Mrs. McDougal --  
charged with criminal contempt and obstruction -- answer questions. 
</P>
<P>
	Her lawyer, Mark Geragos, said his client probably will take the  
stand next week. Geragos said he may call about five witnesses. He 
would not say whether they would include former White House intern 
Monica Lewinsky or Julie Hiatt Steele. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton testified at the McDougals' trial in the spring of 1996  
that he had never borrowed money from the savings and loan the 
McDougals owned in the 1980s. Three months later, James McDougal, 
Mrs. McDougal's former husband, steered Starr's office to the 
previously unknown Clinton loan. James McDougal died last year.

<HEADLINE>  DaimlerChrysler Unveils New Car </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- DaimlerChrysler AG stepped forward Wednesday  
in the competition among automakers to develop fuel-cell cars with 
a version that seats five passengers. 
</P>
<P>
	``Now we begin the race to make the vehicles affordable to our  
customers,'' DaimlerChrysler co-chairman Juergen Schrempp said at a 
press conference where the NECAR 4, a compact car, was formally 
unveiled. 
</P>
<P>
	Although DaimlerChrysler claims to lead in such technology,  
other companies are working on their own fuel-cell cars, aiming to 
market them to consumers by 2004. Ford Motor Co. officials said 
they expect to have a driveable version of their five-seat 
fuel-cell car, the P2000, sometime this spring. 
</P>
<P>
	Ferdinand Panik, head of DaimlerChrysler's fuel-cell program,  
said NECAR 4 was a breakthrough because the fuel-cell technology 
was small enough to fit in a compact car but there was still room 
to seat five passengers instead of just two. The fuel cells were 
stacked underneath the car's floorboard and the liquid hydrogen 
tank took up some space in its small trunk. 
</P>
<P>
	``It is the first time ever that such a car is on the streets of  
America,'' Schrempp said. 
</P>
<P>
	The car drives like a normal automobile, has a top speed of 90  
mph and can go 280 miles without refueling. It weighs 1,100 pounds 
more than a typical compact gasoline-powered car because of the 
fuel-cell technology. DaimlerChrysler engineers plan to make it 660 
pounds lighter before selling it to the public. 
</P>
<P>
	The NECAR 4 produces no pollutants in using fuel cells to  
convert hydrogen and oxygen into electricity to power the vehicle, 
DaimlerChrysler officials said, making it a favorite among 
environmentalists. 
</P>
<P>
	Environmental Protection Agency Administrator Carol Browner, who  
appeared with the DaimlerChrysler officials at their news 
conference, said there are about 200 million gasoline-powered 
vehicles on the road today in the United States. That number is 
expected to increase to 270 million by 2010, bringing a ``massive 
increase in pollution,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	Browner called fuel-cell vehicles ``a real step forward''  
because they ``leave a trail of water vapor, not clouds of carbon 
dioxide, nitrous oxide and other pollutants.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Fuel cells also are a favorite among automakers trying to comply  
with California's standard of zero emissions by 2003 for 10 percent 
of the cars sold in the state. But DaimlerChrysler co-chairman Bob 
Eaton insisted the company's fuel-cell vehicles would be available 
to consumers in 2004 ``not because we were forced to but because we 
wanted to.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Other automakers hoping to meet that deadline include Ford,  
General Motors Corp. and Honda Motor Co. Companies are putting 
hundreds of millions of dollars into developing the technology. 
</P>
<P>
	But the demise of gasoline-powered cars is not imminent. NECAR 4  
is powered by liquid hydrogen, an impractical fuel for mass 
marketing since it must be kept at extremely cold temperatures. 
</P>
<P>
	Eaton acknowledged there is still a lot of work to be done to  
decrease the cost and weight of fuel-cell cars. 
</P>
<P>
	A mass produced fuel-cell car would now cost about $30,000 for  
the fuel cell hardware alone. Today's engines cost $3,000 -- 
one-tenth as much. 
</P>
<P>
	DaimlerChrysler officials are working on NECAR X, which will run  
on methanol. Methanol contains hydrogen and is the auto industry's 
favored fuel to power fuel cells. However, methanol-fueled cars 
would require a national network of methanol pumping stations that 
do not now exist.

<HEADLINE> Reps. Push for Fire-Safe Cigarette </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Democratic lawmakers have revived a 20-year  
campaign to develop a federal standard for a cigarette that is 
easily extinguished to lessen the chances it will start a fire. 
</P>
<P>
	Previous efforts have failed, blocked by opposition from the  
tobacco industry. 
</P>
<P>
	Rep. Joe Moakley, D-Mass., a leader of the drive in Congress,  
said Tuesday he hopes the vocal support of firefighters from across 
the country will persuade more lawmakers to support the 
legislation. 
</P>
<P>
	``There is nothing more tragic than an innocent child killed or  
burned in a fire,'' said Moakley. 
</P>
<P>
	He became involved with the problem after a carelessly discarded  
cigarette caused a fire in 1979 that killed a family of seven in 
Westwood, Mass. 
</P>
<P>
	Moakley's bill, which has drawn mostly Democratic support so  
far, would give the Consumer Product Safety Commission 18 months to 
issue a fire-safety standard for cigarettes. Tobacco companies 
would have a year to comply. 
</P>
<P>
	Sen. Dick Durbin, D-Ill., is introducing the bill in the Senate.  
</P>
<P>
	Government scientists have said it is commercially and  
technically feasible to design cigarettes less likely to start 
fires. 
</P>
<P>
	``We can do the job,'' said Ann Brown, chairwoman of the  
commission, which supports the bill. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1996, cigarette-ignited residential fires caused 1,140  
deaths, 2,570 injuries and $326 million in property damage across 
the country, according to safety commission data. Every year, more 
than 80 children die from residential fires involving cigarettes, 
Brown said. 
</P>
<P>
	Fire-safe cigarettes, as they are called, would go out by  
themselves instead of smoldering if dropped or left unattended. 
Such cigarettes may have filter tips, less-porous paper, more 
expanded tobacco and a smaller diameter. 
</P>
<P>
	About half a dozen cigarettes already on the market would meet  
such a standard, Moakley said. It would cost the government about 
$3 million to implement the new standard. 
</P>
<P>
	The legislation is supported by numerous fire safety groups,  
including the National Fire Protection Association, International 
Association of Fire Chiefs and International Association of Fire 
Fighters. 
</P>
<P>
	``It would make our job easier,'' said Mike Mullane, a 30-year  
Boston firefighter and vice president of the firefighters 
association's New England branch. ``A lot of the fires would be cut 
out if this cigarette came onto the market.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The bill's Republican co-sponsors include Reps. Connie Morella  
of Maryland and Sherwood Boehlert of New York.

<HEADLINE> Orioles Trip to Cuba Is Protested </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	FORT LAUDERDALE, Fla. (AP) -- Wearing the black and orange of his  
favorite major-league team, the Baltimore Orioles, Miami resident 
Felix Tirse begged the Orioles not to play a March 28 exhibition 
game against the Cuban national team in Havana. 
</P>
<P>
	``If they win against Fidel's team, the Orioles are  
professionals and the (Cubans) are amateurs,'' said Tirse, 
referring to Cuban leader Fidel Castro. ``If the Cubans win, it's 
only a victory for Castro. Castro uses everybody, even baseball 
players. ... It's immoral.'' 
</P>
<P>
	About 125 people -- many of them Cubans now living in south  
Florida -- protested against the Orioles' trip outside Fort 
Lauderdale Stadium before a Wednesday night exhibition game between 
Baltimore and the Florida Marlins. 
</P>
<P>
	They carried Cuban and American flags, waved placards denouncing  
Castro as a tyrant, chanted for liberty for the Cuban people and 
handed out fliers decrying the Orioles' decision to play a 
home-and-home series with the Cuban team. Baltimore will play host 
to a Cuban team at Camden Yards on May 3. 
</P>
<P>
	In the third inning of Wednesday's game, a man was led away by  
police after running onto the field, bearing a Cuban flag. Police 
also led away a woman who had been screaming at players in the 
Orioles dugout, pleading with them not to go to Havana. 
</P>
<P>
	It was the second protest at the Orioles' spring training base.  
About 40 people protested before the Orioles' home exhibition 
opener on March 7. 
</P>
<P>
	Olivia Varona of Miami bristled when asked why she was so upset  
over a baseball game. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's politics, not baseball,'' she said. ``Everything that  
comes from Cuba is political. ... I don't understand why the State 
Department could allow this.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Laura Vianello, a member of a Miami-based Cuban rights group  
called Vigilia Mambisa, admitted there was little chance of 
convincing the Orioles to cancel the game. 
</P>
<P>
	The Orioles, she said, contend that baseball is a key to a more  
open cultural exchange. ``That's a political statement. That's 
politics. Can't they see that?'' she asked. 
</P>
<P>
	Joe Foss, the Orioles' vice chairman for business and finance,  
acknowledged the sentiments of protesters. 
</P>
<P>
	``We support their right to protest. It's our hope that this  
exchange can help people in the two countries come together. What 
occurs in political change is not our responsibility and is not our 
motivation,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	So far, only one Oriole, starting pitcher Juan Guzman, has  
decided not to accompany the team to Cuba. Guzman, a native of the 
Dominican Republic, lives in a Miami neighborhood populated by 
Cubans. He has said he hasn't been pressured by his Cuban friends 
and neighbors.

<HEADLINE> Ex-Jockey Ordered Held in Holdup </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	EL MONTE, Calif. (AP) -- Patrick Valenzuela, who rode Sunday  
Silence to victories in the Kentucky Derby and Preakness, was 
scheduled for arraignment on a robbery charge Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Accused of robbing a cab driver of $150 at gunpoint on Feb. 25,  
Valenzuela faces one count of robbery with the allegation that he 
personally used a handgun in the crime. His bail was reduced from 
$75,000 to $40,000 Wednesday but was not posted. 
</P>
<P>
	Superior Court Judge Francis Gately, who conducted a preliminary  
hearing in which the cab driver testified, ordered Valenzuela to 
appear for arraignment March 31. 
</P>
<P>
	Valenzuela, 36, of El Monte, was arrested by Los Angeles County  
sheriff's deputies Feb. 27 for the alleged robbery in Rosemead, 
about 10 miles east of Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
	If convicted, he faces a maximum of 16 years in prison -- six for  
the robbery and 10 for the handgun-use allegation, Deputy District 
Attorney Leonard J. Torrealba said. 
</P>
<P>
	Valenzuela was arrested in October 1997 for investigation of  
spousal abuse on his third wife. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1989, he tested positive for cocaine. The following year, he  
was suspended for six months by the California Horse Racing Board 
for refusing to take a drug test. He also underwent substance abuse 
rehabilitation as a condition of returning to racing in 1991. 
</P>
<P>
	Valenzuela was the leading apprentice jockey at Santa Anita's  
1979-80 meeting with 83 wins, third among all jockeys that season. 
He twice rode winners of the Santa Anita Derby and Santa Anita 
Handicap, and was among the top jockeys in victories on Southern 
California tracks through 1995.

<HEADLINE> Michigan Students Hold Sit-In </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ANN ARBOR, Mich. (AP) -- University of Michigan students sat  
outside the school president's office, demanding a meeting to 
discuss working conditions at factories that make 
university-licensed apparel. 
</P>
<P>
	Members of Students Organizing for Labor and Economic Equality  
say they want to make sure the factories aren't operating under 
sweatshop conditions. President Lee Bollinger was not in his office 
Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Students planned to spend the night in the building and resume  
their protest today. The protest follows similar demonstrations at 
other campuses across the country. 
</P>
<P>
	Michigan is among the top-selling schools for the Atlanta-based  
Collegiate Licensing Co., which licenses products for more than 170 
colleges. 
</P>
<P>
	A key student demand is that manufacturers reveal the locations  
of the factories that make licensed apparel to make check on pay, 
safety and workers' ages. 
</P>
<P>
	Last week, University of Michigan students and administrators  
agreed to require licensees to disclose locations of their 
factories, joining the University of Wisconsin. 
</P>
<P>
	The protest follows similar demonstrations at Wisconsin, Duke,  
Princeton, Yale and other campuses. Organizers say they want to 
make sure that workers who make licensed apparel for universities 
have humane working conditions. 
</P>
<P>
	Collegiate Licensing does not always know where the  
manufacturers or their subcontractors make the goods, or how

<HEADLINE> Paul Allen May Sell Some Stock </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Microsoft co-founder Paul Allen may sell $2  
billion to $3 billion worth of stock in his cable company, Charter 
Communications Inc., through an initial public offering. 
</P>
<P>
	Charter, the nation's seventh-largest cable company, could  
launch the IPO in the second half of the year if market conditions 
are good, spokeswoman Anita Lamont said today. 
</P>
<P>
	The sale would be the largest ever in the cable industry and  
could rank among the richest of any kind. 
</P>
<P>
	The proceeds would be used to fund more acquisitions by Charter,  
which has been expanding rapidly as part of Allen's plan to 
assemble a ``wired world'' portfolio of entertainment and 
technology businesses. 
</P>
<P>
	Allen, who also owns football's Seattle Seahawks and  
basketball's Portland Trail Blazers, has been amassing cable 
holdings with the hopes that demand will increase for high-speed 
Internet access and phone services over cable lines, which have 
much greater capacity than phone lines. 
</P>
<P>
	St. Louis-based Charter has five pending acquisitions that are  
due to close by late summer, giving the company 3.4 million 
subscribers, mainly in the Northeast, South and West. Charter's 
first cable purchase was a $2.8 takeover last year of Marcus Cable 
Co., then the nation's largest privately held cable operator. 
</P>
<P>
	The IPO plans, first reported in today's edition of USA Today,  
come with investors bidding up cable TV stocks on hopes that cable 
lines will be used for more than just television services in the 
future.

<HEADLINE> Delay Sought in 2nd Cable Car Trial </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CAMP LEJEUNE, N.C. (AP) -- Defense attorneys for a Marine aviator  
involved in a deadly Italian ski gondola accident have asked a 
military judge to delay his court-martial on obstruction of justice 
charges. 
</P>
<P>
	Capt. Joseph Schweitzer, 31, of Westbury, N.Y., is seeking a  
week's delay in his court-martial, which is scheduled to begin 
Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	Schweitzer is charged with obstruction of justice and conspiracy  
to obstruct justice in the mishap Feb. 3, 1998, when an EA-6B 
Prowler jet cut a ski gondola cable, sending 20 people to their 
deaths. 
</P>
<P>
	Schweitzer, the navigator of the Prowler, originally faced  
involuntary manslaughter and negligent homicide charges. Those 
charges were dropped after a Marine jury acquitted the jet's pilot, 
Capt. Richard Ashby, of involuntary manslaughter earlier this 
month. 
</P>
<P>
	Ashby also faces obstruction charges, which involve a missing  
videotape he said Schweitzer shot during the low-level training 
flight in the Italian Alps. 
</P>
<P>
	``Now, we're facing charges of obstruction when there was no  
underlying offense to obstruct,'' said Dave Beck, a lawyer 
representing Schweitzer. 
</P>
<P>
	Beck said he wants time for additional discovery to try to back  
up his contention that President Clinton's comments after Ashby's 
acquittal may have influenced the Marine Corps' decision to try 
Schweitzer on obstruction charges. 
</P>
<P>
	The day after Ashby, 31, of Mission Viejo, Calif., was  
acquitted, Clinton met at the Oval Office with Italian Prime 
Minister Massimo D'Alema. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton said Americans were ``profoundly regretful and  
apologetic for what has occurred to the families and all of the 
people of Italy.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Beck contends the White House meeting may have influenced the  
Marine Corps' decision to prosecute his client. 
</P>
<P>
	Prosecutors argued that the defense was stalling for no good  
reason. 
</P>
<P>
	``It is clearly a red herring for them to have a continuance  
when they should be ready,'' said Lt. Col. Carol Joyce, one of the 
prosecutors.

<HEADLINE> Northwest Faces Flood Dangers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Red River of the North, which produced  
devastating floods two years ago, is again the main focus of 
concern as spring flood season approaches. And federal forecasters 
say deep snowpacks in Idaho and the Pacific Northwest could pose a 
threat there also. 
</P>
<P>
	``Floods will occur this year in this nation,'' John J. Kelly,  
director of the National Weather Service, said Wednesday. ``Now is 
the time to be thinking about what to do when the warning comes.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Each year, floods kill 100 to 140 Americans and do an average of  
$4.5 billion in damage, Kelly said, accounting for three-quarters 
of presidential disaster declarations. 
</P>
<P>
	The area of greatest flooding potential is along the Red River  
in North Dakota, which suffered record floods in 1997, and Devil's 
Lake, N.D., said Frank Richards, head of the Weather Service's 
Hydrologic Information Center. 
</P>
<P>
	But, he added, the maximum expected crest is well short of the  
level reached two years ago and the primary threat is from Grand 
Forks north. 
</P>
<P>
	``There is greater than average potential this spring for  
flooding in Oregon and Washington east of the Cascades due to snow 
melt,'' as well as in Idaho and adjacent streams in Oregon and 
Montana, Richards said. 
</P>
<P>
	In contrast, he said, ``Dryer than average conditions this  
spring may result in water concerns for Southern California, 
Arizona, New Mexico, southern Utah, western Texas and Hawaii.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Most of the nation will see conditions typical of an average  
spring, Richards said. 
</P>
<P>
	However, Kelly urged people not to be complacent.  
</P>
<P>
	``Every spring, short-lived downbursts cause flash floods,'' he  
said. ``This type of rapid onset, localized flooding can even 
strike areas that are considered extremely dry.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``The nation's spring flood potential is consistent with a La  
Nina pattern,'' said Richards. La Nina, the climatic opposite of El 
Nino, is characterized by cooler than normal sea-surface 
temperatures in the tropical Pacific Ocean that impact global 
weather patterns. 
</P>
<P>
	Kelly said the weather service has improved its flood warnings  
to an average of 54 minutes, even longer in some areas, but he 
noted: ``Our warnings mean nothing if they are not received or if 
people don't take appropriate action.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Weather Service's annual spring flood forecast also  
reported: 
</P>
<P>
	--Slightly higher than normal flood potential in northern New  
England, where substantial snow cover is combined with higher than 
normal streamflows and wet soils in parts of Maine, New Hampshire 
and Vermont. 
</P>
<P>
	--Moist soil conditions in Kentucky and southern Indiana  
susceptible to flooding in the event of moderate or heavy rains. 
</P>
<P>
	--Very wet conditions in western Washington and Oregon may be of  
some concern over the next several weeks, though the main threat is 
east of the Cascades. 
</P>
<P>
	--Growing indications that flooding may be possible in the  
Klamath Basin of Oregon and California, but it is too early to draw 
firm conclusions. 
</P>
<P>
	--Localized areas on the east slopes of the Sierra Nevada in  
Nevada and California may have flood potential depending on the 
pattern of warming and amount of rainfall.

<HEADLINE> Forbes Learns Lesson About Web </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Announcing his presidential campaign on the  
Internet, Steve Forbes promised to be ``first, fast and 
unfiltered.'' But in the lightning-quick world of cyberspace, he 
had already been beaten to his own name. 
</P>
<P>
	As Forbes was gearing up for a second presidential run in 1997,  
he neglected a step that is fast becoming mandatory for candidates: 
securing World Wide Web sites. 
</P>
<P>
	Two graduate students in Arizona stepped in and reserved the  
name ``www.Forbes2000.com,'' and the publisher had to come calling 
with offers to buy back his own name. The Forbes campaign did just 
that, concluding a deal recently to buy the rights. 
</P>
<P>
	Rick Segal, a Cincinnati-based Internet marketer who represented  
the Forbes campaign, said he purchased rights to three web sites -- 
including ``www.Forbes2000.com'' -- for a total of $6,500. He said 
the price was ``extremely reasonable.'' 
</P>
<P>
	One of the former students, Greg Trangmoe, said the agreement  
with Forbes prevents him from revealing how much money was paid.	   ``It was a good investment,'' he said, ``definitely a good 
investment.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The practice of ``cyber-squatting'' -- reserving names that  
others might need -- is going strong in politics. The speculation is 
fairly low-risk, since rights to a ``domain name'' are available 
for $70 for two years. The Forbes case shows there is money to be 
made. 
</P>
<P>
	And even technologically savvy politicians are prone to make a  
www.mistake. 
</P>
<P>
	Vice President Al Gore is a technophile who drew chuckles last  
week by claiming he ``took the initiative in creating the 
Internet.'' He's been a likely candidate for president in 2000 for 
years. 
</P>
<P>
	Yet he lost the race to ``www.Gore2000.com'' to Market Vision  
Inc. of Kansas City, Mo., which uses the site to sell political 
memorabilia, including the ``Gore 2000 Election Kit'' -- a bumper 
sticker and six buttons for $20. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're starting to get a lot of e-mail. People think this is  
his official site,'' said owner Sharon Clemons. She described 
herself as a fan of Gore who ``would never put anything negative 
about him on the site.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The prospective candidate best prepared for the Internet seems  
to be Texas Gov. George W. Bush, whose exploratory committee 
controls ``www.Bush2000.com'' as well as ``www.GeorgeWBush.com.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Republican Elizabeth Dole is trying to attract support with  
``www.EDole2000.org'' but does not have control over 
``www.Dole2000.com.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Trangmoe and Brian Keys, partners in Adega LLC, are auctioning  
off several other domain names. 
</P>
<P>
	They are asking $4,000 for ``www.Alexander2000.org,'' even  
though Republican Lamar Alexander is already on the Web at 
``www.LamarAlexander.com.'' 
</P>
<P>
	They are asking $1,000 for ``www.Bradley2000.org,'' although  
Democrat Bill Bradley already has a site up and running at 
``www.BillBradley.com.'' 
</P>
<P>
	And they are testing the market to see how high the bids might  
be on ``www.McCain2000.com,'' a site that could come in handy for 
Republican Sen. John McCain of Arizona. 
</P>
<P>
	There is some risk in having a Web site fall into hostile hands.  
Adega underscored the threat for a time last year by linking the 
``www.Forbes2000.com'' page to three other sites -- one of them 
pro-Forbes, the other two anti-Forbes. 
</P>
<P>
	As she considers whether to run for Senate in New York, first  
lady Hillary Rodham Clinton might be unsettled to learn that 
``www.Hillary2000.com'' is in the hands of a Republican. But Chris 
Hayden, a California environmental consultant, says he reserved the 
site in hopes of making money rather than trouble. 
</P>
<P>
	``We'd use it to try to sell items, as opposed to say anything  
bad about her or good about her,'' said Hayden, who added he would 
entertain offers from a Hillary Clinton campaign interested in 
buying the site. 
</P>
<P>
	New Jersey Gov. Christie Whitman, also mulling a bid for Senate,  
probably would prefer that ``www.Whitman2000.com'' be controlled by 
someone other than Dan Parisi, a New Jersey computer entrepreneur 
known for establishing a raunchy pay site at a Web address similar 
to the official one for the White House. 
</P>
<P>
	But Parisi said he voted for Whitman and would let her use the  
site if she wants it. 
</P>
<P>
	It might be too late for candidates to learn their lesson for  
2004, because cyber-squatters tend to think ahead. 
</P>
<P>
	``Two-thousand-four is gone,'' Trangmoe said. ``Unless you're  
somebody not expected to run, it's pretty much too late.''

<HEADLINE> Shipping Rates Climb From Asia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- U.S. importers trying to bring goods from  
Teletubbies to televisions from Asia in time for the Christmas 
shopping season may have a tough time finding space on ships, and 
those who do will pay a lot more to get their goods into cargo 
holds. 
</P>
<P>
	Major ocean carriers are planning big rate increases, even as  
the Federal Maritime Commission investigates allegations that 
predatory pricing and collaboration has virtually killed 
competition among major steamship lines that ply Pacific trade 
routes. 
</P>
<P>
	``Competition has been all but eliminated in the eastbound  
transpacific trades and there is no sign that it is likely to rear 
its head anytime in the near future,'' commission investigators 
said in a report. 
</P>
<P>
	The rate increase will apply across the broad range of goods  
that are shipped to the United States from Asia -- from TVs and 
computer equipment to clothing and popular toys like Barbie dolls 
and Teletubbies. 
</P>
<P>
	Consumers, however, will feel little if any pinch, analysts  
said. 
</P>
<P>
	``Freight is a minor component of the total cost structure,''  
said Kurt Barnard, president of Barnard's Retail Trend Report. 
</P>
<P>
	Even if it is passed on to consumers, the rate increase, as much  
as 30 percent or more on the cost of a 40-foot container, will have 
little impact on expensive goods like electronics. 
</P>
<P>
	Items with a low per-unit cost, like cheap plastic toys, would  
go up 7 percent to 8 percent at the retail level. 
</P>
<P>
	Teletubbies could cost 3 percent to 5 percent more, said Peter  
Woo, president of Megatoys, a $30 million-per-year wholesaler that 
sells to Wal-Mart Stores, Target and Toys R Us. 
</P>
<P>
	Smaller retailers and wholesale importers are most likely to  
suffer both from the price increase and the expected shortage of 
space on cargo ships. Large companies are better able to absorb the 
rate hike. 
</P>
<P>
	``We anticipated the likelihood of an increase at this time and  
that's been built into our strategic plan,'' said Jan Drummond, 
spokeswoman for Sears, Roebuck &AMP; Co. ``That's not to say we're 
happy about it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Discount giant Wal-Mart also will hold prices in check,  
spokeswoman Melissa Brown said. 
</P>
<P>
	Shipping rates are being raised by carriers belonging to the  
Transpacific Stabilization Agreement, a federally sanctioned group 
that includes 14 U.S., Asian and European steamship lines. 
Beginning May 1, carriers will raise the rate for a 40-foot cargo 
container $900. Rates typically run from $2,500 to $4,000. 
</P>
<P>
	An additional $300 surcharge will apply to containers shipped  
June 1 to Nov. 30, when the bulk of Christmas merchandise moves. 
</P>
<P>
	Carriers need the money to offset sharp rate declines of the  
past two years, said Niels Erich, a spokesman for the carriers' 
group. 
</P>
<P>
	Carriers also have been hurt by a severe trade imbalance created  
by the Asian economic crisis. Ships arrive at U.S. ports crammed 
with cargo, but return to Asia mostly empty. Unable to make money 
on both ends, carriers have seen their profit margins cut to 1 
percent or less, Erich said. 
</P>
<P>
	Because many ships return empty, the trade imbalance also has  
created a critical shortage of cargo containers in Asia. In a 
report issued last week, Maritime Commission investigators 
concluded that some carriers took advantage of the shortage by 
raising rates on eastbound cargo. In some cases, carriers broke 
contracts and sold scarce container space to the highest bidder, 
the report alleged. Citing carrier documents taken by 
investigators, the report contends that carriers may have 
collaborated on the unscheduled price hikes to ``wring as much 
money as we can from this situation.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``There was serious gouging last year,'' said Woo, whose company  
imports nearly all of its toys from Asia, and who lost money during 
the crunch. 
</P>
<P>
	The Maritime Commission is pursuing enforcement against certain  
carriers that could range from monetary penalties to civil 
proceedings, said Bryant L. VanBrakle, the commission's spokesman. 
</P>
<P>
	VanBrakle declined to name the carriers involved. Erich also  
refused to discuss specific carriers. 
</P>
<P>
	Carriers were waiting for the commission to identify the targets  
of its investigation. 
</P>
<P>
	``We believe that we have engaged in commercially and legally  
acceptable practices,'' said John Pachtner, spokesman for American 
Presidents Line, a member of the carriers' group member. He 
declined further comment. 
</P>
<P>
	In the meantime, small importers were bracing for a season of  
high prices and scarce space. 
</P>
<P>
	Lewis Shumate, whose Knoxville, Tenn., Furniture Design company  
manufactures wooden chairs in Indonesia, said the rate increase 
will force him to raise prices about 2 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	``It creates a problem. That much of an increase means I'm  
probably going to lose some of my customers in Europe or Mexico,'' 
he said.

<HEADLINE> Landmark D.C. Cafeteria May Close </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- They come for plates of liver and onions and  
pieces of rhubarb pie. They come, sometimes by the busload, for 
roast beef or man-sized slabs of meatloaf. They come, as they have 
since 1928, for little bowls of mashed potatoes with puddles of 
dark brown gravy. 
</P>
<P>
	Sholl's Colonial Cafeteria, a landmark in Washington, has been  
serving up no-frills American food for years to school groups and 
tourists from across the land. On Monday, it observed its 71st -- 
and perhaps last -- anniversary. 
</P>
<P>
	The cafeteria's rent is going up faster than its profits. And  
despite a ``Save Our Sholl's Committee,'' praise from first lady 
Hillary Rodham Clinton, who calls it an ``warm and welcoming 
organization,'' a T-shirt campaign and good wishes from longtime 
customers, the cafeteria could soon serve its last bowl of tapioca. 
</P>
<P>
	Hermine Keathley, 82, a retired secretary who once worked at the  
French embassy, met her husband at Sholl's in 1946. They eyed one 
another while dining. He left, but waited outside, where he 
formally introduced himself. ``I can't live without Sholl's,'' says 
Mrs. Keathley, who is now a widow. ``I come for pea soup on 
Tuesday. They have to stay in business.'' 
</P>
<P>
	If Sholl's can't negotiate a lower rent, then it will go out of  
business by summer, says co-owner George Fleishell, 71, nephew of 
founder Evan Sholl. Fleishell owns the struggling business with 
Delmo Barbieri, 55, who started as a dishwasher at Sholl's when he 
immigrated from Italy in 1962. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've spent more than half my life here,'' Barbieri says. ``I  
guess all good things come to an end.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Since 1928, there have been Sholl's cafeterias at about a dozen  
locations in Washington. 
</P>
<P>
	The plainspoken Harry S. Truman ate at Sholl's when he was vice  
president. George Wallace dined there when he ran for president in 
1972. Former President Carter stopped in on a visit to Washington. 
Art Buchwald has eaten at the cafeteria. Sen. Max Cleland, D-Ga., 
has been a regular since the 1960s. Veteran White House 
correspondent Sarah McClendon, 88, started dining at Sholl's in the 
1940s. 
</P>
<P>
	Today there's only one Sholl's. It's in the basement of a modern  
office building about five blocks from the White House. The 
building, owned by foreign businessmen, is represented by Cushman &AMP; 
Wakefield, which did not return phone calls. 
</P>
<P>
	Fleishell says the landlord wants to raise the monthly rent from  
$20,000 to $24,000. That's 2,286 more plates of Sholl's $1.75 
meatloaf. 
</P>
<P>
	A trendy eatery it's not. Religious messages greet patrons as  
they pass fruit plates and cottage cheese and Jell-O on lettuce 
leaves. One says: ``Religion and patriotism make this a nice place 
to work.'' 
</P>
<P>
	It's not high-priced either. Roast beef is $2.65. Beef stew is  
just a dime more. Liver and onions is $2.25. There's soup, salad, 
vegetables, fruit and nine kinds of pie.

	``I've been coming here every day for 20 years. I'm part of the

	A few years ago, Michael Kirwan, founder of the Llewellyn Scott  
Catholic Worker House of Hospitality, gave $5,000 to the cafeteria, 
printed $12 tan-colored meal tickets and began passing them out to 
poor people on the streets. When the bill was under $12, the 
cafeteria credited Kirwan's account. But when they ate more than 
$12 worth, the cafeteria, despite its financial troubles, absorbed 
the loss.

<HEADLINE> Neb. Prairie Fire Kills One </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	THEDFORD, Neb. (AP) -- Gusty winds fanned a massive prairie fire  
Wednesday that burned tens of thousands of acres and forced the 
evacuation of this tiny north-central Nebraska town. 
</P>
<P>
	A 44-year-old volunteer firefighter died fighting the fire and  
an unknown number of cattle perished. 
</P>
<P>
	About 300 people had to be evacuated from in and around  
Thedford, 300 miles northwest of Omaha near the South Dakota 
border. Several times Tuesday night and Wednesday morning the blaze 
lapped at the town before it was beaten back by exhausted 
firefighters. 
</P>
<P>
	Deb Bertrand, a state emergency management spokeswoman, said  
``only determination and a miracle'' saved the town. 
</P>
<P>
	The path of the fire was up to 10 miles wide in places and state  
officials said it burned an estimated 50,000 to 60,000 acres. One 
rural house had been destroyed. The Nebraska Forest Service said it 
was the state's second largest fire. The largest was in 1972. 
</P>
<P>
	Emergency managers declared victory over the blaze Wednesday  
morning, lifting the evacuation alert. 
</P>
<P>
	The cause of the fire was not immediately known, but officials  
said a charred -- and apparently abandoned -- farmstead appeared to 
be the starting point. 
</P>
<P>
	The path of the fire was up to 10 miles wide in places, and  
satellite images showed that fire burned about 75,000 acres.

<HEADLINE> 40 Kosovo Dead Said To Be Civilians </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) -- A forensic team investigating the  
slayings of dozens of Kosovo Albanians, which prompted 
international outrage in January, concluded today that the victims 
were unarmed civilians. 
</P>
<P>
	But the report by the Finnish team stopped short of calling the  
killings a massacre or directly blaming the Serbs. It said many 
questions will remain unanswered because of the one-week delay 
before officials were able to investigate the bodies. 
</P>
<P>
	``What may have happened to the bodies during that time is  
difficult to establish ... with absolute certainty,'' the report 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	The sensitive report was released amid an ominous buildup of  
Yugoslav forces in Kosovo and with the two sides deadlocked at a 
second round of peace talks that continued today in Paris. 
</P>
<P>
	Fighting has claimed more than 2,000 lives in the past year in  
Kosovo, a province of Serbia, the main Yugoslav republic. About 90 
percent of Kosovo's 2.2 million people are ethnic Albanians, and 
most favor independence. 
</P>
<P>
	Helena Ranta, head of the team, denied a report in The  
Washington Post today that described the team's findings as proof 
of an organized massacre and said some of the victims were forced 
to kneel before they were shot. 
</P>
<P>
	``If we want to speculate about what happened, we would be  
speculating for days,'' she told a news conference. 
</P>
<P>
	The Yugoslav government contends the victims in Racak  
(pronounced RAH-chak) were armed separatists or civilians 
accidentally caught in the crossfire of battle, and that Western 
powers accused its forces of a massacre in order to justify a push 
for military intervention in the province. 
</P>
<P>
	U.S.-led peace efforts intensified following the slayings of 45  
ethnic Albanians in Racak, 25 miles southwest of Pristina, the 
provincial capital. The Finnish team, however, was only given 
access to 40 bodies. 
</P>
<P>
	According to the Post, Germany ordered the Finns to withhold  
some of their most inflammatory findings, including a summary of 
their investigation. Germany chairs the European Union, which 
sponsored the forensic investigation. 
</P>
<P>
	For more than a week, Serb forces massed in the north of the  
province have been pounding a rebel-held area between the towns of 
Kosovska Mitrovica and Vucitrn. The attacks appear aimed at driving 
a wedge between guerrilla strongholds in the region. 
</P>
<P>
	While the north was calm early today, fighting was reported in  
western Kosovo. The Serb-run Media Center said rebels attacked an 
army border patrol west of Djakovica and Yugoslav forces returned 
fire, dispersing the guerrillas and heading in pursuit of them. 
</P>
<P>
	The Serb center, which is close to government authorities, also  
said a police patrol was attacked on the Djakovica-Ponosevac road. 
</P>
<P>
	On Tuesday, clashes at the foot of the Cicavica mountains, 20  
miles west of Pristina, left villages burning and sent hundreds of 
civilians fleeing. 
</P>
<P>
	The report on the Racak killings said pathologists determined  
that 22 of the people whose bodies were found in a gully by 
international monitors on Jan. 16 ``were most likely shot where 
found.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Among the bodies they conducted autopsies on, she said, were  
several elderly men and one woman. 
</P>
<P>
	``There were no indications of the people being other than  
unarmed civilians,'' she said. However, she noted they could not 
say definitively that the victims had never used firearms. 
</P>
<P>
	From the pattern of bullet wounds, clothing and possessions on  
the victims, the pathologists found no reason to conclude they were 
killed accidentally or were members of the Kosovo Liberation Army, 
the separatist force that has been battling the Serbs. 
</P>
<P>
	William Walker, the American head of the international  
monitoring force in Kosovo, visited the site on Jan. 16 and 
immediately accused Serb security forces, who had been conducting a 
siege of the village, of a massacre. 
</P>
<P>
	The pathologists, however, steered clear of such a  
characterization. 
</P>
<P>
	``The Racak events have been described as a 'massacre,''' the  
report said. 
</P>
<P>
	``However, such a conclusion does not fall within the competence  
of the EU forensic team or any other person having participated 
solely in the investigation of the bodies. The term 'massacre' ... 
is a legal description of the circumstances surrounding the deaths 
of persons as judged from a comprehensive analysis of all available 
information.''

<HEADLINE> House Passes Steel Quota Bill </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Republicans from steel-producing areas joined  
minority House Democrats in passing a bill Wednesday to reduce 
imports of foreign steel despite a veto threat from the White 
House. 
</P>
<P>
	The 289-141 vote -- one short of the total needed to override a  
White House veto, when all 435 members are voting -- showed 
lawmakers' desire for tougher action to help an industry struggling 
against low-priced imports from Japan, Russia and other countries. 
</P>
<P>
	The measure would limit steel imports to the average levels in  
the three years before July 1997. Imports already are declining, 
but the industry fears that only is temporary. The measure also 
would set up an import notification system to better track 
shipments into the country. 
</P>
<P>
	The proposal faces an uphill battle in the Senate, which has not  
decided on a specific remedy and cannot match the industry's 
strength in the House. 
</P>
<P>
	The domestic industry has been critical of the administration's  
response to the recent surge of steel imports, which reached record 
highs in 1998. The Asian economic crisis reduced demand for steel 
abroad and forced foreign producers to turn to the United States to 
unload their goods, resulting in thousands of U.S. layoffs and 
three bankruptcies, the U.S. industry contends. 
</P>
<P>
	``Today the House has the opportunity to send a strong message  
of support to steel workers and steel communities across the 
country,'' said Rep. Dick Gephardt, the House minority leader. 
</P>
<P>
	``Hopefully this will bring about the action needed to help  
reverse this economic calamity for thousands of workers and their 
families,'' said Gephardt, D-Mo. 
</P>
<P>
	Voting for the bill were 91 Republicans, 197 Democrats and one  
independent. Thirteen Democrats joined 128 Republicans in rejecting 
the bill. Four members did not vote; there is one vacancy now. 
</P>
<P>
	``The lack of effective response from the Clinton-Gore  
administration has forced Congress today to take action,'' said 
Rep. Phil English, a Pennsylvania Republican who comes from a 
region with several steel mills. 
</P>
<P>
	George Becker, president of the United Steelworkers of America,  
called the House vote ``a repudiation of the administration's trade 
policies.'' 
</P>
<P>
	While labor is an important Democratic constituency, the  
administration fears trade restrictions would encourage other 
countries to shut their markets to U.S. products and could stall 
the economic recovery of those countries. 
</P>
<P>
	The White House chief of staff, John Podesta, said the bill ``is  
not in our nation's economic interest.'' Senior White House 
advisers would recommend the president veto the legislation, 
Podesta said. 
</P>
<P>
	GOP opponents said the measure violated international trade  
agreements, which severely restrict the use of quotas. 
</P>
<P>
	Critics also said the limits could hurt manufacturers by raising  
steel prices and cutting off the supply of specialized steel 
products available only through imports. That, in turn, could mean 
more layoffs if companies cannot find the raw materials for radial 
tires, steel tubing and other products. 
</P>
<P>
	``There are absolutely no exceptions to the quotas in this bill,  
even if emergencies arise and if the product is simply not made in 
the United States,'' said Rep. Bill Archer, R-Texas, chairman of 
the House Ways and Means Committee. 
</P>
<P>
	A Japanese steel executive, Fujio Ono of NKK America Inc., said  
the bill ``totally ignores the fact that steel is an 
internationally traded product and that American manufacturers need 
choices to be competitive.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The U.S. industry recently won preliminary rulings on its  
complaints that Japan, Russia and Brazil illegally dumped 
hot-rolled carbon steel in the U.S. market at prices dramatically 
below production costs. Japan and Brazil face steel tariffs, 
although Russia has agreed to reduce its imports to avoid tariffs.

<HEADLINE> Asian Stock Markets Close Higher </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HONG KONG (AP) -- Most Asian stock markets closed higher Tuesday  
on the back of a record rally overnight on Wall Street. In Tokyo, 
optimism that Japan's economy may be bottoming out pushed the key 
index to a seven-month high. 
</P>
<P>
	The Japanese benchmark 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average rose  
293.22 points, or 1.86 percent, closing at 16,072.82 points. On 
Monday, the average closed up 290.74 points, or 1.88 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Tuesday's closing was the Nikkei's highest finish since Aug. 3,  
when the average closed at 16,165.08 points. 
</P>
<P>
	Stocks opened slightly lower on profit-taking but soon headed  
into positive territory on buying from foreign and domestic 
institutional investors. 
</P>
<P>
	The Economic Planning Agency said in a monthly report, released  
Tuesday, that overall conditions remained extremely severe, but 
also added the Japanese economy's ``downward movement continues to 
slow to a halt.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Separately, the Bank of Japan said Tuesday that the nation's  
economy ``appears to have stopped deteriorating.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, the dollar was quoted at 117.84 yen at late  
afternoon, down 0.58 yen from late Monday in Tokyo but higher than 
its late New York level of 117.64 yen overnight. 
</P>
<P>
	Hong Kong share prices closed higher, with the key index rising  
to an 11-month high on the back of a record rally on Wall Street. 
</P>
<P>
	The Hang Seng Index, the Hong Kong market's key indicator of  
blue chips, rose 74.39 points, or 0.7 percent, to close at 
10,911.25, its highest level since April 23, 1998. On Monday, the 
index had gained 35.10 points. 
</P>
<P>
	Brokers said the Hong Kong market was pushed up by gains on Wall  
Street, where the Dow Jones industrial average bounded to a new 
closing high of 9,958.77 points. The Hang Seng Index has gained 16 
percent over over the past three weeks. 
</P>
<P>
	Philippine shares rebounded Tuesday, ending a five-day skid on  
the back of Wall Street's record close Monday and the continuing 
slide of domestic interest rates, traders said. 
</P>
<P>
	The Philippine Stock Exchange index of 30 selected companies  
rose 40.5 points or 2.1 percent, to 1,981.84. 
</P>
<P>
	Elsewhere:  
</P>
<P>
	TAIPEI: Share prices closed higher as investors poured into the  
market after the index broke through the key 6,500-point level on 
Monday amid continued strength in semiconductor stocks. The 
Weighted Stock Price Index rose 73.91 points, or 1.1 percent, to 
6,672.23. 
</P>
<P>
	WELLINGTON: New Zealand share prices closed higher on the back  
of another record level set in the Dow Jones Industrial Average 
overnight. The NZSE-40 Capital Index rose 15.56 points, or 0.7 
percent, to 2,182.32. 
</P>
<P>
	SYDNEY: The Australian market closed at a new record high, but  
shy of the psychological 3,000-point barrier. The All Ordinaries 
index climbed for a fifth consecutive day to close at 2,992.2, up 
2.7 points, or 0.1 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	SEOUL: Share prices closed higher, with the key index rising

<HEADLINE> Advice About Anesthesia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	Some advice for consumers considering surgery in a doctor's  
office: 
</P>
<P>
	--Find an experienced doctor. Check that the physician is  
board-certified for the type of surgery being performed and has 
done it extensively. A professional society, such as the American 
Society of Plastic and Reconstructive Surgeons, or the state 
medical board may help. 
</P>
<P>
	--Ask lots of questions, advises Dr. John Neeld of the American  
Society of Anesthesiology: What type of sedation will be used and 
what are the risks? What sort of monitoring devices will be used to 
detect problems -- a pulse oximeter to measure oxygen levels? Who 
will monitor the patient while the surgeon operates -- a 
nurse-anesthetist trained to spot early problems, or someone with 
less training? Does the office have a fully equipped ``crash 
cart,'' or a plan for quick transport to a hospital? 
</P>
<P>
	--For children whose dentists urge sedation, the American Dental  
Association provides free consumer brochures. It can explain the 
different levels of training that general dentists, pediatric 
dentists or oral surgeons undergo. Many states require permits for 
dentists to use general anesthesia or ``conscious sedation,'' the 
strongest types of sedation, but may have fewer requirements for 
oral sedatives. 
</P>
<P>
	--For any child being sedated, ask how the child will be  
monitored and if the doctor or dentist has child-sized 
resuscitation equipment, said Dr. Charles Cote of the University of 
Illinois, Chicago. Children with asthma, heart problems or airway 
abnormalities may need sedation by specially trained anesthesia 
experts.

	40 Kosovo Dead Said To Be Civilians

<P>
	PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) -- Amid an ominous new buildup of

Albanians killed in January were civilians executed in an organized 
massacre -- contrary to Serb claims. Some of the victims were forced 
to kneel before they were shot, The Washington Post reported today, 
quoting Western sources familiar with the Finnish team's report, 
which was to be released later in the day. Such findings would 
contradict claims by the Yugoslav government that the victims in 
Racak were armed separatists or civilians accidentally caught in

hopes it can alleviate the debilitating disease. The Prosorba 
column, made by Cypress Bioscience, works much like dialysis. Once 
a week for 12 weeks, a patient's blood is slowly removed, the 
plasma is separated and treated by the Prosorba machine, and then 
the blood is retransfused into the body. The machine offers a 30 
percent chance of improving the swelling and pain that cripples 
patients' joints, Food and Drug Administration officials said in 
approving Prosorba late yesterday.

weeks ago told a federal judge that the company's accounting 
records were kept ``by hand on sheets of paper.'' But Gates, in his 
new book, ``Business at the Speed of Thought,'' says the figures 
are recorded digitally. And in an interview Tuesday with the 
Financial Times newspaper, which is publishing a four-part series 
from his book, Gates described how Microsoft, with $14.4 billion in 
sales last year, already uses an array of high-tech tools.

</P>
<P>
	LAUSANNE, Switzerland (AP) -- The Olympics' embattled leader said  
today the IOC is determined to clean up the ``very sad episode'' of 
the Salt Lake City bribery scandal and make sure such corruption 
never recurs. International Olympic Committee president Juan 
Antonio Samaranch said the general assembly is to vote on 
unprecedented expulsions and start a reform process was ``the most 
important session'' in IOC history. The IOC is meeting to take 
major steps in the wake of the $1.2 million bribery scheme.

<HEADLINE> Huskies Resist Common Perception </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PHOENIX (AP) -- Do not try to tell the Connecticut Huskies that  
the upset-laced West Region has become an uncrowded freeway for 
them to cruise into coach Jim Calhoun's long-anticipated first 
appearance in the Final Four. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's incorrect when people say it's going to be an easy two  
games for us to get to the Final Four,'' guard Khalid El-Amin said. 
``You can just ask Carolina, Stanford, teams of that nature -- very 
high seeds that didn't come prepared and ready to play with the 
energy and intensity they needed to have.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Iowa, Connecticut's opponent in Thursday night's regional  
semifinal, has fed off the emotion surrounding the departure of 
coach Tom Davis, who is leaving -- not by his choice -- at the end of 
the season. 
</P>
<P>
	``You pour so much of your energy into practice and your  
workouts and trying to improve yourself because he gave you a shot 
to play big-time basketball,'' Iowa's Kent McCausland said. ``You 
know he's just a great guy and he puts everything into trying to 
make you a better player. For him to put that energy into you, you 
just want to give it back.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The emotion propelled the Hawkeyes to an upset victory over  
Arkansas in the second round. But the players weren't exactly 
brimming with confidence about their chances against the deep, 
talented Huskies, who have lost just twice in 32 games and romped 
to two victories last week in Denver.. 
</P>
<P>
	``They're playing so well right now,'' McCausland said.  
``They're like a well-oiled machine.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Asked if he'd do the hokey-pokey if Iowa wins, the Hawkeyes'  
Jess Settles said, ``You'll see more than that. They're so good, I 
can't even imagine that happening.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Iowa was able to use Davis' trademark pressing defense against  
Arkansas, despite the Razorbacks' quickness. But doing it against 
Connecticut is another matter. 
</P>
<P>
	``We feel that's our strength,'' El-Amin said. ``We like to play  
the up-tempo game, and we love for a team to press us. We think we 
can do a very good job against anybody's press because we have very 
good ball handlers out there at all times.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Nobody has dared press the Huskies much this season.  
</P>
<P>
	``It's amazing. We've played 34 games and I don't think  
anybody's pressed us more than 10 possessions,'' Calhoun said. 
``New Mexico the other night threw on a press for about six 
possessions. We scored four out of six and the other times we got a 
good shot off. 
</P>
<P>
	``We don't get pressed. But assuming Tom plays the way he always  
plays, which I think he will, we'll probably get pressed for 40 
minutes.'' 
</P>
<P>
	El-Amin pulled hamstrings in practice two days ago but should be  
at about 90 percent efficiency, Calhoun said. 
</P>
<P>
	Unfortunately for Iowa, Connecticut All-American forward Richard  
Hamilton is at full strength. Hamilton has scored 49 points in the 
Huskies' NCAA victories over Texas-San Antonio (by 25) and New 
Mexico (by 22). 
</P>
<P>
	Calhoun, who has known Davis since the Iowa coch was at Boston  
College from 1977 to 1982, expects some sort of special defense 
geared to stopping Hamilton. 
</P>
<P>
	``They try to take the star player out of the game,'' Calhoun  
said. ``We feel we have enough complementary players to offset 
that. But that is something we will have to prove tomorrow.'' 
</P>
<P>
	This is the seventh time in the 1990s that Calhoun has brought  
Connecticut to the round of 16, and he's uncomfortably aware of his 
reputation as a coach who couldn't get his team to the Final Four. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've coached over 800-something games in college basketball,''  
he said, ``and I'm asked about four or five games. How fair is it? 
I didn't make the rules. We've won three or four Big East 
championship games against John Thompson, Jim Boeheim -- in Madison 
Square Garden on a Saturday night against St. John's. 
</P>
<P>
	``Those, I thought at the time, were big games. But I've been  
told since that there are bigger ones coming up.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Davis, meanwhile, insists he's not spending much time thinking  
about his final days as coach after 13 seasons at Iowa. He will 
leave the reflection for later. 
</P>
<P>
	``If you're working with 18- and 20-year-old guys, you know the  
excitement of being in the tournament overrides a lot of issues,'' 
Davis said. ``I'm just enjoying it with them.''

<HEADLINE> Senate Passes Missile-Defense Bill </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Senate gave overwhelming approval on  
Wednesday to a bill to commit the Pentagon to building a national 
defense against limited ballistic missile attack ``as soon as 
technologically possible.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The lopsided 97-3 vote belied the years of partisan battling the  
issue had generated. 
</P>
<P>
	Long a Republican priority, the bill drew turnabout support from  
Democrats and the Clinton administration after disclosures of North 
Korean missile tests and Chinese weapons espionage. 
</P>
<P>
	Republicans welcomed the day-old Democratic backing and the  
dropping of a long-standing veto threat by President Clinton, 
although they ridiculed the timing. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm glad to hear he's now dropped his veto threat. But as  
usual, his pledge comes a little late and falls short,'' said Sen. 
Bob Smith, R-N.H., a GOP presidential aspirant. 
</P>
<P>
	Democrats said several amendments, including one pledging the  
United States would continue to seek nuclear arms reductions in 
Russia, made the legislation more palatable. 
</P>
<P>
	``The bill is now acceptable to the president,'' said Sen. Carl  
Levin, D-Mich., who was the chief Democratic opponent in the past. 
The earlier version could have violated terms of the 1972 
Anti-Ballistic Missile treaty, Levin said. 
</P>
<P>
	Ending the impasse helped Democrats defuse an emerging GOP  
political campaign against them on national security grounds, a 
campaign that intensified in recent days with reports that China 
may have stolen technology from the Los Alamos nuclear laboratory 
in the 1980s that could help them improve their ballistic missile 
program. 
</P>
<P>
	Republicans are accusing administration officials of being lax  
in handling that case when it came to their attention earlier this 
decade, and also of helping China's missile program more recently 
through satellite technology exports. 
</P>
<P>
	After a closed-door Democratic luncheon on Tuesday, Democratic  
leaders told the White House they did not know if they could 
sustain a veto this year, given the popularity of the 
missile-defense program, Democratic aides said. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton issued a statement applauding the vote. ``We are  
committed to meeting the growing danger that outlaw nations will 
develop and deploy long-range missiles that could deliver weapons 
of mass destruction against us,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Regardless of the current politics, the bipartisan support for  
the legislation -- expected to be repeated on Thursday when the 
House takes up its version of the bill -- ends years of divisive 
debate between the parties. 
</P>
<P>
	The House sponsor of the legislation, Rep. Curt Weldon, R-Pa.,  
said Democrats would be unable to find cover by offering the White 
House-favored amendments to his legislation under terms of debate 
adopted late Wednesday by the House Rules Committee. 
</P>
<P>
	``There isn't going to be any room for people to wiggle,''  
Weldon said. He said the administration has continued to oppose 
deployment of a system, while his measure pre-empts that decision 
and makes it for the president. 
</P>
<P>
	The Weldon legislation, which flatly states that deploying a  
missile defense system is official U.S. policy, was approved 50-3 
by the House Armed Services Committee and was expected to get wide 
approval in the House as well. A House-Senate conference committee 
will ultimately have to resolve differences between the two 
measures. 
</P>
<P>
	A missile defense shield has been a top GOP agenda item since  
President Reagan proposed an ambitious space-based defense system 
in 1983, dubbed ``Star Wars'' by its critics. 
</P>
<P>
	The system now being envisioned is much more moderate, designed  
to stop a single missile or just a few, probably fired at the 
United States accidentally or by a rogue nation. 
</P>
<P>
	Even so, the program is not expected to be inexpensive.  
</P>
<P>
	More than $50 billion has already been spent on research and  
limited testing. Clinton earmarked another $10.5 billion in his 
budget for it over the next five years, although he had not wanted 
to make a decision until June 2000 on whether to field such a 
system. 
</P>
<P>
	The Pentagon suggests the earliest a system could be ready is  
2005, with or without the legislation. 
</P>
<P>
	Sen. Byron Dorgan, D-N.D., a skeptic about the program, likened  
the technology to trying to ``hit bullet with a bullet.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Sen. Paul Wellstone, D-Minn., one of three Democrats opposing  
the final bill, called the president's change of position ``a 
serious mistake.'' He said the bill ``jeopardizes years of gains in 
achieving arms reductions.'' Also voting against it were Sens. 
Richard Durbin, D-Ill., and Patrick Leahy, D-Vt. 
</P>
<P>
	The president ``should pick his fights with Congress on foreign  
policy issues'' more carefully, asserted Sen. John Warner, R-Va., 
chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee. He said the debate 
over missile defense should have been resolved earlier and 
Clinton's slowness to recognize that set back development of a 
system. 
</P>
<P>
	Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., another GOP presidential aspirant,  
welcomed the Democratic support ``after years of discounting a 
ballistic missile threat to the United States.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``On the surface, this appears to be one of the president's more  
propitious policy reversals,'' McCain said. But he also questioned 
the administration's interpretation that amendments had made the 
measure more agreeable to Russia. 
</P>
<P>
	``We should proceed irrespective of whether Russia agrees to  
reduce its nuclear weapons,'' McCain said. 
</P>
<P>
	Democrats cited recent developments in the world as persuading  
them that the threat of a missile attack was genuine. 
</P>
<P>
	``I come to the floor supportive of the notion that we are in a  
new world today. ... It is a new world that seeks to protect us 
against a rogue, accidental or unauthorized'' missile firing, Sen. 
John Kerry, D-Mass., told the Senate. 
</P>
<P>
	Legislation committing the United States to deploy a  
missile-defense system was in the GOP's 1994 campaign manifesto, 
the ``Contract With America.'' Congress passed it in 1995 as part 
of a spending bill, but Clinton vetoed it and the veto was 
sustained.

<P>
	FORT MYERS, Fla. (AP) -- Texas catcher John Marzano is out 4-6  
weeks after his left hand was broken by a pitch in the Rangers' 7-5 
exhibition victory over Boston on Wednesday.

<HEADLINE> Study Shows Kids' Heart Risks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Mexican-American and black children are  
heavier and have higher blood pressure and fattier diets -- all risk 
factors for heart disease -- than white youths, researchers say. 
</P>
<P>
	Stanford University researchers based their study, published  
today in the Journal of the American Medical Association, on data 
collected from more than 7,000 children and adults ages 6 to 24. 
</P>
<P>
	The findings, ``highlight the need for information about heart  
disease prevention to be made available sooner, maybe as early as 
kindergarten,'' said Marilyn Winkleby, an epidemiologist at the 
Stanford Center for Research in Disease Prevention and lead author 
of the study. 
</P>
<P>
	The results are cause for concern, said Dr. Teri Manolio,  
director of epidemiology and biometry at the National Heart, Lung 
and Blood Institute. 
</P>
<P>
	``If 6-to-9-year-olds are already overweight, they're going to  
be in some trouble as adults because that will translate into a 
higher risk of cardiovascular disease,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	The study is based on dietary surveys and medical exams given to  
black, Mexican-Americans and whites from 1988 to 1994 as part of 
the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey. 
</P>
<P>
	Hispanic groups other than Mexican-American were not included in  
the survey. 
</P>
<P>
	The researchers examined six cardiovascular disease risk  
factors: body weight, blood pressure, cigarette smoking, an early 
sign of diabetes and blood cholesterol. 
</P>
<P>
	They found that black girls ages 6 to 9 were about 4 percent  
heavier than white girls, had higher blood pressure and consumed 
more fat. Among women ages 18 to 24, black and Mexican-American 
women were an average of 12 pounds heavier. 
</P>
<P>
	They also discovered that white girls smoke four times as much  
as Mexican-American girls and eight times as much as black girls. 
</P>
<P>
	Black men tended to be heavier for their height and consumed  
more fat than white and Mexican-American men, the study found.

<HEADLINE> Gonzaga Readies for Florida </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SPOKANE, Wash. (AP) -- With no apologies to rapper Will Smith,  
Gonzaga's basketball team bopped to ``Gettin' Zaggy Wit It'' with 
hundreds of students at a pep rally. 
</P>
<P>
	After the rally Tuesday night, the Bulldogs got on a charter  
flight to Phoenix and Thursday's NCAA West Regional game against 
Florida. 
</P>
<P>
	``This has been a great ride, but we are still on the roller  
coaster,'' coach Dan Monson said of his team, which reached the 
Sweet 16 for the first time in school history. 
</P>
<P>
	Bulldogs boosters gave Smith's ``Gettin' Jiggy Wit It'' the same  
treatment Gonzaga gave to Minnesota and Stanford, the teams the 
Spokane school beat in the first two rounds of the NCAA basketball 
tournament. 
</P>
<P>
	A local radio station put the music to new lyrics, interspersed  
with radio play-by-play accounts of Bulldogs successes. 
</P>
<P>
	Hundreds of students at the small private college turned out to  
see their team off at The Kennel, Gonzaga's home court. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're four games away from a national title,'' Monson told the  
crowd. ``To me that would be a great season right there.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``How about the Sweet 16 baby?'' guard Quentin Hall, who has  
played spectacularly in the two games, told the crowd. 
</P>
<P>
	``If everything goes as planned, this will not be our last  
weekend playing,'' said Mike Leasure of Spanaway, the only player 
who was also on Gonzaga's NCAA qualifying team in 1995, the 
school's only other appearance in the tournament. 
</P>
<P>
	With air fares high and seating limited, many Gonzaga students  
were planning to drive the 1,300 miles to Phoenix for the game. 
Monson warned them to drive carefully. 
</P>
<P>
	``Nothing would tarnish it worse than an accident on the road,''  
he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Gonzaga (27-6) has already won the most games in school history.  
This will be its first game against Florida (22-8). 
</P>
<P>
	Bulldogs fever is running high on the campus of the Jesuit-run  
college founded in 1887. Hats and T-shirts are flying out of the 
campus bookstore as fast as they can be stocked. 
</P>
<P>
	This is not the 4,500-student school's first brush with NCAA  
success. In 1950, Gonzaga shared the NCAA boxing championship with 
Idaho. 
</P>
<P>
	But the Bulldogs have gotten little respect over the years. They  
were passed over for an NCAA tournament last year despite a 24-10 
record. 
</P>
<P>
	One thing is certain. This year's team is focusing plenty of  
attention on the school's unusual name. 
</P>
<P>
	The university is named for St. Aloysius Gonzaga, a 16th Century  
Jesuit priest remembered these days as the Patron Saint of Youth. 
</P>
<P>
	Gonzaga (1568-1591) gave his life caring for victims of the  
plague in Rome, according to The Catholic Encyclopedia. 
</P>
<P>
	Fans and team members have had a lot of fun listening to the  
national media mispronounce the school's name. For the record, it 
is pronounced ``Gone-zag'-uh,'' not ``Gone-zaw'-guh.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Although the team's official nickname is the Bulldogs, Gonzaga  
sports clubs are just as often called the Zags. 
</P>
<P>
	Signs handed out at the rally said ``Go Zags!''

<HEADLINE>  Kentucky Gets Ready for Wally World </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LEXINGTON, Ky. (AP) -- Miami of Ohio has ``Wally World'' --  
high-scoring forward Wally Szczerbiak and teammates skilled at 
getting him a chance to score. 
</P>
<P>
	By contrast, in the world of Kentucky basketball -- call it The  
World According to Tubby -- there is no single player around whom 
the rest of the team revolves. 
</P>
<P>
	That's why Friday's NCAA tournament game in St. Louis between  
the third-seeded Wildcats (27-8) and the 10th-seeded RedHawks 
(24-7) presents a true contrast in styles. 
</P>
<P>
	Nowhere has coach Tubby Smith's team-oriented approach been more  
evident than in the substitution pattern he used later in the 
season. 
</P>
<P>
	Four or five minutes into each game, starters Wayne Turner,  
Scott Padgett, Heshimu Evans, Desmond Allison and Michael Bradley 
sit down. Taking their place is a fresh second unit of Jamaal 
Magloire, Jules Camara, Tayshaun Prince, Saul Smith and Ryan Hogan. 
</P>
<P>
	``That's a good time for us to try and press'' opposing teams,  
who usually don't have the same depth as Kentucky, Smith said 
Tuesday. ``We're hoping we can fatigue them a bit and then bring 
the first unit back in. 
</P>
<P>
	``We try to wear people down with our bench strength.''  
</P>
<P>
	The tactic has served Kentucky well in postseason play.  
</P>
<P>
	In both the SEC championship game against Arkansas and in the  
Wildcats' second-round NCAA win over Kansas on Sunday, the second 
unit came off the bench to rally Kentucky from early deficits. 
</P>
<P>
	Just two weeks ago, the Wildcats were coming off a 3-4 February,  
and a fourth straight Final Four trip seemed improbable. Now, 
Kentucky is 5-0 in March and two wins away from a Final Four trip 
to St. Petersburg, Fla. 
</P>
<P>
	Magloire said Kentucky's team effort will make it impossible for  
Szczerbiak to singlehandedly beat the Wildcats, as he did in 
scoring 43 points in a first-round win over Washington. 
</P>
<P>
	``No one individual can beat a team,'' Magloire said. ``Granted,  
he's a good player. But no one player can beat us. No one player 
can beat a team.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Smith said he did not plan any major changes to his basic  
containment defense for the third-round game against Miami, which 
is coming off an upset win over second-seeded Utah. 
</P>
<P>
	``We haven't used any gimmick defenses all year long,'' he said.  
``We're going to try to do something out of our regular man-to-man 
defense to try to limit his (Szczerbiak's) touches.'' 
</P>
<P>
	With Szczerbiak equally skilled at posting up and stepping  
outside for the perimeter jump shot, Smith said there is no glaring 
weakness for the Wildcats to attack. The coach said he likely will 
try several different players on Szczerbiak, including senior 
forwards Padgett and Evans. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't think there's any one thing you can do to shut him  
down,'' he said. ``We'll just try to deny him the ball as much as 
possible.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Smith and Padgett said there's more to Miami than Szczerbiak.  
Point guard Rob Mestas is a calm floor leader and skilled at 
distributing the ball, Smith said. Guard Damon Frierson is 
averaging 13.1 points, and the entire team is skilled at getting 
Szczerbiak open for shots. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think more than anything, they feed off of when other teams  
go to double Wally,'' Padgett said. ``They have a team. It's not 
just Wally.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Like Szczerbiak, the 6-foot-9 Padgett possesses inside-outside  
versatility, as he showed down the stretch in the Kansas game. He 
hit a 3-pointer that sent the game to overtime, nailed another long 
jumper to open the overtime and then went inside to get to the foul 
line and make five free throws in the extra session as Kentucky won 
92-88. 
</P>
<P>
	Padgett said he has tried to focus on his post play in recent  
games. 
</P>
<P>
	``The more I post up, the more opportunities I get to get to the  
free-throw line,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> Introducing The `Good News Bears' </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SPRINGFIELD, Mo. (AP) -- The first time he was asked how he  
planned to get little Southwest Missouri State past mighty Duke, 
Steve Alford had a ready reply. 
</P>
<P>
	He would sneak out onto the New Jersey Turnpike and put up  
detour signs. No. 1 Duke would get lost on the way to the 
Meadowlands, and Alford's Bears would have bamboozled another 
top-ranked opponent into defeat on a march toward an NCAA title. 
</P>
<P>
	``But then I found out they're 8-0 there,'' Alford said,  
chuckling. ``So they probably know how to get there.'' 
</P>
<P>
	They certainly know how to play there, in an arena that is home  
to this weekend's NCAA East regional. 
</P>
<P>
	But then Duke (34-1) knows how to play anywhere. The Blue Devils  
won their first- and second-round games last week by 41 points 
apiece. 
</P>
<P>
	``They're very good once they get ahead,'' Alford said, noting  
how the Blue Devils often have jumped to quick leads and never 
relinquished them. 
</P>
<P>
	Then, after a long pause, he added: ``They're very good once  
they get behind.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In fact, Alford said, tape on every Duke game he's reviewed  
looks just about the same: ``The game starts 0-0 and 10 minutes in 
it's pretty lopsided.'' 
</P>
<P>
	So just how does he plan to have his Bears play Duke Friday  
night? 
</P>
<P>
	Alford wouldn't say. But he hinted strongly that it hinges on  
having fun. 
</P>
<P>
	Monday's practice, for example, the first the Bears held after  
upsetting Tennessee 81-51 in the second round, didn't involve 
basketball. 
</P>
<P>
	``We played Wiffle ball,'' Alford said. ``That was our practice.  
</P>
<P>
	``Team Sweet beat Team 16, 12-8.''  
</P>
<P>
	But can Team Southwest Missouri State, seeded 12th, beat Team  
Duke, seeded No. 1? 
</P>
<P>
	``A No. 12 seed has never won,'' Alford said.  
</P>
<P>
	But that's not to say that the coach, who played on a national  
championship team at Indiana in 1987, doesn't believe it can't be 
done this time. And so do his players who, like him, say they'll 
play hard, have fun and hope that's enough. In the meantime, they 
don't appear particularly worried as they prepare for the biggest 
game of their careers. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's our biggest game just because it's our next game,'' guard  
William Fontleroy said. ``The next obstacle standing in front of us 
just happens to be Duke.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Still, he grinned at the thought of playing in the Meadowlands,  
``in front of the New York media where we've got a chance to make a 
name for ourselves.'' 
</P>
<P>
	This is a team, he said, that went 20-10 during the regular  
season but could have been 24-6. It lost four conference games to 
its two toughest opponents, Creighton and Evansville, by margins of 
three points and two points, one in overtime. 
</P>
<P>
	But it's also a team that upset a strong Missouri team early in  
the season, then beat a St. Louis team that beat a Cincinnati team 
that handed Duke its only loss this season. 
</P>
<P>
	But until last week it was a team nobody outside the Ozarks paid  
much attention to. 
</P>
<P>
	``We even had one guy rooting for us against Tennessee,''  
Fontleroy said, ``who kept calling us SMU. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm like, `Give me a break,' '' he added, laughing.  
</P>
<P>
	A break, indeed. Because SMU isn't in this tournament. But  
Southwest Missouri State is, and with some breaks Friday it 
believes it can stay.

<HEADLINE> NFL Expands to L.A. Tentatively </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PHOENIX (AP) -- The NFL loves the millions of television sets in  
Los Angeles. It loves the glamour and the financial potential of 
the area. What it doesn't love is the absence of a viable stadium 
for an expansion team. 
</P>
<P>
	Yet on Tuesday, it gave the nation's second-largest city  
tentative approval as the league's 32nd member. Los Angeles will 
get an expansion team to begin play in 2002 if it presents an 
acceptable stadium plan by Sept. 15. 
</P>
<P>
	Oh, yes, an ownership group also wasn't chosen.  
</P>
<P>
	``We can not fail in Los Angeles, we need a franchise in Los  
Angeles, but it must be a successful franchise,'' Browns president 
Carmen Policy said. 
</P>
<P>
	Even though Houston does have a solid stadium proposal and  
league owners like Bob McNair, who heads the Texas city's bid, the 
lure of 5.5 million TV homes was too enticing. 
</P>
<P>
	``Los Angeles is assuring us it can get the deal done,'' said  
Pat Bowlen, owner of the Denver Broncos and a member of the stadium 
committee. ``We have to know we will get a stadium we can approve 
of.'' 
</P>
<P>
	One Los Angeles group, headed by Michael Ovitz, wants to build a  
stadium in Carson, 18 miles from downtown LA. The other, led by Eli 
Broad and Ed Roski, wants to reconstruct the Los Angeles Coliseum, 
once the home of the Rams, and then the Raiders -- both of which 
left town in 1995. 
</P>
<P>
	Carolina Panthers owner Jerry Richardson, chairman of the  
stadium committee, said the stadium and ownership issues are 
separate. Richardson's group will go to Los Angeles in the next few 
weeks to inspect both sites. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have to figure out a way to do that and we have a very  
short window,'' Richardson said. ``The site is something we must 
address pretty quickly.'' 
</P>
<P>
	If Los Angeles can't come up with an acceptable plan in six  
months, Bowlen said the expansion franchise would be awarded to 
Houston, which lost the Oilers to Tennessee two years ago. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a date we can live with,'' McNair said. ``A lot has to be  
done in Los Angeles. It probably will be difficult getting it done 
there. We think we're still very much in the game.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Added Raiders owner Al Davis on just how tough a chore LA faces:  
</P>
<P>
	``What's changed? They couldn't get their act together in four  
years. Why should they be able to do it in six months?'' 
</P>
<P>
	Naturally, Ovitz and Roski have no doubt they'll satisfy the NFL  
-- and beat out the other guy's bid. 
</P>
<P>
	``We could not be more pleased,'' Ovitz said. ``At this point,  
it's Los Angeles' to lose. We will all continue to do our best to 
make it happen. I believe the team will be here.'' 
</P>
<P>
	So does Roski.  
</P>
<P>
	``They've asked certain things for us to do and we have followed  
up and answered those questions,'' Roski said. ``They want to come 
out and see if those answers are correct and if we can accomplish 
it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The owners never got around to settling on the return of instant  
replay as an officiating aid. That issue was to be discussed today, 
with a system involving coaches' challenges to be presented for a 
vote. 
</P>
<P>
	Also on Tuesday, the owners:  
</P>
<P>
	-- Declined to take action on the sale of the Washington Redskins  
to Howard and Edward Milstein, pending a full report from the 
league's finance committee. Tagliabue said he expected that report 
today and a vote on approving the $800 million sale should take 
place. 
</P>
<P>
	-- Confirmed the one-year suspension and $1 million fine for San  
Francisco owner Edward DeBartolo for his part in a Louisiana 
gambling scandal. Tagliabue said that if DeBartolo did not abide by 
all the conditions of the suspension, the fine would escalate to $5 
million. 
</P>
<P>
	-- Voted to keep the Thanksgiving Day games in Detroit and  
Dallas, turning down a motion by Kansas City and New Orleans to 
rotate the game.

<HEADLINE> How the Dow Is Calculated </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- The Dow Jones industrial average actually isn't  
an ``average'' of the 30 stocks it represents -- although it started 
out that way. 
</P>
<P>
	When it was first devised in 1896, the Dow's value was  
calculated by adding up the stock prices of 12 major companies and 
then simply dividing by 12. The resulting average was expressed in 
terms of points, rather than dollars. 
</P>
<P>
	The formula remained the same in 1916 when the editors of The  
Wall Street Journal -- which created and still controls the Dow -- 
expanded it to 20 companies. 
</P>
<P>
	But when the Dow was expanded to 30 companies in 1928, the  
editors began using a new ``divisor'' rather than the number of 
stocks, to keep the average stable even if one stock was 
substituted for another or if a company split its stock. 
</P>
<P>
	Stock splits occur when a company cancels its shares and issues  
a larger amount of new shares, but at a lower price. For instance, 
in a 2-for-1 split, the price would be cut in half, but the number 
of shares would double. Splits create the perception that a stock 
is cheaper to buy, sometimes increasing demand. 
</P>
<P>
	After years of shrinking with every stock split, the divisor  
actually dropped below one in 1986, and now it sits at just 0.225. 
</P>
<P>
	So, if the Dow is at exactly 10,000 that means the share prices  
of all 30 stocks adds up to $2,250. Dividing 2,250 by 0.225 equals 
10,000. 
</P>
<P>
	Using similar math, every time one of the 30 stocks moves up or  
down by $1, the Dow moves 4.5 points in the same direction. 
</P>
<P>
	With both Wal-Mart and IBM due to split their shares 2-for-1 in  
the near future, the divisor will shrink to about 0.215. Before 
long, each $1 move by any of the 30 stocks will be equivalent to a 
5-point move by the Dow.

<HEADLINE> Pirates' Schmidt Injures Groin </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BRADENTON, Fla. (AP) -- Jason Schmidt, expected to start the  
Pittsburgh Pirates' second game of the season, prematurely left 
Wednesday's exhibition game against Cincinnati with a strained 
right groin. 
</P>
<P>
	Schmidt doesn't expect the injury to affect his status for  
opening day, but isn't certain if he can make his next scheduled 
spring start Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	The right-hander, who had pitched three scoreless innings, felt  
pain while throwing his first warmup pitch for the fourth inning. 
The pain worsened on his next two pitches, and he motioned trainer 
Kent Biggerstaff to the mound. 
</P>
<P>
	``We decided to shut it down before it got even worse than it  
was,'' said Schmidt, who is penciled in to start April 6 against 
Montreal. ``I've never had a groin injury in my life. I don't know 
what might have aggravated it right there.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Pirates wore green caps in honor of St. Patrick's Day, but  
it didn't bring any luck to their pitching staff. Not long after 
Schmidt was lifted, left-hander Jeff Tabaka grabbed his arm in pain 
while warming up in the bullpen and did not pitch as expected. 
</P>
<P>
	Tabaka has not pitched under game conditions this spring because  
of the elbow discomfort, and the latest setback means he probably 
won't be ready to start the season. 
</P>
<P>
	Tabaka, 2-2 with a 3.02 ERA in 37 appearances last season, will  
be examined again Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	``I thought it was coming along fine, I was up to about 80  
percent, but now it looks like it might be something more,'' Tabaka 
said. ``I've never had any elbow problems. Right now, I'm real 
frustrated. I finally felt like I got on my feet (in the majors) 
last season, and this is a big letdown.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Tabaka's injury could create a roster opening for left-hander  
Jeff Wallace, if he has fully recovered from reconstructive elbow 
surgery that sidelined him last season. Wallace has allowed two 
runs and struck out two in four innings this spring. 
</P>
<P>
	Normally a poor pitcher in spring training, Schmidt is unscored  
upon in seven innings and, until being injured, has never had a 
smoother spring. 
</P>
<P>
	``Hopefully, it isn't too bad,'' said Schmidt, who started 8-1  
last season before finishing 11-14 with a 4.07 ERA. ``But this is 
what spring training is for, to get all of the little injuries out 
of the way. 
</P>
<P>
	``If this was during the season, I'd be extremely concerned, but  
hopefully this won't be something that's nagging at me for the 
whole season,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Other than the injury, Schmidt couldn't be more pleased.  
</P>
<P>
	``I felt very comfortable on the mound and I was very happy with  
my outing,'' he said. ``My slider is the best it's ever been during 
spring training. Normally, I can't get anybody out in spring 
training. Who knows what I've been doing this spring?''

<HEADLINE> Raiders Owner Wants Indemnification </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PHOENIX (AP) -- Oakland Raiders owner Al Davis believes he should  
be indemnified if the NFL expansion to Los Angeles goes through. 
</P>
<P>
	The league gave Los Angeles a conditional expansion franchise  
during its winter meetings this week. Davis said Wednesday he owns 
rights to that territory. He moved the Raiders to LA in 1982 and 
back to Oakland in 1995. 
</P>
<P>
	``Enhancement always is in effect,'' Davis said, refusing to say  
how much compensation he would demand. ``The commissioner has 
testified in court that if a team moves into (another team's) 
territory, there is a fee. 
</P>
<P>
	``No one says LA does not deserve a team. I feel strongly after  
winning all of our lawsuits that the league argued strongly that 
because of the enhancement policy, we should pay a fee for the LA 
territory,'' he said of his move south in '82. ``The court upheld 
it and we settled and we paid.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Now, because he feels the LA area belongs to the Raiders, Davis  
wants remuneration if the league's 32nd time winds up there. 
</P>
<P>
	``I want to be able to uphold the rights we have,'' he said. ``I  
want them, if they put an expansion team there, to pay for the 
rights.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The two bidding groups from Los Angeles have six months to come  
up with a viable stadium proposal and display solid community 
support. Davis doesn't expect that to happen. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm not going to predict that. Anything is doable,'' he said.  
</P>
<P>
	``In 1995, we had the chance to build a stadium at Hollywood  
Park and we would have been playing there since 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	``The league, without question, destroyed those negotiations by  
saying if they wanted Super Bowls at Hollywood Park -- which 
Hollywood Park needed to make it work -- they've got to take a 
second NFL team at Hollywood Park. 
</P>
<P>
	``They put onerous terms in there and destroyed the  
negotiations.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Commissioner Paul Tagliabue said he wasn't surprised to hear of  
Davis' claims, or that Davis believes the city of Oakland and 
Alameda County have breached his lease at the Oakland Coliseum. 
</P>
<P>
	``Nothing Al says surprises me,'' Tagliabue said. He wouldn't  
respond to Davis' insistence that the Raiders deserve 
indemnification for league expansion to Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
	As for his dealings with Oakland, Davis said his main interest  
``is that the Oakland community, the city and county, live up to 
the representations made to the Raiders.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Davis said he was promised all club seats, suites and personal  
seat licenses would be sold out. 
</P>
<P>
	``That's what representations were made to taxpayers, to the  
entire community,'' he said. ``It was a lie.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Davis said he wants to settle things in Oakland and is not  
negotiating with anyone in Los Angeles about returning there, even 
though he has received feelers about doing so. Asked if the 
Pasadena City Council had contacted the Raiders, all he would say 
is, ``Oh, you heard about that?''

<HEADLINE> Auburn-OSU More Than Porter &AMP; Penn </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	KNOXVILLE, Tenn. (AP) -- Newcomers Chris Porter and Scoonie Penn  
get most of the attention, and deservedly so. 
</P>
<P>
	Players of the year in their respective conferences -- Porter in  
the Southeastern Conference and Penn in the Big Ten -- the junior 
transfers helped Auburn and Ohio State end extended stays from the 
NCAA tournament. 
</P>
<P>
	But Auburn and Ohio State are more than Porter and Penn -- who  
will face each other Thursday night when the teams meet in the 
South regional semifinals at Thompson-Boling Arena. 
</P>
<P>
	Auburn (29-3) and Ohio State (25-8) have not gotten to the NCAA  
round of 16 solely because of their impressive first-year players. 
Others have stepped up as Porter and Penn have failed in the 
postseason to match their season averages. 
</P>
<P>
	Penn's 31 percent shooting (15-of-48) in the postseason is well  
below his season mark of 45 percent. And Porter is the 
fourth-leading scorer for Auburn in the NCAA tourney with only 9 
points per game -- seven below his team-leading season average. 
</P>
<P>
	``It has been a balanced team,'' Auburn coach Cliff Ellis said.  
``It's been a team that has not been centered around one player, 
although there has been a lot of credit given.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Porter was the only new starter for Auburn, which before this  
season had four consecutive winning records but had not been in the 
NCAA tournament since 1988. He had originally signed with Auburn, 
but first had to go to junior college because of academics. 
</P>
<P>
	But with Porter drawing a lot of attention from defenders in the  
postseason, and his numbers down, others have emerged. Guard Scott 
Polhman had a career-high 28 points in an 81-74 victory over 
Oklahoma State last weekend. 
</P>
<P>
	In the opening round against Winthrop, 12 Auburn players scored  
-- with Pohlman and Doc Robinson each getting 14 -- in an 80-41 
victory. 
</P>
<P>
	``One guy hasn't made or broken this team,'' Pohlman said.  
``Chris has been an excellent addition ... but it takes five guys 
on the court working together. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have no selfish motives. We have one goal of winning and a  
total team attitude.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Like Porter, Penn was the only new starter on his team this  
season. 
</P>
<P>
	Auburn had at least experienced some success before Porter. Ohio  
State was 8-22 and finished last in the Big Ten at 1-15 while Penn 
sat out last season following his transfer from Boston College. 
</P>
<P>
	Before the Buckeyes played a game this season, Penn was making a  
difference. He told his teammates on the first day of practice that 
they were going to the NCAA tournament. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't know how the other kids on the team responded, but I  
was the one that responded like I thought he was off the wall,'' 
said Ohio State coach Jim O'Brien, who had Penn for NCAA 
appearances at Boston College in 1996 and 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	``I just wanted us to be better than we were a year ago. But  
Scoonie's mentality is that when March comes around, you play in 
the NCAA tournament.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Penn was the only player with any postseason experience for the  
Buckeyes, who hadn't been to the NCAA tournament since 1992. 
</P>
<P>
	Michael Redd, the Buckeyes' leading scorer (19.6 ppg) and with  
five 30-point games, said Penn was the needed piece. 
</P>
<P>
	``Scoonie brought a winning attitude to this program, brought a  
lot of leadership to this team and was another scoring weapon for 
our team, which we didn't have last year,'' Redd said. ``That is 
why we are winning this year.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Yet, while Penn is struggling from the field in the postseason,  
Reed has combined in the Big Ten and NCAA tournaments to hit 
36-of-71 field goals (51 percent) while averaging 23 points per 
game. 
</P>
<P>
	With relatively easy victories over Murray State (72-58) and  
Detroit (75-44), Ohio State has made it as far in the NCAA tourney 
as it did in its last appearance seven years ago.

<HEADLINE>  Kentucky Gets Ready for Wally World </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LEXINGTON, Ky. (AP) -- Miami of Ohio has ``Wally World'' --  
high-scoring forward Wally Szczerbiak and teammates skilled at 
getting him a chance to score. 
</P>
<P>
	By contrast, in the world of Kentucky basketball -- call it The  
World According to Tubby -- there is no single player around whom 
the rest of the team revolves. 
</P>
<P>
	That's why Friday's NCAA tournament game in St. Louis between  
the third-seeded Wildcats (27-8) and the 10th-seeded RedHawks 
(24-7) presents a true contrast in styles. 
</P>
<P>
	Nowhere has coach Tubby Smith's team-oriented approach been more  
evident than in the substitution pattern he used later in the 
season. 
</P>
<P>
	Four or five minutes into each game, starters Wayne Turner,  
Scott Padgett, Heshimu Evans, Desmond Allison and Michael Bradley 
sit down. Taking their place is a fresh second unit of Jamaal 
Magloire, Jules Camara, Tayshaun Prince, Saul Smith and Ryan Hogan. 
</P>
<P>
	``That's a good time for us to try and press'' opposing teams,  
who usually don't have the same depth as Kentucky, Smith said 
Tuesday. ``We're hoping we can fatigue them a bit and then bring 
the first unit back in. 
</P>
<P>
	``We try to wear people down with our bench strength.''  
</P>
<P>
	The tactic has served Kentucky well in postseason play.  
</P>
<P>
	In both the SEC championship game against Arkansas and in the  
Wildcats' second-round NCAA win over Kansas on Sunday, the second 
unit came off the bench to rally Kentucky from early deficits. 
</P>
<P>
	Just two weeks ago, the Wildcats were coming off a 3-4 February,  
and a fourth straight Final Four trip seemed improbable. Now, 
Kentucky is 5-0 in March and two wins away from a Final Four trip 
to St. Petersburg, Fla. 
</P>
<P>
	Magloire said Kentucky's team effort will make it impossible for  
Szczerbiak to singlehandedly beat the Wildcats, as he did in 
scoring 43 points in a first-round win over Washington. 
</P>
<P>
	``No one individual can beat a team,'' Magloire said. ``Granted,  
he's a good player. But no one player can beat us. No one player 
can beat a team.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Smith said he did not plan any major changes to his basic  
containment defense for the third-round game against Miami, which 
is coming off an upset win over second-seeded Utah. 
</P>
<P>
	``We haven't used any gimmick defenses all year long,'' he said.  
``We're going to try to do something out of our regular man-to-man 
defense to try to limit his (Szczerbiak's) touches.'' 
</P>
<P>
	With Szczerbiak equally skilled at posting up and stepping  
outside for the perimeter jump shot, Smith said there is no glaring 
weakness for the Wildcats to attack. The coach said he likely will 
try several different players on Szczerbiak, including senior 
forwards Padgett and Evans. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't think there's any one thing you can do to shut him  
down,'' he said. ``We'll just try to deny him the ball as much as 
possible.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Smith and Padgett said there's more to Miami than Szczerbiak.  
Point guard Rob Mestas is a calm floor leader and skilled at 
distributing the ball, Smith said. Guard Damon Frierson is 
averaging 13.1 points, and the entire team is skilled at getting 
Szczerbiak open for shots. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think more than anything, they feed off of when other teams  
go to double Wally,'' Padgett said. ``They have a team. It's not 
just Wally.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Like Szczerbiak, the 6-foot-9 Padgett possesses inside-outside  
versatility, as he showed down the stretch in the Kansas game. He 
hit a 3-pointer that sent the game to overtime, nailed another long 
jumper to open the overtime and then went inside to get to the foul 
line and make five free throws in the extra session as Kentucky won 
92-88. 
</P>
<P>
	Padgett said he has tried to focus on his post play in recent  
games. 
</P>
<P>
	``The more I post up, the more opportunities I get to get to the  
free-throw line,'' he said.

<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Now that he's made a name for himself again at  
39, it's easy for Brian Setzer to realize what he did wrong when he 
was 21 and fronting the rockabilly Stray Cats. 
</P>
<P>
	``We were kids. What did we know? We'd say, `You're a manager?  
You're a lawyer? You've got a suit on. You look honest,''' he says 
in the upcoming issue of USA Weekend. ``We signed away everything. 
We got ripped off a lot.'' 
</P>

	Setzer, leading a swing revival, won two Grammys last month for  
his Dirty Boogie CD. For newcomers to swing, he recommends Count 
Basie, Bobby Darin and Louis Prima. 
</P>
<P>
	One thing that hasn't changed from his youth is his love of  
tattoos. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm going to do my back next,'' Setzer said. ``I'll just  
remember what my Dad said: `Never get a tattoo where a judge can 
see it. If you're ever before a judge and he sees a tattoo on your 
neck or hands, he'll brand you a criminal.'''

<HEADLINE>  Kerry Wood Won't Rush Comeback </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MESA, Ariz. (AP) -- Kerry Wood isn't sure if he'll be back with  
the Chicago Cubs for the 2000 season. 
</P>
<P>
	``I haven't even had the surgery yet. It's too early to think  
about when I'm going to be back,'' the NL Rookie of the Year said 
today upon his return to the Cubs' spring training camp. 
</P>
<P>
	Baseball's brightest young pitcher, whose fastball dazzled fans  
during his rookie season, will undergo ligament replacement surgery 
on his right elbow in the next two weeks. Rehabilitation is 
expected to take about a year. 
</P>
<P>
	Wood has worried about a major injury since he was 12 and  
watched Dave Dravecky's chilling injury in the middle of a pitch. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've thought about this from the first time I saw the video --  
I can't remember his name now -- he threw one pitch and his arm 
broke,'' Wood recalled during a news conference at HoHoKam Park. 
</P>
<P>
	The 21-year-old right-hander has had a tender elbow since the  
Cubs drafted him out of high school in 1995 and he missed all of 
last September while it was sore. 
</P>
<P>
	Wood returned to throw five innings in the Cubs' final playoff  
game against Atlanta, then was hospitalized twice at the start of 
spring training because of an upper respiratory and 
gastrointestinal illness. 
</P>
<P>
	The latest injury occurred Saturday, on the first warmup pitch  
of the second inning of his 1999 debut against Anaheim. He lasted 
26 pitches in all -- managing to throw 95 mph even after the injury. 
</P>
<P>
	``We were very, very conservative with Kerry,'' general manager  
Ed Lynch said. ``Whether this was bound to happen, I can't 
answer.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Wood didn't want to blame the injury on the way he's been  
handled, either in pro ball or before. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's safe to day it was inevitable,'' he said. ``From the time  
my velocity picked up and I started to throw harder, I felt it 
could happen on any give day,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Wood intends to get a second opinion and allow swelling to  
subside before going ahead with surgery. Dr. Lewis Yocum, the 
Anaheim Angels team physician, or Dr. James Andrews most likely 
will perform a ligament replacement, a procedure considered radical 
when Dr. Frank Jobe used it to save Tommy John's career in 1974, 
but now is commonplace. 
</P>
<P>
	``Thankfully, we live in a day and age when they can put us back  
together like an erector set,'' said Cubs pitcher Terry Mulholland, 
ensured a spot in the rotation because of the injury. 
</P>
<P>
	Wood, who struck out 20 against Houston last May 6 to tie Roger  
Clemens' record for a nine-inning game, was a big part of 
baseball's renaissance last season, going 13-6 with 3.40 ERA and 
233 strikeouts in 166 2-3 innings. 
</P>
<P>
	He not only was a key to the Cubs' pennant hopes, but had become  
one of baseball's top attractions. He was rewarded with a $690,000 
salary -- a record for a player with less than one year in the major 
leagues. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's too bad for him, too bad for baseball,'' Atlanta manager  
Bobby Cox said. ``I don't like to face the guy, but he's a special, 
special pitcher. We need those to come along in the game like that, 
who really pack them in.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Despite his promise, there was always the danger he would burn  
out too soon, such as Mark Fidrych and David Clyde. For now, the 
Cubs are positive Wood can rebound next year. 
</P>
<P>
	``I feel for him,'' reliever Rod Beck said. ``I think as a  
pitcher, every one of us has laid in bed with an ache and a pain 
thinking it's over.'' 
</P>
<P>
	It was the latest blow to baseball during a spring training that  
has seen Atlanta first baseman Andres Galarraga, New York Yankees 
manager Joe Torre and Florida infielder Mike Lowell diagnosed with 
cancer; Hall of Famer Joe DiMaggio die following lung cancer 
surgery; and Houston outfielder Moises Alou severely damage a knee. 
</P>
<P>
	Galarraga and Alou are out for the season, and Torre is expected  
to miss 1-3 months. Lowell already has returned. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think our players will take this as a challenge we will have  
to overcome, the same as Atlanta and Houston are doing,'' Cubs 
manager Jim Riggleman said. 
</P>
<P>
	Following the retirement of Michael Jordan, Wood and Sammy Sosa  
were Chicago's biggest sports stars. It's hard to see the Cubs, the 
lovable losers who haven't won a pennant since 1945 and a World 
Series since 1908, getting back to the playoffs without Wood, even 
if Sosa has another 66-homer season. 
</P>
<P>
	``We'll keep Sammy on the field -- put a glass case around him,''  
Beck said. 
</P>
<P>
	Several Cubs mentioned that Wood might benefit from having the  
surgery so early in his career. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've heard guys who had the ligament replacement say the  
ligament that's put in is stronger and more durable,'' Mulholland 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Cubs pitcher Jeremi Gonzalez had a ligament replaced by Yocum  
last Aug. 21 and is ahead of schedule, hoping to return during the 
first half of the season. 
</P>
<P>
	For now, the injury means the Cubs are left with a rotation of  
Steve Trachsel, Kevin Tapani, Mulholland and Jon Lieber, with Scott 
Sanders or Kurt Miller the top candidates for the fifth spot. While 
Kansas City's Kevin Appier is available and perhaps others, Lynch 
didn't seem inclined to make a trade. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think every club is looking for a pitcher,'' he said. ``We  
have the people to put in the rotation.''

<HEADLINE> Clinton Unhappy With Medicare Plan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- After a year of work, the commission charged  
with overhauling Medicare is poised to adjourn without making any 
formal recommendation. President Clinton said today the plan under 
consideration ``falls short'' of what's needed to reform the ailing 
health program. 
</P>
<P>
	Leaders of the commission promise to renew the fight for their  
ideas in Congress, and Clinton said he will propose a plan of his 
own. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think it is now incumbent on me to present an alternative  
proposal, and I will do that,'' Clinton said before departing for a 
fund-raising trip to Florida. He sternly denied that he was 
dismissing the commission's recommendations in order to give 
Democrats an issue to run on in 2000. 
</P>
<P>
	``Medicare is too important to let partisan progress stand in  
the way of vital progress. I believe if we make the hard choices, 
if we work together, if we act this year, we can secure Medicare 
into the future,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton said the proposed plan, which would inject competition  
into Medicare by letting senior citizens choose from a menu of 
options, included ``some very strong elements.'' But he added: ``I 
believe their approach falls short in several respects.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Specifically, he objected to a provision that would gradually  
raise the eligibility age from 65 to 67 and complained that it did 
not inject additional money into the program from the budget 
surplus. 
</P>
<P>
	The commission remains one vote shy of the 11 needed to make a  
formal recommendation to Congress. None of the four commissioners 
appointed by Clinton support it. 
</P>
<P>
	The panel, which includes Republicans, Democrats, members of  
Congress and private economists, hoped to rise above politics and 
offer Congress a blueprint for overhauling a program that has been 
a magnet for partisan warfare. 
</P>
<P>
	But in the end, the plan was largely supported by Republicans  
and backed by just two Democrats -- Louisiana Sen. John Breaux, the 
commission's chairman, and Sen. Bob Kerrey of Nebraska. 
</P>
<P>
	Breaux and his co-chairman, Rep. Bill Thomas, R-Calif., promised  
to fight for it in Congress, saying they hoped to move legislation 
this year that would make their ideas law even without commission 
endorsement. 
</P>
<P>
	``What do you do? Do you just cry about it or do you introduce  
legislation based on this?'' Breaux said Monday. ``What we've got 
is very important. ... We've changed the debate in a major, major 
way.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He predicted the plan would attract at least 60 votes in the  
Senate, enough to overcome any filibuster. Thomas was less 
confident about its prospects in the House, though he said there 
was substantial support. 
</P>
<P>
	Thomas has accused Clinton's appointees of bowing to White House  
pressure, but Clinton spokesman Barry Toiv said Monday that the 
president did nothing to influence them. 
</P>
<P>
	``But the president wants very much to achieve bipartisan reform  
this year,'' Toiv said. 
</P>
<P>
	Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott was skeptical of Clinton's  
intentions. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a sign to me that apparently he's going to try and  
politicize Medicare instead of introduce real reform,'' Lott said 
Monday on PBS' ``NewsHour With Jim Lehrer'' program. 
</P>
<P>
	Breaux defended his detractors, saying there was a ``legitimate  
policy disagreement'' with opponents. ``There's always the fear of 
the unknown,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Thomas was less charitable: ``The proposal we will present is,  
in fact, the only reasonable way to go.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Their plan would make Medicare more like health benefits that  
many companies and the federal government offer to workers. 
</P>
<P>
	Retirees could choose from a menu of health-insurance policies  
and get a subsidy to help cover the cost. The more expensive plans 
would require participants to pay more out of their own pockets. 
Meanwhile, the government-run system that serves most retirees now 
would compete with the private health plans, which would have to 
offer similar coverage. 
</P>
<P>
	The plan also would gradually raise the eligibility age from 65  
to 67. 
</P>
<P>
	One of the most contentious issues has been prescription drug  
coverage, which is not part of the 34-year-old, traditional 
Medicare plan. The plan would require private companies to offer at 
least one option that includes drug coverage. The popular private 
plans that supplement Medicare coverage, known as Medigap, would be 
required to offer drugs as well. 
</P>
<P>
	Drugs would be available through the traditional Medicare  
program too, but the elderly would have to pay for the extra cost. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton has proposed using 15 percent of the budget surplus to  
shore up Medicare, and he has suggested that the program add drug 
payments, though the details of his program are not clear. 
</P>
<P>
	The Breaux-Thomas plan does not anticipate funneling extra money  
into Medicare from the budget surplus. But the commission staff 
estimates that their plan would save the program $100 billion 
between 2000 and 2009 and enough to keep the program solvent 
through 2017. The program is now expected to go broke in about a 
decade -- just as the huge baby boom begins to retire.

<HEADLINE> Grant Fuhr Back in Goal for Blues </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ST. LOUIS (AP) -- Grant Fuhr is putting an end to the St. Louis  
Blues' goalie-go-round. 
</P>
<P>
	Fuhr missed 16 games after undergoing a second operation on his  
right knee in a year in February, and his absence created chaos in 
the nets. The Blues auditioned four possible replacements, 
including former Vezina Trophy winner Jim Carey. 
</P>
<P>
	That's all forgotten now that Fuhr is back. He's played in two  
of the past three games, both victories, and stopped 26 shots in a 
5-2 victory over the Philadelphia Flyers Tuesday night. 
</P>
<P>
	``Each night it's getting better,'' Fuhr said. ``I'm happy with  
the way it's going.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Blues played on consecutive days last weekend and Fuhr sat  
out a 5-2 victory at Chicago because of knee soreness. The rest of 
the season there are only two more back-to-back situations. 
</P>
<P>
	``The first game back, we didn't want to press the issue,''  
coach Joel Quenneville said. ``But looking the way he is, he's 
probably going to see a lot of action between now and the end of 
the year.'' 
</P>
<P>
	That's good news for Fuhr, who has played in 25 games thus far.  
</P>
<P>
	``If they want me to, yeah,'' Fuhr said. ``It'll be fine.''  
</P>
<P>
	Fuhr split duties with Jamie McLennan earlier in the season, but  
made seven straight starts during one stretch. He had the surgery 
after realizing he was hurting the team, but it hurt them anyway as 
McLennan, Rich Parent, Brent Johnson and Carey all took turns in 
goal. 
</P>
<P>
	Parent and Johnson each played well for a while but both are  
back in the minors. Carey won his first NHL game since 1997 
Saturday at Chicago, but has been shaky and was a healthy scratch 
Tuesday. McLennan was the backup Tuesday, but he also has fallen 
out of favor, with his last start Feb. 24. 
</P>
<P>
	Teammates are happy to have Fuhr, part of five Stanley Cup  
winners with the Edmonton Oilers during the 1980s and a six-time 
All-Star, back in the nets. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't know if relief is the right word, but there's a sense  
of stability back there,'' defenseman Al MacInnis said. ``There's a 
ripple effect with the defensemen when you know a guy can make a 
big save, you play with much more confidence.'' 
</P>
<P>
	MacInnis said the Blues can use the experience of Fuhr, who has  
played in 830 career games, down the stretch as they try to secure 
a playoff berth. St. Louis is 29-28-10 for sixth place in the 
Western Conference. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's as competitive and as fiery as anyone I've ever played  
with or against,'' MacInnis said. ``When he was with Edmonton, it 
was always the Gretzkys and the Messiers and the Coffeys, but this 
guy had as much to do with winning all those cups as anybody on 
that team.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Quenneville is happy to again have Fuhr.  
</P>
<P>
	``It looks like he's moving well and he's got some renewed  
energy,'' Quenneville said. ``He was playing with some pain, I 
think he addressed it, and he's better off for it. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think he's excited about the challenge our team is in and  
what he can do to help us.''

<HEADLINE> Ex-Army General Hale Is Sentenced </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	FORT LEWIS, Wash. (AP) -- A retired Army general was reprimanded  
Wednesday and fined $10,000 after pleading guilty to conduct 
unbecoming an officer for having affairs with four subordinates' 
wives. 
</P>
<P>
	Maj. Gen. David Hale, 53, smiled and hugged his attorney after  
the sentence was imposed, marking the end of his one-day 
court-martial in a case that led to allegations the Pentagon had a 
double standard for dealing with sexual misconduct. 
</P>
<P>
	Hale is the highest-ranking Army officer to be court-martialed  
since 1952. 
</P>
<P>
	Prosecutors had asked for a $125,000 fine to cover the cost of  
an investigation into one of Hale's liaisons and a $1,466-a-month 
deduction from Hale's $6,312-a-month pension. 
</P>
<P>
	Prosecutor Maj. Michael Mulligan also recommended a jail  
sentence, ``to send a message there is no difference ... between 
the lowliest private and a general.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Instead, the judge, Col. Stephen Saynisch, who had been  
restricted to certain maximum penalties by the commander of Fort 
Lewis, reprimanded Hale, fined him $10,000 and ordered him to 
forfeit $1,000 in monthly pay for a year. 
</P>
<P>
	``I cannot express adequately how sorry I am, how embarrassed I  
am, for the pain I have brought the U.S. Army, my fellow soldiers 
and my family and friends,'' Hale said, reading from a statement 
before the sentencing. 
</P>
<P>
	Donald Mancuso, the Defense Department inspector general who  
oversaw the initial investigation in Washington, D.C., said at a 
news conference that a high-profile case like Hale's does ``in fact 
cause officers to think twice.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Justice has in fact been served,'' he said.  
</P>
<P>
	Hale was allowed to retire with honor last year despite claims  
of improprieties he committed while he was a top NATO commander in 
southern Europe. The resulting furor led the Pentagon to change its 
rules to bar top officers from retiring while facing allegations of 
wrongdoing. 
</P>
<P>
	Hale pleaded guilty to seven counts of conduct unbecoming an  
officer and one count of making false official statements. In 
exchange, prosecutors dropped nine other charges. 
</P>
<P>
	If he had been convicted on the original charges, Hale could  
have faced 56 years in prison. 
</P>
<P>
	Hale was accused of having improper relationships with the wives  
of subordinate officers in Turkey from 1996 to 1998. Hale was 
legally separated from his wife in 1995 and divorced in 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	The four women were in troubled marriages, and Hale testified  
that he saw them socially in scuba diving clubs, bowling clubs and 
shopping trips, giving them money for phone calls and sending them 
flowers. 
</P>
<P>
	The allegations became public last year when The Washington  
Times reported that Donnamaria Carpino Madden had accused Hale of 
forcing her into a four-month sexual relationship in Turkey while 
her husband -- an Army colonel serving under Hale -- was posted 
there. 
</P>
<P>
	``Deceit, betrayal -- that's what this case is about,'' Mulligan  
said in closing arguments. ``There's nothing more reprehensible 
than to take advantage of soldiers' relationships with their 
wives.'' 
</P>
<P>
	At the time the allegations were raised, Hale had spent four  
months at the Pentagon as deputy inspector general for the Army. 
</P>
<P>
	When he was allowed to retire with honor, some congressmen  
complained of a double standard, since people of lower rank had 
been court-martialed in similar situations. 
</P>
<P>
	Last year, Sgt. Maj. Gene McKinney, then the Army's  
highest-ranking enlisted man, was reduced in rank and reprimanded 
after he was convicted of obstruction of justice in a sexual 
misconduct case. He was acquitted of 18 counts alleging sexual 
harassment of six military women. 
</P>
<P>
	In another case, Air Force Lt. Kelly Flinn, the nation's first  
and only female B-52 pilot, was given a general discharge after 
being charged with adultery for having an affair with the husband 
of a female airman in North Dakota. 
</P>
<P>
	The only other case in which an Army general faced court-martial  
since Congress enacted the Uniform Code of Military Justice in 1951 
was in 1952, when Maj. Gen. Robert W. Grow, military attache in 
Moscow, was tried on charges of dereliction of duty. He was 
reprimanded and suspended from command for six months.

<HEADLINE> Colleges Seek To Improve Teaching </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Colleges need to improve teacher training  
programs to improve the quality of teachers, a panel of educators 
says. 
</P>
<P>
	The American Association of State Colleges and Universities task  
force, which conducted a study of teacher-education programs, will 
observe campus programs for about five years and evaluate the 
graduates to see whether its recommendations work. 
</P>
<P>
	The task force's report, released today, suggests nationwide  
changes in training, including more aggressive recruitment of top 
students, increased pay for professors and graduates and better 
coordination with academic programs outside schools of education. 
</P>
<P>
	One of the study's findings is that teacher-education programs  
haven't been as well-financed as other academic programs. 
</P>
<P>
	``It has been a cheap program on too many campuses for too  
long,'' said John Van de Wetering, vice president of the college 
group. ``There hasn't been the kind of investment to sustain the 
quality program we're talking about here.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Other on-campus academic programs can help schools of education  
train better teachers, the report says. A history department, for 
example, can offer them ideas on preparing a well-rounded social 
studies program. 
</P>
<P>
	And teacher-education programs need better cooperation from  
schools teaching kindergarten through 12th grade, the report said. 
For example, school districts should guard against having teachers 
teach outside their subject areas. 
</P>
<P>
	The task force also noted that teacher pay is lower than many  
other professions, hurting chances of attracting and keeping good 
candidates. 
</P>
<P>
	``After graduation, there are a lot of things that can't be  
accomplished by schools of education,'' said Van de Wetering. 
``Most of those reforms must go on simultaneously if we are to 
change the status of the profession and add to its prestige.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The task force, which included college and university presidents  
and chancellors who surveyed studies of the nation's colleges, also 
recommended that: 
</P>
<P>
	--Colleges work with public schools to improve employment  
conditions and establish professional development programs. 
</P>
<P>
	--Teachers be thoroughly prepared in the subject matters they  
will teach. 
</P>
<P>
	--Programs work to increase their ethnic diversity.  
</P>
<P>
	--Teachers be prepared to educate children from diverse cultures  
and adequately use classroom technology.

<HEADLINE> Mom Accused of Burning Son </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	OAKLAND, Calif. (AP) -- A woman has been arrested for allegedly  
lighting her 7-year-old son's shirt on fire because he was 
misbehaving. 
</P>
<P>
	Catrina Simms, 29, was arrested and jailed Monday for  
investigation of assault with a deadly weapon. 
</P>
<P>
	The boy suffered second- and third-degree burns on the left side  
of his stomach and back, police said. He was taken to Children's 
Hospital in Oakland, where he was treated and released. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's just disturbing, plain and simple,'' Sgt. Arturo Bautista  
said. ``If this is indeed the case, it's unbelievable.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Simms, 29, was returning from a party with her two young  
sons and her sister when she burned the boy, Bautista said. Ms. 
Simms allegedly slapped the boy while they were in the car. 
</P>
<P>
	``At some point, the mother takes out a lighter and lights his  
shirt on fire,'' Bautista said. 
</P>
<P>
	The boy ran into his aunt's home, where somebody put out the  
fire. Ms. Simms later surrendered.

<HEADLINE> Grain, Soybeans Futures Move Higher / Board of Trade  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- Grain futures and soybeans were mostly higher in  
early dealings today on the Chicago Board of Trade. 
</P>
<P>
	Soybeans were higher on carry-over strength from Tuesday's  
close, when prices rallied on reports the government may designate 
more land in a conservation set-aside program. That speculation was 
providing limited support today amid confusion as to whether such 
changes will occur this year. 
</P>
<P>
	Both soy meal and soy oil prices were higher today, as well.  
Wheat futures were higher today after also drawing a boost from 
Tuesday's late reports. Corn was unchanged to slightly higher with 
little news to move the market. 
</P>
<P>
	Wheat for May delivery was up 2 1/2 cents to $2.79 a bushel; May  
corn was unchanged at $2.23 3/4 a bushel; May oats were up 3/4 cent to 
$1.11 1/4 a bushel; May soybeans were up 1 1/4 cents to $4.84 a bushel. 
</P>
<P>
	Live cattle and feeder cattle futures were mixed on the Chicago  
Mercantile Exchange today, while lean hogs were lower and pork 
bellies higher. 
</P>
<P>
	April live cattle futures rose 0.02 cent to 66.77 cents a pound;  
March feeder cattle was down 0.02 cent to 71.95 cents per pound; 
April lean hogs were up 0.03 cent to 40.95 cents a pound; and May 
pork bellies were off 0.47 cent to 50.65 cents per pound.

<HEADLINE> Barnicle Hired by Sunday Daily News </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Mike Barnicle, who was forced to resign from The  
Boston Globe after being accused of fabricating a column, has been 
hired by the Sunday Daily News. 
</P>
<P>
	The two-fisted, close-to-the-streets columnist will write a  
weekly opinion piece for the Sunday paper. 
</P>
<P>
	``Mike's one of the great columnists in America and I think he's  
paid his dues,'' Edward Kosner, editor of the Sunday Daily News, 
said Tuesday. ``If everyone in journalism who ever made a mistake 
never got another chance, none of us would be working.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Barnicle, 55, resigned from The Globe in August after he was  
accused of making up a 1995 tearjerker of a column about two young 
cancer patients -- one black, one white -- who became friends while 
hospitalized. After the black child died, the parents of the white 
child gave the dead child's parents $10,000, Barnicle wrote. 
</P>
<P>
	He later admitted there were errors in the story: Both children  
were white, they were heart patients, and only $5,000 was given. 
But he denied making it up. 
</P>
<P>
	Kosner said Barnicle would write on a broad range of topics from  
his Massachusetts home. He said Barnicle has no plans to move to 
New York but will visit frequently. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's got a much broader scope than that,'' Kosner said. ``He's  
not going to be writing about Boston, except maybe the Boston Red 
Sox and the New York Yankees.'' 
</P>
<P>
	His first column will appear on March 28. Barnicle said only:  
``Whatever I have to say, I'll say it in the paper.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Barnicle worked at The Globe for 25 years and was known for his  
stories on blue-collar types, civil servants and Boston's poor. He 
underwent heart surgery in October and since leaving The Globe has 
worked as a contributing reporter for a show aired an ABC station 
in Boston. 
</P>
<P>
	Back when the controversy at the Globe was raging, New York  
Times editorial page editor Howell Raines wrote that the Globe was 
right in asking for Barnicle's resignation. The Times and The Globe 
are owned by the same company. 
</P>
<P>
	Raines said Barnicle had been ``the beneficiary of a vigorous  
public-relations campaign among the profession's old-boy network.''

<HEADLINE>  Kerry Wood Won't Rush Comeback </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MESA, Ariz. (AP) -- Kerry Wood isn't sure if he'll be back with  
the Chicago Cubs for the 2000 season. 
</P>
<P>
	``I haven't even had the surgery yet. It's too early to think  
about when I'm going to be back,'' the NL Rookie of the Year said 
today upon his return to the Cubs' spring training camp. 
</P>
<P>
	Baseball's brightest young pitcher, whose fastball dazzled fans  
during his rookie season, will undergo ligament replacement surgery 
on his right elbow in the next two weeks. Rehabilitation is 
expected to take about a year. 
</P>
<P>
	Wood has worried about a major injury since he was 12 and  
watched Dave Dravecky's chilling injury in the middle of a pitch. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've thought about this from the first time I saw the video --  
I can't remember his name now -- he threw one pitch and his arm 
broke,'' Wood recalled during a news conference at HoHoKam Park. 
</P>
<P>
	The 21-year-old right-hander has had a tender elbow since the  
Cubs drafted him out of high school in 1995 and he missed all of 
last September while it was sore. 
</P>
<P>
	Wood returned to throw five innings in the Cubs' final playoff  
game against Atlanta, then was hospitalized twice at the start of 
spring training because of an upper respiratory and 
gastrointestinal illness. 
</P>
<P>
	The latest injury occurred Saturday, on the first warmup pitch  
of the second inning of his 1999 debut against Anaheim. He lasted 
26 pitches in all -- managing to throw 95 mph even after the injury. 
</P>
<P>
	``We were very, very conservative with Kerry,'' general manager  
Ed Lynch said. ``Whether this was bound to happen, I can't 
answer.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Wood didn't want to blame the injury on the way he's been  
handled, either in pro ball or before. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's safe to day it was inevitable,'' he said. ``From the time  
my velocity picked up and I started to throw harder, I felt it 
could happen on any give day,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Wood intends to get a second opinion and allow swelling to  
subside before going ahead with surgery. Dr. Lewis Yocum, the 
Anaheim Angels team physician, or Dr. James Andrews most likely 
will perform a ligament replacement, a procedure considered radical 
when Dr. Frank Jobe used it to save Tommy John's career in 1974, 
but now is commonplace. 
</P>
<P>
	``Thankfully, we live in a day and age when they can put us back  
together like an erector set,'' said Cubs pitcher Terry Mulholland, 
ensured a spot in the rotation because of the injury. 
</P>
<P>
	Wood, who struck out 20 against Houston last May 6 to tie Roger  
Clemens' record for a nine-inning game, was a big part of 
baseball's renaissance last season, going 13-6 with 3.40 ERA and 
233 strikeouts in 166 2-3 innings. 
</P>
<P>
	He not only was a key to the Cubs' pennant hopes, but had become  
one of baseball's top attractions. He was rewarded with a $690,000 
salary -- a record for a player with less than one year in the major 
leagues. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's too bad for him, too bad for baseball,'' Atlanta manager  
Bobby Cox said. ``I don't like to face the guy, but he's a special, 
special pitcher. We need those to come along in the game like that, 
who really pack them in.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Despite his promise, there was always the danger he would burn  
out too soon, such as Mark Fidrych and David Clyde. For now, the 
Cubs are positive Wood can rebound next year. 
</P>
<P>
	``I feel for him,'' reliever Rod Beck said. ``I think as a  
pitcher, every one of us has laid in bed with an ache and a pain 
thinking it's over.'' 
</P>
<P>
	It was the latest blow to baseball during a spring training that  
has seen Atlanta first baseman Andres Galarraga, New York Yankees 
manager Joe Torre and Florida infielder Mike Lowell diagnosed with 
cancer; Hall of Famer Joe DiMaggio die following lung cancer 
surgery; and Houston outfielder Moises Alou severely damage a knee. 
</P>
<P>
	Galarraga and Alou are out for the season, and Torre is expected  
to miss 1-3 months. Lowell already has returned. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think our players will take this as a challenge we will have  
to overcome, the same as Atlanta and Houston are doing,'' Cubs 
manager Jim Riggleman said. 
</P>
<P>
	Following the retirement of Michael Jordan, Wood and Sammy Sosa  
were Chicago's biggest sports stars. It's hard to see the Cubs, the 
lovable losers who haven't won a pennant since 1945 and a World 
Series since 1908, getting back to the playoffs without Wood, even 
if Sosa has another 66-homer season. 
</P>
<P>
	``We'll keep Sammy on the field -- put a glass case around him,''  
Beck said. 
</P>
<P>
	Several Cubs mentioned that Wood might benefit from having the  
surgery so early in his career. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've heard guys who had the ligament replacement say the  
ligament that's put in is stronger and more durable,'' Mulholland 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Cubs pitcher Jeremi Gonzalez had a ligament replaced by Yocum  
last Aug. 21 and is ahead of schedule, hoping to return during the 
first half of the season. 
</P>
<P>
	For now, the injury means the Cubs are left with a rotation of  
Steve Trachsel, Kevin Tapani, Mulholland and Jon Lieber, with Scott 
Sanders or Kurt Miller the top candidates for the fifth spot. While 
Kansas City's Kevin Appier is available and perhaps others, Lynch 
didn't seem inclined to make a trade. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think every club is looking for a pitcher,'' he said. ``We  
have the people to put in the rotation.''

<HEADLINE> America West Airlines Faces Strike </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PHOENIX (AP) -- America West Airlines and its flight attendants  
resumed talks Wednesday in a last-ditch effort to avoid a strike or 
shutdown that could strand tens of thousands of travelers this 
weekend. 
</P>
<P>
	Negotiators met in so-called super-mediation with a member of  
the National Mediation Board for seven hours Wednesday and were to 
meet again Thursday, just a day before the end of a cooling-off 
period expires at 12:01 a.m. EST Saturday. Neither side would 
comment when the session ended Wednesday night. 
</P>
<P>
	The airline's 2,300 flight attendants say they will stage a  
series of random, unannounced work stoppages -- dubbed CHAOS for 
``Creating Havoc Around Our System'' -- after the deadline expires 
if there is no agreement. 
</P>
<P>
	``We hope all this mystery will make the company consider the  
impact going into the negotiations,'' said Jeff Zack, a spokesman 
for the Association of Flight Attendants. ``Until now all they've 
had to think about is unhappy flight attendants and that hasn't 
seemed to matter.'' 
</P>
<P>
	America West, the nation's ninth-largest carrier, with hubs in  
Phoenix, Las Vegas and Columbus, Ohio, has said it may shut down 
the airline rather than submit to the flight attendants' plan. 
</P>
<P>
	That could leave more than 100,000 passengers stranded over the  
weekend. 
</P>
<P>
	Michael Boyd, an airline analyst from Golden, Colo., said he  
doubts the airline will follow through with its grounding threat. 
</P>
<P>
	``Sure, CHAOS is very disruptive, but by shutting the whole  
airline, (the company) would anger not just some, but all 
passengers, and not just the flight attendants, but all employees. 
I don't think it's really an option,'' Boyd said. 
</P>
<P>
	What's more, he said, a shutdown would be a huge loss to  
shareholders of America West Holdings Corp., of which America West 
is the major component. 
</P>
<P>
	A shutdown by America West, which carries only about 3 percent  
of the nation's passenger traffic, would be unlikely to snarl air 
traffic as much as the sickout by pilots last month at AMR Corp.'s 
American Airlines. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, a shutdown or a strike by the Tempe, Ariz.-based carrier  
could wreak havoc on cities like neighboring Phoenix, where America 
West accounts for more than 40 percent of all traffic and Las 
Vegas, where the airline is second only to Dallas-based Southwest 
Airlines. 
</P>
<P>
	For Phoenix, the strike deadline falls on a weekend when college  
basketball fans are converging on the city for the NCAA basketball 
tournament, joining baseball fans already feasting on Major League 
spring training, sun-seeking golfers and students on spring break. 
</P>
<P>
	Las Vegas, too, could be hit hard as it prepares for the arrival  
of an estimated 110,000 people for a construction industry trade 
show that opens Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	America West serves 53 domestic destinations overall and eight  
cities in Mexico and Canada. 
</P>
<P>
	The labor dispute between America West and its flight attendants  
has been brewing for more than four years. 
</P>
<P>
	Its attendants have been working without a contract since voting  
to unionize in 1994, three years after America West filed for 
Bankruptcy Court protection from creditors and employees took pay 
cuts. 
</P>
<P>
	``The (union) members want the company to put dollars on the  
table that show a commitment to the future and sacrifices of the 
past,'' said union President Bill McGlashen. 
</P>
<P>
	About two-thirds of America West's flight attendants earn the  
top-scale salary of $23,800. Top-scale flight attendants at rival 
Southwest Airlines earn $41,200. 
</P>
<P>
	The flight attendants also want the same daily expenses pilots  
receive, $1.80 an hour away from their base city. Currently, the 
attendants get no per diem. 
</P>
<P>
	In a letter to flight attendants in February, America West  
Chairman William Franke said the company could not meet union 
demands without compromising its competitive position. 
</P>
<P>
	But with the company posting record profits of $108.6 million  
last year -- up 45 percent from the previous record of $75 million 
in 1997 -- the union is adamant that the company can improve its 
offer, and as a result, make up for lost time and pay. 
</P>
<P>
	Stephen Cabot, a management labor relations attorney who has  
represented airlines in past disputes, said airlines like America 
West have not done an effective job conveying to employees that 
profits may appear greater than they are, after calculating for 
debts and past losses. 
</P>
<P>
	Further, airlines don't know when the gravy train will end, he  
said. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's too little and too late when one tries to educate  
(employees) during negotiations. When emotions get to this peak, 
people don't hear. That leads to greater emotions until there is an 
outlet,'' Cabot said.

<HEADLINE> Judge: Internet Name Co. Protected </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- The private company that registers Internet  
names as part of an agreement with the federal government has 
antitrust protection, a Manhattan federal judge ruled Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	The decision by U.S. District Judge Robert P. Patterson comes  
after other federal courts have reached similar conclusions in 
challenges to Network Solutions Inc., which since 1993 has had sole 
governmental authority to register names on the Internet. 
</P>
<P>
	As the popularity of computers has increased, the registering of  
names by companies seeking to sell and advertise products over the 
Internet has become a key business strategy. 
</P>
<P>
	Wednesday's ruling against Manhattan-based PGMedia Inc. provides  
the most thorough legal analysis to date of the right of Network 
Solutions to retain its monopoly on registering Internet names for 
now. 
</P>
<P>
	Patterson said the company, based in the Washington D.C. suburb  
of Herndon, Va., is entitled to antitrust protection while it 
operates on behalf of the government. The company was assigned its 
registration tasks by the National Science Foundation. 
</P>
<P>
	The judge also ruled that the free speech rights of PGMedia were  
not violated because Internet addresses are more like telephone 
numbers than speech. 
</P>
<P>
	Network Solution's victory, however, is likely be short-lived.  
In May, five companies -- including Network Solutions -- are 
scheduled to begin competing in name registration services.

<HEADLINE> Asian Stock Markets Close Mixed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HONG KONG (AP) -- Asian markets closed mixed Wednesday, with the  
Tokyo bourse rising for the third day to nearly an eight-month high 
on optimism about corporate restructuring moves. 
</P>
<P>
	The recent rally on Wall Street also buoyed sentiment in the  
region. The Dow Jones industrial average crossed the 10,000-point 
mark briefly for the first time Tuesday, though it was unable to 
hold that record level. 
</P>
<P>
	Tokyo's benchmark 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average gained 195.29  
points, or 1.22 percent, to close at 16,268.11 -- its highest close 
since July 31. On Tuesday, the average rose 293.22 points, or 1.86 
percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Foreign investors, encouraged by signs that corporate Japan is  
cutting costs and hoping that a recovery may be just around the 
corner, were buying up Japanese shares. 
</P>
<P>
	In currency dealings, the U.S. dollar climbed amid speculation  
that Japanese finance officials were anxious to hold down the yen. 
</P>
<P>
	In late trading, the dollar bought 118.64 yen, up 0.80 yen from  
late Tuesday in Tokyo and above its late New York level of 117.79 
yen overnight. 
</P>
<P>
	In Hong Kong, the recent market rally hasn't let up, with  
Wednesday's rise fueled by renewed interest in companies with close 
ties to mainland China. Demand for these shares had dipped since 
massive loan problems in China came to light in recent months. 
</P>
<P>
	The blue-chip Hang Seng Index ended up 28.82 points, or 0.3  
percent, at 10,940.07. The index had gained 0.7 percent Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	In Jakarta, shares got a strong boost from the country's latest  
accord with the International Monetary Fund, with the JSX Composite 
Index gaining 8.428 points, or 2.2 percent, to 387.881. 
</P>
<P>
	Under Indonesia's new letter of intent, the government stood by  
its forecast of a ``modest recovery'' in the second half of the 
year, with flat growth in the first half leading up to landmark 
multiparty elections in June. 
</P>
<P>
	In Taipei, the key index ended at another 12-week high on  
renewed confidence in semiconductor stocks, which are showing signs 
of recovery from a three-year slump. 
</P>
<P>
	The Weighted Price Index rose 84.84 points, or 1.27 percent, to  
6,757.07, the highest close since 6,782.68 on Dec. 22. 
</P>
<P>
	Singapore, however, closed lower amid disappointing results in a  
corporate reporting season that will end later this month. Late 
Wednesday, government-linked DBS Land Ltd., one of Singapore's 
largest property companies, reported an expected large loss. 
</P>
<P>
	The Straits Times Index fell 19.38 points, or 1.3 percent, to  
1,470.16. 
</P>
<P>
	Elsewhere:  
</P>
<P>
	BANGKOK: Thai shares rose in light trading as investors stayed  
on the sidelines in anticipation of new government measures to 
revive the economy. The SET index rose 1.85 points, or 0.52 
percent, to 356.80. 
</P>
<P>
	KUALA LUMPUR: Malaysian shares fell, but the index managed to  
stay above the much-eyed 500 level thanks to local buying. The 
Kuala Lumpur Composite Index slipped 0.05 point to end at 511.85. 
</P>
<P>
	MANILA: Philippine shares rose slightly as liquidity improved.  
The PSE index gained 0.95 point, or 0.05 percent, to close at 
1,982.79. 
</P>
<P>
	SEOUL: South Korean shares fell after several sessions of gains.  
The Kospi index fell 1.31 points, or 0.22 percent, to 600.52. 
</P>
<P>
	SYDNEY: Australia's All Ordinaries Index flirted with a  
psychologically significant record high, but soon lost momentum 
because of a 2.5 percent drop in telecommunications giant Telstra 
Corp. The index fell to 2,977.8, down 14.4 points, or 0.48 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	WELLINGTON: New Zealand's NZSE-40 capital index was dragged down  
by market heavyweight Telecom Corp. of New Zealand Ltd. The index 
fell 12.41 points, or 0.57 percent, to 2,169.91.

<HEADLINE> Japan Stocks Close Sharply Lower / Japanese Stocks  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TOKYO (AP) -- Japanese stocks plunged Thursday as investors took  
profits following a recent dramatic rally. The dollar was lower 
against the yen. 
</P>
<P>
	The benchmark 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average fell 550.19 points,  
or 3.38 percent, to finish the day at 15,717.92. On Wednesday, the 
average closed up 195.29 points, or 1.22 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	The dollar bought 118.54 yen in afternoon trading, down 0.10 yen  
from late Wednesday in Tokyo but above its late New York level of 
118.01 yen overnight. 
</P>
<P>
	On the stock market, prices fell sharply on profit-taking  
following recent sharp gains and an overnight fall on Wall Street. 
</P>
<P>
	The Nikkei average had gained some 750 points in the last three  
trading days on continued foreign buying amid a sense the Japanese 
economy is gradually bottoming out. 
</P>
<P>
	In New York, the Dow Jones industrial average fell 51.06 points  
to 9,879.41 at Wednesday's close, a day after briefly passing the 
10,000 milestone. 
</P>
<P>
	The broader Tokyo Stock Price Index of all issues listed on the  
first section fell 28.85 points, or 2.29 percent, to 1,231.24 
points. The TOPIX closed up 19.20 points, or 1.55 percent, the day 
before. 
</P>
<P>
	In currency dealings, the dollar moved higher from its overnight  
New York level as strong buying interest from Japanese 
institutional investors remained in the market. 
</P>
<P>
	Traders said dollar-buying followed a persistent market rumor  
that Eisuke Sakakibara, Japan's influential vice finance minister 
for international affairs, told some Japanese trust banks and 
institutional investors Tuesday evening that they should buy the 
U.S. currency and invest in foreign bonds. 
</P>

<HEADLINE> Gore Pushes Down-Home Image in Iowa </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- When Vice President Al Gore opened his Iowa  
campaign this week, his privileged upbringing as the son of a 
senator was nowhere in sight. Instead, he talked about how he 
slopped hogs, drove mules, built homes and cleared land -- by hand 
and with a double-bladed ax, no less. 
</P>
<P>
	The man running for president was a boy who lived and was  
schooled in the rarefied air of Washington, spending summers and 
congressional breaks on the family farm in Tennessee. But as far as 
Iowans could tell, it was all sweat and no refinement. 
</P>
<P>
	Solid and savvy by reputation, Gore goes into his presidential  
campaign with a thus-far small but nagging question -- is he also 
one to embellish his past? 
</P>
<P>
	To his defenders, a misstep here and there is inconsequential in  
such a long run under the public eye. To critics, he has shown a 
vain streak likely to become increasingly exposed in the rough and 
tumble of the emerging campaign. 
</P>
<P>
	If Gore has a tendency toward puffery, it has yet to register  
with the public. When pollster Andrew Kohut of the Pew Research 
Center asks people for quick characterizations of the vice 
president, he gets a mix like 'good,' 'boring,' 'OK,' 'unexciting,' 
and 'stable.' 
</P>
<P>
	Gore laid it on thick in Iowa, contending in a round of  
appearances and interviews that he was a small-business person and 
a homebuilder. ``I lived on a farm,'' he went on, and learned how 
to plow a ``steep hillside'' with mules, hose out the hog waste and 
``take up hay all day long in the hot sun.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Gore's staff was asked to elaborate on his past but a spokesman  
was not immediately available. 
</P>
<P>
	His ruminations were meant to contrast himself with rival Bill  
Bradley, the former pro basketball player. The last time Gore tried 
to draw distinctions with Bradley, a week earlier, he overstepped. 
</P>
<P>
	Republicans threw gleeful barbs when Gore suggested then that  
he'd created the Internet, that huge, amorphous communications 
vehicle that got rolling long before he entered politics. More than 
a year ago, he claimed he and his wife were models for the romantic 
novel ``Love Story,'' leaving the author of that book 
``befuddled.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The ribbing over the Internet claim was playful, but the GOP  
obviously senses future opportunity to hammer the early favorite 
for the Democratic nomination. 
</P>
<P>
	``Earnest boastfulness does not play well,'' said William  
Kristol, editor of the conservative Weekly Standard magazine. As 
former chief of staff for Vice President Dan Quayle, Kristol has 
painful personal knowledge of how a public figure's blunders can 
blow up in one's face. 
</P>
<P>
	``Certain gaffes hurt when they fit into a stereotype,'' he  
said. ``I think Gore's comment taking credit for the Internet is an 
example of that. I think it's a damaging gaffe because it 
reinforces something out there.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Andrei Cherny, senior speechwriter for Gore in 1997 and 1998,  
disputes that view. He also contends Gore, whose stiffness is the 
stuff of self-parody, won't become even more so out of fear of 
saying something silly. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's been in public life for almost a quarter century now and  
has been under a great deal of scrutiny for at least the past seven 
years,'' said Cherny, now editing a magazine of Democratic ideas 
called Blueline. ``I think in many ways he is who he is, and that's 
not going to change because of a bit of a good-natured ribbing 
because of one stray remark.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Gore's claim to have coined the phrase ``information  
superhighway'' has not been seriously challenged, and he was an 
early and enthusiastic supporter in Congress of communications 
technology. But a father of the Internet? Histories of cyberspace 
barely mention him, if at all. 
</P>
<P>
	In December 1997, Gore told a reporter he and Tipper Gore were  
models for the characters in ``Love Story,'' Erich Segal's 1970s 
bestseller. A surprised Segal said Gore, whom he knew at Harvard, 
inspired one side of his male hero's personality -- the one 
controlled by a domineering father -- but his book had nothing to do 
with Mrs. Gore. 
</P>
<P>
	Back in his 1988 campaign for the presidential nomination, Gore  
defended his use of a brochure with a picture of him carrying an 
M-16 rifle in Vietnam, denying he was trying to make people think 
he served in combat. He had also appeared in TV ads wearing an 
olive-green field jacket and saying: ``I'm a Vietnam veteran -- one 
of the lucky ones.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Gore spent five months in Vietnam as a military information  
officer, a noncombat role that he says included brushes with enemy 
fire. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1988, he said he helped develop a subdivision on his father's  
land over several years starting in 1969, a period when he was also 
attending university and working as a journalist. Gore ``came by a 
time or two, but not too often,'' the contractor for the nine-house 
project told The Philadelphia Inquirer in 1988. 
</P>
<P>
	Gore responded then that he had helped lay out the subdivision,  
pick blueprints, negotiate with county officials and test soil, 
among other duties.

<HEADLINE> Reports Says Blue Jays Fire Manager </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TORONTO (AP) -- Tim Johnson, whose managerial career was derailed  
by lies about his military service in Vietnam, has been fired by 
the Blue Jays, a Toronto radio station reported today. 
</P>
<P>
	CJCL-The Fan, an all-sports station that broadcasted the Jays'  
games until losing the rights recently to Headline Sports, quoted 
sources saying Johnson will be replaced by former Philadelphia and 
California manager Jim Fregosi. The station said the Jays, 3-12 in 
spring training, fired Johnson at 1 a.m. EST. 
</P>
<P>
	A spokesman for the team in Dunedin, Fla., would not confirm or  
deny the report. 
</P>
<P>
	Johnson was about to start his second year managing the American  
League team. 
</P>
<P>
	The former U.S. Marine was the hand-picked choice of general  
manager Gord Ash, who bypassed more experienced managers such as 
Davey Johnson in replacing Cito Gaston. 
</P>
<P>
	The Jays stumbled out of the gate, but finished strongly last  
season. But Tim Johnson was surrounded by controversy when it was 
revealed his war stories about Vietnam were false. A conflict with 
veteran pitching coach Mel Queen also ensued. 
</P>
<P>
	Johnson taught mortar training to recruits going to Vietnam, but  
never served there. He issued a public apology, met individually 
with reporters to discuss his problem and said he was seeking 
counseling. 
</P>
<P>
	But the issue never went away and Johnson was dogged with  
questions wherever he went.

	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Republicans pushed a $1.74 trillion budget for  
fiscal 2000 through a House committee Wednesday. By a 22-18 
party-line vote, the House Budget Committee approved a spending 
plan by Chairman John Kasich, R-Ohio, that promises to leave Social 
Security surpluses alone while reducing taxes and increasing 
defense, education and several other programs. Simultaneously, the 
Senate Budget Committee moved toward approving a similar plan.

	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Energy Secretary Bill Richardson imposed new  
security measures for national weapons laboratories Wednesday and 
ordered an internal investigation into whether a department 
official was prevented from briefing Congress on alleged Chinese 
espionage. Richardson outlined the new measures in a closed-door 
hearing of the Senate Intelligence Committee. The committee was

when it first learned of an inquiry into the alleged Chinese theft 
of top-secret nuclear warhead technology from the Los Alamos 
National Laboratory in the 1980s.

	BOURBONNAIS, Ill. (AP) -- Investigators are analyzing tire tracks  
in the mud to determine whether the truck driver at the center of a 
deadly Amtrak crash had tried to go around the crossing gates and 
beat the train. The crash between the tractor-trailer and Amtrak's 
City of New Orleans killed 11 people Monday night in the nation's 
deadliest train wreck in three years. Tire marks were found on the 
road, on timbers at the crossing and in the mud along the shoulder 
of the road, said Bob Lauby, director of the National 
Transportation Safety Board's office of railroad safety.

	African Life Expectancy Cut by AIDS

	WASHINGTON (AP) -- AIDS has cut the average life expectancy in  
Zimbabwe by a quarter-century, the U.S. Census Bureau reports. Life 
expectancy in Zimbabwe is now 39 years, down from 65 were it not 
for the AIDS epidemic, the bureau said in a report being released 
Thursday. Other African nations also have experienced significant 
reductions in life expectancy because of AIDS. ``AIDS results in 
higher mortality rates in childhood, as well as among young adults 
where mortality otherwise is low,'' said a contributing author of 
the Census Bureau's new report, ``World Population Profile: 1998.''

jet stream over the eastern Caribbean, the control center said. The 
pilots, Brian Jones of England and Bertrand Piccard of Switzerland, 
hope to reach the North African coast at Mauritania, perhaps by 
Saturday evening. If they make it, the pair will have conquered one 
of the last great challenges facing aviators. Jones and Piccard

more than 4 billion years ago, researchers reported Thursday in the 
journal Nature. California Institute of Technology scientists who 
tuned radio telescopes onto the comet's nucleus as it cut across 
the solar system in 1997 found vents spewing a volatile mixture of 
gas and dust into space. Comets are often called dirty snowballs. 
Most orbit far from the sun in the deep freeze beyond Pluto's

<HEADLINE> Investigator Sparks Amtrak Spat </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The chief federal investigator of a deadly  
train wreck in Illinois touched off a public squabble Wednesday 
with Amtrak, accusing the passenger railroad of hampering efforts 
to determine whom had died and was still missing. 
</P>
<P>
	Amtrak denied it had been anything less than completely  
cooperative since Monday night's fatal collision between the City 
of New Orleans and a semitrailer truck about 50 miles south of 
Chicago. 
</P>
<P>
	And National Transportation Safety Board member John Goglia  
later backpedaled from his earlier criticism. ``It would be 
inappropriate to leave the impression that Amtrak was failing in 
its duties to passengers,'' he said in a statement issued at NTSB's 
headquarters here. 
</P>
<P>
	Goglia earlier had told reporters near the crash site in  
Bourbonnais, Ill., that he was ``very concerned'' about how long it 
took Amtrak to get an accurate list of those on board. 
</P>
<P>
	He also revised the death count down to 11 from 13. And by  
Wednesday night all 216 people abroad by the plane had been 
accounted for. 
</P>
<P>
	Earlier, at a news conference in Bourbonnais, Goglia had said  
there was ``a wide gulf between many of the documents provided us 
by Amtrak with how many passengers were on the (train) and how many 
are missing still today. At this point, all that I can say is that 
all of that is unreliable.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Amtrak spokeswoman Noreen Ellis reacted with surprise, saying  
Amtrak had worked ``around the clock'' to give the NTSB accurate 
and extensive information. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're doing everything we can to cooperate fully,'' she said.  
</P>
<P>
	In a statement, the passenger rail line said, ``In response to a  
public comment from an NTSB official, Amtrak has made an official 
request for clarification about what further information may be 
needed.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Amtrak also said it is trying to help passengers and families of  
those aboard the fated train by assigning two company 
representatives to each victim's family, paying for relatives' 
travel, hotels, limousine service, clothing, meals and 
long-distance expenses, bringing clergy members and other hometown 
support to the scene, and providing professional grief counselors. 
</P>
<P>
	Goglia then recanted. In the statement NTSB headquarters, he  
said he had met with Amtrak officials and was satisfied with its 
efforts to provide information. 
</P>
<P>
	NTSB spokesman Jamie Finch said Amtrak had been working hard to  
get the most up-to-date manifest possible, but that confusion arose 
when later editions were not distributed to everyone at the site. 
</P>
<P>
	But Finch said that the issue of getting passenger manifests  
after disasters -- difficult in railroad crashes because of trains' 
many entry and exit points -- will be one of the key topics of 
post-accident discussion for the NTSB. 
</P>
<P>
	Goglia had suggested that new federal rules to ensure railroads  
quickly and sensitively get information to families of disaster 
victims could mirror those enacted over the last three years for 
the aviation industry. 
</P>
<P>
	``That is an issue we are going to look into,'' Goglia said.  
</P>
<P>
	Legislation passed by Congress in 1996 and 1997 requires U.S.  
and foreign air carriers to develop plans for addressing the needs 
of plane crash victims and their families. New federal rules that 
took effect last fall also require next-of-kin information on all 
U.S. citizens on all international flights.

<HEADLINE> DaimlerChrysler Unveils Concept Car </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- DaimlerChrysler has built a compact car  
powered by fuel cells that seats five people, goes 280 miles before 
refueling and travels as fast as 90 mph. 
</P>
<P>
	The concept car, called Necar 4, is the latest demonstration of  
progress on fuel cell cars as the world's automakers continue their 
race to bring such cars to market by 2004. Fuel cells convert 
hydrogen and oxygen into electricity to power a vehicle. 
</P>
<P>
	The car was formally unveiled today by DaimlerChrysler chairmen  
Robert Eaton and Juergen Schrempp at a press conference attended by 
Environmental Protection Agency officials at the Ronald Reagan 
International Trade Center. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is the next step in a very long journey,'' Eaton said  
after driving the car. ``Our challenge is to provide more 
earth-friendly vehicles without penalty of cost or convenience'' to 
customers. 
</P>
<P>
	The Necar 4, based on the Mercedes-Benz A-class compact car sold  
in Europe, accelerates easily from 0 to 30 and beyond. It can go as 
fast as 90 mph and travels 280 miles without refueling, Chrysler 
said. It also is a zero-emissions vehicle. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is a real step forward,'' said EPA Administrator Carol  
Browner. ``This car leaves a trail of water vapor, not clouds of 
carbon dioxide, nitrous oxide and other pollutants.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Other fuel cell cars have zero or near-zero emissions, depending  
on their fuel source. That makes fuel cells a favorite among 
automakers trying to comply with California's standard of zero 
emissions by 2003 for 10 percent of the cars sold in the state. 
</P>
<P>
	``Fuel cells have the potential to be the most attractive  
alternative propulsion system for the long term,'' said Schrempp. 
</P>
<P>
	But the demise of gas-powered cars is not imminent. Necar 4 is  
powered by liquid hydrogen, an impractical fuel for mass marketing 
since it must be kept at extremely cold temperatures. 
</P>
<P>
	DaimlerChrysler officials said the concept car would be replaced  
with Necar X, which would run on methanol. Methanol contains 
hydrogen and is the auto industry's favored fuel to power fuel 
cells. 
</P>
<P>
	Nationwide use of methanol-powered fuel cells would require a  
network of methanol pumping stations. 
</P>
<P>
	DaimlerChrysler's Ferdinand Panik said Necar 4 was a major  
breakthrough because the fuel cell technology was small enough to 
fit in a compact car. The fuel cells were stacked underneath the 
car's floorboard and the liquid hydrogen tank took up some space in 
its small trunk. 
</P>
<P>
	But DaimlerChrysler engineers say there is still a lot of work  
to be done before next year, when they aim to develop a fleet of 
demonstration cars based on the Necar X. 
</P>
<P>
	For example, the car is 1,100 pounds heavier than an equivalent  
gas-powered car because of the fuel-cell technology. Engineers say 
it must be 660 pounds lighter. 
</P>
<P>
	The fuel cells are also 10 times too expensive, engineers say.  
For example, a mass produced fuel cell car would now cost about 
$30,000 for the fuel cell hardware alone. Today's engines only cost 
about $3,000. 
</P>
<P>
	``Now we are looking to make the technology affordable to every  
consumer,'' Eaton said. 
</P>
<P>
	Other companies -- including Ford Motor, General Motors and Honda  
-- also said they hope to market fuel cell vehicles by 2004. 
</P>
<P>
	Companies are putting hundreds of millions of dollars into  
developing the technology.

<HEADLINE> Study: Lack of Sleep Dangerous </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	People who have a sleep disorder that causes them to wake up  
repeatedly during the night run a higher risk of getting into 
traffic accidents, a study confirms. 
</P>
<P>
	The research linking sleep apnea to car crashes in Spain was  
published in Thursday's New England Journal of Medicine. 
</P>
<P>
	With apnea, breathing is briefly and repeatedly cut off during  
sleep, often causing a person to wake up. Sufferers can be awakened 
hundreds of times a night, leaving them feeling tired the next day. 
Habitual snoring can be a symptom. 
</P>
<P>
	A University of Wisconsin study two years ago found that that  
people with undiagnosed sleep apnea were seven times more likely to 
have multiple traffic accidents. 
</P>
<P>
	In this latest study, doctors in Spain looked at drivers who  
received emergency treatment at two hospitals after getting into 
accidents. About 30 percent of them were found to have sleep apnea. 
That suggests that apnea sufferers are six times more likely to get 
into an acciden, the researchers said. 
</P>
<P>
	In an accompanying editorial, Drs. Paul M. Suratt from the  
University of Virginia Medical Center and Larry J. Findley of the 
Sleep Disorders Center of Northern Colorado noted that an estimated 
80 percent of sleep apnea cases go undiagnosed. 
</P>
<P>
	Doctors ``have an important role in helping to prevent accidents  
through identifying people with sleep apnea, providing treatment 
and education, and reporting patients who have had accidents to 
state authorities according to applicable laws,'' they wrote.

<HEADLINE> Stocks End Lower; Dow Off 51.06 / Wall Street Report  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- A day after it made a brief foray past 10,000,  
the Dow Jones industrial average found its path back to that 
milestone blocked Wednesday by an old nemesis, interest rates. 
</P>
<P>
	The Dow fell 51.06 to 9,879.41, nearly 121 points shy of 10,000.  
On Tuesday, the index passed five digits for the first time, but 
dropped back amid profit-taking and closed with a loss of nearly 29 
points at 9,930.47. 
</P>
<P>
	Broad-market indexes also declined Wednesday, although they did  
trim the day's losses before the closing bell. The Standard &AMP; 
Poor's 500 fell 8.56 to 1,297.82, and the technology-heavy Nasdaq 
composite index shed 10.30 to 2,428.97. 
</P>
<P>
	The Dow made some headway in the first hour of trading, rising  
to within 40 points of 10,000. But bond losses steepened, and 
stocks followed, sending the index lower. 
</P>
<P>
	The 30-year Treasury bond was down $3.20 per $1,000 in face  
value late in the day, pushing its yield to just under 5.5 percent 
from 5.47 percent late Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	The higher bond yields certainly didn't help, but Larry Wachtel,  
market analyst at Prudential Securities, said the stock market was 
in a normal cooling-off period after rising aggressively. 
</P>
<P>
	From its close at 9,274.88 on March 3 to its intraday high  
Tuesday of 10,001.78, the Dow surged 725 points, Wachtel pointed 
out. 
</P>
<P>
	``If there were no Dow 10,000, and the index had risen that much  
in two weeks, nobody would be questioning its giving back a little 
today,'' Wachtel said. ``The fact that you're holding up as much as 
you are, on top of that kind of move, is encouraging.'' 
</P>
<P>
	While the Dow must wait for another day to make its first close  
above 10,000, some market analysts expect the blue chips to reach 
that goal soon. 
</P>
<P>
	Alfred E. Goldman, director of market analysis at A.G. Edwards &AMP;  
Sons Inc. in St. Louis, said Friday's triple expiration of 
contracts and options, which often create big swings in the market, 
should give the Dow the extra fire power it needs. 
</P>
<P>
	But after that, he said, ``this is not going to be a straight-up  
affair; we do not have an undervalued market. It's going to be one 
step up, take a little nap.'' 
</P>
<P>
	On Wednesday, the Dow industrials were led lower by technology  
issues, including IBM, and financial stocks, which declined in 
response to the higher interest rates. IBM closed down 2 15/16 at 
178 1/16. Citicorp fell 1 3/4 to 62 3/4. 
</P>
<P>
	Internet-related stocks rose after Netscape's shareholders  
approved the company's $10 billion purchase by America Online. 
Netscape's shares rose 3 9/16 to 97 5/8 in Nasdaq trading. AOL's 
shares added 4 1/8 to 109 1/16. 
</P>

<P>
 *Celebrity Spotlight &AMP; Birthdays    	
</P>
<P>
	In the spotlight: Rosie O'Donnell  
</P>
<P>
	 *Personal Stats:* Television's ``Queen of Nice'' -- daytime  
talk-show host Rosie O'Donnell -- was born on March 21, 1962, in 
Commack, N.Y. O'Donnell was one of five children. 
</P>
<P>
	Her mother died when O'Donnell was 10. She found solace in  
television. Every day after school, she would race home to watch 
Mike Douglas or Merv Griffin. 
</P>
<P>
	``My whole life revolves around my mother's death,'' says  
O'Donnell, a single mom with two adopted children. ``It changed who 
I was as a person. I don't know who I would be if my mother had 
lived. But I would trade it all in to see.'' 
</P>
<P>
	 *Career Highlights:* O'Donnell made her television debut in  
``Gimme a Break'' in 1986. 
</P>
<P>
	She starred with Madonna in ``A League of Their Own'' in 1992.  
The film led to parts in ``Sleepless in Seattle,'' ``The 
Flintstones,'' ``Exit to Eden'' and ``Harriet the Spy.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Against her agent's advice, O'Donnell auditioned for -- and won --  
the role of Betty Rizzo in the Broadway revival of ``Grease'' in 
1994. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1996, the comedian decided to host her own daytime talk show,  
becoming a crusader for a kinder, gentler form of television. 
Guests who have appeared on ``The Rosie O'Donnell Show'' include 
Hillary Rodham Clinton, Anne Rice, Cher, Barbra Streisand, Tom 
Cruise, Luther Vandross and Tony Bennett. 
</P>
<P>
	 *Quote: * ``No other family was as obsessed with TV in my  
neighborhood as mine was. We were allowed to watch TV 24 hours a 
day. And we did. My favorite shows were 'Merv Griffin' and 'Mike 
Douglas.' I would literally run home from school every day and 
switch them on. I hope we can bring back that kind of show to 
television.''

<HEADLINE> House Wants To Restructure FCC </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The chief of the commission that shapes how  
Americans get telephone and TV services told House lawmakers who 
want to overhaul the agency Wednesday that protecting consumers and 
keeping phone rates affordable for the poor must remain priorities. 
</P>
<P>
	A major priority for one of the top lawmakers, meanwhile, is for  
the Federal Communications Commission to reduce regulations. 
</P>
<P>
	``The expansion of communications choices is already leading to  
greater consumer confusion,'' FCC Chairman Bill Kennard told a 
House hearing on the matter. '' ... Consumers will need clear and 
accurate information about their choices, guarantees of basic 
privacy and swift action if any company cheats rather than competes 
for business.'' 
</P>
<P>
	It's unclear whether Congress can approve any legislative effort  
to remake the FCC. And because no final plans have been offered, 
it's unclear what impact an FCC overhaul might have on consumers 
and businesses. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, Kennard emphasized that the FCC must keep protecting  
consumers from illegal practices, such as having their 
long-distance service switched without permission, and making sure 
phone rates stay affordable for poor people and those living in 
rural areas. 
</P>
<P>
	Rep. Billy Tauzin, R-La., chairman of the House Commerce  
Committee's telecommunications panel that has jurisdiction over the 
FCC, is leading the overhaul effort. He wants to make sure the 
65-year-old agency can meet the challenges of the fast-changing 
telecommunications business. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have in effect a horse and buggy agency trying to bridle  
supersonic technology,'' Tauzin said. 
</P>
<P>
	Tauzin wants to revamp both the agency's structure and its  
mission so it will focus more on enforcing existing regulations 
rather than creating new ones. He hopes to produce a bill 
reflecting that plan by June. 
</P>
<P>
	Kennard said he wants to work with lawmakers and gave them a  
five-year plan, subject to revisions, for reorganizing the FCC 
internally along functional rather than technological lines. His 
plan would also put greater emphasis on enforcement and phase out 
regulations as competition for telephone services develops. 
</P>
<P>
	The FCC chief, pointing to the emergence of companies that  
provide a wide range of services -- not just telephone or television 
or Internet as in the past -- said he'd welcome legislation 
clarifying how the agency should regulate them. 
</P>
<P>
	Republicans and some Democrats in the GOP-controlled Congress  
have accused the FCC of being too regulatory, particularly in its 
implementation of a 1996 law that freed cable TV and local and 
long-distance telephone companies to get into each other's 
businesses. 
</P>
<P>
	Rep. John Dingell of Michigan, the Commerce Committee's senior  
Democrat and a frequent FCC critic, blasted the agency's 
implementation of the law: ``It has thumbed its nose at Congress.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But another key Democrat, Rep Edward Markey of Massachusetts,  
gave the agency high marks for implementing the 1996 law and said 
radically restructuring the FCC ``would be counterproductive.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Tauzin, meanwhile, renewed his push to try to limit the FCC's  
authority to review mergers. 
</P>
<P>
	But Kennard defended continuing the FCC's authority in this  
area, saying the agency considers factors that antitrust regulators 
don't, such as examining how a media merger affects the diversity 
of viewpoints and programming on the nation's airwaves. 
</P>
<P>
	FCC Commissioner Michael Powell suggested having the agency  
continue considering such factors while leaving the antitrust 
review to antitrust experts: the Federal Trade Commission or the 
Department of Justice.

<HEADLINE> Intel Promises To Share Technology </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The government approved a legal settlement  
Wednesday and disclosed details of its secret agreement with Intel 
Corp. that averted a bitter antitrust showdown with the world's 
largest computer chip-maker. 
</P>
<P>
	Under the settlement, approved 3-0 by the Federal Trade  
Commission, Intel promised to share important technical details 
with other companies about its computer chips, but allowed for 
exceptions in rare circumstances. In return, Intel was not required 
to admit it has monopoly power. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are going to be watching,'' warned FTC Commissioner Robert  
Pitofsky. ``I believe Intel is a company that will follow the 
rules, but like any order, we'll be keeping an eye on whether 
they're trying to get around it in any way.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The government's June lawsuit accused Intel of having monopoly  
power and using it to illegally withhold from three companies 
advanced technical details about new chips to ``extort'' valuable 
technology that the companies had developed independently. 
</P>
<P>
	The company acknowledged it did most of what the FTC alleged but  
said its practices did not violate federal antitrust laws, arguing 
that companies have a legal right to decide what secrets to 
disclose to customers about upcoming products. 
</P>
<P>
	The settlement did not require Intel to admit it holds monopoly  
power over the microprocessor market. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was critical to settlement,'' said Tom Dunlap, Intel's  
general counsel. ``We absolutely would not agree we have market 
power or anything else.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Intel products run roughly 85 percent of the world's personal  
computers. The company had sales of $26.2 billion last year. 
</P>
<P>
	Any concession about its influence over the market could have  
been used against Intel in future lawsuits, because antitrust laws 
require monopolists to adhere to a tougher set of business 
standards than other companies. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's important not to make that admission,'' said Warren  
Grimes, a former FTC staff attorney who now teaches antitrust law 
at Southwestern University in Los Angeles. ``It would make it 
easier for private parties to bring private lawsuits against 
them.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But Richard Parker, the lead lawyer in the case for the FTC's  
Bureau of Competition, argued that the settlement puts limits on 
Intel that clearly signal its power, even without any admission by 
the company that it is a monopolist. 
</P>
<P>
	``While they're not agreeing to it, those kinds of obligations  
wouldn't apply to anybody without market power,'' Parker said. 
``We're setting rules for what a dominant firm has to do.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The FTC's decision to settle the Intel case -- and the Justice  
Department's ongoing antitrust trial against Microsoft Corp. -- 
illustrate the aggressive role Washington is carving for itself 
within the nation's burgeoning high-tech industry. 
</P>
<P>
	Although most FTC consent decrees remain in force for 20 years,  
the agency agreed in Intel's case to make its agreement valid for 
only half as long, reflecting what the government said was its 
understanding about the industry's pace of change. 
</P>
<P>
	Pitofsky called it ``very important to appreciate that high-tech  
is different.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Intel and the government announced the settlement last week, on  
the eve of the first day of trial, but details initially were 
closely guarded. 
</P>
<P>
	A single commissioner, Orson Swindle, did not vote, for health  
reasons. The settlement becomes final after a 60-day public comment 
period. 
</P>
<P>
	Craig Barrett, Intel's chief executive officer, said he was  
``very gratified'' that the company could reach agreement with the 
government, adding that the settlement ``provides a framework for 
resolving future intellectual property disputes with our 
customers.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Under the settlement, Intel agrees to share important  
information about upcoming processors with other companies unless 
those firms don't pay Intel as agreed or unless they sue Intel and 
ask a judge to enjoin it from manufacturing its chips -- a threat 
Parker described as ``a 10.0 earthquake for Intel.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``The threat of an injunction would seem an extremely drastic  
threat to Intel, so the logic is, this gives them the ability to 
fight back,'' said William Kovacic, a George Washington University 
antitrust expert. 
</P>
<P>
	Intel also will not have to continue sharing information about  
its chips with businesses that break promises to keep the details 
confidential, or with businesses that use the information to design 
rival microprocessors. 
</P>
<P>
	The settlement does not affect another FTC investigation of  
Intel widely believed to be looking into its business relating to 
computer motherboards and graphics technology.

<HEADLINE> Global Crossing Buys Frontier </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Global Crossing Ltd. of Bermuda is buying the  
larger U.S. telephone company Frontier Corp. for about $11.2 
billion in stock in the latest alliance in the telecommunications 
industry. 
</P>
<P>
	The deal announced today gives Global Crossing a foothold in the  
U.S. market where Frontier competes with long-distance phone 
service providers like AT&AMP;T Corp., MCI WorldCom Inc. and Sprint 
Corp. 
</P>
<P>
	Frontier also provides local phone service in its home market of  
Rochester, N.Y., as well in 31 other states and the District of 
Columbia. 
</P>
<P>
	Together, the combined companies in 1999 would have revenue of  
more than $4 billion, a stock-market value of nearly $30 billion 
and more than 8,500 employees. 
</P>
<P>
	Global Crossing has been building a fiber-optic communications  
network to carry voice and data traffic worldwide. Together, the 
companies will connect 159 cities worldwide with more than 71,000 
miles of fiber- optic cable. 
</P>
<P>
	Frontier had $2.6 billion in revenue last year and boasts over  
8,000 employees. Global Crossing, based in Hamilton, Bermuda, has 
about 200 employees and is on track to achieve $1 billion in 
revenue this year, according to The Wall Street Journal, which 
first reported the deal. 
</P>
<P>
	The acquisition has been approved by the boards of both  
companies but is subject to approval by shareholders and regulatory 
clearance. The deal is expected to close before October. 
</P>
<P>
	Global Crossing is headed by Robert Annunziata, a former top  
executive at AT&AMP;T who became its chief executive just a few weeks 
ago. Annunziata built Teleport Communications Group before selling 
the local-exchange carrier to AT&AMP;T for $12 billion in 1998. 
</P>
<P>
	Frontier's chief executive, Joseph P. Clayton, will become a  
vice chairman of Global Crossing. 
</P>
<P>
	Global Crossing is offering $62 a share in stock under certain  
conditions for each Frontier share, a 40 percent premium over 
Frontier's closing price Tuesday of $44.62 1/2 on the New York Stock 
Exchange. Global Crossing shares fell $5.06 1/4 to $51.50 on Tuesday 
in Nasdaq Stock Market trading. 
</P>
<P>
	On the news, Frontier shares shot up almost 14 percent, rising  
$6.12 1/2 to $50.75 a share at midmorning on the New York Stock 
Exchange. Global Crossing tumbled 10 percent, or by $5.25, to 
$46.25 a share on the Nasdaq Stock Market. 
</P>
<P>
	The offered price depends on shares of Global Crossing trading  
between $34.56 and $56.78.

<HEADLINE> IOC Expels Six Members in Scandal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LAUSANNE, Switzerland (AP) -- One by one, the six accused  
International Olympic Committee members filed into a conference 
hall Wednesday and pleaded their case before their peers. 
</P>
<P>
	Some 90 minutes later, in what delegates described as a  
``painful and harrowing'' exercise, all six were expelled. 
</P>
<P>
	The IOC completed an unprecedented purge of its own ranks, but  
backed president Juan Antonio Samaranch with an overwhelming vote 
of confidence and two rousing ovations during a special session 
wrought by the worst scandal in its 105-year history. 
</P>
<P>
	Despite the support, Samaranch hinted that he might leave office  
before the end of his term in 2001. 
</P>
<P>
	A total of 10 members have been banished or have resigned after  
being linked to $1.2 million in cash payments and other vote-buying 
inducements from Salt Lake City's winning bid for the 2002 Winter 
Games. Ten others have been censured or warned about their actions. 
</P>
<P>
	Olympic leaders said the expulsions marked a major turn in  
restoring the agency's credibility and the luster of the five 
rings. 
</P>
<P>
	But a leading U.S. congressional critic wasn't completely  
satisfied. 
</P>
<P>
	``Expelling members does nothing to address the utter lack of  
transparency and accountability in IOC processes,'' said Sen. John 
McCain, R-Ariz. ``What we must see are concrete reforms.'' 
</P>
<P>
	With corporate sponsors also demanding reforms, Samaranch and  
his deputies said the house-cleaning was just the beginning and 
that the IOC would carry out long-term changes. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're nearing the end of the beginning,'' said IOC vice  
president Dick Pound, echoing Winston Churchill. ``We have a fair 
amount of work ahead of us. This was a good start. Without having 
done it, it would have been hard to move forward.'' 
</P>
<P>
	On Thursday, the IOC is expected to appoint an independent  
ethics commission, change the selection process for the 2006 Winter 
Games and set up a special reform panel -- including outside experts 
-- to study structural changes. 
</P>
<P>
	``From the outset we have been telling the IOC to go deep and go  
wide in their investigations and it appears they are now doing 
that,'' said John LaBella, a spokesman for Kodak, one of the 
Olympic sponsors. 
</P>
<P>
	The six expelled members were Agustin Arroyo of Ecuador, Zein El  
Abdin Gadir of Sudan, Jean-Claude Ganga of the Republic of Congo, 
Lamine Keita of Mali, Sergio Santander of Chile and Paul Wallwork 
of Samoa. 
</P>
<P>
	Several claimed they were scapegoats.  
</P>
<P>
	``I am the proverbial sacrificial lamb,'' Wallwork said.  
``Perhaps I was led to the slaughterhouse.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``I do believe the public and the press wanted to have heads  
knocked down,'' Arroyo said. ``Mine happens to be in the way.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Santander said, ``It happened as a purely political act. It  
probably occurred because Chile was such a small country.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Jean-Claude Ganga, the African Olympic official who had  
threatened to go down fighting, offered an unexpectedly muted 
reaction. 
</P>
<P>
	``We accept this decision with sporting good will -- good  
winners, good losers,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	The six were ousted in secret ballots from 90 eligible voting  
members. None came close to the minimum 30 votes needed to avoid 
expulsion. 
</P>
<P>
	The vote counts were 72-16 against Arroyo, 86-4 against Gadir,  
88-2 against Ganga, 72-16 against Keita, 76-12 against Santander 
and 67-19 against Wallwork. 
</P>
<P>
	The 10 who received warnings in the three-month inquiry included  
South Korean executive board member Kim Un-yong, the 
highest-ranking official implicated in the scandal. 
</P>
<P>
	Kim's case remains open. Investigators say he could still face  
expulsion if evidence is found to prove he knew that Salt Lake 
bidders subsidized his son's salary at a telecommunications 
company. 
</P>
<P>
	The session began with Samaranch declaring that the IOC needed  
to be swift and decisive in dealing with a crisis that ``has nearly 
destroyed the reputation and credibility of all its members and the 
organization itself.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``It is our IOC which is now on trial,'' he said. ``The first  
step we must take is to clean our house. ... All that we have 
achieved is in great danger -- and you must all be aware of this 
fact.'' 
</P>
<P>
	While Samaranch said he wanted to lead the IOC through reforms,  
the 78-year-old Spaniard gave perhaps his clearest signal yet that 
he might not finish his term, scheduled to conclude late in 2001. 
</P>
<P>
	``My last service to Olympism would be to restructure our  
organization in order to enter the new millennium stronger than 
ever,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Earlier, speaking to reporters, Samaranch said, ``My idea is to  
remain until 2001, but we will see.'' 
</P>
<P>
	After receiving two ovations from the delegates, Samaranch -- who  
has faced numerous calls for his resignation from outside the IOC -- 
put his leadership to a vote of confidence. 
</P>
<P>
	In a surprise move, instead of a vote by acclamation, Samaranch  
asked for a secret ballot. 
</P>
<P>
	The result was 86-2, with one blank ballot and one not returned.  
</P>
<P>
	Samaranch, who had left the room for the vote, returned to the  
hall to a standing ovation. 
</P>
<P>
	Then the members turned to the traumatic task of throwing out  
their own colleagues. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's difficult looking at a person and saying, `No longer will  
you be among us,''' American IOC vice president Anita DeFrantz 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Each of the accused was allotted 20 minutes to present a  
defense. Delegates said the members stood at a podium and outlined 
their case in dignified and sometimes emotional tones. 
</P>
<P>
	Samaranch proposed the expulsions be confirmed by a show of  
hands. But, in the president's only defeat of the day, 37 members 
asked for a secret ballot. The result was clear-cut anyway. 
</P>
<P>
	``The mood for everyone was very sad since it was about  
colleagues we have to expel,'' French IOC member Jean-Claude Killy 
said. ``It's done and now we have to rebuild the house. It was 
important not to have the IOC implode today, and it didn't.''

<HEADLINE> Police Victim Lied in Asylum Case </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- The West African immigrant killed by police last  
month lied to win political asylum in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
	On his asylum application last October, Amadou Diallo claimed  
that he was from Mauritania, where human rights advocates say 
slavery is common, and that his parents had been beaten to death by 
soldiers as part of an ethnic cleansing campaign targeting blacks. 
</P>
<P>
	He claimed that he and an uncle were taken captive, and his  
uncle was killed. 
</P>
<P>
	``They beat us with wood sticks, tied us and dragged us to their  
trucks and took us to their military camp,'' Diallo said in a sworn 
deposition. The application was approved by an immigration judge. 
</P>
<P>
	But Diallo came from a relatively rich family of merchants in  
Guinea, and applied for asylum because he wanted to stay in the 
United States, said attorney Kyle Watters, who represents the 
Diallo family. 
</P>
<P>
	Diallo was unarmed when he was shot 19 times in a fusillade of  
41 bullets fired by four plainclothes officers in his apartment 
building Feb. 4, drawing a series of protests about police 
brutality and an investigation. 
</P>
<P>
	The officers thought Diallo had a gun, their lawyers have said.

<HEADLINE>  Fears of Ecuador Protest Diminish </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	QUITO, Ecuador (AP) -- Fears of violent antigovernment street  
protests diminished Wednesday as government officials met with 
protest leaders and legislators to resolve a standoff sparked by 
harsh economic reforms. 
</P>
<P>
	Taxi and bus drivers continued a three-day strike to protest a  
gasoline price increase, barricading streets and blocking traffic, 
but police and soldiers cleared some roadblocks, reducing the 
paralysis in the capital, Quito. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, there were sporadic outbursts of violence elsewhere in  
the South American nation. 
</P>
<P>
	Police dispersed dozens of stone-throwing demonstrators in  
Guayaquil, the country's main port, with tear gas and shots fired 
into the air. There were no reports of injuries. Also, Indian and 
peasant groups blocked some rural highways with burning tires and 
trees. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, meetings between government officials and the strike  
leaders appeared to be inching toward a solution. The government 
reportedly has offered to provide cab and bus owners with 
lower-priced, subsidized gasoline. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have an agreement in principle with the taxi drivers,''  
Interior Minister Vladimiro Alvarez said. ``We expect a definitive 
resolution soon.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Protesters are demanding that President Jamil Mahuad revoke  
austerity measures he announced last week to reduce a $1.2 billion 
budget deficit and rescue Ecuador, a poor nation of 12 million 
people, from its worst economic crisis in decades. 
</P>
<P>
	Among the measures were a doubling of gas prices, a partial  
freezing of bank accounts for six months to a year, and proposals 
to raise taxes, speed up privatizations and cut Ecuador's bloated 
bureaucracy. 
</P>
<P>
	Some of the reforms -- especially the tax increases and  
privatization laws -- must be approved by Congress, where they face 
fierce resistance. Mahuad's centrist Popular Democracy party lacks 
a majority in Congress. 
</P>
<P>
	The possibility that Mahuad might win congressional support for  
the reforms faded this week when the conservative Social Christian 
party, which had supported him in past votes, said it would oppose 
most of the measures. 
</P>
<P>
	Mahuad, who took office seven months ago, was meeting with  
leaders of center-left political factions in Congress in hopes of 
forging a new alliance to pass the reforms. 
</P>
<P>
	The austerity measures have caused hardship among Ecuadorians.  
</P>
<P>
	Food and gasoline prices have more than doubled, and the price  
of electricity has risen 400 percent since September. 
</P>
<P>
	The economic crisis in Ecuador was set off by last year's El  
Nino floods, which caused $2.6 billion in damage, and low world 
prices for oil, Ecuador's main export. Annual inflation is running 
at near 50 percent, the highest in Latin America.

<HEADLINE> GOP Plan Includes $6B for Crops </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The push to overhaul a crop insurance program  
for farmers got a boost Wednesday as Republican lawmakers included 
an additional $6 billion over four years to pay for the proposal in 
both the House and Senate budget resolutions. 
</P>
<P>
	That would nearly double the amount now being spent on crop  
insurance. 
</P>
<P>
	Both budget committees began voting on the resolutions  
Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is nothing less than a triumph for America's farmers and  
ranchers,'' said House Agriculture Committee Chairman Larry 
Combest, R-Texas. ``The $6 billion contained in the budget 
resolution guarantees us the fiscal means to strengthen the 
financial safety net for farmers. I'm confident we'll now have the 
tools to improve the risk management system.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The budget resolutions, which propose increases of about $1.5  
billion annually over four years for crop insurance on top of the 
$1.6 billion per year being spent now, are essentially a blueprint 
for things GOP leaders would like to accomplish. But they face 
hurdles as they go through the legislative process. 
</P>
<P>
	President Clinton did not include crop insurance in his budget  
proposal but has expressed a commitment to making reforms. 
Agriculture Secretary Dan Glickman has unveiled a plan that would 
cost between $2 and $2.5 billion more per year than current 
spending. 
</P>
<P>
	The commitment to overhaul crop insurance comes as farmers face  
another year of low prices in a sagging agricultural economy. Last 
year, Congress approved $6 billion in disaster insurance to help 
farmers through the crisis with their 1998 crops. 
</P>
<P>
	Many farmers don't have crop insurance and those who do complain  
that it is too expensive and inadequate. But with low prices 
expected to continue, lawmakers want to use crop insurance as a 
safety net to help farmers through the tough times. 
</P>
<P>
	That was what they envisioned when they phased out decades of  
government subsidies in the 1996 farm law. But many farmers don't 
have crop insurance, saying it's inexpensive or inadequate. 
Taxpayers fund 60 percent of the $1.6 billion program while 
farmers' premiums pay the rest. 
</P>
<P>
	Some GOP leaders have expressed concern about whether crop  
insurance is the right way to help farmers, and many Democrats have 
maintained that even with a crop insurance overhaul, farmers will 
need millions more in assistance. 
</P>
<P>
	``The budget resolution clearly does not respond to the present  
crisis in agriculture,'' said Sen. Tom Harkin, D-Iowa. 
</P>
<P>
	Senate Agriculture Chairman Dick Lugar, R-Ind., said during a  
hearing Wednesday on crop insurance that he is unsure whether 
insurance is the best solution. ``Before committing additional 
funds, I believe we should consider fundamental questions about 
crop insurance and the government's role,'' Lugar said. 
</P>
<P>
	The inclusion of crop insurance in the budget resolutions comes  
after intense lobbying by farm state lawmakers. Last week, 75 House 
Republicans wrote to House Budget Committee Chairman John Kasich, 
R-Ohio, and urged him to include money for the reforms.

<HEADLINE> Asian Stock Markets Close Higher </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HONG KONG (AP) -- Most Asian stock markets closed higher Tuesday  
on the back of a record rally overnight on Wall Street. In Tokyo, 
optimism that Japan's economy may be bottoming out pushed the key 
index to a seven-month high. 
</P>
<P>
	The Japanese benchmark 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average rose  
293.22 points, or 1.86 percent, closing at 16,072.82 points. On 
Monday, the average closed up 290.74 points, or 1.88 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Tuesday's closing was the Nikkei's highest finish since Aug. 3,  
when the average closed at 16,165.08 points. 
</P>
<P>
	Stocks opened slightly lower on profit-taking but soon headed  
into positive territory on buying from foreign and domestic 
institutional investors. 
</P>
<P>
	The Economic Planning Agency said in a monthly report, released  
Tuesday, that overall conditions remained extremely severe, but 
also added the Japanese economy's ``downward movement continues to 
slow to a halt.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Separately, the Bank of Japan said Tuesday that the nation's  
economy ``appears to have stopped deteriorating.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, the dollar was quoted at 117.84 yen at late  
afternoon, down 0.58 yen from late Monday in Tokyo but higher than 
its late New York level of 117.64 yen overnight. 
</P>
<P>
	Hong Kong share prices closed higher, with the key index rising  
to an 11-month high on the back of a record rally on Wall Street. 
</P>
<P>
	The Hang Seng Index, the Hong Kong market's key indicator of  
blue chips, rose 74.39 points, or 0.7 percent, to close at 
10,911.25, its highest level since April 23, 1998. On Monday, the 
index had gained 35.10 points. 
</P>
<P>
	Brokers said the Hong Kong market was pushed up by gains on Wall  
Street, where the Dow Jones industrial average bounded to a new 
closing high of 9,958.77 points. The Hang Seng Index has gained 16 
percent over over the past three weeks. 
</P>
<P>
	Philippine shares rebounded Tuesday, ending a five-day skid on  
the back of Wall Street's record close Monday and the continuing 
slide of domestic interest rates, traders said. 
</P>
<P>
	The Philippine Stock Exchange index of 30 selected companies  
rose 40.5 points or 2.1 percent, to 1,981.84. 
</P>
<P>
	Elsewhere:  
</P>
<P>
	TAIPEI: Share prices closed higher as investors poured into the  
market after the index broke through the key 6,500-point level on 
Monday amid continued strength in semiconductor stocks. The 
Weighted Stock Price Index rose 73.91 points, or 1.1 percent, to 
6,672.23. 
</P>
<P>
	WELLINGTON: New Zealand share prices closed higher on the back  
of another record level set in the Dow Jones Industrial Average 
overnight. The NZSE-40 Capital Index rose 15.56 points, or 0.7 
percent, to 2,182.32. 
</P>
<P>
	SYDNEY: The Australian market closed at a new record high, but  
shy of the psychological 3,000-point barrier. The All Ordinaries 
index climbed for a fifth consecutive day to close at 2,992.2, up 
2.7 points, or 0.1 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	SEOUL: Share prices closed higher, with the key index rising  
above 600 points for the first time in nearly eight weeks on the 
back of the rally on Wall Street. The Korea Composite Stock Price 
Index rose 9.81 points, or 1.7 percent, to 601.83. 
</P>
<P>
	KUALA LUMPUR: Malaysian shares closed lower on concerns over the  
pace of the country's economic recovery. The benchmark Composite 
Index fell 1.3 percent, or 6.55 points, to close at 511.90. 
</P>
<P>
	SINGAPORE: Share prices closed lower. The Straits Times Index  
fell 4.65 points, or 0.3 percent, to 1,489.54. 
</P>
<P>
	JAKARTA: Indonesian share prices closed higher. The main  
Composite Index rose 7.125 points, or 1.9 percent, to 379.453. 
</P>
<P>
	BANGKOK: Thai stock prices closed lower on profit-taking. The

<HEADLINE> Holyfield-Lewis TV Ratings High </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- More than 1 million households paid $49.95 each  
to see the disputed draw between Evander Holyfield and Lennox Lewis 
on pay-per-view television. 
</P>
<P>
	TVKO and media research consultant Paul Kagan Associates Inc.  
both reported Wednesday that 1.2 million homes purchased Saturday 
night's fight for a gross of more than $60 million. 
</P>
<P>
	Barry Gould of the ``TV Sports File'', an independent newsletter  
that monitors the cable television industry, said that a more 
accurate number may be closer to 1.1 million. 
</P>
<P>
	Either way, the fight placed eighth on the all-time pay-per-view  
buy list. 
</P>
<P>
	The rematch between Holyfield and Mike Tyson in June of 1997 is  
No. 1 with 1.9 million buys. 
</P>
<P>
	``The 1.2 number is excellent,'' said Larry Gerbrandt of Paul  
Kagan Associates. ``The industry hasn't seen too many $50 million 
paydays. The controversial outcome is bad for boxing, but if there 
is a rematch, it will probably stoke the fire.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Holyfield-Lewis bout is just ahead of Holyfield's fight with  
Buster Douglas in 1990 (1.06 million) and behind the Tyson-Razor 
Ruddock rematch in 1991 (1.25 million).

<HEADLINE>  Winner Swingley Dominated Iditarod </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NOME, Alaska (AP) -- Despite two broken sleds, Doug Swingley won  
the Iditarod Trail Sled Dog Race for the second time Wednesday, 
completing the 1,100-mile Anchorage-to-Nome trek in 9 1/2 days. 
</P>
<P>
	Swingley, from Lincoln, Mont., is the only non-Alaskan to win  
the race. As he did in 1995, when he set the course speed record, 
Swingley relied on a fast, well-trained team as much as strategy 
decisions such as when to rest and when to push his dogs. 
</P>
<P>
	Haggard-looking and unshaven, Swingley led his 11 dogs past a  
cheering crowd and through the finish chute at 1:31 a.m. Alaska 
time (5:31 EST). He completed the race in 9 days, 14 hours, 31 
minutes. 
</P>
<P>
	The victory earned him $60,000 and a new pickup to go along with  
$9,000 in bonus money he won along the way for leading at the 
halfway point, at the Yukon River and when the race hit the Bering 
Sea coast. 
</P>
<P>
	``I got to take a long rest at the end,'' Swingley said at the  
finish line, flanked by family members and a couple of his dogs. 
``I'm ready to party.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Nearly nine hours later, three-time winner Martin Buser of Big  
Lake, Alaska, reached the finish line, ending a chase that started 
one-third of the way into the race. Swingley relentlessly 
lengthened his lead over Buser during the past week, and by last 
weekend it was clear the Montanan had built an insurmountable 
advantage. 
</P>
<P>
	Swingley's victory margin is the widest since 1992, when Buser  
finished more than 10 hours ahead of runner-up Susan Butcher. 
</P>
<P>
	Swingley borrowed from a race strategy that worked for him in  
1995 -- go further than the pack before taking his mandatory 24-hour 
rest, and then outrun everyone else to the Bering Sea coast. 
</P>
<P>
	While on the Yukon River, Swingley said, he and Buser agreed he  
had the fastest team. 
</P>
<P>
	``He and I both realized that I may not see him or anyone else  
again,'' Swingley said. ``It was my race to lose.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But at the same time, despite his confidence, he didn't want to  
count it as a victory too soon. 
</P>
<P>
	He also caught a few big breaks. Injuries forced Buser to cut  
his team from 16 dogs to 10 early in the race. And after leaving 
the Yukon River, Swingley just missed a bout of bad weather that 
slowed other front-running teams. 
</P>
<P>
	Swingley also broke two sleds, but neither slowed him down. He  
patched the first with a stick and a few hose clamps, and the 
second broke just before his 24-hour layover in Iditarod, leaving 
him plenty of time to fly in a replacement. 
</P>
<P>
	Vern Halter of Willow, Alaska, was running third Wednesday.  
</P>
<P>
	Forty-five other mushers also were on the trail, with rookie  
Shane Goosen of Wasilla, Alaska bringing up the rear. He was still 
350 miles from Nome and looked to be the likely winner of the red 
lantern, an award given to the last musher to finish.

<HEADLINE> Church Upset Over Drag Queen Party </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SAN FRANCISCO (AP) -- Catholic leaders want the city to revoke a  
permit for a street party on Easter thrown by a theater troupe of 
habit-wearing drag queens known as the Sisters of Perpetual 
Indulgence. 
</P>
<P>
	The Sisters have a permit to close a section of a road in the  
largely gay Castro District to celebrate their 20th anniversary. 
</P>
<P>
	Allowing a group that ``mocks the Catholic Church'' to close a  
public street on Easter is comparable to ``allowing a group of 
neo-Nazis to close a city street for a celebration on the Jewish 
feast of Passover,'' said Maurice Healy, a spokesman for San 
Francisco's Roman Catholic Archdiocese. 
</P>
<P>
	He wrote in the archdiocese's official newspaper, Catholic San  
Francisco: ``This group has garnered a reputation for outrageous 
behavior by mocking religious life, ridicule of Catholic 
institutions and profane references to sacred liturgies.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But one of the Sisters, known as MaryMaye Himm, said the party  
is on. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're really appalled at the insensitivity of comparing us to  
neo-Nazis, which totally invalidates the Jewish struggle against 
Nazis,'' Himm said. ``The Catholic Church should be ashamed for 
promoting such absurdity. There are no pagan rituals. The goal is 
education and celebration.''

<HEADLINE> 'Truth in Rock Act' Hearings Open </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- It was as if the soundtrack to ``Happy Days''  
sprang to life Tuesday in the unlikely venue of a House committee 
room. 
</P>
<P>
	Mary Wilson struck the famous arm-jutting ``Stop! In the Name of  
Love'' pose. Two of the Drifters led an a capella ``Under the 
Boardwalk.'' Sha Na Na's Bowzer mugged for television cameras, 
without his trademark undershirt but with regulation greased-back 
hair. 
</P>
<P>
	Not your usual afternoon on Capitol Hill, but these were not the  
usual lobbyists gathered to press for change in federal trademark 
law. 
</P>
<P>
	Members of rhythm and blues, doo-wop and girl group acts from  
the 1950s and 1960s were there because they want greater authority 
to challenge competing acts performing under the names that topped 
the charts. 
</P>
<P>
	For instance, at least three different sets of Drifters perform  
in the United States without any of the voices responsible for 
``Under the Boardwalk,'' ``Up on the Roof'' and other hit records. 
</P>
<P>
	Rep. Dennis Kucinich, D-Ohio, sponsor of legislation he calls  
the ``Truth in Rock Act,'' said fans who go to see substitute 
groups get cheated, and orginal artists are deprived of the chance 
to work. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are all affected by bogus groups, because there is only a  
finite amount of work for people from our time period,'' said Peggy 
Davison, who sang the lead on the Angels hit, ``My Boyfriend's 
Back.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Just think of how you'd feel if all your life's  
accomplishments, all your history, was usurped without your 
permission,'' said Frank Maffei of Danny and the Juniors. 
</P>
<P>
	The revival-group packager who inspired the legislation, Larry  
Marshak of RCI Corp. in New York, said everything he does is legal 
and aboveboard, including his stable of multiple Platters, Drifters 
and Coasters. 
</P>
<P>
	``We make no illusions to be otherwise than what they are.  
Nobody expects to see the original members when they see us,'' he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Marshak said he started putting together revival shows in the  
1970s. He reunited some original band members, he said, or used 
originals as advisers to work with entirely new groups performing 
the old material. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's like we don't exist,'' said Sam Moore, half of Sam &AMP;  
Dave. 
</P>
<P>
	Moore spent years suing former partner Dave Prater after Prater  
hired a substitute and toured as the New Sam &AMP; Dave. At one point, 
Moore lost his home to legal fees, his wife Joyce said. 
</P>
<P>
	And Bowzer, who in real life is a serious, suit-wearing  
entrepreneur named Jon Bauman, told of watching substitute 
performers ``standing on stage saying `I recorded this song in 
1962,' when they had nothing to do with that song in 1962?'' 
</P>
<P>
	New York agent John Villano, who represents Herb Reed of the  
Platters, Carl Gardner of the Coasters and Charlie Thomas of the 
Drifters, said it's not just the golden oldies who would benefit if 
the trademark law is changed. 
</P>
<P>
	``Twenty years from now when the Spice Girls aren't spicy  
anymore there's going to be some unscrupulous idiot who puts five 
girls out there and your kids and grandkids are not going to know 
the difference,'' said Villano.

</P>
<P>
	BOURBONNAIS, Ill. (AP) -- A member of the National Transportation  
Safety Board said today that before reaching any conclusions on the 
cause of the crash investigators plan to wait until interviews are 
completed between the driver of a truck and engineer of an Amtrak 
passenger train. At least 11 people were killed and more than 100 
were injured in Monday night's accident. Investigators said they 
are trying to determine whether the driver drove around a crossing 
barrier to beat the train. The engineer and the warning system are 
also being examined.

	Hale Takes Plea Bargain in Sex Case  
</P>
<P>
	FORT LEWIS, Wash. (AP) -- In exchange for a reduced sentence, a  
retired Army general will plead guilty to charges involving sexual 
improprieties with the wives of subordinates. Maj. Gen. David Hale, 
who was allowed to retire honorably in 1998 after the allegations 
became public, is the second Army general since 1952 to submit to a 
court-martial. Hale faces up to 11 years in prison, the loss of his 
$75,000-a-year pension and dismissal from the service. Under the 
initial 17 charges, he had faced the possibility of 56 years in 
prison if convicted.

	Report Issued on Kosovo Victims  
</P>
<P>
	PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) -- A forensic team investigating the  
January slayings of dozens of Kosovo Albanians concluded today that 
the victims were unarmed civilians. The findings, which failed to 
prove an allegation by the head of international monitors that Serb 
forces had conducted a massacres, nonetheless challenge government 
claims that the victims were ethnic Albanian rebel fighters or 
civilians accidentally caught in a crossfire. The killings of at 
least 45 ethnic Albanians in Racak, a village 25 miles southwest of 
Pristina, galvanized international support for U.S.-led peace 
efforts. Pathologists confirmed numerous victims were elderly men, 
and one was a woman.

	Olivetti Would Cut Jobs at Telecom

<P>
	LONDON (AP) -- Olivetti SpA said today it would slash 13,000 jobs  
at Telecom Italia SpA if it's successful in buying its much larger 
rival. The cuts at Telecom's fixed-line telephone business would 
amount to more than 10 percent of all jobs at Italy's biggest phone 
company, or more than 16 percent of its telephone-related jobs. The 
proposal is the latest from Olivetti since it launched a hostile 
$58 billion bid for Telecom last month. A takeover of the former 
state monopoly would be the biggest telecommunications deal so far 
in Europe.

	Fed: Economic Growth Still Robust  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Federal Reserve said today that last  
year's economic growth carried over to 1999 with strong consumer 
spending, brisk construction activity and greater demand for labor. 
Despite that, prices of most goods barely changed and businesses 
were reluctant to seek price increases. The combination of growth 
without inflation suggests that Fed policy-makers probably will 
make no changes to interest rates when they meet at March 30.

<HEADLINE> Heartburn Linked to Cancer </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	The chance of getting cancer of the esophagus -- a particularly  
deadly form of the disease -- is almost eight times higher in people 
who suffer from chronic heartburn, according to a new study 
published today. 
</P>
<P>
	People suffering from acid reflux at night are at an even higher  
risk of getting the disease -- and taking antacids doesn't reduce 
the danger, researchers said in today's New England Journal of 
Medicine. 
</P>
<P>
	Heartburn is a burning pain in the chest that people commonly  
associate with spicy foods or overeating. Acid reflux is a 
regurgitation of acid from the stomach into the esophagus because 
of a faulty valve. 
</P>
<P>
	Doctors suspect that over time, the irritating acid causes  
cellular changes in the esophagus that can lead to the most deadly 
form of esophageal cancer, adenocarcinoma. 
</P>
<P>
	``Reflux symptoms should not be dismissed as trivial,'' said Dr.  
Jesper Lagergren of the Karolinska Institute in Stockholm, Sweden. 
``If you have reflux symptoms and you get new symptoms -- maybe you 
have symptoms for several years and maybe the symptoms seem to 
change, like difficulty swallowing -- then you should seek medical 
care.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The researchers said that because treatment of heartburn and  
acid reflux doesn't reduce the cancer risk, those with severe 
symptoms should be watched carefully by their doctors for signs of 
cancer. 
</P>
<P>
	The overall risk of developing esophageal cancer is extremely  
low, but only 5 percent to 10 percent of patients survive more than 
five years after contracting the disease. 
</P>
<P>
	The study found the risk of cancer was almost eight times higher  
among people who suffered heartburn, regurgitation or both at least 
once a week. Acid reflux at night was associated with a risk nearly 
11 times higher. 
</P>
<P>
	There was no increased risk for another form of esophageal  
cancer, squamous-cell carcinoma. 
</P>
<P>
	While up to one-fifth of Americans get heartburn, only about  
12,500 people a year develop esophageal cancer, according to the 
American Cancer Society. Over the past 20 years, cancer of the 
esophagus has become increasingly prevalent among white men, but 
researchers don't know why. 
</P>
<P>
	Exactly what causes heartburn and acid reflux isn't clear.  
Previous studies have indicated a link between acid reflux and 
obesity, smoking and alcohol use, but this study found no 
correlation between those habits and heartburn. And Lagergren said 
there is no proof of the belief that spicy foods cause acid reflux 
or heartburn. 
</P>
<P>
	The study was based on data from 1994 through 1997 on all Swedes  
under 80, or about 8 million people. The researchers interviewed 
189 esophageal cancer patients and 262 stomach cancer patients and 
compared them with 820 randomly selected people. 
</P>
<P>
	The greater the frequency, severity and duration of heartburn  
and acid reflux, the higher the risk of developing esophageal 
cancer. The study found only a weak link between heartburn and 
stomach cancer. 
</P>
<P>
	The researchers found no indication that treatment -- either with  
antacids or surgery -- reduced the risk. In fact, patients who 
received medical treatment had a higher risk of developing cancer, 
though Lagergren said that may be because the people have more 
symptoms. 
</P>
<P>
	In an accompanying editorial, Drs. Sidney Cohen and Henry  
Parkman of the Temple University School of Medicine in Philadelphia 
suggested doctors test patients complaining of severe heartburn 
with an endoscope, a flexible tube with a tiny video camera on the 
end that is inserted down the throat to look for signs of cancer. 
</P>
<P>
	``Heartburn must be given respect,'' they wrote. ``Treatment  
should also be aggressive.'' 
</P>
<P>
	However, Lagergren and his colleagues said the effectiveness of  
aggressive treatments, or any treatments for that matter, is 
debatable. 
</P>
<P>
	``To our knowledge, so far, you can't do much,'' Lagergren said.  
``We can't recommend anything.''

<HEADLINE> U.S. Wins Dairy Dispute With Canada </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The United States has won a victory before the  
World Trade Organization in a battle over what American dairy 
farmers claimed were unfair subsidies being provided by the 
Canadian government to boost Canadian dairy exports. 
</P>
<P>
	The Geneva-based WTO, which referees global trade disputes,  
ruled that the subsidies provided by the Canadian government to the 
country's dairy farmers represented a violation of Canada's 
obligations under a 1994 global trade agreement. 
</P>
<P>
	U.S. Trade Representative Charlene Barshefsky hailed the ruling  
as ``an important decision for the U.S. dairy industry and for all 
our agriculture industries.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The WTO panel upheld the U.S. contention that Canada's system of  
providing low-cost milk to processors for export exceeded the 
subsidy limits the country had accepted in the last round of global 
trade talks. 
</P>
<P>
	American dairy farmers had contended that the extra subsidies  
were allowing Canada to unfairly boost exports of dry milk, cheese 
and butter on world markets. 
</P>
<P>
	``The WTO agreed with our contention that Canada is using  
stealth subsidies to undercut U.S. dairy exports in the 
international marketplace and that Canada has closed the door on 
American companies that want to sell milk there,'' said Jerry 
Kozak, chief executive officer of the National Milk Producers 
Association. 
</P>
<P>
	In response, Canadian Agriculture Minister Lyle Vanclief said in  
a statement that ``Canada is committed to supply management and 
will continue to defend its dairy industry.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Canadian Trade Minister Sergio Marchi said the country may  
decide to appeal the WTO ruling after consultations with the 
Canadian dairy industry and provincial governments. 
</P>
<P>
	The U.S. dairy industry claimed that since 1995 Canada has used  
a two-tiered export pricing system that resulted in payments to 
farmers of higher prices for milk used domestically and much lower 
prices for milk that was exported. The U.S. industry said this 
system gave Canadian dairy exports an unfair price advantage on 
world markets. 
</P>
<P>
	The United States also won on a second issue that Canada's  
current limits on milk exported to Canada from the United States 
had been set too low. 
</P>
<P>
	Canada had argued before the WTO that its dairy pricing system  
was not a subsidy and therefore was not subject to limits imposed 
in the WTO trade agreement.

<HEADLINE> Feds Review 'Baby T' Custody Ruling </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- Federal officials want to determine if a judge  
handling the custody case of a black child broke a law prohibiting 
the consideration of race when placing children with adoptive and 
foster parents. 
</P>
<P>
	Judge Judith Brawka last week ordered the 3-year-old boy known  
as ``Baby T'' returned to his former drug addict mother. 
</P>
<P>
	In doing so, Brawka cited a state law that favors placement of  
children with their birth parents as well as mother Tina Olison's 
successful drug rehabilitation. 
</P>
<P>
	However, the judge also criticized state child-welfare officials  
for placing too little emphasis on the boy's race when they 
recommended that he remain with city Alderman Edward Burke and his 
wife, state Appellate Judge Anne Burke, who are white. 
</P>
<P>
	``Unless the position of the department is that there is no such  
thing as African-American culture, this issue deserves more 
attention than to check a box that says not applicable,'' Brawka 
told officials from the Department of Children and Family Services 
in her March 8 ruling. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1996, Congress voted into law a ban preventing states from  
considering race when placing children with adoptive or foster 
parents. States that ignore the ban could face the loss of federal 
funds. 
</P>
<P>
	Officials at the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services  
are reviewing the case because the judge brought up race. The 
department can't change the ruling; only an appeals court could do 
that. 
</P>
<P>
	The Burkes -- one of Chicago's most politically powerful couples  
-- have cared for the boy since he was 8 days old and wanted to 
adopt him. They also sought to have the 37-year-old Olison declared 
unfit.

<HEADLINE> Four Amish Teen-Agers Arrested </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HAZLETON, Iowa (AP) -- Four Amish teen-agers were arrested for  
smashing 44 windows and overturning buggies during a rampage at the 
home of an Amish farmer, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
	At least three people cowered inside the home of Roman Raber as  
the teens were causing the damage, sheriff's deputy Glen Fults 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	The youths apparently suspected Raber had called county deputies  
to report they had been drinking on the property earlier that 
evening, Deputy Jeff Coleman said. Deputies had issued numerous 
alcohol-related citations in the earlier incident. 
</P>
<P>
	``They trashed the farm,'' Fults said.  
</P>
<P>
	As many as 40 youths were on the property late Sunday and early  
Monday, having lingered there following prayer services for the 
adults. Only a handful participated in the vandalism in this quiet 
Amish community about 50 miles north of Cedar Rapids. 
</P>
<P>
	Raber doesn't have a phone and denied summoning authorities.  
</P>
<P>
	``It was frightful, very frightful to see the intent to  
terrorize us,'' Raber said. ``Most didn't do anything -- they 
thought it was terrible.'' 
</P>
<P>
	More arrests are pending. Authorities didn't know whether the  
four arrested had been drinking.

<HEADLINE>  Winner Swingley Dominated Iditarod </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NOME, Alaska (AP) -- Despite two broken sleds, Doug Swingley won  
the Iditarod Trail Sled Dog Race for the second time Wednesday, 
completing the 1,100-mile Anchorage-to-Nome trek in 9 1/2 days. 
</P>
<P>
	Swingley, from Lincoln, Mont., is the only non-Alaskan to win  
the race. As he did in 1995, when he set the course speed record, 
Swingley relied on a fast, well-trained team as much as strategy 
decisions such as when to rest and when to push his dogs. 
</P>
<P>
	Haggard-looking and unshaven, Swingley led his 11 dogs past a  
cheering crowd and through the finish chute at 1:31 a.m. Alaska 
time (5:31 EST). He completed the race in 9 days, 14 hours, 31 
minutes. 
</P>
<P>
	The victory earned him $60,000 and a new pickup to go along with  
$9,000 in bonus money he won along the way for leading at the 
halfway point, at the Yukon River and when the race hit the Bering 
Sea coast. 
</P>
<P>
	``I got to take a long rest at the end,'' Swingley said at the  
finish line, flanked by family members and a couple of his dogs. 
``I'm ready to party.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Nearly nine hours later, three-time winner Martin Buser of Big  
Lake, Alaska, reached the finish line, ending a chase that started 
one-third of the way into the race. Swingley relentlessly 
lengthened his lead over Buser during the past week, and by last 
weekend it was clear the Montanan had built an insurmountable 
advantage. 
</P>
<P>
	Swingley's victory margin is the widest since 1992, when Buser  
finished more than 10 hours ahead of runner-up Susan Butcher. 
</P>
<P>
	Swingley borrowed from a race strategy that worked for him in  
1995 -- go further than the pack before taking his mandatory 24-hour 
rest, and then outrun everyone else to the Bering Sea coast. 
</P>
<P>
	While on the Yukon River, Swingley said, he and Buser agreed he  
had the fastest team. 
</P>
<P>
	``He and I both realized that I may not see him or anyone else  
again,'' Swingley said. ``It was my race to lose.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But at the same time, despite his confidence, he didn't want to  
count it as a victory too soon. 
</P>
<P>
	He also caught a few big breaks. Injuries forced Buser to cut  
his team from 16 dogs to 10 early in the race. And after leaving 
the Yukon River, Swingley just missed a bout of bad weather that 
slowed other front-running teams. 
</P>
<P>
	Swingley also broke two sleds, but neither slowed him down. He  
patched the first with a stick and a few hose clamps, and the 
second broke just before his 24-hour layover in Iditarod, leaving 
him plenty of time to fly in a replacement. 
</P>
<P>
	Vern Halter of Willow, Alaska, was running third Wednesday.  
</P>
<P>
	Forty-five other mushers also were on the trail, with rookie  
Shane Goosen of Wasilla, Alaska bringing up the rear. He was still 
350 miles from Nome and looked to be the likely winner of the red 
lantern, an award given to the last musher to finish.

<HEADLINE> High-Tech Cattle Tracking Unveiled / Farm Scene  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	GREAT FALLS, Mont. (AP) -- A high-tech project unveiled by the  
Montana Stockgrowers Association this week is intended to let 
ranchers track the quality of their beef from the pasture to the 
packing plant, giving them new tools to improve their product and 
target specific markets. 
</P>
<P>
	At the heart of the project, dubbed the Montana Beef Network, is  
a disk-shaped, electronic ear tag equipped with a computer chip. 
</P>
<P>
	The tag would stay with an animal throughout its life, for the  
first time allowing the ranch, feedlot and packing plant to compare 
notes and breed cattle for niche markets. The tracking will go 
hand-in-hand with an aggressive quality-control program. 
</P>
<P>
	``Our system of cattle production is somewhat segmented,'' said  
Keith Bales, president of the Montana Stockgrowers Association. 
``The Montana Beef Network could dramatically change the way 
Montana ranchers do business.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Up to 50,000 head of Montana cattle will be tagged this fall  
with the help of subsidies, including a $500,000 grant from the 
U.S. Agriculture Department, $70,000 from the Montana Beef Council 
and $15,000 from the Montana Agriculture Department. 
</P>
<P>
	Ranchers who join the voluntary program will pay about $2 a head  
for the electronic tags. When the subsidies run out, the cost will 
be closer to $5 a head. 
</P>
<P>
	Encoded in each tag is a unique number that can be used to input  
and retrieve data on the animal. 
</P>
<P>
	The rancher enters the first round of statistics. The feedlot  
enters the next round. Then, at the slaughterhouse, the tag number 
is transferred to the dolly on which the carcass is hung. 
</P>
<P>
	The slaughterhouse inputs the ``hot carcass weight,'' quality  
grade, yield grade and other data into the computer system, where 
it is almost immediately available to the rancher. 
</P>
<P>
	``(Knowing) how our cattle perform is the ultimate goal of every  
rancher. Our cattle are our lifeblood and our equity. If we can 
track their performance, and particularly how they are graded, it 
allows us to become better producers,'' said Harlem-area rancher 
and state Rep. Matt McCann. 
</P>
<P>
	Most cattle raised in Montana go to feedlots in the Midwest at 8  
or 9 months of age. But the rancher now has no way of knowing 
whether an animal thrived at the feedlot or what its slaughter 
grades and yields were. 
</P>
<P>
	``With the little 500-pound steer calf, when they leave (the  
rancher knows) what they look like,'' McCann said. ``But they don't 
have any idea what they finish out to be.'' 
</P>
<P>
	That makes it tough to market. Unlike the chicken industry,  
where companies build brand names on uniform quality standards, 
beef coming into slaughterhouses is inconsistent. Good cattle 
mingle with the bad. 
</P>
<P>
	If packing facilities could single out ranches for specific meat  
qualities, they could more easily target niche markets such as 
restaurant-quality beef, Asian markets and extra-lean meat. 
Ranchers would have more leverage in the market. 
</P>
<P>
	The project begins next month with seminars across the state.  
Producers who opt into the tracking system must meet quality 
assurance criteria and complete an educational program coordinated 
by Montana State University. 
</P>
<P>
	Montana is joining Iowa as one of the first states to experiment  
with electronic tracking. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's kind of a chicken and the egg thing,'' acknowledged  
Montana Beef Network coordinator Quinn Holzer. ``There are a lot of 
unknowns. But our other option is to wait until someone else does 
it and come along behind.''

<HEADLINE> Pataki Supports DiMaggio Tribute </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Gov. George Pataki supports the renaming of the  
West Side Highway in tribute to Hall of Famer Joe DiMaggio. 
</P>
<P>
	The announcement Tuesday came a day after the New York  
ballplayer's longtime attorney criticized the governor for a messy 
political dispute over the honor. 
</P>
<P>
	This morning, the state Assembly and Senate both endorsed a  
resolution renaming a portion of the highway running from Battery 
Place to West 72nd Street along Manhattan's West Side in DiMaggio's 
honor. 
</P>
<P>
	In a scathing letter on Monday, DiMaggio lawyer Morris Engelberg  
said neither he nor DiMaggio's grandchildren would ``sanction 
Governor Pataki's ... use of Mr. DiMaggio's name to be used in a 
political battle'' over the highway tribute to the ballplayer, who 
died March 8. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was Mr. DiMaggio who said `yes' to the renaming of the West  
Side Highway, and that is all that counts,'' Engelberg wrote in the 
letter to Mayor Rudolph Giuliani. 
</P>
<P>
	DiMaggio's ``grandchildren and I are deeply concerned by  
Governor Pataki's action,'' Engelberg said. ``To use Joe DiMaggio's 
name to further any political objective is inappropriate, and to 
attempt to do so at this time -- so soon after his death -- is, in 
our opinion, in extremely poor taste.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The letter, made public Tuesday, represented a stinging  
reprimand for Pataki, whose administration had suggested the idea 
of renaming the Major Deegan Expressway, which runs near Yankee 
Stadium in the Bronx, for DiMaggio. 
</P>
<P>
	Giuliani had been campaigning since January to have the West  
Side Highway renamed for the legendary ballplayer, and he went so 
far as to have a highway sign bearing DiMaggio's name shipped to 
him in his final days in Florida. 
</P>
<P>
	The competing proposals created a rift between City Hall and  
Albany on the day DiMaggio died. It was the latest disagreement in 
the long-running flinty relations between the mayor and the 
governor. 
</P>
<P>
	Giuliani and Pataki discussed the letter privately Monday and  
agreed to follow the family's wishes. 
</P>
<P>
	Aides to the governor said they were stunned when Engelberg's  
letter became public, and they accused the mayor's office of having 
a hand in leaking it to the media. They emphasized that Pataki had 
never expressed a preference for either highway. 
</P>
<P>
	City Hall and Albany have had other disagreements over the  
Yankees. 
</P>
<P>
	Last year, Pataki disclosed he favored keeping the Yankees in  
the Bronx at a time when the mayor was touting a West Side railyard 
in Manhattan as a potential home for a new Yankee Stadium. The West 
Side Highway runs near the railyard. 
</P>
<P>
	No decision has been made on a new home for the Yankees, whose  
lease at Yankee Stadium expires in 2002.

<HEADLINE> Baptist Church Breaks National Ties </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WINSTON-SALEM, N.C. (AP) -- A Baptist congregation is severing  
ties with the Southern Baptist Convention after years of 
unhappiness over the denomination's increasingly conservative 
policies. 
</P>
<P>
	Members of Wake Forest Baptist Church voted in January to end  
its affiliation with the convention, but the congregation didn't 
make the vote public until Tuesday due to recent publicity over its 
endorsement of same-sex ceremonies. 
</P>
<P>
	``We wanted the community to know where we stand,'' said the  
Rev. Richard Groves, the pastor of the congregation that meets on 
the Wake Forest University campus but is independent of the school. 
</P>
<P>
	Only one member voted against the split when about 100 of the  
325-member congregation voted, Groves said. 
</P>
<P>
	In a letter sent to the convention, congregation leaders said  
they were unhappy over the church's stand on women in ministry, 
targeting Jews and Mormons for evangelism, a literal interpretation 
of the Bible and isolation of congregations that reach out to gays 
and lesbians. 
</P>
<P>
	A resolution by the convention last summer calling in part for  
wives to ``submit graciously'' to their husbands sparked the formal 
break for Wake Forest Baptist.

<HEADLINE> Legacy of First Ladies Celebrated </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Hillary Rodham Clinton saluted the women who  
preceded her in the White House and accepted an award for her own 
contributions in shaping the role of the first lady. 
</P>
<P>
	Receiving a crystal statue etched with her image from the  
National First Ladies' Library, Mrs. Clinton noted Tuesday night 
that history has sometimes forgotten the causes championed by the 
first ladies before her. 
</P>
<P>
	``Before the explosion of information, we were pretty much  
dependent on what people wrote about themselves or what other 
people wrote about them,'' she said at an awards dinner. 
</P>
<P>
	In the case of the first ladies, Mrs. Clinton said, ``Their  
contributions have often been overlooked.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Clinton described the many ways in which first ladies have  
left their own mark on history, from Eleanor Roosevelt's efforts on 
behalf of civil rights to Betty Ford's work to raise awareness of 
to breast cancer and drug addiction. 
</P>
<P>
	``Many of them have used the platform that history gave them to  
great advantage,'' Mrs. Clinton said. 
</P>
<P>
	She watched as actresses Mary Steenburgen and Jane Alexander  
performed a reading written by first lady historian Carl Sferrazza 
Anthony that captured some words of past first ladies in their 
letters, diaries and interviews. 
</P>
<P>
	Afterward, Mrs. Clinton acknowledged that becoming a first lady  
comes with its own share of pressures and tensions. But these will 
``create not only some issues and problems that one has to address, 
but also some opportunities.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Secretary of State Madeleine Albright, who presented Mrs.  
Clinton with the award, slyly suggested that this first lady might 
capitalize on more opportunities to come. 
</P>
<P>
	``Speaking of your leadership, I join with others in hoping that  
we ain't seen nothing yet,'' Albright said. Mrs. Clinton is 
pondering a run for the New York Senate. 
</P>
<P>
	Albright herself was saluted at the event, as the first female  
secretary of state and for her accomplishments in that post. She 
emphasized womens' commitment to improving their position. 
</P>
<P>
	``We dedicate ourselves to a future of many, many first women  
and even more importantly to a future where no woman is left 
behind,'' Albright said. 
</P>
<P>
	Other honorees included Supreme Court Justice Sandra Day  
O'Connor; Pulitzer Prize winning poet, Gwendolyn Brooks; the first 
African-American woman elected to the U.S. House of 
Representatives, Shirley Chisholm; and Elizabeth Campbell, the 
founder of Washington's WETA Public Television.

<HEADLINE> Reps. Watch Secret Service Training </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BELTSVILLE, Md. (AP) -- Members of Congress touring a Secret  
Service training facility didn't even flinch when they started to 
hear gunfire or felt the ground shake from rocket-propelled 
grenades. 
</P>
<P>
	Instead, they applauded the agents who went after the ``sniper''  
and defended a presidential motorcade against a series of attacks. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's important to get a feel for how they carry out their  
responsibilities and, in this case, how they train for them,'' said 
Rep. Jim Kolbe, R-Ariz., as he watched agents carry out 
demonstrations Tuesday for members of the House Appropriations 
Treasury and postal subcommittee, which oversees the Secret 
Service. 
</P>
<P>
	``Training is everything in the Secret Service,'' said Kolbe,  
who chairs the panel. ``There's no law enforcement agency that 
comes remotely close to the amount of training that the Secret 
Service does on a continuous basis.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Agents at the training facility, which covers more than 300  
acres in this Maryland suburb of Washington, learn everything from 
evasive driving tricks to investigative techniques needed to nab 
counterfeiters and online criminals. New agents must attend a 
12-week program here before they begin work at a field office and 
those in protective duty return for a two-week course every eight 
weeks. 
</P>
<P>
	``We consider training a perishable skill,'' said special agent  
John Tomlinson. ``The only way agents can keep their edge is with 
constant practice.'' 
</P>
<P>
	While touring the facility's ``Tactical Village,'' complete with  
mock hotels, banks and parking garages, lawmakers and their staff 
watched Secret Service agents respond to a sniper attack. They also 
got to see how agents would react to multiple assaults on a 
motorcade. While a gunman fired from inside a van in front, 
rocket-propelled grenades hit from the side, knocking over mail 
boxes and spewing orange smoke and ``fire.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Earlier, lawmakers were treated to rides in shiny Camaros used  
to train agents in evasive driving. The cars wove between cones 
before executing a series of 180-degree ``J'' turns. Tomlinson said 
the wide wheel base and easy maneuverability of Camaros make them 
good practice cars for agents before they graduate to the much 
heavier -- and often armored -- Cadillacs, limousines and sport 
utility vehicles usually associated with presidential motorcades. 
</P>
<P>
	The skills of Secret Service agents will be highly in demand in  
the next year because of the 2000 election since the agency 
protects presidential candidates as well as the president and vice 
president.

<HEADLINE> Gates, Testimony Might Contradict </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Microsoft's Bill Gates, writing in an upcoming  
book about the benefits of technology tools for business, appears 
to contradict a key witness for his company at its antitrust trial 
when he describes how Microsoft tracks important sales figures. 
</P>
<P>
	Gates, the company's billionaire chairman, said he can quickly  
analyze Microsoft's sales records because they're tracked 
electronically. 
</P>
<P>
	But an outside economist testifying for Microsoft just weeks ago  
told a federal judge almost apologetically that the company's 
accounting records were kept ``by hand on sheets of paper.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Economist Richard Schmalensee explained why he couldn't provide  
for the government details about Microsoft's profits, saying the 
company's decidedly low-tech accounting techniques ``do not always 
rise to the level of sophistication one might expect.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Gates, in his new book, ``Business at the Speed of Thought,''  
encourages the widespread use of technology tools. 
</P>
<P>
	``When figures are in electronic form, knowledge workers can  
study them, annotate them, look at them in any amount of detail,'' 
Gates wrote. ``Going digital changes your business.'' 
</P>
<P>
	And in an interview with the Financial Times newspaper, which is  
publishing a four-part series from his book, Gates described how 
Microsoft, with $14.4 billion in sales last year, already uses an 
array of high-tech tools. 
</P>
<P>
	``The sales results are in digital form, so any time I want to I  
can look by country, by product, exactly how sales compare to 
budget, how they compare to other groups,'' Gates said. 
</P>
<P>
	But that wasn't how the company's accounting practices were  
described in sworn testimony for U.S. District Judge Thomas 
Penfield Jackson, who is expected to return a verdict in the case 
this summer. 
</P>
<P>
	Justice Department lawyer David Boies asked Schmalensee, an  
economist at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, about the 
profitability of Microsoft's dominant Windows operating system. 
</P>
<P>
	``I will be honest with you,'' answered Schmalensee.  
``Microsoft's internal accounting systems do not always rise to the 
level of sophistication one might expect from a firm as successful 
as it is.'' 
</P>
<P>
	When Boies pressed him, Schmalensee added: ``They record  
operating system sales by hand on sheets of paper.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Spectators in the courtroom gasped, and Boies immediately told  
the judge, ``Your honor, I have no more questions.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Microsoft spokesman Mark Murray said that Gates was describing  
sales data, while Schmalensee was testifying about methods to track 
profits. 
</P>
<P>
	``We obviously have our sales receipts,'' Murray said, ``but how  
you assign profit is not something that we have'' in digital form. 
</P>
<P>
	The trial testimony wasn't the first time Microsoft's  
record-keeping had been described as low-tech. A 1993 biography of 
the company's chairman, ``Gates,'' said Microsoft first replaced 
its paper ledgers and two checkbooks with a clunky, underpowered 
Radio Shack computer in mid-1981, when it was a $16 million 
company. 
</P>
<P>
	In his book, also serialized in current issues of Time magazine,  
Gates also encourages companies to ``insist that communication flow 
through e-mail.'' He called it ``a key component of our digital 
nervous system.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``There's no doubt that e-mail flattens the hierarchical  
structure of an organization,'' Gates wrote. ``It encourages people 
to speak up. It encourages managers to listen. That's why, when 
customers ask what's the first thing they can do to get more value 
out of their information systems and foster collaboration in their 
companies, I always answer, e-mail.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Throughout the company's antitrust trial, government lawyers  
have produced a string of embarrassing e-mails -- many from Gates 
himself -- that appear to contradict its witnesses. 
</P>
<P>
	Microsoft has protested that lawyers are using ``snippets'' of  
its e-mail taken out of context, and it has produced equally 
humiliating e-mails from some of its business rivals. 
</P>
<P>
	``I do not have a single piece of e-mail of a business nature  
that I would be embarrassed to have made public,'' Gates told the 
Financial Times. ``Every piece of e-mail I have sent over the past 
decade has been read by 50 government lawyers, so there is nothing 
new. I live the examined life.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Microsoft trial is in the midst of a six-week recess and is  
scheduled to resume no earlier than April 12. 
</P>
<P>
	Gates' book goes on sale March 24.

<HEADLINE> Oscar Gowns Auctioned for AIDS </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Who can forget Sharon Stone's black  
Armani-meets-the-Gap ensemble? Or Elizabeth Taylor's periwinkle 
dress? Or Raquel Welch's snug-fitting catsuit? 
</P>
<P>
	They are the fabulous Academy Award get-ups that even the least  
fashion-conscious still remember. And now these luscious frocks 
could be yours. 
</P>
<P>
	From the classy to the wonderfully outrageous, 56 dresses,  
evening gowns and other pieces worn by actresses to Oscar 
ceremonies over the past 30 years were slated for auction tonight. 
</P>
<P>
	Proceeds from the sale of the haute couture clothing at  
Christie's ``Unforgettable: Fashion of the Oscars'' will benefit 
the American Foundation for AIDS Research. 
</P>
<P>
	``I had the idea from the great success of Christie's sale of  
Princess Diana's dresses,'' Tony Award-winning actress Natasha 
Richardson, the event's chairwoman, said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	``I thought of the incredible couture gowns created for the  
Academy Awards each year, all of which are too special to be thrown 
away, but will not be worn again.'' 
</P>
<P>
	While there aren't any required minimum bids, the suggested  
starting point is $2,000. Some of the custom-made gowns could fetch 
more than $50,000, said Andree Corroon, a Christie's spokeswoman. 
</P>
<P>
	The collection includes pieces from the usual suspects --  
Valentino, Calvin Klein, Vera Wang -- to surprises like actress 
Anjelica Huston, who helped design her emerald green crepe evening 
dress in 1985, and Lizzy Gardiner, wore a gown made of American 
Express Gold Cards in 1994. 
</P>
<P>
	The stunning violet-and-blue number Ms. Taylor wore to the 1969  
ceremony is also on the block, as are dresses worn by Ellen Barkin, 
Cher, Lauren Bacall and Kate Winslet. 
</P>
<P>
	The gown showcased Ms. Taylor's tiny waist and voluptuous curves  
but was actually designed to highlight the 69.42-carat diamond 
necklace that husband Richard Burton had given her. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1995, Stone caused a stir by combining a full-length black  
velvet Armani coat over a full-length Valentino skirt with a fluted 
hem and a $22 mock turtleneck from the Gap. 
</P>
<P>
	Seventeen years earlier, Ms. Welch's body-hugging catsuit  
designed by Loriz Azzaro garnered the admiring gaze of, among 
others, co-presenter Dean Martin. 
</P>
<P>
	Gowns worn by Madonna (Theyskens and Gaultier); Minnie Driver  
(Halston); Jennifer Lopez (Badgley Mischka); Julia Roberts (Richard 
Tyler) and Uma Thurman (Prada) also will be auctioned.

<HEADLINE> NHL Suspends Maltby for Four Games </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Kirk Maltby of the Detroit Red Wings was  
suspended for four games by the NHL on Wednesday for slashing 
Colorado Avalanche winger Valeri Kamensky. 
</P>
<P>
	Kamensky's right forearm was fractured by the slash, which  
occurred on Sunday. He had surgery on Monday and is out 
indefinitely. 
</P>
<P>
	``Though the slash was a short chop to Mr. Kamensky's forearm,  
not a baseball-style swing, and was represented by Mr. Maltby as an 
attempt to prevent Mr. Kamensky from reaching the front of the 
Detroit net, a serious injury resulted,'' NHL senior vice-president 
Colin Campbell said in announcing the suspension. 
</P>
<P>
	Maltby's suspension began with Wednesday night's game against  
Phoenix. He will also miss games Friday in Tampa, Sunday at 
Philadelphia and next Wednesday against Buffalo. 
</P>
<P>
	The suspension will cost Maltby $9,375, based on his $450,000 a  
year salary.

<HEADLINE> Paula Jones Says Marriage OK </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SAN MARINO, Calif. (AP) -- Paula Corbin Jones and her husband are  
living apart, but the couple will be reunited in Arkansas soon and 
their marriage isn't in jeopardy, her attorney said. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are not legally separated,'' Mrs. Jones said Wednesday in a  
statement read by attorney Susan Carpenter-McMillan, who said she 
was speaking as an adviser to Mrs. Jones. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Jones, 33, and the couple's two boys recently moved into  
her mother's one-bedroom home in Cabot, Ark., ``so that I could get 
the kids in school in Arkansas and be around my family and 
friends,'' she said in the statement. 
</P>
<P>
	She plans to move to a home about 10 miles from Cabot.  
</P>
<P>
	Steve Jones, 38, who was fired a year ago from his job as a  
counter clerk at Northwest Airlines, stayed behind at the couple's 
Long Beach condominium ``wrapping up matters'' in Southern 
California, Ms. Carpenter-McMillan said. 
</P>
<P>
	The couple, who married in 1991, has had disagreements over  
strategy in her now-settled sexual harassment suit against 
President Clinton, Mrs. Jones said in her statement. 
</P>
<P>
	``There has been a lot of stress through this whole ordeal,''  
she said. ``Also, we did not agree on every single detail regarding 
the case but did have frank and honest discussions concerning the 
Clinton matter and did our best to make the right decisions.'' 
</P>
<P>
	USA Today on Tuesday quoted Mrs. Jones as saying she and her  
husband, Steven, had been discussing a trial separation ``for some 
time.'' She described them as ``not any different than other 
couples'' who live apart because of different ambitions and 
interests. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Jones and Clinton reached an out-of-court settlement of  
$850,000 last November on her claim that Clinton made an improper 
sexual advance to her in a Little Rock hotel room in 1991. 
</P>
<P>
	Her share of the money came to $201,000, with the rest going to  
lawyers.

<HEADLINE> Why NFL Said OK to Instant Replay </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PHOENIX (AP) -- A proposal by NFL commissioner Paul Tagliabue  
swung the vote to reinstate instant replay as an officiating aid 
for the 1999 season. 
</P>
<P>
	It didn't hurt that there were so many controversial calls in  
1998, including officiating blunders that cost Seattle and Buffalo 
victories. 
</P>
<P>
	The new replay system, approved Wednesday for one year, will  
feature coaches' challenge for all but the final two minutes of 
each half and overtime, when the NFL replay assistant in the press 
box will call for reviews. The idea of giving the coaches two 
challenges per game -- which they could use in the first 28 minutes 
of each half -- came from Tagliabue, who wanted to relieve the 
coaches of any considerations but coaching in the final two minutes 
of each half. 
</P>
<P>
	``I want to not have any of those distractions in the last two  
minutes,'' Steelers coach Bill Cowher said. ``That's a time you 
have to be coaching.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Tampa Bay coach Tony Dungy, who voted against replay the last  
two years, changed his mind this time. He also said the removal of 
the coaches' responsibility in the final two minutes of each half 
was significant. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think that created a lot of sentiment for it,'' Dungy said.  
``I think replay was very close the last three to four years, and 
now we had teams that maybe were burned on a call and changed their 
vote.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Seattle coach Mike Holmgren, a cochairman of the competition  
committee and a longtime staunch supporter of replay, always has 
been optimistic about a return of replay, which was dropped in 
1991. It was the system his committee proposed that made the 
difference, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	``There are owners who voted against it for a long time and they  
swung around,'' Holmgren said. ``They said this makes sense and 
voted for it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Cincinnati, Arizona and the New York Jets voted against it. The  
Jets were the only team to go from positive to negative this year. 
</P>
<P>
	``I was afraid of the disruption and distraction,'' Bengals  
president Mike Brown said. ``The attention will be on the calls, 
not the game.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Oakland, another negative voter the last two years, approved  
replay because, owner Al Davis said, ``My coach wanted it. We'll 
try it for a year.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Bills coach Wade Phillips, whose team could have benefitted from  
replay on several key calls -- including one in a close playoff loss 
to Miami -- said he looks forward to the strategy of when to use a 
challenge. If the play is not overturned, the challenging team 
loses a timeout. 
</P>
<P>
	``There will be a lot of studying to see what we can challenge  
and when to challenge,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	The referee will view an on-field monitor and will have up to 90  
seconds to make a decision. The video will shut off at 90 seconds. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is a tool to help an isolated case, the big game-breaker  
type of play,'' Jerry Seeman, NFL director of officials, said. ``We 
don't want it to be overly intrusive.''

<HEADLINE> Stocks Retreat; Dow Down 18.87 / Wall Street Report  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- The Dow Jones industrial average drifted today  
as rising bond market interest rates halted the blue chips' second 
attempt at a close above 10,000. 
</P>
<P>
	At 2 p.m. on Wall Street, the Dow was down 18.87 at 9,911.60, or  
88 points shy of 10,000. On Tuesday, the index briefly passed that 
milestone for the first time before falling back and closing with a 
loss. 
</P>
<P>
	Broader stock indicators were lower today. The Standard &AMP; Poor's  
500 index was down 7.26 at 1,299.12, while the technology-heavy 
Nasdaq composite index was off 6.93 at 2,432.34. 
</P>
<P>
	The Dow made some headway in the first hour of trading today,  
rising as high as 9,960.71, or less than 40 points away from 
10,000. But bond prices backed off, and stocks followed, sending 
the Dow to just under 9,865 in early afternoon. 
</P>
<P>
	Stocks were weakened by a drop in the bond market, where the  
30-year Treasury bond was down 5/16 point at midday, pushing its 
yield to just under 5.5 percent from 5.47 percent late Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Charles Pradilla, chief investment strategist at SG Cowen  
Securities, said the higher yields in the bond market reminded 
investors how expensive stocks are. 
</P>
<P>
	``A lot of very seasoned people are seeing that the market has  
some valuation problems,'' Pradilla said. ``The market's up 10 
percent, and interest rates are up almost 1 percent -- something has 
to shift.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Dow briefly rose past 10,000 Tuesday, climbing to 10,001.78  
just 20 minutes after trading began. But profit-takers descended on 
the market almost immediately, and the Dow finished down 28.30 at 
9,930.47, leaving for another day its first close above 10,000. 
</P>
<P>
	Today the Dow industrials were led lower by technology and  
financial stocks, which fell in reaction to the higher interest 
rates. IBM was down 2 3/8 at 178 5/8. Citigroup was down 1 3/8 at 63 1/8. 
</P>
<P>
	But Dow component Caterpillar was up 2 3/4 at 46 3/4, after Salomon  
Smith Barney upgraded the stock to ``buy'' from ``neutral.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Declining issues outnumbered advancers by a margin of 5 to 3 on  
the New York Stock Exchange, where volume came to 337.61 million 
shares, up slightly from Tuesday's pace of 333.43 million.

<HEADLINE> Garth's Day at Spring Training </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PEORIA, Ariz. (AP) -- How it went for Garth Brooks on Wednesday  
at spring training for the San Diego Padres: 
</P>
<P>
	 *COUNTRY CAMPER:* Manager Bruce Bochy gave Brooks, the country  
singer turned baseball player, his first spring start, against the 
Chicago White Sox in Tucson. With several Padres outfielders 
nursing injuries and unavailable, Brooks played all nine innings in 
a 7-6 win. Playing with a bandage on his left hand to protect a 
blister, Brooks went 0-for-4, with two groundouts, a fly ball with 
two on and two out in the sixth, and a popup. 
</P>
<P>
	 *HIGH NOTE:* In the field, a towering drive by Frank Thomas in  
the first inning sent Brooks back to the fence in left-center, but 
he handled it like a veteran. Brooks had three other chances and 
handled them all. 
</P>
<P>
	 *ON THE RECORD:* ``The ball was out of the ballpark,'' Brooks  
said. ``I just ran to the wall to look good. But the wind kept it 
in. When I made the catch, I thought, `Man, I wish my dad could see 
this.' I had more fun today than in the other 14 days I've been in 
camp.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Thomas was impressed with what he saw. ``He looked like an  
athlete. I think what he's doing is awesome.''

<HEADLINE> House Leaders Consider Pay Raise </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- House leaders have discussed a possible  
cost-of-living increase in the congressional salary of $136,673, 
officials said Thursday. The boost would amount to the second pay 
raise in three years. 
</P>
<P>
	House Speaker Dennis Hastert, R-Ill., broached the issue in a  
meeting earlier this year with Minority Leader Dick Gephardt, 
D-Mo., who was noncommittal, the officials added. 
</P>
<P>
	Under federal law, members of Congress are entitled to an annual  
cost-of-living increase that is linked to the pay raise given to 
federal bureaucrats. President Clinton has proposed an increase of 
4.4 percent for employees in the federal work force for the fiscal 
year that begins Oct. 1. 
</P>
<P>
	An increase of 4 percent for members of Congress would amount to  
more than $5,400 and raise their pay to more than $142,000. 
</P>
<P>
	Hastert ``is in favor of having that law continue,'' said his  
spokesman, John Feehery. 
</P>
<P>
	Laura Nichols, spokeswoman for Gephardt, said proposals for  
increased compensation ``have not been vetted through the caucus 
and he has told the Republican leaders he will take it under 
advisement.'' Gephardt also ``made it clear that whatever we decide 
to do it has to be subjected to a vote'' in the House, she said. 
</P>
<P>
	Apart from a possible pay raise, one senior Republican, Rep.  
Bill Thomas of California, is floating a proposal for a $125 per 
day allowance for lawmakers to defray their living expenses in 
Washington. 
</P>
<P>
	Most lawmakers could claim the money for any day the House  
meets, to be paid from the funds they receive each year for their 
office expenses. Thus, any money the lawmaker claimed personally 
would have to come from staff salaries or other expenses. 
</P>
<P>
	Thomas has suggested making the change administratively by a  
vote of the House Administration Committee, which he chairs, 
officials said. 
</P>
<P>
	Several senior aides, as well as some lawmakers, said Thomas'  
proposal had attracted interest among the members, particularly 
from lawmakers who received a similar benefit when they were 
members of state legislatures. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, they said they doubted it would take effect, and Hastert  
distanced himself from the proposal during the day. ``There are a 
lot of proposals out there and the speaker does not endorse this 
one,'' said Feehery. 
</P>
<P>
	Thomas issued a written statement late in the day saying the  
panel would consider the proposal ``only at the request of the 
House leadership. ...The House Administration Committee, appointed 
by the speaker and the minority leader, would be responsive to the 
leadership,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Other aides and lawmakers noted that any lawmaker could force a  
vote on the proposal when the regular spending bill covering 
congressional expenses goes to the floor, regardless of what action 
the House Administration Committee took. 
</P>
<P>
	Even if Congress met for little more than a third of the year,  
lawmakers would be eligible for more than $14,000 in increased 
compensation -- an increase of more than 10 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	A cost-of-living increase would be far smaller. No formal action  
is expected until this summer, when regular spending bills go to 
the House floor for debate. 
</P>
<P>
	More often than not, lawmakers prevent the raise from taking  
effect by attaching a prohibition to a spending measure. Two years 
ago, though, they decided to allow it to take effect. The increase 
was about $3,000 annually, and took effect with little or no 
evident public backlash. 
</P>
<P>
	Last year, in an election-year session, lawmakers prevented an  
additional cost-of-living increase from taking effect.

<HEADLINE> Starr Aide Subpoenaed by McDougal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LITTLE ROCK, Ark. (AP) -- Using a rare tactic, prosecutors put a  
former Whitewater grand juror on the witness stand at Susan 
McDougal's trial Wednesday to testify that Kenneth Starr's 
investigators were after ``the facts'' and not out to get President 
Clinton. Mrs. McDougal's lawyer responded by subpoenaing a top 
Starr deputy. 
</P>
<P>
	In a flurry at the end of a day in which three former grand  
jurors testified for the prosecution, attorney Mark Geragos issued 
a subpoena to Deputy Independent Counsel W. Hickman Ewing Jr. to 
testify when Mrs. McDougal's defense begins its case Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	Geragos said that Ewing, who oversees Starr's Arkansas office  
but is not part of the current trial team, would be the first 
defense witness, and he would not rule out summoning Starr as well. 
``First let me deal with Hick Ewing,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Asked whether prosecutors would seek to quash the subpoena for  
his appearance, Ewing said, ``I don't think so.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He added, ``We have nothing to hide.''  
</P>
<P>
	However, Ewing signaled a legal dispute over his testimony is  
possible. He said prosecutors were discussing how far afield Mrs. 
McDougal's lawyers should be permitted to range in their 
questioning of the Whitewater prosecutor's office. 
</P>
<P>
	The defense team is eager to change the issue at the trial from  
Mrs. McDougal's defiance of a federal judge's order to testify 
before the Whitewater grand jury to the tactics of Starr's office. 
</P>
<P>
	One of three ex-grand jurors appearing in Susan McDougal's  
criminal contempt trial, Jennifer Castleberry, testified earlier 
Wednesday that when Mrs. McDougal appeared before the grand jury in 
1996, ``We wanted to hear what she had to say.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But the Clintons' former Whitewater partner ``wouldn't talk.''  
</P>
<P>
	``She wanted to give a statement,'' Mrs. Castleberry said. ``She  
would not allow us to read the statement. She refused to answer the 
questions.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Did Mrs. Castleberry believe the attorneys in Starr's office  
``were out to get the Clintons?'' asked prosecutor Julie Myers. 
</P>
<P>
	``No,'' Mrs. Castleberry replied.  
</P>
<P>
	Later, she added: ``They wanted to give us the facts to  
determine whether any crimes were committed.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Federal grand jurors, who meet in secrecy to weigh whether to  
bring criminal charges, are seldom named publicly, much less called 
as witnesses. Ewing, a federal prosecutor for 25 years, said he had 
never seen it done before. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. McDougal's lawyer, Mark Geragos, said grand jurors are  
almost never called, the exceptions usually being cases alleging an 
improper effort to influence a grand jury. 
</P>
<P>
	In this case, prosecutor Mark Barrett said he needed the  
testimony to show corrupt intent by Mrs. McDougal in avoiding 
questions before the grand jurors, who had come from around 
Arkansas to gather facts. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. McDougal's lawyer, Geragos, argued that his client didn't  
want to answer questions because overzealous prosecutors were 
trying to force her to give false testimony against the president 
and first lady Hillary Rodham Clinton. 
</P>
<P>
	The Whitewater grand jury was ``only fed a certain amount of  
information; the most important things were left out,'' Geragos 
said outside the courthouse. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. McDougal, facing criminal contempt and obstruction charges,  
does plan to testify at her trial, Geragos has said. 
</P>
<P>
	The McDougal jurors appeared to listen more attentively to the  
testimony of the grand jurors -- in a sense, their peers -- than they 
had to some other witnesses, such as FBI agents describing complex 
financial transactions. 
</P>
<P>
	The grand jurors met four days a month for two years, beginning  
in May 1996, to hear testimony in Starr's investigation of the 
Clintons' business dealings. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Castleberry is from Mayflower, a tiny town 20 miles north  
of Little Rock. Foreman John Washam, from Jonesboro, also 
testified, as did Marsha High, who lives in Biggers, 140 miles 
northeast of Little Rock. 
</P>
<P>
	``I thought she had evidence we needed,'' Mrs. High said of Mrs.  
McDougal. ``I still think she has answers we don't know about.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Prosecutors wanted to ask Mrs. McDougal about her Whitewater  
business partnership with the Clintons, including a $27,600 loan 
for the land development taken out in Bill Clinton's name from the 
McDougals' savings and loan. The president has testified he never 
borrowed money from the S&AMP;L. 
</P>
<P>
	Geragos said testimony from Mrs. Castleberry proved the panel of  
23 citizens who investigated the Clintons had a ``cozy 
relationship'' with Starr's office. 
</P>
<P>
	He asked her whether she had ``warm feelings'' toward the  
prosecutors. 
</P>
<P>
	``Yes,'' replied the mother of three, who had to quit the grand  
jury in 1997 when she was pregnant. Her husband sat in the back 
row, watching intently. 
</P>
<P>
	Geragos elicited from Mrs. Castleberry the fact that prosecutors  
hadn't told the grand jury about financial assistance by Starr's 
office to their two chief witnesses, James McDougal and David Hale. 
Hale got at least $60,000 for living expenses. Prosecutors helped 
arrange housing for McDougal until he went to prison, where he 
died. 
</P>
<P>
	What basis did she have for concluding that Starr's prosecutors  
weren't out to get the Clintons? ``Their conduct,'' Mrs. 
Castleberry answered.

<HEADLINE> Fla. Optometrist Charged in Arsons </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ORANGE PARK, Fla. (AP) -- A prominent optometrist was accused of  
hiring people to set fire to several of his homes so he could 
collect insurance money. 
</P>
<P>
	Robert Timothy Carter, 58, was charged Tuesday with  
racketeering, arson and burning to defraud an insurer. 
</P>
<P>
	Two men accused of helping Carter, James Edward Comer, 54, and  
his son, William, 27, also were charged with arson and burning to 
defraud. They each were being held Wednesday on $250,000 bond. 
</P>
<P>
	Police say Carter collected about $256,000 in insurance payments  
since 1996. His attorney, Hank Coxe, declined to comment. 
</P>
<P>
	Police say an informant told them he was hired in 1996 to burn  
several duplexes and a two-story beach house owned by Carter. 
Another informant later said he saw someone pouring a liquid around 
a mobile home owned by Carter before setting fire to it in June 
1997. 
</P>
<P>
	Police said Carter collected insurance money in each case.

<HEADLINE> Juror Testifies in McDougal Case </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LITTLE ROCK, Ark. (AP) -- In an unusual move by the prosecution,  
a Whitewater grand juror took the witness stand today in Susan 
McDougal's trial and said she never felt Kenneth Starr's 
prosecutors were out to get President Clinton or the first lady. 
</P>
<P>
	It is rare that grand jurors, who meet in secrecy to weigh  
whether to bring criminal charges, are called as witnesses or even 
named publicly. 
</P>
<P>
	But prosecutors said in this case, the grand jury is considered  
the victim of the alleged crime -- Mrs. McDougal's refusal to answer 
questions during the grand jury's investigation. Mrs. McDougal 
alleges that prosecutors wanted her to give false testimony against 
the Clintons. 
</P>
<P>
	The witness, Jennifer Castleberry of Mayflower, a small town 20  
miles north of Little Rock, served on the grand jury investigating 
the Clintons' Whitewater business dealings from May 1996 to 
September 1997, leaving early to give birth to her third child, now 
1 year old. 
</P>
<P>
	She was present on one occasion when Mrs. McDougal refused to  
testify. 
</P>
<P>
	``She wouldn't talk,'' Mrs. Castleberry testified. ``She wanted  
to give a statement. She would not allow us to read the statement. 
She refused to answer the questions.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Castleberry said the grand jurors met for about 15 or 20  
minutes, out of the presence of Mrs. McDougal or the prosecutors, 
to consider whether to let her read the statement. They decided to 
deny the request. 
</P>
<P>
	The grand jurors wanted to hear Mrs. McDougal testify because of  
her role as part owner of the Whitewater land development and the 
failed savings and loan at the heart of the case, Mrs. Castleberry 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	``We wanted to hear what she had to say,'' said Mrs.  
Castleberry, who spoke in a voice so soft that people in the 
courtroom strained to hear. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. McDougal was questioned by Ray Jahn, a Starr prosecutor who  
earlier had won four felony convictions against her for receiving a 
fraudulent $300,000 federally backed loan. 
</P>
<P>
	The grand juror said Jahn's demeanor during the questioning was  
pleasant and he used a ``normal tone of voice that he uses with all 
the witnesses.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Were you out to get the Clintons?'' prosecutor Julie Myers  
asked the grand juror. 
</P>
<P>
	``No,'' she replied.  
</P>
<P>
	Myers also asked whether Starr's office was out to get the  
Clintons, or out to get anyone else. ``No,'' Mrs. Castleberry 
answered each time. 
</P>
<P>
	``They wanted to give us the facts to determine whether any  
crimes were committed,'' she said. Under questioning, it was clear 
that she was familiar with the details of the complicated 
Whitewater loans and business deal. 
</P>
<P>
	During cross-examination, defense lawyer Mark Geragos attacked  
the credibility of two key witnesses whom prosecutors brought 
before the grand jury: Mrs. McDougal's husband, James, and David 
Hale. 
</P>
<P>
	He asked whether prosecutors told the grand jurors that James  
McDougal, after his own felony conviction, had changed his story 
about whether Clinton knew about a fraudulent loan. 
</P>
<P>
	``I knew he changed his story,'' Mrs. Castleberry said. ``I  
don't know if they told me that, but I knew that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Geragos asked whether she knew there was an investigation into  
whether David Hale had received payoffs from conservative 
activists. No, she said. 
</P>
<P>
	Beginning to wrap up their case, prosecutors showed a videotape  
Tuesday of first lady Hillary Rodham Clinton's grand jury testimony 
in the case. 
</P>
<P>
	Two days after Mrs. McDougal's refusal to respond in her 1998  
grand jury appearance, Mrs. Clinton answered some of the same 
questions, declaring in videotaped testimony that she has no 
knowledge of a $27,600 Whitewater loan in her husband's name and is 
unaware of how it was paid off. 
</P>
<P>
	The centerpiece of the trial, the $27,600 cashier's check made  
out to ``Bill Clinton,'' is linked through a series of transactions 
to a fraudulent $300,000 loan to Mrs. McDougal. 
</P>
<P>
	The first lady testified that she ``never spent any significant  
time at all'' monitoring the records of the Whitewater real estate 
venture. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Clinton also said she didn't know anything about a  
$5,081.82 check signed by Mrs. McDougal and bearing the notation 
``payoff Clinton.'' The check was used to make a payment on the 
$27,600 Clinton loan, the prosecution says.

<HEADLINE> Killer of Secretary To Be Sentenced </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WILMINGTON, Del. (AP) -- There are two options for Thomas Capano,  
the once prominent lawyer convicted of murdering his former 
mistress: life in prison or death by injection, as a jury has 
recommended. 
</P>
<P>
	His sentencing by Superior Court Judge William Lee was scheduled  
for today. 
</P>
<P>
	Capano, 49, a former state prosecutor and political adviser, was  
convicted in January of murdering Anne Marie Fahey, scheduling 
secretary to Delaware Gov. Thomas Carper, who disappeared in June 
1996. 
</P>
<P>
	A member of a wealthy and influential Wilmington family, Capano  
admitted at trial to dumping Ms. Fahey's body in the Atlantic 
Ocean, but said she died at the hands of another mistress who found 
them together. 
</P>
<P>
	Capano said the other woman, Deborah MacIntyre, accidentally  
shot Ms. Fahey in the head in a jealous, suicidal rage, and that he 
got rid of her body -- dumping it from his brother's boat -- to 
protect himself and her. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. MacIntyre denied even being at his house the night Ms. Fahey  
died. 
</P>
<P>
	Prosecutors, who asked for the death penalty, alleged that  
Capano killed Ms. Fahey because she wanted to end her secret, 
three-year affair with the married man. Without a body or a murder 
weapon, it took years to make a case against Capano. 
</P>
<P>
	Finally, in November 1997, Capano's younger brother, Gerard,  
came forward, telling investigators he was with Thomas Capano on 
June 28, 1996, when the two dumped a body from his boat 70 miles 
off the New Jersey coast. 
</P>
<P>
	The Capano case is far from over. Ms. Fahey's family has filed a  
wrongful death suit against Capano. They also have sued his 
brothers and their businesses -- the family fortune was built on 
real estate and development -- saying they helped cover up Ms. 
Fahey's disappearance.

<HEADLINE> Oil Surges on Saudi Output-Cut Plan  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	Crude oil prices surged higher on the New York Mercantile  
Exchange Wednesday on news that Saudi Arabia has specific 
production cuts in mind to boost prices. 
</P>
<P>
	In other markets, grains rose while soybeans were mixed.  
</P>
<P>
	Crude oil futures hit a five-month high Wednesday with news that  
Saudi Arabia plans to cut production by 580,000 barrels a day, 
analysts said. That was at the high end of what market participants 
expected from the world's biggest oil producer. 
</P>
<P>
	Saudi Arabia, Iran, Venezuela and Mexico recently reached  
agreement on a plan to cut production to boost sagging oil prices. 
All members of the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting 
Countries except Iraq have committed to the cutbacks. 
</P>
<P>
	The agreement still must be formally approved at the OPEC  
meeting next Tuesday in Vienna, Austria, but the news from Saudi 
Arabia was positive. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a concrete signal of their seriousness to cut output and  
get prices up,'' said Bill O'Grady, a vice president at A.G. 
Edwards &AMP; Sons in St. Louis. ``They haven't really had their heart 
in this until now.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Unleaded gasoline prices also surged on lower-than-expected U.S.  
gasoline inventories. That, coupled with demand running above last 
year and the warm-weather driving season around the corner, drove 
prices higher. 
</P>
<P>
	Crude oil for April delivery rose 59 cents to $15.05 a barrel;  
April heating oil rose 1.91 cents to 39.68 cents a gallon; April 
unleaded gasoline rose 2.53 cents to 47.20 cents a gallon; April 
natural gas fell .31 cents to $1.748 for each 1,000 cubic feet. 
</P>
<P>
	Grain futures were higher and soybeans mixed in Wednesday's  
dealings on the Chicago Board of Trade. 
</P>
<P>
	Soybeans struggled amid confusion over a crop production  
estimate out of Argentina. The report was initially thought to be 
bullish, but then Argentinian officials called that interpretation 
incorrect. 
</P>
<P>
	There was also confusion over whether a rumored U.S. government  
set-aside, which could idle millions of acres of farm land, will 
occur this year. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, U.S. Agriculture Secretary Dan Glickman said  
Wednesday he may request a $1 billion aid package for U.S. soybean 
exporters. 
</P>
<P>
	Wheat futures closed higher but gave up gains made earlier in  
the day amid doubts about the acreage set-aside. 
</P>
<P>
	Corn was higher Wednesday, receiving support from news the  
United States may lift its ban on agricultural sales to Iran. 
</P>
<P>
	Wheat for May delivery was up 1 1/4 cents to $2.77 3/4 a bushel; May  
corn was up 2 cents to $2.25 3/4 a bushel; May oats were up 1 cent to 
$1.11 1/2 a bushel; May soybeans were off 1 1/2 cents to $4.81 1/4 a bushel. 
</P>
<P>
	Live cattle and feeder cattle futures were mixed on the Chicago  
Mercantile Exchange, while lean hogs were higher and pork bellies 
were lower. 
</P>
<P>
	April live cattle futures rose 0.12 cent to 66.87 cents a pound;  
March feeder cattle were up 0.03 cent to 72.00 cents per pound; 
April lean hogs were up 0.05 cent to 40.97 cents a pound; and May 
pork bellies were off 0.65 cent to 50.47 cents per pound.

<HEADLINE>  Cubs' Wood Future Very Uncertain </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MESA, Ariz. (AP) -- Kerry Wood knew this could happen, ever since  
he was 12 years old, when replays of Dave Dravecky's chilling 
injury flashed over and over on TV, filling the boy with worry. 
</P>
<P>
	While vendors sold spring training programs with Wood's picture  
on the cover Wednesday, the Chicago Cubs were still coming to grips 
with the fact that the NL Rookie of the Year's season was over 
after just 26 spring training pitches. 
</P>
<P>
	Wood's right elbow was once Chicago's hope, but all has changed  
now. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've thought about this from the first time I saw the video --  
I can't remember his name now -- he threw one pitch and his arm 
broke,'' Wood said of the day in 1989 when Dravecky was on the 
mound for San Francisco. 
</P>
<P>
	Wood was back at HoHoKam Park on Wednesday. His teammates were  
on the field, getting ready to play the Arizona Diamondbacks. Wood, 
in blue jeans and a cap as black as the Cubs' mood, was up in a 
luxury suite, talking about how doctors will take a ligament from 
his left wrist and transplant it into his right elbow to replace 
the one he tore Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
	He's not even sure if he'll return in time for the start of the  
2000 season. 
</P>
<P>
	``I haven't even had the surgery yet. It's too early to think  
about when I'm going to be back,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	His 95 mph fastball, the one that delighted baseball last  
summer, the one that enabled him to strike out a record-tying 20 
against Houston last May, may never come back. He talked about how 
it was the work ethic of the individual that would make the 
difference. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've played with guys who had the surgery,'' he said.  
``Sometimes guys were throwing harder and pitching better than 
before they were hurt.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Rehabilitation usually takes about a year, but sometimes it's  
less and sometimes it's more. He's had elbow pain since high 
school, but refused to blame the injury on his coaches, amateur and 
pro. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's safe to say it was inevitable,'' he said. ``From the time  
my velocity picked up and I started to throw harder, I felt it 
could happen on any given day.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Wood had only 13 of the Cubs' 90 wins last season, but he  
brought excitement to Wrigley Field and everywhere he went. He was 
the next Nolan Ryan, the next Roger Clemens, a flamethrower from 
Texas who grabbed headlines with his heater. 
</P>
<P>
	``On the day he pitched, you'd go to the ballpark with an extra  
bounce in your step,'' Cubs president Andy MacPhail said. 
</P>
<P>
	Wood will get a second opinion, just to make sure he needs the  
transplant, then choose Dr. Lewis Yocum, the Anaheim Angels team 
physician, or Dr. James Andrews to put his elbow back together. 
</P>
<P>
	When he comes back, he'll have to change his delivery some more,  
taking stress off the reconstructed elbow. Already, the Cubs had 
tried to get him to stop throwing across his body, to plant his 
left foot another seven or eight inches toward the middle of the 
field. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's tough to change when you're throwing the ball good,'' he  
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Then came his first warmup pitch before the second inning  
against Anaheim at Tempe. It was about 10 feet above the ground. 
Wood knew something was wrong but kept on pitching, still throwing 
95 mph.

	``Just because one player goes out, to say the whole season is  
shot, that's not fair,'' he said. ``We have a great team and I 
think we're going to bounce back.''

<HEADLINE> Galarraga Determined To Beat Cancer </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	KISSIMMEE, Fla. (AP) -- He smiled, posed for pictures and looked  
forward to his next big game at the plate. The worst part of the 
day for Andres Galarraga was not being in uniform. 
</P>
<P>
	``I love baseball so much,'' the Atlanta Braves star, speaking  
publicly for the first time since being diagnosed with cancer, said 
Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	``To be here is special ... Just talking to these guys about the  
game helps a lot. I think it helps them, too. '' 
</P>
<P>
	The slugger, who hit .305 with 44 home runs and 121 RBIs last  
season, wore sunglasses and a big smile as he answered questions -- 
many of them in Spanish -- for about 45 minutes at the Braves' 
spring training complex at Disney World. 
</P>
<P>
	He said he was shocked when doctors discovered a cancerous tumor  
in his lower back Feb. 18, but remains confident he will recover 
and return to the Braves' lineup next season. 
</P>
<P>
	``I was surprised when they told me,'' Galarraga said. ``I still  
can't believe it. I feel good. I feel healthy. 
</P>
<P>
	``It scared me a lot. But as soon as they said they had the  
medicine to treat it and make me 100 percent, that made me feel 
better right away.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The 37-year-old first baseman began chemotherapy last month. His  
second treatment is scheduled for Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	``The first three days are probably the most difficult,'' said  
Galarraga, who experienced nausea and headaches after the initial 
treatment. 
</P>
<P>
	``But after a while I began to feel better. If that's what's  
going to make me better, then I can hang with those three days.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Fans gave Galarraga a standing ovation before Wednesday's game  
between the Braves and Detroit Tigers, and Disney presented him 
with a 14-by-6 foot get-well card bearing more than 2,500 
signatures. 
</P>
<P>
	He's received thousands of letters and also heard from Darryl  
Strawberry, Eric Davis and Brett Butler, who overcame bouts with 
cancer to rejoin their teams. 
</P>
<P>
	``That's probably the best medicine for me,'' he said.  
</P>
<P>
	The Braves surprised Galarraga on Monday when two busloads of  
teammates stopped by his West Palm Beach home on their way to an 
exhibition game. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's good to see him talking upbeat and coming back as soon as  
he can,'' third baseman Chipper Jones said. ``That was motivation 
for me when I got hurt, setting a goal of trying to make it back by 
the end of the year. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think it would bring up more emotion if he looked different.  
It doesn't look like anything's wrong with him. He's still the same 
old happy-go-lucky person.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Teammate Ozzie Guillen, who like Galarraga was born in  
Venezeula, said the slugger's illness still was a big story in 
their native country. 
</P>
<P>
	``That's the worst news we've heard in a long time,'' Guillen  
said. 
</P>
<P>
	``A lot of people didn't believe what happened. When you say  
cancer, people think you're going to die. The country was in shock, 
and they're still talking about it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Galarraga signed a $24.75 million, three-year contract with the  
Braves before the 1998 season. He's a .290 career hitter and a 
popular player who Braves manager Bobby Cox said can't be replaced 
-- on or off the field. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's a special guy, and you don't replace those types of  
people,'' said Cox, whose mother and father both died of cancer. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're going to miss him. Hopefully he will be back next year.  
We're going to have his uniform number waiting. Hopefully toward 
the end of the season we're doing well and in the playoffs and have 
another crack at the World Series, and he can be in the clubhouse 
with us. ... Having him around would be a great inspiration.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Galarraga injured his back late last season. The cancerous tumor  
was discovered when doctors performed a MRI to determine the cause 
of pain that persisted over the winter. 
</P>
<P>
	During his treatments, Galarraga will be limited to exercising  
in a swimming pool five days a week. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm going to try to stay in shape and get back as soon as  
possible,'' Galarraga said. ``For next year, I think just being in 
uniform will make me strong mentally, and that will help me have a 
good year.''

<HEADLINE>  Cubs' Wood Future Very Uncertain </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MESA, Ariz. (AP) -- Kerry Wood knew this could happen, ever since  
he was 12 years old, when replays of Dave Dravecky's chilling 
injury flashed over and over on TV, filling the boy with worry. 
</P>
<P>
	While vendors sold spring training programs with Wood's picture  
on the cover Wednesday, the Chicago Cubs were still coming to grips 
with the fact that the NL Rookie of the Year's season was over 
after just 26 spring training pitches. 
</P>
<P>
	Wood's right elbow was once Chicago's hope, but all has changed  
now. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've thought about this from the first time I saw the video --  
I can't remember his name now -- he threw one pitch and his arm 
broke,'' Wood said of the day in 1989 when Dravecky was on the 
mound for San Francisco. 
</P>
<P>
	Wood was back at HoHoKam Park on Wednesday. His teammates were  
on the field, getting ready to play the Arizona Diamondbacks. Wood, 
in blue jeans and a cap as black as the Cubs' mood, was up in a 
luxury suite, talking about how doctors will take a ligament from 
his left wrist and transplant it into his right elbow to replace 
the one he tore Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
	He's not even sure if he'll return in time for the start of the  
2000 season. 
</P>
<P>
	``I haven't even had the surgery yet. It's too early to think  
about when I'm going to be back,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	His 95 mph fastball, the one that delighted baseball last  
summer, the one that enabled him to strike out a record-tying 20 
against Houston last May, may never come back. He talked about how 
it was the work ethic of the individual that would make the 
difference. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've played with guys who had the surgery,'' he said.  
``Sometimes guys were throwing harder and pitching better than 
before they were hurt.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Rehabilitation usually takes about a year, but sometimes it's  
less and sometimes it's more. He's had elbow pain since high 
school, but refused to blame the injury on his coaches, amateur and 
pro. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's safe to say it was inevitable,'' he said. ``From the time  
my velocity picked up and I started to throw harder, I felt it 
could happen on any given day.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Wood had only 13 of the Cubs' 90 wins last season, but he  
brought excitement to Wrigley Field and everywhere he went. He was 
the next Nolan Ryan, the next Roger Clemens, a flamethrower from 
Texas who grabbed headlines with his heater. 
</P>
<P>
	``On the day he pitched, you'd go to the ballpark with an extra  
bounce in your step,'' Cubs president Andy MacPhail said. 
</P>
<P>
	Wood will get a second opinion, just to make sure he needs the  
transplant, then choose Dr. Lewis Yocum, the Anaheim Angels team 
physician, or Dr. James Andrews to put his elbow back together. 
</P>
<P>
	When he comes back, he'll have to change his delivery some more,  
taking stress off the reconstructed elbow. Already, the Cubs had 
tried to get him to stop throwing across his body, to plant his 
left foot another seven or eight inches toward the middle of the 
field. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's tough to change when you're throwing the ball good,'' he  
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Then came his first warmup pitch before the second inning  
against Anaheim at Tempe. It was about 10 feet above the ground. 
Wood knew something was wrong but kept on pitching, still throwing 
95 mph. 
</P>
<P>
	``It wasn't something that startled me or gave me a great deal  
of pain,'' he said. ``Pitchers have kinks early in the spring.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The kink turned out to be a major breakdown, a torn ulnar  
ligament. 
</P>
<P>
	With opening day nearly three weeks away, Wrigley's bleachers  
bums already had reason to cry in their beers. 
</P>
<P>
	For a franchise searching for its first pennant since 1945 and  
its first World Series title since 1908, Wood was the hope. Yes, 
Sammy Sosa provided the power, but pitching wins. 
</P>
<P>
	Many Cubs fans are ready to write off the team for the rest of  
the century, not surprising given the history. Wood says they 
shouldn't give up. 
</P>
<P>
	``Just because one player goes out, to say the whole season is  
shot, that's not fair,'' he said. ``We have a great team and I 
think we're going to bounce back.''

<HEADLINE> Japanese Stocks Higher at Midday / Japanese Stocks  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TOKYO (AP) -- Japanese stocks edged higher Thursday morning as  
investors snapped up banking and securities shares. The dollar was 
lower against the yen. 
</P>
<P>
	The benchmark 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average rose 12.23 points,  
or 0.08 percent, to 16,280.34 at the end of the morning session. On 
Wednesday, the average closed up 195.29 points, or 1.22 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	The dollar bought 118.42 yen in early trading, down 0.22 yen  
from late Wednesday in Tokyo but above its late New York level of 
118.01 yen overnight. 
</P>
<P>
	On the stock market, prices started lower on profit-taking  
following recent sharp gains and an overnight drop on Wall Street. 
But a wave of bargain-hunting and buying of financial institution 
shares helped stock prices rally. 
</P>
<P>
	Traders said the market's ability to rebound so quickly suggests  
sentiment remains firm. 
</P>
<P>
	The Nikkei average had gained some 750 points in the last three  
trading days on continued foreign buying amid a sense the Japanese 
economy is gradually bottoming out. 
</P>
<P>
	In New York, the Dow Jones industrial average fell 51.06 points  
to 9,879.41 at Wednesday's close, a day after briefly passing the 
10,000 milestone. 
</P>
<P>
	The broader Tokyo Stock Price Index of all issues listed on the  
first section rose 12.43 points, or 0.99 percent, to 1,272.52 
points. The TOPIX closed up 19.20 points, or 1.55 percent, the day 
before. 
</P>
<P>
	In currency dealings, the dollar moved higher from its overnight  
New York level as strong buying interest from Japanese 
institutional investors remained in the market. 
</P>
<P>
	Traders said dollar-buying followed a persistent market rumor  
that Eisuke Sakakibara, Japan's influential vice finance minister 
for international affairs, told some Japanese trust banks and 
institutional investors Tuesday evening that they should buy the 
U.S. currency and invest in foreign bonds. 
</P>
<P>
	Foreign funds also bought dollars following comments by a  
Japanese official that were interpreted as being dollar supportive. 
</P>
<P>
	The head of the Finance Ministry's international bureau,  
Haruhiko Kuroda, reiterated his stance that, ``Stable foreign 
exchange is desirable.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Kuroda himself doesn't want the yen to appreciate, so when he  
talks about stability that's what he means,'' said Hajime Sato, 
assistant general manager of the treasury department at Daiwa 
International Trust Bank. 
</P>
<P>
	In other currencies, the euro was traded at 130.46 yen, down  
from 130.76 yen late Wednesday in Tokyo. 
</P>
<P>
	The yield on the benchmark No. 203 10-year Japanese government  
bond fell to 1.645 from Wednesday's close of 1.705 percent, driving 
its price up to 101.08 from 100.75 yen.

<HEADLINE> Snake Fence Troubles Valley </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	FISHKILL, N.Y. (AP) -- Jay Montfort put a fence around his stone  
company's property to keep out the rattlesnakes. 
</P>
<P>
	``They're rattlesnakes. They're poisonous. They're deadly,'' he  
says. ``It seems pretty fundamental that you should be able to keep 
deadly things off your property.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Not in this case.  
</P>
<P>
	Timber rattlesnakes are a threatened species in New York, and  
the state claims the fence violates New York's Endangered Species 
Act. 
</P>
<P>
	Lawyers for the state will be in court as early as Friday to ask  
that the 4-foot wire-mesh fence be torn down before the snakes stir 
from hibernation. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have an obligation to protect not only the attractive  
species, but the rattlesnakes and the other less cuddly animals 
that make up the biodiversity of the state of New York,'' says 
Richard Brodsky, chairman of the state Assembly's environmental 
conservation committee. 
</P>
<P>
	The state claims the fence would have the effect of  
``disturbing, harrying and worrying'' the dozens of snakes. 
Theodore Kerpez, a state wildlife biologist, says in court papers 
that the fence would block the snakes from their usual places to 
hunt, bask in the sun and reproduce, and would probably cause them 
``physiological stress.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The snake fight in this suburban area north of New York City has  
become intertwined with a larger controversy dating to 1990. 
</P>
<P>
	That's when the Montfort family's quarry and cement-block  
business applied for permission from the state Department of 
Environmental Conservation to mine rock from the parcel of land, 
which runs along the bottom portion of the Sour Mountain ridge in 
the Hudson River Valley. 
</P>
<P>
	Among the environmentalists opposed was Scenic Hudson, which  
owns the top of the wooded ridge. Warren Reiss of Scenic Hudson 
said the mine would scar the land, kick up dust, make noise and 
perhaps contaminate groundwater. 
</P>
<P>
	Other residents have said they are happy about the 50 full-time  
jobs Montfort says the project would bring. The Fishkill town board 
has supported it. 
</P>
<P>
	The controversy simmered as the Sour Mountain application wended  
its way through New York's environmental review process. Then, in 
1996, an off-duty state wildlife employee discovered the 
rattlesnake den 260 feet from the Sour Mountain property. 
</P>
<P>
	The state soon demanded a new report from Montfort assessing the  
effect the mining would have on the rattlesnake den, which Reiss 
says may have existed for up to 7,000 years. 
</P>
<P>
	Accusing the state of a stall tactic, Montfort's company instead  
sued the DEC to force a resolution of the other environmental 
issues before studying the snakes. He has cast the issue as 
rattlesnakes vs. jobs. 
</P>
<P>
	``What is it, Governor Pataki? Rattlesnakes or jobs? Brie and  
champagne or business and employment?'' Montfort employee Scott 
Birkler said in an open letter on the company's Web site. 
</P>
<P>
	Montfort accuses the state of colluding with the  
environmentalists who want to stop the mining. DEC spokesman Sam 
Thernstrom denies it: ``The administration is working according to 
law, regulation and common sense.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Nothing is going on at the Sour Mountain site right now. The  
main Monfort Bros. manufacturing plant is in Fishkill, a few miles 
away. 
</P>
<P>
	The roughly two-mile fence started going up in January, but the  
state persuaded a judge on March 5 to halt construction. 
</P>
<P>
	A hearing on whether to tear down the half-completed fence is  
being expedited because the rattlesnakes are expected to wake from 
their winter's sleep soon.

<HEADLINE> Grains Rise; Soybeans Mixed / Board of Trade  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- Grain futures were higher and soybeans mixed in  
Wednesday's dealings on the Chicago Board of Trade. 
</P>
<P>
	Soybeans struggled amid confusion over a crop production  
estimate out of Argentina. The report was initially thought to be 
bullish, but then Argentinian officials called that interpretation 
incorrect. 
</P>
<P>
	There was also confusion over whether a rumored U.S. government  
set-aside, which could idle millions of acres of farm land, will 
occur this year. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, U.S. Agriculture Secretary Dan Glickman said  
Wednesday he may request a $1 billion aid package for U.S. soybean 
exporters. 
</P>
<P>
	Wheat futures closed higher but gave up gains made earlier in  
the day amid doubts about the acreage set-aside. 
</P>
<P>
	Corn was higher Wednesday, receiving support from news the  
United States may lift its ban on agricultural sales to Iran. 
</P>
<P>
	Wheat for May delivery was up 1 1/4 cents to $2.77 3/4 a bushel; May  
corn was up 2 cents to $2.25 3/4 a bushel; May oats were up 1 cent to 
$1.11 1/2 a bushel; May soybeans were off 1 1/2 cents to $4.81 1/4 a bushel. 
</P>
<P>
	Live cattle and feeder cattle futures were mixed on the Chicago  
Mercantile Exchange, while lean hogs were higher and pork bellies 
were lower. 
</P>
<P>
	April live cattle futures rose 0.12 cent to 66.87 cents a pound;  
March feeder cattle were up 0.03 cent to 72.00 cents per pound; 
April lean hogs were up 0.05 cent to 40.97 cents a pound; and May 
pork bellies were off 0.65 cent to 50.47 cents per pound.

<HEADLINE> Netscape Shareholders OK Merger </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MOUNTAIN VIEW, Calif. (AP) -- Shortly after America Online Inc.  
revealed it would buy Netscape Communications Corp., AOL chairman 
Steve Case flew out to the Web software pioneer's headquarters to 
address its workers. The subject was hairy. 
</P>
<P>
	``You can still bring your dogs to work,'' he told a cheering  
crowd of 2,000 Netscape employees. 
</P>
<P>
	That comment, related by several attendees, seemed no small  
concession from a company whose cautious corporate culture, some 
feared, could snuff out the freewheeling creativity of Netscape. 
</P>
<P>
	Netscape shareholders voted overwhelmingly this morning in favor  
of the $9.6 billion deal, completing AOL's acquisition. But the 
real work in combining these very different companies is just 
starting. 
</P>
<P>
	AOL's ability to soothe Netscape's coveted army of software  
designers is key to creating what could be a powerful new threat to 
Microsoft's computer software dominance. 
</P>
<P>
	AOL becomes the distributor of Netscape's Internet browser  
software and adds the Netcenter Web site, giving it two of the four 
most popular Internet destinations. Also part of the deal, Sun 
Microsystems Inc., a maker of business software and computers, will 
distribute Netscape's corporate software for three years. 
</P>
<P>
	So far, AOL's assurances to Netscape staff appear to be working.  
Common goals, such as making the Internet easy to navigate, are 
helping to bridge the divide of culture and distance. 
</P>
<P>
	Relatively few Netscape employees have quit since the Nov. 24  
agreement, thanks in part to Case's promise to pay an extra month's 
salary as a bonus for sticking around. Others are waiting for 
Netscape stock options to take effect so they can sell stock at fat 
profits. 
</P>
<P>
	Netscape's Marc Andreessen, who co-invented the first widely  
used browser for finding and retrieving Internet information, 
signed on as chief technology officer of AOL. 
</P>
<P>
	``The reason I'm here is because they have a really good  
story,'' Andreessen, 27, said Monday from his car phone near AOL's 
Dulles, Va. headquarters. Though not discussing pay, he recently 
bought a Virginia ``starter palace'' so he can shuttle from his 
Palo Alto, Calif. home. The hardest choice is which home his three 
dogs will live in. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, the differences that make the marriage a leap of faith  
were apparent in visits this year to the companies' headquarters 
3,000 miles apart. 
</P>
<P>
	It's tough to find AOL subscribers, and there are 16 million of  
them, in Netscape's Mountain View, Calif. offices. While Netscape 
created the tool for people to surf the Net on their own, AOL 
supplies neatly organized channels of information for ``newbies,'' 
or Internet beginners who otherwise might be groping. 
</P>
<P>
	Netscape conference rooms are named after Dennis the Menace and  
other cartoon characters. One top software manager wore his hair 
shoulder-length, and sported black fingernail polish and a T-shirt 
emblazoned with a heavy-metal band logo. 
</P>
<P>
	In contrast, America Online's halls are dotted with posters  
touting ``Valued Work Behaviors'' and ``Valued Leadership 
Abilities.'' While many of its 10,000 employees playfully decorate 
their offices -- giant chess pieces adorn the online games 
department -- the company's corporate-sounding ``Mission Statement'' 
is carved into common entrances. 
</P>
<P>
	Such platitudes seem bound to rankle freer spirits.  
</P>
<P>
	While AOL pledges to keep Netscape autonomous with separate  
headquarters and staff, it may merge some overlapping parts. 
Netscape also could be hit by cuts in divisions that make software 
already made by Sun Microsystems, observers say. Morale may suffer 
due to the departure of James Barksdale, Netscape's well-liked 
chief executive. 
</P>
<P>
	The physical distance is a challenge; staff needs to spend  
longer hours swapping e-mails and shuttling cross-country. ``The 
issue is it takes a lot of stamina and a lot of willingness to 
communicate through a longer day,'' said Barry Obrand of Russell 
Reynolds Associates Inc., a Silicon Valley recruiting firm. 
</P>
<P>
	Yet similarities could help smooth things.  
</P>
<P>
	Both companies arose in the Internet's dawn, and are infused  
with go-getter mentalities. 
</P>
<P>
	They repeatedly ``morphed'' to survive -- AOL by linking its  
members-only online service to the broader Internet, and Netscape 
by going from just browsers to building corporate software and a 
Web site geared toward businesses. 
</P>
<P>
	AOL already has practice preserving the unique identities of  
acquired companies. 
</P>
<P>
	Despite concerns that users of ICQ, a sophisticated instant  
messaging service AOL bought last June, would flee, membership has 
soared. CompuServe, the competing members-only online service also 
bought by AOL, retains its Columbus, Ohio headquarters and much of 
its staff. 
</P>
<P>
	``We learned some things about respecting the special cultural  
ways of companies involved'' in acquisitions, said AOL spokeswoman 
Kathy Bushkin. 
</P>
<P>
	The lack of worry permeated even Netscape's Mozilla.org unit,  
which develops the famous Navigator browser that faces an 
increasingly difficult challenge from Microsoft.

	Asked if the takeover could quash Netscape's competitive  
essence, Mozilla.org's nail polish-wearing manager Jamie Zawinsky 
seemed nonplussed. 
</P>
<P>
	``There were a lot of people worried about that,'' he said.  
``But it sounds like business as usual.''

<HEADLINE> President Clinton To Visit Slovenia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Clinton will visit the former  
Yugoslav republic of Slovenia in June after attending the annual 
summit of industrialized democracies, meeting this year in Cologne, 
Germany. 
</P>
<P>
	The visit is intended as a salute to Slovenia's successful  
transition from communism to democracy, officials said. Clinton 
also is exploring a possible stop in France before the summit, 
which opens June 19. 
</P>
<P>
	Slovenia hopes to join the NATO alliance, and was disappointed  
by being left on the sidelines when Poland, Hungary and the Czech 
Republic were selected for inclusion. 
</P>
<P>
	A report by the Congressional Research Service this month  
concluded that Slovenia, of all the nine central European countries 
that have applied to join NATO, is the most qualified to become the 
next member. 
</P>
<P>
	Slovenia has a democratic political system and has held fair and  
free elections since winning independence from Yugoslavia in 1991, 
the report said. It has an independent judiciary and a government 
that ``respects the human rights of its citizens'' and has made 
strong progress toward a market economy.

<HEADLINE> Hale-Bopp: A Cosmic Leftover? </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	Comet Hale-Bopp, which blazed across the sky in 1997, may be  
brimming with some of the primordial material from which the sun 
and the planets formed more than 4 billion years ago. 
</P>
<P>
	California Institute of Technology scientists who tuned radio  
telescopes onto the comet's nucleus as it cut across the solar 
system found vents spewing a volatile mixture of gas and dust into 
space. 
</P>
<P>
	The images suggest that 15 percent to 40 percent of Hale-Bopp's  
mass is pristine interstellar material, while the rest has been 
transformed extensively during the comet's passage through space. 
</P>
<P>
	The images are among the finest ever obtained of a comet with  
radio telescopes. 
</P>
<P>
	The findings were published in Thursday's issue of the journal  
Nature. 
</P>
<P>
	Comets are often called dirty snowballs. Most orbit far from the  
sun in the deep freeze beyond Pluto's orbit. That enables them to 
remain virtually unchanged over billions of years. 
</P>
<P>
	``Nothing has changed much out there since that time. Therefore  
it's a way of sampling some of the chemistry, or very close to what 
it was, when the solar system formed,'' said Paul Weisman, a 
scientist at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, Calif., 
who was not involved in the work. 
</P>
<P>
	The CalTech researchers found two icy jets erupting with forms  
of primordial deuterium-hydrogen, the poisonous gas hydrogen 
cyanide and a form of hydrogen called heavy water. The material may 
be rising from deep within the comet, said Geoffrey Blake, a 
CalTech professor of cosmochemistry and planetary sciences. 
</P>
<P>
	Actual proof that comets contain the primordial material of the  
solar system may have to wait until a spacecraft can dig inside 
one. 
</P>
<P>
	A NASA probe that is set for launch in 2003 will try to do that  
for the first time ever in 2006. If it survives the landing, it 
will drill into Comet Temple 1 to sample what's inside.

<HEADLINE> Huskies Resist Common Perception </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PHOENIX (AP) -- Do not try to tell the Connecticut Huskies that  
the upset-laced West Region has become an uncrowded freeway for 
them to cruise into coach Jim Calhoun's long-anticipated first 
appearance in the Final Four. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's incorrect when people say it's going to be an easy two  
games for us to get to the Final Four,'' guard Khalid El-Amin said. 
``You can just ask Carolina, Stanford, teams of that nature -- very 
high seeds that didn't come prepared and ready to play with the 
energy and intensity they needed to have.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Iowa, Connecticut's opponent in Thursday night's regional  
semifinal, has fed off the emotion surrounding the departure of 
coach Tom Davis, who is leaving -- not by his choice -- at the end of 
the season. 
</P>
<P>
	``You pour so much of your energy into practice and your  
workouts and trying to improve yourself because he gave you a shot 
to play big-time basketball,'' Iowa's Kent McCausland said. ``You 
know he's just a great guy and he puts everything into trying to 
make you a better player. For him to put that energy into you, you 
just want to give it back.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The emotion propelled the Hawkeyes to an upset victory over  
Arkansas in the second round. But the players weren't exactly 
brimming with confidence about their chances against the deep, 
talented Huskies, who have lost just twice in 32 games and romped 
to two victories last week in Denver.. 
</P>
<P>
	``They're playing so well right now,'' McCausland said.  
``They're like a well-oiled machine.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Asked if he'd do the hokey-pokey if Iowa wins, the Hawkeyes'  
Jess Settles said, ``You'll see more than that. They're so good, I 
can't even imagine that happening.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Iowa was able to use Davis' trademark pressing defense against  
Arkansas, despite the Razorbacks' quickness. But doing it against 
Connecticut is another matter. 
</P>
<P>
	``We feel that's our strength,'' El-Amin said. ``We like to play  
the up-tempo game, and we love for a team to press us. We think we 
can do a very good job against anybody's press because we have very 
good ball handlers out there at all times.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Nobody has dared press the Huskies much this season.  
</P>
<P>
	``It's amazing. We've played 34 games and I don't think  
anybody's pressed us more than 10 possessions,'' Calhoun said. 
``New Mexico the other night threw on a press for about six 
possessions. We scored four out of six and the other times we got a 
good shot off. 
</P>
<P>
	``We don't get pressed. But assuming Tom plays the way he always  
plays, which I think he will, we'll probably get pressed for 40 
minutes.'' 
</P>
<P>
	El-Amin pulled hamstrings in practice two days ago but should be  
at about 90 percent efficiency, Calhoun said. 
</P>
<P>
	Unfortunately for Iowa, Connecticut All-American forward Richard  
Hamilton is at full strength. Hamilton has scored 49 points in the 
Huskies' NCAA victories over Texas-San Antonio (by 25) and New 
Mexico (by 22). 
</P>
<P>
	Calhoun, who has known Davis since the Iowa coch was at Boston  
College from 1977 to 1982, expects some sort of special defense 
geared to stopping Hamilton. 
</P>
<P>
	``They try to take the star player out of the game,'' Calhoun  
said. ``We feel we have enough complementary players to offset 
that. But that is something we will have to prove tomorrow.'' 
</P>
<P>
	This is the seventh time in the 1990s that Calhoun has brought  
Connecticut to the round of 16, and he's uncomfortably aware of his 
reputation as a coach who couldn't get his team to the Final Four. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've coached over 800-something games in college basketball,''  
he said, ``and I'm asked about four or five games. How fair is it? 
I didn't make the rules. We've won three or four Big East 
championship games against John Thompson, Jim Boeheim -- in Madison 
Square Garden on a Saturday night against St. John's. 
</P>
<P>
	``Those, I thought at the time, were big games. But I've been  
told since that there are bigger ones coming up.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Davis, meanwhile, insists he's not spending much time thinking  
about his final days as coach after 13 seasons at Iowa. He will 
leave the reflection for later. 
</P>
<P>
	``If you're working with 18- and 20-year-old guys, you know the  
excitement of being in the tournament overrides a lot of issues,'' 
Davis said. ``I'm just enjoying it with them.''

<HEADLINE> L.A. Given Chance To Change Image </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- The City of Angels has been handed a golden  
chance to erase a decade of nightmarish images that began with the 
Rodney King beating and persisted through the 1990s. 
</P>
<P>
	If all goes as planned, the delegates and journalists at next  
year's Democratic National Convention will look past the stories 
that have shaped the city's image in recent years: police 
brutality, race riots, drive-by killings, earthquakes and the O.J. 
Simpson murder trial. 
</P>
<P>
	Instead, they will see a bustling city of culture and energy.  
</P>
<P>
	City boosters will point them toward such civic accomplishments  
as the $1 billion Getty museum completed last year. Steel girders 
of a partially completed Disney Concert Hall will be visible on the 
downtown skyline, and a new NFL team will be preparing for its 
first game in the nation's second-largest city. 
</P>
<P>
	``You've got 5,000 delegates and 15,000 media. For any city that  
manages this well, it provides a marvelous platform to present 
their city to a national and international audience,'' said Michael 
Collins, executive vice president of the Los Angeles Convention &AMP; 
Visitors Bureau. 
</P>
<P>
	Like the rest of California, Los Angeles has always held a place  
of ambivalence in the American psyche -- a city of opportunity where 
newcomers can make their wildest dreams come true and a city where 
urban nightmares of poverty, bigotry and violence are fully 
realized. 
</P>
<P>
	But L.A. appears to be on a roll.  
</P>
<P>
	More than $8 billion in big new construction projects have been  
completed or are under way. The list includes trophy buildings, 
such as the Getty, and the Staples Sports Arena. Scheduled for 
completion in October, the $350 million arena will house the Los 
Angeles Lakers, hockey's Los Angeles Kings and, next August, the 
convention. 
</P>
<P>
	The recession prompted by defense cutbacks in the early '90s is  
over. The vacuum left by the decline of the aerospace industry has 
been filled in large measure by growth in the entertainment 
industry, software development and multimedia. Booming 
international trade has created thousands of jobs in the twin ports 
of Los Angeles and Long Beach. 
</P>
<P>
	The last really big earthquake to shake the city came in 1994  
when the Northridge quake killed 75 people and caused $25 billion 
in damage. The last devastating wildfire season in Southern 
California was in 1996. 
</P>
<P>
	And people seem to be doing a better job of getting along.  
Racial tensions exacerbated by the police beating of black motorist 
King, by the riots that followed and by political debates over 
immigration and affirmative action appear to have relaxed. 
</P>
<P>
	``At least L.A. is beginning to shake off its status as a unique  
dystopia. It always fought this utopia-dystopia image. It had to be 
the best place in the world or the worst place in the world,'' said 
Joel Kotkin, a senior fellow at the Pepperdine Institute of Public 
Policy who writes about America's cities. 
</P>
<P>
	The last time the Democratic convention was held in Los Angeles  
was 1960, when the party nominated John F. Kennedy for president. 
</P>
<P>
	Los Angeles will present a new face to the world when Democrats  
arrive next year, Collins said. The consequences are significant. A 
successful renovation of the city's image could mean more 
conventions, more tourists and more new businesses for years to 
come.

<HEADLINE> Designers Prepare Oscar Fashions </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- It will be the moment she's been waiting for  
all her life. The star who wins the Oscar as best actress will 
sweep to the stage swathed in silk or spangles, her hair done up 
just so and her makeup a work of art. 
</P>
<P>
	Millions of eyes will be sizing up her appearance, and by then  
everyone will know who created her spectacular dress. 
</P>
<P>
	``My dear, WHO are you wearing?'' the interviewers will ask as  
she wends her way down the red carpet in the glare of TV lights. 
</P>
<P>
	The star will oblige with the designer's name and maybe do a  
twirl or two to show off the dress. 
</P>
<P>
	And why not? It's the least she can do since the gown is either  
on loan or is a gift from a designer who knows the value of 
publicity and the impact of Oscars night on fashion. 
</P>
<P>
	``Designers will make history if they do something different for  
the Academy Awards,'' said Fred Hayman, a perennial arbiter of 
style for the starry set. 
</P>
<P>
	``Whoever designs Gwyneth Paltrow's gown will become very famous  
that night,'' said Hayman of the actress who is the front-runner in 
the Oscar race. ``The show is almost as much about clothes as it is 
about movies.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ostensibly, the Oscars are about celebrating movies. But the  
faithful who tune in early each year for the pre-show know there's 
another angle, one at least as intriguing as who wins best picture: 
Who's wearing what. 
</P>
<P>
	Phillip Bloch, a stylist who puts together ``total concepts''  
for star appearances, said he has been besieged by designers who 
want the stars to wear their fashions. 
</P>
<P>
	``The red carpet is worth more to them than any runway,'' Bloch  
said. ``They send dresses, handbags, bras. They ask, 'Can you get 
my stuff on anybody?''' 
</P>
<P>
	Valentino, an Italian couture house, sends sketches to stars in  
advance, then tailors the gowns specifically to their needs. An 
off-the-rack Valentino, which costs about $5,000, would never do 
for the Oscar nominees, whose dresses are in the $40,000 range. 
</P>
<P>
	Best actress nominee Emily Watson will be wearing a Valentino  
this year. So will the wives of two producers of ``Saving Private 
Ryan.'' 
</P>
<P>
	So what will other stars be wearing?  
</P>
<P>
	Individual choices are guarded secrets until the last minute,  
but a survey of design watchers suggests that glamour is back in 
style. 
</P>
<P>
	A fashion show staged by the movie academy before the awards was  
a dazzling display of ball gowns with dramatic bustles and trains 
and beaded slip dresses that hugged those all-too-perfect bodies. 
One ensemble featured a bright pink full-length marabou feather 
coat. 
</P>
<P>
	``The gowns are gorgeous this year,'' said Mr. Blackwell, the  
normally acid-tongued purveyor of the worst-dressed list. ``If 
these gowns show up on the stage, I'll be out of business.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Colors were bright, almost garish, from fuchsia to orange to  
cobalt blue and peach. The classic little black dress was nowhere 
to be seen in the academy show coordinated by Hayman. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm tired of black and just wanted to see some brighter  
colors,'' Hayman said. 
</P>
<P>
	The fashion industry will be watching for trends, and so will  
America's women. 
</P>
<P>
	``There are trends that come out of the Academy Awards,'' said  
Elizabeth Reed of Valentino. ``After Minnie Driver wore a burgundy 
dress to last year's awards, everyone was buying burgundy. ... The 
trend in fashion right now is colors, especially pastels. But black 
is never completely out. On certain people it's the right color, 
especially if they have a dark complexion.'' 
</P>
<P>
	For male stars, there are also variations on the classic tuxedo.  
In the academy fashion show, Tommy Hilfiger showed a black leather 
tux with black boots. Shanghai Tang added an Asian touch with black 
velvet frog closures. 
</P>
<P>
	And it's not just dresses that will get attention.  
</P>
<P>
	Kathrine Baumann has designed two purple heart handbags to honor  
the film, ``Saving Private Ryan.'' 
</P>
<P>
	One of the handbags was made for actress Kate Capshaw, wife of  
Steven Spielberg, and is worth $40,000. The other limited edition 
bag, crafted in solid gold with diamonds and a 35-carat amethyst, 
has a price tag of $250,000. This bag will be carried to the Oscars 
by Rita Wilson, wife of nominee Tom Hanks. After the Oscars, the 
purple heart bags will be auctioned off for charity. 
</P>
<P>
	Other celebrity bags -- a $35,000 queen's crown for ``Elizabeth''  
nominee Cate Blanchett and a $30,000 baby grand piano for music 
nominee Carole Bayer Sager -- will be presented to them as gifts. 
</P>
<P>
	Extravagant diamond necklaces and other jewelry will mostly be  
on loan from society jewelers. 
</P>
<P>
	Shoes are of such concern that designer Stuart Weitzman is  
suspending work on all other shoes this week to concentrate on 
creating rhinestone-studded sandals for Lisa Kudrow and glamour 
shoes for nominees Lynn Redgrave and Brenda Blethyn. 
</P>
<P>
	Will the audience ever wear clothes as elegant as these?  
Probably not. ``It's all about dreams,'' Bloch said. ``The greatest 
thing you can accomplish is to have a little kid go to sleep after 
the Oscars and say, 'When I grow up I want to be a glamorous movie 
star like so-and-so.'''

<HEADLINE> NFL Keeps 49ers' DeBartolo in Exile </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PHOENIX (AP) -- Suspended San Francisco 49ers co-owner Eddie  
DeBartolo's disciplinary agreement with the NFL has rendered him 
persona non grata with his own team. 
</P>
<P>
	DeBartolo turned over control of the team to his sister 16  
months ago after he became embroiled in a Louisiana gambling fraud 
scandal. But he continued to visit the team, watched games from his 
owner's box and behind the scenes asserted his influence on key 
management decisions, including the hiring of front office 
personnel. 
</P>
<P>
	That all comes to a stop under terms of newly imposed sanctions  
by the league. 
</P>
<P>
	And the fallout from his legal problems, which led to confusion  
and delays in the team's plans for a new stadium, also hit San 
Francisco when NFL owners decided Wednesday to formally pull the 
2003 Super Bowl from the city. 
</P>
<P>
	Owners had awarded the Super Bowl contingent on San Francisco  
building a new stadium, but with the project going nowhere they 
decided to offer the right to host the game to other cities. San 
Diego and south Florida were among the regions invited to submit 
bids. 
</P>
<P>
	Besides extending his suspension to February 2000 and fining him  
$1 million, DeBartolo, known for his high-paying, back-slapping 
approach with players, can't be around the team or wield influence 
in any official capacity. 
</P>
<P>
	Commissioner Paul Tagliabue announced the league's sanctions  
against DeBartolo on Tuesday during the NFL owners meetings. He 
declined to discuss conditions in the disciplinary agreement other 
than to say DeBartolo faced an additional $4 million fine if he 
violated its terms. 
</P>
<P>
	League sources said Wednesday that other provisions of the deal  
forbid DeBartolo from visiting the press box or the team's locker 
room. While he is free to attend games, he won't be allowed to sit 
in the owner's box. 
</P>
<P>
	Another clause includes a total prohibition on gambling, either  
by him personally or as part of his business dealings. 
</P>
<P>
	DeBartolo retains the right to discuss some aspects of team  
operations with his sister, co-owner Denise DeBartolo York, and her 
husband, John York, now a vice president in the 49ers front office. 
But any such discussions would be strictly advisory and the Yorks 
are free to accept or ignore his advice. 
</P>
<P>
	General manager Bill Walsh, speaking Wednesday during the NFL  
owners meetings in Phoenix, said the league's actions helped 
eliminate long-running confusion over DeBartolo's role with the 
team. 
</P>
<P>
	``I feel relieved that there's clarity on when Eddie can  
return,'' Walsh said. ``Now, that may not occur because he and 
Denise have to reach an agreement. But at least we have a date and 
we can move from there.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Tagliabue said DeBartolo, who pleaded guilty in October to  
failing to report a felony in connection with the gambling fraud 
case, could be reinstated by the league if he satisfies the terms 
of his banishment. 
</P>
<P>
	While DeBartolo has said he hopes to resume active ownership of  
the 49ers, regaining control of the team from his sister won't be 
easy and it won't be cheap. 
</P>
<P>
	``She would be very happy to make a deal but Eddie owes money to  
the corporation and there are his problems with the NFL,'' York 
said. ``Right now, there are no deals on the table and I don't know 
what structure that deal would take.'' 
</P>
<P>
	DeBartolo reportedly owes the family-held Edward J. DeBartolo  
Corp., the nominal owner of the 49ers, more than $50 million. 
</P>
<P>
	His impulsive and extravagant business practices have also  
resulted in clashes with his more fiscally conservative sister, who 
has embraced running and managing the team but also has made clear 
she wants to eventually divorce herself financially from her 
brother. 
</P>
<P>
	``I would never rule out working out a separation agreement.  
That's what Denise would like to have,'' York said. ``It has to be 
acceptable to both parties.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Any such agreement would mean splitting up a financial empire  
worth more than $1 billion, with the 49ers as its single most 
valuable asset. DeBartolo and the Yorks have said they have no 
plans to sell the club, though a half dozen investment groups have 
inquired about the availability of the team. 
</P>
<P>
	Walsh said the ownership tumult involving DeBartolo and his  
sister hasn't significantly impacted team operations. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't see that,'' he said. ``We have a budget. We have  
parameters to work with. Now if they were both in the (team's) 
building at the same time, I'd worry about that. I don't think 
that's going to happen.''

<HEADLINE> US To Assess Safety at Italian Site </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Navy officer heading a U.S. team assessing  
safety improvements for U.S. military training flights in Italy 
says important corrections already have been made. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think the people that know about it and are well involved in  
the issue think that a large number of good corrections have been 
made,'' Adm. Joseph Prueher told a Pentagon news conference 
Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Prueher said his team, including aviation, legal and other  
experts from all branches of the U.S. military, are traveling to 
Italy next week for a firsthand look at changes and improvements 
since a Marine Corps aircraft clipped a ski resort cable last year 
while flying a low-level training mission and sent 20 people to 
their deaths. They are to recommend whether more safety 
improvements are needed. 
</P>
<P>
	The admiral declined to discuss safety improvements already  
made. 
</P>
<P>
	Prueher, a career naval aviator due to retire in May, said his  
team will work closely with Italian defense officials. Team members 
will visit the accident site near Cavalese in the Italian Alps and 
Aviano air base, where the Marine EA-6B Prowler flight originated 
on Feb. 3, 1998. They also will visit Naples, headquarters of 
NATO's Southern Europe command, which is responsible for NATO 
flights from Aviano. 
</P>
<P>
	Prueher's group is to report its results by April 15 to Defense  
Secretary William Cohen and Italian Defense Minister Carlo 
Scognamiglio. If accepted, the recommendations will apply to all 
U.S. military flight operations in Italy. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're supposed to assess the adequacy and determine if any  
additional safety procedures need to be made or need to be taken in 
order to ensure the highest levels of safety,'' Prueher said. His 
Italian counterpart on the team is Air Force Lt. Gen. Leonardo 
Tricarico. 
</P>
<P>
	A court-martial acquitted the pilot of the jet that hit the  
gondola cable, Marine Capt. Richard Ashby, of manslaughter and 
negligent homicide charges last week, although he still faces an 
obstruction of justice charge. The military jury's decision enraged 
the Italian government and relatives of the 20 victims, who are 
demanding that someone be held accountable for the loss of life. 
</P>
<P>
	On Monday the Marines announced that in light of the Ashby  
acquittal, manslaughter and negligent homicide charges against 
Ashby's navigator, Capt. Joseph Schweitzer, would be withdrawn. 
Schweitzer's court-martial on obstruction of justice charges begins 
Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	Prueher said his review of safety procedures would not include  
assessing who should be held accountable for the deaths. He was 
asked whether he anticipated that his findings would be used by 
others in determining accountability. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think it's likely that it would,'' he replied. ``I think we  
are going to be working in open covenants openly arrived at in our 
investigation, and I would expect it to be, you know, in the public 
domain.''

<HEADLINE> Gonzaga Ready for Gators' Pressure </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PHOENIX (AP) -- When it comes to handling the constant pressure  
that Florida will bring in Thursday's NCAA West semifinals, Gonzaga 
has a point. Or, rather, two of them. 
</P>
<P>
	The (``Don't Call Us Cinderella'') Zags have what amounts to a  
two-headed point guard system, with Quintin Hall and Matt 
Santangelo as co-playmakers on the court at the same time. 
</P>
<P>
	It's a system well suited for the incessant pressing defense of  
the Gators. 
</P>
<P>
	``We can handle any press,'' Hall said. ``I don't think it  
really can stop us.'' 
</P>
<P>
	There's no lacking of confidence on the team from the little  
Catholic school in Spokane, Wash., even though Gonzaga never had 
won an NCAA tournament game before its two victories last week in 
Seattle. 
</P>
<P>
	The Bulldogs have bristled at the ``Cinderella'' cliche.  
</P>
<P>
	``We're certainly glad to accept any term they give us because  
we're still playing,'' Gonzaga coach Dan Monson said. ``But 
Cinderella is a term our kids take exception to. Our kids had the 
sense when we came into this tournament that they belonged because 
they believe they can play with anybody when they play well.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Florida coach Billy Donovan acknowledges that Gonzaga is  
equipped to handle the press, but that won't change the style he 
learned as a player and later as an assistant coach under Rick 
Pitino. 
</P>
<P>
	``We've pressed Kentucky this year. We've pressed Arkansas.  
We've pressed Tennessee,'' he said. ``That's who we are. That's 
what we do. We're trying to take people out of what they work on. 
Gonzaga does a great job of running their half-court offense. 
They're a very, very good passing team. 
</P>
<P>
	``But there's more to pressing than just forcing turnovers. Our  
style of play is trying to be disruptive 94 feet over the entire 40 
minutes.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Facing a press is as foreign as a March week in Phoenix for  
Monson's team. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a concern of mine because in our league we've been this  
invincible team that can't be pressed because we have two point 
guards on the floor at the same time,'' he said. ``We haven't been 
challenged with full-court pressure much this year at all. 
</P>
<P>
	``So whether we're good at it or not, we haven't had a lot of  
repetitions at it. That's scary as a coach because we only have 40 
minutes tomorrow to figure it out.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Perhaps of more concern is how Gonzaga will handle Florida's  
size and bulk inside, especially 6-foot-7, 260-pound freshman 
Udonis Haslem, while at the same time defending the Gators' legion 
of 3-point shooters. 
</P>
<P>
	``We just have to throw bodies at him just like we did last week  
(against Stanford),'' Monson said. ``That's probably about as scary 
as anything because he keeps you honest coming off of anybody else 
and helping out because they put four shooters around a guy like 
that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Other than Florida's pressing tendency, the teams are extremely  
similar. 
</P>
<P>
	``Both are superior shooting teams with tremendous skill  
people,'' Monson said. ``Both can step out four guys that shoot 
quality 3s. We are two of the more skilled teams as far as being 
skilled offensively at five positions.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The teams have had opposite experiences over the past few days.  
</P>
<P>
	Gonzaga, the West's No. 10 seed, emerged as one of the darlings  
of the nation's media and basked in the unfamiliar spotlight. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's been an overwhelming week for myself and our kids, one  
that we'll cherish forever,'' Monson said. 
</P>
<P>
	The Gators, meanwhile, came directly to Phoenix from Seattle and  
have quietly spent the past few days practicing and staying low-key 
at a hotel near the airport. 
</P>
<P>
	``We've just been practicing, watching films and resting,'' said  
guard Eddie Shannon, one of just two seniors on the team. ``It's 
been a perfect situation. There need not be any distractions. We 
want to be prepared to play.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Donovan said there is no feeling of envy about all the attention  
Gonzaga has received. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're just focusing on trying to win more than anything else,  
instead of talking about, `Why aren't we getting more exposure? Why 
aren't people talking more about us?''' he said. ``I think people 
will talk a lot more about us if we reach the Elite Eight or the 
Final Four.''

<HEADLINE> Dollar Down Vs. Most Top Currencies </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- The dollar rose against the yen Wednesday,  
lifted by comments from Japanese officials, but fell against the 
euro and other major currencies. 
</P>
<P>
	In late New York trading, the euro was quoted at $1.1007, up  
from $1.0985 on Tuesday. The dollar was quoted at 118.01 Japanese 
yen, up from 117.79 yen. 
</P>
<P>
	The dollar rose during Asian trading as Japanese officials  
warned against letting the yen strengthen too much. After the 
dollar fell to its low of the session, the chief of the Finance 
Ministry's international bureau, Haruhiko Kuroda, told reporters 
Wednesday that the yen's rise was ``a little excessive.'' 
</P>
<P>
	There were also rumors that Eisuke Sakakibara, the influential  
vice finance minister for international affairs, told Japanese 
trust banks and institutional investors Tuesday evening they should 
buy dollars and invest in foreign bonds. 
</P>
<P>
	The rise of the euro and other European currencies against the  
dollar came as traders saw potentially good signs in Europe's 
economic situation. Last week, German unemployment figures 
suggested that the country's joblessness could be easing. 
</P>
<P>
	``That could lead to stronger growth coming out of Europe,''  
said Jay Bryson, an international economist at First Union Capital 
Markets in Charlotte, N.C. 
</P>
<P>
	The dollar also was quoted at 1.4509 Swiss francs, down from  
1.4539, and 1.5215 Canadian dollars, down from 1.5278. The British 
pound rose to $1.6305 from $1.6284. 
</P>
<P>
	Currencies of the countries participating in the euro no longer  
are traded separately and are tied to the euro by a fixed rate. 
Based on Wednesday's euro rate, the dollar was worth: 1.7768 German 
marks, down from 1.7803; 5.9595 French francs, down from 5.9701; 
and 1,760.56 Italian lire, down from 1763.67.

<HEADLINE> Kaiser Members Sue HMO Over Ads </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SAN FRANCISCO (AP) -- Members of one of the nation's largest HMOs  
have sued the organization, claiming they were duped by ads that 
said its doctors weren't influenced by financial concerns. 
</P>
<P>
	The lawsuit contends Kaiser Permanente and its parent, The  
Permanente Federation, compromised care with their policies. 
</P>
<P>
	``Kaiser has gone beyond the pale with its statements here that  
doctors make decisions based on medical need and there's no fiscal 
interference,'' said Jamie Court of the nonprofit Foundation for 
Taxpayer and Consumer Rights, which filed the proposed class-action 
lawsuit in Superior Court on Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	The lawsuit contends that Kaiser withheld up to 30 percent of  
doctors' salaries and tied physician bonus pay and other 
compensation to reaching certain profit goals. 
</P>
<P>
	Kaiser called the allegations ``patently false.''  
</P>
<P>
	``The whole premise upon which the lawsuit is based is a lie,''  
said Dr. Sharon Levine, associate executive director of Permanente 
Medical Group for Northern California. 
</P>
<P>
	Levine called the allegations of pay being contingent upon  
achieving targeted profit goals ``absolutely baloney.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Medical decisions at Kaiser Permanente do rest in the hands of  
doctors and we're very proud of that fact,'' she said. ``No health 
plan administrator has anything to do with those decisions.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The lawsuit seeks unspecified monetary damages for up to 800,000  
members of Oakland-based Kaiser, which has nearly 5.6 million 
members in California and over 9 million members nationwide.

<HEADLINE> Basket Maker Dies of Cancer </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEWARK, Ohio (AP) -- David Longaberger, who turned handmade woven  
baskets into a $700 million-a-year company that bears his name, 
died Wednesday of cancer. He was 64. 
</P>
<P>
	Longaberger, diagnosed with kidney cancer in June 1997, died at  
his central Ohio farm. 
</P>
<P>
	He was chairman of The Longaberger Co., which he founded in 1973  
with five weavers. Today the company employs more than 7,000 people 
and 47,000 independent sales associates who sold 8.3 million 
baskets in 1998. 
</P>
<P>
	Longaberger's father owned a basket company and taught all of  
his 12 children to make the baskets. But business waned as 
cardboard and paper sacks began to replace baskets and the business 
closed in 1955. 
</P>
<P>
	The baskets are prized by collectors and sold exclusively  
through home shows.

<HEADLINE> Terrapins, Red Storm Go High-Octane </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	KNOXVILLE, Tenn. (AP) -- Tired of the early NCAA tournament games  
in which teams needed a map to find the basket? Turn to the South 
Regional, where Maryland and St. John's are prepared to erase those 
bad memories. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's like looking in a mirror at ourselves because they play  
just like us,'' Maryland point guard Terrell Stokes said. ``It 
should be a great game.'' 
</P>
<P>
	That's because two of the country's highest-scoring teams will  
be featured Thursday night in the first semifinal of the South 
Regional at Thompson-Boling Arena. 
</P>
<P>
	Gary Williams has always preferred to run and speed up the game  
so that it almost looks like a tennis match. His second-seeded 
Maryland Terrapins (28-5) were fifth nationally in scoring, 
averaging 85.2 points a game. 
</P>
<P>
	No. 3 seed St. John's (27-8) also likes an up-and-down pace.  
Coach Mike Jarvis has five starters scoring in double figures with 
the Red Storm averaging 79.3 points. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's going to be a very interesting game,'' Jarvis said.  
</P>
<P>
	Williams, one victory short of 400 for his career, said he hopes  
both teams play at the level that got them to the round of 16. But 
he won't be picky as he tries to take Maryland to its first Final 
Four after reaching the semifinals for the fourth time in the past 
six years. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'll take an ugly game ... if we win,'' he said.  
</P>
<P>
	The Terrapins are used to being quicker than most opponents, an  
advantage they won't have against St. John's. Williams said 
preparation will be the key, but that doesn't mean major changes 
for Maryland. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're going to go out and play Maryland basketball,'' Stokes  
said. ``That's what got us 28 wins, so I don't think we should 
change anything at this point of the season.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Maryland basketball this season has meant defense as much as  
balanced offense. The Terrapins already have a school-record 423 
steals from pressing up and down the court. 
</P>
<P>
	While the Terrapins have stuck to their pressure defense even  
with the loss of center Obinna Ekezie, the Red Storm has shown some 
versatility in the tournament. 
</P>
<P>
	St. John's, making its first appearance in the round of 16 since  
1991, switched from its preferred man-to-man defense to a zone 
against Indiana, despite the players' reservations. The result was 
an 86-61 victory, the worst tournament loss in Indiana's history. 
</P>
<P>
	``For a 40-minute period, it was probably as well as we've  
played,'' Jarvis said. 
</P>
<P>
	He said his Red Storm will need to play with the same kind of  
discipline as against Indiana to keep up with Maryland and contain 
Steve Francis (17.2 points). That doesn't mean playing tentatively. 
</P>
<P>
	``At this stage of the game, unless you're Duke, you better play  
attack and you better play disciplined; otherwise, you're going 
home,'' Jarvis said. 
</P>
<P>
	A quick start will be the key. Maryland is 27-0 when leading at  
halftime and has lost only once in its last 37 games with such an 
advantage. 
</P>
<P>
	Jarvis, who never reached a regional semifinal while at George  
Washington, has been telling his team to enjoy the fact that they 
are still playing basketball. For the Terrapins, just playing isn't 
enough anymore as they try to reach their first regional final 
since 1975. 
</P>
<P>
	``We feel this is our opportunity to go out and do well and win  
and be remembered in Maryland as the team that got us there,'' 
senior Laron Profit said.

<HEADLINE> Court: Immigrants Can Vote in Union </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SAN FRANCISCO (AP) -- Illegal immigrants working for a company  
can vote in union elections, despite a law prohibiting their 
hiring, a federal appeals court ruled Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	In a 3-0 decision, the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals upheld  
the National Labor Relations Board's conclusion that all regular 
employees -- including those who may be subject to termination in 
the future -- are eligible to vote on whether they want to be 
represented by a union. 
</P>
<P>
	A contrary ruling would allow employers to manipulate elections  
by deciding who could vote and by using threats of deportation to 
discourage union support, the court said. 
</P>
<P>
	Also, companies that had violated the law by employing illegal  
immigrants could take advantage of their own wrongdoing by 
nullifying otherwise valid union elections. 
</P>
<P>
	The court upheld an NLRB order requiring a 50-employee sauna and  
furniture manufacturer in Redwood City to recognize and negotiate 
with a Carpenters Union local that won a 1996 representation 
election. 
</P>
<P>
	A lawyer for the company said it would probably appeal.  
</P>
<P>
	``What's an employer supposed to do?'' asked Mark Thierman,  
attorney for Kolkka Tables and Finnish-American Saunas. ``We just 
want to follow the law. We have two agencies (the NLRB and the 
Immigration and Naturalization Service) telling us different 
things.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But Katie Quan, a former garment workers union leader now with  
the Center for Labor Research and Education at the University of 
California, Berkeley, said such rulings are needed to counter ``the 
many different tactics that employers use to block immigrant 
workers from joining unions.''

<HEADLINE> Michigan Students Hold Sit-In </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ANN ARBOR, Mich. (AP) -- University of Michigan students staged a  
sit-in outside the school president's office Wednesday, demanding a 
meeting to discuss working conditions at factories that make 
university-licensed apparel. 
</P>
<P>
	Members of Students Organizing for Labor and Economic Equality  
say they want to make sure the factories aren't operating under 
sweatshop conditions. 
</P>
<P>
	President Lee Bollinger was not in his office Wednesday.  
</P>
<P>
	About 30 students carrying sleeping bags and food supplies  
entered the university's administration building about 9:45 a.m. 
Protesters chanted and carried signs, but did not interfere with 
normal operations and were allowed to stay. 
</P>
<P>
	Students planned to spend the night in the building and resume  
their protest in the morning. The protest follows similar 
demonstrations at other campuses across the country. 
</P>

<HEADLINE> Blue Jays Fire Manager Johnson </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DUNEDIN, Fla. (AP) -- Tim Johnson, whose managerial career was  
derailed by lies about his military service in Vietnam, was fired 
by the Blue Jays and replaced by Jim Fregosi today. 
</P>
<P>
	General manager Gord Ash, who hired Johnson before last season,  
said the military service controversy had become a distraction in 
preparation for the season. The Blue Jays were 3-12 in exhibition 
games. 
</P>
<P>
	Fregosi, who signed to a two-year deal, was in the Blue Jays'  
camp today. He had been with the San Francisco Giants as a special 
assistant to the general manager. 
</P>
<P>
	``I have always wanted to manage,'' he said. ``I missed the  
action, I missed the field.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Firing a manager in spring training is rare, but not  
unprecedented. Phil Cavaretta was fired by the Chicago Cubs in 
March 1954. 
</P>
<P>
	``We've got 18 games,'' Fregosi said. ``We'll be ready by  
opening day.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Johnson was unavailable for comment. He left Florida and was  
driving to see family members in Kansas. 
</P>
<P>
	Blue Jays players found out about the managing change when they  
arrived for workouts this morning. 
</P>
<P>
	``When did that happen?'' pitcher David Wells asked. ``I don't  
know what to say. Jim's a good guy.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Fregosi was in uniform for today's exhibition game against the  
Phillies in Clearwater. 
</P>
<P>
	Fregosi, with an 861-937 record with three teams, managed  
Philadelphia from 1991-96. He guided the Phillies to the World 
Series in 1993, when they lost to the Blue Jays, managed by Cito 
Gaston. 
</P>
<P>
	Fregosi, who becomes Toronto's seventh manager, began his  
managerial career with the California Angels (1978-1981) and led 
them to the playoffs against Baltimore in 1979. He then moved on to 
the Chicago White Sox (1987-1988) and the Phillies. 
</P>
<P>
	Ash said the move to change managers began last week when he met  
with the Toronto's owners and ``expressed some concern about our 
ability to move forward.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``They gave me the opportunity to examine some possibilities,''  
Ash said, and he asked the Giants for permission to talk with 
Fregosi. 
</P>
<P>
	``We talked to him a year ago (when the team was looking for a  
replacement for Gaston). As a result of that conversation, and that 
he was available, we came to the conclusion over the weekend on the 
deal.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ash said he didn't make the switch during the winter because he  
felt Johnson deserved ``the chance to have the opportunity to come 
to spring training and see if it could work.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But, according to Ash, Johnson's lies about being in combat in  
Vietnam ``wasn't going to fade into the background as quickly as I 
hoped. It became a distraction.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ash said the Blue Jays' exhibition record wasn't a factor.  
</P>
<P>
	``It didn't help but I can't say it was a component of the  
dismissal,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Ash said Johnson, fired at 1 a.m. after Toronto's 2-1 exhibition  
loss to the Yankees in Tampa had been asked to take a leave of 
absence. 
</P>
<P>
	Johnson was about to start his second year managing the American  
League team. The former U.S. Marine was Ash's hand-picked choice, 
bypassing more experienced managers such as Fregosi and Davey 
Johnson in replacing Gaston. 
</P>
<P>
	The Jays stumbled at the start, then finished strongly. But Tim  
Johnson was enveloped in controversy when it was revealed his war 
stories about Vietnam were false. A conflict with pitching coach 
Mel Queen also ensued. 
</P>
<P>
	Johnson taught mortar training to recruits going to Vietnam, but  
never served there. He made a public apology, met individually with 
reporters to discuss his problem and said he was seeking 
counseling. 
</P>
<P>
	But the issue never went away and Johnson was dogged with  
questions wherever he went. 
</P>
<P>
	``Jim Fregosi has a passion to manage with the experience,  
know-how, savvy and communications skills to make it work,'' Ash 
said. ``Jim will meet the coaching staff today, however no other 
changes are expected at this time.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Fregosi said he was looking forward to managing again.  
</P>
<P>
	``I'm excited about taking over the club,'' he said. ``(There's)  
a lot of ability here. I don't think I've been brought over in a 
youth movement. I've been brought in to win games.''

	Reno Opposes Counsel Law Extension  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Attorney General Janet Reno told a Senate  
committee today that politicization of her decisions on some cases 
prompted her to drop her earlier support for the independent 
counsel law. The Justice Department recently reversed course to 
oppose another five-year extension of the law. Reno has been under 
fire from Republicans in Congress for failure to recommend an 
independent counsel investigation of fund raising by the 1996 
Clinton re-election campaign.

	BOURBONNAIS, Ill. (AP) -- Federal investigators said today they  
are determining whether the driver of a semitrailer drove around a 
crossing barrier in an attempt to beat an oncoming train, causing 
the nation's deadliest railroad accident in three years. At least 
11 people were killed and more than 100 injured in Monday night's 
accident, federal officials said today, lowering the death toll 
from 13. National Transportation Safety Board member John Goglia 
said the agency was frustrated with Amtrak's delays in getting 
accurate information about passengers to investigators.

Olympic Committee were expelled today for taking cash, travel, 
medical care and other gifts from bidders who tried to win votes to 
bring the 2000 Winter Games to Salt Lake City. The expulsions came 
on the heels of a resounding vote of confidence for IOC president 
Juan Antonio Samaranch. They also marked a watershed in the worst 
scandal in Olympic history and, officials hoped, the beginning of a 
reform process to regain the luster of the five rings.

	NCAA Investigating UNLV Assistant

	LAS VEGAS (AP) -- The NCAA is probing whether an assistant UNLV

former player Tyron Nesby. Mike Viellion, who once served as a 
student manager for the basketball team, said associate head coach 
Glynn Cyprien gave him money to make car payments on behalf of 
Nesby. Viellion said he was told to take the money to a car-leasing 
agency and make payments for Nesby, who is now an NBA rookie 
playing for the Los Angeles Clippers. A university is forbidden 
under NCAA rules from providing a benefit for a student-athlete 
that it would not provide for every other student.

<HEADLINE> House Debates Steel Quota Bill </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Supporters of limiting steel imports  
criticized the Clinton administration's trade policies today as the 
House opened debate on a steel quota bill. 
</P>
<P>
	The United Steelworkers of America has made quotas a top  
priority in the effort to lift a U.S. steel industry struggling 
against a flood of low-priced imports from Japan, Russia and other 
ailing countries. 
</P>
<P>
	Rep. Dennis Kucinich, D-Ohio, said the administration could have  
avoided the bill, which it opposes, by taking stronger steps to 
curb shipments of foreign steel. 
</P>
<P>
	He noted the administration has been willing to battle the  
European Union over European import rules that the United States 
contends favor bananas from the Caribbean and Africa at the expense 
of Latin American bananas marketed by U.S. companies. The United 
States has threatened punitive tariffs on millions of dollars worth 
of European imports. 
</P>
<P>
	``Bananas did not build America,'' Kucinich said. ``Steel did.  
... The administration cares more about bananas than about steel. 
Such a trade policy is, in a word, bananas.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The bill came to the floor over the objections of GOP leaders  
and the Clinton administration, which has threatened a veto. 
Although the measure was likely to draw considerable support from 
Republicans with large steel constituencies and pass the House, it 
faces a steep hurdle in the Senate. 
</P>
<P>
	Imports reached record highs last year as the Asian economic  
crisis reduced demand for steel abroad and forced foreign producers 
to turn to the United States to unload their goods. The domestic 
industry contends the import surge has resulted in thousands of 
U.S. layoffs and three company bankruptcies. 
</P>
<P>
	President Clinton has faced difficult choices about how exactly  
to respond to the import surge. While labor is an important 
Democratic constituency, the administration fears that trade 
restrictions would encourage other countries to close off their 
markets to U.S. exports and could stall the economic recovery of 
those countries. 
</P>
<P>
	The steel bill would establish quotas that would essentially  
reduce shipments of foreign steel by 25 percent. Imports are 
already heading down, but the industry fears the turnaround is only 
temporary. 
</P>
<P>
	Top Republicans, who agreed to consider the bill only after a  
threat of procedural disruptions by its supporters, urged the 
measure's defeat, calling it a violation of international trade 
agreements and bad economic policy. 
</P>
<P>
	``The fact is, 40 times more American workers are employed in  
the U.S. industries that use steel than in industries that actually 
make steel,'' said Rep. David Dreier, R-Calif. ``When we use 
protectionism to protect one industry, 40 times the workers are 
injured.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Critics also say the quotas could hurt some manufacturers by  
cutting off the supply of specialized products available only 
through imports. 
</P>
<P>
	The U.S. industry recently won preliminary rulings on its  
complaints that Japan, Russia and Brazil illegally dumped 
hot-rolled carbon steel in the U.S. market at prices dramatically 
below production costs. Japan and Brazil face steel tariffs, 
although Russia has agreed to reduce its imports to avoid tariffs. 
</P>
<P>
	GOP presidential candidate Pat Buchanan circulated a letter  
Tuesday urging Republicans to support the bill to ``regain the 
loyalty of working Americans.'' The steelworkers union dispatched 
about 200 rank-and-file workers today for last-minute lobbying on 
Capitol Hill.

<HEADLINE> Al Gore Paints Colorful Past </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Al Gore: small businessman, farmer,  
homebuilder, clearer of land and driver of mules. 
</P>
<P>
	Despite his upbringing as the son of a senator, student at  
exclusive St. Albans school and graduate of Harvard, the vice 
president presented his past to Iowans this week as all sweat and 
no refinement. 
</P>
<P>
	The Washington-born Gore spent youthful summers on a farm, owns  
one now and once dabbled in real estate. Nevertheless, questions 
have been raised about how he has portrayed his achievements ever 
since he opened his first presidential campaign, in 1988, using 
borrowed cows as a backdrop on announcement day. 
</P>
<P>
	To Gore's defenders, the occasional embellishment or misstep is  
inconsequential in the context of such a long career under constant 
scrutiny. To critics, he has shown a vain streak likely to become 
increasingly exposed in the emerging campaign. 
</P>
<P>
	Either way, his recent downhome adornments to a life dominated  
by politics have followed repeated digs by rival Bill Bradley. The 
former New Jersey senator claims to have had more varied career 
experiences than a vice president who ``spent most of his life in 
Washington.'' Bradley spent 17 years in Congress, about a year more 
than Gore. 
</P>
<P>
	Opening his Iowa campaign, Gore spoke about how he was once a  
small-business person and a homebuilder. ``I lived on a farm,'' he 
went on, and learned how to plow a ``steep hillside'' with mules, 
clear land with an ax, hose out the hog waste and ``take up hay all 
day long in the hot sun.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Gore's spokesman, Chris Lehane, said the vice president still  
owns his farm in Carthage, Tenn. -- the land now is leased -- and 
spent some time in the early 1970s in a real estate project as well 
as youthful summers as a family farm hand. 
</P>
<P>
	``These are all part of his life experience,'' Lehane said  
Wednesday, and when Gore goes around the country, ``he looks for 
the opportunity to share those life experiences.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Republicans were quick to make hay of their own.  
</P>
<P>
	Jim Nicholson, chairman of the Republican National Committee,  
addressed Gore in a statement, saying that when it comes to hog 
waste, ``you're shoveling a lot more of it right now than you ever 
did back then.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Gore's hardly alone in stressing a common-touch background.  
</P>
<P>
	Among Republicans, Lamar Alexander has opened this campaign  
without the trademark red plaid shirt that was meant to symbolize 
his own homespun qualities in 1996. The former Tennessee governor 
and federal cabinet secretary now says the shirt distracted from 
his message. 
</P>
<P>
	Elizabeth Dole declares ``I'm not a politician'' as she prepares  
for a likely bid at the highest level of politics. 
</P>
<P>
	Questions about Gore's past have surfaced ever the 1988  
presidential campaign, which he began outside a county courthouse 
before inviting reporters to his Tennessee farm, where the cows 
were supplied from his father's land. 
</P>
<P>
	Before that, Gore had claimed that he ``got a bunch of people  
indicted and sent to jail'' as a crusading newspaper reporter. 
Actually, his reporting contributed to bribery indictments but no 
one ended up in prison. 
</P>
<P>
	Over a year ago, Gore claimed he and his wife were models for  
the romantic novel ``Love Story,'' leaving the author of that book 
``befuddled.'' And last week, Gore suggested he had created the 
Internet. 
</P>
<P>
	``Earnest boastfulness does not play well,'' said William  
Kristol, editor of the conservative Weekly Standard magazine. As 
former chief of staff for Vice President Dan Quayle, Kristol knows 
how a public figure's blunders can blow up. 
</P>
<P>
	``Certain gaffes hurt when they fit into a stereotype,'' he  
said. ``I think Gore's comment taking credit for the Internet is an 
example of that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Andrei Cherny, senior speechwriter for Gore in 1997 and 1998,  
disputes that view. He also contends Gore, whose stiffness is the 
stuff of self-parody, will not become even more so out of fear of 
saying something silly.

<HEADLINE> IOC Expels 6 Members in Scandal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LAUSANNE, Switzerland (AP) -- The International Olympic Committee  
expelled six members today for taking hundreds of thousands of 
dollars in graft from officials who brought the 2002 Winter Games 
to Salt Lake City. 
</P>
<P>
	The expulsions, on a secret ballot by 90 eligible voters,  
followed an overwhelming vote of confidence for Juan Antonio 
Samaranch, the IOC's embattled president. 
</P>
<P>
	While the highest-ranking member implicated in the scandal  
remained saddled only with a warning, three Africans, two South 
Americans and a weightlifter from the South Pacific became what 
were believed to be the first IOC delegates kicked out for 
corruption in the panel's 105 years. 
</P>
<P>
	Agustin Arroyo of Ecuador, Zein El Abdin Ahmed Abdel Gadir of  
Sudan, Jean-Claude Ganga of the Congo Republic, Lamine Keita of 
Mali, Sergio Santander of Chile and Paul Wallwork of Samoa were 
voted out in a secret ballot by their peers. 
</P>
<P>
	The vote counts were 72-16 against Arroyo, 86-4 against Gadir,  
88-2 against Ganga, 72-16 against Keita, 76-12 against Santander 
and 67-19 against Wallwork. 
</P>
<P>
	Their expulsions, upholding the actions of IOC leadership in  
late January, marked a watershed in the worst scandal in Olympic 
history and, officials hoped, the start of a reform process to 
regain the luster of the five rings. 
</P>
<P>
	Corporate sponsors, sports officials and even leaders of the  
U.S. Congress have pressured the IOC to make major changes in the 
wake of the $1.2 million scandal, in which Salt Lake bidders gave 
cash, travel, medical care and other lavish gifts to try to win 
votes. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're starting to deliver what we said since the beginning of  
the crisis -- that we're going to put our own house in order,'' said 
Dick Pound, a vice president and head of the IOC's internal 
investigation. 
</P>
<P>
	There was no immediate comment from any of the ousted members.  
All have professed innocence but all faced daunting evidence of 
wrongdoing. 
</P>
<P>
	At least 30 votes were needed to avoid expulsion, with delegates  
simply writing ``yes'' on a blank piece of paper to oust their 
colleagues or ``no'' to let them stay. 
</P>
<P>
	Other investigations, including one by the Justice Department,  
remain open, and one IOC member is still being looked at by the 
Pound commission. Executive board member Kim Un-yong got off with a 
severe warning, but Pound said he could be expelled if evidence 
surfaces that he knew about a job for his son that was bankrolled 
by Salt Lake. 
</P>
<P>
	Utah investigators, whose work laid the foundation for the  
expulsions, said Arroyo's family received almost $21,000 in cash 
and benefits from Salt Lake bidders. Gadir's son, Zuhair, received 
$17,000 from Salt Lake while a student at Southern Mississippi, 
investigators found. 
</P>
<P>
	Ganga, who led the African boycott of the 1976 Olympics in  
Montreal, and his family, received $270,000 in cash, medical and 
travel expenses and lavish gifts, according to investigators. 
</P>
<P>
	The inquiry found that Keita ``knowingly permitted'' organizers  
to make payments totaling more than $97,000 to support his son at 
the University of Utah. They said Santander received a $10,000 
political campaign donation from Salt Lake bid chief Tom Welch and 
Wallwork's wife, the investigation found, received a $30,000 loan 
from Welch while his family got more than $67,000 in travel 
benefits. 
</P>
<P>
	Each of the six used at least his allotted 20 minutes in  
defense. The presentations were described as dignified, with no 
shouting or finger-pointing. 
</P>
<P>
	Ganga, who said earlier in the week that the investigation was a  
``plot against the Third World,'' brought documents, including a 
copy of credit card bills, which he passed to Samaranch. 
</P>
<P>
	Samaranch said in a speech to the emergency general assembly  
that the IOC ``is now on trial'' and must take quick, firm action 
to avoid ``very, very serious'' damage. 
</P>
<P>
	Samaranch's speech, which received two rousing ovations from the  
delegates, was followed by an overwhelming vote of confidence for 
the 78-year-old Spaniard who has led the Olympics from the doom of 
boycotts to the height of the sports world -- but also the pain of 
its worst scandal. 
</P>
<P>
	The secret ballot in the closed-door meeting was 86-2, with one  
blank ballot and another not returned. 
</P>
<P>
	``He is happy,'' executive board member Jacques Rogge of Belgium  
said. ``What gives him so much strength is that he won so 
overwhelmingly.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Samaranch said the session, called just to vote on expulsions  
and the start of a reform process, was ``the most important'' in 
IOC history. 
</P>
<P>
	``Our main goal is to take the necessary steps to be absolutely  
certain that this very sad episode never happens again,'' he told 
reporters before the session started. ``Throughout the remaining 
time of my presidency, I intend to make this our highest 
priority.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Samaranch went further in his speech, saying he accepted  
responsibility for the development of a ``crisis of this 
magnitude'' and that the IOC should shoulder the blame ``even if 
some of the conduct by bidding cities has itself been unethical.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``It is the IOC that is being judged, and the IOC that must deal  
with the situation,'' he said. ``Bidding cities which may have 
acted improperly are a matter of the past; it is our IOC which is 
now on trial.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Samaranch ran down his accomplishments during 18 years as  
president, and a list of reforms that were launched, including 
public release of financial records, changes in selecting Olympic 
cities and establishing an independent reform commission to make 
recommendations in time for another special assembly late this 
year. 
</P>
<P>
	The era of the clubby IOC was over, Samaranch declared. It was  
time to open the doors and let people see that the leaders of the 
games could operate as fairly and honestly as the athletes are 
supposed to. 
</P>
<P>
	But, while he said he wanted to lead the IOC through these  
changes, Samaranch gave perhaps his clearest signal yet that he 
might not finish his term, scheduled to conclude late in 2001. 
</P>
<P>
	``I have personally given the best of myself to the Olympic  
movement over the last 18 years and ... my last service to Olympism 
would be to restructure our organization in order to enter the new 
millennium stronger than ever,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Besides sponsors, the IOC is under pressure from Olympic sports  
officials and even Congress to take action in the scandal. 
</P>
<P>
	Sen. John McCain, the Commerce Committee chairman, wrote this  
week to the senior Olympic official in the United states that ``the 
demand for Congress to act will be irrepressible'' unless the IOC 
adopts major reforms. 
</P>
<P>
	``The participation of U.S. athletes in the Olympic Games  
represents a vested interest by American citizens in reestablishing 
the integrity of the Olympic ideal of fairness and excellence in 
competition,'' McCain wrote to IOC vice president Anita DeFrantz. 
``This expectation of integrity extends beyond the playing fields 
and into all aspects of the Olympic movement.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In the letter, a copy of which was obtained by The Associated  
Press, McCain noted that his committee has scheduled hearings April 
14 on the Olympic scandal; that the IOC has tax-exempt status in 
the United States; and that sponsorships from U.S. corporations 
``represent a substantial majority of IOC revenues.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``In the strongest terms, let me communicate to you my hope that  
the IOC will move quickly to adopt reforms necessary to provide 
transparency and accountability to the IOC organization and 
processes,'' McCain wrote. ``Without such independent action, the 
demand for Congress to act will be irrepressible.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Another Commerce Committee member, Sen. Ted Stevens, has drawn  
up legislation that would strip the IOC of tax-exempt status, limit 
the percentage of fees sponsors can deduct from taxes and reroute 
U.S. TV rights fees through the U.S. Olympic Committee rather than 
sending the billions of dollars directly to the IOC. 
</P>
<P>
	DeFrantz called McCain's letter ``an expression of concern''  
rather than a threat. 
</P>
<P>
	``Sen. McCain understands, especially in the United States, the  
importance of sponsors to Olympic athletes,'' she said. ``I'm 
confident he knows athletes need financial support.''

<HEADLINE> Democrats Try To Cut Starr's Funds </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Democrats who once supported the independent  
counsel law are moving to cut off funding to Kenneth Starr and 
other outside counsels and shift their probes to the Justice 
Department at the end of the year. 
</P>
<P>
	``It is time to bring this to a close, not just in terms of the  
end of the statute, but the end of their jurisdiction,'' Sen. Dick 
Durbin, D-Ill., told the Senate Governmental Affairs Committee 
Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	The Democratic measure would cut off federal funds for Starr's  
investigation and four other independent counsels as of next Dec. 
31. With no Republican sponsors, it has little chance of passing. 
</P>
<P>
	Allowing the law to expire as scheduled on June 30 would allow  
Starr and other special prosecutors to continue their 
investigations to their conclusions. 
</P>
<P>
	According to a draft of their bill, Democrats would cut off  
federal funding of investigations by independent counsels appointed 
before June 30, 1996, which would include Starr. 
</P>
<P>
	Starr still has several areas of unfinished business relating to  
the Clinton investigation, including three trials and three 
different investigations of his office. 
</P>
<P>
	``It is not our intention by ending these appropriations to end  
these investigations,'' Sen. Robert Torricelli, D-N.J., added. 
``They should continue professionally and thoroughly.'' 
</P>
<P>
	President Clinton, battered by Starr's five-year probe, and  
others in his administration who once supported the law have joined 
Republicans in advocating its death. 
</P>
<P>
	Attorney General Janet Reno on Wednesday became the latest  
member of Clinton's camp to advise Congress to let the Justice 
Department handle probes of high-level officials. 
</P>
<P>
	But even though she was arguing a position widely held among  
lawmakers in both parties, Reno hit flak Wednesday from Republican 
senators who believe the Justice Department can't investigate 
members of its own administration with credibility 
</P>
<P>
	'' If you appoint a special counsel, as long as you are the  
appointing authority, isn't there at least a perception of a 
conflict of interest that is harmful to public confidence?'' asked 
Sen. Susan Collins, R-Maine. 
</P>
<P>
	``What I have come face to face with, senator, is that the  
conflict exists in the act now,'' replied Reno, who has been 
accused of protecting Clinton in her decisions whether or not to 
seek outside probes. 
</P>
<P>
	Having seen the statute's structure ``probably closer up that  
anybody in American history,'' Reno told the Senate panel she has 
given up looking for ways to fix the statute -- and the conflict. 
</P>
<P>
	Removing the attorney general from the independent counsel  
process would be unconstitutional, she said, so the Justice 
Department is the right place for such probes. 
</P>
<P>
	``I can't figure out how to avoid a conflict and still have  
constitutional muster,'' she told Collins. Having the Justice 
Department conduct such probes would be an imperfect system, Reno 
allowed. But, she added, ``It can't get any worse, senator.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Several members of the panel took issue with that statement,  
pointing out the ``Saturday Night Massacre'' in which Nixon fired 
special prosecutor Archibald Cox.

<HEADLINE> General Mills Profit Up 8 Percent </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	GOLDEN VALLEY, Minn. (AP) -- General Mills Inc.'s third-quarter  
earnings rose 8 percent with growth in all its major businesses led 
by non-cereal products. 
</P>
<P>
	The results matched analysts' expectations. Steve Sanger,  
chairman and chief executive, said he expects 12 percent growth in 
earnings per share for the fiscal year which ends in late May. 
</P>
<P>
	The maker of Cheerios, Wheaties and Chex cereals, Yoplait yogurt  
and Betty Crocker dessert mixes earned $141.1 million, or 89 cents 
a share, in the three months ended Feb. 28 compared with $131.1 
million, or 81 cents a share, a year ago. 
</P>
<P>
	Sales rose 5 percent to $1.495 billion from $1.424 billion a  
year earlier. 
</P>
<P>
	The company's yogurt lines, Chex Mix snacks, fruit snacks and  
Nature Valley granola bars led volume growth. Big G cereals volume 
grew 1 percent, helped by the introduction of Honey Nut Chex. 
Distribution of the cereal, introduced to 20 percent of the country 
last August, was expanded nationwide March 1, the same day the 
company launched its Sunrise organic cereal nationwide. 
</P>
<P>
	For the first nine months, General Mills earned $429.7 million,  
or $2.73 a share, compared with $330 million, or $2.03 a share, a 
year earlier. 
</P>
<P>
	Revenue rose to $4.645 billion for the latest nine months from  
$4.480 billion a year earlier. 
</P>
<P>
	The 1999 earnings include restructuring charges related to  
streamlining supply chain activities, and the 1998 earnings 
included unusual charges mainly related to improving the cost 
structure of its North American cereal operations. 
</P>
<P>
	In trading on the New York Stock Exchange, General Mills closed  
up 31 1/4 cents a share at $76.75.

<HEADLINE> Dad Sentenced in Car-Pool Accident </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PANAMA CITY, Fla. (AP) -- A father was sentenced Wednesday to 14  
years in prison for the death of his 6-year-old daughter, who flew 
off the back of his pickup truck while sitting in a plastic 
swimming pool. 
</P>
<P>
	``I want to say this is the last thing I ever wanted to  
happen,'' Jeffrey Sakemiller said. ``I didn't foresee it happening. 
I thought it was safe. There's nothing I can do to bring her 
back.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But the girl's mother was unforgiving.  
</P>
<P>
	``I know he loved her, but he should've known better,'' said  
Catriona's mother, Rebecca Miller. ``And as far as I'm concerned he 
can rot in that jail.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Sakemiller said he was just trying to make his daughter happy by  
letting her ride in a plastic pool they had just bought last June 
15, on the way home in the back of his truck. But wind picked up 
the pool -- with Catriona in it -- and flung them off the truck. 
</P>
<P>
	Police said the little girl apparently was not seriously hurt,  
but died when she stood up in the street and got hit by a car. 
</P>
<P>
	Sakemiller's blood-alcohol level was just over the legal limit  
at the time. The father's record showed he had four previous 
drunken driving convictions. 
</P>
<P>
	A jury convicted him last month of drunken driving, vehicular  
homicide, driving with a suspended license and culpable negligence 
in exposing another to injury.

<HEADLINE> Astros' Closer Wagner Adds Slider </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	KISSIMMEE, Fla. (AP) -- Early last season, the Houston Astros  
suggested that closer Billy Wagner develop another pitch to 
compliment his 100 mph fastball. So he started tinkering with a 
slider. 
</P>
<P>
	Wagner was still getting comfortable with the offspeed pitch  
when he went on a barnstorming trip to Japan with other major 
leaguers during the offseason. Eager to improve, Wagner asked 
fellow relievers for advice. 
</P>
<P>
	``Quit throwing the fastball so much,'' Wagner heard from  
closers Trevor Hoffman, Tom Gordon, Dan Plesac, Mike Jackson and 
Ugeth Urbina. 
</P>
<P>
	Wagner got the message. He spent the rest of the winter working  
on the slider, and so far this spring he's been surprising hitters 
with a pitch that starts out looking like the fastball but takes a 
short, sharp break just before reaching the plate. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a nasty pitch,'' catcher Mitch Meluskey said.  
</P>
<P>
	Wagner got two of his six outs Wednesday using the slider in  
Houston's 2-1 loss to the New York Mets. In five appearances 
covering seven innings this spring, Wagner has allowed one earned 
run and eight hits, walked one and struck out nine. 
</P>
<P>
	``As long as he throws (the slider) enough so people know he  
will throw it, then that might be just the tiny little difference 
that keeps them from catching up to his fastball,'' Astros manager 
Larry Dierker said. 
</P>
<P>
	Wagner insists he didn't add the pitch because he thinks hitters  
are catching up to his fastball or that they're looking only for 
the heater. He just wants to be able to keep batters off-balance. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've had just as much success now as I had when I came into  
the league, but I'd just like to go out there with another pitch,'' 
he said. ``I think it makes me more of a pitcher than a thrower 
because now when guys get up there they can no longer say, `OK, 
I've got to get ready for the fastball.' '' 
</P>
<P>
	Relying mostly on the fastball, the left-hander saved 30 games  
last year while striking out 97 in 60 innings. In 1997, he saved 23 
games and struck out 106 in 66 1-3 innings. Houston won the NL 
Central each season he's been the main stopper. 
</P>
<P>
	Wagner said batters shouldn't only expect him to throw his new  
pitch when he's ahead on the count. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm not afraid to throw it 3-2, 0-2 or 1-2 -- it doesn't  
matter,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Meluskey, who has seen Wagner's slider improve in the two months  
since they worked together in Houston before camp, is confident 
enough to call for it at any time. 
</P>
<P>
	``His slider the last couple of times has been outstanding,''  
Meluskey said. ``With his control of his fastball being good, that 
slider is going to be great for him.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The interesting thing about Wagner's expanded repertoire is that  
if he had developed the pitch earlier in his career, he might never 
have become a closer. 
</P>
<P>
	Wagner, the 12th overall pick in the 1993 draft, was a starter  
until coming up to the majors in late 1995. He began 1996 as a 
starter at Triple-A Tucson, but ended the year as the Astros' 
closer. 
</P>
<P>
	Wagner has rapidly emerged as one of the game's best closers and  
now he's being paid like one. 
</P>
<P>
	Last month, the Astros gave him one of the biggest raises in  
baseball history by agreeing to a $10.3 million, three-year 
contract. The deal -- which boosted Wagner's 1999 salary to $2.1 
million after making $280,000 last year -- kept the two sides out of 
arbitration. 
</P>
<P>
	Wagner feels no extra pressure because he's making more money.  
</P>
<P>
	``I can't worry about that,'' he said. ``I've still got to get  
three guys out before they score.''

<HEADLINE> Life Is 'Divine' for Singing Group </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Like many of their peers, Kia, Nikki and Tonia  
like to giggle about typical teen-age stuff -- boys, shopping and 
parties. 
</P>
<P>
	But the trio known as Divine doesn't have time for much kid  
stuff these days. Since they hit it big with their smash single 
``Lately,'' it's been work and more work for the teen group. 
</P>
<P>
	``The only thing we really have time to do,'' said Nikki  
Bratcher, joined by Kia Thornton and Tonia Tash in unison, ``is 
shop, sleep, eat and talk on the phone.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Then they break into laughter.  
</P>
<P>
	``Sometimes we can't go to the movies. We can't really go to  
parties. Never parties,'' said 17-year-old Kia. 
</P>
<P>
	Not that they're complaining, mind you. This month, they join  
teen sensation 'N Sync on a whirlwind tour. 
</P>
<P>
	And they wouldn't trade their overworked status for anything.  
</P>
<P>
	``We feel like the chosen ones,'' said Tonia, 19. ``We are doing  
what millions of teens -- people period -- dream of doing. It's just 
an honor and it's hard work and we're capable. I know one day. ... 
we'll be rewarded.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Indeed, they already have been. These days, they hang out with  
stars like Monica and jaunt to Europe for publicity tours. But just 
a few years ago, the three girls didn't even know each other, and 
were struggling separately to make it in the entertainment 
business. 
</P>
<P>
	``All I did was go to school and sing for my school and sing for  
chorus, work at Wendy's and the Gap,'' said Kia, from Englewood, 
N.J. ``(I was) using a mini-recorder to record a little home demo 
tape and send them out to record companies, trying to get a record 
deal that way.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But the three girls became Divine when they were brought  
together by Gaman Entertainment. 
</P>
<P>
	``They went out scouting for these girls, and through word of  
mouth, they found each of us, and they came out to see us 
individually and decided that we would be the best elements for 
Divine,'' said 18-year-old Nikki, of Newark, N.J. 
</P>
<P>
	That was four years ago. Last year, the teens put out their  
first album, ``Fairy Tales,'' a melodic, soulful collection of 
songs that recalls the girl groups of the '60s. 
</P>
<P>
	``The Divine sound is basically angelic harmonies, not to boast,  
but I mean it really is beautiful harmonies. It's very pretty,'' 
said Tonia, of Brooklyn, N.Y. 
</P>
<P>
	Their latest single is ``One More Try,'' a remake of George  
Michael's hit. 
</P>
<P>
	But the girls co-wrote three of the songs on ``Fairy Tales'' and  
worked with producers Denzel Foster and Thomas McElroy for some of 
the tracks. 
</P>
<P>
	When asked about the difficulties of sudden success, Kia  
replied: ``Traveling a lot and not being able to spend time with 
your family as much or your friends. We miss them but we're not 
able to spend time with them, and when we come home, we have to get 
our sleep, so we are missing out on a lot of our teen-age life.'' 
</P>
<P>
	There is also the constant pressure of trying to re-create the  
success of ``Lately,'' which sold more than 1 million copies. 
</P>
<P>
	``I mean, you don't want to fail,'' said Kia. ``You just wonder,  
is it going to be as successful as 'Lately'?'' 
</P>
<P>
	But they try not to let the worries of the business spoil their  
fun. 
</P>
<P>
	And they credit God for keeping them focused, saying they are  
well-aware that their success may not be forever. 
</P>
<P>
	``This business has humbled us. There's so much going on in this  
business, politically, the rumors of it, the myths of the 
industry,'' said Nikki. ``As long as we pray, things will always be 
right for us, and we realize that what the business is and what we 
don't want to be involved in. So we're very careful about what we 
do, what we say, how we act in public, and how we treat ourselves 
and our families and our friends.''

<HEADLINE> Zale To Buy Canadian Jewelry Chain </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DALLAS (AP) -- Zale Corp. is buying Peoples Jewellers Corp., a  
privately owned chain of 175 jewelry stores in Canada, for about 
$75 million in cash. 
</P>
<P>
	Robert J. DiNicola, chairman and chief executive, said the deal  
announced Tuesday was ``a natural extension of our long-term plan 
to expand'' Zale's operations internationally. 
</P>
<P>
	Clare Copeland, president of Peoples, said Zale's focus on  
investing will ``enhance People's ability to achieve significant 
growth as the Canadian arm of Zale.'' 
</P>

<HEADLINE> IOC Grudgingly Seeks Reforms </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	The International Olympic Committee met today in Lausanne,  
Switzerland, to face down the biggest crisis in its 105-year 
history. The only other time that many people with something to 
hide turn up in the same place is one of those sting operations 
when police send letters to unsuspecting fugitives informing them 
they've won the lottery. 
</P>
<P>
	The difference, of course, is that nobody from the IOC ended the  
day behind bars. Not even close. 
</P>
<P>
	Nearly three dozen IOC officials were implicated in various  
bribery scandals. But so far, only four have quit and six more were 
expelled via the ballot box today. And all they lost was membership 
in the world's most exclusive country club. 
</P>
<P>
	``Our main goal is to take the necessary steps to be absolutely  
certain that this very sad episode never happens again,'' IOC boss 
Juan Antonio Samaranch said. ``Throughout the remaining time of my 
presidency, I intend to make this our highest priority.'' 
</P>
<P>
	If all the IOC accomplishes is canning a half-dozen members with  
little visibility and less power -- while the better-connected 
members get off with warnings -- the two days of meetings will be 
little more than a show trial. Yet say this much for Samaranch -- he 
got through the opening portion of the program with a minimum of 
mess. 
</P>
<P>
	One of the six, Jean-Claude Ganga of the Republic of Congo,  
allegedly devoured so much payola that bid representatives from 
Salt Lake City dubbed him ``the human vacuum cleaner.'' And in 
keeping with his nickname, he promised not to go without plenty of 
noise. 
</P>
<P>
	In the days leading up to the expulsion vote, Ganga noted all  
six of the accused were from Third World countries, then suggested 
the IOC investigating committee was both racist and hypocritical in 
choosing its scapegoats. But in the end, he offered only a muted 
defense of his own conduct and went quietly. 
</P>
<P>
	Not Samaranch. Facing a vote of confidence, Samaranch's opening  
speech to the IOC earned two rousing standing ovations. In a 
closed-door meeting afterward, he received the equivalent of a 
third when delegates voted 86-2 to let him complete a fifth term. 
</P>
<P>
	Until his speech this morning, Samaranch had refused to accept  
any responsibility for the serial bribery that took place on every 
side of him. But his words -- ``it is our IOC which is now on 
trial'' -- hinted that might not be the only change in his attitude. 
While proposing a series of reforms and promising to open the books 
on the IOC's business, the 78-year-old president let slip he might 
step down before his term expires in 2001. 
</P>
<P>
	``I have personally given the best of myself to the Olympic  
movement over the last 18 years and ... my last service to Olympism 
would be to restructure our organization in order to enter the new 
millennium stronger than ever,'' Samaranch said. 
</P>
<P>
	Nothing would cement that promise more than his leavetaking.  
Right now, IOC members voice dissent as often as they ask for 
bargain rates on hotels or airfares. Nearly 80 percent of the 
committee owes their appointments to the imperious Spaniard, and 
his most powerful underlings have so much invested trying to reach 
the front of the line of succession that they may not recognize 
real reform if and when it comes along. 
</P>
<P>
	Canadian Richard Pound and Australian Kevan Gosper, both members  
of the executive board and mentioned as possible heirs, have been 
talking tough about cleaning house -- until talk is aimed at the 
executive suite. Even American IOC member Anita DeFrantz, whose 
insight and candor won her a spot on the short list of candidates 
to succeed Samaranch, has so far carefully toed the party line. 
</P>
<P>
	``I know there are many who feel he should resign,,'' she said.  
``But he doesn't want the scandal to be his legacy to the Olympic 
movement. He wants to oversee cleaning up the mess so he can leave 
office with the knowledge that the people who created the problem 
are no longer involved in the movement.'' 
</P>
<P>
	To effectively achieve that end would require the sort of  
bloodletting that even a ruler as ruthless as Samaranch cannot 
afford. Fully one-third of the IOC already has been tainted to 
varying degrees, and the really serious mudslinging has barely 
begun. 
</P>
<P>
	Kim Un-yong of South Korea, another possible Samaranch heir, was  
not among the six IOC members expelled today. But news reports said 
new evidence against him has been presented to the investigating 
committee. Kim responded by saying he would fight back with ``lots 
of ammunition,'' and if need be, take a few members down with him. 
</P>
<P>
	On Tuesday, it almost seemed he meant that literally. While  
arguing loudly with two high-ranking colleagues on a terrace at IOC 
headquarters, the 67-year-old Kim, president of the international 
Taekwondo association, coiled into a martial-arts pose. 
Fortunately, his fellow debaters scattered before any blows were 
exchanged. 
</P>
<P>
	The way things are shaping up, the IOC will be lucky to complete  
their business without doing the same. 
</P>

<HEADLINE> Judge Demands IDs of Jewell Sources </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ATLANTA (AP) -- A judge has given reporters for The Atlanta  
Journal-Constitution 60 days to reveal their sources for articles 
about Richard Jewell, who was cleared as a suspect in the 1996 
Centennial Olympic Park bombing. 
</P>
<P>
	The reporters, whose stories quoted sources as saying Jewell was  
a suspect in the bombing, were told they will face civil contempt 
charges and possible jail time if they refuse to name the sources. 
</P>
<P>
	The newspaper's attorney, Peter Canfield, said Wednesday that  
the paper made its position clear to the court in past hearings and 
will appeal the order. He said the newspaper refuses to release any 
confidential information. 
</P>
<P>
	``To allow a fishing expedition into the sources of information  
where there isn't any genuine dispute that the information is 
accurate has really put the cart before the horse,'' Canfield said. 
</P>
<P>
	Jewell sued in January 1997, claiming he was libeled in a series  
of articles that portrayed him as an individual with a bizarre 
employment history and an aberrant personality who was likely 
guilty. 
</P>
<P>
	The newspaper reported that Jewell was being investigated in the  
bombing that killed one woman and injured 111 people. 
</P>
<P>
	Judge John Mather said he ordered the newspaper to name sources  
``in the interest of revealing the truth.''

<HEADLINE> Red Sox Releases Hamelin </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	FORT MYERS, Fla. (AP) -- Bob Hamelin, a former American League  
rookie of the year who batted .174 in spring training after being 
signed as a free agent, was released Wednesday by the Boston Red 
Sox. 
</P>
<P>
	Hamelin, a lefty slugger who appeared unlikely to make the team,  
had asked to be released after going 4-for-23. He had one homer, 
two RBIs and six strikeouts in eight games before being let go 
Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	With Reggie Jefferson, another lefty designated hitter, expected  
to miss the beginning of the season with back problems, Brian 
Daubach, a career minor leaguer who can play first base and the 
outfield, moved closer to making the club. 
</P>
<P>
	Hamelin, a first baseman who won the 1994 rookie award when he  
hit 25 homers and batted .282 for Kansas City, moved to Detroit as 
its designated hitter in 1997. He was with Milwaukee last season 
and had four pinch-hit homers in 146 at bats. 
</P>
<P>
	The Red Sox had been seeking add power since Mo Vaughn, who hit  
40 homers last season, signed as a free agent with Anaheim.

<HEADLINE> Pavarotti Gleams in `Tosca' </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Luciano Pavarotti keeps confounding critics who  
think the aging superstar should call it quits. 
</P>
<P>
	On Tuesday night, he was back at the Metropolitan Opera in one  
of his favorite roles -- the painter Mario Cavaradossi in Puccini's 
``Tosca'' -- and his voice gleamed with youthful beauty. 
</P>
<P>
	This was the first of three performances he is giving this month  
to make up for cancellations last November, when he was recovering 
from hip and knee replacement operations. 
</P>
<P>
	Those cancellations, on top of some vocal problems in the  
previous few seasons, had prompted speculation that, at age 63, the 
Italian tenor's singing career might be near an end. 
</P>
<P>
	But you'd never think that to hear him in ``Tosca.'' He sang  
with round, warm tones -- those distinctive tones that identify the 
voice as Pavarotti's. He showed no vocal wobble and did not tire 
vocally during the opera. 
</P>
<P>
	True, he didn't always sing with his former power, but this may  
have been for dramatic effect. When power was called for, as when 
Cavaradossi learns that Napoleon has won a battle and sings 
``Vittoria!'', Pavarotti's voice rang out. 
</P>
<P>
	He used pianissimos to effect. When he sang that Tosca's sweet  
hands were meant to caress children, his voice was a caress. When 
he sang that Tosca gave color to his life, his tone was light and 
ecstatic. He also seemed to enjoy the embraces. 
</P>
<P>
	It's obvious that Pavarotti has lost weight. He moved well and,  
when he was brought before Scarpia, he planted his feet apart in a 
sturdy stance. He used to find opportunities to lean or sit on 
stage. This time, rather than remaining seated at a writing table, 
he stood for part of that scene in the last act. 
</P>
<P>
	There are still precautions: When he was shot, he fell onto  
filled sacks before rolling onto the floor. And, as usual in Act 1, 
Pavarotti works at his painter's easel front and center instead of 
climbing stairs to paint on the back wall. 
</P>
<P>
	Did the return please Pavarotti? He smiled at the final bows,  
seemingly delighted with the evening. 
</P>
<P>
	His next performance, Saturday afternoon, is slated to be  
broadcast nationally live on radio. He is also scheduled to repeat 
the part at the Met next season. 
</P>
<P>
	The rest of the cast provided strong support. Carol Vaness sang  
the title role with the right vocal heft and beauty, as well as the 
dramatic presence for a diva. Though sometimes singing with more 
vibrato than ideal, she made her big aria, ``Vissi d'arte,'' both 
strong and moving. 
</P>
<P>
	James Morris sang Scarpia, chief of the secret police who  
desires Tosca, with evil in his tone. When he sings to her, Morris 
ably added an overlay of charm. He sounded at the top of his form 
and moved with self-satisfaction. 
</P>
<P>
	Richard Bernstein sang with an unusually rich bass-baritone as  
Angelotti, the escaped political prisoner. 
</P>
<P>
	Conductor Nello Santi, long a fixture at the Met in Italian  
repertory, received warm applause from the sold-out house.

<HEADLINE> Flyers' Neilson To Discuss Incident </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PHILADELPHIA (AP) -- Philadelphia Flyers coach Roger Neilson is  
scheduled to have a conference call Thursday with the NHL to 
determine what, if any, disciplinary action will result from his 
stick-throwing incident in St. Louis. 
</P>
<P>
	Neilson, who tossed a stick Tuesday in the direction of referee  
Bill McCreary to protest the lack of a penalty call on which St. 
Louis scored, narrowly missed linesman Lonnie Cameron with the 
stick. 
</P>
<P>
	On Wednesday, Neilson claimed he was not trying to hit Cameron  
but rather get McCreary's attention at the 6:47 mark of the third 
period in a 5-2 loss to the Blues. 
</P>
<P>
	Taking part in the conference call will be NHL senior vice  
president and director of hockey operations Colin Campbell, Flyers 
president and general manager Bob Clarke and McCreary. 
</P>
<P>
	Neilson could face a fine and or suspension. Former Los Angeles  
Kings coach Tom Webster received a 12-game suspension in 1991 for 
throwing a stick at referee Kerry Fraser. 
</P>
<P>
	Neilson, who was ejected from the game by McCreary, reportedly  
spoke to Campbell Wednesday to give his side of the story. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think the referee in his report said I was trying to hit the  
linesman,'' Neilson said. ``Which is completely wrong. He 
(McCreary) wasn't watching anyway. That's one thing that I wanted 
to make sure that Colin Campbell knew. 
</P>
<P>
	``I didn't even see the linesman. It was just a protest,  
throwing the stick out on the ice. If you get suspended for that, 
well OK. But I don't want to get suspended for trying to hit a 
linesman with a stick.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Neilson has been ejected from several games during his coaching  
career but never has been suspended. 
</P>
<P>
	On the disputed play, St. Louis' Terry Yake appeared to hold  
Jody Hull's stick. That gave Chris Pronger a clear path to set up 
Pavol Demitra for the goal that gave the Blues a 3-1 lead.

	JUPITER, Fla. (AP) -- Carlos Baerga, who had been trying to win  
the second-base job with the St. Louis Cardinals, was waived today. 
</P>

	Signed as a free-agent in the off-season, the 30-year-old Baerga  
was just 2-for-15 in six exhibition games. He hit .266 for the New

<HEADLINE> American Hurt by Pilots' Sickout </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DALLAS (AP) -- The sickout last month by the American Airlines  
pilots will cost parent company AMR Corp. more than $200 million in 
pretax earnings during the first quarter. 
</P>
<P>
	American was forced to cancel more than 6,600 flights over a  
10-day period in February because of the disagreement with pilots 
over the acquisition of Reno Air. 
</P>
<P>
	AMR is projecting earnings in the range of 30 to 35 cents a  
share, while Wall Street analysts surveyed by First Call Corp. had 
been projecting 65 cents a share. 
</P>
<P>
	``Unfortunately, a quarter that looked like it would come in  
generally in line with analyst expectations has been dramatically 
impacted by the job action,'' said Gerard J. Arpey, AMR's chief 
financial officer, on Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	The Allied Pilots Association had insisted in negotiations that  
its contract with the airline forces American to pay higher wages 
to the Reno pilots and those American pilots who are due promotions 
when the regional airline was purchased in December. American had 
said it will bring the pilots up to the contract rate as soon as 
each pilot is retrained -- a process that could take a year. 
</P>
<P>
	About 25 percent of the company's pilots called in sick to work  
until U.S. District Judge Joe Kendall of Dallas issued a temporary 
restraining order against the union. Kendall also found the union 
and two of its leaders in contempt of court for not encouraging the 
pilots to return to work immediately after his order. 
</P>
<P>
	The judge ordered the union to post $10 million bond -- and the  
leaders to post a total of $15,000 -- against potential 
contempt-of-court fines. He is scheduled to consider damages on 
April 12. 
</P>
<P>
	The union and company have since agreed to hold bargaining  
sessions and participate in mediated talks if necessary. The 
company declined to comment on any progress on Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	APA leadership has been holding meetings with pilots at their  
largest bases this week. Gregg Overman, a spokesman for the union, 
said he doesn't have the financial information to dispute or 
confirm AMR's damage claims, but APA does take issue with the 
company's ``characterization'' of the sickout. 
</P>
<P>
	``Our position was and is that it was a legal job action,'' said  
Overman. 
</P>
<P>
	Also on Wednesday, AMR announced the company will repurchase up  
to $500 million of its common stock, bringing the total of AMR's 
repurchase program since 1997 to $2.6 billion. 
</P>
<P>
	``While our first quarter financial results will be adversely  
impacted by the recent Allied Pilots Association job action, we 
believe the company is well positioned for long-term success,'' 
said chairman and chief executive Donald Carty.

<HEADLINE> Man Arrested in Teen Slaying </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SHAKER HEIGHTS, Ohio (AP) -- A young man apparently infatuated  
with a 16-year-old girl was charged today with shooting her to 
death on a busy street corner in this upscale Cleveland suburb, 
police and relatives said. 
</P>
<P>
	Scott C. Strothers, 21, was charged with aggravated murder in  
Tuesday's death of Penny Chang, police said. 
</P>
<P>
	Strothers, apparently upset when the girl rebuffed his advances,  
was arrested last fall after allegedly breaking windows at the 
Chang home and putting glue in the gas tank of the family car, said 
the victim's father, Ching-Lung Chang. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't know what happened between them,'' said Chang, an  
associate professor of mathematics at Cleveland State University. 
``The boy was falling in love with my daughter and my daughter 
refused.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Police Chief Walter Ugrinic wouldn't comment on a motive.  
</P>
<P>
	Chang described Strothers as a handsome young man who had  
graduated from Shaker Heights High School in 1996 and went to Ohio 
State University. Chang said his daughter and Strothers had gone to 
movies together, but he didn't know about their relationship in 
detail. 
</P>
<P>
	``She kept it secret,'' he said.  
</P>
<P>
	The victim was walking to Shaker Heights High when she was  
approached by the gunman, who shot her several times at close range 
with a semiautomatic handgun, Ugrinic said. She died at a hospital 
two hours later. 
</P>
<P>
	Two police officers in a nearby coffee shop caught the suspect,  
who was walking away, Ugrinic said. 
</P>
<P>
	Violent crime is rare in Shaker Heights, a leafy suburb of about  
30,000 people.

<HEADLINE> Five questions with Michael W. Smith </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	FRANKLIN, Tenn. (AP) -- Smitty is more amused than annoyed.  
</P>
<P>
	Going into the annual Dove Awards for gospel music (March 24),  
only Toby McKeehan of the trio dc Talk has more nominations than 
Michael W. Smith, known affectionately throughout the Christian 
music industry as Smitty. McKeehan has 11 nominations; Smith has 
10. 
</P>
<P>
	McKeehan and Smith would be tied, but a Gospel Music Association  
committee ruled that Smith's popular ``Love Me Good'' wasn't really 
a gospel song because of its lyrics. 
</P>
<P>
	Smith thinks the problem may be that the song's imagery mixing  
Genghis Khan and ``The Brady Bunch'' was too far-out for some GMA 
conservatives. Perhaps the chorus was taken to be too suggestive: 
``Give me love, give me love, love me good.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Taking a break from songwriting to talk about the Dove Awards  
and the Christian music industry in general, the former keyboard 
player for Amy Grant was surprisingly critical of his own industry. 
</P>
<P>
	Smith, 41, a native of West Virginia, has long yearned to be a  
pop singer who often writes about his faith, rather than a singer 
known only in Christian music. His musical hero is Elton John, and 
artists including Sheryl Crow and The Backstreet Boys have told him 
they are fans. 
</P>
<P>
	Smith has enjoyed some success beyond Christian music, selling  
more than 7 million albums and scoring with adult contemporary hits 
like ``Place in This World'' and ``Cry for Love.'' But he hasn't 
crossed over to the extent of his friend Grant. 
</P>
<P>
	He thinks being content to stay a big fish in the smaller pond  
of Christian music would be a cop-out. 
</P>
<P>
	``I even hate that term `Christian music' a lot, because I've  
never been able to separate the sacred and the secular,'' Smith 
says. 
</P>
<P>
	1. How do you feel about awards shows in general?  
</P>
<P>
	Smith: I like them OK. I don't think I care as much now about  
awards as I used to early in my career. As you grow up, you kind of 
learn what's really important in life. ... There's so much of 
people competing, and we used to have block voting that went on in 
the early days -- which I think has gotten better. Everybody thinks 
the artists are bad; the record companies are brutal. It's sad to 
me that it gets so competitive. I think there's a way to do this in 
love and not stab each other in the back. That's the one thing that 
kind of bothers me about the awards. 
</P>
<P>
	1 1/2. Will you perform on the show?  
</P>
<P>
	Smith: Yeah. They want me to do `Live the Life.' It's four  
minutes and 20 seconds long and they want it three minutes, you 
know? It's impossible. So you try to fight a little bit -- and bend. 
My reasoning is that the song was a big song. Let's don't tamper 
with it too much. I cut a little bit, and I think everybody's 
happy. I didn't cut as much as they wanted me to. 
</P>
<P>
	2. Are awards a conflict for Christian artists, since all glory  
is supposed to go to God? 
</P>
<P>
	Smith: I think with most people there's not a conflict.  
Everybody's got to work out their own salvation, you know? I think 
it's fine to be able to congratulate and encourage people. If these 
awards absolutely consumed me every day, then I think it's not a 
healthy place. For me, from a spiritual point of view, I'm not 
taking any of this stuff with me, so it's an earthly possession. At 
this point in my life, I'm a little embarrassed at having awards on 
my shelf. I've often thought of packing them up in a box. 
</P>
<P>
	3. You've tried hard to cross over like your former employer Amy  
Grant. Why is that so important to you? 
</P>
<P>
	Smith: I love having a pop hit. I love being able to break down  
the barriers and get out of my subculture. There's a lot that I 
really, really dislike about our subculture. I think you get 
tainted and you have no idea what's going on in the real world. I 
make myself. I push myself to get out of it. 
</P>
<P>
	4. Then why do you work from a base in the Christian music  
industry? 
</P>
<P>
	Smith: Really, from a musical standpoint I belonged in L.A. I  
just didn't want to go to California. ... I hesitate to say this, 
but I'll go on record and say it: I'm not really sure it was smart 
to really ever start Christian music. But I think God uses it and I 
think people have been impacted by it. ... We decided, `Oh, we're 
not going to be in that world because that's so evil. We're going 
to start our own thing over here.' And so then we started this 
subculture, and then we all live in this subculture and we just do 
our own thing over here, and we feed Christians and we have our own 
little club. And I absolutely hate it. I don't like it at all. I 
just don't think that's what Jesus would do. 
</P>
<P>
	5. What are you going to do about it?  
</P>
<P>
	Smith: I just think we need to be a little more open-minded. And  
we need to live on the edge a little more. And we need to be 
supportive of people who are going out of the subculture, like when 
Jars of Clay had a big hit with 'Flood.'

<HEADLINE> Pistons' Laettner Makes Debut </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	AUBURN HILLS, Mich. (AP) -- Christian Laettner, out all season  
because of an Achilles injury, made his debut with the Detroit 
Pistons on Wednesday night after being activated from the injured 
list. 
</P>
<P>
	Laettner, acquired by Detroit in a January trade with the  
Atlanta Hawks, ruptured his Achilles tendon during an offseason 
pickup game last September and has been on the injured list all 
season. 
</P>
<P>
	In a 103-101 loss to the visiting Toronto Raptors, Laettner  
scored three points in 19 minutes after missing the first 22 games. 
</P>
<P>
	Laettner, a forward-center, has averaged 16.6 points and 7.9  
rebounds in a six-year career split between Minnesota and Atlanta. 
</P>
<P>
	On Wednesday night, the Pistons activated the former Duke star  
hours before he debuted with Detroit against the Toronto Raptors. 
</P>
<P>
	Laettner replaces rookie Korleone Young -- placed on the injured  
list because of recurring back spasms -- on Detroit's active roster. 
</P>
<P>
	Laettner has practiced with the club for weeks and had been  
waiting to be cleared Wednesday by team physicians before dressing 
for Wednesday night's game, team spokesman Bill Wickett said. 
</P>
<P>
	Detroit obtained Laettner from Atlanta the day the Hawks signed  
him to a three-year, $18 million contract. Atlanta received Scot 
Pollard and a first-round draft pick from Portland in the three-way 
deal. 
</P>
<P>
	The deal reunited Laettner with Grant Hill, his teammate on  
Duke's 1991 and 1992 NCAA national championship squads. In the 1992 
regional final, Duke beat Kentucky 104-103 in overtime on a 
last-second shot by Laettner that was set up by a 
three-quarter-court pass from Hill.

<HEADLINE> Church Upset Over Drag Queen Party </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SAN FRANCISCO (AP) -- Catholic leaders are calling on city  
officials to revoke a permit for an Easter street party thrown by a 
theater troupe of habit-wearing drag queens known as the Sisters of 
Perpetual Indulgence. 
</P>
<P>
	The Sisters have a permit to close a section of a road in the  
largely gay Castro District to celebrate their 20th anniversary. 
</P>
<P>
	Allowing a group that ``mocks the Catholic Church'' to close a  
public street on Easter is comparable to ``allowing a group of 
neo-Nazis to close a city street for a celebration on the Jewish 
feast of Passover,'' said Maurice Healy, a spokesman for San 
Francisco's Roman Catholic Archdiocese. 
</P>
<P>
	He wrote in the archdiocese's official newspaper, Catholic San  
Francisco: ``This group has garnered a reputation for outrageous 
behavior by mocking religious life, ridicule of Catholic 
institutions and profane references to sacred liturgies.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But one of the Sisters, known as MaryMaye Himm, said the party  
is on. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're really appalled at the insensitivity of comparing us to  
neo-Nazis, which totally invalidates the Jewish struggle against 
Nazis,'' Himm said this week. ``The Catholic Church should be 
ashamed for promoting such absurdity. There are no pagan rituals. 
The goal is education and celebration.''

<HEADLINE> Build Boom Means Wallboard Shortage </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHARLESTON, S.C. (AP) -- A year ago, builder Steve Blackburn  
could call his supplier and have wallboard on the construction site 
of an upscale home in 48 hours. Now, with a nationwide building 
boom, a delivery can take a month and cost more too. 
</P>
<P>
	His customers are getting antsy. It's running up their bills and  
keeping them from moving into new homes. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a shock to the homeowner ... it's just another obstacle  
in the building process,'' Blackburn said. 
</P>
<P>
	Wallboard that cost $9 a sheet a year ago now costs about $11.  
While that boosts the price of a home only a few hundred dollars, 
any delay means customers are paying out additional interest in 
building loans. Some are forced to find alternative living 
arrangements while they wait. 
</P>
<P>
	Wallboard, also known as drywall and by the brand name  
Sheetrock, in most cases is dried gypsum plaster sandwiched between 
heavy paper. It long ago replaced plaster-lath on interior walls in 
most construction. 
</P>
<P>
	Drywall factories around the nation have operated at capacity  
for months. Still, they can barely keep up with demand from a 
booming housing market and a mild winter that allowed construction 
to continue in many areas where it otherwise would shut down. 
</P>
<P>
	The government said Monday that construction starts of new  
single-family homes last month rose to their highest level in two 
decades -- a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 1.41 million units. 
</P>
<P>
	The drywall shortage ``doesn't stop the starts, but it slows  
down the completions,'' said Michael Carliner, an economist with 
the National Homebuilders Association. 
</P>
<P>
	``The housing start number is an indication it may get worse  
before it gets better,'' he said. ``There is a lot of new capacity 
in the pipeline but we're not going to see much of it in the next 
six months.'' 
</P>
<P>
	At the nation's largest producer, Chicago-based USG Corp. with  
about a third of the market, plants have operated 23 hours a day 
for the past 15 months, spokeswoman Judy Wohlt said. 
</P>
<P>
	Two more plants are to be operating by year's end, a third next  
year, and two more are being planned, she said. 
</P>
<P>
	``We see the demand for drywall directly related to the strong  
economy and consumer confidence,'' Wohlt said. 
</P>
<P>
	The demand goes beyond housing starts. Sheetrock for remodeling  
existing homes comprises about 40 percent of USG's business, she 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Drywall does not travel well -- it is brittle and cannot get wet  
-- so little is imported, except from Canada, Carliner said. 
</P>
<P>
	Some stores in the nationwide Home Depot chain have limited how  
many sheets customers can buy, spokesman Jerry Shields said. 
</P>
<P>
	``It varies geographically by what's going on in that market as  
far as building starts and construction,'' he said. ``Obviously, we 
can't get as much as we need. The point is demand is greater than 
supply for everyone.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Pelican Building Supply in North Charleston has sold 12,000  
sheets of drywall not even delivered yet. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is the first time this has happened,'' said Jason  
Villaume, a company shipping supervisor. Those who order today will 
get their drywall in about a month, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Blackburn, the home builder, said the shortage hurts his  
customer relations. 
</P>
<P>
	``When I have to wait three to four weeks for Sheetrock, it  
doesn't make me look good,'' he said. ``They have to pay more 
interest on their money and the house is just sitting there.''

<HEADLINE> Stocks End Lower; Dow Down 51.06 / Wall Street Report  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Stock prices drifted lower today, halting  
another attempt by the Dow Jones industrial average to close above 
10,000, as interest rates rose in the bond market. 
</P>
<P>
	At the 4 p.m. close on Wall Street, the Dow was down 51.06 at  
9,879.41, or nearly 121 points shy of 10,000. On Tuesday, the index 
briefly passed that milestone for the first time before falling 
back and closing with a loss. 
</P>
<P>
	The Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 fell 8.54 to 1,297.82, and the  
technology-heavy Nasdaq composite index declined 10.30 to 2,428.97. 
</P>
<P>
	Declining issues outnumbered advancers by a 6-to-5 margin on the  
New York Stock Exchange, with 1,368 up, 1,628 down and 567 
unchanged. 
</P>
<P>
	NYSE volume totaled 749.79 million shares as of 4 p.m., vs.  
738.8 million the previous session. 
</P>
<P>
	The NYSE composite index fell 3.43 to 610.65, and the American  
Stock Exchange composite index declined 0.48 to 715.83. 
</P>
<P>
	The Russell 2000 index of smaller companies fell 0.74 to 398.43.  
</P>
<P>
	The Dow made some headway in the first hour of trading today,  
rising as high as 9,960.71, or less than 40 points away from 
10,000. But bond prices backed off, and stocks followed, sending 
the Dow lower. 
</P>
<P>
	The 30-year Treasury bond was down 3/16 point, pushing its yield  
up to 5.5 percent from 5.47 percent late Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	The higher bond yields certainly didn't help, but Larry Wachtel,  
market analyst at Prudential Securities, said the stock market was 
in a normal cooling-off period after rising aggressively. 
</P>
<P>
	From its close at 9,274.88 on March 3 to its intraday high  
Tuesday of 10,001.78, the Dow has surged 725 points, Wachtel 
pointed out. 
</P>
<P>
	``If there were no Dow 10,000, and the index had risen that much  
in two weeks, nobody would be questioning its giving back a little 
today,'' Wachtel said. ``The fact that you're holding up as much as 
you are, on top of that kind of move, is encouraging.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Dow briefly rose past 10,000 Tuesday, but profit-takers  
descended on the market almost immediately, and the Dow finished 
down 28.30 at 9,930.47, leaving for another day its first close 
above 10,000. 
</P>
<P>
	Today, the Dow industrials were led lower by technology issues,  
including IBM, and financial stocks, which declined in reaction to 
the higher interest rates. 
</P>
<P>
	Internet-related stocks rose after Netscape's shareholders  
approved the company's $10 billion purchase by America Online. Dow 
component Caterpillar rose after Salomon Smith Barney upgraded the 
stock to ``buy'' from ``neutral.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But Eli Lilly fell after SG Cowen &AMP; Co. pared earnings  
expectations for the drugmaker, saying sales prospects for its 
flagship Prozac drug are dimmer than he had anticipated.

<HEADLINE> Senate Debate Missile-Defense Bill </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- With passage of missile-defense legislation  
now assured, senators skirmished over political considerations 
today with Republicans accusing President Clinton and congressional 
Democrats of an eleventh-hour conversion. 
</P>
<P>
	The president ``should pick his fights with Congress on foreign  
policy issues'' more carefully, asserted Sen. John Warner, R-Va., 
chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee. He said the debate 
over missile defense should have been resolved earlier and that 
Clinton's slowness to recognize this set back development of such a 
system. 
</P>
<P>
	The administration on Tuesday withdrew its long-standing veto  
threat, suggesting bipartisan amendments make the legislation more 
palatable. Republicans welcomed the belated support of Democrats, 
but questioned the timing. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm glad to hear he (Clinton) has now dropped his veto threat.  
But as usual, his pledge comes a little late and falls short,'' 
said Sen. Bob Smith, R-N.H., a 2000 presidential aspirant. ``For 
whatever reason, the president has failed to help us build a system 
to protect the nation against ballistic missile attack.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Democrats cited reports of North Korean ballistic-missile tests  
and Chinese nuclear-weapons espionage in suddenly dropping their 
opposition, along with an amendment designed to keep the 
development of such a system from interfering with efforts to 
negotiate further nuclear weapons decreases with Russia. 
</P>
<P>
	``I come to the floor supportive of the notion that we are in a  
new world today. ... It is a new world that seeks to protect us 
against a rogue, accidental or unauthorized'' missile firing, Sen. 
John Kerry, D-Mass., told the Senate. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, he said, the United States shouldn't ``rush headlong into  
the building of a system that just creates greater unrest ... and 
more question marks.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Senate was expected to pass the bill later today by a  
lopsided margin. 
</P>
<P>
	The bill would make it U.S. policy to deploy a national  
ballistic-missile defense ``as soon as technologically possible.'' 
The administration had wanted to delay a decision on whether to 
field such a system until June 2000, after which actually building 
it would take an additional five years. 
</P>
<P>
	The administration abandoned its opposition Tuesday, agreeing to  
a compromise with Republicans designed to keep deployment of a 
national missile defense from interfering with arms-control efforts 
with Moscow. 
</P>
<P>
	The 99-0 acceptance of a proposal by Sens. Mary Landrieu, D-La.,  
and Olympia Snowe, R-Maine, all but assured passage of the overall 
measure. 
</P>
<P>
	Although Senate Democrats praised the compromise, critics  
suggested it was a face-saving gesture that recognized the growing 
popularity of the bill -- in the face of reports of North Korean 
missile tests and alleged Chinese weapons espionage. 
</P>
<P>
	Tom Collina of the Union of Concerned Scientists, which opposes  
the legislation, called the result ``sort of vacuous policy'' that 
he said will do little except annoy China and Russia. 
</P>
<P>
	``The Democrats are running scared on this,'' he said. ``The  
Republicans have had this issue for years. Now the threat has 
appeared and the Democrats were caught flat-footed.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But Sen. Carl Levin, D-Mich., who had fought for years to keep  
the bill from even coming to a Senate vote, praised the measure and 
said he did not think it would undermine the 1972 Anti-Ballistic 
Missile treaty with Moscow, as he claimed the original version 
would have. 
</P>
<P>
	Russia contends that the legislation violates the treaty and  
would put on hold any further nuclear weapons reductions. Russian 
lawmakers introduced a bill Tuesday that would make their approval 
of the START II arms reduction treaty -- which the United States is 
anxious to see ratified -- dependent on a U.S. commitment to the ABM 
treaty. 
</P>
<P>
	The administration had threatened a veto.  
</P>
<P>
	But, Levin told reporters after Tuesday's vote, he was not  
certain that such a veto could have been sustained this year. The 
missile-defense bill ``was going to pass anyway, perhaps over the 
president's veto,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	The Landrieu-Snowe amendment still commits the United States to  
a missile-defense system. But it adds: ``It is the position of the 
United States to seek continued negotiated reductions in Russian 
nuclear forces.'' 
</P>
<P>
	That would uphold the spirit, if not the letter, of the ABM  
treaty, supporters said. That 1972 pact restricts the kinds of 
ballistic-missile defense that either Moscow or Washington can 
deploy.

<HEADLINE> Cornerback Irvin Signs With Bills </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ORCHARD PARK, N.Y. (AP) -- Buffalo re-signed cornerback Ken Irvin  
on Wednesday, shoring up the Bills' defensive backfield after Ray 
Jackson was taken by the Cleveland Browns in the expansion draft. 
</P>
<P>
	Irvin, 26, joined the Bills as the first of the team's two  
fourth-round draft picks in 1995. In 64 games in four seasons, he 
had 20 starts, 115 tackles and three interceptions. 
</P>
<P>
	Terms of the contract were not disclosed. Irvin's agent, Kyle  
Rote, said Irvin turned down more money offered by another team in 
order to remain with the Bills. 
</P>
<P>
	Last season, Irvin started every game at left cornerback and  
recorded 65 tackles and one interception. He also led the team with 
25 passes broken up.

<HEADLINE> High-Tech Theft Costs Companies $4B </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- U.S. businesses lose an estimated $4 billion  
annually due to high-tech theft, according to the most far-reaching 
study yet released on the problem. 
</P>
<P>
	But increased security by the industry's largest high-tech  
manufacturers firms has dramatically reduced their losses in recent 
years, said the study released today by an electronics trade group 
and a consortium of high-tech executives. 
</P>
<P>
	The large firms, including Texas Instruments Inc. and Intel  
Corp., are taking steps that range from improved background checks 
of employees to more discreet packaging of products in transit. 
</P>
<P>
	``The trends are going in the right direction,'' said Mike  
McQuade, a senior vice president of the American Electronics 
Association. ``It's pretty good news, although the problem has not 
gone away.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The electronics association and the International Electronics  
Security Group sponsored the two-year study, which was carried out 
by Santa Monica, Calif. think tank Rand Corp. 
</P>
<P>
	Rand surveyed 95 high-tech manufacturers that together account  
for 40 percent of sales volume in the computer, semiconductor, hard 
disk drive and cellular telephone industries. 
</P>
<P>
	In the nine months ending June 1998, the 95 firms reported 1,704  
thefts of equipment and parts worth nearly $35 million globally, 
including more than $17 million worth of losses in the United 
States. The incidents ranged from truck hijackings to thefts from 
the companies' offices. 
</P>
<P>
	Based on that data, the study estimated that $125 million worth  
of high-tech goods is stolen annually in this country. 
</P>
<P>
	The study then projected that high-tech theft costs American  
businesses $4 billion annually. The total includes the value of 
lost goods as well as indirect costs including insurance, security 
and lost sales. 
</P>
<P>
	The study did not include data on theft of consumer goods from  
homes or stores. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, high-tech firms have begun to tighten security in recent  
years, researchers noted. Improvements include more television 
cameras and secure doors on loading docks, better inventory 
controls and more discreet packaging for shipments. 
</P>
<P>
	Texas Instruments, for example, in the last year began checking  
the backgrounds of contractors before hiring them, said Skip 
Williams, vice president of worldwide security. 
</P>
<P>
	The company also recently brought together risk management,  
security, legal and logistics departments to study how to better 
protect semiconductors in transit, said Williams. 
</P>
<P>
	``We've taken a few losses of our own, mostly in transit,'' said  
Williams. ``We have worked with carriers and transporters to change 
the methods in which they handle our product both at warehouses as 
well as aboard airplanes.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A single shipment of semiconductors -- the components that are  
critical to making cellular phones and other electronics goods -- 
can be worth several million dollars. Thefts of such goods in 
transit has been a growing problem for the industry. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's incredible how this property is treated. It should be  
treated like cash, but it's treated like a can of peas,'' said Rich 
Bernes, executive director of the nonprofit Technology Theft 
Prevention Foundation. 
</P>
<P>
	Following security improvements and other changes including more  
attention to the problem by law enforcement, 18 large firms in the 
study cut theft losses 75 percent in one year. Losses cost $80 
million in 1996 and only $21 million a year later, the study 
reported.

	SAN JUAN, Puerto Rico (AP) -- Vice President Al Gore has picked  
Puerto Rican Gov. Pedro Rossello to handle his presidential primary 
campaign on the island, the San Juan Star reported Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Campaign manager Craig Smith was quoted by the newspaper as  
saying that Gore hopes Rossello's clout among Hispanics and 
influence in state government organizations will help galvanize 
support for Gore. 
</P>
<P>
	Puerto Ricans cannot vote for president because of the island's  
peculiar commonwealth relationship with the United States. But they 
can vote in primaries, donate money to campaigns and raise money 
for candidates. 
</P>
<P>
	In the U.S. territory, the choice was seen as a coup for  
Rossello, who wants Puerto Rico to become the 51st U.S. state.

<HEADLINE> 6 Retailers Settle Charges With FTC </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Wal-Mart, Burlington Coat Factory, Bugle Boy  
and several other clothing manufacturers and retailers have agreed 
to clearly state the origin of textile products in their Internet 
catalogs, after government regulators found them in violation of 
disclosure laws. 
</P>
<P>
	The Federal Trade Commission, which announced the agreements  
Tuesday, alleged that the companies did not comply with laws 
requiring mail-order catalogs, including those distributed 
electronically, to list whether a textile item was made in the 
United States, was imported, or is a combination. 
</P>
<P>
	The statutes also mandate that textile and woolen goods have  
labels listing fiber content, country of origin and the identity of 
any second party hired to market or handle the items. 
</P>
<P>
	According to the commission, these companies violated laws that  
make it a crime to sell or advertise misbranded products with 
online promotional materials: Wal-Mart Stores Inc., Burlington Coat 
Factory Warehouse Corp., Delia's Inc., Woolrich Inc., Gottschalks 
Inc. and Bugle Boy Industries. The FTC reached a settlement with 
Abercrombie &AMP; Fitch for alleged violations in its print catalog. 
</P>
<P>
	Bentonville, Ark.-based Wal-Mart said any infringement of  
disclosure laws was inadvertent. 
</P>
<P>
	``Wal-Mart is now taking steps to ensure continued compliance,  
including training new associates and making existing associates 
aware of the law,'' the company said in a statement. 
</P>
<P>
	Bugle Boy Industries said it was unaware until October that the  
FTC had extended its country-of-origin requirements to the Internet 
and took corrective action immediately. 
</P>
<P>
	Under the agreement, the companies also are subject to record  
keeping and reporting requirements to help the FTC monitor 
compliance.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Attends Fund-Raiser in Fla. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	STUART, Fla. (AP) -- At a Florida fund-raiser, the old Ben E.  
King tune ``Stand By Me'' took on extra meaning for a president who 
escaped ouster a little more than a month ago. 
</P>
<P>
	President Clinton, speaking after the group sang the song at the  
plush home of trial lawyer Willie Gary, said it reminded him of 
``how the American people stood by me through thick and thin.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``This country has got to get over believing that our political  
life is about beating each other up and hurting people instead of 
lifting people up and bringing them together,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton spoke at a $500,000 Democratic National Committee  
fund-raiser at Gary's home, a mansion on the St. Lucie River about 
40 minutes north of Palm Beach. 
</P>
<P>
	Recalling his own small-town upbringing, Clinton told his  
listeners they had a responsibility to reinvest in the communities 
they came from so others would have an opportunity to succeed. 
</P>
<P>
	Gary credited Clinton with increasing the median income of black  
households, raising the minimum wage and providing tax credits to 
low-income families. He said it was extraordinary that Clinton, who 
hailed from a house hard by the railroad tracks in Hope, Ark., had 
come to the home of a man whose father had been a sharecropper. 
</P>
<P>
	A massive chandelier dominated the atrium of the home where  
Clinton joined about 250 supporters. Florida Democratic Reps. Alcee 
Hastings and Peter Deutsch joined the president aboard Air Force 
One for the day-trip to Florida. 
</P>
<P>
	The Rev. Jesse Jackson and incoming DNC co-chairman Joe Andrew  
attended the event, as did Minnesota Vikings receiver Cris Carter. 
</P>
<P>
	Andrew cast the affair as another gathering of Democratic forces  
determined to regain control of Congress and retain the presidency 
in 2000. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton also had been scheduled to attend a fund-raising  
luncheon in West Palm Beach, but it was canceled because of a death 
in the family of the hosts. 
</P>
<P>
	The president returned to Washington early today.

<HEADLINE> Roar Greets Dow, Then Work </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- A roar exploded through the floor of the New  
York Stock Exchange after the Dow industrials crossed 10,000 today 
for the first time. But less than a minute later, it was back to 
work. 
</P>
<P>
	Traders gathered around displays on the NYSE floor and a kazoo  
player among them trumpeted a cavalry charge as the Dow moved 
toward 10,000. When the milestone was passed at 9:50.50 a.m., 
cheers erupted, papers fluttered through the air and traders threw 
their arms up -- with some holding all 10 fingers aloft to signify 
the record. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's kind of astonishing. That's the mood of a lot of people  
who have been in the market for a long time. It's beyond everyone's 
wildest expectations,'' said Robert Seijas, a stock specialist at 
the NYSE. 
</P>
<P>
	The euphoria subsided quickly, however, and the crowds soon  
dissipated. Within about 30 seconds, the hordes of traders in 
multicolored jackets went back to their usual business of 
scribbling notes on pads like frantic waiters. 
</P>
<P>
	Onlookers packed the visitors gallery, hoping to catch a glimpse  
of the record, while dozens of television news cameras and 
photographers overlooked the NYSE floor. 
</P>
<P>
	Dave Colquhoun, an economics teacher at Woodmere Academy on New  
York's Long Island, brought a group of 10 students to the exchange 
as part of their lesson on stock markets. Colquhoun didn't make it 
inside in time for the 10,000 crossing, but he was excited that his 
students were able to be at the scene nonetheless. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a day in history. For them to see this is an amazing  
feat,'' Colquhoun said. ``Where else in the world would you see 
this kind of activity and this much money changing hands?''

<HEADLINE> Hale-Bopp: A Cosmic Leftover? </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	The comet Hale-Bopp may be brimming with some of the primordial  
material from which the sun and the planets formed more than 4 
billion years ago, researchers reported today in the journal 
Nature. 
</P>
<P>
	California Institute of Technology scientists who tuned radio  
telescopes onto the comet's nucleus as it cut across the solar 
system in 1997 found vents spewing a volatile mixture of gas and 
dust into space. 
</P>
<P>
	The images suggest that 15 percent to 40 percent of Hale-Bopp's  
mass is pristine interstellar material, while the rest has been 
transformed extensively during the comet's passage through space. 
</P>
<P>
	The images are among the finest ever obtained of a comet with  
radio telescopes. 
</P>
<P>
	Comets are often called dirty snowballs. Most orbit far from the  
sun in the deep freeze beyond Pluto's orbit. That enables them to 
remain virtually unchanged over billions of years. 
</P>
<P>
	``Nothing has changed much out there since that time. Therefore  
it's a way of sampling some of the chemistry, or very close to what 
it was, when the solar system formed,'' said Paul Weisman, a 
scientist at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, Calif., 
who was not involved in the work. 
</P>
<P>
	The CalTech researchers found two icy jets erupting with forms  
of primordial deuterium-hydrogen, the poisonous gas hydrogen 
cyanide and a form of hydrogen called heavy water. The material may 
be rising from deep within the comet, said Geoffrey Blake, a 
CalTech professor of cosmochemistry and planetary sciences. 
</P>
<P>
	Actual proof that comets contain the primordial material of the  
solar system may have to wait until a spacecraft can dig inside 
one. 
</P>
<P>
	A NASA probe that is set for launch in 2003 will try to do that  
for the first time ever in 2006. If it survives the landing, it 
will drill into Comet Temple 1 to sample what's inside.

<HEADLINE> Saks Posts 26 Percent Profit Rise </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BIRMINGHAM, Ala. (AP) -- Saks Inc.'s earnings rose 26 percent to  
nearly $142.8 million in the latest quarter, but the retailer's 
stock fell after it warned that profits may be lower than expected 
as it completes a series of buyouts. 
</P>
<P>
	Excluding merger expenses and losses from store closings, Saks's  
earnings met analysts' expectations of 97 cents a share in the 
three months ended Jan. 30. That compared to $113.3 million or 77 
cents a share in the same period a year ago. The year-earlier 
figures excluded a one-time accounting gain of $237 million. 
</P>
<P>
	But Saks said its earnings this year would fall below earlier  
forecasts because of new estimates of costs associated with 
refinanced debt, depreciation and taxes. The news sent Saks' stock 
down $1.50, or 5 percent, to $27.43 3/4 on the New York Stock 
Exchange. 
</P>
<P>
	Stockholders last fall approved Proffitt's $2.1 billion takeover  
of Saks Holdings, the parent company of Saks Fifth Avenue, just 
months after it bought the Wisconsin-based Carson Pirie Scott. 
Hoping to trade on a marquee name, Proffitt's changed its name to 
Saks. 
</P>
<P>
	Chief executive Brad Martin said he was ``quite pleased with the  
smooth integration of our businesses,'' and expected some $115 
million in savings this year. 
</P>
<P>
	For the year ended Jan. 30, Saks reported earnings of $239  
million, an increase of 35 percent from $176.6 million a year 
earlier. Earnings per share rose to $1.63 from $1.24 a year before. 
</P>
<P>
	Saks has about 350 stores operating under the names Proffitt's,  
McRae's, Younkers, Parisian, Herberger's, Carson Pirie Scott, 
Boston Store, Bergner's, Saks Fifth Avenue, and Off 5th. 
</P>
<P>
	The company also has two direct-mail businesses, Bullock &AMP; Jones  
and Folio.

<HEADLINE> Timberwolves Sign Scott, Curley </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MINNEAPOLIS (AP) -- The Minnesota Timberwolves said Wednesday  
they have signed Bill Curley for the rest of the season and Dennis 
Scott to a 10-day contract. 
</P>
<P>
	Curley was traded to the New Jersey Nets last Thursday along  
with Stephon Marbury as part of a nine-player deal. The Nets then 
waived Curley on Saturday. Curley had appeared in 16 games with 
Minnesota and averaged 2.4 points and 1.2 rebounds per game. 
</P>
<P>
	Scott had appeared in 15 games this season with the New York  
Knicks before being waived on Feb. 13. He was a first-round draft 
pick for Orlando in 1990 and holds the NBA records for 3-pointers 
in a season (267), in a game (11) and in a half (7). Scott has 
averaged 14.2 points per game over nine seasons, though he averaged 
2.9 points per game for the Knicks. 
</P>
<P>
	Curley and Scott will be in uniform Thursday night when the  
Wolves play the Vancouver Grizzlies. 
</P>
<P>
	Also Wednesday, the Timberwolves placed center Trevor Winter on  
the injured list with a lower back strain.

<P>
	ATLANTA (AP) -- Mark Price, who retired last month after a  
12-year NBA career, returned to Georgia Tech as an assistant coach 
on Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Price was the first big-time recruit to join Bobby Cremins'  
program in 1982, leading the Yellow Jackets from the bottom of the 
Atlantic Coast Conference to a tournament championship two years 
later. 
</P>
<P>
	He was a three-time NBA All-Star during a playing career spent  
primarily with the Cleveland Cavaliers. Price, 35, maintained a 
home in Atlanta after his graduation from Georgia Tech in 1986. 
</P>
<P>
	An opening was created on the Georgia Tech staff when Frank  
Beall, the director of basketball operations, went into private 
business. Assistant Gary Leiner will assume Beall's non-coaching 
duties, with Price likely to fill Leiner's spot on Cremins' staff.

<HEADLINE>  Blue Jays Fire Johnson As Manager </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DUNEDIN, Fla. (AP) -- Tim Johnson, who lied about his military  
service in Vietnam, was fired by the Blue Jays and replaced by Jim 
Fregosi today. 
</P>
<P>
	General manager Gord Ash, who hired Johnson before last season,  
said the military service controversy had become a distraction in 
preparation for the season. The Blue Jays were 3-12 in exhibition 
games. 
</P>
<P>
	Fregosi, who signed to a two-year deal, was in the Blue Jays'  
camp today. He had been with the San Francisco Giants as a special 
assistant to the general manager. 
</P>
<P>
	``I have always wanted to manage,'' he said. ``I missed the  
action, I missed the field.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Firing a manager in spring training is rare, but not  
unprecedented. Phil Cavaretta was fired by the Chicago Cubs in 
March 1954. 
</P>
<P>
	``We've got 18 games,'' Fregosi said. ``We'll be ready by  
opening day.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Johnson was unavailable for comment. He left Florida and was  
driving to see family members in Kansas. 
</P>
<P>
	Blue Jays players found out about the managing change when they  
arrived for workouts this morning. 
</P>
<P>
	``When did that happen?'' pitcher David Wells asked. ``I don't  
know what to say. Jim's a good guy.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Fregosi was in uniform for today's exhibition game against the  
Phillies in Clearwater. 
</P>
<P>
	Fregosi, with an 861-937 record with three teams, managed  
Philadelphia from 1991-96. He guided the Phillies to the World 
Series in 1993, when they lost to the Blue Jays, managed by Cito 
Gaston. 
</P>
<P>
	Fregosi, who becomes Toronto's seventh manager, began his  
managerial career with the California Angels (1978-1981) and led 
them to the playoffs against Baltimore in 1979. He then moved on to 
the Chicago White Sox (1987-1988) and the Phillies. 
</P>
<P>
	Ash said the move to change managers began last week when he met  
with the Toronto's owners and ``expressed some concern about our 
ability to move forward.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``They gave me the opportunity to examine some possibilities,''  
Ash said, and he asked the Giants for permission to talk with 
Fregosi. 
</P>
<P>
	``We talked to him a year ago (when the team was looking for a  
replacement for Gaston). As a result of that conversation, and that 
he was available, we came to the conclusion over the weekend on the 
deal.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ash said he didn't make the switch during the winter because he  
felt Johnson deserved ``the chance to have the opportunity to come 
to spring training and see if it could work.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But, according to Ash, Johnson's lies about being in combat in  
Vietnam ``wasn't going to fade into the background as quickly as I 
hoped. It became a distraction.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ash said the Blue Jays' exhibition record wasn't a factor.  
</P>
<P>
	``It didn't help but I can't say it was a component of the  
dismissal,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Ash said Johnson, fired at 1 a.m. after Toronto's 2-1 exhibition  
loss to the Yankees in Tampa had been asked to take a leave of 
absence. 
</P>
<P>
	Johnson was about to start his second year managing the American  
League team. The former U.S. Marine was Ash's hand-picked choice, 
bypassing more experienced managers such as Fregosi and Davey 
Johnson in replacing Gaston. 
</P>
<P>
	The Jays stumbled at the start, then finished strongly. But Tim  
Johnson was enveloped in controversy when it was revealed his war 
stories about Vietnam were false. A conflict with pitching coach 
Mel Queen also ensued. 
</P>
<P>
	Johnson taught mortar training to recruits going to Vietnam, but  
never served there. He made a public apology, met individually with 
reporters to discuss his problem and said he was seeking 
counseling. 
</P>
<P>
	But the issue never went away and Johnson was dogged with  
questions wherever he went. 
</P>
<P>
	``Jim Fregosi has a passion to manage with the experience,  
know-how, savvy and communications skills to make it work,'' Ash 
said. ``Jim will meet the coaching staff today, however no other 
changes are expected at this time.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Fregosi said he was looking forward to managing again.  
</P>
<P>
	``I'm excited about taking over the club,'' he said. ``(There's)  
a lot of ability here. I don't think I've been brought over in a 
youth movement. I've been brought in to win games.''

<HEADLINE> Reno Opposes Counsel Law Extension </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Attorney General Janet Reno told Congress  
today that she dropped her earlier support for the independent 
counsel law after seeing her decisions on some cases ``plunged into 
the political process.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Maybe ... it has to do just with your decisions,'' retorted  
Sen. Fred Thompson, R-Tenn., chairman of the Senate Governmental 
Affairs Committee. 
</P>
<P>
	Reno appeared before the committee to oppose extending the law  
governing independent counsels. 
</P>
<P>
	The Justice Department reversed course in recent weeks to oppose  
another five-year renewal of the law. Reno's top deputy testified 
earlier this month in opposition to an extension. 
</P>
<P>
	Reno said that when she became attorney general, ``I didn't  
account for the focus and the immediate posture of any decision I 
made, to see it plunged into the political process.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Reno has been under fire from Republicans in Congress, including  
Thompson, for failure to recommend an independent counsel 
investigation of fund raising by the 1996 Clinton re-election 
campaign. 
</P>
<P>
	In his remarks to a House panel, Deputy Attorney General Eric  
Holder emphasized that the administration's new opposition was not 
based on ``problems with individual independent counsels,'' such as 
Kenneth Starr, whose five-year investigation of President Clinton 
led to the second presidential impeachment in history. 
</P>
<P>
	He said the law ``comes dangerously close to tipping the  
traditional balance of fairness in the conduct of criminal 
investigations and prosecutions'' by insulating independent 
counsels from financial accountability and traditional Justice 
Department rules. 
</P>
<P>
	The law is set to expire June 30. It is widely disliked by  
members of both parties after independent counsel investigations of 
Republican and Democratic presidents and other government 
officials. 
</P>
<P>
	If Congress lets the law expire, as it did in 1992 before  
renewing it 18 months later, dozens of high-ranking government 
officials who now could be subject to an independent counsel 
inquiry would be investigated instead by the Justice Department. 
Reno recommended keeping the law then. 
</P>
<P>
	The Justice Department has administered the law since its  
beginning in 1978. It gives the attorney general a framework for 
recommending that an outside investigator take over inquiries into 
certain high-level White House and other government figures. 
</P>
<P>
	Reno, who has recommended appointment of seven independent  
counsels during her six-year tenure, has been the frequent target 
of congressional critics such as Sen. Orrin Hatch, R-Utah, who 
claims she has been biased toward the White House.

<HEADLINE> Anesthesia Deaths Raise Concern </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The surgery was supposed to be so simple: A  
few hours in the doctor's office and Susan Pearce would be home by 
dinner. 
</P>
<P>
	But shortly after going home from the breast augmentation, awake  
but groggy, the 27-year-old Alabama woman died of respiratory 
failure from powerful sedatives still in her blood. 
</P>
<P>
	Her husband says nobody warned them of danger. ``The procedure  
was done in his office, so I didn't have any reason to think there 
was a big risk involved,'' says Donald Pearce. 
</P>
<P>
	A spate of deaths -- most from liposuction and other cosmetic  
surgeries, but also among children sedated for dental work or MRI 
scans -- has experts questioning the safety of sedation administered 
in private doctors' offices. 
</P>
<P>
	Deaths from anesthesia in a hospital or outpatient surgical  
centers are extremely rare. Hosts of specialists are on hand to try 
to revive patients with problems. 
</P>
<P>
	But more surgery is moving to private offices, sometimes  
performed by physicians with little experience in handling powerful 
sedating drugs and little equipment to save patients who get into 
trouble, says Dr. John Neeld, president of the American Society of 
Anesthesiology. 
</P>
<P>
	Nobody counts how many deaths or injuries result from  
office-administered anesthesia. Experts believe the overall risk is 
small, considering the number of procedures in doctors' offices. 
</P>
<P>
	``Hundreds of thousands of these (cosmetic) procedures are done  
on a yearly basis, and people come out overwhelmingly happier,'' 
says Dr. Mark Gorney, former president of the American Society for 
Plastic and Reconstructive Surgery and medical director of The 
Doctors' Co., a major carrier of malpractice insurance. 
</P>
<P>
	But Gorney warns there are serious risks and says choosing a  
well-trained surgeon is crucial: 60 to 70 Americans died during 
routine liposuction from January 1997 to fall 1998, according to 
his survey of plastic surgeons and fellow insurers. He says many 
died from excessive doses of the anesthetic lidocaine; other 
complications included infections. 
</P>
<P>
	Clusters of other deaths are moving New Jersey, Florida and  
California toward the first safety regulations for certain office 
surgeries. 
</P>
<P>
	``I just think the public needs to be warned,'' Neeld says. He  
calls the deaths preventable, and is urging malpractice carriers 
and more state medical boards to investigate. 
</P>
<P>
	In most places, no laws restrict surgeries in private offices by  
licensed doctors, regardless of their surgical or anesthesia 
training. 
</P>
<P>
	Even when patients pick a skilled surgeon, operating in a  
private office means there is no backup for the rare patient with 
problems, says Dr. Charles Cote of the University of Illinois, 
Chicago, a pediatric anesthesiologist. 
</P>
<P>
	``When something goes wrong, the only thing you're left with is  
calling 911,'' warns Cote, who is preparing to publish a study 
suggesting sedation for children is riskiest during dental work and 
MRI scans. 
</P>
<P>
	Among the deaths prompting concern:  
</P>
<P>
	--Anesthesia caused a 28-year-old Virginia Beach, Va., woman  
undergoing breast augmentation in January to overheat drastically. 
``Malignant hyperthermia'' is a rare side effect easily 
counteracted with a quick dose of dantrolene. But that drug is sold 
in a 36-vial supply that costs almost $2,000, so few private 
offices stock it, says Dr. Henry Rosenberg of Philadelphia, 
president of the Malignant Hyperthermia Association. By the time 
the surgeon got the woman to an emergency room, her temperature had 
soared to a killer 107 degrees. 
</P>
<P>
	--A San Francisco woman was left overnight in her surgeon's  
office to recover from a facelift. A nonlicensed health worker gave 
her a shot of painkilling Demerol, turned off the alarm to her 
heart monitor and fell asleep. The Demerol was an overdose. Hers 
was one of five deaths connected to office cosmetic surgery and 
investigated by the California medical board in the last two years, 
although Gorney reports nine deaths. Four bills to require stricter 
safety procedures are pending in the Legislature. 
</P>
<P>
	--Five California preschoolers have died from oversedation in  
dentist chairs since 1991; four were given the oral sedative 
chloral hydrate to keep them still. Many general dentists are not 
trained in oral sedation, says Dr. Peter Hartmann, past president 
of the California dental board. A law that goes into effect next 
January requires proof of training for dentists using oral 
sedatives, and safety monitors for sedated children. 
</P>
<P>
	--Eighteen Floridians have died from cosmetic surgery since 1997,  
according to an investigation by the Sun-Sentinel of Fort 
Lauderdale. The state medical board in January approved rules 
limiting office cosmetic procedures to four hours, requiring 
training for certain anesthesia, and limiting to two quarts the 
amount of fat removed. 
</P>
<P>
	--In New Jersey, an 18-month-old died of respiratory failure  
while lying sedated and unmonitored inside an MRI machine, says Dr. 
Ervin Moss of the New Jersey Society of Anesthesiologists. That, 
plus two liposuction deaths in a dermatology office, prompted the 
medical board to require credentials for office-based surgeons 
using certain anesthesia, making New Jersey the first state to do 
so. 
</P>
<P>
	It is fairly easy to administer local or regional anesthestics,  
those shots that numb a few body parts. 
</P>
<P>
	But more complex surgeries require powerful combinations of  
sedating drugs, or drugs with obscure effects that take advanced 
training to master, Neeld says. 
</P>
<P>
	Take those dental deaths: Children given chloral hydrate can  
become temporarily agitated. A dentist who does not know the 
agitation quickly wears off may give the child a second, 
potentially fatal dose, warns California's Hartmann. 
</P>
<P>
	Then there is the question of when to send a patient home.  
</P>
<P>
	Versed, a common office sedative, is reversed by the drug  
flumazenil. But if doctors do not know that flumazenil clears out 
of the bloodstream faster than Versed, they may think patients are 
fully alert when enough Versed lurks in their blood to later 
re-sedate them, Neeld says. 
</P>
<P>
	That is what attorney Michael Worel believes happened to Susan  
Pearce. The Mobile, Ala., coroner ruled her death accidental, a 
side effect of sedation. The surgeon denies any negligence; a 
malpractice suit is pending. 
</P>
<P>
	Safety equipment can help doctors avoid or rectify emergencies.  
But too few doctors use simple machines that measure oxygen levels, 
or have full ``crash carts'' or people certified in cardiac 
resuscitation, says New Jersey's Moss. 
</P>
<P>
	``If you're going to use a drug with a potency that's  
dangerous,'' Gorney says, ``have the decency to learn how to 
recognize overdose and know what to do about it -- because you have 
little time to act.''

<HEADLINE> Ex-Army General Pleads Guilty </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	FORT LEWIS, Wash. (AP) -- A retired general pleaded guilty today  
to eight charges involving sexual improprieties with the wives of 
subordinates, becoming the highest ranking Army officer to be 
court-martialed since 1952. 
</P>
<P>
	Maj. Gen. David Hale, who was allowed to retire honorably in  
February 1998 after the allegations became public, entered his plea 
in exchange for the promise of a reduced sentence. 
</P>
<P>
	His case prompted complaints from some congressmen that his  
retirement represented a double standard when people of lower rank 
were court-martialed for alleged sexual misconduct. Defense 
Secretary William Cohen susbsequently tightened retirement rules 
for top officers to bar them from retiring until any charges 
against them are resolved. 
</P>
<P>
	Hale, 53, entered pleas to seven counts of conduct unbecoming an  
officer -- including having four improper relationships with the 
wives of subordinates -- and one count of making false official 
statements. 
</P>
<P>
	The maximum possible sentence was 11 years in prison, loss of  
his $75,000-a-year pension and dismissal from the service. 
</P>
<P>
	Penalties could be levied later today.  
</P>
<P>
	In exchange for Hale's plea, the Army dropped nine charges. Hale  
had faced a possible 56 years in prison if convicted of the 
original 17 counts, which included allegations that he lied to 
subordinates and superiors. 
</P>
<P>
	Under questioning today, Hale confirmed he would target  
vulnerable women in troubled marriages -- seeing them socially in 
scuba diving clubs, bowling clubs and shopping trips, giving them 
money for phone calls and sending them flowers. 
</P>
<P>
	He said his behavior ``certainly would create a perception and  
generate rumors that would damage my standing as an officer.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Hale offered to enter the pleas before a military judge today  
``because he is guilty'' of eight military offenses, defense lawyer 
Frank Spinner said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	But, Spinner said, Hale is ``not pleading guilty to any  
nonconsensual sexual offenses.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Even if these relationships were consensual, the fact is that  
because (Hale) was in a position of power, we can never be sure of 
that,'' Lawrence Korb, director of studies at the Council on 
Foreign Relations in New York, commented in a telephone interview 
this morning. 
</P>
<P>
	Hale, a decorated Vietnam veteran, was allowed to retire after  
four months as a deputy inspector general, despite alleged 
improprieties while he was a top NATO commander in southern Europe. 
</P>
<P>
	The allegations surfaced last year when The Washington Times  
reported that a woman named Donnamaria Carpino Madden had accused 
Hale of forcing her into a four-month sexual relationship in Turkey 
while her husband, an Army colonel, was posted there as director of 
their base's administration. 
</P>
<P>
	He also was accused of having improper relationships with the  
wives of subordinate officers in Virginia, Maine, Connecticut and 
Nevada. The alleged relationships occurred from 1996 to 1998. 
</P>
<P>
	``Today I feel elated and vindicated because Maj. Gen. Hale will  
soon stand before the country and the world as a convicted felon,'' 
Mrs. Madden said in a statement Tuesday. ``Justice has prevailed in 
what was a long and tortuous struggle for myself and my family.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Madden also has filed a civil action against the Army and  
Air Force, alleging officials tried to discredit her and ``defend 
one of their own,'' said her lawyer, Mark Zaid. 
</P>
<P>
	The Hale case has been contrasted with the 1998 court-martial of  
Gene McKinney, former sergeant major of the Army. 
</P>
<P>
	McKinney, the Army's highest-ranking enlisted man, was reduced  
in rank and reprimanded after he was convicted of obstruction of 
justice in a sexual misconduct case. He was acquitted of 18 counts 
alleging sexual harassment of six military women. 
</P>
<P>
	His lawyer said McKinney was treated far more harshly than many  
officers who had faced similar allegations. 
</P>
<P>
	In another case, Air Force Lt. Kelly Flinn, the nation's first  
and only female B-52 pilot, was given a general discharge after 
being charged with adultery for having an affair with the husband 
of a female airman in North Dakota. 
</P>
<P>
	The only other case in which an Army general faced court-martial  
since Congress enacted the Uniform Code of Military Justice in 1951 
was in 1952, when Maj. Gen. Robert W. Grow, the military attache in 
Moscow, was tried on charges of dereliction of duty. He was 
reprimanded and suspended from command for six months.

<HEADLINE> Montana Freemen Leaders Sentenced </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BILLINGS, Mont. (AP) -- Seven leaders of the anti-government  
Montana Freemen were sentenced to stiff prison terms for conspiring 
against the nation's banking system, though a judge spared two of 
the defendants' wives from more jail time. 
</P>
<P>
	U.S. District Judge John Coughenour ordered ringleader LeRoy  
Schweitzer to 22 1/2 years behind bars Tuesday, hoping to send ``a 
loud and clear message to those who pass this hatred and ugliness 
around.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Schweitzer's court-appointed lawyer, federal defender Tony  
Gallagher, said the ruling amounted to a life sentence for his 
61-year-old client. 
</P>
<P>
	U.S. Attorney Sherry Scheel Matteucci said she had mixed  
feelings about some of the sentences, but termed them ``very, very 
significant'' and said she was satisfied overall. 
</P>
<P>
	Schweitzer and five other defendants refused to enter the  
courtroom, continuing to demonstrate their scorn for the 
government. They were able to watch the proceedings via TV from a 
holding cell after Coughenour declined to have marshals bring them 
in by force. 
</P>
<P>
	Nine Freemen were convicted in two trials last year. They and  
their followers were accused of trying to undermine the nation's 
banking system by issuing thousands of bogus checks totaling 
billions of dollars. 
</P>
<P>
	``What we are talking about is a calculated and organized  
program to undermine the banking system of this country and to 
encourage other, more ignorant people to violate the law,'' 
Coughenour said. 
</P>
<P>
	About two dozen members of the anti-government group, living on  
a farm on the plains of Montana, held FBI agents at bay for 81 days 
in 1995 before surrendering without a shot being fired. 
</P>
<P>
	Schweitzer was convicted on 25 counts of conspiracy, bank fraud,  
threatening a federal judge, illegal possession of firearms and 
participating in the armed robbery of an ABC-TV crew covering the 
Freemen. 
</P>
<P>
	The judge sentenced Daniel Petersen Jr., probably the No. 2 man  
in the Freeman hierarchy, to 15 years in prison and ordered him to 
pay restitution of $39,845. 
</P>
<P>
	Rodney O. Skurdal, 46; and John P. McGuire, 61, were also  
sentenced to 15 years. Dale M. Jacobi, 57, a former Canadian police 
officer, received 13 years; Richard Clark, 12 years; and William 
Stanton, three years. 
</P>
<P>
	Agnes Stanton, Stanton's wife, and Cherlyn Petersen, Petersen's  
wife, were sentenced to time served and released. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition to maintaining they are not subject to federal or  
state laws, the Freemen also claimed that God intended white people 
to rule the earth, that blacks are animals and Jews are descendants 
of Satan.

<HEADLINE> Microsoft Has New Internet Software </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Microsoft Corp. is releasing a new version of  
its Internet Explorer software that appears less integrated with 
the Windows operating system, making it easier to separate some Web 
navigation features from computer desktop functions. 
</P>
<P>
	Critics said the features in Internet Explorer 5.0, which will  
be available starting Thursday, are inconsistent with Microsoft's 
steadfast contention in its antitrust battle that its Web browser 
is an essential part of the Windows operating system. 
</P>
<P>
	The government, in an ongoing suit, accuses Microsoft of using  
its dominance of the personal computer market to illegally force 
consumers who use Windows to also use its browser, dissuading them 
from using the popular Netscape Navigator browser. 
</P>
<P>
	Roughly 90 percent of the world's personal computers run on the  
Windows operating system. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's certainly inconsistent with the proposition that Internet  
Explorer is inherently and always a distinct part of the operating 
system,'' said Jonathan Jacobson, an antitrust attorney with the 
New York law firm of Akin Gump. 
</P>
<P>
	A Microsoft official rejected suggestions that the new Explorer  
is less closely integrated with Windows, reiterating the company's 
position that it merely gives consumers what they want. Shawn 
Sanford, product manager for Internet Explorer, said the underlying 
source code was still shared by the new browser and Windows. 
</P>
<P>
	``When you talk about integration you're talking about  
underlying (code),'' he said. ``Those processes are still as 
tightly integrated in IE 5.0 as they were in (the previous 
version).'' 
</P>
<P>
	A Justice Department spokeswoman declined to comment.  
</P>
<P>
	The new Internet Explorer offers a variety of minor improvements  
such as faster viewing of Web pages and a reduced tendency to 
``crash'' when retrieving Internet information. 
</P>
<P>
	When installed on computers running with Windows 95, users also  
will find fewer Web-related features meshed with desktop functions. 
Gone is Microsoft's ``Active Desktop,'' which makes files stored in 
the computer look and act like Web pages with links to the 
Internet. 
</P>
<P>
	But users of Windows 98 machines, which build Web-related  
features into the desktop functions, won't see these changes by 
installing Internet Explorer 5.0. 
</P>
<P>
	The new browser ``seems to be less ambitious in terms of  
integration compared to 4.0, which made itself part of the 
operating system,'' said Barry Parr, an analyst with International 
Data Corp., based in Mountain View, Calif. 
</P>
<P>
	``When you originally installed 4.0, it became your desktop.  
Anytime it opened a file, it would open a browser window.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Windows 95 users who try to disable the new browser after  
installing will no longer see the process referred to as 
``uninstall.'' Instead, the computer says, ``restore previous 
Windows configuration.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``They're trying to say it's a Windows configuration and not a  
separate product,'' said Jim Rapoza, who tested the browser for the 
PC Week trade publication. 
</P>
<P>
	Sanford said the wording was changed because it more accurately  
reflected the process.

<HEADLINE> MLS Ready for Another `Must' Season </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Major League Soccer starts its fourth season  
Saturday, facing two straight years of declining attendance but 
with far fewer concerns than any time since it began. 
</P>
<P>
	``The question doesn't seem to be anymore if we're going to  
survive, but how we're going to make the next step to being one of 
the top sports,'' Columbus Crew forward Brian McBride said. 
</P>
<P>
	The 12-team league opens after considerable movement of big-name  
players, a shakeup at MLS headquarters, the absence of coach Bruce 
Arena and a pending lawsuit attacking the structure of the league. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've said every year that each season is the most important,''  
MLS commissioner Doug Logan said. ``You have to take that with a 
grain of salt.'' 
</P>
<P>
	There are five games on opening day, highlighted by defending  
champion Chicago Fire at San Jose, and a new look to rosters 
following major trades involving Raul Diaz Arce, Alexi Lalas, Tony 
Meola and John Harkes. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm OK, but the ones who are really hurt are the fans, who are  
loyal to teams and players and then get treated like this,'' Meola 
said. ``But it's a reality in this league.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Most rosters are all but set, with only a few foreign  
allocations still pending. D.C. United, Chicago and Los Angeles are 
still the powers, but Columbus is a contender for MLS Cup '99 on 
Nov. 21 in Foxboro, Mass. 
</P>
<P>
	The Crew, run by Lamar Hunt, inaugurate their stadium May 15  
against New England. The 22,500-seat park is the first stadium in 
the United States built specifically for soccer. Season-ticket 
sales are up 45 percent in Columbus. 
</P>
<P>
	D.C. lost the MLS title game to Chicago in October but still won  
the bigger prize -- the InterAmerican Cup against Brazil's Vasco da 
Gama. 
</P>
<P>
	``D.C. is still the team to beat in the East, until somebody  
knocks them off,'' McBride said. 
</P>
<P>
	Washington went through the most dramatic changes. While Chicago  
and Los Angeles return virtually intact, United had to send 
defender Tony Sanneh (to Germany) and midfielder John Harkes (to 
New England) to get under the approximate $1.7 million salary cap. 
</P>
<P>
	Washington also lost Arena to the U.S. national team. Arena won  
the first two MLS titles and the InterAmerican crown. He is 
succeeded by Thomas Rongen. 
</P>
<P>
	The average crowd at MLS games last year, including two  
expansion franchises, dropped to 14,312 from 14,616, but overall 
attendance increased by more than 400,000. 
</P>
<P>
	Season-ticket sales are up just 2 percent from a year ago, but a  
shift in the schedule to have 58 percent of the league's 192 games 
on Saturday is expected to boost the gate. 
</P>
<P>
	The season begins with a big change at league headquarters.  
Sunil Gulati was stripped of his post as deputy commissioner last 
month, supposedly over renewing the contract of midfielder Tab 
Ramos without consulting the MetroStars. 
</P>
<P>
	Many are skittish about how the league will function without the  
one man primarily responsible for all player-contract negotiations. 
</P>
<P>
	Another issue is an antitrust lawsuit filed by the players'  
association. The case concerns the foundation of the league's 
business structure as a single entity. 
</P>
<P>
	The suit was filed before the start of the 1997 season and is  
not expected to go to trial until after the season. Even if a 
verdict comes before then, the league doesn't expect all appeals to 
be settled until late 2001. 
</P>
<P>
	In the front office, Los Angeles Kings owner Philip Anschutz  
bought into his third MLS club, the Los Angeles Galaxy, and 
installed Kings president Tim Leiweke as head of the soccer team. 
</P>
<P>
	Jonathan Kraft bought the rights to the San Jose Clash, his  
second club. He ousted president and general manager Peter 
Bridgwater and replaced him with 30-year-old Lynn Meterparel. 
Meterparel was an executive with Kraft's other club, the 
Revolution, and helped make New England one of the league's top 
draws. 
</P>
<P>
	A decision on expansion is expected by the end of August. The  
league would like to put teams next year in Houston and 
Philadelphia. Rochester, N.Y., and Cleveland also have outside 
shots. 
</P>
<P>
	Additionally, some teams are building or are thinking of  
building their own stadiums in an effort to avoid stadium clashes 
with more established tenants, usually NFL clubs.

<HEADLINE> Olympic Boss Gets Vote of Confidence </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LAUSANNE, Switzerland (AP) -- The applause washed over the  
embattled boss of the Olympics Wednesday, perhaps for one of the 
last times. 
</P>
<P>
	IOC president Juan Antonio Samaranch received a near-unanimous  
vote of confidence from committee members at the start of an 
emergency general assembly dealing with the worst scandal in 
Olympic history. 
</P>
<P>
	Later, Samaranch and the rest of the International Olympic  
Committee's leadership received another boost when the 
rank-and-file endorsed their recommendations to expel six members, 
an unprecedented purge. 
</P>
<P>
	But the key moment for the 78-year-old Spaniard may have come  
when he formally opened the meeting with a review of good times and 
a plan for getting through the bad ones. 
</P>
<P>
	Toward the end of the honor roll of past successes and the  
caseload of corruption from Salt Lake's efforts to buy the 2002 
Winter Olympics, Samaranch gave perhaps his clearest sign yet that 
his days at the top of the world's biggest sports event may be near 
an end. 
</P>
<P>
	``I have personally given the best of myself to the Olympic  
movement over the last 18 years ... and my last service to Olympism 
would be to restructure our organization in order to enter the new 
millennium even stronger than before,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	There was no mention in the speech of Samaranch's intent to fill  
out his term that ends in late 2001. 
</P>
<P>
	When asked in a brief news conference if he planned to serve out  
his term, Samaranch spoke mainly of his health. It's good, he said, 
despite reports that he has signs of Parkinson's disease. 
</P>
<P>
	Critics have called for Samaranch to step down now, which  
clearly won't happen. 
</P>
<P>
	He presented an ambitious reform plan, including a radical  
change in picking the 2006 Winter Games site, open financial 
records, the IOC's first ethics panel and a star-studded commission 
to plot the Olympics' fate, dubbed ``IOC 2000.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``They should look at everything that can best prepare the IOC  
for the future,'' Samaranch said. He gave them until another 
extraordinary session later this year to come up with the plan. 
</P>
<P>
	Those changes will be debated -- and likely adopted -- when the  
special session wraps up Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	Since becoming president in 1980, Samaranch has been a  
globe-trotting ambassador of the five rings, schmoozing with heads 
of state, posing with athletes and taking in just about every major 
athletic competition short of the Super Bowl. 
</P>
<P>
	His style and politics have helped turn the IOC from a  
bedraggled organization nearly broke to one with more than $122 
million on hand and the owner of the most prestigious sports event 
in the world. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, with reform and resuscitation of the committee's image in  
mind, Samaranch can be expected to change his tactics, too, 
becoming a more hands-on CEO. 
</P>
<P>
	Samaranch has told close friends lately that he fears a plot  
within the IOC administration to force him from office. But he 
clearly has more friends than enemies. 
</P>
<P>
	``I could not think of a better way to say the next two years  
are yours,'' Jean-Claude Killy said of the 86-2 confidence vote, 
something Samaranch had sought when the scandal broke and which 
became so much of a formality that it was almost dropped from the 
agenda. 
</P>
<P>
	Samaranch was out of the convention hall when the vote was  
taken. When he returned, he received a standing ovation. 
</P>
<P>
	Even those who were expelled would not criticize their old boss.  
</P>
<P>
	``The IOC is going through a bad moment now, but don't forget  
what Samaranch has done over the past 18 years,'' said Agustin 
Arroyo, a member from Ecuador since 1968, now and ex-member for 
accepting ski vacations and financial help for his stepdaughter. 
</P>
<P>
	Arroyo said there had been three great leaders of the modern  
Olympics -- founder Pierre de Coubertin, longtime president Avery 
Brundage and Samaranch, ``the man who spread it out to the world.''

<HEADLINE> Jags' Boselli Signs $26M Extension </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	JACKSONVILLE, Fla. (AP) -- Tony Boselli, widely considered the  
best offensive lineman in the NFL, is going to be paid like it. 
</P>
<P>
	The Jacksonville Jaguars finally made good on a promise to make  
Boselli the highest-paid offensive lineman in the NFL on Tuesday, 
agreeing to a four-year contract extension worth $26 million. 
</P>
<P>
	The All-Pro left tackle will play out two of the final three  
years of his current contract, which pays him an average of $2.5 
million per year. 
</P>
<P>
	The contract will take effect in 2001 and will keep him in  
Jacksonville through 2004, a source familiar with the negotiations 
told The Associated Press. 
</P>
<P>
	The Jaguars would not comment on the signing, but the Florida  
Times-Union and radio station WBWL in Jacksonville also reported 
the four-year extension Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's nice to be rewarded for playing at a certain level,''  
Boselli was quoted in today's Times-Union. ``I appreciate the 
commitment being made by the Jaguars.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Boselli will average $6.5 million a year under the new deal,  
surpassing tackle Orlando Brown as the highest-paid offensive 
lineman in the NFL. Last month, the Cleveland Browns signed Brown 
to a contract that averaged out to $4.5 million per year. 
</P>
<P>
	The newspaper reported that Boselli's deal included a $4 million  
signing bonus and an additional $4 million in roster bonuses to be 
paid in $2 million installments in 2002 and 2003. 
</P>
<P>
	The deal secures the player who became the cornerstone of the  
franchise in 1995, when the Jaguars used their first-ever draft 
pick to select him. 
</P>
<P>
	It also closes a contentious period that began last year when  
team owner Wayne Weaver, pressed about the possibility of 
renegotiating Boselli's contract, promised that he would ``take 
care'' of his star lineman in the near future. 
</P>
<P>
	A whole season passed with no deal and this week's NFL meetings  
in Phoenix -- where Jaguars officials met with Boselli's agent -- 
were considered a crucial period for the negotiations, with the 
team's voluntary offseason workout program set to begin March 23. 
</P>
<P>
	With Boselli's signing, the Jaguars now have the entire core of  
their offense -- quarterback Mark Brunell, receivers Jimmy Smith and 
Keenan McCardell, running back Fred Taylor and right tackle Leon 
Searcy -- in the midst of long-term deals.

<HEADLINE> Goldman Sachs Will Conduct IPO </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Goldman Sachs &AMP; Co., the last major, private  
investment bank on Wall Street, outlined plans to sell 13 percent 
of its shares to the public for as much as $3 billion to bankroll 
an expansion in an increasingly competitive industry. 
</P>
<P>
	Goldman Sachs will sell 60 million shares for between $40 and  
$50 apiece in an initial public stock offering expected in May, 
according to documents filed Tuesday with securities regulators. 
</P>
<P>
	Goldman's initial public offering stock could be the  
second-largest in history, falling just below the $4.4 billion 
Conoco Inc. sale last October, and just above the $2.9 billion 
raised by Infinity Broadcasting Corp. in December. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is going to be a very sought-after deal,'' said Linda R.  
Killian, a portfolio manager for the Renaissance IPO Plus 
Aftermarket mutual fund. 
</P>
<P>
	Goldman's partners voted earlier this month to turn the New  
York-based firm into a public company. Goldman originally planned 
to go public last year, but abandoned its plans in September after 
a market rout. 
</P>
<P>
	Both the stock market, and Goldman's balance sheet have since  
recovered. On Tuesday, the Dow Jones industrial average briefly 
traded above 10,000 for the first time ever, then retreated to 
close at 9930.47. 
</P>
<P>
	But the stock market's height could concern some potential  
investors. 
</P>
<P>
	``As an investor, I would certainly be concerned about the  
overall market at this point,'' Killian said. 
</P>
<P>
	Nevertheless, Goldman's numbers look strong.  
</P>
<P>
	Goldman Sachs on Tuesday said its profits increased 16 percent  
to $1.19 billion in its first fiscal quarter ended Feb. 26. Revenue 
jumped 21 percent to $3 billion. 
</P>
<P>
	``The firm's trading business achieved a strong performance,  
recovering significantly in the first quarter 1999 from the 
difficult conditions experienced in the second half of 1998,'' 
David A. Viniar, Goldman's chief financial officer, said in a 
statement. 
</P>
<P>
	Goldman Sachs expects to post a ``substantial'' pretax loss in  
the second quarter to cover the costs associated with its public 
offering. 
</P>
<P>
	At the price range proposed for the stock sale, Goldman Sachs  
would have a market value of between $18.7 billion and $23.4 
billion. In addition, underwriters would be allowed to sell an 
additional 9 million shares, depending on demand, which could the 
value of the deal. 
</P>
<P>
	In exchange for the capital Goldman needs to raise to grow and  
acquire other businesses, the elite and secretive firm will have to 
give up the control it has cultivated over 130 years. 
</P>
<P>
	Goldman's current partners would own 47 percent of the firm, the  
remaining employees would own 10 percent, with retired partners 
also owning 10 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Goldman's retired partners will also receive a combined $892  
million in cash and $295 million in bonds, according to the filing. 
</P>
<P>
	Japan's Sumitomo Bank Capital Markets Inc. and Kamehamea  
Activites Association, a giant landowner and education fund in 
Hawaii, plan to sell a total of 18 million shares to the public. 
</P>
<P>
	After the public offering, Sumitomo will own 22.6 million  
shares, just under 5 percent of the company. Kamehamea will hold 
21.9 million shares, also just below 5 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Goldman plans to make a $200 million charitable contribution  
following the IPO, but it was not immediately clear what form it 
would take.

<HEADLINE>  Blue Jays Fire Johnson As Manager </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DUNEDIN, Fla. (AP) -- Tim Johnson, who lied about his military  
service in Vietnam, was fired by the Blue Jays and replaced by Jim 
Fregosi today. 
</P>
<P>
	General manager Gord Ash, who hired Johnson before last season,  
said the military service controversy had become a distraction in 
preparation for the season. The Blue Jays were 3-12 in exhibition 
games. 
</P>
<P>
	Fregosi, who signed to a two-year deal, was in the Blue Jays'  
camp today. He had been with the San Francisco Giants as a special 
assistant to the general manager. 
</P>
<P>
	``I have always wanted to manage,'' he said. ``I missed the  
action, I missed the field.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Firing a manager in spring training is rare, but not  
unprecedented. Phil Cavaretta was fired by the Chicago Cubs in 
March 1954. 
</P>
<P>
	``We've got 18 games,'' Fregosi said. ``We'll be ready by  
opening day.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Johnson was unavailable for comment. He left Florida and was  
driving to see family members in Kansas. 
</P>
<P>
	Blue Jays players found out about the managing change when they  
arrived for workouts this morning. 
</P>
<P>
	``When did that happen?'' pitcher David Wells asked. ``I don't  
know what to say. Jim's a good guy.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Fregosi was in uniform for today's exhibition game against the  
Phillies in Clearwater. 
</P>
<P>
	Fregosi, with an 861-937 record with three teams, managed  
Philadelphia from 1991-96. He guided the Phillies to the World 
Series in 1993, when they lost to the Blue Jays, managed by Cito 
Gaston. 
</P>
<P>
	Fregosi, who becomes Toronto's seventh manager, began his  
managerial career with the California Angels (1978-1981) and led 
them to the playoffs against Baltimore in 1979. He then moved on to 
the Chicago White Sox (1987-1988) and the Phillies. 
</P>
<P>
	Ash said the move to change managers began last week when he met  
with the Toronto's owners and ``expressed some concern about our 
ability to move forward.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``They gave me the opportunity to examine some possibilities,''  
Ash said, and he asked the Giants for permission to talk with 
Fregosi. 
</P>
<P>
	``We talked to him a year ago (when the team was looking for a  
replacement for Gaston). As a result of that conversation, and that 
he was available, we came to the conclusion over the weekend on the 
deal.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ash said he didn't make the switch during the winter because he  
felt Johnson deserved ``the chance to have the opportunity to come 
to spring training and see if it could work.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But, according to Ash, Johnson's lies about being in combat in  
Vietnam ``wasn't going to fade into the background as quickly as I 
hoped. It became a distraction.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ash said the Blue Jays' exhibition record wasn't a factor.  
</P>
<P>
	``It didn't help but I can't say it was a component of the  
dismissal,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Ash said Johnson, fired at 1 a.m. after Toronto's 2-1 exhibition  
loss to the Yankees in Tampa had been asked to take a leave of 
absence. 
</P>
<P>
	Johnson was about to start his second year managing the American  
League team. The former U.S. Marine was Ash's hand-picked choice, 
bypassing more experienced managers such as Fregosi and Davey 
Johnson in replacing Gaston. 
</P>
<P>
	The Jays stumbled at the start, then finished strongly. But Tim  
Johnson was enveloped in controversy when it was revealed his war 
stories about Vietnam were false. A conflict with pitching coach 
Mel Queen also ensued. 
</P>
<P>
	Johnson taught mortar training to recruits going to Vietnam, but  
never served there. He made a public apology, met individually with 
reporters to discuss his problem and said he was seeking 
counseling. 
</P>
<P>
	But the issue never went away and Johnson was dogged with  
questions wherever he went. 
</P>
<P>
	``Jim Fregosi has a passion to manage with the experience,  
know-how, savvy and communications skills to make it work,'' Ash 
said. ``Jim will meet the coaching staff today, however no other 
changes are expected at this time.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Fregosi said he was looking forward to managing again.  
</P>
<P>
	``I'm excited about taking over the club,'' he said. ``(There's)  
a lot of ability here. I don't think I've been brought over in a 
youth movement. I've been brought in to win games.''

<HEADLINE> Lehto Wins Provisional Sebring Pole </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SEBRING, FLA. (AP) -- J.J. Lehto of Finland turned a lap at  
121.25 mph Wednesday to put a BMW on the provisional pole for the 
47th running of the 12 Hours at Sebring, the nation's oldest road 
race, at Sebring International Raceway. 
</P>
<P>
	Lehto's lap was the fastest turned at Sebring since Juan Fangio  
II took the pole for the event at 125.50 in 1993. It was also a 
record for the course that was reconfigured last fall to 3.7 miles. 
</P>
<P>
	Lehto and Yannick Dalmas of France gave the BMW V12 sports car  
prototype, making its world debut, the first and third spots in the 
provisional order. Final qualifications are scheduled Thursday. 
Dalmas posted a speed of 119.76. 
</P>
<P>
	Separating the teammates was Eric van de Poele of Belgium, who  
turned a lap at 120.76 for the privateer Team Rafanelli in a Riley 
&AMP; Scott Mark III with a Judd engine. 
</P>
<P>
	``I missed the first two days of testing,'' Lehto said. ``Tom  
Kristensen and Jorg Muller tested here Monday and Tuesday. I was 
here this morning but we did very little running this afternoon 
because you couldn't get a clean lap.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He was asked if there was more speed left in the car for today.  
</P>
<P>
	``Is there more left in car number zero (van de Poele)  
tomorrow?'' he replied. ``We'll have to wait and see.'' 
</P>
<P>
	For van de Poele, it was a welcome result after frenetic  
preparation. 
</P>
<P>
	``What the team has achieved is fantastic,'' he said. ``We just  
decided to enter on Jan. 31, transformed the car, changed the 
bodywork. On Feb. 27, we were testing. After two laps, I knew we 
would be competitive. But the car has never finished and we never 
underestimate the other ones.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Van de Poele will share driving with David Saelens of Belgium  
and Tomas Enge of the Czech Republic. 
</P>
<P>
	Ron Fellows of Canada, driving a Chevrolet Corvette C5R, was  
fastest in the GTS division with a lap at 108.37. Randy Pobst of 
Melbourne, Fla., was fastest in the GT class with a lap at 102.17 
in a Porsche 911 RSR.

<HEADLINE> Starbucks Suspect Denied Bond </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Carl Derick Cooper cased a Starbucks coffee  
shop hours before he allegedly shot three employees in a failed 
robbery attempt, police allege in an affidavit unsealed in court 
Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Assistant U.S. Attorney Kenneth Wainstein presented the  
affidavit from Lt. Brian Reed McAlister at a bond hearing in D.C. 
Superior Court to support three charges of felony murder while 
armed against Cooper, 29, in the July 1997 slayings. 
</P>
<P>
	McAlister, head of the special homicde investigations squad in  
the District of Columbia's police department, said in the affidavit 
that Cooper confessed in writing to shooting Emory Allen Evans, 25, 
Mary Caitrin Mahoney, 24, and Aaron David Goodrich, 18. 
</P>
<P>
	Cooper planned the robbery July 6 robbery for about a month, and  
even suggested to a friend that he participate, according to 
McAlister's affidavit. 
</P>
<P>
	``That morning he visited Starbucks in order to case it out, and  
make sure that it was doing a brisk business,'' the affidavit said. 
</P>
<P>
	Cooper said nothing during the hearing Wednesday and was ordered  
held without bond by Commissioner Pamela Young Diaz. His 
court-appointed attorney, Steven R. Kiersh, told Diaz that Cooper 
would have nothing more to say without a lawyer present. 
</P>
<P>
	At the time of the attempted robbery there was more than $10,000  
in the safe, but Cooper left the store without taking anything, the 
affidavit said. 
</P>
<P>
	It said Cooper provided to police details of his struggle with  
Mahoney, the shop's manager, over the keys to the safe. It also 
said Cooper shot the woman several times with two handguns. 
</P>
<P>
	The document also outlined what prosecutors said are Cooper's  
recollections about the shootings of the two male employees. 
</P>
<P>
	``The first gunshot dropped the black male employee (Evans) to  
the ground but did not kill him. When he continued to move and 
moan, Cooper shot him twice more in the head to put him out of his 
pain,'' the affidavit said. 
</P>
<P>
	``Once the shooting stopped, Cooper ran out of the store without  
stopping to take any money. He fled back to his home, where he 
disposed of the guns and washed the blood out of his clothes,'' 
according to the affidavit. 
</P>
<P>
	Cooper was returned to the District of Columbia Tuesday night  
from Prince George's County, Md., after waiving extradition. 
</P>
<P>
	He had been held by authorities in the suburban Maryland county  
since March 2, when he was arrested in connection with the 1996 
wounding of an off-duty Prince George's County police officer. 
Cooper is accused of shooting Officer Bruce Howard during an 
attempted robbery.

<HEADLINE> Delay Denied in NCAA Scores Case </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PHILADELPHIA (AP) -- Recruiting is the toughest part of an NCAA  
coach's job. It just got tougher. 
</P>
<P>
	U.S. District Judge Ronald Buckwalter on Tuesday turned down a  
request by the NCAA for more time to revamp its freshmen 
eligibility requirements. Buckwalter ruled last week that the 
organization could not use minimum standardized test scores to 
determine eligibility. 
</P>
<P>
	In his initial ruling, Buckwalter declared what many opponents  
of Proposition 16 had long said -- that such minimum score 
requirements ``has an unjustified disparate impact against 
African-Americans.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``It's time for us to be sensible and work with the NCAA on how  
to solve this problem,'' said former Georgetown basketball coach 
John Thompson, long a champion of minorities and those from 
underprivileged backgrounds. 
</P>
<P>
	But in denying the NCAA's request for a stay, Buckwalter  
stripped the NCAA of a key recruiting guideline that had been in 
place for over 15 years. The NCAA said it needed more time to form 
new requirements and file appeals. 
</P>
<P>
	NCAA officials said they would ask for another stay this week  
from the 3rd Circuit of the U.S. Court of Appeals; it also plans to 
appeal the initial ruling. 
</P>
<P>
	NCAA counsel David Bruton told the judge that ``chaos'' and  
``irreparable harm'' could occur without a stay since each of the 
302 Division I schools could institute a wide range of new freshman 
eligibility requirements. 
</P>
<P>
	Also, schools currently playing in the men's and women's NCAA  
basketball tournament could add freshman players to their rosters 
although they initially were ruled academically ineligible. 
</P>
<P>
	St. Joseph's athletic director Don DiJulia called the current  
situation a ``nightmare. 
</P>
<P>
	``We had rules nine days ago and now we have none. If we had to  
make a recruiting call to a senior in high school tonight and he 
asks `What standards do I meet?' I'm blank on the other end of the 
phone,'' DiJulia said. 
</P>
<P>
	Members of the Division I Board of Directors will meet in the  
next few weeks to decide how to proceed next, NCAA president Cedric 
Dempsey said. 
</P>
<P>
	``With the court's denial of our request for a stay, our  
membership is left with many unknowns about how to address 
eligibility standards,'' Dempsey said. 
</P>
<P>
	In the eight-page opinion, Buckwalter said the NCAA should have  
no problem creating new rules. 
</P>
<P>
	``After almost 100 years of administering intercollegiate  
athletics, the establishment of any prospective initial eligibility 
rule and the policing of its own members is a task the NCAA is more 
than well-equipped to handle,'' Buckwalter wrote. 
</P>
<P>
	Attorneys for the four black athletes who filed the suit said  
the NCAA should concentrate on adopting nondiscriminatory 
eligibility policies than continue fighting in court. 
</P>
<P>
	``What the NCAA is doing is trying to protect them from  
themselves,'' said Andre Dennis, lead attorney for the four 
plaintiffs. 
</P>
<P>
	The plaintiffs have since graduated or are no longer freshmen in  
college. They claimed they were denied NCAA scholarships or sports 
eligibility because they did not meet the minimum test score. 
</P>
<P>
	Under Proposition 16, the association required freshmen athletes  
to have a high-school diploma and a minimum grade-point average in 
13 core academic courses with the GPA contingent on an indexed, 
sliding scale with a student's score on either the Scholastic 
Assessment Test or American College Test. 
</P>
<P>
	However, students scoring less than 820 on the SAT, or 16 on the  
ACT, could not participate, regardless of their other academic 
credentials. 
</P>
<P>
	Buckwalter's ruling on Proposition 16 only struck down using  
such tests as minimum requirements, but did not outlaw altogether 
the use of standardized tests, which many educators have long said 
are racially and culturally discriminatory. The rule's forerunner, 
Proposition 48, resulted from a tumultuous NCAA convention in 1983 
when a group of reform-minded school presidents began pushing for 
toughened academic requirements. 
</P>
<P>
	The NCAA has said the earliest it could establish new guidelines  
is October, since it has to consult its member schools before 
instituting new rules. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm concerned that we are going to eliminate all kinds of  
standards,'' said Penn State football coach Joe Paterno, a 
supporter of Proposition 16. ``Then it is not a question of whether 
you're going to get anything out of college, it is a question of 
how can you dunk a basketball.''

	ONLINE VS. TRADITIONAL RETAILERS: Millions of people are now  
shopping via the Internet because of the convenience online 
merchants offer, but the more traditional forms of retailing -- 
stores and catalogs -- still have an edge over Web sites. Greenfield 
Online, a marketing research firm, surveyed nearly 1,300 Internet 
users and asked them what they liked about stores, catalog and 
online. Sixty-nine percent said that in a store or mall, you can 
see, feel or try out clothes or other merchandise before you buy. 
Twenty-five percent loved the instant gratification -- you see that 
CD or shirt, and you can have it right away. The best thing about 
catalogs is that they're fun to leaf through. But online shopping 
is ahead of traditional retailers by making it easy to compare 
prices and to shop any time of the day. 

</P>
<P>
	BUT IT WON'T NECESSARILY SAVE YOU FROM GOING TO JAIL: There's a  
new game token being packed inside Monopoly sets, and this one is 
most appropriate, considering the cutthroat buying and selling that 
goes on during the board game -- it's a sack of money. Hasbro 
announced that it was adding the new token, the first for Monopoly 
games since the early 1950s, to packages being shipped this month. 
It joins 10 other tokens, which include a battleship, cannon, dog, 
horse and rider, iron, race car, shoe, thimble, top hat and 
wheelbarrow. The very first Monopoly sets produced in 1935 had no 
tokens; the inventor suggested players use buttons or other small 
household items. The sack of money was introduced, appropriately 
enough, on Tuesday, the day the Dow industrials briefly rose above 
10,000 for the first time ever.

<P>
	ADVICE FOR OLDER JOB-SEEKERS: If you're over 50 and out of work,  
you'll have a better chance of landing a job if you can come across 
as creative and aggressive. Steve Harrison, who's 60 and president 
of the employment firm Lee Hecht Harrison, says executives over 50 
can appear out of date and less vital than younger counterparts. 
While you can't change your age, if you keep up with the latest 
business thinking and technologies, and can show a prospective 
employer you have a passion for life, you can have a vibrant image, 
Harrison says. Older job seekers ``have to project energy, agility 
and a sense of urgency,'' he says.

<HEADLINE> House Seeks To Restructure FCC </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The federal agency that wields the most power  
over the nation's television and telephone systems is being 
targeted by key House lawmakers for a makeover. 
</P>
<P>
	Rep. Billy Tauzin, R-La., chairman of the House Commerce  
telecommunications subcommittee, which has jurisdiction over the 
Federal Communications Commission, is leading the overhaul effort 
to make sure the agency, created in 1934, can meet the challenges 
of the fast-changing telecommunications business. 
</P>
<P>
	Tauzin's panel was holding the first in a series of hearings on  
the matter today. 
</P>
<P>
	``We need to fundamentally restructure the agency and develop a  
21st century model that works in a high-tech global economy,'' 
Tauzin said. 
</P>
<P>
	Tauzin, who doesn't have a detailed plan yet, wants to revamp  
both the FCC's structure and its mission to focus more on enforcing 
existing regulations rather than creating new ones. He hopes to 
produce a bill by June to overhaul the FCC. 
</P>
<P>
	FCC Chairman Bill Kennard doesn't have a final plan either, but  
wants to work with lawmakers to restructure the agency to make it 
run more effectively into the 21st century. 
</P>
<P>
	Kennard today gave lawmakers a five-year plan, subject to  
revisions, for reorganizing the FCC internally along functional 
rather than technological lines, as well as putting greater 
emphasis on enforcement and phasing out regulations as competition 
for telephone services develops. 
</P>
<P>
	``In five years, the FCC should be dramatically changed,''  
Kennard said. 
</P>
<P>
	Kennard would like to have a final plan by the fall, parts of  
which the FCC could implement on its own with other parts that 
would require congressional action. 
</P>
<P>
	Republicans in the GOP-controlled Congress have criticized the  
FCC for being too regulatory, particularly in its implementation of 
a 1996 law freeing cable, local and long-distance companies to get 
into each other's businesses. But it's not clear whether any 
measure to overhaul the FCC could pass Congress and be signed into 
law. 
</P>
<P>
	Rep. John Dingell of Michigan, senior Democrat on the Commerce  
Committee and a frequent critic of the FCC and its implementation 
of the law, blasted the agency. He said his overhaul efforts ``will 
be guided by the need for accountability by an agency that I 
believe is out of control.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Another key Democrat, Rep Edward Markey of Massachusetts, said  
radically restructuring the FCC ``would be counterproductive'' and 
gave the agency high marks for implementing the 1996 law. 
</P>
<P>
	Tauzin, meanwhile, has raised interest in trying to limit the  
FCC's authority to review mergers. 
</P>
<P>
	But Kennard has defended continuing the FCC's authority in this  
area because the agency considers factors that antitrust regulators 
don't. For instance, the FCC can examine how a media merger affects 
the diversity of viewpoints and programming on the nation's 
airwaves or whether a telephone merger is consistent with laws 
ensuring that poor people have affordable phone service, Kennard 
has said. 
</P>
<P>
	The Justice Department or the Federal Trade Commission conducts  
antitrust reviews on mergers involving telecommunications companies 
to determine whether they would be good for competition and 
consumers. 
</P>
<P>
	The FCC has a broader legal standard involving the public  
interest, which can include antitrust considerations.

<HEADLINE>  NCAA Asks Judge To Delay SAT Ruling </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PHILADELPHIA (AP) -- The NCAA asked a federal judge today to  
delay enforcement of a ruling that would prevent college athletics' 
national governing body from using minimum standardized test scores 
to determine freshman eligibility. 
</P>
<P>
	In asking for a stay from U.S. District Judge Ronald Buckwalter  
in Philadelphia, the NCAA said that immediately taking the 
eligibility requirements off the books could cause chaos among its 
302 Division I schools who would suddenly be without a critical 
recruiting guideline. 
</P>
<P>
	Buckwalter, who ordered the end to the NCAA's Proposition 16  
last week, may rule on the request for a stay as early as Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	``Because the number of spots available for recruiting and  
athletic scholarships are limited, the rules of the game are 
knocked out,'' NCAA counsel David Bruton said in court Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	``Those most at risk are those who are qualifiers and  
academically eligible, but are threatened by'' more 
athletically-talented students who cannot fulfill academic 
requirements, Bruton added. 
</P>
<P>
	Lawyers for the four plaintiffs who filed the suit disputed the  
claim. 
</P>
<P>
	``The NCAA is saying the sky is falling, and it's not falling,''  
said Andre Dennis, the lead attorney for the plaintiffs. ``There's 
every reason for the court to continue the injunction as it 
exists.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Under Proposition 16, the association required freshmen athletes  
to have a high school diploma and a minimum grade-point average in 
13 core academic courses, with the GPA contingent on an indexed, 
sliding scale with a student's score on either the Scholastic 
Assessment Test or American College Test. 
</P>
<P>
	However, students scoring less than 820 on the SAT, or 16 on the  
ACT, could not participate, regardless of their other academic 
credentials. 
</P>
<P>
	Both sides agree that any reform must be instituted by the NCAA  
and not leave individual schools to make up their own guidelines, 
said both an NCAA lawyer and the foster father of a college track 
athlete who filed the suit. 
</P>
<P>
	``We need some time for an orderly position and (to) put new  
guidelines in place,'' said NCAA general counsel Elsa Cole. ``If 
everything went smoothly, we might have new (guidelines) by 
October.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Robert Massie, the foster father of one of the plaintiffs,  
University of Miami track athlete Leatrice Shaw, said the ruling 
``is for all future people going to school.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But with no general guidelines in place, ``it's a crapshoot now,  
because a school can just use an athlete and kick him to the 
curb,'' said Massie, a track coach at Simon Gratz High School in 
Philadelphia. He criticized the NCAA for not having alternatives 
already in place. 
</P>
<P>
	Buckwalter's ruling over Proposition 16 did not limit the use of  
standardized tests, which many educators have long said are 
racially and culturally discriminatory. Its forerunner, Proposition 
48, resulted from an NCAA convention in 1983 when a group of 
reform-minded school presidents began pushing for toughened 
academic requirements.

<HEADLINE>  Blue Jays Fire Johnson As Manager </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DUNEDIN, Fla. (AP) -- Tim Johnson, who lied about his military  
service in Vietnam, was fired by the Blue Jays and replaced by Jim 
Fregosi today. 
</P>
<P>
	General manager Gord Ash, who hired Johnson before last season,  
said the military service controversy had become a distraction in 
preparation for the season. The Blue Jays were 3-12 in exhibition 
games. 
</P>
<P>
	Fregosi, who signed to a two-year deal, was in the Blue Jays'  
camp today. He had been with the San Francisco Giants as a special 
assistant to the general manager. 
</P>
<P>
	``I have always wanted to manage,'' he said. ``I missed the  
action, I missed the field.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Firing a manager in spring training is rare, but not  
unprecedented. Phil Cavaretta was fired by the Chicago Cubs in 
March 1954. 
</P>
<P>
	``We've got 18 games,'' Fregosi said. ``We'll be ready by  
opening day.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Johnson was unavailable for comment. He left Florida and was  
driving to see family members in Kansas. 
</P>
<P>
	Blue Jays players found out about the managing change when they  
arrived for workouts this morning. 
</P>
<P>
	``When did that happen?'' pitcher David Wells asked. ``I don't  
know what to say. Jim's a good guy.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Fregosi was in uniform for today's exhibition game against the  
Phillies in Clearwater. 
</P>
<P>
	Fregosi, with an 861-937 record with three teams, managed  
Philadelphia from 1991-96. He guided the Phillies to the World 
Series in 1993, when they lost to the Blue Jays, managed by Cito 
Gaston. 
</P>
<P>
	Fregosi, who becomes Toronto's seventh manager, began his  
managerial career with the California Angels (1978-1981) and led 
them to the playoffs against Baltimore in 1979. He then moved on to 
the Chicago White Sox (1987-1988) and the Phillies. 
</P>
<P>
	Ash said the move to change managers began last week when he met  
with the Toronto's owners and ``expressed some concern about our 
ability to move forward.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``They gave me the opportunity to examine some possibilities,''  
Ash said, and he asked the Giants for permission to talk with 
Fregosi. 
</P>
<P>
	``We talked to him a year ago (when the team was looking for a  
replacement for Gaston). As a result of that conversation, and that 
he was available, we came to the conclusion over the weekend on the 
deal.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ash said he didn't make the switch during the winter because he  
felt Johnson deserved ``the chance to have the opportunity to come 
to spring training and see if it could work.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But, according to Ash, Johnson's lies about being in combat in  
Vietnam ``wasn't going to fade into the background as quickly as I 
hoped. It became a distraction.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ash said the Blue Jays' exhibition record wasn't a factor.  
</P>
<P>
	``It didn't help but I can't say it was a component of the  
dismissal,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Ash said Johnson, fired at 1 a.m. after Toronto's 2-1 exhibition  
loss to the Yankees in Tampa had been asked to take a leave of 
absence. 
</P>
<P>
	Johnson was about to start his second year managing the American  
League team. The former U.S. Marine was Ash's hand-picked choice, 
bypassing more experienced managers such as Fregosi and Davey 
Johnson in replacing Gaston. 
</P>
<P>
	The Jays stumbled at the start, then finished strongly. But Tim  
Johnson was enveloped in controversy when it was revealed his war 
stories about Vietnam were false. A conflict with pitching coach 
Mel Queen also ensued. 
</P>
<P>
	Johnson taught mortar training to recruits going to Vietnam, but  
never served there. He made a public apology, met individually with 
reporters to discuss his problem and said he was seeking 
counseling. 
</P>
<P>
	But the issue never went away and Johnson was dogged with  
questions wherever he went. 
</P>
<P>
	``Jim Fregosi has a passion to manage with the experience,  
know-how, savvy and communications skills to make it work,'' Ash 
said. ``Jim will meet the coaching staff today, however no other 
changes are expected at this time.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Fregosi said he was looking forward to managing again.  
</P>
<P>
	``I'm excited about taking over the club,'' he said. ``(There's)  
a lot of ability here. I don't think I've been brought over in a 
youth movement. I've been brought in to win games.''

<HEADLINE> Olympic Scuffle Said No Big Deal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LAUSANNE, Switzerland (AP) -- There was shouting. There was  
cursing. There was the bizarre scene of a leader of world sports 
striking a martial-arts pose against one of his colleagues. 
</P>
<P>
	But the three International Olympic Committee officials involved  
in the confrontation at their headquarters said Wednesday it really 
was no big deal. 
</P>
<P>
	Witnesses said executive board member Kim Un-yong was involved  
in a shouting match Tuesday with Francois Carrard, the IOC's 
director general, during a break in a meeting. 
</P>
<P>
	The exchange included loud words and profanity, the witnesses  
said. At one point, Kim, the South Korean president of the 
International Taekwondo Federation, took a wide-legged, fists-up 
combat stance, which sent Carrard fleeing, according to the 
witness, who spoke on the condition of anonymity. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm in great shape,'' Carrard said when asked about the  
confrontation. ``There was a minor incident. I'm physically very 
fit.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The witnesses said Pound then stepped in and helped calm Kim  
down. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a brief incident,'' Pound said. ``It's now behind us.''  
</P>
<P>
	No punches were thrown and Kim later apologized to both Carrard  
and Pound. 
</P>
<P>
	Kim, who remains under investigation by Pound's IOC corruption  
panel for alleged involvement in the Salt Lake bribery scandal, 
said little about Tuesday's showdown. 
</P>
<P>
	``I have nothing more to elaborate on,'' he said.  
</P>
<P>
	Executive board member Jacques Rogge, also a member of Pound's  
task force, said the standoff had nothing to do with the 
investigation, although he did not say what sparked it.

<HEADLINE> Intel Promises To Share Technology </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The government said today that Intel Corp.  
promised as part of its antitrust settlement to share important 
technical details with other companies about its computer chips in 
all except rare circumstances. 
</P>
<P>
	But in a significant legal victory for Intel, the government  
didn't require the company to acknowledge that it holds monopoly 
power over the microprocessor market. The industry's largest 
chip-maker, Intel's products run roughly 85 percent of the world's 
personal computers. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was critical to settlement,'' said Tom Dunlap, Intel's  
general counsel. ``We absolutely would not agree we have market 
power or anything else.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Federal Trade Commission announced terms of the settlement  
today, which commissioners approved 3-0 with Orson Swindle not 
voting for health reasons. Although the agreement with Intel was 
announced last week, details were so closely guarded at the time 
that it was unclear what concessions the government had won. 
</P>
<P>
	Craig Barrett, Intel's chief executive officer, said today that  
he was ``very gratified'' the company reached the agreement with 
the FTC, adding that it ``provides a framework for resolving future 
intellectual property disputes with our customers.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Under the settlement, Intel agrees to share important  
information about upcoming processors with other companies unless 
those firms don't pay Intel as agreed, or unless they sue Intel and 
ask a judge to enjoin it from manufacturing its chips. 
</P>
<P>
	``The threat of an injunction would seem an extremely drastic  
threat to Intel, so the logic is, this gives them the ability to 
fight back,'' said William Kovacic, an antitrust expert at George 
Washington University. 
</P>
<P>
	Intel also will not be obligated to continue sharing information  
about its chips with businesses that broke promises to keep the 
details confidential, or with businesses that might use the 
information to design rival microprocessors. 
</P>
<P>
	The FTC's decision to settle the case is its most significant  
affecting the nation's burgeoning high-tech industry since it 
deadlocked 2-2 in 1993 and decided not to sue Microsoft Corp. over 
alleged antitrust violations. 
</P>
<P>
	``The heart of the commission's complaint against Intel was the  
principle that a monopolist cannot withhold products or information 
about products in order to retaliate against customers who find 
themselves in intellectual property disputes,'' FTC Chairman Robert 
Pitofsky said today. 
</P>
<P>
	He said the settlement will ``fully resolve ... competitive  
concerns without interfering with Intel's legitimate business 
activities.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In its lawsuit, filed in June, the government had alleged that  
Intel illegally withheld from three companies advanced technical 
details about new chips to ``extort'' valuable technology that the 
companies had developed independently and for which they had 
secured patents. 
</P>
<P>
	``Giving up the right to seek an injunction isn't giving up very  
much,'' said Kevin Arquit, an antitrust lawyer in New York. 
``Companies want their intellectual property to be used, they just 
want to be paid for it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The government did not require Intel to make any admission that  
it wields monopoly power, a concession that could have been used 
against Intel in future lawsuits. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's important not to make that admission,'' said Warren  
Grimes, a former FTC staff attorney who now teaches antitrust law 
at Southwestern University in Los Angeles. ``It would make it 
easier for private parties to bring private lawsuits against 
them.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But Richard Parker, the lead lawyer for the case in the FTC's  
Bureau of Competition, said the settlement imposes requirements on 
Intel that clearly signal its power over the technology industry, 
even without any admission it is a monopolist. 
</P>
<P>
	``While they're not agreeing to it, those kinds of obligations  
wouldn't apply to anybody without market power,'' Parker said 
today. ``We're setting rules for what a dominant firm has to do.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Last week's settlement does not affect a broader investigation  
of Intel the FTC launched in September 1997. That probe is widely 
believed to be looking into Intel's business relating to computer 
motherboards and graphics technology. 
</P>
<P>
	In its original lawsuit, the FTC asked that Intel be ordered to  
stop discriminating against or threatening any company over the 
sale of its microprocessors or sharing information about its 
technology. It also wanted Intel to ``take such other measures that 
are appropriate to correct or remedy, or prevent the recurrence of, 
(its) anti-competitive practices.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The government had called Intel's actions ``a raw exercise of  
monopoly power to muscle competitors into signing over intellectual 
property rights.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Intel had already acknowledged it did most of what the FTC  
alleged but said its practices did not violate federal antitrust 
laws. It argued that companies have a legal right to decide what 
secrets to disclose to customers about upcoming products.

<HEADLINE> Court Orders MOMA To Turn Art Over </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Two paintings loaned to the Museum of Modern Art  
must be handed over to a grand jury investigating whether the works 
were stolen by Nazis during World War II. 
</P>
<P>
	The state Supreme Court's Appellate Division on Tuesday reversed  
a lower court ruling that said the museum did not have to obey a 
grand jury subpoena and could return the two paintings to Vienna, 
Austria. 
</P>
<P>
	But prosecutors say the paintings were stolen from Jewish owners  
at the start of World War II and want them to remain here until 
ownership is sorted out. 
</P>
<P>
	The paintings -- ``Dead City III'' and ``Portrait of Wally'' by  
Austrian Egon Schiele -- are worth about $2 million each. They were 
on loan from the Leopold Foundation for a three-month exhibit that 
ended in January 1998. 
</P>
<P>
	City prosecutors obtained a subpoena demanding the paintings be  
turned over to a grand jury for inspection after heirs to the 
owners complained. 
</P>
<P>
	The heirs said ``Portrait of Wally'' was stolen from Lea Jaray  
Bondi as she fled her home and that ``Dead City III'' was stolen 
from Fritz Grunbaum before his death in the Dachau concentration 
camp. 
</P>
<P>
	The museum moved to quash the subpoena, citing a state law that  
bars ``any kind of seizure'' of art loaned to New York 
institutions. An acting state Supreme Court justice granted the 
motion, but the appeals court said the subpoena was not authorizing 
a ``seizure.'' Rather, the paintings were being brought before the 
court as physical evidence.

	Under Proposition 16, the association required freshmen athletes  
to have a high school diploma and a minimum grade-point average in 
13 core academic courses, with the GPA contingent on an indexed, 
sliding scale with a student's score on either the Scholastic 
Assessment Test or American College Test. 
</P>
<P>
	However, students scoring less than 820 on the SAT, or 16 on the  
ACT, could not participate, regardless of their other academic 
credentials. 
</P>
<P>
	Both sides agree that any reform must be instituted by the NCAA  
and not leave individual schools to make up their own guidelines, 
said both an NCAA lawyer and the foster father of a college track 
athlete who filed the suit. 
</P>
<P>
	``We need some time for an orderly position and (to) put new  
guidelines in place,'' said NCAA general counsel Elsa Cole. ``If 
everything went smoothly, we might have new (guidelines) by 
October.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Robert Massie, the foster father of one of the plaintiffs,  
University of Miami track athlete Leatrice Shaw, said the ruling 
``is for all future people going to school.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But with no general guidelines in place, ``it's a crapshoot now,  
because a school can just use an athlete and kick him to the 
curb,'' said Massie, a track coach at Simon Gratz High School in 
Philadelphia. He criticized the NCAA for not having alternatives 
already in place. 
</P>
<P>
	Buckwalter's ruling over Proposition 16 did not limit the use of  
standardized tests, which many educators have long said are 
racially and culturally discriminatory. Its forerunner, Proposition 
48, resulted from an NCAA convention in 1983 when a group of 
reform-minded school presidents began pushing for toughened 
academic requirements.

<HEADLINE> News Chat in Post-Monica World </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- ``Monica's Parents: Caught in the Crossfire or  
Clueless in California?'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Clinton Tell-Alls: Tell me More, or Enough Already?''  
</P>
<P>
	``Monica's Remorse: Truly Sorry, or Crocodile Tears?''  
</P>
<P>
	Tasty, zesty, spicy. These topics for discussion served up  
during the past few weeks on MSNBC's daily ``News Chat'' talk show 
are the television equivalent of comfort food. 
</P>
<P>
	While not a particularly nourishing form of public discourse,  
``News Chat'' exists on a reassuring level for those who don't like 
to be challenged by shades of gray. There's no middle ground. It's 
always one way or the other. Yes or no. Right or wrong. Sane or 
crazy. 
</P>
<P>
	Questions don't take more than 15 seconds to address, since  
that's the limit for call-in participants on the ``News Chat'' 
equivalent of a basketball shot clock that counts down at the 
bottom of the screen. 
</P>
<P>
	Oh, and it helps to shout your answer.  
</P>
<P>
	``MSNBC's Future: Meaty News, or Tabloid Talk Sleaze?''  
</P>
<P>
	Sorry. That's not a real topic.  
</P>
<P>
	It might as well be. The clock is running on MSNBC, too. The  
Lewinsky saga's end has laid bare the cable network's identity 
crisis. 
</P>
<P>
	Its aggressive rival, Fox News Channel, has recently eclipsed  
MSNBC in the ratings during prime-time for the first time. One 
attempt to turn things around, a nightly political roundtable by 
John McLaughlin, ended embarrassingly in six weeks when McLaughlin 
decided he wasn't up to the grind. 
</P>
<P>
	MSNBC's philosophy has been to take the day's hot story, the  
water-cooler topic, and talk it into the ground. But now that the 
conversation has cooled and people are back at their desks, 
thinking of other things besides sex in the White House, MSNBC 
doesn't know what to say. 
</P>
<P>
	So the network gropes for direction, particularly during the  
daytime hours. Katie Couric and Matt Lauer should seek residuals 
since MSNBC, with apparently little else to do, relentlessly reruns 
their ``Today'' show interviews. 
</P>
<P>
	At 5 p.m. each weekday, those identity problems disappear.  
``News Chat'' may be a lot of things -- loud, opinionated and 
occasionally moronic -- but it knows what it is. It's a path that 
points toward more talk and less news. MSNBC's dilemma is whether 
to continue down that path. 
</P>
<P>
	``My job is to harangue the last person who spoke, whatever they  
said,'' John Gibson, the show's ringmaster, explained over lunch 
one day recently. ``I'm supposed to be the ultimate contrarian.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Gibson has ideal credentials for this quintessential late 1990s  
job: a veteran of local television in California, his big break 
came in covering O.J. Simpson's murder trial, where he caught 
Geraldo Rivera's eye and appeared almost nightly on Rivera's CNBC 
show. 
</P>
<P>
	Each night, Gibson plays his role to the hilt. He pokes, he  
prods and listens to opinionated viewers with a look of sheer 
bemusement. He'll throw up his hands in frustration or dismiss 
someone with a get-outta-here wave. 
</P>
<P>
	``News Chat'' is centered around the question of the day, which  
doesn't necessarily have to be about Monica. Gibson begins his 
workday around 10:30 a.m. on the phone with producers, trying to 
pin down the topic. 
</P>
<P>
	It has to be prominent in the news, percolating enough so  
viewers know something about it and have developed clear opinions. 
There has to be a stark either-or way of looking at it. 
</P>
<P>
	``Believe it or not, these questions take a lot of time, as  
mindless as they seem,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition to the call-in remarks, the shows feature Internet  
correspondents who collect and read online commentary sent in by 
viewers, not forgetting the ``Microsoft'' in MSNBC. 
</P>
<P>
	On ``News Chat'' and ``Inter Night,'' which immediately follows  
it, Gibson said he's there to encourage the sort of behavior you 
wouldn't want to see around the dinner table. ``Inter Night'' 
differs primarily in that it usually features outside experts 
arguing instead of call-in viewers. 
</P>
<P>
	``The difference between the two shows is like the difference  
between amateur and professional wrestling,'' Gibson said, ignoring 
the icy stare of a publicist sitting across the table. 
</P>
<P>
	Gibson knows, ultimately, that it's so much hot air. He doesn't  
take himself too seriously, either. ``I'm not Charlie Rose,'' he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	If only everyone at MSNBC were that comfortable with what  
they're doing. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is television for people who like to engage themselves  
emotionally in the news, who like to feel sympathy, who like to get 
enraged, who like to scream at the TV,'' he said. ``It's a lot 
different than a newscast.''

<HEADLINE> $3B Left Unspent From Welfare Funds </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The states have amassed approximately $3  
billion in unspent federal welfare money, but say they need to save 
the money in case of an economic downturn and to provide special 
services to people who need it most. 
</P>
<P>
	Under the overhaul approved in 1996, the federal government  
gives the states a set amount each year to take care of its poor 
rather than pay for each person who needs public assistance -- no 
matter the cost -- as it did for 61 years. 
</P>
<P>
	The House Ways and Means Committee said Monday in a statement  
that states have a total of $6.2 billion in unspent welfare money, 
but that counts funds states have already obligated for specific 
payments. Counting only unobligated money, the total is just over 
$3 billion. 
</P>
<P>
	``The next phase of welfare reform is the key to permanently  
lifting more families from poverty and giving them opportunities 
for brighter futures,'' Rep. Nancy L. Johnson, R-Conn., chairwoman 
of the committee's welfare panel, said in a statement. 
</P>
<P>
	Johnson released a report by the Congressional Research Service  
detailing the unspent money. 
</P>
<P>
	Republicans argue that states have enough money without new  
spending proposed by President Clinton. In his budget, Clinton 
seeks billions of dollars to provide more child care and to offer 
job training for those hardest to remove from the welfare rolls, 
which have been cut by nearly a third since 1996. 
</P>
<P>
	``We'd like to understand the president's reasoning, especially  
in light of the fact that they'll get another $16.5 billion next 
year,'' said Ways and Means spokesman Trent Duffy. 
</P>
<P>
	House Budget Committee Chairman John Kasich, R-Ohio, has said he  
will propose letting states use welfare money for education because 
caseloads have dropped so fast. 
</P>
<P>
	State welfare balances vary widely. New York has the most  
unspent money -- $689 million, and Pennsylvania is No. 2 with $245 
million. But many states have nothing left over, including Alaska, 
Connecticut, Delaware, Illinois, Maine, Oregon, Virginia and 
Wyoming.

<HEADLINE> Kodak Applauds IOC Actions </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Olympic sponsor Eastman Kodak Co. applauded the  
IOC on Wednesday for its first steps toward addressing a major 
corruption scandal. 
</P>
<P>
	But other major Olympic sponsors including Coca-Cola Co.,  
McDonald's Corp. and John Hancock Mutual Life Insurance Co. 
declined comment on the decision by the International Olympic 
Committee to expel six members, reserving judgment until the 
two-day session ends. 
</P>
<P>
	The IOC, meeting in Lausanne, Switzerland, ousted the six for  
taking hundreds of thousands of dollars from officials in Salt Lake 
City, which was awarded the 2002 Winter Games. 
</P>
<P>
	Several sponsors indicated privately they were more interested  
in what the IOC does to change its procedures to prevent similar 
situations in awarding future hosts of the games. 
</P>
<P>
	The companies are worried the scandal has damaged the value of  
being a global sponsor of the games. They pay $40 million and more 
for the right to market themselves as official Olympic sponsors for 
a four-year period. 
</P>
<P>
	``Basically from the onset, we have been telling the IOC to go  
deep and go wide in their investigations and it appears they are 
now doing that,'' said John LaBella, a spokesman for Eastman Kodak, 
the photographic products concern based in Rochester, N.Y. 
</P>
<P>
	Kodak has been sponsoring the Olympics in various forms for  
about 100 years, LaBella said, and is in talks about continuing as 
a sponsor for the games in Salt Lake City in 2002 and in Athens, 
Greece, in 2004. 
</P>
<P>
	Debra Gottheimer, spokeswoman for Olympic sponsor International  
Business Machines Corp., said Wednesday's actions by the IOC ``are 
the first steps in the process.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Reform is not going to happen overnight. There needs to be a  
long-term commitment and we will see how that evolves. We will 
continue to watch closely,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	IBM has been an Olympic sponsor since 1960, but announced last  
summer it would not renew after the Sydney Games in 2000.

<HEADLINE> Colo. Sees Lesbian Custody Battle </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	GOLDEN, Colo. (AP) -- Like many children, a 9-year-old girl in  
Golden divides her time between two parents who no longer share a 
home. 
</P>
<P>
	Unlike most, she calls one parent ``Mom'' and the other  
``Nana.'' 
</P>
<P>
	It's an unusual family situation that is bound by an even more  
unusual court order requiring Kelly Cunningham, or ``Mom,'' and 
Leanne Bueker, or ``Nana,'' to share custody of the girl in 
Colorado. 
</P>
<P>
	The case, which has been hailed by gay rights advocates as a  
landmark custody ruling, was scheduled to go back to county court 
today. Judge Christopher Munch must decide whether Ms. Cunningham 
may take the child to Albany, N.Y., to create a family with her new 
husband, Michael Naylor. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Cunningham has contended the joint custody order has denied  
her daughter the opportunity to live in a stable, loving 
environment. Ms. Bueker claimed it is in the best interest of the 
girl to remain in Colorado, where both women may play an active 
role in her life. 
</P>
<P>
	A telephone message seeking comment from Ms. Cunningham's  
attorney was not returned, and Ms. Bueker's current attorney 
declined comment. But Mara Pawlowski, who represented Ms. Bueker 
until recently, said the key is the finding the best interest of 
the child. 
</P>
<P>
	``This child is a very bright, gifted child who does not want to  
move to New York,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Cunningham and Ms. Bueker began a relationship and moved in  
together in 1987. They decided the next year to have a child, 
according to court records, and Ms. Cunningham was artificially 
inseminated. 
</P>
<P>
	Her daughter was born in July 1989. Seven years later, Ms.  
Cunningham, a computer programmer, informed Ms. Bueker that she had 
met Naylor through the Internet, fallen in love and wanted to 
pursue a relationship. 
</P>
<P>
	The women separated and Ms. Bueker, a mortgage banking  
supervisor, sued for custody even though she was not listed on the 
birth certificate and did not adopt the girl legally. 
</P>
<P>
	Court records indicate the child loved both women equally and  
feared losing one through the breakup. 
</P>
<P>
	Last year, Jefferson County District Judge Frank Plaut awarded  
the two women joint custody, calling Ms. Cunningham the girl's 
``biological'' mother and Ms. Bueker the ``psychological'' mother. 
</P>
<P>
	He based the decision on a state law granting custody rights to  
an unrelated person who has had physical custody of a child for at 
least six months prior to a separation. 
</P>
<P>
	Plaut also said the girl should remain in Colorado, where she  
could be nurtured by both women. 
</P>
<P>
	The decision was one of a handful nationwide in which a court  
has legally recognized a family with parents of the same sex, said 
Kate Kendell, executive director of the National Center for Lesbian 
Rights. 
</P>
<P>
	In the past five years, the number of lesbian custody cases  
nationwide has grown from three to as many as 15 a year, she said. 
Custody is awarded the biological parent in about 70 percent of 
those cases. 
</P>
<P>
	``The most important issue is that this family be treated by the  
court in the same way the court would treat a heterosexual-headed 
household with the very same issues presented,'' Kendell said.

<HEADLINE> U.N.: Protect Indian Sites in U.S. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	GENEVA (AP) -- Laws and attitudes in the United States should  
take greater account of the beliefs and traditions of American 
Indians, a U.N. investigator into religious intolerance said in a 
report published Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Abdelfattah Amor said after a 15-day study trip to the United  
States that the country was generally open to all religions, but 
said there was a need to protect sacred Indian sites. 
</P>
<P>
	``It is essential to make society and the whole of the  
administrative and political apparatus aware of the indigenous 
peoples' religions and spiritual beliefs,'' said Amor, a Tunisian. 
</P>
<P>
	Amor went to Mount Graham, Ariz., where telescopes are being  
constructed by the University of Arizona on a site sacred to some 
members of the San Carlos Apache tribe. He also visited an area of 
northern Arizona claimed by both the Navajo and Hopi tribes. 
</P>
<P>
	Amor said Indians carrying ceremonial instruments and objects  
were sometimes arrested at borders, Indian prisoners had religious 
practices banned for security reasons and some Indian children were 
made to cut their hair by schools. 
</P>
<P>
	Among minority religions in the United States, Jews were  
``satisfied with their lot as a whole,'' Amor said. There were more 
problems for Muslims, he said, accusing some segments of the media 
of displaying racial and religious intolerance. 
</P>
<P>
	The report will be discussed during the six-week meeting of the  
U.N. Human Rights Commission, which begins in Geneva on Monday.

<HEADLINE> Democrats Assail Bankruptcy Bill </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Some Democratic lawmakers, including the head  
of a House caucus on children's issues, are assailing bipartisan 
legislation that would make it tougher for people to erase their 
debts in bankruptcy court. 
</P>
<P>
	The Democrats' assault Tuesday reignited a debate over the  
welfare of single mothers and their children, in which Hillary 
Rodham Clinton played a key role last year. 
</P>
<P>
	The White House threatened in 1998 to veto a House-passed  
bankruptcy overhaul bill and the Senate adjourned without voting on 
the measure. Mrs. Clinton, along with consumer groups and some 
Democrats, complained that the bill would make single mothers and 
children who are owed support by bankrupt fathers take a back seat 
to credit card companies in collecting debts. 
</P>
<P>
	The new House bill would have ``a devastating impact on the  
thousands of women who turn to bankruptcy courts to collect alimony 
and child support from former husbands'' who have sought bankruptcy 
protection, Rep. Sheila Jackson Lee, D-Texas, testified Tuesday at 
a House Judiciary subcommittee hearing. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Jackson Lee is chairwoman of a congressional caucus on  
children's issues. 
</P>
<P>
	She was joined by other Democrats opposed to the bill, as the  
commercial and administrative law subcommitee opened hearings on 
the legislation, which is backed by credit card companies and 
retail businesses. 
</P>
<P>
	The bill's sponsors, led by Rep. George Gekas, R-Pa., say it  
gives highest priority among debts to child support and alimony 
payments, putting them ahead of credit card debt and other 
obligations. But Democratic opponents maintain that the bill, by 
barring certain credit card debts from being erased in bankruptcy, 
would force single mothers to compete with big credit card 
companies for payment. 
</P>
<P>
	Sen. Charles Grassley, R-Iowa, meanwhile, said the Clinton  
administration's position on bankruptcy legislation ``is a really 
big question mark.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Grassley said White House aides recently told him they want such  
legislation and are willing to negotiate, but they can't promise 
anything because Clinton might veto it. 
</P>
<P>
	White House spokesman Barry Toiv said recently that the  
administration, which supports overhauling the bankruptcy laws, 
needed to examine this year's legislation to determine whether it 
strikes a balance between the legitimate needs of debtors and 
creditors. 
</P>
<P>
	Grassley, with Democratic Sens. Joseph Biden of Delaware and  
Robert Torricelli of New Jersey, on Tuesday proposed a new version 
of legislation to rewrite the bankruptcy laws. 
</P>
<P>
	Both the House and Senate bills would allow federal bankruptcy  
judges to determine a debtor's ability to repay. They would use an 
IRS standard to estimate living expenses and calculate whether the 
payback could be 25 percent or more of the total debt within three 
years. If so, the debtor could be forced into a Chapter 13 
reorganization plan. 
</P>
<P>
	Under Chapter 13 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code, people must repay  
their debts according to a court-ordered plan. Credit card 
companies complain that too many people take shelter under the more 
lenient Chapter 7, which erases debts, when they could afford to 
restructure debts under Chapter 13.

<HEADLINE> So You Think You've Got a Good Job? </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Baseball player, president and cowboy -- great  
jobs, right? 
</P>
<P>
	Wrong. Try Website manager, computer systems analyst and  
software engineer. 
</P>
<P>
	Low stress, short work weeks and room for advancement put those  
professions near the top of the list in ``Jobs Rated Almanac,'' a 
new book ranking the best and worst jobs in the country. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think what surprises most people are those jobs they always  
thought were so glamorous are at the bottom. The work-a-day world 
for some of those jobs is the pits,'' said author Les Krantz. 
</P>
<P>
	Using data from the government, trade groups and telephone  
surveys, Krantz ranked 250 jobs according to six criteria: income, 
stress, physical demands, potential growth, job security and work 
environment. 
</P>
<P>
	That's why -- with no room for growth, lots of stress and a  
stagnant salary -- ``President of the United States'' ranked No. 
229. 
</P>
<P>
	``Some of the things your parents told you you should always  
grow up to be didn't rank so well,'' Krantz said. 
</P>
<P>
	Nine of the top 10 jobs were in computer or math-related fields,  
with Website managers placing first. 
</P>
<P>
	Physical labor fared worst in the ranking, with oil field  
``roustabouts,'' lumberjacks, and fishermen taking the final three 
spots on the list. 
</P>
<P>
	Likewise, professional baseball players (No. 202) and cowboys  
(No. 246) were deemed less desirable because of the physical 
demands and poor job stability. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't see (roustabout) as a terrible type thing,'' said John  
D. Bell, the owner of a one-man oil well operation in Lamesa, 
Texas. ``It beats working at McDonald's and usually pays better 
than those jobs.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Not all restaurant jobs are held in such low regard, however.  
Farther up the food chain from fast food, cooks ranked No. 172, 
dishwashers ranked No. 213, and waiters and waitresses ranked No. 
136. 
</P>
<P>
	For anyone who idealizes teaching (No. 162), the book offers  
this reality check: ``Much work in this profession, such as 
preparing lessons, grading papers and attending meetings, is done 
after the school day has ended. Teachers spend long periods of time 
on their feet. Working with rambunctious children can be fatiguing 
and stressful.'' 
</P>
<P>
	As the Website manager of careers.wsj.com, a unit of The Wall  
Street Journal Interactive Edition, Tony Lee believes his job is 
No. 1 because of the growth in the Internet industry. 
</P>
<P>
	``Companies are scrambling to open new (Internet) departments  
... to boost revenues and increase e-commerce,'' he said. ``There's 
an unbelievable amount of autonomy.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Laura Berman Fortgang, author of the career advice book ``Take  
Yourself to the Top,'' doubts many people who read the book will 
decide to switch careers. 
</P>

	Krantz agrees, describing the book as ``everything you wanted to  
know about your neighbor's job and didn't have the courage to 
ask.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Krantz also lists the jobs with the best perks. At the top of  
that list are geologists (No.60), who get subsidized housing during 
field work, private offices, paid trips to exotic locations and 
secretaries and researchers to help with the nuts-and-bolts of the 
job. 
</P>
<P>
	``Yes, there are great benefits. I think it's safe to say that  
most people don't become geologists because they think they are 
going to make a lot of money or get a lot of extras,'' said Gary 
Ehret, a geologist for Texaco.

<HEADLINE> GOP Plan Includes $6B for Crops </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The push to overhaul a crop insurance program  
for farmers got a boost Wednesday as Republican lawmakers included 
an additional $6 billion over four years to pay for the proposal in 
both the House and Senate budget resolutions. 
</P>
<P>
	That would nearly double the amount now being spent on crop  
insurance. 
</P>
<P>
	Both budget committees began voting on the resolutions  
Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is nothing less than a triumph for America's farmers and  
ranchers,'' said House Agriculture Committee Chairman Larry 
Combest, R-Texas. ``The $6 billion contained in the budget 
resolution guarantees us the fiscal means to strengthen the 
financial safety net for farmers. I'm confident we'll now have the 
tools to improve the risk management system.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The budget resolutions, which propose increases of about $1.5  
billion annually over four years for crop insurance on top of the 
$1.6 billion per year being spent now, are essentially a blueprint 
for things GOP leaders would like to accomplish. But they face 
hurdles as they go through the legislative process. 
</P>
<P>
	President Clinton did not include crop insurance in his budget  
proposal but has expressed a commitment to making reforms. 
Agriculture Secretary Dan Glickman has unveiled a plan that would 
cost between $2 and $2.5 billion more per year than current 
spending. 
</P>
<P>
	The commitment to overhaul crop insurance comes as farmers face  
another year of low prices in a sagging agricultural economy. Last 
year, Congress approved $6 billion in disaster insurance to help 
farmers through the crisis with their 1998 crops. 
</P>
<P>
	Many farmers don't have crop insurance and those who do complain  
that it is too expensive and inadequate. But with low prices 
expected to continue, lawmakers want to use crop insurance as a 
safety net to help farmers through the tough times. 
</P>
<P>
	That was what they envisioned when they phased out decades of  
government subsidies in the 1996 farm law. But many farmers don't 
have crop insurance, saying it's inexpensive or inadequate. 
Taxpayers fund 60 percent of the $1.6 billion program while 
farmers' premiums pay the rest. 
</P>
<P>
	Some GOP leaders have expressed concern about whether crop  
insurance is the right way to help farmers, and many Democrats have 
maintained that even with a crop insurance overhaul, farmers will 
need millions more in assistance. 
</P>
<P>
	``The budget resolution clearly does not respond to the present  
crisis in agriculture,'' said Sen. Tom Harkin, D-Iowa. 
</P>
<P>
	Senate Agriculture Chairman Dick Lugar, R-Ind., said during a  
hearing Wednesday on crop insurance that he is unsure whether 
insurance is the best solution. ``Before committing additional 
funds, I believe we should consider fundamental questions about 
crop insurance and the government's role,'' Lugar said. 
</P>
<P>
	The inclusion of crop insurance in the budget resolutions comes  
after intense lobbying by farm state lawmakers. Last week, 75 House 
Republicans wrote to House Budget Committee Chairman John Kasich, 
R-Ohio, and urged him to include money for the reforms.

<HEADLINE> NJ Police Settle Suit Over Race </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TRENTON, N.J. (AP) -- The New Jersey State Police has agreed to a  
$225,000 settlement with a black woman who said she was pulled over 
because of her race, beaten and spat at. 
</P>
<P>
	``This was a classic New Jersey State Police profile stop based  
strictly on the type of vehicle and the race of the occupants and 
nothing else,'' said Ronald Sage, a lawyer for Dorothy Cobbs. 
</P>
<P>
	State officials did not admit any wrongdoing in the settlement,  
saying the agreement was made to avoid the cost of litigation. 
</P>
<P>
	The settlement comes as the state fends off allegations that  
State Police target minority motorists for stops. 
</P>
<P>
	Gov. Christie Whitman recently fired State Police Superintendent  
Carl Williams, who said minorities were responsible for most of the 
state's cocaine and marijuana traffic. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Cobbs, 52, of Wyandanch, N.Y., sued in December alleging  
false arrest, false imprisonment, assault and battery, malicious 
destruction of property and conspiracy to commit perjury. 
</P>
<P>
	She said the mistreatment happened when she was returning from a  
trip to Atlantic City on Jan. 4, 1996, while driving her black 
Porsche. 
</P>
<P>
	She contends Trooper Patrick O'Dwyer -- a two-time state trooper  
of the year -- pulled her over saying she had a broken tail light. 
She says O'Dwyer swore at her, grabbed her by the wrist, punched 
her in the face, sprayed her with Mace and later tackled her after 
she ran across the highway to a median. 
</P>
<P>
	After being taken to the State Police barracks, she was slammed  
against a wall, spat at and verbally abused, the lawsuit said. 
</P>
<P>
	O'Dwyer said Ms. Cobbs was driving slowly on the parkway and he  
pulled her over to offer assistance. He said he smelled alcohol on 
her breath and asked her to get out of the car. He said she became 
irate and unruly during questioning.

<HEADLINE> New Nursing Home Rules Announced </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- State inspectors will have to investigate  
complaints of harm to nursing home residents more quickly under new 
federal rules announced Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	``The complaint process ... was not working as well as it should  
be,'' said Nancy-Ann DeParle, administrator of the agency that 
oversees federal dollars going to nursing homes. ``In some states, 
complaints can sit there for weeks, even months.'' 
</P>
<P>
	As a remedy, DeParle said, state inspection agencies were  
informed in a letter sent Tuesday that they must now respond within 
10 days to any complaint alleging harm to nursing home residents. 
In the past, inspectors had to meet a two-day deadline only in 
situations meeting the graver standard of posing ``immediate 
jeopardy'' to a resident. 
</P>
<P>
	Families of nursing home residents and other advocates for the  
elderly and disabled have brought attention to the problem, DeParle 
said. An audit by the government's General Accounting Office, 
expected out later this week, raises similar concerns and a 
congressional hearing has been scheduled later this month, say 
those who have seen it. 
</P>
<P>
	DeParle said new posters, pamphlets and videos will help educate  
nursing home residents and their families about the new standards 
and how to file complaints. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's not just physically hurting someone,'' she said. ``It  
could also be things like not providing proper nutrition.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The educational materials are to be in nursing homes by May.  
</P>
<P>
	The new complaint guidelines are the latest step in a campaign  
President Clinton announced last summer to improve enforcement of 
nursing home standards. 
</P>
<P>
	Other steps include immediate fines of up to $10,000 for serious  
violations of health and safety standards. In the past, nursing 
homes got time to correct such problems before being subject to 
fines. 
</P>
<P>
	The government also has posted nursing homes' individual  
inspection records on the Internet and is requiring more frequent, 
surprise inspections of homes with a history of serious violations. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton's fiscal year 2000 budget asks Congress for an  
additional $60 million to help pay for the efforts. While states 
are primarily responsible for inspecting nursing homes and 
recommending sanctions, they get money for those activities from 
the federal government.

<HEADLINE>  NCAA Asks Judge To Delay SAT Ruling </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PHILADELPHIA (AP) -- The NCAA asked a federal judge today to  
delay enforcement of a ruling that would prevent college athletics' 
national governing body from using minimum standardized test scores 
to determine freshman eligibility. 
</P>
<P>
	In asking for a stay from U.S. District Judge Ronald Buckwalter  
in Philadelphia, the NCAA said that immediately taking the 
eligibility requirements off the books could cause chaos among its 
302 Division I schools who would suddenly be without a critical 
recruiting guideline. 
</P>
<P>
	Buckwalter, who ordered the end to the NCAA's Proposition 16  
last week, may rule on the request for a stay as early as Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	``Because the number of spots available for recruiting and  
athletic scholarships are limited, the rules of the game are 
knocked out,'' NCAA counsel David Bruton said in court Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	``Those most at risk are those who are qualifiers and  
academically eligible, but are threatened by'' more 
athletically-talented students who cannot fulfill academic 
requirements, Bruton added. 
</P>
<P>
	Lawyers for the four plaintiffs who filed the suit disputed the  
claim. 
</P>
<P>
	``The NCAA is saying the sky is falling, and it's not falling,''  
said Andre Dennis, the lead attorney for the plaintiffs. ``There's 
every reason for the court to continue the injunction as it 
exists.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Under Proposition 16, the association required freshmen athletes  
to have a high school diploma and a minimum grade-point average in 
13 core academic courses, with the GPA contingent on an indexed, 
sliding scale with a student's score on either the Scholastic 
Assessment Test or American College Test. 
</P>
<P>
	However, students scoring less than 820 on the SAT, or 66 on the  
ACT, could not participate, regardless of their other academic 
credentials. 
</P>
<P>
	Both sides agree that any reform must be instituted by the NCAA  
and not leave individual schools to make up their own guidelines, 
said both an NCAA lawyer and the foster father of a college track 
athlete who filed the suit. 
</P>
<P>
	``We need some time for an orderly position and (to) put new  
guidelines in place,'' said NCAA general counsel Elsa Cole. ``If 
everything went smoothly, we might have new (guidelines) by 
October.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Robert Massie, the foster father of one of the plaintiffs,  
University of Miami track athlete Leatrice Shaw, said the ruling 
``is for all future people going to school.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But with no general guidelines in place, ``it's a crapshoot now,  
because a school can just use an athlete and kick him to the 
curb,'' said Massie, a track coach at Simon Gratz High School in 
Philadelphia. He criticized the NCAA for not having alternatives 
already in place. 
</P>
<P>
	Buckwalter's ruling over Proposition 16 did not limit the use of  
standardized tests, which many educators have long said are 
racially and culturally discriminatory. Its forerunner, Proposition 
48, resulted from an NCAA convention in 1983 when a group of 
reform-minded school presidents began pushing for toughened 
academic requirements.

<HEADLINE> New York Approves DiMaggio Highway </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) -- The state Legislature honored Joe DiMaggio  
Wednesday by voting to rename a stretch of the West Side Highway in 
Manhattan after the New York Yankees great. 
</P>
<P>
	Both the Assembly and Senate adopted the resolution as members  
delivered testimonials to the life and the style of the former 
center fielder. DiMaggio died March 8 at 84. 
</P>
<P>
	Senate Majority Leader Joseph Bruno, R-Rensselaer, said he had  
the honor of talking with DiMaggio prior to opening day at Yankee 
Stadium in 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	``It struck me how humble he was in relating on a personal  
basis, looking you right in the eye,'' Bruno said. ``He went out to 
the mound and threw the first pitch and it was right over the plate 
and he jogged up to the catcher and shook hands. And I thought, 
that is greatness at every stage and at every age.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Sen. Alton Waldon Jr., D-Queens, recounted seeing DiMaggio play  
at Yankee Stadium when a Washington Senators batter hit a shot 
toward the monuments in center field. 
</P>
<P>
	``Joe D. turned and with his back to home plate gracefully  
strode and reached up and caught the ball in full stride without 
looking back,'' Waldon said. ``It was breathtaking. It was 
heavenly.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Assembly Speaker Sheldon Silver, D-Manhattan, said DiMaggio  
handled the pressure of being the best player of his era ``with 
class and showed us all that there is a place for gentlemen and 
generosity in professional sports.''

charged with first-degree murder and kidnapping after police found 
a piece of his girlfriend's missing 3-year-old son in his basement.

	Patricia Gomez said her son, Adam, had been missing since  
Friday. Warner said she is not suspected of any wrongdoing.

	Irish Prime Minister Bertie Ahern wore a bright green tie at a

He and 70 Irish leaders and members of Congress at the event were 
entertained by the U.S. Air Force Reserve Pipe Band and Irish

<HEADLINE> Woman Gets Postcard After 47 Years </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ATTLEBORO, Mass. (AP) -- When Florence Forget checked through her  
mail this week, she didn't expect to find a postcard from her two 
sisters in Florida. That's because the trip was in 1952. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was such a shock,'' said Forget, 87. ``I looked at it and I  
burst out crying.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Forget said the card brought with it the aura of a message from  
beyond. 
</P>
<P>
	She said that in the old days, her sisters Alice Thibeault and  
Doris Taylor, both of whom are now dead, traveled together 
frequently. 
</P>
<P>
	The card, which shows a painting of a public garden in St.  
Petersburg, Fla., tells Forget the two were ``seeing all the 
sights.'' 
</P>
<P>
	It bears a 2-cent stamp and 1952 postmark, as well as a new  
11-cent stamp and March 8, 1999, Jacksonville, Fla., postmark. 
</P>
<P>
	Postal Service spokeswoman Christine Dugas said it's unlikely  
the card was found in a post office, because it would then have 
been delivered in a special envelope with a letter explaining why 
it was late. 
</P>
<P>
	``It could've been in somebody's attic for 47 years,'' Dugas  
said. ``Someone found it, put a stamp on it and mailed it.''

	LONDON (AP) -- Lady Maria Theresa Armstrong, a reclusive  
aristocrat whose castle in northern England was once a stronghold 
of ancient Saxon kings, died Monday. She was in her 80s, but her 
date of birth was not available. 
</P>
<P>
	Of Italian descent, she was the daughter of Count Fabrizio Enea  
Chiodelli-Manzoni and was married in 1947 to the 3rd Baron 
Armstrong, a descendant of a Victorian industrialist who built a 
business empire from armaments and engineering. The couple adopted 
two children. 
</P>
<P>
	The baron died in 1987 and Lady Armstrong spent her latter years

was 86. 
</P>
<P>
	Like Ansel Adams and Alfred Stieglitz, Callahan was considered a  
master of his art, but unlike them, he wasn't a household name. He 
was known for his expansive eye, imaginative techniques, passionate 
work ethic and for being as creative in his 80s as he was in his 
30s. 
</P>
<P>
	He taught at the Institute of Design in Chicago from 1946-1961.  
He left in 1961 to develop the new photography department at the 
Rhode Island School of Design, remaining until his retirement in 
1977.

journalist who twice received his country's top prize for 
journalism, died Monday of a heart attack, the government news 
agency Notimex reported. He was 73. 
</P>
<P>
	Gomez began his career at the daily Novedades in 1948. A year  
later, he began writing a full-page column ``Popoff Salad.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Barrios Gomez launched a daily radio commentary in 1950, then  
moved on to television programs -- winning awards in both media. 
</P>
<P>
	He won Mexico's National Prize for Journalism in 1974 and 1975,  
as well as honors from France, England and Lebanon. In 1974, 
Barrios Gomez was named editorial coordinator of the Televisa 
network. 
</P>
<P>
	He was a diplomat between 1977 and 1987, serving as Mexico's  
ambassador to Canada, the Bahamas and Switzerland. In 1990-92, he 
was Mexico's consul general in New York. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1991, Barrios Gomez began a weekly newspaper column. He  
returned to radio in 1993 with a program that was broadcast daily 
in Mexico and in the southern United States until 1995. 
</P>
<P>
	He is survived by his wife, Patricia Segues, and a son.

one of San Francisco's most renowned families, died Tuesday. She

</P>
<P>
	Wife of the late attorney Vincent Hallinan, Mrs. Hallinan raised  
six boys and built a family fortune. She earned millions of dollars 
in real estate deals to build the war chest that financed her many 
political fights, from opposition to the Vietnam War to support for 
the Sandinista regime in Nicaragua. 
</P>
<P>
	In the early 1950s, she wrote a book about raising her boys --

at the newspaper in 1982, died Tuesday. He was 69. 
</P>
<P>
	Sheaffer was the Star's chief photographer for 27 years prior to

<P>
	In December 1995, he and a reporter located a hiker stranded on  
the ledge of a cliff in the Santa Catalina Mountains. When matches 
tossed to the hiker missed their target, Sheaffer threw one of his 
ever-present cigars so that the hiker could light a fire. 
Sheaffer's pictures of the hiker made the Star's front page. 
</P>
<P>
	He is survived by eight brothers and sisters.

<HEADLINE> Kaiser Members Sue HMO Over Ads </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SAN FRANCISCO (AP) -- Members of one of the nation's largest HMOs  
have sued the organization, claiming they were duped by ads that 
said its doctors weren't influenced by financial concerns. 
</P>
<P>
	The lawsuit contends Kaiser Permanente and its parent, The  
Permanente Federation, compromised care with their policies. 
</P>
<P>
	``Kaiser has gone beyond the pale with its statements here that  
doctors make decisions based on medical need and there's no fiscal 
interference,'' said Jamie Court of the nonprofit Foundation for 
Taxpayer and Consumer Rights, which filed the proposed class-action 
lawsuit in Superior Court on Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	The lawsuit contends that Kaiser withheld up to 30 percent of  
doctors' salaries and tied physician bonus pay and other 
compensation to reaching certain profit goals. 
</P>
<P>
	Kaiser called the allegations ``patently false.''  
</P>
<P>
	``The whole premise upon which the lawsuit is based is a lie,''  
said Dr. Sharon Levine, associate executive director of Permanente 
Medical Group for Northern California. 
</P>
<P>
	Levine called the allegations of pay being contingent upon  
achieving targeted profit goals ``absolutely baloney.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Medical decisions at Kaiser Permanente do rest in the hands of  
doctors and we're very proud of that fact,'' she said. ``No health 
plan administrator has anything to do with those decisions.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The lawsuit seeks unspecified monetary damages for up to 800,000  
members of Oakland-based Kaiser, which has nearly 5.6 million 
members in California and over 9 million members nationwide.

<HEADLINE> GOP Moves Toward Budget Approval </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- In double-barreled political dueling,  
Republicans crushed Democratic attempts to block tax cuts Wednesday 
and moved toward pushing $1.74 trillion budgets for fiscal 2000 
through House and Senate committees. 
</P>
<P>
	On both sides of the Capitol, Democrats proposed requiring that  
Social Security and Medicare be overhauled before Republicans could 
get the tax cuts they want -- $15 billion next year and $778 billion 
over the next decade. The GOP majority prevailed by party-line 
votes, 12-10 in the Senate Budget Committee and 23-19 in the House 
Budget Committee. 
</P>
<P>
	Democrats designed their amendments to the 2000 budget bills in  
order to cast Republicans as more eager to cut taxes than to 
fortify Social Security and Medicare for the looming retirement of 
baby boomers. 
</P>
<P>
	``There is a desperation to claim tax cuts as a primary thing  
they have to focus on,'' Sen. Frank Lautenberg of New Jersey, the 
Senate budget panel's ranking Democrat. 
</P>
<P>
	Republicans countered that projected federal surpluses -- which  
they say will total $2.9 trillion over the next 10 years -- make it 
possible to do many things. 
</P>
<P>
	``Let's get it straight,'' said Senate Budget Committee Chairman  
Pete Domenici, R-N.M. ``There are many priorities. We're going to 
save Medicare'' and Social Security. ``And in addition we are going 
to give the American people a welcome, needed tax cut.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Even as the GOP flexed its muscle in committee, they ran into a  
Clinton administration veto threat over a GOP plan to ensure that 
Social Security's vast surpluses over the next decade -- before baby 
boomers start retiring -- be set aside for debt reduction. 
</P>
<P>
	The Republican proposal -- which will move as separate  
legislation from the budget bill -- would require that Social 
Security surpluses be used to buy down the debt. Doing otherwise 
would require votes of 60 of the 100 senators, a tough hurdle. 
</P>
<P>
	In a letter to Democratic leaders, Treasury Secretary Robert  
Rubin said the plan could hinder the government from issuing new 
debt if needed, threatening its credit rating and perhaps requiring 
it to stop paying Social Security benefits. 
</P>
<P>
	``I will recommend that the president veto the bill if it  
contains the debt limit provisions,'' Rubin wrote. 
</P>
<P>
	Besides the GOP tax reductions, the similar budget plans by  
Domenici and House Budget Committee Chairman John Kasich, R-Ohio, 
would set aside $1.8 trillion in Social Security surpluses through 
2009 for debt reduction. 
</P>
<P>
	Congress' budget sets overall spending and tax limits, leaving  
decisions about specifics for later bills. 
</P>
<P>
	Even so, the GOP budget bills would boost defense spending to  
$289 billion, $9 billion more than this year and $8 billion more 
than Clinton has proposed. They would also increase spending for 
primary and secondary schools by more than $2 billion next year, 
and provide more for some agriculture and veterans programs. 
</P>
<P>
	Republicans said they could afford those increases while  
honoring a tight spending limit for next year set by the 1997 
budget-balancing pact. Neither committee provided much detail about 
which programs they would cut to heed that spending ceiling, but 
both chairmen said they could do so. 
</P>
<P>
	``We believe these numbers are achievable,'' said Kasich. He  
added later, ``Every program can't go up if we're going to stay'' 
within the limits. 
</P>
<P>
	Nonetheless, Democrats said that to afford the GOP's proposed  
increases, the remaining programs affected by the spending limits 
would face 12 percent reductions. That could mean cuts to popular 
programs such as Head Start, food inspections and the FBI, they 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	``If it were an over-the-counter drug, it would have to say,  
'Warning: Could be harmful to elderly, children and working 
families,''' Senate Minority Leader Tom Daschle, D-S.D., said of 
the GOP plan. ``It is really a disappointment. They've given us an 
offer that we must refuse.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``We think this plan would leave wreckage in its path,'' said  
Linda Ricci, spokeswoman for the White House Office of Management 
and Budget.

<HEADLINE> Medicare Plan Lacks Enough Votes </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- On the eve of a final vote, leaders of a  
commission charged with reforming Medicare acknowledged Monday they 
remain one vote shy of the consensus needed to make a 
recommendation to Congress. 
</P>
<P>
	After a year of meetings, 10 of the 17 members of the National  
Bipartisan Commission on the Future of Medicare support a plan that 
would inject competition into the health insurance program for the 
elderly by letting seniors choose from a menu of options. Eleven 
votes are needed. 
</P>
<P>
	The commission, which includes Republicans, Democrats, members  
of Congress and private economists, hoped to rise above politics 
and offer Congress a blueprint for reforming a program that has 
been a magnet for political warfare. 
</P>
<P>
	But in the end, the plan is largely supported by Republicans,  
backed by just two Democrats -- Sen. John Breaux, D-La., the 
commission's chairman, and Sen. Bob Kerrey, D-Neb. 
</P>
<P>
	Breaux and co-chairman Rep. Bill Thomas, R-Calif., vowed to  
fight for it in Congress, saying they hoped to move legislation 
this year that would make their ideas law even without commission 
endorsement. 
</P>
<P>
	``What do you do? Do you just cry about it or do you introduce  
legislation based on this?'' Breaux said Monday. ``What we've got 
is very important. ... We've changed the debate in a major, major 
way, and that in my opinion is a real success.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He predicted the plan would attract at least 60 votes in the  
Senate, enough to overcome any filibuster. Thomas was less 
confident about its prospects in the House, though he said there is 
substantial support. 
</P>
<P>
	President Clinton has remained on the sidelines, though all four  
of the people he appointed to the commission have declined to 
support the Breaux-Thomas plan. 
</P>
<P>
	White House spokesman Barry Toiv said Monday that Clinton has  
not had a chance to review the plan, whose outlines have been 
circulating for weeks, and would have no comment on its substance. 
</P>
<P>
	``But the president wants very much to achieve bipartisan reform  
this year,'' Toiv said. 
</P>
<P>
	Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott was skeptical, saying he was  
discouraged that none of Clinton's appointees supported the plan. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a sign to me that apparently he's going to try and  
politicize Medicare instead of introduce real reform,'' Lott said 
Monday on PBS' ``NewsHour With Jim Lehrer.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Breaux-Thomas plan would make Medicare more like health  
benefits that many companies and the federal government offer to 
workers. 
</P>
<P>
	Retirees could choose from a menu of health-insurance policies  
and get a subsidy to help cover the cost. The more expensive plans 
would require participants to pay more out of their own pockets. 
Meanwhile, the government-run system that serves most retirees now 
would compete with the private health plans, which would have to 
offer similar coverage. 
</P>
<P>
	The plan would also gradually raise the eligibility age from 65  
to 67, though it would not require wealthier elderly people more 
for their coverage, as was considered. 
</P>
<P>
	One of the most controversial issues has been prescription drug  
coverage, which is not part of the 34-year-old, traditional 
Medicare plan. The plan would require private companies to offer at 
least one option that includes drug coverage. The popular private 
plans that supplement Medicare coverage, known as Medigap, would be 
required to offer drugs as well. 
</P>
<P>
	Drugs would be available through the traditional Medicare  
program, too, but the elderly would have to pay for the extra cost. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton has proposed using 15 percent of the budget surplus to  
shore up Medicare, and he has suggested that the program add drug 
payments, though the details of his program are not clear. 
</P>
<P>
	The Breaux-Thomas plan does not anticipate funneling extra money  
into Medicare from the budget surplus. But the commission staff 
estimates that their plan would save the program $100 billion 
between 2000 and 2009 and enough to keep the program solvent 
through 2017. The program is now expected to go broke in about a 
decade -- just as the huge baby boom begins to retire. 
</P>
<P>
	Thomas has repeatedly expressed frustration that 11 votes are  
needed to make a recommendation, given that his plan enjoys 
majority support. 
</P>
<P>
	``The fact that we don't have a super-super majority should in  
no way be judged as a failure,'' he said. ``The proposal we will 
present is, in fact, the only reasonable way to go.''

<HEADLINE> Japan Stocks Rise for Third Day / Japanese Stocks  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TOKYO (AP) -- Japanese share prices climbed to their highest  
level in almost eight months today, reversing a dip in early 
trading on optimism about corporate restructuring efforts and a 
rally on Wall Street overnight. The dollar rose against the yen. 
</P>
<P>
	The benchmark 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average gained 195.29  
points, or 1.22 percent, to close at 16,268.11 its highest close 
since July 31. On Tuesday, the average had risen 293.22 points, or 
1.86 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	The dollar bought 118.70 yen in mid-afternoon trading, up 0.86  
yen from late Tuesday in Tokyo and also above its late New York 
level of 117.79 yen overnight. 
</P>
<P>
	On the Tokyo Stock Exchange, share prices recovered from a spill  
into negative territory and posted a third day of gains after the 
Dow Jones industrial average crossed the 10,000 point mark for the 
first time on Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Computer driven selling sapped some of the Dow's early strength  
and it closed at 9,930.47, down 28.30 points, or 0.3 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	In Tokyo, the broader Tokyo Stock Price Index of all issues  
listed on the first section picked up 19.20 points, or 1.55 
percent, to 1,260.09. The TOPIX had gained 29.71 points, or 2.45 
percent, the day before. 
</P>
<P>
	Encouraged by signs that corporate Japan is cutting costs and  
hope that a recovery may be just around the corner, foreign 
investors leery of the sharp spike in U.S. stock prices helped buoy 
the Japanese equity market, traders said. 
</P>
<P>
	``Shares linked to domestic demand are becoming especially  
popular because investors from overseas are increasing their 
weighting in them,'' said Masatoshi Sato, manager of investment 
information at Kankaku Securities Co. 
</P>
<P>
	After soaring 18 percent over the past two trading days, stock  
in Nissan Motor Co. slid 1.69 percent to close at 465 yen ($3.92). 
That followed a formal announcement from Renault SA on Tuesday that 
it offered to buy a 35 percent stake in the debt laden Japanese 
automaker. 
</P>
<P>
	In currency dealings, the dollar advanced amid speculation that  
Japanese finance officials were anxious to prevent the yen from 
strengthening against the U.S. currency. 
</P>
<P>
	A stronger yen could hurt profit growth at big exporters by  
eroding the value of their dollar denominated earnings made 
overseas. 
</P>
<P>
	The speculation was sparked by a report that Finance Minister  
Kiichi Miyazawa declined to comment on foreign exchange rates, and 
by a remark by Haruhiko Kuroda, head of the ministry's 
international bureau, who said recent movements in the dollar yen 
trade have been ``a little excessive.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The dollar also was buoyed as domestic importers rushed to shore  
up their holdings of the greenback, traders said. 
</P>
<P>
	``Not many people want or expect the yen to strengthen more than  
it has, and so people who need dollars like domestic importers are 
moving to cover their short positions,'' said Koichi Udagawa, 
assistant manager of the treasury division at Daiwa Bank Ltd. 
</P>
<P>
	In other currencies, the euro was traded at 130.76 yen, up  
sharply from 127.62 yen late Tuesday in Tokyo. 
</P>
<P>
	The euro fell Tuesday on news that the entire 20-member European  
Commission resigned in response to a blistering report charging 
cronyism and fraud in the commission. 
</P>
<P>
	The yield on the benchmark No. 203 10-year Japanese government  
bond fell to 1.710 percent from Tuesday's finish of 1.800 percent, 
driving its price up to 100.71 yen from 100.00 yen.

<HEADLINE> Olympic Boss Gets Vote of Confidence </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LAUSANNE, Switzerland (AP) -- The applause washed over the  
embattled boss of the Olympics Wednesday, perhaps for one of the 
last times. 
</P>
<P>
	IOC president Juan Antonio Samaranch received a near-unanimous  
vote of confidence from committee members at the start of an 
emergency general assembly dealing with the worst scandal in 
Olympic history. 
</P>
<P>
	Later, Samaranch and the rest of the International Olympic  
Committee's leadership received another boost when the 
rank-and-file endorsed their recommendations to expel six members, 
an unprecedented purge. 
</P>
<P>
	But the key moment for the 78-year-old Spaniard may have come  
when he formally opened the meeting with a review of good times and 
a plan for getting through the bad ones. 
</P>
<P>
	Toward the end of the honor roll of past successes and the  
caseload of corruption from Salt Lake's efforts to buy the 2002 
Winter Olympics, Samaranch gave perhaps his clearest sign yet that 
his days at the top of the world's biggest sports event may be near 
an end. 
</P>
<P>
	``I have personally given the best of myself to the Olympic  
movement over the last 18 years ... and my last service to Olympism 
would be to restructure our organization in order to enter the new 
millennium even stronger than before,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	There was no mention in the speech of Samaranch's intent to fill  
out his term that ends in late 2001. 
</P>
<P>
	When asked in a brief news conference if he planned to serve out  
his term, Samaranch spoke mainly of his health. It's good, he said, 
despite reports that he has signs of Parkinson's disease. 
</P>
<P>
	Critics have called for Samaranch to step down now, which  
clearly won't happen. 
</P>
<P>
	He presented an ambitious reform plan, including a radical  
change in picking the 2006 Winter Games site, open financial 
records, the IOC's first ethics panel and a star-studded commission 
to plot the Olympics' fate, dubbed ``IOC 2000.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``They should look at everything that can best prepare the IOC  
for the future,'' Samaranch said. He gave them until another 
extraordinary session later this year to come up with the plan. 
</P>
<P>
	Those changes will be debated -- and likely adopted -- when the  
special session wraps up Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	Since becoming president in 1980, Samaranch has been a  
globe-trotting ambassador of the five rings, schmoozing with heads 
of state, posing with athletes and taking in just about every major 
athletic competition short of the Super Bowl. 
</P>
<P>
	His style and politics have helped turn the IOC from a  
bedraggled organization nearly broke to one with more than $122 
million on hand and the owner of the most prestigious sports event 
in the world. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, with reform and resuscitation of the committee's image in  
mind, Samaranch can be expected to change his tactics, too, 
becoming a more hands-on CEO. 
</P>
<P>
	Samaranch has told close friends lately that he fears a plot  
within the IOC administration to force him from office. But he 
clearly has more friends than enemies. 
</P>
<P>
	``I could not think of a better way to say the next two years  
are yours,'' Jean-Claude Killy said of the 86-2 confidence vote, 
something Samaranch had sought when the scandal broke and which 
became so much of a formality that it was almost dropped from the 
agenda. 
</P>
<P>
	Samaranch was out of the convention hall when the vote was  
taken. When he returned, he received a standing ovation. 
</P>
<P>
	Even those who were expelled would not criticize their old boss.  
</P>
<P>
	``The IOC is going through a bad moment now, but don't forget  
what Samaranch has done over the past 18 years,'' said Agustin 
Arroyo, a member from Ecuador since 1968, now and ex-member for 
accepting ski vacations and financial help for his stepdaughter. 
</P>
<P>
	Arroyo said there had been three great leaders of the modern  
Olympics -- founder Pierre de Coubertin, longtime president Avery 
Brundage and Samaranch, ``the man who spread it out to the world.''

<HEADLINE> Reporters Must Name Jewell Sources </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ATLANTA (AP) -- A judge has again ordered reporters for The  
Atlanta Journal-Constitution to name sources for articles about 
Richard Jewell, a suspect in the Centennial Olympic Park bombing 
before he was cleared by the Justice Department. 
</P>
<P>
	Fulton County State Judge John Mather had ruled last April that  
the reporters must identify law enforcement officials who gave them 
information about Jewell, but the newspaper's attorneys refused. 
</P>
<P>
	Mather on Tuesday gave reporters 60 days to reveal sources or  
face possible civil contempt, which can include being jailed until 
they name names. The newspaper could appeal a contempt order if one 
is issued. 
</P>
<P>
	Peter Canfield, the newspaper's attorney, was out of town  
Tuesday and could not be reached for comment. 
</P>
<P>
	The Journal-Constitution reported that Jewell was being

<HEADLINE> Gov't Estimates Y2K Cost at $6.8B </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The government raised its estimate Wednesday  
by $400 million to $6.8 billion for fixing the Year 2000 computer 
problem among federal agencies, and said costs are expected to rise 
again. 
</P>
<P>
	And with only weeks before its self-imposed deadline of March 31  
to have all its most important 6,399 computer systems fixed, it 
said only four out of five of those systems have been repaired, 
replaced or never were vulnerable. 
</P>
<P>
	In a 57-page report from the Office of Management and Budget  
made available late Wednesday on the Internet, the government said 
three of its 24 largest agencies are making inadequate progress -- 
the Transportation Department, Health and Human Services and the 
Agency for International Development. 
</P>
<P>
	Work at the Agency for International Development, one of the  
worst agencies for repairs, slowed after a computer failed testing 
that officials believed had already been fixed. 
</P>
<P>
	The government predicted that five of the agency's seven most  
important computers won't be fixed by the March 31 deadline. 
</P>
<P>
	The report said the $400 million increase to fix all systems  
government-wide was anticipated, and blamed the rise in agencies 
finding that some computer systems need to be reworked after 
initial repairs. 
</P>
<P>
	``To the extent that agencies encounter additional difficulties  
through testing ... costs are likely to rise,'' the report said. 
</P>
<P>
	Many computers originally programmed to recognize only the last  
two digits of a year will not work properly beginning Jan. 1, 2000, 
when machines will assume it is 1900. Some computers can be 
reprogrammed, but many devices have embedded microchips that must 
be physically replaced. 
</P>
<P>
	The latest report said agencies are facing few problems because  
of these embedded chips, which aren't typically used for systems 
operating federal programs. 
</P>
<P>
	``This area does not appear to be of great concern,'' it said.  
</P>
<P>
	The government also said it doesn't expect to experience  
problems in its federal buildings, some of which feature 
computer-controlled elevators and heating and security systems. 
</P>
<P>
	``No catastrophic Y2K building system potential failures have  
been identified,'' the report said, adding that ``nearly all such 
systems allow for manual override.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Five of the largest 24 federal agencies have completed work  
already: Environmental Protection Agency, National Science 
Foundation, Nuclear Regulatory Commission, Small Business 
Administration and Social Security Administration.

</P>
<P>
	MADISON, Wis. (AP) -- Carroll ``Buzz'' Besadny, former head of  
Wisconsin's Department of Natural Resources for more than a decade, 
died Tuesday of cancer. He was 69. 
</P>
<P>
	Besadny, who worked in state government for 40 years, had a  
national and international reputation as a leader in conservation. 
</P>
<P>
	Besadny, a biologist, was DNR secretary from 1980 until his  
retirement in January 1993. His years heading the DNR included 
initiatives on groundwater protection, soil erosion control, public 
land acquisition, recycling, multiple use forestry and toxic 
substance control.

<P>
	ATLANTA (AP) -- Harry Callahan, who focused his camera on the  
ordinary and became one of the most influential photographers of 
the 20th century, died Monday of cancer. He was 86. 
</P>
<P>
	Callahan was awarded the National Medal of the Arts in 1997, one  
of the highest honors for an artist. An exhibit of his work opened 
at the National Gallery of Art in 1994 and toured nationally. 
</P>
<P>
	Unlike his mentor Ansel Adams, who is known for his black and  
white photographs of mountainous and snowy landscapes, Callahan 
concentrated on the everyday. His subjects ranged from the cities 
where he lived to his family. 
</P>
<P>
	Among celebrated works in his national exhibit were studies of  
trees in the snow, crowded streets in Detroit, color work from his 
travels during the late '70s and 80's and shots of his wife 
Eleanor.

	SAN FRANCISCO (AP) -- Vivian Hallinan, a peace activist and  
matriarch of one of San Francisco's most renowned families, died 
Tuesday. She was 88. 
</P>
<P>
	Wife of the late attorney Vincent Hallinan, Mrs. Hallinan raised  
six boys and built a family fortune. She earned millions of dollars 
in real estate deals to build the war chest that financed her many 
political fights, from opposition to the Vietnam War to support for 
the Sandinista regime in Nicaragua. 
</P>
<P>
	In the early 1950s, she wrote a book about raising her boys --  
``My Wild Irish Rogues.'' She also headed the San Francisco chapter 
of the Women's International League for Peace and Freedom.

	KINGSTON, Jamaica (AP) -- Ronald Irvine, a former Jamaican  
government minister and prominent cardiologist, died Monday of 
heart problems. He was 72. 
</P>
<P>
	Irvine was a longtime member of the Jamaican Senate, from  
1962-84, and was Minister Without Portfolio from 1980-84 under the 
Jamaica Labor Party government. 
</P>
<P>
	He worked at the University of the West Indies in Kingston from  
1952-53 and was a medical officer in the Jamaican government's 
Medical Service from 1953-56. He was a registrar in medicine at the 
University of the West Indies from 1958 and senior lecturer from 
1964 to 1970. 
</P>
<P>

	NEWARK, Ohio (AP) -- David Longaberger, who turned handmade woven  
baskets into a $700 million-a-year company that bears his name, 
died Wednesday of cancer. He was 64. 
</P>
<P>
	He was chairman of The Longaberger Co., which he founded in 1973  
with five weavers. Today the company employs more than 7,000 people 
and 47,000 independent sales associates who sold 8.3 million 
baskets in 1998. 
</P>
<P>
	Longaberger's father owned a basket company and taught all of  
his 12 children to make the baskets. But business waned as 
cardboard and paper sacks began to replace baskets and the business 
closed in 1955. 
</P>
<P>
	The baskets are prized by collectors and sold exclusively  
through home shows.

<P>
	PHILADELPHIA (AP) -- Walter E. Rauffenbart, former president and  
editor of The Legal Intelligencer, died Tuesday of heart failure. 
He was 87. 
</P>
<P>
	Rauffenbart joined The Legal Intelligencer in the 1930s when his  
father, Joseph, was treasurer and general manager of the newspaper. 
He spent more than 60 years with the Intelligencer, the nation's 
oldest law journal and the daily record of Philadelphia courts. 
</P>
<P>
	He was named editor and president in 1971. He was editor  
emeritus and consultant from 1977 until his retirement in 1992. 
</P>
<P>
	Rauffenbart helped the Philadelphia Bar Association launch the  
monthly magazine Shingle, now known as The Philadelphia Lawyer. He 
also helped found the Retainer, a biweekly tabloid, in 1972. The 
Retainer became a monthly called the Philadelphia Bar Reporter in 
1993. 
</P>
<P>
	The Intelligencer research library was named in his honor in  
1987. 
</P>

	He is survived by his wife of 55 years, Laurette Pigeon  
Rauffenbart, a daughter and a sister.

	TUCSON, Ariz. (AP) -- Jack Sheaffer, former chief photographer  
for The Arizona Daily Star who was severely injured by an explosion 
at the newspaper in 1982, died Tuesday. He was 69. 
</P>
<P>
	Sandra Berry, Sheaffer's niece, said that he never fully  
recovered from the blast that nearly killed him and burned more 
than half of his body. 
</P>
<P>
	Sheaffer was the Star's chief photographer for 27 years prior to  
the explosion. Over the years, he shot everything from college 
football games to visiting royalty, fires to floods, train wrecks 
to bus crashes. 
</P>
<P>
	In December 1995, he and a reporter located a hiker stranded on  
the ledge of a cliff in the Santa Catalina Mountains. Sheaffer 
threw one of his ever-present cigars so that the shivering hiker 
could light a fire. Sheaffer's pictures of the hiker made the 
Star's front page. 
</P>

	TAIPEI, Taiwan (AP) -- Wei Lung-hau, a master of exchanging jokes  
in an art form known as ``xiang sheng'' died March 7 of prostate 
cancer. He was 70. 
</P>
<P>
	His death ended an era of Chinese arts and culture that  
prevailed under Taiwan's policy of seeking unification with 
mainland China. 
</P>
<P>
	Wei was among hundreds of actors, actresses and other performers  
brought to Taiwan in 1949 after Chiang Kai-shek's Nationalist 
government lost a civil war to the Communists on the mainland. 
</P>
<P>
	Wei and his long-time performing partner, Wu Chao-nan, attracted  
large audiences with ``xiang sheng,'' an entertainment form where 
two people exchange rapid-fire jokes with incredible language 
skills, sing songs and tell humorous tales. They made the 
cross-talking art popular in Taiwan at a time when entertainment 
was rare. 
</P>
<P>
	They succeeded also because they made Chinese matters the theme  
of their cross-talk, coinciding with an official policy to promote 
Chinese culture and arts to reinforce the Nationalists' claim to be 
the sole legitimate government of all China.

<HEADLINE> GOP Rep. To Support Mine Inspectors </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- A key Republican subcommittee chairman  
indicated Tuesday that he would back the Clinton administration's 
request for 30 additional coal mine inspectors to combat 
work-related respiratory illnesses. 
</P>
<P>
	The administration wants $2 million to increase the frequency of  
coal dust sampling at the nation's underground mines from quarterly 
to every other month. Long-term exposure to coal dust can cause 
black lung and other respiratory diseases. 
</P>
<P>
	``If you need $2 million more to provide for that enforcement,  
I'm going to see that you get that money,'' said Rep. John Porter, 
R-Ill., chairman of the House Appropriations subcommittee that 
handles labor programs. ``This is something that has to be taken 
care of.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Subcommittee chairmen on the Appropriations Committee have  
considerable influence over spending on programs under their 
jurisdiction. 
</P>
<P>
	J. Davitt McAteer, assistant labor secretary for mine safety and  
health, said he was discouraged by recent tests suggesting that 
black-lung disease remains a big problem. He said more than 5 
percent of miners who took advantage of free health screenings in 
five states had abnormal X-ray readings. 
</P>
<P>
	Mine operators have been largely responsible for testing their  
mines for coal dust. Officials believe sampling by Mine Safety and 
Health Administration inspectors would yield better results and 
allow the agency to help mine operators correct any problems. 
</P>
<P>
	``The sampling process should be taken over by the agency,''  
McAteer told the subcommittee. 
</P>
<P>
	He said his agency also was crafting new regulations designed to  
change sampling methods so that averages do not artificially bring 
down coal dust levels. The rules, being reviewed by senior 
administration officials, could be issued this spring for public 
comment, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Over the past two years, Congress has given the agency an  
additional $4.4 million to hire 64 inspectors. The 30 positions 
sought in fiscal 2000 would help expand testing at underground 
mines. 
</P>
<P>
	McAteer said after the hearing that the administration  
eventually wants sampling every other month at surface mines as 
well. Inspections there are now done twice a year. 
</P>
<P>
	Many experts believed black lung disease would be eliminated  
after limits on dust were imposed by federal law in 1970. 
</P>
<P>
	Although its incidence has declined, the disease still  
contributes to the deaths of more than 1,000 coal miners a year, 
officials said. Studies show 10 percent of veteran underground coal 
miners have the disease.

<HEADLINE> Heisman Winner's Dad Freed on Bond </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HOUSTON (AP) -- The father of Heisman Trophy winner Ricky  
Williams was freed Wednesday on reduced bond after being charged 
with embezzling more than $20,000 from a nursing home. 
</P>
<P>
	Bail for Errick Lynne Williams, 41, was reduced from $40,000 to  
$5,000 on a third-degree felony theft charge, Harris County Jail 
records show. 
</P>
<P>
	Errick Williams, arrested Thursday, was accused of stealing some  
$20,700 from the Lexington Place Healthcare Center in Houston 
between Oct. 20, 1997, and Oct. 20, 1998 while working as a 
housekeeping supervisor, Harris County prosecutor Terry Jennings 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Errick Williams allegedly created phony documents and time slips  
that showed his wife worked with him, court papers state. 
</P>
<P>
	She did not, but the prosecutor said Errick Williams collected  
pay checks for her and cashed them. 
</P>
<P>
	Errick Williams' wife, Patricia Maria Williams, 36, has not been  
charged, Jennings said. 
</P>
<P>
	Sandra Williams raised her son as a single mother after she and  
Errick Williams were divorced in September 1983. Father and son 
have developed a friendship in recent years.

<HEADLINE> Horses Willed To Die Get New Life </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MONTPELIER, Vt. (AP) -- The horses ordered to die in a farmer's  
will were saved Wednesday by a judge who found the provision 
invalid and against public policy. 
</P>
<P>
	``While it is argued by the Estate that Howard Brand intended to  
prevent future cruelty to his horses by ordering their death, it 
would seem to this court that a death sentence imposed upon 
healthy, if aging, animals might be considered cruel in its own 
right,'' Judge Susan Fowler wrote. 
</P>
<P>
	A month before he died in January at age 88, Brand made an  
amendment to his will to have his 1964 Cadillac crushed and his 
animals -- including at least two horses -- destroyed. 
</P>
<P>
	Brand's last wishes struck the wrong chord with animal welfare  
groups. A coalition of such groups went to court, arguing that the 
order to destroy the animals went against public policy. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're very excited,'' said Alan Bjerke, the lawyer for the  
group. 
</P>
<P>
	Tom McCormick, the lawyer for Brand's estate, did not return  
phone calls Wednesday.

<HEADLINE> Wall Street Celebrates Milestone </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Traders on the New York Stock Exchange floor and  
visiting tourists cheered and threw their hands into the air. One 
person even trumpeted a kazoo. 
</P>
<P>
	But after the Dow Jones industrial average finally broke through  
10,000 Tuesday following days of close calls, the roar quickly 
subsided and it was back to work for the hundreds of people who 
make their living at the NYSE. 
</P>
<P>
	Across the country, investors also took a moment to mark the  
Dow's much-hyped milestone, and expressed cautious optimism that it 
would signal more good fortune ahead. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think it's great for the market. I think it will get a lot  
more people interested in the market and interested in investing,'' 
said Thomas Curd of Westland, Mich., a 45-year-old former carpenter 
who has become a daytime stock trader using his home computer. 
</P>
<P>
	As the Dow crossed 10,000 at 9:50 a.m., traders gathering around  
displays on the NYSE floor erupted in cheers and high-fived each 
other or threw confetti into the air. Some traders held all 10 
fingers aloft to signify the record. 
</P>
<P>
	Horst Blumenthal, a computer artist from Frankfurt, Germany, was  
one of many tourists packed into the visitors' gallery overlooking 
the NYSE floor as the moment arrived. 
</P>
<P>
	``I saw the news on TV this morning and said to myself, `I've  
got to be there,''' Blumenthal said. 
</P>
<P>
	Many traders felt the same way -- with some even postponing  
vacations to make sure they were on the floor when Dow 10,000 
became a reality. But within a minute of the celebration, it was 
business as usual, with hordes of traders in multicolored jackets 
scurrying around, scribbling notes on pads like frantic waiters. 
</P>
<P>
	The Dow rose as high as 10,001.78, a gain of 43.01, before  
giving ground. It closed at 9,930.47, down 28.30. 
</P>
<P>
	But 10,000 provided a moment of reflection for the growing  
numbers of individual investors who have helped push stocks to new 
heights -- and those who have missed the ride. 
</P>
<P>
	Jerry Turner, a 65-year-old former federal employee, was one of  
many retirees who congregated at the CNN Center in downtown Atlanta 
to watch the event on a large-screen TV. 
</P>
<P>
	Turner said he decided years ago to invest in land rather than  
stocks, a decision he now regrets. 
</P>
<P>
	``I didn't think I should get into something I didn't know  
about,'' he said. ``I wish I'd gotten into it 25 years ago. I'm too 
old now.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Other people wondered if the Dow's lofty heights left any room  
for further gains. 
</P>
<P>
	``It makes me a little more cautious because it's a hype number,  
a magic number, that everyone's expecting,'' said Andrew Jablonski, 
42, a graphic designer from Yonkers, N.Y., as he emerged from a 
Fidelity Investments office on New York's Park Avenue. 
</P>
<P>
	Jablonski said he is putting more money into more conservative  
investments now. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think a lot of people will look closer, and this honeymoon  
mood will have to be checked with reality,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	But other investors felt confident that the economy's strength  
would lift the Dow even further. 
</P>
<P>
	``It moved from 9,000 to 10,000 in a relatively short amount of  
time,'' said Henry Smith, 50, a lawyer in Los Angeles, referring to 
the fact that the Dow crossed 9,000 for the first time only last 
April. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think it will hit 11,000 before the end of the year.''

<HEADLINE> Baptist Church Breaks National Ties </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WINSTON-SALEM, N.C. (AP) -- A Baptist congregation has decided to  
sever ties with the Southern Baptist Convention after years of 
unhappiness over the denomination's increasingly conservative 
policies. 
</P>
<P>
	Members of Wake Forest Baptist Church voted in January to end  
its affiliation with the convention, but the congregation didn't 
make the vote public until Tuesday due to recent publicity over its 
endorsement of same-sex ceremonies. 
</P>
<P>
	``We wanted the community to know where we stand,'' said the  
Rev. Richard Groves, the pastor of the congregation that meets on 
the Wake Forest University campus but is independent of the school. 
</P>
<P>
	Only one member voted against the split when about 100 of the  
325-member congregation voted, Groves said. 
</P>
<P>
	In a letter sent to the convention, the congregation leaders  
said they were unhappy over the church's stand on women in 
ministry, targeting Jews and Mormons for evangelism, a literal 
interpretation of the Bible and isolation of congregations that 
reach out to gays and lesbians. 
</P>
<P>
	A resolution by the convention last summer calling in part for  
wives to ``submit graciously'' to their husbands sparked the formal 
break for Wake Forest Baptist.

	RENO, Nev. (AP) -- Current and former employees of the Forest  
Service are suing the agency to stop the use of a tree-marking 
spray paint they say causes miscarriages and other ailments. 
</P>
<P>
	The lawsuit, filed last week in Washington, says the Forest  
Service has been breaking the law by using the specialized, 
all-weather paint without an environmental impact statement on 
possible side effects. 
</P>
<P>
	The paint has been used widely in national forests over the past  
10 years to mark trees for logging. In 1993, an estimated 3,000 
people -- 80 percent of them men -- worked on crews using the paint. 
</P>
<P>
	A study by the National Institute of Occupational Safety and  
Health found an 82 percent to 177 percent increased risk of 
miscarriage among Forest Service foresters who used various brands 
of tree-marking paint. 
</P>
<P>
	Workers have also complained of blurry vision, confusion,  
nausea, fatigue, chronic sinus irritation, headaches and diarrhea. 
But the lawsuit gives no figures on the incidence of these 
ailments. 
</P>
<P>
	Last year, a Forest Service worker filed her own lawsuit against  
the manufacturer, Niles Chemical Paint Co. of Niles, Mich. 
</P>
<P>
	Carla Tipton of Baker City, Ore., alleges the company knew the  
paint contained chemicals banned by the government, including 
toluene, a solvent that the state of California says is known to 
cause reproductive problems. 
</P>
<P>
	Tipton has not reported any paint-related problems herself but  
said she collected complaints from other employees. 
</P>
<P>
	The chemicals are used in the paint so that it can sprayed  
outdoors during freezing weather, when other paints might thicken 
or freeze. 
</P>
<P>
	At Niles Chemical, executive vice president and general counsel  
Sherman Drew said Wednesday he had no knowledge of the new lawsuit 
and had no comment. Company officials also have had no comment in 
the past. 
</P>
<P>
	Forest Service spokesman Joe Walsh in Washington said many  
forests already are using a water-based alternative, and the agency 
remains on schedule to phase out the old paint completely by May 
15. 
</P>
<P>
	In the meantime, ``for areas where they have no choice but to  
use the oil-based paint, precautionary measures are being taken to 
protect the workers,'' Walsh said.

<HEADLINE> Studios Spend Millions Wooing Oscar </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Millions of dollars are spent to sway voters.  
Glossy ads deluge newspapers and TV. Backslapping campaign 
officials work the crowds. 
</P>
<P>
	All this effort isn't for the White House -- it's for an Oscar.  
</P>
<P>
	This year's race for the Academy Awards, which officially ended  
Tuesday with the deadline for voters to submit their ballots, has 
been reminiscent of an expensive political campaign. 
</P>
<P>
	With the movies ``Saving Private Ryan'' and ``Shakespeare in  
Love'' locked in what appears to be a tight race for the best 
picture Oscar, the studios have expended enormous time, effort and 
cash to influence Academy Award voters. 
</P>
<P>
	The four studios behind the five movies nominated for best  
picture have so far spent at least $9 million, with DreamWorks and 
Miramax leading the way. 
</P>
<P>
	That works out to $1,600 for each of the 5,557 members of the  
Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences eligible to vote. 
</P>
<P>
	One studio official has had enough and is talking campaign  
reform. 
</P>
<P>
	``I hope the Academy will take a look at this process and get  
involved in some kind of reform,'' said Terry Press, marketing 
chief of DreamWorks, which released ``Saving Private Ryan.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The executive administrator of the Academy isn't holding his  
breath. 
</P>
<P>
	``In my experience that actually hasn't ever come up,'' said Ric  
Robertson. ``I'm not even sure that it would be within our rights 
to try to restrict the amount of money a company spends on 
advertising.'' 
</P>
<P>
	That leaves self-regulation, and there are signs of second  
thoughts. Harvey Weinstein, co-chair of Miramax Films, said in a 
recent interview with The Washington Post that he may reconsider 
his ways next year. 
</P>
<P>
	``Maybe we did go too far,'' he told the Post. ``I hope not.''  
</P>
<P>
	For weeks, DreamWorks has been in a tough marketing battle with  
Miramax, whose ``Shakespeare in Love'' and ``Life is Beautiful'' 
have emerged as contenders with ``Saving Private Ryan.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Academy members are often invited to lavishly catered screenings  
of the film, where studio officials hope to woo undecided voters. 
Souvenirs and soundtracks are offered -- all emblazoned with the 
film's logo. 
</P>
<P>
	Oscar campaign money has flowed more freely this season than it  
has in recent memory, a stark change from last year's relatively 
low-key race when ``Titanic'' rolled over the competition. 
</P>
<P>
	Miramax West Coast President Mark Gill said this year's campaign  
for best picture honors has drawn more attention because of the 
close race. 
</P>
<P>
	``It shouldn't come as any surprise that we're doing this,'' he  
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Exactly how much studios have spent this year is difficult to  
pin down: They are under no obligation to report spending and the 
line between Oscar marketing and larger marketing efforts is often 
blurry. 
</P>
<P>
	Press said DreamWorks spent ``probably double'' what it intended  
on ``Saving Private Ryan'' because of the aggressive campaign by 
Miramax. She declined to provide figures. 
</P>
<P>
	Studio sources put DreamWorks' spending at about $4 million.  
That figure includes print ads, TV commercials and copying and 
mailing special Academy cassettes of ``Saving Private Ryan.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Gramercy Pictures and 20th Century Fox are believed to have  
spent less than $1 million each on their respective campaigns for 
``Elizabeth'' and ``The Thin Red Line.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Miramax sources have placed its Oscar campaign costs for  
``Shakespeare in Love'' at about $2 million and at about $1.3 
million for ``Life is Beautiful,'' with most of the money spent on 
trade ads, travel expenses and videos. 
</P>
<P>
	Another $1.1 million was spent on recent newspaper and  
television advertising for ``Shakespeare in Love'' in New York and 
Los Angeles, with the dual purpose of reaching both Academy voters 
and ticket buyers.

<HEADLINE> Baptist Minister Pleads Guilty </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TAMPA, Fla. (AP) -- Already convicted of state swindling charges,  
the Rev. Henry Lyons pleaded guilty Wednesday to federal tax 
evasion and fraud stemming from his running of the National Baptist 
Convention USA. 
</P>
<P>
	``In 60 or more days the federal and state government will take  
my body and lock it up, but my soul and my mind will never be 
shackled and will always serve God,'' Lyons said afterwards. 
</P>
<P>
	Lyons pleaded guilty to one count of bank fraud, two counts of  
tax evasion, one count of making false statements to a bank officer 
and one count of making false statements to the federal government. 
</P>
<P>
	Originally, the minister had been charged with 54 counts,  
including money laundering, wire fraud and extortion. The remaining 
charges were dropped in return for his guilty plea. 
</P>
<P>
	The charges paralleled a state case in which he was convicted of  
fleecing more than $4 million from companies trying to do business 
with the influential black church organization. 
</P>
<P>
	Lyons' troubles began in July 1997 when his wife set fire to a  
$700,000 waterfront home he owned with another woman, Bernice 
Edwards of Milwaukee. She was a co-defendant at Lyons' trial and 
was acquitted of racketeering charges. She still faces federal 
trial. 
</P>
<P>
	Lyons took money from companies that wanted to do business with  
church members, inflating the number of people belonging to the 
church to lure them in. The companies wanted to sell members 
cemetery products, life insurance policies and credit cards. 
</P>
<P>
	Lyons acknowledged mistakes, said he was truly sorry and willing  
to accept responsibility for the misdeeds that occurred while he 
was leading the convention -- one of the nation's largest, most 
powerful and influential black denominations. 
</P>
<P>
	The plea arrangement came one day after Lyons' tearful  
resignation. He was convicted two weeks ago of state charges of 
racketeering and grand theft. 
</P>
<P>
	Lyons, 57, faces three years to seven years in prison under  
state guidelines for those convictions during sentencing March 31. 
</P>
<P>
	The federal charges carry a total possible sentence of 75 years  
and hefty fines. Under sentencing guidelines, however, he would 
face a much shorter prison term. 
</P>
<P>
	Defense attorneys estimated Lyons would serve about six or seven  
years in prison on the federal charges. Sentencing was set for June 
18.

<HEADLINE> Lear To Buy UT Automotive Division </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Lear Corp., one of the largest suppliers of  
automotive interiors, will pay $2.3 billion for the automotive 
division of United Technologies Corp. 
</P>
<P>
	Lear makes the doors, carpets and seats that go into millions of  
cars and trucks every year. But, until now, Lear was missing one 
piece -- instrument panels. 
</P>
<P>
	``This acquisition of UT Automotive further expands Lear's  
capability in the growing, high-value instrument panel segment, 
particularly in North America,'' Kenneth L. Way, Lear's chairman 
and chief executive, said in a statement Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	United Technologies, a diversified conglomerate that makes  
everything from elevators to aerospace equipment, doesn't have 
enough business to compete in the rapidly consolidating parts 
suppliers industry. 
</P>
<P>
	Across the globe, parts suppliers are snapping up competitors to  
become more integrated so they can offer complete interior systems 
and even research and development expertise to automakers like 
General Motors Corp. and Ford Motor Co. 
</P>
<P>
	``Lear will now have the products and technical abilities to  
provide full-service modules that combine interior systems and 
electrical and electronic components and systems,'' Way said. 
</P>
<P>
	The addition of United Technologies' business will give Lear a  
total of 104,000 employees and sales of $12 billion. It was unclear 
how many jobs, if any, Lear would eliminate. 
</P>
<P>
	A Lear spokeswoman said Lear was focusing on the integration of  
the unit and declined to comment on any possible job losses. 
</P>
<P>
	The deal must be approved by federal regulators but the  
companies expect it to be completed by the summer. 
</P>
<P>
	Lear's acquisition spree and rapid growth have raised the  
eyebrows of some analysts who are concerned about Lear's debt load 
and its ability to manage so many different businesses on different 
continents. 
</P>
<P>
	``Lear is coming off a very difficult year and they are taking  
on a whole lot of debt,'' said Michael Schmall, managing partner 
for the Planning Edge, an automotive consulting firm. ``They better 
make sure they are able to integrate UT quickly or they could have 
problems down the road, especially when the industry slows.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The announcement came after the stock market closed. Shares of  
Lear, which is based in Southfield, Mich., closed up $1.25 at 
$36.37 1/2 on the New York Stock Exchange. Shares of United 
Technologies, which is based in Hartford, Conn., ended up 25 cents 
at $129.62 1/2, also on the Big Board.

<HEADLINE> NCAA Investigating UNLV </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LAS VEGAS (AP) -- UNLV's basketball program is under  
investigation once again, this time reportedly for allegations that 
an assistant coach gave money to make car payments on behalf of 
former player Tyrone Nesby. 
</P>
<P>
	It is the latest problem for UNLV coach Bill Bayno, whose team  
is in disarray following a season that began with high expectations 
but ended with a first-round loss in the NIT. 
</P>
<P>
	Three players said this week they are planning to leave the team  
and transfer to other schools, and the fourth-year coach has been 
bombarded with criticism from fans who blame the coach for the 
team's lackluster season. 
</P>
<P>
	NCAA investigators were on campus this week to conduct an  
informal review of allegations that associate head coach Glynn 
Cyprien gave a former student manager money to make car payments on 
Nesby's behalf. 
</P>
<P>
	Bayno said he was confident there had been no wrongdoing in his  
program. 
</P>
<P>
	``I know for a fact I have done nothing wrong to recruit the  
kids in my program,'' Bayno said. ``I've always abided by the 
rules. I will cooperate fully with the NCAA and I'm confident that 
everything will be fine.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Mike Viellion, an international business major who once was a  
student manager for the basketball team, also said Cyprien loaned 
Viellion's 1995 Ford Thunderbird without his permission during the 
summer to another player, Kaspars Kambala, and that Kambala 
subsequently was involved in an accident that totaled the car. 
</P>
<P>
	Viellion said that four times during the 1997-98 basketball  
season, Cyprien gave him money out of his own pocket. Viellion said 
he was instructed to take the money to a car-leasing agency, which 
he declined to name, and make payments for Nesby, who is now an NBA 
rookie playing for the Los Angeles Clippers. Viellion said he could 
not recall the exact amount, but it was between $300 and $400. 
</P>
<P>
	Viellion also said he was a go-between for Bayno and Nesby in  
picking up loaner cars Bayno had arranged for Nesby when the 
player's car was out of commission. 
</P>
<P>
	A university is forbidden under NCAA rules from providing a  
benefit for a student-athlete that it would not provide for every 
other student. 
</P>
<P>
	``The truth will come out,'' Bayno said. ``He's trying to blow  
up the program and I don't know why.'' 
</P>
<P>
	One of the players questioned by the NCAA, guard Greedy Daniels,  
is one of three UNLV players who have said they probably won't 
return next season. 
</P>
<P>
	Daniels said he has not made a final decision, and has not yet  
asked to be released from his scholarship or for a transfer 
release. Daniels, a sophomore, has been upset about a lack of 
playing time. 
</P>
<P>
	Freshmen Desmond Herod and Chris Richardson have said they will  
not return next season.

<HEADLINE> NTSB Reviewing 737 Safety Fixes </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- When a MetroJet 737 started to roll  
unexpectedly in flight last month, the pilots quickly regained 
control, but the incident raised doubts about recent modifications 
of the world's mostly widely used airliner. 
</P>
<P>
	Now the members of the National Transportation Safety Board are  
divided over whether to recommend wholesale rudder changes that 
could cost the airlines up to $100 million, or live with the 
modifications that already have been made. 
</P>
<P>
	The MetroJet was flying with the new equipment, raising concerns  
about its effectiveness. 
</P>
<P>
	One high-level NTSB official, speaking on the condition of  
anonymity, said the ``tweaks'' previously ordered by the Federal 
Aviation Administration have not solved anything. 
</P>
<P>
	A resolution may come next week when the five-member NTSB meets  
to settle on the probable cause of the September 1994 crash of 
USAir Flight 427. That Boeing 737 inexplicably spiraled into a 
ravine outside Pittsburgh after a flight from Chicago. All 132 
aboard were killed. 
</P>
<P>
	The board also may discuss three other incidents: The 1991 crash  
of a United Airlines 737 on approach to Colorado Springs, Colo., a 
flight control disturbance to an Eastwind 737 on approach to 
Richmond, Va., in 1996, and flight control problems with a United 
Airlines 737 before takeoff from Seattle on Feb. 19. 
</P>
<P>
	In the aftermath of the USAir crash, the NTSB, the FAA and  
Boeing Co. opened an investigation that surpassed the TWA Flight 
800 inquiry in length and will likely run second to it in terms of 
cost. 
</P>
<P>
	All three entities agree that the rudder on the USAir plane, a  
control surface that runs up the tail and aims the nose left and 
right, went to its full left position shortly after the plane flew 
through the wake of an aircraft ahead of it. 
</P>
<P>
	They disagree about what sent the plane into its 6,000-foot  
plunge. 
</P>
<P>
	Boeing points to the two-man flight crew, saying they held the  
left rudder pedal to the floor as they tried to regain control. 
</P>
<P>
	``Experienced crews do not always respond to flight path upsets  
in a predictable or routine manner, particularly when they are 
suddenly surprised,'' the Seattle-based company said in a 
submission to the safety board. 
</P>
<P>
	Some investigators believe the rudder control reversed itself,  
so a pilot pressing on the right pedal to straighten the nose would 
have unknowingly held the rudder in the wrong position. 
</P>
<P>
	The FAA believes the answer will never be known. Instead, it is  
relying on three mandatory changes made in the aftermath of the 
crash: a redesign of the rudder's hydraulic control unit to prevent 
rudder reversal; new training for crews in handling turbulence; and 
a reduction in the amount of rudder a pilot can apply in high-risk 
situations. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have attempted to cover all potential scenarios because  
there isn't conclusive evidence to identify any one of them,'' said 
Thomas McSweeny, associate FAA administrator for regulation and 
certification. 
</P>
<P>
	Safety board officials aren't so sure. While they don't have the  
power to require changes, their recommendations are widely 
publicized and are likely to resonate with the public. The 737 is 
the most common passenger jet, with nearly 3,000 worldwide. 
Southwest Airlines, the popular discount carrier, has an all-737 
fleet. 
</P>
<P>
	According to those familiar with a draft report of the safety  
board's conclusions in the USAir crash, one potential 
recommendation is to install dual power-control devices in older 
737s. 
</P>
<P>
	Currently the planes have two primary rudder control systems  
that merge in a single hydraulic device the size of a soda can that 
is known as the power control unit. Boeing and the FAA redesigned 
the unit in the aftermath of the Pittsburgh crash and required 
airlines to install it by August. 
</P>
<P>
	Switching to a dual control system would require new hydraulic  
and electrical rigging that could harm other aircraft systems. 
Aviation analysts also say it could cost from $60 million to $100 
million and create considerable aircraft downtime. 
</P>
<P>
	A more benign recommendation would be to create redundancy in  
the rudder control system, which some say already has been 
accomplished by the existing modifications. 
</P>
<P>
	Supporters of that approach note that the 737 has more than 90  
million flight hours, yet only a limited number of incidents 
traceable to the rudder. 
</P>
<P>
	The MetroJet incident raised fresh concerns, however. The plane,  
flown by the discount subsidiary of the renamed US Airways, started 
to roll while cruising at 33,000 feet from Orlando, Fla., to 
Hartford, Conn. 
</P>
<P>
	Using training adopted in the aftermath of the Flight 427 crash,  
the pilots regained control of the aircraft and landed safely in 
Baltimore. 
</P>
<P>
	Among the concerns, according to the top NTSB official:  
</P>
<P>
	--The MetroJet rudder moved 8.5 degrees off center, perhaps  
indicating a new rudder control problem. 
</P>
<P>
	--The pilots regained control only after switching to backup  
systems and rebalancing engine power, an achievable task at cruise 
altitude but more complicated in the harried moments before 
landing. 
</P>
<P>
	--The power control unit in the MetroJet, which was updated to  
the post-USAir design, showed no problems, which may indicate a 
hidden flaw or problems elsewhere in the rudder system.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Gets Access to N.Korea Site </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- North Korea wanted $300 million for access to a  
suspect nuclear site -- and settled for super potatoes. 
</P>
<P>
	North Korean Vice Foreign Minister Kim Gye Gwan said his  
government was ``very happy'' with Tuesday's agreement. He might 
have good reason in addition to the spuds. 
</P>
<P>
	In the deal, the United States agreed that in return for the  
right to inspect the Kumchang-ni underground site, it would help 
North Korea increase potato yields as a step ``to improve political 
and economic relations between the two countries.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Food shortages and famine-related illnesses have killed up to 2  
million of North Korea's 23 million people during the past three 
years, according to U.S. congressional estimates. 
</P>
<P>
	While insisting food donations would not be part of any deal,  
the United States last year -- while negotiations were under way -- 
pledged 500,000 tons of additional food aid to North Korea in 
response to an appeal for donations by the U.N. World Food Program. 
</P>
<P>
	Not all of the 500,000 tons has been delivered, but a U.S.  
official said the reamining amount would be shipped to North Korea. 
</P>
<P>
	The World Food Program is seeking 200,000 additional tons in  
unfulfilled pledges made last year by other countries and the 
Clinton administration is considering that request, said the 
official, who spoke in Washington on condition of anonymity. 
</P>
<P>
	South Korean media, quoting unidentified South Korean Foreign  
Ministry sources today, said Washington agreed to give an 
additional 600,000 tons of food and ease economic sanctions against 
the communist state. 
</P>
<P>
	The World Food Program is expected to issue another worldwide  
appeal in June after an assessment of North Korea's needs this 
Spring. 
</P>
<P>
	Henry Sokolski, executive director of The Nonproliferation  
Policy Education Center in Washington, said the 500,000 tons of 
grain will cost U.S. taxpayers $165 million annually -- ``well more 
than the $300 million.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``It appears that we are pouring good U.S. food aid down a North  
Korean hole,'' said House International Relations Committee 
Chairman Benjamin Gilman, R-N.Y. 
</P>
<P>
	He supported the agreement but said it ``smacks of a `food for  
access' deal, which could lead to further provocative actions on 
the part of the North Koreans to extort further concessions from 
the U.S.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The United States is also supplying Pyongyang with nearly half  
of its heavy oil under a 1994 agreement to freeze what Washington 
believed was North Korea's promising nuclear weapons program. 
</P>
<P>
	Sokolski questioned what the United States will get from the  
latest deal since North Korea is reportedly working on making 
weapons-usable uranium with centrifuges and has had almost a year 
to ``clean out'' the suspect Kumchang-ni underground site. 
</P>
<P>
	He also noted in a statement that the Defense Department has  
reportedly singled out 12 other sites it would like to visit. 
</P>
<P>
	``The agreement we've reached addresses all of our concerns, and  
it will enable us both to confirm and monitor the current and 
future use of the suspect site,'' Secretary of State Madeleine 
Albright said in a statement. 
</P>
<P>
	Since last August, the United States has pressed for access to  
the Kumchang-ni site. U.S. officials believe North Korea may be 
developing nuclear weapons at the site in violation of the 1994 
accord.

<HEADLINE> 6 Retailers Settle Charges With FTC </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Wal-Mart, Burlington Coat Factory, Bugle Boy  
and several other clothing manufacturers and retailers have agreed 
to clearly state the origin of textile products in their Internet 
catalogs, after government regulators found them in violation of 
disclosure laws. 
</P>
<P>
	The Federal Trade Commission, which announced the agreements  
Tuesday, alleged that the companies did not comply with laws 
requiring mail-order catalogs, including those distributed 
electronically, to list whether a textile item was made in the 
United States, was imported, or is a combination. 
</P>
<P>
	The statutes also mandate that textile and woolen goods have  
labels listing fiber content, country of origin and the identity of 
any second party hired to market or handle the items. 
</P>
<P>
	According to the commission, these companies violated laws that  
make it a crime to sell or advertise misbranded products with 
online promotional materials: Wal-Mart Stores Inc., Burlington Coat 
Factory Warehouse Corp., Delia's Inc., Woolrich Inc., Gottschalks 
Inc. and Bugle Boy Industries. The FTC reached a settlement with 
Abercrombie &AMP; Fitch for alleged violations in its print catalog. 
</P>
<P>
	Bentonville, Ark.-based Wal-Mart said any infringement of  
disclosure laws was inadvertent. 
</P>
<P>
	``Wal-Mart is now taking steps to ensure continued compliance,  
including training new associates and making existing associates 
aware of the law,'' the company said in a statement. 
</P>
<P>
	Bugle Boy Industries said it was unaware until October that the  
FTC had extended its country-of-origin requirements to the Internet 
and took corrective action immediately. 
</P>
<P>
	Under the agreement, the companies also are subject to record  
keeping and reporting requirements to help the FTC monitor 
compliance.

<HEADLINE> Fresno State Re-signs Tarkanian </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	FRESNO, Calif. (AP) -- Jerry Tarkanian, yet to get Fresno State  
into the NCAA tournament after four years on the job, signed a 
one-year contract extension on Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Tarkanian's four-year contract with Fresno State ended this  
season. 
</P>
<P>
	``We didn't get the job done. We didn't do what we hoped to  
do,'' Tarkanian said, referring of being left out of the NCAA 
tournament despite a 21-12 record. 
</P>
<P>
	The contract allows Fresno State to keep Tarkanian through the  
1999-2000 season, with another possible extension through 2001. 
</P>
<P>
	Athletic director Al Bohl declined to release details of the  
contract. 
</P>
<P>
	Tarkanian, who had much greater success while coaching at UNLV,  
including a national championship, has had his share of controversy 
with Fresno State. 
</P>
<P>
	The program came under fire two years ago when the FBI began  
investigating allegations of point shaving by players. The case 
continues. 
</P>
<P>
	Last year, center Avondre Jones and recruit Kenny Brunner were  
arrested on charges of beating an acquaintance with Samurai swords 
just hours after an NIT game. 
</P>
<P>
	Most serious charges against Jones were dismissed. He began  
serving six months in jail earlier this month for possession of a 
firearm, two misdemeanor counts of brandishing a weapon and 
misdemeanor possession of marijuana. A judge dismissed the charges 
against Brunner. 
</P>
<P>
	Tarkanian, well-known for gnawing on a towel during games, is  
also known for winning. He hit a milestone last season by becoming 
the 12th college coach to win 700 games. 
</P>
<P>
	With a 710-169 record in a 28-year career, Tarkanian's 80.8  
winning percentage ranks fourth in college basketball history and 
is best among active coaches. His Bulldogs have had four straight 
20-win seasons, reaching the NIT semifinals last season. 
</P>
<P>
	But he's not satisfied.  
</P>
<P>
	``Our team won 21 games this year, but I don't feel we have  
accomplished our goals just yet,'' Tarkanian said. ``We want to get 
Fresno State to the NCAA tournament and get the program back on 
track.''

<HEADLINE> Government Breaks Up Visa Ring </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Twenty-nine people have been arrested by  
authorities who say they have broken up a forgery ring that helped 
Iranians and others acquire visas and asylum in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
	The group allegedly provided new identities to clients, some of  
whom included members of the Mujahedeen Khalq, an Iranian 
opposition group based in Iraq, U.S. Attorney Alejandro Mayorkas 
said. The group is one of 30 designated as terrorist organizations 
by the State Department. 
</P>
<P>
	The People's Mojahedin Organization, a member of the coalition  
National Council of Resistance of Iran, denied any involvement in 
the forgery ring. 
</P>
<P>
	``The Mojahedin have always functioned within the law of the  
country in which they have activity and are not, and have never 
been engaged in illegal deeds,'' the group said in a statement. 
</P>
<P>
	The alleged ringleader, Bahram Tabatabai, was one of those  
arrested. None have been charged with involvement in terrorism, 
though all remained in custody late Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Tabatabai allegedly represented more than 300 people during  
asylum interviews before the Immigration and Naturalization 
Service. Authorities would not say how many successfully gained 
entry into the country. 
</P>
<P>
	Sixteen people were indicted for their involvement in the ring,  
although only 15 were arrested -- one was out of the country, said 
Thom Mrozek, a spokesman for the U.S. attorney's office. Another 14 
were arrested for being in the country illegally and will be 
deported. 
</P>
<P>
	David Zebley, an agent for the State Department's Bureau of  
Diplomatic Security, said Tabatabai pretended to be a Farsi 
translator at the hearings, enabling him to change answers given by 
clients to the INS officers. 
</P>
<P>
	Zebley said Tabatabai used a network of fake document suppliers.  
The sources allegedly provided documents including birth 
certificates, titles for automobiles, houses, land and businesses, 
letters from guarantors, passports, employment records, bank 
records and university diplomas. 
</P>
<P>
	In some cases, Tabatabai created new identities for clients who  
had criminal records or ties to subversive organizations, agents 
said. When asylum was requested, they allegedly invented stories of 
political oppression in their homeland, usually Iran. 
</P>
<P>
	Clients, the majority of them Iranians, allegedly were charged a  
minimum of $2,000 for Tabatabai's services. Those who got visas had 
to pay between $8,000 and $12,000, Zebley said.

heavily Wednesday on the New York Stock Exchange, Nasdaq Stock 
Market, and American Stock Exchange. 

</P>
<P>
                               *NYSE    	

</P>
<P>
 *Frontier Corp. rose 5 7/8 to 50 1/2.  
</P>
<P>
 *Global Crossing Ltd. fell 4 3/8 to 47 1/8 in Nasdaq trading. 
</P>
<P>
	Global Crossing, of Bermuda, is buying the larger U.S. telephone  
company Frontier Corp. for about $11.2 billion in stock. 

</P>
<P>
 *Rite Aid fell 1 1/8 to 23 5/8.    	
</P>
<P>
	A class-action lawsuit was filed Tuesday on behalf of investors.  
The complaint alleges that Rite-Aid issued a series false 
statements and withheld information about its operating results and 
business prospects, driving the drugstore operator's stock higher. 
Since the information was disclosed in early March, the stock has 
dropped sharply. 

</P>
<P>
 *Saks Inc. fell 1 1/2 to 27 7/16.    	
</P>
<P>
	Fourth-quarter operating earnings were 97 cents a share, on  
target with estimates. But Saks estimated 1999 earnings at between 
$2.10 and $2.25 per share, while analysts have been predicting 
$2.20 a share. 

</P>
<P>
 *Eli Lilly fell 5 5/16 to 88 3/4.    	
</P>
<P>
	Lilly fell after SG Cowen lowered its earnings estimate for the

is the target of a takeover, according to traders and arbitragers. 

</P>
<P>
 *Williams-Sonoma Inc. fell 7 to 29.    	
</P>
<P>
	Analysts attributed the decline to the surprise retirement of  
the company's administrative chief, Dennis Chantland, to pursue 
``personal interests and goals.'' The company's fourth-quarter net 
earnings of 75 cents a share missed analysts' expectations by a 
penny.The company wasn't immediately available to comment..

Merrill said, could be important foundations of businesses' 
electronic commerce applications. 

</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
	Chief financial officer Ken Ruggiero said he was ``comfortable''  
InterVu would post its first profit in the 2000 first quarter, as

<HEADLINE> Simpson Does Ads for Lawyer's Group </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- O.J. Simpson said he agreed to do television  
ads for a lawyer's group because he feels many people accused of 
crimes don't have decent lawyers. 
</P>
<P>
	``The main thing I have learned is you can't walk into a  
courtroom without competent legal representation,'' Simpson said in 
a telephone interview Wednesday with The Associated Press. 
</P>
<P>
	But some feel a referral from Simpson will carry dubious weight.  
</P>
<P>
	``The message is not bad, but people may have problems with the  
messenger,'' said Laurie Levenson, dean of Loyola University Law 
School. 
</P>
<P>
	Simpson said the idea of doing commercials for Justice Media, a  
lawyer referral service, came from a friend he would not identify. 
He said the money he was paid ``just covered my expenses.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Justice Media plans to sell the commercials to law firms across  
the country. 
</P>
<P>
	Stephen Jackson, a lawyer for the referral service, told USA  
Today that the ad campaign will be aimed at the minority community 
and that they believe Simpson will be an attractive spokesman. 
</P>
<P>
	Simpson, the football Hall of Famer and Hertz spokesman, said he  
was grateful he had the money to hire the best lawyers in the 
business for his 1994 criminal trial. 
</P>
<P>
	He was acquitted on charges of murdering ex-wife Nicole Brown  
Simpson and her friend, Ronald Goldman. Simpson was found liable 
for the deaths of Ms. Simpson and Goldman in a subsequent civil 
trial and was ordered to pay $33.5 million in damages. 
</P>
<P>
	Any income he receives can be seized by the estate of Ms.  
Simpson and the Goldman family to satisfy the judgment. 
</P>
<P>
	Asked if he has any new evidence that might help convince the  
public of his innocence, he said, ``I'm working on it.''

<HEADLINE> American Hurt by Pilots' Sickout </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DALLAS (AP) -- AMR Corp., the parent company of American  
Airlines, estimated Wednesday that the disagreement with pilots 
over the acquisition of Reno Air cost the company about $200 
million to $255 million in pretax earnings during the first 
quarter. 
</P>
<P>
	The cancellation of more than 6,600 flights over a 10-day period  
in February, and the lost bookings that followed, will result in 
earnings per share well below the current Wall Street consensus. 
Analysts surveyed by First Call Corp. had been projecting 65 cents 
a share, while AMR said it would be more in the range of 30 to 35 
cents. 
</P>
<P>
	``Unfortunately, a quarter that looked like it would come in  
generally in line with analyst expectations has been dramatically 
impacted by the job action,'' said Gerard J. Arpey, AMR's chief 
financial officer. 
</P>
<P>
	The Allied Pilots Association had insisted in negotiations that  
its contract with the airline forces American to pay higher wages 
to the Reno pilots and those American pilots who are due promotions 
when the regional airline was purchased in December. American had 
said it will bring the pilots up to the contract rate as soon as 
each pilot is retrained -- a process that could take a year. 
</P>
<P>
	About 25 percent of the company's pilots called in sick to work  
until U.S. District Judge Joe Kendall of Dallas issued a temporary 
restraining order against the union. Kendall also found the union 
and two of its leaders in contempt of court for not encouraging the 
pilots to return to work immediately after his order. 
</P>
<P>
	The judge ordered the union to post $10 million bond -- and the  
leaders to post a total of $15,000 -- against potential 
contempt-of-court fines. He is scheduled to consider damages on 
April 12. 
</P>
<P>
	The union and company have since agreed to hold bargaining  
sessions and participate in mediated talks if necessary. The 
company declined to comment on any progress on Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	APA leadership has been holding meetings with pilots at their  
largest bases this week. Gregg Overman, a spokesman for the union, 
said he doesn't have the financial information to dispute or 
confirm AMR's damage claims, but APA does take issue with the 
company's ``characterization'' of the sickout. 
</P>
<P>
	``Our position was and is that it was a legal job action,'' said  
Overman. 
</P>
<P>
	Also on Wednesday, AMR announced the company will repurchase up  
to $500 million of its common stock, bringing the total of AMR's 
repurchase program since 1997 to $2.6 billion. 
</P>
<P>
	``While our first quarter financial results will be adversely  
impacted by the recent Allied Pilots Association job action, we 
believe the company is well positioned for long-term success,'' 
said chairman and chief executive Donald Carty. 
</P>
<P>
	Shares of AMR fell $1.93 3/4 to $59.06 1/4 on the New York Stock  
Exchange.

<HEADLINE> Bond Prices Fall in Quiet Trading / Bonds  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Bond prices fell in a quiet session Wednesday,  
breaking a three-day winning streak. 
</P>
<P>
	The price of the benchmark 30-year Treasury bond fell 5/16  
point, or $3.13 per $1,000 in face value. Its yield, which moves in 
the opposite direction, rose to 5.50 percent from 5.47 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	In the broader market, prices of short-term Treasury securities  
were down between 1/32 point and 1/16 point, and intermediate 
maturities were off 1/16 point to 3/32 point, reported Bridge 
Telerate, a financial information service. 
</P>
<P>
	The Lehman Brothers Daily Treasury Bond Index, reflecting price  
movements on bonds with maturities of a year or longer, fell 1.67 
points to 1,290.70. 
</P>
<P>
	Yields on three-month Treasury bills were 4.51 percent as the  
discount fell 0.02 percentage point to 4.40 percent. Six-month 
yields were 4.64 percent, as the discount fell 0.02 percentage 
point to 4.47 percent. One-year yields were 4.71 percent as the 
discount fell by 0.01 percentage point from Tuesday to 4.49 
percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Yields are the interest bonds pay by maturity, while the  
discount is the interest at which they are sold. 
</P>
<P>
	The federal funds rate, the interest on overnight loans between  
banks, fell to 4.75 percent from 4.81 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	In the tax-exempt market, the Bond Buyer index of 40 actively  
traded municipal bonds rose to 124 31/32 fom 124 29/32. The average 
yield to maturity fell to 5.18 percent from 5.19 percent.

<HEADLINE> Arum Urges Open Scoring of Fights </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LAS VEGAS (AP) -- Promoter Bob Arum wants boxing fans to be able  
to see after each round how boxing judges are scoring a fight. 
</P>
<P>
	Arum said Wednesday he will propose to Nevada boxing officials  
that the scoring of the May 8 WBC super bantamweight title fight 
between Erik Morales and Wayne McCullough be announced at the end 
of each round. 
</P>
<P>
	``People should know how a fight is being scored as it goes  
along,'' Arum said. ``Boxing is the only sport that doesn't reveal 
the score as it happens.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Nevada Athletic Commission would have to approve the  
proposal before it is put into effect. Commission executive 
director Marc Ratner said if Arum files a formal proposal, it would 
be put before the commission. 
</P>
<P>
	Arum's proposal comes in the wake of Saturday night's  
controversial draw between Evander Holyfield and Lennox Lewis in a 
fight Lewis appeared to dominate. 
</P>
<P>
	``If it doesn't work, it doesn't work,'' Arum said. ``I think we  
need to find out.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Arum conceded that judges could be influenced by the scoring of  
other judges if it is put up after every round. But he said that 
could actually help even out the judging. 
</P>
<P>
	``If two judges are scoring a fight one way and one the other  
way, I think the official would figure out he or she was doing 
something wrong,'' Arum said.

<HEADLINE> Fed's Regional Economic Conditions </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	Summaries of regional economic conditions before March 8,  
compiled by the 12 regional banks of the Federal Reserve: 
</P>
<P>
	BOSTON -- Economic activity continues to expand. ... Retailers  
see ongoing strong consumer demand, while manufacturing results are 
mixed. For the most part, prices are ... steady and wages growing 
moderately. 
</P>
<P>
	NEW YORK -- The ... economy continues to grow at a brisk pace  
with only scattered signs of price pressures. Retailers report that 
sales were above plan ... with somewhat less discounting than last 
year on winter clearance merchandise. ... The housing market has 
retained strong upward momentum. ... Purchasing managers report a 
rebound in manufacturing. ... Final costs of most goods and 
services remain stable. 
</P>
<P>
	PHILADELPHIA -- Business conditions ... generally improved. ...  
Manufacturing shipments and orders increased. Retail sales exceeded 
year-ago and prior month results. Auto sales have also increased. 
... Sales of both new and existing homes have been rising strongly. 
</P>
<P>
	CLEVELAND -- The ... economy is still growing, although somewhat  
unevenly by industry. Labor markets remain tight and reports of 
wage increases are growing. ... Temporary employment agencies were 
unable to keep pace with demand. 
</P>
<P>
	RICHMOND -- Economic activity continued to advance at a healthy  
pace. ... Retailers reported robust sales ... but services 
providers gave mixed reports. In manufacturing, shipments rose 
modestly. ... Real estate activity ... continued upbeat. ... Labor 
markets tightened, although wage increases remained moderate. 
Prices changed little in manufacturing and rose only slightly in 
the services sector. 
</P>
<P>
	ATLANTA -- The ... economy continued to post moderate growth. ...  
Although merchants' reports on sales have been mixed, most expect 
improvement. ... Residential construction and sales weakened a 
little. ... Factory production has been sluggish in sectors 
primarily affected by foreign imports, but other sectors are adding 
to payrolls. ... Tight labor markets are adversely impacting 
high-tech employers. ... Prices are expected to hold steady over 
the next few months. 
</P>
<P>
	CHICAGO -- The ... economy continued to expand modestly in early  
1999, despite weakness in some of the region's mainstay industries. 
Consumer spending remained strong. ... Home sales slowed somewhat 
... but overall construction activity remained brisk. Manufacturing 
activity was mixed. ... Worker shortages persisted ... and there 
were a few new reports of increasing wages in entry-level 
positions. 
</P>
<P>
	ST. LOUIS -- The ... economy is still operating at a high level  
and growing moderately. Weakness in the agricultural sector is the 
only notable exception. The district's position as a distribution 
center continues to solidify, as UPS and FedEx attract more 
businesses to their hubs. ... Auto production is expected to 
increase because of a new line at a Ford plant. ... Firms ... have 
upped their hiring expectations significantly. 
</P>
<P>
	MINNEAPOLIS -- Business activity has picked up from the strong  
conditions reported at the beginning of the year, although 
natural-resource based industries remain in the doldrums. ... The 
forward momentum continues for construction, consumer spending and 
manufacturing. Low commodity prices continue to depress farm 
income, curb iron mining and stall oil exploration. Businesses 
would like to hire additional workers and are raising wages to 
attract them. 
</P>
<P>
	KANSAS CITY -- The ... economy continued to grow moderately. ...  
Retail sales again posted solid gains, and manufacturing registered 
its first improvement in months. Construction activity eased 
slightly. ... Energy activity declined as prices took another turn 
for the worse. ... Labor markets remained very tight 
</P>
<P>
	... with wage pressures -- especially in the construction sector  
-- increasing somewhat. ... Prices remained flat at the retail 
level. 
</P>
<P>
	DALLAS -- The ... economy continued to expand ... with some  
sectors reporting stronger activity. ... Retailers said sales 
growth was stronger than expected, and some manufacturing sectors 
reported improved sales. Real estate activity picked up. ... (Oil) 
drilling activity continued to plunge. ... Many farmers and 
ranchers (are) still in serious financial jeopardy after last 
summer's drought and low commodity prices. 
</P>
<P>
	SAN FRANCISCO -- Reports ... indicate strong performance from the  
... economy. ... Sales of retail merchandise and services were 
robust. ... Responses suggest a slight acceleration in ... 
manufacturing activity, although demand in key 
</P>
<P>
	sectors continues to be hampered by adverse trade conditions.  
... Agricultural producers were hindered by weak export demand and 
poor weather. ... Real estate markets and the market for bank 
credit were robust overall. ... Upward price pressures were limited 
overall.

<HEADLINE>  DaimlerChrysler Unveils Concept Car </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- DaimlerChrysler has built a compact car  
powered by fuel cells that seats five people, goes 280 miles before 
refueling and travels as fast as 90 mph. 
</P>
<P>
	The concept car, called Necar 4, is the latest demonstration of  
progress on fuel cell cars as the world's automakers continue their 
race to bring such cars to market by 2004. Fuel cells convert 
hydrogen and oxygen into electricity to power a vehicle. 
</P>
<P>
	The car was formally unveiled today by DaimlerChrysler chairmen  
Robert Eaton and Juergen Schrempp at a press conference attended by 
Environmental Protection Agency officials at the Ronald Reagan 
International Trade Center. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is the next step in a very long journey,'' Eaton said  
after driving the car. ``Our challenge is to provide more 
earth-friendly vehicles without penalty of cost or convenience'' to 
customers. 
</P>
<P>
	The Necar 4, based on the Mercedes-Benz A-class compact car sold  
in Europe, accelerates easily from 0 to 30 and beyond. It can go as 
fast as 90 mph and travels 280 miles without refueling, Chrysler 
said. It also is a zero-emissions vehicle. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is a real step forward,'' said EPA Administrator Carol  
Browner. ``This car leaves a trail of water vapor, not clouds of 
carbon dioxide, nitrous oxide and other pollutants.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Other fuel cell cars have zero or near-zero emissions, depending  
on their fuel source. That makes fuel cells a favorite among 
automakers trying to comply with California's standard of zero 
emissions by 2003 for 10 percent of the cars sold in the state. 
</P>
<P>
	``Fuel cells have the potential to be the most attractive  
alternative propulsion system for the long term,'' said Schrempp. 
</P>
<P>
	But the demise of gas-powered cars is not imminent. Necar 4 is  
powered by liquid hydrogen, an impractical fuel for mass marketing 
since it must be kept at extremely cold temperatures. 
</P>
<P>
	DaimlerChrysler officials said the concept car would be replaced  
with Necar X, which would run on methanol. Methanol contains 
hydrogen and is the auto industry's favored fuel to power fuel 
cells. 
</P>
<P>
	Nationwide use of methanol-powered fuel cells would require a  
network of methanol pumping stations. 
</P>
<P>
	DaimlerChrysler's Ferdinand Panik said Necar 4 was a major  
breakthrough because the fuel cell technology was small enough to 
fit in a compact car. The fuel cells were stacked underneath the 
car's floorboard and the liquid hydrogen tank took up some space in 
its small trunk. 
</P>
<P>
	But DaimlerChrysler engineers say there is still a lot of work  
to be done before next year, when they aim to develop a fleet of 
demonstration cars based on the Necar X. 
</P>
<P>
	For example, the car is 1,100 pounds heavier than an equivalent  
gas-powered car because of the fuel-cell technology. Engineers say 
it must be 660 pounds lighter. 
</P>
<P>
	The fuel cells are also 10 times too expensive, engineers say.  
For example, a mass produced fuel cell car would now cost about 
$30,000 for the fuel cell hardware alone. Today's engines only cost 
about $3,000. 
</P>
<P>
	``Now we are looking to make the technology affordable to every  
consumer,'' Eaton said. 
</P>
<P>
	Other companies -- including Ford Motor, General Motors and Honda  
-- also said they hope to market fuel cell vehicles by 2004. 
</P>
<P>
	Companies are putting hundreds of millions of dollars into  
developing the technology.

International Trade Center. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is the next step in a very long journey,'' Eaton said  
after driving the car. ``Our challenge is to provide more 
earth-friendly vehicles without penalty of cost or convenience'' to 
customers. 
</P>
<P>
	The Necar 4, based on the Mercedes-Benz A-class compact car sold  
in Europe, accelerates easily from 0 to 30 and beyond. It can go as 
fast as 90 mph and travels 280 miles without refueling, Chrysler 
said. It also is a zero-emissions vehicle. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is a real step forward,'' said EPA Administrator Carol  
Browner. ``This car leaves a trail of water vapor, not clouds of 
carbon dioxide, nitrous oxide and other pollutants.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Other fuel cell cars have zero or near-zero emissions, depending  
on their fuel source. That makes fuel cells a favorite among 
automakers trying to comply with California's standard of zero 
emissions by 2003 for 10 percent of the cars sold in the state. 
</P>
<P>
	``Fuel cells have the potential to be the most attractive  
alternative propulsion system for the long term,'' said Schrempp. 
</P>
<P>
	But the demise of gas-powered cars is not imminent. Necar 4 is  
powered by liquid hydrogen, an impractical fuel for mass marketing 
since it must be kept at extremely cold temperatures. 
</P>
<P>
	DaimlerChrysler officials said the concept car would be replaced  
with Necar X, which would run on methanol. Methanol contains 
hydrogen and is the auto industry's favored fuel to power fuel 
cells. 
</P>
<P>
	Nationwide use of methanol-powered fuel cells would require a  
network of methanol pumping stations. 
</P>
<P>
	DaimlerChrysler's Ferdinand Panik said Necar 4 was a major  
breakthrough because the fuel cell technology was small enough to 
fit in a compact car. The fuel cells were stacked underneath the 
car's floorboard and the liquid hydrogen tank took up some space in 
its small trunk. 
</P>
<P>
	But DaimlerChrysler engineers say there is still a lot of work  
to be done before next year, when they aim to develop a fleet of 
demonstration cars based on the Necar X. 
</P>
<P>
	For example, the car is 1,100 pounds heavier than an equivalent  
gas-powered car because of the fuel-cell technology. Engineers say 
it must be 660 pounds lighter. 
</P>
<P>
	The fuel cells are also 10 times too expensive, engineers say.  
For example, a mass produced fuel cell car would now cost about 
$30,000 for the fuel cell hardware alone. Today's engines only cost 
about $3,000. 
</P>
<P>
	``Now we are looking to make the technology affordable to every  
consumer,'' Eaton said. 
</P>
<P>
	Other companies -- including Ford Motor, General Motors and Honda  
-- also said they hope to market fuel cell vehicles by 2004. 
</P>
<P>
	Companies are putting hundreds of millions of dollars into  
developing the technology.

	Feds Probe Amtrak Accident  
</P>
<P>
	BOURBONNAIS, Ill. (AP) -- Federal investigators said today they  
are looking into whether the driver of a semitrailer drove around a 
crossing barrier in an attempt to beat an oncoming train, causing 
the nation's deadliest railroad accident in three years. At least 
11 people were killed and more than 100 injured in Monday night's 
accident, federal officials said today, lowering the death toll 
from 13. Meanwhile, National Transportation Safety Board member 
John Goglia said the agency was frustrated with Amtrak's delays in 
getting accurate information about passengers to investigators.

	Hale Takes Plea Bargain in Sex Case  
</P>
<P>
	FORT LEWIS, Wash. (AP) -- A retired Army general will plead  
guilty to charges involving sexual improprieties with the wives of 
subordinates in exchange for a reduced sentence. Maj. Gen. David 
Hale, who was allowed to retire honorably in February 1998 after 
the allegations became public, is the second Army general since 
1952 to submit to a court-martial. Hale faces up to 11 years in 
prison, the loss of his $75,000-a-year pension and dismissal from 
the service. Under the initial 17 charges, he had faced the 
possibility of 56 years in prison if convicted.

if they don't reach a peace agreement with ethnic Albanians. U.S. 
Army Gen. Wesley Clark told a congressional committee that Yugoslav 
President Slobodan Milosevic should realize NATO is ready to strike 
Serb forces if he doesn't make peace or if he uses a new Serb troop 
buildup around Kosovo to launch fresh military actions in violation 
of a cease-fire. Clark's warning came as peace talks continued in 
Paris between Serbs and Kosovar Albanians.

	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Federal Reserve said today that last  
year's economic growth carried over to 1999 with strong consumer 
spending, brisk construction activity and greater demand for labor. 
Despite that, prices of most goods barely changed and businesses 
were reluctant to seek price increases. The combination of growth 
without inflation suggests that Fed policy-makers probably will 
make no changes to interest rates when they meet at March 30.

today. The Tokyo Pipe Band, making its New York debut, received 
applause and encouragement from fellow marchers as they lined up on 
West 44th Street. Other first time marchers included the 10-member 
Irish Galloglas Guard, a unit that has served as bodyguards for

of the primordial material from which the sun and the planets 
formed more than 4 billion years ago. California Institute of 
Technology scientists who tracked the comet found vents spewing a 
volatile mixture of gas and dust into space. The images suggest 
that 15 to 40 percent of the comet's mass is interstellar material. 
Actual proof that comets contain the primordial material of the 
solar system may have to wait until a spacecraft can dig inside 
one.

<HEADLINE> Five Questions With Jeff Beck </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Jeff Beck is a hero to fans and an inspiration  
to musicians. He is described as one of the most important electric 
lead guitarists in rock history. 
</P>
<P>
	His guitar playing -- eclectic and unpredictable -- gave The  
Yardbirds its celebrated futuristic quality after he replaced Eric 
Clapton in 1965. His pioneering experiments with bent notes, 
feedback, fuzz and other distorted amplification influenced 
hundreds of musicians. 
</P>
<P>
	Since leaving The Yardbirds in late 1966, Beck, 54, has crafted  
a successful solo career, moving from blues-based rock to hard rock 
to fusion to techno experiments. 
</P>
<P>
	Beck's new CD ``Who Else!'' celebrates his 34th year on Epic  
Records. The album features 11 new guitar instrumentals. Its styles 
and influences range from techno to blues to Irish traditional 
music. 
</P>
<P>
	He is one of the entertainers who contributed their own versions  
of Beatles songs on a new superstar compilation. Beck takes his 
guitar to ``A Day in the Life.'' The recording, to be called ``In 
My Life,'' will mark the retirement of 70-year-old Beatles producer 
George Martin. 
</P>
<P>
	Beck, whose tour of 25 U.S. cities ends April 18, admits that  
life on the road can be difficult. 
</P>
<P>
	``It takes an average of three hours to unwind after a gig.  
You're still thinking what happened during each number and thinking 
`I must straighten that out.' You can wake up after one hour of 
sleep. You listen to CNN for 10 hours.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Life on the road can also be lonely -- and confining, says Beck,  
who lives in Sussex, England. 
</P>
<P>
	``You can't call anybody because of the time change. You can't  
catch a bus and go home. You're stuck there. It's kind of a prison. 
There are 20 other people there because of you. You can't leave.'' 
</P>
<P>
	1. ``Who Else!'' contains several styles of music. What style  
are you most interested in playing now? 
</P>
<P>
	Beck: I get more kick out of discovering something new on the  
guitar that hasn't been done before than any pattern of previous 
achievement. I'm not likely to do something very predictable 
anyway. Sometimes I do, which in itself will be a contradiction. 
</P>
<P>
	2. Do you prefer to make instrumental albums?  
</P>
<P>
	Beck: If I was to go the singing route, I wouldn't know whom to  
look for. I've been singing Rod Stewart's praises and damning him 
over the years. But nobody hits Rod's spot. Eric Clapton was clever 
enough to teach himself to sing. He supported a career with it. You 
don't want to hear me sing. I have no desire to sing whatsoever. 
</P>
<P>
	2 1/2. How has your playing style changed over the years?  
</P>
<P>
	Beck: I think my playing has changed more in the last eight to  
10 years than the rest of my whole life. Still, I cannot escape 
some Beckisms. I think Beckisms are influences from eastern Europe, 
speedy vibratos, slightly weird intonations. Influences from 
Bulgarian folk music have definitely crept in the last five to 10 
years. I've been in love with Bulgarian village choirs a long time. 
They're so spot on. The music sounds like 12-part harmonies. That 
has crept into my playing style. 
</P>
<P>
	3. Why don't you do more tours? Don't you enjoy it?  
</P>
<P>
	Beck: I do enjoy it. Especially post-35, you start to enjoy  
things more. When you're received well after the first tune, you 
get the feeling, `I haven't wasted my life standing over this 
ridiculous-shaped piece of wood.' After a good gig, there's nothing 
quite like it. The thrill of having somebody enjoy themselves at 
what you've done can't be equaled. It's instant reward. I blame my 
management. They should get me on the road and get me doing smaller 
tours and more often. I don't want to go back home and be retired. 
I haven't come close to burning out. 
</P>
<P>
	4. How would you describe your touring experiences?  
</P>
<P>
	Beck: I have been guilty of dumping bands, in very early days,  
when only five people were on the road. In early days, we tuned up 
and practiced in the back room of a bar. It was pasted together 
very crudely. It has become a highly detailed operation now. It's 
costly if anything goes wrong. 
</P>
<P>
	5. Can you describe one awful thing that has happened on the  
road? 
</P>
<P>
	Beck: On a 46-date summer tour in 1995, after about six weeks,  
in Kansas in 120-degree heat, I was wringing wet before I went on. 
I fainted. It was a dehydrating problem. There was a woman in the 
emergency room who'd been hit over the head with a pistol. I said, 
`Let me go; take her.' They said, `You're sicker than she is.'

<HEADLINE> Debate Opens Over HMO Rights </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Partisan differences over how far Congress  
should go to protect patient rights were on full display Wednesday 
as the year's debate began in earnest over regulating HMOs and 
other managed health care plans. 
</P>
<P>
	Democrats were sure to lose on every major point as  
deliberations began Wednesday in the Senate Health, Education, 
Labor and Pension Committee. The panel was expected to approve a 
GOP-backed bill as soon as Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	President Clinton said the GOP bill ``falls far short'' of  
what's needed. 
</P>
<P>
	``Today represents the first test of whether this new Congress  
is serious about providing Americans with a strong enforceable 
patients' bill of rights to assure quality health care,'' Clinton 
said in a statement. ``I urge the committee to do everything it can 
to pass this test and give Americans the health care protections 
they need.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But Sen. Edward Kennedy, D-Mass., was already looking past the  
committee vote, promising reporters: ``We'll win on the floor of 
the Senate.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Indeed, the committee's deliberations were a good indication of  
the arguments likely to be heard on the Senate floor when the 
legislation is considered this spring. 
</P>
<P>
	The GOP bill would offer a grab bag of popular protections,  
including the right to reasonable emergency room payments, direct 
access to gynecologists for women and prohibition of much-maligned, 
but virtually nonexistent ``gag rules'' that prevent doctors from 
discussing all options with their patients. 
</P>
<P>
	But those protections would be given only to 48 million  
Americans covered by federally regulated health insurance plans. 
Republicans noted that other patients are covered by state 
regulations, and numerous states have adopted many of the same 
provisions. 
</P>
<P>
	At the same time, the GOP bill would cover another 75 million  
people -- all Americans in employer-sponsored health plans -- in a 
key provision that would give patients the right to take disputes 
over payments to an independent group of experts outside the health 
plan. 
</P>
<P>
	Democrats say all Americans should be covered by all of the  
bill's provisions. 
</P>
<P>
	``Millions of Americans should not be held hostage to the hope  
that their state might pass legislation providing these 
protections,'' Clinton said. 
</P>
<P>
	Sen. Christopher Dodd, D-Conn., agreed: ``Your rights ought to  
be guaranteed no matter where you get your insurance.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Democrats also want to give people new rights to sue their  
health plans over bad decisions and to require plans to pay for 
what doctors determine to be ``medically necessary'' care. 
</P>
<P>
	Committee Chairman Jim Jeffords, R-Vt., argued that more  
lawsuits are not needed and emphasized that the GOP bill would add 
hardly anything to health insurance premiums. 
</P>
<P>
	``Our goal,'' Jeffords said, ``is to give Americans the  
protections they want and need in a package they can afford and 
that we can enact.''

<HEADLINE> ANC Member Boesak Guilty of Fraud </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CAPE TOWN, South Africa (AP) -- One of the most visible figures  
of the anti-apartheid struggle was convicted today of stealing 
money from his charity, including donations from singer Paul Simon. 
</P>
<P>
	Allan Boesak was found guilty on four counts of fraud or theft  
totaling $400,000 and acquitted on 23 other charges. He faces an 
unspecified fine or jail term. Arguments in the sentencing phase of 
the trial were set to begin Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	``The accused willingly and unlawfully appropriated the money,''  
Judge John Foxcroft said in declaring Boesak guilty of one count of 
fraud and one of theft in the Simon case. ``He treated the money as 
his own.'' 
</P>
<P>
	After a South African concert tour in 1988, Simon donated the  
equivalent of $200,000 to Boesak's foundation, but Boesak passed on 
only $128,000, the judge said. Foxcroft ruled Boesak had used the 
remainder for his own purposes. 
</P>
<P>
	Foxcroft said trustees and donors had been blinded by Boesak's  
``larger than life personality'' and reputation. 
</P>
<P>
	The judge also said Boesak was guilty of the theft of $226,000  
donated by a Swedish government aid agency. The money was supposed 
to have gone to make voter-education videos but was used instead to 
develop a radio studio to be used by his wife, Elna. 
</P>
<P>
	Boesak was also found guilty of taking $93,000 to help buy  
houses in the upscale Cape Town suburbs of Vredehoek and Constantia 
and giving $4,200 to Elna. 
</P>
<P>
	The defendant stared straight ahead as the judge took almost  
three hours to read through the 27 charges one by one. Afterward, 
Boesak refused to comment to reporters. 
</P>
<P>
	The former head of the World Alliance of Reformed Churches was  
accused of taking more than $300,000 for himself and misusing a 
further $2.42 million donated to the Foundation for Peace and 
Justice charity he headed. 
</P>
<P>
	After court was adjourned, about 30 Boesak supporters chanted  
``Viva Boesak'' from the public gallery and banged their fists on 
its wooden benches. Outside Cape Town's High Court, shouting 
supporters thronged around Boesak and scuffled with photographers 
and cameramen. 
</P>
<P>
	Defense lawyer Mike Maritz said no decision has been made on  
whether to appeal. 
</P>
<P>
	Once a top African National Congress leader in the Cape Town  
area, Boesak played a leading role in the anti-apartheid struggle 
that ended in the country's first all-race elections in 1994. 
</P>
<P>
	He gave up an appointment as ambassador to the United Nations in  
Geneva when the scandal involving his charity emerged. 
</P>
<P>
	An ANC investigation cleared Boesak of wrongdoing, but  
Scandinavian donors criticized the probe and prosecutors later 
filed charges.

<HEADLINE> NJ Police Settle Suit Over Race </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TRENTON, N.J. (AP) -- The New Jersey State Police has agreed to  
pay $225,000 to a black woman who said she was pulled over because 
of her race, beaten and spat at. 
</P>
<P>
	``This was a classic New Jersey State Police profile stop based  
strictly on the type of vehicle and the race of the occupants and 
nothing else,'' said Ronald Sage, a lawyer for Dorothy Cobbs. 
</P>
<P>
	State officials did not admit any wrongdoing in the settlement,  
saying Wednesday's agreement was made to avoid the cost of 
litigation. 
</P>
<P>
	The settlement comes as the state fends off allegations that  
State Police target minority motorists for stops. 
</P>
<P>
	Gov. Christie Whitman recently fired State Police Superintendent  
Carl Williams, who said minorities were responsible for most of the 
state's cocaine and marijuana traffic. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Cobbs, 52, of Wyandanch, N.Y., sued in December alleging  
false arrest, false imprisonment, assault and battery, malicious 
destruction of property and conspiracy to commit perjury. 
</P>
<P>
	She said the mistreatment happened when she was returning from a  
trip to Atlantic City on Jan. 4, 1996, while driving her black 
Porsche. 
</P>
<P>
	She contends Patrick O'Dwyer -- a two-time state trooper of the  
year -- pulled her over saying she had a broken tail light. She says 
O'Dwyer swore at her, grabbed her by the wrist, punched her in the 
face, sprayed her with Mace and later tackled her after she ran 
across the highway to a median. 
</P>
<P>
	After being taken to the State Police barracks, she was slammed  
against a wall, spat at and verbally abused, the lawsuit said. 
</P>
<P>
	O'Dwyer said Ms. Cobbs was driving slowly on the parkway and he  
pulled her over to offer assistance. He said he smelled alcohol on 
her breath and asked her to get out of the car. He said she became 
irate and unruly during questioning.

<HEADLINE> Story Absolves War Vet in Explosion </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Sen. Max Cleland's deepest wound from the  
Vietnam War blast that cost him both legs and an arm has been the 
haunting prospect that it was his own grenade that exploded on that 
fateful day near Khe Sanh. 
</P>
<P>
	But now, 31 years later, a former Marine corporal has come  
forward with a story that absolves the Georgia Democrat of any 
blame for the tragic accident that happened just after his Army 
unit jumped from a helicopter to set up a radio relay station. 
</P>
<P>
	David Lloyd, who says he was one of the first to reach Cleland  
after the explosion, said in an interview Monday that he treated 
another soldier that day who was sobbing uncontrollably, ``It was 
my grenade, it was my grenade.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Lloyd doesn't know the identity of the other solider, but he  
said he was an Army private who had gotten off the helicopter just 
after Cleland and who suffered minor shrapnel wounds in the 
explosion. 
</P>
<P>
	``I put maybe 20 battle dressings on him and the whole time he  
was crying,'' said Lloyd, ``but he wasn't crying from the pain. He 
was crying more from knowing it was his grenade.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Lloyd said he was in Vietnam from November 1967 until November  
1968. The explosion occurred on April 8, 1968, as Cleland reached 
for the grenade he thought had fallen from his belt as he jumped 
from the helicopter. The Marine Corps confirmed today that Lloyd 
was in the Marine Corps from 1966 until 1969, although the actual 
dates of his Vietnam tour were not immediately available. 
</P>
<P>
	Cleland said he met with the Annapolis, Md., man last week,  
viewed pictures and maps he brought back from Vietnam, shared 
battlefield memories and has no reason to doubt his account. 
</P>
<P>
	``It makes more sense than anything I've heard,'' said Cleland,  
who never knew the identity of any of the soldiers or corpsmen who 
came to his aid on the battlefield. 
</P>
<P>
	Cleland never knew for sure where the grenade came from, but he  
said it was ``easy after Vietnam to blame yourself as the victim. 
... What poured salt into my wounds was the possible knowledge that 
it could have been my grenade.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Cleland said he was stunned when Lloyd first called him two  
weeks ago. Lloyd had seen the senator on a cable television show 
relating how he had been saved by Navy corpsmen after a grenade 
that fell from his belt exploded. 
</P>
<P>
	Lloyd said he always knew Cleland was the soldier left crippled  
by the grenade explosion he witnessed, but before the television 
show, he never realized that Cleland didn't know what actually 
happened. 
</P>
<P>
	Lloyd contacted Cleland's office, the two spoke by phone a few  
days later, and then they had lunch together last week. 
</P>
<P>
	``I couldn't believe it,'' said Cleland. ``For 31 years you have  
in your mind a certain set of circumstances that you've pretty much 
come to terms with and all of a sudden a call like this out of the 
blue changes everything for you. ... It sent cold chills down my 
spine, caused me to relive the whole thing.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Cleland said he'd like to meet the soldier Lloyd treated. He  
said he probably was a soldier he didn't know who had joined his 
unit just before they left on the fateful helicopter ride. 
</P>

	``I'd tell him, don't feel guilty,'' said Cleland. ``We were all  
in situations where this could have happened to any of us. Live 
life the best you can, which is what I'm trying to do. There should 
not be any guilt there. It was just a tragic accident.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Cleland said he hopes to get to know Lloyd better, and plans to  
accept his invitation for a fishing trip.

	``The Vietnam War requires a great deal of healing afterwards,''  
he said. ``The deepest wounds and scars we carry are the ones that 
are not visible and I've had a deep wound and scar about this all 
my life. I think this will help me move on to a little deeper 
healing than I was experiencing.''

<HEADLINE> Sosa Angers Stottlemyre With Bows </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MESA, Ariz. (AP) -- Sammy Sosa's new home run bow has Todd  
Stottlemyre bent out of shape. 
</P>
<P>
	``Nobody wants to be embarrassed,'' Stottlemyre said after Sosa  
hit two homers off him Wednesday in the Chicago Cubs' 8-5, 
10-inning loss to the Arizona Diamondbacks. 
</P>
<P>
	``I sure don't remember Mickey Mantle bowing after home runs,''  
Stottlemyre said. ``I guarantee Joe DiMaggio didn't bow. I bet 
everything I got Lou Gehrig didn't, Jackie Robinson, Roberto 
Clemente. Those are great players. Those are guys who paved the way 
for us.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Sosa raised his home run total to seven, the most in spring  
training and two more than his 1999 spring total. He picked up the 
habit of bowing to fans during the All-Star tour of Japan last 
November. 
</P>
<P>
	``They're going to have a lot of opportunities to see me showing  
the bows, showing respect for fans,'' said Sosa, who has hit the 
home runs in just 22 at-bats. 
</P>
<P>
	Sosa, 3-for-17 (.167) against Stottlemyre during the regular  
season with no homers and eight strikeouts. hit a two-run homer to 
right-center in the first and a solo shot to left-center in the 
third. 
</P>
<P>
	Each time he crossed the plate, he stopped after a few steps for  
a crisp bow to the seats. 
</P>
<P>
	``I respect the way he and Mark McGwire put baseball back on the  
map last year,'' Stottlemyre said. ``It's a huge credit to him 
personally.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The bows, however, crossed Stottlemyre's line.  
</P>
<P>
	``I took it as offensive,'' he said. ``I don't bow after a  
strikeout or a win. Just play the game, be professional and move 
on.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Sosa was, well, unbowed.  
</P>
<P>
	``No comment,'' he said when informed of Stottlemyre's remarks.  
The bows, he said, are ``showing respect for all the fans who come 
out here seeing the game.'' 
</P>
<P>
	After hitting 66 homers last year, four short of the record set  
by Mark McGwire, Sosa bulked up during the offseason. He is two 
ahead of McGwire in the meaningless spring training race. 
</P>
<P>
	``I have a gym in my house. I was working out two times a day,''  
Sosa said. 
</P>
<P>
	Did he exercise during his numerous travels, too?  
</P>
<P>
	``I was working out on the plane,'' he joked.  
</P>
<P>
	Stottlemyre, making his fourth spring start, allowed three runs  
and five hits in 2 2-3 innings. 
</P>
<P>
	Cubs starter Kevin Tapani gave up five runs -- four earned -- and  
six hits in 2 1-3 innings. He has an 8.59 ERA in three spring 
starts, allowing seven earned runs in 7 1-3 innings. 
</P>
<P>
	Matt Williams drove in three runs for the Diamondbacks with a  
two-run double in the first and a solo homer in the third. 
</P>
<P>
	Henry Rodriguez hit his fourth homer of the spring, a two-run  
shot in the fifth off Vladimir Nunez. 
</P>
<P>
 *Notes:* Cubs first-base coach Dan Radison was ejected by plate  
umpire Greg Bonin after Scott Stahoviak was called out on strikes 
in the ninth. ... Tony Batista broke a 5-all tie in the 10th with a 
two-run triple off Marc Pisciotta and scored on Dante Powell's 
single. ... Dan Carlson won and Aaron Small got a save. ... Arizona 
placed outfielder Yamil Benitez on unconditional release waivers. 
He hit .199 with nine homers and 30 RBIs last year.

<HEADLINE> Dow Continues Pullback; Off 43.29 / Wall Street Report  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Falling bond prices sent stocks moderately lower  
today, with the Dow Jones industrial average continuing its retreat 
from 10,000. 
</P>
<P>
	At 11 a.m. on Wall Street, the Dow was down 43.29 at 9,887.18,  
or 112 points shy of 10,000. 
</P>
<P>
	Broader stock indicators were lower as well. The Standard &AMP;  
Poor's 500 index was down 9.96 at 1,296.42, while the 
technology-heavy Nasdaq composite index was off 15.37 at 2,423.90. 
</P>
<P>
	The Dow briefly passed 10,000 on Tuesday, climbing to 10,001.78  
just 20 minutes after trading began. But profit-takers descended on 
the market almost immediately, and the Dow ended the day down 28.30 
at 9,930.47, leaving for another day its first close above 10,000. 
</P>
<P>
	The blue-chip index made some headway in the first hour of  
trading today, rising as high as 9,960.71, or less than 40 points 
away from 10,000. But as bond prices backed off, so did the Dow. 
The 30-year Treasury bond was down 1/8 point, pushing its yield to 
5.48 percent from 5.47 percent late Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	``It looks like the Dow is teasing us a little bit,'' said Brian  
Belski, chief investment strategist at George K. Baum &AMP; Co., in 
Kansas City, Missouri. ``With the bond market easing here a little 
bit, the stock market has gotten spooked. But I think it's only a 
matter of time, a few more days or so, that we'll break (higher) 
again.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Declining issues outnumbered advancers by a margin of 3 to 2 on  
the New York Stock Exchange, where volume came to 231.7 million 
shares, down slightly from Tuesday's pace. 
</P>
<P>
	Caterpillar was up 2 15/16 at 46 15/16 after Salomon Smith  
Barney upgraded the stock to ``buy'' from ``neutral.''

<HEADLINE> Panel Supports Military Training </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Most young male and female military recruits  
should keep training together as they do now under Pentagon rules, 
according to congressionally appointed commission whose members 
were split on the recommendation. 
</P>
<P>
	The report, up for discussion today at a House hearing, is  
expected to further fuel debate about whether the sexes should be 
separated in order to cut down on inappropriate fraternization, 
sexual misconduct and harassment. 
</P>
<P>
	Rep. Roscoe Bartlett, R-Md., who has led conservatives  
advocating separate-sex training for recruits, criticized the 
commission and vowed to continue pushing for legislation to 
separate men and women during boot camp. 
</P>
<P>
	``I was disappointed when these commissioners were initially  
selected, believing that many of them did not enter this process 
with an open mind and that many had an agenda that they brought to 
the table,'' Bartlett said in a statement. 
</P>
<P>
	Now, only the Marines Corps separates male and female recruits  
at boot camp. 
</P>
<P>
	Scott Plecs, legislative director for Bartlett, said six  
commission members voted to maintain mixed training in the Army, 
the Air Force and the Navy, three abstained and one voted against 
letting men and women train together militarywide. 
</P>
<P>
	The recommendation by the Commission on Military Training and  
Gender-Related Issues is scheduled to be delivered today during a 
House Armed Service Committee military personnel hearing. The final 
commission recommendation, due this spring, isn't expected to be 
revised, congressional officials said. 
</P>
<P>
	Defense Secretary William Cohen in June announced that male and  
female recruits would continue to train together in the Army, Air 
Force and Navy, but would have to sleep in separate quarters in 
order to provide more privacy. 
</P>
<P>
	It was a compromise decision made after Cohen last year rejected  
the unanimous recommendation by a Pentagon-appointed committee to 
separate recruits by gender during training. Former Sen. Nancy 
Kassebaum Baker, R-Kan., led the panel. 
</P>
<P>
	The House, citing the Kassebaum report, approved legislation  
last year that would have required the Army, Air Force and Navy to 
provide separate basic training for men and women just like the 
Marines. But the bill didn't pass in the Senate. 
</P>
<P>
	The Defense Department review came after a series of sex  
scandals involving trainees and drill instructors, particularly at 
Aberdeen Training Ground, Md. 
</P>
<P>
	Women make up about 14 percent of the military, a figure Cohen  
cited in arguing that men and women should learn from basic 
training on how to work side by side. 
</P>
<P>
	``We cannot run the military today without women,'' Cohen said  
in June. ``And our goal is to find ways to make men and women train 
and work better together.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The current commission was appointed by both Republican and  
Democratic lawmakers who remain divided over gender separation 
during training. 
</P>
<P>
	The six commission members who voted to maintain the status quo  
were: former Pentagon official Frederick Pang; ex-Navy official 
Barbara Pope; sociologist Mady Wechler Segal; University of 
Michigan provost Nancy Cantor; retired Sgt. Maj. Robert Dare; and 
retired Marine Corps Lt. Gen. George Christmas, according to a 
report in Tuesday's editions of The Washington Times. 
</P>
<P>
	Those abstaining included commission Chairwoman Anita Blair;  
sociologist Charles Moskos; and retired Marine Lt. Gen. William 
Keys, the Times reported. The lone vote against integrating the 
sexes during training came from Tom Moore, a military analyst at 
the conservative Heritage Foundation, the newspaper said. 
</P>
<P>
	Congressional officials would not confirm the vote breakdown.

<HEADLINE> Calif. Capitol May Cause Cancer </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SACRAMENTO, Calif. (AP) -- San Francisco Mayor Willie Brown wants  
a thorough inspection of the state Capitol because he thinks the 
building may be killing people. 
</P>
<P>
	Brown, for years the powerful speaker of the Assembly, says  
there's enough cancer among legislators, ex-legislators and 
staffers to warrant a full epidemiological survey. 
</P>
<P>
	Senate President Pro Tem John Burton says Brown's concern ``sure  
bears looking into.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But he added, ``I don't want anyone to have a heart attack by  
thinking they're working on top of a toxic dump.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Brown said he asked Burton for the study after former Senate  
Minority Leader Ken Maddy announced last month he had lung cancer. 
</P>
<P>
	Six lawmakers have died in the last 12 years of cancer,  
including former Speaker Jesse Unruh. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's something in that building that's causing cancer and  
nothing is going to change my mind,'' said former Assemblyman 
Gerald Felando, who suffered from a rare form of lymphoma in the 
early 1990s.

<HEADLINE> Woman Gets $15.7M in Sears Lawsuit </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- A jury ordered Sears Roebuck &AMP; Co. to pay nearly  
$15.7 million to a woman who was blinded in an accident at one of 
the retailer's automotive service centers. 
</P>
<P>
	Rosa Kresin, now 76, was walking through the service center in  
suburban St. Charles in June 1996 when she was struck by a van 
being backed out of a garage. 
</P>
<P>
	She suffered multiple facial fractures that caused blindness,  
and also lost use of an arm and a leg, said her lawyer, Charles 
Thompson. 
</P>
<P>
	``She is a bright, witty person who now is trapped in darkness  
and a useless body,'' Thompson said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	After deliberating nearly four hours Monday, a Cook County jury  
found that Sears failed to adequately train employees on safety 
procedures. 
</P>
<P>
	Sears spokeswoman Jan Drummond said Sears was disappointed by  
the size of the award, but no decision had been made on whether to 
appeal.

<HEADLINE> Pavarotti Gleams in `Tosca' </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Luciano Pavarotti keeps confounding critics who  
think the aging superstar should call it quits. 
</P>
<P>
	On Tuesday night, he was back at the Metropolitan Opera in one  
of his favorite roles -- the painter Mario Cavaradossi in Puccini's 
``Tosca'' -- and his voice gleamed with youthful beauty. 
</P>
<P>
	This was the first of three performances he is giving this month  
to make up for cancellations last November, when he was recovering 
from hip and knee replacement operations. 
</P>
<P>
	Those cancellations, on top of some vocal problems in the  
previous few seasons, had prompted speculation that, at age 63, the 
Italian tenor's singing career might be near an end. 
</P>
<P>
	But you'd never think that to hear him in ``Tosca.'' He sang  
with round, warm tones -- those distinctive tones that identify the 
voice as Pavarotti's. He showed no vocal wobble and did not tire 
vocally during the opera. 
</P>
<P>
	True, he didn't always sing with his former power, but this may  
have been for dramatic effect. When power was called for, as when 
Cavaradossi learns that Napoleon has won a battle and sings 
``Vittoria!'', Pavarotti's voice rang out. 
</P>
<P>
	He used pianissimos to effect. When he sang that Tosca's sweet  
hands were meant to caress children, his voice was a caress. When 
he sang that Tosca gave color to his life, his tone was light and 
ecstatic. He also seemed to enjoy the embraces. 
</P>
<P>
	It's obvious that Pavarotti has lost weight. He moved well and,  
when he was brought before Scarpia, he planted his feet apart in a 
sturdy stance. He used to find opportunities to lean or sit on 
stage. This time, rather than remaining seated at a writing table, 
he stood for part of that scene in the last act. 
</P>
<P>
	There are still precautions: When he was shot, he fell onto  
filled sacks before rolling onto the floor. And, as usual in Act 1, 
Pavarotti works at his painter's easel front and center instead of 
climbing stairs to paint on the back wall. 
</P>
<P>
	Did the return please Pavarotti? He smiled at the final bows,  
seemingly delighted with the evening. 
</P>
<P>
	His next performance, Saturday afternoon, is slated to be  
broadcast nationally live on radio. He is also scheduled to repeat 
the part at the Met next season. 
</P>
<P>
	The rest of the cast provided strong support. Carol Vaness sang  
the title role with the right vocal heft and beauty, as well as the 
dramatic presence for a diva. Though sometimes singing with more 
vibrato than ideal, she made her big aria, ``Vissi d'arte,'' both 
strong and moving. 
</P>
<P>
	James Morris sang Scarpia, chief of the secret police who  
desires Tosca, with evil in his tone. When he sings to her, Morris 
ably added an overlay of charm. He sounded at the top of his form 
and moved with self-satisfaction. 
</P>
<P>
	Richard Bernstein sang with an unusually rich bass-baritone as  
Angelotti, the escaped political prisoner. 
</P>
<P>
	Conductor Nello Santi, long a fixture at the Met in Italian  
repertory, received warm applause from the sold-out house.

<HEADLINE> Clinton To Draft Medicare Plan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Clinton and Republicans in Congress  
say they will continue to work for a Medicare overhaul this year, 
even though an advisory commission has failed to agree on 
recommendations for the program's future. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton called Medicare ``too important to let partisan progress  
stand in the way of vital progress,'' and said he would draft his 
own rescue plan in hopes of getting an agreement with Congress. 
</P>
<P>
	Republicans and Democrats alike see Medicare overhaul as a  
potent political issue in the 2000 election. 
</P>
<P>
	Earlier this year, the president proposed using billions of  
dollars of expected budget surpluses as a first step toward shoring 
up the health care program for the elderly and disabled. Republican 
leaders have so far declined to endorse that idea. 
</P>
<P>
	However, key congressional committee chairmen said they would  
consider an alternative plan developed by the National Bipartisan 
Commission on the Future of Medicare, even though the commission 
failed to reach enough consensus to formally recommended the 
proposal to Congress. 
</P>
<P>
	At their final meeting Tuesday evening, 10 of the 17 commission  
members voted to approve the plan, which would aim to reduce 
Medicare's costs by making it more like private health benefits. 
Eleven votes were needed. 
</P>
<P>
	Nevertheless, Rep. Bill Archer, R-Texas, chairman of the House  
Ways and Means Committee, credited the commission with making 
``considerable bipartisan progress.'' Senate Finance Committee 
Chairman William Roth, R-Del., also has said he would hold hearings 
on the proposal. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton, however, criticized the plan championed by the  
commission's co-chairmen, Sen. John Breaux, D-La., and Rep. Bill 
Thomas, R-Calif., saying it fell short of what was needed. 
</P>
<P>
	``Even if all the changes recommended by the commission were  
adopted, because of the projected inflation rates and health care 
costs, it would not be sufficient to stabilize the fund,'' Clinton 
said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Breaux and Thomas in turn have raised concerns that Clinton's  
recommendation to use surpluses might simply ease pressure on 
lawmakers to make difficult but necessary changes to Medicare. 
</P>
<P>
	``I likened it to putting more gas in an old car -- it still  
would run like an old car,'' Breaux said. 
</P>
<P>
	Their plan would instead inject competition into Medicare by  
letting senior citizens choose from among private and 
government-run insurance options. The government would subsidize 
their premiums. 
</P>
<P>
	That would begin to shift Medicare away from paying people's  
individual medical bills, making the program more like the health 
benefits that many companies offer to workers. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton has proposed spending a chunk of the anticipated budget  
surpluses -- about $700 billion -- to boost Medicare. But he also 
said other changes likely would be needed, and he praised some 
elements of the Breaux-Thomas plan. 
</P>
<P>
	Without changes, Medicare, which provides health insurance for  
39 million elderly and disabled Americans, is expected to run short 
of cash in about a decade -- just before the first of the baby 
boomers retire and become eligible for benefits. 
</P>
<P>
	However, tampering with the program has proved a political  
lightning rod in the past. Republican leaders and Clinton had hoped 
the bipartisan commission of key lawmakers, private experts and 
former government officials could take off some of the heat. 
</P>
<P>
	Instead, the commission has largely highlighted, rather than  
solved, the political disagreements confronting lawmakers looking 
to overhaul Medicare. 
</P>
<P>
	Aside from Breaux, the only other Democrat on the panel to  
support his plan was Sen. Bob Kerrey, D-Neb. The other eight 
supporting it were Republicans. 
</P>
<P>
	Most Democrats on the commission argued the proposal wouldn't  
guarantee adequate health care at affordable costs for growing 
numbers of elderly Americans. 
</P>
<P>
	``A lot of seniors ... are not going to be taken care of,'' said  
Rep. Jim McDermott, D-Wash. 
</P>
<P>
	Commissioners also clashed over their desire to make  
prescription drugs -- not covered by Medicare now -- more accessible 
to the elderly and disabled. 
</P>
<P>
	In general, Democrats including Clinton want to subsidize drug  
coverage for all Medicare beneficiaries. But Republicans wonder if 
the program can afford that and want to explore other 
private-sector options. 
</P>
<P>
	Similarly, the idea of raising the Medicare eligibility age from  
65 to 67 was attractive to many commissioners, but raised 
unresolved questions about where people displaced by the change 
would get health insurance.

<HEADLINE> Officials Mull Anti-Radiation Pill </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- It seems so simple, handing out pills to  
people living near nuclear power plants to prevent thyroid cancer. 
But 20 years after potassium iodide was touted as a radiation 
therapy in the wake of the Three Mile Island accident, it remains 
controversial for states considering its use. 
</P>
<P>
	``You don't just give out drugs to everybody and let them keep  
them in their house,'' said Mark Leccese, spokesman for the 
Massachusetts Department of Public Health, which opposes the drug 
despite a federal Nuclear Regulatory Commission recommendation that 
states consider its use in their emergency planning. 
</P>
<P>
	The drug would protect the thyroid by blocking its absorption of  
radioactive iodine. 
</P>
<P>
	After the 1978 accident at the Three Mile Island nuclear power  
plant in Pennsylvania, a presidential commission strongly 
recommended the stockpiling of potassium iodide near all U.S. 
reactor sites. 
</P>
<P>
	But in 1985, the NRC concluded that stockpiling was not  
worthwhile, although agency staff at the time estimated the cost at 
about 10 cents per year for each of the nearly 800,000 people that 
potentially would be protected. The drug was recommended only for 
emergency workers and institutionalized people who couldn't be 
moved to safety quickly. 
</P>
<P>
	Last year, the NRC reversed that policy on the strength of  
evidence that the drug reduced the incidence of thyroid cancer 
among children in areas of Poland following the 1986 Chernobyl 
nuclear accident in Ukraine. 
</P>
<P>
	Now, a federal committee is working to develop a brochure by  
October to guide the states' decision-making. Currently only 
Alabama, Arizona and Tennessee stockpile the drug. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't expect an accident,'' said Tony Sheridan, a committee  
member and first selectman of Waterford, Conn., home of the 
Millstone plant. ``But there are people who are anxious about it. 
There are people who are anxious about getting the flu, so they go 
out and get a flu shot. So they have a right to have it 
available.'' 
</P>
<P>
	While leaving the final decision to state and local officials,  
the NRC concluded that it was ``reasonable and prudent'' to 
stockpile the drug near reactor sites. It offered to pay for it or, 
in some cases, make it available from an existing federal supply. 
</P>
<P>
	The nuclear power industry, hesitant to heighten public concern  
about the likelihood of an accident, has opposed stockpiling. 
Industry officials say such programs are costly, confusing and 
probably would not get the pills to people in time to do any good. 
</P>
<P>
	Even supporters take a cautious approach.  
</P>
<P>
	For one, there is concern that people in a nuclear accident zone  
would be slow to leave if they assumed -- wrongly -- that the drug 
offered broad protection against radiation's harmful effects. 
</P>
<P>
	In fact, the drug would protect only the thyroid from one type  
of radiation and would benefit infants, children and pregnant women 
the most. It is not intended as a replacement for evacuation and 
sheltering. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's some worry that people will think, 'I can take this  
magic radiation pill and stay home,''' said Joelle Key, a health 
physicist with the state division of radiological health in 
Tennessee, where the Tennessee Valley Authority operates three 
nuclear power plants. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1981, Tennessee officials reached two-thirds of households  
with a door-to-door distribution. But the most recent call to 
replace old pills with fresher ones had just a 15 percent response. 
</P>
<P>
	Officials also don't want to increase people's exposure to all  
types of radiation by requiring them to stay in a contaminated area 
any longer than necessary. 
</P>
<P>
	``Should they go get the pill and then leave?'' said Ed Wilds,  
director of Connecticut's Department of Environmental Protection 
radiation division and a committee member. ``Those questions can 
only be addressed by looking at the specific situation you're in.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Food and Drug Administration also is reviewing its 1982  
policy on dosage. That called for everyone, except children under 
1, to take a three- to seven-day course of tablets, each delivering 
130 milligrams of potassium iodide. Children under 1 would get half 
a tablet. 
</P>
<P>
	Those guidelines differ from a World Health Organization draft  
that recommended smaller doses for young children, down to 16 
milligrams for newborns. 
</P>
<P>
	Details aside, supporters insist that people have a right to the  
drug. In Connecticut, hundreds have signed petitions supporting a 
two-year trial in three towns near the Millstone plant. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's like having a seat belt in your car,'' said Mark  
Holloway, a member of Connecticut's Nuclear Energy Advisory 
Council, which recommended the trial.

<HEADLINE> Anesthesia Deaths Raise Concern </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The surgery was supposed to be so simple: A  
few hours in the doctor's office and Susan Pearce would be home by 
dinner. 
</P>
<P>
	But shortly after going home from the breast augmentation, awake  
but groggy, the 27-year-old Alabama woman died of respiratory 
failure from powerful sedatives still in her blood. 
</P>
<P>
	Her husband says nobody warned them of danger. ``The procedure  
was done in his office, so I didn't have any reason to think there 
was a big risk involved,'' says Donald Pearce. 
</P>
<P>
	A spate of deaths -- most from liposuction and other cosmetic  
surgeries, but also among children sedated for dental work or MRI 
scans -- has experts questioning the safety of sedation administered 
in private doctors' offices. 
</P>
<P>
	Deaths from anesthesia in a hospital or outpatient surgical  
centers are extremely rare. Hosts of specialists are on hand to try 
to revive patients with problems. 
</P>
<P>
	But more surgery is moving to private offices, sometimes  
performed by physicians with little experience in handling powerful 
sedating drugs and little equipment to save patients who get into 
trouble, says Dr. John Neeld, president of the American Society of 
Anesthesiology. 
</P>
<P>
	Nobody counts how many deaths or injuries result from  
office-administered anesthesia. Experts believe the overall risk is 
small, considering the number of procedures in doctors' offices. 
</P>
<P>
	``Hundreds of thousands of these (cosmetic) procedures are done  
on a yearly basis, and people come out overwhelmingly happier,'' 
says Dr. Mark Gorney, former president of the American Society for 
Plastic and Reconstructive Surgery and medical director of The 
Doctors' Co., a major carrier of malpractice insurance. 
</P>
<P>
	But Gorney warns there are serious risks and says choosing a  
well-trained surgeon is crucial: 60 to 70 Americans died during 
routine liposuction from January 1997 to fall 1998, according to 
his survey of plastic surgeons and fellow insurers. He says many 
died from excessive doses of the anesthetic lidocaine; other 
complications included infections. 
</P>
<P>
	Clusters of other deaths are moving New Jersey, Florida and  
California toward the first safety regulations for certain office 
surgeries. 
</P>
<P>
	``I just think the public needs to be warned,'' Neeld says. He  
calls the deaths preventable, and is urging malpractice carriers 
and more state medical boards to investigate. 
</P>
<P>
	In most places, no laws restrict surgeries in private offices by  
licensed doctors, regardless of their surgical or anesthesia 
training. 
</P>
<P>
	Even when patients pick a skilled surgeon, operating in a  
private office means there is no backup for the rare patient with 
problems, says Dr. Charles Cote of the University of Illinois, 
Chicago, a pediatric anesthesiologist. 
</P>
<P>
	``When something goes wrong, the only thing you're left with is  
calling 911,'' warns Cote, who is preparing to publish a study 
suggesting sedation for children is riskiest during dental work and 
MRI scans. 
</P>
<P>
	Among the deaths prompting concern:  
</P>
<P>
	--Anesthesia caused a 28-year-old Virginia Beach, Va., woman  
undergoing breast augmentation in January to overheat drastically. 
``Malignant hyperthermia'' is a rare side effect easily 
counteracted with a quick dose of dantrolene. But that drug is sold 
in a 36-vial supply that costs almost $2,000, so few private 
offices stock it, says Dr. Henry Rosenberg of Philadelphia, 
president of the Malignant Hyperthermia Association. By the time 
the surgeon got the woman to an emergency room, her temperature had 
soared to a killer 107 degrees. 
</P>
<P>
	--A San Francisco woman was left overnight in her surgeon's  
office to recover from a facelift. A nonlicensed health worker gave 
her a shot of painkilling Demerol, turned off the alarm to her 
heart monitor and fell asleep. The Demerol was an overdose. Hers 
was one of five deaths connected to office cosmetic surgery and 
investigated by the California medical board in the last two years, 
although Gorney reports nine deaths. Four bills to require stricter 
safety procedures are pending in the Legislature. 
</P>
<P>
	--Five California preschoolers have died from oversedation in  
dentist chairs since 1991; four were given the oral sedative 
chloral hydrate to keep them still. Many general dentists are not 
trained in oral sedation, says Dr. Peter Hartmann, past president 
of the California dental board. A law that goes into effect next 
January requires proof of training for dentists using oral 
sedatives, and safety monitors for sedated children. 
</P>
<P>
	--Eighteen Floridians have died from cosmetic surgery since 1997,  
according to an investigation by the Sun-Sentinel of Fort 
Lauderdale. The state medical board in January approved rules 
limiting office cosmetic procedures to four hours, requiring 
training for certain anesthesia, and limiting to two quarts the 
amount of fat removed. 
</P>
<P>
	--In New Jersey, an 18-month-old died of respiratory failure  
while lying sedated and unmonitored inside an MRI machine, says Dr. 
Ervin Moss of the New Jersey Society of Anesthesiologists. That, 
plus two liposuction deaths in a dermatology office, prompted the 
medical board to require credentials for office-based surgeons 
using certain anesthesia, making New Jersey the first state to do 
so. 
</P>
<P>
	It is fairly easy to administer local or regional anesthestics,  
those shots that numb a few body parts. 
</P>
<P>
	But more complex surgeries require powerful combinations of  
sedating drugs, or drugs with obscure effects that take advanced 
training to master, Neeld says. 
</P>
<P>
	Take those dental deaths: Children given chloral hydrate can  
become temporarily agitated. A dentist who does not know the 
agitation quickly wears off may give the child a second, 
potentially fatal dose, warns California's Hartmann. 
</P>
<P>
	Then there is the question of when to send a patient home.  
</P>
<P>
	Versed, a common office sedative, is reversed by the drug  
flumazenil. But if doctors do not know that flumazenil clears out 
of the bloodstream faster than Versed, they may think patients are 
fully alert when enough Versed lurks in their blood to later 
re-sedate them, Neeld says. 
</P>
<P>
	That is what attorney Michael Worel believes happened to Susan  
Pearce. The Mobile, Ala., coroner ruled her death accidental, a 
side effect of sedation. The surgeon denies any negligence; a 
malpractice suit is pending. 
</P>
<P>
	Safety equipment can help doctors avoid or rectify emergencies.  
But too few doctors use simple machines that measure oxygen levels, 
or have full ``crash carts'' or people certified in cardiac 
resuscitation, says New Jersey's Moss. 
</P>
<P>
	``If you're going to use a drug with a potency that's  
dangerous,'' Gorney says, ``have the decency to learn how to 
recognize overdose and know what to do about it -- because you have 
little time to act.''

<HEADLINE> Cardinals Waive Carlos Baerga </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	JUPITER, Fla. (AP) -- Carlos Baerga, who had been trying to win  
the second-base job with the St. Louis Cardinals, was placed on 
waivers Wednesday for the purpose of giving him his unconditional 
release. 
</P>
<P>
	Signed as a free agent in the offseason, the 30-year-old Baerga  
was just 2-for-15 in six games this spring. 
</P>
<P>
	During a four-year stretch from 1992-95, he topped .300 each  
season, twice drove in 100 runs and had 90 RBIs another season. 
</P>
<P>
	He was a three-time All-Star with Cleveland, but after the  
Indians traded him to the New York Mets in 1996, his production 
declined rapidly. The last two seasons, he totaled 16 homers and 
105 RBIs. He hit .266 for the Mets last season. 
</P>
<P>
	The Cardinals lost last season's second baseman, Delino  
DeShields, to free agency in the offseason. David Howard and Shawon 
Dunston are now the candidates to replace him. 
</P>
<P>
	By releasing Baerga now, the Cardinals are responsible for 30  
days' termination pay, $163,934, rather than his entire salary, 
listed at $1 million but scheduled to increase to $1.25 million if 
he made the opening day active roster. He was coming off a $21.4 
million, six-year contract he signed with the Indians.

<HEADLINE> Spring Training BB Roundup </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	Tim Johnson's lies about his U.S. Marine service in Vietnam cost  
him more than credibility. On Wednesday, it cost him his job. 
</P>
<P>
	The Toronto Blue Jays, dogged by questions about Johnson's  
tales, fired him as manager and replaced him with Jim Fregosi in a 
rare spring training dismissal. 
</P>
<P>
	``The unsettledness and the distractions had become the issue,''  
general manager Gord Ash said at Dunedin, Fla. ``It had become 
apparent it wasn't going to work.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Johnson never saw combat, but supposedly made up stories --  
including one about shooting a young girl -- to inspire the club. He 
taught mortar training to recruits going to Vietnam, but never 
served there. 
</P>
<P>
	The truth was revealed last year, causing conflicts with several  
players and coaches. He apologized in camp last month, trying to 
put behind him a winter full of turmoil. 
</P>
<P>
	But with the Blue Jays at 3-12, and just a few days after former  
Toronto third baseman Ed Sprague called Johnson a ``liar'' and a 
``back stabber,'' Ash had seen enough. 
</P>
<P>
	``It wasn't going to fade into the background as quickly as I  
hoped,'' Ash said. 
</P>
<P>
	Firing a manager in spring training is not unprecedented. Phil  
Cavaretta was fired by the Chicago Cubs in March 1954. 
</P>
<P>
	``They were looking for leadership,'' Fregosi said. ``We'll be  
ready by opening day.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Johnson, 49, was offered a job as a scout, and it was not known  
whether he would take it. He was driving to visit family in Kansas 
and was unavailable for comment. 
</P>
<P>
	Fregosi, 56, managed the Philadelphia Phillies when they lost  
the 1993 World Series to Toronto. Fired after the 1996 season, he 
was with the San Francisco Giants as a special assistant to the 
general manager when he signed a two-year deal with Toronto. 
</P>
<P>
	Fregosi had an 861-937 record while managing Philadelphia, the  
Chicago White Sox and California Angels. 
</P>
<P>
	``I have always wanted to manage,'' Fregosi said. ``I missed the  
action, I missed the field.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In their first game under Fregosi, the Blue Jays stole a run  
with a double steal in the first inning. Later, he came on the 
field to argue a ground-rule double call in the fifth of a 10-6 
victory at Clearwater, Fla. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was exciting,'' Fregosi said. ``It was fun to be back a  
part of the action.'' 
</P>
<P>
	At Mesa, Ariz., pitcher Todd Stottlemyre was not so thrilled by  
what he saw from Sammy Sosa in the Chicago Cubs' 8-5 loss to 
Arizona in 10 innings. 
</P>
<P>
	Sosa hit two home runs off Stottlemyre, and punctuated each  
drive with a pronounced bow to the crowd. Sosa, with seven homers 
this spring, said he picked up the habit last November during a 
tour of Japan. 
</P>
<P>
	``Nobody wants to be embarrassed,'' Stottlemyre said. ``I sure  
don't remember Mickey Mantle bowing after home runs. I guarantee 
Joe DiMaggio didn't bow. I bet everything I got Lou Gehrig didn't, 
Jackie Robinson, Roberto Clemente.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``I took it as offensive,'' he said.  
</P>
<P>
	Sosa was, well, unbowed.  
</P>
<P>
	``No comment,'' he said when informed of Stottlemyre's remarks.  
The bows, he said, are ``showing respect for all the fans who come 
out here seeing the game.'' 
</P>
<P>
	At Tucson, Ariz., the San Diego Padres sustained a loss when  
catcher Carlos Hernandez ruptured his left Achilles' tendon, likely 
sidelining him for the season. 
</P>
<P>
	Hernandez, who hit .262 with 52 RBIs last year, went down after  
hitting a popup in the sixth inning. 
</P>
<P>
	The Padres beat the Chicago White Sox 7-6. Country music star  
Garth Brooks made his first exhibition start for the Padres and was 
0-for-4. Brooks, 37, is hitless in nine at-bats in ``A'' games this 
spring. 
</P>
<P>
	In other games:  
</P>
<P>
                   *Mariners (ss) 7, Athletics (ss) 2    	
</P>
<P>
	At Peoria, Ariz., Ken Griffey Jr. homered, doubled, singled and

                     *Indians (ss) 8, Devil Rays 2 	
</P>
<P>
	At Winter Haven, Fla., Orel Hershiser pitched four scoreless 	
innings in his bid to make Cleveland's roster. The 40-year-old 
former Cy Young winner has a 2.70 ERA in four spring outings. 
</P>

<HEADLINE> Boston Banks Might Sell Branches </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BOSTON (AP) -- The planned merger of Fleet Financial Group and  
BankBoston may lead to the sale of 270 New England branches in what 
could be one of the largest bank divestitures ever, The Boston 
Globe reported Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition, Fleet Boston Corp., as the combined bank will be  
called, plans to close about two dozen branches. 
</P>
<P>
	Fleet now has 1,200 branches, including 412 in New York and 171  
in New Jersey. BankBoston has about 425 branches in Massachusetts, 
Connecticut, New Hampshire and Maine. 
</P>
<P>
	In a deal that would create the eighth-largest bank in the  
country, the companies announced earlier this week that Fleet had 
agreed to acquire BankBoston for $16 billion in stock. 
</P>
<P>
	The Globe, citing unidentified sources, said Fleet Boston will  
keep nearly all of the 301 branches that BankBoston has in 
Massachusetts, and sell about three-quarters of Fleet's 200 
branches in the state. 
</P>
<P>
	In Rhode Island, Fleet Boston expects to keep the 50 Fleet  
branches, and sell most of BankBoston's 45, the report said. 
</P>
<P>
	In Connecticut, about half of BankBoston's 64 branches could be  
sold, leaving the combined bank with 200 branches. 
</P>
<P>
	None of the 65 branches in New Hampshire and the 55 in Maine are  
expected to be sold. The combining banks have no branches in 
Vermont. 
</P>
<P>
	``This would appear to be the largest single market bank  
divestiture ever in a major merger,'' Christopher Bellini, a 
banking lawyer at Gibson Dunn &AMP; Crutcher in Washington, told the 
Globe. 
</P>
<P>
	Regulators will have the ultimate say over which branches the  
banks end up selling.

<HEADLINE> Ollila Adds More Duties at Nokia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HELSINKI, Finland (AP) -- Nokia announced Wednesday that chief  
executive Jorma Ollila has been named to the additional post of 
chairman at the Finnish manufacturer of cellular phones and other 
telecommunications equipment. 
</P>
<P>
	Ollila, 48, who has been president and CEO of the Finland-based  
group since 1992, will hand the presidency over to Pekka 
Ala-Pietila, the deputy CEO. 
</P>
<P>
	The appointment was widely expected after the previous chairman,  
Casimir Ehrnrooth, 67, announced his retirement last month. 
</P>
<P>
	``The most important thing is continuity,'' Ollila told a news  
conference after his appointment. Nokia's ``collegiate management 
has to continue in a clear vein, and this new arrangement 
guarantees that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Last month, Nokia reported a record pretax profit in 1998 of  
14.6 billion markkaa ($2.92 billion), up from 8.4 billion markkaa 
the previous year. Sales increased, to 79.2 billion markkaa ($15.5

<HEADLINE> Swingley Wins Iditarod Race </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NOME, Alaska (AP) -- Montana musher Doug Swingley won his second  
Iditarod Trail Sled Dog Race early today in much the same way that 
he won his first: with an insurmountable lead over Martin Buser. 
</P>
<P>
	Swingley, from Lincoln, Mont., reached the finish line of the  
1,100-mile sled dog race at 1:31 a.m. Alaska time (5:31 EST). 
</P>
<P>
	He won in an unofficial time of 9 days, 14 hours and 31 minutes.  
</P>
<P>
	The victory earned him $54,000 and a new pickup to go along with  
$9,000 in bonus money he won on the trail. 
</P>
<P>
	``I got to take a long rest at the end,'' Swingley said at the  
finish line, flanked by family members and a couple of his dogs. 
``I'm ready to party.'' 
</P>
<P>
	More than seven hours back was Buser, who was the runner-up when  
Swingley won his first Iditarod in 1995. Buser, from Big Lake, left 
White Mountain Tuesday night to cover the remaining 77 miles to 
this historic Gold Rush-era city. 
</P>
<P>
	Swingley's victory margin stands to be the widest since 1992,  
when Buser finished more than 10 hours ahead of runner-up Susan 
Butcher. 
</P>
<P>
	Swingley borrowed from a race strategy that worked for him in  
1995 -- go further than the pack before taking his mandatory 24-hour 
rest, and then outrun everyone else to the Bering Sea coast. 
</P>
<P>
	While on the Yukon River, Swingley said, he and Buser agreed he  
was faster than others in the field. 
</P>
<P>
	``He and I both realized that I may not see him or anyone else  
again,'' Swingley said. ``It was my race to lose.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But at the same time, despite his confidence, he didn't want to  
count it as a victory too soon. 
</P>
<P>
	He also caught a few big breaks. Injuries led Buser to cut his  
team from 16 dogs to 10 early in the race, which forced him to run 
more conservatively. And after leaving the Yukon River, Swingley 
just missed a bout of bad weather that slowed other front-running 
teams. 
</P>
<P>
	Swingley also broke two sleds, but neither slowed him down. He  
patched the first with a stick and a few hose clamps, and the 
second broke just before his 24-hour layover in Iditarod, leaving 
him plenty of time to fly in a replacement. 
</P>
<P>
	On Tuesday, Buser arrived in White Mountain at 3:05 p.m., early  
enough to engage in some playful give-and-take with Swingley. 
</P>
<P>
	``Hey, thanks for waiting for me, Doug,'' Buser shouted.  
</P>
<P>
	Villagers, reporters and others watched the two frontrunners --  
Buser pulling out his cooking gear to feed his team and Swingley 
packing up and putting booties on his dogs. 
</P>
<P>
	``We'll see you in Nome, OK?,'' Swingley said shortly before  
leaving. 
</P>
<P>
	``Yup, you have a good run,'' Buser responded.  
</P>
<P>
	Buser also gave Swingley a small box containing a cigar.  
</P>
<P>
	``You can smoke it whenever,'' he said. ``I was going to smoke  
it myself, but I'm not going to now ... It's the victory cigar.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Swingley laughed and thanked him for the gesture, adding, ``I'll  
take it to Nome -- we'll smoke it together when you get there.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Rick Swenson of Two Rivers, a five-time Iditarod winner, was  
running third today.

<P>
	A few hours behind Swenson were Vern Halter of Willow and  
Charlie Boulding of Manley. Four more Alaskans were a couple of 
hours further back -- John Baker of Kotzebue, Paul Gebhardt of 
Kasilof, defending champion Jeff King of Denali Park and Ed Iten of 
Kotzebue.

	House Committee Approves Budget  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Republicans pushed a $1.74 trillion budget for  
fiscal 2000 through a House committee Wednesday and were a hair's 
breadth from prevailing in a Senate panel after GOP lawmakers 
crushed Democratic attempts to block tax cuts. By a 22-18 
party-line vote, the House Budget Committee approved a spending 
plan by Chairman John Kasich, R-Ohio, that promises to leave Social 
Security surpluses alone while reducing taxes and increasing 
defense, education and several other programs. Simultaneously, the 
Senate Budget Committee moved toward approving a similar plan. That 
panel planned to complete its work tomorrow.

	Weapons Labs Get New Security  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Energy Secretary Bill Richardson imposed new  
security measures for national weapons laboratories Wednesday and 
ordered an internal investigation into whether a department 
official was prevented from briefing Congress on alleged Chinese 
espionage. Richardson outlined the new measures in a closed-door 
hearing of the Senate Intelligence Committee. The committee was 
questioning Richardson on how the Clinton administration responded 
when it first learned of an inquiry into the alleged Chinese theft 
of top-secret nuclear warhead technology from the Los Alamos 
National Laboratory in the 1980s.

stream over the eastern Caribbean, the control center said. The 
pilots, Brian Jones of England and Bertrand Piccard of Switzerland, 
hope to reach the North African coast at Mauritania, perhaps by 
Saturday evening. If they make it, the pair will have conquered one 
of the last great challenges facing aviators. Jones and Piccard

	BOURBONNAIS, Ill. (AP) -- Investigators are analyzing tire tracks  
in the mud to determine whether the truck driver at the center of a 
deadly Amtrak crash had tried to go around the crossing gates and 
beat the train. The crash between the tractor-trailer and Amtrak's 
City of New Orleans killed 11 people Monday night in the nation's 
deadliest train wreck in three years. Tire marks were found on the 
road, on timbers at the crossing and in the mud along the shoulder 
of the road, said Bob Lauby, director of the National 
Transportation Safety Board's office of railroad safety.

	Anesthesia Deaths Raise Concern  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- A spate of deaths -- most from cosmetic  
surgeries, but also among children undergoing dental work or MRI 
scans -- has experts questioning the safety of sedation in private 
doctors' offices. More surgery is moving to such offices, sometimes 
performed by physicians with little experience in handling powerful 
sedating drugs and little equipment to save patients who get into 
trouble, says Dr. John Neeld, president of the American Society of 
Anesthesiology. Nobody counts how many deaths or injuries result 
from office-administered anesthesia.

victory Wednesday night that stretched the Heat's winning streak to 
six. Mookie Blaylock had a chance to win it for Atlanta but missed 
a desperation jumper from the corner as time expired to end the 
Hawks' four-game winning streak, their longest of the season. Miami 
led nearly the entire game and held an 82-72 advantage after P.J. 
Brown hit a 12-foot jumper with 4:11 remaining.

<P>
	DUBAI, United Arab Emirates (AP) -- Belmont Stakes winner Victory  
Gallop arrived in the Emirates on Monday to begin training for the 
$5 million Dubai World Cup. 
</P>
<P>
	Victory Gallop, who prepped for the March 28 Dubai Cup with an  
easy victory in an allowance race at Gulfstream Park on March 3, 
was in good health after the 8,000-mile flight from Fort 
Lauderdale, Fla., to New York to Sharjan International Airport.

<HEADLINE> Gov't Urged To Stockpile Vaccines </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Several Senators concerned about biological  
terrorism want the administration to stockpile more anthrax and 
smallpox vaccines and to develop new ones. 
</P>
<P>
	Sen. Arlen Specter, R-Pa., also called on the Clinton  
administration Tuesday to declassify a Pentagon list of some two 
dozen biological weapons in order to warn Americans. 
</P>
<P>
	``This ought to be on the front burner,'' Specter told a joint  
hearing of the Veterans Affairs Committee and the Appropriations 
Committee's health panel, both of which he chairs. ``The American 
people have a right to know what's happening here.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Sen. Jay Rockefeller, D-W.Va., said the United States is ``way  
behind in our efforts in dealing with bioterrorism,'' calling the 
potential danger ``extremely real.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Pentagon is inoculating all 2.4 million U.S. troops and  
reserves against anthrax to protect against possible germ warfare. 
Vaccine supplies are limited, however, since only one U.S. company 
manufactures it. 
</P>
<P>
	Anthrax kills 80 percent of those who inhale germ spores and are  
not treated. It is not spread by person and can be prevented by 
antibiotics taken before symptoms appear. 
</P>
<P>
	Smallpox is a highly contagious, untreatable virus. The disease  
was eradicated decades ago, but the former Soviet Union and other 
countries experimented with turning laboratory supplies of the 
virus into bioweapons, so the risk still exists. 
</P>
<P>
	Smallpox vaccines are no longer being manufactured, but the U.S.  
government maintains 6 million to 7 million doses of vaccine. 
</P>
<P>
	The Health and Human Services Department is spending $158  
million this year to prepare for possible bioterrorism and is 
asking for $230 million next year. A top HHS priority is creating a 
stockpile of treatments and vaccines, focusing first on antibiotics 
against anthrax and the plague and enhancing the existing smallpox 
vaccine supply, U.S. officials said. 
</P>
<P>
	Specter and Rockefeller called for the development of a broader  
range of vaccines. 
</P>
<P>
	``There is a large number of biological threats for which the  
United States has no vaccine,'' Specter said.

<HEADLINE> EU Commissioners Await Replacements </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) -- Members of the European Commission who  
resigned over a report about fraud and mismanagement said today 
they will take on no new initiatives while waiting to be replaced. 
</P>
<P>
	The 20-member Commission, which oversees the European Union's  
bureaucracy and $94 billion budget, said in a statement it would 
only ``deal with current and urgent business.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``We have resigned and have no desire or intention of remaining  
in office a moment longer than we have to,'' said the statement, 
which urged EU member nations to quickly find replacements. 
</P>
<P>
	The commissioners resigned Tuesday after an independent panel of  
experts reported that investigators found numerous cases of 
mismanagement, ineptitude and lack of responsibility in the 
Commission. 
</P>
<P>
	None of the commissioners accepted responsibility for any of the  
shortcomings outlined in the 140-page report. 
</P>
<P>
	``We must not give the impression that we are sulking,'' said  
Karel van Miert, a Belgian who had served as commissioner for 
competition. ``Even if the Commission has resigned, we cannot block 
the work of the EU institutions.'' 
</P>
<P>
	German Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder, current chairman of the  
15-nation EU, is consulting with his fellow European leaders about 
ways to revitalize the Commission. 
</P>
<P>
	Faced with the task of making monumental reforms, leaders of the  
15 EU countries are racing to replace their shattered executive 
branch back together. Loss of an energetic commission could slow 
the pace of reforms and, ultimately, EU enlargement in Eastern 
Europe. 
</P>
<P>
	First on the agenda will be finding a new president, who  
Schroeder said must be a ``convinced European'' with political 
experience, a knowledge of economics and ``personal integrity.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Needing Commission attention are farm reform, major trade issues  
such as the dispute with the United States over banana imports and 
continued efforts to implement the new European single currency. 
Finally, there is the simple running of day-to-day EU business for 
370 million Europeans. 
</P>
<P>
	Outgoing Commission President Jacques Santer of Luxembourg, who  
now heads a caretaker Commission, was indignant at being forced to 
resign. He called the experts' report unfair and unbalanced. 
</P>
<P>
	``I found that shameful,'' he said. ``I will say that over and  
over again as long as you like. I take no responsibility for the 
genesis of a situation that dates back to 1993.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Edith Cresson of France, one of the principal targets of the  
panel, brushed off suggestions of personal fault, calling the 
crisis ``an institutional problem'' although the panel criticized 
her severely for hiring an old friend at a high salary to do 
virtually nothing. 
</P>
<P>
	The outgoing Commission's five-year term was to have expired  
Dec. 31. It was unclear how or when a new Commission would be 
appointed.

<HEADLINE> First Lady Chats Online About Kids </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Writing to Socks and Buddy, the nation's first  
pets, is helping thousands of children read better, first lady 
Hillary Rodham Clinton says. 
</P>
<P>
	In an America Online Internet session devoid of political talk  
Tuesday evening, Mrs. Clinton pitched her new book, ``Dear Socks, 
Dear Buddy: Kids' Letters to the First Pets.'' She also encouraged 
parents to help children send more letters. 
</P>
<P>
	``We should realize that literacy is not just reading, but also  
writing,'' Mrs. Clinton wrote in her chat session. ``(Writing) 
helps a child 's language development, helps them formulate ideas 
and improves vocabulary.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The book, showing the lighter side of life in the White House,  
was inspired by the 300,000 annual letters sent to Socks, a 
black-and-white domestic shorthair cat, and newcomer Buddy, a 
chocolate Labrador retriever. 
</P>
<P>
	``I decided those letters were so wonderful that I wanted to  
share them with other children and adults,'' she wrote. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Clinton also explained how the pets' letters are answered  
by local military retirees, and how Socks and Buddy do their White 
House ``jobs,'' such as greeting guests and visiting children's 
hospitals and nursing homes. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Clinton's first time ``chatting'' online drew dozens of  
browsers, though it started past most children's bedtimes at 10 
p.m. EST. 
</P>
<P>
	A few children stayed up for the chat.  
</P>
<P>
	``I LOVE MRS. CLINTON AND I AM 7 YEARS OLD,'' read one message.  
</P>
<P>
	The questions, selected in advance, were mostly from people  
identifying themselves as teachers and parents and focused on 
education. 
</P>
<P>
	Many chatters speculated among themselves about Mrs. Clinton's  
prospects for the New York senate seat that she has been courted to 
seek. ``She could be good for the state's children,'' wrote one 
viewer. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Clinton won praise from child advocates for her first book,  
``It Takes a Village.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Dear Socks, Dear Buddy'' includes a pet history of the White  
House, from Dolley Madison's parrot, who escaped a British attack 
on the White House, and to the Bushes' English springer spaniel 
Millie, who also has a book. 
</P>
<P>
	The Socks and Buddy book, the royalties from which are donated  
to the National Park Service Foundation, reprints 50 letters from 
children nationwide and includes more than 80 candid photographs of 
the pets in the Oval Office, on the lawn and even in the pool. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't think Socks and Buddy know that anyone in the White  
House is a VIP other than them,'' she wrote. 
</P>
<P>
	She recounted the family's semi-successful efforts to get cat  
used to dog: ``Bill has worked hard to bring peace to many parts of 
the world and was determined that Buddy and Socks would get 
along... I guess you could say they are living in a state of 
peaceful but uneasy coexistence.''

<HEADLINE> Colleges Join Sweatshop Debate </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BOSTON (AP) -- Some of the nation's most prestigious colleges  
want to make sure their names aren't on caps and sweatshirts made 
in overseas sweatshops for pennies a day. 
</P>
<P>
	Seventeen schools -- including Harvard, Brown, Princeton and Duke  
-- this week joined a national group set up to curb worker abuses 
overseas. 
</P>
<P>
	The schools made the announcement two weeks after protesters  
across the nation, many of them students, demonstrated against 
corporate giants for allegedly abusing overseas workers. 
</P>
<P>
	But student activists said Tuesday that they were outraged by  
the move because the group, the Fair Labor Association, is 
supported largely by apparel manufacturers such as Nike Inc. and 
Phillips-Van Heusen. 
</P>
<P>
	``The Student Labor Association is furious that this decision  
was made behind our back,'' said Nora Rosenberg, a member of a 
Brown-based student group that opposes sweatshops. 
</P>
<P>
	The Fair Labor Association evolved from a group of 18 apparel  
manufacturers and retailers formed after the news broke that young 
Chinese women were making Kathie Lee Gifford handbags for Wal-Mart 
at 13 cents a day. 
</P>
<P>
	The White House supports the group, which established a code of  
conduct for apparel factories and a program to monitor violations. 
</P>
<P>
	Some labor groups were initially part of the Fair Labor  
Association, but walked away. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a complete cover-up. It's ineffective,'' said Carrie Kim,  
a spokeswoman for the United Needletrades Industrial and Textile 
Employees. 
</P>
<P>
	The association will monitor and evaluate member companies to  
make sure they comply with its standards. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're laying a foundation to create some accountability, some  
industrywide standards, some sense of monitoring in a very big, 
difficult world,'' said Michael Posner, executive director of the 
Lawyers Committee for Human Rights, an association member. 
</P>
<P>
	Harvard's attorney said the school was in a tough position.  
</P>
<P>
	``We don't know anything about manufacturing. We don't hire  
clothing workers. But students say we have a responsibility to do 
something about labor conditions,'' said Allan Ryan, a Harvard 
University attorney. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're not persuaded this will prove to be the answer to  
anything,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Harvard -- along with Princeton, Brown, Columbia and Cornell --  
are requiring companies to disclose the location of the factories 
where licensed apparel is made, which goes beyond the association's 
code. 
</P>
<P>
	Other colleges include Tufts, Dartmouth, Florida State,  
Marymount, Rutgers, Smith, Tufts, Wellesley, the University of 
Arizona and the University of Pennsylvania.

<HEADLINE> Feds Review 'Baby T' Custody Ruling </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- Federal officials are trying to determine if a  
judge handling the custody case of a black child broke a law 
prohibiting the consideration of race when placing children with 
adoptive and foster parents. 
</P>
<P>
	Judge Judith Brawka last week ordered the 3-year-old boy known  
as ``Baby T'' to be returned to his former drug addict mother. 
</P>
<P>
	In doing so, Brawka cited a state law that favors placement of  
children with their birth parents as well as mother Tina Olison's 
successful drug rehabilitation. 
</P>
<P>
	However, the judge also criticized state child-welfare officials  
for placing too little emphasis on the boy's race when they 
recommended that he remain with city Alderman Edward Burke and his 
wife, state Appellate Judge Anne Burke, who are white. 
</P>
<P>
	``Unless the position of the department is that there is no such  
thing as African-American culture, this issue deserves more 
attention than to check a box that says not applicable,'' Brawka 
told officials from the Department of Children and Family Services 
during her March 8 ruling. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1996, Congress voted into law a ban preventing states from  
considering race when placing children with adoptive or foster 
parents. Those states that ignore the ban could face the loss of 
federal funds. 
</P>
<P>
	The Burkes -- one of Chicago's most politically powerful couples  
-- have cared for the boy since he was 8 days old and wanted to 
adopt him. They also sought to have the 37-year-old Olison declared 
unfit. 
</P>
<P>
	Officials at the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services  
are reviewing the case because the judge brought up race. The 
department can't change the ruling; only an appeals court could do 
that.

<HEADLINE> IOC Expels 6 Members in Scandal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LAUSANNE, Switzerland (AP) -- The International Olympic Committee  
expelled six members today for taking hundreds of thousands of 
dollars in graft from officials who brought the 2002 Winter Games 
to Salt Lake City. 
</P>
<P>
	The expulsions, on a secret ballot among 90 eligible voters,  
followed an overwhelming vote of confidence for Juan Antonio 
Samaranch, the IOC's embattled president. 
</P>
<P>
	Agustin Arroyo of Ecuador, Zein El Abdin Ahmed Abdel Gadir of  
Sudan, Jean-Claude Ganga of the Congo Republic, Lamine Keita of 
Mali, Sergio Santander of Chile and Paul Wallwork of Samoa were 
believed to be the first IOC members kicked out for corruption in 
the panel's 105 years. 
</P>
<P>
	The vote counts were 72-16 against Arroyo, 86-4 against Gadir,  
88-2 against Ganga, 72-16 against Keita, 76-12 against Santander 
and 67-19 against Wallwork. 
</P>
<P>
	Their expulsions, upholding the actions of IOC leadership in  
late January, marked a watershed in the worst scandal in Olympic 
history and, officials hoped, the start of a reform process to 
regain the luster of the five rings. 
</P>
<P>
	Corporate sponsors, sports officials and even leaders of the  
U.S. Congress have pressured the IOC to make major changes in the 
wake of the scandal, in which Salt Lake bidders gave cash, travel, 
medical care and other lavish gifts to try to win votes. 
</P>
<P>
	At least 30 votes were needed to avoid expulsion, with delegates  
simply writing ``yes'' on a blank piece of paper to oust their 
colleagues or ``no'' to let them stay. 
</P>
<P>
	The vote counts were not immediately released.  
</P>
<P>
	Samaranch said at the start of the emergency general assembly  
that the IOC ``is now on trial'' and must take quick, firm action 
to avoid ``very, very serious'' damage. 
</P>
<P>
	Samaranch said the session, called just to vote on expulsions  
and the start of a reform process, was ``the most important'' in 
IOC history. 
</P>
<P>
	``Our main goal is to take the necessary steps to be absolutely  
certain that this very sad episode never happens again,'' he told 
reporters just before the session started. ``Throughout the 
remaining time of my presidency, I intend to make this our highest 
priority.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In his opening speech to the delegates, Samaranch went further,  
saying he accepted responsibility for the development of a ``crisis 
of this magnitude'' and that the IOC should shoulder the blame 
``even if some of the conduct by bidding cities has itself been 
unethical.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``It is the IOC that is being judged, and the IOC that must deal  
with the situation,'' he said. ``Bidding cities which may have 
acted improperly are a matter of the past; it is our IOC which is 
now on trial.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The committee, he said, ``must root out all forms of  
inappropriate or unethical behavior among our membership.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``It is my firm conviction that, unless we act quickly,  
decisively and unanimously ... the damage which may be done to the 
Olympic movement and to the IOC as a result of recent disclosures 
will be very, very serious,'' Samaranch said. 
</P>
<P>
	There was no immediate comment from any of the ousted members.  
All have professed innocence but all faced daunting evidence of 
wrongdoing. 
</P>
<P>
	Utah investigators, whose work laid the foundation for the  
expulsions, said Arroyo's family received almost $21,000 in cash 
and benefits from Salt Lake bidders. Gadir's son, Zuhair, received 
$17,000 from Salt Lake while a student at Southern Mississippi, 
investigators found.

	Ganga, who led the African boycott of the 1976 Olympics in  
Montreal, and his family, received $270,000 in cash, medical and 
travel expenses and lavish gifts, according to investigators. 
</P>
<P>
	The inquiry found that Keita ``knowing permitted'' organizers to  
make payments totaling more than $97,000 to support his son at the 
University of Utah. They said Santander received a $10,000 
political campaign donation from Salt Lake bid chief Tom Welch and 
Wallwork's wife, the investigation found, received a $30,000 loan 
from Welch while his family got more than $67,000 in travel 
benefits. 
</P>
<P>
	Each of the six used at least his alloted 20 minutes in defense.  
The presentations were described as dignified, with no shouting or 
finger-pointing. 
</P>
<P>
	Ganga, who said earlier in the week that the investigation was a  
``plot against the Third World,'' brought documents, including a 
copy of credit card bills, which he passed to Samaranch. 
</P>
<P>
	Samaranch, in his speech, offered a rundown of accomplishments  
of his 18 years as president and a list of reforms, including 
public release of financial records, changes in selecting Olympic 
cities and establishing an independent reform commission to make 
recommendations in time for another special assembly late this 
year. 
</P>
<P>
	``Starting today, our mandate is to heal the wounds inflicted by  
the inappropriate actions of some members of the IOC and by others 
outside of our organization, and return the prestige to the entire 
Olympic movement,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	The era of the clubby IOC was over, Samaranch declared. It was  
time to open the doors and let people see that the leaders of the 
games could operate as fairly and honestly as the athletes are 
supposed to. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have had to make compromises,'' he said. ``This (gains of  
the past 18 years) has all been accomplished with the best will in 
the world, but not without some cost in terms of the manner in 
which the IOC has operated in the past, as a relatively restricted 
group of individuals acting with a sense of shared values.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But, while he said he wanted to lead the IOC through these  
changes, Samaranch gave perhaps his clearest signal yet that he 
might not finish his term, scheduled to conclude late in 2001. 
</P>
<P>
	``I have personally given the best of myself to the Olympic  
movement over the last 18 years and ... my last service to Olympism 
would be to restructure our organization in order to enter the new 
millennium stronger than ever,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	The IOC is meeting under pressure from sponsors, Olympic sports  
officials and even Congress to take major steps in the wake of the 
$1.2 million bribery scheme that had six members facing expulsion 
votes. 
</P>
<P>
	Sen. John McCain, the powerful Commerce Committee chairman, said  
in a letter this week to the senior Olympic official in the United 
states that ``the demand for Congress to act will be 
irrepressible'' unless the IOC adopts major reforms. 
</P>
<P>
	``The participation of U.S. athletes in the Olympic Games  
represents a vested interest by American citizens in reestablishing 
the integrity of the Olympic ideal of fairness and excellence in 
competition,'' McCain wrote to IOC vice president Anita DeFrantz. 
``This expectation of integrity extends beyond the playing fields 
and into all aspects of the Olympic movement.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In the letter, a copy of which was obtained by The Associated  
Press, McCain noted that his committee has scheduled hearings April 
14 on the Olympic scandal; that the IOC has tax-exempt status in 
the United States; and that sponsorships from U.S. corporations 
``represent a substantial majority of IOC revenues.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``In the strongest terms, let me communicate to you my hope that  
the IOC will move quickly to adopt reforms necessary to provide 
transparency and accountability to the IOC organization and 
processes,'' McCain wrote. ``Without such independent action, the 
demand for Congress to act will be irrepressible.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Another Commerce Committee member, Sen. Ted Stevens, has drawn  
up legislation that would strip the IOC of tax-exempt status, limit 
the percentage of fees sponsors can deduct from taxes and reroute 
U.S. TV rights fees through the U.S. Olympic Committee rather than 
sending the billions of dollars directly to the IOC. 
</P>
<P>
	DeFrantz called McCain's letter ``an expression of concern''  
rather than a threat. 
</P>
<P>
	``Sen. McCain understands, especially in the United States, the  
importance of sponsors to Olympic athletes,'' she said. ``I'm 
confident he knows athletes need financial support.''

<HEADLINE> Monsanto Withdraws Soy Application </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SAO PAULO, Brazil (AP) -- Monsanto has withdrawn an application  
to register its genetically modified soybeans as intellectual 
property in Brazil, agriculture officials said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	The company called the move temporary, but the environmental  
group Greenpeace said it was prompted by weeks of protests by 
various groups, including a lawsuit aimed at halting a license to 
plant the ``Roundup Ready'' soybeans. 
</P>
<P>
	The soybeans are genetically altered to allow the application of  
Monsanto's Roundup herbicides without harming the crop. Monsanto 
had hoped to distribute seeds of the genetically modified soybeans 
in Brazil for planting by midyear and harvest in early 2000. 
</P>
<P>
	A spokesman for Monsanto, who declined to be identified, said  
the company only withdrew the intellectual property application in 
order to make revisions, and plans to file a corrected version 
shortly. 
</P>
<P>
	With 160 million people, Brazil is a key part of Monsanto's plan  
to use genetically engineered crops around the world. 
</P>
<P>
	In September, Brazil's National Technical Commission for  
Biological Safety approved Monsanto's request to produce the 
soybean seeds. But the approval of the agriculture ministry, and 
probably the environmental ministry, will be needed before 
commercial production can begin.

<HEADLINE> Renowned Photographer Callahan Dies </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ATLANTA (AP) -- Harry Callahan, who focused his camera on the  
ordinary and became one of the most influential photographers of 
the 20th century, has died of cancer. He was 86. 
</P>
<P>
	Callahan, who died Monday night at his home in Atlanta, was  
awarded the National Medal of the Arts in 1997, one of the highest 
honors for an artist. An exhibit of his work opened at the National 
Gallery of Art in 1994 and toured nationally. 
</P>
<P>
	``He took the medium of photography and through his passion and  
his discipline he expanded the boundaries of what we think 
photography is,'' said Tom Southall, photography curator at 
Atlanta's High Museum of Art. 
</P>
<P>
	Unlike his mentor Ansel Adams, who is known for his black and  
white photographs of mountainous and snowy landscapes, Callahan 
concentrated on the everyday. His subjects ranged from the cities 
where he lived to his family. 
</P>
<P>
	Among celebrated works in his national exhibit were studies of  
trees in the snow, crowded streets in Detroit, color work from his 
travels during the late '70s and 80's and shots of his wife 
Eleanor. 
</P>
<P>
	Callahan, who was born in Detroit, started taking pictures in  
1938 after he bought his first camera and did not stop until about 
1995 after suffering a stroke. 
</P>
<P>
	Callahan was one of the first photographers to experiment with  
color in the 1940s and 1950s, Southall said. But he said Callahan 
did not exhibit this work because color print technology at that 
point ``was not up to the intensity of his vision.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Callahan also taught at Chicago's Institute of Design and  
established the photography department at the Rhode Island School 
of Design. He moved to Atlanta in 1983 to be closer to his 
daughter.

<HEADLINE> Northwest Rivers Face Flood Threat </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Deep snowpacks in the Pacific Northwest and  
northern states pose a threat of spring flooding, federal 
forecasters warned today. 
</P>
<P>
	The greatest threat is along the Red River of the North, an area  
devastated by flooding in 1997, said Frank Richards of the National 
Weather Service. 
</P>
<P>
	But he added that this year's forecast for a flood stage several  
feet short of the deadly inundation two years ago. The primary 
threat area is from Grand Forks, N.D., north and the Devils Lake 
area, Richards said at the government's annual spring flood 
forecast. 
</P>
<P>
	Idaho, Oregon and Montana also face potential flooding from the  
heavy snowpacks that have accumulated. 
</P>
<P>
	If spring warmth comes gradually the danger will be less,  
Richards said, but continuing cold weather followed by a sudden 
warmup would pose a danger. 
</P>
<P>
	National Weather Service director John J. Kelly stressed that  
the potential for flooding is not limited to the northern snow 
states, however, but can occur anywhere in the event of sudden, 
heavy rains. 
</P>
<P>
	``Floods will occur this year in this nation,'' Kelly said.  
``Now is the time to be thinking about what to do when the warning 
comes.''

<HEADLINE> Heartburn Linked to Cancer </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	People who suffer frequent heartburn and acid reflux run a  
higher risk of developing cancer of the esophagus, and taking 
antacids won't reduce the danger, a study found. 
</P>
<P>
	Heartburn is a burning pain in the chest that people commonly  
associate with spicy foods or overeating. Acid reflux is a 
regurgitation of acid from the stomach into the esophagus because 
of a faulty valve. 
</P>
<P>
	Doctors suspect that over time, the irritating acid causes  
cellular changes in the esophagus that can lead to the most deadly 
form of esophageal cancer, adenocarcinoma. 
</P>
<P>
	The study on the connection was conducted by Swedish researchers  
and published in Thursday's New England Journal of Medicine. 
</P>
<P>
	They said that because treatment of heartburn and acid reflux  
doesn't reduce the cancer risk, sufferers with severe symptoms 
should be watched carefully by their doctors for signs of cancer. 
</P>
<P>
	``Reflux symptoms should not be dismissed as trivial,'' said Dr.  
Jesper Lagergren of the Karolinska Institute in Stockholm. ``If you 
have reflux symptoms and you get new symptoms -- maybe you have 
symptoms for several years and maybe the symptoms seem to change, 
like difficulty swallowing -- then you should seek medical care.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The study found the risk of cancer was almost eight times higher  
among people who suffered heartburn, regurgitation or both at least 
once a week. Acid reflux at night was associated with a risk nearly 
11 times higher. 
</P>
<P>
	There was no increased risk for another form of esophageal  
cancer called squamous-cell carcinoma. 
</P>
<P>
	The overall risk of developing esophageal cancer is extremely  
low. While up to one-fifth of Americans get heartburn, only about 
12,500 people a year develop esophageal cancer, according to the 
American Cancer Society. 
</P>
<P>
	Over the past 20 years, cancer of the esophagus has become  
increasingly prevalent among white men, statistics show, but 
researchers don't know why. Exactly what causes heartburn and acid 
reflux isn't clear. 
</P>
<P>
	Previous studies have indicated a link between acid reflux and  
obesity, smoking and alcohol use, but this study found no 
correlation between those habits and heartburn. And Lagergren said 
there is no proof of the widely held belief that spicy foods cause 
acid reflux or heartburn. 
</P>
<P>
	The study was based on data from 1994 through 1997 on all Swedes  
under 80, or about 8 million people. The researchers interviewed 
189 esophageal cancer patients and 262 stomach cancer patients and 
compared them with 820 randomly selected people. 
</P>
<P>
	The greater the frequency, severity and duration of heartburn  
and acid reflux, the higher the risk of developing esophageal 
cancer was. The study found only a weak link between heartburn and 
stomach cancer. 
</P>
<P>
	The researchers found no indication that treatment -- either with  
antacids or surgery -- reduced the risk. In fact, patients who 
received medical treatment had a higher risk of developing cancer. 
</P>
<P>
	``A possible reason for this is those persons who use medication  
are often the persons with more symptoms,'' Lagergren said. 
</P>
<P>
	In an accompanying editorial, Drs. Sidney Cohen and Henry P.  
Parkman of the Temple University School of Medicine in Philadelphia 
suggested doctors test patients complaining of severe heartburn 
with an endoscope, a flexible tube with a tiny video camera on the 
end that is inserted down the throat to look for signs of cancer. 
</P>
<P>
	``Heartburn must be given respect,'' they wrote. ``Treatment  
should also be aggressive.'' 
</P>
<P>
	However, Lagergren and his colleagues said the effectiveness of  
aggressive treatments, or any treatments for that matter, is 
debatable. 
</P>
<P>
	``To our knowledge, so far, you can't do much,'' Lagergren said.  
``We can't recommend anything.''
