<HEADLINE> Administration Details Budget Cuts  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Clinton administration, under congressional orders to
cut spending by 0.38 percent this fiscal year, said Saturday it will slice more
than $2.3 billion in budgeted funds, including favored programs ``earmarked'' by
members of Congress.
</P>
<P>
	   All Cabinet departments, including Defense, were included in the
across-the-board cut voted by Congress, but the departments were given
flexibility to take money from programs of their choosing to meet the goals,
said Linda Ricci, a spokeswoman for the White House Office of Management and
Budget.
</P>
<P>
	   The cuts were made in line with Clinton administration priorities, but in no
case were the individual reductions more than 15 percent, as Congress mandated,
Ms. Ricci said.
</P>
<P>
	   By category, the cuts will amount to $478 million divided among 2,372
projects specified in congressional ``earmarks;'' nearly $1.68 billion in a wide
variety of other government programs and $192 million in salary and expenses,
she said.
</P>
<P>
	   The earmarks affected included such areas as transportation, housing, health
and human services and environmental protection.
</P>
<P>
	   Wherever possible, no reductions were made in civilian federal personnel
levels, Ms. Ricci said; Congress ordered no cuts be made in the ranks of the
armed forces in trimming Pentagon spending.
</P>
<P>
	   Another of the priorities was that the cuts come from amounts that exceeded
what President Clinton requested for the current fiscal year, which ends Sept.
30, Ms. Ricci said.
</P>
<P>
	   The Republican-run Congress extracted the administration's agreement to the
0.38 percent spending cut in November during bargaining over the final shape of
the federal budget, weeks after the start of the fiscal year.
</P>
<P>
	   House Speaker Dennis Hastert, R-Ill., said at the time that the requirement
would ``force these agencies to take a close look at their budget and see what
frivolous spending can be eliminated.''

<HEADLINE> Calif. Gov. Plans Funds For Elderly  </HEADLINE>
   By DOUG WILLIS Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   SACRAMENTO, Calif. (AP) -- A $271 million proposal that would add dozens of
nursing home inspectors, expand nursing-home alternatives and raise pay for
those who care for the elderly is Gov. Gray Davis' top health care priority this
year, aides say.
</P>
<P>
	   An advocate for the elderly said the plan, if approved by lawmakers, would
go a long way in improving California's nursing homes. The facilities were
targeted by federal officials in a scathing 1998 report.
</P>
<P>
	   ``These are things our organization has wanted since we started over 17
years ago,'' Patricia McGinnis of California Advocates for Nursing Home Reform,
a consumer group of family and friends of patients, said Saturday. ``They're so
good it's hard to believe they'll actually become law.''
</P>
<P>
	   Davis will give the Legislature details of the 21-point plan as part of the
$85 billion, 2000-01 budget package he proposes Monday.
</P>
<P>
	   The proposals, first announced in Davis' State of the State address last
week, include new state income tax credits of up to $500 for those who care for
elderly relatives at home, pay raises for home care and nursing home workers,
more money to recruit and train nursing care workers and 199 more nursing home
inspectors.
</P>
<P>
	   The plan would also expand adult day care centers, community senior centers
and full-service residential facilities, reduce the amount low-income senior
citizens must pay for home care, increase fines for nursing homes that neglect
or abuse patients and make it easier to revoke nursing home licences.
</P>
<P>
	   Nursing home workers would get 5 percent pay raises, at a cost of $66
million.
</P>
<P>
	   Although most of those workers are employees of privately owned facilities,
their contracts with the state to care for Medi-Cal patients can be used to
mandate that the extra state payments be used for staff pay raises,
administration sources said.
</P>
<P>
	   California nursing homes were the target of a scathing 1998 General
Accounting Office report. Of 62 nursing home deaths in 1993, 34 involved ``care
that was unacceptable and that sometimes endangered their health and safety,''
it found.
</P>
<P>
	   California has about 1,500 nursing homes caring for about 150,000 patients.
Currently, about 290 state inspectors are responsible for inspecting nursing
homes and about 4,500 other health facilities.

<HEADLINE> Riley: Teachers Feel Ill-Prepared  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Because teacher requirements are changing, most
instructors are feeling ill-prepared for the classroom, Education Secretary
Richard Riley said.
</P>
<P>
	   Riley said there are too few ``talented, dedicated'' teachers in the first
place.
</P>
<P>
	   ``It's gotten so bad that some schools have been forced to put any warm body
in front of a classroom,'' Riley said in remarks prepared for delivery Sunday at
a National Conference on Teacher Quality sponsored by the Education Department.
</P>
<P>
	   ``It has been estimated that 250,000 teachers are working without proper
preparation in course content, or without any kind of training in how to
teach,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
	   Riley said the pressing needs of American schools include upgraded
``preparation, induction, mentoring, support, professional development and pay''
of teachers. And to start with, he said, schools of education must gain proper
status.
</P>
<P>
	   ``They can no longer be university backwaters, as some have been allowed to
come,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The challenge is to make sure that there is a talented, dedicated teacher
in every classroom. We are falling short of that goal.''
</P>
<P>
	   He quoted a recent survey that found only 36 percent of teachers who felt
they were ``very well prepared'' to meet currently increased standards in
grammar and high schools.
</P>
<P>
	   Much of the problem, he said, ``is the changing nature of teaching itself,''
where teachers are expected to teach not only average pupils but also those with
physical and emotional problems, hunger, language problems and uninterested
parents.
</P>
<P>
	   He spoke of one high school teacher, Mark Dozier in Richmond, Va., who
teaches world history to students from Bosnia, Russia, Yugoslavia, Vietnam and
Cambodia without even the help of an English-as-a-second-language teacher.
</P>
<P>
	   ``There is nothing wrong with asking teachers to teach to higher standards,
and we must,'' Riley said. ``But I believe that it is wrong -- and
counterproductive -- to ask teachers to do it without the right tools.''

<HEADLINE> Report: Grant Going Pro for Family  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
    KNOXVILLE, Tenn. (AP) -- Tennessee junior free safety Deon Grant is turning
pro so that he can help out his family financially, his mother told The
Tennessean for a story to be published Sunday.
</P>
<P>
	   Grant's mother, Joyce Grant, told the newspaper Saturday that her son had
submitted the necessary paperwork to the NFL and that she had spoken by phone
with Tennessee coach Phillip Fulmer. The deadline for college juniors to notify
the NFL of plans to enter the draft is Monday.
</P>
<P>
	   Tennessee also is losing junior tailback Jamal Lewis, according to The
Tennessean and The Knoxville News Sentinel. And junior offensive guard Cosey
Coleman was expected to follow suit.
</P>
<P>
	   Grant, on his way back to Knoxville from his home in Augusta, Ga., was
unavailable for comment.
</P>
<P>
	   "Deon knows there will be some disappointed people in Tennessee, but he just
wants everyone to support him," Joyce Grant told the newspaper. "This is a hard
one for me to accept, but he knows what he needs to do. I'm going to be 100
percent behind him."
</P>
<P>
	   Grant, a finalist for the Thorpe Award as the nation's top defensive back,
told his mother his decision to skip his senior season was based largely on his
desire to help his family.
</P>
<P>
	   "He told me, 'Mom, there's a need,"' said Joyce Grant, a single parent
raising Grant's two younger sisters. "He loves his family and said he wanted to
do whatever he could to make things better."
</P>
<P>
	   Before she would give Grant her blessing, Joyce Grant said she made her son
promise he would return to school at some point and get his degree. Grant was
majoring in engineering.
</P>
<P>
	   The 6-foot-3, 205-pound Grant has been projected to go in the middle of the
first round or the second round of the draft.
</P>
<P>
	   He tied for the national lead with nine interceptions and was second on the
team with 69 tackles.

<HEADLINE> Triplets Born to Grandmother of 15  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   YAKIMA, Wash. (AP) -- A 54-year-old mother of eight who has 15 grandchildren
gave birth to triplets Saturday.
</P>
<P>
	   Arcelia Garcia gave birth by Caesarean section to three healthy girls at
Yakima Valley Memorial Hospital. The babies, who are not identical, were in the
intensive care unit but were not receiving oxygen.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The girls are all in stable condition and doing well,'' said Linda Kraft,
vice president of corporate communications for the hospital. ``The mother is
recovering well and doing well, too.''
</P>
<P>
	   Mrs. Garcia was in the 35th week of the 40-week period of a pregnancy, Kraft
said.
</P>
<P>
	   The triplets were born at 4:59 p.m., 5 p.m. and 5:02 p.m., Kraft said. The
first weighed 3 pounds, 7 ounces; the second weighed 5 pounds, 12 1/2 ounces;
the third was 5 pounds, 1 1/2 ounces, she said.
</P>
<P>
	   ``It went very smoothly. Everything went as planned,'' said Francisco
Garcia, 34, one of Mrs. Garcia's sons.
</P>
<P>
	   Mrs. Garcia plans to return to work as a farmworker as soon as her health
and the babies allow, she said before the births.
</P>
<P>
	   Originally from Michoacan, Mexico, Mrs. Garcia and her family moved in 1976
to Sunnyside, a town about 30 miles southeast of Yakima, and she has been a U.S.
citizen since 1996.
</P>
<P>
	   Her eight children went to the hospital to be with her Saturday. But her
husband, Guillermo Garcia, 60 -- also a farmworker -- stayed behind.
</P>
<P>
	   ``He didn't want to come because he's very emotional ... but he is at home,
he is really happy,'' Francisco Garcia said.
</P>
<P>
	   A woman in her 50s pregnant with triplets is extremely rare, especially
without the aid of fertility drugs, said Tom Easterling, a maternal and fetal
medicine specialist at the University of Washington Medical Center. Mrs.
Garcia's pregnancy was natural.

    NEW YORK (AP) -- Pitcher Chris Haney beat Saturday's midnight EST deadline
for free agents to re-sign with their former teams, agreeing to a minor league
contract with the Cleveland Indians.
</P>
<P>
	   Haney, 31, was 0-2 with a 4.69 ERA in four starts and nine relief
appearances last season. The Indians offered him salary arbitration Dec. 7, but
he rejected it 12 days later.
</P>
<P>
	   Four other free agents who rejected arbitration offers from their former
clubs let the deadline pass: outfielder Shawon Dunston (New York Mets),
right-hander Omar Olivares (Oakland), left-hander Darren Oliver (St. Louis) and
right-hander Steve Trachsel (Chicago Cubs).
</P>
<P>
	   That means they cannot re-sign with those clubs until May 1.
</P>
<P>
	   Right-hander Juan Guzman, who rejected an arbitration offer from Cincinnati,
agreed Friday night to a $12.5 million, two-year contract with the Tampa Bay
Devil Rays.
</P>
<P>
	   Guzman, 33, was a combined 11-12 with a 3.74 ERA in 33 starts for Baltimore
and Cincinnati.
</P>
<P>
	   He gets $6 million in each of the next two seasons under the deal agreed to
Friday night, and Tampa Bay has a $7 million option for 2002 with a $500,000
buyout.
</P>
<P>
	   In the first two years, $3 million a season is deferred at 3 percent
interest, payable in the first and second years after the contract ends.
</P>
<P>
	   If the option is exercised, $3.5 million of the 2002 salary is deferred
until the third year after the contract ends. The option would become guaranteed
if he has 55 starts combined in the next two years, or 30 starts or 200 innings
in 2001.
</P>
<P>
	   He also can earn $1 million per season in performance bonuses: $125,000 for
180 innings, $175,000 for 200 innings, $200,000 for 210 innings, $300,000 for
220 innings and $100,000 each for 32 and 34 starts.
</P>
<P>
	   Tampa Bay also agreed Saturday to one-year contracts with two players
eligible for salary arbitration: Cory Lidle and left-hander Tony Saunders.

<P>
	   MILWAUKEE (AP) -- Scott Williams' ordinary layup with two-tenths of a second
left in double overtime gave the Milwaukee Bucks an extraordinary 130-129
victory over Washington on Saturday night.
</P>
<P>
	   Both teams were stretched to the absolute limit in a phenomenal game
featuring eight lead changes in the two overtimes, including three in the final
9.7 seconds.
</P>
<P>
	   Ray Allen, Sam Cassell, Glenn Robinson, Rod Strickland and Juwan Howard all
fouled out during the second overtime, but Williams hit the last of a half-dozen
heart-stopping shots that had the Bradley Center crowd and both benches in
hysterics.
</P>
<P>
	   Mitch Richmond, who finished 25 points, hit a desperate fallaway jumper with
1.6 seconds left to give Washington a 129-128 lead. After a timeout, Vinny Del
Negro inbounded the ball to Williams, who spun on Jahidi White and scored
easily. Washington's last tip attempt finally missed.
</P>
<P>
	   Milwaukee was up 126-120 in the second overtime with 1:40 to play, but the
Wizards scored seven straight points and took the lead on Chris Whitney's free
throws with 43 seconds left.
</P>
<P>
	   After Washington's Aaron Williams missed two free throws with 14.8 seconds
left, Tim Thomas hit a turnaround jumper with 9.7 seconds left that looked like
the game-winner.

	   But the game had barely started.
</P>
<P>
	   Tracy Murray, who finished with 27 points, hit a last-second jumper in
regulation, scored seven points in the first overtime and looked like a hero for
the Wizards. But Cassell made two free throws with two-tenths of a second left
to force double overtime.
</P>
<P>
	   Robinson led the Bucks with 34 points, and Allen added 28. Strickland had 24
points and 12 assists for the Wizards. Cassell had 16 points and 10 assists.

	   Ervin Johnson, who scored five points in the second overtime, had 18
rebounds. Howard added 20 points for the Wizards.
</P>
<P>
	   Milwaukee won its fifth straight home game, while the Wizards lost for the
fifth time in six games.
</P>
<P>
	   Though they lost a heartbreaker, the Wizards looked nothing like the team
that lost twice to the Chicago Bulls earlier this week. Washington had five
players in double figures, led by the streak-shooting Murray, who hit seven
3-pointers.
</P>
<P>
	   The Bucks got to overtime by erasing a seven-point deficit in the final 1:40
of regulation. Robinson missed an easy layup as time expired that would have
given Milwaukee the win.
</P>
<P>
	   In the first overtime, Murray hit back-to-back 3-pointers, and his free
throw with 41 seconds left gave the Wizards a 117-116 lead. Strickland then made
one of two free throws with 5.3 seconds left, but Cassell drove the lane and was
fouled by Aaron Williams.
</P>
<P>
	   With the Washington bench gleefully shouting epithets in his face, Cassell
hit two free throws with two-tenths of a second left, and the game went to a
second OT.
</P>
<P>
	   Johnson scored on an offensive rebound and converted a three-point play as
the Bucks went up 126-120 with 1:40 left, but Richmond scored five straight
points. After Whitney and Thomas exchanged potential game-winning scores,
Richmond drove the lane and lost the ball out of bounds, but the officials gave
possession to the Wizards. Richmond then hit a jumper while falling away from a
Bucks defender.
</P>
<P>
	   Washington was up 101-94 with 1:40 left in regulation, but Thomas and Allen
hit 3-pointers. Allen then hit a twisting layup while being fouled, and his free
throw with 48 seconds left tied the score 103-103.
</P>
<P>
	   After a Washington turnover, Cassell grabbed an offensive rebound and was
fouled. Cassell hit two free throws with 12.5 seconds to play, but Murray hit a
long jumper with 3.6 seconds left to tie the score 105-105.
</P>
<P>
	   Milwaukee got the ball to Robinson, who drove past Howard, but left a
one-foot layup short as time expired.
</P>
<P>
	   Robinson hit seven of his first eight shots and had 15 points in the first
quarter.

	   Pippen finished with 12 points and 10 rebounds. Damon Stoudamire added 13
before he was knocked out of the game by Tom Gugliotta's hard screen in the
third quarter.
</P>
<P>
	   Gugliotta, returning to Portland for the first time since suffering a
seizure on the team bus at the Rose Garden on Dec. 17, had 13 points and nine
rebounds.
</P>
<P>
	   Kidd, who tied his season low with four points on 2-of-14 shooting in Friday
night's loss to San Antonio, shot 5-of-14.
</P>
<P>
	   The Blazers led 12-2 to start the game, but Phoenix started hitting from the
outside and pulled ahead. Kidd, Chapman and Day all hit long jumpers during a
10-1 run to end the first half and put the Suns up 47-35.
</P>
<P>
	   Frustrated by their own mistakes, the Blazers could barely contain their
anger in the third quarter. After Stoudamire scored 11 points in the first 6 1/2
minutes to cut the lead to 59-53, he was flattened by Gugliotta on a backcourt
pick.
</P>
<P>
	   Rasheed Wallace, argumentative all game, shouted and flailed his arms at the
referee and was hit with a technical. The intensity caught on with Wallace's
teammates, and a layup by Wells pulled the Blazers within five at 66-61.
</P>
<P>
	   The Blazers, who missed nine of their first 18 free throws, sank four
straight to enter the fourth quarter down 68-65.
</P>
<P>
	   Wallace fouled out with eight points, breaking his streak of 26 straight
games in double figures.

    SEATTLE (AP) -- Kobe Bryant scored 31 points as the Los Angeles Lakers
extended their winning streak to 14 games Saturday night, overcoming a 19-point
deficit to beat Seattle 110-100.
</P>
<P>
	   The Lakers, down 68-49 in the first minute of the third quarter, outscored
the Sonics 34-10 during the rest of the quarter to take an 83-78 lead in the
fourth quarter. Glen Rice had 15 points to lead the rally.
</P>
<P>
	   Los Angeles continued the onslaught by outscoring the Sonics 21-5 to start
the fourth period and took a 104-83 lead on Rice's 3-pointer for a 104-83 lead
with four minutes left.
</P>
<P>
	   Rice finished with 24 points, and Shaquille O'Neal added 23.
</P>
<P>
	   Vin Baker led the Sonics with 31 points, Gary Payton had 23 points and Ruben
Patterson added 21.
</P>
<P>
	   The Lakers outscored Seattle 61-34 in the second half. Until a late flurry
after the Lakers led 104-83, it appeared the Sonics had a good chance to equal
their record low of 27 points in a half.
</P>
<P>
	   The Lakers depth was key.
</P>
<P>
	   Derek Fisher hit a basket to put the Lakers up 78-76 and added a 3-pointer
for an 83-78 advantage.
</P>
<P>
	   Payton took the inbounds pass with 1.7 seconds left in the quarter. He was
so frustrated that he held the ball until the clock sounded and then flung the
ball to the floor in disgust and walked to the bench.
</P>
<P>
	   Patterson boasted when he was signed by the Sonics that he was a
"Kobe-Stopper." Neither Patterson nor any of the Sonics slowed down Bryant, who
was 11-for-18 from the field.
</P>
<P>
	   Patterson appeared to have spent all his energy in the first half. He had
two points, one rebound and four turnovers in 14 minutes in the second half.

	   MIAMI (AP) -- Cuban-American leaders, encouraged by a lawmaker's bid to keep
6-year-old Elian Gonzalez in the United States while a judge considers his case,
said Saturday they would temporarily halt protests against plans to return the
child to Cuba. "We have called for a cautious, temporary hold of the civil
disobedience campaign," said Ramon Saul Sanchez, head of Democracy Movement.
About 100 protesters have been arrested since Thursday, and another protest had

Most Teachers Said To Feel 'Ill-Prepared'
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Because teacher requirements are changing, most
instructors are feeling ill-prepared for the classroom, Education Secretary
Richard Riley said. Riley said there are too few "talented, dedicated" teachers
in the first place. "It's gotten so bad that some schools have been forced to
put any warm body in front of a classroom," Riley said in remarks prepared for
delivery Sunday at a National Conference on Teacher Quality sponsored by the
Education Department. "It has been estimated that 250,000 teachers are working
without proper preparation in course content, or without any kind of training in
how to teach," he said.

	   FORT CAMPBELL, Ky. (AP) -- A soldier pleaded guilty to a reduced charge
Saturday in the beating death of a barracks mate who had been rumored to be gay.
Army Spc. Justin R. Fisher, 26, was sentenced to 12 1/2 years in prison. Fisher
admitted he lied to military investigators and obstructed the investigation when
he wiped blood from a baseball bat that Pvt. Calvin Glover used to kill Pfc.
Barry Winchell, who had been sleeping. Under a plea agreement, the Army dropped
other charges, including participating as a principal to premeditated murder and
acting as an accessory after the fact.

he walked easily from the gate of the Dalai Lama's house to a yellow car. The

exhausted and suffering from blistered feet and scratched hands after his

streak with a 107-94 victory Saturday night.
</P>

    DENVER (AP) -- Nick Van Exel stepped up -- and out -- for the Denver
Nuggets.
</P>
<P>
	   Van Exel was 7-of-11 from 3-point range in a 32-point performance as Denver
beat Charlotte for the first time in nine meetings, 97-92 on Saturday night.
</P>
<P>
	   "The basket was like an ocean," Van Exel said. "I didn't think they would
double Antonio McDyess the whole game and leave me open on the perimeter."
</P>
<P>
	   Van Exel was 11-of-20 from the field, and also had eight assists.
</P>
<P>
	   "Nick had a terrific night," Nuggets coach Dan Issel said. "We rode on his

the road.
</P>
<P>
	   "Our main guy (Eddie Jones) isn't here," Charlotte coach Paul Silas said.
"That's 19 points a night we are not getting and we are losing by four or five a

    NEW YORK (AP) -- Pitcher Omar Olivares beat Saturday's midnight EST deadline
for free agents to re-sign with their former teams, getting a two-year deal with
the Oakland Athletics.
</P>
<P>
	   Olivares' deal came right before deadline. Had he not reached agreement in
time, the right-hander would not have been allowed to sign with the A's until
May 1.
</P>
<P>
	   Earlier in the day, pitcher Chris Haney agreed to a minor league contract
with the Cleveland Indians.
</P>
<P>
	   Three other free agents who rejected arbitration offers from their former
clubs let the deadline pass: outfielder Shawon Dunston (New York Mets),
left-hander Darren Oliver (St. Louis) and right-hander Steve Trachsel (Chicago
Cubs).
</P>
<P>
	   That means they cannot re-sign with those clubs until May 1.
</P>
<P>
	   Olivares, obtained in a trade with Anaheim on July 29, went 7-2 with a 4.34
ERA in 12 starts for the A's. He went 15-11 with a 4.16 ERA in 32 starts overall
last season with the Angels and A's.
</P>
<P>
	   Olivares' deal has a player option to terminate the contract after one
season.
</P>
<P>
	   Haney, 31, was 0-2 with a 4.69 ERA in four starts and nine relief
appearances last season. The Indians offered him salary arbitration Dec. 7, but
he rejected it 12 days later.
</P>
<P>
	   Right-hander Juan Guzman, who rejected an arbitration offer from Cincinnati,
agreed Friday night to a $12.5 million, two-year contract with the Tampa Bay
Devil Rays.
</P>
<P>
	   Guzman, 33, was a combined 11-12 with a 3.74 ERA in 33 starts for Baltimore
and Cincinnati.
</P>
<P>
	   He gets $6 million in each of the next two seasons under the deal agreed to
Friday night, and Tampa Bay has a $7 million option for 2002 with a $500,000
buyout.
</P>
<P>
	   In the first two years, $3 million a season is deferred at 3 percent
interest, payable in the first and second years after the contract ends.
</P>
<P>
	   If the option is exercised, $3.5 million of the 2002 salary is deferred
until the third year after the contract ends. The option would become guaranteed
if he has 55 starts combined in the next two years, or 30 starts or 200 innings
in 2001.
</P>
<P>
	   He also can earn $1 million per season in performance bonuses: $125,000 for
180 innings, $175,000 for 200 innings, $200,000 for 210 innings, $300,000 for
220 innings and $100,000 each for 32 and 34 starts.

eligible for salary arbitration: Cory Lidle and left-hander Tony Saunders.

<TEXT>
<P>
    PORTLAND, Ore. (AP) -- Bonzi Wells scored 13 of his career-high 23 points in
the fourth quarter, and Brian Grant's dunk with 31.5 seconds left helped the
Portland Trail Blazers rally to beat the Phoenix Suns 96-91 on Saturday night.
</P>
<P>
	   Grant added 21 points and 11 rebounds for the Blazers, who came back from a
10-point deficit early in the fourth quarter.
</P>
<P>
	   Rex Chapman led the Suns with 20 points, and Jason Kidd had 13 points and 14
assists.
</P>
<P>
	   Todd Day's 3-pointer put the Suns ahead 76-66 with 9:47 left, but the
Blazers started getting the ball inside to Wells, and the second-year forward
rarely missed. He hit six layups in the final eight minutes, including one to
put the Blazers ahead 90-89 with 1:41 to go.
</P>
<P>
	   A 20-foot jumper by Chapman gave the Suns the lead, but Grant's dunk put
Portland up 92-91. After Detlef Schrempf hit two free throws to make it 94-91
with 15.8 seconds left, Chapman was stripped by Scottie Pippen, who got an easy
breakaway dunk to seal it.
</P>
<P>
	   Pippen finished with 12 points and 10 rebounds. Damon Stoudamire added 13
before he was knocked out of the game by Tom Gugliotta's hard screen in the
third quarter. Stoudamire sustained a mild concussion on the play, the team
said.
</P>
<P>
	   Gugliotta, returning to Portland for the first time since suffering a
seizure on the team bus at the Rose Garden on Dec. 17, had 13 points and nine
rebounds.
</P>
<P>
	   Kidd, who tied his season low with four points on 2-of-14 shooting in Friday
night's loss to San Antonio, shot 5-of-14.
</P>
<P>
	   The Blazers led 12-2 to start the game, but Phoenix started hitting from the
outside and pulled ahead. Kidd, Chapman and Day all hit long jumpers during a
10-1 run to end the first half and put the Suns up 47-35.
</P>
<P>
	   Frustrated by their own mistakes, the Blazers could barely contain their
anger in the third quarter. After Stoudamire scored 11 points in the first 6 1/2
minutes to cut the lead to 59-53, he was flattened by Gugliotta on a backcourt
pick.
</P>
<P>
	   Rasheed Wallace, argumentative all game, shouted and flailed his arms at the
referee and was hit with a technical. The intensity caught on with Wallace's
teammates, and a layup by Wells pulled the Blazers within five at 66-61.
</P>
<P>
	   The Blazers, who missed nine of their first 18 free throws, sank four
straight to enter the fourth quarter down 68-65.
</P>
<P>
	   Wallace fouled out with eight points, breaking his streak of 26 straight
games in double figures.

	   Florida scored first with 7:53 gone in the first. Oleg Kvasha took a shot
from 20 feet out that San Jose goalie Steve Shields stopped, but the puck
dribbled beneath his right skate and into the net.
</P>
<P>
	   The Panthers scored again at 14:36 of the period. Shields blocked a shot by
Peter Worrell, but former Sharks player Ray Whitney picked up the puck and
scored his 17th from short range.
</P>
<P>
	   San Jose cut its deficit in half 3:20 into the final period when defenseman
Mike Rathje scored his first goal on a shot from the right face-off circle.
</P>
<P>
	   However, Bure made it 3-1 at 7:03, scoring from on a rebound of his own
shot.
</P>
<P>
	   Then, with 7:58 left, San Jose's Todd Harvey rebounded his own shot and
scored to make it 3-2. It was Harvey's first goal since being acquired from the
New York Rangers in the same trade that sent Vernon to Florida.
</P>
<P>
	   Bure answered with an unassisted goal at 13:28 when he picked up the puck
behind the net, curled around and put it past a diving Shields.

<P>
    CALGARY, Alberta (AP) -- Phil Housley scored with 32 seconds left in
overtime, and Jarome Iginla had two goals as the Calgary Flames defeated the
Tampa Bay Lightning 3-2 Saturday night.
</P>
<P>
	   The winning goal was set up by Valeri Bure who, playing the puck from behind
the Tampa Bay goal, banked the puck off the back of the net and back to himself
to elude defenseman Andrei Zyuzin.
</P>
<P>
	   Bure then came around in front of the net and sent a back-hand pass across
the crease to Housley, who shot high to beat goalie Dan Cloutier.
</P>
<P>
	   Iginla banged in the rebound of a Bure shot to tie the game 2-2 at 13:54 of
the third.
</P>
<P>
	   Cloutier was outstanding in keeping the Lightning in the game. Calgary
outshot Tampa Bay 38-17.
</P>
<P>
	   The Flames are 9-1-1 in their last 11 home games.
</P>
<P>
	   Mike Sillinger and Chris Gratton scored for Tampa Bay, winless in its past
11 (0-9-2).
</P>
<P>
	   The Lightning took a 2-1 lead with 1:44 left in the second period. Cloutier
denied Hnat Domenichelli from the side of the net and the Lightning broke out of
the zone. Darcy Tucker fed Gratton, who got behind defenseman Bobby Dollas, and
Gratton's slap shot beat Fred Brathwaite to the glove side.
</P>
<P>
	   Tampa Bay tied it 1-1 at 2:06 of the second when Sillinger capped a
perfectly executed 3-on-2 rush by one-timing a pass by Bruce Gardiner past
Brathwaite.
</P>
<P>
	   Iginla scored at 11:47 of the first, deflecting Robyn Regehr's shot past
Cloutier.
</P>
<P>
	   Calgary lost defenseman Steve Smith with 8:37 left in the third when the
Flames captain was taken off the ice on a stretcher after being injured in a
freak accident.
</P>
<P>
	   While defending a 2-on-1, Smith was falling forward in an attempt to break
up the rush, when his head was elbowed by his teammate Dollas, who was
scrambling back.
</P>
<P>
	   The game was delayed for eight minutes.
</P>
<P>
	   Smith was taken to a hospital for precautionary X-rays, but the Flames said
he was conscious and had movement in his arms and legs.

Gore, Bradley Argue Health Care
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
	   JOHNSTON, Iowa (AP) -- Bill Bradley and Al Gore argued about health care,
farm policy and education in their debate today -- themes now familiar after
four prior Democratic presidential campaign debates. Bradley accused Gore of
trying to scare Iowa voters with misrepresentations of his health care proposal.
"What we have here is a scare tactic," he said. "... I reject that kind of
politics." Gore opened the debate with a rebuttal to Bradley's claim that he'd
been down in a Washington bunker in an administration trying to survive scandal
and impeachment. He said his seven years as vice president to President Clinton
have been a time of the greatest economic progress in American history.

members of Congress. All Cabinet departments, including Defense, were included

	   BUENOS AIRES, Argentina (AP) -- A group of retired Argentine naval officers
have been arrested for allegedly kidnapping children born to political prisoners
during the 1976-83 dictatorship, local reports said. Argentine news agency
Diarios y Noticias said six officers were arrested late Friday, while a report
in the daily Pagina/12 newspaper said nine former officers had been detained.
The arrests were first made public Saturday. The former officers are suspected
of taking 12 babies from political prisoners held at the base, the reports said.
Several officers are accused of illegally adopting several of the babies.

Most Teachers Said To Feel 'Ill-Prepared'
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Because teacher requirements are changing, most
instructors are feeling ill-prepared for the classroom, Education Secretary
Richard Riley said. Riley said there are too few "talented, dedicated" teachers
in the first place. "It's gotten so bad that some schools have been forced to
put any warm body in front of a classroom," Riley said in remarks prepared for
delivery Sunday at a National Conference on Teacher Quality sponsored by the
Education Department. "It has been estimated that 250,000 teachers are working
without proper preparation in course content, or without any kind of training in
how to teach," he said.

smiles Saturday after a visit with the Dalai Lama. The 17th Karmapa grinned as
he walked easily from the gate of the Dalai Lama's house to a yellow car. The
teen-ager, who arrived unexpectedly at a hotel in this Indian city on Wednesday,
had been described by sources close to the Dalai Lama's administration as
exhausted and suffering from blistered feet and scratched hands after his
journey. He appeared well during the brief moments journalists saw him Saturday.

   POMONA, Calif. (AP) -- A mother whose 5-month-old son died after being left
for hours in her car on a hot summer day was sentenced to 15 years to life in
prison.
</P>
<P>
	   Kimberly Sue Fudge was sentenced Thursday for second-degree murder in the
death of her son, Cailan Cutillo, on June 14.
</P>
<P>
	   The woman had gone to a Claremont hotel at 7:30 a.m. that day to talk to the
boy's father following an argument. She eventually fell asleep in the room as
temperatures outside rose above 90 degrees.
</P>
<P>
	   Authorities said the infant, strapped in a car seat, was left unattended for
more than six hours. He died before Ms. Fudge returned to the car, found him not
breathing and called for help.
</P>
<P>
	   The boy's father was not charged.

<P>
   SEOUL, South Korea (AP) -- South Korean Prime Minister Kim Jong-pil appointed
the leader of his party as his successor Sunday, party officials said.
</P>
<P>
	   The new prime minister will be Park Tae-joon, president of the United
Liberal Democrats, officials said. Park and the outgoing prime minister, who
belongs to the same party, announced the decision after they met on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
	   Kim said last month that he would step down as prime minister to help lead
his party and run in parliamentary elections on April 13. Park is expected to
take over as prime minister in a few days.
</P>
<P>
	   Their party is a partner in South Korea's ruling coalition with President
Kim Dae-jung's National Congress for New Politics.
</P>
<P>
	   Kim Jong-pil has the right to appoint his successor as part of the deal the
two parties reached to form the coalition. With the support of the United
Liberal Democrats, Kim Dae-jung narrowly won the December 1997 presidential
election.
</P>
<P>
	   Park, 73, served as president of Pohang Iron and Steel Corp., the nation's
largest steel maker, from 1968 and 1981 and as chairman of the same company
until 1992.
</P>
<P>
	   He was first elected as a lawmaker in 1981 and has held various high-ranking
party posts until becoming the party's president in 1997.

   WELLINGTON, New Zealand (AP) -- An American tourist drowned while kayaking in
a river in rugged mountains in New Zealand, police said Sunday.
</P>
<P>
	   Dr. Robin Dodd, from Cleveland, was with a group of kayakers who on Saturday
tackled a treacherous stretch of the Hokitika River, on the west coast of New
Zealand's South Island, 155 miles south of the capital of Wellington, Sgt. Mark
Berryman said.
</P>
<P>
	   Dodd got into trouble while the group tried to paddle through a set of
rapids, he said.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The first two got through all right, but Dr. Dodd's kayak got wedged
between two rocks and under strong rushing water,'' Berryman said. His
companions were unable to free him, and he drowned, police said.
</P>
<P>
	   On Sunday, police and rescuers traveled to the isolated area in an attempt
to recover the body.
</P>
<P>
	   Berryman said the eight in the group were experienced kayakers.
</P>
<P>
	   ``They spend their lives traveling the world and tackling rivers like
this,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> Uzbekistan Holds Presidential Vote  </HEADLINE>
   By TIMOFEI ZHUKOV Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   TASHKENT, Uzbekistan (AP) -- Uzbekistan held its second ever presidential
elections on Sunday, with incumbent Islam Karimov expected to easily win a
second term as leader of Central Asia's most populous country.
</P>
<P>
	   Nearly 7,800 polling stations were open to accommodate 12.7 million eligible
voters. Preliminary results were expected Monday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
	   By noon Sunday, turnout was already 54 percent.
</P>
<P>
	   Karimov, nominated by the Fidokorlar (The Dedicated) party, is a former
Communist who was elected president of an independent Uzbekistan just days after
the Soviet Union collapsed in December 1991.
</P>
<P>
	   Voters approved a referendum in 1995 that extended Karimov's first term
until to the year 2000. Under the Uzbek constitution, a president can only serve
two terms in succession.
</P>
<P>
	   Many Uzbeks complain that they cannot support a family on monthly wages that
are the equivalent of about $20 to $30. But they also say they value Karimov for
ensuring political stability and avoiding the kind of upheaval that has
unsettled the former Soviet republics of Georgia, Armenia and Azerbaijan in the
Caucasus region as well as neighboring Tajikistan and Kyrgyzstan.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The strategy chosen by Karimov is working successfully,'' said Leonid
Levitin, a political analyst from Germany and one of 120 foreign observers on
hand for the vote.
</P>
<P>
	   Karimov's only opponent, Abdulkhafiz Dzhalalov, also a former Communist
Party official, is the leader of the People's Democratic Party and director of
the Institute for Philosophy and Law.
</P>
<P>
	   After voting, Dzhalalov said he had voted for the incumbent. ``I voted for
democracy and stability. I do not make it a secret that I voted for Karimov.
</P>
<P>
	   Since his election nearly 10 years ago, Karimov has ruled Uzbekistan with a
firm hand. All opposition parties are banned and censorship is tight.

<HEADLINE> Report: China Sells Inmates' Organs  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   HONG KONG (AP) -- A Chinese hospital is selling liver transplants from
executed prisoners, a Hong Kong newspaper reported Sunday, fueling allegations
that China profits from its frequent use of the death penalty.
</P>
<P>
	   Sun Yat-sen University of Medical Sciences No. 1 Hospital is charging
$38,500 per transplant, the South China Morning Post said. It said more than 40
patients from mainland China, Hong Kong, Malaysia and Thailand have received
transplants.
</P>
<P>
	   A doctor at the hospital in the southern city of Guangzhou was quoted as
saying that most organs come from prisoners. The newspaper did not identify the
doctor by name.
</P>
<P>
	   Beijing consistently denies selling organs, and says they are transplanted
from executed prisoners only if they or their families consent.
</P>
<P>
	   An operator who answered the telephone Sunday at the hospital said all of
its offices were closed.
</P>
<P>
	   About 80 percent of the transplant fee pays for drugs to prevent the immune
system from rejecting the new organ, the Post said.
</P>
<P>
	   The report said at least five Hong Kong patients received transplants at the
hospital, and two have since died.

<HEADLINE> Influenza Epidemic Grips Britain  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
    LONDON (AP) -- Britain is in the grip of an influenza epidemic, the most
serious outbreak since 1989, health officials said Sunday.
</P>
<P>
	   The government's Chief Medical Officer, Dr. Liam Donaldson, said an
estimated 300 Britons in every 100,000 are now suffering from influenza.
</P>
<P>
	   The figure is double the official statistics -- 144 in 100,000 -- garnered
from recorded visits to general practitioners in the stretched National Health
Service.
</P>
<P>
	   Donaldson said many sufferers were treating themselves or calling health
service help lines set up to cut down doctor visits.
</P>
<P>
	   "There's a hidden element to this epidemic. We feel it's a lot higher and
climbing. We think we are in for the big one," Donaldson told London's Sunday
Telegraph.
</P>
<P>
	   There were no figures immediately available on deaths in the epidemic.
</P>
<P>
	   The Labor Party government maintained that seriously ill patients would be
hospitalized in intensive care units.
</P>
<P>
	   "The NHS is up against a very serious outbreak of flu indeed," Health
Secretary Alan Milburn said in a British Broadcasting Corp. television
interview. "There can hardly be a family in the land that hasn't been hit by
flu. They will also know it's a particularly nasty virus."
</P>
<P>
	   News reports said 26,000 people died in the 1989 epidemic, mostly elderly
victims.

<HEADLINE> Thatcher's Africa Trip Shows Tension  </HEADLINE>
   By ANDREW SELSKY Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   JOHANNESBURG, South Africa (AP) -- Former British Prime Minister Margaret
Thatcher visited a completely different South Africa on Sunday from the country
she saw nine years ago as the guest of apartheid President F.W. de Klerk.
</P>
<P>
	   In 1991, the African National Congress -- whose members were battling white
rule and whom Thatcher referred to as ``terrorists'' -- threatened to disrupt
her visit, held under tight security.
</P>
<P>
	   Since then, apartheid has been scrapped and the ANC now governs South Africa
after winning the first all-race elections in 1994.
</P>
<P>
	   In a visit to London in 1996, then President Nelson Mandela said he was
willing to overlook Thatcher's refusal to support sanctions against the
apartheid government. ``Let bygones be bygones,'' Mandela said.
</P>
<P>
	   But President Thabo Mbeki, who succeeded Mandela after elections last year
and was scheduled to meet privately with Thatcher on Sunday afternoon, might not
be so forgiving.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I don't think the president would say 'let bygones be bygones,' said
Tasneem Carrim, an official in Mbeki's office. ``But Mrs. Thatcher is not prime
minister anymore, and I don't think the president sees much harm in meeting with
her.''
</P>
<P>
	   The meeting at Mbeki's official residence in Pretoria was a private one and
closed to the media, said Carrim, who described the former prime minister's
visit as ``a courtesy call.''
</P>
<P>
	   Thatcher was also visiting her son Mark Thatcher, who settled in South
Africa more than three years ago after business troubles in the United States.

<TEXT>
<P>
   DILI, East Timor (AP) -- After three months of occupation by international
peacekeepers, East Timor now is relatively safe, the incoming leader of the U.N.
multinational force said Sunday.
</P>
<P>
	   Lt. Gen. Jaime S. de los Santos, who will take over peacekeeping operations
next month, said pro-Indonesian militias no longer pose a major security threat.
But he said he was confident his troops would be able to handle any problems in
the future.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The threat from the militias has been diminished,'' said de los Santos,
speaking on the last day of his three-day tour of the territory.
</P>
<P>
	   Australian-led international peacekeepers entered East Timor on Sept. 20
after a two-week rampage of killing, rape and destruction by pro-Indonesia
militias following an overwhelming vote for independence in a U.N.-sponsored
referendum.
</P>
<P>
	   The multinational troops secured East Timor within weeks, and there has been
little violence, except for a few minor firefights near the border with
Indonesian-controlled West Timor.
</P>
<P>
	   On Feb. 28, Maj. Gen. Peter Cosgrove will officially hand over command of
the military operations to de los Santos, a Philippine military officer.

   MARJAYOUN, Lebanon (AP) -- Guerrillas detonated a roadside bomb near an
Israeli military vehicle in southern Lebanon Sunday, injuring two people,
security officials said.
</P>
<P>
	   The bomb was detonated just north of the Israeli border and some 20 miles
south of the Lebanese town of Marjayoun, according to the officials, who spoke
on condition of anonymity.
</P>
<P>
	   The pro-Iranian Hezbollah group claimed responsibility for the attack.
</P>
<P>
	   In Jerusalem, an army spokesman said one soldier was slightly wounded when a
bomb was set off as an army truck outfitted with seats was passing near a
fortified Israeli position.
</P>
<P>
	   The Hezbollah guerrillas have for years fought a war of attrition to drive
out some 1,500 Israeli soldiers and 2,500 allied Lebanese militiamen from the
border strip. Israel has occupied the area since 1985 in an effort to prevent
cross-border guerrilla attacks on Israeli communities.

<HEADLINE> Basque Youths Clash With Cops  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   PAMPLONA, Spain (AP) -- A group of 150 young supporters of the Basque
separatist group ETA hurled rocks and Molotov cocktails at riot police early
Sunday in a clash that left three people slightly injured.
</P>
<P>
	   Twelve of the youths were arrested after the clash in a plaza in downtown
Pamplona, the Interior Ministry said.
</P>
<P>
	   Some of the demonstrators carried pro-ETA banners and chanted slogans in
favor of the group, and many of them wore hoods, ministry spokeswoman Paz D'Ors
said.
</P>
<P>
	   The violence started when a police patrol car answering a call found itself
surrounded by a crowd of youths who started kicking the vehicle and throwing
rocks and bottles at it.
</P>
<P>
	   The officers fled, and called in riot police who were attacked with rocks,
bottles and about 20 Molotov cocktails. Only six of the firebombs exploded,
D'Ors said.
</P>
<P>
	   Pamplona is the capital of the Navarra region, which borders the Basque
country and has a large Basque population. ETA wants to include Navarra in an
independent Basque nation it has been fighting to create since the late 1960s.
</P>
<P>
	   ETA's campaign of shootings and bombings has left nearly 800 people dead.
ETA declared a cease-fire in Sept. 1998 but called off the truce in December of
last year, saying it was frustrated with the pace of the peace process.
</P>
<P>
	   It has yet to break the cease-fire, although the government says security
forces thwarted a car-bomb attack last week in Bilbao and a truck-bombing in
Madrid before Christmas.

<HEADLINE> Cambodia Logging Probe Ordered  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHNOM PENH, Cambodia (AP) -- Cambodia's prime minister has ordered an
investigation into alleged involvement in illegal logging by a governor and the
army in a remote northeastern province.
</P>
<P>
	   Ty Sokun, director of the Forestry Department, confirmed Sunday that
investigators were trying to determine how many people were involved, up to the
level of the provincial governor, in the cutting and smuggling operations.
</P>
<P>
	   The order by Prime Minister Hun Sen follows a military report that there has
been a resurgence in illegal logging in Mondulkiri province despite the
government's recent campaign to preserve Cambodia's diminishing forests.
</P>
<P>
	   Hun Sen wrote in the margins of the report, obtained Sunday by The
Associated Press, that the investigation ``must dig into the roots, with no one
being spared with any mercy.''
</P>
<P>
	   ``They must be met with disciplinary measures, fired, demoted or sued in a
court of law,'' he wrote.
</P>
<P>
	   The report, prepared by a military task force that recently inspected a
logging area near Vietnam, said that about 380 truckloads of timber were
transported across the border in November and December.
</P>
<P>
	   New roads have been paved to allow access for logging equipment and for
newly cut trees to be exported, according to the report.
</P>
<P>
	   The report also accused the province's governor, Chhaom Bunkhan, police and
military police chiefs of ``conspiring with crooked businessmen'' to log the
area, rich in high quality wood.
</P>
<P>
	   Phone lines to Mondulkiri seldom work, and it was impossible to reach the
province's governor Sunday.
</P>
<P>
	   Cambodia's timber trade spun out of control in the early 1990s as corrupt
officials and the army facilitated exports of lumber.
</P>
<P>
	   A year after consolidating his power in 1998 elections, Hun Sen has begun a
crackdown on illegal logging that a British environmental group, Global Witness,
has called extremely effective.
</P>
<P>
	   The crackdown was strongly urged by international donors that contribute
nearly half of Cambodia's national budget.

<HEADLINE> 18 Babies Baptized by the Pope  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   VATICAN CITY (AP) -- Squalling, squirming, or sleeping serenely through the
fuss, 18 white-clad newborns were baptized Sunday at the hands of Pope John Paul
II in the newly restored Sistine Chapel.
</P>
<P>
	   Families from Europe and the Americas crowded into the brightly lighted
chapel for the mass baptism -- a traditional papal commemoration of Jesus'
baptism in the River Jordan.
</P>
<P>
	   Stooped over the baptismal font, the pope ladled water from a golden shell
over the heads of eight girls and 10 boys, some so bundled in lace and
petticoats as to be rigid in their parents' arms.
</P>
<P>
	   ``May these little ones grow in the faith that today receives them,'' John
Paul said. He urged the parents to provide good examples for their children.
</P>
<P>
	   The babies came from Spain, Brazil, the United States, Switzerland and
across Italy.
</P>
<P>
	   Big brothers and sisters accompanied the newborns to the font. Some stepped
forward, some shied away, when the 79-year-old pope -- always at his most
animated with children -- reached out to pat their heads or stroke their faces.
</P>
<P>
	   Strategically administered bottles kept most of the babies quiet as a choir
sang.
</P>
<P>
	   The ceremony took place before frescoes by Michelangelo, Botticelli and
others, gleaming after a newly completed decades-long restoration. ``Stupendous
masterpieces of art,'' the pope noted.

will have to resolve many more land disputes, like the one over Snir, as they
draw a new 47-mile border.
</P>
<P>
	   The conflicting claims, though rooted in history, are often based on
something as fleeting as the range of a rifle or the duration of a planting
season.
</P>
<P>
	   The ambiguities go back to the Mideast's colonial past when, after World War
I, Britain took control of Palestine and France ruled what is now Syria.
</P>
<P>
	   In 1922-23 border negotiations, Britain's main motive was to provide
sufficient water to Palestine. The new frontier gave French-ruled Syria the
Golan Heights, but kept it away from the Sea of Galilee and the Jordan River.
</P>
<P>
	   The 1923 border only held until the 1948 Mideast war, during which time
Syrian troops had seized 26 square miles in three areas west of the line from
Israel. In 1949, Israel and Syria agreed to demilitarize the three enclaves.
Sovereignty was to be determined in future peace talks.
</P>
<P>
	   Israel, however, quickly began asserting control over the disputed lands,
establishing four new communal farms and encouraging the cultivation of land. In
the demilitarized zone north of the Sea of Galilee, troops paved a patrol road
near the 1923 border, reinforcing it with a tall wall of eucalyptus trees that
provided cover from Syrian gunners.
</P>
<P>
	   In other areas, Syrians had the upper hand. El Hama, an Israeli enclave
along the Yarmouk River, quickly proved indefensible. In 1951, an Israeli hotel
at El Hama, today known as Hamat Gader, was taken over by Syrian troops who were
only forced out in the 1967 war when Israel captured the Golan in a six-day
blitz.
</P>
<P>
	   Until then, border skirmishes were frequent.
</P>
<P>
	   At Kibbutz Tel Katzir, perched on a hill in the southernmost of the disputed
zones, bunkers dug into the earth and waist-deep trenches with rusted machine
gun tripods still bear witness to the fighting.
</P>
<P>
	   Syrian gunners on the Golan cliffs would fire to chase away farmers who
worked the land below, under armed guard or riding in armored tractors.
</P>
<P>
	   Dvorah Ortenberg, 59, the community's historian, said asserting control of
the valley by cultivating the land was Tel Katzir's main mission.
</P>
<P>
	   She recalled a festive evening in 1963 when young and old planted olive
trees, a symbol of rootedness, to replace one-season crops such as wheat and
barley. The Israelis felt that allowing fields to lie fallow, even in between
seasons, was undercutting their control.
</P>
<P>
	   ``For two hours, we planted. For two hours, they (the Syrians) shelled us,''
said Ortenberg. The saplings never grew into trees because twice, Syrian
soldiers sneaked into the fields at night and uprooted them.
</P>
<P>
	   Syrian peace negotiators demand that Israel hand back every inch Syria
controlled on June 4, 1967, the eve of the war.
</P>
<P>
	   However, the lines are murky, especially in the old demilitarized zones,
said Amnon Kartin, a geographer at Tel Aviv University.
</P>
<P>
	   For example, before 1967, Syrian soldiers in the Golan would take potshots
at Israeli fishermen on the Sea of Galilee and deny them access to half the
eastern shore.
</P>
<P>
	   Syria now argues that by keeping the Israelis away, it controlled a large
part of the shore, starting north of the fishing village of Ein Gev, even though
its troops never left the Syrian side of the border which runs 11 yards uphill
from the waterline.
</P>
<P>
	   Anticipating Syrian demands to shift the new border closer to the shore,
Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak has said he will never give the Syrians access
to the lake.
</P>
<P>
	   Near Ein Gev, next to the lake road, a towering orange sign reminds Israelis
how close the Syrians once came to the Sea of Galilee, a drinking water source
so precious that a rise or fall in the lake level routinely makes headline news.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Here ran the border with Syria until June 5, 1967,'' reads the sign
flanked, for greater effect, by coils of barbed wire and an old ``Danger,
Mines'' sign.
</P>
<P>
	   If Israel agrees to withdraw to the 1923 border, more than half of the new
frontier would still remain in dispute, with Syria seeking some lands to the
west, though not all of the old demilitarized zones.
</P>
<P>
	   The vagueness of the June 4 line might turn out to be a blessing, said Ehud
Yaari, an Israeli commentator.
</P>
<P>
	   With Israel's acquiescence, Syria could claim it won back all the
Israeli-conquered lands, while in fact the two sides compromise on a variation
of the 1923 border.
</P>
<P>
	   Land swaps might help streamline the new frontier. For example, Israel might
trade El Hama for the Banias springs, an important water source.
</P>
<P>
	   Or the two sides might swap privately owned lands. A little over 5 percent
of the Golan have been owned by Jews since the 1920s, while Syrian citizens held
plots near the Sea of Galilee, Kartin said.
</P>
<P>
	   Talk about modifying the 1923 border only deepens anxiety in Snir, a kibbutz
established right after the 1967 war in the northernmost demilitarized zone.
</P>
<P>
	   Syrian troops controlled the land in the shadow of snowcapped Mount Hermon
before the war, though the community of 230 which raises cows for meat and
operates guest cottages is indisputably, if barely, located on the Israeli side
of the 1923 line.
</P>
<P>
	   Snir's chief administrator, Kochava Gerson, said kibbutz members have
already dug up old maps and hope to win reassurance soon from the government
that they will not be uprooted.
</P>
<P>
	   In the meantime, Gerson hopes Barak will stick to the key principle he has
said is guiding him in the negotiations -- never to go back to 1967 lines.

<HEADLINE> India-Pakistan Feud Affects Kashmir  </HEADLINE>
   By GREG MYRE Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   CHAKOTHI, Pakistan (AP) -- It's a typical winter's day amid the breathtaking
mountains of Kashmir: a hazy sun, cool air -- and a steady rain of artillery
shells from just across the frontier in India.
</P>
<P>
	   For decades, India and Pakistan have played out their ceaseless feud in the
peaks and valleys of this rugged Himalayan landscape. The inevitable victims are
the impoverished Kashmiris that both countries say they are trying to help.
</P>
<P>
	   The recent hijacking of an Indian Airlines plane was tied to the Kashmiri
dispute, and though it was settled after only one death, the two Asian rivals
have since escalated their propaganda war and stepped up the daily shelling
along the line that divides Kashmir.
</P>
<P>
	   On this day, dozens of Indian rounds crash down on the Pakistani side,
wounding five people. At least nine Pakistani civilians were killed and more
than 30 wounded last week. On the Indian side, 17 people died in a market
bombing blamed on Kashmiri militants seeking an end to Indian rule.
</P>
<P>
	   The week's casualty toll was higher than usual, but the steady, low-level
conflict has become utterly routine, even to those caught in the middle.
</P>
<P>
	   ``There is firing almost every day and night. But we are not going to be
chased away,'' said Bashir Ahmed, 43, a shopkeeper on the main drag in Chakothi,
a rundown village along the ``line of control'' that divides Indian and
Pakistani forces.
</P>
<P>
	   His almost casual defiance accents the routineness of the fight. A few days
earlier, Ahmed's sister-in-law Sakina Bibi, a mother of three, was killed when
shell fragments pierced her back as she walked along the dirt road that passes
his store.
</P>
<P>
	   Across the street, no more than 10 paces from his vegetable stand, is a pile
of rubble -- the remains of a dozen shops that were gutted by shelling and a
subsequent fire in 1998.
</P>
<P>
	   The heights on the Indian side of the line are a vivid golden brown in the
afternoon sun. More to the point, they offer an unobstructed firing line at
Ahmed's store and the rest of Chakothi. A sign at a Pakistani military
checkpoint features a skull and crossbones and orders drivers to turn off their
lights or risk winding up in the crosshairs of an Indian military spotter.
</P>
<P>
	   India and Pakistan have been at odds over Kashmir since both received
independence from Britain in 1947, and two of their three wars have been fought
over the mostly Muslim territory.
</P>
<P>
	   With support from Pakistan, Islamic militants on Kashmir's Indian side have
been fighting for a decade to break away from India. Last summer, militants
battled Indian soldiers for nearly two months in the Kargil sector before
retreating to the Pakistan side, where they maintain bases.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We will continue to intensify our jihad (holy war) against the Indians,''
said Abdullah Muntazir, spokesman for Lashkar-e-Tayyaba, one of the leading
Kashmiri militant groups based on the Pakistani side. ``We carried out several
successful operations during Ramadan (the just-ended Muslim holy month), and
plan to carry out more in the coming weeks.''
</P>
<P>
	   India and Pakistan both conducted underground test explosions of nuclear
weapons in 1998, raising the stakes should their conflict escalate into another
full-scale war.
</P>
<P>
	   In Muzzafarabad, capital of Pakistan's part of Kashmir, a model of a large
missile sits along the banks of the Jhelum River, its nose pointing toward
India. Down below, women wash red and green shawls in the river's fast-moving
waters -- a reminder of the region's poverty, made worse by the long conflict.
</P>
<P>
	   India and Pakistan both rank among the poorest nations on Earth, yet they
spend vast sums on military forces. Each claims all of Kashmir, and they are so
entrenched and have been so unwilling to compromise that it is almost impossible
to imagine them resolving the dispute.
</P>
<P>
	   The remote, mountainous terrain only adds to the high cost of waging the
conflict.
</P>
<P>
	   Both countries have hundreds of soldiers facing off on the Siachen Glacier,
an uninhabitable chunk of ice more than 15,000 feet high. The main enemy is not
the other side, however -- the bitter cold is the leading cause of casualties
for both forces.

<HEADLINE> House Panel Heads May Face Limits  </HEADLINE>
   By JIM ABRAMS Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Some big names in the House of Representatives could find
themselves shunted to the side next year.
</P>
<P>
	   While Republican enthusiasm for limiting how long someone can serve in
Congress has waned since the GOP took control in 1994, a six-year limit on the
terms of House committee chairmen is still very much alive.
</P>
<P>
	   Some influential lawmakers actually are looking forward to having a
back-seat perch from which they can watch, perhaps with amusement, the tussle
for who will succeed them.
</P>
<P>
	   Henry Hyde, the venerable House Judiciary Committee chairman who presided
over last year's impeachment hearings, says he will ``go quietly into the
night.''
</P>
<P>
	   ``I'll just be a backbencher and enjoy myself,'' the Illinois Republican
said. At the same time, he grouses that removing experienced lawmakers like him
from positions of power was an unwise ``form of gratifying the new members,
throwing them a bone.''
</P>
<P>
	   Others are dealing with it by just retiring.
</P>
<P>
	   ``It's a commitment they made, it's a commitment they've got to live by,''
said the House Education Committee chairman, Rep. William Goodling, R-Pa. He
will leave Congress after 26 years in the House.
</P>
<P>
	   Of course, the Republican chairmen of all 19 House committees plus scores of
GOP subcommittee chairmen could find themselves on the outs if Democrats pick up
a net six seats in November.
</P>
<P>
	   But even if Republicans maintain control of the House, power will be
shifting dramatically because of the term limits on committee chairmen.
</P>
<P>
	   Bud Shuster, who controls billions of dollars in highway money as head of
the House Transportation Committee, would have to accept a more modest role.
Rep. Floyd Spence, R-S.C., chairman of the House Armed Services Committee, could
see his sway over military policy diminished.
</P>
<P>
	   To keep his presence in the mix, Shuster, R-Pa., probably will move down a
notch to head the ground transportation subcommittee, according to his
spokesman, Scott Brenner.
</P>
<P>
	   Shuster ``thinks it should have been done in a staggered way'' so not all
the institutional experience was lost at once, Brenner added.
</P>
<P>
	   House Speaker Dennis Hastert, R-Ill., last spring decided that chairmen
could use their seniority to take over other committees. That means the House
Resources Committee chairman, GOP Rep. Don Young of Alaska, could succeed
Shuster on Transportation and the House Veterans Committee chairman, Republican
Rep. Bob Stump of Arizona, could move into Spence's Armed Services seat.
</P>
<P>
	   Paul Jacob, director of U.S. Term Limit, a private group behind the term
limit movement, said Hastert's ruling was a ``huge step backwards'' because it
is ``going to allow the same clique of committee chairmen to simply change their
committees.''
</P>
<P>
	   Some heated battles are expected.
</P>
<P>
	   Rep. Philip Crane, R-Ill., in line to succeed retiring Rep. Bill Archer,
R-Texas, as head of the tax-writing House Ways and Means Committee, is likely to
be challenged by Rep. Bill Thomas, R-Calif., now chairman of the House
Administration Committee.
</P>
<P>
	   Reps. Billy Tauzin, R-La., and Michael Oxley, R-Ohio, could be in a showdown
for the House Commerce Committee chairmanship vacated by Rep. Thomas Bliley,
R-Va.
</P>
<P>
	   ``There's a whole lot of competition going on. That's normal,'' said
Hastert's spokesman, John Feehery.
</P>
<P>
	   Attempts to rein in the seniority system that has given committee chairmen
such inordinate power go back before the Civil War, when southern Democrats in
the Senate used that power to defend slavery. Woodrow Wilson once said the
nation was ``a government by the chairmen of the standing committees of
Congress.''
</P>
<P>
	   In the 1950s and 1960s such entrenched southern Democrats as Howard Smith of
Virginia, chairman of the House Rules Committee from 1955-1967, effectively
stalled their own party's civil rights agenda.
</P>
<P>
	   Efforts were made in both parties to weaken the seniority system in the
post-Vietnam 1970s. They were pretty much fended off by veteran power brokers
like former Rep. Dan Rostenkowski, D-Ill., and Rep. John Dingell, D-Mich., the
respective heads of the House Ways and Means and Commerce committees from 1981
through 1994.
</P>
<P>
	   Goodling, the outgoing Education Committee chairman, said he supported
getting new blood in the leadership posts. But he questioned ``whether three
terms is enough to get one's feet wet.''
</P>
<P>
	   He added that he had to wait 20 years in the minority before finally getting
a shot at a chairmanship.
</P>
<P>
	   The chairman of the House Small Business Committee, Rep. James Talent, who
is stepping down next year to run for governor of Missouri, said he, too,
supported the idea of term limits but suggested that party leaders should be
able to grant waivers so some chairman could stay on.

<HEADLINE> Post Office Readies Rate Increase  </HEADLINE>
   By RANDOLPH E. SCHMID Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Postal Service is getting ready to kick off the
complex process of raising rates, a step that could mean higher stamp prices
early next year.
</P>
<P>
	   Major mailers have been on edge in recent months, anticipating the action
many expect to be announced Tuesday at the monthly meeting of the Postal
Service's board of governors.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I think it's about 95 percent likely that the governors will approve a
filing,'' said Neal Denton of the Alliance of Nonprofit Mailers.
</P>
<P>
	   ``They're going to do it,'' agreed Gene Del Polito, president of the
American Association for Postal Commerce, formerly the Advertising Mail
Marketing Association.
</P>
<P>
	   Officials of the Mailers Council and Direct Marketing Association also said
they expected action soon.
</P>
<P>
	   Postal officials were not discussing how much of an increase would be sought
-- or even if a request would be filed -- stressing that the decision is up to
the governing board.
</P>
<P>
	   Two of the post office's main competitors -- Federal Express and United
Parcel Service -- recently announced rate increases to take effect in February,
citing rising costs.
</P>
<P>
	   Just last month, postal officials declared their rates would not be raised
in 2000, noting the $363 million profit for fiscal 1999.
</P>
<P>
	   Starting the complex process of raising rates now is not likely to break
that promise.
</P>
<P>
	   When the post office wants to raise prices, it has to seek permission from
the independent Postal Rate Commission and provide detailed supporting
documents. The commission then holds hearings and issues its decision; the
process takes 10 months.
</P>
<P>
	   Assuming commission approval, the matter would go before the postal
governors in November or December. They traditionally have been reluctant to
impose higher rates before the Christmas mailing rush, so any rate rise is
unlikely before early 2001.
</P>
<P>
	   The current 33-cent First Class rate took effect Jan. 10, 1999, a 1-cent
increase. Speculation in the mailing industry has focused on a probable First
Class increase of 1- or 2-cents this time.
</P>
<P>
	   Postmaster General William Henderson recently told The Denver Post he would
not recommend a rate increase larger than inflation, which would suggest a
1-cent boost.
</P>
<P>
	   The Postal Service is a semi-independent federal agency. It does not receive
tax money for operations and is expected to make enough money to break even over
time. The agency still carries a $3.5 billion accumulated deficit, built up over
many years of operating in the red.
</P>
<P>
	   While the First Class rate for cards and letters is the most visible change
for the public, rates also would rise for most other types of mail. ``One of the
things a rate case is, is civil war,'' Denton said of the hearing process before
the Postal Rate Commission. ``With each different mailing interest trying to
carve up the pie as to who should pay what in increased rates.''
</P>
<P>
	   Denton said he especially was concerned about the impact on small,
community-based nonprofit organizations that need low rates to raise funds for
their activities. He speculated that increases for some small nonprofits could
reach 15 percent.
</P>
<P>
	   Del Polito said it is his ``expectation that flat size mail is probably
going to come in for a disproportionately larger increase, which means
publications are going to be hurting.''
</P>
<P>
	   ``This is not a very propitious time for an increase,'' Del Polito said,
citing the growth in on-line selling and development of the Internet, offering
alternatives to the Postal Service.
</P>
<P>
	   While the post office managed a $363 million profit in fiscal 1999, that was
the lowest in five years and the agency, like its competitors, also faces rising
fuel prices and wages.

<HEADLINE> Conservationists Cheer Dam Removal  </HEADLINE>
   By GLENN ADAMS Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   AUGUSTA, Maine (AP) -- Conservationists who cheered the removal of a
162-year-old dam in Maine's capital last year also welcomed the replacement of a
dam on a backwoods river that was only slightly younger.
</P>
<P>
	   Removal of the Edwards Dam, which stretched 917 feet across the Kennebec
River, completed the rebirth of a historically rich fishery. The dam, 40 miles
upstream from the Atlantic Ocean, was the first hydroelectric dam in the country
ordered removed by the U.S. government for protection of the environment.
</P>
<P>
	   Replacement of the Churchill Dam was seen by conservationists and outdoors
enthusiasts as essential to the enjoyment of wilderness.
</P>
<P>
	   At a rededication ceremony in September, state Conservation Commissioner Ron
Lovaglio called the Churchill Dam ``the dam for the new millennium'' that would
preserve Maine's prized Allagash Wilderness Waterway forever.
</P>
<P>
	   State Rep. John Martin, who has made trips down the river nearly every year
since he was a boy, summed it up in a different way.
</P>
<P>
	   Without the dam, ``people would not be able to enjoy the river in the
summer,'' said Martin, who made five Allagash trips last year alone.
</P>
<P>
	   While the Edwards Dam was built in 1837 to supply downtown Augusta's mills
with power, Churchill, in the northeastern corner of Piscataquis County in the
heart of the Allagash, started off with a different purpose.
</P>
<P>
	   First known as Heron Lake Dam when it rose in 1846, it controlled water
flows to help loggers float their wood to mills to the south rather than to
Canada. Over the years, the local ecosystem adjusted to the changes created by
the dam, said Dave Hubley of the Allagash Alliance, a group of about 200 members
that pushed for the new dam.
</P>
<P>
	   The old Churchill was replaced in 1925, but the new dam was washed out by
spring ice in 1954. A stone-and-cribwork structure was built in 1968, but it was
only designed to last 20 years at most. Logging-truck traffic over the structure
weakened the dam, causing it to sag and deteriorate.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The settling was happening so fast that it was difficult and in some cases
impossible to open the gates,'' said Herb Hartman of the state Bureau of Parks
and Lands.
</P>
<P>
	   Had a forest fire broken out, it would have been risky to move bulldozers
and firefighting equipment over the dam, Hartman said. Without a plan for
repairs, the old dam would have had to be breached.
</P>
<P>
	   Gone would be a dam that slowed down the spring rush downstream but kept the
water moving in the summer, while creating wetlands, preserving a habitat for
fish like trout and keeping Churchill and Eagle lakes full.
</P>
<P>
	   Without it, you couldn't float a canoe downstream to where the Allagash
meets the St. John River in the summer.
</P>
<P>
	   Rather than being seen as an impediment, Churchill Dam, about 120 miles
north of Bangor, was viewed as a key to maintaining the water levels and ecology
of one of Maine's most important recreational regions.
</P>
<P>
	   Still, voters were not convinced that the dam needed to be repaired and
rejected bond issues to replace the dam in 1987 and 1990.
</P>
<P>
	   By the time the issue went before voters again in 1996, hunters and sport
fishermen, environmentalists and contractors rallied with the Allagash Alliance
behind a $3 million bond issue that included $1.4 million for the Churchill Dam.
</P>
<P>
	   Voters said yes.
</P>
<P>
	   Work began in 1997 and the old cribwork was replaced with a concrete
structure designed to last a century. The 87-foot-long, 27-foot-wide dam, which
includes six gates and a fishway, was essentially completed in 1998. It features
a boat launch at the side.
</P>
<P>
	   The alliance's Hubley said the new dam keeps a pledge the state made when
the Allagash Wilderness Waterway was established in 1966.
</P>
<P>
	   ``When you make a deal like that with the people, you have to keep your end
of the deal,'' said Hubley.
</P>
<P>
	   But some of the river's users, and the Allagash Alliance itself, are not
completely happy.
</P>
<P>
	   A motor vehicle access point was included in a management plan for the
waterway. It is located in the narrows between Churchill and Eagle lakes,
between two existing access points at Churchill Dam and Indian Stream.
</P>
<P>
	   The access area, Hubley said, will draw too many cars, trailers and people,
and threatens the waterway's wilderness nature.
</P>
<P>
	   Hubley said his group might have taken a different stance on the Churchill
Dam project had he known the access area was coming.
</P>
<P>
	   Rick Denico, an angler who has been using the Allagash for 50 years, says
the put-in point was there long ago and ought to be restored.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I think the place is for all of us up there. I think fishermen ought to
have just as much right to the waterway as canoeists,'' said Denico, a retired
chemical engineer.

<P>
	   Henry David Thoreau was an early visitor to the Allagash area, which became
a busy transportation corridor for loggers before it was preserved for
recreation.
</P>
<P>
	   The 92-mile Allagash Wilderness Waterway extends from Telos Lake in the
south to West Twin Brook, just south of the St. John River, in the north. The
full trip takes seven to 10 days by canoe, but shorter trips can be taken.
Ice-out is in mid-May and black flies hang around usually until July.
</P>
<P>
	   Besides canoeing and camping, there are hiking trails and fire towers.
Campsites are open for winter use. A snowmobile trail provides access to
Chamberlain Lake.
</P>
<P>
	   Access is by private roads from Maine and Quebec, used primarily by logging
trucks which have the right of way. All waterway users entering on private roads
must register at checkpoints or with a ranger. Groups are limited to 12 people.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Hope Offered Against Hysterectomy  </HEADLINE>
    By LEANNE ITALIE Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   NEW YORK (AP) -- Arleen Chatman's mother had a hysterectomy. Her grandmother
had a hysterectomy. So did her sister, two aunts and a cousin, who was only 32
when the family problem -- uterine fibroids -- struck her as they do millions of
women every year.
</P>
<P>
	   Chatman, 57, was determined to buck her history, fight through her
fibroid-related pain and find a way to avoid a hysterectomy, despite five
miscarriages and periods so heavy she used a box of sanitary napkins combined
with tampons in a single day.
</P>
<P>
	   "I got very anemic and was missing work," said the elementary school
librarian in Los Angeles. "I grew up in the old school of 'It's just a woman's
curse and you have to put up with it.' Then I started reading and everybody was
talking about hysterectomies being done that weren't needed, saying there should
be alternatives."
</P>
<P>
	   The alternative Chatman chose three years ago is a relatively new treatment
that allows women to avoid the risks and lengthy recovery periods of surgery.
It's called uterine artery embolization, and it's done by interventional
radiologists -- not gynecologists.
</P>
<P>
	   Under local anesthesia accompanied by pain medication, a quarter-inch
incision is made in the groin. A catheter the circumference of spaghetti is
threaded into the two arteries that supply blood to the uterus and feed
blood-dependent fibroids.
</P>
<P>
	   Guided by bursts of die projected by X-ray imaging, plastic particles the
size of sand granules are injected into the vessels, blocking blood to the
tumors while allowing the uterus to receive nourishment from other sources.
</P>
<P>
	   Fibroids slowly deteriorate over three months to a year after embolization,
offering women an average 40 percent to 60 percent reduction that appears to be
permanent, said Dr. Robert Worthington-Kirsch, a Philadelphia radiologist who
has performed a little more than 600 uterine artery embolizations, the most in
the United States. The procedure usually takes care of multiple fibroids, not
just the prominent ones -- unlike surgery.
</P>
<P>
	   About 4,500 women have undergone the procedure in the United States, and
6,000 to 8,000 worldwide. The procedure is successful in easing symptoms in
about 90 percent of cases, Worthington-Kirsch said.
</P>
<P>
	   Recipients are screened by gynecologists prior to embolization to rule out
uterine cancer, detect infections that could lead to complications and determine
whether other problems such as endometriosis are severe enough to lead to
hysterectomy anyway.
</P>
<P>
	   Most women spend a night or less in a hospital and resume their lives within
a few days, compared to weeks of recovery after surgery. The downside is painful
cramps that hit some women for a day or two after the embolization. And much
more study is needed to gauge long-term effects of the procedure on fertility,
among other factors.
</P>
<P>
	   "I was on my feet in a day and I haven't had any problems since. My fibroids
almost disappeared," said Chatman, the mother of two grown sons who was among
the first patients in the United States, at the University of California Medical
Center in Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
	   Around the country, about 500 radiologists perform uterine artery
embolization. They're seeing many women seeking treatment for fibroids that grew
back after myomectomy, a surgery to remove the tumors while leaving the uterus,
Worthington-Kirsch said.
</P>
<P>
	   Twenty percent to 40 percent of American women over 35 have fibroids, which
lead to at least 33 percent of the 670,000 hysterectomies performed every year
in this country, he said.
</P>
<P>
	   Fibroids grow from cells of the uterine muscle. They can go undetected at
the size of a pea for years or grow rapidly to the size of a bowling ball,
multiplying as time passes. They often enlarge the uterus, making women appear
pregnant when they aren't and contributing to premature labor when they are.
</P>
<P>
	   The growths appear to be driven by estrogen. Because a woman's estrogen
levels usually drop with menopause, doctors often advocate a wait-and-see
approach to fibroids absent serious symptoms. Like Chatman, many women who seek
the procedure are beyond their childbearing years.
</P>
<P>
	   Thousands of women have fibroids with no symptoms. A big problem among the
thousands more who are not that lucky are extremely heavy and painful periods
lasting up to several weeks, sapping them of iron and leaving them severely
anemic.
</P>
<P>
	   Some experience constipation from bowel compression and the constant need to
urinate due to fibroids pressing on the bladder and other abdominal organs.
</P>
<P>
	   "Month by month I just got better and better and better," said Leslie Miles,
another embolization patient who traveled to Los Angeles from her home in Hawaii
to have the procedure nearly 2 1/2 years ago and got pregnant soon after. "It's
a fantastic alternative to hysterectomy. I felt so much better, so much
healthier. So many people are told, that's all you can get, hysterectomy, take
it out."
</P>
<P>
	   A French gynecologist, Dr. Jacques Henri Ravina, and some colleagues
stumbled on the procedure as a promising fibroid treatment about 10 years ago.
</P>
<P>
	   Embolization to stop life-threatening bleeding after childbirth or surgery
has been done for more than 20 years, but Ravina noticed that women who were
embolized as a precaution against heavy bleeding prior to hysterectomy and
myomectomy experienced a shrinkage in their fibroids, eliminating the need for
surgery.
</P>
<P>
	   Worthington-Kirsch said many gynecologists know little or nothing about
embolization as a fibroid treatment and don't inform patients of it because they
consider it "experimental." Many insurance companies don't pay for the procedure
as a fibroid treatment for the same reason.
</P>
<P>
	   Women seeking alternatives to surgery and treatments that usually provide
only short-term relief through scraping, burning or freezing of fibroids are
taking to the Internet to share information about embolization after receiving
none from their gynecologists, forming support groups and networks with
radiologists.
</P>
<P>
	   The skepticism among gynecologists "is understandable," Worthington-Kirsch
said.
</P>
<P>
	   "About 40 percent of the income of a gynecologist comes from fibroid
surgery," he said. "There's also ignorance, a natural conservatism and a
significant fear of losing control, having the patient go somewhere and never
come back."
</P>
<P>
	   Dr. Bruce McLucas, one of the UCLA gynecologists involved in the pioneering
fibroid embolization program there, said a little skepticism about new
techniques is healthy. But he stressed that embolization for other problems has
been around for more than 20 years.
</P>
<P>
	   "We have to be able to educate other gynecologists. Embolization is not
experimental. Everyone involved in this phenomenon is saying it works."
</P>
<P>
	   ------
</P>
<P>
	   Some terms and explanations:
</P>
<P>
	   Fibroid, a usually benign tumor of the uterus formed from cells of the
uterine muscle. Little is known about the cause of fibroids, believed to be
estrogen-dependent. They can take many years to grow and may disappear with
menopause, when natural estrogen levels drop. Fibroids can cause debilitating
symptoms, including heavy bleeding and painful cramps, or remain asymptomatic.
</P>
<P>
	   ------
</P>
<P>
	   Uterine artery embolization, the blocking of vessels supplying blood to
uterine fibroids, using a catheter inserted in the groin and X-ray imaging. The
procedure appears to offer a permanent solution to fibroids, eliminates the need
for general anesthesia and shortens recovery time when compared to surgery.
</P>
<P>
	   ------
</P>
<P>
	   Hysterectomy, the surgical removal of the uterus, sometimes including the
cervix and ovaries. Twenty percent to 40 percent of American women over 35 have
fibroids, which lead to at least 33 percent of the 670,000 hysterectomies
performed every year in the United States.
</P>
<P>
	   ------
</P>
<P>
	   Myomectomy, the surgical removal of fibroids, leaving the uterus intact.
Myomectomy has a high rate of return growth and may cause problematic adhesions,
prompting the need for additional surgery.

<HEADLINE> Mental Illness Drives Bodybuilders?  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
    WASHINGTON (AP) -- What drives some bodybuilders is a form of mental illness
that can be treated with drugs, a researcher says.
</P>
<P>
	   These people have a type of body dysmorphic disorder, a condition which is
characterized by a preoccupation with an imagined or slight defect in
appearance, said Dr. Eric Hollander of Mount Sinai School of Medicine in New
York.
</P>
<P>
	   "Body dysmorphic disorder affects probably 1 to 2 percent of the U.S.
population, but among men in particular there is a sort of subclassification
called 'bigorexia,' which is sort of the opposite of anorexia," Hollander said.
Anorexics think they are too fat, no matter how thin they are -- and bigorexics
think themselves too small, no matter how big they are, he said.
</P>
<P>
	   Bigorexia, more properly termed muscle dysmorphia, is not yet formally
recognized as a psychiatric condition, Hollander said. But the coming revision
of the American Psychiatric Association's Diagnostic and Statistical Manual will
describe the condition, he said.
</P>
<P>
	   Bodybuilding can be a healthy competition, but these people take muscle
development to the point at which it interferes with ordinary living, including
holding a job or staying healthy, Hollander said. "They will continue to
exercise even after they have dislocated a shoulder," he said.
</P>
<P>
	   As an expression of body dysmorphic disorder, muscle dysmorphia is an
obsessive-compulsive spectrum disorder, Hollander said. People with OCD are
driven to do things such as repeatedly check their appearance in mirrors and
perform ritualistic movements.
</P>
<P>
	   "An exaggerated sense that something doesn't look right" seems to have
origins in brain chemistry, Hollander said. He and his colleagues reported in
Archives of General Psychiatry on the effects of the drug clomipramine on the
brain chemical serotonin.
</P>
<P>
	   One of serotonin's normal roles seems to be in turning off brain processes
that signal when "things don't fit our conceived notions," Hollander said. If
serotonin levels are abnormally low, however, it can't turn off the mental alarm
bell that rings when things don't seem right, and the bell keeps on ringing even
when things are right, he said. Clomipramine helps the brain raise serotonin
levels by interfering with the body's ability to destroy the chemical, he said.
</P>
<P>
	   Hollander and his colleagues wanted to be sure clomipramine was producing
improvements in the behavior of people with body dysmorphic disorder, and that
the patients were not improving simply because they knew they were getting
treatment and therefore expected themselves to improve. So the researchers
compared clomipramine with another drug, desipramine, which had similar side
effects but does not affect serotonin.
</P>
<P>
	   Clomipramine treatment was significantly better in reducing patients'
repetitive movements and obsessive preoccupation with perceived flaws, the study
found. But it is not a cure, Hollander said. "Don't think about symptoms going
down to zero," he said. "They were 25 to 35 percent improved." There was,
however, a significant improvement in their ability to go back to school or
function at work, and a significant drop in their thoughts of suicide, he said.
</P>
<P>
	   Although this study did not focus on muscle dysmorphia, treatment for body
dysmorphia has been shown to work on muscle dysmorphia, Hollander said. And a
clinician who was not involved in the study said she found the drug to work,
especially in combination with psychological therapy.
</P>
<P>
	   "I don't feel behavior therapy is sufficient, and certainly medications are
not efficacious alone either," said Fugen Neziroglu, senior clinical director of
the Bio-Behavioral Institute in Great Neck, N.Y.
</P>
<P>
	   Neziroglu has treated a number of people with muscle dysmorphia. "I had one
who just left, an attractive, nice, 44-year-old man, he's telling me he has flab
on his sides," she said. "You look at him and you know he has no flab."
</P>
<P>
	   Medications help to stabilize patients with muscle dysmorphia, but therapy
is needed to retrain habits and thought patterns needed to make the improvements
last, Neziroglu said. Clomipramine is one of the better drugs, she said.
</P>
<P>
	   And therapy alone may be adequate treatment, said James Rosen, a clinical
psychologist and professor at the University of Vermont. The
cognitive-behavioral approach teaches patients to realize when their thoughts
are unrealistic, recast their self-image into more neutral terms, and adapt to
situations that could set off the compulsion, he said.
</P>
<P>
	   For muscle dysmorphia, this could include easing away from the idea that the
exercisers would lose control of themselves if they skip a workout, Rosen said.
</P>
<P>
	   However, one bodybuilding promoter said he couldn't tell whether
bodybuilders have this condition. High-level bodybuilders are like other
athletes in paying extremely close attention to what they eat, how much they
exercise and where they fall short of their own goals, said James Lorimer of the
Arnold Schwarzenegger Fitness Weekend, Feb. 22-27 in Columbus, Ohio.
</P>
<P>
	   "I can't say I place these particular athletes outside the normal range of
people who are trying to be the best they can be in whatever sport they are in,"
Lorimer said. "You can say it's excessive, it's unusual, but (I) can't say
whether it is disordered or not."

<HEADLINE> Police Seek Night-Vision Goggles  </HEADLINE>
   By JAMES HANNAH Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   DAYTON, Ohio (AP) -- A missing child and escaped killers from a prison
breakout are believed to be hiding after dark in the same backwoods area. Swarms
of rescuers and police officers converge and search with night-vision goggles.
</P>
<P>
	   What's wrong with this picture?
</P>
<P>
	   Unlike the American military, many police, park rangers and rescue squads
that would like to have night-vision goggles can't afford them.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Super expensive,'' said Montgomery County Sheriff Gary Haines.
</P>
<P>
	   The sheriff's office gets by with a couple of older night-vision binoculars
for the SWAT team and night surveillance.
</P>
<P>
	   ``They're unbelievable. They're definitely a help,'' said Maj. Ron Casey.
But he said the department doesn't have the money for more night-vision
equipment it wants, especially the latest high-quality goggles.
</P>
<P>
	   Teams formed by the Ohio Department of Rehabilitation and Correction to
respond to prison disturbances have trained with night-vision goggles, but the
agency doesn't own any.
</P>
<P>
	   ``It's kind of on their wish list,'' said department spokesman Joe Andrews.
</P>
<P>
	   Members of the Miami Valley Urban Search and Rescue Task Force also have
trained with borrowed night-vision goggles.
</P>
<P>
	   ``They're impressive,'' said spokesman Scott Hall. He said the military
probably would lend the rescue squad goggles in an emergency, but it could not
afford to buy them.
</P>
<P>
	   ``It's very expensive technology,'' Hall said. ``There are a whole lot of
other trinkets that can be bought before that.''
</P>
<P>
	   Specialized Technical Services of suburban Beavercreek sells its latest
goggles to the military for $12,000 to $14,000 apiece. Company chairman Robert
Lupini says he expects the cost to drop by as much as 30 percent with increased
sales and production.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Even on a starlit night when it's really black out there for our own eyes,
there's always a little light,'' said Lupini. ``This device amplifies that light
about 50,000 times.''
</P>
<P>
	   The battery-powered goggles also detect heat, enabling users to better spot
enemy troops or someone lost in the woods at night. And the goggles have
infrared technology so they can be used where there is no light, such as in
caves.
</P>
<P>
	   Designed for aggressive movements, the goggles are smaller than conventional
equipment and can be attached to helmets. The optics, encased in hard plastic,
are made to withstand pressures at 50 feet under the sea and altitudes of 50,000
feet.
</P>
<P>
	   Rep. David Hobson, who sits on the House Appropriations military
construction subcommittee, is impressed with the equipment. He said the goggles
would be invaluable to paratroopers and pilots who must make night landings.
</P>
<P>
	   ``This type of thing saves lives and helps people accomplish their mission
successfully,'' said the Ohio Republican. ``Going into any kind of conflict, a
war fighter will tell you he always wants to be one up on his opponent. This
helps him be one-up in adverse conditions.''
</P>
<P>
	   Lt. Col. Joseph Celeski, a student at the U.S. Army War College in Carlisle,
Pa., has used night-vision goggles for many years, first as a tank operator and
later as a member of special forces.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The purpose of all of this is to see at night. It's that simple,'' he
said. ``It gives you a tactical overmatch at the point it's being used.''
</P>
<P>
	   While the United States may have once held the edge when it comes to seeing
at night, potential adversaries now have their own night-vision goggles.
However, Celeski said he believes the goggles used by U.S. forces offer sharper
vision and better depth perception.
</P>
<P>
	   Researchers at Wright-Patterson Air Force Base are testing ``panoramic''
night-vision goggles that more than double the field of vision available from
conventional goggles.
</P>
<P>
	   Lee Task, of the Air Force Research Lab, said older night-vision goggles
have their drawbacks.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Try driving your car by looking through a couple of toilet-paper tubes,''
said Task.
</P>
<P>
	   He said the new goggles enable users to see more without having to move
their head. However, the panorama goggles are not expected to be fully
operational for several years.
</P>
<P>
	   Lupini said night-vision goggles could help SWAT teams, fire departments,
park rangers, crews that repair downed power lines at night and even night
fishermen.
</P>
<P>
	   Lupini said he once lent a pair to a Kentucky game warden.
</P>
<P>
	   ``He chased down a poacher,'' said Lupini. ``The guy ran out into the woods,
and he just followed him with the goggles.''

<HEADLINE> Thorough Korea War Probe Cited  </HEADLINE>
   By SANG-HUN CHOE Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   SEOUL, South Korea (AP) -- The United States will not investigate ``every
firefight, every battle'' of the 1950-53 Korean War, despite allegations that
U.S. forces killed unarmed civilians in dozens of incidents, the head of the
U.S. Army said Sunday.
</P>
<P>
	   U.S. investigators are already devoting extraordinary resources to the
allegations of a mass killing of several hundred refugees by U.S. soldiers at No
Gun Ri, South Korea, in the early weeks of the conflict, Army Secretary Louis
Caldera said.
</P>
<P>
	   Since those allegations became public, South Koreans have come forward with
more stories of alleged mass killings of civilians by U.S. troops.
</P>
<P>
	   In an interview with The Associated Press, Caldera said it is not possible
to investigate every incident of the war in detail. He said all loss of life was
regrettable, but emphasized the need to establish whether civilians were killed
intentionally.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The question is not one of going back to try to identify every incident in
which someone claims there was a lost of innocent lives,'' he said. ``If you
begin down that path, you'll never end because all war by definition is
extremely violent.''
</P>
<P>
	   ``It is not possible to go back and investigate every firefight, every
battle, that occurred during the three years of the Korean War,'' Caldera said,
citing the cruel and chaotic nature of war.
</P>
<P>
	   The United States and South Korea began investigating what happened at No
Gun Ri after The Associated Press reported on the incident in September, citing
South Korean victims, American war veterans and U.S. government archives.
</P>
<P>
	   Since then, 37 other cases of alleged killings have surfaced. Some South
Koreans have said U.S. jets strafed war refugees flooding South Korea's roads in
1950-51, and there are demands for compensation.
</P>
<P>
	   Caldera arrived in Seoul on Sunday with a delegation of 18 Army
investigators and civilian advisers. He said his team was making ``very good
progress'' in reviewing U.S. government archives, but he said they had not found
anything ``conclusive.''
</P>
<P>
	   He said the compensation issue will be assessed once the investigation is
complete.
</P>
<P>
	   In the AP report, witnesses said a U.S. Army unit killed a large number of
civilians in and near a No Gun Ri railroad bridge in late July 1950 as
retreating Americans struggled to defend South Korea against a communist North
Korean invasion.
</P>
<P>
	   According to declassified documents, U.S. commanders ordered some units to
attack people in civilian garb out of fear that enemy soldiers were infiltrating
South Korean refugee columns. Military law experts say such orders were illegal.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We are also going to show the context in which many of those orders were
given,'' Caldera said. He said the U.S. ground commanders had cleared the areas
around No Gun Ri of refugees and they regarded people located in those areas as
combatants.
</P>
<P>
	   But Koreans victims say U.S. troops guided them out of their village and led
them to No Gun Ri. Then U.S. planes strafed them and American ground troops
machine-gunned people trapped in a railroad underpass for three days, they say.
</P>
<P>
	   U.S. investigators have started interviewing Korean War veterans, Caldera
said. His group planned to confer with South Korean government officials and
visit No Gun Ri to meet 12 Korean victims Monday.
</P>
<P>
	   Investigators do not view No Gun Ri as a criminal investigation, but they
would advise ex-soldiers of their rights if they make testimony that could put
them in criminal jeopardy, Caldera said. He did not comment on whether veterans
could be prosecuted.
</P>
<P>
	   South Korea hopes to wrap up the investigation by May, but Caldera said he
was uncertain that deadline could be met.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We need to take the time that it will take to do a very thorough review to
determine what happened,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> Israeli-Syrian Talks Near an End  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   SHEPHERDSTOWN, W.Va. (AP) -- With President Clinton due to resume his
mediation late Sunday, the inconclusive round of peacemaking between Israel and
Syria appeared to be nearing a close.
</P>
<P>
	   Diplomatic sources told The Associated Press that Israeli Prime Minister
Ehud Barak tentatively planned to leave the land-for-peace negotiations Monday
evening and that Syrian Foreign Minister Farouk al-Sharaa was likely to depart
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
	   They could leave behind experts to continue deliberations over a projected
Israeli pullback on the Golan Heights and a peace offer from Syria.
</P>
<P>
	   Clinton planned to return to Shepherdstown late Sunday afternoon, said a
White House official in Washington, adding: ``He's going for meetings. The
process continues.''
</P>
<P>
	   Earlier Sunday, Secretary of State Madeleine Albright escorted Barak on a
tour of the Antietam National Battlefield, a Civil War site in Sharpsburg, Md.
</P>
<P>
	   Barak, a former military chief of staff, already has pledged to seek peace
with Syria as an alternative to conflict in the Middle East. But the symbolism
of a battlefield where casualties were high was at least beneath the surface.
</P>
<P>
	   More men were killed or wounded on Sept. 17, 1862, than in any other
single-day battle during the war -- the combined casualties were over 23,000.
The site marks the end of General Robert E. Lee's first invasion of the North
and led President Lincoln to issue the Emancipation Proclamation.
</P>
<P>
	   On Saturday, Albright took al-Sharaa to Harpers Ferry, W.Va., where John
Brown led an unsuccessful insurrection of slaves before the Civil War.
</P>
<P>
	   Albright also was the host of a tea for the Syrian minister at her home
across the border in Virginia.
</P>
<P>
	   Week-long negotiations between Israel and Syria, under close U.S.
supervision, are inconclusive. The aim is a treaty based on Israel withdrawing
on the Golan Heights border enclave for diplomatic recognition from its Arab
neighbor.
</P>
<P>
	   While Israeli and Syrian officials here are bound by a U.S. gag order, there
were conflicting assessments back home.
</P>
<P>
	   In Jerusalem, Israeli Cabinet Minister Haim Ramon said he spoke to Barak
late Saturday and reported that while Syria had refused to permit Israel to
retain an early warning station in the Golan Heights after a pullback, Syria was
prepared to consider a warning station manned mainly by American and French
personnel, with a Syrian presence and a symbolic Israeli presence.
</P>
<P>
	   Ramon did not rule out this arrangement. ``We are demanding .... that Israel
have significant access to the intelligence that it (the warning station)
gathers,'' he told Israel army radio. Ramon did not specify how that access
should be ensured.
</P>
<P>
	   In Syria, the state-run Al-Thawra newspaper warned Sunday that the peace
talks were in serious danger.
</P>
<P>
	   ``It is clear that there are Israeli directives to ... break up the talks in
an attempt to add hurdles and hamper them to leave the political process
spinning in place,'' the newspaper said in an editorial.

<HEADLINE> Religious Vigilantes Nabbed in Iraq  </HEADLINE>
   By WAIEL FALEH Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) -- Police in Iraq have arrested a group of religious
vigilantes who allegedly stalked and killed 19 men who were with their
girlfriends at a tree-lined esplanade frequented by lovers, a magazine reported.
</P>
<P>
	   The killings started in October when a college student was slain as he
chatted with his girlfriend, the Ishtar monthly magazine reported. It said the
killers approached the victim and fired one bullet in his head. The woman was
not harmed.
</P>
<P>
	   Police did not publicize the killing, and other lovers continued to visit
the promenade along the Tigris River in northern Baghdad. At least 18 more men
were killed in a similar fashion before police launched an undercover operation.
</P>
<P>
	   The killers apparently saw themselves as Islamic vigilantes offended by the
lovers' actions, the magazine reported. Conservative Muslims say Islam does not
allow premarital association between men and women.
</P>
<P>
	   One police officer, speaking on condition of anonymity, said four men had
been arrested. But police would not give any other details.
</P>
<P>
	   In its recent report, Ishtar said the men were caught by two undercover
policemen, one dressed in women's clothes and the other dressed in plain
clothes. Both officers were heavily armed and pounced on the men before they
could act, Ishtar said.
</P>
<P>
	   Another police officer, Maj. Adnan Auda, worked the case earlier and walked
on the promenade several times with a girl as part of the undercover operation.
</P>
<P>
	   During one such operation, Auda was overpowered by two men who held him at
gunpoint. However, they let him go after a warning.
</P>
<P>
	   Ishtar said despite the arrests, lovers have been hesitant to return to the
promenade.

<HEADLINE> Candidates Thoughts on Missiles  </HEADLINE>
   By The Associated Press
<TEXT>
<P>
	   Three days a week, The Associated Press asks the major presidential
candidates a question on the issues. Today's question and the responses:
</P>
<P>
	   Missile Defense
</P>
<P>
	   Does America need a national missile defense system to defend itself against
nuclear attack?
</P>
<P>
	   Democrats:
</P>
<P>
	   Bill Bradley: ``A national missile defense system has not been adequately
tested, so it's too soon to say that it is an effective way to defend America
against nuclear attack. Even if it is shown to be both technically feasible and
strategically desirable, a NMD cannot defend America against nuclear attacks
delivered by other means, for example in a terrorist's suitcase. In any case,
arms control and diplomatic pressure may be more effective in reducing the
possibility of a nuclear attack, and the United States should continue to rely
primarily on the threat of nuclear retaliation to deter nuclear attacks.''
</P>
<P>
	   Al Gore: ``The decision to proceed toward deployment of a national missile
defense system needs to be based on: 1. the level of our confidence in the
technology; 2. its impact on our ability to protect arms control; 3. an
assessment of the cost; and 4. an evaluation of the threat. As President, I
would be willing to consider changes to the Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty
restricting missile deployment and even abandoning the treaty if the United
States was seriously threatened by a missile attack from a 'rogue' nation.''
</P>
<P>
	   Reform:
</P>
<P>
	   Pat Buchanan: ``Yes. The U.S. must not allow a 30-year-old ABM treaty, with
a defunct Soviet Union, to prevent us from defending our people from a nuclear
missile attack. Test a ballistic missile defense until it works; then build it,
without apology. U.S. security is paramount.''
</P>
<P>
	   Republicans:
</P>
<P>
	   Gary Bauer: ``As one of my first acts in office, I will order deployment of
a strategic missile defense to begin defending the American people against
nuclear attacks.''
</P>
<P>
	   George W. Bush: ``Yes. At the earliest possible date, my administration will
deploy anti-ballistic missile systems, both theater and national, to guard
America and our allies against attack and blackmail. I will work to persuade
Russia that it is in both our nations' best interests to amend the
anti-ballistic missile treaty to allow these defense systems to protect our
people from rogue attacks. If Russia refuses, we will withdraw from the treaty.
The President of the United States has a solemn obligation to protect the
American people and our allies from nuclear attack.''
</P>
<P>
	   Steve Forbes: ``We could construct viable missile defense systems for
ourselves and our allies in Europe, Israel, Japan, Taiwan, and South Korea -- to
name a few -- by integrating new missile defense innovations with existing
technologies on the Navy's Aegis cruisers. American taxpayers have already
invested some $50 billion in missile defense research. Experts believe it would
take less than $10 billion to finish the job.''
</P>
<P>
	   Orrin Hatch: ``Yes. Beginning with my support of Ronald Reagan's Strategic
Defense Initiative, I have consistently and without exception supported or
co-sponsored every congressional initiative to research, fund and deploy at the
soonest possible time a theater missile defense of the United States.''
</P>
<P>
	   Alan Keyes: ``Yes.''
</P>
<P>
	   John McCain: ``Yes. I believe the American people can and must be protected
from the possibility of a missile attack on our soil. Recent reports of
successful tests of a missile defense system demonstrate that such a system can
work. I supported legislation stating that it should be the policy of the United
States to build a national missile defense system as soon as technologically
possible. As President, I would make the deployment of a national missile
defense system, as well as defense systems for our Armed Forces deployed
overseas, one of my highest priorities.''

<HEADLINE> Pay raise, pension bill, and about 150 others on tap for last  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   TRENTON, N.J. (AP) - New Jersey's 208th Legislature is headed for the
history books, but lawmakers are scurrying to add a few twists before the final
chapter is written.
<P>
	   The two-year legislative session officially ends at noon on Tuesday, when
leaders will declare "sine die," Latin for "without (another) day." Both houses
of the state Legislature have slated Monday voting sessions to finish out their
business.
</P>
<P>
	   This year's last day doesn't have to feature all kinds of drama, because
lawmakers can simply pick up where they left off. Of the 120 lawmakers who make
up the 208th Legislature, all but four will be part of the 209th Legislature.
</P>
<P>
	   With all those lawmakers ready to return, what could possibly occupy them on
Monday? How about a plan to raise their pay, and the pay of the governor, judges
and scores of other public officials? How about a controversial pension proposal
for police and firefighters? An effort to curb youth smoking? The confirmation
of yet another state Supreme Court justice advanced by Gov. Christie Whitman?
All those are on tap, along with another 150 or so bills slated for Assembly and
Senate action.
</P>
<P>
	   "It will be somewhat chaotic," said Senate President Donald DiFrancesco.
"But it won't be as chaotic as in past years, when there was high turnover in
Legislature."
</P>
<P>
	   The last-day activity is likely to keep Whitman busy for the next few weeks.
</P>
<P>
	   The Assembly Monday has posted 43 bills for action that have already passed
the Senate. The Senate has posted 25 bills for action that have already passed
the Assembly, including a bill to crack down on tobacco use by juveniles.
</P>
<P>
	   If each house acts on the other's bills without making changes, that would
send 68 pieces of legislation to the governor's desk. As of Friday, she already
had about 50 bills.
</P>
<P>
	   In addition, both houses have slated action on identical bills, which would
give the governor more work. And among the last-day, both-house bills is one
that has gained attention for its last-minute maneuvering: pay raises for
lawmakers and other public officials.
</P>
<P>
	   The bill would raise lawmaker pay from $35,000 to $49,000. That would put
New Jersey's part-time Legislature in the upper tier for pay in the nation.
However, the pay hike wouldn't take effect until 2002, and by that time, it
would be the first lawmaker raise in a dozen years. Also in the bill (A-3626 and
S-2297) are pay raises for judges, prosecutors, various commission members, the
governor, and cabinet officers.
</P>
<P>
	   A pay commission set up by lawmakers perennially wary about voting
themselves higher salaries suggested they receive fatter checks. But no action
was taken until last week, when lawmakers suddenly amended existing bills
introduced earlier in the session to reflect most of the commission's
recommendations. If enacted, most of raises would be phased in over three years,
and the final price tag for taxpayers would be $15 million a year.
</P>
<P>
	   Both houses have also slated action on bills that would enhance the pension
benefits for police officers and firefighters. The "20 and Out" legislation
(A-2328 and S-1742) improves retirement benefits after 20 years on the job and
would increase benefits for surviving spouses.
</P>
<P>
	   The Fraternal Order of Police says the bill would provide municipal officers
parity with State Police benefits. However, the state League of Municipalities
says the bill would be a several hundred million dollar hit on the pension
system, forcing towns to ante up more to keep it solvent. The league says the
bill would cost property taxpayers more and would violate lawmakers' vow against
making costly mandates without providing state money.
</P>
<P>
	   Other bills on tap in both houses would allow towns to set up payment
schedules for motorists who've got lots of parking tickets, and a bill that
would prohibit possession or consumption of alcoholic beverages on private
property by those under the legal drinking age.
</P>
<P>
	   The state Senate is expected to approve Banking and Insurance Commissioner
Jaynee LaVecchia's nomination as state Supreme Court justice. LaVecchia, 45,
would replace the retiring Marie Garibaldi. Her nomination cleared the Senate
Judiciary Committee on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
	   In some cases, bills have been slated even though the other house isn't
expected to act. For example, the Senate has called a vote on a bill to deal
with the multibillion dollar issue of school construction, even though Assembly
Speaker Jack Collins says he wants explore the constitutional question of
whether the state should pay the full construction freight for poor school
districts. And DiFrancesco has called a vote on his just-introduced bill
reacting to long lines at DMV auto inspection stations.
</P>
<P>
	   Some bills slated for final action Monday would:
</P>
<P>
	   -Provide dollars to survivors of slain police officers to equal that
realized from the benefit concert for Mumia Abu-Jamal at the Meadowlands
(A-3036, in the Assembly);
</P>
<P>
	   -Officially authorize a school choice program (S-2171, in the Assembly).
</P>
<P>
	   -Rename the "New Jersey Turnpike" the "New Jersey Veterans Turnpike"
(A-1111, in the Senate);
</P>
<P>
	   -Toughen the enforcement of the seatbelt law, a move advocates say could
save 50 lives in the next year (A-1314, in the Senate);
</P>
<P>
	   -Penalize truckers who violate rules keeping them to interstate roads
(A-3540, in the Senate).

<HEADLINE> Czech Man Goes Long Way for Love  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   PRAGUE, Czech Republic (AP) -- The red roses apparently didn't do the trick.
And the chocolates must've been a bust.
</P>
<P>
	   But an impressively persistent suitor in Prague won't give up professing
sweet nothings to the one who got away. The man, known only as A, has rented
advertising space in 105 cars of the Czech capital's subway system to publicize
his entreaties to his former sweetheart, whom his ad calls M.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Dear M., the only thing you left me are the memories,'' A's ad says. ``I
hope that you still take the subway and that, sooner or later, you will find my
letter.''
</P>
<P>
	   ``I think of you all the time ... how you were preparing eggs or pancakes in
the morning, wearing my white T-shirt ...,'' the billboard letter says. It is
signed ``A.''
</P>
<P>
	   A has paid for his ads through the end of January, said Karel Brezina,
director of Rencar, the agency selling advertising space in Prague's subway.
Brezina declined to identify A by name.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We liked it, and we still had some free space, so we reduced the price
substantially,'' Brezina said.
</P>
<P>
	   A had to pay only $285 for the whole month, much less than the usual monthly
price of $43 per advertising space.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We are prepared to give him the same price in February,'' Brezina said.
``Should he need March too, the price will have to be higher.''

<HEADLINE> What New Jersey? Change in statistics would do away with Garden  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   WASHINGTON (AP) - New Jersey's hospitals and high-tech businesses are
facing off over proposed new definitions of metropolitan areas, a debate that
cuts to the core of the Garden State's identity.
<P>
	   If the new standards are approved, the northern half of New Jersey would be
wrapped into the New York metropolitan area for purposes of federal
data-gathering. Most of the state's southern half would become part of the
Philadelphia metropolitan area.
</P>
<P>
	   Statistically speaking, New Jersey would no longer exist.
</P>
<P>
	   "We'd disappear," said Joan Verplanck, president of the New Jersey Chamber
of Commerce, which has led the opposition to the new definitions.
</P>
<P>
	   Verplanck said the proposed changes would undermine New Jersey's efforts to
attract new companies, which use federal statistics to locate areas ripe for
doing business.
</P>
<P>
	   She said they would also codify the long-fought impression that New Jersey
is merely an extension of New York City and Philadelphia.
</P>
<P>
	   "It's almost as though that must be how we're viewed in Washington," she
said, "and to let it just happen would be to throw in the towel."
</P>
<P>
	   Along with other high-tech business groups, the chamber urged political
leaders to communicate their displeasure to the Metropolitan Area Standards
Review Committee. Gov. Christie Whitman did just that.
</P>
<P>
	   In her Dec. 20 letter, she wrote: "While New York may be a core urban area
with strong ties to northern New Jersey, Long Island and southwestern
Connecticut, these areas are not strongly tied to each other."
</P>
<P>
	   Several members of Congress from Long Island's Nassau and Suffolk counties
also objected to the proposed changes. "Our economy is distinct and structurally
different from the economy of New York," they wrote.
</P>
<P>
	   New Jersey's congressional delegation prepared to weigh in as well. But they
held their fire after New Jersey hospitals declared that the proposed changes
would throw them a financial lifeline.
</P>
<P>
	   Gary Carter, president of the New Jersey Hospital Association, said New
Jersey hospitals would receive about $200 million more per year in federal
reimbursements because the new standards would "essentially recognize that we're
having to recruit out of the same labor market as New York."
</P>
<P>
	   At issue is how the federal government uses information from the 2000
Census. The Office of Management and Budget created a Metropolitan Area
Standards Review Committee to review the current definitions of metropolitan
areas.
</P>
<P>
	   Right now, for the purposes of federal statistics, New Jersey is divided
into nine such areas: Bergen-Passaic, Jersey City, Middlesex-Somerset-Hunterdon,
Monmouth-Ocean, Newark, Trenton, Atlantic-Cape May, Philadelphia and
Vineland-Millville-Bridgeton.
</P>
<P>
	   New Jersey business leaders want to consolidate the nine areas into two -
northern New Jersey and southern New Jersey. If that were to happen, they say,
northern New Jersey in particular would soar to the top of national ratings of
places to live and work.
</P>
<P>
	   "We'd rank number four in the country as a place of high-tech employment,
behind Boston, San Jose and Chicago," said Tom Uhlman, an executive at Lucent
Technologies and co-chair of Edison Partnership, a New Jersey business advocacy
group. "Northern New Jersey would rank number one nationally as a place for the
total number of high-tech businesses, ahead of Silicon Valley, New York City and
Atlanta."
</P>
<P>
	   But the federal review commission took the idea one step further, proposing
to include northern Jersey in a New York City "megapolitan area" and much of
southern Jersey in a Philadelphia "megapolitan area."
</P>
<P>
	   Dismayed, New Jersey's high-tech companies urged the commission to shy away
from creating such huge metropolitan areas. As proposed, the New York
"megapolitan" area would hold 19 million people.
</P>
<P>
	   Brad McDerman, an economic development consultant to Edison Partnership,
said the commission also needs to recognize "how New Jersey thinks of itself."
</P>
<P>
	   "While northern New Jersey is related to New York, northern New Jersey is a
distinctly separate place," he said.
</P>
<P>
	   The public comment period ended Dec. 30. The OMB plans to issue its new
standards before Census Day on April 1.

<HEADLINE> Indonesia Refugees Seek Shelter  </HEADLINE>
   By IRWAN FIRDAUS Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   AMBON, Indonesia (AP) -- Fearing a resurgence of the religious clashes that
have claimed nearly 1,000 lives in eastern Indonesia in the past two weeks,
thousands of people fled their homes Sunday and were wandering city streets,
looking for a place to stay.
</P>
<P>
	   Hundreds of soldiers guarded the streets in the divided city of Ambon, the
capital of Indonesia's Maluku province. In nearby North Maluku, refugees
continued to pour into the city of Ternate, fearing violence on surrounding
islands, said Col. Didik Setiyadi, commander of Ambon's Halong naval base.
</P>
<P>
	   But despite the tension, Muslims and Christians in one refugee camp managed
to make a separate peace, at least for a day.
</P>
<P>
	   The thousands of refugees in a camp at the naval base held a dress rehearsal
for a musical performance planned for Monday. The planned concert marks the
Muslim holiday of Eid al-Fitr -- and Christmas, which many Christians could not
celebrate two weeks ago because of the violence.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We all live together in this camp, so we should all celebrate together,''
Annisa, a Christian refugee, said after rehearsing her song. ``I hope this will
lead to peace everywhere.''
</P>
<P>
	   Despite pitched battles in Ambon, the navy has managed to keep things under
control inside the refugee camp.
</P>
<P>
	   ``There are strict rules here,'' Setiyadi said. ``If either the Christians
or Muslims break the rules and fight they are out.''
</P>
<P>
	   In Ternate, the atmosphere was peaceful but tense Sunday as many of the
thousands of refugees walked the streets looking for shelter, said Murid, a
Ternate resident.
</P>
<P>
	   The unrest in Maluku and North Maluku, known as the Spice Islands during
Dutch colonial rule, is Indonesia's worst religious violence since independence
in 1949. It has sparked fears that the world's fourth most populous country
could splinter along deep-rooted religious and ethnic fault lines.
</P>
<P>
	   As Muslims celebrated the Eid al-Fitr holiday week a year ago, a scuffle in
Ambon sparked the violent clashes that have left at least 1,800 dead.
</P>
<P>
	   In Jakarta, Vice President Megawati Sukarnoputri defended herself Sunday
against accusations that she has not done enough to stop the fighting. She urged
people in the region to work for peace.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Community members themselves have to feel that it is their own
responsibility,'' Megawati told the official Antara news agency.
</P>
<P>
	   When President Abdurrahman Wahid came to power on Oct. 20, he made Megawati
responsible for stopping the violence in eastern Indonesia while he tackled the
problems in Aceh, where separatists are fighting for independence. In Aceh,
1,100 miles northwest of Jakarta, two policemen were killed Saturday when rebels
opened fire on a police station, Antara reported.

<HEADLINE> Israeli-Syrian Talks Near an End  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   SHEPHERDSTOWN, W.Va. (AP) -- With President Clinton due to resume his
mediation late Sunday, the inconclusive round of peacemaking between Israel and
Syria appeared to be nearing a close.
</P>
<P>
	   Diplomatic sources told The Associated Press that Israeli Prime Minister
Ehud Barak tentatively planned to leave the land-for-peace negotiations Monday
evening and that Syrian Foreign Minister Farouk al-Sharaa was likely to depart
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
	   They could leave behind experts to continue deliberations over a projected
Israeli pullback on the Golan Heights and a peace offer from Syria.
</P>
<P>
	   ``There is no doubt that the negotiation is difficult,'' Barak told Israeli
reporters while touring the Antietam National Battlefield, a Civil War site in
Sharpsburg, Md., with Secretary of State Madeleine Albright.
</P>
<P>
	   In his first public remarks since the talks began Jan. 3, Barak said ``the
negotiation is very complex.''
</P>
<P>
	   The prime minister, speaking Hebrew, also gave assurances to the Israeli
public that ``we will not sign an agreement unless, in our opinion, it will
strengthen the security of Israel and address its vital needs.''
</P>
<P>
	   Israel is contemplating a withdrawal from the Golan Heights, a border
highground with a commanding view of Syria, in exchange for a peace treaty.
</P>
<P>
	   Speaking in a light rain, Foreign Minister David Levy said of the
deliberations over a border between the two countries: ``Nothing has been agreed
upon.''
</P>
<P>
	   Clinton was due to return to Shepherdstown Sunday afternoon, a White House
official said in Washington, adding: ``He's going for meetings. The process
continues.''
</P>
<P>
	   Barak, a former military chief of staff, already has pledged to seek peace
with Syria as an alternative to conflict in the Middle East. But the symbolism
of a battlefield where casualties were high was at least beneath the surface.

<HEADLINE> Marriage Rates Drop in New York  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- You have to listen pretty hard to hear wedding bells in New
York these days.
</P>
<P>
	   The number of new marriages in the city is at its lowest point since the
1970s, pushed down by a decline in the number of people in their 20s, an end to
the taboo on living together outside of wedlock and financial incentives that
can make it more appealing to stay single, The New York Times reported Sunday.
</P>
<P>
	   Although the city has long been a haven for singles, the decline in marriage
rates appears to mirror a national trend.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The baby boomers basically have all had their initial marriage by now,''
Tom Smith, who runs the National Opinion Research Center at the University of
Chicago, told the Times. ``And we have a relatively small pool of people in the
prime ready-to-get-married age now.''
</P>
<P>
	   That age is generally around 25. Those in their mid- to late 20s are
underrepresented in the general population, since the number of births in the
United States declined 16 percent between 1965 and 1975.
</P>
<P>
	   In New York, the total number of new marriages fell 30 percent between 1997
and 1999. The 1997 figure was thought to be artificially high, though, since
changes in federal immigration laws prompted many immigrants to marry quickly.
</P>
<P>
	   In the last several years, city marriage rates have been at the lowest
levels since the late 1970s. In 1999, the marriage rate in New York was 7.6 per
1,000, down from 9.1 per 1,000 in 1997.
</P>
<P>
	   Marriage rates are also dropping nationally. In 1998, 8.3 per 1,000
Americans married, the lowest rate since 1958.
</P>
<P>
	   Among the causes cited by sociologists is a greater acceptance of living
together outside marriage. Financial incentives may also play a role. Some
low-wage workers lose tax credits when they marry and the so-called ``marriage
penalty'' affects some double-income couples.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I will never be married,'' said Ben Speth, 36, who lives in Brooklyn with
his girlfriend. ``I don't need the state's imprimatur. It is enough for me to
love and be loved.''

<HEADLINE> Tibetan Leader Leaves Guest House  </HEADLINE>
   By DEEPAK SHARMA Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   DHARMSALA, India (AP) -- Dozens of men, women and children waited outside a
guest house in northern India on Sunday to find out where a teen-age Buddhist
leader who escaped from Chinese-ruled Tibet had been taken.
</P>
<P>
	   The 14-year-old Karmapa was whisked away in a convoy of jeeps before dawn,
accompanied by an Indian official and 15 monks wearing the uniforms of the Dalai
Lama's guards. There was no official word on his whereabouts.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We don't know where our god, the Karmapa, is,'' said Tenzin Zyalpo, a
shopkeeper, standing outside the Chonor guest house. When local Tibetans pressed
against the gate asked questions about the Karmapa, maroon-robed monks inside
smiled and said only, ``We don't know.''
</P>
<P>
	   The teen-age Buddhist leader arrived at a Dharmsala hotel on Wednesday,
following an eight-day trek across the Himalayas through Nepal and northern
India to escape Chinese-ruled Tibet.
</P>
<P>
	   His defection and that of five followers, including his 24-year-old sister,
a Buddhist nun, cheered Tibetan exiles, embarrassed Beijing and surprised the
Indian government. It is the most significant exodus since the Dalai Lama and
tens of thousands of Tibetans departed their homeland after a failed 1959
uprising against Chinese rule.
</P>
<P>
	   In pre-dawn darkness illuminated only by television news cameras, the 17th
Karmapa, wearing a dark brown monk's robe, walked out of the Chonor guest house
where he had been staying since he arrived. His followers quietly disappeared
with him.
</P>
<P>
	   Since he arrived Wednesday, the Karmapa is said to have twice visited the
Dalai Lama. Dalai Lama's officials wanted to remove the Karmapa from the media
spotlight and into a more secure place where he can rest and recover from
exhaustion, blisters and scrapes incurred on his journey, a source, speaking on
condition of anonymity, said Sunday.
</P>
<P>
	   Those close to the Dalai Lama's administration said the teen was frustrated
in Tibet at not being allowed to meet with his teachers. Chinese authorities had
repeatedly denied a visa to his principal teacher, Tai Situ Rinpoche, who has a
monastery near Dharmsala.
</P>
<P>
	   The escape could prod the Chinese communist leadership to intensify an
already stern four-year campaign to purge Tibetan monasteries of Dalai Lama
supporters.

<HEADLINE> Report: Farmland preservation money isn't well spent  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   TRENTON, N.J. (AP) - Millions of dollars the state is spending to
preserve farmland is going toward acreage that can't legally be developed anyway
because it contains wetlands, a newspaper analysis found.
<P>
	   The Gannett New Jersey Bureau reported its findings for Sunday's editions
based on an examination of land appraisals and wetlands maps. The newspaper also
found that in some instances farmland preservation money is going to county
officials who helped write the program's guidelines.
</P>
<P>
	   The program's supporters say the state must act quickly to preserve its
remaining open space, even if the cost is high.
</P>
<P>
	   "Sure, maybe there's a farm or two on the list that shouldn't be there,"
said Jim Yates, director of Gloucester County's farmland preservation program.
"But that land, we've got it now. Once they build houses on it, you can never
get it back."
</P>
<P>
	   Yates acknowledged that of 1,064 acres of land that was preserved in
Gloucester and Salem counties two weeks ago, one-third is wetlands and might not
be ideal for development. The state paid $4.4 million for the land.
</P>
<P>
	   But he said it was money worth spending because preserving that land would
maintain the area's rural character and keep local taxes lower for decades to
come.
</P>
<P>
	   Assemblyman Joseph Suliga, D-Union, doesn't agree. He voted against the
state's open space preservation plan, which includes farmland preservation, in
1998.
</P>
<P>
	   "All we're doing is making farmers rich," Suliga said. "We never had to buy
this land. We could have preserved it through proper zoning."
</P>
<P>
	   Gov. Christie Whitman has pledged to preserve 1 million acres of open space.
To accomplish this, she signed into law last year a $1.5 billion land
preservation bill that would spend $98 million a year over the next 10 years.
</P>
<P>
	   Suliga says the state's 600,000 acres of wetlands, where development is
already banned, shouldn't be counted toward that goal.
</P>
<P>
	   So far, development rights to 377 farms across the state - 54,038 acres in
71 municipalities - have been purchased with farmland preservation money. The
money is paid to farmers who agree not to sell their land to developers, and in
return they can continue to farm their land. Depending on the farm's size and
its appraised value, the farmers accept fees of about $3,000 to $12,000 an acre.
</P>
<P>
	   Questions about the quality of farmland being preserved have arisen in
Burlington County, which has had 11,000 acres accepted into the farmland
preservation program - more than any other county.
</P>
<P>
	   In July 1998, the program paid $945,556 to preserve 236 acres in Mansfield.
But according to an evaluation by a Princeton land appraisal firm, only 44.8
percent of the property, or about 106 acres, could potentially be developed -
most of the rest was wetlands.
</P>
<P>
	   There is no guarantee that wetlands will remain off-limits to development in
the future, so they still need to be preserved, said Carole Quattlander,
attorney for the Burlington County Farmland Preservation Program.
</P>
<P>
	   But Michael Paston, an unsuccessful Democratic Burlington County freeholder
candidate, said officials are taking the wrong approach to preservation.
</P>
<P>
	   "All they ever talk about is the number of acres they preserve. They never
talk about the quality of the acres or whether it's developable in the first
place," he said.
</P>
<P>
	   During his campaign, Paston pointed out that county officials who helped
write the program's guidelines have also benefited from it.
</P>
<P>
	   William Pettit Sr., chairman of the county's farmland preservation board,
received $790,259 in January 1990 for his 139-acre farm in Springfield. His son,
William Jr., was paid $1.59 million in preservation funds for his 327-acre farm
in Southampton in February 1992.
</P>
<P>
	   Officials say prices paid to members of the agricultural boards are similar
to those paid to other farmers.
</P>
<P>
	   Despite critics such as Paston, farmland preservation has gained popularity,
with 16 counties voting to raise taxes to buy farmland and open space. And
residents of more than 120 towns have voted to increase local taxes for such
purposes.
</P>
<P>
	   "No one is against this program," said Burlington County Freeholder William
Haines Jr. "The way people feel about it, it's like God and country."

<HEADLINE> Annan Seeks Help To Decide UN Role  </HEADLINE>
   By EDITH M. LEDERER Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   UNITED NATIONS (AP) -- Secretary-General Kofi Annan is inviting world
leaders, key lawmakers and grassroots organizations to cast a critical eye on
the United Nations and help shape its role in the 21st century.
</P>
<P>
	   Three years ago, Annan proposed using the year 2000 to examine the
challenges facing the 55-year-old world body and to decide whether it needs to
change its priorities or overhaul its methods of operation.
</P>
<P>
	   The secretary-general envisioned a millennium summit to be attended by
government leaders, a ``people's millennium assembly,'' and several regional
hearings to gather ideas from those who couldn't come to New York.
</P>
<P>
	   The United Nations has not only moved ahead with those plans -- but has gone
beyond Annan's proposal in an effort to increase participation and to look more
broadly at the challenges facing the world in the next century.
</P>
<P>
	   The centerpiece will still be the Millennium Summit from Sept. 6-8, at the
start of the annual General Assembly session. Leaders from all 188 U.N. member
states have been invited.
</P>
<P>
	   ``It looks very likely that it will be the largest single gathering of heads
of state and government ever held,'' said Assistant Secretary-General Miles
Stoby, who is coordinating preparations in Annan's office.
</P>
<P>
	   Annan's people's assembly has become the Millennium Forum, which will bring
1,400 representatives from grassroots groups worldwide to the United Nations
from May 22-26. An annual U.N. meeting for grassroots organizations will be held
the week before the summit, with about 1,000 participants, Stoby said.
</P>
<P>
	   Other local, national and regional meetings are being planned across the
globe to funnel ideas to the summit from a wider group of people.
</P>
<P>
	   South Africa's U.N. Ambassador Dumisani Kumalo said many member states
applaud the idea, saying that the vision for the 21st century should not be left
to governments alone.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We don't have a corner on wisdom,'' said Kumalo, adding that he would also
like the business and the entertainment community to be heard.
</P>
<P>
	   Themes that will be covered in ``The U.N. in the 21st Century'' summit
include peace, security, disarmament, development and poverty eradication. Other
themes are still being discussed.
</P>
<P>
	   The Millennium Forum has similar themes as well as human rights and
``achieving equity, justice and diversity,'' said co-chairman Techeste Ahderom.
</P>
<P>
	   Annan plans to bring out a report in advance of the summit sketching his
vision for the United Nations in the 21st century with a series of concrete
proposals, Stoby said. The General Assembly has not yet decided whether the
summit will produce a declaration, a plan of action, or some other document.
</P>
<P>
	   Governments pay the bills of their leaders and the summit coincides with the
General Assembly so most costs will be covered.
</P>
<P>
	   The United Nations' performance has been severely censured during the past
year.
</P>
<P>
	   Highly critical reports documented the U.N. failure to prevent the 1994
Rwandan genocide and the death of thousands of Bosnian Muslims in the
U.N.-protected enclave of Srebrenica in 1995. The United Nations was initially
sidestepped in the Kosovo conflict and it failed to prevent a rampage by
pro-Indonesian militias in East Timor.
</P>
<P>
	   The secretary-general is almost certain to again call for the Security
Council to protect civilians from ethnically based terror and other human rights
abuses -- overriding national sovereignty if necessary. He will undoubtedly make
proposals about U.N. reform, and is also likely to renew his concern about the
impact of the global economy on poorer nations.

<TEXT>
<P>
    LONDON (AP) -- A plot to kidnap Victoria Beckham -- aka Posh Spice -- and
her son for $1.6 million in ransom was foiled by Scotland Yard's elite organized
crime unit, Britain's Sunday newspapers reported.
</P>
<P>
	   Kidnappers planned to abduct the pair while the singer's English soccer star
husband David Beckham competed in a match against Scotland match last November,
according to The Sunday Times.
</P>
<P>
	   Mother and child were to be held captive in a north London house. One
newspaper suggested an underworld crime figure was involved in the planning.
</P>
<P>
	   Police placed an undercover officer with the couple's security detail and
put their house under 24-hour surveillance. Other officers kept watch over the
25-year-old Spice Girl and her 9-month-old son, Brooklyn.
</P>
<P>
	   Newspapers said the kidnappers did not get past the planning stage and no
arrests were made.
</P>
<P>
	   A Scotland Yard spokeswoman refused to confirm the news reports, saying
police would not comment on cases involving kidnapping or conspiracy to kidnap.

<TEXT>
<P>
    NEW YORK (AP) -- Warren Zevon will soon be 53, so the rocker figured it was
about time to write songs about growing old.
</P>
<P>
	   "It's an even more wretched human condition than being a misunderstood
youth," Zevon says in Sunday's Daily News. "So that makes it perfect for rock
'n' roll kvetching."
</P>

a salute to "the grotesque charm of aging."
</P>
<P>
	   Known for 1970s hits including "Werewolf in London" and "Exciteable Boy,"
Zevon found himself limited to a cult following after mainstream reviewers
branded his quirky, introspective tunes morbid, a classification he still
disputes.
</P>
<P>
	   "You've gotta remember, it's not morbid to me," Zevon said. "I know the
hearse is parked at the curb and the motor is running. The thing is, I'm still
trying to be cheery about it."

    LONDON (AP) -- Andrew Lloyd Webber is set to become the top landlord of
London's West End theater district after teaming up with a finance company to
buy 10 famed theaters in a deal reportedly worth $143 million.
</P>
<P>
	   The composer said Sunday he is buying Australian-owned Stoll Moss, whose
London theaters include the Palladium, the Garrick, Her Majesty's and Theater

</P>
<P>

musicals like "Phantom of the Opera," "Cats" and "Evita." He instead plans to
explore new plays.
</P>
<P>
	   "I think a lot of people have been worried the group would fall into the
hands of people who are money men but would not necessarily understand," Lloyd

<HEADLINE> Britain Protests Libya Smuggling  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON (AP) -- Britain said Sunday it would protest an attempt by Libya to
smuggle through London components of Scud missiles capable of carrying chemical
or biological warheads.
</P>
<P>
	   News that British customs agents discovered 32 crates of missile parts,
disguised as automative spares, on a British Airways flight destined for Libya
was widely seen as an embarrassment to both countries.
</P>
<P>
	   The find came within months of Britain's restoring diplomatic relations with
Col. Moammar Gadhafi's administration after a 15-year break. For Gadhafi, it
marked a setback in his attempts at rehabilitating relations with Europe and the
United States.
</P>
<P>
	   Foreign Secretary Robin Cook accused Libya of a ``clear breach of the
European Union arms embargo.''
</P>
<P>
	   The export of missile technology to Libya remains illegal under
international embargoes.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We have long had concerns about Libya's ambitions to develop enhanced
missile technology ... we will remain vigilant and alert to frustrate any
attempt to breach them,'' Cook added in a statement Sunday.
</P>
<P>
	   He said he had instructed Britain's new ambassador to Libya, Richard Dalton,
to protest the smuggling of the missile parts, which were found Nov. 24 in a
transit shed at London's Gatwick Airport. Dalton arrived in Tripoli only on
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
	   The government confirmed the discovery of the missile parts after a British
newspaper broke the story on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
	   The Sunday Times said the shipment, found during a joint investigation by
customs and intelligence officers, was sent to Britain from Taiwan in the name
of a knitwear company called Hontex.
</P>
<P>
	   In Taiwan, newspapers also reported that the shipment belonged to Hontex,
and said the company was based in the southern China province of Fujian,
directly across from Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
	   Britain announced in November it would restore full diplomatic ties after
Libya paid unspecified compensation for the 1984 death of a London policewoman
shot by a gunman in the Libyan embassy.
</P>
<P>
	   Britain resumed commercial flights to Libya last year after Gadhafi handed
over for trial at a special court in The Netherlands two suspects in the bombing
of Pan Am Flight 103 over Lockerbie, Scotland, in 1988.
</P>
<P>
	   The Sunday Times said paperwork seized along with the crates indicated the
shipment originated in Taiwan and that other crates had already reached Libya.
</P>
<P>
	   The missile parts included components of the jet propulsion system for Scuds
with a distance of up to 600 miles, the paper said.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Our investigations into this seizure are continuing and no further details
are being released at the moment,'' the Customs and Excise Department said.

	   MOZDOK, Russia (AP) -- The Russian military encountered stiff resistance
today from well-armed Chechen fighters in the capital of Grozny although the
rebels are suffering high casualties, the Russian Defense Ministry said. Despite
a pause in bombardment in Grozny announced Friday by Russian commanders, new
federal attacks on the capital were reported today. The attacks were part of
intense military activity that continued throughout Chechnya, including new
bombing raids despite continued bad weather and low visibility. The military
command had said the pause was announced in part to let thousands of civilians
trapped in Grozny to flee.

	   LONDON (AP) -- A plot to kidnap Victoria Beckham -- aka Posh Spice -- and
her son for $1.6 million in ransom was foiled by Scotland Yard's elite organized
crime unit, Britain's Sunday newspapers reported. Kidnappers planned to abduct
the pair while the singer's English soccer star husband David Beckham competed
in a match against Scotland match last November, according to The Sunday Times.
Police placed an undercover officer with the couple's security detail and put
their house under 24-hour surveillance. Other officers kept watch over the
25-year-old Spice Girl and her 9-month-old son, Brooklyn.

Marriage Rates Drop in New York
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
	   NEW YORK (AP) -- The number of new marriages in the city is at its lowest
point since the 1970s, pushed down by a decline in the number of people in their
20s, an end to the taboo on living together outside of wedlock and financial
incentives that can make it more appealing to stay single, The New York Times
reported today. In 1999, the marriage rate in New York was 7.6 per 1,000, down
from 9.1 per 1,000 in 1997. Marriage rates are also dropping nationally. In
1998, 8.3 per 1,000 Americans married, the lowest rate since 1958.

the action many expect to be announced Tuesday at the monthly meeting of the
Postal Service's board of governors. Two of the post office's main competitors
-- Federal Express and United Parcel Service -- recently announced rate
increases to take effect in February, citing rising costs.

<HEADLINE> Russians Attack Chechen Capital  </HEADLINE>
   By ELMIRA KOZHAYEVA Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   MOZDOK, Russia (AP) -- Russian helicopter gunships rocketed rebel positions
in Chechnya's capital on Sunday as heavy street fighting resumed after a brief
lull during Orthodox Christmas.
</P>
<P>
	   Russian troops were continuing their push to take Grozny, the capital. But
in yet another sign that Russia is still far from victory, rebel forces launched
new attacks outside Grozny, assaulting federal troops in two nearby towns and
ambushing a Russian troop column.
</P>
<P>
	   After steadily retreating over the last few months, the rebels have gone on
the offensive in the past week in Grozny and other parts of the breakaway
republic.
</P>
<P>
	   The Defense Ministry said its forces encountered stiff resistance from
well-armed Chechen fighters in Grozny but insisted that the rebels were
suffering high casualties. Helicopter gunships supported ground attacks by
rocketing rebel positions in the northwestern Staropromyslovsky district.
</P>
<P>
	   The fighting came a day after a relatively quiet Saturday, when the holiday
and heavy fog kept fighting to a minimum.
</P>
<P>
	   The military said Sunday that it was still refraining from bombardment of
central Grozny, where many civilians are hiding -- and where federal troops are
trying to overrun rebel positions. But artillery continued to support ground
units trying to advance deep into Grozny, and the ban on air bombardment did not
appear to extend beyond the center of the city.
</P>
<P>
	   Commanders announced a pause in bombing in Grozny's center on Friday, saying
it was meant to mark the Orthodox Christmas holiday and to allow the thousands
of civilians trapped in Grozny to flee.
</P>
<P>
	   Only about 400 people left the capital on Friday and Saturday, the ITAR-Tass
news agency quoted the Ministry for Emergency Situations as saying. Some 20,000
people are believed to still be in the city, the ministry said.
</P>
<P>
	   Russia's drive to occupy Chechnya has stalled in the face of bitter rebel
resistance in Grozny and the southern mountains. The top two Russian combat
commanders were removed last week after repeated predictions that Grozny was
about to fall did not prove accurate.
</P>
<P>
	   In the town of Argun, nine miles east of Grozny, a 300-strong rebel band
attacked Russian forces Sunday. The militants blockaded several dozen Russian
officers and soldiers inside the local military headquarters and an unknown
number of servicemen in the railway station, said Lt. Col. Konstantin
Kukharenko, a military spokesman. Fighting there was continuing Sunday evening.
</P>
<P>
	   Rebels also launched a surprise attack on a Russian post between Argun and
the town of Shali, Kukharenko said. They pulled up to the checkpoint in a bus
and opened fire on the troops, killing two and wounding another.
</P>
<P>
	   Russian helicopters and armored vehicles were rushed to the area, and the
battle lasted for some two hours, Kukharenko said. The Russians liberated the
post. The rebels' fate was not known.
</P>
<P>
	   Chechen presidential spokesman Selim Abdulmuslimov told the Interfax news
agency that about 500 rebels took over the center of Shali on Sunday, raising a
green Chechen flag, and that federal troops were fleeing. But the military
denied the claim, and an Associated Press reporter did not notice any unusual
military movements outside the town on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
	   As federal forces have intensified their assault on Grozny and the southern
mountains, the rebels have promised to wage a guerrilla war in areas already
controlled by Russian troops.
</P>
<P>
	   Over the past several days, they have launched several attacks around
Gudermes, the largest Russian-controlled city in Chechnya. Russian troops
repulsed an attempt by about 500 militants to advance on Gudermes on Sunday,
Interfax reported. The report cited Vyacheslav Ikayev, the acting chief of staff
of the Eastern Group of Russian forces.
</P>
<P>
	   Russia launched the ground offensive against Chechnya-based Islamic
militants in September after weeks of airstrikes. The campaign began after
militants invaded the neighboring republic of Dagestan. Russia also blamed them
for a series of apartment bombings last year that killed about 300 people in
Russian cities.

<HEADLINE> Cayuga land claim bill comes due for New York state  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   SYRACUSE, N.Y. (AP) - A federal court jury's decision on how much
compensation the Cayuga Indian Nation should receive for its lost ancestral
lands will have a sweeping impact across upstate New York, say observers and
those involved in other Native American land claims.
<P>
	   Jurors will begin hearing evidence sometime this week as to what amount to
award the Cayugas in the first New York land claim case to reach the
compensation stage. Four other Iroquois Confederacy nations as well as tens of
thousands of upstate residents will be watching the trial closely.
</P>
<P>
	   "The Cayuga claim will set a precedent. It will likely set the stage for all
the other claims," said John Tahsuda, an adjunct law professor at Cornell
University and policy analyst for the National Indian Gaming Commission who has
written about land claims.
</P>
<P>
	   "We know how much land is in these disputes, but we don't know what the
valuation of that land is. That is where the impact will be," Tahsuda said.
</P>
<P>
	   "This jury is very important to all the other claims," agreed Joe Heath, an
attorney who represents the Onondaga Indian Nation. "Whatever message this jury
sends will have an impact on all the other land claim negotiations going on and
those yet to come."
</P>
<P>
	   Spokespeople for the Oneida and Mohawk nations said their tribes planned to
monitor the proceedings. However, they declined further comment because of
pending land claim negotiations with the state.
</P>
<P>
	   The Cayugas are seeking compensation for 64,027 acres of land in Cayuga and
Seneca counties surrounding the northern tip of Cayuga Lake, an area
approximately 7,000 property owners now call home. Before the Revolutionary War,
the Cayuga Indian Nation territory extended over almost 3 million acres.
</P>
<P>
	   The tribe claimed in a 1980 lawsuit that the state illegally acquired the
land by violating the 1790 Indian Trade and Non-Intercourse law requiring the
federal government to approve all land treaties. It is, in part, the same
argument made by the Oneidas, Senecas and Mohawks in their pending land claims
and the same issue that the Onondagas will raise when they file their land claim
later this year.
</P>
<P>
	   Presently, about 500 Cayugas live in western New York on and around the
Seneca's Cattaraugus reservation. Two other groups of Cayugas, each totaling
about 1,000, live in Canada and Oklahoma.
</P>
<P>
	   Unlike the other members of the Iroquois Confederacy who retained at least
some reservation land in New York, the Cayugas lost all their land here and have
been a "landless people in New York" since 1807, said Cayuga spokesman Clint
Halftown.
</P>
<P>
	   In 1994, U.S. District Judge Neal McCurn upheld the Cayuga's claim. The
original claim sought the return of all 64,000-plus acres and$350million. The
Cayugas have since dropped any demand for property ownersto be forced into
selling or otherwise giving up their land.
</P>
<P>
	   The Cayugas, the state and federal governments and the two counties had been
attempting to negotiate a settlement under the guidance of a court-appointed
mediator but were unsuccessful, leaving it up to a panel of jurors to now decide
what is fair compensation.
</P>
<P>
	   "There's always a chance (to a negotiated settlement)," said Martin Gold,
the Cayugas' attorney. "An important factor here is that when this is over, the
Cayugas and the surrounding population with still have to live together. It
would be better for everyone if they could agree for themselves rather than have
a decision imposed by a judge or a jury."
</P>
<P>
	   Last week, McCurn presided over a pretrial hearing to determine what expert
testimony could be presented to jurors during the trial by real estate
appraisers hired by each side. The hearing was scheduled to continue Monday.
Jury selection will begin as soon as the hearing is concluded.
</P>
<P>
	   John F. Havemeyer III, an appraiser hired by the Cayugas, testified that he
came up with a current market value of $191.8 million for the 64,027 acres.
Havemeyer said he thought 10 percent of the market value of the land for each of
the 204 years from 1796 to 1999 would be a fair "use and occupancy" award for
the Cayugas. He also estimated that $71 million worth of salt and gypsum had
been extracted from the land and could be considered lost income to the Cayugas.
</P>
<P>
	   In another ruling, McCurn said payments made over the past 205 years by New
York state to the Cayuga Indians can be considered by jurors in calculating the
amount of compensation the tribe can receive. The Cayugas had argued that the
payments should not be considered by the jury in determining an award because
they were based on illegal transactions.
</P>
<P>
	   The judge also said he would prohibit trial testimony regarding any alleged
emotional, psychological and cultural damage the Cayugas suffered because of the
loss of their ancestral homeland. He described such testimony as speculative.
</P>
<P>
	   The trial is expected to last from two to six weeks.

<HEADLINE> McCain Wants Memos Released  </HEADLINE>
   By WILLIAM C. MANN Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Sen. John McCain, seeking to show he did nothing wrong in
contacting federal regulators on behalf of big donors, said Sunday he is asking
all federal agencies to release any correspondence from him.
</P>
<P>
	   McCain's presidential campaign spokesman said the request is being channeled
through the Senate Commerce Committee, using the Freedom of Information Act
rather than a less formal request from McCain, R-Ariz., the committee chairman.
</P>
<P>
	   Howard Opinsky, the spokesman, said the request covers all documents since
1983, when McCain began his first of two terms in the House.
</P>
<P>
	   McCain said on CBS' ``Face the Nation'' the requests to make his
correspondence public would cover only the past 10 years or so. Asked for
clarification, Opinsky said McCain's order to his staff covered his career in
Congress, and the FOIA documents were drafted under that guideline.
</P>
<P>
	   ``This is a normal FOIA request that any American can make of any agency,''
Opinsky said.
</P>
<P>
	   Hundreds of documents released by his campaign show McCain wrote letters on
behalf of more than a dozen contributors over the past three years to federal
regulators overseen by his committee. Among agencies he prodded were the Federal
Communications Commission and the Transportation Department.
</P>
<P>
	   As he has before, McCain said Sunday that his only motive was to help
constituents and other Americans affected by the agencies' actions. Many of the
letters were to push recalcitrant agencies to act on delayed in decision-making.
</P>
<P>
	   On ABC's ``This Week,'' former Senate Majority Leader Bob Dole, R-Kan.,
defended his longtime colleague. ``I would guess if you searched the files of
the 100 senators, they've all had letters like that,'' Dole said.
</P>
<P>
	   Appearing on the program with her husband, Elizabeth Dole, forced out of the
race for the presidency this year by lack of money, said McCain had not acted
inappropriately. ``I mean, it's not inappropriate to ask for your constituents
that a decision be made. Up, down, whatever it is,'' she said.

<HEADLINE> New Hampshire Gets Set for Primary  </HEADLINE>
   By TED ANTHONY AP National Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   BOW, N.H. (AP) -- It was just after 8 a.m., and Sen. John McCain was well
into his latest town hall meeting. Before him sat more than 200 New Hampshire
citizens, firing question after question about military policy, corruption,
campaign financing and the environment.
</P>
<P>
	   And everybody was sitting up straight, awake and alert.
</P>
<P>
	   This is New Hampshire, after all, and voters demand more of their candidates
than 30-second commercials. From retired elementary school teacher Evelyn
Lindquist, an independent, came a common sentiment: ``I'm coming to hear as many
of these as I can.''
</P>
<P>
	   On New Hampshire television, the anchors are trumpeting a ``palpable
excitement,'' and while it may not be quite as frantic as they say, there's a
definite excitement afoot as the primary season kicks into high gear.
</P>
<P>
	   Nearly three dozen interviews with southern New Hampshire voters studying
the candidates and the issues for the nation's first primary Feb. 1 suggest an
optimism untempered by campaign-trail cynicism. Ask any group of voters --
Republican, Democrat or independent, the New Hampshire specialty -- and you'll
probably hear this: People feel as if they have some real choices this year.
</P>
<P>
	   ``This primary is different,'' said Christine Miller, a therapist and
Democratic ward leader in Concord. ``I find the lack of negative campaigning in
both parties surprising. And the amount of sticking to the issues, all the
candidates in both parties are hearing the electorate on that one.''
</P>
<P>
	   A Boston Herald/WCBV-TV poll taken after Wednesday's Democratic debate
showed 44 percent of New Hampshire voters who plan to cast Democratic primary
ballots would do so for Bill Bradley, while 38 percent prefer Vice President Al
Gore. The margin of error was 5 percentage points.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I think that Democrats feel in general that no matter whether they're
supporting Bradley or Gore, they will be content with the victor,'' said Mary
Louise Hancock, a longtime New Hampshire Democratic activist. ``I don't feel any
acrimony or any heavy contention or any animosity.''
</P>
<P>
	   A Republican poll showed McCain and Texas Gov. George W. Bush as the GOP
candidates to beat. Each had nearly equal support from likely New Hampshire
Republican voters -- Bush with 33 percent and McCain with 32 percent. Publisher
Steve Forbes placed third with 12 percent. The margin of error was 4.8
percentage points.
</P>
<P>
	   Front-runners and dark horses alike are barnstorming New Hampshire in myriad
ways. Republican Alan Keyes takes his message to a youth political convention
this week. Republican Gary Bauer on Thursday became the latest candidate to
address the Legislature.
</P>
<P>
	   Still, in New Hampshire it's the small-town events and living-room
meet-and-greets where candidates tend to make the deepest impressions. The day
before Bauer went to the Statehouse, he spoke at a meeting of the Nashua Fish
and Game Association.
</P>
<P>
	   That same day, in the diminutive southeastern community of Newmarket,
passing drivers -- including one with a McCain bumper sticker -- honked and
waved at the Bradley caravan outside Town Hall. Inside, Bradley was affirming
his commitment to abortion rights; outside, volunteers from New Hampshire and
farther afield were plying the streets in bitter cold to give Newmarket an
hourlong taste of campaign pageantry.
</P>
<P>
	   Among them was Justin Browne, 20, from Amherst, N.H., volunteering for his
first campaign. Though Browne likes Bradley for his health-care proposals, the
college student finds a deeper appeal: Bradley ``doesn't seem like a
candidate.''
</P>
<P>
	   ``He just seems like a normal man -- not only that he has integrity, but
that he shows it,'' Browne said.
</P>
<P>
	   In New Hampshire, like elsewhere, voters steer conversations toward ``the
character issue.'' Though many have favorite causes -- Democrats like to talk
about health care and Social Security, Republicans gravitate toward taxes --
integrity is playing a big role as the primary approaches. Voters from both
parties say they want a president with integrity.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I want someone who'll change the White House. The opposite of disgrace,''
said John Violette of Bow, a retired Xerox service manager and Republican
attending McCain's town meeting last week.
</P>
<P>
	   Violette, who credits both parties with fielding some ``excellent
candidates'' this year, is an army veteran looking for military experience in
his next president, which led him to McCain. He said he also likes the Arizona
senator's easygoing nature.
</P>
<P>
	   He wasn't surprised at the early morning turnout of attentive folks from
both parties.
</P>
<P>
	   ``People in New Hampshire care more,'' Violette said. ``They know it's a
responsibility.''
</P>
<P>
	   A responsibility that, many in New Hampshire say, requires more
contemplation this year.
</P>
<P>
	   ``For once, we have some quality people running on either side, which I
think we haven't had in a long time,'' said Norm Wilson, 80, a retired engineer
and Republican-leaning independent who lives in a Concord retirement community.
</P>
<P>
	   ``For once,'' he said, ``we have some choices.''

<HEADLINE> NYC Names Interim Schools Chancellor  </HEADLINE>
   By MELANIE CARROLL Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   NEW YORK (AP) -- A bank executive on the state Board of Regents was named
interim chancellor for the nation's largest school district Sunday.
</P>
<P>
	   The Board of Education voted 4-3 Sunday night to install Citigroup executive
Harold Levy to lead the 1.1 million-student district until a permanent
chancellor can be hired.
</P>
<P>
	   He still needs the state education commissioner's blessing, and he wasn't
the mayor's choice.
</P>
<P>
	   Since Levy, a lawyer, doesn't have an education degree as state law
requires, the state education commissioner will have to issue a waiver first --
a move that could take up to two weeks.
</P>
<P>
	   ``My goal is to focus relentlessly on improving learning for students,''
Levy said in a statement released after the vote Sunday.
</P>
<P>
	   Levy, who was educated in New York City schools, is director of global
compliance at Citigroup. In 1995, he headed a commission that found school
facilities to be in dire physical condition.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Having a business person at the helm will be a big departure for the
school system,'' United Federation of Teachers President Randi Weingarten said
Sunday, but added that the teachers and union are ready to cooperate with Levy.
</P>
<P>
	   Former Chancellor Rudy Crew, whose contract the board voted 4-3 not to renew
last month, left Thursday to direct a new leadership institute for school
principals and superintendents at the University of Washington.
</P>
<P>
	   The same swing vote that ousted Crew, who had been at odds with the mayor,
and chose Levy was Terri Thomson. She said she voted for Levy because he would
continue to work to end social promotion.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The swing vote here opted not for the best-qualified candidate but the
candidate strongly supported by the unions,'' Mayor Rudolph Giuliani said in a
statement Sunday.
</P>
<P>
	   The mayor supported Bob Kiley, a former head of the Metropolitan
Transportation Authority and the board's other top candidate for the post.

<HEADLINE> Elian Gonzalez Protests Suspended  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   MIAMI (AP) -- Six-year-old Elian Gonzalez and his relatives watched a parade
Sunday as citywide protests over plans to send him back to Cuba remained on
hold.
</P>
<P>
	   The parade celebrated Three Kings Day, a religious holiday commemorating the
three kings who were said to have traveled to Bethlehem bearing gifts for the
Christ child. It is traditionally celebrated in Hispanic nations.
</P>
<P>
	   Elian sat beneath a multi-colored umbrella with his relatives. They sat in
bleachers facing the parade route, which ran down Calle Ocho, the main street in
the city's Little Havana neighborhood.
</P>
<P>
	   Elian at times waved at the procession, a Cuban flag in one hand, and a U.S.
flag in the other. Mostly, the boy shot streams of colorful foamy string from a
can.
</P>
<P>
	   ``It was a nice day to get him away from the routine,'' said Armando
Gutierrez, the family's spokesman. ``He saw things he never saw in his life.
Things that if he was sent back to Cuba he will never see again.''
</P>
<P>
	   The parade was a welcome celebration for the city, which earlier in the week
was beset by protests and traffic slowdowns incited by anti-Castro groups angry
over a federal decision to send the 6-year-old boy back to his father in Cuba.
</P>
<P>
	   But the city was quiet Sunday, a day after Cuban-American leaders issued a
temporary halt to the demonstrations. The leaders were encouraged by a
lawmaker's bid to keep Elian in the United States while a judge considers his
case.
</P>
<P>
	   The U.S. Immigration and Naturalization Service said last week the boy
should be sent back to Cuba by Jan. 14. President Clinton and Attorney General
Janet Reno have both indicated support for the ruling.
</P>
<P>
	   Rep. Dan Burton, R-Ind., on Friday issued a subpoena to have the boy testify
before a House committee Feb. 10, which likely delays the return of the boy.
</P>
<P>
	   Speaking Sunday on ABC's ``This Week,'' Burton reaffirmed that his subpoena
does have the force of bringing a person before his committee.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Now whether or not the INS will say that that does not supersede their
authority as a branch -- part of the executive branch -- to send that young man
back, that's something that we're not sure of,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
	   Elian was found Thanksgiving Day clinging to an inner tube after his mother,
stepfather and others drowned attempting to reach the United States.

<HEADLINE> Dolphins 20, Seahawks 17  </HEADLINE>
    By DAVE GOLDBERG AP Football Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   SEATTLE (AP) -- For Dan Marino and the Miami Dolphins, there apparently is
nothing like a 3,000-mile road trip.
</P>
<P>
	   The Dolphins won their first playoff road game in 28 years by beating the
Seattle Seahawks 20-17 Sunday as the NFL's 38-year-old career passing leader,
playing in the shadow of speculation he is about to retire, pulled off some of
his old magic and the defense returned to its early-season form.
</P>
<P>
	   "It's a big win for this team to come all the way to Seattle and play in
front of a hostile crowd," said Marino, who engineered an 11-play, 85-yard drive
capped by J.J. Johnson's 2-yard run for the winning score with 4:48 left.
</P>
<P>
	   "It's as loud as it gets here in the Kingdome. We just had to be patient."
</P>
<P>
	   Marino was at his best on that drive, going 4-for-7 for 84 yards, including
completions of 23 yards to Tony Martin on third-and-12 from his 13, and a
24-yard third-down completion to Oronde Gadsden at the 5-yard line that set up
Johnson's game-winner.
</P>
<P>
	   "Dan did a great job of executing the plan, he did a great job of throwing
the ball," said coach Jimmy Johnson, who hasn't been on great terms with Marino
for much of this year.
</P>
<P>
	   Marino's counterpart is now rooting for him, too.
</P>
<P>
	   " Now that it's over for us, maybe Dan will get the Super Bowl ring he
deserves to cap off a great career," said Seattle quarterback Jon Kitna. "He did
what he had to do, particularly in the fourth quarter. He made some great
throws.
</P>
<P>
	   It was the 37th fourth-quarter comeback of Marino's career, second only to
John Elway, and it sent the Dolphins (10-7) to Jacksonville for a second-round
AFC playoff game with the Jaguars next Saturday. Tennessee will be at
Indianapolis in the other AFC game Sunday.
</P>
<P>
	   Marino, who was 17-of-30 for 196 yards and had a 1-yard TD pass to Gadsden,
didn't do it alone as Miami won on the road in the playoffs for the first time
since a victory in Pittsburgh in 1972.
</P>
<P>
	   The defense sacked Jon Kitna six times, three by Trace Armstrong, and held
the Seahawks to just 171 yards, 32 in the second half. Two of Armstrong's sacks
came on one series after the go-ahead TD, and Armstrong almost got a fourth --
Kitna got a 1-yard gain, so it wasn't a sack.
</P>
<P>
	   "I've had a bunch of twos," the 34-year-old Armstrong said. "But not many
like this."
</P>
<P>
	   This game was hard work for both struggling teams -- like Miami, Seattle
lost five of its last six regular-season games. It backed into the AFC West
title and was struggling on offense coming in.
</P>
<P>
	   Seattle's biggest play was by the special teams, an 85-yard kickoff return
by rookie Charlie Rogers after Marino's pass to Gadsden tied the game at 10 in
the third quarter. Even that was flawed -- Rogers bobbled the ball before
picking it up and racing for the touchdown.
</P>
<P>
	   Johnson thought the aftermath of the return was the key for the Dolphins.
</P>
<P>
	   "It's not the bad thing that get you beat, it's how you react to bad
things.," Johnson said. "We worked hard to tie the game and then they go right
back up on the kickoff return. Our guys could have very well crumbled at that
time. Instead, I think they showed what's inside them."
</P>
<P>
	   Seattle coach Mike Holmgren suggested the kickoff and an onside kick
recovered by Miami cooled off the offense.
</P>
<P>
	   "We only had three offensive snaps in the third quarter," he said. "It was
hard to get back momentum."
</P>
<P>
	   All this overshadowed the pre-game speculation about Marino, 4-6 in 10
starts in the regular season.
</P>
<P>
	   This game also might have prolonged the coaching career of Johnson, who
stepped down for 12 hours a year ago before reconsidering and reportedly is
thinking of doing the same this year.
</P>
<P>
	   Seattle led 10-3 at halftime as its defense limited the Dolphins to 69
yards.
</P>
<P>
	   The Seahawks scored on their second possession on a 9-yard pass from Kitna
to Sean Dawkins at the end of an eight-play, 47-yard drive.
</P>
<P>
	   Miami's only first-half scoring drive resulted in a 32-yard field goal by
Olindo Mare after Johnson declined to go for a first down on fourth-and-1 at the
Seattle 13.
</P>
<P>
	   Todd Peterson's 50-yarder with 45 seconds before intermission was the other
Seattle score.
</P>
<P>
	   But Miami opened the second half by almost doubling its yardage output,
going 60 yards in 10 plays, capped by Marino's 1-yard TD pass to Gadsden.
Marino, who was just 5-of-8 for 28 yards in the first half, was 6-of-6 for 55
yards on the drive.
</P>
<P>
	   Then came Rogers' return, which stood up until Marino demonstrated his old
magic.
</P>
<P>
	   That was good enough for Johnson.
</P>
<P>
	   "One road win in the playoffs after you haven't done that for 28 years goes
a long way," Johnson said.
</P>
<P>
	   So does one aged quarterback.
</P>
<P>
	   "Dan is a legend in this game," Armstrong said. "No one is more respected or
loved on this team than Dan. It was great for him to have a great day."

<HEADLINE> Tour Championship Returning To End  </HEADLINE>
    By DOUG FERGUSON AP Golf Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   KAPALUA, Hawaii (AP) -- The Tour Championship will return to its traditional
place on the schedule as the final official event of the PGA Tour in 2001,
commissioner Tim Finchem said Sunday in announcing minor changes to the World
Golf Championship series.
</P>
<P>
	   The Tour Championship, for only the top 30 on the money list, had been the
final event since its inception in 1987.
</P>
<P>
	   That changed a year ago when the American Express Championship, the last of
three $5 million WGC events, was played at Valderrama in southern Spain a week
after the Tour Championship.
</P>
<P>
	   It also came a week after the Volvo Masters, the traditional season-ender on
the European tour. Players on both sides of the Atlantic complained, saying that
an American could decide the winner of European money list, and vice-versa.
</P>
<P>
	   "It allows us to bring an end to the World Golf Championship series in a
more definable way," Finchem said. "I think that was borne out that week. It
makes sense to leave the season finale to the Tour Championship, which seems to
have gotten more and more strength to it."
</P>
<P>
	   The American Express Championship, for the top 50 in the world and the
leaders on five world tour's money lists, will follow the Tour Championship
again this year.
</P>
<P>
	   Finchem said the 2001 American Express will be played in the United States
sometime in September, sandwiched around the Ryder Cup in England. The
tournament alternates between America and Europe.
</P>
<P>
	   Finchem also said moving up the last official WGC event will give the tour
more options where to play it.
</P>
<P>
	   "In the U.S., it gives us virtually every place to play," he said. "Even
though Valderrama was a great test and we look forward to 2000, when we go back
in '02, it lets us look at Scotland and Ireland, which is where we'd like to be
the next time."
</P>
<P>
	   As for the Match Play Championship in February, Finchem said the
quarterfinals and semifinals will be played Saturday, with the 36-hole final
Sunday.
</P>
<P>
	   In the inaugural event, the round of 16 and the quarterfinals were played
Friday, with only the 18-hole semifinals played on Saturday.

<HEADLINE> Seahawks Still Have Playoff Drought  </HEADLINE>
    By JIM COUR AP Sports Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   SEATTLE (AP) -- After such a promising start for the Seattle Seahawks, the
finish to their first season under Mike Holmgren was so disappointing.
</P>
<P>
	   The Seahawks made it to the playoffs for the first time in 11 years in
Holmgren's initial season, but remained winless in the postseason since 1984.
</P>
<P>
	   Dan Marino and the Miami Dolphins ended the Seahawks' season by coming up
with a touchdown in the final 4:48 for a 20-17 victory Sunday. The AFC West
champions' season ended with losses in six of their last seven games following
an 8-2 start.
</P>
<P>
	   "We had difficulties running the football and we had difficulties with our
pass protection," said Holmgren, who extended his playoff streak as a head coach
to seven straight seasons. "We didn't do a very good job. We just couldn't get
anything going."
</P>
<P>
	   So lucky on the final day of the regular season when they lost to the New
York Jets and still advanced, the Seahawks gave up an 11-play, 85-yard touchdown
drive that cost them a playoff trip to Indianapolis next Sunday.
</P>
<P>
	   J.J. Johnson's 2-yard run put the Dolphins ahead. Marino, Miami's
38-year-old quarterback, was 4-for-7 for 84 yards on the march.
</P>
<P>
	   "He's pretty good," Holmgren said.
</P>
<P>
	   "He's a Hall of Famer," strong safety Darryl Williams added. "It's very
disappointing, but we can't hold our heads down. Except for that last drive, we
did a pretty good job against him."
</P>
<P>
	   "Our job is to stop people and we couldn't do it at the end of the game,"
defensive end Phillip Daniels said. "Our offense struggled a little. But it was
a close game. It could have gone either way."
</P>
<P>
	   In the second half, Miami shut down Seattle's offense, holding the Seahawks
to three first downs and 32 yards. For the game, the Seahawks had 12 first downs
and 171 yards.
</P>
<P>
	   The Seahawks got a 9-yard touchdown pass from Jon Kitna to Sean Dawkins in
the first quarter, but that was the offense's only TD in two weeks. Rookie
Charlie Rogers gave Seattle a 17-10 lead with an 85-yard touchdown run on a
kickoff return in the third quarter.
</P>
<P>
	   "I understand I have some things to work on in the offseason," said Kitna,
who was 14-for-30 for 162 yards and one touchdown with two interceptions.
</P>
<P>
	   In the second half, Kitna was 4-for-14 for 48 yards with one interception.
</P>
<P>
	   "The defense played well," Kitna added. "I'm as disappointed as anybody."
</P>
<P>
	   Rogers and the Seahawks thought they had the momentum after his kickoff
return for a touchdown.
</P>
<P>
	   "It felt great," Rogers said. "All the eyes were on us. It felt great to run
that one back, but it doesn't feel so great now."
</P>
<P>
	   Holmgren suffered his first loss in six home playoff games as a head coach
and the defeat came in the Kingdome's final game.
</P>
<P>
	   He promised some changes in the offseason.
</P>
<P>
	   "Now, we have to decide who's going to be with us and who's not going to be
with us," Holmgren said.

<HEADLINE> Marino Conservative Game Plan  </HEADLINE>
    By STEVEN WINE AP Sports Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   SEATTLE (AP) -- Dan Marino won Sunday by playing exactly the way Jimmy
Johnson wants.
</P>
<P>
	   There was no sign of the simmering discord between quarterback and coach.
They agreed upon the conservative offensive approach that Johnson has long
touted and Marino has long resisted, and the result was the Miami Dolphins'
first road playoff victory in 27 years.
</P>
<P>
	   The most prolific passer in NFL history handed off more than he threw, and
he had no complaints following Miami's 20-17 wild-card victory over the Seattle
Seahawks.
</P>
<P>
	   "We talked about running the ball, and we ran it a lot," Marino said. "We
wanted to play good defense, not turn it over and have a chance to win at the
end. It worked out perfect."
</P>
<P>
	   Miami waited until the final 10 minutes to rely on Marino's magic. With the
Dolphins trailing 17-13, he went 4-for-7 for 84 yards on a drive that produced
the decisive touchdown.
</P>
<P>
	   Defense took over from there. Miami gave up only 32 yards in the second
half, and the Dolphins advanced to round two of the playoffs. They'll play
Saturday at Jacksonville.
</P>
<P>
	   Marino and Johnson have clashed this season over the quarterback's play,
fueling speculation that both will retire after this season.
</P>
<P>
	   "It's not an easy relationship," said Marino's agent, Marvin Demoff, while
watching the game from the press box. "But they can work together without being
best friends."
</P>
<P>
	   They proved it Sunday. Johnson has been especially frustrated by Marino's 17
interceptions this season, but the Dolphins had no turnovers against Seattle.
Miami ran for 108 yards and controlled the ball for nearly 35 minutes.
</P>
<P>
	   Marino finished 17-for-30 for a modest 196 yards.
</P>
<P>
	   "I know Dan probably wants to hang back there and wing it a little more, but
it helps to run for 100 yards," Johnson said. "Dan did a great job of executing
the plan. He did a great job of throwing the ball."
</P>
<P>
	   Marino completed his first pass for 17 yards, but the Dolphins netted just 6
yards through the air the rest of the first half. Miami even ran on third-and-6
at midfield.
</P>
<P>
	   The conservative strategy produced five first downs in the opening half and
a 10-3 deficit for the Dolphins.
</P>
<P>
	   "There were some situations where we could have thrown it more," Marino
said. "But we wanted to wait."
</P>
<P>
	   "We knew we were going to pound and pound," receiver Oronde Gadsden said.
"Then the safeties come up and you get one-on-one coverage, and that plays into
Dan's hands."
</P>
<P>
	   Marino began throwing more on the opening series of the second half, and a
60-yard drive ended with his 1-yard touchdown pass to Gadsden, making the score
10-10. Seattle regained the lead when Charlie Rogers returned the ensuing
kickoff 85 yards for a touchdown.
</P>
<P>
	   With 8:26 left and the Dolphins trailing 17-13, Marino faced a third-and-17
at his own 8. He hit Tony Martin for 23 yards to start the winning drive, then
later hit Gadsden on third-and-10 for 23 yards to set up the final touchdown.
</P>
<P>
	   Marino said he never considered the possibility that the possession could be
the last of his career if the Dolphins were stopped.
</P>
<P>
	   "There's so much going on, with crowd noise and everything, I'm not that
smart," he said. "I'm worried about just trying to win."
</P>
<P>
	   Mission accomplished.
</P>
<P>
	   Marino led Miami to victory after trailing in the fourth quarter for the
37th time. He won a playoff game on the road for the first time. And he's still
in the chase for the first Super Bowl ring of his 17-year career.

<HEADLINE> Timberwolves 123, 76ers 112  </HEADLINE>
    By CHRIS SHERIDAN AP Basketball Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   PHILADELPHIA (AP) -- Terrell Brandon had the first triple-double of his
career and the Minnesota Timberwolves made 15 of their first 17 shots as they
cruised past the Philadelphia 76ers 123-112 Sunday night for their fifth
straight victory.
</P>
<P>
	   Brandon had 27 points, 14 assists and 10 rebounds for his first
triple-double in 574 career games and the sixth in Timberwolves history. Six
other players scored in double figures for the Wolves as Malik Sealy added 23,
Kevin Garnett had 20, Joe Smith 16, Sam Mitchell 14, Anthony Peeler 13 and
Radoslav Nesterovic 10.
</P>
<P>
	   Every Minnesota player who took a shot made at least half his attempts.
</P>
<P>
	   The Wolves put on a shooting clinic right from the outset in building a
20-point lead by the end of the first quarter. Minnesota shot 18-for-22 (82
percent) in the period, with Brandon going 4-for-4, Garnett, Sealy and
Nesterovic going 3-for-3 and Peeler shooting 2-for-2.
</P>
<P>
	   The Sixers eventually fell behind by 26 and didn't rally until the fourth
quarter against the Timberwolves, whose jeckyl-and-hyde season has included 10
wins in their last 11 games following an eight-game losing streak. Their 123
points were a season-high, eclipsing the 114 they scored in Japan in their
second game of the season, and their 64 percent shooting was also a season-best.
</P>
<P>
	   Allen Iverson scored 37 to lead the 76ers, who had their five-game home
winning streak snapped as they lost at the First Union Center for the first time
since Dec. 11.
</P>
<P>
	   Minnesota's hot-shooting first quarter wasn't built on the easiest of
baskets. The Wolves had only one dunk, two layups and two foul shots in the
quarter as they scored 22 of their 39 points on jump shots. A 15-footer by
Mitchell with 30 seconds left in the quarter gave Minnesota its first 20-point
lead.
</P>
<P>
	   Philadelphia was inching its way back midway through the second quarter when
one sequence -- Sealy hitting a jumper after the Wolves' grabbed four offensive
rebounds on one possession -- seemed to sap their resolve.
</P>
<P>
	   The third quarter saw Minnesota go ahead by as many as 26 after leading by
18 at halftime, and the fourth period featured a full-court press by
Philadelphia that got the Sixers as close as nine.
</P>
<P>
	   Brandon ended one Philadelphia run by making three consecutive jumpers for a
115-100 lead with just under five minutes left, then dashed another with a
19-foot jumper that made it 117-106 with 2:54 left.

<HEADLINE> Hurricanes 1, Rangers 0  </HEADLINE>
    By DAVID DROSCHAK AP Sports Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   RALEIGH, N.C. (AP) -- Andrei Kovalenko scored a second-period goal and
Arturs Irbe recorded his 22nd career shutout as the Carolina Hurricanes beat the
New York Rangers 1-0 Sunday night.
</P>
<P>
	   Irbe, pulled in the second period of Friday night's 4-4 tie with Anaheim
after giving up three goals, was sharp this time. He stopped 30 shots for his
third shutout of the season.
</P>
<P>
	   The closest the Rangers came to scoring was when Mathieu Schneider hit the
post to the left of Irbe early in the second.
</P>
<P>
	   The Rangers, coming off a pair of wins over Toronto, couldn't string
together their third three-game winning streak of the season as they played
against one of the teams they're chasing in the Eastern Conference playoff race.
</P>
<P>
	   The Hurricanes, urged this week by coach Paul Maurice to shoot more,
complied for a third straight game. Carolina, which moved back to the .500 mark,
fired 28 shots at New York goalie Mike Richter.
</P>
<P>
	   Kovalenko's goal came on a great individual effort 6:34 into the second. The
left-winger swept in behind the net, and circled into the slot with a New York
defenseman trailing, lifting a high back-handed shot over Richter's glove.
</P>
<P>
	   Gary Roberts picked up one of the assists on Kovalenko's goal to extend his
point streak to eight games.
</P>
<P>
	   The Rangers had scored at least one power play goal in five straight road
games, but were shut out Sunday by the NHL's best home penalty-killing unit.

Israel Makes Promise to Palestinians

<P>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) -- An official close to Prime Minister Ehud Barak on Sunday
promised jittery Palestinians that Israel will sign a framework agreement for a
final peace treaty with them before concluding talks with Syria. Israel's chief
negotiator offered Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat similar assurances, trying
to assuage Palestinian concerns that Israel would favor talks with Syria, which
started last month. The affirmations came as negotiations between Barak and
Syria's foreign minister in a U.S.-mediated peace summit in Shepherdstown, W.
Va. appeared to be drawing to a close without even a tentative agreement.

plans a new TV ad accusing Gore of advocating a policy that would prohibit Colin

features shots of soldiers at work, of Powell and Schwarzkopf and ends with:
"Call Al Gore. Tell him the only litmus test ought to be for patriotism." The

No Word on Buddhist Leader's Location

	   DHARMSALA, India (AP) -- Dozens of men, women and children waited outside a
guest house in northern India Sunday to find out where a teen-age Buddhist
leader who escaped from Chinese-ruled Tibet had been taken. The 14-year-old
Karmapa was whisked away in a convoy of jeeps before dawn. There was no official
word on his whereabouts. The teen-age Buddhist leader arrived at a Dharmsala
hotel on Wednesday, following an eight-day trek across the Himalayas through
Nepal and northern India to escape Chinese-ruled Tibet. It is the most
significant exodus since the Dalai Lama and tens of thousands of Tibetans
departed their homeland after a failed 1959 uprising against Chinese rule.

Mujahedeen Khalq Organization fled after the Saturday night raid on the village
of Chalfra in Ilam province, the reports said. The Mujahedeen Khalq seeks to
overthrow Iran's Islamic government. It has more than 30,000 men and women with

Ultra-Orthodox Rabbis Ban Net Use
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) -- Leading ultra-Orthodox Jewish rabbis have banned their
followers from using the Internet out of concern that Web links may lead them
into the profane. The ban was initiated by leaders of the influential Belz
Hasidic sect in October, and in recent weeks has been endorsed by the leader of
virtually every ultra-Orthodox Jewish sect. The ruling would presumably affect
most of Israel's more than half-million ultra-Orthodox Jews, as they consider
the word of a rabbinical leader to be final.

	   NEW YORK (AP) -- Rock star Melissa Etheridge is ending speculation about the
paternity of the children she shares with partner Julie Cypher. The father is
David Crosby, Etheridge told Rolling Stone magazine in the issue that hits
newsstands this week. Cypher, a filmmaker, carried the children that Crosby
fathered by artificial insemination. Crosby, 58 and the father of three other
children, doesn't plan to help raise Bailey and Beckett -- which is fine by
Etheridge and Cypher.

Dolphins Beat Seahawks 20-17
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
	   SEATTLE (AP) -- Dan Marino pulled off some of his old magic to keep the
Miami Dolphins in the playoffs today with a 20-17 over the Seattle Seahawks in
the final football game in the Kingdome. He did so by orchestrating an 11-play,
85-yard drive capped by J.J. Johnson's 2-yard run for the winning score with
4:48 left. Marino was 4-for-7 for 84 yards on the drive, including completions
of 23 yards to Tony Martin on third-and-12 from his 13, and a 24-yard third-down
completion to Oronde Gadsden at the 5-yard line that set up Johnson's
game-winner.

<HEADLINE> McCain Questions Rivals on Military  </HEADLINE>
   By GLEN JOHNSON Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   GOFFSTOWN, N.H. (AP) -- Sen. John McCain raised the prospect of building a
second canal for transatlantic ocean travel Sunday, but just as quickly the
Republican presidential candidate conceded it would be ``nearly impossible'' to
do.
</P>
<P>
	   Later, in a speech to a state party fund-raiser at the University of New
Hampshire in Durham, McCain questioned the qualifications of the two Democratic
presidential contenders, Vice President Al Gore and former New Jersey Sen. Bill
Bradley, to be commander-in-chief.
</P>
<P>
	   His remarks were in reaction to statements the two have made recently about
gays in the military.
</P>
<P>
	   Gore first insisted in a debate that anyone he appointed to the Joint Chiefs
of Staff must share his belief that gays should be allowed to serve openly in
the military. He later modified his comment, saying he would not tolerate any
commander who would not follow his orders.
</P>
<P>
	   Bradley said at the same debate that a litmus test was unnecessary, because
military officers follow orders from their commander-in-chief no matter what.
</P>
<P>
	   McCain complained about the statements during his speech to the New
Hampshire Republican State Committee, and while speaking with reporters
afterward. He said: ``If anyone imposes a social agenda on the prospective
chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff -- which totally politicizes that job --
then they're not qualified.''
</P>
<P>
	   The Bradley camp was quick to respond, saying their candidate had no such
litmus test.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Clearly Senator McCain's statement has more to do with Republican
presidential politics than with candidate qualifications,'' said Bradley
communications director Anita Dunn.
</P>
<P>
	   McCain made his canal remark earlier in the day in response to a question at
a political forum for high school and college students.
</P>
<P>
	   Speaking with reporters after that appearance, he explained that he was not
advocating building a second Panama Canal, over which the United States just
surrendered control back to its Central American host nation.
</P>
<P>
	   ``If there was some dire emergency that shut down the canal, obviously we
would have to look at other options, but as I said, every option I look at is so
expensive and so difficult that there's very little viability associated with
that option,'' McCain said.
</P>
<P>
	   He added: ``In full disclosure, it would be nearly impossible.''
</P>
<P>
	   The canal comment came amid an afternoon of old-fashioned political energy,
as McCain and some of his fellow Republican presidential candidates took turns
speaking to politically interested youth about the country's future and the
government they will soon inherit.
</P>
<P>
	   High school and college students who gathered at the Dana Center on the
campus of Saint Anselm College squealed upon seeing the contenders and rushed to
grab bumper stickers and other campaign collectables. Freewheeling debates also
broke out in the auditorium's lobby as individuals argued over who was the
better candidate.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We've had a pretty good past. We have to give you a good future,'' Sen.
Orrin Hatch of Utah told the audience in remarks kicking off the event.
</P>
<P>
	   He said part of the way to guarantee that is by selecting judges who have
``good health, high morals and good integrity.''
</P>
<P>
	   Texas Gov. George W. Bush was asked how he would handle the ethical
questions sure to arise from the mapping of the human genome, Bush said he would
convene a panel of top scientists, lawyers and ethicists.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I worry about cloning. I worry about people taking the place of God,'' he
said. ``There are going to be some very thorny issues ahead.''
</P>
<P>
	   Asked whether sex education should be federally funded, publisher Steve
Forbes spoke of his larger approach to education.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I the best education is letting parents decide the best schools to send
their children,'' he said. ``I would trust parents not politics. Let them choose
a school and a program that's right for you.''
</P>
<P>
	   About 500 students attended the gathering, which was organized the Close Up
Foundation, the National Association of Secretary of States, the Library and
Archives of New Hampshire Political Tradition and the state Republican and
Democratic parties.
</P>
<P>
	   Each candidate was given 20 minutes to speak and to answer questions on a
stage sparsely adorned with a stool and an Oriental rug.
</P>
<P>
	   The two candidates who skipped the youth forum, radio talk show host Alan
Keyes and conservative activist Gary Bauer, later delivered speeches to the
dinner at UNH.
</P>
<P>
	   Keyes repeated his anti-abortion views, at one point summing them up by
saying, ``It's not a mother's choice, not a father's choice, not a judge's
choice.''
</P>
<P>
	   In his remarks, Bauer was critical of the violence in society and the
Clinton administration's response to it.
</P>
<P>
	   He said: ``We cannot take this kind of value-free, virtue-free leadership
any longer. My friends, we must get a Republican back in office as president of
the United States.''

<HEADLINE> Britain To Protest Libya Smuggling  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON (AP) -- Britain said Sunday it would protest an attempt by Libya to
smuggle through London components of Scud missiles capable of carrying chemical
or biological warheads.
</P>
<P>
	   News that British customs agents discovered 32 crates of missile parts,
disguised as automative spares, on a British Airways flight destined for Libya
was widely seen as an embarrassment to both countries.
</P>
<P>
	   The find came within months of Britain's restoring diplomatic relations with
Col. Moammar Gadhafi's administration after a 15-year break. For Gadhafi, it
marked a setback in his attempts at rehabilitating relations with Europe and the
United States.
</P>
<P>
	   Foreign Secretary Robin Cook accused Libya of a ``clear breach of the
European Union arms embargo.''
</P>
<P>
	   The export of missile technology to Libya remains illegal under
international embargoes.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We have long had concerns about Libya's ambitions to develop enhanced
missile technology ... we will remain vigilant and alert to frustrate any
attempt to breach them,'' Cook added in a statement Sunday.
</P>
<P>
	   He said he had instructed Britain's new ambassador to Libya, Richard Dalton,
to protest the smuggling of the missile parts, which were found Nov. 24 in a
transit shed at London's Gatwick Airport. Dalton arrived in Tripoli only on
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
	   The government confirmed the discovery of the missile parts after a British
newspaper broke the story on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
	   The Sunday Times said the shipment, found during a joint investigation by
customs and intelligence officers, was sent to Britain from Taiwan in the name
of a knitwear company called Hontex.
</P>
<P>
	   In Taiwan, newspapers also reported that the shipment belonged to Hontex,
and said the company was based in the southern Chinese province of Fujian,
directly across from Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
	   The company is a division of the textile firm Namliong, based in Taiwan's
Tainan County. Namliong executive Wang Chuan-cheng denied that his company was
involved in the arms smuggling, stressing that the firm makes textiles, not
weapons.
</P>
<P>
	   Britain announced in November it would restore full diplomatic ties after
Libya paid unspecified compensation for the 1984 death of a London policewoman
shot by a gunman in the Libyan Embassy.
</P>
<P>
	   Britain resumed commercial flights to Libya last year after Gadhafi handed
over for trial at a special court in the Netherlands two suspects in the bombing
of Pan Am Flight 103 over Lockerbie, Scotland, in 1988.
</P>
<P>
	   The Sunday Times said paperwork seized along with the crates indicated the
shipment originated in Taiwan and that other crates had already reached Libya.
</P>
<P>
	   The missile parts included components of the jet propulsion system for Scuds
with a distance of up to 600 miles, the paper said.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Our investigations into this seizure are continuing and no further details
are being released at the moment,'' the Customs and Excise Department
said.

<P>
    LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Fredy Garcia scored late in the first half as Guatemala
and Armenia tied 1-1 Sunday in an exhibition soccer match.
</P>
<P>
	   The game at the Los Angeles Coliseum included three ejections and five
yellow-card cautions.
</P>
<P>
	   Gagik Manukyan opened the scoring for Armenia in the 20th minute, taking
Aram Hakobyan's back heel pass 40 yards from the goal and dribbling to the top
of the penalty area where he put a shot past goalkeeper Edgar Estrada.
</P>
<P>
	   Garcia took a pass from German Ruano and scored for 25 yards in the 41st
minute, beating goalkeeper Harutyn Abrahamyan to the upper left corner of the
net.
</P>
<P>
	   Both teams were reduced to 10 players when Guatemalan midfielder Julio Giron
and Armenian midfielder Rafael Nazaryan received red cards for a scuffle during
stoppage time late in the first half.
</P>
<P>
	   Giron entered the match in the 41st minute replacing Cesar Corleto, who was
injured in a collision with Armenian midfielder Harutyun Vardanyan.
</P>
<P>
	   Guatemala was forced to play the final 15 minutes with nine players after
defender Mario Acevedo received his second yellow card from American referee
Brian Hall in the 75th minute. The yellow card was Guatemala's fourth. Armenia
received one.
</P>
<P>
	   Guatemala will face Mexico's under-23 national team Wednesday night at the
Coliseum as the opener of a doubleheader featuring a match between Ecuador and
Iran.
</P>
<P>
	   Armenia will face the United States' under-23 national team Sunday at the
Rose Bowl following the U.S.-Iran match.

<P>
    OAKLAND, Calif. (AP) -- John Starks, bothered by right knee tendinitis that
has sidelined him six games, was placed on the injured list Sunday night by the
Golden State Warriors.
</P>
<P>
	   Starks was the second Warriors player to go on the injured list Sunday,
joining Chris Mills, who continues to recover from foot surgery.
</P>
<P>
	   In another move, the Warriors signed guard-forward Jamel Thomas to a 10-day
contract.
</P>
<P>
	   Starks, an 11-year veteran, was averaging 15.1 points in 26 games, including
23 which he started.
</P>
<P>
	   Mills underwent successful surgery Dec. 29 to remove bone spurs from his
right ankle and is out indefinitely.
</P>
<P>
	   The 10-day contract for Thomas is his second with the Warriors. The

<HEADLINE> Bob McFadden, voiceover actor known for Whisk commercials, dead at  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   DELRAY BEACH, Fla. (AP) - Bob McFadden, a retired singer and television
commercial voiceover actor best known as the parrot's voice for Whisk
commercials in the 1970s, has died. He was 76.
<P>
	   McFadden, who exclaimed "Ring around the collar!" And "Pretty shirt!" as the
parrot's voice in commercials for the laundry detergent in the 1970s and 1980s,
died Friday night of Lou Gehrig's disease at his home here.
</P>
<P>
	   "He was a very courageous individual," and dealt with the degenerative nerve
disease with a strong sense of humor, his wife of 48 years, Jeanette McFadden,
said Sunday.
</P>
<P>
	   After serving in the Navy during World War II and working briefly in a
Pittsburgh steel mill, McFadden got into show business in 1948 as a singer
appearing in nightclubs and hotels around the country with acts such as the
McGuire Sisters and Harry Belafonte.
</P>
<P>
	   In the 1960s, he moved to New York and switched to doing voices and
advertising work, providing voices for commercials for Frankenberry cereal and
Pepperidge Farm foods. Other products for which he did commercials included
Mountain Dew soda, Ban deodorant and Chesterfield cigarettes.
</P>
<P>
	   McFadden also provided voices on a number of comedy albums in the 1970s and
1980s, including a spoof on the Kennedy family in the White House called "The
First Family" and ethnic comedy albums such as "The Yiddish are coming!" Some of
that work has since been released on compact disc.
</P>
<P>
	   McFadden, a native of the East Liverpool, Ohio, moved his family to Leonia
in northern New Jersey in 1967. They remained there until 1989, when he retired
and moved to Delray Beach.
</P>
<P>
	   Besides his wife, survivors include two sons, Jeffrey of Delray Beach and
Brian of Palisades Park, N.J.; a daughter, Tracy Huber of Ringwood, N.J.; a
brother, James of Ashland, Ore., and one granddaughter.
</P>
<P>
	   A Mass of Christian Burial will be held 11:30 a.m. Monday at Emmanuel Church
in Delray Beach. Burial services will be held Thursday morning at Madonna
Cemetery in Fort Lee, N.J.

Israel Assures Deal To Palestinians
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) -- Jittery Palestinians were assured Sunday by an official
close to Prime Minister Ehud Barak that Israel will sign a framework agreement
for a final peace treaty with them before concluding talks with Syria. Israel's
chief negotiator offered Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat similar assurances,
trying to assuage Palestinian concerns that Israel would favor talks with Syria,
which started last month. The affirmations came as negotiations between Barak
and Syria's foreign minister in a U.S.-mediated peace summit in Shepherdstown,
W. Va. appeared to be drawing to a close without even a tentative agreement.

Cuban Boy Protests Suspended

	   MIAMI (AP) -- Citywide protests over plans to send Elian Gonzalez back to
Cuba remained on hold today and the six-year-old and his family watched a parade
in Miami. The parade celebrated Three Kings Day, a religious holiday
commemorating the three kings who were said to have traveled to Bethlehem
bearing gifts for the Christ child. It is traditionally celebrated in Hispanic
nations. The parade was a welcome celebration for the city, which earlier in the
week was beset by protests and traffic slowdowns incited by anti-Castro groups
angry over a federal decision to send the 6-year-old boy back to his father in
Cuba.

McCain To Unveil Tax Plan
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
	   GOFFSTOWN, N.H. (AP) -- Sen. John McCain said today that his new tax
proposal will give a tax cut to 25 million Americans, most of whom have lower-
and middle-class incomes. He also said that his plan would allow people to
invest up to 20 percent of their payroll taxes in private retirement accounts,
based on an investment manual provided by the government. Previously, McCain
said the plan would also propose broadening the bottom, 15 percent, tax bracket
to cover a couple's first $70,000 of taxable income. Aides said that if the
federal budget surplus grows even more than projected, McCain would increase the
income range a proportional amount.

Ultra-Orthodox Rabbis Ban Net Use

	   JERUSALEM (AP) -- Leading ultra-Orthodox Jewish rabbis have banned their
followers from using the Internet out of concern that Web links may lead them
into the profane. The ban was initiated by leaders of the influential Belz
Hasidic sect in October, and in recent weeks has been endorsed by the leader of
virtually every ultra-Orthodox Jewish sect. The ruling would presumably affect
most of Israel's more than half-million ultra-Orthodox Jews, as they consider

<HEADLINE> Israeli-Syrian Talks Near an End  </HEADLINE>
   By BARRY SCHWEID AP Diplomatic Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   SHEPHERDSTOWN, W.Va. (AP) -- President Clinton renewed his efforts to push
Israeli and Syrian negotiators toward a land-for-peace treaty with a series of
meetings Sunday evening, but the talks appeared to be winding down without even
a tentative agreement.
</P>
<P>
	   The Israeli foreign minister, David Levy, left for Morocco and a meeting
there with King Mohamed VI.
</P>
<P>
	   The Israeli prime minister, Ehud Barak -- describing the weeklong talks over
territory, peace terms, water and security as complex and difficultv-- was
making plans to depart for home Monday and diplomatic sources said Syrian
Foreign Minister Farouk al-Sharaa was likely to follow on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
	   On the sensitive issue of establishing a new border, once Israel pulls back
on the Golan Heights, Levy said before departing that ``nothing has been agreed
upon.''
</P>
<P>
	   Clinton, who had intervened in the negotiations four times before Sunday,
returned to the site of the talks after nightfall Sunday. ``He's going for
meetings,'' a White House official said. ``The process continues.''
</P>
<P>
	   He met with Barak and then held a three-way dinner meeting with Barak and
al-Sharaa. ``This is an ongoing process,'' White House spokesman Joe Lockhart
said. ``The issues are difficult and complex.''
</P>
<P>
	   Clinton, Barak and al-Sharaa all were dressed casually as waiters served
tenderloin of beef with morel sauce, along with chardonnay and merlot wines.
</P>
<P>
	   Committees met Sunday on all the key issues, and the State Department
spokesman James P. Rubin said the two sides responded positively to a statement
presented Friday by the United States.
</P>
<P>
	   The seven-page document, which is a summary of points of accord and discord,
could become the basis for an eventual ``core agreement,'' Rubin said.
</P>
<P>
	   But he said Israel and Syria still faced ``enormous decisions'' and ``we
don't expect those decisions to be made in a matter of days,''
</P>
<P>
	   American mediators had not offered ``bridging proposals'' designed to close
the gap where the two sides were in disagreement, Rubin added.
</P>
<P>
	   In Jerusalem, Israel Cabinet Minister Haim Ramon said Syria had refused to
permit Israel to retain an early warning station on the Golan Heights once it is
relinquished.
</P>
<P>
	   But, Ramon said, Syria was prepared to consider a station manned mostly by
American and French personnel, with a Syrian presence and a symbolic Israeli
presence.
</P>
<P>
	   Yielding the plateau would strip Israel of a capability to watch any Syrian
military preparations, including tanks rolling down toward the border.
</P>
<P>
	   Barak and al-Sharaa could leave behind experts to continue deliberations.
But Rubin said there was no decision on how negotiations would proceed, although
he said the United States wanted full-blown negotiations to reconvene ``sooner
rather than later.''
</P>
<P>
	   ``There is no doubt that the negotiation is difficult,'' Barak told Israeli
reporters while touring the Antietam National Battlefield, a Civil War site in
Sharpsburg, Md., with Secretary of State Madeleine Albright.
</P>
<P>
	   In his first public remarks since the talks began Jan. 3, Barak said ``the
negotiation is very complex.''
</P>
<P>
	   The prime minister, speaking Hebrew, also gave assurances to the Israeli
public that ``we will not sign an agreement unless, in our opinion, it will
strengthen the security of Israel and address its vital needs.''
</P>
<P>
	   Israel is contemplating a withdrawal from the Golan Heights, a border
highground with a commanding view of Syria, in exchange for a peace treaty.
</P>
<P>
	   Barak, his wife, Nava, and Levy were shown a 26-minute documentary film
recreating the Antietam battle in which North and South suffered 22,726
casualties on Sept. 17, 1862.
</P>
<P>
	   They also listened to a lecture about the blood day from a National Park
Service ranger and Bruce Reidel, who is on the Near East desk at the National
Security Council and a Civil War buff.
</P>
<P>
	   Albright then hosted a luncheon for Barak at Hillsboro, her Virginia retreat
across the border from West Virginia, and returned to the secluded negotiations
site just outside Shepherdstown to meet with al-Sharaa.
</P>
<P>
	   Also Sunday, Al-Hayat, a Saudi newspaper published in London, said Israel
had agreed to pull back to the 1923 border with Syria and that Syria was
insisting on a deeper pullback, to the border that existed at the eve of the
1967 Mideast war.
</P>
<P>
	   Rubin said the account was not credible. He told reporters the newspaper's
report differed in ``substantive ways'' from the document prepared at Albright's
direction and presented by Clinton to Barak and al-Sharaa on Friday.
</P>
<P>
	   In Syria, the state-run Al-Thawra newspaper, said Sunday that the West
Virginia peace talks are ``in serious danger.''
</P>
<P>
	   ``It is clear that there are Israeli directives to ... break up the talks in
an attempt to add hurdles and hamper them to leave the political process
spinning in place,'' the newspaper said in an editorial.

<HEADLINE> Britain To Protest Libya Smuggling  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON (AP) -- Britain said Sunday it would protest an attempt by Libya to
smuggle through London components of Scud missiles capable of carrying chemical
or biological warheads.
</P>
<P>
	   News that British customs agents discovered 32 crates of missile parts,
disguised as automative spares, on a British Airways flight destined for Libya
was widely seen as an embarrassment to both countries.
</P>
<P>
	   The find -- discovered on Nov. 24 -- came days after Britain announced that
it was restoring diplomatic relations with Col. Moammar Gadhafi's administration
after a 15-year break. For Gadhafi, it marked a setback in his attempts at
rehabilitation with the Europe and the United States.
</P>
<P>
	   Foreign Secretary Robin Cook accused Libya of a ``clear breach of the
European Union arms embargo.''
</P>
<P>
	   The export of missile technology to Libya remains illegal under
international embargoes.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We have long had concerns about Libya's ambitions to develop enhanced
missile technology ... we will remain vigilant and alert to frustrate any
attempt to breach them,'' Cook added in a statement Sunday.
</P>
<P>
	   He said he had instructed Britain's new ambassador to Libya, Richard Dalton,
to protest the smuggling of the missile parts, which were found in a transit
shed at London's Gatwick Airport. Dalton arrived in Tripoli on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
	   The government confirmed the discovery of the missile parts after a British
newspaper broke the story on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
	   The Sunday Times said the shipment, found during a joint investigation by
customs and intelligence officers, was sent to Britain from Taiwan in the name
of a knitwear company called Hontex.
</P>
<P>
	   In Taiwan, newspapers also reported that the shipment belonged to Hontex,
and said the company was based in the southern Chinese province of Fujian,
directly across from Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
	   The company is a division of the textile firm Namliong, based in Taiwan's
Tainan County. Namliong executive Wang Chuan-cheng denied that his company was
involved in the arms smuggling, stressing that the firm makes textiles, not
weapons.
</P>
<P>
	   Britain announced in November it would restore full diplomatic ties after
Libya paid unspecified compensation for the 1984 death of a London policewoman
shot by a gunman in the Libyan Embassy.
</P>
<P>
	   Britain resumed commercial flights to Libya last year after Gadhafi handed
over for trial at a special court in the Netherlands two suspects in the bombing
of Pan Am Flight 103 over Lockerbie, Scotland, in 1988.
</P>
<P>
	   The Sunday Times said paperwork seized along with the crates indicated the
shipment originated in Taiwan and that other crates had already reached Libya.
</P>
<P>
	   The missile parts included components of the jet propulsion system for Scuds
with a distance of up to 600 miles, the paper said.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Our investigations into this seizure are continuing and no further details
are being released at the moment,'' the Customs and Excise Department
said.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Army Limits Korean War Probe  </HEADLINE>
   By SANG-HUN CHOE Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   SEOUL, South Korea (AP) -- The United States will not investigate ``every
firefight, every battle'' of the 1950-53 Korean War, despite allegations that
U.S. forces killed unarmed civilians in dozens of incidents, the head of the
U.S. Army said Sunday.
</P>
<P>
	   U.S. investigators are already devoting extraordinary resources to the
allegations of a mass killing of several hundred refugees by U.S. soldiers at No
Gun Ri, South Korea, in the early weeks of the conflict, Army Secretary Louis
Caldera said.
</P>
<P>
	   Since those allegations became public, South Koreans have come forward with
more stories of alleged mass killings of civilians by U.S. troops.
</P>
<P>
	   In an interview with The Associated Press, Caldera said it is not possible
to investigate every incident of the war in detail. He said all loss of life was
regrettable, but emphasized the need to establish whether civilians were killed
intentionally.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The question is not one of going back to try to identify every incident in
which someone claims there was a lost of innocent lives,'' he said. ``If you
begin down that path, you'll never end because all war by definition is
extremely violent.''
</P>
<P>
	   ``It is not possible to go back and investigate every firefight, every
battle, that occurred during the three years of the Korean War,'' Caldera said,
citing the cruel and chaotic nature of war.
</P>
<P>
	   The United States and South Korea began investigating what happened at No
Gun Ri after The Associated Press reported on the incident in September, citing
South Korean victims, American war veterans and U.S. government archives.
</P>
<P>
	   Since then, 37 other cases of alleged killings have surfaced. Some South
Koreans have said U.S. jets strafed war refugees flooding South Korea's roads in
1950-51, and there are demands for compensation.
</P>
<P>
	   Caldera arrived in Seoul on Sunday with a delegation of 18 Army
investigators and civilian advisers. He said his team was making ``very good
progress'' in reviewing U.S. government archives, but he said they had not found
anything ``conclusive.''
</P>
<P>
	   He said the compensation issue will be assessed once the investigation is
complete.
</P>
<P>
	   On Monday, Caldera met with South Korean Defense Minister Cho Sung-tae and
his deputy, Park Young-ok.
</P>
<P>
	   In the AP report, witnesses said a U.S. Army unit killed a large number of
civilians in and near a No Gun Ri railroad bridge in late July 1950 as
retreating Americans struggled to defend South Korea against a communist North
Korean invasion.
</P>
<P>
	   According to declassified documents, U.S. commanders ordered some units to
attack people in civilian garb out of fear that enemy soldiers were infiltrating
South Korean refugee columns. Military law experts say such orders were illegal.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We are also going to show the context in which many of those orders were
given,'' Caldera said. He said the U.S. ground commanders had cleared the areas
around No Gun Ri of refugees and they regarded people located in those areas as
combatants.
</P>
<P>
	   But Koreans victims say U.S. troops guided them out of their village and led
them to No Gun Ri. Then U.S. planes strafed them and American ground troops
machine-gunned people trapped in a railroad underpass for three days, they say.
</P>
<P>
	   U.S. investigators have started interviewing Korean War veterans, Caldera
said. His group planned to confer with South Korean government officials and
visit No Gun Ri to meet 12 Korean victims Monday.
</P>
<P>
	   Investigators do not view No Gun Ri as a criminal investigation, but they
would advise ex-soldiers of their rights if they make testimony that could put
them in criminal jeopardy, Caldera said. He did not comment on whether veterans
could be prosecuted.
</P>
<P>
	   South Korea hopes to wrap up the investigation by May, but Caldera said he
was uncertain that deadline could be met.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We need to take the time that it will take to do a very thorough review to
determine what happened,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> Israeli-Syrian Talks Near an End  </HEADLINE>
   By BARRY SCHWEID AP Diplomatic Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   SHEPHERDSTOWN, W.Va. (AP) -- President Clinton renewed his efforts to push
Israeli and Syrian negotiators toward a land-for-peace treaty with a series of
meetings Sunday evening, but the talks appeared to be winding down without even
a tentative agreement.
</P>
<P>
	   The Israeli foreign minister, David Levy, left for Morocco and a meeting
there with King Mohamed VI.
</P>
<P>
	   The Israeli prime minister, Ehud Barak -- describing the weeklong talks over
territory, peace terms, water and security as complex and difficult -- was
making plans to depart for home Monday and diplomatic sources said Syrian
Foreign Minister Farouk al-Sharaa was likely to follow on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
	   On the sensitive issue of establishing a new border, once Israel pulls back
on the Golan Heights, Levy said before departing that ``nothing has been agreed
upon.''
</P>
<P>
	   Clinton, who had intervened in the negotiations four times before Sunday,
returned to the site of the talks after nightfall Sunday. ``He's going for
meetings,'' a White House official said. ``The process continues.''
</P>
<P>
	   He met with Barak and then held a three-way dinner meeting with Barak and
al-Sharaa. ``This is an ongoing process,'' White House spokesman Joe Lockhart
said. ``The issues are difficult and complex.''
</P>
<P>
	   A source close to the Syrian delegation said the focus of the working dinner
would be the seven-page document, which is a summary of points of accord and
discord, that Clinton presented to both leaders on Friday.
</P>
<P>
	   The source, speaking on condition of anonymity, said the Syrians have made
revisions to the document that they would bring up during the meeting.
</P>
<P>
	   The source stressed that the Israelis had to accept Syria's border terms,
adding that Damascus would not make compromises on that issue.
</P>
<P>
	   Clinton, Barak and al-Sharaa all were dressed casually as waiters served
tenderloin of beef with morel sauce, along with chardonnay and merlot wines.
</P>
<P>
	   Committees met Sunday on all the key issues, and the State Department
spokesman James P. Rubin said the two sides responded positively to the
statement presented Friday by the United States.
</P>
<P>
	   The document could become the basis for an eventual ``core agreement,''
Rubin said.
</P>
<P>
	   But he said Israel and Syria still faced ``enormous decisions'' and ``we
don't expect those decisions to be made in a matter of days,''
</P>
<P>
	   American mediators had not offered ``bridging proposals'' designed to close
the gap where the two sides were in disagreement, Rubin added.
</P>
<P>
	   In Jerusalem, Israel Cabinet Minister Haim Ramon said Syria had refused to
permit Israel to retain an early warning station on the Golan Heights once it is
relinquished.
</P>
<P>
	   But, Ramon said, Syria was prepared to consider a station manned mostly by
American and French personnel, with a Syrian presence and a symbolic Israeli
presence.
</P>
<P>
	   Yielding the plateau would strip Israel of a capability to watch any Syrian
military preparations, including tanks rolling down toward the border.
</P>
<P>
	   Barak and al-Sharaa could leave behind experts to continue deliberations.
But Rubin said there was no decision on how negotiations would proceed, although
he said the United States wanted full-blown negotiations to reconvene ``sooner
rather than later.''
</P>
<P>
	   ``There is no doubt that the negotiation is difficult,'' Barak told Israeli
reporters while touring the Antietam National Battlefield, a Civil War site in
Sharpsburg, Md., with Secretary of State Madeleine Albright.
</P>
<P>
	   In his first public remarks since the talks began Jan. 3, Barak said ``the
negotiation is very complex.''
</P>
<P>
	   The prime minister, speaking Hebrew, also gave assurances to the Israeli
public that ``we will not sign an agreement unless, in our opinion, it will
strengthen the security of Israel and address its vital needs.''
</P>
<P>
	   Israel is contemplating a withdrawal from the Golan Heights, a border
highground with a commanding view of Syria, in exchange for a peace treaty.
</P>
<P>
	   Barak, his wife, Nava, and Levy were shown a 26-minute documentary film
recreating the Antietam battle in which North and South suffered 22,726
casualties on Sept. 17, 1862.
</P>
<P>
	   They also listened to a lecture about the bloody day from a National Park
Service ranger and Bruce Reidel, who is on the Near East desk at the National
Security Council and a Civil War buff.
</P>
<P>
	   Albright then hosted a luncheon for Barak at Hillsboro, her Virginia retreat
across the border from West Virginia, and returned to the secluded negotiations
site just outside Shepherdstown to meet with al-Sharaa.
</P>
<P>
	   Also Sunday, Al-Hayat, a Saudi newspaper published in London, said Israel
had agreed to pull back to the 1923 border with Syria and that Syria was
insisting on a deeper pullback, to the border that existed at the eve of the
1967 Mideast war.
</P>
<P>
	   Rubin said the account was not credible. He told reporters the newspaper's
report differed in ``substantive ways'' from the document prepared at Albright's
direction and presented by Clinton to Barak and al-Sharaa on Friday.
</P>
<P>
	   In Syria, the state-run Al-Thawra newspaper, said Sunday that the West
Virginia peace talks are ``in serious danger.''
</P>
<P>
	   ``It is clear that there are Israeli directives to ... break up the talks in
an attempt to add hurdles and hamper them to leave the political process
spinning in place,'' the newspaper said in an editorial.

Palestinians Assured Peace Framework
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) -- An official close to Prime Minister Ehud Barak on Sunday
promised jittery Palestinians that Israel will sign a framework agreement for a
final peace treaty with them before concluding talks with Syria. The
affirmations came as negotiations between Barak and Syria's foreign minister in
a U.S.-mediated peace summit in Shepherdstown, W. Va. appeared to be ending
without even a tentative agreement. Barak, describing the weeklong talks over
territory, peace terms, water and security as complex and difficult, planned to
return home Monday. Syrian Foreign Minister Farouk al-Sharaa was likely to

	   GOFFSTOWN, N.H. (AP) -- Sen. John McCain raised the prospect of building a
second canal for trans-Atlantic ocean travel today, but just as quickly the
Republican presidential candidate conceded it would be "nearly impossible" to
do. McCain made his canal remark earlier in the day in response to a question at
a political forum for high school and college students. In an afternoon of
old-fashioned political energy, McCain and some of his fellow Republican
presidential candidates took turns speaking to politically interested youth
about the country's future and the government they will soon inherit.

	   MIAMI (AP) -- Citywide protests over plans to send Elian Gonzalez back to
Cuba remained on hold today and the six-year-old and his family watched a parade
in Miami. The parade celebrated Three Kings Day, a religious holiday
commemorating the three kings who were said to have traveled to Bethlehem
bearing gifts for the Christ child. It is traditionally celebrated in Hispanic
nations. The parade was a welcome celebration for the city, which earlier in the

playoffs today with a 20-17 over the Seattle Seahawks in the final football game
in the Kingdome. He did so by orchestrating an 11-play, 85-yard drive capped by
J.J. Johnson's 2-yard run for the winning score with 4:48 left. Marino was
4-for-7 for 84 yards on the drive, including completions of 23 yards to Tony
Martin on third-and-12 from his 13, and a 24-yard third-down completion to
Oronde Gadsden at the 5-yard line that set up Johnson's game-winner.

<HEADLINE> S. Korea To Buy 100 Israeli Planes  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEOUL, South Korea (AP) -- South Korea will buy 100 Israeli-made pilotless
planes this year to beef up its defense against communist North Korea, the
Defense Ministry said Monday.
</P>
<P>
	   The $52 million deal is part of South Korea's long-term force improvement
program, which puts emphasis on strengthening air defenses.
</P>
<P>
	   The Israel-made ``Harpy'' drones can pinpoint enemy artillery, radar and
missile systems and attack them, said Col. Chung Won-mo, a senior budget officer
in the ministry.
</P>
<P>
	   South Korea also is pushing to purchase Israeli-made ``Popeye''
air-to-ground and American-made ``Harpoon'' ship-to-ship missiles.
</P>
<P>
	   The Korean peninsula was divided into the communist North and the capitalist
South in 1945. Tension between them remains high, with no peace treaty signed at
the end of the 1950-53 Korean War.

	   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) -- A gun battle between security forces and
separatist rebels in the strife-torn Aceh province left at least six people
seriously injured, witnesses said Monday.
</P>
<P>
	   A local journalist said soldiers opened fire on a group of rebels in the
town of Lhoksukon in north Aceh, about 1,100 miles northwest of Jakarta on
Sunday.
</P>
<P>
	   The journalist, who spoke on condition of anonymity out of fear of
retribution, said six people were injured in fighting that started after
security forces set fire to several houses and a marketplace in the town.
</P>
<P>
	   During the clash, three reporters were arrested and beaten by the soldiers
before having all their camera equipment confiscated, he said.
</P>
<P>
	   A military official in Lhoksukon, also speaking on condition of anonymity,
confirmed the firefight and said there were no deaths.
</P>
<P>
	   Aceh, an oil-rich province on the northern tip of Sumatra, is one of several
Indonesian regions where separatists are fighting for independence. Guerrillas
there have been waging a struggle against Indonesian rule since the mid-1970s.
At least 5,000 people have died in the violence during the past decade.

<HEADLINE> Indonesia Refugees Seek Shelter  </HEADLINE>
   By IRWAN FIRDAUS Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   AMBON, Indonesia (AP) -- Fearing a resurgence of the religious clashes that
have claimed nearly 1,000 lives in eastern Indonesia in the past two weeks,
thousands of people fled their homes Sunday and were wandering city streets,
looking for a place to stay.
</P>
<P>
	   Hundreds of soldiers guarded the streets in the divided city of Ambon, the
capital of Indonesia's Maluku province. In nearby North Maluku, refugees
continued to pour into the city of Ternate, fearing violence on surrounding
islands, said Col. Didik Setiyadi, commander of Ambon's Halong naval base.
</P>
<P>
	   But despite the tension, Muslims and Christians in one refugee camp managed
to make a separate peace, at least for a day.
</P>
<P>
	   The thousands of refugees in a camp at the naval base held a dress rehearsal
for a musical performance planned for Monday. The planned concert marks the
Muslim holiday of Eid al-Fitr -- and Christmas, which many Christians could not
celebrate two weeks ago because of the violence.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We all live together in this camp, so we should all celebrate together,''
Annisa, a Christian refugee, said after rehearsing her song. ``I hope this will
lead to peace everywhere.''
</P>
<P>
	   Despite pitched battles in Ambon, the navy has managed to keep things under
control inside the refugee camp.
</P>
<P>
	   ``There are strict rules here,'' Setiyadi said. ``If either the Christians
or Muslims break the rules and fight they are out.''
</P>
<P>
	   In Ternate, the atmosphere was peaceful but tense Sunday as many of the
thousands of refugees walked the streets looking for shelter, said Murid, a
Ternate resident.
</P>
<P>
	   The unrest in Maluku and North Maluku, known as the Spice Islands during
Dutch colonial rule, is Indonesia's worst religious violence since independence
in 1949. It has sparked fears that the world's fourth most populous country
could splinter along deep-rooted religious and ethnic fault lines.
</P>
<P>
	   As Muslims celebrated the Eid al-Fitr holiday week a year ago, a scuffle in
Ambon sparked the violent clashes that have left at least 1,800 dead.
</P>
<P>
	   In Jakarta, Vice President Megawati Sukarnoputri defended herself Sunday
against accusations that she has not done enough to stop the fighting. She urged
people in the region to work for peace.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Community members themselves have to feel that it is their own
responsibility,'' Megawati told the official Antara news agency.
</P>
<P>
	   When President Abdurrahman Wahid came to power on Oct. 20, he made Megawati
responsible for stopping the violence in eastern Indonesia while he tackled the
problems in Aceh, where separatists are fighting for independence. In Aceh,
1,100 miles northwest of Jakarta, two policemen were killed Saturday when rebels
opened fire on a police station, Antara reported.

<HEADLINE> Woods Wins With Spectacular Finish  </HEADLINE>
    By DOUG FERGUSON AP Golf Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   KAPALUA, Hawaii (AP) -- Even by Maui's standards, Tiger Woods is riding an
incredible wave.
</P>
<P>
	   Pushed into a heart-stopping playoff by two-time U.S. Open champion Ernie
Els, Woods kept alive golf's longest winning streak in 46 years Sunday with a
40-foot birdie putt on the second sudden-death hole to win the Mercedes
Championship.
</P>
<P>
	   It was his fifth consecutive victory, the most since Ben Hogan won five
straight tournaments in 1953, and inched Woods a little closer to the record
once thought untouchable -- 11 straight by Byron Nelson in 1945.
</P>
<P>
	   With a spectacular finish to the first tournament of the year, Woods and Els
matched eagles on the 18th hole to force the playoff, and Woods made a 6-foot
birdie putt on the same hole 20 minutes later to keep the playoff going.
</P>
<P>
	   He ended it with his 40-footer on the first hole, stepping off to the side
as it got closer and unleashing a fist pump as it fell. Els tried to keep the
thriller alive, but his 35-footer stopped about a foot short of the hole.
</P>
<P>
	   Along with $522,000 -- enough to move him to No. 3 on career money list at
the ripe old age of 24 -- Woods won a Mercedes SL500 Sport that sells for
$88,000 and a blazer made of cashmere and silk valued at $3,300.
</P>
<P>
	   He also sent a scary message to the rest of the PGA Tour. It will likely
take a superhuman effort to beat him.
</P>
<P>
	   "We were both out there grinding our butts off," Woods said. "To make a putt
like this, that's all you can ask for."
</P>
<P>
	   Els outplayed Woods from tee to green, but missed two short putts on the
back nine that might have sealed the victory before it reached the 18th hole.
</P>
<P>
	   "At least I pushed him to extra time," said the South African known as the
"Big Easy."
</P>
<P>
	   Woods gave Els new hope when he missed the green on No. 17 and lipped out a
par putt. What had been a great display of golf only soared to another level.
</P>
<P>
	   Both players bombed their drives on the 663-yard closing hole, Els a few
yards longer. Woods hit first, a 3-wood that hit softly on the right side of the
green and caught the slope, rolling closer to the hole until it stopped 8 feet
away.
</P>
<P>
	   As he had done all day, Els was up to the challenge. His 3-wood hit short,
bounded onto the green and stopped 6 feet away. Both gave each other a thumbs-up
and a smile as they walked to the green.
</P>
<P>
	   Woods again put on the heat by making his eagle putt, worthy of a trademark
pump of the fist. The Big Easy didn't blink, and rolled his eagle putt on top of
Woods to force a playoff.
</P>
<P>
	   Els again hit the 18th green in the playoff with a 3-wood from 323 yards,
while Woods' approach stayed right of the green. His 60-foot effort came up 6
feet below the hole, and Els thought he had it won until his 30-foot eagle putt
veered off to the right at the last turn.
</P>
<P>
	   Woods made his birdie, then clinched the 16th victory of his young career on
the next hole.
</P>
<P>
	   Woods and Els both finished with a 68 for 16-under 276. Defending champion
David Duval had a 68 and was four strokes behind.
</P>
<P>
	   Woods now has won eight out of his last 11 PGA events, an astounding display
of dominance. It also was the 14th time he has won worldwide when he has had at
least a share of the lead after 54 holes.

of dominance. It also was the 14th time he has won worldwide when he has had at
least a share of the lead after 54 holes.
</P>
<P>
	   Mike Weir made five straight birdies on the back nine and had a 67 to finish
fourth at 285, along with Jim Furyk.
</P>
<P>
	   That Woods and Els were the only players to break par all four rounds was a
testament to their play this week, considering the trade winds out of the
northeast were strong all four days. The winds were tolerable Sunday, and 18
players broke par. Carlos Franco had the best round, a bogey-free 67 that left
him at 287 with Jesper Parnevik.
</P>
<P>
	   But everything gave way to a thrilling duel between Woods and Els, staged on
the hilly terrain above the Pacific Ocean as humpback whales frolicked below.
</P>
<P>
	   Tied at 11-under to start the final round, Els drew first blood with a
5-iron on the 218-yard second hole that stopped 3 feet by the hole for a birdie.
Woods stayed in the game with two crucial 6-footers, one to save par on No. 2
and another on the par-5 fifth for birdie after his approach found the bunker.
</P>
<P>
	   Woods pulled even with a 12-foot birdie on No. 6, but then he three-putted
from 30 feet on the next hole to slip one back. Both missed birdie chances on
No. 8, and both closed out the front nine with birdies.
</P>
<P>
	   Els said it would come down to the back nine Sunday, and he could have
easily backed down from the head-to-head challenge against the No. 1 player in
the world. The South African made only his second score worst than par all week
-- a bogey on No. 10, and saw Woods take a one-stroke lead by making a 5-foot
birdie putt.
</P>
<P>
	   But Els answered, hitting the flag with his his tee shot on the par-3 11th
and making the 2-footer to pull into a tie.
</P>
<P>
	   He also made a nice par save two holes later, but wasted a chance to take
the lead when he missed a 4-foot birdie putt on No. 14, and missed another
chance with a 6-foot birdie that lipped out on No. 16.
</P>
<P>
	   Woods is not interested in The Streak. By his account, it ended with his
four straight to end the 1999 season in Valderrama -- also won in a playoff
against Miguel Angel Jimenez.
</P>
<P>
	   But it will follow him until he loses. The next stop is likely four weeks
away in Pebble Beach, when he starts his West Coast swing that eventually will
take him to the Masters.
</P>
<P>
	   Even in loss, Els proved something to himself. He had said on Thursday that
he wasn't even in the same ball park with Woods. But he outplayed Woods in the
third round to pull into a tie, and went blow-for-blow with under the pressure
of the final round.
</P>
<P>
	   Still, Woods figures to be around to meet any challenge every week. Not only
is he 8-of-11 since June -- a statistic more suitable to free throws than golf
-- he has finished no worse than seventh in his last 15 tournaments.

<HEADLINE> Ecuador Head Fixes Exchange Rate  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   QUITO, Ecuador (AP) -- Besieged by calls for his resignation amid a deepening
economic crisis, Ecuador's president announced late Sunday that he was fixing
the exchange rate to stabilize the nation's plummeting currency.
</P>
<P>
	   In a 20-minute televised address to the nation, President Jamil Mahuad also
said that his 15-member Cabinet had tendered its resignation and that he would
name replacements for the ministers in the coming days.
</P>
<P>
	   A deal had been hammered out with Congress to pave the way for approval of
several economic reforms, he said, including ``the modernization of the state''
-- a term interpreted by many to mean the privatization of state industries.
</P>
<P>
	   Mahuad said he was fixing the value of the sucre at 25,000 to the U.S.
dollar to halt its devaluation, after the currency plunged 20 percent in less
than one week to 29,000 sucres.
</P>
<P>
	   One year ago, the sucre was valued at 7,000 to the U.S. dollar.
</P>
<P>
	   Mahuad's announcement came after a tense week of street protests calling for
his resignation and rumors that Ecuador's military was planning a coup.
</P>
<P>
	   The military high command issued a statement Saturday expressing support for
Ecuador's democratically elected government.
</P>
<P>
	   Mahuad said the decision to fix the exchange rate was the result of two
months of government deliberations. Ecuador's Central Bank has opposed the move.
</P>
<P>
	   He warned that he would call a special session of Congress on Tuesday to
fire any Central Bank executives who tried to block the measure.
</P>
<P>
	   For the last six months, the Harvard-educated Mahuad, a political centrist,
has faced increasing calls to step down from political rivals on both the left
and right, as well as business and labor leaders, who accuse him of incompetence
in handling Ecuador's economic crisis.
</P>
<P>
	   Several leftist-led organizations demonstrated on Thursday in Ecuador's main
cities to demand Mahuad's ouster. Police used tear gas to disperse about 1,000
demonstrators who tried to march on the presidential palace, and the government
called a state of emergency, giving the armed forces authority to maintain order
and detain protesters.
</P>
<P>
	   More protests are planned for this coming week.

<TEXT>
<P>
	   SACRAMENTO, Calif. (AP) -- From swishing a 3-pointer to slamming a backward
dunk after a 180-degree spin, Chris Webber showed off his offensive repertoire
as the Sacramento Kings completed a lost weekend for the Indiana Pacers.
</P>
<P>
	   Webber had 31 points on 15-of-26 shooting and Nick Anderson added a
season-high 25 points as the Kings defeated the Pacers 116-113 Sunday night.
</P>
<P>
	   The Pacers, with the best record in the Eastern Conference, had a seven-game
winning streak when they arrived in California on Saturday. But they lost to the
Los Angeles Clippers that night, and never led after the first 41 seconds of
Sunday's game.
</P>
<P>
	   Webber has averaged 29 points in his last eight games since missing two with
a strained neck.
</P>
<P>
	   Corliss Williamson had 23 points and nine rebounds for the Kings and Vlade
Divac, playing his first home game since shaving off his mustache and beard,
added 16 points. Jason Williams had 15 assists.
</P>
<P>
	   Austin Croshere had 22 points and Travis Best added 16 of his 20 points in
the fourth quarter for Indiana. But Reggie Miller was held to just six points in
the second half after scoring 13 in the first two periods.
</P>
<P>
	   The Pacers' reserves, including Croshere and Best, outscored the Kings'
second stringers 59-15.
</P>
<P>
	   Leading by 11 points at halftime, the Kings extended their lead to 16 twice
early in the opening minutes of the third period and led 90-77 entering the
fourth quarter.
</P>
<P>
	   Best then went on a tear, scoring seven points in 73 seconds -- including a
three-point play with 5:05 remaining to pull the Pacers within 103-97. But
Williamson and Divac then hit shots to kill the rally.
</P>
<P>
	   Webber had 19 points, including a 3-pointer, and the Kings shot 57 percent
while taking a 65-54 halftime lead. Sacramento scored the last seven points of
the half, including a 3-pointer by Anderson with 1.4 seconds left.

Peace Framework Assured to Palestinians
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) -- Israel will sign a framework agreement for a final peace
treaty with them before concluding talks with Syria, an official close to Prime
Minister Ehud Barak on Sunday. The announcement came as negotiations between
Barak and Syria's foreign minister in a U.S.-mediated peace summit in
Shepherdstown, W. Va. appeared to be ending without even a tentative agreement.
Barak, describing the weeklong talks over territory, peace terms, water and
security as complex and difficult, planned to return home Monday. Syrian Foreign
Minister Farouk al-Sharaa was likely to follow on Tuesday, diplomatic sources
said.

Korean War Probe Limited by Army

	   SEOUL, South Korea (AP) -- The United States will not investigate every
battle of the 1950-53 Korean War, despite allegations that U.S. forces killed
unarmed civilians in dozens of incidents. In an interview with The Associated
Press, Army Secretary Louis Caldera said it is not possible to investigate every
incident of the war in detail. U.S. investigators are already devoting
extraordinary resources to the allegations of a mass killings by U.S. soldiers
at No Gun Ri, South Korea, in the early weeks of the conflict.

Six Injured in Aceh Violence

<P>
	   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) -- A gun battle between security forces and
separatist rebels in the strife-torn Aceh province left at least six people
seriously injured, witnesses said Monday. During the clash, three reporters were
arrested and beaten by the soldiers before having all their camera equipment
confiscated. Aceh, an oil-rich province on the northern tip of Sumatra, is one
of several Indonesian regions where separatists are fighting for independence.
Guerrillas there have been waging a struggle against Indonesian rule since the
mid-1970s. At least 5,000 people have died in the violence during the past
decade.

Britain To Protest Libya Smuggling
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
	   LONDON (AP) -- Britain said Sunday it would protest an attempt by Libya to
smuggle through London components of Scud missiles capable of carrying chemical
or biological warheads. News that British customs agents discovered 32 crates of
missile parts, disguised as automative spares, on a British Airways flight
destined for Libya was widely seen as an embarrassment to both countries. The
find -- discovered on Nov. 24 -- came days after Britain announced that it was
restoring diplomatic relations with Col. Moammar Gadhafi's administration after
a 15-year break.

Cuban Boy Protests Suspended

	   MIAMI (AP) -- Citywide protests over plans to send Elian Gonzalez back to
Cuba remained on hold Sunday and the six-year-old and his family watched a
parade in Miami. The parade celebrated Three Kings Day, a religious holiday
commemorating the three kings who were said to have traveled to Bethlehem
bearing gifts for the Christ child. The parade was a welcome celebration for the
city, which earlier in the week was beset by protests and traffic slowdowns
incited by anti-Castro groups angry over a federal decision to send the
6-year-old boy back to his father in Cuba.

S. Korea To Buy 100 Israeli Planes
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
	   SEOUL, South Korea (AP) -- South Korea will buy 100 Israeli-made pilotless
planes this year to beef up its defense against communist North Korea, the
Defense Ministry said Monday. The $52 million deal is part of South Korea's
long-term force improvement program, which puts emphasis on strengthening air
defenses. The Korean peninsula was divided into the communist North and the
capitalist South in 1945. Tension between them remains high, with no peace
treaty signed at the end of the 1950-53 Korean War.

Woods Wins With Spectacular Finish
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
	   KAPALUA, Hawaii (AP) -- Tiger Woods kept alive golf's longest winning streak
in 46 years Sunday with a 40-foot birdie putt on the second sudden-death hole to
win the Mercedes Championship. It was his fifth consecutive victory, the most
since Ben Hogan won five straight tournaments in 1953, and inched Woods a little
closer to the record once thought untouchable -- 11 straight by Byron Nelson in
1945. Along with $522,000 -- enough to move him to No. 3 on career money list at
the ripe old age of 24 -- Woods won a Mercedes SL500 Sport that sells for
$88,000 and a blazer made of cashmere and silk valued at $3,300.

<HEADLINE> Israeli-Syrian Talks Near an End  </HEADLINE>
   By BARRY SCHWEID AP Diplomatic Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   SHEPHERDSTOWN, W.Va. (AP) -- President Clinton renewed his efforts to push
Israeli and Syrian negotiators toward a land-for-peace treaty with a series of
meetings Sunday evening, but the talks appeared to be winding down without even
a tentative agreement.
</P>
<P>
	   A White House spokesman, Mike Hammer, said after Clinton had met for 2 1/2
hours with Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak and Syrian Foreign Minister Faoruk
al-Sharaa that ``no decision has been made whether the president will come back
tomorrow.''
</P>
<P>
	   The Israeli foreign minister, David Levy, left for Morocco and a meeting
there with King Mohamed VI.
</P>
<P>
	   Barak, describing the weeklong talks over territory, peace terms, water and
security as complex and difficult, was making plans to depart for home Monday
and diplomatic sources said al-Sharaa was likely to follow on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
	   On the sensitive issue of establishing a new border, once Israel pulls back
on the Golan Heights, Levy said before departing that ``nothing has been agreed
upon.''
</P>
<P>
	   Clinton, who had intervened in the negotiations four times before Sunday,
returned to the site of the talks after nightfall Sunday. ``He's going for
meetings,'' a White House official said. ``The process continues.''
</P>
<P>
	   He met with Barak and then held a three-way dinner meeting with Barak and
al-Sharaa. ``This is an ongoing process,'' White House spokesman Joe Lockhart
said. ``The issues are difficult and complex.''
</P>
<P>
	   A source close to the Syrian delegation said the focus of the working dinner
would be the seven-page document, which is a summary of points of accord and
discord, that Clinton presented to both leaders on Friday.
</P>
<P>
	   The source, speaking on condition of anonymity, said the Syrians have made
revisions to the document that they would bring up during the meeting.
</P>
<P>
	   The source stressed that the Israelis had to accept Syria's border terms,
adding that Damascus would not make compromises on that issue.
</P>
<P>
	   Clinton, Barak and al-Sharaa all were dressed casually as waiters served
tenderloin of beef with morel sauce, along with chardonnay and merlot wines.
</P>
<P>
	   Committees met Sunday on all the key issues, and the State Department
spokesman James P. Rubin said the two sides responded positively to the
statement presented Friday by the United States.
</P>
<P>
	   The document could become the basis for an eventual ``core agreement,''
Rubin said.
</P>
<P>
	   But he said Israel and Syria still faced ``enormous decisions'' and ``we
don't expect those decisions to be made in a matter of days,''
</P>
<P>
	   American mediators had not offered ``bridging proposals'' designed to close
the gap where the two sides were in disagreement, Rubin added.
</P>
<P>
	   In Jerusalem, Israel Cabinet Minister Haim Ramon said Syria had refused to
permit Israel to retain an early warning station on the Golan Heights once it is
relinquished.
</P>
<P>
	   But, Ramon said, Syria was prepared to consider a station manned mostly by
American and French personnel, with a Syrian presence and a symbolic Israeli
presence.
</P>
<P>
	   Yielding the plateau would strip Israel of a capability to watch any Syrian
military preparations, including tanks rolling down toward the border.
</P>
<P>
	   Barak and al-Sharaa could leave behind experts to continue deliberations.
But Rubin said there was no decision on how negotiations would proceed, although
he said the United States wanted full-blown negotiations to reconvene ``sooner
rather than later.''
</P>
<P>
	   ``There is no doubt that the negotiation is difficult,'' Barak told Israeli
reporters while touring the Antietam National Battlefield, a Civil War site in
Sharpsburg, Md., with Secretary of State Madeleine Albright.
</P>
<P>
	   In his first public remarks since the talks began Jan. 3, Barak said ``the
negotiation is very complex.''
</P>
<P>
	   The prime minister, speaking Hebrew, also gave assurances to the Israeli
public that ``we will not sign an agreement unless, in our opinion, it will
strengthen the security of Israel and address its vital needs.''
</P>
<P>
	   Israel is contemplating a withdrawal from the Golan Heights, a border
highground with a commanding view of Syria, in exchange for a peace treaty.
</P>
<P>
	   Barak, his wife, Nava, and Levy were shown a 26-minute documentary film
recreating the Antietam battle in which North and South suffered 22,726
casualties on Sept. 17, 1862.
</P>
<P>
	   They also listened to a lecture about the bloody day from a National Park
Service ranger and Bruce Reidel, who is on the Near East desk at the National
Security Council and a Civil War buff.
</P>
<P>
	   Albright then hosted a luncheon for Barak at Hillsboro, her Virginia retreat
across the border from West Virginia, and returned to the secluded negotiations
site just outside Shepherdstown to meet with al-Sharaa.
</P>
<P>
	   Also Sunday, Al-Hayat, a Saudi newspaper published in London, said Israel
had agreed to pull back to the 1923 border with Syria and that Syria was
insisting on a deeper pullback, to the border that existed at the eve of the
1967 Mideast war.
</P>
<P>
	   Rubin said the account was not credible. He told reporters the newspaper's
report differed in ``substantive ways'' from the document prepared at Albright's
direction and presented by Clinton to Barak and al-Sharaa on Friday.
</P>
<P>
	   In Syria, the state-run Al-Thawra newspaper, said Sunday that the West
Virginia peace talks are ``in serious danger.''
</P>
<P>
	   ``It is clear that there are Israeli directives to ... break up the talks in
an attempt to add hurdles and hamper them to leave the political process
spinning in place,'' the newspaper said in an editorial.
