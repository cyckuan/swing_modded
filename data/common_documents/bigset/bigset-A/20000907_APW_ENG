<HEADLINE> Report: Top NKorea Violinist Defects  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEOUL, South Korea (AP) -- South Korea's intelligence agency on
Thursday identified a top North Korean violinist who fled his
communist homeland.
</P>
<P>
   The violinist's defection had been made public last year, it
said.
</P>
<P>
   On July 30, 1999, Seoul's Foreign Ministry said that two North
Koreans including a 37-year-old artist, identified as Kim Moon
Seok, sought asylum in South Korea.
</P>
<P>
   South Korea's national news agency, Yonhap, said Wednesday that
a member of North Korea's national orchestra, identified as Kim
Young Wook, 38, defected to South Korea last July.
</P>
<P>
   Kim Moon Seok and Kim Young Wook are the same person, the
intelligence agency said.
</P>
<P>
   South Korean intelligence usually uses pseudonyms to identify
important North Korean defectors in an effort to protect their
families in their Stalinist homeland.
</P>
<P>
   Yonhap reported that Kim's 36-year-old wife Chang Myung Hwa and
their 8-year-old daughter were also in South Korea.
</P>
<P>
   The intelligence service declined to release any information
about Kim's family, including their whereabouts.
</P>
<P>
   Kim fled his communist homeland in 1996 and defected to South
Korea a year later via a third country, the Foreign Ministry said
last year.
</P>
<P>
   About 400 North Koreans have defected to South Korea in the past
five years. Most have complained about food shortages in the
isolated country.

<HEADLINE> Bush Presses Attack on Gore  </HEADLINE>
By TOM RAUM
<TEXT>
<P>
   INDIANAPOLIS (AP) -- George W. Bush stepped up his attack on Al
Gore's credibility on Wednesday on the stump and in a new campaign
commercial, ridiculing his rival's refusal to debate him next week
on a TV talk show.
</P>
<P>
   ''If we can't trust Al Gore on debates, why should we trust him
on anything?'' asks a narrator in the ad.
</P>
<P>
   The debate ad -- like a GOP ad that questions Gore's truthfulness
-- is part of a Bush strategy to undermine his Democratic
presidential rival's credibility and increase his unfavorability
ratings among voters.
</P>
<P>
   Several Republicans questioned the effectiveness of the latest
spot.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm not sure that's an issue that the average voter cares
about,'' said Timothy Jay Houseal, an attorney in Wilmington, Del.,
who is active in Republican politics.
</P>
<P>
   A Bush strategist said the ad was designed more to capture media
attention and little money would be spent airing it around the
country.
</P>
<P>
   The Texas governor also sought to raise fresh doubts about Gore
on military readiness and began to shift from that issue back to
his original national defense theme of carving the armed forces
from a Cold War fighting machine into a more agile, mobile force
that can fight ''information age battles.'' Running mate, Dick
Cheney, also was discussing military modernization Thursday in
Portland, Maine.
</P>
<P>
   ''We will challenge the status quo and envision a new
architecture for American defense for decades to come,'' Bush told
the American Legion in Milwaukee on Wednesday. ''They must have the
technology to dominate information, as well as the technology
dominate the skies and the seas in order to keep the peace.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore has criticized Bush in turn, saying that the U.S. military
is by far the strongest in the world but that political talk about
weakness can only help potential foes.
</P>
<P>
   ''These are not criticisms of the military,'' the Republican
nominee said Wednesday. ''They are criticisms of the current
commander in chief and the vice president for not providing the
necessary leadership.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush, a pilot in the Texas Air National Guard during Vietnam,
wore a blue service cap from an American Legion Post in Houston.
</P>
<P>
   ''George Bush, Post 77, reporting for duty,'' he told members of
the 2.8-million service organization.
</P>
<P>
   Gore, who served as an Army journalist for five months in
Vietnam, did not accept the American Legion's invitation, citing a
scheduling conflict.
</P>
<P>
   On the debates, Bush said earlier in the day in Milwaukee, ''I'm
still showing up'' at the NBC studio in Washington on Tuesday in
expectation of a joint appearance with Gore. ''I hope the vice
president shows up.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush has agreed to do only one of three 90-minute prime-time
debates proposed by the bipartisan commission that has run
presidential debates since 1988.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, citing offers by Gore to debate him in dozens of other
locations, Bush accepted an invitation for a special evening
edition of NBC's ''Meet the Press'' next Tuesday and for a later
session on CNN's ''Larry King Live.''
</P>
<P>
   The Gore campaign has refused to do the talk show sessions
unless Bush first agrees to the full set of commission debates.
</P>
<P>
   Gore suggests Bush is dodging debates that would be seen by
large audiences. The Republicans suggest Gore's stance shows he is
untrustworthy.
</P>
<P>
   ''When it was politically convenient, Gore said he'd debate
anytime, anyplace, anywhere,'' an announcer says in the new
30-second spot. ''Now that Governor Bush has accepted, Gore says
'unacceptable.'''
</P>
<P>
   Bush spokesman Ari Fleischer said the ad was electronically
shipped to stations Wednesday, although a check of stations in
several states found that none of them had received it yet.
</P>
<P>
   The Bush campaign is spending about $5.5 million per week on
ads.
</P>
<P>
   ''Rather than spending millions on attack ads, George W. Bush
should follow his father's lead and agree to the bipartisan
proposal for debates,'' said Gore spokesman Doug Hattaway.
</P>
<P>
   Fleischer insisted the new ad did not break Bush's promise of a
positive campaign. ''It's accurate. The governor has always been
explicit that credibility was an issue in this race,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats cried foul: ''If you are going to go throwing charges
of credibility around, you better make sure you're credible,'' said
Jenny Backus, spokeswoman for the Democratic National Committee.
</P>
<P>
   During a round of satellite interviews, Gore stood by his
insistence on commission debates, but he added, ''If the Bush
campaign has a problem with a specific format you know, we're open
to all that.''
</P>
<P>
   Green Party presidential candidate Ralph Nader, meanwhile,
complained that both Gore and Bush would ''effectively deny major
third-party candidates a voice in the debates.'' He has sent a
letter to the networks asking to be included.
</P>
<P>
   Trying to stem Gore's recent advance in the polls, Bush
campaigned in four states on Wednesday: Pennsylvania, Wisconsin,
Indiana and Michigan.
</P>
<P>
   At an airport rally in Indianapolis, Bush said Gore would not
serve average Americans. ''Mr. Vice President, you are the
powerful. You've been in power for eight years. You've had your
chance.''

<HEADLINE> Charge vs. Security Guard Dismissed  </HEADLINE>
By ALICIA CHANG
<TEXT>
<P>
   DEARBORN, Mich. (AP) -- In a case that heightened racial
tensions, a judge threw out manslaughter charges Wednesday against
a store security guard accused of fatally choking a black man after
an alleged shoplifting.
</P>
<P>
   The judge said the victim may have died of a heart problem,
rather than asphyxiation.
</P>
<P>
   Dennis Richardson, 29, a guard for Lord &AMP; Taylor, was charged
with choking Frederick Finley, 32, on June 22 after Richardson and
other guards confronted him in the parking lot.
</P>
<P>
   The guards suspected Finley's girlfriend's 11-year-old daughter
of shoplifting. According to police, the guards said Finley threw a
punch and Richardson placed a choke hold on him.
</P>
<P>
   Judge Virginia Sobotka found that the medical evidence was not
sufficient to conclude Finley died of asphyxiation. She said Finley
had an enlarged heart and the confrontation may have triggered
heart failure.
</P>
<P>
   One medical examiner testified that internal bruising and
discoloration of the head and neck led him to conclude Finley died
of asphyxia. But another medical examiner testified Finley died of
heart failure, saying Finley's lungs were filled with fluid, a sign
that his abnormally large heart was failing.
</P>
<P>
   Richardson could have gotten up to 15 years in prison if
convicted.
</P>
<P>
   Richardson is black, as was Finley.
</P>
<P>
   Activists who charged that the confrontation had racial
overtones have staged protests against Lord &AMP; Taylor, accusing it
of having black security guards workers scrutinize minority
shoppers to avoid the appearance of discrimination or racial
profiling.
</P>
<P>
   A day before Richardson was charged, 5,000 to 10,000
demonstrators led by the Rev. Al Sharpton rallied outside Lord &AMP;
Taylor to protest Finley's death.
</P>
<P>
   The company has denied engaging in any form of racial profiling.
</P>
<P>
   Richardson showed little emotion as the judge issued her ruling.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm in shock right now. I'm kind of speechless,'' Richardson
said after the hearing. ''I don't know what to say.''
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutor Kevin Simowski said he will appeal.
</P>
<P>
   Geoffrey Fieger, the attorney representing Finley's family in a
lawsuit against Lord &AMP; Taylor, bitterly disputed the ruling.
</P>
<P>
   ''The actions of the police, the prosecutor and the judge should
be proof enough ... that there is an attempt to protect corporate
interests over those of the constitutional rights of citizens,''
Fieger said.
</P>
<P>
   ''You strangle a man to death and you get away with it. That's
ridiculous,'' he told WWJ radio.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. Attorney's Office and the FBI are investigating
Finley's death for possible civil rights violations. They will
decide whether to bring charges when the appeal of Sobotka's
decision is decided.
</P>
<P>
   ''If the Wayne County Circuit Court does not reinstate charges,
we would then make a decision on whether to bring any civil rights
charges,'' U.S. Attorney Saul Green told The Detroit News.
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday, passersby outside the store appeared divided over
the judge's decision.
</P>
<P>
   ''This case put a black mark in the city of Dearborn,'' said
Bernadette Drennon, 32, who is white. ''I'm just glad it's over
with.''
</P>
<P>
   Joi Cobb, a black social worker from River Rouge, said she was
surprised at the judge's move. ''I think they should have looked
further into it. There should be someone guilty of his murder,''
she said.

<HEADLINE> Yanks' Knoblauch in Starting Lineup  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   KANSAS CITY, Mo. (AP) -- New York Yankees second baseman Chuck
Knoblauch was back in the starting lineup Wednesday night, playing
seven innings in the field in a 3-2 loss to the Kansas City Royals.
</P>
<P>
   It was the first action in more than a month for Knoblauch, who
had been out since Aug. 3 with tendinitis in his right elbow.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm on the right track,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Knoblauch came off the disabled list on Friday. It was his first
trip to the DL in a 10-year career.
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday, he went 0-for-4 at the plate and played errorless
ball in the field, with two assists and one putout, before Jose
Vizcaino entered as a defensive replacement in the eighth.
</P>
<P>
   ''His legs got a little tired,'' Yankees manager Joe Torre said.
''He's not quite in game shape yet.''
</P>
<P>
   Knoblauch, hitting .287 with seven home runs and 22 RBIs, batted
in the leadoff spot Wednesday, with Derek Jeter back to his
customary No. 2 position.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's nice to have it to where I could put Jeter second,''
Torre said. ''I think he likes it better second, even though he'll
never volunteer any of that. I think he's more comfortable there.''

<HEADLINE> Delta decides to scrap Portland-to-Japan flights  </HEADLINE>
By JOSEPH B. FRAZIER
<TEXT>
<P>
   PORTLAND, Ore. (AP) - Stung by low ridership and high operating
costs, Delta Air Lines said Wednesday it will discontinue its last
two direct flights from Portland to Japan starting next April -
ending 13 years of service.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's a very difficult, but very necessary business decision,''
said Mac Armstrong, executive vice president of operations for
Delta.
</P>
<P>
   Delta plans to replace its Portland-Japan service with one daily
round-trip flight to Tokyo from New York's John F. Kennedy airport
and one daily round-trip flight to Nagoya, Japan from Los Angeles.
Delta will also ground the domestic flights that feed the Japan
routes, including a flight between Portland and New York.
</P>
<P>
   Armstrong said the airline has lost $10 million on the
Portland-Japan routes in the past 12 months.
</P>
<P>
   ''We looked at every possible business option to return the
flights to profitability,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Armstrong said problems with the U.S. Immigration and
Naturalization Service, which has been criticized for detaining and
deporting a disproportionately large number of foreign visitors at
Portland airport, were ''not an economic factor in our decision.''
</P>
<P>
   But he seemed to acknowledge that Portland airport's reputation
in Asia - where some call it ''Deportland'' - may have scared off
some travelers.
</P>
<P>
   ''I would comment that the situation certainly was a factor from
a customer service point of view,'' he said without elaboration.
</P>
<P>
   Toyojiro Soejima, Japan's consul-general to Portland, seemed to
put more blame on the INS.
</P>
<P>
   ''We cannot deny the negative influence on the travelers coming
to Portland for either business or pleasure,'' he said. ''The
question is how big a factor it was with Delta.''
</P>
<P>
   He called Delta's decision ''unfortunate'' and ''more than a
little disappointing''
</P>
<P>
   Even if INS' inspectors' reputation for rigidity in dealing with
foreigners at Portland airport had no role in Delta's decision, an
aviation analyst said the airport could lose even more prestige
with Delta scrapping the flights to and from Japan.
</P>
<P>
   ''The main thing it does is give a status blow to Portland and
Delta,'' said Terry Trippler, an airline specialist at
OneTravel.Com in Minneapolis.
</P>
<P>
   Oregon officials worried about the possible impact of Delta's
decision on economic ties between the state and Asia.
</P>
<P>
   ''We're saddened by this,'' said Todd Davidson, director of the
Oregon Tourism Commission. ''Folks have been working hard for 20
years to get nonstop service. This means we'll have to work
harder.''
</P>
<P>
   Bill Scott, director of economic and community development for
Oregon, called it ''a real setback for our developing trade
relationships'' because the flights were bringing Oregon a
significant number of tourist dollars.
</P>
<P>
   Gov. John Kitzhaber said, ''I wish Delta were making a different
announcement today, but I understand and respect the business
decision they had to make and the competitive pressures that forced
them to make it.
</P>
<P>
   ''Oregon's connections with Asia predate this direct service,
and our relationship with Asia will survive its cancellation,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Oregon authorities had urged Delta not to scrap its flights
between Portland and Japan, and had been prepared to offer up to $5
million in incentives to stay. However, Delta has calculated it
could save some $40 million by leaving.
</P>
<P>
   Patterns of flights to Asia have changed fundamentally in the
past few years as a result of the 1997 U.S.-Japan bilateral
agreement, ''reducing the viability of our gateway in Portland,''
said Leo F. Mullin, Delta chairman and chief executive officer.
</P>
<P>
   The agreement allows nonstop flights to Japan from interior
airports such as Chicago and New York.
</P>
<P>
   ''Passenger traffic through Portland had dropped. And there's
not enough local traffic from the Portland area to make up the
shortfall,'' Armstrong said.
</P>
<P>
   He said the economic crisis in Japan in recent years added to
the problem.
</P>
<P>
   Mullin said capacity to Japan has increased by ''nearly 25
percent, but much of the traffic is being carried nonstop from
interior hubs'' and bypassing the West Coast.
</P>
<P>
   The decision to discontinue the two international flights will
lead to a reduction in domestic flights that supported the
Portland-to-Japan service, the airline said.
</P>
<P>
   As of April 1 Portland's domestic schedule will be reduced from
24 Delta departures serving 12 U.S. markets to 15 departures
serving five markets - Delta's hubs at Atlanta, Cincinnati, Salt
Lake City and Dallas/Fort Worth, and one-stop service via Seattle
to Delta's trans-Atlantic gateway at New York's JFK airport.
</P>
<P>
   The decision means a cut in Delta's job force in the Portland
area. The airline will reduce its Portland-are work force to 870
from 1,200.
</P>
<P>
   ''There will be a job in the Delta system for every
Portland-based Delta employee affected by this transition. If those
jobs are not attractive to all who are affected, we will offer
other options to help in the transition,'' Mullin said.
</P>
<P>
   Richard Gritta, an airline specialist and professor of finance
at the University of Portland, said Portland needs a larger airport
if it wants to be a major player.
</P>
<P>
   He said as skies open over China and Russia, distances will
shorten because flights will be able to take ''great circle''
routes without having to skirt national borders.
</P>
<P>
   While this will shorten distances to Asian destinations from
West Coast cities, it also will shorten them from interior cities,
he said, putting further competition on West Coast airports.
</P>
<P>
   Port Director Thorne said he understood Delta's financial
explanation but was disappointed in a decision that turned its back
on a longtime relationship with the Portland community and its
civic and business leaders.
</P>
<P>
   ''My goal is to find someone else to provide nonstop service,''
he said. ''The quicker we move the better. The longer the void goes
unfilled, the worse it will be.''

<HEADLINE> Fair Trial For Berenson Said Tough  </HEADLINE>
By KEVIN GRAY
<TEXT>
<P>
   LIMA, Peru (AP) -- After meeting with Peruvian judicial
officials, a lawyer for the family of Lori Berenson says it's
unlikely the American woman could receive a fair trial in Peru.
</P>
<P>
   ''We plead for a fair trial for Lori -- if, and only if, it's
found that another trial can be lawfully held, which we do no
believe is possible,'' Ramsey Clark, a longtime legal adviser to
the Berensons, said late Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Berenson, 30, was convicted of treason by a military tribunal in
1996 for allegedly helping a rebel group, the Tupac Amaru
Revolutionary Movement, plot an attack on the Peruvian Congress.
She denies the charges.
</P>
<P>
   Berenson's mother, Rhoda, arrived in Lima with Clark over the
weekend, several days after the government revoked a life sentence
handed down by hooded judges and granted Berenson a new, civilian
trial.
</P>
<P>
   But Clark said the trial, which began Monday, had started while
Berenson still was without legal representation. He said the judge
in the case had begun questioning witnesses and had not allowed the
family access to files detailing the charges or any of the witness
testimony.
</P>
<P>
   ''We have a right to be present when the witnesses are being
examined,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Clark said he was petitioning the judge to suspend the trial
until the family had adequate time to prepare Berenson's defense.
</P>
<P>
   Peruvian President Alberto Fujimori has said Berenson's sentence
was overturned because of new evidence showing Berenson was not a
leader of the rebel group known by its initials MRTA, as she was
charged when convicted of treason four years ago.
</P>
<P>
   In a radio interview taped in March 1999 but aired for the first
time early Wednesday, the New York native declared her innocence,
and also asserted a fair trial was nearly impossible in Peru.
</P>
<P>
   ''With ... such negative publicity that I've had in Peru, I
would never get a fair trial,'' Berenson told Pacifica Radio in an
exclusive interview taped while she was held in the Socbabaya
Prison in southern Peru. Last week, she was moved to a
maximum-security prison in Lima.
</P>
<P>
   She said she is ''innocent of the charges they made against
me.''
</P>
<P>
   Berenson's case is now being examined by a prosecutor and a
judge in closed-door hearings that could last up to 50 days. If
found guilty, Berenson would then appear in an open trial before
the Supreme Court, with the burden of proving her innocence.
</P>
<P>
   A conviction of terrorism by a civilian court carries a minimum
20-year-sentence.
</P>
<P>
   Berenson's parents have led a campaign for her release,
condemning harsh conditions she has lived under in Peruvian prisons
and asserting their daughter was never involved in any rebel group
activities, but was instead in Peru working as a journalist.
</P>
<P>
   After meeting with her daughter Wednesday, the elder Berenson
said she found her in good spirits, and still ''maintaining her
sense of humor.''
</P>
<P>
   She also added: ''She is still maintaining her innocence. She
has never been a member of the MRTA and she has never associated
with any terrorist acts.''

<HEADLINE> O.J. Loses TV Injunction  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES (AP) -- O.J. Simpson has lost a bid to block
broadcast of a TV miniseries he claims would reveal his defense
team secrets to an audience of millions.
</P>
<P>
   After reading the script, Superior Court Judge David Yaffe
refused to issue a preliminary injunction Wednesday. The judge said
he was unconvinced the broadcast of ''American Tragedy'' would harm
Simpson because most of the material already appeared in the 1996
best-selling book on which it is based.
</P>
<P>
   ''There's just no necessity'' for an injunction, the judge said,
noting that Simpson can collect damages later if he wins his
lawsuit claiming Lawrence Schiller, who co-wrote the book and
directed the miniseries, and Robert Kardashian, Simpson's former
defense lawyer, violated privacy contracts and published
confidential material.
</P>
<P>
   ''We're very pleased, of course,'' said Gary Bostwick, a lawyer
representing Project 95, the movie's producer, and Schiller.
</P>
<P>
   Simpson lawyer Terry Gross of San Francisco said an appeal was
being considered.
</P>
<P>
   However, both sides admit they are unlikely to get an appeal
judgment before the miniseries' Nov. 12 air date. No trial date has
been set for the lawsuit.
</P>
<P>
   Like the book, the miniseries focuses on the tensions and
strategies of the legal ''dream team'' that won Simpson's acquittal
in the 1994 slayings of his ex-wife, Nicole Brown Simpson, and her
friend, Ronald Goldman. Simpson was found liable for the killings
in a later civil trial and ordered to pay $33.5 million in damages.

<TEXT>
<P>
   SYRACUSE, N.Y. (AP) -- Christina Aguilera isn't coming back -- at
least for now.
</P>
<P>
   The pop star, whose Sept. 3 concert at the New York State Fair
was called off due to laryngitis, can't reschedule another show
into her busy concert plans, promoters said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   ''We deeply regret that a rescheduled show couldn't be fit into
her remaining East coast schedule,'' Ron Baird of the booking
agency Creative Artists Agency said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
   Fair spokesman Joe LaGuardia said all of the nearly 12,000
tickets that had been sold for the show would be refunded at
purchase points.
</P>
<P>
   Aguilera sings pop hits including ''Genie In A Bottle'' and ''I
Turn To You.'' She is scheduled to perform Thursday at MTV's video
music awards in New York City.

<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN DIEGO (AP) -- Woody Williams went 3-for-4 with an RBI and
pitched six shaky innings Wednesday night as the San Diego Padres
beat the Milwaukee Brewers 7-6.
</P>
<P>
   Williams (9-5) scored San Diego's first run and hit a
run-scoring single in the fifth that tied the game at 6. He is
batting .286 (14-for-49) this season with eight RBIs, including
.363 (12-for-33) since returning from the disabled list July 2. It
was his second three-hit game this year.
</P>
<P>
   As for pitching, he allowed six runs and eight hits, walked five
and struck out five. Trevor Hoffman finished with a perfect ninth
for his 38th save in 45 chances.
</P>
<P>
   John Snyder (3-8) was tagged for seven runs, eight hits and
seven walks in four-plus innings. He is 0-6 in 13 starts since June
22.
</P>
<P>
   Richie Sexson was 3-for-4 for Milwaukee with a homer and four
RBIs.
</P>
<P>
   The crowd of 13,777 was the smallest for a game at San Diego
this season.
</P>
<P>
   With Milwaukee leading 6-5 in the fifth, Snyder (3-8) walked
Mike Darr and Desi Relaford, and David Weathers gave up a one-out
single.
</P>
<P>
   A walk to Damian Jackson loaded the bases, and Eric Owens drove
in the go-ahead run with a groundout.
</P>
<P>
   Sexson's RBI single put the Brewers ahead in the first, and his
two-run homer in the third, his 26th of the season and 10th since
Milwaukee acquired him from Cleveland on July 28.
</P>
<P>
   San Diego tied the score in the third when Jackson hit a two-run
homer and Snyder walked Relaford with the bases loaded, then went
ahead 5-3 in the fourth on Owens' RBI single and Dave Magadan's
sacrifice.
</P>
<P>
   Milwaukee retook the lead in the fifth on Geoff Jenkins' RBI
single, Sexson's run-scoring double and Jeromy Burnitz's RBI
single.
</P>
<P>
Notes: Williams also had three hits July 20 at San Francisco. ...
San Diego 3B Phil Nevin left after grounding out in the first
inning with a lower abdominal strain. ... Milwaukee C Henry Blanco
came out after three innings with a right shoulder strain. ... The
Brewers are 6-14 in Snyder's starts. ... The Padres are 7-0-1 in
eight series against Milwaukee. San Diego finished 7-2 against the
Brewers this season and leads the all-time series 18-8, including a
10-3 at home.

<HEADLINE> Pirates 8, Dodgers 3  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Dan Serafini pitched six strong innings
before needing relief help and the Pittsburgh Pirates completed a
perfect West Coast road trip, beating the Los Angeles Dodgers 8-3
Wednesday night.
</P>
<P>
   The Pirates went 6-0, finishing off their first three-game sweep
at Dodger Stadium since 1988 following a three-game sweep at San
Diego.
</P>
<P>
   Pittsburgh's season-high six-game winning streak has come after
a 4-17 slide. Brian Giles had three hits and drove in two runs.
</P>
<P>
   Serafini, winless in his previous five starts, held the Dodgers
to two hits in the first six innings
</P>
<P>
   Serafini (2-3) lasted 6 2-3 innings, allowing four hits and two
earned runs. The left-hander struck out four, walked one and was
removed after giving up Alex Cora's two-out triple in the seventh
and a single by pinch-hitter Kevin Elster.
</P>
<P>
   The Dodgers managed only three earned runs against the Pirates
in the three-game series.
</P>
<P>
   Pittsburgh third baseman Enrique Wilson and shortstop Pat Meares
committed throwing errors on consecutive routine grounders by Jim
Leyritz and Chad Kreuter in the second inning.
</P>
<P>
   The miscues ended the Pirates' errorless streak at a season-best
58 innings, and helped the Dodgers score two runs without the
benefit of a hit after they had fallen behind 5-0.
</P>
<P>
   The Pirates, whose three-run first inning Tuesday night
triggered an 8-0 victory, scored four in the first off against
Ismael Valdes (2-7).
</P>
<P>
   The right-hander was charged with five runs and eight hits in
six innings, and fell to 0-3 since rejoining the Dodgers in a July
26 trade with the Chicago Cubs.
</P>
<P>
   John Vander Wal drove in Pittsburgh's first run with a double,
Wilson and Alex Hernandez added RBI singles and Pat Meares capped
the rally with a bases-loaded sacrifice fly.
</P>
<P>
   The Pirates blew it open in the eighth with two-out RBI singles
by Adrian Brown, Jason Kendall and Giles against Mike Fetters.
</P>
<P>
Notes: The last time the Pirates swept a road trip of at least six
games was 1991, when they were 6-0 on visits to St. Louis and
Philadelphia. ... The Pirates entered the series with a 56-79
record, the worst in the majors. ... Vander Wal, whose 116 career
pinch-hits are sixth all-time, has driven in 60 runs in the 46
starts he has made in RF this season. ... Dodgers LHP Carlos Perez,
1-6 with a 6.43 ERA in his last 15 starts, will miss the rest of
the season and will undergo shoulder surgery next Friday. An MRI
and CAT scan detected a bone spur that had broken loose from the
back of the shoulder capsule. Perez won't be able to throw for 2-3
months, but should be ready for the start of spring training,
according to Dr. Frank Jobe. ... RHP Luke Prokopec, who made his
major league debut Monday night and mopped up with three scoreless
innings in a 12-1 loss, is scheduled to start next Tuesday at
Arizona in place of Perez. Prokopec had planned on pitching for his
native Australia in the Olympics before he was promoted from
Double-A San Antonio on Sept. 1.

<HEADLINE> US Gave Russians Data on Sub Loss  </HEADLINE>
By ROBERT BURNS
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Responding to Russian requests, senior U.S.
government officials provided detailed information about what the
United States knows of the Aug. 12 sinking of the Russian nuclear
submarine Kursk.
</P>
<P>
   A State Department official who spoke on condition of anonymity
said President Clinton's national security adviser, Sandy Berger,
provided some information Wednesday to his Russian counterpart,
Security Council Secretary Sergei Ivanov, during a meeting in New
York.
</P>
<P>
   Also, the U.S. Navy's top officer, Adm. Vernon Clark, sent a
note to his Russian counterpart providing some detailed information
based on acoustical data collected by U.S. ships on the day of the
incident.
</P>
<P>
   Details of Berger's exchange with Ivanov were not made public.
</P>
<P>
   Clark's note, dated Aug. 31, reiterated the American position
that no U.S. ship or submarine was involved in the sinking, which
took the lives of all 118 men aboard, according to a defense
official who discussed the matter on condition he not be
identified. The Russians have said they suspect the accident
resulted from a collision with a foreign submarine, although no
definitive cause has been identified.
</P>
<P>
   The defense official said Clark's note contained no classified
information and responded to a request from the Russian Navy for
any information the U.S. Navy has on the circumstances of the
accident.
</P>
<P>
   Two American submarines were in the Barents Sea when the Kursk
sank, U.S. officials have said, but they insist there was no
collision. The U.S. subs were monitoring a major Russian naval
exercise in which the Kursk was participating.
</P>
<P>
   A U.S. surface ship equipped with underwater listening devices
also was in the area, though much farther away.
</P>
<P>
   Clark's note said the sound of an underwater explosion in the
vicinity of the Kursk was recorded at 7:28 Greenwich Mean Time
(11:28 a.m. local or 3:28 a.m. EDT) on Aug. 12, followed about two
minutes later by an explosion believed to be 45 to 50 times
greater. The second explosion is believed to have been equal to
between one and five tons of TNT, the note said.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. officials have said they believe the most likely
explanation for the Kursk's sinking is the misfiring of one of its
torpedoes. Much of the submarine was immediately flooded, and the
sub fell to the floor of the sea, where it remains under 350 feet
of water.
</P>
<P>
   For several days after the Kursk's loss became known the
Russians insisted that the accident happened on Aug. 13. Later they
revised their version to confirm U.S. news reports that it happened
the previous day.

<HEADLINE> Estate Tax Override Vote Expected  </HEADLINE>
By CURT ANDERSON
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- If they fail to override President Clinton's
veto of a bill repealing estate taxes, House Republicans want to
make sure the vote makes Democrats uncomfortable and underscores
for voters the GOP commitment to tax cuts.
</P>
<P>
   While the House was scheduled to hold the override vote
Thursday, GOP leaders all but conceded it was unlikely they would
get the necessary two-thirds vote.
</P>
<P>
   ''We're hopeful we can get very close,'' said Rep. J.C. Watts of
Oklahoma, the fourth-ranking House Republican leader.
</P>
<P>
   In a 279-136 vote in June, 65 Democrats and one independent
joined all 213 Republicans voting as the House agreed to phase out
inheritance taxes at a cost of $105 billion over 10 years.
</P>
<P>
   While the margin was just over the two-thirds margin needed to
override a veto, Democratic leaders say 11 of their members who
missed the vote support Clinton's action and that at least 10 more
would be persuaded to switch sides.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think we'll sustain the veto,'' Treasury Secretary Lawrence
Summers told reporters, adding that the Clinton administration was
working with House Democrats to shore up support.
</P>
<P>
   Even if the House did vote to override the veto, a two-thirds
Senate margin also would be required and the 59-39 Senate vote to
pass the bill in July was eight short of that threshold.
</P>
<P>
   Although the first $675,000 of an estate is exempt from tax and
only about 2 percent of estates are affected each year, repealing
the tax has grown in popularity on Capitol Hill. One reason is a
forceful lobbying campaign led by the National Association of
Manufacturers, American Farm Bureau Federation and National
Federation of Independent Business. The groups contend the tax is
inherently unfair.
</P>
<P>
   Dan Danner, a senior vice president at the small business group,
said its 600,000 members ''will keep a particularly close eye ...
on those who desert their earlier support of death tax relief.''
</P>
<P>
   Next week, the House will decide whether to sustain the
president's veto of the 10-year, $292 billion marriage penalty tax
cut, for which 53 House Democrats voted.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton has said he would sign less costly versions of both
bills as long as the tax relief is directed more toward
middle-income people. There is some sentiment in GOP ranks to
demonstrate an election-year willingness to compromise, but other
Republicans prefer a clear dividing line on tax issues for voters.
</P>
<P>
   ''We've made the point. We've made the effort,'' said Senate
Majority Leader Trent Lott, R-Miss. ''Unfortunately, President
Clinton continues to talk one way and do something else.''
</P>
<P>
   Summers said the administration maintains that the GOP approach
of passing individual tax cuts that rely on projected budget
surpluses makes it impossible to determine the cuts' overall impact
on the economy and on priorities such as education, Social
Security, Medicare and paying down the federal debt.
</P>
<P>
   ''We need to have a much clearer idea about where we're going
before we're able to make judgments on individual tax pieces,''
Summers said.
</P>
<P>
   There have been nine attempts by Congress to override a Clinton
veto since Republicans took power in 1995. Four have won House
approval and only two -- on budget line-item vetoes and securities
litigation reform -- were overridden by the House and Senate as
required.
</P>
<P>
   ------
</P>
<P>
   The bill is H.R. 8.

<HEADLINE> Better Farming May Mean Safer Food  </HEADLINE>
By PHILIP BRASHER
<TEXT>
<P>
   ST. LOUIS (AP) -- Remember when people ate a burger rare or eggs
raw without a thought to whether it could make them sick? Deadly
microbes that surfaced over the past couple of decades made that a
dangerous thing to do.
</P>
<P>
   But new farming methods and animal vaccines are making food such
as eggs and pork safer to eat. Now scientists are working on ways
to eliminate from cattle one of the deadliest pathogens of all, E.
coli O157:H7, a bacterium that poisons beef and also gets into
drinking water and on crops through manure runoff.
</P>
<P>
   At a government-sponsored conference on food safety, federal
officials said improving farming practices was the most promising
way to prevent foodborne illnesses.
</P>
<P>
   It is ''one of the areas that gets the least amount of attention
and one that is the most important to improving food safety,'' said
Stephen Sundlof, director of the Food and Drug Administration's
Center for Veterinary Medicine.
</P>
<P>
   The time could come when foodborne pathogens ''will be
dramatically reduced'' because of changes in the way animals are
raised, said Catherine Woteki, the Agriculture Department's
undersecretary for food safety.
</P>
<P>
   An estimated 76 million Americans suffer a foodborne illness
each year, according to the federal Centers for Disease Control and
Prevention.
</P>
<P>
   Scientists say E. coli first appeared in cattle in the late
1970s but now shows up in entire herds. It was found in 28 percent
of the cattle entering Midwest slaughterhouses last summer. The
bacteria kill an estimated 60 Americans each year and sicken an
estimated 73,000 more, mostly children or the elderly.
</P>
<P>
   Infected cattle are impossible for farmers and ranchers to
detect. ''There's nothing to see. Those animals are perfectly
healthy,'' said W.W. Laegreid, a USDA scientist based in Clay
Center, Neb.
</P>
<P>
   But research is under way on vaccines that would prevent cattle
from carrying the bacteria, on feed additives that would eliminate
it from the animals, and new methods of composting manure so it can
be used as fertilizer without contaminating crops or ground water.
</P>
<P>
   The new feed additives contain good bacteria that are supposed
to drive the E. coli out of a cow's digestive system, a process
known as ''competitive exclusion.''
</P>
<P>
   Some cases where new vaccines or farming practices have shown
success:
</P>
<P>
   --Improved sanitation practices, including better control of
manure and rodents, on egg farms has been reducing rates of
salmonella contamination in egg-laying hens. McDonald's Corp.
recently announced it is going to ban the practice among its egg
producers of ''forced molting,'' the withdrawal of food and water
that has been linked to higher rates of salmonella.
</P>
<P>
   --New chicken vaccines for salmonella are waiting approval at the
FDA.
</P>
<P>
   --A disease-causing worm, trichinae, was virtually eliminated
from hogs when farmers quit feeding garbage to them.
</P>
<P>
   One pathogen that is unlikely to be affected by changes in farm
practices is Listeria monocytogenes, a bacteria that is common
throughout the environment. It gets on hot dogs and other meat
products inside processing plants.
</P>
<P>
   Consumer activists worry that cost-conscious farmers won't
change farming practices unless the government forces them to do
so. The FDA, which regulates egg safety, is working on new
production standards for farms to curb salmonella.
</P>
<P>
   ''Industry and producers need the government to come in and give
them that mandate ... so everyone is having to make those same
expenses of doing business,'' said Caroline Smith DeWaal, a
food-safety expert with the Center for Science in the Public
Interest, an advocacy group.
</P>
<P>
   USDA, which regulates meat and poultry processors, doesn't have
the authority to regulate how farmers raise their animals. The
department is instead depending on packing plants to demand that
farmers adopt safer production practices, said Woteki.
</P>
<P>
   ''There are many opportunities for contamination to occur and
many opportunities for it to be checked,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Producers would be eager to use an anti-E. coli vaccine or feed
additive if they knew it would work, said Donald Hansen, a
veterinarian for the Oregon extension service. ''When there are
applied methods, they'll jump right in,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Focuses on Asia, Cyprus  </HEADLINE>
By ANNE GEARAN
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- President Clinton turned his attention to
troublespots in Asia and Europe after a day spent mostly treading
familiar ground with Israeli and Palestinian leaders who remain at
odds despite a fast-approaching peace deadline.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton was meeting with a succession of world leaders this week
as a sidelight to the U.N. Millennium Summit. On Thursday, he was
to sit down with South Korean President Kim Dae-jung, and was
expected to press the cause of peace for Cyprus during a meeting
with Turkish President Ahmet Necdet Sezer.
</P>
<P>
   He also was to meet with a panel of African leaders.
</P>
<P>
   The United Nations is sponsoring peace talks aimed at reunifying
Cyprus. The Mediterranean island has been split into a Greek
Cypriot-controlled south and a Turkish-occupied north since Turkey
invaded in July 1974, following a short-lived coup by supporters of
union with Greece. The northern Turkish state is only recognized by
Turkey, which maintains 35,000 troops there.
</P>
<P>
   Greek-Turkish relations have rarely been better than they are
now. Cautious overtures for dialogue were greatly accelerated by
deadly earthquakes that struck both countries last year, bringing
aid and good will initiatives from both sides that helped ease
decades of mistrust.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's meeting with the Korean leader comes less than a week
after he left to his successor a decision on whether to construct a
U.S. national missile shield.
</P>
<P>
   ''There are a number of bilateral and regional issues that will
be on the agenda, including North Korea and the discussions that we
have had with them on both missiles and security,'' White House
spokesman Joe Lockhart said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   The unfinished missile defense business hung over Clinton's
summit meeting with Russian President Vladimir Putin on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   The shield would be designed in part to counter potential
nuclear aggression by North Korea, which technically has been at
war with South Korea for five decades.
</P>
<P>
   North Korea's leader, Kim Jong Il, skipped the gathering of
about 160 heads of state.
</P>
<P>
   China and Russia vigorously oppose any U.S. move to build a
missile shield or even to plan for it in detail. The United States
is already veering close to violating a key arms control agreement,
those countries claim.
</P>
<P>
   Before his session with Putin, Clinton said his decision to put
off deployment of a missile shield created the opportunity for
Putin and the next American president ''to reach a common position.
And I hope they can,'' Clinton added, ''because I think it's very
important for the future that we continue to work together.''
</P>
<P>
   Putin, in his own address to the United Nations, signaled that
Russia would continue to press the United States to abandon its
missile defense ambitions.
</P>
<P>
   Putin urged world leaders to come to Moscow for a conferences to
ban the militarization of space. He described the 1972
Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty as a foundation of the entire nuclear
arms control system.
</P>
<P>
   Republican presidential nominee George W. Bush favors building a
robust missile defense system, seeking Russia's agreement to amend
the ABM treaty but proceeding if necessary without such agreement.
Bush's Democratic opponent, Al Gore, favors developing technology
for a limited missile defense while seeking Russia's agreement to
amend the ABM.

   NEW YORK (AP) -- One small, silent face spoke louder than the
competing lineup of noisy protests ringing out near the United
Nations.
</P>
<P>
   Majak Bak, a 14-month-old boy, stood with his young mother
outside the Sudanese Mission on Wednesday, a tiny and free
dissenter to an ancient scourge -- slavery.
</P>
<P>
   Only a few years ago, Majak's mother said she was a slave
herding goats in the war-torn African nation of Sudan when her
master tried to rape her. She escaped, to her new life in Buffalo,
N.Y.
</P>
<P>
   So as the U.N. Millennium Summit began, Majak and his mother
joined about 60 protesters demanding the arrest of Sudanese
President Omar el-Bashir for allegedly directing his forces to
create slaves.
</P>
<P>
   Through a translator, Majak's mother Abuk Bak said in Arabic:
''I am dismayed to learn that el-Bashir is walking the streets of
New York City, a great city of freedom.''
</P>
<P>
   As many as 100,000 Sudanese are enslaved, according to Charles
Jacobs, president of the Boston-based American Anti-Slavery Group,
which organized the protest.
</P>
<P>
   When Bak was 12, she said, Muslim horsemen galloped into her
Catholic village, ''burned our houses, and killed many people --
including my grandfather, right there in front of my eyes.''
</P>
<P>
   It was 1987 -- the beginning of her decade of slavery.
</P>
<P>
   Bak, now 25, offered her years of bloodied memories ''on behalf
of those who were not lucky enough to escape,'' she said. ''Some
have been killed. Others suffer in silence.''
</P>
<P>
   Sudan has repeatedly denied allegations that its army has
enslaved captives taken during the country's civil war. The
government maintains the charges are trumped up as part of a
western campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Bak said that in the raid on Achuru, her village in southern
Sudan, many people were killed, including her grandfather and male
cousins. The attacking Muslim militiamen sold the women and
children into slavery as domestics and shepherds, Jacobs said.
</P>
<P>
   Isolated from her relatives, Bak said, ''I was like an animal,''
with her nomadic master ordering her whipped or stoned if she lost
one of his goats.
</P>
<P>
   ''I escaped one night after he tried to rape me,'' she said. ''I
resisted, and he cut my leg with a knife. I slipped away, got on a
goat truck and hid among the animals.''
</P>
<P>
   Jacobs said the United States and other Western nations are
doing little to stop the abuse in Sudan and Mauritania, where he
said as many as 1 million people are enslaved, including Muslims.
</P>
<P>
   ''Slavery is the stepchild of the human rights movement,'' said
Jacobs, who quit his work as an international management consultant
to form the anti-slavery group in 1993.
</P>
<P>
   Bak eventually ended up in the Sudanese capital Khartoum and met
a fellow Dinka tribesman named Majak. In 1998, he arranged for her
to marry his brother in Cairo. Bak was resettled in America by the
United Nations six months ago with her husband, now a 27-year-old
metalworker.
</P>
<P>
   Their son Majak is named after the man who saved her -- now her
brother-in-law.
</P>
<P>
   About 25,000 Sudanese slaves have been freed -- bought at about
$50 each -- with the help of Christian Solidarity International,
based in Zurich, Switzerland. At least 100 schools around the
country have since joined the effort.
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday, Bak walked to nearby St. Patrick's Cathedral on
Fifth Avenue with her child. As he sucked on the milk from his baby
bottle, the boy's eyes lit up at the brightly illuminated stained
glass.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm happy, because he is free,'' his mother said in broken
English.

<HEADLINE> Giants 5, Phillies 4  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO (AP) -- Ellis Burks hit an infield single in the
eighth inning and the San Francisco Giants defeated the
Philadelphia Phillies 5-4 Wednesday night for their eighth straight
win.
</P>
<P>
   The Giants took a season-high 7&AMP;frac12;-game lead in the NL West and
matched their longest winning string of the year.
</P>
<P>
   Philadelphia lost its eighth in a row.
</P>
<P>
   Vicente Padilla (3-5) walked the bases loaded and Burks hit a
ball into the hole. Third baseman Scott Rolen fielded the ball, but
had no chance to get an out as Marvin Benard came home with the
go-ahead run.
</P>
<P>
   Aaron Fultz (4-2) pitched two scoreless inning, striking out a
career-high five, for the victory. Alan Embree recorded the final
two outs for his second save.
</P>
<P>
   The Giants took a 4-0 lead in the first against Randy Wolf.
Calvin Murray was hit by a pitch and eventually scored on a single
by Barry Bonds.
</P>
<P>
   With two outs, Burks singled and Russ Davis followed with his
eighth homer of the season, a three-run shot over the left-field
fence.
</P>
<P>
   In the third, Bobby Abreu tripled off the glove of a leaping
Bonds in the left and scored when Doug Glanville singled to make it
4-1.
</P>
<P>
   Wolf started the tying rally in the fifth with a one-out single
against Mark Gardner. Abreu walked and Glanville singled to load
the bases for Rolen, who singled home two runs. Travis Lee followed
with a sacrifice fly that tied it.
</P>
<P>
Notes: Giants RHP Russ Ortiz was named NL Pitcher of the Month for
August. ... Phillies C Mike Lieberthal was scheduled to leave the
team after the game to have his elbow and ankle examined in Los
Angeles. ... The Phillies have lost 10 straight in San Francisco
dating back to Aug. 30, 1998, at Candlestick Park. ... Home plate
umpire Ed Rapuano took a foul ball off his face mask during the top
of the third inning, and remained in the game after receiving some
treatment from Giants head trainer Stan Conte. ... Davis had hit
four homers in his previous 14 at-bats. ... Bonds received his 17th
intentional walk of the season, adding to his career record (315).

<HEADLINE> IOC Reports Drug Seizure at Airport  </HEADLINE>
By ROB GLOSTER
<TEXT>
<P>
   SYDNEY, Australia (AP) -- Airport customs agents seized banned
performance-enhancing drugs from an Uzbekistan Olympic team
official Thursday morning, Olympic official Jacques Rogge said.
</P>
<P>
   ''There was a member of the Uzbekistan delegation who was caught
at the airport with illegal drugs,'' said Rogge, vice chairman of
the International Olympic Committee's medical commission. ''All the
publicity of drug controls did not seep into Uzbekistan.''
</P>
<P>
   The Australian Customs Service said it ''has detained a small
quantity of what appears to be human growth hormone after it was
found in the baggage of an Olympic team official at Sydney
International Airport.''
</P>
<P>
   Leon Bedington, the Olympics spokesman for the customs service,
said the substance was being analyzed at a government laboratory in
Sydney but he could not predict when the tests would be completed.
</P>
<P>
   ''The label is clearly marked as human growth hormone,'' he
said. ''But it has not been chemically analyzed.''
</P>
<P>
   Bedington refused to identify the gender, age or nationality of
the suspected official, but said at a news conference that the
person caught with the substance was not an athlete.
</P>
<P>
   Bedington said the person was neither detained nor arrested, and
that the official was cooperating with authorities.
</P>
<P>
   Under an Australian law passed in March, a person caught
illegally importing a performance-enhancing drug into the country
could face a maximum penalty of five years in prison and a $57,000
fine.
</P>
<P>
   Bedington said the illegal importation of HGH is covered by that
law. HGH can be legally imported only if special permission is
sought from the health ministry.
</P>
<P>
   The Australian Broadcasting Corp. radio reported the official
was carrying two vials of HGH. Bedington refused to disclose the
exact amount, saying only it was ''a small quantity'' but more than
the ABC had reported.
</P>
<P>
   The person carrying the substance was stopped based on customs
service assessments that identify people to search.
</P>
<P>
   ''We do not do random or routine searches,'' Bedington said.
''The person was selected for further investigation based on that
risk assessment.''
</P>
<P>
   The seizure was the first since teams began arriving for the
Sydney Olympics, which start Sept. 15.
</P>
<P>
   The IOC has approved a test to detect the use of the banned
synthetic hormone erythropoietin, or EPO, considered the drug of
choice for endurance athletes, but there is still no test to detect
HGH.
</P>
<P>
   HGH, which helps build muscles, is produced naturally by the
pituitary gland. A synthetic form of the drug is used
therapeutically, especially to treat slow growth in children.
</P>
<P>
   IOC officials said they would launch an investigation into the
incident as soon as they got more details and said any athlete or
coach found carrying drugs could be stripped of Olympic
accreditation.
</P>
<P>
   IOC vice president and head of the World Anti-Doping Agency,
Dick Pound, said the seizure highlighted the success of heightened
cooperation between the IOC and national governments in efforts to
crack down on drug use in sport.
</P>
<P>
   ''You have got to be nuts with all the publicity on cracking
down on drug use in the games to come whistling through customs
with HGH,'' he said. ''It seems reckless to me.''
</P>
<P>
   Australian customs inspectors discovered 13 vials of HGH hidden
in the luggage of Chinese swimmer Yuan Yuan before the 1998 World
Swimming Championships in Perth.

Gore Outlines Economic Plan
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   CLEVELAND (AP) -- In a cadence mimicking former President Bush's ''read my
lips,'' Al Gore reached Wednesday for the mantle of fiscal conservative, asking
voters to ''read my plan'' in a hefty budget book coupling balanced budgets and
ambitious economic goals. The Democratic presidential candidate denounced what
he called the ''cross-your-fingers economics'' of GOP rival George W. Bush, the
former president's son, and the broad income tax cuts at the center of Bush's
agenda. Meanwhile, the Gore campaign was eagerly awaiting a vote Thursday by
leaders of the Teamsters that they expected would give Gore the union's
endorsement -- and the manpower that comes with it.

   NEW YORK (AP) -- President Clinton labored today without apparent success to
impress Israeli and Palestinian leaders with a sense of urgency as their
deadline for a settlement loomed only a week away. White House spokesman Joe
Lockhart made no claim of progress after Clinton's back-to-back meetings with
Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak and Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat. Clinton
had faced long odds in trying to relaunch his flagging peace process by meeting
with the Mideast leaders on the fringes of the U.N. Millennium Summit.

   DILI, East Timor (AP) -- Thousands of armed militiamen and their supporters
rampaged through a U.N. office in West Timor, killing at least three workers --
including one from Puerto Rico -- and burning their bodies. The brutal attack
brought new pressure against Indonesia's president as he gathered with world
leaders at the United Nations. Four U.N. helicopters swooped down to the border
town of Atambua and safely evacuated 54 people to East Timor, but world leaders
quickly and harshly castigated Indonesia for not doing more to protect aid
workers. Witnesses said Indonesian security forces stood by as the mobs torched
the U.N. office and beat the workers.

people who ate the patties in the past month became ill, and each tested
positive for E. coli, but state health department officials said Wednesday other
consumers may have become ill without realizing the cause. The Minnesota
Department of Agriculture lab confirmed Wednesday that a sample was contaminated

<HEADLINE> Crisis at Bush's Oil Company  </HEADLINE>
By PETE YOST
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- George W. Bush, before he sold his stock in a
Texas oil company, was fully aware that the firm was suffering from
a severe cash crisis and was poised to lose millions, according to
newly released records of a closed insider trading investigation of
the sale.
</P>
<P>
   ''The full capacity of the company is dedicated toward resolving
this liquidity crisis,'' Harken Energy Corp. President Mikel
Faulkner told Bush and the other members of the board of directors
two months before the $850,000 stock sale in June 1990.
</P>
<P>
   Bush's lawyer said Wednesday that the information, while new to
the presidential campaign, was provided to the Securities and
Exchange Commission as part of its investigation a decade ago and
contributed to the agency's finding that Bush's trading was
appropriate.
</P>
<P>
   At the time of the investigation, Bush's father was president of
the United States and the SEC was run by one of his biggest
political supporters, Richard Breeden. The SEC's then-general
counsel, James R. Doty, was another staunch presidential supporter
who as a private attorney was the younger Bush's lawyer when he
purchased his share of the Texas Rangers baseball team.
</P>
<P>
   ''The SEC did their job by the book, and this is old news,''
attorney Robert Jordan said. The Bush lawyer added that ''the
company's financial situation was well-disclosed to the public''
through filings at the time with the SEC.
</P>
<P>
   ''By the time Bush sold his stock, the cash crisis had been
largely resolved,'' said Jordan. ''By May 21, 1990, the major
shareholders had agreed to a credit agreement which put $26 million
into the company immediately.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush sold his stock at $4 a share on June 22, 1990, and by the
end of that year, the company's stock was trading at slightly above
$1. It returned to the $4 level and above in 1991, at one point
hitting nearly $9.
</P>
<P>
   Insider trading allegations have been an issue in both Bush's
run for governor in Texas and his presidential bid. The SEC in the
last month released several hundred pages of corporate documents
from its investigation under the Freedom of Information Act.
</P>
<P>
   Bush has said he had no knowledge the Texas-based company would
report a $23 million loss two months after he sold his stock. ''I
absolutely had no idea and would not have sold it had I known,'' he
said during his 1994 campaign for governor.
</P>
<P>
   SEC investigators concurred there was no evidence Bush knew the
loss would be of that magnitude. At most, the investigators found,
Bush was aware of a projected $4 million loss, which was
''consistent with Harken's publicly reported trend'' of losses,
states an SEC investigative document obtained by The Associated
Press.
</P>
<P>
   The Harken documents released under FOIA detail Bush's knowledge
of the company's problems.
</P>
<P>
   As a Harken director, he received memos in spring 1990 that
referred in stark terms to the company's cash-strapped condition as
banks demanded it pay down its debts. One document said the company
was in the midst of a ''liquidity crisis'' and another told Bush
the company was ''in a state of noncompliance'' with its lenders.
</P>
<P>
   Bush also was informed that a company plan to make a public
stock offering to generate cash was being abandoned because one of
its lenders objected.
</P>
<P>
   ''On the eve of filing this offering, the Bank of Boston refused
to grant waivers and consents necessary to allow the offering to
proceed,'' Harken said in a letter to the SEC in 1991. ''Bank of
Boston refused to alter its position and instead made demands that
it be removed from the company's credit.'' The company solved the
crisis when two of its biggest stockholders loaned it the $43
million it needed.
</P>
<P>
   Even after his stock sale, Bush remained on the company's board
of directors until 1993.
</P>
<P>
   The SEC investigators never interviewed Bush about what else he
might have known about the company's financial situation before
selling the stock.
</P>
<P>
   The investigators noted that Bush did not initiate the sale of
his stock, that he was approached by a broker and checked with the
company's general counsel about the propriety of the sale before
carrying it out.
</P>
<P>
   ''It appears that Bush did not engage in illegal insider trading
because it does not appear that he possessed material nonpublic
information or that he acted with'' wrongful intent ''when he sold
the Harken stock,'' SEC investigators wrote in a March 1992 summary
obtained by the AP.
</P>
<P>
   When Harken announced its $23 million quarterly loss on Aug. 20,
1990, its stock held steady for more than two hours, then plummeted
to $2.38 a share. The next day it rebounded to the previous day's
$3 high. Regulators said the fact that the stock didn't immediately
plunge and recovered so quickly was further evidence the
information could not be viewed as important to a reasonable
investor.
</P>
<P>
   SEC's enforcement chief at the time, William McLucas, said in an
interview that the Bush investigation ''was handled the same way
any insider trading inquiry would be handled.''
</P>
<P>
   New York University law professor Stephen Gillers, who reviewed
the SEC investigative documents at AP's request, said the agency
made a sound judgment legally and ethically to close the insider
trading probe without interviewing Bush.
</P>
<P>
   ''We're dealing with investigators here who are not political
appointees,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Gillers said the evidence contained in the SEC documents was
''fairly persuasive against proceeding'' against Bush.

<HEADLINE> Bush Presses Military Readiness  </HEADLINE>
By LAURIE KELLMAN
<TEXT>
<P>
   DETROIT (AP) -- George W. Bush is getting help from two
well-known military leaders, retired Gens. Colin Powell and Norman
Schwarzkopf, in pressing his argument that the Clinton-Gore
administration has failed to update the military and prepare it for
war.
</P>
<P>
   ''Let's get something straight. These are not criticisms of the
military,'' the Republican presidential nominee said Wednesday at
the American Legion convention in Milwaukee, Wis.
</P>
<P>
   ''They are criticisms of the current commander in chief and the
vice president for not providing the necessary leadership,'' said
Bush, wearing his blue American Legion cap from a post in Houston.
</P>
<P>
   Proving his capability on national defense and diplomacy has
been a key challenge for Bush, who also is convinced that the issue
of military readiness is a weak spot for Democratic rival Al Gore.
</P>
<P>
   So during this week's reprise of his main campaign themes, Bush
is highlighting luminaries who led the nation -- and his father,
President Bush -- through the Cold War and the Persian Gulf War.
</P>
<P>
   With the military figures at his side during campaign stops
Thursday in Michigan and Ohio, Bush was re-emphasizing a key theme:
''Transforming'' the military from an instrument of Cold War-era
conflicts into a more technologically advanced force that can fight
Information Age battles.
</P>
<P>
   ''Now is the time to shape the future of the military with new
concepts, new strategies, new resolves,'' he told the American
Legion. ''We will challenge the status quo and envision a new
architecture for American defense for decades to come. Our forces
... must have the technology to dominate information, as well as
the technology to dominate the skies and the seas in order to keep
the peace.''
</P>
<P>
   Running mate Dick Cheney, the elder Bush's defense secretary,
was to make a similar pitch Thursday in Portland, Maine.
</P>
<P>
   It is a familiar, but not recently emphasized theme for Bush,
who first discussed it a year ago in his first address on national
defense at The Citadel in South Carolina.
</P>
<P>
   He has hammered the administration harder, however, on military
readiness.
</P>
<P>
   But the issue stung him in July when, in his speech accepting
the GOP presidential nomination, he misstated one fact when talking
about Army readiness.
</P>
<P>
   Bush said: ''If called on by the commander in chief today, two
entire divisions of the Army would have to report ... 'Not ready
for duty, sir.'''
</P>
<P>
   He also accuses Gore of proposing to shortchange the armed
forces on funding and benefits. But the vice president's campaign
released an economic plan Wednesday that would spend $100 billion
of the projected budget surplus on the military over 10 years.
</P>
<P>
   Bush would dedicate $45 billion of the surplus over the same
period.
</P>
<P>
   ''Any argument that he comes up with that we are not dedicating
the resources needed for our military men and women is just talk,
pure rhetoric,'' said Kym Spell, a spokeswoman for Gore.
</P>
<P>
   Bush spokesman Ari Fleischer pointed out Gore has lowered
projected military spending since last month when he said he would
spend $128 million over 10 years. He said Bush's $45 billion figure
was not set in stone.
</P>
<P>
   ''The governor has said he is willing to have a top-to-bottom
review upon election to see how we can restore our military to make
it more efficient and more lethal and we will reserve judgment
until that is done,'' said Fleischer.
</P>
<P>
   Powell and Schwarzkopf are among those Bush has said he'd like
on his foreign policy team, along with former secretaries of state
George Shultz and Henry Kissinger.
</P>
<P>
   The military theme comes near the end of a week that had Bush
hopscotching across battleground states in an effort to regain the
campaign momentum stolen by Gore.

<HEADLINE> Bush Ads Probe Gore Credibility  </HEADLINE>
By LAURA MECKLER
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- George W. Bush's new ad is about debating Al
Gore, but the real message is about his credibility, the second
commercial in two weeks to do so. ''If we can't trust Al Gore on
debates, why should we trust him on anything?'' the ad concludes.
</P>
<P>
   As the campaign for the White House intensifies, the Republican
presidential candidate's upbeat messages are being replaced by
hard-hitting digs at his Democratic opposition.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans in key states welcomed the change in tactics, saying
swing voters care whether Gore is being straight with them. They
also hope the new focus on Gore's credibility will help Bush regain
the lead from Gore.
</P>
<P>
   ''Most campaigns would like to have the luxury of staying
positive, but in order to stay positive you've got to stay
significantly ahead in the polls,'' said Tom Slade, former chairman
of the Florida Republican Party. ''In races that get close -- and
this one obviously has -- the knives are going to come out.''
</P>
<P>
   Portraying Gore as untrustworthy is key to winning support for
Bush, Republicans reason, and he somehow must convince voters they
want a change in times of unprecedented prosperity.
</P>
<P>
   At least one GOP adviser to Bush, however, was concerned he may
be spending too much time using the debates to make that case.
Other Republicans questioned the effectiveness of the latest spot.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm not sure that's an issue that the average voter cares
about,'' said Timothy Jay Houseal, an attorney in Wilmington, Del.,
who is active in Republican politics.
</P>
<P>
   Stephen Hess, who studies politics at the Brookings Institution,
agreed that undecided voters probably don't care about the details
over debates. ''This isn't what they're talking about around the
water fountain today,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   That may explain why Bush's campaign was considering only a
token buy in just a handful of markets. The ad may have been
designed as much for reporters as voters, as Bush tries to
outmaneuver Gore on debate formats and settings.
</P>
<P>
   Bush has accepted only one of three 90-minute prime-time debates
proposed by the bipartisan commission that has run presidential
debates since 1988. Instead, citing offers by Gore to debate him in
dozens of other locations, Bush accepted debate invitations from
NBC and CNN talk shows.
</P>
<P>
   Gore's campaign says Bush must agree to the full set of
commission debates before any others.
</P>
<P>
   Gore suggests Bush is dodging debates that would be seen by
large audiences. Republicans counter that Gore's rejection of
Bush's offer shows he is untrustworthy.
</P>
<P>
   ''When it was politically convenient, Gore said he'd debate
anytime, anyplace, anywhere,'' an announcer says in the new
30-second spot. ''Now that Governor Bush has accepted, Gore says
'unacceptable.'''
</P>
<P>
   The debate ad follows a Republican National Committee
commercial, already airing in 16 states, that questions Gore's
credibility on campaign finance reform and mocks him for claiming a
key role in developing the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   Woody Cozad, former Missouri GOP chairman, predicted the
skirmish about debates, though not ideal, will help Bush because
the earlier RNC ad already has laid the ground work.
</P>
<P>
   ''You already have a message on the air that Gore is in fact
unreliable, that he says one thing and does another,'' Cozad said.
''It increases the effectiveness of the second ad no matter what
the subject may be.''

<HEADLINE> Gore, Bush Compete Over Economics  </HEADLINE>
By MARTIN CRUTSINGER
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Al Gore is betting that his collection of debt
reduction, spending increases and modest tax breaks will prove an
unbeatable combination against George W. Bush's hefty tax cuts. But
both presidential candidates may be promising more than they can
deliver -- especially if the current remarkable economy suddenly
takes a turn for the worse.
</P>
<P>
   Urging voters to ''read my plan,'' Gore unveiled a 191-page
blueprint Wednesday on how he would spend $4.56 trillion in
surpluses projected by the Congressional Budget Office over the
next decade.
</P>
<P>
   Titled ''Prosperity for America's Families,'' the document seeks
to emulate the success of ''Putting People First,'' Bill Clinton's
economic manifesto of 1992, which he used to defeat Bush's father.
</P>
<P>
   Gore's proposal spreads surplus money around a gamut of popular
programs -- from the environment to education and health care -- and
is, according to its introduction, ''full of specifics for our
opponents to ridicule, attack or belittle.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush wasted little time doing just that, saying the plan exposed
Gore as a government-loving liberal. ''He spends the entire surplus
on bigger government,'' Bush said.
</P>
<P>
   For his part, Gore challenged Bush to release as much detail
about his tax and spending programs. Bush's campaign responded with
a four-page summary of his program.
</P>
<P>
   In one major way, the two documents are identical -- both earmark
more than half of the $4.56 trillion in projected surpluses -- the
$2.39 billion generated by Social Security -- to bolstering the
giant retirement program.
</P>
<P>
   Gore would use all of the money to reduce the national debt as a
way to put the government on sounder fiscal footing when the baby
boomers retire. Bush's proposal would pay down the debt and use an
unspecified portion to finance giving workers the option of putting
some of their payroll taxes into their own retirement accounts.
</P>
<P>
   So far, the Bush campaign has been vague on just what amounts
will be required to finance this changeover, which many private
experts warn could be a huge drain on the Social Security system
over the next several decades.
</P>
<P>
   Gore has his own proposal to bolster Americans' abysmally low
personal savings rates, offering tax-free Retirement Savings Plus
accounts with matching government funds to encourage savings by
middle and lower-income individuals.
</P>
<P>
   Gore estimates the plan's cost at $200 billion over 10 years,
but the Bush campaign says the true price tag is likely to be
closer to $720 billion.
</P>
<P>
   Just as Gore has sought to portray Bush's plan for a $1.3
billion across-the-board tax cut as ''risky'' for the economy,
Republicans tried to brand Gore's plan as ''risky'' on the spending
side.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans on the Senate Budget Committee released a report
estimating that Gore's spending proposals, both those in his budget
and those he has endorsed on the campaign trail, would eat up as
much as $906 billion more than the current projections for $2.2
trillion in non-Social Security surpluses.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Phil Gramm, R-Texas, labeled Gore's plan ''a promise grab
bag that is bigger than any politician of the modern era of
American history has ever proposed.''
</P>
<P>
   The Gore campaign rejected the charge and pointed to a $300
billion ''surplus reserve fund'' that would be used as a cushion in
case the current surplus projections prove too optimistic.
</P>
<P>
   However, Gore was able to come up with the money for the fund
simply by switching from the less optimistic surplus projections
his own administration made this summer ($1.9 trillion) to the more
optimistic CBO estimates released in July ($2.2 trillion).
</P>
<P>
   As they always do, economists cautioned against placing too much
reliance on 10-year forecasts of government revenues and spending.
</P>
<P>
   For the surpluses to occur as projected, the current expansion,
already in a record 10th year, will have to keep powering along
without a recession. But the economy is showing signs of slowing
and many economists believe growth will be significantly slower
next year.
</P>
<P>
   For Gore, the current good economic times are not enough. His
economic plan puts forward a list of 10 ambitious economic goals,
including boosting Americans' savings and increasing the median
family's inflation-adjusted income by one-third over the next 10
years -- from $50,000 to $67,000.
</P>
<P>
   Such a gain could be accomplished if productivity, the key to
rising living standards, keeps growing over the next decade at the
robust levels seen in the last four year years -- something many
economists doubt will occur.
</P>
<P>
   While both candidates are pushing their rival plans as the best
prescription to keep the good times rolling, many private
economists see both as a potential threat to overheat an economy
with unemployment already at a three-decade low.
</P>
<P>
   ''We don't need a tax cut and we don't need spending increases
right now. The right thing to do is nothing. Leave well enough
alone and enjoy the ride,'' said David Wyss, chief economist at
Standard &AMP; Poors in New York.

<HEADLINE> Rochester prepares for world canal conference  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   ROCHESTER, N.Y. (AP) - Organizers of a world conference on
canals are preparing for about 300 devotees and experts that are
expected to attend next week's event.
</P>
<P>
   Visitors are expected from England, France, Spain, Canada and
the Czech Republic on Sept. 10 for the international discussion
about the future of the world's canal systems.
</P>
<P>
   They will be greeted Sunday with a flotilla of as many as 100
boats from across the state. The maritime parade will make its way
north up the Genesee River from the canal.
</P>
<P>
   ''People from around the world will see that we are putting a
lot more attention toward the Erie Canal,'' said Rochester Mayor
William A. Johnson Jr.
</P>
<P>
   The Erie Canal, which connected the Hudson and Lake Erie in
1825, was once an important commercial trade route that connected
the ports of New York and Albany to the western frontier.
</P>
<P>
   But the last remnants of commercial shipping left its banks in
1994 and it is now used exclusively for recreational purposes.

<HEADLINE> GOP Leaders Worry About Bush  </HEADLINE>
By TOM RAUM
<TEXT>
<P>
   DETROIT (AP) -- Some leading national Republicans, alarmed about
George W. Bush's difficulty in stemming Al Gore's advance, are
issuing troubled warnings to the Bush campaign and urging a review
of tactics.
</P>
<P>
   Bush campaign officials liken the rising nervousness among party
leaders to fears expressed last winter after Bush lost the New
Hampshire primary to Sen. John McCain of Arizona. They suggest this
current angst, too, will pass.
</P>
<P>
   But there is no doubt there is mounting concern in the Bush camp
over polls showing that the Texas governor is losing or has lost
the edge he once enjoyed in many battleground states.
</P>
<P>
   The decision to campaign in Florida next week -- a state once
believed to be a sure-win for Bush, whose younger brother Jeb is
governor -- was viewed by GOP officials as yet another sign of the
race tightening.
</P>
<P>
   Bush's current taunting of Gore on presidential debates -- both
in a new television ad and in stump speeches -- was also angering
some Republicans, said GOP officials who spoke on the condition of
anonymity.
</P>
<P>
   While Bush's pre-emptive ''agreement'' last Sunday to
participate in one formal debate and two on TV talk shows was
initially cheered as bold strike by Bush, his subsequent refusal to
negotiate terms on other formats with Gore was viewed with
increasing concern.
</P>
<P>
   The debate on the debates ''is irrelevant. It's not what voters
care about,'' said GOP pollster Frank Luntz.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Luntz said, ''The level of interest in this campaign is
shockingly low. The potential for comeback is incredibly high. You
could easily see a tidal wave in the final hours.''
</P>
<P>
   Many national Republicans were getting increasingly worried
about the recent turn in events.
</P>
<P>
   ''Everybody got cocky'' after Bush's comfortable lead over Gore
through most of the summer and a triumphant GOP convention,
conceded veteran GOP operative Charles Black, a Bush campaign
adviser.
</P>
<P>
   Now the reality of a close race is sinking in, worrying many
Republicans, Black said. But he said he thinks there's still plenty
of time for Bush to regain lost ground.
</P>
<P>
   Karen Hughes, Bush's communication director, said that in the
coming days, ''We're going to aggressively make the case that
Governor Bush has real plans for real people.''
</P>
<P>
   She suggested that Bush has been making gains in Midwestern
battleground states in recent days ''in the real America where real
people live,'' despite some disappointing poll results.
</P>
<P>
   As to concerns by Washington Republicans over the conduct of the
Bush campaign -- still largely managed by a small group of
Texas-based Bush loyalists -- the same concerns were voiced last
February as Bush was struggling under the McCain challenge, Hughes
suggested.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think the result will be the same. Governor Bush is very
pleased with the leadership and the direction of his campaign,''
she said.
</P>
<P>
   Despite widespread GOP euphoria in July and early August, Bush's
chief strategist, Karl Rove, had predicted all along that the race
would draw even by early September.
</P>
<P>
   ''What Rove probably didn't expect was a Gore lead on Labor
Day,'' said Thomas Mann, a political analyst at the Brookings
Institution in Washington. ''We'll learn more this weekend,'' Mann
said, suggesting that polls taken within the next few days are
all-important as a measure of where the race stands.
</P>
<P>
   Among recent significant developments, he suggests: ''Florida is
now in play. There is no question about that.''
</P>
<P>
   ''The past two weeks have been bad for him,'' said one top
Republican not associated directly with the Bush campaign.
</P>
<P>
   ''His campaign has been slow to address problems,'' said the
official, speaking on the condition of anonymity. ''He needs to
somehow get the subject back to change, to character.''
</P>
<P>
   Notwithstanding his heavy reliance on a band of Texas advisers,
Bush has recruited stars from his father's administration to help
his campaign.
</P>
<P>
   He was appearing Thursday in Detroit with two popular generals
who helped his father win the Persian Gulf War --Colin Powell and
Norman Schwarzkopf -- to press his attack on Clinton-Gore military
readiness.
</P>
<P>
   Powell, who spoke on Bush's behalf at the GOP convention but has
done little active campaigning since, said in an interview that,
''I've always been available to the governor for consultation. I
will appear with him from time to time.''
</P>
<P>
   As to frictions between Bush's Austin-based staff and national
Republicans, ''I don't do a roster check'' on where various
advisers are based, Bush said.
</P>
<P>
   Stuart Rothenberg, a Washington-based political analyst,
suggested that the Bush campaign had stumbled over both the issue
of running mate Dick Cheney's finances and the presidential
debates.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's possible to turn this around,'' Rothenberg said. ''Bush
needs to look confident and feel confident and somehow put Gore on
the defensive, regain some momentum. But I don't think they can
expect to do it overnight.''

<HEADLINE> Gorbachev Chides Putin on Submarine  </HEADLINE>
By GERALD NADLER
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Looking relaxed, Mikhail Gorbachev joked that he
could only take one question at a time because he is 69. He then
launched into a warts-and-all assessment of Vladimir Putin,
criticizing the Russian president's ''mistakes of style.''
</P>
<P>
   Among Putin's missteps, Gorbachev said Wednesday, was waiting
four days to comment on the Kursk submarine tragedy and failing to
interrupt his vacation until a week after the sea disaster that
killed all 118 seamen aboard.
</P>
<P>
   Gorbachev, who himself was criticized for waiting several days
before commenting on the explosion at the Chernobyl nuclear power
station on April 26, 1986, said Putin's initial response to the
Kursk's sinking was ''inadequate.''
</P>
<P>
   ''He made a mistake,'' the former Soviet leader said.
</P>
<P>
   Gorbachev, who set the Soviet Union on the road to democracy,
also said Putin failed to explain to the people his economic
policies and legislative reforms to bolster governors as the
dominant leaders in Russia's regions.
</P>
<P>
   The former leader said he had pointed out these missteps to
Putin. An aide said Gorbachev met several times with Putin, with
one meeting lasting three hours.
</P>
<P>
   Gorbachev said earlier that the loss of the Kursk was part of an
''acute August crisis'' that also included a bombing at Moscow's
Pushkin Square that killed 12 people and a fire that roared through
Moscow's giant TV tower, leaving three people dead.
</P>
<P>
   ''The cause of the crisis was that the authorities showed a lack
of understanding of the need for informing the people -- of
glasnost,'' said Gorbachev, using the Russian word for ''openness''
that characterized his six years as the last Soviet communist
president.
</P>
<P>
   But Gorbachev, who was in New York to launch a Foundation for
the Development of Democracy and World Peace, said Putin's errors
were ''mostly mistakes of style'' and that the leader was sensitive
to criticism and ''recovered quickly.''
</P>
<P>
   ''We need to support the president ... despite the mistakes,''
Gorbachev said.
</P>
<P>
   He praised the Russian press for insisting authorities give the
facts about the crippled submarine, but bristled at what he said
was the Western press's ''lumping'' of his handling of the
Chernobyl explosion and Putin's slow response to the loss of the
Kursk. ''The coverage in the West smacked of the Cold War,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Gorbachev won the Nobel Peace Prize for his policies that
effectively ended the Cold War. He resigned on Dec. 25, 1991, when
the Soviet Union broke up, and was succeeded by Boris Yeltsin.
Yeltsin stepped down at the end of 1999 and was replaced by Putin.

<HEADLINE> Greek Victims Remember Quake  </HEADLINE>
By ELENA BECATOROS
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATHENS, Greece (AP) -- A dried wreath lies atop the rubble of a
factory complex that crumbled in seconds during a devastating
earthquake a year ago. A few yards away is a more bitter -- and some
say, more fitting -- memorial to the 38 people killed.
</P>
<P>
   The sun-parched flowers tell of the 143 people who died in the
5.9 magnitude quake on Sept. 7, 1999. The Ricomex factory had the
largest single death toll of the disaster.
</P>
<P>
   But a plain white marble monument, with a plaque reading
''Memorial of Disgrace'' above the names of the victims, stands as
another memorial to those who died at the household products plant.
</P>
<P>
   Relatives of those killed blame shoddy construction for the
collapse and are bitterly angry at Greek authorities for the slow
pace of an investigation into the factory's builders.
</P>
<P>
   ''The 'Disgrace' is for the state authorities who have been
silent until now, and for those who built this wreck,'' said
Stefanos Psiridis, whose sister Ioanna was killed in the collapse.
</P>
<P>
   In the quake's aftermath, Greek authorities pledged to
investigate the construction quality of buildings that went down.
But investigations have been slowed by missing documents and other
problems.
</P>
<P>
   The quake damaged 70,000 buildings around the capital, leaving
about 100,000 people homeless. The factory was located near the
quake epicenter in Athens' northern suburbs.
</P>
<P>
   Resettling and compensating quake victims and repairing damage
will cost $270 million, Planning Minister Costas Laliotis said.
</P>
<P>
   ''Although much has been done, there remains much more to do,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   Earthquakes last summer in both Turkey and Greece -- and the aid
mutually offered by the two neighbors -- have been credited with
helping warm relations between the two regional rivals. More than
17,000 people were killed in the Aug. 17, 1999 quake in
northwestern Turkey.
</P>
<P>
   But the diplomatic advances mean little to those still living in
temporary housing in Athens.
</P>
<P>
   About 6,000 families are staying in converted containers in
state camps. Although the government is providing low-interest
loans to help quake victims rebuild their homes, many complain the
amounts are small and procedures to obtain them long-winded and
bureaucratic.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's hard and they ask for so many papers, so we gave up and
we're just funding the repairs ourselves,'' said Vasilis Kataras,
who said he had chosen to remain in his severely damaged home until
he began repairs a month ago.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's not possible to rebuild just with the money that they
give,'' said Mina Tordatzi as she watered plants in the garden she
has created outside her container home.
</P>
<P>
   Tordatzi, her husband and three grown children spent three
months living in a tent camp after the quake before they were moved
to the converted container camp in the Athens suburb of Menidi.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's OK living here -- better than living in those tents, in
that mess that we were in,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Many of the homeless families seem resigned to the idea that
they'll be living in the camp for many more months. Well-tended
gardens have appeared, and raised wooden porches with red tiled
roofs have been added to the fronts of the plain containers.
</P>
<P>
   The family of Despina Iliadou built an extension to theirs to
create a living room.
</P>
<P>
   ''I took all my plants from my house and brought them here,''
said Iliadou, proudly displaying her tidy home. ''I can't stand
wretchedness.''

<HEADLINE> Federal aid sought in Nile virus fight  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   ROCHESTER, N.Y. (AP) - The state Association of Counties has
joined Gov. George Pataki in asking for federal help to pay for the
mounting costs of the West Nile virus.
</P>
<P>
   In a letter sent to the White House, the Association of Counties
said the high price comes from bird collection and testing,
mosquito control and trapping, pesticide spraying, public education
campaigns and virus surveillance.
</P>
<P>
   Keeping track of the virus is proving to be an expensive effort,
said Jody Gray, Ontario County acting health director. Most of the
cost comes from staff being tied up with virus issues instead of
their other duties, Gray said.
</P>
<P>
   The state does not have a firm figure of what it has spent or
even what it expects to spend this year - though it will exceed the
$14 million shelled out last year according to state Department of
Health spokeswoman Kristine Smith.
</P>
<P>
   New York will pay for as much as half of the expenses for
counties where a public health threat has been declared.
</P>
<P>
   Pataki in early August called on the federal government to
provide $20 million in federal assistance - $12 million more than
allocated for New York's West Nile virus efforts this year.

<HEADLINE> Social Security Chief Mulls Accounts  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   PORTLAND, Maine (AP) -- The nation's top Social Security
administrator has ''serious reservations'' about creating
individual savings accounts using portions of payroll tax revenues,
an idea favored by Republican presidential candidate George W.
Bush.
</P>
<P>
   Social Security Commissioner Kenneth S. Apfel said ''carving
out'' money from the 12.4 percent payroll tax and using it for
savings accounts would make less money available to current
recipients.
</P>
<P>
   ''The taxes that we all pay go to pay benefits to people,''
Apfel told the Portland Press Herald in Thursday's editions. ''If
we take that money and you keep it in your own individual account,
then how are we paying for your grandma? That's a real serious
question.''
</P>
<P>
   He said some of the federal surplus -- projected by the
Congressional Budget Office at $4.561 trillion over 10 years --
should be used instead to strengthen the program, which has given
older Americans a safety net since it was signed into law by
President Franklin D. Roosevelt in 1935.
</P>
<P>
   He declined to comment on the Social Security plans proposed by
Bush and his Democratic opponent, Vice President Al Gore. But his
comments appear to put him at odds with Bush's proposal.
</P>
<P>
   The Texas governor wants to let younger workers put about
one-sixth of their payroll taxes into savings accounts that they
would own and control. The campaign has estimated that a young
worker earning $20,000 annually could retire with more than
$100,000 after inflation by investing the money in stocks and
bonds.
</P>
<P>
   A spokesman for the Bush campaign, Ken Lisaius, said the savings
accounts would ensure a high rate of return and stressed that Bush
is opposed to letting the government invest Social Security funds
in the stock market.
</P>
<P>
   ''The governor believes Social Security is a defining American
promise and he's dedicated to keeping it,'' Lisaius said. ''But the
only way to do it is through reforms.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore has proposed voluntary ''retirement savings plus accounts''
funded by employee contributions, up to $2,000 per year, beyond
their Social Security payroll taxes. The program would not divert
any Social Security payroll taxes.

<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Aretha Franklin, Smokey Robinson, Erykah Badu
and Bonnie Raitt were among the stars who paid tribute to forgotten
soul singers of the past at the Rhythm &AMP; Blues Foundation's 11th
annual Pioneer Awards.
</P>
<P>
   While superstars such as Stevie Wonder and the late Marvin Gaye
were also honored Wednesday night, the bulk of the four-hour
ceremony was dedicated to lesser-known acts such as the Chi-Lites,
who faded into obscurity although their harmonies on hits such as
''Have You Seen Her'' helped define the sound of the 60s and the
70s.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's one the most important awards that we ever received,''
said Chi-Lites founding member Eugene Record. ''They (the R&AMP;B
foundation) do things that are very unusual as far as helping
artists who have fallen on hard times, and I don't know any
organization that does that for musicians and entertainers.''
</P>
<P>
   In addition to bestowing long-overdue recognition, the
foundation awards most honorees with cash -- $20,000 for groups, and
$15,000 for individual artists.
</P>
<P>
   Motown founder Berry Gordy helped boost the foundation's
coffers, announcing a $750,000 donation to aid former acts from the
legendary label who are struggling.
</P>
<P>
   ''These are our pioneers, the people that we got something from,
we benefit from, so we have to look out for them like all people
do,'' he said. ''It's everyone's responsibility. It's our legacy.''
</P>
<P>
   Some of the artists honored by the foundation in years past were
cheated out of their royalties and received little during their
brief celebrity.
</P>
<P>
   ''Many artists did not get adequate compensation, and even
today, find it very difficult to survive even though their music is
known and played,'' said Mary Wilson, one of the original Supremes.
''As human beings, they're sort of forgotten. I think the Rhythm &AMP;
Blues organization gives not only sort of an award, but also gives
them something that they need inside, as human beings, to be
respected.''
</P>
<P>
   Besides the Chi-Lites, the foundation gave pioneer awards to
Huey ''Piano'' Smith, who performed on the hit ''Don't You Know
It/High Blood Pressure''; Sylvia Robinson, who had a hit with
''Love is Strange'' in 1957 and years later helped start the rap
revolution with the discovery of the Sugarhill Gang; Clyde Otis,
who wrote and produced songs for artists including Nat ''King''
Cole and Dinah Washington; The Impressions, whose hits include
''It's All Right''; Johnnie Johnson, a legendary pianist who
discovered and played with Chuck Berry; and Betty Wright, who may
best be known for her hit ''Clean Up Woman.''
</P>
<P>
   Wonder received the lifetime achievement award, while Gaye's
children accepted the Legacy Tribute award on his behalf. Ahmet
Ertegun, founder of Atlantic Records, received the R&AMP;B Founders
Award.
</P>
<P>
   The event also served as a concert and jam session, as the
honorees performed some of their biggest hits. Wonder's performance
was perhaps the most rousing, as he sang a medley of hits like
''Superstition,'' and ''I Was Made To Love Her,'' with Raitt, Badu,
Sister Sledge, Robinson and Dionne Warwick singing backup.
</P>
<P>
   Wonder called for today's performers to unite with past artists
for an album that would feature old hits and give back royalties to
those singers and their families.
</P>
<P>
   Though Wonder has received countless accolades, he said this
award held a special significance for him.
</P>
<P>
   ''It really is the essence of how I began,'' he said. ''I was an
R&AMP;B artist, a rhythm and blues artist, and I have great respect and
I am very proud of that.''

<HEADLINE> 'ER' Beaten by a Real Hospital Show  </HEADLINE>
By DAVID BAUDER
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- A real-life medical drama produced by ABC News
outperformed ''ER'' in the ratings, helping the network to another
weekly television ratings win.
</P>
<P>
   ABC's ''Hopkins 24/7'' news special last Thursday drew 12
million viewers, Nielsen Media Research said Wednesday. The
one-hour show, the second of a six-part special, followed doctors
and patients at the Johns Hopkins Hospital in Baltimore. It
featured a little girl from Indiana who underwent surgery to remove
half her brain.
</P>
<P>
   An ''ER'' rerun in the same time slot drew 8.5 million viewers.
</P>
<P>
   The first part of ''Hopkins 24/7,'' which aired last Wednesday,
drew 8.4 million viewers. Part two had the advantage of following
an edition of ''Who Wants to Be a Millionaire.'' The three editions
of the game show were easily the three most-watched programs of the
week.
</P>
<P>
   The faltering CBS ''Big Brother'' series drew 11.4 million
viewers last Wednesday, its most popular edition of the week. It
was enough for 11th place in the ratings, though it had 40 million
fewer viewers than the ''Survivor'' finale in the same time slot a
week earlier.
</P>
<P>
   For the week, ABC had an average prime-time viewership of 9.3
million people (6.5 rating, 12 share). CBS had 8.2 million viewers
(5.9, 11), NBC had 7.8 million (5.8, 10), Fox had 6.1 million (4.2,
7), UPN had 4.1 million (2.6, 5), the WB had 2.7 million (1.8, 3)
and Pax TV had 1.5 million (1.1, 2).
</P>
<P>
   NBC's ''Nightly News'' won the evening news ratings race with
9.3 million viewers (7.1 rating, 16 share). ABC's ''World News
Tonight'' had 8.6 million viewers (6.6, 15) and the ''CBS Evening
News'' had 7.9 million (6.1, 13).
</P>
<P>
   With the help of the conventions, the three cable news channels
each recorded viewership increases last month compared with August
1999. Fox News Channel, which beat CNBC in total viewers during
prime-time for the first time, was up 68 percent, MSNBC was up 58
percent and CNN was up 18 percent.
</P>
<P>
   A rating point represents 1,008,000 households, or 1 percent of
the nation's estimated 100.8 million TV homes. The share is the
percentage of in-use televisions tuned to a given show.
</P>
<P>
   For the week of Aug. 28-Sept. 3, the top 10 shows, their
networks and ratings: ''Who Wants to Be a Millionaire'' (Tuesday),
ABC, 14.6; ''Who Wants to Be a Millionaire'' (Thursday), ABC, 13.7;
''Who Wants to Be a Millionaire'' (Sunday), ABC, 11.9; ''Law and
Order,'' NBC, 9.2; ''Everybody Loves Raymond,'' CBS, 8.8; ''Hopkins
24/7,'' ABC, 8.8; ''Law and Order'' (Monday), NBC, 8.4; ''Dharma &AMP;
Greg,'' ABC, 8.2; ''60 Minutes,'' CBS, 7.9; ''Becker,'' CBS, 7.9.

<HEADLINE> Override of Estate Tax Veto Unlikely  </HEADLINE>
By CURT ANDERSON
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- If they fail to override President Clinton's
veto of a bill repealing estate taxes, House Republicans want to
make sure the vote makes Democrats uncomfortable and underscores
for voters the GOP commitment to tax cuts.
</P>
<P>
   While the House was scheduled to hold the override vote
Thursday, GOP leaders all but conceded it was unlikely they would
get the necessary two-thirds vote.
</P>
<P>
   ''We're hopeful we can get very close,'' said Rep. J.C. Watts of
Oklahoma, the fourth-ranking House Republican leader.
</P>
<P>
   In a 279-136 vote in June, 65 Democrats and one independent
joined all 213 Republicans voting as the House agreed to phase out
inheritance taxes at a cost of $105 billion over 10 years.
</P>
<P>
   While the margin was just over the two-thirds margin needed to
override a veto, Democratic leaders say 11 of their members who
missed the vote support Clinton's action and that at least 10 more
would be persuaded to switch sides.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think we'll sustain the veto,'' Treasury Secretary Lawrence
Summers told reporters, adding that the Clinton administration was
working with House Democrats to shore up support.
</P>
<P>
   Even if the House did vote to override the veto, a two-thirds
Senate margin also would be required and the 59-39 Senate vote to
pass the bill in July was eight short of that threshold.
</P>
<P>
   Although the first $675,000 of an estate is exempt from tax and
only about 2 percent of estates are affected each year, repealing
the tax has grown in popularity on Capitol Hill. One reason is a
forceful lobbying campaign led by the National Association of
Manufacturers, American Farm Bureau Federation and National
Federation of Independent Business. The groups contend the tax is
inherently unfair.
</P>
<P>
   Dan Danner, a senior vice president at the small business group,
said its 600,000 members ''will keep a particularly close eye ...
on those who desert their earlier support of death tax relief.''
</P>
<P>
   Next week, the House will decide whether to sustain the
president's veto of the 10-year, $292 billion marriage penalty tax
cut, for which 53 House Democrats voted.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton has said he would sign less costly versions of both
bills as long as the tax relief is directed more toward
middle-income people. There is some sentiment in GOP ranks to
demonstrate an election-year willingness to compromise, but other
Republicans prefer a clear dividing line on tax issues for voters.
</P>
<P>
   ''We've made the point. We've made the effort,'' said Senate
Majority Leader Trent Lott, R-Miss. ''Unfortunately, President
Clinton continues to talk one way and do something else.''
</P>
<P>
   Summers said the administration maintains that the GOP approach
of passing individual tax cuts that rely on projected budget
surpluses makes it impossible to determine the cuts' overall impact
on the economy and on priorities such as education, Social
Security, Medicare and paying down the federal debt.
</P>
<P>
   ''We need to have a much clearer idea about where we're going
before we're able to make judgments on individual tax pieces,''
Summers said.
</P>
<P>
   There have been nine attempts by Congress to override a Clinton
veto since Republicans took power in 1995. Four have won House
approval and only two -- on budget line-item vetoes and securities
litigation reform -- were overridden by the House and Senate as
required.
</P>
<P>

   The bill is H.R. 8.

<HEADLINE> Steroid Pills Said Better for Asthma  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON (AP) -- Doctors treating children for severe asthma
attacks should stick with standard steroid pills and not switch to
inhaled steroids, a study found.
</P>
<P>
   Steroid pills, such as prednisone, are safe when given for short
doses. But some pediatricians have wondered whether inhaled
steroids, which are easier to use, might work as well and be safer
still.
</P>
<P>
   The new study, conducted at the Hospital for Sick Children in
Toronto, attempted to settle this issue. One hundred children with
severe asthma attacks were randomly given either the inhaled or the
pill form of steroids.
</P>
<P>
   The results were clear: Children given prednisone pills
recovered more quickly.
</P>
<P>
   The report, published in Thursday's issue of the New England
Journal of Medicine, found that children given prednisone were
almost three times as likely to have an excellent response to
treatment and were only one-third as likely to be hospitalized.
</P>
<P>
   The study was partially financed by Glaxo Wellcome, which makes
Flonase, the inhaled steroid tested in the study.

<HEADLINE> China Asserts Claim Over Taiwan  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   BEIJING (AP) -- Pushing its claim over Taiwan into complex trade
negotiations, Beijing insisted Thursday that the World Trade
Organization only admit Taiwan as a part of China.
</P>
<P>
   The demand by Beijing threatens to impede Taiwan's membership
bid as both the island and China near the end of their separate
years-long negotiations to join global trade's rule-setting body.
It also complicates a debate in the U.S. Senate this week on
whether to approve a WTO pact with China.
</P>
<P>
   Influential senators released a letter from President Clinton on
Wednesday weighing in on Taiwan's side. Clinton wrote that his
administration opposes Chinese efforts to call Taiwan ''a separate
customs territory of China.''
</P>
<P>
   Brushing aside the opposition, Chinese Foreign Ministry
spokesman Sun Yuxi said Thursday that China wanted its sovereignty
claim to Taiwan written into the terms for Taiwanese membership to
WTO.
</P>
<P>
   ''The Chinese side has a consistent and clear position: Taiwan
can join WTO as a separate customs territory of China,'' Sun said
at a twice-weekly media briefing. He accused Taiwan of using the
WTO negotiations to engage in separatism.
</P>
<P>
   The dispute over what the WTO should call Taiwan underscores the
51-year split between the island and the mainland and China's
attempts to coax Taipei into unification. It also revives a debate
that has simmered for years in working groups negotiating terms for
Taiwan's entry to WTO and its predecessor, GATT.
</P>
<P>
   Taiwan applied to join the General Agreement on Tariffs and
Trade in 1990 as ''the customs territory of Taiwan, Penghu, Kinmen
and Matsu,'' thereby avoiding the questions of sovereignty and
statehood. Penghu, Kinmen and Matsu are small island groups under
Taiwan's control. GATT and now WTO rules allow regions in control
of their trade but without full statehood to join as separate
territories.
</P>
<P>
   Under a 1992 agreement that allowed separate working groups to
negotiate Chinese and Taiwanese bids, GATT members acknowledged
China's sovereignty claim to Taiwan and out of deference said
Taiwan could only join after Beijing.
</P>
<P>
   Sun, the Foreign Ministry spokesman, insisted that the 1992
agreement recognized Taiwan as a separate customs territory of
China.

<HEADLINE> Gulf War Study: No Illness Links  </HEADLINE>
By RANDOLPH E. SCHMID
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- There is insufficient evidence to link the
chronic illnesses suffered by some Gulf War veterans to a specific
cause, concludes a study by the Institute of Medicine.
</P>
<P>
   The agency studied the toxic nerve agent sarin; a drug used to
pretreat against exposure to nerve gas; depleted uranium; and
vaccines to prevent anthrax and botulism but was unable to find a
strong link between them and the illnesses.
</P>
<P>
   ''We'd like to give veterans and their families definitive
answers, but the evidence simply is not strong enough,'' Harold C.
Sox Jr., chairman of the committee that did the research, said in a
statement. Sox heads the department of medicine at the
Dartmouth-Hitchcock Medical Center in Lebanon, N.H.
</P>
<P>
   The Defense Department says an estimated 90,000 troops who
served in the Gulf War complain of illnesses such as fatigue, skin
rashes, headaches and muscle and joint pain.
</P>
<P>
   The Pentagon requested the study by the Institute of Medicine,
an arm of the National Academy of Sciences, an independent agency
chartered by Congress to provide scientific advice to the
government.
</P>
<P>
   The institute reviewed all available research on the ill
veterans and concluded that the studies done so far were
insufficient to support any final conclusion.
</P>
<P>
   A study published in May in the British Medical Journal
suggested a link between multiple vaccines given to soldiers
deployed in the Persian Gulf War and the unexplained illnesses.
That report was based on 923 British Gulf War veterans.
</P>
<P>
   The study by the Institute of Medicine noted that British
research has provided ''limited evidence of an association'' with
multiple vaccinations.
</P>
<P>
   But the new study added that 99 workers at Fort Detrick, Md.,
who received multiple vaccinations had been studied for 25 years
with no clinical symptoms.
</P>
<P>
   Overall, the institute said, the available evidence is
insufficient to show whether there is an impact on long-term health
from having multiple vaccinations.
</P>
<P>
   Other findings in the study:
</P>
<P>
   --Sarin: Low-level exposure to this nerve gas may have occurred
among troops when U.S. soldiers destroyed Iraqi munitions
stockpiles.
</P>
<P>
   A survey of 20,000 troops within 50 miles of the stockpiles
showed 99 percent reported no serious nerve illnesses, the report
noted. It said that while high doses of the chemical are known to
be dangerous, there is not enough information available on low
doses to reach any conclusion.
</P>
<P>
   --Pyridostigmine bromide is a drug used as a pretreatment for
exposure to nerve agents. It was provided to about 250,000
soldiers, but records don't indicate if they all took the pills.
</P>
<P>
   There were some cases of poisoning from taking high doses of the
pills, but the committee was unable to find evidence of long-term
effects from the amount normally used.
</P>
<P>
   --Depleted uranium, which has less radioactivity than naturally
occurring uranium, is used in tank armor and some ammunition.
</P>
<P>
   The committee said there were indications that the levels of
uranium involved in the war do not lead to lung cancer or kidney
damage. There was not enough evidence to determine if the uranium
could be linked to other diseases.
</P>
<P>
   --Anthrax vaccine was given to thousands of service members
during the Gulf War because of the fear that Iraq would launch a
biological attack. A later decision to give the vaccine to all U.S.
military personnel has provoked controversy, with some resisting
the vaccinations.
</P>
<P>
   The typical vaccination reactions of redness, swelling and
occasional fever were found, but the committee said there have not
been enough scientific studies done to determine if there is any
long-term adverse effect from the vaccine.
</P>
<P>
   --Botlinum vaccine is under investigation as a way to block the
dangerous toxins of the form of food poisoning known as botulism.
Again, the committee said there have not been sufficient studies to
determine any long-term hazard.

<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Tech stocks moved higher Thursday after a
two-day downturn, while blue chips fell on a handful of corporate
earnings warnings.
</P>
<P>
   In midmorning trading on Wall Street, the Dow Jones industrial
average was down 25.25 at 11,285.39. The Nasdaq composite index was
up 77.41 at 4,090.75, and the Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 index was up
8.62 at 1,500.87.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is a continuation of the rotation the market has become
accustomed to,'' said Bob Streed, senior vice president at Northern
Trust in Chicago. ''The money seems to flow back and forth.
Yesterday, investors took their money out of technology and put
into blue chips. Today, they're taking it out of blue chips and
putting it back into technology.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, tech stocks appeared to be having their best day so far
in a trading week abbreviated by the Labor Day holiday.
</P>
<P>
   Chipmaker Intel traded up $2.30 at $68 on the Nasdaq, after
tumbling for two days on an influential analyst's downgrade. Micron
Technology, another chip maker which was downgraded on Wednesday,
was up $3.69 to $72.44.
</P>
<P>
   DuPont, Campbell Soup, Circuit City Stores and May Department
Stores all warned their quarterly earnings would be flat or below
expectations.
</P>
<P>
   DuPont was down $4.44 at $42.56; Campbell was up 19 cents at
$25.06; Circuit City fell $1.19 to $26.56; and May was down 81
cents at $22.88.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts have been warning investors to expect flat or lower
earnings because of the slowdown in economic growth. The Federal
Reserve has hiked interest rates six times since last summer, and
recent data suggest the economy is indeed slowing.
</P>
<P>
   Advancing issues narrowly led decliners on the New York Stock
Exchange, where volume came to 308.65 million shares, compared to
314.39 million in the last session.
</P>
<P>
   The Russell 2000 index was up 2.06 at 538.38.
</P>
<P>
   Overseas, Japan's Nikkei stock average fell 0.32 percent. In
afternoon trading, Germany's DAX index was down .03 percent,
Britain's FT-SE 100 was down .25 percent, and France's CAC-40 was
down 0.30 percent.

Leaders of two U.S. black Muslim groups still preach unity
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHICAGO (AP) -- The heads of the Nation of Islam and the Muslim
American Society are repeating calls for unity between their
formerly hostile organizations.
</P>
<P>
   At the Muslim American Society's annual Labor Day weekend
conference its leader, Imam W. Deen Mohammed, smiled and embraced
the Nation of Islam's Minister Louis Farrakhan before a mostly
black audience of about 7,000.
</P>
<P>
   Farrakhan said, ''These tracks have been running parallel and
have now become a monorail going down one track for the glory of
Allah.... Today, we are determined to be one family. We are
determined to be a nation of Muslims.''
</P>
<P>
   Mohammed echoed Farrakhan's comments on unity and also urged
Muslims to improve relations with Jews and Christians.
</P>
<P>
   While Mohammed's society was meeting, the Islamic Society of
North America, made up largely of immigrant Muslims, held a much
larger convention in a nearby suburb. Mohammed was scheduled to
speak there but did not appear; Farrakhan was not invited.
</P>
<P>
   Mohammed moved his organization toward Muslim orthodoxy after
his father, Elijah Muhammad, died in 1975. Farrakhan broke with him
in 1978, reviving the Nation of Islam to perpetuate Elijah's racial
separatism and heterodox teachings. But Farrakhan has lately
downplayed those doctrines.
</P>
<P>
   In February, Mohammed appeared for the first time at the annual
Savior's Day celebration of Farrakhan's group.

West Virginia radio station responds to football prayer ban
</P>
<P>
   WAYNE, W.Va. (AP) -- Responding to the U.S. Supreme Court's ban
on officially organized prayers at football games, a radio station
announced plans to broadcast on-air prayers so the local high
school's public address system won't be used.
</P>
<P>
   The broadcast by WRVC-FM and AM doesn't violate the court's
ruling in a Texas case, said Spring Valley High School Principal
Barry Scragg. ''If they don't want to hear the prayer, they can
turn the radio off.''
</P>
<P>
   ''Personally, I hope everybody comes with a radio and listens,''
he added.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think the Supreme Court ruling is asinine,'' said radio
station manager Mike Kirtner. ''I doubt that anyone in Wayne County
would object to the prayer. It's part of their tradition.''

Four Episcopal priests quit to join conservative group
</P>
<P>
   DENVER (AP) -- Four priests have quit their Colorado parishes
since July 15 to start new congregations under a conservative
mission that views the Episcopal Church as too liberal, in
particular on homosexuality.
</P>
<P>
   Jan Nunley, a spokeswoman at Episcopal Church headquarters in
New York City, said the national denomination doesn't know how many
priests have joined the new mission and hasn't decided what to do
about them.
</P>
<P>
   The Coloradans are aligned with two Americans consecrated as
U.S. missionary bishops by overseas Anglicans. Charles Murphy, head
of the First Promise organization, serves under the archbishop of
Rwanda, and John Rodgers of the Association of Anglican
Congregations on Mission reports to the archbishop in Singapore.
</P>
<P>
   The bishops' consecrations are considered illicit by the
Episcopal Church and the head of the worldwide Anglican Communion,
Archbishop of Canterbury George L. Carey.

Wisconsin's first Hindu temple opens
</P>
<P>
   PEWAUKEE, Wis. (AP) -- After four years and $4.5 million dollars,
Wisconsin's Hindus finally have their first temple, just off
Interstate 94, less than an hour's drive from Milwaukee and half a
world from India where 90 percent of the world's Hindus live.
</P>
<P>
   The temple has been in the works since 1996. Until now the 1,000
families of Indian ancestry in the state have had to visit temples
in the Chicago area.
</P>
<P>
   Suhas Pawar, who designed the temple, said it won't be complete
until a dome is added at the top. At present ''it is like a church
without a steeple,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Also, paintings of gods are filling in until statues are
installed. In a second phase of construction, artists will travel
from India to construct smaller, ornate temples for 11 idols.

China says it suppressed an illegal cult, not an underground
church
</P>
<P>
   BEIJING (AP) -- China says 105 people arrested in what human
rights campaigners consider a crackdown on an underground Christian
church were really members of an illegal cult.
</P>
<P>
   The Hong Kong-based Information Center for Human Rights and
Democracy reported that 130 members of the Fangcheng church were
rounded up Aug. 23 in Henan province, including three U.S.
evangelists from the California-based Chinese Vineyard Church
Fellowship who were later deported.
</P>
<P>
   But in the foreign ministry's first comment on the incident, a
spokesman said, ''There is no such thing as the so-called Fangcheng
religion in China.'' He said those arrested follow a ''national
scope church'' that had been banned by the regime.
</P>
<P>
   The meeting ''seriously affected the normal production and lives
of people in the area'' and was broken up by police acting on
public complaints, he said.
</P>
<P>
   China is increasingly using anti-cult laws, tightened last year
during a crackdown on the Falun Gong spiritual movement, to target
underground churches and meditation groups that officials view as
threats.
</P>
<P>
   Fangcheng church founder Zhang Rongliang was sentenced to two
years in a labor camp last December for leading a cult. The group
is one of many clandestine Christian ''house churches'' that cannot
worship openly because the atheistic regime forbids meetings
outside state-sanctioned churches.

Americans call for reopening of Orthodox seminary in Turkey
</P>
<P>
   ISTANBUL, Turkey (AP) -- Visiting Greek-Americans called for the
reopening of the Theological School of Halki as they gathered in
the empty halls of the Eastern Orthodox island campus, shut by
Turkish authorities 29 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   The visitors, who expressed sorrow and outrage, were members of
Archons of America, a group that supports the Istanbul-based
Ecumenical Patriarchate.
</P>
<P>
   ''It is our prayer, hope, dream that this sacred school will
reopen,'' said Metropolitan Maximos of Pittsburgh, Pa., a Halki
graduate. He said the future of the patriarchate depends on the
reopening.
</P>
<P>
   Ecumenical Patriarch Bartholomew I, the spiritual leader of the
Eastern Orthodox worldwide, has long lobbied for Halki's reopening.
</P>
<P>
   ''Turkey will never become a full-fledged member of the European
Union if, for example, they don't open this school,'' said James
Costaras of New York. Turkey became a candidate to join the union
last year but EU officials have expressed concern about its human
rights record.
</P>
<P>
   ''The United States very strongly believes that this seminary
should be reopened,'' said Frank Urbancic, U.S. consul general in
Istanbul. ''It is not an issue we are prepared to drop.''

Wheaton College rated the nation's most devout campus
</P>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- In the opinion of 59,000 students who rated
campus life at their own schools, the nation's most devout campus
is Wheaton College, an evangelical institution in Illinois,
followed by Brigham Young University (Mormon), the University of
Dallas (Roman Catholic), Grove City College (Presbyterian) and
Baylor University (Baptist).
</P>
<P>
   So reports the latest edition of ''The Best 331 Colleges'' from
Princeton Review, which includes the students' evaluations and more
conventional data.
</P>
<P>
   Wheaton was ranked lowest in consumption of hard liquor and
beer, and just behind Grove City on least marijuana use.

Vassar, Lewis and Clark, Reed, Macalaster, Wesleyan and Bard.

<HEADLINE> Former Bangladesh Premier Gets Bail  </HEADLINE>
By FARID HOSSAIN
<TEXT>
<P>
   DHAKA, Bangladesh (AP) -- A judge granted bail Thursday to former
Prime Minister Khaleda Zia, who has been charged with taking $35
million in kickbacks in the purchase of two planes for Bangladesh's
state-owned airlines.
</P>
<P>
   The charges involve two Airbus 310-300 passenger planes bought
by the Biman airlines from France's Airbus Industrie in 1995, when
Zia was prime minister.
</P>
<P>
   The anti-corruption bureau accused Zia's finance minister,
Saifur Rahman, and eight other former government officials of
helping her misappropriate $35 million in the purchase. They also
were granted bail Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Zia, who leads the main opposition Bangladesh Nationalist Party,
did not speak in court. But her lawyer Moudud Ahmed denied the
corruption charges and said they had been made up to undermine her
political image.
</P>
<P>
   Zia leads an alliance of four opposition parties campaigning for
the resignation of Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina's 4-year-old
government and for general elections ahead of the 2001 schedule.
</P>
<P>
   The alliance accuses Hasina's government of corruption,
incompetence and harassment of political opponents, a charge the
prime minister denies.
</P>
<P>
   Cheered by nearly 3,000 supporters, Zia drove in an open jeep to
the Metropolitan Sessions Court of Judge Ahmed Jamil Mostafa, who
accepted one surety in the amount of $2,000. The street procession
of her supporters created huge traffic jams in central Dhaka, the
capital.
</P>
<P>
   Zia sat on an armchair close to the wooden dock during the
half-hour court proceeding, after complaining of pain in her legs.
</P>
<P>
   Outside the courtroom, Zia's supporters scuffled with riot
police and chanted: ''Down with the corrupt government.'' No
injuries were reported.
</P>
<P>
   The corruption charges against Zia were filed in the court
Tuesday by the Bureau of Anti-Corruption after a two-year
investigation.
</P>
<P>
   The two planes in the latest kickback charges cost at total of
$150 million, at least $58 million more than the prevailing price
for the aircraft, according to the prosecution.
</P>
<P>
   ''We have found that Kuwait Airlines bought two similar Airbus
planes at $92 million the same year,'' said Harunur Rashid, an
investigator.
</P>
<P>
   Judge Mostafa sent the case to Dhaka District and Sessions Court
for future hearings. If convicted, Zia could be jailed for up to 10
years.
</P>
<P>
   Zia was granted bail in 1998 in two other cases of graft and
abuse of power filed by anti-corruption investigators after she
lost power in 1996.

   KINSHASA, Congo (AP) -- Soldiers from different units engaged in
a deadly hours-long gunfight at the main military base in this
Central African capital city, officials said Thursday, forcing
civilians to flee the compound.
</P>
<P>
   No official death toll was made public, but military and

   ''A group of undisciplined elements opened fire on a police

Laurent Kabila, said on national television. Some of Kabila's
bodyguards live at Camp Tshatshi, but it was unclear whether they
were involved in the fighting.
</P>
<P>
   Kapend said life at camp Tshatshi had returned to normal by late
Wednesday. Witnesses said civilians in the camp, mostly soldiers'
families, fled on foot with whatever belongings they could carry,
including electrical appliances.
</P>
<P>
   Solange Ngulu, a mother of four living in a shack community at
the edge of the camp, said she feared for her family's safety.
</P>
<P>
   ''The shooting went on and on for hours,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Camp Tshatshi was the scene of some of the earliest fighting
when Congo's civil war broke out in August 1998.
</P>
<P>
   The war in Congo, formerly known as Zaire, broke out when rebels
backed by one-time Kabila allies Rwanda and Uganda turned against
his regime, accusing it of corruption and of harboring Hutu
militiamen who fled Rwanda after committing genocide there in 1994.

<HEADLINE> Colombia Cops Find Trafficking Tool  </HEADLINE>
By ANDREW SELSKY
<TEXT>
<P>
   FACATATIVA, Colombia (AP) -- Police raiding a warehouse in this
rural town stumbled upon a most unusual drug trafficking tool: A
100-foot-long, half-built submarine they say would have been able
to ship up to 200 tons of cocaine below the ocean's surface.
</P>
<P>
   Colombian authorities displayed their find on Thursday, a day
after they discovered it along with documents in Russian in this
town a half-hour's drive outside Bogota. Police and journalists
crawled through the snub-nosed submarine's three unattached reddish
metal sections and gazed in wonder at its size and sophisticated
design.
</P>
<P>
   ''It was between 30 and 40 percent completed and had its engine
room ready,'' Colombian National Police director Gen. Ernesto
Gilibert told reporters. ''The technology is advanced and the
workmanship of high quality.''
</P>
<P>
   Colombian traffickers have used smaller, simpler ''mini-subs''
on at least two occasions in the past, Gilibert said. But even
seasoned anti-drug officials said they were stunned by the vessel
discovered here.
</P>
<P>
   ''In 32 years I've never seen anything like this,'' Leo
Arreguin, the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration director in
Colombia, told reporters.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is huge,'' he said. ''We're talking about being able to
load up to 200 tons of cocaine in this submarine.''
</P>
<P>
   The submarine's discovery marks a new chapter in innovation for
Colombia's ingenious drug cartels, which have previously used
refitted commercial airliners and oceangoing freighters to ship
cocaine to the United States and other parts of the world.
</P>
<P>
   The simple brick warehouse, complete with closed-circuit
television monitors, was empty at the time of the raid.
</P>
<P>
   It was strewn with workbenches, power-tools and gas canisters
used for welding. No-smoking signs hung on the walls. Tools left
haphazardly on shelves in the submarine's midsection suggested that
workers had made a hasty getaway.
</P>
<P>
   Arreguin said documents discovered at the site indicate not only
probable Russian ties to the submarine but that two Americans may
have also been involved. He did not elaborate on the possible U.S.
connection. No arrests had been made.
</P>
<P>
   Facatativa is in located roughly 7,500 feet above sea level in
Colombia's eastern Andean region.
</P>
<P>
   ''We think they were going to send it to the coast by truck in
these three sections,'' said National Police Sgt. Samuel Alvarez.
''The computerized navigation system was probably being built
elsewhere.''
</P>
<P>
   Colombia exports 90 percent of the world's cocaine and is a
growing heroin supplier. Traffickers have become increasingly
expert at getting the drugs past intense air, sea and land
interdiction efforts.

<HEADLINE> Solomon Islands Peace Talks Begin  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   HONIARA, Solomon Islands (AP) -- After a string of postponements,
peace talks aimed at ending nearly two years of ethnic bloodshed on
the Solomon Islands began Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Deputy Prime Minister Allan Kemakeza said the country stands
''on the threshold of changing our present situation of suffering
and sadness into a future position of hope for joy, peace, progress
and prosperity.''
</P>
<P>
   At least 60 people died in sporadic fighting on this Pacific
archipelago 1,600 miles east of Sydney, Australia, before a
cease-fire was signed in July.
</P>
<P>
   The conflict pitted the Isatabus, indigenous to the main island
of Guadalcanal, against immigrants from neighboring Malaita island.
</P>
<P>
   Fighting began 21 months ago after Isatabus forced out 20,000
Malaitans, saying the immigrants were taking jobs and land. It
escalated June 5 when fighters angered by the expulsion seized the
nation's capital, Honiara, on Guadalcanal.
</P>
<P>
   Kemakeza said government negotiators would focus on the origins
of the conflict, land issues and a possible amnesty for fighters.
</P>
<P>
   The premier of Guadalcanal province, Ezekiel Alebua, appealed to
negotiators to ''cast aside any emotions, feelings of hatred,
desire of vengeance and arrogance.'' Alebua led a 16-member
delegation that included six Isatabu commanders.
</P>
<P>
   Isatabu spokesman Henry Tobani said peace talks should address
''injustices toward Guadalcanal people on matters pertaining to
land, migration ... and employment issues.''
</P>
<P>
   Malaita province's deputy premier, Benjamin Harohau, said his
negotiators would seek compensation and work toward reconciliation
and national unity.
</P>
<P>
   Malaita rebel spokesman Andrew Nori said his side would try ''to
re-establish trust among ourselves and to search diligently for
peace.''
</P>
<P>
   After opening ceremonies, talks were adjourned until Sunday.
They are being held on the New Zealand naval frigate Te Kaha.

<HEADLINE> Atty. Doubts Fair Trial for Berenson  </HEADLINE>
By KEVIN GRAY
<TEXT>
<P>
   LIMA, Peru (AP) -- After meeting with Peruvian judicial
officials, a lawyer for the family of Lori Berenson says it's
unlikely the American woman could receive a fair trial in Peru.
</P>
<P>
   ''We plead for a fair trial for Lori -- if, and only if, it's
found that another trial can be lawfully held, which we do no
believe is possible,'' Ramsey Clark, a longtime legal adviser to
the Berensons, said late Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Berenson, 30, was convicted of treason by a military tribunal in
1996 for allegedly helping a rebel group, the Tupac Amaru
Revolutionary Movement, plot an attack on the Peruvian Congress.
She denies the charges.
</P>
<P>
   Berenson's mother, Rhoda, arrived in Lima with Clark over the
weekend, several days after the government revoked a life sentence
handed down by hooded judges and granted Berenson a new, civilian
trial.
</P>
<P>
   But Clark complained Peruvian officials were proceeding with
Berenson's new case while she is without legal representation. He
said the prosecutor has begun questioning witnesses and has not
allowed the family access to files detailing the charges or any of
the witness testimony.
</P>
<P>
   Clark said he was petitioning the judge to suspend the
proceedings until the family has time to prepare Berenson's
defense.
</P>
<P>
   Peruvian President Alberto Fujimori has said Berenson's sentence
was overturned because of new evidence showing Berenson was not a
leader of the rebel group known by its initials MRTA, as she was
charged when convicted of treason four years ago.
</P>
<P>
   In a radio interview taped in March 1999 but aired for the first
time Wednesday, the New York native declared her innocence, and
also asserted a fair trial was nearly impossible in Peru.
</P>
<P>
   ''With ... such negative publicity that I've had in Peru, I
would never get a fair trial,'' Berenson told Pacifica Radio in an
exclusive interview taped while she was held in the Socbabaya
Prison in southern Peru. Last week, she was moved to a
maximum-security prison in Lima.
</P>
<P>
   She said she is ''innocent of the charges they made against
me.''
</P>
<P>
   Berenson's case is now being examined and prepared by a
prosecutor and a judge in closed-door hearings that could last up
to 50 days. Once the evidence and witness testimonies have been
collected and reviewed, a higher prosecutor will formally charge
Berenson. She will then appear in an open trial before a
three-judge panel.
</P>
<P>
   A conviction of terrorism by a civilian court carries a minimum
20-year-sentence.
</P>
<P>
   Berenson's parents have led a campaign for her release,
condemning harsh conditions she has lived under in Peruvian prisons
and asserting their daughter was never involved in any rebel
activities, but was instead in Peru working as a journalist.
</P>
<P>
   After meeting with her daughter Wednesday, Rhoda Berenson said
she found her in good spirits, and still ''maintaining her sense of
humor.''
</P>
<P>
   She also added: ''She is still maintaining her innocence. She
has never been a member of the MRTA and she has never associated
with any terrorist acts.''

<HEADLINE> Paksitan Bomb Kills 6 in Lahore  </HEADLINE>
By MUNIR AHMED
<TEXT>
<P>
   LAHORE, Pakistan (AP) -- A bomb ripped through a crowded market
in the eastern Pakistani border city of Lahore during the evening
rush hour Thursday, killing six people and injuring at least 33,
police said.
</P>
<P>
   The bomb exploded in Dharampura market in the eastern part of
the city, about two miles from Pakistan's border with India. No
group has claimed responsibility for the explosion, the fourth in
the city this year. Police said they made no immediate arrests.
</P>
<P>
   The crude homemade bomb, which weighed 4.4 pounds, damaged
several shops, shattered glass and caused a stampede. The bomb was
tied to a motorbike, which was destroyed in the explosion,
witnesses said. At least six people were critically injured,
doctors at a state-run hospital said. Two of those killed were
women.
</P>
<P>
   ''I heard a deafening explosion while shopping,'' said Ghulam
Mustafa, 42, who sustained head injuries. ''I don't remember what
happened next.''
</P>
<P>
   Another victim, Mohammed Nazeer, 18, who had burns on 30 percent
of his body, saw flames leaping as the explosion rocked the market.
</P>
<P>
   ''I fell from my bicycle. ... I don't where it is now,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Outside a city hospital's emergency ward, men and women wailed
and cried. Ali Imran, 22, said he carried his injured teen-age
brother to the hospital in a taxi.
</P>
<P>
   ''We both went out together. I stopped at a shop to buy milk,
while my brother went ahead,'' said a visibly shaken Imran.
''Moments later I heard a bang. ... I found my brother among the
victims. He has severe burn injuries. May God protect him.''
</P>
<P>
   On Sunday, a bomb explosion at a bus stop in Lahore killed three
people and injured 10 others. Police Inspector Mohammed Asghar said
similar explosive devices were used in both bombings.
</P>
<P>
   In recent months, there have been a series of bomb explosions in
major Pakistani cities in which scores of people have been killed
and many more injured. The Pakistani government routinely blames
neighboring India for acts of sabotage, while India accuses
Pakistan of fomenting terrorism.

<HEADLINE> Arafat Rejects Jerusalem Compromise  </HEADLINE>
By KARIN LAUB
<TEXT>
<P>
   UNITED NATIONS (AP) -- Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat has
rejected U.S. compromise proposals on Jerusalem, casting a pall
over what may be President Clinton's final push to secure a Mideast
peace deal.
</P>
<P>
   Sounding a similar tone, Israel Prime Minister Ehud Barak said
Thursday, ''Some of the ideas he has raised are beyond what we
believe we can accept.''
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, he said, ''If Chairman Arafat is ready to take
Clinton's ideas as the basis for negotiations, we will be ready to
contemplate it and to enter into such negotiations.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton said Israel and the Palestinians remain committed to
reaching an agreement. However, with his latest mediation effort
unsuccessful -- he met back-to-back Wednesday night with the Israeli
and Palestinian leaders -- it was not clear what his next move could
be.
</P>
<P>
   Barak is staying in New York through the weekend, but Arafat is
expected to head home Friday to chair a Palestine Liberation
Organization conference that is to set a date for proclaiming
Palestinian independence.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think they basically went well,'' Clinton said of his talks
Wednesday with Barak and Arafat. ''They understand the time is
short.''
</P>
<P>
   Barak noted that Congress was scheduled to adjourn in October.
''Since there is a clear need to mobilize major sums of money in
order to support such an agreement being glued together, I believe
that time is running out in terms of being able to solve it,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   State Department spokesman Richard Boucher said Dennis Ross, the
senior U.S. mediator on the Mideast, was holding separate meetings
Thursday with Israeli and Palestinian officials.
</P>
<P>
   At the heart of the conflict are rival Israeli and Palestinian
claims to a 36-acre walled compound in Jerusalem's Old City, part
of the traditionally Arab eastern sector of the city.
</P>
<P>
   The site is known to Jews as the Temple Mount, home to the
holiest of Jewish temples. Muslims revere it as Haram as-Sharif, or
Noble Sanctuary, home to two mosques that mark the spot where
prophet Mohammed ascended to heaven.
</P>
<P>
   In Wednesday evening's 90-minute meeting with Clinton, on the
sidelines of the U.N. Millennium Summit, Arafat told the president
he would not drop demands for Palestinian sovereignty over all of
east Jerusalem, which was captured by Israel in the 1967 Mideast
war.
</P>
<P>
   ''We were clear that we are not ready to make concessions on the
issue of Palestinian sovereignty in Jerusalem and on the issue of
the Haram as-Sharif,'' said Palestinian negotiator Nabil Shaath.
</P>
<P>
   Arafat told the president that his hands are tied and that any
compromise on Jerusalem would be met by shock and outrage in the
Arab and Islamic world.
</P>
<P>
   In talks with Secretary of State Madeleine Albright, the
Palestinian leader played down Jewish religious claims to the holy
site. Palestinian officials described the session as difficult, and
said voices were raised at times.
</P>
<P>
   Shaath said there was a possibility that Clinton would hold
another round of separate talks with Barak and Arafat, but that no
time has been set. He said lower-level negotiations, in the
presence of a U.S. mediator, might resume in the region next week.
</P>
<P>
   Israel has said it was willing to consider creative ideas on how
to share Jerusalem, but only after Arafat has signaled some
willingness to compromise.
</P>
<P>
   ''With a little bit of good will, of creativity and flexibility
on the Palestinian side, I believe the Jerusalem issue may be
settled,'' Israel's deputy defense minister, Ephraim Sneh, told The
Associated Press in Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
   A U.S. compromise proposal, according to Palestinian officials,
would have given Israel sovereignty over the Western Wall, one of
the remnants of the temple, while the Palestinians would have
control over the mosques. The remaining areas in the walled
compound would have been placed under divine sovereignty.
</P>
<P>
   Palestinian negotiator Yasser Abed Rabbo said Thursday that
divine sovereignty and other compromise proposals, such as
deferring a deal on Jerusalem, were no longer on the table.
</P>
<P>
   The inconclusive high-level meetings came just a week before the
Sept. 13 deadline for a final Israeli-Palestinian peace treaty.
</P>
<P>
   Arafat has reserved the right to proclaim statehood, even
without Israel's blessing, on that day, but has said a final
decision is up to the PLO's top policy-making body, which is to
convene Saturday. Arafat has hinted that the PLO council was likely
to delay a statehood proclamation until later this year.
</P>
<P>
   White House spokesman Joe Lockhart dismissed Sept. 13 as ''an
artificial date.''

<HEADLINE> New Gulf War Study Inconclusive  </HEADLINE>
By RANDOLPH E. SCHMID
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- A comprehensive new report on the chronic
illnesses suffered by some Gulf War veterans was unable to link
their problems to a specific cause.
</P>
<P>
   The Institute of Medicine studied the research done on several
possible causes for the veterans' syndrome: the toxic nerve agent
sarin; a drug used to pretreat against exposure to nerve gas;
depleted uranium; and vaccines to prevent anthrax and botulism.
</P>
<P>
   But the scientists said Thursday they could not find enough
evidence to link the illnesses to any single cause.
</P>
<P>
   ''We'd like to give veterans and their families definitive
answers, but the evidence simply is not strong enough,'' said
Harold C. Sox Jr., chairman of the committee that did the research.
Sox heads the department of medicine at the Dartmouth-Hitchcock
Medical Center in Lebanon, N.H.
</P>
<P>
   The Defense Department says an estimated 90,000 troops who
served in the Gulf War complain of illnesses such as fatigue, skin
rashes, headaches and muscle and joint pain.
</P>
<P>
   The Pentagon requested the study by the institute, an arm of the
National Academy of Sciences, an independent agency chartered by
Congress to provide scientific advice to the government.
</P>
<P>
   A study published in May in the British Medical Journal
suggested a link between multiple vaccines given to soldiers
deployed in the Persian Gulf War and the unexplained illnesses.
That report was based on 923 British Gulf War veterans.
</P>
<P>
   The study by the Institute of Medicine noted that British
research has provided ''limited evidence of an association'' with
multiple vaccinations.
</P>
<P>
   But it noted that 99 workers at Fort Detrick, Md., who received
multiple vaccinations had been studied for 25 years with no
clinical symptoms.
</P>
<P>
   Overall, the institute said, the available evidence is
insufficient to show whether the multiple vaccinations have an
effect on long-term health.
</P>
<P>
   Other findings in the study:
</P>
<P>
   --Sarin: Low-level exposure to this nerve gas may have occurred
among troops when U.S. soldiers destroyed Iraqi munitions
stockpiles.
</P>
<P>
   A survey of 20,000 troops within 50 miles of the stockpiles
showed 99 percent reported no serious nerve illnesses, the report
noted. It said that while high doses of the chemical are known to
be dangerous, there is not enough information available on low
doses to reach any conclusion.
</P>
<P>
   --Pyridostigmine bromide is a drug used as a pretreatment for
exposure to nerve agents. It was provided to about 250,000
soldiers, but records don't indicate if they all took the pills.
</P>
<P>
   There were some cases of poisoning from taking high doses of the
pills, but the committee was unable to find evidence of long-term
effects from the amount normally used.
</P>
<P>
   --Depleted uranium, which has less radioactivity than naturally
occurring uranium, is used in tank armor and some ammunition.
</P>
<P>
   The committee said there were indications that the levels of
uranium involved in the war do not lead to lung cancer or kidney
damage. There was not enough evidence to determine if the uranium
could be linked to other diseases.
</P>
<P>
   --Anthrax vaccine was given to thousands of service members
during the Gulf War because of the fear that Iraq would launch a
biological attack. A later decision to give the vaccine to all U.S.
military personnel has provoked controversy, with some resisting
the vaccinations.
</P>
<P>
   The typical vaccination reactions of redness, swelling and
occasional fever were found, but the committee said there have not
been enough scientific studies done to determine if there is any
long-term adverse effect from the vaccine.
</P>
<P>
   --Botulinum vaccine is under investigation as a way to block the
dangerous toxins of the form of food poisoning known as botulism.
Again, the committee said there have not been sufficient studies to
determine any long-term hazard.

<HEADLINE> Buffalo teachers go on strike, thousands of students stay home  </HEADLINE>
By CAROLYN THOMPSON
<TEXT>
<P>
   BUFFALO, N.Y. (AP) - Buffalo's teachers went on strike Thursday
after union executives rejected the Board of Education's contract
offer, forcing the cancellation of what would have been the second
day of school for 47,000 students.
</P>
<P>
   While parents had to scramble for child-care arrangements,
District Superintendent Marion Canedo said students who reported
for school would be cared for.
</P>
<P>
   Union and district officials said negotiators were at odds over
wages, health care concessions, and a provision to contract with
social agencies outside the district to serve troubled students.
</P>
<P>
   ''This move is something that we've been forced into,'' Buffalo
Teachers Federation President Philip Rumore said in announcing the
strike. ''This is not something that we do lightly.''
</P>
<P>
   Neither side expressed a desire to end talks, however, and
negotiators were expected back at the bargaining table Thursday
evening.
</P>
<P>
   District lawyers, meanwhile, made plans to go to state Supreme
Court Friday to ask Justice Kevin Dillon to enforce an injunction
he granted the board on Wednesday forbidding the teachers to
strike.
</P>
<P>
   ''Our first goal is to get the teachers back in the classroom
and get the schools open again,'' Board President Paul Buchanan
said.
</P>
<P>
   The teachers stand to lose two days pay for each day on strike
and could face jail time for defying the injunction. State law
prohibits teachers from striking.
</P>
<P>
   Mayor Anthony Masiello called the strike ''an unconscionable
act.''
</P>
<P>
   ''It's very punitive and very damaging to the children and the
families and it's totally uncalled for,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Masiello and Buchanan criticized the timing of the announcement,
which was made after many students had already left for school.
</P>
<P>
   ''Kids were on the bus, they were at the corner stops. To me, it
is totally irresponsible,'' Buchanan said. ''It is personally
despicable.''
</P>
<P>
   Throughout the city, parents unaware of the strike walked with
children to schools and found pockets of picketing teachers.
</P>
<P>
   ''I am highly upset,'' said Sophia Gonzalez, 16, as she headed
home from Grover Cleveland High School, where she is a sophomore.
''They said (Wednesday) it was a new school year and our grades
were going to go up. We can't do it if we're sitting at home.''
</P>
<P>
   The district's 3,800 teachers, meanwhile, indicated they were
unwilling to continue to work under the terms of a contract that
expired in June 1999.
</P>
<P>
   ''We're all very sad. We're sad for us and sad for the
children,'' said reading teacher Sue Webster as she picketed
outside School No. 3. ''There's not one of us that's happy to be
here. We'd all much rather be inside.''
</P>
<P>
   Board of Education spokesman Andrew Maddigan accused union
officials of taking the law into their own hands. He said the union
could have asked for a fact-finder or declared an impasse and asked
for an arbitrator when negotiations soured.
</P>
<P>
   ''Instead of these legal remedies, they chose a clearly illegal
alternative. It shows a disregard for students,'' Maddigan said.
</P>
<P>
   Rumore said teachers were insulted by a four-year contract offer
that included no pay raise the first year and raises of 2 percent
in each of the subsequent years.
</P>
<P>
   Maddigan countered that the union did not take into account
built-in pay increments of 1 to 5 percent. With the increment and
the $30 million in salary increases provided by the contract, he
said, teachers would see their salaries rise an average of 3.5
percent each year over the life of the contract.
</P>
<P>
   While the strike was citywide on Thursday, Rumore left open the
possibility that it would be scaled back to so-called ''rotating
strikes'' - in which teachers at specifically targeted schools
would fail to report. In that case, the schools would remain open,
Maddigan said, and the affected schools would be staffed by
administrators, virtually all of whom were former teachers.
</P>
<P>
   The specter of a strike called up a long, complicated and ugly
chapter of the city's history.
</P>
<P>
   Buffalo teachers struck illegally for 13 days in 1976. Under the
state's Taylor law, they were hit with stiff fines which then went
toward financing salary raises negotiated after the strike, a move
that infuriated many teachers.
</P>
<P>
   ''I went through this in 1976. It was a bad experience then,
it's a bad experience now,'' said physical education teacher Frank
Christopher as he picketed outside School No. 3.
</P>
<P>
   After the 1976 strike, then-Buffalo Teacher Federation President
Tim Pisa went to jail for 28 days.

   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Eager to use Arizona Sen. John McCain's
popularity to their advantage, Senate Republican leaders want the
one-time GOP presidential hopeful to play a visible role in the
party's year-end budget battle against President Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   Ever the maverick, McCain laid out his own requirements Thursday
for joining that fray, saying he wants to play such a role --
provided that final spending bills have no pork-barrel projects for
lawmakers' home districts. Such items are a longtime staple of the
bills, especially in election years, and McCain normally votes
against many of the spending measures after distributing long,
specific lists of pork to which he objects.
</P>
<P>
   ''Obviously, I'd like to help,'' McCain said in an interview.
''But we have to go into it with clean hands. No pork, no
legislative riders.''
</P>
<P>
   Riders are provisions attached to spending bills that change the
law. They are frequently used for items that are too controversial
to survive as separate legislation, like disputes over the
environment or abortion rights.
</P>
<P>
   Though his bid for the GOP presidential nomination failed this
year, McCain remains one of the country's most popular Republicans.
He has built an image of an independent, principled voice against
wasteful spending and the political influence of special interests.
</P>
<P>
   Many Republicans on Capitol Hill say that could make McCain an
effective messenger for his party in this fall's end-of-session
budget fight, in which Clinton wants to spend roughly $20 billion
more than the GOP prefers. Clinton has prevailed in the annual
budget face-offs by winning billions in extra spending each year.
</P>
<P>
   ''He helps us because he has credibility in the country,'' Sen.
Phil Gramm, R-Texas, said of McCain.
</P>
<P>
   Should McCain participate, he might also help deflect
conservatives' criticism of GOP leaders that is often prompted by
the year-end budget fights. Conservatives have long complained that
the bargaining results in too much spending -- a charge that might
be muffled if McCain blesses the deals that emerge.
</P>
<P>
   McCain's role remains unclear. He and Senate Majority Leader
Trent Lott, R-Miss., have briefly discussed the idea, and both said
they need to talk further.
</P>
<P>
   Lott said he envisioned McCain attending some meetings between
congressional budget writers and administration officials.
</P>
<P>
   ''I want him to see firsthand how irresponsible the
administration is in many negotiations,'' Lott said.
</P>
<P>
   He also said he wanted McCain's support for the short-term
spending measures Congress is sure to pass to keep federal agencies
functioning beyond Oct. 1, when the new federal fiscal year begins.
Some of the remaining 11 spending bills -- covering dozens of
departments and agencies -- are certain to remain unfinished by
then, triggering the need for stopgap legislation.
</P>
<P>
   Lott and McCain have long had an often nettlesome relationship.
McCain has frequently belittled legislative pork for Lott,
including $1.5 billion for an amphibious assault ship -- not
requested by the Navy -- to be built in the Mississippian's hometown
of Pascagoula
</P>
<P>
   McCain has also departed from GOP leadership positions by
forcing debate on overhauling campaign finance laws and on
penalizing the tobacco industry. Lott endorsed George W. Bush
during the GOP presidential race.
</P>
<P>
   Following surgery last month to remove cancerous growths from
his temple and arm, McCain has limited his hours this week as the
Senate returned from its August recess. He said he expects to be at
full speed next week.

<HEADLINE> Turkey Police Bar Gays From Resort  </HEADLINE>
By HARMONIE TOROS
<TEXT>
<P>
   ISTANBUL, Turkey (AP) -- Passengers on a gay-oriented cruise
expressed anger and disappointment and Turkish officials scrambled
to apologize Thursday, a day after police barred the tourists from
visiting the ancient ruins of Ephesus.
</P>
<P>
   ''I haven't seen anything like this anywhere,'' said Bruno
Gideon of Toronto, a cruise passenger. ''I didn't think a country
like Turkey would act like this. I still don't understand.''
</P>
<P>
   The cruise liner Olympic Voyager was taking 800 passengers, many
from the United States, on a seven-day tour with stops in Egypt,
Israel and Greece. On Wednesday, the cruise stopped at the Turkish
Aegean port of Kusadasi and passengers boarded buses for Ephesus,
which draws thousands of tourists each year.
</P>
<P>
   After allowing several groups to leave, police turned back at
least two other buses. The sudden change apparently came after they
realized the passengers were all homosexuals, the tourists and
members of the tour's crew said.
</P>
<P>
   Police also chased after buses headed from the cruise liner to
the Ephesus. They caught one in the town of Selcuk, some two miles
from the Ephesus ruins, and sent it back to the cruise liner, said
Erkunt Oner of Seamer Tour Agency, which organized the land tours.
</P>
<P>
   ''When we got back, a guy from the ship just said 'Get on the
ship as fast as you can,''' said Ken Damon from Tucson, Ariz.
</P>
<P>
   Damon said he had planned to return to Kusadasi for a two-week
vacation after the cruise. ''But we don't want to be in a country
that doesn't respect us,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Although gay artists, singers and belly dancers are popular in
Muslim Turkey, homosexuality is still taboo and gays complain that
they are often discriminated against, especially by police.
</P>
<P>
   ''All they said was 'No pass,''' said Edward Timblyn of Houston.
''I was disappointed, being stuck on the ship all day.''
</P>
<P>
   The mayor of Kusadasi and other Turkish authorities tried to
make amends Thursday, arguing that local police acted on their own.
</P>
<P>
   ''We were not able to receive a clear explanation from police
for their action. They only said they were obeying instructions
from the Interior Ministry,'' said Can Tekmen, spokesman for the
mayor of Kusadasi.
</P>
<P>
   But Mithat Dumanli, a ministry spokesman, said he was unaware of
any orders from the ministry.
</P>
<P>
   ''In the end, the mayor went to the ship to apologize,'' Tekmen
said. ''This is not good publicity for Kusadasi or for Turkey. At
the moment, we need all the tourists we can get.''
</P>
<P>
   Tourism Minister Erkan Mumcu also tried to diffuse tensions.
</P>
<P>
   ''We are not in a position to make judgments about peoples'
sexual preferences,'' Mumcu was quoted as saying by the Anatolia
news agency. ''They are in Istanbul now, and I think they will end
their visit without meeting any more problems.''
</P>
<P>
   U.S. Embassy spokesman Jess Baily said the embassy had brought
the case to the attention of Turkish authorities and ''was pleased
with their response thereafter.''
</P>
<P>
   Cody Hamilton of Durham, N.C., who was among those whose bus
made it through to Ephesus, was relieved that authorities had
apologized to his group.
</P>
<P>
   ''The fact that this kind of ignorance is not tolerated by
higher authorities is very important,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the passengers, including some tourists from the
Netherlands and Britain, toured Istanbul before their scheduled
departure for Athens.

<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- High-tech stocks moved higher Thursday after a
two-day downturn, while blue chips fell following another spate of
corporate earnings warnings.
</P>
<P>
   In early afternoon trading on Wall Street, the Nasdaq composite
index was up 67.00 at 4,080.34
</P>
<P>
   The Dow Jones industrial average was down 19.70 at 11,290.94 and
the Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 index was up 9.32 at 1,501.57.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is a continuation of the rotation the market has become
accustomed to,'' said Bob Streed, senior vice president at Northern
Trust in Chicago. ''The money seems to flow back and forth.
Yesterday, investors took their money out of technology and put
into blue chips. Today, they're taking it out of blue chips and
putting it back into technology.''
</P>
<P>
   Tech stocks appeared to be having their best day so far in a
trading week abbreviated by the Labor Day holiday.
</P>
<P>
   Chipmaker Intel traded up $2.05 at $67.75 on the Nasdaq, after
tumbling for two days on an influential analyst's downgrade.
</P>
<P>
   Micron Technology, another chip maker that was downgraded on
Wednesday, was up $4.88 to $73.63 on the Big Board.
</P>
<P>
   DuPont, Campbell Soup, Circuit City Stores and May Department
Stores all warned Thursday that their quarterly earnings would be
flat or below expectations.
</P>
<P>
   DuPont was down $5.75 at $41.25; Campbell was up 12.5 cents at
$25; Circuit City fell $1.19 to $26.56; and May was down $1.25 at
$22.44.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts have been warning investors to expect flat or lower
earnings because of the slowdown in economic growth. The Federal
Reserve has hiked interest rates six times since last summer, and
recent data suggest the economy is indeed slowing.
</P>
<P>
   Shares of Restoration Hardware dropped more than 20 percent,
falling $1.25 at $4.92, after the home furnishings retailer said it
was in need of additional funding and had hired an investment bank
to help it find a new source of capital.
</P>
<P>
   Also, MP3 continued to decline Thursday, falling $1.56 -- or 20
percent -- to $6.31. A federal judge ruled Wednesday that MP3.com,
which allows people to listen to songs over the Internet but not
download them to their computers, violated Universal's copyrights.
</P>
<P>
   Declining issues narrowly led advancers on the New York Stock
Exchange, where volume came to 655.49 million shares, compared to
671.17 million in the last session.
</P>
<P>
   The Russell 2000 index was up 2.39 at 538.71.

<HEADLINE> House Bill Helps Welfare Parents  </HEADLINE>
By JIM ABRAMS
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Single parents leaving the welfare rolls would
receive all the child support payments collected by the states
under a bill that passed the House Thursday. The measure could
provide more than $3 billion for the working poor over a five-year
period.
</P>
<P>
   The bill, which passed 405-18, will ''ensure that these mothers
who have left welfare get all the help they deserve,'' said Rep.
Nancy Johnson, R-Conn., chief sponsor with Rep. Ben Cardin, D-Md.
</P>
<P>
   Under the 1996 welfare reform act, the government takes half the
past-due child support it collects for families leaving welfare to
compensate for past welfare payments. The legislation would require
that all child support arrearages go to the single parent. Johnson
said that would put more than $700 million more a year in the hands
of low income parents struggling to leave welfare.
</P>
<P>
   Supporters said the measure, which also simplifies distribution
of child support collected by states, would help some of the 30
million childen now owed $50 billion in unpaid child support.
States would have the option of sharing collections with families
still on welfare.
</P>
<P>
   The legislation, which still needs Senate consideration, also
seeks to promote fatherhood with grants to both public and private
groups that sponsor projects advancing marriage and parenting and
helping fathers with job training.
</P>
<P>
   Cardin said the bill would give important help to parents trying
to free themselves from welfare and would make it easier to collect
child support because fathers would know that the money is going to
their children and not to the government.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Lynn Woolsey, D-Calif., recalled how she had been forced to
go on welfare 30 years ago when her ex-husband failed to meet
support obligations for her and her three small children. ''If we
had received child support we would not have gone on welfare,'' she
said.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Robert Scott, D-Va., offered an amendment to clarify that
any grants to religious organizations for fatherhood or other
programs would not be used to subject participants to sectarian
worship or proselytization. It was defeated 257-163, with opponents
saying current law already makes clear that taxpayer funds can't be
used to promote religious activities.

<HEADLINE> Thrill Ride Near Church Spurs Debate  </HEADLINE>
By CHRISTOPHER BODEEN
<TEXT>
<P>
   BEIJING (AP) -- A bungee jump in downtown Beijing is the latest
thrill for China's growing, entertainment-seeking middle class. Not
so thrilled, however, are parishioners at a 350-year-old Catholic
church across the street.
</P>
<P>
   The new ride has some complaining that the Chinese capital's
anything-goes approach to development has gone to far.
</P>
<P>
   Located on Wangfujing, Beijing's premier shopping street, the
100-foot-high ride is the latest attempt by the area's merchants
and officials to drum up business.
</P>
<P>
   However, once the ride opens for business next month, services
at the East Church, 150 feet away, could be punctuated by the
screams of bungee jumpers.
</P>
<P>
   Already, the jump's two crane-like towers -- which drop three
people seated in a cage -- are visible through the church windows.
</P>
<P>
   That has many parishioners unhappy about living under the bungee
ride's shadow. And for Mi Songyi, a member of the city's municipal
council, the attraction is a blight on the district.
</P>
<P>
   The juxtaposition of the sacred and whimsical reflects the
communist government's longtime outlook on religion -- scant regard
that at times turns to outright persecution.
</P>
<P>
   It also reflects how preservation has often had to take a back
seat as Beijing's leaders transform the capital from a city of
stubby courtyard houses to a metropolis of broad avenues and modern
high rises.
</P>
<P>
   ''I don't see any clash between the bungee jumping and church,''
insisted Zhao Haixiang, a college student majoring in art who was
sketching the church Thursday. ''Religion ought to be part of life.
We shouldn't make it too serious.''
</P>
<P>
   Diversity is Beijing's strength, Zhao said, adding that the city
should jumble the sacred with the profane.
</P>
<P>
   City planners are turning Wangfujing into a pedestrian mall to
give Beijing's growing middle class a place to play.
</P>
<P>
   Like much of Beijing, the street itself is a wild mix of
contrasts, where run-down gray brick courtyard houses abut glitzy
department stores. A McDonalds stands next to staid government book
shops. The modern, colorful look of the bungee jump contrasts the
dour, gray brick East Church.
</P>
<P>
   The church has benefited from an ongoing restoration that has
spruced up the interior and turned the square in front of it into a
public park.
</P>
<P>
   Dating to 1655, East Church was erected on the guidance of
Catholic missionaries during China's imperial past. It was reopened
for use in the early 1980s as part of the government's official
Catholic church. Beijing does not recognize the authority of the
Vatican, and believers who remain loyal to the pope in an
underground church face harassment and arrest.
</P>
<P>
   Recent years have seen scattered efforts to restore some old
Buddhist temples and churches, neglected for decades after the
officially atheistic communists took power in 1949.
</P>
<P>
   But development often hedges in on preservation efforts.
Beijing's famous Lama temple is neighbor to a freeway and the
Buddhist shrine's base is an entrance to the subway.
</P>
<P>
   Mi, the municipal councilwoman, said the clash between the
bungee jump and East Church went too far. She told the
English-language China Daily that bungee jumping will damage the
feel of the street.
</P>
<P>
   But neighborhood Catholics appear resigned to accommodation.
Cheap thrills and mass consumption have become China's new culture
and imported religions have to adapt, said Wang Rouwang, a Catholic
whose family has lived in Beijing for over 200 years.
</P>
<P>
   The church's elderly watchman, meanwhile, said services might be
disrupted by the jump, but he warned protesting would be futile.
</P>
<P>
   ''That's the prerogative of the government and there's nothing
you or I can do about it,'' said the man, who gave his surname, Wu.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Focuses on Asia, Cyprus  </HEADLINE>
By ANNE GEARAN
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- President Clinton praised the South Korean
leader Thursday for pressing unification with the North, which
Clinton said would benefit all of Asia.
</P>
<P>
   ''He has done a brave and a good thing for the stability of the
whole region,'' Clinton said before beginning a meeting with South
Korean President Kim Dae-jung.
</P>
<P>
   Kim is one in a parade of world leaders sitting down with
Clinton this week in conjunction with the U.N. Millennium Summit.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton met for about 40 minutes with Turkish President Ahmet
Necdet Sezer for discussions about U.S. support for Turkey's
eventual entry into the European Union and Turkey's relationship
with Greece. Clinton told the Turkish leader he is encouraged by
the pace of U.N. peace talks for Cyprus, said White House spokesman
P.J. Crowley.
</P>
<P>
   Later, at a reception for African leaders and business
officials, Clinton said: ''I believe America is moving inexorably
to be a much better partner over the long run for Africa. ... And I
am more convinced today that it is not an act of charity. It is an
act of enlightened self-interest for the world that we should be
building together.''
</P>
<P>
   In an address to the Security Council, Clinton said the United
Nations will have to deal with challenges such as poverty, disease
and environmental threats along with security risks like wars and
other conflicts.
</P>
<P>
   ''Until we confront the iron link between deprivation, disease
and war, we will never be able to create the peace that the
founders of the United Nations dreamed of,'' the president said.
''I hope the United States will always be willing to do its part
and I hope the Security Council increasingly will have a 21st
century vision of security that we can all embrace and pursue.''
</P>
<P>
   The United Nations is sponsoring peace talks aimed at reunifying
Cyprus. The Mediterranean island has been split into a Greek
Cypriot-controlled south and a Turkish-occupied north since Turkey
invaded in July 1974, following a short-lived coup by supporters of
union with Greece. The northern Turkish state is recognized only by
Turkey, which maintains 35,000 troops there.
</P>
<P>
   Greek-Turkish relations have rarely been better than they are
now. Cautious overtures for dialogue were greatly accelerated by
deadly earthquakes that struck both countries last year, bringing
aid and goodwill initiatives from both sides that helped ease
decades of mistrust.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's meeting with the Korean leader comes less than a week
after he left to his successor a decision on whether to construct a
U.S. national missile shield.
</P>
<P>
   ''There are a number of bilateral and regional issues that will
be on the agenda, including North Korea and the discussions that we
have had with them on both missiles and security,'' White House
spokesman Joe Lockhart said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   The unfinished missile defense business hung over Clinton's
summit meeting with Russian President Vladimir Putin on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   The shield would be designed in part to counter potential
nuclear aggression by North Korea.
</P>
<P>
   North Korea's leader, Kim Jong Il, skipped the gathering of
about 160 heads of state.
</P>
<P>
   China and Russia vigorously oppose any U.S. move to build a
missile shield or even to plan for it in detail. The United States
is already veering close to violating a key arms control agreement,
those countries claim.
</P>
<P>
   Before his session with Putin, Clinton said his decision to put
off deployment of a missile shield created the opportunity for
Putin and the next American president ''to reach a common position.
And I hope they can,'' Clinton added, ''because I think it's very
important for the future that we continue to work together.''
</P>
<P>
   Putin, in his own address to the United Nations, signaled that
Russia would continue to press the United States to abandon its
missile defense ambitions.

<HEADLINE> UN Workers Evacuated From W. Timor  </HEADLINE>
By IRWAN FIRDAUS
<TEXT>
<P>
   KUPANG, Indonesia (AP) -- Frightened U.N. relief workers were
evacuated from West Timor on Thursday, fleeing rampaging militias,
and the caskets of three slain workers were airlifted out, draped
in blue U.N. flags and covered with tropical flowers.
</P>
<P>
   After failing to stop a militia-led mob that destroyed a U.N.
office in the West Timor town of Atambua on Wednesday, Indonesia's
military deployed troop and police reinforcements and made 15
arrests.
</P>
<P>
   With the suspension of international aid operations, some 90,000
refugees were faced with potentially disastrous shortages of food
and medicines in their squalid camps on the western side of the
border that divides Timor island into the Indonesian west and the
U.N.-administered East Timor.
</P>
<P>
   In New York, President Abdurrahman Wahid, humiliated before
scores of world leaders at the U.N. Millennium Summit, insisted his
forces had tried to prevent Wednesday's attack, which left three
aid workers, including an American, and three civilians dead.
Witnesses say soldiers stood by without stopping the mob.
</P>
<P>
   ''We protected them, but it's a problem of a cultural nature,''
Wahid told journalists, saying tribal differences fueled the
militia problem.
</P>
<P>
   Foreign governments demanded Wahid make good on past promises
and take strong action against the militias, which human rights
groups say are backed by hard-line elements of Indonesia's army.
</P>
<P>
   Wahid has often blamed such rogue military elements of
triggering bloodshed and mayhem in Timor and elsewhere in Indonesia
to derail attempts by his 11-month-old government to build a new
democracy after decades of authoritarianism.
</P>
<P>
   Indonesia's official Antara news agency quoted Wahid earlier as
saying Wednesday's attack was engineered by his domestic political
foes.
</P>
<P>
   ''This was done at a time when I am in New York, at the United
Nations, in order to embarrass me,'' he was reported as saying. He
did not repeat the accusations when speaking at the United Nations.
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday, about 3,000 militiamen and supporters stormed the
Atambua office of the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees, and beat
and stabbed three workers to death, then burned their bodies.
</P>
<P>
   Other workers fled and hid in the homes of sympathetic
townspeople or under Indonesian police protection.
</P>
<P>
   Alias Bin Ahmal, a Malaysian who managed the U.N. office, was
sheltered along with five colleagues by a woman and her husband.
The woman told militiamen who banged on their door that the U.N.
workers had gone on ahead.
</P>
<P>
   ''If it was not for the woman's determination and ingenuity we
would have been sitting ducks,'' Ahmal said.
</P>
<P>
   The militias blamed for the slayings are the same gangs that
terrorized and devastated East Timor a year ago after its people
voted to break free of Indonesian rule in a U.N.-supervised
referendum.
</P>
<P>
   That violence sent some 250,000 East Timorese refugees fleeing
to West Timor. About 160,000 of them have since returned.
</P>
<P>
   Some 196 U.N. and other aid workers were flown and trucked from
West Timor on Thursday to the nearby island of Bali or to East
Timor, U.N. officials said. The coffins of the three slain U.N.
workers arrived by plane Thursday in the East Timorese capital,
Dili.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is going to hit the refugees very hard,'' said Chris Lom,
from the U.N.'s International Organization for Migration after he
left the West Timorese capital, Kupang.
</P>
<P>
   He said food supplies were already low, and that without
medicines and doctors, outbreaks of disease were probable. In many
camps, children already have scabies. Most were malnourished and
malaria and respiratory illnesses were rife, he said.

<HEADLINE> Suspect Trailed Before Truck Deaths  </HEADLINE>
By ANTHONY DEUTSCH
<TEXT>
<P>
   THE HAGUE, Netherlands (AP) -- The suspected leader of a
smuggling ring connected to the deaths of 58 immigrants was under
surveillance before the bodies were found, but police had no clear
proof he was involved in human trafficking, the justice minister
said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Benk Korthals told a special parliamentary session that Dutch
police had been watching the suspect and others.
</P>
<P>
   The suspect, whose name has not been released in line with Dutch
privacy practices, was being ''observed once or twice a week for
some time,'' Korthals said. But, he said, the suspects were not
being followed the day in June when the Chinese immigrants were
packed inside a truck's unventilated refrigeration container for
the trip to England.
</P>
<P>
   British customs officers in Dover found the bodies of the
Chinese, who had suffocated in the back of the airtight truck
during the five-hour ferry crossing from Belgium. Two immigrants
survived. The truck was registered in the Dutch port city of
Rotterdam.
</P>
<P>
   During an hour-long debate, Dutch legislators cited an article
in the respected magazine Vrij Nederland that identified one gang
member as Gurzel O. and said he was of Turkish origin. The magazine
said the ring had been under observation since mid-1998 after
authorities received a tip that it was shipping Kurds from the
Netherlands to England by yacht.
</P>
<P>
   Korthals told parliament that under the surveillance operation,
groups of illegal immigrants were allowed to leave the Netherlands
to help gather evidence against the gangs who smuggled them.
</P>
<P>
   But, he said, the Dover case was not among those allowed to
proceed. Korthals denied he was aware of any human trafficking
activities by the organization before the incident in Dover.
</P>
<P>
   Six people are in custody in the case and an official close to
the investigation said another major figure is being sought. Five
other suspects were detained and conditionally released after
questioning.
</P>
<P>
   A court hearing on the case was expected in September and full
parliamentary debate in October.

<HEADLINE> With: BC-NY--Buffalo Teachers  </HEADLINE>
By The Associated Press	   Sticking points in negotiations between the Buffalo
Teachers
Federation and the Board of Education:
<TEXT>
<P>
   -Wages: The district's latest four-year proposal would provide
$30 million in salary increases over four years. Across-the-board
raises would come on top of automatic ''step'' increases of between
1 and 5 percent. Factoring in both step and across-the-board
increases, salaries would rise an average of 3.5 percent, about the
current inflation rate.
</P>
<P>
   The union's latest pay demand calls for raises averaging 7.2
percent annually over five years, at a cost to the district of $110
million.
</P>
<P>
   -Retirement benefits: District now provides retiring teachers
with lifetime health insurance, at a cost of $10.3 million
annually. Anticipating that amount to double in the next five
years, the district wants the teachers to cover a larger portion of
the premiums and accept higher deductibles.
</P>
<P>
   -Health insurance: District wants to limit its contributions for
teachers hired in the future to the cost of the lowest-priced HMO
coverage offered by the school system. Incoming teachers who want
more expensive coverage would pay the difference.
</P>
<P>
   -Subcontracting services: District wants to contract with
outside service agencies and in some cases accept donated services
to provide support services to students and families. Union wants
to preserve jurisdiction over providing these services using school
social workers and psychologists working under the teachers
contract.

<HEADLINE> Teacher strikes are rare in New York  </HEADLINE>
By ANNY KUO
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) - Public school teachers in New York have not
been prone to strikes for nearly two decades, making the job action
by teachers in Buffalo a somewhat rare occurrence, observers said
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Since the 1982-83 school year, New York has seen 10 strikes by
teachers in kindergarten through 12th grade, with just four
happening after 1990.
</P>
<P>
   ''By and large, the level of cooperation between bargaining
units and school districts has been very high. Buffalo's problem
was chronic,'' said Robin Rapaport, vice president of the
42,000-member National Education Association-New York, the parent
union of the Buffalo Federation of Teachers.
</P>
<P>
   In the state's second-largest school district, 3,700 teachers
went on strike Thursday morning after union executives rejected a
contract offer by the Board of Education. The walkout came on the
second day of classes, and the district canceled school for its
47,000 students.
</P>
<P>
   ''Buffalo is an aberration,'' said David Ernst, spokesman for
the state School Boards Association. ''Unions all over the state
are either settling contracts or remaining at the bargaining table.
For some reason the Buffalo union is thinking different.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1967, New York enacted the Public Employees Fair Employment
Act, commonly known as the Taylor Law. The law gave public
employees the right to organize and established procedures to
settle collective bargaining disputes.
</P>
<P>
   But the Taylor Law also made it illegal for public employees,
including teachers, to strike. Penalties for striking include a
loss of two days' pay for each day of the strike and possibly
additional disciplinary action.
</P>
<P>
   In Buffalo's case, teachers could face potential jail time for
defying a court injunction prohibiting the action.
</P>
<P>
   During the last teachers' strike in the state - a three-day
walkout in Yonkers in October 1999 - teachers were liable for six
days' pay for violating the Taylor Law. The 2,100-member teachers
union was also fined $50,000 for violating a court injunction that
took effect when the strike began.
</P>
<P>
   Steve Frey, president of the Yonkers Federation of Teachers,
said his union has no regrets about last year's strike. But he
acknowledged that fewer and fewer unions are resorting to job
actions because they ''realize that it hurts the whole educational
system and it's best to be avoided.''
</P>
<P>
   In all, there were 112 strikes since the inception of the Taylor
Law. Records show that the largest number of teacher strikes - 20
districts - happened in the 1975-76 school year. Buffalo was one of
the affected districts that year; its teachers struck for 13 days.
</P>
<P>
   The number of strikes dipped dramatically following the passage
of the Triborough Amendment to the Taylor Law in 1982, said Linda
Rosenblatt, spokeswoman for the New York State United Teachers
union. The amendment mandated that when a contract expires, the
terms and conditions of the old contract continue until a new
agreement takes effect.
</P>
<P>
   ''That has really done a lot to provide labor peace,''
Rosenblatt said.
</P>
<P>
   But Ernst said the Triborough Amendment gave teachers ''no
incentives to settle contracts'' since most are able to receive
benefits and pay raises spelled out in expired agreements. Instead,
contract negotiations are dragged out until teachers and unions
feel the economic pressure to seek a new contract, he said.
</P>
<P>
   According to NYSUT, 122 teacher locals began the 2000-01 school
year without contracts - the lowest number in at least nine years.

<HEADLINE> Indian Affairs Marks Anniversary  </HEADLINE>
By MATT KELLEY
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Bureau of Indian Affairs will mark its
175th anniversary Friday with speeches, songs and ceremonies at
Interior Department headquarters. But there's a hitch: The 175th
anniversary was last year.
</P>
<P>
   Kevin Gover, the Pawnee Indian who heads the BIA, chuckled when
asked about the delay. He said so much attention was directed at
the Interior Department's 150th anniversary in 1999 there was no
time to arrange ceremonies for the BIA.
</P>
<P>
   ''The department's 150th got a lot of attention and our 175th
got none,'' Gover said. ''So we said, 'We're going to do it
ourselves, even if we are late.'''
</P>
<P>
   Besides, Gover said, the commemoration will be more solemn than
celebratory.
</P>
<P>
   ''To call it a celebration doesn't seem appropriate somehow,
given the devastating, often tragic history,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The BIA was created March 11, 1824, as part of the War
Department -- when the government was trying to solve the ''Indian
problem'' through military means.
</P>
<P>
   The BIA moved to the Interior Department years later, but it
still was run by non-Indians whose goal was to eradicate Indian
governments, lands and cultures. Only in the past three decades has
the BIA's mission changed to help promote tribal autonomy.
</P>
<P>
   Now about 90 percent of the BIA's 10,000 employees are Indian,
but decades of poor funding and lax oversight have left the agency
plagued by mismanagement and inefficiency, Gover says. He has said
one of his goals was to bring the agency to basic competence before
he leaves office with the Clinton administration.
</P>
<P>
   Gover plans a speech at Friday's commemoration to discuss the
bureau's history and its future as a force to help tribes.
Officials also plan to line the hallway leading to Gover's office
with flags from some of the 558 federally recognized Indian tribes.
</P>
<P>
   ''The real acknowledgment is how the bureau has changed from
getting rid of Indians to having Indian people who are directing
policy here,'' said BIA spokeswoman Nedra Darling, a member of the
Prairie Band of Potawatomi Indians. ''It's time to put the course
for the BIA ahead of us.''

<HEADLINE> It turns out much-maligned N.Y. utilities are a hot commodity  </HEADLINE>
By JOEL STASHENKO
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) - A little more than four years ago, a Niagara
Mohawk Power Corp. stockholder got up at a raucous meeting of the
utility's shareholders in Albany and stared down CEO William Davis
and other top company executives.
</P>
<P>
   ''The management has done a lot of damage to the future of this
company,'' the shareholder said to the applause of several hundred
fellow investors.
</P>
<P>
   Not so. Not judging by this week's announcement that an American
subsidiary of a London company is proposing to buy the
Syracuse-based utility for more than $3 billion in cash and stock.
National Grid Group of Westborough, Mass., which stands to become
the ninth-largest electric utility in the United States if the
acquisition goes through, would also assume nearly $6 billion in
Niagara Mohawk debt.
</P>
<P>
   For long-suffering Niagara Mohawk shareholders, who saw their
dividends dwindle and then vanish in the mid-1990s, the proposed
purchase is a godsend. National Grid is offering a 37 percent
premium on the value of outstanding Niagara Mohawk shares.
</P>
<P>
   And for people who watch New York's utilities or pay utility
bills, the huge National Grid-Niagara Mohawk transaction is an even
bigger surprise.
</P>
<P>
   It turns out that the debt-saddled utility, which just a few
years ago was threatening to declare bankruptcy before it got out
from under state-mandated contracts with independent power
producers, was a hot commodity.
</P>
<P>
   And it's not just Niagara Mohawk. As utility deregulation
progresses in New York, it is becoming clear that the state's
much-maligned utilities - lambasted for decades by politicians and
ratepayers for high rates, unreliable power plants and indifferent
service - are regarded as valuable properties within the U.S.
energy industry.
</P>
<P>
   When the New York Power Authority sought to sell its state-owned
FitzPatrick and Indian Point 3 nuclear power plants this year it
attracted a record offer of $638 million. Then another company
stepped forward with an unsolicited bid $50 million higher.
</P>
<P>
   Promoted by Democrats in the state Assembly, the unintended
bidding war finally ended with a $967 million offer from a New
Orleans-based energy conglomerate. It is the highest amount ever
for nuclear generating facilities in the United States and the
biggest sale of state property in New York history.
</P>
<P>
   Other New York utilities have similarly found eager, and
well-heeled, buyers for the generating stations they are shedding
at the encouragement of the Pataki administration as part of the
deregulation of the state's utility industry. In broad outline,
deregulation calls for traditional utilities to become the
deliverers of electricity they buy on an open - and presumably more
competitive - market.
</P>
<P>
   Consumers are supposed to see lower prices and more choice in
their providers of utility services.
</P>
<P>
   State Assemblyman Paul Tonko, an Amsterdam Democrat who heads
the Assembly's energy committee, said he is not surprised at the
prices some components of New York's utility industry have
commanded. But he said he is dismayed at who will - or will not -
reap the benefits of the sales.
</P>
<P>
   ''I've heard a lot of talk in the last 24 hours about
'maximizing (Niagara Mohawk) shareholder value,''' Tonko said.
''Everyone has analyzed this windfall as a dose of maximizing and I
think I have heard several times the use of the word 'premiums.'
Well, where is the premium for ratepayers? Where is the maximizing
of benefits for consumers?''
</P>
<P>
   With the billions upon billions of dollars they have paid over
the years in rates, customers of Niagara Mohawk should get ''their
slice of the bacon'' from the sale of the utility and its assets,
he insisted.
</P>
<P>
   ''The ratepayers made them the strong company they are,'' Tonko
said. ''When they go to the market and speak gleefully of the
premiums that are offered, that came via the ratepayers' pocket and
they (ratepayers) ought not be disregarded in the bottom line.''
</P>
<P>
   Assembly Democrats announced Thursday they will hold public
hearings on Sept. 27 in Buffalo and Oct. 11 in Albany on the
proposed acquisition, which has to be approved by Niagara Mohawk
and National Grid stockholders as well as state and federal
regulators.
</P>
<P>
   Tonko faulted the Pataki administration for failing to establish
standards for consumer benefit when utilities in the state are
sold, or the utilities sell off power generating stations built
with the help of ratepayer money.
</P>
<P>
   While being very precise about the benefits of the sale to
Niagara Mohawk stockholders, top executives of Niagara Mohawk and
National Grid were far less so this week when explaining the
possible benefits to the 1.5 million Niagara Mohawk customers.
</P>
<P>
   National Grid's Richard Sergel said the deal would ''stabilize
electricity deliver costs'' in the upstate New York market which
Niagara Mohawk dominates. Davis said, ''We would anticipate a
variety of savings that would result from this.''
</P>
<P>
   The chairwoman of the state Public Service Commission, Maureen
Helmer, said her agency will review the proposed sale to see if it
is in the ''public interest.''

<P>
   UNITED NATIONS (AP) -- After the killing of three U.N. workers in
West Timor, President Clinton called on Indonesia Thursday to
disarm the militias and ''bring those responsible to justice.''
</P>

   The president urged Indonesian authorities ''to bring those
responsible to justice, to disarm and disband the militias and to
take all necessary steps to insure the safety of those continuing
to work on humanitarian goals there.''
</P>

<HEADLINE> Nasdaq Gains 82; Dow Sheds 29  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- High-tech stocks moved higher Thursday after a
two-day downturn, while blue chips fell following another spate of
corporate earnings warnings.
</P>
<P>
   In midfternoon trading on Wall Street, the Nasdaq composite
index was up 82.00 at 4,095.54, buoyed by the same stocks that
investors couldn't wait to get rid of earlier this week.
</P>
<P>
   The Dow Jones industrial average was down 29.32 at 11,281.32 and
the Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 index was up 12.17 at 1,504.42.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is a continuation of the rotation the market has become
accustomed to,'' said Bob Streed, senior vice president at Northern
Trust in Chicago. ''The money seems to flow back and forth.
Yesterday, investors took their money out of technology and put
into blue chips. Today, they're taking it out of blue chips and
putting it back into technology.''
</P>
<P>
   Tech stocks appeared to be having their best day so far in a
trading week abbreviated by the Labor Day holiday.
</P>
<P>
   Chipmaker Intel traded up $2.05 at $67.75 on the Nasdaq, after
tumbling for two days on an influential analyst's downgrade.
</P>
<P>
   Micron Technology, another chip maker that was downgraded by
another analyst on Wednesday, was up $5.63 to $74.38 on the Big
Board.
</P>
<P>
   But investors moved away from blue chips, however. Shares of
DuPont fell $5.56 to $41.44 after the chemical company warned that
earnings would be below expectations because of decreased demand
and higher costs.
</P>
<P>
   ''DuPont essentially said today it is going to have the same
kind of earnings as it did four years ago,'' said Mike Weiner, a
managing director at Banc One Investment Advisors in Columbus,
Ohio. ''Because DuPont is down, a lot of other companies are too.''
</P>
<P>
   Campbell Soup, Circuit City Stores and May Department Stores
also warned Thursday that their quarterly earnings would be flat or
below expectations. By midafternoon, Circuit City fell 88 cents to
$26.88 per share and May was down $1.38 at $22.31. Shares of
Campbell were up 25 cents at $25.13;
</P>
<P>
   Shares of Restoration Hardware dropped nearly 19 percent,
falling $1.13 at $4.88, after the home furnishings retailer said it
was in need of additional funding and had hired an investment bank
to help it find a new source of capital.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts have been warning investors to expect flat or lower
earnings because of the slowdown in economic growth. The Federal
Reserve has hiked interest rates six times since last summer, and
recent data suggest the economy is indeed slowing.
</P>
<P>
   Also Thursday, MP3 continued to decline, falling $1.69 -- more
than 21 percent -- to $6.19. A federal judge ruled Wednesday that
MP3.com, which allows people to listen to songs over the Internet
but not download them to their computers, violated Universal's
copyrights.
</P>
<P>
   Declining issues narrowly led advancers on the New York Stock
Exchange, where volume came to 776.58 million shares, compared to
787.78 million in the last session.
</P>
<P>
   The Russell 2000 index was up 3.09 at 539.41.

<HEADLINE> Israel Officers Dismissed After Raid  </HEADLINE>
By MARK LAVIE
<TEXT>
<P>
   TEL AVIV, Israel (AP) -- Faulty judgment and operational mistakes
led to Israeli army snipers killing three of their own soldiers
during a botched attempt to capture a Palestinian militant,
Israel's top military commander said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Accepting the recommendations of a high-level military committee
that investigated the raid, army chief of staff Lt. Gen. Shaul
Mofaz dismissed West Bank commander Brig. Gen. Shlomo Oren; the
Duvdevan anti-terror unit commander, known only as Lt. Col. Miki; a
squad commander and the snipers.
</P>
<P>
   Soldiers from the Duvdevan unit entered the West Bank village of
Assira Ashmalia the night of Aug. 27 and surrounded a house where
Hamas militant bombmaker Mahmoud Abu Hanoud was hiding. While three
Israeli soldiers were killed and another wounded by their comrades'
gunfire, Hanoud escaped into Palestinian-controlled territory.
</P>
<P>
   A report on the operation found that it was too complicated,
involved too many separate units and was badly implemented.
Soldiers were given an option of climbing to a rooftop across from
the house where Hanoud was hiding, leading snipers to conclude that
they were terrorists and open fire on them, Mofaz said.
</P>
<P>
   Visibly exasperated, he said it was unclear how Hanoud managed
to escape. If his forces had initiated contact as they were
supposed to, Hanoud would have been captured, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Hanoud, who was wounded, later turned himself in to Palestinian
authorities. He was sentenced to 12 years in a Palestinian prison.
</P>
<P>
   Israel says Hanoud was responsible for deadly bomb attacks in
downtown Jerusalem in 1997 and several more attacks since then. He
was at the top of Israel's most-wanted list in the West Bank.
</P>
<P>
   The night of the raid, villagers spotted the first Israeli unit
and warned Hanoud by telephone, Mofaz said. Hanoud opened fire
first, which caused the operation to be speeded up and led to the
errors.
</P>
<P>
   In the future, Mofaz said, such missions would be less
intricate.
</P>
<P>
   Duvdevan, which means ''cherry,'' was set up during the 1987-93
Palestinian uprising. Soldiers in the unit often masqueraded as
Palestinians to infiltrate villages, capturing or killing
resistance leaders.
</P>
<P>
   Despite his harsh criticism of the operation, Mofaz insisted
that the special unit still has a role.
</P>
<P>
   ''There is no substitute for a unit like Duvdevan in fighting
terrorism,'' he told a news conference.
</P>
<P>
   The Palestinian Authority controls about 40 percent of the West
Bank, including cities and most towns and villages. In some areas,
including Assira Ashmalia, Palestinians handle civilian matters,
but Israel maintains security control.

<HEADLINE> Regis Philbin's Ratings Shoot Up  </HEADLINE>
By DAVID BAUDER
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Kathie Lee who?
</P>
<P>
   Ratings for Regis Philbin's daily talk show have been soaring
since his former co-host, Kathie Lee Gifford, left on July 28.
</P>
<P>
   The first three weeks of ''Live with Regis'' this summer had 26
percent more viewers than the same three weeks of ''Live with Regis
and Kathie Lee'' last year, according to Nielsen Media Research.
</P>
<P>
   Since Gifford's tearful departure after 15 years next to Philbin
on the syndicated show, he has worked with a succession of guests,
including Dolly Parton this week.
</P>
<P>
   Executive producer Michael Gelman said he is not really
surprised by the ratings surge. Gifford had her fans, but she was a
polarizing figure, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ''When she said goodbye, it opened us up to a whole new audience
of those who either might not have been fans or hadn't even thought
about the show,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Gelman and Philbin had already planned to take their time
selecting a replacement. The Nielsen numbers mean their bosses
won't be pressuring to hurry.
</P>
<P>
   The people responsible for the show have even discussed not
naming a permanent co-host, Gelman said.
</P>
<P>
   ''But I think we all at some point want to settle down with
somebody,'' Gelman said. ''We're just not going to rush it because
I don't think there's a need to.''
</P>
<P>
   Sarah Ferguson has been confirmed as a guest host next week,
with Raquel Welch, Whoopi Goldberg and Gloria Estefan waiting in
the wings.
</P>
<P>
   The week of Oct. 2, Philbin will work with unknowns who have
sent in tapes to apply for the job. Gelman said more than 1,000
applications were received before ''Live with Regis'' even asked
for any.
</P>
<P>
   He wouldn't venture a guess on when a permanent co-host will be
in place.
</P>
<P>
   ''The downside of putting the wrong person there is much worse
than just waiting and letting something organically develop,'' he
said.

<HEADLINE> Andrew F. Capoccia, personal bankruptcy lawyer, is disbarred  </HEADLINE>
By JOEL STASHENKO
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) - Andrew F. Capoccia, a personal bankruptcy
lawyer whose aggressive tactics frustrated creditors, judges and
other attorneys, was disbarred Thursday by a state appeals court.
</P>
<P>
   The Appellate Division of state Supreme Court ruled that
Capoccia continued to employ the courtroom strategy of filing claim
upon claim against opponents even though he had been warned they
were often ''without merit'' and sometimes bordered on frivolous.
</P>
<P>
   The Albany lawyer's litigating strategies ''have deleteriously
burdened this state's judicial system well beyond any reasonable or
defensible effort to represent clients,'' the five-member appeals
court said in an unsigned, unanimous decision.
</P>
<P>
   The judges noted that Capoccia kept up his tactics despite being
warned by ''scores of justices and judges throughout this state to
discontinue these practices.'' He also had been previously
suspended from practicing law for six months in 1983 for filing an
inaccurate record and other misconduct and had 221 sanctions
against him assessed by courts totaling $1.43 million, the
appellate division noted.
</P>
<P>
   ''In order to protect the public, preserve the integrity and
reputation of the Bar and deter similar misconduct, we conclude
that respondent (Capoccia) should be disbarred,'' the judges said.
</P>
<P>
   Capoccia's name became well known to the public because of the
heavy advertising he did on television for his high-volume debt
resolution services.
</P>
<P>
   But opponents said his practice was built upon countersuing the
creditors of clients, asserting consumer protection claims and
technical violations of credit statutes. In many cases, they
argued, the claims had been cribbed from the cases of other
Capoccia clients and bore little or no relevance to the case at
hand.
</P>
<P>
   The real aim of his tactics was to get creditors to settle for
pennies on the dollar rather than face protracted litigation to get
their money from Capoccia's clients, legal conduct officials
charged.
</P>
<P>
   Capoccia's lawyer Hal Lieberman said his only reaction to
Thursday's ruling was ''disappointment.'' He said he would seek to
appeal the determination to the state's highest court, the Court of
Appeals.
</P>
<P>
   Among the other high-profile lawyers representing Capoccia
before the appellate division were Milton Mollen, former presiding
justice in the state's Second Judicial Department, and Gerald
Lefcourt, former president of the National Association of Criminal
Defense Lawyers.
</P>
<P>
   In June, the appellate division found Capoccia guilty of
misconduct. On Thursday, it again rejected his continuing argument
that he had been denied a hearing as part of those proceedings. It
also brushed aside his assertions that his tactics had, in fact,
been upheld by judges.
</P>
<P>
   According to the Committee on Professional Standards, Capoccia
had paid only about $16,000 of the $1.43 million in sanctions
levied against him.
</P>
<P>
   State Attorney General Eliot Spitzer is suing Capoccia in a
separate case, contending that his practice represented ''vast
consumer fraud'' because he allegedly failed to deliver the relief
for his clients from creditors and debt which Capoccia promised.
</P>
<P>
   ''This merely proves that Andrew Capoccia has not been playing
by the rules, whether in the courtroom or with his clients,''
Spitzer said Thursday. ''I am not surprised at this result. We
obviously will continue our efforts in our ongoing litigation with
him.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Greg Kinnear is enjoying some real-life role
reversal.
</P>
<P>
   The co-star of the new movie ''Nurse Betty'' remembers once
worked as a rookie broadcaster at the Cannes Film Festival in 1990.
</P>
<P>
   ''I basically had to run up to people like Anthony Quinn and
squeeze out a few questions before being dragged off by
publicists,'' he said in US Weekly.
</P>
<P>
   At this year's festival, Kinnear himself was buttonholed by
reporters and was extremely accommodating.
</P>
<P>
   ''If I saw somebody with a tape recorder, I was running up to
them, saying, 'You need a soundbite? You need a quote?' I was
entirely accessible, just to set the karmic record straight,'' he
said.

<HEADLINE> Democratic candidate bold on paper, understated in person  </HEADLINE>
By LAURENCE ARNOLD
<TEXT>
<P>
   POINT PLEASANT BEACH, N.J. (AP) - The atmosphere in Martell's
Tiki Bar is thoroughly laid back. So is the visiting candidate.
</P>
<P>
   The final weekend of summer finds Democrat Jon Corzine on a bar
stool, casually telling two guys in tank tops that he'd like to
''spend a little money on our schools, a little money on our health
care.''
</P>
<P>
   That's an understatement. In fact, Corzine proposes universal
health care for all Americans and universal preschool for all
children.
</P>
<P>
   His official proposals may be big-government bold, but Corzine
is casual and unassuming in person. Approaching people on the
boardwalk, he asks gently, ''Mind if I say hello?''
</P>
<P>
   Corzine, the former chairman of Goldman Sachs &AMP; Co., has defined
himself with his record expenditure of $36 million during the
primary - most of it from a personal wealth estimated at $400
million.
</P>
<P>
   He was stingy in his public appearances during the Democratic
primary, in which he defeated former Gov. Jim Florio. But he has
increased his public profile of late. He greets voters at train
stations, addresses friendly groups like labor organizations and
rarely mentions his Republican opponent, U.S. Rep. Bob Franks.
</P>
<P>
   Corzine, 53, insists that a massive advertising campaign is no
substitute for shaking hands.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's absolutely, vitally important to do this,'' he says,
halfway through a Labor Day weekend full of campaign events, ''so
the word ripples out that the guy you see on TV is the guy that's
real.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked for words that best describe the real Jon Corzine,
campaign manager Tom Shea suggests ''sincere, authentic,
comfortable, genuine.''
</P>
<P>
   Up early on Sunday morning, Corzine attends services at Second
Baptist Church in Long Branch, where the Rev. Aaron Gibson Sr.
invites him to introduce himself.
</P>
<P>
   ''Jon Corzine of Christ Church in Summit,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   Corzine has declined Gibson's invitation to address the
congregation, saying, ''I came to worship.''
</P>
<P>
   He does meet after the service with about 20 congregants and
church leaders in a classroom. Only in this intimate setting does
Corzine hint at the scale of his proposals, which critics call
liberal and he calls progressive.
</P>
<P>
   He says universal health care - which proved too ambitious for
President Clinton - is at ''the top of my agenda'' and chides Vice
President Al Gore for advocating too incremental an approach to
helping the uninsured.
</P>
<P>
   Corzine has wounded himself with a propensity to put his foot in
his mouth. The most recent occasion was this week, when he told
reporters, emphatically but incorrectly, that he had voted in a
1998 referendum.
</P>
<P>
   Corzine's public image suffered its biggest blow during the
primary when he was accused of uttering a joke about
Italian-Americans and ''cement shoes.'' He said he did not remember
making the remark but apologized nonetheless.
</P>
<P>
   If inexperience carries pitfalls, however, it also has its
virtues. Unlike many politicians who seem constantly to scan a
crowd for familiar faces, Corzine remains focused on the
conversation at hand.
</P>
<P>
   Charles Flum of Beachwood approaches Corzine on the Atlantic
City boardwalk and recalls their first meeting, when Flum asked a
specific question about a Coast Guard facility.
</P>
<P>
   ''You said you didn't know anything about it,'' Flum tells
Corzine now. ''That honesty is what will give me your vote.''
</P>
<P>
   Corzine wears his authenticity on his face - quite literally. As
he considered running for Senate, some advisers told him he would
need to lose the beard he'd worn for 21 years.
</P>
<P>
   But the beard, much grayer than Corzine's brown hair, is still
there. Shaving it off, Corzine said, would have been a statement
that ''I do whatever it takes to get elected.''
</P>
<P>
   While most of his encounters over the weekend are pleasant,
there is an undercurrent of cynicism.
</P>
<P>
   ''Why is he a Democrat? He's a billionaire!'' exclaims Marilyn
Redder of Point Pleasant Beach after telling Corzine that he, of
all people, should favor running schools more like a business.
</P>
<P>
   Another Republican, Bill Fitzell of Andover, gives Corzine a
chilly reception on the Atlantic City boardwalk and later says,
''He hasn't made anything other than money. You know what that
means? He hasn't produced any tangible goods.''
</P>
<P>
   The biggest adjustment to politics, Corzine says, is the loss of
privacy. His wife, Joanne, joins him infrequently on the campaign
trail.
</P>
<P>
   A guest at Martell's Tiki Bar asks Corzine his thoughts on the
prolonged kiss that Gore planted on his wife, Tipper, during the
Democratic National Convention.
</P>
<P>
   Corzine smiles and replies, ''My wife warned me that if I even
try that, she'll slap me right on the spot.''

<HEADLINE> High-Protein Corn Nets Food Prize  </HEADLINE>
By LISA J. ADAMS
<TEXT>
<P>
   TEXCOCO, Mexico (AP) -- For more than a decade, two scientists
labored in fields and laboratories to unlock the potential of corn,
boosting its nutritional value to help millions of malnourished
children around the world.
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday, their efforts were rewarded. Surinder K. Vasal and
Evangelina Villegas, scientists at the International Maize and
Wheat Improvement Center in Texcoco, won the World Food Prize for
their development of a corn containing 50 percent more usable
protein than normal corn. Their creation also yields 10 percent
more grain.
</P>
<P>
   The $250,000 prize, established by Nobel Peace Prize winner
Norman E. Borlaug, honors people who have made vital contributions
to improving food availability, quality and quantity. The prize was
announced in Des Moines, Iowa.
</P>
<P>
   ''This has tremendous potential to help alleviate the
malnutrition of children,'' Vasal said in a telephone interview
Thursday from Bangkok, Thailand, where he now works. ''Almost every
year, 12 million children die from malnutrition.''
</P>
<P>
   Villegas, a cereal chemist and the first woman to receive the
prize, demonstrated the fruits of the team's labor Wednesday during
a stroll through rows of experimental, high-protein cornstalks at
the research center an hour northeast of Mexico City.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's been really clear to us that there was a need to have
corn with better nutritional value,'' Villegas said.
</P>
<P>
   Many poor people in developing countries rely on corn as a
central part of their diet, even using it to wean their babies off
mothers' milk. Many are malnourished because most corn has little
protein.
</P>
<P>
   The new corn, called ''quality protein maize,'' contains the
same amount of total protein as the traditional variety. But it has
50 percent more lysine and tryptophan -- two essential amino acids
that are the building blocks of protein and that the body can use.
</P>
<P>
   The international center here conducted studies showing that
malnourished children in Colombia, Peru and Ghana who were put on
quality-protein-maize diets recovered, Villegas said.
</P>
<P>
   ''If they could eat a variety of foods for a well-balanced diet,
that would be great. But they don't have the resources to do that.
So our job is to improve the nutrition they have,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Today, 11 developing countries in Africa, Latin America and Asia
are growing the corn on 2.5 million acres of land and producing
seeds for future crops. Other countries are expected to begin
planting it in the next several years.
</P>
<P>
   Villegas and Vasal began their research in 1970 with a daunting
challenge.
</P>
<P>
   In their hands was opaque-2, a gene that had been found to
increase the nutritional value of corn. The problem was that no one
wanted it. The gene produced corn that was chalky-looking,
susceptible to disease and didn't produce a high enough yield to
make it worthwhile to plant.
</P>
<P>
   So Vasal, a corn breeder, headed into the cornstalks and began
crossbreeding thousands of varieties while Villegas labored in the
lab. By the mid-1980s, their methods produced a variety that looked
better and still upped the protein content.
</P>
<P>
   In the years since, they and other scientists have developed
varieties of the corn that adapt to different environments, produce
up to 10 percent more yield and can tolerate disease and drought.
</P>
<P>
   Quality protein maize also fattens animals faster using half as
much as regular corn, the researchers say. That means savings on
feed costs for poor farmers.
</P>
<P>
   ''I don't think it will resolve all of the problems,'' Villegas
said. ''But it will help a special group, and this group is very
large.''

<HEADLINE> E-ZPass refunding mistaken $1 service charges  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   EAST BRUNSWICK, N.J. (AP) - E-ZPass is refunding $1 surcharges
it mistakenly assessed some of its customers, a transit official
said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Lynn Fleeger, a spokeswoman for the New Jersey Turnpike
Authority, the lead transit agency in the E-ZPass consortium, said
some customers who use the Garden State Parkway, the Atlantic City
Expressway or Port Authority of New York and New Jersey crossings
were mistakenly charged a $1 service fee.
</P>
<P>
   The problem, which she attributed to human error, involved
monthly statements. Customers who sign up for E-ZPass automatically
receive free monthly statements for the first six months. After
that, statements are issued every two months for free. If a
customer wants monthly statements after the first six months, a $1
charge would apply.
</P>
<P>
   Fleeger said an undetermined number of customers who did not
specifically request monthly statements were nonetheless hit with
the surcharge.
</P>
<P>
   Credits will be issued to their E-ZPass accounts, she said.
</P>
<P>
   The electronic toll collection service, which uses scanners and
electronic tags to identify specific vehicles and deduct the proper
toll from a prepaid account, is not yet available on the turnpike.

<HEADLINE> Survey: Confident Connecticut companies tapping into the Net  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   HARTFORD, Conn. (AP) - The majority of the state's small to
mid-size businesses are taking advantage of the Internet to grow
their companies, according to a statewide survey released Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   The survey, conducted by the Connecticut Business and Industry
Association, also indicated a high level of confidence from
companies doing business in the state.
</P>
<P>
   Of the 816 business executives surveyed in May and June, 54
percent said their companies have a Web site and 15 percent more
are planning to launch a site next year. That contrasts sharply
with the 1997 survey, when 28 percent of those surveyed had a
company Web site.
</P>
<P>
   Confidence in Connecticut as a place to do business also has
increased, reaching 72 percent this year, up 4 percentage points
from last year. In 1994, when CBIA started the survey, only 42
percent of companies surveyed expressed confidence.
</P>
<P>
   The lending climate also drew a favorable response. More than
half the respondents said it was good, while 39 percent found it
fair. Ten percent thought the lending climate was poor.
</P>
<P>
   ''Despite all this good news about our state, we do still have
our share of challenges,'' said Pierre Guertin, a partner in the
Hartford office of consulting firm Arthur Andersen. Among the
concerns are a worker shortage, an anticipated slowdown in the U.S.
economy and business costs.
</P>
<P>
   Nearly 31 percent of respondents indicated labor costs were
their biggest worry. Health care costs were the top concern for 12
percent of those surveyed.
</P>
<P>
   Transportation also is a challenge in the state. Some 64 percent
said a first-rate transportation infrastructure is important to
Connecticut's overall economic growth.
</P>
<P>
   The survey was mailed to 5,000 small and midsize businesses in
May and June and 816 were returned, a response rate of 16 percent.
The margin of error was 3.5 percentage points.

<HEADLINE> AMA Denounces Opening Records  </HEADLINE>
By JANELLE CARTER
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- A lawmaker's efforts to open to the public a
national databank that details doctors' malpractice history is
being denounced by the American Medical Association as retaliation
for physicians' support of a patients' bill of rights.
</P>
<P>
   House Commerce Committee Chairman Tom Bliley, R-Va., on Thursday
introduced the bill that opens the National Practitioners Databank.
The databank is now used only by the profession for the licensing
of doctors. It includes information on disciplinary actions as well
as medical malpractice payments.
</P>
<P>
   Bliley envisions making the information public so citizens can
access information about their doctors via the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   ''This bill provides patients with a fundamental new right -- the
right to more information about their doctors,'' Bliley said. The
legislation ''will give consumers the tools they need to make
informed decisions about their doctors.''
</P>
<P>
   But doctors' groups have cried foul, accusing Bliley of
targeting them because of their support to expand the rights of
managed care patients including the right to sue their health
maintenance organizations. The patients' rights bill is now stalled
in conference with House and Senate negotiators.
</P>
<P>
   ''Let me send a clear message to Rep. Bliley,'' said Dr. Thomas
Reardon, immediate past president of the American Medical
Association. ''We will not be distracted from our efforts to pass a
strong Patients' Bill of Rights and put an end to managed care
abuses.''
</P>
<P>
   Reardon said several states have already opened similar
information to the public. Systems operated by the states, Reardon
said, are a better way of disseminating information rather than a
national databank ''which contains mostly reports of legal
settlements that are not an indicator of physician quality or
competence.''
</P>
<P>
   ''Settling a lawsuit doesn't mean you're a bad physician,''
Reardon said.
</P>
<P>
   But Bliley aides complain that the state web sites focus only on
actions in that state and do not provide a comprehensive look at
problems doctors may have had in other parts of the country.
</P>
<P>
   Still, with just a few weeks left in the legislative session,
Bliley faces an uphill battle to pass the measure -- even within his
own party. A spokesman for Rep. Charles Norwood, a Georgia
Republican who is on the Commerce Committee, said the former
dentist would oppose the bill.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Greg Ganske, an Iowa Republican who is also a surgeon
sitting on Bliley's committee, said he has also concerns about the
measure.
</P>
<P>
   ''I have a concern. . . if that were made available to the
public it might not be interpreted accurately,'' Ganske said.
''Some of the best surgeons in my community had nuisance suits
settled out of court simply because insurance companies didn't want
to spend money on a defense.''

<HEADLINE> Commission Give Medals To Congress  </HEADLINE>
By JESSE J. HOLLAND
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- A survivor of the murder of Polish prisoners
of war by the Soviet secret police presented Congress with medals
Thursday for holding hearings in the 1950s that helped expose the
tragedy to the world.
</P>
<P>
   Reverend Monsignor Zdzislaw Peszkowski, adviser to the National
Katyn Memorial Committee, presented the Katyn Memorial Medal
Thursday to Rep. Ben Cardin, D-Md.
</P>
<P>
   Peszkowski said it took courage for American lawmakers to hold
hearings on the massacres while the Soviets were trying to keep it
secret. ''The United States' Congress had guts to do this,'' said
Peszkowski, a survivor of the massacre. ''Genocide cannot be
accepted.''
</P>
<P>
   ''We did it because it was a right thing to do,'' Cardin said.
</P>
<P>
   Soviet dictator Josef Stalin's secret police arrested some
26,000 Polish army and police officers and civilians after the Red
Army invaded Poland in September 1939.
</P>
<P>
   The secret police shot 15,000 Polish officers in the back of the
head in April and May 1940 and dumped many into common graves near
the Russian villages of Mednoye and Katyn, and the now-Ukrainian
city of Kharkov. Some 11,000 captured civilians, including doctors,
scientists and lawyers, also were killed secretly.
</P>
<P>
   The Katyn graves of some 4,000 officers were discovered by the
Nazis in 1943 and came to symbolize Soviet crimes against Poland.
</P>
<P>
   Congress held hearings on the massacre in 1951-52.
</P>
<P>
   The Kremlin doggedly denied responsibility for the murders until
1990, and they remain a scar on Polish-Russian relations.

<HEADLINE> Dow Ends Down 52; Nasdaq Gains 84  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- High-tech stocks rebounded Thursday after a
two-day downturn, while blue chips fell following another spate of
corporate earnings warnings.
</P>
<P>
   The Nasdaq composite index ended the day up 84.31 at 4,097.65,
buoyed by the same stocks that investors couldn't wait to get rid
of earlier this week, according to preliminary calcuations.
</P>
<P>
   The Dow Jones industrial average was down 51.51 at 11,259.13 and
the Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 index was up 10.16 at 1,502.41.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is a continuation of the rotation the market has become
accustomed to,'' said Bob Streed, senior vice president at Northern
Trust in Chicago. ''The money seems to flow back and forth.
Yesterday, investors took their money out of technology and put
into blue chips. Today, they're taking it out of blue chips and
putting it back into technology.''
</P>
<P>
   Tech stocks had their best day so far in a trading week
abbreviated by the Labor Day holiday.
</P>
<P>
   Chipmaker Intel traded up $1.74 at $67.44 on the Nasdaq, after
tumbling for two days on an influential analyst's downgrade.
</P>
<P>
   Micron Technology, another chip maker that was downgraded by an
analyst on Wednesday, was up $4.75 to $73.50 on the Big Board.
</P>
<P>
   And Sun Microsystems rose $6.31 to close at $123.94 Thursday,
gaining back nearly all of its loss from Wednesday, when investors
bid the stock down from $124.75 to less than $118.
</P>
<P>
   Investor enthusiasm did not extend to blue chips, however, where
a mix of profit-taking and corporate warnings contributed to
investor flight. Shares of DuPont fell $5.19 to $41.81 after the
chemical company said earnings would be below expectations because
of decreased demand and higher costs.
</P>
<P>
   ''DuPont essentially said today it is going to have the same
kind of earnings as it did four years ago,'' said Mike Weiner, a
managing director at Banc One Investment Advisors in Columbus,
Ohio. ''Because DuPont is down, a lot of other companies are too.''
</P>
<P>
   Campbell Soup, Circuit City Stores and May Department Stores
also warned Thursday that their quarterly earnings would be flat or
below expectations. Circuit City fell 81 cents to $26.94 per share
and May was down $1.31 at $22.38. Shares of Campbell were up 25
cents at $25.13.
</P>
<P>
   Shares of Restoration Hardware dropped nearly 20 percent,
falling $1.19 at $4.81, after the home furnishings retailer said it
was in need of additional funding and had hired an investment bank
to help it find a new source of capital.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts have been warning investors to expect flat or lower
earnings because of the slowdown in economic growth. The Federal
Reserve has hiked interest rates six times since last summer, and
recent data suggest the economy is indeed slowing.
</P>
<P>
   Also Thursday, MP3 continued to decline, falling $1.69 -- or more
than 21 percent -- to $6.19. A federal judge ruled Wednesday that
MP3.com, which allows people to listen to songs over the Internet
but not download them to their computers, violated Universal's
copyrights.
</P>
<P>
   Advancing issues led decliners by a narrow margin on the New
York Stock Exchange, where volume came to 973.46 million shares,
compared to 992.46 million in the last session.
</P>
<P>
   The Russell 2000 index was up 6.48 at 542.80.
</P>
<P>
   Overseas, Japan's Nikkei stock average fell 0.60 percent.
Germany's DAX index was down 0.54 percent, Britain's FT-SE 100 was
down 0.08 percent, and France's CAC-40 was down 0.56 percent.

<HEADLINE> Art dealer Wildenstein surrenders, pleads guilty to menacing  </HEADLINE>
By SAMUEL MAULL
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) - Billionaire art dealer Alec Wildenstein, a
fugitive for two years, pleaded guilty Thursday to charges that he
pulled a gun on his wife after she caught him in bed with a
teen-ager.
</P>
<P>
   Wildenstein, 60, pleaded guilty to third-degree menacing, a
misdemeanor, in exchange for a conditional discharge. This means
that he is, in effect, on probation for a year and will not risk
jail if he is not arrested again.
</P>
<P>
   Manhattan Criminal Court Judge Suzanne Mondo also issued an
order of protection that bars the art dealer from contacting
Jocelyne Wildenstein, 55, whom he divorced in very public
proceedings two years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Assistant District Attorney Cheryl Joseph told Mondo that the
ex-Mrs. Wildenstein had been told about the plea deal. ''She is
satisfied with this disposition,'' Joseph said. ''She, too, wishes
to put this behind her.''
</P>
<P>
   The charge to which Wildenstein pleaded was similar to one he
rejected shortly after he was arrested. Prosecutors offered then to
let him plead guilty and receive an ''adjournment in contemplation
of dismissal.'' This means he would have been released, and after
six months his case dismissed and his record sealed.
</P>
<P>
   The menacing charge stems from a confrontation early on Sept. 3,
1997, when Jocelyn Wildenstein and her two bodyguards found her
husband and a 19-year-old woman naked in a bedroom in their East
64th Street townhouse.
</P>
<P>
   Wildenstein said after his arrest that he leveled his licensed
.9 mm handgun at the men in the doorway because he did not know
them. He claimed that he did not see his wife at the time.
</P>
<P>
   As she accepted his guilty plea, Mondo asked Wildenstein, ''Did
you point a handgun at Jocelyne Wildenstein during an argument you
were having?''
</P>
<P>
   ''Yes,'' the defendant replied.
</P>
<P>
   Mondo lifted Wildenstein's gun license and told him he may not
apply for another for at least a year. She also ordered him to pay
a $60 court surcharge.
</P>
<P>
   Wildenstein is the chief operating officer of an art empire
mostly owned by his father Daniel and estimated to be worth more
than $5 billion. Their company owns the Wildenstein Gallery at 19
E. 64th St., and the Pace Wildenstein Gallery at 32 E. 57th St., as
well as art firms overseas.
</P>
<P>
   Wildenstein fled New York in September 1998, ignoring Criminal
Court Judge Paul Feinman's order to appear for trial on the
menacing charge. The art dealer was seen often in France in the
company of young women.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, State Supreme Court Justice Marylin Diamond gave his
wife an uncontested divorce on grounds of ''constructive
abandonment'' after she testified that Wildenstein had refused to
have sex with her since 1996.
</P>
<P>
   Lawyers in the divorce case would not discuss the financial
settlement. They refused to say whether Jocelyn Wildenstein got
more or less than the $140,000 a month temporary alimony she
received before the divorce.
</P>
<P>
   The divorced couple have a son and a daughter in their late
teens.

<HEADLINE> Iraqi Leader Blasts U.S. at Summit  </HEADLINE>
By NICOLE WINFIELD
<TEXT>
<P>
   UNITED NATIONS (AP) -- Iraq accused the United States on Thursday
of hijacking the work of the Security Council by orchestrating a
decade of crippling sanctions and said it held the United Nations
morally responsible for the resulting humanitarian catastrophe.
</P>
<P>
   In a speech to the U.N. Millennium Summit, Deputy Prime Minister
Tariq Aziz assailed the world body for bending to Washington's
will. He said efforts by the United Nations to better target the
sanctions to ease the suffering of innocent civilians were not
enough.
</P>
<P>
   ''Rather their use should be restricted,'' Aziz said. ''Also,
they should not be hostage ... to the will of the United States of
America, which hijacked the resolution on the lifting of sanctions
on Iraq from the Security Council to exploit it in the service of
its own interests and hostile policies.''
</P>
<P>
   Aziz was referring to a December resolution which promised to
suspend sanctions if Iraq cooperates with U.N. weapons inspectors,
who pulled out of Iraq in December 1998 ahead of U.S. and British
airstrikes.
</P>
<P>
   Iraq has said it will not allow the inspectors back into
Baghdad, arguing that it has already rid itself of weapons of mass
destruction and that Washington would find new reasons to keep the
measures even if it does cooperate with new arms monitors.
</P>
<P>
   The sanctions, in place since four days after Iraqi President
Saddam Hussein's 1990 invasion of Kuwait, bar the country from
trading with the rest of the world except through a limited
U.N.-sanctioned loophole.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. officials say Saddam's refusal to comply with the arms
inspectors is to blame for a economic collapse that has degraded
health and education in Iraq and left many of his citizens
dependent on U.N. food rations.
</P>
<P>
   Aziz's trip to New York for the summit marked the first time a
senior Iraqi leader had visited U.N. headquarters since the council
created a new arms inspection agency to replace the U.N. Special
Commission, which was tainted by allegations that its inspectors
had spied on Iraq on behalf of the United States.
</P>
<P>
   So far, Aziz has made no request to meet with Secretary-General
Kofi Annan during his visit, which is expected to last into next
week. Annan normally meets with every leader. Similarly Aziz hasn't
requested a meeting with the executive chairman of the new
inspection agency, Hans Blix, U.N. officials said.
</P>
<P>
   Aziz spoke just after Kuwait's foreign minister, Sheik Sabah
al-Ahmed al-Sabah, addressed the summit, pleading for support to
find the 605 Kuwaitis the country says are still missing from
Iraq's invasion, which prompted the 1991 Persian Gulf War.
</P>
<P>
   ''The sense of loss and frustration runs deep in the souls of
those families who continue to pin their hopes on the international
community to hold that regime accountable and to coerce it into
releasing those innocent victims or account for their
whereabouts,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   While Kuwait accuses Iraq of continuing to hold 605 Kuwaitis and
other nationals, Baghdad accuses Kuwait of failing to disclose
information about 1,150 Iraqis who disappeared during the fighting.
Both countries insist they are not holding any detainees.
</P>
<P>
   Iraq has withdrawn from the international committee looking into
missing persons, claiming it has not applied enough pressure on
Kuwait.

<HEADLINE> Capitol Erects Indian Statue  </HEADLINE>
By JESSE J. HOLLAND
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- As tribal chants, drums and prayers echoed
throughout the Capitol Rotunda, Chief Washakie of the Eastern
Shoshone Indians became the second Wyoming leader to be honored
with a likeness in the National Statuary Hall.
</P>
<P>
   ''Having Chief Washakie represent us here in Statuary Hall is a
great honor to all of our people,'' said James Trosper, Washakie's
great-great grandson, as the statue of the Wyoming leader was
unveiled Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Shoshone and Salish/Kootenai dancers and drummers sang honor
songs to Washakie and performed traditional dances. ''Dancing is a
way for us to express gratitude to the creator,'' Trosper said.
''Today, we are dancing in honor of Chief Washakie.''
</P>
<P>
   The statue shows Washakie wearing a full eagle headdress,
fringed leather leggings and beaded moccasins, and his left foot is
elevated as he stands on a rock. In his right hand he holds a lance
and in his left is a peace pipe.
</P>
<P>
   The back of his full-length leather cape is decorated with
paintings depicting battles he and the Eastern Shoshones fought.
</P>
<P>
   The statue will remain in the Rotunda for six months, in a
doorway opposite a bust of George Washington. After that, the chief
will take his place in the Capitol's Statuary Hall alongside
women's rights leader Esther Hobart Morris, Wyoming's other
representative.
</P>
<P>
   Each state is allowed two figures in Statuary Hall. North
Dakota, New Mexico and Nevada now are the only states with one
statue each.
</P>
<P>
   Historians say Chief Washakie rallied disparate bands of
Shoshone warriors in the mid-1800s and sensed the tide of
non-Indians passing through traditional tribal hunting grounds
could not be stemmed.
</P>
<P>
   He believed the Shoshones would need to make peace with the
immigrants and press for a sanctuary. That goal was realized July
3, 1868, when he signed the Fort Bridger Treaty establishing a 3
million-acre reservation in his beloved Wind River valley.
</P>
<P>
   The valley is still home to the Wind River Indian Reservation,
which is now shared with the Northern Arapaho tribe. ''He always
placed the peace and the welfare of his people above all,'' said
Rep. Barbara Cubin, R-Wyo.
</P>
<P>
   When Washakie died on Feb. 20, 1900, he was accorded a full
military funeral.

<HEADLINE> CFTC Acts Against Trade Promoters  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Federal regulators today announced five
enforcement actions against promoters who allegedly used the
Internet to claim they have reaped huge profits from sure-fire
systems for trading commodities.
</P>
<P>
   Disclosure of the actions by the Commodity Futures Trading
Commission came a day after the Securities and Exchange Commission
announced its fourth nationwide ''sweep'' against online investment
scams, which have cost investors millions in recent years.
</P>
<P>
   The CFTC says it has seen a growing number of online promotions
of expensive trading programs that signal investors when to buy and
sell commodity futures and options contracts, based on technical
analysis of market trends. The commodities involved include foreign
currencies and gasoline.
</P>
<P>
   ''The investing public must be skeptical of claims of easy
profits at low risk by using these trading systems,'' CFTC Chairman
William Rainer said in a statement. ''Sellers of such systems
should also be on notice that the CFTC will continue to take
vigorous action to clean up Web sites that use the Internet to
fraudulently solicit customers.''
</P>
<P>
   The agency also issued an advisory warning the public about
false and misleading claims on Web sites of enormous financial
returns with little risk.
</P>
<P>
   In four of the five new cases, the people named by the CFTC
agreed in settlements with the agency to pay civil fines, which
were not specified, and to refrain from future violations of
commodities laws.
</P>
<P>
   The four, who neither admitted to nor denied wrongdoing in the
settlements, and their Web sites are: Stanley Edward Moore of Reno,
Nev., www.rhythmofthemarkets.com; Richard Swannell of Attadale,
Australia, www.internationaltrading.com; Edward Martin of Terre
Hill, Pa., doing business as Black Gold International; and George
Heffernan of Evans, Ga., doing business as Accutrader and
Accutrader Day Trading School, www.accutrader.com.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, the CFTC alleged that Abdullah Alsafari of Dale
City, Calif., who does business as www.yentrading.com,
misrepresented the profitability of his system for trading Japanese
yen futures.
</P>
<P>
   Alsafari could not be reached for comment. His phone number has
been disconnected and a CFTC spokesman said he was not represented
by an attorney.

<HEADLINE> Consumer group, AG fault HMOs for information flow to customers  </HEADLINE>
By JOEL STASHENKO
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) - Health maintenance organizations need the
prodding of the state attorney general's office to provide
customers with the basic information they're supposed to get, a
consumer group concluded Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Citizen Action said it sought the basic materials from all 29
HMOs in the state, and it gave 17 of them grades of ''A'' and one
an ''A-minus'' for supplying the mandatory information properly.
</P>
<P>
   Included in the group getting ''As'' were 13 of the 15 HMOs
which complied with a 1998 agreement with former Attorney General
Dennis Vacco to supply the basic materials to prospective enrollees
- member handbooks, contracts and directories of local health care
providers participating in that HMO.
</P>
<P>
   ''Our study found that the enforcement action the attorney
general took in 1998 worked,'' Citizen Action executive director
Richard Kirsch said.
</P>
<P>
   The group found that only one managed care company, the
Utica-based HMO Blue, signed the 1998 agreement but was not
complying with its terms.
</P>
<P>
   Of the 14 other HMOs in New York, Kirsch said the group gave
five ''As'' and four ''Cs'' for providing all or part of the
required information to customers. Five HMOs got ''Fs'' for
providing none of it: AmeriHealth Health Plan, Managed Health
(Health First), MagnaHealth of New York; United HealthCare of New
York and United HealthCare of Upstate, according to Citizen Action.
</P>
<P>
   Kirsch said he doubts whether the health care providers have
made a ''conscious decision'' not to provide prospective customers
with the information.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think they haven't made it an institutional priority to say,
'This is an important obligation and we ought to fulfill it,'''
Kirsch said.
</P>
<P>
   Leslie Moran of the New York Health Plan Association, which
represents HMOs in the state, said the Citizen Action report is
''very positive'' because it shows improvement in the overall
compliance rate. A 1998 survey by Vacco found that only half the
HMOs at that time were following the law, compared with only six
out of 29 in 2000 which did not provide any of the required
information.
</P>
<P>
   ''We think that the improvement demonstrates the health plans'
continued commitment to meeting the requirement of the managed care
law,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Moran also called the Citizen Action survey ''very subjective''
and argued that it was conducted with an ''anti-managed care
bias.''
</P>
<P>
   State Attorney General Eliot Spitzer, who beat Vacco in 1998,
said the Citizen Action study is important and that his office has
contacted those organizations which failed to provide the data. In
fact, Spitzer said he wants the 14 HMOs to enter into similar
agreements with the one Vacco made with the others in 1998, even
those which got ''As'' in the Citizen Action survey.
</P>
<P>
   It is crucial for consumers to know their rights when dealing
with HMOs, Spitzer said.
</P>
<P>
   ''If when we call a plan we cannot get the easiest, most simple
statements of what our rights are, of what our benefits are, then
we will never be able to make an informed decision,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Spitzer also said his office is making inquiries into how
several unidentified HMOs make decisions about which procedures
they will cover and which they will not cover. He declined to
elaborate.
</P>
<P>
   Citizen Action called for, and Spitzer endorsed, toughening
penalties for when HMOs are not providing consumers with adequate
information about the companies' services and patients' rights.
They said the current statute, which provides for the state Health
Department to fine offending companies up to $2,000 for a
violation, is not well defined.
</P>
<P>
   ''We need something that is a sharper tool,'' Kirsch said.
</P>
<P>
   John Signor, state Health Department spokesman, said the study
shows improvements in the information health plans are providing to
their customers.
</P>
<P>
   ''For those plans that need to do better, we will continuously
monitor them and cite them for any deficiencies and ensure that
they implement corrective actions,'' Signor said.
</P>
<P>
   HMOs participating in the 1998 agreement with Vacco getting
''As'' in the Citizen Action survey were: Aetna/U.S. Healthcare;
Cigna Healthcare; CDPHP; Community Blue; Healthnet/Empire
BlueChoice; HMO of CNY; Health Now; HIP; Independent Health Metro;
MDNY; North American Healthcare; Oxford and PHS.
</P>
<P>
   Those getting ''As'' which were not involved in the 1998
agreement were Independent Health of WNY; MHS (AmeriChoice); MVP;
PHP (Univera) and Preferred Care, Citizen Action said.
</P>
<P>
   Those getting ''Cs,'' all not parties to the 1998 agreement,
were: Blue Choice, GHI, Health Care Plan HCP (Univera) and Vytra.
</P>
<P>
   Citizen Action said it did not have enough information to give
Premier Health Plan a grade.

<HEADLINE> Russia: 33 Held As Bombing Suspects  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   MOSCOW (AP) -- At least 63 people were involved in deadly
apartment bombings across Russia a year ago, security officials
said Thursday as they presented a chart of how the explosives
allegedly were brought from Chechnya.
</P>
<P>
   Russia sent troops into the breakaway republic of Chechnya soon
after the four September 1999 bombings, which killed about 300
people. Chechen rebel leaders have denied responsibility for the
attacks.
</P>
<P>
   Two blasts occurred in Moscow, one in the southern city of
Volgodonsk and one in Buinaksk in the republic of Dagestan,
Chechnya's eastern neighbor.
</P>
<P>
   Security officials have taken 33 suspects into custody, said
Maj. Gen. Alexander Shagako, first deputy head of the fugitive
search department for the Federal Security Service, or FSB. They
have launched a search for 19 others, nine of whom are believed to
be abroad.
</P>
<P>
   Six suspects have been killed in fighting in Chechnya, Shagako
said at a press conference Thursday, Russian news agencies
reported.
</P>
<P>
   Five others have been charged with terrorism in the Buinaksk
bombing and their trial is pending.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the suspects are not Chechens but are from other ethnic
groups of southern Russia's Caucasus region, said FSB officer
Vladimir Kozlov.
</P>
<P>
   Shagako and colleagues at the FSB, the main successor to the
KGB, presented a chart of how they believe the explosives were
transported from Chechnya through several Russian cities and then
stored at locations in Moscow.
</P>
<P>
   It was unclear whether or when the remaining suspects would be
brought to trial. Police have said for months that they know who
was behind the bombings, but many high-profile crimes go unsolved
in Russia.

<HEADLINE> Preschool Education Plans Touted  </HEADLINE>
By ANJETTA McQUEEN
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Better preschool reading instruction could
prevent some students from being wrongly tagged as
learning-disabled, Education Secretary Richard Riley said Thursday,
touting Democrats' early childhood and teacher-hiring initiatives.
</P>
<P>
   ''We do too much overlabeling; far too many children, especially
minorities and boys, are tracked into special education,'' Riley
said in his sixth annual back-to-school talk at the National Press
Club.
</P>
<P>
   He urged Congress to support increased funds for Head Start,
universal preschool for all 4-year-olds and other early childhood
plans touted by Vice President Al Gore's presidential campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans, meanwhile, offered their own plans for improving
literacy while criticizing the Democratic proposals.
</P>
<P>
   ''There are still those who believe in order to make something
work, you need only pour more money into it,'' said Rep. William
Goodling of Pennsylvania, who joined other Republican lawmakers in
backing Texas Gov. George W. Bush's plans to improve reading. ''Our
approach is to try to reform the programs and make them work.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush has proposed moving Head Start -- which provides education,
health screenings and family social services to 800,000 children --
from the Department of Health and Human Services to the Education
Department. Gore's plan, which would increase program funds more
than Bush's proposal, would leave Head Start where it is.
</P>
<P>
   One goal is to improve the nation's literacy, as Education
Department studies have shown that 44 million American adults,
about 21 percent of the population over 16, had only rudimentary
reading and writing skills.
</P>
<P>
   Both parties offered solutions.
</P>
<P>
   Riley, releasing the latest tally of teachers hired under a
Democrat plan, contended that 1.7 million children in grades K-3
are being taught in classes smaller than last year's, helping them
to become better readers that could turn them into better citizens.
</P>
<P>
   ''Our prison are full of illiterate young men,'' Riley said.
''There is a connection here that we need to understand and work
on.''
</P>
<P>
   Congressional Republicans countered that children are best
helped by offering parents the ability to take them out of
low-performing schools and send them to charter schools, educate
them at home or use vouchers to defray private and parochial school
tuitions.
</P>
<P>
   ''Parents should not be forced to send their child to a
deficient school,'' said Marian Miller, president of the National
Federation of Republican Women.
</P>
<P>
   The group said Bush's education plans would demand results of
schools by forcing them to show parents student test scores and
other measures of performance. In return for demonstrating
improvements, schools could spend federal dollars wherever they saw
fit, instead of being forced to allocate the money according to
federal rules.
</P>
<P>
   Bush would also spend $5 billion on a five-year plan to help all
children learn reading by third grade. Participating states would
be required to include phonics, train teachers and test students'
reading skills.
</P>
<P>
   Gore supports a $260 million-a-year grants program for
activities that would help students read by third grade.
</P>
<P>
   Congress is still working on the bulk of the nation's federal
education laws. Goodling said Thursday that House lawmakers will
consider a slate of programs designed to improve student reading.

<HEADLINE> Turkey Faces 'Cancer Plagues'  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   ANKARA, Turkey (AP) -- The government announced Thursday that it
planned to move residents of two central Anatolia communities to a
new location because the region's volcanic ash was believed to
cause cancer.
</P>
<P>
   The relocation follows a report by Turkish scientists
establishing a link between the high rate of lung cancer among the
inhabitants of Tuzkoy and Karain and the residents' constant
exposure to fibrous zeolite.
</P>
<P>
   Fibrous zeolite is a mineral fiber found in volcanic tuff, a
porous rock formed from volcanic ash.
</P>
<P>
   ''These villages have to be moved away,'' State Minister Sukru
Sina Gurel, the government spokesman, told reporters after a
Cabinet meeting. ''Fibrous zeolite is one of the most cancerous
substances and the frequency of cancer cases there is an indication
of that.''
</P>
<P>
   No figures were available on how many people were diagnosed with
or had died of cancer in the region.
</P>
<P>
   Gurel said the government had earmarked $5 million to move the
2,000 residents of Tuzkoy and the 600 from Karain to a safe
location nearby.
</P>
<P>
   Tuzkoy and Karain are close to Turkey's Cappadocia region,
popular with tourists, which is dotted with volcanic rock
formations and underground cities carved out by early Christians.

<HEADLINE> State finds four more infected crows in four additional counties  </HEADLINE>
By JOHN P. McALPIN
<TEXT>
<P>
   TRENTON, N.J. (AP) - Four more crows infected with the sometimes
fatal West Nile Virus have been found in four additional counties,
state health officials said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Health department spokesman Dennis McGowan also said 10 people
suspected of being infected with the mosquito-borne virus were
declared clear after test results showed no trace of the disease.
Tests on 11 other people are pending, he said.
</P>
<P>
   A Jersey City man is still New Jersey's only confirmed case of
human infection. State officials detailed his medical condition
Sept. 1.
</P>
<P>
   There have been seven cases of human infection in New York City
this year. The virus caused 62 human cases of encephalitis and
seven deaths in New York last year.
</P>
<P>
   Samples have been collected from 22 people with possible
symptoms who live in counties where the infected dead crows were
discovered.
</P>
<P>
   The latest infected crows were found in Burlington, Gloucester,
Hunterdon and Cape May counties, McGowan said.
</P>
<P>
   Across the state, 90 more crows were detected with the virus, he
said. The virus has been found in 14 counties.
</P>
<P>
   ''It indicates the virus is in birds across the state and our
surveillance efforts are working,'' McGowan said.
</P>
<P>
   Last year infected birds were found in 16 of the state's 21
counties.
</P>
<P>
   The health department announced in its weekly update on the
mosquito-borne virus that another 90 dead crows and two additional
mosquito pools have tested positive for West Nile.
</P>
<P>
   Altogether, the state said Thursday tests have found 585 dead
crows and one cockatiel collected around New Jersey were infected
with the virus, which first was identified in this country last
September.
</P>
<P>
   A horse in Cape May county also tested positive for West Nile,
state agriculture officials said Tuesday. The horse was euthanized.
</P>
<P>
   New Jersey asks all physicians and hospitals to test patients
who appear to have some symptoms of the mosquito-borne disease,
which include high fever and altered mental states.
</P>
<P>
   Residents are urged to protect themselves from mosquito bites by
wearing long clothing and insect repellant. People have been told
to clear all pools of standing water where mosquitoes breed.
</P>
<P>
   The virus is transmitted through the bite of mosquitoes that
have acquired it by feeding on an infected bird. Generally, it
causes flulike symptoms or no problems at all, but it can be
dangerous to young children, the elderly and anyone with a weak
immune system.
</P>
<P>
   All 21 counties in the state have increased mosquito-control
efforts, state officials said. Many of those programs include
spraying pesticides to kill the mosquitoes at various stages of
development.
</P>
<P>
   The 43-year-old Jersey City man began feeling ill Aug. 6,
suffering from symptoms that included a 100-degree fever. His
doctor notified the state after admitting the man to a hospital.
The unnamed man is recovering at home, according to state
officials.
</P>
<P>
   Infected birds have been found in Bergen (143), Burlington (1),
Cape May (1), Essex (70), Gloucester (1), Hudson(51), Hunterdon
(1), Mercer (1), Middlesex (125), Monmouth (79), Morris (8),
Passaic (43), Somerset (3) and Union (59) counties.
</P>
<P>
   So far this year, 1,211 crows have been tested.

<HEADLINE> Off-duty Tuckerton police officer dies in motorcycle wreck  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   BERKELEY TOWNSHIP, N.J. (AP) - A police officer who was a member
of a fatal accident investigation team was killed when his
motorcycle slammed into a school bus.
</P>
<P>
   Frank Podbielski, 36, traffic safety officer for the Borough of
Tuckerton, was off duty and riding his own motorcycle when it
struck a bus carrying Central Regional Middle School students at
Route 9 and Serpentine Drive East on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Podbielski, who was wearing a helmet, suffered head injuries and
was rushed to Jersey Shore Medical Center, where he was pronounced
dead 2&AMP;frac12; hours later, Patrolman Richard Bush said.
</P>
<P>
   None of the students was injured in the accident, which occurred
about 3:30 p.m. as the bus was taking students home from school.
The bus driver, Sandra Andrews of Bayville, was treated at
Community Medical Center in Toms River, Bush said.
</P>
<P>
   No charges had been filed as of late Thursday, Bush said. The
investigation is continuing.
</P>
<P>
   An 11-year veteran of the force, Podbielski was a member of a
countywide unit that investigated fatal accidents, said Tuckerton
Police Director James Territo. The unit is made up of traffic
safety officers from several municipalities.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's ironic. The guys he worked with on that unit turned out
to be the ones responding to his accident,'' said Territo.
</P>
<P>
   Podbielski is survived by his wife and an 8-year-old daughter.
</P>
<P>
   ''We're like a family here,'' said Territo, who oversees the
eight-member department. ''It hurts, it really does. We're
devastated, especially for the family.''
</P>
<P>
   The parents of children aboard the bus were notified about the
accident, according to Central Regional Schools Superintendent
Carol D'Zio. Guidance counselors and a school psychologist were to
be made available to the students, D'Zio said.
</P>
<P>
   A full police funeral is planned for Monday.

<HEADLINE> Green Party loses attempt to force its way onto voting machines  </HEADLINE>
By LARRY NEUMEISTER
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) - A judge refused to force the city to put Green
Party candidates on voting machine ballots for Tuesday's primary
election, saying the city was doing enough by promising to try to
count the party's paper ballots within 48 hours of the polls
closing.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. District Judge Gerard E. Lynch heard arguments Thursday
from both sides before concluding that the Green Party was not
entitled to force changes that could postpone the primary.
</P>
<P>
   In a lawsuit filed two days earlier, the Green Party accused the
New York City Board of Elections of massively undercounting its
votes in previous years. It sought to be placed on the voting
machine ballots. Green candidates were left off to save space on
the old-fashioned machines.
</P>
<P>
   The Green Party Senate primary candidates include Al Lewis, who
played Grandpa on ''The Munsters;'' Mark Dunau, a farmer from
Hancock, N.Y.; and Ron Dugger of Manhattan, a former newspaper
publisher.
</P>
<P>
   Dugger and Dunau pleaded with Lynch Thursday to force the city
to count Green Party votes within 30 hours, saying they would lose
media coverage otherwise.
</P>
<P>
   ''After 48 hours, we're dead,'' Dunau told Lynch.
</P>
<P>
   But the judge said he was unconvinced that the Green Party could
prove the kind of discrimination necessary for a federal court to
find that its Constitutional rights were being violated.
</P>
<P>
   He said decisions about complaints regarding the time, place and
manner of elections were better left to state courts.
</P>
<P>
   The ruling pleased Daniel DeFrancesco, executive director of the
city Board of Elections, who said he would try to report the
results within 48 hours.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm a pretty fair guy and honest guy. Whatever we can do, we
try to do,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Raymond J. Dowd, a lawyer for the Green Party, said he was
pleased that the lawsuit had at least gotten the city to shorten
the time it would report Green Party results from a week to two
days.
</P>
<P>
   ''The Board of Election walked in saying one thing and they
walked out saying another,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   City lawyer Marilyn Richter said the city had offered to
accommodate the Green Party in various ways but all of its ideas
were rejected.
</P>
<P>
   ''They don't want any of this,'' she said. ''They want to be
treated exactly like the Democrats and Republicans.''
</P>
<P>
   The judge said the Green Party ''may be entitled to be treated
like Democrats and Republicans in some respects.''
</P>
<P>
   He urged the city to count the Green Party ballots as quickly as
possible, noting that there were only 1,640 people registered to
vote in the primary for Green Party candidates.
</P>
<P>
   Dugger said he believed Green candidates could win in the
general election, but emphasized the party was also looking to the
future.
</P>
<P>
   ''We're building a long-term movement,'' he said, ''a permanent
rebellion against the two-party monopoly.''

<HEADLINE> Nine accused of cheating casinos of $200,000 through credit card fraud </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   TRENTON, N.J. (AP) - Nine people, including a former casino
employee, were charged Thursday with cheating Atlantic City casinos
of $200,000 through credit card fraud.
</P>
<P>
   The indictment charged that two Atlantic City men, Corey
Lassiter, 31, and Derick Williams, 34, organized the ring and
utilized the help of Michael Alpheaus, 28, of Pennsauken, who
worked as a cashier at a Harrah's cash advance window.
</P>
<P>
   He was arrested in November 1997 by State Police on charges of
credit card theft and conspiracy, said Daniel Henegan, a spokesman
for the state Casino Control Commission. His casino license was
suspended in March 1998 and subsequently revoked, Henegan said.
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutors said the thefts occurred between May 1, 1997, and
March 1, 1998, alleging Lassiter and Williams recruited other
suspects to steal information from credit card companies that
employed them. The pair also got other suspects to pose as
legitimate card holders, who would call credit card companies,
report their cards stolen and request replacement cards,
prosecutors said.
</P>
<P>
   The replacement cards would be used to obtain cash advances from
the casinos, prosecutors said. Alpheaus is accused of giving the
suspects cash advances without obtaining proper identification.
</P>
<P>
   The principals could not be reached for comment. No phone
listing could be found for Corey Lassiter or Williams. Alpheaus has
an unlisted phone.

<HEADLINE> Polish Gov't Wants Disco Moved  </HEADLINE>
By BEATA PASEK
<TEXT>
<P>
   WARSAW, Poland (AP) -- A disco located in a former tannery where
Auschwitz concentration camp inmates worked and died should be
relocated, the Polish government urged Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   The dance club opened last month after authorities in the
southeastern city of Oswiecim, the Polish name for the city of
Auschwitz, brushed aside protests and granted an investor a permit.
</P>
<P>
   Running a disco near where the Nazi camp was located during the
German occupation in World War II ''shows a lack of respect for
this tragic heritage,'' government spokesman Krzysztof Luft said in
a statement.
</P>
<P>
   Some 1.5 million people died in gas chambers, or of disease or
starvation, in Auschwitz.
</P>
<P>
   The permit for the disco had enraged camp survivors, including
Polish Foreign Minister Wladyslaw Bartoszewski, and from Jewish
organizations such as the Los-Angeles-based Simon Wiesenthal
Center.
</P>
<P>
   Many of the about 1,000 prisoners who worked in the tannery,
located about 1 mile from the main camp, died there. Historians say
the building was also used to store the property and hair of Jews
killed in the gas chambers.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, an entertainment company received permission to open
a disco in the former tannery, which is now privately owned, but
the provincial governor revoked the permit after protests.
</P>
<P>
   But city authorities issued a new permit in early August, saying
the application by the unidentified investor met the terms of the
city's development plans.
</P>
<P>
   ''We are told that the disco was opened in accordance with the
law, but, on the other hand, the government says it will do all it
can to close it,'' said Zdzislaw Bieniek, who represents the
disco's management.
</P>
<P>
   He said the government was telling Oswiecim residents ''You must
not have fun in this city. You must not live in a normal way in
this city.''
</P>
<P>
   Protests from Jewish organizations and other groups have also
help up plans to open a visitors' center with a cafeteria and book
store across from the main Auschwitz memorial.

<HEADLINE> Owners pull the plug on National Debt Clock  </HEADLINE>
By KATHERINE ROTH
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) - Time ran out for the National Debt Clock on
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   After years of tracking the nation's once-skyrocketing debt -
second by painful second - the plug was pulled and a red, white and
blue curtain was drawn over the famous electronic sign in midtown
Manhattan.
</P>
<P>
   It was shut down on the birthday of New York developer Seymour
Durst, the man who invented and bankrolled it, a testimony to
Washington's renewed sense of fiscal responsibility.
</P>
<P>
   ''Today, we reached a symbolic moment in the improvement of our
nation's fiscal situation,'' President Bill Clinton said in a
statement. ''The Debt Clock helped shine a vital spotlight on
America's mounting national debt, which quadrupled between 1980 and
the day I came into office. The Debt Clock was a constant reminder
of the enormous challenge we faced.''
</P>
<P>
   Often times, the numbers soared higher so fast that last several
digits were just a blur.
</P>
<P>
   ''I always used to look at it and watch the numbers churning
forward. It was a little scary,'' said Jennifer Erday, a law firm
employee who craned her neck to watch as the clock was turned off.
</P>
<P>
   Durst's efforts can be traced back at least to 1980, when he
sent New Year's cards to businessmen and politicians warning that
the national debt had reached $914 billion.
</P>
<P>
   He put up the sign in 1989, and it has run - with some
interruptions - since then. It had to be turned off for a few
months in the mid-'90s, when the debt was increasing so fast it
crashed the computer that calculated it.
</P>
<P>
   Times have changed, and the government has said that the entire
$3.6 trillion of the national debt held by the public could be
wiped out by 2013 under current projections for budget surpluses.
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday, the numbers moved slowly downward. The national
debt has actually decreased since the beginning of the year, what
with budget surpluses and the first buybacks of government debt in
70 years.
</P>
<P>
   In its last moments, the icon read: ''Our national debt:
$5,676,989,904,887. Your family share: $73,733.''
</P>
<P>
   ''It's not fair,'' said Harvey Gerson, of Livingston, N.J. ''We
watched it getting higher every day for years and now we should be
able to enjoy watching it get smaller.''
</P>
<P>
   But Douglas Durst, president of his late father's real estate
firm, said the clock's time has come.
</P>
<P>
   ''It was developed, erected and maintained by my father to focus
attention on the soaring national debt, and it has served its
function,'' he said. ''If my father were here he'd be happy, but
he'd also be warning that we can't relax, that the trend could
always be reversed.''
</P>
<P>
   And he echoed some of his father's fears.
</P>
<P>
   ''The curtain has come down on the clock, but it will still be
there in case things go awry and the debt once more soars,'' he
added. ''And the way I hear politicians talking, I'm afraid I do
forsee having to turn the clock on again.''

<HEADLINE> Greece Pressures Yugoslavia on Vote  </HEADLINE>
By KATARINA KRATOVAC
<TEXT>
<P>
   BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) -- President Slobodan Milosevic
rebuffed the Greek foreign minister's efforts Thursday to pressure
him on fairness in upcoming elections and indicated that the vote
was not a matter for outside interference.
</P>
<P>
   Milosevic and other officials apparently gave George Papandreou
a cool reception after the Greek minister suggested that Yugoslavia
could take its first step out of international isolation by
safeguarding a fraud-free vote.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, the government insisted that the Sept. 24 elections for
president, parliament and local office were a matter for Yugoslavs
alone. Milosevic lashed out at the West's ''shameful policies of
pressure and blackmail.''
</P>
<P>
   ''Our people see our future, as well as our common future in
Europe, only under conditions of free development and open and
equal cooperation, free from all discrimination and tutorial
attitude,'' Milosevic said in a statement carried by state-run
Tanjug news agency.
</P>
<P>
   Papandreou told Yugoslav leaders that, ''irrespective of the
exact outcome, if the elections are free and democratic, this will
be taken as a positive sign in the European Union.''
</P>
<P>
   ''I understand your feelings of pain toward the international
community, but Europe must not have an isolated country in its
midst,'' Papandreou said.
</P>
<P>
   Opposition politician Vojislav Kostunica, Milosevic's chief
challenger for the presidency, said he was ''encouraged'' by
Papandreou's visit.
</P>
<P>
   ''There is a consciousness abroad that the people of this
country deserve to live without sanctions, in a democratic
society,'' Kostunica told reporters. He and Papandreou talked
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Papandreou is the only top envoy from a NATO nation to visit
Yugoslavia since NATO airstrikes drove Yugoslav forces from Kosovo
province last year. Greece is considered an ally that supported
Yugoslavia even during NATO's bombing.
</P>
<P>
   Yugoslavia has been subject to sanctions for nearly 10 years
because of its role in fomenting wars in the Balkans and its
crackdown on ethnic Albanians in Kosovo. Belgrade blames many of
its troubles on sanctions, calling them a massive violation of
human rights.
</P>
<P>
   The Yugoslav elections will be the biggest test of Milosevic's
strength since the end of the Kosovo conflict. The government has
rejected election observers from the Organization for Security and
Cooperation in Europe but invited monitors from ''friendly
nations'' such as Russia, India and China.
</P>
<P>
   Although Papandreou said he had no EU mandate for talks with
Milosevic, he said the European Union considered this a ''critical
moment.'' He would not comment on reported criticism of his visit
by the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, police arrested four activists from Otpor, or
Resistance, a student group critical of Milosevic, who were on
their way to a reception honoring Papandreou.
</P>
<P>
   It was not known whether Papandreou would meet other Otpor
activists. One of the group's leaders, Vukasin Petrovic, was
arrested. Fifteen other students from Otpor were detained earlier
Thursday in downtown Belgrade.
</P>
<P>
   Papandreou was to travel Friday to Kosovo, now run by the United
Nations and NATO-led troops, and to Montenegro, Serbia's junior
partner in the Yugoslav federation.

<HEADLINE> Corps of Engineers stiffens development rules  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WHITE PLAINS, N.Y. (AP) - The Army Corps of Engineers tightened
its regulations Thursday on development in the New York City
watershed, requiring a full public review of almost any large
project.
</P>
<P>
   Under the Clean Water Act, the corps has jurisdiction over any
project that involves the discharge of fill or dredged material
into waterways, which include rivers, streams, ponds and wetlands.
Thursday's action by its New York district suspends some of the
permit procedures that are in effect elsewhere in the country.
</P>
<P>
   ''I don't want to say there was a full consensus, but there was
a general feeling in New York, even in some towns that are more
pro-development, that people wanted more protection in the New York
City watershed,'' said Joe Seebode, chief of the district's
regulatory branch.
</P>
<P>
   The watershed affects the drinking water for New York City as
well as parts of the northern suburbs.
</P>
<P>
   The new rules also apply to the Great Swamp in Putnam and
Dutchess counties, some Hudson River wetlands and other New York
waters, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ''This will affect projects that are having anything more than
an extremely minimal impact on wetlands and watercourses,'' he
said. The new rules require:
</P>
<P>
   -Public notice and public comment before a permit is granted.
</P>
<P>
   -An analysis of whether there are less environmentally damaging
alternatives.
</P>
<P>
   -Mitigation of any impact on wetlands by creating or enhancing
other wetlands.
</P>
<P>
   ''It does not mean people will not be able to develop, but it
does mean that folks will have to come in, get an individual
permit, give the corps the opportunity to coordinate with the city,
the state, federal agencies and the general public on whether there
is a reason not to authorize that project,'' Seebode said.
</P>
<P>
   ''We are interested in using our regulatory responsibility and
authority to minimize the impact on wetlands in the watershed
because they are so important in filtering out pollutants and
purifying water and trapping sediments.''

<HEADLINE> Dow Ends Down 51; Nasdaq Gains 84  </HEADLINE>
By LISA SINGHANIA
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- High-tech stocks rebounded from a two-day
decline Thursday as investors, uneasy about a spate of corporate
earnings warnings, turned away from blue chip issues.
</P>
<P>
   The Nasdaq composite index ended the day up 85.01 at 4,098.35,
buoyed by the same stocks that investors had sold off earlier in
the week.
</P>
<P>
   The Dow Jones industrial average was down 50.77 at 11,259.87 and
the Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 index was up 10.26 at 1,502.51.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts said the shift back to high-tech was more symptomatic
of overall uncertainty in the market, rather than any
bargain-hunting by investors.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is a continuation of the rotation the market has become
accustomed to,'' said Bob Streed, senior vice president at Northern
Trust in Chicago. ''The money seems to flow back and forth.
Yesterday, investors took their money out of technology and put
into blue chips. Today, they're taking it out of blue chips and
putting it back into technology.''
</P>
<P>
   Tech stocks had their best day so far in a trading week
abbreviated by the Labor Day holiday.
</P>
<P>
   Chipmaker Intel traded up $1.74 at $67.44 on the Nasdaq, after
tumbling for two days on an influential analyst's downgrade.
</P>
<P>
   Micron Technology, another chip maker that was downgraded by an
analyst on Wednesday, was up $4.75 to $73.50 on the Big Board.
</P>
<P>
   And Sun Microsystems rose $6.31 to close at $123.94, gaining
back nearly all of its loss from Wednesday, when investors bid the
stock below $118.
</P>
<P>
   The enthusiasm did not extend to blue chips, where a mix of
profit-taking and corporate warnings contributed to investor
flight. Shares of DuPont fell $4.88, or more than 10 percent, to
$42.13 after the chemical company said earnings would be below
expectations because of softening demand and higher costs.
</P>
<P>
   ''DuPont essentially said today it is going to have the same
kind of earnings as it did four years ago,'' said Mike Weiner, a
managing director at Banc One Investment Advisors in Columbus,
Ohio. ''Because DuPont is down, a lot of other companies are too.''
</P>
<P>
   Campbell Soup, Circuit City Stores and May Department Stores
also warned Thursday that their quarterly earnings would be flat or
below expectations. Circuit City fell 81 cents to $26.94 per share
and May was down $1.31 at $22.38. Campbell was up 25 cents at
$25.13.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts have been warning investors to expect flat or lower
earnings because of the slowdown in economic growth. The Federal
Reserve has hiked interest rates six times since last summer, and
recent data suggest the economy is indeed slowing.
</P>
<P>
   Restoration Hardware dropped nearly 20 percent, falling $1.19 at
$4.81, after the home furnishings retailer said it was in need of
additional funding and had hired an investment bank to help it find
a new source of capital.
</P>
<P>
   Also Thursday, MP3 continued to decline, falling $1.69 -- or more
than 21 percent -- to $6.19. A federal judge ruled Wednesday that
MP3.com, which allows people to listen to songs over the Internet
but not download them to their computers, violated Universal's
copyrights.
</P>
<P>
   Advancing issues led decliners by a narrow margin on the New
York Stock Exchange. Consolidated volume as 1.19 billion shares,
less than the 1.21 billion shares in the last session.
</P>
<P>
   The Russell 2000 index was up 6.50 at 542.82.
</P>
<P>
   Overseas, Japan's Nikkei stock average fell 0.60 percent.
Germany's DAX index was down 0.54 percent, Britain's FT-SE 100 was
down 0.08 percent, and France's CAC-40 was down 0.56 percent.

<HEADLINE> New Camden business administrator appointed  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   TRENTON, N.J. (AP) - The township manager in Willingboro has
been hired as the new business administrator in Camden, state
officials announced Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Norton N. Bonaparte Jr., will replace Preston Taylor, who is
retiring in October. Bonaparte will begin Oct. 2, said Jane M.
Kenny, commissioner of the state Department of Community Affairs.
</P>
<P>
   Bonaparte, of Willingboro, will earn $98,500 annually, said Tom
Damm, department spokesman.
</P>
<P>
   The state has been overseeing hiring, spending and contracts in
the financially ailing city since May.
</P>
<P>
   ''Norton has the background and leadership skills necessary to
promote sound management and fiscal integrity in the city of
Camden,'' said Kenny.
</P>
<P>
   ''He has impressed us with his professional accomplishments, his
academic credentials and his commitment to meeting the challenges
in Camden. He has a reputation for bringing people together to
solve problems.''
</P>
<P>
   Bonaparte said he wants to make positive changes in the city.
</P>
<P>
   ''I look forward to ensuring that the effective management of
the city's affairs contributes to the goal of economic recovery and
an improved quality of life for the citizens of Camden,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Bonaparte has been the Willingboro manager since 1995. He also
serves as a senior adjunct instructor at the School of Management
and Business at National-Louis University in McLean, Va.
</P>
<P>
   Bonaparte previously served as city manager in Glenarden, Md.,
and as a municipal official in Grand Rapids, Mich.
</P>
<P>
   He graduated from the Worcester Polytechnic Institute in
Massachusetts and holds a master's degree in public administration
from the Cornell University Graduate School of Management. He also
has taken doctoral courses in public administration at George Mason
University in Fairfax, Va.
</P>
<P>
   Camden City Council President Gwendolyn Faison said Bonaparte is
a good choice.
</P>
<P>
   ''I am confident he will work with the Council in the best
interests of the citizens of Camden,'' she said.

<HEADLINE> Clinton, Castro: Howdy but No Shake  </HEADLINE>
By TERENCE HUNT
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Fidel Castro was excluded from the guest list
for President Clinton's reception for world leaders Thursday, but
the Cuban leader managed to exchange a few words with the
president, anyway. It was the first time they ever spoke.
</P>
<P>
   ''As I understand it, it was a chance encounter that Mr. Castro
initiated,'' Secretary of State Madeleine Albright said. ''They
talked for a couple of minutes and there was no substance. It was
just a cordial conversation but no substance, as I understand it.''
</P>
<P>
   Castro approached Clinton on Wednesday at the end of a luncheon
of the United Nations Millennium Summit, a gathering of about 160
world leaders. ''They exchanged a few words. It was nothing
substantive,'' said White House press secretary Joe Lockhart.
National Security Council spokesman P.J. Crowley called it ''a
momentary exchange.''
</P>
<P>
   It was the first time Clinton and Castro had ever spoken
although they have been in the same room before, Crowley said.
</P>
<P>
   Lockhart originally said Clinton and Castro did not shake hands.
But after checking further with someone who was in the room, a
White House official said Lockhart was wrong and that Clinton and
Castro did shake hands.
</P>
<P>
   Crowley said Castro was among a number of leaders who were not
invited to a reception hosted by Clinton at the Metropolitan Museum
of Art Thursday night. The United States does not have diplomatic
relations with Cuba and maintains economic sanctions against
Castro's government.
</P>
<P>
   ''Not every participant in the Millennium Summit was invited,''
Crowley said. ''There are countries around the world that we have
serious concerns about such as their support for terrorism. And we
didn't think it was appropriate to invite them to a reception
hosted by the president of the United States.''
</P>
<P>
   He said, for example, that officials from Iraq, Iran and Libya
were not invited.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Urges OPEC To Boost Output  </HEADLINE>
By TERENCE HUNT
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- With prices spiking to a 10-year high, President
Clinton complained Thursday that oil is too expensive ''not just
for America but for the world'' and raised concern about a
recession striking somewhere around the globe.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton said he told Saudi Arabia's Crown Prince Abdullah that
he hoped oil-producing nations, meeting Sunday in Vienna, would
agree to increase production to force down prices. Clinton and
Abdullah met on the sidelines of the U.N. Millennium Summit.
</P>
<P>
   After a summer of high gasoline prices and the prospect of hefty
home heating bills this winter, the rising prices have revived a
fight over energy policy in the presidential campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans accused Democratic candidate Al Gore of being part
of an administration that let U.S. influence over OPEC slip.
</P>
<P>
   Gore, meanwhile, has accused Republican presidential candidate
George W. Bush, a one-time oil man, and running mate Dick Cheney,
who ran an oil-services businesses for the last five years, of
being in the pocket of the oil industry.
</P>
<P>
   With the potential to shake America's booming economy, the surge
in oil prices is particularly troubling because U.S. inventories
are at a 24-year low. The Energy Department forecasts heating oil
will cost about 30 percent more this winter compared with last year
and that residential prices for natural gas will be at least 27
percent higher.
</P>
<P>
   Describing his Wednesday evening meeting with Abdullah, the
president said, ''I told him that I was very concerned that the
price of oil was too high, not just for America but for the world;
that if it's a cause of recession in any part of the world, that
would hurt the oil producing countries.'' Clinton said there also
were other reasons why high prices were not in the interest of the
Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton said Abdullah agreed with his points. The president said
he told Abdullah that ''I certainly hoped that when OPEC met there
would be an increase in production because that was the policy they
adopted.''
</P>
<P>
   The administration had hoped that OPEC production increases in
March and again in June would force prices down to the $20 to $25 a
barrel range. While there were brief declines, those price
reductions never materialized as continuing strong worldwide demand
kept prices above $30 a barrel through much of the summer. Oil
prices Thursday approached $35 a barrel.
</P>
<P>
   In July, Saudi Arabia said it would boost production
unilaterally by another 500,000 barrels a day to try to get prices
down to the $25 a barrel range, but so far ''those increases have
not been apparent'' on world markets, according to an Energy
Department analysis.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton said he was particularly concerned because the Northeast
is so dependent on heating oil. ''And we're attempting now to fill
our reserve and to look at what all of our options are,
particularly for meeting the home heating oil needs of the American
people,'' the president said. He called anew on Congress to pass a
long-term energy agenda.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton spoke about oil prices during a photo opportunity with
South Korean President Kim Dae-jung. He praised Kim for pressing
unification with North Korea, saying, ''He has done a brave and a
good thing for the stability of the whole region.''
</P>
<P>
   The president met for about 40 minutes with Turkish President
Ahmet Necdet Sezer to emphasize U.S. support for Turkey's eventual
entry into the European Union. They discussed Turkey's relationship
with Greece as well, and Clinton told the Turkish leader he is
encouraged by the pace of U.N. peace talks for Cyprus, said White
House spokesman P.J. Crowley.
</P>
<P>
   At a reception for African leaders and business officials,
Clinton said: ''I believe America is moving inexorably to be a much
better partner over the long run for Africa. ... And I am more
convinced today that it is not an act of charity. It is an act of
enlightened self-interest for the world that we should be building
together.''
</P>
<P>
   Later, Clinton met with French President Jacques Chirac.

<HEADLINE> Railroad Retirement Bill Passes  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- A bill aimed at increasing benefits for
railroad retirees passed the House on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   The bill, approved 391-25, also would ease retirement taxes for
railroad workers by allowing the Railroad Retirement Trust Fund
balances to be invested in diversified holdings.
</P>
<P>
   Currently, trust fund balances can only be invested in U.S.
government securities, which provide a lower rate of return.
</P>
<P>
   Under the increased benefits provisions, surviving spouses would
inherit a retiree's full pension. The surviving spouse now may
receive no more than 50 percent of the retiree's annuity. The bill
would also allow for early retirement at age 60 with 30 years of
service. Current law requires an employee to be age 62.
</P>
<P>
   The chairman of the House Transportation Committee, Republican
Bud Shuster of Pennsylvania, called the legislation ''landmark.''
</P>
<P>
   ''Through investment of the pension portfolio of the Railroad
Retirement Trust Fund in a diversified portfolio, the returns to
the system will be increased,'' Shuster said.

<HEADLINE> Senate Moves Closer to China Vote  </HEADLINE>
By JIM ABRAMS
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Senate supporters of permanent normal trade
relations with China succeeded Thursday in defeating what they
regarded as killer amendments, setting the stage for final passage
of the legislation next week.
</P>
<P>
   The Senate by wide margins rejected three amendments that would
have required the bill to be sent back to the House, which passed
it in May, for further consideration. Supporters said that with
only a month left before Congress plans to adjourn for the year,
any changes in the bill now would doom it.
</P>
<P>
   Senate leaders on Thursday also discussed how to deal with a
possible amendment by Sens. Fred Thompson, R-Tenn., and Robert
Torricelli, D-N.J., making it easier to impose sanctions on China
and other countries which deal in weapons of mass destruction.
</P>
<P>
   One idea was bringing the popular Thompson measure up as
separate legislation next week after the trade bill passes. Senate
sources said there was some opposition to this approach and that
there was no final decision.
</P>
<P>
   The legislative action began after a 92-5 vote to move ahead
with the bill that could result, in line with China's accession to
the World Trade Organization, in significantly lower tariffs for
Americans selling goods in the Chinese market.
</P>
<P>
   If the United States does not approve permanent trade status, it
would not be eligible for the lower tariffs that will go into
effect when China enters the WTO.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to the weapons proliferation issue, critics of the
Beijing government argued that normal trade with China should be
linked to improvements in China's human rights record.
</P>
<P>
   Sens. Jesse Helms, R-N.C., and Paul Wellstone, D-Minn., offered
an amendment requiring the president to certify that China was
allowing religious freedom before it could receive normal trade
status.
</P>
<P>
   Wellstone said the amendment was needed to ''prove that our
country cares deeply about religious freedom and our country is not
indifferent to the suffering of millions of Chinese who face
religious persecution.''
</P>
<P>
   Helms said it ''tells the rest of the world that we Americans
still stand for something, something other than profits, that is.''
</P>
<P>
   The amendment was defeated 69-28.
</P>
<P>
   A second, by Sen. Robert Byrd, D-W.Va., would have required the
United States to support the transfer of clean energy technology as
part of any energy assistance to China. It went down 65-31.
</P>
<P>
   A third amendment, by Sen. Ernest Hollings, D-S.C., would have
retained the annual review of U.S.-China relations that is required
under a 1974 law on trade with communist states. It was defeated
81-13.
</P>
<P>
   ''We would be shooting ourselves in the foot, to say the
least,'' Sen Max Baucus, D-Mont., said in opposing the Hollings
amendment. ''We Americans would be giving up all the market-opening
benefits that China has agreed to.''

<HEADLINE> Colombian Paramilitary Warned  </HEADLINE>
By JUAN PABLO TORO
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOGOTA, Colombia (AP) -- Colombia's chief prosecutor said
Thursday he had a list of businessmen who supported right-wing
paramilitary squads and warned that financing outlawed groups is a
criminal offense.
</P>
<P>
   The comments by national prosecutor Alfonso Gomez came a day
after Carlos Castano, commander of the national paramilitary
umbrella organization, claimed his group enjoys growing support
from local and international businesses.
</P>
<P>
   The organization, known as the United Self-Defense Forces of
Colombia, or AUC, has come under scrutiny as a U.S.-backed
anti-drug offensive gets under way.
</P>
<P>
   A $1.3 billion aid package from the United States is conditioned
on progress by Colombia's government in reigning in the outlaw
militias and severing their army connections.
</P>
<P>
   Human rights monitors have accused the AUC of numerous abuses.
Many AUC members are former government soldiers. Army troops
allegedly have looked the other way while the AUC executed
villagers suspected of supporting leftist guerrillas.
</P>
<P>
   The prosecutor said during an interview with Radionet that AUC
backers were being investigated. Gomez said he did not want to
release their names yet because some might have been targets of AUC
extortion and not willing supporters.
</P>
<P>
   But Gomez said that financing the AUC is a crime, just as it is
a crime to give financial support to leftist rebels.
</P>
<P>
   ''Financing outlawed groups is a criminal offense that,
according to the penal code, carries a prison sentence,'' he
warned.
</P>
<P>
   Castano acknowledged business support Wednesday in a letter to a
senate committee, but he did not name the companies that back the
6,000 paramilitaries.
</P>
<P>
   He said it was natural for ''national and international
companies whose investments are constrained by the terrorism and
barbarity of guerrillas'' to support the AUC.
</P>
<P>
   The militias arose during the 1980s as private armies formed by
landowners and drug traffickers to combat guerrilla extortion and
kidnappings. They have expanded rapidly in recent years and now
challenge leftist rebels for control over large drug-producing
regions.

<HEADLINE> PSC orders delay of Con Ed refunds  </HEADLINE>
By ANNY KUO
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) - The state's utility-regulating agency
decided Thursday to delay the refunds the state has ordered for
Consolidated Edison Co. ratepayers.
</P>
<P>
   The state Public Service Commission agreed to the state Consumer
Protection Board's request for the delay, saying that a pending
lawsuit brought by Con Ed challenging the refunds ''creates at
least some uncertainty'' over the issue.
</P>
<P>
   The Consumer board had asked for a one-month's delay in the
refunds, which were to have gone out Monday. The Public Service
Commission order Thursday did not specify a new date for the
refunds.
</P>
<P>
   Under a state law approved by the Legislature and Gov. George
Pataki earlier this year, about 3 million Con Ed customers are
supposed to get $162 million in refunds. For residential
ratepayers, the refunds would amount to about $14 in New York City
and $21 in Westchester County, Con Ed's service territory.
</P>
<P>
   A federal judge in Albany has scheduled oral arguments for Sept.
19 to hear Con Ed's challenge to the law. He has also set this
Friday as a deadline for the filing of papers into a preliminary
injunction requested by the utility asking that the refunds be
delayed until its claim against the state is decided.
</P>
<P>
   The utility will argue that the refund statute violates the U.S.
Constitution under a number of provisions, including equal
protection and due process clauses.
</P>
<P>
   ''Our concern has been to avoid potential confusion for our
customers down the road if the refund is overturned'' and the
utility would have to recollect the amount it refunded, Con Ed
spokesman Michael Clendenin said.
</P>
<P>
   The PSC said that while it assumes the court will uphold the
constitutionality of the law, the lawsuit nevertheless creates
concerns that a refund may backfire on ratepayers if the court
orders reimbursement for Con Ed.
</P>
<P>
   ''It is in the customer's best interest to delay the refund''
until the federal judge decides on whether to issue a temporary
injunction against the enforcement of the refund law, the PSC said.
</P>
<P>
   The PSC also argued that while state law requires the refunds,
it doesn't specify the timing or manner of the refund. It added
that more time is needed to solicit comments from additional
comments over this matter.
</P>
<P>
   State Assemblyman Richard Brodsky, a Westchester County Democrat
who has been attacking the Consumer Protection Board's request,
said the PSC's decision was ''stupefying.''
</P>
<P>
   ''They're in effect allowing Con Ed to keep close to $200
million in money which they wrongfully took from the pockets of the
average people,'' Brodsky said.
</P>
<P>
   Democratic U.S. Sen. Charles Schumer called the delay
''outrageous.''
</P>
<P>
   ''If mistakes are going to be swept under the rug with rate
increases, what incentive is there for any utility to do the job
right?'' Schumer said.
</P>
<P>
   State Attorney General Eliot Spitzer, who had also fought
against a delay, said the PSC's action basically ''grants Con Ed a
restraining order which even Con Ed had not sought from the
court.''
</P>
<P>
   ''We're looking at this order right now to see whether or not we
will go to court with this,'' Spitzer said.
</P>
<P>
   The refund money represents the cost to ratepayers of power Con
Ed has had to buy since February, when a nuclear power plant it
operates in Westchester County failed and went off line. State and
federal regulators have concluded that Con Ed should have seen the
problems at the Indian Point reactor coming and performed
maintenance to prevent the outage.

<HEADLINE> Dow Ends Down 51; Nasdaq Gains 85  </HEADLINE>
By LISA SINGHANIA
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- High-tech stocks rebounded from a two-day
decline Thursday as investors, uneasy about a spate of corporate
earnings warnings, turned away from blue chip issues.
</P>
<P>
   The Nasdaq composite index ended the day up 85.01 at 4,098.35,
buoyed by the same stocks that investors had sold off earlier in
the week.
</P>
<P>
   The Dow Jones industrial average was down 50.77 at 11,259.87 and
the Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 index was up 10.26 at 1,502.51.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts said the shift back to high-tech was more symptomatic
of overall uncertainty in the market, rather than any
bargain-hunting by investors.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is a continuation of the rotation the market has become
accustomed to,'' said Bob Streed, senior vice president at Northern
Trust in Chicago. ''The money seems to flow back and forth.
Yesterday, investors took their money out of technology and put
into blue chips. Today, they're taking it out of blue chips and
putting it back into technology.''
</P>
<P>
   Tech stocks had their best day so far in a trading week
abbreviated by the Labor Day holiday.
</P>
<P>
   Chipmaker Intel traded up $1.74 at $67.44 on the Nasdaq, after
tumbling for two days on an influential analyst's downgrade.
</P>
<P>
   Micron Technology, another chip maker that was downgraded by an
analyst on Wednesday, was up $4.75 to $73.50 on the Big Board.
</P>
<P>
   And Sun Microsystems rose $6.31 to close at $123.94, gaining
back nearly all of its loss from Wednesday, when investors bid the
stock below $118.
</P>
<P>
   The enthusiasm did not extend to blue chips, where a mix of
profit-taking and corporate warnings contributed to investor
flight. Shares of DuPont fell $4.88, or more than 10 percent, to
$42.13 after the chemical company said earnings would be below
expectations because of softening demand and higher costs.
</P>
<P>
   ''DuPont essentially said today it is going to have the same
kind of earnings as it did four years ago,'' said Mike Weiner, a
managing director at Banc One Investment Advisors in Columbus,
Ohio. ''Because DuPont is down, a lot of other companies are too.''
</P>
<P>
   Campbell Soup, Circuit City Stores and May Department Stores
also warned Thursday that their quarterly earnings would be flat or
below expectations. Circuit City fell 81 cents to $26.94 per share
and May was down $1.31 at $22.38. Campbell was up 25 cents at
$25.13.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts have been warning investors to expect flat or lower
earnings because of the slowdown in economic growth. The Federal
Reserve has hiked interest rates six times since last summer, and
recent data suggest the economy is indeed slowing.
</P>
<P>
   Restoration Hardware dropped nearly 20 percent, falling $1.19 at
$4.81, after the home furnishings retailer said it was in need of
additional funding and had hired an investment bank to help it find
a new source of capital.
</P>
<P>
   Also Thursday, MP3 continued to decline, falling $1.69 -- or more
than 21 percent -- to $6.19. A federal judge ruled Wednesday that
MP3.com, which allows people to listen to songs over the Internet
but not download them to their computers, violated Universal's
copyrights.
</P>
<P>
   Advancing issues led decliners by a narrow margin on the New
York Stock Exchange. Consolidated volume as 1.19 billion shares,
less than the 1.21 billion shares in the last session.
</P>
<P>
   The Russell 2000 index was up 6.50 at 542.82.
</P>
<P>
   Overseas, Japan's Nikkei stock average fell 0.60 percent.
Germany's DAX index was down 0.54 percent, Britain's FT-SE 100 was
down 0.08 percent, and France's CAC-40 was down 0.56 percent.

<HEADLINE> Two psychiatrists say they feared wife of surgeon-defendant was in danger </HEADLINE>
By SAMUEL MAULL
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) - Two psychiatric professionals testified Thursday
that they contacted a woman who allegedly was murdered by her
husband, a plastic surgeon, because they feared she was in danger.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Stanley Bone, a psychiatrist, said he warned Gail
Katz-Bierenbaum in November 1983 that she was at risk. Bone said
her husband, Dr. Robert Bierenbaum, was his patient and had
authorized him to speak to her.
</P>
<P>
   ''Did you warn her that she might be in danger?'' asked
Assistant District Attorney Daniel Bibb.
</P>
<P>
   ''Yes,'' Bone replied.
</P>
<P>
   Bone told State Supreme Court Justice Leslie Snyder that he
thought it would help his patient to speak to Katz-Bierenbaum. ''It
doesn't help him if he's in a position to do anything that causes
harm to his wife,'' Bone said.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Shelley Jurand, testified that she called Katz-Bierenbaum at
home. ''I wanted to hear her voice because I was concerned for her
safety,'' Jurand said. ''I didn't think I'd hear her voice.''
</P>
<P>
   Bierenbaum, 44, who now lives and practices in North Dakota, was
charged last month with the murder of Katz-Bierenbaum, 29, 14&AMP;frac12;
years ago when they lived in New York City. Her body was never
found.
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutors allege that Bierenbaum, a licensed pilot, killed his
wife in their Upper East Side apartment, packaged the body, and
dropped it into the Atlantic Ocean from a small private airplane.
</P>
<P>
   Katz-Bierenbaum, who was working on a doctorate in clinical
psychology when she vanished, was last seen July 7, 1985. On that
day, Bierenbaum, then a resident at Maimonides Hospital, told
police his wife was missing.
</P>
<P>
   Snyder said Thursday that she expects jury selection for the
trial to begin Sept. 18.
</P>
<P>
   Bone and Jurand said they were troubled about testifying at the
hearing on whether Bierenbaum's statements to them may be used at
his murder trial. They said the feared they were violating
doctor-patient privilege rules.
</P>
<P>
   When the witnesses hesitated to answer questions, Snyder ordered
them to respond, telling them that doctor-patient privilege issue
is a legal matter which she will resolve after the hearing.
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutors say the statements, apparently damning, should be
allowed, while the defense says they are protected as
doctor-patient exchanges.
</P>
<P>
   Another Bierenbaum psychiatrist, Dr. Michael Stone, testified
earlier in the hearing that he had written Katz-Bierenbaum a letter
on Nov. 20, 1983, telling her she was in danger as long as she
stayed with her husband.
</P>
<P>
   Stone, who apparently was trying to shield himself from civil
liability, has since retained a lawyer who has advised Stone that
he should not testify at trial and he should not relinquish any
documents concerning Bierenbaum.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the New York Psychiatric Association and the American
Psychoanalytic Association filed a joint ''friend of the court''
brief in which they said the court should exclude the defendant's
psychiatric records and statements he made to his psychiatric
professionals.

<HEADLINE> FBI seeking suspect in Berlin bank robbery  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   BERLIN, N.J. (AP) - The FBI on Thursday was looking for a
suspect who robbed a Berlin bank after giving a teller a note
demanding money, an official said.
</P>
<P>
   The man, wearing a brown plaid jacket, entered the Commerce Bank
at 247 S. White Horse Pike at about 1:30 p.m. and presented a
teller with a note demanding money, said FBI Special Agent Linda
Vizi, of the bureau's Cherry Hill office.
</P>
<P>
   He fled the bank with an undisclosed amount of money, she said.
The white man, who appeared to be about 40 years old, may have
escaped in a Camaro or Trans Am driven by another white man, Vizi
said.
</P>
<P>
   Nobody was injured and no weapon was seen, she said.
</P>
<P>
   Anyone with information is asked to call the FBI's Cherry Hill
office at 856-795-9556.

<HEADLINE> Virus found in three more towns  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   HARTFORD, Conn. (AP) - The West Nile virus has been found in
three more towns, state environmental officials said Thursday
</P>
<P>
   Dead birds found in Bethany, Tolland and Trumbull tested
positive for the virus.
</P>
<P>
   So far this year, a total of 240 birds - nearly all crows - have
tested positive for the virus in 38 communities in the state. The
virus also has been found in three pools of bird-biting mosquitoes
in Stamford and Norwalk.
</P>
<P>
   West Nile is transmitted to humans by mosquitoes and can
sometimes lead to a deadly swelling of the brain.
</P>
<P>
   No human cases have been reported in the state and no spraying
is planned.

<HEADLINE> With BC-NY--NY Senate  </HEADLINE>
By BETH J. HARPAZ
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) - Hillary Rodham Clinton is among 11 public
figures being honored Monday by the World Jewish Congress for
''helping bring about the various restitution settlements of the
last few years,'' according to WJC executive director Elan
Steinberg.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to the first lady, the honorees include President
Clinton, former Sen. Alfonse D'Amato, city Comptroller Alan Hevesi,
and several Clinton administration and Israeli government
officials.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the honorees were actively involved in negotiations with
governments and financial institutions that resulted in the
allocation of $9 billion in restitution for Nazi victims.
</P>
<P>
   Steinberg said Hillary Clinton was being included because she
arranged a meeting between the president and WJC president Edgar
Bronfman in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   At the time, Bronfman was scheduled to testify at hearings being
held by D'Amato, who was then chairman of the Senate Banking
Committee. Bronfman asked the first lady to help get the president
involved to ensure that efforts would be bipartisan. ''Within 24
hours, she arranged the meeting,'' Steinberg said.
</P>
<P>
   Bronfman was recently made a co-chair of Hillary Clinton's
Senate campaign advisory committee on Jewish issues. She is
fighting hard for Jewish votes in New York in a tight race against
Rep. Rick Lazio, a Long Island Republican.
</P>
<P>
   Asked whether it was appropriate to honor the first lady
alongside others who may have played larger, more public roles in
the restitution effort, especially given the circumstances of her
current campaign, Steinberg defended the dinner, saying: ''Other
people want to inject politics into this dinner. This is a World
Jewish Congress 'thank you' to public officials who have brought
about this revolution in the recognition in the rights of those who
were robbed.''
</P>
<P>
   Jonathan Greenspun, the Lazio campaign's liaison on Jewish
affairs, noted that Lazio, who is not among the honorees,
contributed to restitution efforts through his position on the
House Banking Committee. He introduced a bill that extended by a
year the life of a commission investigating what happened to assets
that came into the possession of the U.S. government.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton spokesman Howard Wolfson said the first lady was proud
to be recognized and was looking forward to the dinner.
</P>
<P>
   Abe Foxman, a Holocaust survivor who heads the Anti-Defamation
League, said that ''regardless of the minor controversies as to
whether everybody being honored is equally worthy, the fact is that
we would not be at this stage on this issue - i.e. closure or close
to closure - if it hadn't been for Edgar Bronfman, the WJC and many
if not most of the people who are being honored. Hopefully it will
bring closure for everybody on the issues.''

<HEADLINE> Florida' Bullard: Not Just a Player  </HEADLINE>
By EDDIE PELLS
<TEXT>
<P>
   GAINESVILLE, Fla. (AP) -- In an era when the term
''student-athlete'' seems to draw more snickers than straight
faces, guys like Thaddeus Bullard remind football fans that there's
still hope.
</P>
<P>
   The Florida defensive end is a member of two service
organizations on campus. He's the student body vice president. He
sometimes appears at three or four public speaking engagements a
week. He has volunteered to teach children to read and the disabled
to swim. He graduated in four years and is currently working on a
master's degree in higher education.
</P>
<P>
   ''Sometimes, it kills me,'' said Bullard, who will start
Saturday when No. 8 Florida plays Middle Tennessee. ''I've enjoyed
every minute. The University of Florida is by far ... the greatest
thing I've ever experienced.''
</P>
<P>
   He came oh-so-close to having the experience taken away.
</P>
<P>
   Two weeks into fall practice of his freshman year, the NCAA
declared him an academic non-qualifier, invalidating a score from
one of his core courses in high school.
</P>
<P>
   The decision was disputed -- some say it was based on a
typographical error from a teacher's grade book. Nobody from the
NCAA ever explained it to Bullard.
</P>
<P>
   It was a degrading and deflating experience. Bullard felt he was
unfairly lumped into a group of athletes widely perceived to be
working the system for a free education and another chance for
glory on the football field.
</P>
<P>
   ''I felt like they felt that this was just another black
athlete, or athlete in general, trying to skate through the
system,'' Bullard said. ''Does that happen? Yes. But there are a
lot of times the athletes bust their tails. ... Those type of
things are very disturbing to me.''
</P>
<P>
   The appeals process didn't turn out quite the way Bullard hoped.
His only option was to enroll in spring semester and try to crowd a
year's worth of classes into the spring and two summer sessions.
</P>
<P>
   He did that to make himself eligible for the 1997 season. Coach
Steve Spurrier recognized the achievement by giving Bullard jersey
No. 11, the same one Spurrier wore as a Heisman Trophy winner in
the 1960s.
</P>
<P>
   Then, Bullard one-upped himself, graduating in four years, and
earning back the year of eligibility he lost in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   This year, he has switched his jersey to No. 90 because ''coach
Spurrier said I didn't look like a defensive end wearing No. 11.''
</P>
<P>
   And for all the success Bullard has enjoyed off the field, he
has yet to really look like the defensive end the Gators recruited
back in 1995. In his first three years, the 6-foot-4, 253-pound
blue-chip recruit produced only 2.5 sacks in 34 games.
</P>
<P>
   ''He's had an excellent academic career here,'' Spurrier said.
''Hopefully, he'll finish it off with a good football career.''
</P>
<P>
   Not that anything could take away his other accomplishments. His
time at Florida has been a success regardless of the stats.
</P>
<P>
   ''Instead of dwelling on the disappointments, he moved on,''
athletic director Jeremy Foley said.
</P>
<P>
   Foley skipped Florida's national-championship celebration in
1996 to attend a meeting and fight for Bullard's eligibility.
</P>
<P>
   ''I would have done that for anyone,'' Foley said. ''But there's
no doubt, watching Thad progress has been fun to watch. He saw the
silver lining.''
</P>
<P>
   Bullard says the NCAA rejection didn't necessarily motivate him
to make the most of his time at Florida. He concedes, however, that
his success has probably sent a message to the anonymous faces at
the NCAA who nearly derailed him.
</P>
<P>
   ''That just makes my point more valid,'' Bullard said. ''I can
come to college and be successful. It's not up to the NCAA. When it
all comes down to it, if a kid wants to go and get a good education
he's going to go get it, regardless of whether you allow them in
school this year, the next year or the year after.''

<HEADLINE> Denver's Davis Might Play Falcons  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   DENVER (AP) -- Still nursing a sprained left ankle, running back
Terrell Davis gave the Denver Broncos reason to be believe he would
play Sunday against the Atlanta Falcons.
</P>
<P>
   Davis was held out of practice Thursday for the second straight
day, but he reported improvement to his ankle and graduated from
walking to jogging.
</P>
<P>
   ''My gut feeling is he'll be able to play,'' Denver coach Mike
Shanahan said. ''I could see he was jogging a little bit out there
on the field, so that's a good sign.''
</P>
<P>
   The Broncos were hoping Davis would return to practice Friday.
Regardless of whether he practices, his status for Sunday likely
will be made in the hours before the game.
</P>
<P>
   ''Right now, he feels there's a good chance,'' Shanahan said.
</P>
<P>
   Davis, who missed the final 12 games of 1999 with a torn knee
ligament, ran for 34 yards on nine carries in Denver's
season-opening loss to the St. Louis Rams on Monday night.
</P>
<P>
   He left the game in the second quarter and did not return.
</P>
<P>
   Backup running back Olandis Gary later tore the anterior
cruciate ligament in his right knee and is out for the season,
leaving rookie Mike Anderson in line to start if Davis is unable to
play.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to Davis, linebacker Al Wilson (separated shoulder)
and wide receiver Ed McCaffrey (groin) did not practice Thursday.
Wilson is listed as doubtful, but McCaffrey could return Friday.

<HEADLINE> 10 Athletes Test Positive for Drugs  </HEADLINE>
By STEPHEN WILSON
<TEXT>
<P>
   SYDNEY, Australia (AP) -- At least 10 athletes have recorded
suspected positive tests for banned drugs in out-of-competition
controls before the Sydney Olympics.
</P>
<P>
   Those cases have arisen since the World Anti-Doping Agency began
conducting unannounced tests in April as part of a new effort to
weed out drug cheats, WADA secretary general Harry Salvasamy said
Friday.
</P>
<P>
   One athlete, an unidentified cyclist from Britain, has
officially been confirmed as positive, while the others are still
under investigation for ''indications of possible positive or
irregular results,'' Salvasamy said.
</P>
<P>
   It's up to the international sports federations to confirm and
announce the test results, he said. In some cases, the backup ''B''
samples have yet to be tested or further clarifications are needed.
</P>
<P>
   The world agency was set up by the International Olympic
Committee this year to coordinate a global system of no-notice
out-of-competition testing, considered the most effective way of
catching drug users.
</P>
<P>
   Salvasamy said 1,811 tests have been carried out so far, with a
total of more than 2,000 to be completed by the time the Olympics
open Sept. 15. Lab results have been completed for 1,200 tests.
</P>
<P>
   During the games, the IOC will control drug-testing, which will
be monitored by WADA.
</P>
<P>
   ''One of the reasons is to ensure that the whole doping control
is fair and seen to be fair,'' Salvasamy said.
</P>
<P>
   The IOC is conducting a total of more than 3,000 tests before
and during the games, both in and out of competition. These include
between 300 and 500 blood and urine tests for EPO, the
performance-enhancer of choice for endurance athletes.
</P>
<P>
   IOC medical director Patrick Schamasch said the new EPO tests
would focus on top-ranked athletes in long-distance running,
cycling, triathlon, swimming and modern pentathlon.
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday, China dropped 27 athletes and 13 coaches from its
Olympic team after blood tests. The Chinese rowing association
confirmed that seven rowers failed tests for EPO, while the Chinese
Olympic Committee said other athletes were cut due to ''some
suspicious cases in the blood test'' or injury problems.
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday, a team official from Uzbekistan was stopped after
customs officials found vials of suspected human growth hormone in
his luggage at Sydney's airport. If the substance is the banned
drug, the official would be expelled from the games by the IOC.

<HEADLINE> Senate Panel Approves MTBE Ban  </HEADLINE>
By JENNIFER LOVEN
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- A Senate committee on Thursday approved a ban
on MTBE, the gasoline octane-booster and possible carcinogen that
has contaminated groundwater in several states.
</P>
<P>
   But the need to maintain the federal clean-fuel standards that
led to MTBE's widespread use has prompted fierce lobbying by rival
interests -- oil companies, the ethanol industry, states and
environmentalists.
</P>
<P>
   With Congress little more than four weeks away from attempting
to finish work for the year, it appears unlikely the difficult
issue will be resolved this session.
</P>
<P>
   The first stab at a compromise bill, months in the making by
Environment and Public Works Chairman Bob Smith, R-N.H., would
phase out MTBE over four years. It also would direct $200 million
from the federal Leaking Underground Storage Tank fund to help
clean up MTBE contamination.
</P>
<P>
   Smith's panel voted 11-6 to approve the measure.
</P>
<P>
   MTBE, or methyl tertiary butyl ether, is included in about
one-third of the nation's gasoline as part of a 1990 law that
required higher oxygen content in gas sold in the most-polluted
cities. MTBE is the most widely used such fuel additive, with
corn-based ethanol the oxygenate of choice in much of the Midwest.
</P>
<P>
   But MTBE began showing up in drinking water and the
Environmental Protection Agency says it may be a carcinogen.
California Gov. Gray Davis ordered it banned in his state by 2002,
and other states have moved to do the same.
</P>
<P>
   The EPA is seeking to outlaw MTBE. But the regulatory process
could take three years, prompting Congress to step in.
</P>
<P>
   The heated debate over a clean-fuel replacement for MTBE has
resulted in a proliferation of bills on Capitol Hill. No bills have
made it out of committee in the House.
</P>
<P>
   Smith's bill would allow states to lift the oxygenate
requirement. In its place, he proposes a new mandate that the
amount of all fuel sold in the country coming from renewable
sources nearly triple over the next 10 years to 1.5 percent.
Corn-based ethanol or biomass-based fuels would qualify, but
refiners could also get credits from the sale of clean vehicles
powered by electricity, natural gas or fuel cells.
</P>
<P>
   The legislation would cap the amount of toxic aromatic
compounds, such as benzene and xylene, allowed in gasoline and
safeguard against a drop in air or water quality.
</P>
<P>
   The bill largely mirrors the Clinton administration's favored
approach and EPA chief Carol Browner applauded the committee's
product. ''Action by Congress clearly is the best and fastest way
to address this threat,'' Browner said.
</P>
<P>
   Ethanol appears in the best position to meet all the
requirements, and industry boosters were thus delighted. ''It's
huge,'' said Eric Vaughn, president of the Renewable Fuels
Association. ''One of the committees least positive toward ethanol
made it clear they want to triple the size of the ethanol
industry.''
</P>
<P>
   Some farm-state lawmakers think it did not go far enough to
boost the market for corn that ethanol provides. They would prefer
the oxygenate requirement to remain in place.
</P>
<P>
   Environmentalists, however, led by the San Francisco-based
Bluewater Network, called the legislation a ''win all around'' for
clean air and water, farmers, and the fights against global warming
and foreign oil dependence.
</P>
<P>
   The oil industry was most disappointed. Gas producers contend
refining advances have rendered oxygenates unnecessary in emissions
reductions and do not want any new government regulations that
dictate what kind of fuels are used to meet those goals.
</P>
<P>
   Senators from oil-rich states tried unsuccessfully to attach
several amendments that would have gutted or weakened the bill,
especially its renewable-fuel provision.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. James Inhofe, the Oklahoma Republican who heads the
Senate's clean-air subcommittee, offered an amendment giving MTBE
producers protection from liability for the contamination. And
Texas Republican Sen. Kay Bailey Hutchison proposed a government
fund to reimburse oil companies for investments made to develop the
MTBE industry. Both were defeated.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the senators vowed to continue the fight on the floor,
even though it was unclear whether the bill would get that far.
</P>
<P>
   Smith promised to try to address some of their concerns, but
lamented the regional differences that were making it hard to
envision a final agreement.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think it's a reasonable compromise that addresses an
emergency situation,'' he said. ''Is it the most cost-effective
solution for every region? No. For the whole country? Yes.''

<HEADLINE> Arafat Rejects US Jerusalem Proposal  </HEADLINE>
By BARRY SCHWEID
<TEXT>
<P>
   UNITED NATIONS (AP) -- Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat has
rejected a proposal by President Clinton to split control of Muslim
and Jewish holy sites in East Jerusalem, but Clinton refused to
abandon his effort to conclude a Mideast peace accord.
</P>
<P>
   Asserting he could not ''betray the Arabs,'' Arafat said: ''I
will continue to liberate all the Islamic and Muslim holy places.''
</P>
<P>
   Although Arafat's dismissal of the U.S. proposal dimmed already
fading hopes for an agreement, Clinton directed his senior
mediator, Dennis Ross, to keep talking to Israeli and Palestinian
negotiators.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton also stands ready to plunge into the talks again,
although no meetings involving him have been set. ''The president
is available and everyone is quite flexible,'' Secretary of State
Madeleine Albright said.
</P>
<P>
   ''While there has been no breakthrough, there also is no
breakdown,'' Albright said at a news conference.
</P>
<P>
   Arafat and Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak are still committed
to concluding a settlement, and ''they understand the time is
short,'' Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
   Arafat has reserved the right to proclaim Palestinian statehood
without Israel's blessing on Sept. 13, although he has hinted the
PLO's top policy-making body, which will make the final decision,
is likely to delay such a proclamation until later this year.
</P>
<P>
   Still, with no further meetings between Clinton and the two
leaders scheduled -- he met separately with Barak and Arafat on
Wednesday -- Clinton's No. 1 foreign policy goal was on the brink of
disaster.
</P>
<P>
   Arafat is holding fast for sovereignty over all of east
Jerusalem, while Barak said Thursday he had ''made it very clear
that no Israeli prime minister will ever be able to sign a document
that gives up the sovereignty over places like the Temple Mount to
the Palestinians.''
</P>
<P>
   Arafat, in a CNN interview, said Barak should show respect for
Christianity and Islam in the negotiations over the future of
Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's attempt to bridge the two positions would award
sovereignty to the Palestinians over the two most sacred mosques on
the Temple Mount in east Jerusalem and recognize Israeli
sovereignty over the Western Wall, the remnant of the Jewish temple
destroyed by the Romans, Palestinian sources said.
</P>
<P>
   The wall around the Temple Mount and the enclosed area apart
from the mosques would be placed under divine sovereignty, said the
sources, declining to be identified.
</P>
<P>
   In practice, Jews and Muslims would continue to worship
separately and, it is hoped, without conflict.
</P>
<P>
   Even if Arafat accepted the proposal, east Jerusalem's future
would still be undecided. At the Camp David summit in July, Barak
offered the Palestinians local control of some neighborhoods and
suburbs, but Arafat rejected the overture, insisting on sovereignty
over the entire part of the city Israel won from Jordan in the 1967
Mideast War.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the holy sites are probably the central issue, and the
theory is that settling disposition of them could be the
breakthrough toward an accord on Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
   Without commenting directly on the proposal, Barak appeared
somewhat receptive.
</P>
<P>
   ''I have told President Clinton that some of the ideas he has
raised are beyond what we believe we can accept, but that if
Chairman Arafat is ready to take Clinton's ideas as the basis for
negotiations, we will be ready to contemplate it and to enter into
such negotiations,'' Barak said.
</P>
<P>
   He assailed Arafat's rigid stand, underscoring that Palestinians
would attain statehood with an agreement. ''With all due respect,''
Barak told reporters, ''when it comes to a moment when Arafat is on
the verge of establishing his own state, it is not the right time
to rewrite the history of the great three monotheistic religions.''
</P>
<P>
   Barak is staying in New York through the weekend, but Arafat is
expected to depart Friday to chair a PLO conference that is to set
a date for proclaiming Palestinian independence.
</P>
<P>
   Barak noted that Congress was scheduled to adjourn next month.
''Since there is a clear need to mobilize major sums of money in
order to support such an agreement being glued together, I believe
that time is running out in terms of being able to solve it,'' he
said.

<HEADLINE> Canadiens Sign Zubrus  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   MONTREAL (AP) -- Right wing Dainius Zubrus signed a two-year, $2
million contract with the Montreal Canadiens on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Zubrus, 22, of Lithuania, had 14 goals and 28 assists in 73
games last season. He joined the Canadiens in March 1999 trade that
sent Mark Recchi to Philadelphia.
</P>
<P>
   ''The expectations are there and I have no problem with that,''
Zubrus said. ''I'm just happy that I don't have to worry about
contracts any more.
</P>

   BUFFALO, N.Y. (AP) -- Jason Woolley, who led Buffalo Sabres'
defensemen in scoring last season, agreed to a multiyear contract
extension Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Terms of the deal were not released.

   Last season, Woolley had eight goals and 33 points in 74 games.

<HEADLINE> Sydney Weather Forecast Looking Up  </HEADLINE>
By LARRY SIDDONS
<TEXT>
<P>
   SYDNEY, Australia (AP) -- Athletes huddled around space heaters
and piled on extra blankets, trying to avoid the chill that has the
city bundled up a week before the Summer Games.
</P>
<P>
   After a raw, cold Thursday with the high temperature 10 degrees
below the normal of just under 70, a storm blew through and brought
a sunny dawn Friday and a forecast high of 72. But few were about
to head for Bondi Beach with sunscreen and surfboards.
</P>
<P>
   Winds were up, with gale-force gusts expected, and the forecast
through Monday called for highs hovering in the upper 60s under
sunny skies.
</P>
<P>
   In this land of sun and fun, central heating is not necessarily
included in even the newest homes, and athletes at the just-opened
Olympic Village have to rely on electric-powered space heaters for
warmth.
</P>
<P>
   Each bed comes topped with a thick quilt, or doona, that's
supposed to be as warm as two blankets. But Olympic organizers were
scrambling to provide another 3,900 blankets after some of the
athletes and coaches complained of the cold.
</P>
<P>
   ''We've asked for some more blankets because it's very cold in
some of the apartments,'' said Hajera Kajee, the deputy leader of
South Africa's team. ''There are heaters, but there are no plugs.''
</P>
<P>
   Even athletes from normally colder climes were caught off guard
by the chill.
</P>
<P>
   ''I thought Australia would be sunny and pretty hot, lots of
sand and kangaroos,'' said Dante Craig, a boxer in the 137-pound
class from Cincinnati. ''It's cold, and I haven't seen a kangaroo
yet.''
</P>
<P>
   Spring officially started here Sept. 1, about three weeks
earlier than the rest of the Southern Hemisphere. It may be winter
elsewhere below the equator but, hey, this is Australia, where the
lifeguard is an icon and the perfect tan sometimes seems to be a
national birthright.
</P>
<P>
   It actually was a mild winter, despite windy, chilly conditions
at the Australian Olympic track trials two weeks ago.
</P>
<P>
   And this week started nice, with sunny skies and temperatures in
the upper 60s and 70s, a bit above normal. Locals kept telling
skeptical newcomers they had just missed gorgeous weather, somewhat
like telling a fisherman with an empty creel that he should have
seen the ones they were landing yesterday.
</P>
<P>
   ''It got hot the last couple days,'' Craig said. ''But it has
been real chilly. I'm from Cincinnati, so it doesn't bother me.''
</P>
<P>
   At the media village, where about half the expected 5,858 guests
had checked in by Thursday afternoon, residents were sticking
rolled-up towels at the bottom of doorsills to keep the cold out.
</P>
<P>
   ''We usually have glorious weather here,'' said Geoffrey Bennun,
the village's manager. ''It's better to have rain now than after
the 15th,'' the first day of the games.
</P>
<P>
   ''Sure, we have to contend with the fact that it's a little bit
cold,'' Bennun said. ''But we expect the Canadians to be sturdy,
the Norwegians to be sturdy, the New Yorkers to be sturdy.''

<HEADLINE> Appeals court says executives did not profit before recall  </HEADLINE>
By JONATHAN POET
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHILADELPHIA (AP) - A federal appeals court, agreeing with a
lower court judgment, ruled Thursday that American Home Products
executives did not benefit from inside information about problems
with two popular diet drugs that were later recalled.
</P>
<P>
   The class-action lawsuit by shareholders claimed that executives
of the Madison, N.J.-based company made a profit of nearly $25
million from stock sales while failing to disclose problems with
one of the ingredients of fen-phen.
</P>
<P>
   The 3rd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals agreed with a federal
district judge, who ruled in February 1999 that shareholders did
not show that the stock sales by executives were unusual or
suspicious.
</P>
<P>
   The class-action lawsuit alleged that AHP knew of a Mayo Clinic
study linking fen-phen to potentially fatal heart valve damage in
March 1997, but did not tell investors. The drugs were withdrawn
from the market in September 1997.
</P>
<P>
   The appeals court ruled that AHP's silence on the Mayo Clinic
study was not misleading, since it did not have a duty under law to
inform shareholders. The judges also noted that AHP executives sold
more stock in 1996 than in 1997, the year the drugs were withdrawn
from the market, and that the trades ''were not suspicious in
scope.''
</P>
<P>
   Marian P. Rosner, a lawyer for the shareholders, said she had
not seen the decision, but that her team would consider an appeal.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think it's erroneous. I feel sorry for the shareholders,''
she said.
</P>
<P>
   Messages left for American Home Products' representatives were
not immediately returned.
</P>
<P>
   American Home Products made fenfluramine, half of the fen-phen
diet drug combination. The company sold the combination under the
brand name of Pondimin and also made Redux, a chemical cousin. The
second drug in Redux, phentermine, was not linked to heart valve
problems.
</P>
<P>
   Two weeks ago, a federal judge approved a $3.75 billion national
settlement of health claims stemming from the diet drug
combination. Under the settlement, fen-phen users would get up to
$1.5 million, though most would get far less, depending on their
level of injury and how long they took the drugs. The settlement
also includes money for future medical monitoring.

<HEADLINE> U.N. summit plus Met gala plus MTV Awards equals monster NYC gridlock </HEADLINE>
By DEEPTI HAJELA
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) - Traffic became a standing-room only affair in
parts of midtown Manhattan on Thursday as the United Nations'
Millennium Summit, a grand party for world leaders at the
Metropolitan Museum of Art and the annual MTV Video Awards combined
to cause hair-raising snarls.
</P>
<P>
   Protests near the U.N. - against American interference in Haiti,
human rights abuses in China and slavery in Sudan among scores of
other world issues - added to the usual bumper-to-bumper rush hour
mess.
</P>
<P>
   Several police officers on traffic detail described the volume
as ''Christmas time'' heavy.
</P>
<P>
   Periodic closures of the FDR Drive and streets and avenues on
the East Side near U.N. headquarters forced commuters there to find
new routes. And near Radio City Music Hall, where stars were
arriving for the MTV Video Music Awards, Sixth Avenue was shut down
to drivers - and in some spots, even to pedestrians.
</P>
<P>
   An evening gala for world leaders at the Metropolitan Museum of
Art, hosted by President Clinton, was bound to add to the tie-ups,
as scores of motorcades headed uptown.
</P>
<P>
   Mayor Rudolph Giuliani, who said he is honored that the city is
host to the summit, has at the same time complained about the
event's psychic and financial cost - traffic and heavy security for
the more than 150 world leaders who have gathered for the three-day
event.
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday, Giuliani sent a letter to President Clinton asking
that the federal government reimburse the city $25 million for its
expenses, ranging from overtime for the police and fire departments
to sanitation costs.
</P>
<P>
   ''New York's unique place in the world of international
diplomacy is a great honor, but it simultaneously imposes a
tremendous security burden, at a significant cost to New York City
taxpayers,'' Giuliani wrote. ''I am writing to ask you to take
action to guarantee that the city will receive funding for all
costs of providing security for foreign dignitaries and
international events, now and in the future.''
</P>
<P>
   Giuliani, who has long complained about foreign diplomats who do
not pay their city parking tickets, also released a list of the
biggest scofflaws, which was headed by Russia.
</P>
<P>
   Since 1995, Russian diplomats have received 63,834 parking
tickets and owe the city $7.2 million. Following Russia is
Indonesia, which owes $2.6 million; Egypt, which owes $2.4 million;
and Nigeria, which owes $2 million.
</P>
<P>
   Said Giuliani: ''If we can teach all of the countries that
belong to the United Nations to pay their parking tickets, which is
to meet their lawful obligation to the host country, maybe then
they would understand the rule of law.''
</P>
<P>
   Giuliani refused to attend Clinton's reception at the
Metropolitan Museum, saying some of the leaders attending ''have
murdered a lot of people.''
</P>
<P>
   He has been particularly critical of Palestinian leader Yasser
Arafat and Cuban President Fidel Castro, who he called ''a
murderer'' earlier this week. Cass0448-----

   ''The European Commission in no way intends to ... create a
situation to allow a player unilaterally to renege on a contract,''
EU Sports Commissioner Viviane Reding said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   European Union officials also chastised FIFA and UEFA, the
sport's world and European governing bodies, for letting the
current player movement rules get out of hand.
</P>
<P>
   After the EU's executive commission threatened to outlaw the
current soccer transfer system, FIFA agreed to revamp the system,
making a proposal Wednesday. The new plan included scrapping
transfer fees for players older than 24.
</P>
<P>
   Players in European leagues are not required to serve out their
contracts with a club if another team is willing to pay a transfer
fee to hire them.
</P>
<P>
   The EU stand raised fears that players would be able to leave
clubs at will.

<HEADLINE> Greek Victims Remember Quake  </HEADLINE>
By ELENA BECATOROS
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATHENS, Greece (AP) -- A dried wreath lies atop the rubble of a
factory complex that crumbled in seconds during a devastating
earthquake a year ago. A few yards away is a more bitter -- and some
say, more fitting -- memorial to the 38 people killed there.
</P>
<P>
   The sun-parched flowers commemorate the 143 people who died in
the 5.9 magnitude quake Sept. 7, 1999. The Ricomex factory had the
largest single death toll of the disaster.
</P>
<P>
   But a plain white marble monument, with a plaque reading
''Memorial of Disgrace'' above the names of the victims, stands as
a reminder of those who died at the household products plant.
</P>
<P>
   Relatives of those killed blame shoddy construction for the
collapse and are bitterly angry at Greek authorities for the slow
pace of an investigation into the factory's builders.
</P>
<P>
   ''The 'Disgrace' is for the state authorities who have been
silent until now, and for those who built this wreck,'' said
Stefanos Psiridis, whose sister Ioanna was killed in the collapse.
</P>
<P>
   As a sign of respect, shops remained closed Thursday in some of
the areas hardest hit last year. About 80 relatives clad in black,
many of them weeping, gathered at the Ricomex monument for a
memorial service.
</P>
<P>
   Most descended into the large crater, left when the rubble was
cleared, to lay flowers on the remaining wreckage. One wreath bore
the word ''murdered'' across the front.
</P>
<P>
   In the quake's aftermath, Greek authorities pledged to
investigate the construction quality of buildings that went down.
But investigations have been slowed by missing documents and other
problems.
</P>
<P>
   The quake damaged 70,000 buildings around the capital, leaving
about 100,000 people homeless. The factory was located near the
quake epicenter in Athens' northern suburbs.
</P>
<P>
   ''It was a great trial for our country, which struck many people
and had many detrimental side-effects,'' government spokesman
Tilemahos Hitiris said. ''One year later, many things remain to be
done.''
</P>
<P>
   ''An earthquake is a natural disaster. It is self-evident that
one can't press a button for everything to become perfect, as they
would want from one minute to the next,'' Hitiris added.
</P>
<P>
   Resettling and compensating quake victims and repairing damage
will cost $270 million, Planning Minister Costas Laliotis said.
</P>
<P>
   ''Although much has been done, there remains much more to do,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   Earthquakes last summer in both Turkey and Greece -- and the
mutual aid offered by the two neighbors -- have been credited with
helping warm relations between the two regional rivals. More than
17,000 people were killed in the Aug. 17, 1999, quake in
northwestern Turkey.
</P>
<P>
   But the diplomatic advances mean little to those still living in
temporary housing in Athens.
</P>
<P>
   About 6,000 families are staying in converted containers in
state camps. Although the government is providing low-interest
loans to help quake victims rebuild their homes, many complain that
the amounts are small and procedures to obtain them long-winded and
bureaucratic.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's hard and they ask for so many papers, so we gave up and
we're just funding the repairs ourselves,'' said Vasilis Kataras,
who said he had chosen to remain in his severely damaged home until
he began repairs a month ago.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's not possible to rebuild just with the money that they
give,'' said Mina Tordatzi as she watered plants in the garden she
has created outside her container home.
</P>
<P>
   Tordatzi, her husband and three grown children spent three
months living in a tent camp after the quake before they were moved
to the converted container camp in the Athens suburb of Menidi.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's OK living here -- better than living in those tents, in
that mess that we were in,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Many of the homeless families seem resigned to the idea that
they'll be living in the camp for many more months. Well-tended
gardens have appeared, and raised wooden porches with red tile
roofs have been added to the fronts of the plain containers.
</P>
<P>
   The family of Despina Iliadou built an extension to theirs to
create a living room.
</P>
<P>
   ''I took all my plants from my house and brought them here,''
said Iliadou, proudly displaying her tidy home. ''I can't stand
wretchedness.''

<HEADLINE> NFL Suspends Carrier for Fifth Time  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   ASHBURN, Va. (AP) -- Washington Redskins safety Mark Carrier was
suspended by the NFL for the fifth time in his career Thursday, the
latest for one game for a helmet-to-helmet hit in the season
opener.
</P>
<P>
   The league announced that Commissioner Paul Tagliabue will also
consider imposing an additional fine on the 11-year veteran, who
will miss Sunday's game against the Detroit Lions.
</P>
<P>
   The NFL first disciplined him earlier this week for the hit on
Carolina Panthers tight end Wesley Walls, but the Redskins appealed
Wednesday. Carrier and Redskins director of player personnel Vinny
Cerrato met with NFL officials in New York on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   The Redskins refused to discuss the matter until Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking after the final decision was made, Carrier denied it
was a malicious hit.
</P>
<P>
   ''I play football, made a play on the ball, knocked the ball
down, and me and the gentleman collided,'' he said. ''I thought I'd
at least show them what happened and go from there. But I've been
through it enough times, and I know what to expect from the
league.''
</P>
<P>
   The hit occurred late in the second quarter of Washington's
20-17 victory. Carolina faced a second-and-goal at the 22, when
quarterback Steve Beuerlein tried to hit Walls just inside the 10.
The ball was there, but Carrier jarred Walls from behind almost
simultaneously to break up the pass. Walls lay sprawled for several
minutes but walked off the field.
</P>
<P>
   Coaches and teammates have said during the week that Carrier did
nothing illegal.
</P>
<P>
   ''Mark gets both hands on the ball, his vision is clearly
directed at the ball, there's contact,'' Turner said. ''I don't
know that he could have avoided contact the way it happened and
still played the ball.''
</P>
<P>
   Cornerback Deion Sanders said: ''It wasn't like Mark really
tried to hit him. If he had tried to hit him, he probably would
have really laid him out. But he was going for the ball. He really
had his hand stretched out on the ball. It was an awfully good
football play.''
</P>
<P>
   Over the past decade Carrier has earned a reputation as one of
the NFL's dirtiest players. Last season, he was suspended for a
game and fined $50,000 for a hit on Green Bay wide receiver Antonio
Freeman. In 1998, he was suspended for a game, costing him about
$25,000, for a helmet-to-helmet hit that gave Tampa Bay's Brice
Hunter a concussion.
</P>
<P>
   Carrier accused the NFL of punishing him to set an example.
</P>
<P>
   ''No doubt about it,'' he said. ''They said in the meeting to me
that we have to make a point throughout the NFL that this can't go
on, that it's unnecessary.''
</P>
<P>
   Carrier played his first seven seasons in Chicago -- making the
Pro Bowl in 1990, 1991 and 1993 -- and the last three in Detroit. A
free agent, he signed a five-year, $15.9 million contract with the
Redskins in February as part of owner Daniel Snyder's offseason
spending spree.
</P>
<P>
   He said it hurts having to miss Sunday's game Detroit, one of
his former teams, and Sanders concurs.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm sure he's having it tough,'' Sanders said. ''You want to
play against your old team. It's like me getting suspended before
the Dallas game for a hard hit, which won't happen. He's not going
to get the opportunity.''
</P>
<P>
   Matt Stevens, a fifth-year player, will replace Carrier. Stevens
led the Redskins with six interceptions in 1999.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is really going to affect our whole secondary because
Mark is the quarterback of the entire secondary,'' Sanders said.

<HEADLINE> Blue Jays' Mondesi Will Try Again  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   TORONTO (AP) -- Toronto Blue Jays outfielder Raul Mondesi, who
had surgery on his right elbow on Aug. 14, will try to play again
this season.
</P>
<P>
   Mondesi, eligible to come off the 60-day disabled list on Sept.
20, threw for the first time in five weeks. He will take batting
practice on Friday.
</P>
<P>
   ''I feel good,'' Mondesi, who had 14 bone chips removed from his
elbow, said Thursday. ''I'll see how I feel, and how the team does
in the next couple of weeks. If we're in contention for the
playoffs I'll try to come back.''
</P>
<P>
   The Blue Jays began the day 4&AMP;frac12; games behind Cleveland in the
wild card race.
</P>
<P>
   Mondesi said he would also consider playing if the Blue Jays are
out of contention.
</P>
<P>
   ''It depends on what the trainers, the manager and the owner
says,'' Mondesi said.
</P>
<P>
   Mondesi, acquired from Los Angeles in the offseason, hit .272
with 24 homers and 67 RBIs in 95 games.
</P>
<P>
   He'd been away from the team for a few weeks, but when he walked
onto the field before the game, his teammates gave him a loud
ovation
</P>
<P>
   ''He's a presence in the clubhouse,'' Toronto manager Jim
Fregosi said. ''He plays with such abandonment. He's an integral
part of our offense and defense.''

<HEADLINE> School year in limbo as Buffalo teachers strike  </HEADLINE>
By CAROLYN THOMPSON
<TEXT>
<P>
   BUFFALO, N.Y. (AP) - School district and union officials set to
work plotting their next moves after a surprise teachers' strike
threw the young school year into limbo.
</P>
<P>
   As teachers walked picket lines Thursday, a state mediator met
individually with both sides and union officials delivered a
counter offer to the Board of Education's latest contract proposal.
</P>
<P>
   Shortly before 8 p.m. Thursday, District Superintendent Marion
Canedo canceled classes for Friday, saying she had not heard
anything from the union and wanted to give parents and guardians as
much time as possible to prepare for another day without school.
</P>
<P>
   Board President Paul Buchanan said the sides were not as far
apart as it might appear.
</P>
<P>
   ''That's why the strike is so surprising,'' he said. ''We're
down to maybe four or five unresolved issues after bargaining now
for half a year.''
</P>
<P>
   Buffalo Teachers Federation President Philip Rumore had a much
different take.
</P>
<P>
   ''Their proposal was so far away from what's acceptable,'' he
said. ''It's absolutely mind-boggling they should be able to think
there wouldn't have been a strike.''
</P>
<P>
   The two sides remained at odds over wages, health care
concessions, and a provision to contract with outside social
agencies.
</P>
<P>
   The strike was called less than an hour before Thursday's start
of school, forcing the cancellation of what would have been the
second day of classes for 47,000 students.
</P>
<P>
   Thousands of children and their parents were already out the
door on the way to school and work and parents were left scrambling
to find child care.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's just frustrating to have 20 minutes notice,'' said Audrey
Sanders, an architect who took her three children to work with her.
</P>
<P>
   School buses already en route were turned around and returned
the children home. In about 50 cases where no adults were home,
young children were brought to schools and spent the day under the
supervision of administrators, Buchanan said.
</P>
<P>
   ''There were no lost children, no injuries, there was no
violence,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Under state law which prohibits teachers from striking, the
district's 3,800 teachers stand to lose two days pay for each day
on strike. They also could face jail time for defying a court
injunction obtained by the Board of Education forbidding the
walkout. A hearing on the injunction is scheduled for Monday.
</P>
<P>
   ''This move is something that we've been forced into,'' Rumore
said. ''This is not something that we do lightly.''
</P>
<P>
   The teachers' latest contract expired in June 1999.
</P>
<P>
   Rumore said teachers were insulted by the district's latest
four-year offer that included no pay raise the first year and
raises of 2 percent in each of the subsequent years.
</P>
<P>
   District officials countered that the union did not take into
account built-in pay increments of 1 to 5 percent that would come
on top of the across-the-board raises.
</P>
<P>
   ''Our settlement package is right in the middle of what
districts in western New York are settling for,'' Buchanan said.
''The total average is 3.9 percent a year for four years and the
average in western New York is 3.5 percent to 4.5 percent.''
</P>
<P>
   The union is seeking raises closer to 4.9 percent, he said.
</P>
<P>
   While the strike was citywide on Thursday, Rumore left open the
possibility that it would be scaled back to selected schools in the
future.
</P>
<P>
   But Buchanan said without a complete halt to the strike, schools
would remain closed.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's the only safe and responsible way to guarantee the safety
of the schoolchildren,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Buffalo teachers struck illegally for 13 days in 1976.

<HEADLINE> Judge throws out challenge to city's parade rules  </HEADLINE>
By SAMUEL MAULL
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) - A Manhattan judge threw out a petition Thursday
by organizers of Saturday's Labor Day Parade who challenged the
city's planned enforcement of rules that ban cooking at parades.
</P>
<P>
   State Supreme Court Justice Bruce Allen said it was unfortunate
that the city did not mention the rule enforcement issue earlier,
given the parade's history and the three months of negotiations for
the parade permit.
</P>
<P>
   ''However,'' Allen said, ''it does not follow that the city can
be enjoined from enforcing existing regulations.'' The judge also
noted that city officials never told the parade planners that
cooking would be allowed.
</P>
<P>
   The Central Labor Council, a coalition of about 500 unions, will
appeal Allen's decision on Friday, union lawyer Douglas Menagh
said.
</P>
<P>
   Sunny Mindel, spokeswoman for the mayor, issued a statement:
''We applaud the judge's decision which is in the best interests of
the city's public safety. We're sure this will not at all impede on
the event or its success, and they will have another great
parade.''
</P>
<P>
   The council had complained that the unions stood to lose
hundreds of thousands of dollars because the city, after three
months of talks, did not tell parade planners until Aug. 30 about
the parade rule enforcement.
</P>
<P>
   Ted Jacobsen, secretary of the Labor Council, said in an
affidavit that the unions had spent money on food, including hot
dogs, hamburgers, buns, sweet rolls and drinks, and on cooking and
refrigeration equipment.
</P>
<P>
   The council argued that the city's new rules were not legally
enacted, and that the old rules had not been enforced in past years
and therefore the city should not be allowed to start enforcing
them now.
</P>
<P>
   ''We are not against changing the rules,'' the council said in a
statement. ''Our main argument is that rules should not be changed
after all preparations are completed.''
</P>
<P>
   City lawyers contended that the city is only enforcing existing
laws, but Allen said some of the rules - such as the limit on the
height of floats - appeared to be new. He also noted that the law
has exceptions to the ''open-flame'' rule.
</P>
<P>
   In dismissing the council's petition, Allen said expects that
''existing general regulations, rather than special rules, are to
be enforced.''

<HEADLINE> ESPN Gets More Tiger On Air  </HEADLINE>
By HOWARD FENDRICH
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- All Tiger, all the time.
</P>
<P>
   That's what networks want when it comes to televising a PGA Tour
tournament, and that's what they are increasingly maneuvering to
get.
</P>
<P>
   ESPN and ESPN2 are the latest channels to do whatever they can
to put Tiger Woods up front and center on a golf broadcast,
increasing coverage of the Canadian Open on Thursday and Friday.
</P>
<P>
   ESPN, which is airing all four rounds of the tournament,
originally was slated to broadcast from 4-6 p.m. EDT both Thursday
and Friday.
</P>
<P>
   But when Woods' tee times for the two days were announced, ESPN
went into talks to be able to show his rounds live.
</P>
<P>
   Instead of 4 p.m., Thursday's first round went on the air at
12:30 p.m. -- because Woods was slated to tee off at 12:47. ESPN
made sure to show nearly each and every one of his 72 strokes
Thursday -- seven behind first-round leader Kevin Sutherland -- as he
tried to become the first golfer since 1971 to win the British,
U.S. and Canadian Opens in the same year.
</P>
<P>
   Then, because Woods was given a 7:57 a.m. tee time for Friday's
second round, ESPN2 added a window for the tournament from 8 a.m.
to 1 p.m.
</P>
<P>
   ''We made an arrangement with the PGA Tour that allowed us to
extend our coverage,'' ESPN spokesman Josh Krulewitz said.
</P>
<P>
   He would not provide any details.
</P>
<P>
   Woods' mere presence in a tournament can boost TV ratings by 50
to 100 percent, and his draw on audiences is even stronger when
he's in contention.
</P>
<P>
   At last month's Buick Open, The Golf Channel devoted most of its
first-round coverage to Woods even though he finished his 18 holes
nearly four hours before the live broadcast opened.
</P>
<P>
   His play was shown on tape, and the channel apologized to
viewers the next day.
</P>
<P>
   The PGA Tour took advantage of his breakthrough victory at the
1997 Masters to negotiate a new TV rights deal, and talks start
next year on a new contract -- with Woods more popular than ever on
the strength of three consecutive victories at Grand Slam events.

<HEADLINE> Yankees To Shut Down Mendoza  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   KANSAS CITY, Mo. (AP) -- Ramiro Mendoza might have thrown his
last pitch for the New York Yankees this year.
</P>
<P>
   Mendoza will be shut down by the Yankees because of pain in his
right shoulder, prompting manager Joe Torre to say Thursday, ''I
can't think of what condition he might pitch in again this
season.''
</P>
<P>
   Mendoza was placed on the disabled list Aug. 3 for the second
time this season with tendinitis. He was originally put on the DL
on June 25, and had pitched only once in between, giving up four
runs in one-third of an inning against Minnesota on July 29.
</P>
<P>
   Torre said he was encouraged with the progress Mendoza had made
in two simulated games. But ''yesterday he couldn't throw,'' the
manager said before Thursday night's game against Kansas City.
</P>
<P>
   ''There may be something going on that we don't know about,''
Torre said. ''We're going to shut him down.''
</P>
<P>
   Mendoza has been one of New York's most valuable pitchers,
mainly because of his versatility. The two-time World Series
champion Yankees lead the AL East.
</P>
<P>
   Mendoza was 7-4 with a 4.25 ERA this season in 14 games, nine of
them starts.
</P>
<P>
   Torre said that Mendoza was discouraged by the news.
</P>
<P>
   ''You could tell by the look on his face,'' Torre said. ''He
tried to smile but it wasn't real. I told him, 'You'll come back,
unless you've lied to me about your age. If you're really 42, I
can't offer a lot of encouragement.' That made him smile, but it
didn't last.''
</P>
<P>
   Torre didn't know if Mendoza, 28, would be sent back to New York
or to rehabilitation in Florida.
</P>
<P>
   In Tuesday night's game against Kansas City, the Yankees lost
pitcher David Cone to a separated left shoulder. It is uncertain
when Cone will pitch again.

<HEADLINE> Galarraga Starts Suspension  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA (AP) -- Atlanta Braves first baseman Andres Galarraga
began serving a three-game suspension Thursday night for charging
the mound and fighting with Colorado's John Wasdin.
</P>
<P>
   Galarraga initially appealed his suspension and fine, saying his
actions Aug. 22 were justified because the Wasdin challenged him to
fight as the Braves star walked slowly to first.
</P>
<P>
   Colorado manager Buddy Bell and Wasdin were each suspended for
two games each and fined by Frank Robinson, baseball's vice
president of discipline.
</P>
<P>
   Baseball officials planned to fly to Atlanta on Thursday to
consider Galarraga's argument.
</P>
<P>
   ''There was no sense doing that,'' Braves manager Bobby Cox
said. ''They were not going to change it.''
</P>
<P>
   So, Galarraga began serving his suspension in the final game of
a series against Arizona. He also will miss games Friday and
Saturday against Montreal.

<HEADLINE> Astros 7, Marlins 3  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   HOUSTON (AP) -- Chris Truby appreciated his second opportunity to
come through in the clutch.
</P>
<P>
   Truby singled home the go-ahead run in the eighth inning,
leading Scott Elarton and the Houston Astros over the Florida
Marlins 7-3 Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Truby's hit came after the Marlins intentionally walked Mitch
Meluskey. In the fourth inning, after an intentional walk to
Meluskey, Truby popped up with the bases loaded.
</P>
<P>
   ''I was glad to get another chance. You don't get too many
chances like that and I was kind of upset at myself after the first
time because I swung at some bad pitches,'' Truby said.
</P>
<P>
   Truby wasn't insulted by the intentional walks to Meluskey.
</P>
<P>
   ''You try not to take that angle,'' Truby said. ''You try just
to go up and have a quality at-bat. I told myself just to be
patient and wait until he put a fastball in a good place. It was a
good feeling, especially to help Scott get the win. He deserved
it.''
</P>
<P>
   Florida interim manager Fredi Gonzalez made the decision to walk
Meluskey.
</P>
<P>
   ''I thought we had a better chance with Truby than with
Meluskey,'' Gonzalez said. ''(Dan) Miceli made a good pitch. He got
it in, but Truby was strong enough to get it over the infield and
that opened up the flood gates.''
</P>
<P>
   Gonzalez is filling while manager John Boles is in Chicago with
his ailing father.
</P>
<P>
   Elarton (16-5) won for the 12th time in 14 decisions since June
22. He pitched eight innings, giving up three runs and seven hits.
</P>
<P>
   With the score 3-all, Lance Berkman drew a leadoff walk from
Miceli (6-4) in the Astros eighth and pinch-runner Glen Barker
stole second. After Meluskey was walked, Truby singled.
</P>
<P>
   Pinch-hitter Daryle Ward hit an RBI single and pinch-hitter
Moises Alou had a two-run double.
</P>
<P>
   Derrek Lee led off the Marlins seventh with his 24th home run,
tying it at 3.
</P>
<P>
   Jeff Bagwell and Julio Lugo homered in the fifth to put Houston
ahead 3-2. Lugo hit a leadoff home run and Bagwell hit his 41st, a
two-run shot.
</P>
<P>
   It was Bagwell's 24th home run in his home park, breaking his
Astros record of 23 home-park homers set in 1994. He is two home
runs short of matching his team record of 43 set in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   Florida took a 2-0 lead in the fourth. Alex Gonzalez led off
with a home run, and the Marlins loaded the bases when Henry
Rodriguez walked and Preston Wilson and Mike Lowell singled. Mark
Smith hit an RBI single.
</P>
<P>
   Houston managed to load the bases in the fourth with two outs,
but Ryan Dempster retired Truby on a fly ball.
Notes: Gonzalez extended his career-high hitting streak to 12
games ... Elarton is 8-0 in day games this season ... Meluskey has
hit 14 home runs this season, two short of the Houston record for a
catcher set by John Bateman in 1966.

<HEADLINE> Chambers Can't Serve Suspension Now  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   MADISON, Wis. (AP) -- Wisconsin wide receiver Chris Chambers
won't be allowed to serve his three-game suspension while injured
after all.
</P>
<P>
   NCAA spokesman Wally Renfro said Thursday the organization was
incorrect when it announced last week a player can serve a
suspension while too injured to play.
</P>
<P>
   But the NCAA does not determine if a player is physically unable
to play, leaving that decision up to the university.
</P>
<P>
   Chambers is one of 26 Wisconsin football players the NCAA
suspended last weeks for one to three games for receiving
unadvertised discounts at a shore store.
</P>
<P>
   The NCAA gave the university a four-week window for players to
serve the suspensions, beginning with Wisconsin's season opener
against Western Michigan last week and ending with its game against
Northwestern on Sept. 23.
</P>
<P>
   The fifth-ranked Badgers play Oregon on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   Renfro said Wisconsin compliance officer Tim Bald has been told
Chambers won't be able to serve the suspension while injured.
</P>
<P>
   Bald declined to comment when contacted by The Associated Press
on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Chambers was expected to be out until at least the end of
September because of a stress fracture in his right foot.
</P>
<P>
   Coaches listed him as one of the players suspended for the
Western Michigan game, believing he might be able to serve out his
discipline while injured.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, Chambers will likely have to sit out until at least
mid-October.
</P>
<P>
   He led the team last year in receptions (41), receiving yards
(578) and receiving touchdowns (4).

<HEADLINE> Gadhafi: US-Libya Ties Normalizing  </HEADLINE>
By MAAMOUN YOUSSEF
<TEXT>
<P>
   CAIRO, Egypt (AP) -- Libyan leader Moammar Gadhafi expressed
optimism Thursday that his country's strained relations with the
United States could be eased and normal ties restored.
</P>
<P>
   ''I believe there is nothing which prevents the resuming or
normalizing of relations between the two countries,'' Gadhafi told
CNN in a live interview monitored in Cairo.
</P>
<P>
   Still considered a sponsor of terrorism by the United States,
Libya has made steps in recent years to rebuild its international
status. Last year, it handed over suspects in the 1988 bombing of
Pan Am Flight 103, and in recent weeks the country was key in
negotiating the release of six Western hostages held in the
Philippines.
</P>
<P>
   ''It is now a new era,'' Gadhafi said. America should
''reconsider its imperialist approach, because it does not fit with
the new era and it will fail in the end,'' he added.
</P>
<P>
   Gadhafi sharply attacked the United Nations when he was asked
about being absent from the worldwide U.N. summit ongoing in New
York.
</P>
<P>
   ''Do you expect me to cross the Atlantic Ocean to speak for five
minutes? The U.N. is not real now; when it is reformed, we would
think of talking there,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Relations between the United States and Libya deteriorated
during the 1970s and 1980s over accusations that Gadhafi was aiding
terrorists. The United States imposed trade sanctions against Libya
in 1986, blaming the North African nation for a bomb blast that
killed three people at a West Berlin disco frequented by U.S.
servicemen.
</P>
<P>
   Gadhafi's adopted daughter was killed when the United States
bombed Tripoli and the port city of Benghazi in retaliation for the
disco blast.
</P>
<P>
   A U.S. Congress research service report last month said Libya
appeared to have sharply reduced its support of international
terrorist groups, and the United States is considering lifting an
American travel ban after a fact-finding visit to Libya in April by
a State Department delegation.

<HEADLINE> Slain UN Worker's Kin Want Answers  </HEADLINE>
By MICHELLE FAUL
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN JUAN, Puerto Rico (AP) -- Their son is dead -- and the family
of the American relief worker slain in a militia-led rampage in
West Timor wants answers from the United Nations and Indonesia: Why
was Carlos Caceres allowed to work without protection even after he
received a death threat?
</P>
<P>
   ''They should have got him out of there,'' the victim's father,
Gregorio Caceres, told The Associated Press from his home in
Jacksonville, Fla., on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   A mob led by militiamen stormed the U.N. office Wednesday in
Atambua, West Timor, and killed three U.N. aid workers -- including
Caceres, 33, who was born in San Juan.
</P>
<P>
   Witnesses said militiamen beat and stabbed the three foreign men
before mutilating their bodies and burning them in the street.
Other U.N. workers were cut by machetes and axes but escaped.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier Wednesday, Caceres sent an e-mail to a friend, a U.N.
security official in Macedonia, saying he had heard that ''a wave
of violence would soon pound Atambua. ...
</P>
<P>
   ''We sit here like bait, unarmed,'' he wrote. ''We are waiting
for the enemy.''
</P>
<P>
   Caceres had expected to be evacuated weeks before, said his
father, who last saw his son on a Christmas visit in Florida.
Caceres last telephoned his father Aug. 26.
</P>
<P>
   ''I was in fear for him. He told me, 'Dad, as we speak there is
danger. ... He told me he was going to evacuate himself and his
co-workers from that location to another location because of the
danger,'' Gregorio Caceres said.
</P>
<P>
   ''One of the questions I have for the United Nations -- and I
spoke to them yesterday and today -- I asked: He knew he was in
danger and he told me he was going to be evacuated. What
happened?''
</P>
<P>
   The father said a Geneva official of the U.N. High Commissioner
for Refugees told him the United Nations had evacuated its workers
two weeks earlier and only sent them back after the Indonesian
government promised its soldiers would ensure their safety.
</P>
<P>
   UNHCR spokesman Kris Janowski noted the aid operation has been
repeatedly shut down after attacks by militia gangs on its staff
and buildings in recent months and that several workers received
death threats.
</P>
<P>
   ''There's always, for us, the dilemma of striking the right
balance between helping the people in need and putting our own
staff at risk,'' Janowski said. ''In Atambua on Wednesday this
balance was upset and we suffered the worst incident in UNHCR's
history.''
</P>
<P>
   The UNHCR had received warning of possible trouble and was
assured by Indonesian security forces that agency staff would be
protected. But witnesses said Indonesian troops stood by during the
attack.
</P>
<P>
   World leaders at the Millennium Summit at the United Nations
castigated Indonesia, an embarrassment to visiting Indonesian
President Abdurrahman Wahid.
</P>
<P>
   Carlos Caceres had told his family that he knew some militia
leaders were close to Indonesian army commanders. He said he once
saw a militia leader giving an order to Indonesian troops, called
TNI. He also said that the Indonesian military had ignored him when
he said he had received a death threat from a militia leader.
</P>
<P>
   ''Despite the fact that over 70 TNI and police personnel were
present at the scene, it is known that one refugee was beaten ...
by militia elements,'' Caceres told his family.
</P>
<P>
   When Caceres tried to protect the refugee -- his job as a
protection officer -- a militia leader he identified as Manek told
Indonesian troops to escort him away.
</P>
<P>
   ''It was clear that Manek had authority over the TNI and that
any order he made was going to be followed,'' Caceres wrote.
</P>
<P>
   A month ago, Caceres sent an e-mail to his sister Elba, in
Miami, noting, ''The militia, by the way, hate me.''
</P>
<P>
   He implied he was not getting much help in the last message
received by his family four days ago. ''Here things are difficult,
but one keeps working, with or without international support.''
</P>
<P>
   Caceres' grieving parents are puzzled by what lured their eldest
child and only son so far from home.
</P>
<P>
   His mother, Josefa Collazo, said she once asked him why he
didn't work as a lawyer in Miami, where she lives. ''He said, 'I
like what I am doing: to see how other people are living, to see
what they need, and to be able to help them.''
</P>
<P>
   Caceres' family moved to Miami in the 1970s. Caceres studied
journalism at the University of Florida, then law at Cornell and
went to Britain's Oxford University. He earned three doctorates and
spoke five languages, including Czech and Russian, which he learned
on assignment with the UNHCR in Moscow.
</P>
<P>
   In East Timor, he wrote to sister Elba, he was the only
foreigner for miles around Betun, a jungle village near the border.
</P>
<P>
   ''I became an instant celebrity. Flocks of people follow me
wherever I go, everyone screams 'hello mister'' when they see me,''
he said. ''I attempted jogging once, and didn't do it again.
</P>
<P>
   ''I couldn't get a second of solitude and everyone started
running after me. It was scary because I thought the militia was
trying to get me!''

<HEADLINE> Judge rules sled dogs must be returned to owner  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   QUEENSBURY, N.Y. (AP) - A judge has ruled that 13 sled dogs must
be returned to the couple that was acquitted last month of
neglecting dozens of their dogs.
</P>
<P>
   The Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals of Upstate
New York has vowed to fight the return of the 13 dogs to Mark and
Lisa Labrecque until the couple pays nearly $29,000 in boarding and
medical fees owed the SPCA's shelter for boarding the dogs since
Jan. 24.
</P>
<P>
   The SPCA seized 45 dogs from the couple's home after five
puppies were found dead on their property. The Labrecques forfeited
possession of all but the 13 dogs remaining in the SPCA's shelter.
On Aug. 21, a jury found them innocent of animal cruelty and the
Labrecques filed suit against the SPCA, saying it has no right to
hold the dogs now that the criminal case has ended.
</P>
<P>
   Warren County Judge John Austin agreed, ruling that since the
jury decided the Labrecques did not violate the state Agriculture
and Markets Law, as the SPCA claimed, the same law must be used to
return the dogs.
</P>
<P>
   The lawyer for the SPCA, who said he would seek a stay to keep
the dogs at the SPCA, argued that the animal protective
organization had a valid lien against the Labrecques and was hold
the dogs as collateral. Tucker Stanclift also said the matter is
now civil, not criminal, and must be heard in state Supreme Court,
not a county court.

<HEADLINE> Hillary Clinton education speech marred by hecklers; PBA endorses Lazio </HEADLINE>
By VERENA DOBNIK
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) - Hillary Rodham Clinton's speech on new education
proposals ended Thursday with a nasty outburst - the epithet ''Jew
hater!'' hurled at her from the audience.
</P>
<P>
   ''Hillary hates Israel!'' screamed two lone ultra-Orthodox
Jewish youths as she wound up her appearance before students at
Queens College.
</P>
<P>
   ''Out smut!'' yelled back a student.
</P>
<P>
   The first lady's Secret Service agents rushed out the two
members of Kahane Chai, a militant Jewish group. Clinton proceeded
with a question-and-answer session during which she outlined her
views on the Middle East.
</P>
<P>
   ''Having a Palestinian state would make sense,'' she said,
reiterating a position she first took two years ago. However, she
insisted, such a step could only come as part of a comprehensive
Middle East peace accord, not as a sudden ''unilateral move'' by
the Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
   It was not quite the subject the U.S. Senate candidate, joined
by daughter Chelsea, had prepared for her speech to hundreds of
students.
</P>
<P>
   With New York public schools opening this week, Clinton had come
to outline three new proposals for better learning, noting that in
America's booming economy, ''education is the fault line between
those who will move ahead and those who are left behind.''
</P>
<P>
   If elected senator, she said she would try to fill that gap -
widened in New York by overcrowded classrooms, often poorly trained
teachers, a large turnover among principals and safety problems.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, her Senate rival, Republican Rep. Rick Lazio, was at
City Hall, picking up an endorsement from the union that represents
27,000 city police officers.
</P>
<P>
   Patrolmen's Benevolent Association President Patrick Lynch
called Lazio a ''true friend and supporter of our cops.'' He said
the group's decision was based in part on Lazio's opposition to
appointing a federal monitor to oversee the NYPD and to the
congressman's support of the death penalty.
</P>
<P>
   ''We urge all New York City police officers and their friends
and families to help make Rick Lazio our next U.S. Senator,'' Lynch
said.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton has said the decision regarding the federal monitor
should be left to the Justice Department. She also supports the
death penalty.
</P>
<P>
   Introducing her new education proposals in Queens, she said
public schools ''are local responsibilities, but they must be a
national priority.''
</P>
<P>
   In the city, she said, 163 schools are opening with temporary
administrators instead of principals.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton proposed what she called a National Principal Corps to
attract 10,000 new principals over five years, at a cost of $60
million. The federal Department of Education would provide matching
grants to school districts that offer principals professional
development.
</P>
<P>
   Also using federal matching grants, Clinton said she supports
dividing mammoth schools, especially high schools, into smaller
ones. Her third proposal would require schools, as a condition of
receiving federal money, to give parents exact information about
how many youths had brought weapons to school, the number of fights
and disruptions in classrooms and violence toward teachers.
</P>
<P>
   If elected, Clinton said she also would support adding 100,000
well-qualified new teachers across the nation, offering them
financial incentives for good work and extra training.
</P>
<P>
   In a campaign press release, Lazio slammed Clinton's record on
education as ''disastrous,'' charging that the Arkansas education
system got worse after she headed a commission on improving it,
even as state spending on education increased.
</P>
<P>
   When Clinton finished speaking, she and Chelsea plunged into an
audience that personified the city's diversity, from young Muslim
women wearing scarves to Asian, black and white students.
</P>
<P>
   The two hecklers - Benjamin Peker, 19, a student at Brooklyn
Tech, and Jodi Posner, 21, who works for Kahane Chai - meanwhile
joined a dozen members of the group protesting in front of the
building.
</P>
<P>
   They were challenged by a Jewish student, Tim Rosen, a Queens
College political science major who told them: ''To say that
Hillary is anti-Semitic is outrageous. She has shown she is an
adamant supporter of Israel.''
</P>
<P>
   Later Thursday, after flying to Washington to join an
unsuccessful Republican-led effort to override President Clinton's
veto of a bill to abolish inheritance taxes, Lazio returned to New
York to greet commuters at the North Brewster Metro-North train
station in Putnam County.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm madly in love with him,'' swooned Southeast town clerk
Ruth Mazzei after the candidate kissed her hand. Other riders,
eager to get home, shook Lazio's hand and hurried along.
</P>
<P>
   On Long Island, Clinton was cheered by members of the Teamsters
labor union at an evening rally in Lake Success. The union endorsed
her last year.

   KNOXVILLE, Tenn. (AP) -- Tennessee quarterback Joey Mathews left
practice early Thursday because of a knee injury, and is scheduled
to have an MRI exam Friday.
</P>

   ''He just kind of felt it pop,'' Vols coach Phillip Fulmer said.
''It's obviously a concern to us. He said he didn't know when he
did it or if he did it.''
</P>
<P>
   Mathews practiced Tuesday and Wednesday, leaving each day with
an ice bag wrapped around his left knee.
</P>
<P>
   The No. 12 Volunteers are idle this weekend. They will face No.
8 Florida next Saturday.

<HEADLINE> Notes From Thursday's Baseball Games  </HEADLINE>
By The Associated PressAMERICAN LEAGUE:
Twins-Red Sox:
<TEXT>
<P>
   MINNESOTA: Minnesota beat Boston just twice in eight games this
season. ... Eric Milton lasted just 3 1-3 innings, his shortest
start since going just three innings against the Red Sox on the
Fourth of July. ... David Ortiz hit his first career grand slam and
matched a career high with four RBIs.
</P>
<P>
   BOSTON: Dante Bichette, acquired on Aug. 31 before playoff
rosters were set, hit his second homer with Boston to go with 16 in
Cincinnati. ... The Red Sox have 12 of their next 16 games against
either the Yankees, who lead the AL East, or Cleveland, which leads
the AL wild card race. ... Ramon Martinez has allowed at least one
run the first inning in 12 of 23 starts. Eight times he has allowed
multiple first-inning runs. ... Boston reliever Rich Garces left
with a right groin strain after getting two outs. He was considered
day-to-day.
Angels-Tigers:
</P>
<P>
   ANAHEIM: The Angels did not homer in the first three games of
their series in Detroit, matching their longest homerless stretch
of the season (April 15-17). ... 2B Adam Kennedy entered Thursday
needing 14 hits to become just the third Angel with at least 150
hits his rookie year. Wally Joyner had 172 in 1986 and Devon White
168 in 1987.
</P>
<P>
   DETROIT: OF Juan Gonzalez's flu is worse than originally
thought. ''He's going to go to the hospital and get it checked
out,'' manager Phil Garner said before Gonzalez missed his third
straight game Thursday. ''He's worse today.'' ... OF Juan
Encarnacion was hurting from fouling a ball off his foot Wednesday
and was out of Thursday's lineup. ... Bench coach Bob Melvin,
suffering from a viral infection in his middle ear, was released
from a Detroit hospital Thursday but is still several days away
from rejoining the team. ''He's very weak,'' Garner said. Bullpen
coach Lance Parrish is filling in for Melvin.
Devil Rays-Indians:
</P>
<P>
   TAMPA BAY: Three of the four Devil Rays on the U.S. Olympic team
played in a 11-2 exhibition win over Italy on Wednesday night in
Australia. C Pat Borders went 0-for-3, 2B Brent Abernathy went
1-for-2 and scored and LHP Bobby Seay pitched a hitless inning. RHP
Matt White is also on the team. ... OF Greg Vaughn needs five
homers to become the third player in history to hit 30 homers with
four different clubs. Teammate Fred McGriff and ex-Tampa player
Jose Canseco are the others. ... RHP Cory Lidle concluded his
three-game suspension for his part in an Aug. 29 brawl with Boston.
Manager Larry Rothschild served the second game of his three-game
suspension, and OF Gerald Williams and RHPs Dave Eiland and Tony
Fiore remained active pending appeal of their suspensions.
</P>
<P>
   CLEVELAND: Manager Charlie Manuel said RHP Charles Nagy may not
go to Triple-A Buffalo for a rehab start as planned. Nagy told
Manuel that he thought pitching a simulated game in Cleveland would
accomplish the same goal. Barring any setbacks, Nagy, who underwent
elbow surgery in May, will start Sept. 14 against the Boston Red
Sox. ... LHP Ricardo Rincon, who was on the disabled list more than
three months, has not allowed any of his 16 inherited runners to
score this season. ... RHP Danys Baez, the Cuban defector who
signed a four-year, $14.5 million contract this winter, will not be
called up by the Indians this month. Baez went 6-11 with a 4.02 ERA
at Kinston (A) and Akron (AA) this season. He's scheduled to pitch
in the Arizona Fall League.
Mariners-Blue Jays:
</P>
<P>
   SEATTLE: Rickey Henderson led off two of his previous three
games against Toronto starter Steve Trachsel with a homer.
Henderson singled in his first at-bat Friday night. ... Edgar
Martinez entered the game with 128 RBIs. That's the second-most
ever by a player 37 year old or older. Martinez is 37. ... Seattle
starter Freddy Garcia threw seven straight balls leading off the
second.
</P>
<P>
   TORONTO: Christine Cho, Miss Canada 2001, threw out the
ceremonial first pitch. ... SkyDome's roof was open for the first
time in five games. ... For the second straight season the Dunedin
Blue Jays (A ball) have reached the finals in the Florida State
League.
Yankees-Royals:
</P>
<P>
   NEW YORK: LHP Randy Keisler will make his major league debut on
Sunday in Boston, facing Pete Schourek. Keisler's contract was
purchased from Triple-A Columbus on Tuesday. Keisler will take
David Cone's scheduled start in the rotation. Cone, meanwhile, said
he was feeling much less pain than he expected after separating his
left shoulder diving for a popped-up bunt on Tuesday. ... With a
makeup game against the Red Sox scheduled for Monday at Yankee
Stadium, the Yankees are scheduled to play on 31 consecutive days
to close the season. No team in major league baseball ever has
closed the regular season with games on more than 24 consecutive
days. The Yankees could play on 32 consecutive days, if a rainout
between New York and the Florida Marlins from July 15 must be made
up on Oct. 2.
</P>
<P>
   KANSAS CITY: The Royals are conducting their evaluation meetings
of their roster, something Manager Tony Muser said is filled with
''lots of arguing and differences of opinion. In my opinion, that
can be very healthy. It makes everyone think deeper.'' Muser said
he is willing to stir things up if the meetings get too placid.
''I'll ask the tough questions,'' he said. ... With Brian Meadows'
3-2 complete-game victory on Wednesday, Royals starters now have
pitched five complete games in their last 19, after only completing
three of their first 120 starts.
Rangers-White Sox:
</P>
<P>
   TEXAS: The Hall of Fame was on the phone Thursday morning,
asking for Scott Sheldon's jersey. Sheldon became only the third
player in major league history to play all nine positions in one
game Wednesday night. The jersey will be sent this weekend, and his
cap will be displayed at The Legends of the Game Baseball Museum at
The Ballpark in Arlington. Sheldon is getting the lineup card and a
game ball. ... Though Texas manager Johnny Oates originally planned
to have Sheldon play nine at home, he doesn't regret doing it on
the road. In fact, it probably worked out better because Sheldon's
parents, who live in Croatia, were in Chicago for this series.
''His parents, his wife and his son, they probably care more than
all the other people together,'' Oates said. ''Those are the people
that really matter. I don't have any regrets.'' ... With RHP Rick
Helling struggling, Oates has decided to give him some extra rest.
Helling had his shortest start of his career Wednesday night,
giving up seven runs in just two-thirds of an inning. ''We'll just
give him an extra day the next two starts and then see where we are
after that,'' Oates said.
</P>
<P>
   CHICAGO: With a big series against Cleveland looming this
weekend, Frank Thomas loosened the young White Sox up Wednesday
night with a two-run homer in the first inning. ''He was pretty
fired up after the home run,'' White Sox manager Jerry Manuel said.
''Frank is kind of sensing what's going on. He realizes this is big
not only for the team, but for him as well. It's a different Frank
than in year's past. He's put up great numbers (in the past). This
is great numbers and winning.'' ... This is the last time the
Rangers play the White Sox this season, so Oates made sure he
talked with Manuel before Thursday's game. ''I just congratulated
him on the year and told him to enjoy the journey,'' Oates said.
''You're not going to have this year every year.'' ... Manuel was
looking for another good outing from LHP Jim Parque, who won for
the first time since Aug. 16 on Saturday, his last start. ''We have
confidence in who we put out there. We just don't know what we're
going to get,'' Manuel said. ''If he comes up with a good outing,
we'll feel pretty good about our rotation the rest of the year.''
NATIONAL LEAGUE:
Expos-Cardinals:
</P>
<P>
   MONTREAL: Trey Moore starts Friday for the Expos as they begin a
three-game series at Atlanta. The Expos are 4-2 against the NL
West-leading Braves. ... The Expos have had 48 pitchers, tying a
franchise record set in 1993. They've used 26 pitchers, two more
than the old record set in 1990. ... Wilton Guerrero struck out all
four at-bats Thursday. ... 2B Jose Vidro will have an MRI Friday
for a sprained left elbow. ''I had a tough time swinging the bat,
so I decided not to take a chance,'' Vidro said.
</P>
<P>
   ST. LOUIS: The Cardinals are 31-25 without Mark McGwire, who has
been on the DL since July 7 with tendinitis in his right knee.
McGwire had hoped to make a pinch-hit appearance during the
just-completed seven-game homestand but is experiencing pain
breaking out of the batter's box. ''He works out hard, he gets
really sore,'' manager Tony La Russa said. ''He was really sore
today. That's why he made the comment that he didn't know if he was
going to be able to play the field.'' ... SS Edgar Renteria's
fielding error in the ninth inning Wednesday was the Cardinals'
first in 88 innings. ... Rookie Rick Ankiel, who starts Friday at
Milwaukee, has won only two of his last 13 starts. But the
Cardinals have won his last six outings. ... Darryl Kile's
10-strikeout performance was his first time in double digits since
July 2, when he also fanned 10. ... Kile gets the lowest support
among Cardinals starters, 4.7 runs per game. Pat Hentgen gets the
best support at 6.2 runs. ... The actual attendance of 23,094 was
the smallest crowd of the year.
Marlins-Astros:
</P>
<P>
   FLORIDA: Marlins manager John Boles missed his second straight
game as he has gone to Chicago to be with his ailing father. Team
officials said they didn't expect him back before the weekend.
Third base coach Fredi Gonzalez will manage the team in Boles'
absence.
</P>
<P>
   HOUSTON: Moises Alou was held out of the lineup Thursday to give
him a rest. Alou, who is second in the National League in hitting
at .359, might end up needing the plate appearances at the end of
the season if he is to compete for the batting title. Players must
have 502 appearances and with 23 games left Alou has 438. ''I was
tired,'' Alou said. ''That (the batting title) isn't something I'm
worried about.''
Diamondbacks-Braves:
</P>
<P>
   ARIZONA: The Diamondbacks have lost four of their last five
series after dropping the first two games in Atlanta. ... After
making only four errors in a 16-game stretch from Aug. 15-Sept. 2,
Arizona had six errors in the last three games. ... The
pinch-hitters have picked it up against after an 0-for-19 slump.
They came into Thursday's game riding a 7-of-21 hot streak, even
though they were hitless in their first three at-bats against the
Braves.
</P>
<P>
   ATLANTA: Reliever Kerry Ligtenberg received his degree in
chemical engineering from the University of Minnesota. He had been
one credit short but a change from quarters to semesters resulted
in his complying with the degree requirements at age 29. ''It took
me a while, but I'm happy and glad I finally got it,'' Ligtenberg
said. ''It's kind of a relief.'' He has no plans to change his
career path but added, ''Now I can say I went to college and got a
degree instead of saying I was one class short of a degree.'' ...
Outfielder B.J. Surhoff left the game in the first inning with a
pulled right quadriceps muscle. He was injured as he rounded first
following a single up the middle. Surhoff remained at the bag for
one pitch, then was replaced by George Lombard.
Padres-Giants:
</P>
<P>
   SAN DIEGO: OF Tony Gwynn acknowledged the possibility this could
be his last season. The Padres have until Nov. 1 to pick up Gwynn's
$6 million contract for 2001 or give him a $2 million buyout. ''It
might be a moot point,'' said Gwynn. ''I might have to retire. If I
don't get healthy, I can't play.'' Gwynn hasn't played since June
23. He wanted to come back from knee surgery this season, but that
appears unlikely. ''I can still swing, but how do I move?'' he
asked. ... 3B Phil Nevin, who left Wednesday's game with a strained
abdominal muscle, is doubtful for the series in San Francisco.
''It's going to be a little while,'' said Nevin.
</P>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO: Giants manager Dusty Baker is worried about the
Padres. They're only four games under .500 and are on a three-game
winning streak entering play on Thursday. ''It's always dangerous
when you're facing guys you don't know much about,'' said Baker.
''Any team which gets a well-pitched game can beat you, and they've
played us tough so far.'' Another reason Baker is worried is that
Thursday starts a span of seven games in the next 11 days against
San Diego. ''That's a third of the season left against one team,''
said Baker. ... Baker said he's going to try to give 2B Jeff Kent,
OF Barry Bonds and OF Ellis Burks a day off during the series.
''That has nothing to do with the opponent,'' said Baker. ''It has
to do with playing 20 consecutive days. That's a lot. We're trying
to keep everybody fresh and healthy and keep the bench sharp.'' ...
RHP Livan Hernandez will be going for his 12th home victory of the
season on Friday. Mike Krukow, currently a Giants broadcaster, was
the last San Francisco (1986) to win 12 games at home.

<HEADLINE> State takes man to court for feeding deer  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   OLD FORGE, N.Y. (AP) - Andy Bozek is in trouble with the law for
the second time since he turned 80.
</P>
<P>
   His crime? Feeding the deer.
</P>
<P>
   Bozek is 82. He and his wife Agnes live at the end of a dead end
road in Herkimer County, about 75 miles northeast of Syracuse. For
the past 45 years, feeding the deer has been a family joy.
</P>
<P>
   The state Department of Environmental Conservation, though, sees
deer feeding as a hazard to motorists and to deer who become too
reliant on humans for survival.
</P>
<P>
   So, Bozek has been ticketed twice for feeding deer within 300
feet of a highway or public road.
</P>
<P>
   At his first court hearing Thursday, supporters held signs like
''Andy loves the deer and we love Andy,'' and ''DEC, please use
some common sense.''
</P>
<P>
   ''I could see if he was living on a main highway,'' said Stella
Lopata. ''(Feeding deer) is a lot better life than sitting in a bar
room.''
</P>
<P>
   Bozek's lawyer says the 1997 law is meant to keep busy roads
safe from deer-car collisions, not rural dead-ends like Bozek's.
Bozek pleaded innocent Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm a bit nervous,'' Bozek said. ''I'm confident it will work
out in the end.''

<HEADLINE> Ex-Ball State Player Heads To Prison  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   MUNCIE, Ind. (AP) -- A former Ball State basketball player was
sentenced Thursday to 1&AMP;frac12; years in prison after having pleaded
guilty to drug charges earlier this year.
</P>
<P>
   Jerome Davis, 22, was arrested last September after he sold 2
pounds of marijuana to a police informant. The informant was
wearing a hidden recording device when he went to Davis' apartment
and paid him $1,800 in marked bills.
</P>
<P>
   Davis, of Cleveland, was dismissed from the basketball team the
day of his arrest. He pleaded guilty in July to possession of
marijuana and maintaining a common nuisance, both felonies carrying
standard 1&AMP;frac12;-year prison terms.
</P>
<P>
   In court Thursday, Davis asked for a suspended sentence so he
could continue his studies -- and his collegiate basketball career --
at Slippery Rock University in Pennsylvania.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm no longer a boy,'' Davis told Delaware Circuit Judge
Steven Caldemeyer. ''I'm a man now. My life is headed in the right
direction.''
</P>
<P>
   According to court documents, police learned Davis was selling
marijuana after he was robbed in May 1999. Officers at that time
warned Davis, but did not arrest him.
</P>
<P>
   Caldemeyer said he found it ''particularly disturbing'' that
Davis ignored that warning and continued to sell the drug.

<HEADLINE> Nigerian Runner Killed in Accident  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   SYDNEY, Australia (AP) -- A Nigerian runner was killed when
struck by a car Thursday night in western Sydney, according to
broadcast reports.
</P>
<P>
   New South Wales police refused Friday to release the identity of
the man until relatives had been informed.
</P>
<P>
   But the Australian Broadcasting Corp. and Channel Seven
identified the man as Hyginus Anugo, 22, a 400-meter runner whom
the broadcast outlets identified as a reserve relay runner for
Nigeria.
</P>
<P>
   John Coates, president of the Australian Olympic Committee, said
Anugo did not have Olympic accreditation and was not staying at the
Olympic athletes' village.
</P>
<P>
   International Olympic Committee president Juan Antonio Samaranch
sent a condolence note Friday to the Nigerian team, and New South
Wales Premier Bob Carr said his thoughts were with the man's
teammates.
</P>
<P>
   ''We grieve with them as they do about the death of someone
drawn to Sydney by this huge event, the Olympics,'' Carr said. ''We
think of all the time that he put in his training and all that he
may have expected to achieve in Sydney.''
</P>
<P>
   Channel Seven said he was killed while running to catch a bus,
but the Japanese news agency Kyodo reported Anugo was killed while
crossing a road back to his room at a Bible college in western
Sydney.
</P>
<P>
   Anugo was considered a promising young 200- and 400-meter runner
and had participated in the World Junior Championships in 1996 in
Sydney.
</P>
<P>
   ''He was a very quiet person, an easy-going person,'' Nigerian
coach Brown Ebewele told Kyodo. ''When the news got to us,
everybody was shocked.''
</P>
<P>
   Sydney Olympics spokesman Milton Cockburn said officials had
been in contact with Nigeria since the accident, but declined to
provide any more information.

<HEADLINE> Senate OKs Pipeline Safety Bill  </HEADLINE>
By JOHN HUGHES
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Senate approved a bill Thursday to improve
pipeline safety by increasing fines, boosting state oversight and
requiring pipeline operators to disclose more information about the
pipes.
</P>
<P>
   The bill by Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., also increases funding
for the federal agency that oversees pipelines and gives
whistleblower protections to pipeline workers who reveal safety
problems.
</P>
<P>
   ''People in communities through which pipelines go (will) know
what is going on and have some say,'' said Sen. Slade Gorton,
R-Wash., a bill co-author.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Patty Murray, D-Wash., another co-author, said ''there is
no doubt'' an Aug. 19 natural gas pipeline explosion in Carlsbad,
N.M. -- which left 12 dead -- created momentum to pass the bill this
year.
</P>
<P>
   The bill, which was approved by unanimous consent, would require
pipeline operators for the first time to submit detailed plans to
the federal Office of Pipeline Safety showing that the operators
had conducted tests and inspections and taken other steps to make
the lines safe.
</P>
<P>
   The operators also would be required to show the Transportation
Department agency that they have trained employees operating the
pipes. Fines for safety violators would be increased from $500,000
to $1 million, and federal funding for the Office of Pipeline
Safety would increase by $13 million annually by 2002.
</P>
<P>
   Murray, Gorton and McCain have been pushing to pass tougher
pipeline safety legislation after a Bellingham, Wash., gasoline
pipeline rupture and explosion last year left three people dead.
</P>
<P>
   The Senate Commerce, Science and Transportation Committee
approved McCain's bill in June, but the measure stalled for weeks,
largely due to criticisms of the bill by the natural gas industry,
Murray said.
</P>
<P>
   She said industry officials realized they had a public relations
problem following the New Mexico disaster and relented on some of
their concerns.
</P>
<P>
   But an industry official said the accident did not play a role.
</P>
<P>
   Gay Friedmann, senior vice president of legislative affairs for
the Interstate Natural Gas Association of America, said it took
time for all the parties involved in talks over the bill to reach
an agreement.
</P>
<P>
   ''We think it's a tough bill,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Critics said penalties in the bill are still too weak and that
the Office of Pipeline Safety -- with a poor track record -- should
not be left to enforce the penalties.
</P>
<P>
   ''Congress is just about business as usual,'' said Anne Bricklin
of Fuel Safe Washington in Seattle. ''They're basically going to
try to trick the public into thinking pipeline safety is going on --
we're not going to let them get away with it.''
</P>
<P>
   Several House pipeline safety bills have been introduced, but
House Transportation and Infrastructure Committee Chairman Bud
Shuster, R-Pa., is crafting a new bill similar to McCain's version
that a Transportation subcommittee is expected to take up as early
as next week.
</P>
<P>
   Bill sponsors say there is still time to gain final passage of a
pipeline bill this year.
</P>
<P>
   ----
</P>
<P>
   On the Net: Congressional Web site http://thomas.loc.gov/
</P>
<P>
   The bill is S. 2438.

<HEADLINE> Feuding Eminem, 'N Sync fight it out at MTV Video Awards  </HEADLINE>
By DAVID BAUDER
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) - A mooning, profane jokes that tested the
censor's trigger finger and a winner who admitted she hated making
videos - MTV's annual Video Music Awards lived up to a reputation
for unpredictability Thursday night.
</P>
<P>
   Along the way, profane rapper Eminem - the subject of a pre-show
protest over his violent lyrics - won best male video for ''The
Real Slim Shady.'' He was nominated for six awards overall.
</P>
<P>
   Eminem performed the song marching in off the street with an
army of lookalikes, frequently grabbing his crotch. He rapped a
second song he said was addressed to his critics, saying, ''I am
whatever you say I am.''
</P>
<P>
   The teen band Eminem has ridiculed, 'N Sync, won best pop video
for the marionette clip, ''Bye Bye Bye.'' 'N Sync had also been
nominated for six awards.
</P>
<P>
   Slinky soul star Aaliyah won two awards, including best female
video, for ''Try Again.''
</P>
<P>
   Hosts Shawn and Marlon Wayans had profanities bleeped out in an
opening monologue that also featured a mooning, and the evening's
first award presenter, Aerosmith's Steven Tyler, had a lewd joke
about an MTV personality partly censored.
</P>
<P>
   It was typical for the annual awards ceremony, where making a
dramatic impression is more important than taking home an award.
</P>
<P>
   One of the best jokes was unspoken: Napster founder Shawn
Fanning appearing on stage in a Metallica t-shirt. The heavy metal
band is leading the fight to stop Fanning's Internet song-sharing
service.
</P>
<P>
   ''Nice shirt,'' said MTV's Carson Daly. Metallica's Lars Ulrich,
sitting in the audience, feigned sleep.
</P>
<P>
   Macy Gray won best new artist in a video for her breakout hit,
''I Try,'' which showed her carrying a flower and chasing after a
lover. ''I hate making videos,'' she said when picking up her
trophy.
</P>
<P>
   Eminem's ''The Real Slim Shady'' and 'N Sync's ''Bye Bye Bye''
were nominated for video of the year, along with D'Angelo's steamy
''Untitled (How Does it Feel),'' Blink 182's ''All the Small
Things'' and Red Hot Chili Pepper's ''Californication.''
</P>
<P>
   With MTV airing fewer videos, the annual Video Music Awards is
less about artistry in the form and more about celebrating the pop
culture stars of the moment. Fueled by the teen pop explosion, last
year's show was the top-rated entertainment program in cable
television history.
</P>
<P>
   Throngs of fans crowded the streets around Radio City Music
Hall. They watched the entrances of celebrities like ''Survivor''
winner Richard Hatch. He was dressed in a black suit, not taking
the chance of walking around naked like he did on Pulau Tiga.
</P>
<P>
   ''Is this weird or what?'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Security was tight, particularly after taping for after another
music awards show - the Source Hip-Hop Music Awards - was halted by
a melee in California last month.
</P>
<P>
   Before the show, members of the Gay and Lesbian Alliance Against
Defamation protested against MTV, angry at the network's support of
Eminem. They say his lyrics promote violence against homosexuals
and women.
</P>
<P>
   GLAAD said it asked MTV not to let Eminem perform at the Video
Music Awards, but was refused. MTV's agreement to run a
public-service advertisement discouraging violence against gays is
''a very small consolation,'' said GLAAD's Scott Seomin.
</P>
<P>
   MTV, in a statement, said Eminem's ''homophobic and misogynistic
lyrics'' have never appeared on the network.
</P>
<P>
   ''While many people find his lyrics offensive or irresponsible,
including many of us at MTV, he's obviously struck a chord with our
audience,'' MTV said. ''We think the most honest and effective
thing to do is offer a forum for all of these viewpoints on our
network.''

<HEADLINE> APBNews sold to safety consulting site  </HEADLINE>
By SETH SUTEL
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) - SafetyTips.com, a safety issues Web site, agreed
Thursday to buy the struggling crime news provider APBNews.com for
$575,000, far less than the company had offered to pay just two
weeks ago.
</P>
<P>
   Yovette Mumford, chief executive of SafetyTips.com, said she
plans to keep APBNews operating as a separate site. The material
will remain mainly the same, with some additional content on safety
issues in the construction industry and environmental issues.
</P>
<P>
   SafetyTips also plans to use content from APBNews in its own
site and in safety consulting materials it sells to its own
clients, which include companies and municipal governments.
</P>
<P>
   On Aug. 24 SafetyTips had offered to pay $950,000 for APBNews,
but the company withdrew the offer shortly thereafter. Mumford said
SafetyTips had been rushed by court deadlines at the time and
hadn't completed its review of APBNews' assets.
</P>
<P>
   The deal, reached at a bankruptcy court in New York, came just
hours after a mysterious bidder withdrew a higher offer, leaving
SafetyTips as the only bidder for APBNews's assets.
</P>
<P>
   Mark Sauter, chief executive for APBNews, called the sale a
''bittersweet'' moment for the site's staff and said he regretted
not being able to secure a higher price for the company, which
investors had valued as high as $104 million last summer.
</P>
<P>
   ''I never realized how dramatic bankruptcy court could be,''
Sauter said. ''It's been quite a ride - in the wrong direction.''
</P>
<P>
   APBNews fell on hard times this spring when it failed to close
its third round of financing. The company fired nearly all its
staff in early June and declared bankruptcy a month later, having
burned through $27 million in cash and leaving behind $8 million in
debt.

<HEADLINE> Philippine Hostage Release Delayed  </HEADLINE>
By JIM GOMEZ
<TEXT>
<P>
   ZAMBOANGA, Philippines (AP) -- Negotiators delayed their
departure Friday for a southern Philippine island after new snags
threatened to stop Muslim rebels from releasing all six Europeans
they are still holding.
</P>
<P>
   They blamed the delay on plane problems. Earlier, however, an
official close to the negotiating team said Libyan officials had
brought only $4 million in ransom money, or enough to pay for the
release of only four of the hostages.
</P>
<P>
   The Abu Sayyaf rebels had earlier pledged to free all six on
Friday.
</P>
<P>
   But they failed to telephone the negotiators as expected
Thursday to confirm the release, the official said.
</P>
<P>
   Libya has played a prominent role in negotiations for 21 people
kidnapped April 23 from Malaysia's Sipadan diving resort. Last week
it paid $6 million for the release of six other Westerners from the
group, negotiators said. It insists the money will go for
development projects, not directly to the rebels.
</P>
<P>
   But Libya has resisted paying for two of the remaining hostages,
both French television journalists seized while covering the
hostage crisis, saying their company should foot the bill.
</P>
<P>
   Negotiators said they would still travel Friday to Jolo island
in hopes the European hostages would be released. Ambassadors from
the hostages' countries were scheduled to fly to the southern port
city of Zamboanga to receive the captives from negotiators.
</P>
<P>
   The rebels are still holding two Finns, a French and a German
from Sipadan and the two journalists in their camp on Jolo island,
as well as 12 Filipino Christian evangelists who were captured in
early July. A Filipino hostage from Sipadan was taken to the camp
of another rebel faction.
</P>
<P>
   A separate faction also is holding an American man, Jeffrey
Schilling, kidnapped early last week.
</P>
<P>
   The government negotiator working for Schilling's release said
emissaries have contacted rebel spokesman Abu Sabaya, who belongs
to that faction, but negotiations had not yet begun. ''As of this
moment, Abu Sabaya's group keeps on moving for security reasons,''
provincial Vice Governor Munib Estino said.
</P>
<P>
   The rebels have not announced their demands for Schilling's
release, although Sabaya has privately demanded $10 million,
negotiators said.
</P>
<P>
   Schilling, 24, a Muslim convert from Oakland, California, was
seized Aug. 28 when he visited an Abu Sayyaf camp with his Filipino
Muslim wife, Ivi Osani.
</P>
<P>
   Presidential Press Secretary Ricardo Puno said Schilling appears
to be in good condition, despite earlier reports he was ill. ''He's
not undergoing rough treatment. He's OK,'' Puno said.
</P>
<P>
   Philippine officials have questioned whether the case is a
simple kidnapping since Osani is Sabaya's second cousin and the
widow of a rebel killed by government forces. Osani was not
abducted and is being held in protective custody in a military
hospital.
</P>
<P>
   ''It could either be pure love or there could be a lot of
intrigue in the background,'' Puno said. ''At this time we cannot
say with any finality what her role was. But it certainly was not a
passive one since she made arrangements for him to go to the
camp.''

<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Al Gore continues to show strength on issues like
education, health care and the economy and has opened a double-digit lead among
women, new polls suggest. But the head-to-head matchup with George W. Bush
remains close. Democrat Gore and Republican Bush were virtually tied in two new
polls released today. Gore led 47 percent to 44 percent among likely voters in a
CNN-USA Today-Gallup poll. Both candidates were tied at 47 percent in an
ABC-Washington Post poll of likely voters.

   COEUR D'ALENE, Idaho (AP) -- A jury today awarded $6.3 million to a woman and
her son who were attacked by Aryan Nations guards outside the white supremacist
group's north Idaho headquarters. The jury found that Aryan Nations leader
Richard Butler, the group and its corporate entity, Saphire, Inc., were
negligent in the selection, training and supervision of the security guards who
assaulted Victoria and Jason Keenan two years ago. The Keenans' attorney, Morris

shift some of their resources to rehabilitating the scarred landscape. Some
firefighters in western Montana are being reassigned for duties that include
planting new seed and clearing fallen timber and debris from natural drainage
canals in burned forests. Montana still had 24 large fires burning on 645,289
acres as of today. In Idaho, nearly 651,000 acres of forest and range land were
on fire. Nationwide, fires have burned more than 6.6 million acres so far this

   NEW YORK (AP) -- MTV's annual extravagant party -- the Video Music Awards --
kept the censor busy and brought feuding rappers and rockers together in a
celebration of pop music excess tonight. Hosts Shawn and Marlon Wayans had
profanities bleeped out in an opening monologue that also featured a mooning,
and the evening's first award presenter, Aerosmith's Steven Tyler, had a lewd
joke about an MTV personality partly censored. Eminem led the way with six
nominations, as did the teen favorites he's often ridiculed, 'N Sync. The
foul-mouthed rapper, the subject of a pre-show protest over his violent lyrics,
has also feuded with Christina Aguilera and Britney Spears.

<HEADLINE> Gore Gains Teamsters' Endorsement  </HEADLINE>
By SANDRA SOBIERAJ
<TEXT>
<P>
   CARBONDALE, Pa. (AP) -- Al Gore won, at long last, endorsement by
the 1.4 million Teamsters union Thursday after nearly a year of
courtship and delay.
</P>
<P>
   The union has been especially impressed by Gore's ''populist
message'' since the Democratic convention, spokesman Bret Caldwell
said. The Republicans said the endorsement was no surprise and its
impact was diminished by the lateness.
</P>
<P>
   Gore also got a Pennsylvania present from Scranton's Republican
mayor, Jim Connors, who met the vice president outside a restaurant
and announced he was joining the Democratic Party and endorsing
Gore. The mayor also gave Gore a key to the city.
</P>
<P>
   Gore later told reporters he'd felt a lift in the past week.
''I'm having fun ... there's been a real surge of energy.''
</P>
<P>
   The Democratic vice president heard the news on the Teamsters
just as he wrapped up a campaign stop promoting his goal of
creating 10 million high-tech jobs through business tax incentives.
That was at the Scranton-area Gentex, manufacturer of protective
suits for firefighting and chemical warfare.
</P>
<P>
   The Teamsters' 24-member executive board voted unanimously by
phone to give Gore the endorsement and the millions of dollars in
voter mobilization that come with it.
</P>
<P>
   Gore, who knew the news was coming, said, ''I'm very excited
about these reports. ... I have heard from lots and lots of
rank-and-file members that they want the agenda I've been talking
about.''
</P>
<P>
   Teamsters President James Hoffa Jr. said he called Gore with
word of the endorsement.
</P>
<P>
   ''I said 'I have some good news for you' and he says, 'Well,
it's good to hear good news .... we need the Teamsters on our
side,'' he told reporters after a rally for Senate candidate
Hillary Rodham Clinton in Lake Success, N.Y., on Long Island.
</P>
<P>
   The board's vote came after an internal poll of Teamsters
leadership nationwide found 90 percent support for Gore, a union
official said. The remaining 10 percent split among Republican
George W. Bush, Reform Party candidate Pat Buchanan and the Green
Party's Ralph Nader.
</P>
<P>
   The endorsement is to be formally announced next week, with Gore
expected to schedule a campaign stop specially to thank the union.
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday, Gore, in blue jeans, told Gentex workers that his
was a fight for the middle class. He drilled into Bush's agenda,
reinforcing the full-page ad that his campaign placed in Thursday's
New York Times to ask ''Does it matter if the numbers all add up?''
</P>
<P>
   Gore argued that tax cuts pushed by Bush would eat up the entire
budget surplus and force the Republican to pay for other campaign
promises through deficit spending. Moreover, Gore said, Bush's
proposal to privatize a portion of Social Security, a plan he has
yet to detail, would leave a ''trillion-dollar hole'' in the
retirement program's trust fund.
</P>
<P>
   Bush spokesman Dan Bartlett, at the Texas governor's Austin
campaign headquarters, faulted the detailed budget that Gore
released on Wednesday for not putting price tags on some 50 of his
own campaign promises.
</P>
<P>
   ''If we can't trust Al Gore to give all the details of his own
budget, how can we expect him to tell the truth about Governor
Bush's budget,'' Bartlett said.
</P>
<P>
   Listening at Gore's loading-dock rally, worker Barry Craven said
the dickering over numbers ''went in one ear and out the other.''
</P>
<P>
   From Pennsylvania, Gore continued on to New Orleans for an
evening rally in the French Quarter with his wife, Tipper, where an
adoring mob of 10,000 waited in the rain at Chartres Street. Tipper
Gore took the stage after the band, Better than Ezra, and said:
''I've got a man here who knows how to let the good times roll for
the whole nation.''
</P>
<P>
   It has been 11 months since the Teamsters, angry over Gore's
free-trade views and joined by the United Auto Workers, broke ranks
with the AFL-CIO and refused Gore an early endorsement. Union
leaders were further peeved when Gore, in mid-June, installed as
campaign chairman former Commerce Secretary William Daley, the
administration's point man in the trade fight against labor.
</P>
<P>
   Hoffa had long threatened the possibility of endorsing Bush or
just sitting out the election.
</P>
<P>
   However, Bartlett, the Bush spokesman, dismissed the endorsement
as a fait accompli and said its importance was diminished by the
long delay.
</P>
<P>
   ''This will not deter us one bit in pushing our case to
rank-and-file working families,'' said Bartlett.
</P>
<P>
   The autoworkers formally backed Gore last month.
</P>
<P>
   The endorsement decided, the Teamsters now add their efforts to
the more than $40 million that the AFL-CIO and individual unions
are pouring into voter education and get-out-the-vote activities
designed to aid Gore. In all, the Teamsters political action teams
are to spend $9 million on Gore's and other races.
</P>
<P>
   As part of the union drive, Bartlett said the Bush camp expected
labor leaders to act as ''attack surrogates for the Al Gore
campaign to distort Governor Bush's record.''
</P>
<P>
   ''We will vigorously set the record straight,'' Bartlett said.

<HEADLINE> Colombian Drug Smugglers Built Sub  </HEADLINE>
By ANDREW SELSKY
<TEXT>
<P>
   FACATATIVA, Colombia (AP) -- In a scheme worthy of Jules Verne
that awed even veteran naval officers, Colombian drug traffickers
were building a sophisticated submarine to smuggle cocaine,
reportedly with help from American and Russian criminals.
</P>
<P>
   Police stumbled upon the half-built submarine Wednesday night in
a warehouse outside the capital, Bogota -- 7,500 feet up in the
Andes mountains and 210 miles from any port.
</P>
<P>
   Even by smugglers' innovation standards, this was off the charts
-- Verne could have called it ''20,000 Kilos Under the Sea.''
</P>
<P>
   The 100-foot submarine could have crossed an ocean, surfaced off
Miami or other coastal cities and surreptitiously unloaded its drug
cargo.
</P>
<P>
   ''In the 30 some-odd years I have been in law enforcement I have
never seen anything like this,'' Leo Arreguin, the chief of the
U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration in Colombia, said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is huge,'' Arreguin said. ''We're talking about being
able to load up to 200 tons of cocaine in this submarine.''
However, other officials put the cargo capacity much lower, but
they also it could carry at least several tons.
</P>
<P>
   Top officials flocked to the warehouse Thursday to marvel at the
lengths that Colombian drug traffickers, who supply more than 80
percent of the world's cocaine and a rising share of its heroin, go
to export their illicit products.
</P>
<P>
   Police were led to the find by suspicious area residents, who
had seen Americans hanging around the warehouse, located in a cow
pasture off a highway near the suburb of Facatativa.
</P>
<P>
   When police arrived, there was no one around. Surveillance
cameras had been placed on the roof. No arrests have been made.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is very high tech,'' said Colombian Navy Capt. Ismael
Idrobo, gazing up at the reddish sub, which stood in three sections
on lengths of railroad track. ''Look at the rudders and the
pressurized double hull. This could easily travel 100 meters
(yards) under the surface of the ocean.''
</P>
<P>
   Navy Capt. Fidel Azula, a former submarine captain and member of
the Joint Chiefs of Staff, said even the Colombian navy lacked the
knowledge to build such a vessel. ''This is unmistakably of superb
naval construction,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Arreguin said seized documents, including blueprints, contained
Russian- and American-sounding names. There were indications
Russian engineers were involved, including ''a very professional
engineer who has constructed submarines before,'' Arreguin said.
</P>
<P>
   The Russian Mafia has become increasingly involved in cocaine
trafficking to Europe, Arreguin noted.
</P>
<P>
   Scattered about the warehouse were welding tools, propane tanks,
hardhats, tool boxes and knee pads, and a Grainger Tools catalogue
from the United States. A no-smoking sign and calendars featuring
bikini-clad models hung on the walls.
</P>
<P>
   Previously, smugglers have outfitted passenger planes and ships
to transport drugs, and even built some tiny fiberglass
''submersibles'' to ferry drugs to a mother ship. But they were
mere contraptions compared to this sub, which measured over 11 feet
in diameter.
</P>
<P>
   Years ago, Colombians drug traffickers reportedly tried to buy,
through intermediaries, a military submarine from the Kremlin's
fleet as the Soviet Union collapsed.
</P>
<P>
   Theorizing why this sub was being built so far from the ocean,
National Police Director Gen. Ernesto Gilibert said it was to
conceal the operation and for easy access to high-grade
construction materials.
</P>
<P>
   Officials believe the traffickers would have transported the sub
in three sections to the coast aboard tractor-trailers.

<HEADLINE> Angels 6, Tigers 4  </HEADLINE>
By LARRY LAGE
<TEXT>
<P>
   DETROIT (AP) -- Troy Glaus, Scott Spiezio and Tim Salmon homered
and Tim Belcher won the matchup of pitchers coming off the disabled
list as the Anaheim Angels beat the Detroit Tigers 6-4 Thursday
night.
</P>
<P>
   Belcher (3-2), who entered the game with a 9.69 ERA, made his
first start since July 2. He had been sidelined by a strained right
flexor muscle.
</P>
<P>
   Belcher, who pitched for the Tigers in 1994, went six innings
and gave up three runs on seven hits.
</P>
<P>
   Dave Mlicki (4-11) gave up five runs on five hits in just three
innings. Out because of a sinus infection, he made his first start
since July 22.
</P>
<P>
   Shigetoshi Hasegawa pitched the ninth for his ninth save.
</P>
<P>
   Bengie Molina went 4-for-4 as the Angels concluded their
seven-game road trip with two wins. The Tigers lost consecutive
games for the first time since Aug. 6-7.
</P>
<P>
   Glaus gave Anaheim a 1-0 lead in the second with his 41st homer,
a 422-foot drive to left field.
</P>
<P>
   The Tigers tied it in the home half on Damion Easley's RBI
single after Tony Clark doubled and Deivi Cruz singled.
</P>
<P>
   The Angels went ahead 2-1 in the third when Darin Erstad's
sacrifice fly scored Molina, who hit a leadoff double. They took a
3-1 lead on Scott Spiezio's 15th homer to right field.
</P>
<P>
   Willie Blair relieved Mlicki, who loaded the bases with no outs
in the fourth. Blair forced Adam Kennedy into a home-to-first
double play.
</P>
<P>
   Molina, the second batter Mlicki faced, hit a two-run single to
right.
</P>
<P>
   Detroit cut its deficit to 5-3 in the fifth. Brad Ausmus hit a
leadoff single and scored from first when Wendell Magee hit a
double to left-center. Billy McMillon's sacrifice fly scored Magee.
</P>
<P>
   Magee hit his sixth homer to make it 5-4 in the seventh. Salmon
gave the Angels a 6-4 cushion in the eighth with his 33rd home run.
Notes: The Angels hadn't homered in their past three games. ... Mo
Vaughn was 2-for-16 with nine strikeouts in the series. ... Glaus
committed his 28th error when he dropped McMillon's foul popup in
the eighth.

<HEADLINE> Raiders' NFL Claim Goes Forward  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES (AP) -- A Superior Court judge has issued a ruling
allowing three claims by the Oakland Raiders against the NFL to go
forward, including the team's contention the league owes it money
for losing ''the Los Angeles market.''
</P>
<P>
   However, Los Angeles County Superior Court Judge Richard Hubbell
also dismissed portions of the Raiders' contention that they still
owns the Los Angeles market.
</P>
<P>
   A trial date on the team's lawsuit had been scheduled for the
summer but has since been postponed. A new date could be scheduled
at a Sept. 19 hearing.
</P>
<P>
   In the meantime, both the league and the Raiders hailed
Hubbell's ruling as a victory.
</P>
<P>
   ''The judge threw out most of the claims, and cut the heart out
of what was left,'' said Doug Adler, an attorney representing the
NFL.
</P>
<P>
   The team issued a statement saying, in part: ''The court ruled
that the Raiders presented sufficient evidence to show that the NFL
acted in bad faith and with unfair dealing to the Raiders in
destroying the Raiders' opportunity to build a new facility at
Hollywood Park and drive the Raiders from the Los Angeles market,
and breached their fiduciary duty to the Raiders.''
</P>
<P>
   The Raiders claim their win in a previous anti-trust case
against the NFL gave them ownership to the Los Angeles market.
</P>
<P>
   But in the ruling issued Friday, Hubbell found the anti-trust
case stated the opposite, that the ''NFL as a whole owned the right
to expand into the Los Angeles area,'' and ''the Los Angeles
opportunity represented an extremely valuable expansion possibility
for the league.''
</P>
<P>
   According to the ruling, the Raiders can only win by showing the
NFL constitution, bylaws and past practices prove the team is
entitled to a cash payment.
</P>
<P>
   Hubbell also dismissed the Raiders' claims that the NFL
interfered with the team's deal to move to a new stadium near the
Hollywood Park racetrack in nearby Inglewood, finding that the
league also had a financial interest in such a deal.
</P>
<P>
   When that deal fell through in June 1995, Raiders officials
negotiated the team's return to Oakland.

<P>
   TORONTO (AP) -- Freddy Garcia allowed two singles in eight
scoreless innings as Seattle defeated the Toronto Blue Jays 8-1
Thursday night, only the Mariners' seventh win in 24 games.
</P>
<P>
   Mark McLemore drove in three runs and Al Martin homered for the
AL West leaders.
</P>
<P>
   Garcia (6-4) struck out six and worked around six walks.
</P>
<P>
   The 23-year-old right-hander didn't allow a hit until Darrin
Fletcher led off the fifth a single. After Jose Cruz grounded into
a double play, Mickey Morandini singled for Toronto's only other
hit.
</P>
<P>
   Tony Batista hit his 38th homer in the ninth off Mariners
reliever Jose Paniagua.
</P>
<P>
   Batista's shot gave the Blue Jays a franchise-record 222 home
runs. Toronto, which leads the majors in homers, had not connected
in its previous six games.
</P>
<P>
   Steve Trachsel (7-13) fell to 0-4 against Seattle this season.
</P>
<P>
   Trachsel, acquired from Tampa Bay on July 31, allowed four runs
on nine hits in seven innings.
</P>
<P>
   Seattle took a 3-0 lead in the fifth on McLemore's two-run
double and Rickey Henderson's RBI double.
</P>
<P>
   Al Martin homered in the eighth and the Mariners added four runs
off Billy Koch in the ninth. Edgar Martinez hit a two-run double,
McLemore had an RBI single and Alex Rodriguez drove in a run with a
grounder.
</P>
<P>
Notes: Attendance was just 17,571. ... Canadian reliever Paul
Quantrill made his 300th appearance for the Blue Jays. ...
Henderson led off two of his previous three games against Trachsel
with a homer. Henderson singled in his first at-bat Friday night.
... Martin, acquired from San Diego in midseason, has three home
runs in the AL this year.

   ATLANTA (AP) -- Greg Maddux pitched a four-hitter and helped out
at the plate with a two-run double as the Atlanta Braves completed
a three-game sweep of the Arizona Diamondbacks with a 4-0 victory
Thursday night.
</P>
<P>
   Maddux (16-8) was perfect through 4 2-3 innings. He struck out
six and didn't walk anyone in pitching his fifth complete game and
second shutout of the year.
</P>
<P>
   Maddux gave up five first-inning runs in each of his last two
starts. This time, he needed only seven pitches to get through the
first.
</P>
<P>
   The Braves, whose sweep came after a stretch in which they lost
eight of 11 games, stretched their lead in the NL East to 2&AMP;frac12; games
over idle New York. Arizona has lost 11 of 15 and dropped 5&AMP;frac12; games
behind the Mets in the wild card chase.
</P>
<P>
   Curt Schilling (10-11) lost his fourth straight start. He was
3-0 with two shutouts in his four previous starts against Atlanta.

<HEADLINE> Buffalo Teachers Go On Strike  </HEADLINE>
By CAROLYN THOMPSON
<TEXT>
<P>
   BUFFALO, N.Y. (AP) -- Buffalo's teachers went on strike Thursday
in defiance of state law, forcing the cancellation of what would
have been the second day of school for 47,000 students.
</P>
<P>
   The walkout by the 3,800 teachers caught many people off guard.
</P>
<P>
   Parents who took their youngsters to school only to find picket
lines brought their children back home or scrambled to find someone
to watch them. YMCA and YWCA sites opened their day care centers to
non-members.
</P>
<P>
   Superintendent Marion Canedo canceled classes for Friday, saying
she had not heard anything from the union and wanted to give
parents as much time as possible to prepare for another day without
school.
</P>
<P>
   State law prohibits teachers from striking, and they stand to
lose two days pay for each day on strike. They could be jailed for
defying a court injunction obtained by the Board of Education this
week forbidding the walkout. A hearing on the injunction is set for
Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Mayor Anthony Masiello called the walkout ''an unconscionable
act.''
</P>
<P>
   ''It's very punitive and very damaging to the children and the
families and it's totally uncalled for,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ''We're all very sad. We're sad for us and sad for the
children,'' said reading teacher Sue Webster as she picketed
outside a school. ''There's not one of us that's happy to be here.
We'd all much rather be inside.''
</P>
<P>
   The union and the school system were at odds over wages, health
care and a provision to contract with social agencies outside the
district to serve troubled students. Negotiators were set to resume
Thursday evening.
</P>
<P>
   ''I am highly upset,'' said Sophia Gonzalez, 16, as she headed
home from Grover Cleveland High School. ''They said it was a new
school year and our grades were going to go up. We can't do it if
we're sitting at home.''
</P>
<P>
   Elsewhere around the country, hundreds of non-teaching employees
at the University of Texas at Austin began a three-day sickout to
protest working conditions, and a faculty strike at Eastern
Michigan University in Ypsilanti entered its third day.
</P>
<P>
   In Philadelphia, school opened for the year on time Thursday
despite a strike threat by teachers. Contract talks continued, and
both sides reported progress.
</P>
<P>
   The union representing 687 Eastern Michigan professors went on
strike Tuesday morning in the first faculty walkout at the school
since 1978. The fall semester began last week and the university
remains open, but many classes have been canceled.
</P>
<P>
   At the University of Texas, the non-teaching employees are
seeking pay raises and a rollback of increases in their insurance
premiums. A school official said the university was operating
normally despite the walkout.

<HEADLINE> Chief: Annan Hindered U.N. Program  </HEADLINE>
By GEORGE GEDDA
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan set in
motion a process in 1998 that contributed to the eventual breakdown
of the U.N. weapons inspection program, a former chief of the
program said Thursday night.
</P>
<P>
   ''Did he harm our operation? Yes,'' said Richard Butler, the
Australian who once headed the now-defunct U.N. Special Commission,
known as UNSCOM.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking to a gathering at the American Enterprise Institute,
Butler said the turning point occurred when Annan sent three envoys
to Baghdad to discuss the Security Council resolutions on Iraq that
were passed after the Persian Gulf War in 1991.
</P>
<P>
   By dispatching the envoys, Annan ''sent an unambiguous signal to
the Iraqi authorities ... that here was a way out from dealing with
us (UNSCOM),'' Butler said.
</P>
<P>
   ''Henceforth they could deal with the office of the secretary
general on a nonspecific, nontechnical political track. That was
exactly what they wanted.''
</P>
<P>
   The UNSCOM initiative officially broke down at the end of 1998
after Iraq refused further cooperation with Butler and his team. As
punishment, the United States and Britain engaged in four days of
air strikes against targets in Iraq.
</P>
<P>
   The Security Council has attempted to create a successor
inspection system but Iraq has said it will not cooperate. Butler
said the absence of U.N. monitors has enabled Iraq to revive its
weapons programs.
</P>
<P>
   Annan's injection of diplomacy into the Iraq issue ''undercut
our effort on weapons and he (Saddam Hussein) is still there and
back in business,'' Butler said.
</P>
<P>
   Butler spoke hours after Iraqi Deputy Prime Minister Tariq Aziz
said U.N. economic sanctions have created a humanitarian
catastrophe in Iraq, and said U.S. influence in the world body was
to blame.
</P>
<P>
   Aziz commented in a speech to the U.N. Millennium Summit in New
York. Iraq maintains the sanctions should be lifted because it has
dismantled all forbidden weapons.
</P>
<P>
   Butler scolded critics who say Iraq is not cooperating with U.N.
resolutions because the Clinton administration has said the
sanctions will remain in place until Saddam is removed from power,
regardless of Iraqi compliance.
</P>
<P>
   Butler acknowledged that Secretary of State Madeleine Albright
staked out such a position in 1998 but soon backtracked.
</P>
<P>
   ''Iraq has been told over and over again that that is not U.S.
policy, and for Iraq to persist with this fallacy is wrong,''
Butler said.
</P>
<P>
   ''They prefer to say that this is U.S. policy when it is not
because they actually prefer to keep their weapons of mass
destruction even if it means the sanctions would remain in place,''
he added.

<HEADLINE> Man Shoots Two To Death in Missouri  </HEADLINE>
By JIM SALTER
<TEXT>
<P>
   BUNKER, Mo. (AP) -- A man apparently upset with city workers shot
two people to death and wounded two others Thursday, the Missouri
State Highway Patrol said.
</P>
<P>
   More than 100 officers used helicopters and bloodhounds to
search for the alleged assailant, Garry Dewayne Watson, in the
remote, heavily wooded area surrounding this small south-central
Missouri community of about 300 people, about 120 miles southwest
of St. Louis. He's believed to be armed with a rifle and wearing a
camouflage shirt and blue jeans.
</P>
<P>
   One of the wounded, 51-year-old city worker Delmar Eugene Dunn,
was hospitalized in serious but stable condition. Town marshal
Steve Stoops was treated and released.
</P>
<P>
   Highway Patrol Sgt. Skip DeSalme and Bunker Mayor David Burnett
said Watson, 49, and the city had been feuding for years over an
easement on his roughly one-acre lot. Watson lives in a double-wide
mobile home on land next to a city-operated sewage lagoon.
</P>
<P>
   City workers frequently need to cross over the property through
the city-owned easement to perform work at the lagoon, Burnett
said. Watson was told Wednesday night that workers would need to
cross over the property Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   ''When they showed up, he came out of the house and started
shooting at the workers,'' DeSalme said.
</P>
<P>
   City officials were concerned enough that they sent Stoops, the
marshal, with the workers. Stoops fired back two or three times at
Watson, but didn't think he hit him, DeSalme said.
</P>
<P>
   Killed were Rocky B. Gordon, 34, a city employee, and David
Thompson, 44, a city alderman who was in charge of the lagoon.
</P>
<P>
   Finding Watson could be tough, DeSalme said. Bunker is
surrounded by the sprawling Mark Twain National Forest, and it
takes a slow drive down hilly, winding roads to get there.
</P>
<P>
   Highway patrol officers had to climb hills just to get their
cellular telephones to work.
</P>
<P>
   D.A. Nichols, a state conservation agent who works at the
forest, said ''you could go 30 or 40 miles without running into
civilization. If he knows where he's going, he could stay in the
timber for a long time.''
</P>
<P>
   It's also an area Watson is very familiar with. ''This is an
area he has lived in his whole life,'' DeSalme said. ''That's an
area he hunts.''

<HEADLINE> Mexican Deputy Minister Found Dead  </HEADLINE>
By TRACI CARL
<TEXT>
<P>
   MEXICO CITY (AP) -- A top Commerce Ministry official upset about
scandals surrounding a program he helped start was found dead along
a highway outside Mexico City, and his death was being treated as a
suicide, officials said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   The body of Deputy Minister Raul Ramos Tercero was found late
Wednesday outside his car with the neck slashed, said Eliseo Lugo,
a spokesman for the attorney general's office.
</P>
<P>
   Lugo said six letters were found inside Ramos' car, including
ones to his wife, his parents, a senator, the Reforma newspaper and
two top officials at the Commerce Ministry.
</P>
<P>
   The letters said Ramos took his life because he was upset about
the controversy surrounding Mexico's National Registry of Motor
Vehicles, or Renave, Mexican State Attorney General Gerardo Sanchez
said.
</P>
<P>
   Renave has been criticized for charging too much to register
cars and corruption.
</P>
<P>
   In a separate scandal, Renave's former director, Ricardo Miguel
Cavallo, last month was implicated in Argentina's so-called ''dirty
war'' against dissidents in the 1970s and early 1980s.
</P>
<P>
   Cavallo was arrested Aug. 24 in Mexico. He is wanted by criminal
judges in Spain, France and Italy for alleged human rights abuses
in Argentina. He allegedly later fled Argentina to Mexico.
</P>
<P>
   ''The attorney general's office is certain that this was a
suicide,'' Sanchez said.
</P>
<P>
   As deputy minister of regulations and industrial services, Ramos
oversaw the creation of Renave, a government program whose services
were later contracted out to a private company.
</P>
<P>
   ''I am clean,'' he said in letters to his wife and parents,
according to Mexico's federal attorney general's office. ''I'm a
good man, and I always have been. In carrying out my official
responsibilities, I have never benefitted from my position in an
illicit way. My life is an open book in that there is nothing to
expose.''
</P>
<P>
   Ramos, an economist who attended the Autonomous Technological
Institute of Mexico and Stanford University, began his career with
the Bank of Mexico and later participated in negotiations of the
North American Free Trade Agreement.

<HEADLINE> White Sox 10, Rangers 6  </HEADLINE>
By NANCY ARMOUR
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHICAGO (AP) -- Magglio Ordonez hit a go-ahead, two-run homer in
the sixth inning and then added an insurance shot in the eighth as
the Chicago White Sox rallied for a 10-6 victory over the Texas
Rangers on Thursday night.
</P>
<P>
   It was the fifth career multihomer game for Ordonez and third
this season.
</P>
<P>
   Carlos Lee added a solo shot and Frank Thomas drove in three
runs for the White Sox, who came back from a 4-0 deficit.
</P>
<P>
   Lorenzo Barcelo (3-1) gave up one run and two hits in 2 1-3
innings. Keith Foulke got the last five outs for his 28th save in
33 chances.
</P>
<P>
   Jeff Zimmerman (3-5) only gave up one run in two innings, but it
was Ordonez's homer.
</P>
<P>
   One night after becoming only the third player in major league
history to play all nine spots in a game, Scott Sheldon stayed put
for Texas. He made his 10th start of the year at third base.
</P>
<P>
   With Cleveland losing, the White Sox extended their lead in the
AL Central to 7&AMP;frac12; games. Chicago heads to Cleveland on Friday for a
series at Jacobs Field.
</P>
<P>
   Texas starter Kenny Rogers had lost his last two starts, but he
looked sharp early against the White Sox. He retired the first 12
batters he faced, striking out three of them.
</P>
<P>
   Ricky Ledee homered as Texas took a 4-0 lead, and Rogers looked
as if he might get his first victory since Aug. 8.
</P>
<P>
   But Lee singled with one out in the fifth, and things went
downhill pretty quickly after that. After another single by Paul
Konerko, Herbert Perry hit a sacrifice fly to cut the Rangers' lead
to 4-1.
</P>
<P>
   Rogers started the sixth with his first walk of the night, to
Charles Johnson, and plunked Ray Durham. Tony Graffanino hit an RBI
single to center, giving the White Sox runners at the corners with
no outs and Thomas up to bat.
</P>
<P>
   The fans started chanting ''M-V-P! M-V-P!'' as Thomas stepped to
the plate, and he didn't disappoint. His double to deep center
field almost lodged in the bullpen fence. By the time Ledee got it
back to the infield, Durham and Graffanino had scored and Thomas
was standing at second, clapping his hands.
</P>
<P>
   That was it for Rogers, who was relieved by Zimmerman. He didn't
fare any better, though, as Ordonez sent the first pitch he saw
over the fence in right field to give the White Sox a 6-5 lead.
</P>
<P>
   Ordonez homered off Darwin Cubillan to start the eighth. Lee
followed with another solo home run, Durham had a sacrifice fly and
Thomas had an RBI single as the White Sox added four more runs.
</P>
<P>
   Luis Alicea and Chad Curtis hit RBI singles as the Rangers took
a 4-0 lead. The Rangers made it 5-1 in the sixth on an RBI single
by Bill Haselman.
</P>
<P>
Notes: The White Sox have hit back-to-back homers 16 times this
season. ... The White Sox presented Jose Valentin and Chris
Singleton with ''Hit for the Cycle'' rings before the game. The
14-karat gold rings have an onyx stone with a white enamel overlay
in the shape of the infield. Four small diamonds represent the four
bases. Valentin hit for the cycle April 27 against Baltimore.
Singleton did it July 6, 1999.

   LOS ANGELES (AP) -- A woman left brain dead after she was shot in
the head during a weekend burglary underwent a Caesarean section
and delivered twins, two months premature.
</P>
<P>
   The boys were born Saturday at Martin Luther King Jr.-Drew
Medical Center. One was in critical condition Thursday and the
other was in stable condition, hospital spokeswoman Inez Beckon
said.
</P>
<P>
   Their mother, Carmen Valencia, 27, was shot early Saturday when
two men broke into the motor home she shared with her husband,
Florencio Altamarena, and son, Jonathan.
</P>
<P>
   The pair demanded money but were turned away by Altamarena. The
burglars fled in a small car but returned minutes later and fired
through a trailer wall, hitting Valencia, police said.
</P>
<P>
   Authorities were seeking the suspects.

<HEADLINE> Jet, Air Force Craft in Near-Miss  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES (AP) -- An F-117 stealth fighter flew close enough to
a United Airlines jet to set off the passenger plane's on-board
radar Thursday, the airline and the military said.
</P>
<P>
   The incident occurred shortly after United flight 174 left Los
Angeles International Airport for Boston about 8:30 a.m., said
Chris Nardella, a spokeswoman for United, which is based in the
Chicago suburb of Elk Grove Village.
</P>
<P>
   The Boeing 757 was flying at about 10,800 feet when its on-board
radar equipment detected an approaching aircraft. Nardella said the
crew kept the plane at that altitude until the Air Force jet passed
overhead.
</P>
<P>
   Preliminary reports showed the United plane and an F-117
Nighthawk stealth fighter came within 500 feet vertically and
six-tenths of a mile horizontally of each other, FAA spokesman
Jerry Snyder said Thursday night.
</P>
<P>
   According to Visual Flight Rules, which the Nighthawk flies by,
''this 500 feet separation was within safe perimeters for all
passing aircrafts,'' Snyder said.
</P>
<P>
   The stealth jet, which is able to evade radar, was broadcasting
its position publicly when the near-miss occurred.
</P>
<P>
   ''The F-117, on a training flight, was not in stealth
configuration and was flying according to FAA rules,'' the Air
Force said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
   Under such conditions the plane uses a standard transponder to
alert other aircraft to its position, the Air Force said.
</P>
<P>
   The F-117 flies out of an Air Force facility in Palmdale, about
60 miles from Los Angeles, and the squadron is based at Edwards Air
Force Base.
</P>
<P>
   The United flight carried 166 passengers and seven crew.

<HEADLINE> 15 Counties, Cities in Census Case  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- A federal court has allowed 15 cities and
counties from around the country to join a court battle over a
Virginia law requiring the use of an exact numerical count when it
redraws political districts.
</P>
<P>
   The Virginia Legislature passed the law this year that prohibits
the use of statistical sampling when the state redraws its
political districts to reflect the 2000 census.
</P>
<P>
   The Census Bureau plans to release two sets of population
counts: a raw head count on Dec. 31 and the sampled count by April
1.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats say sampling helps account for minorities, the
homeless and others who have been undercounted in the past.
Republicans generally favor an exact count.
</P>
<P>
   Virginia, because of its history of racial discrimination, is
one of 16 states required under the federal Voting Rights Act to
gain Justice Department approval to change certain voting laws. In
April, the state asked a three-judge panel of U.S. District Court
for the District of Columbia to rule that the law prohibiting
sampling is acceptable.
</P>
<P>
   The case is being closely watched by other states with similar
laws.
</P>
<P>
   In a Sept. 1 order, the judges granted a bid by the localities
to join the lawsuit.
</P>
<P>
   A court hearing is scheduled for Sept. 21. The Justice
Department has asked the judges to dismiss the case.
</P>
<P>
   The 15 cities, led by Los Angeles, sought to intervene in the
case, arguing that Virginia's plan would be harmful to urban areas
that need sampling to fully account for their population and
receive their full share of federal dollars.
</P>
<P>
   Others involved include Richmond, Va.; Houston; Denver and San
Francisco.
</P>
<P>
   The Supreme Court ruled last year that the raw count must be
used when reapportioning House seats among states. It left open to
states the option to use sampled data when redrawing political
district lines.

<HEADLINE> Woman Wants Out of Columbine Suits  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   DENVER (AP) -- A woman who admitted providing three weapons to
the Columbine High School killers is asking to be dropped as a
defendant in lawsuits brought by families of victims.
</P>
<P>
   In documents filed in U.S. District Court and made public
Thursday, attorneys for Robyn Anderson denied she knew about Eric
Harris' and Dylan Klebold's plan to kill students and teachers at
the school.
</P>
<P>
   The students killed 12 students and a teacher in April 1999
before killing themselves.
</P>
<P>
   Thirteen families who sued Jefferson County Sheriff John Stone
and others over their response to the shootings expanded the list
of defendants to include Anderson, Philip Duran and Mark Manes, who
admitted helping Klebold and Harris get the guns they used.
</P>
<P>
   Anderson, a Columbine student at the time and Klebold's prom
date, bought two shotguns and a rifle for Harris and Klebold at a
gun show. Anderson, who has not been charged, was 18 when she
bought the guns legally and gave them to the two 17-year-olds.
</P>
<P>
   Duran is serving a 4&AMP;frac12;-year prison term and Manes a 6-year term
for providing a fourth weapon.

<HEADLINE> Va. Tech 45, E. Carolina 28  </HEADLINE>
By DAVID DROSCHAK
<TEXT>
<P>
   GREENVILLE, N.C. (AP) -- Like so many times in Frank Beamer's
career, special teams made No. 10 Virginia Tech special Thursday
night.
</P>
<P>
   The Hokies (2-0) blocked two kicks, disrupted another one deep
in East Carolina territory and had an 87-yard punt return in the
first half en route to a 45-28 victory over the Pirates.
</P>
<P>
   Michael Vick barely broke a sweat in the opening 30 minutes,
completing five passes for 56 yards. But Virginia Tech still
managed a 31-0 lead in beating the Pirates (1-1) for the fifth
straight time since 1993.
</P>
<P>
   Vick finished with 106 yards passing and 13 yards rushing, but
the Hokies didn't need a big game from their star quarterback.
</P>
<P>
   Virginia Tech blocked 63 kicks in the '90s under Beamer and got
one punt and a field goal against a reeling East Carolina team that
had practiced hard all week in an attempt to protect punter Wes
Herlocker.
</P>
<P>
   But Herlocker wasn't to blame for a pair of disastrous punt
attempts three minutes apart that gave the Hokies a quick 10-0 lead
in the first quarter and helped turn the game around.
</P>
<P>
   Herlocker was dropped at the East Carolina 35 after the ball
came skidding back to him from snapper Ryan Luckadoo. That miscue
resulted in a 46-yard field goal by Carter Warley.
</P>
<P>
   The next snap from Luckadoo was high, and Wayne Ward burst
through to block the kick. Cory Bird scooped up the ball and raced
into the end zone untouched from 9 yards out.
</P>
<P>
   Things didn't get much better for East Carolina's offense. Late
in the opening quarter, David Garrard was intercepted after he was
hit at the Pirates' 17. Thirty-five seconds later, Andre' Kendrick
bolted in from 14 yards and the rout was on.
</P>
<P>
   Despite leading 17-0, Kendrick's run was Virginia Tech's first
offensive first down.
</P>
<P>
   The Hokies added a 7-yard scoring run from Jarrett Ferguson
before the special teams took over again.
</P>
<P>
   The Pirates finally got off a decent punt, but Andre Davis
returned it 87 yards, faking out Herlocker on his final move, for a
31-0 lead. The return was the second longest in school history.
</P>
<P>
   East Carolina crossed midfield late in the second quarter, but a
25-yard field goal attempt was -- you guessed it -- blocked. The
block was the 78th in 152 games under Beamer.
</P>
<P>
   Virginia Tech's defense, criticized for giving up more than 400
yards to Akron in Saturday's season-opening 52-23 win, limited the
Pirates to 132 yards in the opening half.
</P>
<P>
   East Carolina closed to 31-14 with 4:08 left in the third
quarter, but Lee Suggs raced 56 yards untouched less than a minute
later to halt the Pirates' momentum.
</P>
<P>
   The Pirates were nearly perfect in a 38-0 opening victory over
Duke on Saturday, but started the game with a pass-interference
penalty as Vick went deep on the first play.
</P>
<P>
   East Carolina held, but made a major mistake on offense as a
52-yard pass play to the Virginia Tech 5 was called back because of
an illegal formation.
</P>
<P>
   Then the kicking woes began and things unraveled for the Pirates
in front of 45,123 -- the second largest crowd in Dowdy-Ficklen
Stadium history.

<HEADLINE> Argentina Votes To Lift Immunity  </HEADLINE>
By LAURENCE NORMAN
<TEXT>
<P>
   BUENOS AIRES, Argentina (AP) -- Argentina's lower house approved
a bill Thursday that would limit the immunity of lawmakers from
prosecution in a move that could strengthen an investigation into
alleged vote-buying in the Senate.
</P>
<P>
   The House of Deputies voted 205 to 5 in favor of the bill, which
states that while lawmakers have immunity from arrest, they do not
have immunity from judicial investigations into wrongdoing.
</P>
<P>
   To become law, the bill must be approved by the Senate and
signed by President Fernando De la Rua.
</P>
<P>
   But the Senate on Wednesday, in its first session since the
scandal broke, refused to address the immunity issue, partly
because the two main legislative party blocs could not reach
agreement on how to address the crisis.
</P>
<P>
   The bill means, among other things, that 11 senators implicated
in the vote-buying scandal would lose their immunity.
</P>
<P>
   The senators are alleged to have accepted bribes in exchange for
voting for a controversial labor reform bill in May.
</P>
<P>
   The claims of bribe-taking, which have yet to be substantiated,
have touched off a media frenzy in Argentina, amid speculation that
up to $200,000 had been paid out to sway passage of the labor bill.
</P>
<P>
   The bill, considered a centerpiece of De la Rua's efforts to
revive Argentina's faltering economy, won overwhelming approval in
both congressional houses.
</P>
<P>
   The accusations of vote buying have already affected the
popularity of De la Rua's nine-month-old administration, which took
office for a four-year term on promises to stamp out corruption and
provide honest government.
</P>
<P>
   Federal Judge Carlos Liporaci has said 11 senators should be
stripped of their immunity. If not, he said, ''the investigation
will inevitably be limited.''
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday, Interior Minister Federico Storani said that it is
''likely'' that the President Fernando De la Rua would respond to
the scandal by reshuffling his cabinet when he returns Sept. 15
from a trip abroad.
</P>
<P>
   Storani did not say what the changes would be.
</P>
<P>
   ''We believe that changes in the Senate should be mirrored by
changes within the executive branch because this current political
crisis is very deep,'' Storani told a local radio station.
</P>
<P>
   However, De la Rua said while visiting New York on Thursday for
the U.N. Milennium study that he did not anticipate making any
cabinet changes.
</P>
<P>
   ''I don't want it said that I will make changes when I come
back. I am not anticipating any such Cabinet crisis,'' he was
quoted by the Argentine news agency Diarios y Noticias.

<HEADLINE> Puerto Rican Capital Without Power  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN JUAN, Puerto Rico (AP) -- A broken power line caused a
blackout across the Puerto Rican capital for most of Thursday,
leaving scores of people trapped in elevators and forcing many
businesses to close.
</P>
<P>
   Rush-hour traffic slowed as traffic lights failed across San
Juan. Offices sent workers home after when air conditioners stopped
and computers shut down.
</P>
<P>
   Firefighters worked to free people from elevators in at least 10
buildings, including the Department of Labor, a hospital and a
Marshall's department store.
</P>
<P>
   The Puerto Rico Electric Power Authority blamed the outage on a
break in a 231,000-volt line that carries power over Puerto Rico's
mountains from a generating plant in southern Guayanilla. About
500,000 customers were affected, it said.
</P>
<P>
   By Thursday evening workers had partially repaired the line and
restored service to 400,000 customers, with the remaining customers
expected to regain service Thursday night, said utility spokeswoman
Virginia Reyes.

<HEADLINE> More U.S. Papers Entering Cuba  </HEADLINE>
By The Associated Press	   The Chicago Tribune and The Dallas Morning News
learned Thursday
that they will be allowed to open offices in Havana, Cuba, joining
The Associated Press and CNN as the only U.S.-based news
organizations with bureaus in the communist country.
<TEXT>
<P>
   Cuban Foreign Minister Felipe Perez Roque gave permission in
separate meetings Thursday with Tribune Co. CEO John Madigan and
Morning News publisher Burl Osborne. The discussions took place in
New York City, where Perez Roque was attending the U.N. Millennium
Summit along with Cuban President Fidel Castro and Ricardo Alarcon,
president of Cuba's National Assembly.
</P>
<P>
   ''They are the two media that have shown interest for some
time'' in opening bureaus in Havana, Alarcon told the AP in an
interview Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Cuba has slowly opened up to American news media in recent
years, especially following Pope John Paul II's visit to the island
nation in January 1997. Amid moves in Congress to ease
long-standing U.S. trade sanctions against Cuba, authorities in
Havana want average Americans to learn more about their country and
ultimately weigh in against the embargo.
</P>
<P>
   CNN opened a Havana bureau in 1997, and the AP returned the
following year -- almost three decades after the communist
government expelled the news gathering cooperative's last permanent
correspondent there.
</P>
<P>
   ''The Cuba story is one that needs to be told properly,''
Madigan told the AP. ''Being there allows you to do that. We have
had a lot of interest in events in Cuba, and this is another way to
bring our readers in-depth coverage of subjects important to
them.''
</P>
<P>
   Osborne said the announcement was an honor to The News, which
already has four international bureaus.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is an important recognition of the role The Dallas
Morning News has played in bringing insight and understanding of
Latin America to Texas and throughout the United States,'' Osborne
said. ''This will enable us to do an even better job in the future
as the distance between countries and peoples continues to
shrink.''
</P>
<P>
   Gilbert Bailon, The News' executive editor, said a bureau chief
would be appointed soon for the Cuba office, which officials hope
to open later this year.
</P>
<P>
   James O'Shea, the deputy managing editor for news at the
Tribune, said the Havana office would be a ''Tribune company
bureau,'' meaning it would be operated in conjunction with the
company's other news outlets, including the Sun-Sentinel in Fort
Lauderdale, Fla., and The Orlando Sentinel, also in Florida.
</P>
<P>
   The Tribune earlier this year acquired Times Mirror Co., owner
of the Los Angeles Times, the (Baltimore) Sun, Newsday on New
York's Long Island, other newspapers and numerous specialty
magazines.
</P>
<P>
   O'Shea said it remained unclear what kind of access those papers
would have to the Havana bureau, but Madigan said the Cuban
government seemed interested in the company's reach.
</P>
<P>
   ''(Cuban officials) definitely felt that our group of newspapers
would provide them significant coverage of the Cuban story,''
Madigan said.
</P>
<P>
   He didn't know when the bureau would officially open or how many
employees it will have.

<HEADLINE> Khatami Seeks Apology From U.S.  </HEADLINE>
By SAM F. GHATTAS
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Iran's president said Thursday that relations
between his country and the United States will improve only if the
Americans apologize for past policies in Iran -- and even that may
not be enough.
</P>
<P>
   There are ''the various sanctions. There are animosities, there
are allegations against Iran,'' said Mohammad Khatami, at a news
conference. ''We need apology for those as well as some practical
measures and steps that prove that in reality the behavior has
changed.
</P>
<P>
   ''But unfortunately, in practice, Americans have been less
inclined to do this,'' said Khatami, one of about 150 leaders
attending the three-day Millennium Summit at the United Nations.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton also is in New York and on Wednesday the
leaders listened to each other's speeches at the U.N. General
Assembly. But Khatami was not invited to a reception hosted by
Clinton Thursday night at New York's Metropolitan Museum, said
National Security Council spokesman P.J. Crowley. Iraq, Libya and
Cuba were also excluded.
</P>
<P>
   The mere presence of both presidents at the United Nations
sparked the possibility of an encounter, even by coincidence.
</P>
<P>
   But Khatami indicated that any such meeting would be premature,
because Iran still had ''serious issues'' with the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Khatami, the reform-minded cleric who has been seeking better
relations with the West since his election in 1997, has taken steps
to open up Iran and improve its international standing by calling
for dialogue between the Americans and the Iranians.
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton administration has addressed Iranian grievances and
also has taken some concrete steps in the area of trade and
people-to-people contact. In February, Secretary of State Madeleine
Albright said Iranians have reason to resent the American
intervention in the 1953 coup on behalf of Shah Mohammad Reza
Pahlavi, but she did not apologize.
</P>
<P>
   Albright also lifted sanctions on some Iranian imports,
including the famed Persian carpets, and announced a reduction in
restrictions to contacts between American and Iranian scholars,
artists and athletes.
</P>
<P>
   But Khatami, who is locked in a power struggle at home with
hardliners who oppose reforms and his opening up to the West, said
that American gestures were not adequate.
</P>
<P>
   Khatami said the United States must acknowledge and apologize
for past wrong policies, including the 1953 coup and what he
described as damage done to his nation by U.S.-backed regimes since
then.
</P>
<P>
   ''The Americans will have to confess to this. Through this
confession -- if the Americans accept to do it -- I think it will be
a very big step toward removing our misunderstandings. But
unfortunately, in action, they have not done this,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Khatami said the controversy over 10 Iranian Jews convicted for
espionage on behalf of Israel in Iran was blown out of proportion.
He said the government would not interfere in the case, which has
drawn condemnation from Israel and criticism from the United States
</P>
<P>
   ''If instead of these Jews they were Christians, would the world
still react as it does today?'' he asked.

<HEADLINE> Jury: Aryans To Pay $6.3M in Suit  </HEADLINE>
By JOHN K. WILEY
<TEXT>
<P>
   COEUR D'ALENE, Idaho (AP) -- A jury on Thursday awarded $6.3
million to a woman and her son who were attacked by Aryan Nations
guards outside the white supremacist group's north Idaho
headquarters.
</P>
<P>
   The jury found that Aryan Nations leader Richard Butler, the
group and its corporate entity, Saphire, Inc., were negligent in
the selection, training and supervision of the security guards who
assaulted Victoria and Jason Keenan two years ago.
</P>
<P>
   The Keenans' attorney, Morris Dees, had asked the jury to award
more than $11 million in punitive damages. Dees, of the Montgomery,
Ala.-based Southern Poverty Law Center, has said he hoped the
penalty would be severe enough to bankrupt the Aryan Nations.
</P>
<P>
   The 82-year-old Butler spoke briefly outside the courtroom,
comparing himself to some biblical figures and also declaring
northern Idaho a haven for racists.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is nothing,'' Butler said. ''We have planted seeds. Most
of north Idaho now is filled with the people who escaped
multiculturalism or diversity or whatever you want to call it.''
</P>
<P>
   Jurors set $6 million as a punitive damage award, with $330,000
in compensatory damages to the Keenans, who were chased, shot at
and assaulted after they stopped to search for a dropped wallet
near the entrance to the Aryan Nations' compound.
</P>
<P>
   Dees said he doesn't intend to allow the defendants to begin
disposing of their assets.
</P>
<P>
   ''We intend to enforce this verdict. We intend to take every
single asset from the Aryan Nations now and forever,'' he said.
''We intend to even take the name Aryan Nations and hopefully,
through the judicial process, close that sad chapter in this
nation's history.''
</P>
<P>
   Victoria Keenan, 44, spoke briefly, thanking the jury, her
lawyers and her family. ''Without them, I don't think I could have
done all this,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Edgar Steele, who represents Butler and the Aryan Nations, said
he will move for a new trial. If that fails, he will appeal and may
also seek to have the judgment amount reduced. Butler would have to
post a $9 million bond to appeal.
</P>
<P>
   ''I consider this area to be one of the last bastions of free
speech in America,'' Steele said. ''You can write the epitaph for
that now.''
</P>
<P>
   The jury found Butler, the Aryan Nations and Saphire Inc. 90
percent negligent and liable for $4.8 million of the award.
Butler's chief of staff, Michael Teague, was found 10 percent
negligent and liable for $600,000.
</P>
<P>
   The former guards Jesse Warfield and John Yeager -- who are
serving prison terms for the assaults on the Keenans -- were also
found liable for punitive damages. Yeager was assessed $100,000 in
punitive damages and Warfield $500,000 in punitive damages.
</P>
<P>
   The jury also awarded Victoria Keenan $250,000 and Jason Keenan
$80,000 in compensatory damages.
</P>
<P>
   Steele blamed the two guards and argued Butler was not
responsible. Steele said that Warfield and Yeager were drunk --
against regulations -- when they attacked the Keenans on the evening
of July 1, 1998.
</P>
<P>
   Warfield and Yeager, who represented themselves, took
responsibility for the attack, but steadfastly refusing to
implicate Butler. They said they mistook a car backfire as gunfire
from the Keenans and perceived a threat.
</P>
<P>
   Steele said Butler preaches nonviolence, except in self-defense.
</P>
<P>
   Butler tried to distance himself from the actions of Warfield,
Yeager and a third former guard, whom he called unpaid volunteers.
The third former guard, Shane Wright, remains a fugitive.
</P>
<P>
   Butler presides over the Church of Jesus Christ-Christian, which
holds that whites are the true children of God, that Jews are the
offspring of Satan and that blacks and other minorities are
inferior.
</P>
<P>
   His disciples have included some of the most notorious figures
in the white supremacist movement, such as Robert Mathews, who
founded a neo-Nazi offshoot of the Aryan Nations, and Buford
Furrow, who is awaiting trial in Los Angeles on charges of killing
an Asian-American postal carrier and shooting up a Jewish day care
center last summer.
</P>
<P>
   From his compound, which is valued at about $200,000 and has a
sign out front that reads ''Whites only,'' Butler mails his
literature, recruits followers and plays host to the annual Aryan
World Congress, a skinhead symposium that often draws more than 100
acolytes. The gathering is generally held on Adolf Hitler's
birthday.
</P>
<P>
   Dees has long used lawsuits to destroy the finances of hate
groups. In six such lawsuits, the Montgomery, Ala., lawyer has
never lost.
</P>
<P>
   In 1987, Dees won a $7 million verdict against a Ku Klux Klan
organization over the slaying of a 19-year-old black man in Mobile,
Ala., forcing the group to turn over its headquarters building. In
1990, he won $9 million in Portland, Ore., against the White Aryan
Resistance in the beating death of a black man by neo-Nazi
skinheads.

<HEADLINE> Tampa Bay's Rupe Still Hospitalized  </HEADLINE>
By TOM WITHERS
<TEXT>
<P>
   CLEVELAND (AP) -- Tampa Bay pitcher Ryan Rupe remained
hospitalized Thursday after a blood clot was discovered above his
right biceps, and he underwent a procedure to have an arm vein
opened to improve blood flow.
</P>
<P>
   The 25-year-old Rupe left his start Wednesday night against the
Indians in the third inning complaining of stiffness in his arm.
But after being examined by Devil Rays trainer Jamie Reed and
Cleveland team doctor Louis Keppler, Rupe was taken to the
hospital.
</P>
<P>
   ''He came out after the first inning and said his arm was a
little stiff,'' Reed said. ''But that's him, he's a battler. He
didn't want to come out.''
</P>
<P>
   But Reed said he knew something was more drastically wrong with
Rupe, who in 1997 had surgery to remove part of a rib in his right
arm pit and has had previous circulation problems.
</P>
<P>
   ''His hand was really swollen and the vein through his biceps
looked like a garden hose it was so engorged,'' said Reed. ''This
was abnormal.''
</P>
<P>
   When Rupe got the hospital doctors discovered a blockage in his
biceps and a blood clot in his upper arm, Reed said. It is not
uncommon for patients who have surgeries similar to the one Rupe
underwent in '97 to develop blood clots.
</P>
<P>
   ''But this was beyond his normal,'' Reed said.
</P>
<P>
   Rupe was given a blood thinning medication to dissolve the blood
clot. He had one of the two veins that return blood from his hand
to his heart cleared on Thursday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   ''The procedure was very successful,'' Tampa Bay manager Larry
Rothschild said. ''He'll be monitored over the next 24-48 hours and
will probably be released in Saturday.''
</P>
<P>
   After his release, Rupe will return to St. Petersburg, Fla., and
will be examined by Devil Rays vascular specialist Dr. Larry
Williams.
</P>
<P>
   Barring any complications, Rupe may be able to start doing light
exercise as early as next week. Reed said it was too early to say
whether or not Rupe would pitch again this season.
</P>
<P>
   But Rothschild suggested it might be better for Rupe to wait
until next spring before he returns.
</P>
<P>
   ''I would question whether he'll be able to come back this
year,'' Rothschild said.
</P>
<P>
   Rothschild praised Reed for his role in diagnosing Rupe's
condition, which could have been life-threatening had it not been
caught.
</P>
<P>
   ''For an injury that's not very common, he did a heck of a
job,'' said Rothschild. ''Jamie is the one who noticed it. I give
him credit because you never know what can happen with those
things.''
</P>
<P>
   Rupe was selected in the sixth round of the 1998 draft by the
Devils Rays. Last season he became the first Tampa draft pick to be
called up and went 8-9 with a 4.55 ERA in 24 starts.
</P>
<P>
   He was 5-6 with a 6.92 ERA in 18 starts this season.
</P>
<P>
   Following Tampa Bay's 4-3 win Thursday night, Rothschild said he
was relieved to hear Rupe was doing fine.
</P>
<P>
   ''That was very good news,'' he said. ''We really didn't know
how serious it was, so nobody on the team was really scared. From
what they told me, it was not life-threatening. If it was in the
lower extremities, that would have been a lot worse.''

<HEADLINE> Indians Ready for Shot With Sox  </HEADLINE>
By TOM WITHERS
<TEXT>
<P>
   CLEVELAND (AP) -- They've stalked the Chicago White Sox for a few
months. And this weekend, the Cleveland Indians finally have a
chance to shake them.
</P>
<P>
   ''There's no question we've been basically dying to face Chicago
again,'' Indians reliever Paul Shuey said. ''We have one more shot
at a team that's been kicking our butts all year.''
</P>
<P>
   The Indians will open a three-game series on Friday night
against the AL Central-leading White Sox, who insist they're not
feeling any pressure at all.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think it's bigger for them,'' said Frank Thomas. ''They want
to make a statement. We've pretty much led the division all year,
and they've controlled the division the last six, seven years. They
still feel they can win it, so we've got to go in and play our
butts off and show them we're for real.''
</P>
<P>
   After blowing a 3-0 lead Thursday night and losing 4-3 to Tampa
Bay, Cleveland leads the AL wild card race by two games but trails
the White Sox by 7&AMP;frac12; games in the division. It's the same deficit
the Indians faced on June 21 -- the last time they played the White
Sox.
</P>
<P>
   But the Indians are a far different team than they were in June.
</P>
<P>
   And so are the White Sox, who are 7-3 against Cleveland this
season and swept a three-game series at Jacobs Field in June.
</P>
<P>
   ''That's true, but half that team wasn't there,'' Thomas said.
''They're a tough, tough ballclub when they're rolling. They're
going to be on their 'A' game because they're already on it.
They've been waiting for us to roll in.''
</P>
<P>
   Cleveland, which couldn't shake the injury bug for the first few
months this season, has gone 23-11 since Aug. 2, trimming four
games off Chicago's seemingly insurmountable divisional lead.
</P>
<P>
   But although his team has been playing better for more than a
month, Cleveland manager Charlie Manuel began noticing a drastic
change in his players following a 10-9 loss at Anaheim on Aug. 27.
</P>
<P>
   In that game, the Indians blew a 3-0 lead and had three runners
thrown out at the plate.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think that's when we really started playing better,'' Manuel
said. ''Our players made up their minds that we wanted to play
better and they've raised up their intensity. They seemed to get
mad, and I didn't have to say a thing.''
</P>
<P>
   In their next 10 games, the Indians went 8-2.
</P>
<P>
   There have been other changes in the Indians since the last time
they saw the White Sox. Through trades Cleveland added David Segui
and Wil Cordero to its lineup and Steve Woodard, Bob Wickman and
Jason Bere to the pitching staff.
</P>
<P>
   Those e additions have helped resurrect a season which seemed
doomed by injuries early on.
</P>
<P>
   ''With all that has happened to us, just getting to the
postseason would be special,'' said Indians general manager John
Hart said. ''We've gotten healthy. We've made trades and we've
played well in August and so far in September.''
</P>
<P>
   Extending their season beyond Oct. 1 won't be easy for the
Indians. Beginning Friday, Cleveland will play 18 of its final 25
games against playoff contenders, including eight against the
Boston Red Sox -- their closest wild-card pursuer.
</P>
<P>
   Winning their sixth straight division title isn't out of the
question, but the Indians know time is running out.
</P>
<P>
   And this weekend the Indians can close the gap on Chicago
without having to rely on any outside help.
</P>
<P>
   ''This series is meaningful,'' Hart said. ''I don't think
sending a message to the White Sox is necessarily what we're out to
do.''

<HEADLINE> MTV Awards keep up its reputation for unpredictability  </HEADLINE>
By DAVID BAUDER
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) - Foul-mouthed rapper Eminem performed ''The Real
Slim Shady'' while walking into Radio City Music Hall with an army
of lookalikes Thursday, then walked out with the top honors on the
MTV Video Music Awards.
</P>
<P>
   Along the way, pop music's annual wild party lived up to its
reputation with a high-altitude stagecrasher, profane jokes that
tested the censor's trigger finger and a winner who admitted she
hated making videos.
</P>
<P>
   Eminem's signature song was named video of the year and best
male video. He rapped it while walking in off Sixth Avenue, where
earlier in the evening a gay rights group protested his violent
lyrics.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm going to take this home and put it right between my
Britney Spears and Christina Aguilera posters,'' he said while
toting his trophy, mentioning the two teen singers he has ridiculed
in song.
</P>
<P>
   Another Eminem nemesis, the pop band 'N Sync, took home three
trophies, including best pop video and viewer's choice for their
marionette clip, ''Bye Bye Bye.''
</P>
<P>
   Slinky soul star Aaliyah, rock veterans Red Hot Chili Peppers,
Macy Gray and Bjork each won two awards. Eminem shared a third
award with mentor Dr. Dre.
</P>
<P>
   While Limp Bizkit accepted the award for best rock video, a
long-haired gatecrasher appeared sitting atop a stage prop about 10
feet above them. The audience chanted ''jump, jump'' as security
guards tried to get him down.
</P>
<P>
   He was later identified as Timmy Commerford, bass player for the
rock band, Rage Against the Machine. He was arrested for assault
and resisting arrest, according to New York Police Detective Ed
Reuss. One of the band's bodyguards, Perrin Bentle, was arrested
for obstructing justice.
</P>
<P>
   Five men were also arrested in the crowd outside the awards
show, charged with sexually abusing women, Reuss said.
</P>
<P>
   Hosts Shawn and Marlon Wayans had several profanities bleeped
out by sensitive censors, who even screened out the name of ''The
Sopranos'' television character, Big Pussy. Aerosmith's Steven
Tyler had a lewd joke about an MTV personality partly censored.
</P>
<P>
   It was typical for the annual awards ceremony, where making a
dramatic impression is more important than taking home an award.
</P>
<P>
   One of the best jokes was unspoken: Napster founder Shawn
Fanning appearing on stage in a Metallica t-shirt. The heavy metal
band is leading the fight to stop Fanning's Internet song-sharing
service.
</P>
<P>
   ''Nice shirt,'' MTV's Carson Daly said. Metallica's Lars Ulrich,
sitting in the audience, feigned sleep.
</P>
<P>
   After Gray won best new artist in a video for her breakout hit,
''I Try,'' she made a confession. ''I hate making videos,'' she
said while picking up the trophy for her clip, which shows her
chasing a lover with a flower.
</P>
<P>
   With MTV airing fewer videos, the annual Video Music Awards is
less about artistry in the form and more about celebrating the pop
culture stars of the moment. Fueled by the teen pop explosion, last
year's show was the top-rated entertainment program in cable
television history.
</P>
<P>
   Throngs of fans crowded the streets around Radio City Music
Hall. They watched the entrances of celebrities like ''Survivor''
winner Richard Hatch. He was dressed in a black suit, not taking
the chance of walking around naked like he did on Pulau Tiga.
</P>
<P>
   ''Is this weird or what?'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Security was tight, particularly after taping for after another
music awards show - the Source Hip-Hop Music Awards - was halted by
a melee in California last month.
</P>
<P>
   Before the show, members of the Gay and Lesbian Alliance Against
Defamation protested against MTV, angry at the network's support of
Eminem. They say his lyrics promote violence against homosexuals
and women.
</P>
<P>
   GLAAD said it asked MTV not to let Eminem perform at the Video
Music Awards, but was refused. MTV's ran a public-service
advertisement discouraging violence against gays directly after
Eminem's performance, which GLAAD's Scott Seomin called, ''a very
small consolation.''
</P>
<P>
   MTV, in a statement, said Eminem's ''homophobic and misogynistic
lyrics'' have never appeared on the network.
</P>
<P>
   ''While many people find his lyrics offensive or irresponsible,
including many of us at MTV, he's obviously struck a chord with our
audience,'' MTV said. ''We think the most honest and effective
thing to do is offer a forum for all of these viewpoints on our
network.''

<HEADLINE> Mitsubishi Announces New Recall  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   TOKYO (AP) -- Mitsubishi Motors Corp. announced a new recall
Thursday on fuel caps it first recalled just two weeks ago, when
the Japanese automaker acknowledged a 20-year cover-up of auto
defects.
</P>
<P>
   The latest recall was necessary because the replacement cap
didn't work properly.
</P>
<P>
   The unusual recall is another in a string of embarrassments for
Mitsubishi Motors, which is under police investigation in the
cover-up that has forced it to call back 620,000 vehicles.
</P>
<P>
   The 45,000 Minicab trucks, sold only in Japan, were among the
recalls announced Aug. Fuel-tank caps wouldn't shut properly,
resulting in possible leaks. No accidents have been reported linked
to the defect.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday's second recall became necessary after Mitsubishi
Motors found that exchanging the caps didn't solve the problem: The
openings for the lids were also defective, company spokesman Fumio
Nishizaki said.
</P>
<P>
   The Japanese media have been scrutinizing Mitsubishi Motors this
week after it acknowledged it was renegotiating a deal reached
earlier this year with DaimlerChrysler.
</P>
<P>
   The government on Friday filed a criminal complaint against
Mitsubishi Motors Inc., Japan's fourth-largest automaker, for
covering up defects for more than 20 years.
</P>
<P>
   Shortly after the government action, Mitsubishi President
Katsuhiko Kawasoe announced his intention to resign to take
responsibility for the scandal.
</P>
<P>
   Kawasoe's announcement came just hours before Tokyo-based
Mitsubishi was expected to announce a major management reshuffle as
part of a plan to repair its badly-damaged image.
</P>
<P>
   According to media reports, Mitsubishi will partially turn over
leadership to an executive from Germany's DaimlerChrysler AG, which
agreed earlier this year to buy a 34 percent stake in the Japanese
automaker.
</P>
<P>
   DaimlerChrysler is now expected to raise its stake -- to nearly
40 percent according to some Japanese media reports -- and also to
win greater representation on the board.
</P>
<P>
   Both the Nikkei and Germany's Stuttgarter Nachrichten reported
that DaimlerChrysler would send Rolf Eckrodt, the boss of its
former rail subsidiary, Adtranz, to be top executive at Mitsubishi.
The Nikkei said Eckrodt would oversee Mitsubishi's passenger car
division. The Stuttgarter said Eckrodt would be the Mitsubishi's
new vice chairman, the No. 2 position at the company.
</P>
<P>
   The Mitsubishi cover-up surfaced after government inspectors
found documents about consumer complaints and auto defects in a
company locker room. The defects included failing brakes, fuel
leaks and faulty clutches.

<HEADLINE> Hamilton Township teachers vote to defy judge's order  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   HAMILTON, N.J. (AP) - Despite the threat of being fined, fired
or even sent to jail, striking teachers in the Hamilton Township
district voted unanimously Thursday to defy a state Superior Court
judge's back to work order.
</P>
<P>
   The teachers, at a dawn meeting, voted to return to picket lines
despite the possible consequences, said Karen Joseph, spokeswoman
for the New Jersey Education Association.
</P>
<P>
   ''Everyone in the room said, yes, they understood they could be
fined, they could be fired, they could be jailed, they could be
assigned community service but that's when you have to stand.
That's what you have to do,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Joseph said the teachers are willing to face the consequences
because they're frustrated. For the past 10 years, teachers have
agreed to smaller raises than they wanted, she said.
</P>
<P>
   ''Now they've reached a point where they said, 'Enough is
enough.' There is a $4.5 million surplus in the school budget.
Taxpayers have voted three years in a row to support the school
budget,'' she said. ''Life is good. These are good times and now
what's right is right and this board is not getting the message.''
</P>
<P>
   Following the union's vote, school officials canceled classes
for Thursday but remained hopeful that school would be open Friday.
''We're still taking this on a day-by-day basis,'' a district
spokeswoman said.
</P>
<P>
   Superior Court Judge Anthony J. Parrillo on Wednesday ordered
the teachers to go back to work. He also ordered both sides to hold
another negotiating session Thursday night. The session ended at
about 11:30 p.m. with the mediator ordering both sides to return to
the table at 6 p.m. on Sunday, Joseph said.
</P>
<P>
   She said the union was still on strike Thursday night and would
hold a general membership meeting at 5:30 a.m. Friday. She said the
meeting would be to update members on the situation.
</P>
<P>
   Joseph said the union believes the school should be closed
Friday, but ''that's a decision the administration makes.''
</P>
<P>
   Members of the Hamilton Township Education Association, which
represents about 1,450 teachers and other staff in the Mercer
County district, went on strike Wednesday morning.
</P>
<P>
   The union and the board of education reached an impasse in
negotiating a new, three-year contract. Salary increases and health
insurance issues remained unresolved. Union officials have
requested 5 percent raises in each of the three years of the
contract; the board has offered raises of 4 percent in the first
year of the contract, 4.1 percent in the second year and 4.2
percent in the third year.
</P>
<P>
   Courts in New Jersey have ruled that public employees do not
have the right to strike.
</P>
<P>
   The New Jersey School Boards Association has condemned the
strike and criticized the union for ''continuing to disrupt
students' education and the daily life of families in the
community.''
</P>
<P>
   ''Unfortunately the teachers union has decided to compound the
issue by violating the judge's order,'' said Mike Yaple, spokesman
for the school boards association.
</P>
<P>
   Yaple said the district could return to court to seek
enforcement of the order.
</P>
<P>
   District officials did not request that Parrillo enforce the
order Thursday, the court clerk said.
</P>
<P>
   District Superintendent Neil A. Bencivengo was meeting with
principals Thursday and was not immediately available for comment,
a receptionist said.
</P>
<P>
   Fines or other penalties would be determined by a judge, Yaple
said. Fines can be levied against union members and the union
itself.
</P>
<P>
   It is rare for striking teachers to be sentenced to jail, Yaple
said.
</P>
<P>
   ''It hasn't been done in quite a number of years,'' he said.
''In fact we as an association discourage that concept.''
</P>
<P>
   Not including the strike by teachers in Hamilton Township, there
have been eight strikes by New Jersey teachers in the past eight
years, Yaple said. They lasted an average of two to three days.
</P>
<P>
   In the five years before that, there were three times as many
strikes, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ''Substantial fines were imposed by courts since then and strike
activity decreased dramatically in the 1992-1993 school year,'' he
said. ''Fines made a difference and at the time there was a growing
lack of public support for teachers' strikes.''

long-haired gatecrasher appeared sitting atop a stage prop about 10
feet above them. The audience chanted ''jump, jump'' as security
guards tried to get him down.
</P>
<P>
   He was later identified as Timmy Commerford, bass player for the
rock band, Rage Against the Machine. He was arrested for assault
and resisting arrest, according to New York Police Detective Ed
Reuss. One of the band's bodyguards, Perrin Bentle, was arrested
for obstructing justice.
</P>
<P>
   Five men were also arrested in the crowd outside the awards
show, charged with sexually abusing women, Reuss said.
</P>
<P>
   Hosts Shawn and Marlon Wayans had several profanities bleeped
out by sensitive censors, who even screened out the name of ''The
Sopranos'' television character, Big Pussy. Aerosmith's Steven
Tyler had a lewd joke about an MTV personality partly censored.
</P>
<P>
   It was typical for the annual awards ceremony, where making a
dramatic impression is more important than taking home an award.
</P>
<P>
   One of the best jokes was unspoken: Napster founder Shawn
Fanning appearing on stage in a Metallica t-shirt. The heavy metal
band is leading the fight to stop Fanning's Internet song-sharing
service.
</P>
<P>
   ''Nice shirt,'' MTV's Carson Daly said. Metallica's Lars Ulrich,
sitting in the audience, feigned sleep.
</P>
<P>
   After Gray won best new artist in a video for her breakout hit,
''I Try,'' she made a confession. ''I hate making videos,'' she
said while picking up the trophy for her clip, which shows her
chasing a lover with a flower.
</P>
<P>
   With MTV airing fewer videos, the annual Video Music Awards is
less about artistry in the form and more about celebrating the pop
culture stars of the moment. Fueled by the teen pop explosion, last
year's show was the top-rated entertainment program in cable
television history.
</P>
<P>
   Throngs of fans crowded the streets around Radio City Music
Hall. They watched the entrances of celebrities like ''Survivor''
winner Richard Hatch. He was dressed in a black suit, not taking
the chance of walking around naked like he did on Pulau Tiga.
</P>
<P>
   ''Is this weird or what?'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Security was tight, particularly after taping for after another
music awards show -- the Source Hip-Hop Music Awards -- was halted by
a melee in California last month.
</P>
<P>
   Before the show, members of the Gay and Lesbian Alliance Against
Defamation protested against MTV, angry at the network's support of
Eminem. They say his lyrics promote violence against homosexuals
and women.
</P>
<P>
   GLAAD said it asked MTV not to let Eminem perform at the Video
Music Awards, but was refused. MTV's ran a public-service
advertisement discouraging violence against gays directly after
Eminem's performance, which GLAAD's Scott Seomin called, ''a very
small consolation.''
</P>
<P>
   MTV, in a statement, said Eminem's ''homophobic and misogynistic
lyrics'' have never appeared on the network.
</P>
<P>
   ''While many people find his lyrics offensive or irresponsible,
including many of us at MTV, he's obviously struck a chord with our
audience,'' MTV said. ''We think the most honest and effective
thing to do is offer a forum for all of these viewpoints on our
network.''

<HEADLINE> Philippines Hostages Seen Released  </HEADLINE>
By JIM GOMEZ
<TEXT>
<P>
   ZAMBOANGA, Philippines (AP) -- Mediators visited the camp of a
rebel group holding several hostages on Friday, saying later that
at least some of the group's six Europeans captives would soon be
freed.
</P>
<P>
   ''For sure, there will be a release today,'' said one of the two
go-betweens, whose code-named is ''Dragon.'' He is the uncle of one
of the Abu Sayyaf rebel commanders.
</P>
<P>
   The release, originally expected Friday morning, was delayed by
a series of last-minute snags. An official close to the negotiating
team said Libyan officials had brought only $4 million in ransom
money, enough to pay for the release of just four of the hostages.
</P>
<P>
   The Abu Sayyaf rebels had earlier pledged to free all six on
Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Libya has played a prominent role in negotiations for 21 people
kidnapped April 23 from Malaysia's Sipadan diving resort. Last week
it paid $6 million for the release of six other Westerners from the
group, negotiators said. It insists the money will go for
development projects, not directly to the rebels.
</P>
<P>
   But Libya has resisted paying for two of the remaining hostages,
both French television journalists seized while covering the
hostage crisis, saying their company should foot the bill.
</P>
<P>
   Ambassadors from the hostages' countries were scheduled to fly
to the southern port city of Zamboanga later Friday to receive the
captives from negotiators. The freed hostages are to fly Saturday
to Libya on their way home.
</P>
<P>
   The rebels are still holding two Finns, a French and a German
from Sipadan and the two journalists in their camp on Jolo island,
as well as 12 Filipino Christian evangelists who were captured in
early July. A Filipino hostage from Sipadan was taken to the camp
of another rebel faction.
</P>
<P>
   A separate faction also is holding an American man, Jeffrey
Schilling, kidnapped early last week.
</P>
<P>
   The government negotiator working for Schilling's release said
emissaries have contacted rebel spokesman Abu Sabaya, who belongs
to that faction, but negotiations had not yet begun. ''As of this
moment, Abu Sabaya's group keeps on moving for security reasons,''
provincial Vice Governor Munib Estino said.
</P>
<P>
   The rebels have not announced their demands for Schilling's
release, although Sabaya has privately demanded $10 million,
negotiators said.
</P>
<P>
   Schilling, 24, a Muslim convert from Oakland, California, was
seized Aug. 28 when he visited an Abu Sayyaf camp with his Filipino
Muslim wife, Ivi Osani.
</P>
<P>
   Presidential Press Secretary Ricardo Puno said Schilling appears
to be in good condition, despite earlier reports he was ill. ''He's
not undergoing rough treatment. He's OK,'' Puno said.
</P>
<P>
   Philippine officials have questioned whether the case is a
simple kidnapping since Osani is Sabaya's second cousin and the
widow of a rebel killed by government forces. Osani was not
abducted and is being held in protective custody in a military
hospital.
</P>
<P>
   ''It could either be pure love or there could be a lot of
intrigue in the background,'' Puno said. ''At this time we cannot
say with any finality what her role was. But it certainly was not a
passive one since she made arrangements for him to go to the
camp.''

<HEADLINE> Minn. Family Treated for Anthrax  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   ST. PAUL, Minn. (AP) -- Six members of a Minnesota farm family
are being treated after eating meat from a cow that had anthrax,
health officials said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   The Minnesota Department of Health didn't provide information on
their conditions, but said two developed symptoms of
gastrointenstinal anthrax. Anthrax usually infects the skin, but
can affect the digestive track and respiratory system.
</P>
<P>
   ''There's never been a case of gastrointestinal anthrax reported
in the United States,'' said Richard Danila, assistant state
epidemiologist. ''This was a very unique set of circumstances that
happened whereby a family of six consumed meat found to be heavily
contaminated with anthrax.''
</P>
<P>
   They raised the cow on their own farm and had it processed at a
small custom slaughterhouse. Regulators don't inspect meat in such
cases because it was for the family's own use.
</P>
<P>
   The health department said the general public isn't at risk
because animals processed for commercial sale are inspected.
</P>
<P>
   Cattle catch the disease by ingesting spores from the anthrax
bacteria, but humans rarely become infected. If inhaled, anthrax
can be deadly in humans.

<HEADLINE> Albright Speaks on Montenegro  </HEADLINE>
By BARRY SCHWEID
<TEXT>
<P>
   UNITED NATIONS (AP) -- In a thinly veiled warning to Belgrade,
Secretary of State Madeleine Albright voiced concern Thursday about
the safety of Montenegro and its independence-minded President Milo
Djukanovic.
</P>
<P>
   At a news conference, Albright also disclosed plans for a joint
NATO naval exercise with Croatia off the coast of Montenegro, the
smaller of the two republics of Yugoslavia. At the Pentagon,
spokesman Kenneth Bacon said fewer than 300 Marines would take part
in a weeklong exercise later this month. He said planning for the
exercise began before the elections were called in Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
   Djukanovic, a leading foe of Yugoslav President Slobodan
Milosevic, and his ruling coalition have refused to participate in
Yugoslavia's presidential election Sept. 24. He claimed recently
that if the republic of 600,000 took part, it would give legitimacy
to the Belgrade government and prolong its survival.
</P>
<P>
   Milosevic's behavior has always been ''undemocratic,''
Djukanovic said.
</P>
<P>
   Albright said the Montenegrin president ''is always in a very
difficult position.''
</P>
<P>
   ''He is someone who is taking a lot of risks for democracy in
Montenegro, and I think there is obviously concern generally for
his security,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   While denying reports that she had offered Djukanovic security
guarantees at their breakfast meeting Thursday, she said pointedly:
''We are concerned about the security of Montenegro and of
President Djukanovic, and nothing is off the table.''
</P>
<P>
   Milosevic long has been a target both of U.S. rhetoric and NATO
fire.
</P>
<P>
   Serbia, the larger of Yugoslavia's two republics, was bombed by
the U.S.-led allies to force the departure of Serb troops and
special police from Kosovo, a Serb province where they were accused
of mass slaughter of ethnic Albanians.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, the Clinton administration has provided
financial assistance to Montenegro, strengthening Djukanovic's hand
in confronting the Yugoslav president.
</P>
<P>
   Tensions have grown in Montenegro amid Djukanovic's call for a
boycott of the elections and his allegations Milosevic imposed
changes in the Yugoslav constitution to weaken Montenegro's
influence.
