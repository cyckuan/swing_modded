<HEADLINE> British Plant Nuke Processing Cited </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LONDON (AP) -- A Rolls-Royce plant in central England has been  
processing nuclear fuel for the Defense Ministry without the local 
community's knowledge, and it had no public emergency plan in case 
of an accident, The Sunday Times reported. 
</P>
<P>
	The people of Derby had been aware that the factory makes  
engines for Trident nuclear submarines, but not that nuclear fuel 
was processed because the work is classified, the newspaper said. 
</P>
<P>
	``It is very worrying, especially after what has happened in  
Japan. We need to know what is happening,'' said Alison Jones, a 
mother of two from nearby Allenton. 
</P>
<P>
	Another resident, who declined to give his name, said: ``I think  
it's disgraceful. It is very worrying for people who live nearby.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The anti-nuclear organization Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament  
said it had been contacted by workers at the Rolls-Royce plant 
after last month's nuclear accident at a Japanese plant because 
they feared a similar foul-up. Sixty-nine people were exposed to 
radiation Sept. 30 at Tokaimura in Japan's worst-ever nuclear 
accident. 
</P>
<P>
	CND called Sunday for the plant to be closed down immediately.  
</P>
<P>
	A Defense Ministry spokesman confirmed late Saturday that the  
department delivers fuel to the civilian plant, where it is treated 
for use in nuclear submarine reactors. The plant is licensed by 
Britain's Nuclear Installations Inspectorate and has full 
processing approval, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	In March, a report by the inspectorate criticized the plant's  
safety procedures. But the plant subsequently changed its 
procedures and practiced the new ones, and government officials 
said they are now satisfied. 
</P>
<P>
	Defense Secretary Geoff Hoon rejected calls for the plant to be  
closed. 
</P>
<P>
	``Those concerns have been addressed by the Nuclear  
Installations Inspectorate and they've given the plant an entirely 
clean bill of health,'' he told SKY News. ``Those concerns have 
been thoroughly investigated.''

<HEADLINE> Australia Considers Republic Status </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MELBOURNE, Australia (AP) -- Australia's republicans launched  
their official campaign Sunday for the country to drop Britain's 
Queen Elizabeth II as head of state, warning that if voters don't 
do it now they won't get another chance for decades. 
</P>
<P>
	In a referendum scheduled for Nov. 6, some 11 million voters  
will decide whether they want the constitution changed to make 
Australia a republic with its own elected head of state. Australia, 
along with other Commonwealth countries such as Canada and Papua 
New Guinea, still recognizes Elizabeth II as the head of state. 
</P>
<P>
	Launching the ``yes'' campaign Sunday, Australian Republican  
Movement chairman Malcolm Turnbull said impetus for changing the 
constitution would be lost if the November referendum isn't passed. 
</P>
<P>
	``This referendum is the best chance in our lifetimes to have an  
Australian republic,'' Turnbull said. ``If it fails, the next 
republican proposal will take many years, maybe decades, to be 
formulated.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Attorney-general Daryl Williams said the constitutional changes  
would not alter Australia's system of government. 
</P>
<P>
	``We will continue to have a stable democracy under (the  
republican) model,'' Williams said. 
</P>
<P>
	But leading monarchists said changing Australia's head of state  
would create confusion overseas. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't really think we should be mucking about with our  
constitution at a time of very great instability in our own region 
and around the world,'' Foreign Minister Alexander Downer said 
Sunday at a separate, pro-monarchy function.

	N.C. Readies For Another Hurricane  
</P>
<P>
	WILMINGTON, N.C. (AP) -- A hurricane warning is in effect from  
Savannah, Ga., to Cape Hatteras, N.C. as Hurricane Irene continues 
to track toward North Carolina. Topsail Beach northeast of 
Wilmington was ordered evacuated this morning. Nearby Onslow Beach, 
under the Marine Corps' jurisdiction, was closed as well. Earlier 
this morning, the center of the storm was about 115 miles south of 
Charleston, S.C., moving north at 10 mph. Projections put the 
ragged eye of the storm near Cape Romain, just northeast of 
Charleston, by this afternoon.

	ISLAMABAD, Pakistan (AP) -- Nearly a week after overthrowing  
Pakistan's civilian government, coup leader Gen. Pervaiz Musharraf 
is to make a televised speech this evening to outline his plans for 
a transitional government. Musharraf canceled plans to make the 
speech yesterday. The top priority of this transitional government, 
said an army statement, will be ``economic revival'' in this poor 
nation of 140 million people, most of whom can neither read nor 
write. The average annual income in Pakistan is $800, according to 
U.N. figures.

	Gaza Strip Passage May be Delayed

<P>
	JERUSALEM (AP) -- The opening of a land link between the West  
Bank and Gaza Strip has been delayed for the second time in two 
weeks because of disagreements over how to operate it, Palestinian 
and Israeli officials said. The so-called safe passage was to have 
opened today, allowing Palestinians to move relatively freely for 
the first time between the two Palestinian areas, which lie on 
either side of Israel. But the Israelis and Palestinians were 
unable to agree yesterday on where in the Gaza Strip to place a 
joint office that would issue travel permits to Palestinians.

Weibang was visiting the wife of imprisoned activist Xu Wenli on 
Friday when police took him into custody, according to the Hong 
Kong-based Information Center of Human Rights and Democratic 
Movement in China. Sun's whereabouts are unknown and his family 
fear he will be sent back to prison, the Information Center said.

	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Of all the challenges the United States will  
face in the next century, by far the most important is building 
``one America out of this crazy quilt of all of us who live here,'' 
President Clinton told an Italian-American audience last night. 
Solve the problem of prejudice and group hatred, he said, ``and 
we'll find a way to deal with all the rest of our problems.'' 
Clinton addressed the 24th annual black-tie dinner of the National 
Italian American Foundation, the major Washington advocate for 
nearly 15 million Italian Americans, the nation's fifth largest 
ethnic group.

	HONG KONG (AP) -- A China Southern Airlines jet ran into strong  
turbulence and plunged 2,000 feet shortly before it landed in Hong 
Kong today, injuring 47 passengers, seven of them seriously. The 
seven include one American and one Japanese, said Dr. N. K. Leung, 
chief executive of the government-run Princess Margaret Hospital. 
The plane fell from 21,000 feet to 19,000 feet in about five to 10 
seconds. Some of the passengers were not wearing seat belts, and 
airport officials said there had been no prior announcement to put 
them on before the jolt.

African company boardrooms five years after the end of apartheid, 
according to a study released today. Blacks made up 12 percent of 
the directors of South African companies listed on the stock 
exchange, according to the Sunday Times of Johannesburg, which 
commissioned the private study. Even among black empowerment 
companies that were intended to redress racial imbalance in the 
control of wealth, only 37 percent of 260 directors in such 
organizations are black, the study said.

the Malaysian Grand Prix today and captured the Formula One 
drivers' title after the top two Ferraris were disqualified. 
Ferrari teammates Eddie Irvine and Michael Schumacher crossed the 
finish line first and second. But more than three hours after the 
race -- following their awards and interviews -- they were 
disqualified for technical violations. Ferrari appealed and a 
ruling is expected tomorrow at the Swiss headquarters of the 
International Automobile Federation. If Ferrari loses, Hakkinen 
wins the world title for the second straight year.

<HEADLINE> Albright: US Will Honor Nuke Treaty </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The United States will continue to honor a  
nuclear test ban treaty despite its rejection by the 
Republican-controlled Senate, Secretary of State Madeleine Albright 
said Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	A leader of anti-treaty senators warned the administration that  
if President Clinton again tries to have the Senate ratify the 
treaty, ``It will be defeated.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Appearing on CNN's ``Late Edition,'' Albright said Wednesday's  
51-48 Senate vote against the Comprehensive Test Ban treaty -- far 
below the 67 needed to ratify -- ``hurt us internationally'' and 
mystified her colleagues around the world. 
</P>
<P>
	``What we've lost for the time being is the real international  
leadership in terms of trying to make others live up to the CTBT,'' 
she said. 
</P>
<P>
	``But I want to assure all your viewers, around the world, that  
the United States is going to live up to the conditions of the 
treaty.'' 
</P>
<P>
	She noted that Clinton was the first world leader to sign the  
global treaty, which has been signed by 154 nations and ratified by 
51, including only 26 of the 44 countries potentially capable of 
producing nuclear weapons. 
</P>
<P>
	``The Republicans defeated a major landmark treaty that would  
really have helped generally in controlling nuclear weapons and our 
whole nonproliferation agenda,'' Albright said. 
</P>
<P>
	She did not say whether the administration would submit the pact  
for the Senate to reconsider its first treaty rejection since the 
League of Nations treaty in 1920. 
</P>
<P>
	John Podesta, the White House chief of staff, said, ``The treaty  
remains before the Senate.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The administration, he said on ABC's ``This Week,'' will  
``continue to press the Senate to consider it and to respond to the 
arguments that have been made.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Two leaders of the treaty opponents, Sens. Jon Kyl, R-Ariz., and  
James Inhofe, R-Okla., gave no indication such an appeal might 
succeed. 
</P>
<P>
	``It will not come up again, because the United States cannot  
unilaterally amend the treaty,'' Kyl said on ABC. ``It will not 
come up again, and if it does, it will be defeated.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Inhofe suggested that Clinton's problem was that he failed to  
inform the Senate of his plans before he signed the treaty in 1996. 
That way, Inhofe said, the Senate would have made clear it never 
would have given its advice and consent required under the 
Constitution for a treaty's ratification. 
</P>
<P>
	``What the president should have done,'' Inhofe said, ``is come  
to the Senate first and say, `This is what we want to do. ... Do 
you think that this is going be consented to by the Senate, if we 
do promulgate this?''' 
</P>
<P>
	Because of the treaty's flaws, Inhofe said, the answer would  
have been no.

<HEADLINE> What's Next for Wall Street? </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Stocks swooned last week under an unusual  
barrage of bad news. Market watchers are divided on whether stocks 
can rebound in the week to come, as expectations of good news about 
corporate profits and potentially bad news about inflation battle 
for investors' attention. 
</P>
<P>
	Last week, bad news won out, driving the Dow Jones industrial  
average down 630.05 points, or 5.9 percent, to close at 10,019.71. 
It was the Dow's worst week ever in terms of points lost, and the 
worst of the decade in terms of percentages. 
</P>
<P>
	Market analysts aren't sure whether the decline has laid ground  
for a further selloff, or opened the door to bargain-hunting 
investors who could once again propel stocks higher. 
</P>
<P>
	``We may have reached an oversold condition that will bring  
buyers back in,'' said Eugene E. Peroni, director of equity 
research at John Nuveen &AMP; Co. ``And that could set the stage for a 
better and more sustainable move later on.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Other analysts say stocks could be in for another rough week as  
last week's main menace -- the fear that signs of inflation will 
prompt the Federal Reserve to raise interest rates for the third 
time this year -- remains unresolved. 
</P>
<P>
	The Fed left rates unchanged at its last meeting, but hinted  
that it would boost rates if inflation appears to be escalating. 
That set a stage for fitful trading as investors watch carefully 
for any nascent signs of price pressures, analysts said. 
</P>
<P>
	That proved true on Friday, when a sharper-than-expected  
increase in the Producer Price Index sparked selling on Wall 
Street. 
</P>
<P>
	``The market can handle higher rates, but it cannot handle  
uncertainty,'' said Peter Canelo, U.S. investment strategist at 
Morgan Stanley Dean Witter. ``By failing to raise rates, the Fed 
opted to extend this torture for another month,'' until its 
policy-making group holds its next meeting Nov. 16. 
</P>
<P>
	The next major barometer of inflation will be the Consumer Price  
Index, due out from the Labor Department on Tuesday. If it shows 
that prices are on the rise, stocks could be in for another fall, 
analysts said. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, most market watchers continue to hope buyers will step  
back in if the next round of corporate profit reports is as strong 
as expected. Companies are expected to benefit from robust economic 
growth. Earnings should look especially good in comparison to the 
third quarter of 1998, when most businesses struggled with the 
fallout from Asia's financial crisis. 
</P>
<P>
	Last week, strong reports from companies like Apple and Boeing  
were outweighed by disappointments from Intel and Raytheon. In the 
coming week, industry leaders like Citigroup, Ford, Microsoft and 
IBM will compete for investors' attention as they divulge their 
earnings results. 
</P>
<P>
	Of course, strong earnings may not be enough to lift investors'  
spirits if the market's decline has eroded the optimism that has 
characterized the stock market for nearly 10 years, analysts said. 
</P>
<P>
	``Throughout this bull market, people have proven willing to buy  
on the market's dips,'' said Michael Metz, portfolio manager at 
CIBC Oppenheimer. ``If people become less willing to do that, it 
would be troubling.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Noting that some of the market's worst performances in history  
have come on the Monday following a Friday selloff, some analysts 
suggested that investors may have used the weekend to solidify 
their plans to get out of the market. 
</P>
<P>
	``While stocks may experience a short-lived bounce to start on  
Monday, investors will likely be overtaken by fears that compounded 
over the weekend,'' said Brian G. Belski, chief investment 
strategist at George K. Baum &AMP; Co. in Kansas City, Mo. 
</P>
<P>
	But by the same token, stocks may also benefit if investors  
return from the weekend with a sense of calm about the market's 
fundamental strength, analysts said. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's some cynicism and skittishness out there, but we have  
not sensed panic in the streets,'' said Jim Weiss, deputy chief 
investment officer for equities at State Street Research and 
Management Co. in Boston. ``I expect to see some buying on a 
selective basis.''

<P>
	PASADENA, Calif. (AP) -- Greg Vanney and Cobi Jones scored  
second-half goals Sunday as the Los Angeles Galaxy, who played a 
man down for 72 minutes, beat the Colorado Rapids 3-0 in the 
opening game of the best-of-3 MLS Western Conference semifinals. 
</P>
<P>
	Los Angeles was forced to play with just 10 players after  
midfielder Simon Elliott was ejected after receiving his second 
yellow card. His cleats hit Colorado defender Marcelo Balboa's 
thigh during an attempted tackle. 
</P>
<P>
	Elliott, who received his first yellow card from referee Marcel  
Yonan in the sixth minute for fouling defender David Vaudreuil from 
behind, will also be suspended for Game 2 under league rules. 
</P>
<P>
	Ezra Hendrickson scored in the eighth minute and Vanney made it  
2-0 with a penalty-kick goal in the 52nd minute. The Galaxy were 
awarded the penalty kick after Rapids defender Chris Martinez 
pulled down midfielder Mauricio Cienfuegos by the jersey in the 
penalty area. 
</P>
<P>
	Jones scored in the 57th minute, tapping in a loose ball after  
goalkeeper Ian Feuer deflected Clint Mathis' cross but the Rapids 
were unable to clear the ball away. 
</P>
<P>
	Kevin Hartman made seven saves for the shutout as Colorado's  
offensive woes continued. The Rapids were shut out in their final 
five regular season matches and were held scoreless for 499 
consecutive minutes, an MLS record. 
</P>
<P>
	Colorado led 14-12 in shots and 8-6 in shots on goal. Feuer made  
three saves before a Rose Bowl crowd announced at 16,307. 
</P>
<P>
	Game 2 will be played Sunday in Denver. A third game, if  
necessary, would be played Oct. 27 at the Rose Bowl.

<HEADLINE> Poland Highlights Chopin's Music </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WARSAW, Poland (AP) -- Playing his uniquely melodic music and  
celebrating Mass at the cathedral where his heart is kept, Poland 
and the world on Sunday marked 150 years since the death of 
composer Frederic Chopin. 
</P>
<P>
	The events were the highlight of the worldwide Chopin year,  
declared in 1999 by Polish musical and cultural officials, to mark 
the death anniversary of Poland's greatest composer and one of 
world's leading piano music authors. 
</P>
<P>
	Chopin was born in 1810 in Zelazowa Wola, some 37 miles west of  
Warsaw, to a Polish mother and French father. In search of the best 
piano teachers and larger audiences, Chopin left Poland at the age 
of 20 and traveled to Vienna and then to Paris, where he settled in 
1831 and died Oct. 19, 1849 at the age of 39. 
</P>
<P>
	``Chopin's music is the most valuable thing that Poland can  
offer to the uniting Europe,'' President Aleksander Kwasniewski 
said before a concert in Zelazowa Wola by Polish pianist Halina 
Czerny-Stefanska. 
</P>
<P>
	For Poles it is ``a sign of national identity, at the same time  
its universal artistic value and beauty belong to the whole 
world,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Earlier, Kwasniewski laid flowers at a Chopin monument in  
Warsaw's picturesque Lazienki park, where outdoor concerts of the 
composer's music are held every summer. 
</P>
<P>
	A Mass was celebrated in the Holy Cross church in Warsaw where  
Chopin's heart is deposited. The composer was buried at the Pere 
Lachaise cemetery in Paris, but according to his will, his heart 
was brought to Warsaw. 
</P>
<P>
	In Paris, Polish pianist Krystian Zimerman was to give a concert  
at the Salle Pleyel, where Chopin used to play.

<HEADLINE> Man Spreads Hope With a Guitar </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BRANSON, Mo. (AP) -- It was, quite literally, the kiss seen  
'round the world when Pope John Paul II darted into an audience of 
thousands to brush the cheek of a man who had just played a 
hauntingly beautiful song on the guitar. 
</P>
<P>
	``You are a courageous young man,'' the pontiff told Tony  
Melendez on that day in Los Angeles in 1987. ``And my wish for you 
is to bring hope to all the people.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Years before, Melendez had tried to become a Catholic priest but  
the church had rejected him, saying one must have a thumb and index 
finger to perform the Eucharist. 
</P>
<P>
	``It hurt,'' he says now. ``But I found out real quickly that  
through my music I could get into ministering. I could minister in 
the streets, in the prisons, in the hospitals, in the schools.'' 
</P>
<P>
	So that's what the young musician from Chino, Calif., set off to  
do. Spread hope, through his voice and the six-string acoustic 
guitar he plays with his feet. 
</P>
<P>
	``People still remember it,'' says Melendez, who was born  
without arms after his mother took the prescribed drug Thalidomide 
during pregnancy. ``I'm amazed. It's what -- almost 12 years later 
now? And people still ask me about it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	They will ask him again this day, when he chats with fans and  
signs autographs after a two-hour show at Branson's Remington 
Theatre. 
</P>
<P>
	After 12 years on the road, Melendez, 37, decided it was time to  
slow down a bit. And when an offer for his own morning show at one 
of Branson's dozens of music theaters came along this year, he 
seized it. 
</P>
<P>
	Jose, the musician's manager and older brother, says Tony  
considered coming home after his son took his first steps. ``It 
doesn't matter how much your wife tells you about it on the phone, 
if you're not there, it's just not the same.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Though Melendez may stop traveling, he won't stop trying to  
fulfill the pope's wish. 
</P>
<P>
	His show, five mornings a week, is called ``A Gift of Hope.''  
And he makes it clear during the fast-paced two hours that he's 
delighted to be alive, to be happily married and the father of two 
small children; to be a guy who has learned to do just about 
anything with his feet, including waving goodbye when the curtain 
comes down. 
</P>
<P>
	He's upbeat off-stage, too. In the past 12 years he has married  
and fathered two children, a daughter, now 5, and a son, now 2. 
He's also published an autobiography, released five albums and 
performed in 20 countries. 
</P>
<P>
	His hair is still full, his face unlined and his beard unshaded  
by gray. ``Let's get some light on in here,'' he says, flipping a 
switch with his shoulder as he sits in his dressing room to talk 
</P>
<P>
	Melendez considers himself lucky. ``Since I never had the arms,  
you couldn't tell me I couldn't do it without them,'' he says. ``I 
write. I drive. I can even diaper my 2-year-old, and that's tough 
when he's squirming around. That's tough, even for a person with 
hands. 
</P>
<P>
	``The toes are pretty much my fingers. They're not quite as long  
as fingers, but you can do a lot with them.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Melendez was born in Nicaragua but a year later moved with his  
family to the United States when doctors told his parents he would 
get better medical care here. 
</P>
<P>
	His father, who built big-rig trailers for a living, played the  
guitar some, and he would put it on the floor at home so his son 
could fool around. But it wasn't until he was 16, Melendez recalls, 
that he got serious about the instrument. By 25, he was making his 
living as a musician. 
</P>
<P>
	He performed at churches around Southern California and  
sometimes played for spare change at the beach. Then, the Catholic 
Archdiocese of Los Angeles invited him to a meeting in 1987. ``It 
turned out it was an audition,'' he says. ``I had no idea. Luckily, 
I had brought the guitar.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Church officials were looking for a suitable gift for the pope  
from the Catholic youth of Los Angeles, and they thought a 
performance by Melendez might be it. ``Like at a lot of 
auditions,'' Melendez says with a laugh now, ``they said, `Don't 
call us, we'll call you.''' 
</P>
<P>
	They called, and that September he was seated on a platform in  
the audience of the Universal Amphitheater as he played a song 
called ``Never Be the Same.'' 
</P>
<P>
	To the surprise of everyone, most notably the security guards, a  
visibly moved John Paul II jumped off the stage, rushed through the 
audience and embraced Melendez. That moment turned the young 
guitarist's life in a new direction. 
</P>
<P>
	An unabashed fan of folk-rocker Dan Fogelberg and groups like  
the Doobie Brothers when he was younger, Melendez now offers a 
broad-based show that mixes spiritual and contemporary music with 
songs he heard in Spanish as a child. 
</P>
<P>
	Backed by a four-piece rock band, he's as comfortable doing ``La  
Bamba'' and the Doobies' ``Takin' It to the Streets'' as ``Hands in 
Heaven.'' And he's still ministering. 
</P>
<P>
	``I love life. I enjoy life. And I think they see that,'' he  
says en route to greet his audience. ``And I think it encourages 
those that have maybe had a tough road. They think, `If he can make 
it, I can too.'''

<HEADLINE> Karl Malone To Miss Four More Games </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SALT LAKE CITY (AP) -- Utah Jazz forward Karl Malone is expected  
to miss the next four preseason games due to a lower back strain. 
</P>
<P>
	The 36-year-old Malone will miss Monday's exhibition game at the  
Delta Center against the New York Knicks, and is not expected to 
make this week's trip to Nashville, Indianapolis and Lexington, Ky. 
The Jazz have two games against the Boston Celtics and one against 
the Indiana Pacers. 
</P>
<P>
	Malone's status for the final two preseason games against the  
Pacers in Salt Lake City and against the Los Angeles Lkers in 
Anaheim, has not been determined. 
</P>
<P>
	Utah is scheduled to open the season on Nov. 2 against the  
Lakers. 
</P>
<P>
	``Karl is in real good shape; he always is,'' said coach Jerry  
Sloan. ``But he'll need to play some basketball. I don't think 
there's any question about that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Malone, who signed a four-year, $67 million contract during the  
offseason, first felt his back tighten almost two weeks ago.

<HEADLINE> Smuggler Awaits Federal Execution </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TERRE HAUTE, Ind. (AP) -- A marijuana smuggler sentenced to die  
for the murders of three men who betrayed him stands to become the 
first person executed by the federal government since 1963. 
</P>
<P>
	Juan Raul Garza also is first in line to die by injection at the  
new federal death house outside Terre Haute. He's one of 20 men, 
including Oklahoma City bomber Timothy McVeigh, awaiting federal 
execution at the U.S. prison here. 
</P>
<P>
	In July, Garza filed his final possible appeal, a step none of  
the other prisoners has yet taken. The Supreme Court is expected to 
consider the appeal within the next month. 
</P>
<P>
	If the high court rejects his pleas and President Clinton grants  
no clemency, he could be executed soon after. The last federal 
execution was 36 years ago, when Victor Feguer was hanged in Iowa 
for kidnapping and killing a doctor. 
</P>
<P>
	Garza, 42, declined to be interviewed. But in a 1994 interview  
with The Associated Press, the native of Brownsville, Texas, 
proclaimed his innocence. 
</P>
<P>
	``I didn't kill any of those people,'' he said, then the lone  
federal inmate on death row in Huntsville. ``I'm not responsible.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Garza was convicted under a 1988 federal drug-kingpin law, which  
imposes a death sentence for murder resulting from large-scale 
illegal drug dealing. 
</P>
<P>
	But he insisted in the interview that he was no tycoon.  
Authorities, Garza then said, ``never found a red cent. They even 
went into my backyard with backhoes. They were under the impression 
I had money.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Gregory Wiercioch, Garza's appeals lawyer at the Texas Defender  
Service in Houston, declined to talk about the case before the 
Supreme Court acts. 
</P>
<P>
	In his appeal, Garza argues that prosecutors at his sentencing  
improperly linked him to four unsolved murders in Mexico using 
testimony from accomplices who were promised lighter sentences. His 
right to due process also was violated, he says, because it was 
hard to defend against foreign unsolved crimes. 
</P>
<P>
	An intense, muscular man, Garza came from a family of farm  
workers. He was picking fruit by age 5 and never finished high 
school, said his defense attorney, Philip Hilder. As an adult, he 
was a railroad brakeman and built houses. His second wife is a 
preacher's daughter, and her family spoke well of Garza before he 
was sentenced. 
</P>
<P>
	The criminal case against Garza told another story -- and caused  
a sensation in Brownsville, a city bordering Mexico that is so 
popular with smugglers it's called ``Marijuana Boulevard.'' 
</P>
<P>
	At his 1993 federal trial, prosecutors portrayed Garza as a  
vicious drug boss who controlled underlings by killing those -- even 
a son-in-law -- who got out of line. The prosecution's 66 witnesses 
included one of Garza's nephews. 
</P>
<P>
	In closing arguments, Hilder called his client ``less than an  
angel'' but no drug baron. After all, he said, Garza lived in a 
mobile home on two acres. Hilder also protested against testimony 
``bought and paid for.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But Assistant U.S. Attorney Jose Angel Moreno called Garza a  
drug lord who ``thought he was so far above the law that killing 
was just a matter of business.'' He praised witnesses who risked 
their lives to come forward. 
</P>
<P>
	Garza was convicted of ordering two men killed in 1990 and  
personally murdering a third in 1991, all in Brownsville. He also 
was convicted of money-laundering and running a marijuana pipeline 
that, from 1982 to 1992, brought tons of pot from Mexico for 
shipment to Louisiana and Michigan. 
</P>
<P>
	The mix of charges enabled prosecutors to apply the federal  
Anti-Drug Abuse Act. Garza could be the first to die under this 
drug-kingpin law. 
</P>
<P>
	The U.S. government has used the death penalty far less than  
states have. In 1972, the Supreme Court struck down state death 
penalty laws as arbitrary and capricious. That, in effect, 
eliminated similar federal statutes. 
</P>
<P>
	Laws were rewritten and, since 1976, the death penalty has been  
reinstated in 38 states. But Congress didn't enact a new federal 
death penalty until the 1988 Anti-Drug Abuse Act. It was extended 
in 1994 to more than 60 crimes, among them sexual abuse, murder for 
hire, car-jackings, fatal drive-by shootings, and using a weapon of 
mass destruction. 
</P>
<P>
	Until this year, there was no federal death house. In the past,  
anyone sentenced to die under federal law was imprisoned and put to 
death in the state where the trial was held. This summer, the 
federal Bureau of Prisons opened a 50-cell unit for the condemned 
in its vast red-brick penitentiary 5 miles from downtown Terre 
Haute. Garza and others then were moved there. 
</P>
<P>
	The death chamber is in a small, square brick building behind  
death row, surrounded by a chain-link fence about 12 feet high and 
topped with razor wire. 
</P>
<P>
	The government offers a ``tour'' on videotape, with images of an  
upholstered piece of furniture that, except for the black straps, 
resembles a dentist's chair. 
</P>
<P>
	The last president to sign a death warrant was John F. Kennedy,  
said Rory Little, a former federal prosecutor and an expert on the 
U.S. death penalty. 
</P>
<P>
	Since the death penalty was reinstated in 1976, 579 people have  
been executed by states. More than 3,500 men and women await 
execution. 
</P>
<P>
	``Now the federal government is going to be involved,'' said  
Little, who teaches at Hastings College of the Law in San 
Francisco. ``They're not going to be on the sideline.'' 
</P>
<P>
	When Garza was interviewed in Texas five years ago, the prospect  
of execution seemed distant. He had appeals in the works. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm not afraid,'' he said. ``You've just got to go along.''

<HEADLINE> 3 Films Battle for Box Office Title / Box Office  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- ``Double Jeopardy'' held onto first place at  
the weekend box office by a dangling thread -- although two 
newcomers could end up on top when final weekend numbers are 
released. 
</P>
<P>
	``Double Jeopardy'' took in $10.5 million over the weekend,  
according to industry estimates released Sunday. Final figures were 
to be available today. 
</P>
<P>
	``The Story of Us,'' Rob Reiner's romantic comedy starring  
Michelle Pfeiffer and Bruce Willis, debuted with $10.4 million, and 
the ultra-violent ``Fight Club,'' with Brad Pitt and Edward Norton, 
opened with $10.3 million. 
</P>
<P>
	The preliminary figures were based on box office receipts  
studios gather from theaters for Friday and Saturday, plus 
projections for Sunday ticket sales. 
</P>
<P>
	``These are estimates,'' said Tom Sherak, head of distribution  
for 20th Century Fox, which released ``Fight Club.'' ``You can't 
project how many people are going to the movies until they go.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Robert Bucksbaum of box-office tracker Reel Source Inc., which  
does its own projections based on surveys of theater chains, said 
he thinks ``Fight Club'' will come out on top when final numbers 
are reported. ``Story of Us'' probably will come in second and 
``Double Jeopardy'' third, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	``It means so much that a studio can promote a movie as No. 1,''  
Bucksbaum said. ``You can promote that for the next week, and it 
does make a difference at the box office.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Story of Us'' might wind up as No. 1 because it plays well to  
older women, who were more likely to hit theaters on Sunday, said 
Nikki Rocco, head of distribution for Universal, which released the 
movie. 
</P>
<P>
	Wayne Lewellen, distribution president for Paramount, said the  
studio's Sunday estimates for ``Double Jeopardy'' were based on the 
film's box-office pattern over the last three weekends. 
</P>
<P>
	``We've been in the market long enough to predict our grosses,''  
Lewellen said. ``Certainly, it's a projection at this point.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In ``Fight Club,'' Pitt and Norton lead a band of dissatisfied  
men who gather in bloody male bonding sessions to pummel one 
another in barefisted brawls. Their violence eventually expands 
beyond fistfights. 
</P>
<P>
	``Double Jeopardy,'' starring Ashley Judd and Tommy Lee Jones,  
tells the story of a woman bent on revenge against her husband, who 
faked his death and framed her for murder. 
</P>
<P>
	Whether No. 1 or not, the film has grossed $80.6 million in 24  
days. 
</P>
<P>
	``'Double Jeopardy' does continue to roll along,'' said Paul  
Dergarabedian, president of Exhibitor Relations, which tracks movie 
ticket sales. ``That genre of a revenge-seeking woman has really 
caught on in a big way.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The ghost story ``The Sixth Sense'' edged near the  
quarter-billion-dollar mark in its 11-week run. ``Sixth Sense'' 
took in $5.2 million to raise its total gross to $249.9 million. 
</P>
<P>
	Estimated ticket sales for Friday through Sunday at North  
American theaters, according to Exhibitor Relations. Final figures 
were to be released today. 
</P>
<P>
	1. ``Double Jeopardy,'' $10.5 million.  
</P>
<P>
	2. ``The Story of Us,'' $10.4 million.  
</P>
<P>
	3. ``Fight Club,'' $10.3 million.  
</P>
<P>
	4. ``Three Kings,'' $7.3 million.  
</P>
<P>
	5. ``American Beauty,'' $6.8 million.  
</P>
<P>
	6. ``Random Hearts,'' $5.8 million.  
</P>
<P>
	7. ``Superstar,'' $5.7 million.  
</P>
<P>
	8. ``The Sixth Sense,'' $5.2 million.  
</P>
<P>
	9. ``Blue Streak,'' $3.8 million.  
</P>
<P>
	10. ``The Omega Code, $2.4 million.

<HEADLINE>  47 Injured on Hong Kong-Bound Jet </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HONG KONG (AP) -- A China Southern Airlines jet ran into strong  
turbulence and plunged 2,000 feet shortly before it landed in Hong 
Kong on Sunday. Forty-seven passengers were injured, seven of them 
seriously. 
</P>
<P>
	Eight people remained hospitalized late Sunday. The seven who  
were seriously hurt included one American and one Japanese, said 
Dr. N. K. Leung, chief executive of the government-run Princess 
Margaret Hospital. 
</P>
<P>
	The plane fell from 21,000 feet to 19,000 feet in about five to  
10 seconds, said Wang Guixiang, president and director of China's 
National Civil Aviation Corporation. 
</P>
<P>
	Some of the passengers were not wearing seat belts, and airport  
officials said there had been no prior announcement to put them on 
before the jolt. 
</P>
<P>
	Steve Au-yeung, a Hong Kong tour guide, said there was no  
warning from the crew before the plane suddenly plunged. Then there 
was an announcement by a crew member asking if there were any 
doctors aboard, he recalled. 
</P>
<P>
	``I saw about 10 people in front of me who flew off their seats  
and hit the roof of the cabin,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Ambulances rushed the injured to three hospitals after the  
Boeing 757, with 160 passengers aboard, arrived at Chek Lap Kok 
airport from the southern Chinese city of Kunming, authorities 
said. About 10 people had to be carried off the plane on 
stretchers. 
</P>
<P>
	Rescue efforts were delayed because the pilot failed to inform  
air traffic controllers of the incident, said Alex Au, Hong Kong's 
acting director of civil aviation. And even after he landed the 
plane, the pilot informed only his company, which later relayed the 
message to airport authorities, Au said. 
</P>
<P>
	Medical teams who arrived at the scene were surprised to find  
that dozens were injured after the pilot, whose name was not 
disclosed, had said only six were hurt, said airport fire officer 
Lau Chi-ho. 
</P>
<P>
	Southern Airlines officials were not immediately available for  
comment. 
</P>
<P>
	In August, three people were killed when an MD-11 jet belonging  
to Taiwan's China Airlines crashed while landing in a storm at the 
airport.

<HEADLINE> Few Blacks in S. African Boardrooms </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	JOHANNESBURG, South Africa (AP) -- Whites still dominate South  
African company boardrooms five years after the end of apartheid, 
according to a study released Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	Blacks made up 12 percent of the directors of South African  
companies listed on the stock exchange, according to the Sunday 
Times of Johannesburg, which commissioned the private study. 
</P>
<P>
	Even among black empowerment companies that were intended to  
redress racial imbalance in the control of wealth, only 37 percent 
of 260 directors in such organizations are black, the study said. 
</P>
<P>
	Twenty-one of the 600 companies listed on the Johannesburg Stock  
Exchange have black chief executives. 
</P>
<P>
	Women have a lower profile, holding only 5 percent of  
directorships of listed companies. 
</P>
<P>
	Earlier this year, one of the largest black-managed companies on  
the exchange, New Africa Investments Ltd., was rocked by the 
resignation of two high-profile proponents of encouraging black 
entrepreneurship.

<HEADLINE> Quake Puts Calif. Town on Map </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LUDLOW, Calif. (AP) -- The T-shirt hanging in a service station  
in this remote Southern California desert town blares ``Welcome to 
Ludlow -- Famous for Absolutely Nothing.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Not anymore.  
</P>
<P>
	A day after a magnitude-7.0 earthquake rocked California and the  
Southwest, Ludlow is now known as the place where an Amtrak train 
derailed, an interstate overpass cracked and every structure in 
town was damaged. 
</P>
<P>
	``Guess we'll have to get new shirts,'' joked John Knoll, who,  
along with his brother, owns the entire town -- three houses, 22 
mobile homes and six businesses. 
</P>
<P>
	There were only a handful of injuries from the quake and no  
deaths reported. The second huge earthquake in the region in seven 
years struck at 2:46 a.m. Saturday, and was centered just a few 
miles east of town. Seismologists say hundreds of aftershocks have 
occurred, including shakers of 5.8, 5.3 and 5.0 magnitude. 
</P>
<P>
	As aftershocks continued to toss the California desert Sunday,  
and communities assessed damage, the people of this one-stop town 
between Barstow and Needles began picking up the pieces of their 
lives, most of which was shaken to the floor. 
</P>
<P>
	Armed with a sense of humor, brooms and buckets, the population  
of Ludlow -- 50 people strong -- swept away broken glass, cleaned up 
broken dishes and remarked at the strange way some things were 
damaged while others remained untouched. 
</P>
<P>
	With every home knocked off its foundation, the town's only  
residential community -- the Ludlow Mobile Home Park -- sat at a 
tilt. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was always kind of tilted. Now you can just see it,'' said  
Scott Able, 35, as he hauled garbage bags filled with debris from 
one home. 
</P>
<P>
	Inside another, a woman found a long-forgotten gift given to her  
as a joke when she moved in -- California Earthquake in a Can. The 
soup can-shaped device has a mechanism inside that trembles when 
the can is touched. 
</P>
<P>
	``Who needs that after the real thing?'' said 52-year-old Patsy  
Cheney, who works as a waitress at the Ludlow Coffee Shop. 
</P>
<P>
	The restaurant served toast and ham for breakfast Sunday even  
though most of the dishes were broken in the quake. Coffee shop 
employees furiously washed the remaining 56 dishes on a continual 
basis in order to serve customers. 
</P>
<P>
	While electricity and water lines remained out to homes, the  
10-room Ludlow Motel provided temporary housing to residents who 
split shifts in the 24-hour town, which exists solely as a stop for 
motorists on Interstate 40. 
</P>
<P>
	Many Ludlow residents agree -- it's a place where the work ethic  
is strong and sense of community is stronger. 
</P>
<P>
	``Without the businesses we have no reason to be here,'' said  
Levi Falice, who doubles as a gas station clerk and worker at the 
Ludlow Truck Tire Repair Shop. 
</P>
<P>
	``As long as the businesses are going, we get paid,'' he said.  
</P>
<P>
	Founded in 1882 by the Ludlow Mining Co., the town along the  
Santa Fe Trail was home to a booming mineral and silver mine.

	When Route 66 was built through the town in the 1920s, Ludlow  
became a stopping-off point along the side of the 2,448-mile 
``mother road'' between Chicago and Los Angeles. Knoll and his 
family purchased the town in 1978, and it is now valued at nearly 
$7 million.

<HEADLINE> Piazza Leaves Game 5 With Injury </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- New York Mets catcher Mike Piazza was forced to  
leave Sunday's Game 5 of the National League Championship Series 
against the Atlanta Braves in the 14th inning with a strained left 
forearm. 
</P>
<P>
	Piazza apparently was injured on a play at the plate in the 13th  
inning, when he tagged out Keith Lockhart trying to score from 
first on a double by Chipper Jones. 
</P>
<P>
	It was the final out of the inning. In the bottom half of the  
inning, Piazza struck out and then left the game, replaced by Todd 
Pratt. 
</P>
<P>
	Piazza missed the last two games of the division series against  
Arizona with a spained and swollen left thumb. Then, in Game 3 of 
the NLCS, he sustained a mild concussion in a collision as he 
tagged out Bret Boone, who trying to score. 
</P>
<P>
	Pratt replaced Piazza in the two games against the Diamondbacks  
and he won the deciding Game 4 with a 10th-inning home run.

<HEADLINE> N.H. Gov. Delays Gore Endorsement </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CONCORD, N.H. (AP) -- Vice President Al Gore is putting off a  
trip to New Hampshire to give the state's governor time to deal 
with an education funding crisis. 
</P>
<P>
	Gov. Jeanne Shaheen had planned to formally endorse Gore for the  
Democratic presidential nomination Monday, but said Sunday night 
that the state's education problem needed her full attention. 
</P>
<P>
	The state Supreme Court ruled Friday that a statewide property  
tax enacted to help fund education is unconstitutional, leaving the 
state with the obligation of paying $825 million toward local 
school costs. 
</P>
<P>
	Gore campaign official Toby Chaudhuri said the vice president  
was postponing his visit. 
</P>
<P>
	Shaheen, in a statement, said, ``Al Gore has my strongest  
support and I look forward to holding an official endorsement event 
with him in the future, and campaigning hard for him during the 
next few months.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The endorsement has been widely expected. Shaheen's husband,  
William Shaheen, is director of Gore's New Hampshire campaign.

<HEADLINE> NFL Injury Report </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	It was a rough day for NFL quarterbacks. Fortunately for Dan  
Marino, Mark Brunell and Charlie Batch, they had worthy backups to 
lead their teams to victory. 
</P>
<P>
	Marino became the first quarterback in NFL history to pass for  
60,000 yards with his only completion, then left because of a 
shoulder injury after two series against the New England Patriots 
on Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	Marino, who complained of an injured right shoulder during the  
week, completed his first pass for 8 yards to run his career total 
to 60,001. 
</P>
<P>
	But on his second throw he fumbled, and Patriots linebacker Andy  
Katzenmoyer returned it 57 yards for a touchdown. On the next 
series, Marino tried a short pass that fell well short of the 
intended receiver. 
</P>
<P>
	``I thought I might be able to start,'' said Marino, who will  
have an MRI on Monday. ``But when I warmed up, I was throwing 
changeups. Usually I throw fastballs.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Damon Huard entered on the third series, and his first pass was  
intercepted for a TD by New England's Ty Law, who returned the ball 
27 yards for a TD. But Huard went on to lead the Dolphins to a 
31-30 win. 
</P>
<P>
	Brunell left Jacksonville's 24-7 victory over Cleveland in the  
third quarter with bruised ribs. 
</P>
<P>
	Coach Tom Coughlin said Brunell took the first blow to the ribs  
sometime in the first half, then was knocked out of the game when 
he strained the ribs making a long throw down the sideline to start 
the third quarter. 
</P>
<P>
	Brunell returned to the sideline and threw for a brief period,  
but Coughlin said there was no way the quarterback would return to 
the game. 
</P>
<P>
	``He had difficulty twisting and turning and throwing the  
ball,'' Coughlin said. ``So we made the decision not to put him 
in.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Backup Jay Fiedler led three scoring drives and finished  
12-for-14 for 113 yards and one touchdown for the Jags. 
</P>
<P>
	Batch bruised his right arm and did not return for the start of  
second half of the Lions' game with the Minnesota Vikings. 
</P>
<P>
	Gus Frerotte started the second half with Detroit leading 19-0,  
and the Vikings rallied to take the lead, but the Lions won 25-23 
on Jason Hanson's sixth field goal, a 48-yarder with 7 seconds 
left. 
</P>
<P>
	Frerotte completed five straight passes on the game-winning  
drive. 
</P>
<P>
	Arizona QB Jake Plummer left Sunday night's game against the  
Washington Redskins early in the third quarter when he broke the 
ring finger on his right hand. 
</P>
<P>
	Plummer, knocked out of a game for the second time in as many  
weeks, was sacked by linebacker Shawn Barber early in the third 
quarter. 
</P>
<P>
	Plummer's finger became stuck in Barber's facemask on the hit.  
He went to the locker room for X-rays and came back with his hand 
wrapped. 
</P>
<P>
	Plummer, who threw two interceptions, including one by Champ  
Bailey for a touchdown, already was bothered by a hip pointer that 
sidelined him for much of last week's 14-3 victory over the New 
York Giants. Plummer missed most of the preseason with a sprained 
right thumb. 
</P>
<P>
	New York Jets quarterback Ray Lucas, a replacement for  
ineffective starter Rick Mirer, sprained his left ankle when he was 
sacked on the final play of a 16-13 loss to Indianapolis. 
</P>
<P>
	Eric Moulds, Buffalo's leading receiver, injured his hamstring  
with about 7 minutes left in a 20-14 loss to Oakland and will be 
out 3-4 weeks. 
</P>
<P>
	Three prominent players were injured in Pittsburgh's 17-3  
victory over Cincinnati. 
</P>
<P>
	The Bengals' Corey Dillon missed much of the first half with a  
twisted ankle and was held to 78 yards rushing. Darnay Scott left 
with bruised ribs after his first catch. 
</P>
<P>
	For the Steelers, Pro Bowl center Dermontti Dawson was lost to a  
pulled hamstring on their third possession. Dawson said he's been 
bothered by the injury for two weeks.

<HEADLINE> Britain Says It Will Win Beef Fight </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LONDON (AP) -- Foreign Secretary Robin Cook insisted Sunday that  
France ``cannot sustain'' its refusal to allow British beef into 
the country in defiance of the European Union and predicted Britain 
would win the day if the dispute goes to court. 
</P>
<P>
	The 15-nation EU ruled in August that beef from Britain was safe  
again for international sale after the scare over the illness 
commonly known as ``mad cow disease.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But on Oct. 1 France said it would continue to ban the imports,  
based on a recommendation from the French food safety committee. 
French Prime Minister Lionel Jospin said Saturday that France would 
lift the ban only if its own scientific evidence proves it no 
longer poses health risks. 
</P>
<P>
	``They are in the wrong. They cannot sustain this position,''  
Cook told the British Broadcasting Corp. ``Ultimately if it goes to 
court they will lose.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``The sooner they recognize this and the sooner they accept the  
binding agreement (on European Union members), the better,'' he 
said, adding that the French report produced no new scientific 
evidence. 
</P>
<P>
	``The decision of the European committee on this is expected in  
less than a couple of weeks and after that we expect the Commission 
to take action,'' Cook said. 
</P>
<P>
	The European Commission is the watchdog of the EU treaty which  
bans unfair trade practices. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, in Paris, French Agriculture Minister Jean Glavany  
was quoted in Le Parisien newspaper Sunday defending France's 
position. 
</P>
<P>
	``(The EU) gave us an ultimatum two weeks ago to lift the  
embargo by Oct. 7. Then until Oct. 14, and then, until Oct. 25 at 
the earliest. They understood that the scientists needed to 
speak,'' he said. ``The French have been heard ... It seems that no 
scientist could risk saying that there is absolutely no danger in 
eating British beef.''

<HEADLINE> Albright: US Will Honor Nuke Treaty </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The United States will continue to honor a  
nuclear test ban treaty despite its rejection by the 
Republican-controlled Senate, Secretary of State Madeleine Albright 
said Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	A leader of anti-treaty senators warned the administration that  
if President Clinton again tries to have the Senate ratify the 
treaty, ``It will be defeated.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Appearing on CNN's ``Late Edition,'' Albright said Wednesday's  
51-48 Senate vote against the Comprehensive Test Ban treaty -- far 
below the 67 needed to ratify -- ``hurt us internationally'' and 
mystified her colleagues around the world. 
</P>
<P>
	``What we've lost for the time being is the real international  
leadership in terms of trying to make others live up to the CTBT,'' 
she said. 
</P>
<P>
	``But I want to assure all your viewers, around the world, that  
the United States is going to live up to the conditions of the 
treaty.'' 
</P>
<P>
	She noted that Clinton was the first world leader to sign the  
global treaty, which has been signed by 154 nations and ratified by 
51, including only 26 of the 44 countries potentially capable of 
producing nuclear weapons. 
</P>
<P>
	``The Republicans defeated a major landmark treaty that would  
really have helped generally in controlling nuclear weapons and our 
whole nonproliferation agenda,'' Albright said. 
</P>
<P>
	She did not say whether the administration would submit the pact  
for the Senate to reconsider its first treaty rejection since the 
League of Nations treaty in 1920. 
</P>
<P>
	John Podesta, the White House chief of staff, said, ``The treaty  
remains before the Senate.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The administration, he said on ABC's ``This Week,'' will  
``continue to press the Senate to consider it and to respond to the 
arguments that have been made.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Two leaders of the treaty opponents, Sens. Jon Kyl, R-Ariz., and  
James Inhofe, R-Okla., gave no indication such an appeal might 
succeed. 
</P>
<P>
	``It will not come up again, because the United States cannot  
unilaterally amend the treaty,'' Kyl said on ABC. ``It will not 
come up again, and if it does, it will be defeated.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Inhofe suggested that Clinton's problem was that he failed to  
inform the Senate of his plans before he signed the treaty in 1996. 
That way, Inhofe said, the Senate would have made clear it never 
would have given its advice and consent required under the 
Constitution for a treaty's ratification. 
</P>
<P>
	``What the president should have done,'' Inhofe said, ``is come  
to the Senate first and say, `This is what we want to do. ... Do 
you think that this is going be consented to by the Senate, if we 
do promulgate this?''' 
</P>
<P>
	Because of the treaty's flaws, Inhofe said, the answer would  
have been no.

<HEADLINE> Poll Finds Support for Military </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CONWAY, Wash. (AP) -- As the crow flies, this hamlet nestled  
among Skagit Valley farm houses and strawberry fields is about as 
distant from the Pentagon as you can get in the continental United 
States. 
</P>
<P>
	Yet when it comes to national defense, folks around Conway,  
about 60 miles north of Seattle, share with many Americans a 
mixture of appreciation for the military and the longstanding 
debate over whether it costs too much. 
</P>
<P>
	``We need to have a strong military,'' says Bruce Morrison. He  
believes the military enjoys strong public support and has become 
more closely linked to civilian society since it became an 
all-volunteer service more than two decades ago. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, Morrison's own son, now in college, never considered a  
career in the military. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's got all the opportunity he needs without the military,''  
Morrison, 52, said as he fingered a heaping carton of fresh-picked 
blueberries at the Snow Goose produce stand along the north fork of 
the Skagit River. 
</P>
<P>
	In random interviews recently with people in and around Puget  
Sound, it was difficult to find evidence of a ``disconnect'' with 
the military that Defense Secretary William Cohen fears may be 
undermining support for men and women in uniform -- a culture gap, 
some say, that isolates the military. 
</P>
<P>
	At a flower shop in the fishing village of Blaine, abutting the  
Canadian border, 35-year-old Sherry, who declined to give her last 
name, said she believes a strong military is ``just as important as 
it's always been.'' She would recommend military service to any 
young person. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's probably one of the most important things you could do,''  
she says. 
</P>
<P>
	These views are largely in line with the results of a poll  
conducted for The Associated Press by ICR of Media, Pa., which 
asked adult Americans how much confidence they have in their 
military. Sixty-four percent said they had a ``good deal'' of 
confidence and 28 percent had ``some'' confidence. Only 7 percent 
had little or no confidence. 
</P>
<P>
	The AP poll also asked whether people would support a son or  
daughter's plan to enter the military. Sixty-six percent said they 
would be supportive, and 29 percent said they would suggest a 
different line of work. Five percent did not know. 
</P>
<P>
	The poll also indicated:  
</P>
<P>
	--More than three-quarters said they support a pay raise for the  
military, while 13 percent oppose it. 
</P>
<P>
	--About half, 49 percent, support using U.S. troops as  
peacekeepers overseas, while 42 percent oppose it. 
</P>
<P>
	``We need to keep peace or we'll all be at war,'' said  
50-year-old Sheila Hudson of Tulsa, Okla. 
</P>
<P>
	``I oppose using troops as peacekeepers,'' said Ira Smith, a  
machinist from Jacksonville, Fla. ``I don't think the United States 
should be the world police. Our tax money should be used for 
protecting our own citizens.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The poll of 1,011 people was conducted Sept. 17-24 by  
International Communications Research and has an error margin of 
plus or minus 3 percentage points. 
</P>
<P>
	Some people fault the military for wasteful spending. Others,  
like Richard Owens, say the military simply takes too big a share 
of taxpayer dollars. Over breakfast with his wife and three 
daughters at the Captain Whidbey Inn overlooking Penn Cove near 
Coupeville, Wash., Owens said he believes the military is building 
weapons it no longer needs. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think money in this country should be spent on other  
things,'' he said, like social services. 
</P>
<P>
	In the AP poll, 47 percent said defense spending should be kept  
about the same, 34 percent wanted higher spending and 12 percent 
wanted less. Defense spending for the current budget year is set at 
$270 billion, and the Clinton administration's longer-range plan is 
for military spending to rise to $318 billion by 2005. 
</P>
<P>
	Early this year, Cohen began a public campaign to ``reconnect''  
America to its military, a sales job he felt necessary to boost 
understanding of and support for the 1.4 million men and women on 
active duty. He took his message on the road, starting with an 
address to the Illinois State Assembly where he made a pitch for 
military pay raises. 
</P>
<P>
	Cohen also visited the Redmond, Wash., headquarters of computer  
giant Microsoft Corp., an unusual audience for a Pentagon chief. 
</P>
<P>
	``I believe there exists a gap between some in this industry and  
our military,'' Cohen told his Microsoft listeners. 
</P>
<P>
	The gap, he said, is not unique to the high-tech industries but  
is ``indicative of our country.'' There is a tendency to ``dismiss 
the importance of the national security world,'' he said, and to 
conclude that with the Cold War over, ``tanks and guns are somehow 
rusty relics of the past and nearly obsolete in the new 
information-based world.'' 
</P>
<P>
	That does not fit with the views of Tom Holum, 43, who lives on  
the south end of Whidbey Island, just west of Everett. He thinks 
the military plays an important role in America's economic 
security, and he believes young people still are attracted to the 
military for high-tech skills that are transferrable to the 
civilian job market. 
</P>
<P>
	On the campus of the University of Washington in Seattle, Kristi  
Beck, a 20-year-old psychology major, said she admires the men and 
women who serve in the military but never seriously considered it 
as a possible career path. 
</P>
<P>
	``I didn't like the idea of having to move around a lot,'' she  
said.

<HEADLINE> 'Sixth Sense' Writer Gets $4M Deal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PHILADELPHIA (AP) -- ``The Sixth Sense'' has helped land  
screenwriter- director M. Night Shyamalan a record seven-figure 
deal, The Philadelphia Inquirer reported. 
</P>
<P>
	Shyamalan, 29, will get more than $4 million from Disney for his  
screenplay ``Unbreakable,'' an drama set in Philadelphia, according 
to the newspaper, which cited anonymous industry sources. Disney 
officials did not confirm the deal. 
</P>
<P>
	The film is set to feature Bruce Willis and Samuel L. Jackson,  
the paper reported Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's overwhelming,'' said Shyamalan, who wrote the script and  
directed ``The Sixth Sense,'' the supernatural thriller that has 
earned $245 million in North America. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's hard to deal with the ramifications. 'The Sixth Sense'  
just came out 10 weeks ago, and it's changed my life. Going into 
it, I didn't have a secure position. Now I ask for what I want, and 
if it's humanly or physically possible, it happens.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The most previously paid for a screenplay was $4 million to  
Shane Black for ``The Long Kiss Goodnight,'' the paper said.

more yards than any quarterback in NFL history, left because of a 
shoulder injury after two series against the New England Patriots 
on Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	Marino, who complained of an injured right shoulder during the  
week, completed his first pass for eight yards to go over 60,000 
yards for his career. He now has 60,001. 
</P>
<P>
	But on his second throw, he was hit by Lawyer Milloy and the  
ball floated out to Patriots linebacker Andy Katzenmoyer, who 
returned it 57 yards for a touchdown. On the next series, Marino 
tried a short pass that fell well short of the intended receiver. 
</P>
<P>
	``I thought I might be able to start,'' said Marino, who will  
have an MRI on Monday. ``But when I warmed up, I was throwing 
changeups. Usually I throw fastballs, but today I was throwing 
changeups.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Damon Huard entered on the third series and his first pass was  
intercepted for a TD by New England's Ty Law, who returned the ball 
27 yards for a TD. But Huard went on to lead the Dolphins to a 
31-30 win.

<HEADLINE> Report: Testimony Swayed Ramsey Jury </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BOULDER, Colo. (AP) -- The grand jury investigating JonBenet  
Ramsey's slaying may have turned its attention away from 
prosecutors' focus on the little girl's parents after late 
testimony from witnesses, Newsweek reports. 
</P>
<P>
	The magazine reports in the issue hitting newsstands on Monday  
that the testimony may have led to their decision not to bring 
charges against John and Patsy Ramsey. 
</P>
<P>
	After meeting in secret for more than a year, the panel  
investigating the 1996 slaying ended its work last week. No 
indictments were returned and prosecutors announced that the 
Boulder Police Department would resume the investigation. 
</P>
<P>
	According to the Newsweek report, which cites unnamed sources,  
prosecutor Michael Kane was nearing the end of his presentation to 
the grand jury when several witnesses ``with strong evidence 
pointing away from the parents'' asked to be heard. 
</P>
<P>
	After testimony by former Colorado Springs homicide detective  
Lou Smit, who has spoken publicly about DNA found under JonBenet's 
fingernail and her underwear that did not match the family's, grand 
jurors reportedly asked prosecutors to explain the DNA, the report 
said. Smit believes an intruder killed the girl. 
</P>
<P>
	Suzanne Laurion, spokeswoman for the Boulder District Attorney's  
office, said Sunday: ``I would question any report that purported 
to know what went on in this grand jury because the proceedings 
were secret.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Authorities have said that the Ramseys remain under an  
``umbrella of suspicion'' in the December 1996 slaying of JonBenet, 
6, at their Boulder home. 
</P>
<P>
	The Ramseys have steadfastly maintained their innocence.

<HEADLINE> America's Cup Yachts Take to the Sea </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	AUCKLAND, New Zealand (AP) -- After years in planning rooms and  
laboratories, after months of practice and intrigue, the America's 
Cup yachts finally took to the open seas Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	The starter's gun boomed across New Zealand's Hauraki Gulf at  
10:40 a.m. to begin the Louis Vuitton Cup challenger series, a 
regatta that will last four months and feature 11 yachts. 
</P>
<P>
	In perfect spring conditions, the New York Yacht Club's Young  
America beat America True by 37 seconds; Japan's Nippon beat 
Hawaii's Abracadabra 2000 by 38 seconds; Italy's Prada beat the 
Swiss FAST2000 by 4:20; Dennis Conner's Stars and Stripes beat Le 
Defi Francais by 9 seconds; and AmericaOne beat the Spanish 
challenge by 1:09. Young Australia had the bye. 
</P>
<P>
	The afternoon pairings had Prada vs. Nippon; Spanish Challenge  
vs. Young America; America True vs. AmericaOne; Young Australia vs. 
Le Defi Francais; and Abracadabra vs. Fast2000. Stars and Stripes 
had the bye. 
</P>
<P>
	In each of three round-robins in the challenger series between  
Oct. 18 and Dec. 12, each team will race all other teams. A boat 
gets one point for each win in the first round robin, four points 
in the second, nine in the third. 
</P>
<P>
	More than 700 races will have been run to decide the challenger.  
</P>
<P>
	The best six teams will compete in semifinals in January, and  
the winner and Team New Zealand will meet in a best-of-9 series in 
February for the America's Cup. 
</P>
<P>
	Team New Zealand, using only two boats to prepare for its  
defense, has its own course on which to practice. 
</P>
<P>
	This is only the second time the America's Cup has been held  
outside the United States. 
</P>
<P>
	New Zealand, a South Pacific island nation of some 3.5 million  
people, features volcanic mountain landscapes plunging into a 
rugged coastline. It claims to have the highest per-capita boat 
ownership of any country and calls Auckland its City of Sails. 
</P>
<P>
	When the 24-inch high silver trophy was paraded through Auckland  
last week, tens of thousands of cheering people lined the streets. 
</P>
<P>
	The trophy was shown in a bulletproof case because of a  
sledgehammer attack by a political activist in 1997. The trophy had 
to be returned to its maker for repairs. 
</P>
<P>
	For many teams, preparations began the moment Sir Peter Blake's  
Black Magic trounced Conner's Stars and Stripes in a 5-0 victory 
off San Diego in 1995. 
</P>
<P>
	With cutting-edge technology as important as skilled sailors,  
team budgets are among the most expensive in the competition's 
148-year history. 
</P>
<P>
	The biggest spenders are among the favorites, including the New  
York Yacht Club, which held the trophy for 132 years until 1983. 
The NYYC launched a $40 million campaign for its boat Young 
America. 
</P>
<P>
	Tough competition is expected from AmericaOne, the $32 million  
bid from the St. Francis Yacht Club; the Prada challenge from 
Italy, which at $50 million has the largest budget; and Japan's 
Nippon, which will spend $20 million. 
</P>
<P>
	Other teams include Conner, a four-time winner and two-time  
loser of the cup, and two other U.S. syndicates, including 
America's True, which has the only woman skipper in Dawn Riley.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Has Mixed Reaction to Pakistan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The United States on Sunday praised Gen.  
Pervaiz Musharraf for pledging to return Pakistan to democratic 
rule but expressed disappointment that the military leader offered 
no timetable for that transition. 
</P>
<P>
	U.S. officials said they were pleased by several points  
Musharraf made in an address Sunday, his first public appearance 
since announcing last week that he had ousted Pakistan's civilian 
government. They cited his references to reducing the military 
presence at the border with India. 
</P>
<P>
	But they also said they were concerned that Musharraf left open  
the question of when democracy will return to Pakistan and urged 
him to do so as quickly as possible. 
</P>
<P>
	``As General Musharraf told his nation, actions speak louder  
than words,'' State Department spokesman James Rubin said. ``Our 
own actions toward Pakistan in the days ahead will be guided by the 
steps taken by the new authorities.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Secretary of State Madeleine Albright, speaking a short time  
before Musharraf's address, told CNN's ``Late Edition'' that the 
United States specifically is looking to see how Musharraf handles 
civil liberties, press freedoms and human rights issues. 
</P>
<P>
	``What we're saying here is that the people of Pakistan should  
have the right to have a democratic or a constitutional government, 
that they also need to be able to be a part of the international 
system economically, that they should not have corruption there, 
that they need to have their civil liberties,'' Albright said. 
</P>
<P>
	As for the deposed Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif, the Clinton  
administration is not pressing for his return to power, Albright 
acknowledged, but added, ``We believe that it's important that his 
security be guaranteed.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In recent days, U.S. military leaders have made it clear that  
they were not alarmed by the military takeover, and that they 
consider Musharraf pro-Western and capable of controlling the 
country's nuclear weapons. 
</P>
<P>
	Nonetheless, the military coup prompted the White House to  
announce it will impose new sanctions against Pakistan. State 
Department officials said a $1.7 million health program, operated 
by private organizations, would be suspended. But a $2.5 million 
program to counter narcotics would not be interrupted. 
</P>
<P>
	William Milam, the U.S. ambassador to Pakistan, met with  
Musharraf for two hours Friday in Islamabad to press for assurances 
on a transition to civilian rule. At the time, Musharraf did not 
reveal his intentions, the White House said. 
</P>
<P>
	U.S. military leaders have not had close contact with the  
Pakistani military in recent years because of extensive U.S. 
sanctions imposed in 1990 by the Bush administration and additional 
restrictions that followed Pakistan's nuclear tests in 1998. But 
military relations were close during the Cold War. 
</P>
<P>
	Sunday, Musharraf said he wanted good relations with the United  
States but that Pakistan's foreign policy would be more oriented 
toward relations with the Muslim world. 
</P>
<P>
	Rubin said U.S. officials were encouraging Musharraf to take  
``confidence-building measures that could lead to a lessening of 
tensions with India,'' and that they hope Musharraf would also thin 
out troops along the line of control in Kashmir. 
</P>
<P>
	``Because we do not believe military takeovers are the  
appropriate method for resolving the problems that face 
democracies, we welcome ... his promise that the armed forces would 
not stay in charge any longer than necessary,'' Rubin said. ``At 
the same time, we are disappointed that he did not offer a clear 
timetable for the early restoration of constitutional, civilian and 
democratic government. We call upon him to do so now.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Musharraf listed seven objectives of his administration:  
rebuilding national confidence, easing tensions between the 
provinces, reviving the economy and restoring investor confidence, 
strengthening law and order, removing politics from state 
institutions, giving more power to the people, and ensuring a quick 
recovery of illicit wealth.

<HEADLINE> Lawsuit Filed Over 'Rat Pack' Show </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LAS VEGAS (AP) -- Sammy Davis Jr.'s widow has sued a hotel over a  
lounge show featuring impersonations of her late husband and other 
members of ``The Rat Pack.'' 
</P>
<P>
	According to Altovise Davis' federal lawsuit, the Desert Inn has  
wrongfully used her husband's name, identity and persona in its 
advertising for ``The Rat Pack Is Back'' show. 
</P>
<P>
	The lawsuit, filed Friday, comes more than a month after the  
hotel was sued by Sheffield Enterprises, a licensing company owned 
by Frank Sinatra's children. 
</P>
<P>
	Resort spokeswoman Caroline Coyle said the show will go on.  
</P>
<P>
	``The Desert Inn believes its actions in hosting 'The Rat Pack  
Is Back' lounge show are completely lawful,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	The show features performers who impersonate Rat Pack members  
Dean Martin and Joey Bishop in addition to Davis and Sinatra. 
Sinatra died in May 1998, Martin in 1995, and Davis in 1990.

<HEADLINE> Ali Wants To Get Back in Ring </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- It sounds improbable, but Muhammad Ali says he  
wants to get back into the ring one more time. 
</P>
<P>
	In this week's Newsweek's magazine, the three-time heavyweight  
champion wrote that he is planning on getting in shape to do some 
sparring, despite his Parkinson's disease that has slowed his 
speech and movement. 
</P>
<P>
	Ali, 57, last fought professionally on Dec. 11, 1981, a 10-round  
loss to Trevor Berbick. He finished with a 56-5 record and 37 
knockouts. 
</P>
<P>
	``Now I'm fighting Parkinson's disease. But I don't let it stop  
me. I still travel, attend to my business, do interviews,'' Ali 
wrote in a first-person remembrance for the magazine. 
</P>
<P>
	``And let me tell you something that'll shock the Earth. I'm  
going to train and get in really good shape, lose 35 pounds and do 
an exhibition in Madison Square Garden with two or three 
contenders,'' he wrote. ``I'll dance for 15 rounds, and whup 'em. I 
haven't forgotten. I'll be weighing in at 210 pounds. I'll just 
say, 'I am returned. Get the contract.''' 
</P>
<P>
	Ali travels with his wife, Lonnie, who speaks on his behalf. His  
speech is limited by Parkinson's, a degenerative nerve disease. His 
walk is a little slower, but his intellect is unaffected. 
</P>
<P>
	Ali's daughter, Laila, one of his eight children, won her first  
professional fight on Oct. 8 with her father in attendance. She 
plans on fighting again. 
</P>
<P>
	In the Newsweek article, Ali called his fight with Joe Frazier  
in 1975, the ``Thrilla in Manila,'' his greatest bout. He also said 
the greatest thing he ever did was not go to Vietnam when drafted 
in 1967.

<HEADLINE> Hurricane Irene Moving Off Coast </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WILMINGTON, N.C. (AP) -- Hurricane Irene drenched southeastern  
North Carolina with more than a half foot of rain before heading 
out to sea Sunday night, unleashing more flooding in a region still 
saturated by record floodwaters from Hurricane Floyd. 
</P>
<P>
	As the storm turned east and its strongest winds moved away from  
land, the National Weather Service dropped hurricane warnings at 11 
p.m. Tropical storm warnings remained in effect for most of the 
North Carolina coast. 
</P>
<P>
	The National Hurricane Center in Miami said it appeared  
increasingly likely that Irene's northeast track and its 75 mph 
winds might skirt the North Carolina coast without coming ashore. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's moving more toward the east, but it could be very close  
to the Cape Lookout area in the early morning hours. That's what it 
looks like,'' said meteorologist Bill Frederick. 
</P>
<P>
	At 11 p.m., Irene was 85 miles southeast of Wilmington, moving  
northeast at 23 mph. 
</P>
<P>
	A flurry of beach town evacuations preceded the storm, North  
Carolina's third hurricane in two months. Torrential rains in front 
of Irene's core swamped dozens of roads, and National Guard troops 
were called out to sandbag against rising flood waters. 
</P>
<P>
	A tornado spawned by the hurricane touched down near Weeksville  
at about 6:40 p.m., destroying six homes and damaging several more. 
One person suffered minor injuries. 
</P>
<P>
	The greatest concern was rain, not wind, and the eastern coastal  
plain, inundated by Hurricane Floyd just four weeks ago, was 
especially vulnerable to more flooding. 
</P>
<P>
	Up to 7 inches had fallen in parts of eastern North Carolina by  
Sunday night, the National Weather Service said. 
</P>
<P>
	State public safety secretary Richard Moore said the worst  
flooding was expected in the Fayetteville area and along the Cape 
Fear River, expected to crest 20 feet above flood stage later this 
week. 
</P>
<P>
	No deaths had been reported in association with the storm in  
North Carolina by Sunday night. Irene has been blamed for seven 
deaths, five of them in Florida and two in Cuba. 
</P>
<P>
	A flash flood warning was issued for a 100-mile-by-50-mile swath  
of eastern North Carolina straddling Interstate 95 between 
Fayetteville and Rocky Mount. Gale-force winds were measured at the 
coast, and a tornado was reported by radar over Jacksonville on 
Sunday morning. 
</P>
<P>
	Scores of roads in the eastern part of the state had been closed  
because of flash flooding by 10 p.m. More than 2,100 homes and 
businesses were without power in the eastern half of the state. 
</P>
<P>
	Irene initially was expected to come ashore near the South  
Carolina line Sunday night, but then it picked up speed and tacked 
to the northeast. 
</P>
<P>
	An evacuation order was issued for several beach towns near  
Wilmington, and people living in low-lying areas and mobile homes 
were encouraged to seek shelter. Many left homeless by Floyd were 
evacuated from temporary trailer villages to shelters. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm getting to the point where I can't take it any more,''  
said Herbert Person Jr., 48, who lost his Princeville home and was 
living in a government trailer park when he was evacuated to a 
shelter. ``I've worked hard all my life and paid taxes, and now I 
feel like I have nothing.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The prospect of more flooding from Irene disheartened others  
still recovering from Floyd, which drenched eastern North Carolina 
with up to 20 inches of rain on Sept. 16. 
</P>
<P>
	``I can only imagine the frustration and anxiety I have seen on  
people's faces, having to move again into shelters and not knowing 
what they will find when they go back,'' said Moore. ``It's 
devastating.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The American Red Cross reported at least 690 people were staying  
at 58 shelters Sunday night. 
</P>
<P>
	State officials prepared for Irene by activating 500 National  
Guardsmen, opening 39 Guard armories and putting 10 water rescue 
teams on standby in anticipating of flooding. 
</P>
<P>
	Because of Floyd's destructiveness -- at least 49 deaths and some  
6,000 homes destroyed and billions in damages -- people were taking 
Irene very seriously, Moore said. 
</P>
<P>
	``If anything, people are going to err on the extreme side of  
caution,'' he said, adding that heavy rainfall could keep eastern 
North Carolina rivers above flood stage all week. 
</P>
<P>
	In South Carolina, dozens of church services were canceled, draw  
bridges were locked down and the Charleston International Airport 
was closed. Up to 6 inches of rain fell in parts of the state. 
</P>
<P>
	Across the state line, at Carolina Beach south of Wilmington,  
the boardwalk was deserted and the go-carts were lashed together at 
a nearby amusement park, closed for business. 
</P>
<P>
	Jack Tucker looked out over the empty Carolina Bingo hall, where  
he was helping out Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think even the flies are gone today,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> Motorola Worker Accused in Scam </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- For a $40,000-a-year Motorola Inc. customer  
relations worker, Brian McGhee appeared to live lavishly, allegedly 
spending thousands of dollars a month on clothing and building a 
house worth more than a quarter-million dollars. 
</P>
<P>
	But authorities claim the 27-year-old made most of his money by  
illegally selling cellular phone batteries on the side -- allegedly 
scamming his employer out of up to $2.5 million over the last year. 
</P>
<P>
	McGhee was charged Friday with stealing more than $100,000 from  
the world's No. 2 maker of cellular phones, where he has worked for 
three years. He allegedly confessed to Libertyville police after 
his arrest Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	McGhee worked in the customer relations department at Motorola's  
Libertyville facility, fielding calls from cellular phone 
customers. Customers sometimes are advised to return defective 
batteries in exchange for new ones and give their credit card 
number as a deposit until the company receives the old battery. 
</P>
<P>
	McGhee allegedly entered bogus card numbers and shipped  
batteries, each valued at about $100, by the thousand to associates 
at 57 locations in Illinois and Wisconsin. 
</P>
<P>
	``We think he was sending them to accomplices who would pay him  
and they would sell them at a profit,'' Assistant Lake County 
State's Attorney Steven Scheller said. 
</P>
<P>
	Motorola officials became suspicious earlier this month, when a  
battery was mailed back to Motorola marked ``Return to Sender,'' 
and they were unable to document the transaction, Scheller said. 
</P>
<P>
	Company officials put McGhee under surveillance Oct. 8. Security  
guards followed him to a Burger King restaurant, where they 
allegedly saw him exchange a Motorola battery container. 
</P>
<P>
	Investigators are trying to identify accomplices, Scheller said.  
</P>
<P>
	Motorola spokeswoman Sue Frederick told the Chicago Tribune that  
the company would not comment because of the police investigation. 
A spokesperson did not return a phone message from The Associated 
Press. 
</P>
<P>
	McGhee allegedly told police that for one battery shipment, a  
customer gave him $25,000 to $30,000 plus a 1998 Lincoln Navigator 
sport utility vehicle worth about $50,000. 
</P>
<P>
	Authorities, who said McGhee spent $12,000 a month on clothes,  
allegedly found 150 pairs of Nike athletic shoes and a drawer full 
of jewelry and diamonds in his apartment. 
</P>
<P>
	``Instead of doing laundry, apparently he would just throw his  
clothes away,'' Scheller said. 
</P>
<P>
	Authorities said McGhee also put $9,000 down on a house, which  
is still under construction and has an estimated value of $270,000 
to $340,000.

<HEADLINE> Few Blacks in S. African Boardrooms </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	JOHANNESBURG, South Africa (AP) -- Whites still dominate South  
African company boardrooms five years after the end of apartheid, 
according to a study released Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	Blacks made up 12 percent of the directors of South African  
companies listed on the stock exchange, according to the Sunday 
Times of Johannesburg, which commissioned the private study. 
</P>
<P>
	Even among black empowerment companies that were intended to  
redress racial imbalance in the control of wealth, only 37 percent 
of 260 directors in such organizations are black, the study said. 
</P>
<P>
	Twenty-one of the 600 companies listed on the Johannesburg Stock  
Exchange have black chief executives. 
</P>
<P>
	Women have a lower profile, holding only 5 percent of  
directorships of listed companies. 
</P>
<P>
	Earlier this year, one of the largest black-managed companies on  
the exchange, New Africa Investments Ltd., was rocked by the 
resignation of two high-profile proponents of encouraging black 
entrepreneurship. 
</P>
<P>
	Shareholders rebelled when the two directors and other officials  
tried to give themselves share options in a subsidiary bank.

<TEXT>
<P>
	ROCKY MOUNT, N.C. (AP) -- Fannie Lewis was in a shelter again  
Sunday after Hurricane Irene forced her from the government camper 
where she had begun to make a new life after Hurricane Floyd 
destroyed her home. 
</P>
<P>
	``I fear the next step we're going to make is in the ground,''  
the 37-year-old Lewis said glumly as heavy rain drummed on a 
corrugated plastic roof over the walkway at D.S. Johnson School. 
</P>
<P>
	Lewis and about 300 other refugees from Princeville, Tarboro and  
Rocky Mount had only weeks ago moved into campers in an industrial 
park after Floyd's floodwaters destroyed their homes and forced 
them into shelters. This weekend, they were evacuated from the 
campers, which are not designed to withstand strong winds, and 
moved back into shelters. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm getting to the point where I can't take it any more,''  
said Herbert Person Jr., 48, who lost his Princeville home, which 
was nearly paid for. He was living in one of the trailers, eating 
donated food, when he became a refugee again. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've worked hard all my life and paid taxes, and now I feel  
like I have nothing,'' he said. ``I can't work because I have to 
take care of business. But if I don't work, I'm afraid the bank 
will take my truck. I'm so stressed out I don't know what to do.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Put this on the front page of the newspaper -- we need money!''  
he said, drawing a cheer from the largely male crowd outside the 
shelter. 
</P>
<P>
	Haywood Sherrod, 50, who suffers from high blood pressure and  
diabetes, said he left his medication back in his camper. 
</P>
<P>
	``They came by around 6:30 p.m. last night and told us we had to  
leave because they were concerned about the high winds,'' he said. 
``I just said, `Oh, no. Not again.' It's hard to run again.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``It's going to be a long time before the people around here can  
get Floyd out of our minds,'' he said, shaping a piece of cardboard 
from a discarded box to fit inside one of his slippers to keep his 
sore feet dry and warm. 
</P>
<P>
	Nearby, evacuees lined up for a lunch of chicken, french fries  
and soft drinks. They ignored the tiny stools and tables as they 
ate the hot food. 
</P>
<P>
	``I feel like a prisoner,'' said Christine Crews, 25, as she  
waited her turn with her mother, Barbara Crews, 48. ``I was forced 
to run from my home, then they put me in a trailer. We were just 
starting to settle in. Then they knock on my door and tell me I 
have to run again.''

<HEADLINE> Spina Bifida Procedure Publicized </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NASHVILLE, Tenn. (AP) -- Drs. Joseph Bruner and Noel Tulipan have  
received accolades for their pioneering method of treating spina 
bifida in the womb but have gotten chilly reviews in some medical 
circles for their method of publicizing it. 
</P>
<P>
	Rather than waiting months or years for their procedure to be  
reviewed by peers and published in a medical journal, the 
Vanderbilt University Medical Center doctors took their story 
straight to the media. Soon, stories about them, their procedure 
and their patients started showing up in newspapers and magazines, 
and on television shows around the country. 
</P>
<P>
	Then came e-mails and phone calls from doctors criticizing them  
as media hounds more interested in self-promotion than sound 
science. 
</P>
<P>
	``We felt it was important for the public to know we were  
performing a new and innovative procedure on unborn babies,'' 
Bruner said. ``The public has a right to know about that, and we 
wanted to work with news organizations to let the public know as 
much as we could.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Though the procedure is yielding good initial results, some  
physicians are uncomfortable with the doctors going public before 
their work was reviewed by peers. 
</P>
<P>
	Among them is Dr. N. Scott Adzick, director of the Center for  
Fetal Diagnosis at Children's Hospital in Philadelphia and the only 
other doctor using a similar technique to treat spina bifida. 
``Folks can make claims about everything, and I don't think the lay 
process is the place to ferret that out,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	``My approach would not be to have reporters follow families  
through the process or have TV crews following families through the 
process because these are very vulnerable families now.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A bitter rivalry developed between Adzick and the Vanderbilt  
doctors last November when he published the results of his work in 
The Lancet, a British medical journal, and called his procedure the 
first of its kind. 
</P>
<P>
	The Vanderbilt doctors sent an angry letter to the journal  
saying they were the first, and Adzick responded by criticizing the 
doctors for using the mass media to publicize their work. 
</P>
<P>
	The acrimony has ended, both sides say, and the doctors now  
refer patients to each other. 
</P>
<P>
	Spina bifida is the nation's most common permanently disabling  
birth defect, affecting about one of every 1,000 births. It occurs 
when the skin fails to properly close over the spinal cord early in 
the pregnancy and may result in excess fluid on the brain, bowel 
and bladder problems, clubbed feet, partial paralysis and learning 
difficulties. 
</P>
<P>
	Traditionally, doctors have tried to limit its effects by  
closing the spinal cord in the first 24 hours after birth. In the 
procedure done by Bruner and Tulipan, doctors operate while the 
baby is in the womb, between 20 weeks and 28 weeks after 
conception. 
</P>
<P>
	The surgeons place the uterus on the mother's belly, pull the  
fetus out through an incision, locate the spinal cord and close 
tissue over the exposed area. The fetus is then returned to the 
womb and allowed to develop until the mother gives birth. 
</P>
<P>
	The doctors have performed about 60 operations. In about half,  
their patients have avoided the shunts almost all spina bifida 
patients need to drain fluid from the brain for the rest of their 
lives. Though it is too early to tell, Bruner and Tulipan are 
hopeful the surgery will improve brain function, too. 
</P>
<P>
	When Bruner and Tulipan began doing the procedure in April 1997,  
they planned to wait and see the results of 10 cases before they 
went public with their findings. 
</P>
<P>
	But their initial patients were so pleased they contacted media  
in their hometowns to try to raise money to help other parents get 
the procedure, which at the time was not covered by insurance. The 
doctors cooperated with the reporters. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't think that we really had a concept at the time how  
this would really capture the public imagination and how tremendous 
of an advance the public would perceive this as,'' Bruner said. 
</P>
<P>
	While the public wanted to learn about the procedure, medical  
journals were not eager to provide a forum. The New England Journal 
of Medicine rejected a paper on their technique because the results 
already had appeared on the hospital Web site. 
</P>
<P>
	Medical journals want doctors to follow tradition, presenting  
their work to their colleagues for review before any word of it is 
published. 
</P>
<P>
	When doctors go to the public without having their work verified  
and scrutinized by other doctors, ``the risk of harm (to the 
public) may actually outweigh the benefits,'' said Dr. Richard 
Glass, an interim co-editor of the Journal of the American Medical 
Association. 
</P>
<P>
	Since their paper was rejected, Bruner said, he and Tulipan have  
become more reluctant about sharing their results to prevent 
themselves from being barred by other publications. That puts them 
in a bind. As they perform more surgeries, they have more results 
to share. 
</P>
<P>
	``We now know, for example, that there are some babies that have  
better outcomes than others. There are some babies that will 
benefit tremendously from this and there are others that won't 
benefit so much,'' Bruner said. 
</P>
<P>
	``We think this is important information to get out to the  
public. Unfortunately, the turnaround time for journals is 
somewhere between one to two years. By the time the information 
that we've already submitted to journals gets published, it's going 
to be out of date. And by the time we send them new information, 
it'll be another year or two years to get it published. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's very frustrating to have information that we know is  
important for the public and that we know patients need in order to 
make reasonable decisions.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The need for speed is not lost on medical journals. The Journal  
of the American Medical Society announced in May a new ``JAMA 
Express'' process to rush information deemed critical into 
publication within six weeks, up from an average of five months. 
</P>
<P>
	Extremely critical articles can be published much faster on the  
journal's Web site. In June 1998, JAMA posted a report about a 
potentially fatal pairing of two drugs used to treat high blood 
pressure. The report hit the Web three days after it was accepted. 
</P>
<P>
	``Those things have to be considered very carefully,'' Glass  
said. ``Everybody would like things to go fast, and it's just not 
possible for everything to go that fast.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Adzick said while things move faster now, it's important for the  
peer review process to continue to ensure credibility. Tulipan 
agreed. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't think the lay press or the public is qualified to  
decide whether a procedure is effective or not,'' Tulipan said. 
Peer review is ``still the gold standard. It's still the 
benchmark.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Still, Bruner has few regrets about the methods he and Tulipan  
used. 
</P>
<P>
	``Looking back over the past few years, I can't see it happening  
any differently,'' he said. ``The only way it could have been 
different is if we refused to talk to the media altogether, and 
that would have been unfair. 
</P>
<P>
	``Back in the '50s and '60s, a lot of human experiments were  
done that were kept secret from the public and when the public 
found out, they were always upset. So we weren't going to hide what 
we were doing.''

<HEADLINE> U.S., Russia Review Nuclear Treaty </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- A potential threat from radical nations,  
shared by the United States and Russia, motivated a U.S. proposal 
that they amend a bedrock anti-nuclear treaty to allow limited 
missile defense systems. 
</P>
<P>
	U.S. officials said Sunday U.S. negotiators have proposed that  
the Americans help Russia finish a major radar installation near 
Irkutsk, Siberia, oriented across Russia's vast southeastern coast 
to keep watch on North Korea among others. In exchange, Russia 
would agree to alter the 1972 Anti-Ballistic Missile treaty so that 
both countries could establish national missile defense systems. 
</P>
<P>
	The ABM treaty, ratified by the Senate in August 1972, bans  
construction of systems to defend against ballistic missile 
attacks. An outgrowth of the first strategic arms limitations 
talks, the treaty is considered a cornerstone arms control 
agreement. 
</P>
<P>
	``We don't want to weaken Russian security. We're looking to  
enhance both countries' security, and that may need some 
adjustments to the ABM treaty,'' White House chief of staff John 
Podesta said on ABC's ``This Week.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He said the goal is to cope with nuclear threats from countries  
such as Iran and North Korea, which the Americans consider ``rogue 
states,'' while leaving the essence of the ABM treaty intact. 
</P>
<P>
	Secretary of State Madeleine Albright told CNN's ``Late  
Edition'' the discussions have not advanced past preliminary 
stages. She said U.S. officials are making it very clear that any 
U.S. missile defense effort would be directed not against Russia 
but against rogue states. She mentioned Iran and North Korea. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are very concerned about the development of missile  
technology, nuclear weapons, by the rogue states and consider that 
to be a threat to us and to the Russians,'' Albright said. ``They 
are obviously concerned, as are we, about what the future holds. 
... We want to work together on dealing with what this major threat 
is from the rogue states.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Spurgeon Keeny, president and executive director of the Arms  
Control Association, called the ABM amendment proposal an 
overreaction. He doubts the Russians will go along with it. 
</P>
<P>
	``Such a minimal treaty adjustment directed solely at North  
Korea or the so-called rogue states, an essentially nonexistent 
threat, doesn't make sense,'' Keeny said. ``The Russians and 
Chinese cannot believe the U.S. is so terrified of their token 
capability. This would cost millions and millions of dollars and 
jeopardize all arms control.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Russia rejected previous U.S. efforts to renegotiate the ABM  
treaty, and Russian officials have not responded to the current 
proposal. Russian President Boris Yeltsin said this month in a 
letter to Japanese Prime Minister Keizo Obuchi that Russia is 
reluctant to change the ABM treaty. 
</P>
<P>
	Just two weeks ago, the commander of Russia's strategic missile  
forces, Col. Gen. Vladimir Yakovlev, said the United States would 
trigger a Cold War-style arms race by developing a missile shield 
in violation of the 1972 Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty. It would 
threaten all disarmament agreements between the two countries, 
Yakovlev said. 
</P>
<P>
	National security spokesman Mike Hammer said the United States  
has discussed ``possible sharing of data and information that would 
be useful'' to Russia but would reveal no specifics. 
</P>
<P>
	The radar-enhancement idea drew no fire from senators of either  
party Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	Republican presidential hopeful Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., said  
it is clear that the Nixon-era ABM treaty needs changes. His GOP 
colleague, Sen. Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., said ``whatever it takes 
... to protect our people'' should be done. 
</P>
<P>
	Democratic Sen. Robert Torricelli of New Jersey expressed hope  
that members of both parties, bitterly divided by last week's 
scrapping of a treaty to ban nuclear testing, can ``together work 
with the Russians to save the (ABM) treaty.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Even with the test-ban treaty, Torricelli said, ``The United  
States is going to need at least some limited ballistic missile 
defense.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The three lawmakers spoke on NBC's ``Meet the Press.''

<HEADLINE> Chargers 13, Seahawks 10 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SAN DIEGO (AP) -- After an ugly afternoon of football, the San  
Diego Chargers sit alone atop the AFC West. 
</P>
<P>
	John Carney kicked two field goals in the final 2:54, including  
the game-winning 41-yarder as time expired, and the Chargers beat 
the Seattle Seahawks 13-10 Sunday in a showdown between surprising 
contenders. 
</P>
<P>
	The Chargers, under rookie head coach Mike Riley, improved to  
4-1 for the first time since 1996. The Seahawks, in their first 
year under Mike Holmgren, fell to 3-2. San Diego had lost five 
straight to the Seahawks. 
</P>
<P>
	The Chargers, in their biggest game since the 1995 playoffs,  
could just as easily have ended up as pretenders, although their 
defense once again came up big by holding Seattle to just 201 
yards. 
</P>
<P>
	Erik Kramer threw four interceptions to end the Chargers' first  
four drives of the second half, but the Seahawks capitalized on 
just one, setting up the go-ahead, 1-yard touchdown pass from Jon 
Kitna to backup tight end Itula Mili for a 10-7 lead with 5:37 left 
in the third quarter. 
</P>
<P>
	Kramer suddenly turned perfect on the winning drive, completing  
four straight passes to move the Chargers from their 32-yard line 
to the Seattle 23, where Natrone Means ran it once to set up 
Carney's kick. 
</P>
<P>
	The Chargers called timeout with 3 seconds left, then Carney,  
who had missed badly left on a 42-yard try in the first quarter, 
had a perfect kick to set off a wild celebration. 
</P>
<P>
	Carney kicked a 28-yard field goal with 2:54 left to tie the  
game at 10. After struggling to find his wide receivers all day, 
Kramer threw a 41-yard pass to Jeff Graham on the drive's first 
play. 
</P>
<P>
	San Diego's anemic offense finished with 330 yards, 90 coming on  
the last two drives. Kramer, making his second straight start in 
relief of injured Jim Harbaugh, was 27-of-44 for 296 yards. 
</P>
<P>
	The Seahawks had consecutive interceptions by Brian Walker,  
Chris Canty, Cortez Kennedy and Willie Williams. 
</P>
<P>
	They capitalized only on the pickoff by Walker, which gave them  
the ball at the San Diego 34. Six plays later, after a pass 
interference call against cornerback Terrance Shaw in the end zone, 
Kitna hit backup Mili in the right corner of the end zone. 
</P>
<P>
	The Seahawks followed up the next three interceptions with a  
punt, a missed 48-yard field goal attempt by Todd Peterson and 
another punt. 
</P>
<P>
	San Diego had led 7-3 after Means' 5-yard touchdown run with 42  
seconds before halftime. Means bounced off a pile and beat a 
defender to the right pylon. 
</P>
<P>
	That touchdown was set up by Darryll Lewis' interception.  
</P>
<P>
	The last time the Chargers started 4-1 was 1996, when they  
promptly lost their next three games en route to an 8-8 finish that 
led to coach Bobby Ross being forced out. 
</P>
<P>
	Kitna was 17-of-29 for 151 yards, with one interception.  
</P>
<P>
	Seattle's Ricky Watters was held to 54 yards on 21 carries, the  
24th straight game in which the Chargers have not allowed a runner 
to gain 100 yards. 
</P>
<P>
	Peterson kicked a 40-yard field goal in the second quarter.

<HEADLINE> Lesbian Moms Left in Legal Limbo </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	With a mother's love, Kathleen Crandell writes every week to two  
girls she cannot visit. Whether they get the letters, she doesn't 
know. 
</P>
<P>
	Crandell helped raise the girls before splitting with her  
lesbian partner and considers them her daughters. Distraught when 
excluded from their lives, she sued for visitation rights -- and 
lost. Under California law, she has no greater right to access than 
a stranger. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't think, unless you've lost a kid, you can even fathom  
what it's like,'' Crandell says. ``It's pretty much every moment. 
It's a constant level of missing them.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Similarly wrenching cases are surfacing across the nation as  
more lesbian partners raise children born after artificial 
insemination. When such couples separate, dissolving a union that 
no state recognizes as marriage, the partner who is not the 
biological parent finds herself in legal limbo. 
</P>
<P>
	In California, New York and Florida, state courts have ruled  
within the past 18 months that lesbian ex-partners are not entitled 
to visitation rights with children they helped nurture, regardless 
of how deep the emotional bond. 
</P>
<P>
	Massachusetts' highest court, in contrast, granted visitation  
rights in June to a lesbian who helped raise her ex-partner's son. 
The woman was a ``de facto'' parent, said the court, winning praise 
from gay-rights groups for asserting that nontraditional families 
deserve legal respect. 
</P>
<P>
	The Massachusetts judges were venturing into a legal vacuum; one  
dissenting justice condemned the ruling as an unwarranted step 
toward endorsing same-sex marriages. 
</P>
<P>
	Courts in many other states have sided categorically with the  
biological mother in such disputes, ruling that estranged lesbian 
partners have no more legal right to demand visitation than a 
long-term nanny or close family friend. 
</P>
<P>
	``The courts aren't used to looking at people without a  
biological relationship as being a child's parent,'' says Michael 
Adams, associate director of the American Civil Liberties Union's 
lesbian and gay rights project. ``We are forced to work within laws 
passed by legislatures that simply never considered these 
circumstances, and we can get some very unfortunate results.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Gay-rights activists don't contend that every ex-partner's  
demand should be granted. But they do want courts at least to 
consider whether requested visitation rights might be in a child's 
best interest. 
</P>
<P>
	``We want courts to force our families to play by the very same  
rules that heterosexual couples have been forced to play by for 
decades,'' says Kate Kendell, executive director of the National 
Center for Lesbian Rights in San Francisco. ``We don't want 
anything special or different.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In Crandell's case, the California Supreme Court in July let  
stand an appeals court ruling against her. The lower court said no 
legal grounds exist for granting visitation rights to a nonparent 
over the biological mother's objection. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's the height of irony, given that California has perhaps  
more lesbian couples raising children than any other state,'' 
Kendell says. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're not talking about live-in girlfriends. We're not talking  
about a nanny. We all know a parent when we see one -- someone who 
read a child stories at night, who changed their diapers, who was 
there day in, day out, nurturing and caring.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Crandell, now 43, and her partner started living together in  
1985 when the partner's daughter was almost 3. Two years later, the 
partner gave birth to another daughter by artificial insemination. 
</P>
<P>
	The couple jointly raised the two girls until separating in  
1990. In 1994 the ex-partner demanded that Crandell cease her 
periodic visits. 
</P>
<P>
	The court ruling means Crandell cannot see the children until  
they turn 18. They are now 17 and 12. 
</P>
<P>
	Crandell hasn't ruled out trying to take her case to the U.S.  
Supreme Court, though she has modest hopes. ``Nothing has been more 
important to me than asking for my children in every possible 
way,'' she said in a telephone interview. 
</P>
<P>
	The next major ruling on the issue may come in New Jersey. The  
state Supreme Court plans hearings this fall on an appeals court's 
split decision granting a lesbian visitation rights to her former 
partner's twin toddlers. 
</P>
<P>
	The twins, a boy and girl, were born two years after the women  
began living together, and the plaintiff shared child-rearing 
duties with the biological mother. Each took turns changing 
diapers, picking up the twins from day care, rocking them to sleep. 
</P>
<P>
	To date, virtually every high-profile court case regarding  
children of same-sex partners has involved lesbians, not gay men. 
That could change, however, as liberalized adoption policies expand 
the ranks of gay fathers. 
</P>
<P>
	Although many gay-rights groups have intervened in the court  
cases to espouse the validity of same-sex partnerships, they would 
prefer that couples avoid litigation. 
</P>
<P>
	This summer, an alliance of groups published guidelines for  
same-sex couples, urging those who want children to agree in 
advance on how to solve problems that might arise if they separate. 
Options vary from state to state, but it is often possible for a 
partner to become a legal parent through guardianship or adoption. 
</P>
<P>
	``There are ways to resolve these things outside of court,''  
says Mary Bonauto, a Boston lawyer who drafted the guidelines. ``We 
have a legal system that for the most part does not acknowledge the 
legal existence of our families. So it's important that we honor 
our own agreements.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Bonauto, civil rights director for Gay and Lesbian Advocates and  
Defenders, says children of same-sex couples, and the gay-rights 
movement, can be losers when a case goes to court. 
</P>
<P>
	``It is extremely damaging to our community and our families  
when we disavow as insignificant the very relationships for which 
we are seeking legal and societal respect,'' she wrote in the 
guidelines. 
</P>
<P>
	As a positive example, Bonauto cites Joyce Kauffman, a  
lesbian-rights lawyer in Boston who settled a child-custody dispute 
with her former partner without litigation. 
</P>
<P>
	Kauffman gave birth to her daughter, Becca, as a single mother  
15 years ago, and soon afterward began a relationship that lasted 
four years. 
</P>
<P>
	When the partners broke up, and realized how distraught the  
child was, they decided to continue co-parenting. For the past 10 
years, Becca has spent half of each week with each of the women, 
who live a few blocks apart. 
</P>
<P>
	``My daughter still calls both of us Mom,'' Kauffman says. ``It  
was not my favorite thing to do, to deal with my ex-partner all the 
time. But I didn't feel I had any right to curtail my daughter's 
relationship with her. I felt morally it would have been wrong.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Kauffman is frustrated by the tactics some lesbian mothers use  
to oppose visitation rights. 
</P>
<P>
	``We've been working so hard for so many decades to gain  
respect,'' she says. ``Then to have people within our own community 
use homophobic law against other gay and lesbian people -- that 
really troubles me. If we don't respect our own relationships, how 
can we expect other people to respect them?''

<HEADLINE> Ex-Nurse Convicted in 6 Ind. Deaths </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BRAZIL, Ind. (AP) -- A former nurse was convicted of murder  
Sunday in the deaths of six patients who authorities said were 
deliberately given lethal injections at a western Indiana hospital. 
</P>
<P>
	Jurors hearing the case of Orville Lynn Majors told the judge  
they could not reach a verdict on the seventh count. 
</P>
<P>
	Majors, 38, faces a maximum of 65 years in prison on each count.  
The judge set sentencing for Nov. 15. 
</P>
<P>
	``How could they do this to him? He didn't kill anyone,''  
Majors' sister, Debbie McClelland, said as she paced the courtroom. 
</P>
<P>
	Defense attorneys said they plan to appeal the verdict.  
</P>
<P>
	``Lynn is very upset. It's very human to feel some sense of  
closure, or peace even, at the worst possible news,'' said defense 
attorney Carolyn Rader. 
</P>
<P>
	Majors had contended the patients died of the ailments that put  
them in the hospital, but prosecutors said the deaths were 
consistent with injections of potassium chloride, epinephrine or 
both. Police found containers of those drugs at Majors' house and 
in his van. 
</P>
<P>
	The patients died in a 13-month span at Vermillion County  
Hospital in Clinton. Relatives of the seven testified they saw 
Majors near the patients just before they died, and witnesses said 
they saw him give injections to four of the patients. 
</P>
<P>
	The defense called family doctors of several patients as  
witnesses, who said their patients died from the illnesses that 
brought them to the hospital. 
</P>
<P>
	Once the verdicts were read, relatives of the patients who died  
cried, hugged each other and clutched portraits of their loved 
ones. 
</P>
<P>
	``There was never a doubt in my mind,'' said Paula Holdaway,  
daughter of Dorothea Hixon, 80, one of the six patients the jury 
agreed Majors killed. 
</P>
<P>
	Prosecutor Nina Alexander said: ``That's probably the most  
satisfying part of this -- that these family members were pleased 
and maybe they can finally get some closure.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Amid the celebration, Majors' elderly parents, Orvil and Anna  
Bell, remained in their front-row courtroom seats with shocked 
expressions on their faces. 
</P>
<P>
	Prosecutors built their case around the fact that Majors was  
present, and often alone, when each patient died. 
</P>
<P>
	Jurors never saw statistical studies that linked Majors to as  
many as 130 of 147 deaths at the hospital. Special Judge Ernest 
Yelton, fearing the deluge of information would overwhelm the jury 
and bog down the trial, didn't allow prosecutors to use the 
studies. 
</P>
<P>
	The jury had heard evidence for five weeks, which included  
testimony from 79 witnesses. Twenty-three were doctors who offered 
them highly technical medical interpretations. The began 
deliberating Thursday morning, and met for a total of 33 hours. 
</P>
<P>
	The case began more than four years ago when a nursing  
supervisor became suspicious of the rising death rate in the 
hospital's intensive care unit, where Majors worked most days. 
</P>
<P>
	Some victims' family members found room for sympathy for Majors  
and his family. 
</P>
<P>
	``I hope he gets his life right with the Lord,'' said Tanya  
Cottrell, who testified she saw Majors inject her father, Freddie 
Wilson, 56, just before he died.

<TEXT>
<P>
	WILMINGTON, N.C. (AP) -- Hurricane Irene continued to track  
toward North Carolina on Sunday, bringing the potential for more 
flooding to the storm-weary state. 
</P>
<P>
	Officials reported no sustained tropical-force winds on land  
before dawn on Sunday. Sustained winds near 50 mph were clocked 
over coastal waters. Still, Irene continued to maintain sustained 
winds of 75 mph -- just above the threshold for a hurricane. 
</P>
<P>
	Topsail Beach northeast of Wilmington was ordered evacuated  
Sunday morning. Nearby Onslow Beach, under the Marine Corps' 
jurisdiction, was closed as well. A steady rain fell across the 
southeast quarter of the state. 
</P>
<P>
	Late Saturday, evacuation orders were issued for Sunset Beach  
and Ocean Isle along North Carolina's southern coast, and on Sunday 
no one was being permitted on nearby Oak Island, where Hurricane 
Floyd came ashore last month, Brunswick County emergency management 
officials said. 
</P>
<P>
	At 8 a.m. EDT Sunday, the center of the storm was about 115  
miles south of Charleston, S.C., moving north at 10 mph. A gradual 
turn toward the north-northeast, along with an increase in speed, 
was forecast for later Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	Projections from the National Hurricane Center put the ragged  
eye of the storm near Cape Romain, just northeast of Charleston, by 
Sunday afternoon. It was expected to make landfall near the North 
Carolina-South Carolina state line late Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	A hurricane warning was in effect from Savannah, Ga., to Cape  
Hatteras, N.C., and a tropical storm warning was posted for north 
of Cape Hatteras to the Virginia line and from St. Augustine Beach, 
Fla., to Savannah, Ga. 
</P>
<P>
	With a state of emergency declared by Gov. Jim Hunt for eastern  
North Carolina, officials warned that it wouldn't take much rain to 
push rivers in the eastern part of the state back above flood 
stages. A flood watch was posted for eastern North Carolina, which 
forecasters said could receive 3 to 6 inches of rain. Irene's winds 
also could threaten camper villages populated by those left 
homeless by floods from Hurricane Floyd. 
</P>
<P>
	``We just got into the mobile homes, the travel trailers,'' said  
Dorothy Murphy, among those to seek shelter Saturday night in the 
Pitt County jail gymnasium. ``Now we got to uproot again.'' 
</P>
<P>
	North Carolina also mobilized 300 National Guard troops Saturday  
to prepare for the recovery effort, and Eric Tolbert, North 
Carolina's emergency management director, said many supplies are 
already in place because of the recovery effort from Hurricane 
Floyd. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm a little concerned about personnel resources being  
strained,'' Tolbert said. ``Our personnel are obviously tired.'' 
</P>
<P>
	So far, Irene has been blamed for at least seven deaths -- two in  
Cuba and five people near Fort Lauderdale, Fla., who were 
electrocuted by downed power lines. After drenching Cuba's tobacco 
fields and collapsing buildings in Havana, the storm rolled ashore 
Friday afternoon 75 miles southwest of Miami and headed north 
through the Everglades. 
</P>
<P>
	At its worst, the storm knocked out power to more than 1.5  
million customers, according to Florida Power &AMP; Light, the state's 
largest utility. Electricity was restored to about half of them by 
midday Saturday. As much as 18 inches of wind-driven rain caused 
scattered flooding over hundreds of miles, from Key West to West 
Palm Beach. 
</P>
<P>
	Miami-Dade Mayor Alex Penelas said crop damage could total $100  
million. ``It seems about every piece of farm land is literally 
under water,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	It was a month ago Saturday that thousands of coastal residents  
returned home after fleeing Hurricane Floyd, which destroyed than 
6,000 buildings and damaged 9,000 others. At least 49 deaths and 
damage expected to exceed Hurricane Fran's record $6 billion in 
1996 were blamed on the huge storm.

<HEADLINE> Galaxy 3, Rapids 0 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PASADENA, Calif. (AP) -- Greg Vanney and Cobi Jones scored  
second-half goals Sunday as the Los Angeles Galaxy, who played a 
man down for 72 minutes, beat the Colorado Rapids 3-0 in the 
opening game of the best-of-3 MLS Western Conference semifinals. 
</P>
<P>
	Los Angeles was forced to play with just 10 players after  
midfielder Simon Elliott was ejected after receiving his second 
yellow card. His cleats hit Colorado defender Marcelo Balboa's 
thigh during an attempted tackle. 
</P>
<P>
	Elliott, who received his first yellow card from referee Marcel  
Yonan in the sixth minute for fouling defender David Vaudreuil from 
behind, will also be suspended for Game 2 under league rules. 
</P>
<P>
	Ezra Hendrickson scored in the eighth minute and Vanney made it  
2-0 with a penalty-kick goal in the 52nd minute. The Galaxy were 
awarded the penalty kick after Rapids defender Chris Martinez 
pulled down midfielder Mauricio Cienfuegos by the jersey in the 
penalty area. 
</P>
<P>
	Jones scored in the 57th minute, tapping in a loose ball after  
goalkeeper Ian Feuer deflected Clint Mathis' cross but the Rapids 
were unable to clear the ball away. 
</P>
<P>
	Kevin Hartman made seven saves for the shutout as Colorado's  
offensive woes continued. The Rapids were shut out in their final 
five regular season matches and were held scoreless for 499 
consecutive minutes, an MLS record. 
</P>
<P>
	Colorado led 14-12 in shots and 8-6 in shots on goal. Feuer made  
three saves before a Rose Bowl crowd announced at 16,307. 
</P>
<P>
	Game 2 will be played Sunday in Denver. A third game, if  
necessary, would be played Oct. 27 at the Rose Bowl.

<HEADLINE> New Technology May Automate Meters </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ROSWELL, Ga. (AP) -- No more waiting around to have the gas or  
electricity turned on. No more uniformed meter readers traipsing 
through your prized roses. And soda machines that can let their 
owners at headquarters know when they're empty. 
</P>
<P>
	A suburban Atlanta company is marketing Israeli radio technology  
that would automate hundreds of functions that could make these and 
other possibilities a reality. 
</P>
<P>
	``We keep coming up with new applications for this, and I just  
don't see an end to it,'' said Ron Sewell, president of Automated 
Network Solutions. ``It will work with anything that counts.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The technology is actually owned by Nexus, an Israeli company  
that originally developed it for military use. 
</P>
<P>
	Unregulated radio frequencies transmit short-range signals  
across a network consisting of 5-foot-high receiving antennas. 
Other companies such as wireless telephone company Nextel 
Communications Inc. are using similar technology for two-way 
communication, but ANS is bringing it to machines instead of 
people. 
</P>
<P>
	Sewell, the former Commissioner of Public Works in Lexington,  
Ky., said the fit between the technology and utilities was a 
natural. 
</P>
<P>
	``This way, we can continuously monitor usage and predict peak  
usage much more accurately,'' Sewell said. ``And any utility can 
buy into creating the network, and thereby create a revenue stream 
by letting other people use it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Earlier this year, ANS and Nexus installed a pilot project for  
Atlanta Gas Light Co. in Marietta and in southwest Atlanta, 
mounting devices about the size of a deck of cards onto existing 
meters. 
</P>
<P>
	One receiver had a range of nine miles, while the information  
received as frequently as every second is much more detailed than 
anything that can be collected by a human meter reader. 
</P>
<P>
	``The AGL people have tried to bring our system to its knees and  
they still can't,'' said Sewell, describing the vigorous testing. 
</P>
<P>
	ANS is considering installing networks in Atlanta, Columbia,  
S.C., Memphis, Tenn., Baltimore and Washington, D.C. A typical 
network costs about $2 million, compared with cellular networks 
which can cost 25 times as much. 
</P>
<P>
	Sewell said the devices on the meters can be made to turn on and  
off gas, electricity, cable television, water or anything else from 
another location, while helping technicians pinpoint trouble spots 
more accurately. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition to utilities, Sewell said the technology can be used  
to monitor and control anything from soda machines to home security 
systems. 
</P>
<P>
	ANS has yet to sign up a full-time customer.  
</P>
<P>
	A test project for Atlanta-based Coca-Cola Co. found one vending  
machine was four sodas short after a delivery, Sewell said. The 
Coca-Cola worker then pulled the sodas out of her bag and said she 
had bought them on the way over, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Rusty Gordon, CEO of Ifleet, Inc., said his client PepsiCo Inc.  
was equally impressed, especially since most soda trucks bring back 
an average of 50 percent of their stock. 
</P>
<P>
	``They can get real-time updates of which machines have what in  
stock, and load their trucks appropriately and increase 
productivity tenfold,'' said Gordon, whose Alpharetta company 
provides information services for the delivery industry. ``There's 
no way to overestimate how powerful it can be to manage your fleet 
and physical assets from the same central information gathering 
point. 
</P>
<P>
	``It just boggles the mind how far this can go.''

sedan. But hidden under motorized panels in the rear is a small 
pickup bed. 
</P>
<P>
	GMC TERRADYNE: A five-passenger, four-door truck, the Terradyne  
is built for working. The pickup bed stretches 1 1/2 feet; there's 
also a built-in 5,000-watt generator. 
</P>
<P>
	OPEL CVC: While Opel, GM's European arm, doesn't sell cars in  
North America, GM will show off its concept vehicle here. The small 
van includes a glass roof with a storage box for gloves and skis.

<HEADLINE> Ditka Makes Obscene Gesture at Crowd </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW ORLEANS (AP) -- New Orleans coach Mike Ditka made an obscene  
gesture to taunting fans when he left the field at halftime Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	Ditka, who has not been the target of much fan criticism since  
becoming New Orleans coach in 1997 despite back-to-back 6-10 
records, was booed loudly and taunted Sunday after a botched play 
ended the first half, although the Saints were leading Tennessee 
10-0. The Titans came back to win 24-21. 
</P>
<P>
	With 12 seconds left and no timeouts, the Saints had  
first-and-goal from the 1. They ran Ricky Williams up the middle 
for no gain and then watched the clock run out. 
</P>
<P>
	The fans booed as the team left the field and Ditka made a  
finger gesture to them. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't appreciate that,'' Ditka said of the boos, then added,  
``the fans have a right to do anything they want.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Saints' loss was the fourth time this season New Orleans  
(1-4) has blown a lead in the last half and lost. The small crowd 
remaining in the Superdome at the end of the game again jeered 
Ditka and the players as they left the field. 
</P>
<P>
	As the coach walked past. Ditka stopped, turned toward them and  
grabbed his crotch, then went to the locker room.

	At 8 a.m. EDT Sunday, the center of the storm was about 115  
miles south of Charleston, S.C., moving north at 10 mph. A gradual 
turn toward the north-northeast, along with an increase in speed, 
was forecast for later Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	Projections from the National Hurricane Center put the ragged  
eye of the storm near Cape Romain, just northeast of Charleston, by 
Sunday afternoon. It was expected to make landfall near the North 
Carolina-South Carolina state line late Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	A hurricane warning was in effect from Savannah, Ga., to Cape  
Hatteras, N.C., and a tropical storm warning was posted for north 
of Cape Hatteras to the Virginia line and from St. Augustine Beach, 
Fla., to Savannah, Ga. 
</P>
<P>
	With a state of emergency declared by Gov. Jim Hunt for eastern  
North Carolina, officials warned that it wouldn't take much rain to 
push rivers in the eastern part of the state back above flood 
stages. A flood watch was posted for eastern North Carolina, which 
forecasters said could receive 3 to 6 inches of rain. Irene's winds 
also could threaten camper villages populated by those left 
homeless by floods from Hurricane Floyd. 
</P>
<P>
	``We just got into the mobile homes, the travel trailers,'' said  
Dorothy Murphy, among those to seek shelter Saturday night in the 
Pitt County jail gymnasium. ``Now we got to uproot again.'' 
</P>
<P>
	North Carolina also mobilized 300 National Guard troops Saturday  
to prepare for the recovery effort, and Eric Tolbert, North 
Carolina's emergency management director, said many supplies are 
already in place because of the recovery effort from Hurricane 
Floyd. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm a little concerned about personnel resources being  
strained,'' Tolbert said. ``Our personnel are obviously tired.'' 
</P>
<P>
	So far, Irene has been blamed for at least seven deaths -- two in  
Cuba and five people near Fort Lauderdale, Fla., who were 
electrocuted by downed power lines. After drenching Cuba's tobacco 
fields and collapsing buildings in Havana, the storm rolled ashore 
Friday afternoon 75 miles southwest of Miami and headed north 
through the Everglades. 
</P>
<P>
	At its worst, the storm knocked out power to more than 1.5  
million customers, according to Florida Power &AMP; Light, the state's 
largest utility. Electricity was restored to about half of them by 
midday Saturday. As much as 18 inches of wind-driven rain caused 
scattered flooding over hundreds of miles, from Key West to West 
Palm Beach. 
</P>
<P>
	Miami-Dade Mayor Alex Penelas said crop damage could total $100  
million. ``It seems about every piece of farm land is literally 
under water,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	It was a month ago Saturday that thousands of coastal residents  
returned home after fleeing Hurricane Floyd, which destroyed than 
6,000 buildings and damaged 9,000 others. At least 49 deaths and 
damage expected to exceed Hurricane Fran's record $6 billion in 
1996 were blamed on the huge storm.

<P>
	WILMINGTON, N.C. (AP) -- Hurricane Irene continued to track  
toward North Carolina early Sunday, bringing the potential for more 
flooding in the storm-weary state. 
</P>
<P>
	Irene continued to maintain sustained winds of 75 mph -- just  
above the threshold for a hurricane. Forecasters said little change 
in strength was expected. 
</P>
<P>
	At 2 a.m. EDT Sunday, the center of the storm was about 185

<P>
	New Hanover County, N.C. officials opened two shelters Saturday  
night, and were advising people to leave beach communities. 
</P>

	With a state of emergency declared by Gov. Jim Hunt, officials  
considered evacuations and warned that it wouldn't take much rain

<HEADLINE> Tokyo Stocks Fall in Early Trading / Japanese Stocks  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TOKYO (AP) -- Japanese stocks fell broadly in early trading  
Monday after last week's sell-off on Wall Street. The dollar fell 
against the yen. 
</P>
<P>
	The benchmark 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average shed 189.58 points,  
or 1.09 percent, to 17,411.99 in the first hour of trading. On 
Friday, the index shed 178.69 points, or 1.00 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	The dollar bought 105.38 yen, down 0.40 yen from late Friday in  
Tokyo and also below its late New York level of 105.42 yen, also on 
Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	In Tokyo, share prices moved lower as sentiment was dampened by  
a sharp fall on Wall Street Friday after Federal Reserve Chairman 
Alan Greenspan expressed concern about U.S. stock prices. 
</P>
<P>
	On Friday, the Dow Jones industrial average lost 266.90 points,  
or 2.6 percent, to close at 10,019.71. At one point, the Dow 
slipped below 10,000 points. The average also recorded its worst 
weekly point drop in history, plummeting 630.05 points, or 5.9 
percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Traders in Tokyo said there was broad selling across the  
banking, brokerage, retail and high-technology sectors in early 
trading. 
</P>
<P>
	``Wall Street is expected to fall further for technical reasons,  
so it is difficult to go bargain hunting now,'' said Sachio 
Ishikawa, general manager of the stock division at Chuo Securities. 
</P>
<P>
	Greenspan's comments late Thursday suggesting that the stock  
market's great rally might abruptly end, were taken by many to mean 
the Fed would likely raise interest rates at its next Federal Open 
Market Operations meeting on Nov. 16. 
</P>
<P>
	The broader Tokyo Stock price index of all issues listed on the  
first section was down 35.96 points, or 2.44 percent, to 1,474.30. 
The TOPIX fell 26.48 points, or 1.72 percent, on Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	In currency dealings, traders said the dollar was under selling  
pressure amid nervousness over U.S. asset markets. 
</P>
<P>
	That pressure came after inflation fears resulting from the  
announcement Friday that U.S. wholesale prices rose 1.1 percent in 
September, far above the market estimate of 0.5 percent, spurred 
sales of the U.S. currency in New York by fueling further 
speculation that the Fed will raise lending rates next month. 
</P>
<P>
	In other currencies, the euro was trading at 115.21 yen, up from  
114.96 yen late Friday in Tokyo. 
</P>
<P>
	The yield on the benchmark 10-year Japanese government bond  
stood at 1.8150 percent, unchanged from Friday's close. Its price 
remained at 99.01 yen.

<HEADLINE> Artist Ofili Unveils 5 New Works </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Artist Chris Ofili, whose controversial work has  
prompted protests and earned the wrath of the mayor, has unveiled 
five new works. 
</P>
<P>
	The ``Afrobiotics'' exhibit opened Saturday at the Gavin Brown  
gallery. At the opening, Ofili had no comment about the 
``Sensations'' exhibit at the Brooklyn Museum of Art, which 
includes his painting ``The Holy Virgin Mary.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The painting depicts a black Madonna decorated with elephant  
dung. 
</P>
<P>
	Mayor Rudolph Giuliani has blasted it as ``sick'' and cut off  
all city funding to the museum. The museum has sued to get the 
funding back. 
</P>
<P>
	Ofili's new works include an abstract painting, and  
portrait-like paintings of a man and a woman.

<P>
	TALLADEGA, Ala. (AP) -- It shouldn't take Ricky Rudd long to get  
used to this teamwork thing. 
</P>
<P>
	Rudd, who is quitting his role as an owner-driver after this  
year to take a job with Robert Yates Racing, was helped Sunday by 
his soon-to-be employer to a third place finish in the Winston 500. 
</P>
<P>
	Yates, a noted engine-builder, gave Rudd one of his engines  
earlier this week to use at Talladega Superspeedway and the high 
horsepower helped Rudd tie his season-best finish. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's really the teamwork that helped. I haven't had the luxury  
of teamwork before,'' Rudd said. ``It went beyond the motor. It was 
horsepower and handling, it was a combination of things that made 
our car go fast and gave me a new perspective on how to race here 
at Talladega.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Rudd, who will be teamed with Dale Jarrett next year, said  
Jarrett's crew helped him all weekend with his chassis set-up and 
stopped by his motor home Saturday night to go over some last 
minute strategies. 
</P>
<P>
	``I can't say enough about this Yates team,'' Rudd said. ``All  
the help they gave us, it's made me come around and understand the 
value of teammates.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Rudd, who runs a single-car operation, still needs a win this  
year to keep his streak alive of winning at least one race in 17 
straight seasons. With a little more help from Yates, he might just 
make it. 
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	STREAK SNAPPED:@ The Winston 500 marked the first race Jeff  
Gordon hasn't won since Brian Whitesell took over as his crew 
chief. 
</P>
<P>
	Whitesell was promoted to the job three weeks ago when Ray  
Evernham left to start his own team. The transition was smooth -- 
Gordon won back-to-back races under Whitesell. 
</P>
<P>
	But the streak stopped Sunday when Gordon finished 12th.  
</P>
<P>
	It wasn't all bad for the three-time Winston Cup Champion,  
though. Gordon won three awards on Sunday -- most laps led (71), 
fastest lap while leading (194.523 mph) and the Hard Charger Award 
for racing in the top three positions most consistently. 
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	 *NO BULL WINNERS:* For only the second time in its promotional  
history, none of the eligible drivers won the No Bull 5. 
</P>
<P>
	The bonus program would have paid $1 million to any of five  
drivers if they won on Sunday. The series sponsor had previously 
paid out the money in six of the last seven races it was offered. 
</P>
<P>
	The eligible quintet -- Jeremy Mayfield, Jeff Burton, brother  
Ward Burton, Mark Martin and Kevin Lepage -- earned the opportunity 
to go for the big money by finishing in the top five in September 
in the Southern 500. 
</P>
<P>
	Ward Burton came the closest to winning Sunday, finishing  
fourth. 
</P>
<P>
	Jeff Burton has won two of the five $1 million bonus races this  
season -- the Pepsi 400 July and in the Southern 500 last month. He 
wound up eighth. 
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	 *CRASH VICTIMS:* Tim Steele and Anthony Lazzaro were both still  
hospitalized Sunday after being injured in Saturday's Winn Dixie 
300 ARCA race. 
</P>
<P>
	Lazzaro was being treated for a fractured vertebrae in his upper  
back that would not require surgery. He was scheduled to be 
released from the hospital on Monday, then travel to Indianapolis 
for another examination. 
</P>
<P>
	Steele, a three-time ARCA series champion, was being treated for  
a concussion. 
</P>
<P>
	Three other drivers were taken to the hospital, but had been  
released by Sunday. Mark Stahl was treated for broken ribs, Norm 
Benning had a badly bruised ankle and Mike Ciochetti had a bruised 
shoulder. 
</P>
<P>
	All but Steele were injured in a six-car crash on the  
backstretch that began when Lazzaro and 1999 series champion Bill 
Baird banged together. 
</P>
<P>
	Lazzaro, the 1999 Toyota-Atlantic Series champion who was making  
his first ARCA start, is scheduled to become a regular in NASCAR's 
Busch Series next season. 
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	 *SHORT TRACK SPONSOR:* Exide Corp. said Sunday it would sponsor  
next year's ShortTrack Series, the second tier of the NASCAR Weekly 
Racing Series. 
</P>
<P>
	The Exide ShortTrack Series competes weekly at 100 dirt and  
asphalt tracks in 39 different states. The tracks range in size 
from .250-miles to .626-miles. 
</P>
<P>
	NASCAR star Jeff Burton used it as a springboard in the early  
part of his career, racking up 21 NWRS wins. 
</P>
<P>
	``The NWRS is a great place to gain the necessary experience you  
need to move up,'' Burton said. ``I learned an awful lot competing 
on that level.''

<HEADLINE> Presidential Yacht on Auction Block </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	VIRGINIA BEACH, Va. (AP) -- For the right price, you could sail  
away with a piece of presidential history. 
</P>
<P>
	The Sequoia, a yacht used by eight presidents from Hoover to  
Ford, is being sold on ``Treasures in Your Home,'' a live 
collectibles show on PAX TV and the Internet. 
</P>
<P>
	The yacht hit the auction block for display on Oct. 6. Bids will  
be accepted through Oct. 26 through the show's Website, 
www.paxtv.com. As of Friday, the Web page featuring the yacht had 
been viewed almost 5,000 times. 
</P>
<P>
	But there were no bidders.  
</P>
<P>
	The minimum to open bidding is $1.55 million, but even that  
won't be enough. The owners have established a higher reserve, or 
amount they will accept for the purchase. That figure is 
confidential. 
</P>
<P>
	The show's online auctions usually last a week, but this time  
the producers of the show have requested more time to give 
potential bidders a chance to reflect. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's such a highly priced item,'' said Larry Ferber, an  
executive producer. ``It's not like you sit there and go, `Sure, I 
have a million-five, I'll open the bidding.''' 
</P>
<P>
	``Treasures in Your Home'' is broadcast live five nights a week  
from a set at religious broadcaster Pat Robertson's Christian 
Broadcasting Network. 
</P>
<P>
	The yacht is by far the most expensive item that has been up for  
bid since the show premiered Aug. 9, Ferber said. The show has 
auctioned a couple cars for around $18,000 each, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	The yacht, 100 feet long and 18 feet wide, was built in 1925.  
Herbert Hoover went on fishing cruises with it, and Franklin D. 
Roosevelt had the yacht officially commissioned as a presidential 
yacht in 1933. Over the decades it also was used by presidents 
Truman, Eisenhower, Kennedy, Johnson, Nixon and Ford. 
</P>
<P>
	Jimmy Carter had it sold at public auction in 1977 for $286,000.  
</P>
<P>
	From there, it went through a handful of owners until the  
Presidential Yacht Trust took title in 1985. The following year, 
the yacht went to the Norfolk Shipbuilding and Drydock Corp. for an 
overhaul. 
</P>
<P>
	If the reserve is not met by Oct. 26, the yacht will be taken  
off the auction block, Ferber said. ``That's it,'' he said. ``It 
sails away.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Sequoia Presidential Yacht Foundation, a nonprofit  
organization based in Alexandria, would like to buy the yacht, but 
not for anywhere near $1.5 million-plus. The group wants to dock 
the yacht at the Navy yard in Washington, D.C., and keep it 
operational. 
</P>
<P>
	``We think it's a national historic property,'' said Ben Brown,  
the foundation's president, who was on the boat when he was a 
military aide in the Johnson White House. ``It belongs really to 
the American people. It's a floating White House.''

<HEADLINE> Irene Brings More Floods to N.C. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WILMINGTON, N.C. (AP) -- Hurricane Irene drenched southeastern  
North Carolina with nearly half a foot of rain Sunday as it churned 
up the coast, unleashing more flooding in a region still saturated 
by record floodwaters from Hurricane Floyd. 
</P>
<P>
	A flurry of beach town evacuations preceded the storm, North  
Carolina's third hurricane in two months. Torrential rains in front 
of Irene's core swamped dozens of roads, and National Guard troops 
were called out to sandbag against rising flood waters. 
</P>
<P>
	The National Hurricane Center in Miami said there was a chance  
Irene and its 75 mph winds might skirt the North Carolina coast 
without coming ashore. ``It's too close to call,'' said 
meteorologist Bill Frederick. 
</P>
<P>
	A tornado spawned by the hurricane touched down near Elizabeth  
City in northeastern North Carolina around 7 p.m. Authorities said 
it had downed power lines and trees, and may have damaged some 
mobile homes in the area. No injuries were reported. 
</P>
<P>
	The greatest concern was rain, not wind, and the eastern coastal  
plain, inundated by Hurricane Floyd just four weeks ago, was 
especially vulnerable to more flooding. 
</P>
<P>
	Up to 5 1/2 inches had fallen in parts of eastern North Carolina,  
with several more inches possible, said the National Weather 
Service. 
</P>
<P>
	State public safety secretary Richard Moore said the worst  
flooding was expected in the Fayetteville area and along the Cape 
Fear River, expected to crest 20 feet above flood stage later this 
week. 
</P>
<P>
	No deaths had been reported in association with the storm in  
North Carolina by Sunday night. Irene has been blamed for seven 
deaths, five of them in Florida and two in Cuba. 
</P>
<P>
	A flash flood warning was issued for a 100-mile-by-50-mile swath  
of eastern North Carolina straddling Interstate 95 between 
Fayetteville and Rocky Mount. Gale-force winds were measured at the 
coast, and a tornado was reported by radar over Jacksonville on 
Sunday morning. 
</P>
<P>
	Irene initially was expected to come ashore near the South  
Carolina line Sunday night, but then it picked up speed and tacked 
to the northeast, a path that may guide it along the coast. At 8 
p.m., it was 65 miles south of Wilmington, moving northeast at 18 
mph. 
</P>
<P>
	A hurricane warning was posted from north of Edisto Beach, S.C.,  
to Cape Hatteras. A tropical storm warning was in effect north of 
Cape Hatteras to Virginia. 
</P>
<P>
	An evacuation order was issued for several beach towns near  
Wilmington, and people living in low-lying areas and mobile homes 
were encouraged to seek shelter. Many left homeless by Floyd were 
evacuated from temporary trailer villages to shelters. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm getting to the point where I can't take it any more,''  
said Herbert Person Jr., 48, who lost his Princeville home and was 
living in a government trailer park when he was evacuated to a 
shelter. ``I've worked hard all my life and paid taxes, and now I 
feel like I have nothing.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The prospect of more flooding from Irene disheartened others  
still recovering from Floyd, which drenched eastern North Carolina 
with up to 20 inches of rain on Sept. 16. 
</P>
<P>
	``I can only imagine the frustration and anxiety I have seen on  
people's faces, having to move again into shelters and not knowing 
what they will find when they go back,'' said Moore. ``It's 
devastating.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The American Red Cross reported at least 410 people were staying  
at 40 shelters Sunday night. 
</P>
<P>
	State officials prepared for Irene by activating 300 National  
Guardsmen, opening 39 Guard armories and putting 10 water rescue 
teams on standby in anticipating of flooding. 
</P>
<P>
	Because of Floyd's destructiveness -- at least 49 deaths and some  
6,000 homes destroyed and billions in damages -- people were taking 
Irene very seriously, Moore said. 
</P>
<P>
	``If anything, people are going to err on the extreme side of  
caution,'' he said, adding that heavy rainfall could keep eastern 
North Carolina rivers above flood stage all week. 
</P>
<P>
	In South Carolina, dozens of church services were canceled, draw  
bridges were locked down and the Charleston International Airport 
was closed. Up to 6 inches of rain fell in parts of the state. 
</P>
<P>
	Across the state line, Catherine Angel and her four children  
loaded up with steaks and videos in Wrightsville Beach outside 
Wilmington. She said the oil lamp and floating candles were ready, 
too. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's just the primitive nature of man to huddle around the  
campfire when nature's threatening. It's just the beach version,'' 
she said. 
</P>
<P>
	At Carolina Beach south of Wilmington, the boardwalk was  
deserted and the go-carts were lashed together at a nearby 
amusement park, closed for business. 
</P>
<P>
	Jack Tucker looked out over the empty Carolina Bingo hall, where  
he was helping out Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think even the flies are gone today,'' he said.

Mets' bullpen to keep their season alive for at least another day. 
</P>
<P>
	It almost wasn't enough.  
</P>
<P>
	After 11 scoreless innings of relief, the Braves broke through  
against Octavio Dotel in the 15th inning Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	Just when it looked like New York's season would end three games  
short of a possible Subway Series, the Mets broke through in the 
bottom of the 15th to win 4-3 in the longest postseason game in 13 
years. 
</P>
<P>
	While Robin Ventura provided the game-winning hit with the bases  
loaded, it was the Mets' bullpen that deserved much of the credit 
for making it possible. 
</P>
<P>
	``Everybody did their job,'' reliever John Franco said. ``From  
the first guy in the bullpen to the last guy in the bullpen, 
everybody contributed. From a starter in Kenny Rogers to Dotel who 
hadn't pitched in a while.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Trailing Atlanta 3-1 in the best-of-7 series, Bobby Valentine  
managed the game as if it were the Mets' last -- which it almost 
was. 
</P>
<P>
	Valentine set a postseason record by using nine pitchers --  
including four in a four-batter span in the seventh inning -- after 
starter Masato Yoshii was knocked out with no outs in the fourth 
inning. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've been in long games, but not in games where every pitch  
meant so much from the fourth inning on,'' Valentine said. 
</P>
<P>
	That maneuvering left Valentine with just Dotel in the bullpen  
after Game 2 starter Rogers pitched the 11th and 12th innings. 
</P>
<P>
	``When it got to be extra innings, I knew that I would probably  
get in the game if we didn't score,'' Rogers said. ``You know you 
can't give up a run. We had no room for error. It was an 
unbelievable win for us.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Dotel shut down the Braves for his first two innings, escaping  
in the 13th when Lockhart was gunned down at the plate trying to 
score from first on Chipper Jones' double to right. 
</P>
<P>
	Had Ventura not broken the 3-3 tie, Game 4 starter Rick Reed  
would have pitched the 16th. 
</P>
<P>
	That Valentine and the Mets relied so heavily on the bullpen  
should come as no surprise, as it was one of the strengths of the 
team all year. 
</P>
<P>
	The Mets took an NL-record 119 games to throw their first  
complete game, but with one of the best bullpens in the league, New 
York remained in contention. Mets relievers went 31-19 with a 3.67 
ERA on the year. 
</P>
<P>
	But they didn't pitch any more important innings than they did  
Sunday. After Yoshii gave away a 2-0 lead in the fourth inning, 
Orel Hershiser came in and got out of a first-and-second, no-out 
jam. 
</P>
<P>
	In his second relief appearance this decade, Hershiser struck  
out Andruw Jones and Eddie Perez before getting Walt Weiss to 
ground out. 
</P>
<P>
	Mets relievers would pitch in and out of trouble until  
Lockhart's hit in the 15th. The Braves stranded a playoff-record 19 
runners -- 18 against the bullpen -- and were 1-for-13 with runners 
in scoring position after Yoshii left. 
</P>
<P>
	``The whole bullpen did everything they could and was patient  
and waited for our offense,'' Hershiser said. ``Our offense clicked 
just in time.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Hershiser struck out Brian Jordan to end the fifth with two men  
on, before facing real trouble in the sixth. He loaded the bases 
with one out on an error by first baseman John Olerud and two 
walks. 
</P>
<P>
	With Greg Maddux at the plate, Braves manager Bobby Cox called  
for a squeeze bunt on a 1-2 count. Maddux bunted through the pitch 
and Ryan Klesko was caught in a rundown to end the inning. 
</P>
<P>
	Hershiser left after hitting Bret Boone with one out in the  
seventh. That's when Valentine really put his relievers to work, 
using four in a four-batter span. 
</P>
<P>
	Turk Wendell struck out Chipper Jones on three pitches, with  
pinch-runner Otis Nixon stealing second on the last pitch. After 
Wendell fell behind Jordan 2-0, Valentine brought in Dennis Cook to 
complete the intentional walk. 
</P>
<P>
	By bringing in the left-hander then, Valentine could take Cook  
out as soon as Bobby Cox pinch hit for the lefty-swinging Klesko. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't ask questions,'' Cook said. ``I just pitch when they  
tell me to pitch.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Pat Mahomes came on and walked pinch-hitter Brian Hunter before  
getting Andruw Jones to fly out to left. 
</P>
<P>
	Franco came on with two on and two outs in the eighth and got  
Lockhart to ground out. Franco pitched a scoreless ninth and 
Armando Benitez pitched the 10th.

<HEADLINE> Albright: US Will Honor Nuke Treaty </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Senate's rejection of a treaty to ban  
nuclear testing has ``hurt us internationally'' and cost the United 
States its leadership in the movement to stop nuclear 
proliferation, Secretary of State Madeleine Albright says. 
</P>
<P>
	In practice, however, the failure to ratify will have no effect  
on the U.S. nuclear weapons program, she said Sunday: America will 
continue to honor the treaty's ban on testing. 
</P>
<P>
	A leader of the anti-treaty senators, meanwhile, said the Senate  
again will defeat the treaty if President Clinton tries to resubmit 
it for ratification. 
</P>
<P>
	Albright, interviewed on CNN's ``Late Edition,'' said  
Wednesday's 51-48 Senate vote against the Comprehensive Test Ban 
Treaty -- far below the 67 votes needed to ratify -- mystified her 
colleagues around the world. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've gotten calls all week, ... four of my fellow foreign  
ministers, trying to figure out what has happened here,'' she said. 
``It's very serious. It has hurt us internationally.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``What we've lost for the time being is the real international  
leadership in terms of trying to make others live up to the CTBT,'' 
she said. 
</P>
<P>
	``But I want to assure all your viewers, around the world, that  
the United States is going to live up to the conditions of the 
treaty.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Albright did not say whether the administration would submit the  
pact for the Senate to reconsider its first rejection of a major 
pact since the League of Nations treaty in 1920. 
</P>
<P>
	White House chief of staff John Podesta noted on ABC's ``This  
Week'' that ``the treaty remains before the Senate.'' The 
administration will ``continue to press the Senate to consider it 
and to respond to the arguments that have been made,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Two leading treaty opponents, Sens. Jon Kyl, R-Ariz., and James  
Inhofe, R-Okla., saw no chance of reconsideration. 
</P>
<P>
	``It will not come up again, because the United States cannot  
unilaterally amend the treaty,'' Kyl said on ABC. ``It will not 
come up again, and if it does, it will be defeated.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Inhofe suggested that Clinton's problem was that he failed to  
inform the Senate before he signed the treaty in 1996. That way, he 
said, the Senate would have made clear it never would have given 
its advice and consent required under the Constitution for a 
treaty's ratification. 
</P>
<P>
	``What the president should have done,'' Inhofe said, ``is come  
to the Senate first and say, `This is what we want to do. ... Do 
you think that this is going be consented to by the Senate, if we 
do promulgate this?''' 
</P>
<P>
	Because of the treaty's flaws in enforcement, the answer would  
have been no, Inhofe said. 
</P>
<P>
	Albright said the administration was proud of its work in  
negotiating the treaty, which has been signed by 154 nations and 
ratified by 51, but by only 26 of the 44 countries potentially 
capable of producing nuclear weapons. She noted Clinton was the 
first world leader to sign it.

<HEADLINE> Jets Bench Mirer for Lucas </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	EAST RUTHERFORD, N.J. (AP) -- Rick Mirer was benched as New York  
Jets quarterback Sunday by coach Bill Parcells, with Ray Lucas 
making his first NFL start. 
</P>
<P>
	Parcells hinted during the week he might make a change at the  
position, which has been in flux since Vinny Testaverde tore his 
Achilles' tendon in the season opener. Mirer, acquired Aug. 20, was 
slow to learn the offense and was coming off a weak performance 
last Monday night against Jacksonville. He was demoted to third 
string, behind punter Tom Tupa, for the game with Indianapolis. 
</P>
<P>
	Lucas, in his third NFL season, generally has played on special  
teams. He received about half of the snaps in practice during the 
week. Lucas has appeared in nine games at quarterback for the Jets, 
but only sporadically. He has not played quarterback this year.

<HEADLINE> Chasen's Restaurant To Be Auctioned </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BEVERLY HILLS, Calif. (AP) -- A bit of bygone Hollywood  
officially passed into history as Chasen's restaurant, one of the 
movie industry's fabled eateries, went on the auction block. 
</P>
<P>
	The restaurant where Ronald Reagan proposed to his second wife  
and Jimmy Stewart held his bachelor's party was sold in bits and 
pieces Sunday as six decades of movie memorabilia was served up. 
</P>
<P>
	Chasen's, which closed in 1995, auctioned kitchen equipment,  
dishes, silverware, bar glasses and hundreds of collectible items 
such as an autographed photo of Clark Gable, a telegram from Howard 
Hughes and a booth favored by Alfred Hitchcock. 
</P>
<P>
	Tom Heyes said he ate at Chasen's 20 to 30 times, and his last  
meal there was the week the restaurant closed. Heyes snapped up a 
Chasen's menu as a memento. 
</P>
<P>
	``I came out for one last visit to walk through and look at all  
the memories of a wonderful time gone by in Hollywood,'' Heyes 
said. ``This was the last restaurant from Hollywood's golden age.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A photograph of Frank Sinatra and friends at Chasen's sold for  
$250, a signed photo of Alan Ladd went for $300 and an autographed 
picture of comedian Jerry Lewis sold for $225. 
</P>
<P>
	Brian Peck of Los Angeles said his parents brought him to eat at  
Chasen's for his 18th birthday in 1978, and they sat across from 
Sinatra. 
</P>
<P>
	``My mother was going to try to get him to come over and sing  
`Happy Birthday' all night, and my father was mortified,'' Peck 
said. ``He said he would never speak with her again if she did.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Chasen's was opened by comedian Dave Chasen as a barbecue stand  
in 1936 and grew into a glamour spot for Hollywood's elite. 
Regulars in Chasen's exclusive front room included Humphrey Bogart, 
George Burns and Gracie Allen and Jack Benny. 
</P>
<P>
	Maude Chasen, now in her 90s, continued to run the restaurant  
after her husband died in 1973. After closing, the restaurant 
licensed its name to another group which opened a new Chasen's at a 
different location. 
</P>
<P>
	Ralph Woodworth, chief executive officer of Chasen's, said  
business was still all right when the restaurant closed ``but its 
heyday had passed. Younger crowds thought it was kind of a bastion 
for their parents.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Chasen's VIP booth, reserved for the most notable diner, was on  
the auction block Sunday. The booth where Reagan proposed to future 
wife Nancy, though, is being donated to the Reagan Presidential 
Library. 
</P>
<P>
	The restaurant was sold right down to the etched windows,  
mirrors and doors. An antique tea cart went for $500. Also on the 
auction block were pianos, ice buckets, ash trays, chandeliers, a 
silver-plated serving tray used at Stewart's bachelor party and a 
booth Hitchcock liked to dine in. 
</P>
<P>
	``On a given Friday night, if the president of the United States  
walked in and asked for that booth, they would say, 'No, that's 
reserved for Mr. Alfred Hitchcock,''' said Mark Weitz, auctioneer 
for A.Z. Stein Co., which handled the Chasen's sale. 
</P>
<P>
	Chasen's was known for hearty fare. Among its specialties were  
seafood on ice, creamed spinach and the hobo steak, a sliced New 
York slab of beef cooked in butter and served on toast points with 
souffled potatoes. 
</P>
<P>
	The restaurant's chili was favored by President Kennedy and  
Elizabeth Taylor, who had it frozen and flown in to Rome during 
filming of ``Cleopatra.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Chasen's still sells its chili by telephone and via the  
Internet.

<HEADLINE> New Hope Against Spina Bifida </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NASHVILLE, Tenn. (AP) -- Seventeen-month-old David Gregory is  
beginning to form words and already is exploring the world with his 
walker with wheels. One day, his parents hope, he will walk on his 
own. 
</P>
<P>
	Spina bifida will keep David from living an ordinary life, but  
his parents believe a pioneering surgical procedure performed on 
him while he still was in the womb will dramatically improve his 
quality of life. 
</P>
<P>
	``I feel like David got the best outcome that he could have  
hoped for mobility-wise, and I feel that's probably attributable to 
the surgery,'' his mother, Becky, said from her home in Sparr, Fla. 
</P>
<P>
	Spina bifida occurs when the spinal cord is exposed early in the  
pregnancy and may result in excess fluid on the brain, bowel and 
bladder problems, clubbed feet, partial paralysis and learning 
difficulties. The defect affects about one of every 1,000 newborns 
each year. Doctors do not know what causes the condition, but they 
have found that enough folic acid in the mother's diet early in the 
pregnancy -- often before she even knows she is pregnant -- can 
prevent it. 
</P>
<P>
	About 2,000 U.S. infants are born with the condition each year.  
Roughly the same number of fetuses are estimated to be aborted 
after the condition is diagnosed. 
</P>
<P>
	To treat spina bifida, Vanderbilt University Medical Center Drs.  
Joseph Bruner and Noel Tulipan operate while the baby is in the 
womb. 
</P>
<P>
	They remove the mother's uterus and place it on her belly. After  
pulling the fetus through an incision, they locate the spinal cord 
and close tissue over the exposed area. Then they return the fetus 
to the womb and allow it to develop until the mother gives birth. 
</P>
<P>
	It is too early to know how effective Bruner and Tulipan's  
procedure is, but parents are enthusiastic, and the doctors are 
optimistic. Only half of the babies they operate on need a shunt to 
drain excess brain fluid, as compared to 95 percent in other babies 
with spina bifida. 
</P>
<P>
	For some parents, eliminating the unwieldy shunt and possibly  
countless replacement surgeries is reason enough for the surgery. 
The doctors hope the procedure will also improve brain function. 
Brain scans suggest they may. 
</P>
<P>
	``Our oldest patient is 2 1/2 years old,'' Tulipan said. ``So he's  
got another 2 1/2 years to live before he even gets to kindergarten. 
We don't know whether they're going to have learning disabilities 
or not. But there is the potential possibility that they will do 
better overall in terms of brain function.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The technique is only performed at Vanderbilt and at Children's  
Hospital in Philadelphia, but that may change. Bruner said 
Vanderbilt plans to start a training program for doctors from other 
hospitals. The first new hospital is scheduled for this year, 
Bruner said. He declined to identify it. 
</P>
<P>
	Bruner, 46, graduated and received his medical degree from the  
University of Nebraska. He has been at Vanderbilt since 1990. 
Tulipan, 48, received his bachelor's and medical degrees from The 
Johns Hopkins University in Baltimore and joined the Vanderbilt 
faculty in 1986. 
</P>
<P>
	They met in a hallway, Bruner said, and began talking about some  
promising spina bifida research on lab rats. They worked out a 
procedure to operate in utero on sheep, then adapted it to humans. 
</P>
<P>
	The first attempts were dismal failures. Using an endoscope to  
peer inside the womb, they maneuvered their instruments like 
chopsticks, leaving the womb in place while they operated on the 
fetus. Two fetuses died. One was delivered prematurely. 
</P>
<P>
	They abandoned that technique for their current one. The success  
of the method has surprised them. 
</P>
<P>
	Only one baby was stillborn, which Bruner thinks could have been  
prevented by better care at her home hospital. Another baby had to 
be delivered during the procedure, but has gone on to do well. 
</P>
<P>
	All babies that undergo fetal surgery are delivered prematurely.  
Of their 47 patients born so far, all but five were born after at 
least 30 weeks, and none has had serious complications. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's almost too good to be true,'' Bruner said. ``But we  
attribute this to the fact that what we have begun doing is 
basically elective surgery for the treatment of the fetus. ... Not 
only are our patients fairly healthy, but we can pick the time, we 
can pick the place and we can pick the patients, and as a result, 
our outcomes are very good.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In the case of David Gregory, he has not needed a shunt to drain  
brain fluid. He is beginning to talk but has trouble eating. He can 
walk with help, but lacks bladder and bowel control. He may never 
have sexual function, and, his mother said, it is too early to tell 
if he will have trouble learning, but she is hopeful. 
</P>
<P>
	``Even though these babies are high maintenance, they're really  
a joy and they really add a dimension to your life that you 
wouldn't have experienced otherwise,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	``Even with the spina bifida, that partly makes (David) who he  
is -- the fact that he is going to have to overcome pretty 
significant obstacles. He's not going to be less because he has 
spina bifida. I can already see, he's going to be more.''

<HEADLINE> Broken Finger Sidelines Cards' QB </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TEMPE, Ariz. (AP) -- Arizona quarterback Jake Plummer,  
injury-free throughout his football career until this season, will 
be out four to six weeks with a broken ring finger on his right 
hand. 
</P>
<P>
	Plummer was hurt when he was leveled by blitzing linebacker  
Shawn Barber a minute into the third quarter of the Cardinals' 
24-10 loss to the Washington Redskins on Sunday night. 
</P>
<P>
	` `I was looking the other way. I was looking back to the left.  
I was blindsided,'' Plummer said. ``I didn't even know I was hit 
until I was on my back.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Plummer's finger stuck in Barber's facemask.  
</P>
<P>
	``The hit was nothing. It was just that my finger was in the  
base of the facemask, way deep in there,'' Plummer said, ``kind of 
a freakish thing. The guy started to get up and I shouted `Hold on! 
hold on!''' 
</P>
<P>
	Barber said he didn't realize at first what had happened.  
</P>
<P>
	``I tried to get off of him real quick, and he was holding me  
down,'' Barber said. ``When I realized what was happening, I just 
eased off my helmet real slow.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Plummer's season has been star-crossed almost from the start. He  
sprained his right thumb in the second exhibition game and didn't 
play again in the preseason. The sore thumb bothered him throughout 
the first few weeks of the season. 
</P>
<P>
	When he finally was having a good game a week ago against the  
New York Giants, he was knocked out by a hip pointer early in the 
third quarter. After taking a pain-killing injection, Plummer came 
back for the final series of that game. 
</P>
<P>
	But the sore hip kept him out of practice nearly all of last  
week and he was questionable for Sunday night's game. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've played a long time without being hurt,'' Plummer said.  
``It's just bad luck I guess. There's nothing I can do about it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He said he hopes to get back quicker than the four to six weeks  
estimated by team's doctors. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm a quick healer,'' Plummer said. ``Hopefully with some  
mother remedies, I can get right back out there.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Before he was hurt Sunday, Plummer had thrown two interceptions,  
giving him 15 for the season. Champ Bailey returned his first 
interception Sunday night 59 yards for a touchdown. 
</P>
<P>
	The loss dropped the Cardinals to 2-4.  
</P>
<P>
	``With Plummer, we were the Cardiac Cardinals, we could come  
back from anything,'' wide receiver Frank Sanders said. ``Now we 
have to identify ourselves a little bit different with Dave Brown 
as quarterback.''

<HEADLINE> Vlasic Resurrects Old TV Commercial </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- If the Vlasic pickle commercial that starts  
running next month looks familiar, you may be showing your age. 
</P>
<P>
	Vlasic Foods International dug into its commercial archive in  
developing its ad plans for this fall and discovered it had a 
25-year-old commercial featuring the voice of Groucho Marx that 
still resonates with consumers. 
</P>
<P>
	The animated ad shows a cartoony grandmother, schoolboy and  
husband each taking a bite of a Vlasic pickle and then imitating 
Marx's distinctive voice and style in saying ``Now that's the best 
tasting pickle I've ever heard.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Diana Robina, head of programming for Viacom's TV Land cable  
network that carries a steady diet of program and commercial reruns 
to 42 million subscribers, said old commercials ``hit an emotional 
chord with the viewer.'' 
</P>
<P>
	That is important to advertisers who are finding it tougher to  
stand out amid the clamor of traditional TV advertising. 
</P>
<P>
	``People do stop and watch them,'' she said, referring to the  
old adsTV Land regularly carries without charge to the original 
advertisers, some of whom aren't around to pay anyway. 
</P>
<P>
	Several paying advertisers have recently brought back retired  
advertising icons like Charlie the Tuna for StarKist and Mr. 
Whipple for Charmin. Others like Maxwell House and Life cereal have 
used parts of old ads in new commercials. 
</P>
<P>
	But advertising executives were hard-pressed to name another  
advertiser who has brought back an old commercial decades after it 
had been run and used it again without alterations. 
</P>
<P>
	``We had planned to remake the ad, but when we tested it with  
consumers, it scored so well we decided not to reinvent the 
wheel,'' said Vlasic marketing executive Joe Adams. 
</P>
<P>
	He said about 15 percent of the people who were shown the ad  
remembered its run which began and ended in 1974. He said they 
mentioned they liked both the humor and the nostalgic feelings it 
evoked in them about their youth. 
</P>
<P>
	But it also scored well in the tests with viewers who either  
didn't remember it or were too young to have seen it the last time 
it ran. 
</P>
<P>
	``It worked literally as well today as it worked back then''  
Adams said. 
</P>
<P>
	Vlasic, which is based in Cherry Hill, N.J., intends to spend $5  
million to $10 million to run the ad in November and December on a 
mix of network, cable and syndicated TV programs. In addition to 
the original 30-second version, it has created a 15-second version 
using the same material. The ads may continue into the new year if 
they are well received. 
</P>
<P>
	The company is also sponsoring a contest to find a Groucho  
Marx-imitator whose voice will be used in its next ad. 
</P>
<P>
	Vlasic pickles have been the best-selling brand since 1978, the  
company says, accounting for about 32 percent of the $800 million 
market last year.

<HEADLINE> Tonya Harding Arrives for Pro Debut </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HUNTINGTON, W.Va. (AP) -- Tonya Harding thrust her hand above her  
head Sunday to give a barometer of her jitters on the eve of her 
professional figure skating debut. 
</P>
<P>
	Eight months after announcing her comeback plans, Harding's  
first competition since the 1994 Lillehammer Olympics has her 
feeling like the new kid at practice. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm very nervous. It's the first time stepping out in front of  
everybody, and I'm just like, `Oh gosh!''' Harding said. 
</P>
<P>
	The 28-year-old Harding will compete against four other women in  
the Pro Skating Championships at the Huntington Civic Arena. The 
technical program will be Monday night and the artistic program 
Tuesday afternoon. 
</P>
<P>
	The only American woman to land a triple axel in competition,  
she plans to skate with more maturity and less athleticism than 
five years ago. She still plans three triple jumps, but of an 
easier variety. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm more of a well-developed skater, more well-rounded,'' she  
said. ``I've worked at being able to connect my moves more 
gracefully.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Implicated in the 1994 attack on rival skater Nancy Kerrigan,  
Harding is banned for life from competing in an amateur event. But 
the U.S. Figure Skating Association has no jurisdiction over pro 
events. 
</P>
<P>
	After a 20-hour day and two connecting flights, Harding arrived  
at her hotel after midnight Saturday in this Ohio River city of 
60,000. 
</P>
<P>
	Across town from where her debut will take place, Harding held a  
half-hour session amid several male skaters at a smaller rink used 
for youth hockey and skating lessons. 
</P>
<P>
	Wearing a white leotard, she found it difficult adjusting to  
East Coast time and to the arena's cold conditions, often skating 
over to talk with her godmother, Linda Lewis. 
</P>
<P>
	Harding fell twice during warmup jumps on the bumpy ice. A  
run-through of her two-minute technical program went smoother. 
</P>
<P>
	``I was real stiff when I first got out there,'' she said,  
reaching for a cup of hot chocolate. ``When I warmed up, I felt 
better. Now all of a sudden I'm cold. I can't wait to go back and 
take a nap.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The show has drawn worldwide media interest yet has failed to  
sell out the 5,780-seat Huntington Civic Arena. Temperatures that 
reached 80 degrees outside Sunday hardly conjured up thoughts of 
figure skating. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's football season. The baseball playoffs are going on. It's  
too early for skating,'' said Harding's adviser, Michael Rosenberg. 
``What we've got is 25 million watching on television or reading 
about it. It's not the live crowd. In this case, it's the rest of 
the world.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The show will be broadcast on ESPN on Oct. 25, Nov. 1 and Nov.  
8. 
</P>
<P>
	Other women entered in the competition include Surya Bonaly,  
Elizabeth Manley, Tonia Kwiatkowski and Rory Burghart, the latter a 
replacement for Pasha Grischuk, who was injured in practice last 
week. 
</P>
<P>
	It also will feature competition for men, dance and pairs.

<TEXT>
<P>
	BOSTON (AP) -- Fenway Park can be a tough and very loud place for  
visiting teams. And the chants they hear can be rather creative. 
</P>
<P>
	When Cleveland's Manny Ramirez struggled in the AL division  
series, Red Sox fans launched a chorus of ``Manny's Hitless, 
Manny's Hitless.'' 
</P>
<P>
	On Saturday, after the Yankees' Roger Clemens was knocked out in  
the third inning of his fizzled pitching duel with Pedro Martinez, 
some fans sang, ``Where is Roger?'' Others answered, ``In the 
shower.'' 
</P>
<P>
	And when New York shortstop Derek Jeter came to bat in the first  
inning of Sunday night's Game 4 of the AL championship series, a 
chant rolled through the right-field seats, ``Nomar's Better. 
Nomar's Better,'' a reference to Boston shortstop Nomar 
Garciaparra. 
</P>
<P>
	Red Sox manager Jimy Williams, after three years in Boston,  
thinks he knows why the chants are so original. 
</P>
<P>
	``They've got all these colleges in this town. They've got all  
these educated people out there,'' he said. ``That doesn't surprise 
me. All these Harvard grads in town.'' 
</P>
<P>
	When Williams was third-base coach for the Braves, the Atlanta  
fans' main demonstration was the ``tomahawk chop.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``It was intimidating,'' he said.  
</P>
<P>
	Toronto fans were far less expressive when Williams managed  
there from 1986-89. 
</P>
<P>
	``Toronto?'' he asked. The crowds were so quiet, ``You used to  
be able to talk to the first-base coach.'' 
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	 *BON VOYAGE:* Yankees manager Joe Torre thinks Game 5 starter  
Orlando Hernandez can handle whatever verbal abuse Fenway fans hurl 
his way. 
</P>
<P>
	When Hernandez arrived in the United States from Cuba, his mode  
of transportation reportedly was something far less luxurious than 
a cruise ship. But it may not have been as rickety as believed. 
</P>
<P>
	``What's to scare him after leaving Cuba and having, you know,  
we really don't know what size boat he came over on,'' Torre said. 
``But whatever it was, it's still the fact that he had to slide out 
of the country and hide somewhere and then be found and all this 
kind of stuff. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's not the way we got to the ballpark, I know that.''  
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	 *CURSE THE CURSE:* Carlton Fisk didn't wait until he threw out  
the first ball Sunday to fire a high, hard one. 
</P>
<P>
	The former Red Sox catcher treated the ``Curse of the Bambino''  
like the pitch from Cincinnati's Pat Darcy he hit for the 
game-winning homer in Game 6 of the 1975 World Series. 
</P>
<P>
	Boston last won the World Series in 1918 and, after the  
following season, traded the Bambino, Babe Ruth, to the Yankees. 
Thus, the ``Curse of the Bambino.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``That's such a crock,'' Fisk said, ``it's unbelievable.''  
</P>
<P>
	If it's true that Ruth has nothing to do with Boston's  
misfortunes, the Red Sox should win Game 5 Monday night. The 
Bambino's daughter, Julia Ruth Stevens, is scheduled to throw out 
the first pitch. 
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	 *HAPPY TO BE HERE:* Kent Mercker found a quick way to go from  
fourth place to first -- get traded. That's what happened when St. 
Louis dealt Monday night's probable starter to Boston on Aug. 24. 
</P>
<P>
	``That was one of the best days of my life,'' Mercker, who  
pitched in the playoffs with Atlanta, said at a pregame news 
conference. ``The thought of me having a chance to do that again 
and pitching in games like that and talking on the podium like 
this, it's great.'' 
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	 *SIGN OF THE TIMES:*Seeing Clemens get rocked for six runs  
Saturday wasn't enough for Red Sox fans. Some of them still haven't 
forgiven him for leaving as a free agent after the 1996 season. 
</P>
<P>
	So they took their feelings out on a large canvas sign -- about 8  
feet high by 10 feet wide -- near Boston's clubhouse after the game. 
The sign commemorates Clemens' two 20-strikeout games with the Red 
Sox in 1986 and 1996. 
</P>
<P>
	Some fans tugged at it and left the bottom of it in tatters. But  
they couldn't pull it off the brick wall. Soon, four police 
officers came to stand guard by it. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're still here holding down the fort,'' one said several  
minutes later. 
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	 *SINGING AND SLINGING:*Bret wasn't the first Saberhagen to hear  
the cheers of the Red Sox crowd. His wife, Lynn, a professional 
singer, received a standing ovation when she performed the National 
Anthem. 
</P>
<P>
	Bret started Game 4 by retiring the Yankees without a run in the  
top of the first.

<P>
	FORT WORTH, Texas (AP) -- Tyce Carlson, who had nine crew members  
injured in a pit road accident, was able to compete in Sunday's 
Mall.com 500 thanks to some help from his friends. 
</P>
<P>
	PDM Racing loaned Carlson's team four crew members and Kelley  
Racing lent an engine cover. Crew chief Greg Beck said they had so 
many offers, ``we could have run every pit stop with a different 
crew.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``When tragedy strikes, we're like a big family in the garage  
area,'' said Carlson, who has driven before for PDM. 
</P>
<P>
	Carlson, who finished 13th, wasn't hurt in the accident  
Saturday, but was so shaken up he considered withdrawing. 
</P>
<P>
	He felt better by race time as only three crew members remained  
hospitalized. Two were in fair condition and one was serious, all 
with broken bones. 
</P>
<P>
	The names of the injured teammates was stenciled onto Carlson's  
No. 20 car underneath the statement ``Get Well Soon!'' 
</P>
<P>
	``These guys are not only teammates, they are also my best  
friends,'' Carlson said. ``Today's race is dedicated to them. They 
will be with me all the way.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The accident occurred when rookie Niclas Jonsson lost control of  
his car on his way back to the track. His car jerked left, hit the 
retaining wall and smacked Carlson's parked car, which was being 
tended to by the crew. 
</P>
<P>
	Jonsson, who was hospitalized briefly after suffering a slight  
concussion, said he didn't want to comment on what went wrong until 
after his car is be examined. Team co-owner Ed Rachanski said he's 
guessing it was an electrical problem. 
</P>
<P>
	Jonsson's car was damaged too badly for him to compete Sunday.  
</P>
<P>
	``I am very concerned about Tyce's crew members and I am upset  
about it,'' said Jonsson, who had qualified last for what would've 
been his second IRL start. ``I'm really sorry it happened.'' 
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	 *GOING ONCE, GOING TWICE ... :* The Indy car Jeff Ward drove in  
Sunday's Mall.com 500 could be yours, if the price is right. 
</P>
<P>
	The Dallara chassis No. 010 car owned by Pagan Racing is being  
auctioned on the Web site of team sponsor Yahoo! Would-be buyers 
had driven the price from an opening bid of $100,000 to $700,060 
shortly before the race began. The auction runs through next 
Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	Ward's engine went out on the 145th lap, ending what had been a  
strong day. He had driven the car to second at the Indianapolis 500 
and the MCI WorldCom 200 this season. 
</P>
<P>
	The car, which was previously driven by Roberto Guerrero, is  
eligible for use in the 2000 IRL season. The new owner will get it 
in the condition it finished Sunday's race. 
</P>
<P>
	``When I see race cars in a museum, if they look pristine, like  
they're brand new, I always wonder if it's the real thing,'' 
co-owner Allan Pagan said. ``If it rolls off the race track and 
into a museum, it's truly authentic.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In June, Team Pelfrey was put up for sale on the eBay Web site,  
but it came off the auction block because the opening bid was not 
met. 
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	 *WELCOME BACK:* John Paul Jr. returned to the IRL Sunday at the  
track where he earned his only victory on the circuit, but his 
chance at winning again ended early. 
</P>
<P>
	Paul had a cut right rear tire in the fifth lap. He returned 10  
laps down and finished 18th. 
</P>
<P>
	Paul was driving the Big Daddy's Beef Jerky-Cole Bros. No. 30  
car entered by McCormack Motorsports. He won last September's race 
for Jonathan Byrd-Cunningham Racing. 
</P>
<P>
	He'd been out of a ride since the team suspended operations  
after he finished 11th and 22nd in the first two races this season. 
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	 *SPEED BUMPS:* This was the IRL's fifth event in Texas, the most  
at any track in the league's four-year history. ... The race was 
supposed to be on a two-hour tape delay on ABC. But the rain delay 
ended up lasting through the expected air time, forcing it to be 
carried on ESPN2. ... Eliseo Salazar was dressed in the spirit of 
the Lone Star State, wearing pants that looked like the Texas flag. 
His right leg was blue with a white star above the knee and the 
left leg was red. ... Three-time Indy 500 winner Johnny Rutherford 
drove the pace car, as he often does for Texas races.

<HEADLINE> Spina Bifida Procedure Publicized </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NASHVILLE, Tenn. (AP) -- Drs. Joseph Bruner and Noel Tulipan have  
received accolades for their pioneering method of treating spina 
bifida in the womb but have gotten chilly reviews in some medical 
circles for their method of publicizing it. 
</P>
<P>
	Rather than waiting months or years for their procedure to be  
reviewed by peers and published in a medical journal, the 
Vanderbilt University Medical Center doctors took their story 
straight to the media. Soon, stories about them, their procedure 
and their patients started showing up in newspapers and magazines, 
and on television shows around the country. 
</P>
<P>
	Then came e-mails and phone calls from doctors criticizing them  
as media hounds more interested in self-promotion than sound 
science. 
</P>
<P>
	``We felt it was important for the public to know we were  
performing a new and innovative procedure on unborn babies,'' 
Bruner said. ``The public has a right to know about that, and we 
wanted to work with news organizations to let the public know as 
much as we could.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Though the procedure is yielding good initial results, some  
physicians are uncomfortable with the doctors going public before 
their work was reviewed by peers. 
</P>
<P>
	Among them is Dr. N. Scott Adzick, director of the Center for  
Fetal Diagnosis at Children's Hospital in Philadelphia and the only 
other doctor using a similar technique to treat spina bifida. 
``Folks can make claims about everything, and I don't think the lay 
process is the place to ferret that out,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	``My approach would not be to have reporters follow families  
through the process or have TV crews following families through the 
process because these are very vulnerable families now.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A bitter rivalry developed between Adzick and the Vanderbilt  
doctors last November when he published the results of his work in 
The Lancet, a British medical journal, and called his procedure the 
first of its kind. 
</P>
<P>
	The Vanderbilt doctors sent an angry letter to the journal  
saying they were the first, and Adzick responded by criticizing the 
doctors for using the mass media to publicize their work. 
</P>
<P>
	The acrimony has ended, both sides say, and the doctors now  
refer patients to each other. 
</P>
<P>
	Spina bifida is the nation's most common permanently disabling  
birth defect, affecting about one of every 1,000 births. It occurs 
when the skin fails to properly close over the spinal cord early in 
the pregnancy and may result in excess fluid on the brain, bowel 
and bladder problems, clubbed feet, partial paralysis and learning 
difficulties. 
</P>
<P>
	Traditionally, doctors have tried to limit its effects by  
closing the spinal cord in the first 24 hours after birth. In the 
procedure done by Bruner and Tulipan, doctors operate while the 
baby is in the womb, between 20 weeks and 28 weeks after 
conception. 
</P>
<P>
	The surgeons place the uterus on the mother's belly, pull the  
fetus out through an incision, locate the spinal cord and close 
tissue over the exposed area. The fetus is then returned to the 
womb and allowed to develop until the mother gives birth. 
</P>
<P>
	The doctors have performed about 60 operations. In about half,  
their patients have avoided the shunts almost all spina bifida 
patients need to drain fluid from the brain for the rest of their 
lives. Though it is too early to tell, Bruner and Tulipan are 
hopeful the surgery will improve brain function, too. 
</P>
<P>
	When Bruner and Tulipan began doing the procedure in April 1997,  
they planned to wait and see the results of 10 cases before they 
went public with their findings. 
</P>
<P>
	But their initial patients were so pleased they contacted media  
in their hometowns to try to raise money to help other parents get 
the procedure, which at the time was not covered by insurance. The 
doctors cooperated with the reporters. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't think that we really had a concept at the time how  
this would really capture the public imagination and how tremendous 
of an advance the public would perceive this as,'' Bruner said. 
</P>
<P>
	While the public wanted to learn about the procedure, medical  
journals were not eager to provide a forum. The New England Journal 
of Medicine rejected a paper on their technique because the results 
already had appeared on the hospital Web site. 
</P>
<P>
	Medical journals want doctors to follow tradition, presenting  
their work to their colleagues for review before any word of it is 
published. 
</P>
<P>
	When doctors go to the public without having their work verified  
and scrutinized by other doctors, ``the risk of harm (to the 
public) may actually outweigh the benefits,'' said Dr. Richard 
Glass, an interim co-editor of the Journal of the American Medical 
Association. 
</P>
<P>
	Since their paper was rejected, Bruner said, he and Tulipan have  
become more reluctant about sharing their results to prevent 
themselves from being barred by other publications. That puts them 
in a bind. As they perform more surgeries, they have more results 
to share. 
</P>
<P>
	``We now know, for example, that there are some babies that have  
better outcomes than others. There are some babies that will 
benefit tremendously from this and there are others that won't 
benefit so much,'' Bruner said. 
</P>
<P>
	``We think this is important information to get out to the  
public. Unfortunately, the turnaround time for journals is 
somewhere between one to two years. By the time the information 
that we've already submitted to journals gets published, it's going 
to be out of date. And by the time we send them new information, 
it'll be another year or two years to get it published. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's very frustrating to have information that we know is  
important for the public and that we know patients need in order to 
make reasonable decisions.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The need for speed is not lost on medical journals. The Journal  
of the American Medical Society announced in May a new ``JAMA 
Express'' process to rush information deemed critical into 
publication within six weeks, up from an average of five months. 
</P>
<P>
	Extremely critical articles can be published much faster on the  
journal's Web site. In June 1998, JAMA posted a report about a 
potentially fatal pairing of two drugs used to treat high blood 
pressure. The report hit the Web three days after it was accepted. 
</P>
<P>
	``Those things have to be considered very carefully,'' Glass  
said. ``Everybody would like things to go fast, and it's just not 
possible for everything to go that fast.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Adzick said while things move faster now, it's important for the  
peer review process to continue to ensure credibility. Tulipan 
agreed. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't think the lay press or the public is qualified to  
decide whether a procedure is effective or not,'' Tulipan said. 
Peer review is ``still the gold standard. It's still the 
benchmark.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Still, Bruner has few regrets about the methods he and Tulipan  
used. 
</P>
<P>
	``Looking back over the past few years, I can't see it happening  
any differently,'' he said. ``The only way it could have been 
different is if we refused to talk to the media altogether, and 
that would have been unfair. 
</P>
<P>
	``Back in the '50s and '60s, a lot of human experiments were  
done that were kept secret from the public and when the public 
found out, they were always upset. So we weren't going to hide what 
we were doing.''

<HEADLINE> Crime Down for 7th Straight Year </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Serious crimes reported to police declined for  
the seventh straight year in 1998, as both the murder and robbery 
rates reached lows not seen in three decades, the FBI reported 
Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	The overall violent crime rate -- 566 murders, rapes, robberies  
and assaults per 100,000 residents -- dropped to its lowest figure 
since 556 in 1985, just before an epidemic of crack cocaine sent it 
soaring. 
</P>
<P>
	The FBI report showed the use of guns to commit murder and  
robbery is decreasing. Also, one of the most terrifying crimes that 
rose along with the crack epidemic -- murder by a stranger -- dropped 
below half of all murders, to 48 percent, for only the second time 
during the 1990s. 
</P>
<P>
	The national total of seven serious violent and property crimes  
reported to 17,000 police agencies around the nation was 12,475,634 
in 1998, down 5.4 percent from the previous year and 12 percent 
since 1989, the FBI said. 
</P>
<P>
	``For seven years now we have seen serious crime go down in each  
region of the country, and in cities and towns large and small. But 
we must not become complacent,'' Attorney General Janet Reno said. 
</P>
<P>
	She credited ``more police officers on the street, greater  
partnerships between law enforcement agencies, continued efforts to 
keep guns away from criminals, and a balanced approach that 
includes prevention, intervention, punishment and supervision.'' 
</P>
<P>
	President Clinton joined the call against complacency.  
</P>
<P>
	``This is good news for America's families, and it shows we can  
indeed turn the tide on crime,'' he said. But, he added, ``even as 
crime falls, we must not let down our guard. That is why we must 
redouble our efforts to build on what works.... Together, we can 
make America the safest big nation in the world.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Republicans credited their legislation encouraging longer prison  
sentences. Criminologists also cited the aging of baby boomers past 
crime-prone years and the decline of crack markets. 
</P>
<P>
	During 1998, all violent crimes -- murder, rape, robbery and  
aggravated assault -- and all the far more numerous property crimes 
-- burglary, auto theft and larceny-theft -- dropped in both number 
and rate. 
</P>
<P>
	The violent crime rate, which adjusts for population growth, was  
down 7.3 percent, led by an 11.3 percent decline for robbery and a 
7.4 drop for murder. The aggravated assault rate was down 5.7 
percent to the lowest level in a decade. The rape rate declined 4.2 
percent to the lowest in 15 years. 
</P>
<P>
	The property crime rate fell 6.2 percent -- down 9.3 percent for  
auto theft, 6.2 percent for burglary and 5.7 percent for 
larceny-theft. 
</P>
<P>
	The murder rate of 6.3 per 100,000 residents was the lowest in  
31 years. As in 1997, it was the lowest since 6.2 in 1967. The 
robbery rate of 165.2 was the lowest in 29 years, since 148.4 in 
1969. 
</P>
<P>
	Firearms were used in 64.9 percent of murders, down from 67.8  
percent in 1997. The drop in firearm murders accounted for the 
entire drop in murders nationwide. The percentage of robberies with 
guns dipped from 39.7 to 38.2. 
</P>
<P>
	``That's a consequence of all the efforts a limiting access to  
guns by people who shouldn't have them,'' said Alfred Blumstein, a 
professor of urban systems and operations research at 
Carnegie-Mellon University in Pittsburgh who directs the National 
Consortium on Violence Research. 
</P>
<P>
	Blumstein credited big city police departments for stepping up  
searches for guns, particularly among juveniles, tracing guns to 
illegal sellers and even paying bounties to turn in guns -- as well 
as federal and state background checks to prevent sales to felons. 
</P>
<P>
	Criminologists pointed out the national figures obscured a  
lingering problem: Although teen-age murders have been cut in half 
since their peak in 1993, they remain almost twice as high as in 
1984 before crack gangs began arming some teen-agers, and their 
schoolmates got guns to copy them or to protect themselves. 
</P>
<P>
	``The crack epidemic has subsided, but we haven't taken all the  
guns out of the hands of youths,'' said James Alan Fox, professor 
of criminal justice at Boston's Northeastern University. ``Youth 
crime is down but not out.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Police have adopted smarter strategies, focusing on guns and  
high-risk juveniles, taking a preventive approach rather than 
waiting in squad cars for 911 to ring,'' Fox added. ``Communities 
are involved as never before; corporations have made jobs 
available; clergy have taken their ministry to the streets.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``But if we let our guard down, the problem could resurface with  
a vengeance, because every year for the next couple decades we're 
going to have a record number of black and Latino teen-agers, and 
they live in the most at-risk situations,'' Fox said. 
</P>
<P>
	Although there were highly publicized mass shootings by students  
at a handful of suburban or rural schools, the overall incidence of 
deadly violence at schools has been declining as well. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1998, rural areas, the last places reached by the crack  
gangs, finally joined in the decline in crime volumes and rates 
that big cities and smaller cities have seen for several years. The 
year before, rural areas had seen a 1 percent increase in crime 
total from 1996. 
</P>
<P>
	Crime also dropped in every region: down 7 percent in the  
Northeast and West, 5 percent in the South and 4 percent in the 
Midwest.

<HEADLINE> China Says Weapons Ready for Y2K </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BEIJING (AP) -- Computers at China's weapons and nuclear plants  
have been checked for the millennium bug and will be bug-free on 
New Year's Day, an official newspaper reported Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	``We can ensure all facilities in the country's defense sector  
will be safe and reliable on Jan. 1, 2000,'' the State Commission 
of Science, Technology and Industry for National Defense said in a 
report, according to the Business Weekly. A dozen groups have been 
conducting spot checks on defense equipment and production lines 
since August, the report said. 
</P>
<P>
	The Ministry of Information Industry ordered all government and  
industrial sectors that might be unable to remove millennium, or 
Y2K, bugs from their computer systems to propose emergency 
measures. 
</P>
<P>
	Such measures recently were tested by Chinese airlines. Many  
senior airline executives will fly at year's end to prove the 
planes are safe, Business Weekly said. 
</P>
<P>
	In Washington last week, Lawrence Gershwin, the CIA's national  
intelligence officer for science and technology, said China is one 
of the countries likely to suffer the greatest Y2K-related 
disruptions. 
</P>
<P>
	The Y2K problem is caused by computers that were programmed to  
read only the last two digits of a year. That will cause them to 
read the year 2000 as 1900, in some cases fouling up basic 
operations.

<HEADLINE> Missed Chances Doom Braves </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- For the Atlanta Braves, Sunday's Game 5 of the  
National League Championship Series was a frustrating string of 
missed opportunities, 15 innings of aggravation. 
</P>
<P>
	They loaded the bases in consecutive innings, both times without  
benefit of a base hit, and failed to score each time. 
</P>
<P>
	They left a record 19 runners on base -- and that doesn't include  
the one they had thrown out at the plate in the 13th inning. 
</P>
<P>
	They took the lead in the top half of the 15th and, needing just  
three outs to reach the World Series, they promptly lost to the New 
York Mets 4-3 on a grand slam that turned into a single. 
</P>
<P>
	``Baseball is a crazy game,'' sighed Walt Weiss, who thought he  
had scored the pennant winning run in the top of the 15th. 
</P>
<P>
	``Just crazy,'' said Keith Lockhart, who thought he had driven  
it in with a 15th inning triple that put Atlanta in front after 10 
frustrating innings without a run. ``You play the game. You go out 
and try to score. We finally got one for us. The mood was great. 
The momentum was great. You think, `Just get the first guy.' '' 
</P>
<P>
	The first guy was Shawon Dunston, who fought off pitch after  
pitch from Kevin McGlinchy before finally getting a single to start 
the winning rally. 
</P>
<P>
	Everything went downhill from there for the Braves.  
</P>
<P>
	McGlinchy eventually forced in the tying run on a bases-loaded  
walk to Todd Pratt and then Robin Ventura hit a ball over the wall 
to win the game. He never made it around the bases and was credited 
with a game-winning RBI single. 
</P>
<P>
	McGlinchy welcomed the challenge and opportunity to close the  
game out. The fact is, he was the last Braves pitcher available 
except for starters Kevin Millwood, who will pitch Game 6 on 
Tuesday, John Smoltz, who pitched Saturday and Tom Glavine, who 
pitched Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	``Anybody wants the ball with the game on the line,'' the rookie  
said. ``I wanted to get guys out. I had to come in to Ventura 
because I was behind in the count. It's one of those things. You 
have to forget it. Baseball is a crazy game. This was a crazy 
game.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Manager Bobby Cox gave credit to the resiliency of the Mets, who  
went from the first inning to the 15th without scoring, but still 
found a way to win. 
</P>
<P>
	``Any team, you know, you give them a chance to win,'' he said.  
``Nobody is going to give up once you've gotten this far. Nobody 
is. Every team should be that way. 
</P>
<P>
	``We missed way too many opportunities tonight. We should have  
scored many more runs. We had a few more chances than they did. 
It's not an easy way to lose a ballgame, the way we lost it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Even in the inning when the Braves scored their first two runs,  
they came away with less than they might have. 
</P>
<P>
	The bases-loaded situations might have been turning points if  
Atlanta had not wasted so many other chances. Perhaps the most 
painful came in the 13th inning when Lockhart singled with two out 
and tried to score from first on Chipper Jones' double. He was 
thrown out by at least 10 feet. 
</P>
<P>
	Batting just .198 in the first four games of the series, the  
Braves had one brief breakthrough, stringing consecutive doubles by 
Bret Boone and Jones and a single by Brian Jordan to tie the score 
2-2 in the fourth. 
</P>
<P>
	When Ryan Klesko walked, there were two on and no outs. But Orel  
Hershiser came out of the Mets bullpen to strike out Andruw Jones 
and Eddie Perez, and get Weiss on a roller to first base. 
</P>
<P>
	Atlanta's best chances came in the sixth and seventh, even  
though they never got a hit in either inning. Both times they 
loaded the bases. Both times they came away with nothing. 
</P>
<P>
	In the sixth, with pitcher Greg Maddux at bat, Cox put on the  
squeeze, despite a two-strike count. Maddux missed the bunt for 
strike three and Ryan Klesko had no chance coming down the line 
from third and was tagged out to end the inning. 
</P>
<P>
	``The ball was right down the middle,'' Cox said. ``He's never  
missed one of those. I don't know what happened. He didn't either. 
We would have been home about 3 1/2 hours ago if we got that down. But 
we missed it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	An inning later, the Braves were back, knocking on the door  
again, and again they were turned away, this time when reliever Pat 
Mahomes got Andruw Jones on a fly ball, ending the threat. 
</P>
<P>
	It was like that all night for Atlanta. Finally, in the 15th, a  
triple by Lockhart drove in Weiss with the go-ahead run. But the 
Mets weren't done. 
</P>
<P>
	When Ventura delivered the winning hit, the Braves ran out of  
chances and now they won't get anymore until Tuesday when the 
series returns to Atlanta for Game 6.

<HEADLINE>  Mandela Arrives in Syria </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DAMASCUS, Syria, (AP) -- Former South African President Nelson  
Mandela and Syria's president exchanged compliments Sunday before 
meeting privately in Syria's capital, a presidential spokesman 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Syrian President Hafez Assad praised Mandela as a freedom  
fighter respected around the world, while Mandela called Assad an 
``establishment.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``I am happy to be with a renowned and a well-known president,''  
Mandela said of Assad after receiving a red-carpet welcome at the 
airport. 
</P>
<P>
	The two later met again for formal talks, Assad's spokesman,  
Jubran Kourieh, said. He did not give details. 
</P>
<P>
	Mandela, who is touring the Middle East and meeting with top  
politicians, was in Iran earlier Sunday. He planned to go to 
Jordan, the Palestinian territories and Israel on Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	Mandela's visit to Israel was seen as a sign of reconciliation  
between the Jewish state and South Africa's anti-apartheid 
movement, which Mandela once led from a prison cell. 
</P>
<P>
	A sought-after mediator of international problems, Mandela was  
expected to encourage the Israeli-Palestinian peace process, the 
Sunday Independent reported in Johannesburg. 
</P>
<P>
	Mandela and other anti-apartheid leaders have said they shared  
the Palestinians' longing for self-determination, and noted that 
Israel helped supply military training, assault rifles and patrol 
boats to the apartheid regime. 
</P>
<P>
	In Tehran, Iran's capital, Mandela laid a wreath on the tomb of  
the late Ayatollah Khomeini, according to the official Islamic 
Republic News Agency, monitored in Dubai, United Arab Emirates. 
</P>
<P>
	Mandela praised Iran's severing of relations with South Africa's  
former apartheid government, and said ``we are indebted to the 
Islamic revolution,'' the news agency reported. 
</P>
<P>
	Mandela also met with President Mohammad Khatami and Ayatollah  
Ali Khamenei, Iran's powerful spiritual leader. 
</P>
<P>
	Mandela recently brokered the end to U.N. sanctions against  
Libya, which were imposed because of suspected Libyan involvement 
in a 1988 bombing of a Pan Am jetliner that killed 270 people.

<HEADLINE> Dolphins 31, Patriots 30 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	FOXBORO, Mass. (AP) -- Damon Huard, filling in after Dan Marino  
left early with a sore shoulder, threw a 5-yard touchdown pass to 
Stanley Pritchett with 23 seconds left Sunday to give the Miami 
Dolphins a 31-30 win over the New England Patriots. 
</P>
<P>
	Huard, who had thrown just nine passes in his first two seasons,  
replaced Marino following the Dolphins' second series. He threw an 
interception that Ty Law brought back 24 yards for a score, but 
also threw a 69-yard TD pass to Tony Martin and the 5-yard score to 
Pritchett on a 59-yard drive on which he converted three third 
downs -- a third-and-10, a third-and-9 and a third-and-5. 
</P>
<P>
	After falling behind 14-0, Olindo Mare kept Miami (4-1) in the  
game with six field goals -- breaking an NFL record by kicking four 
or more for the fourth straight game. His 53-yarder with just over 
five minutes left set the stage for Miami's final drive. 
</P>
<P>
	Huard was sacked nine times by the Patriots -- a record for the  
most allowed by the Dolphins. But he also completed 24 of 40 passes 
for 240 yards and scrambled six times for 54 yards. 
</P>
<P>
	It was the second straight last-minute victory for Miami, which  
came from behind last week in Indianapolis to win 34-31. That 
victory was engineered by Marino, the week after he was criticized 
by coach Jimmy Johnson following a 23-18 home loss to Buffalo. 
</P>
<P>
	For New England (4-2), it was the second straight last-minute  
loss. The Patriots dropped a 16-14 decision in Kansas City last 
week when Adam Vinatieri missed a 32-yard field goal in the final 
seconds. 
</P>
<P>
	Marino started Sunday but clearly was under par. He surpassed  
60,000 career yards on his only completion, an 8-yarder, but his 
second pass was intercepted by Andy Katzenmoyer and returned 57 
yards for a touchdown. The interception was forced by Lawyer 
Milloy's safety blitz. 
</P>
<P>
	Marino, who clearly couldn't throw well, was lifted after a  
short pass for Pritchett fell well short of the target. 
</P>
<P>
	Vinatieri was three-for-three Sunday, hitting from 41, 39 and 34  
yards, but he was most of the New England offense. 
</P>
<P>
	The Patriots' only offensive touchdown came on a 29-yard pass  
from Drew Bledsoe to Tony Simmons with 1:03 left in the first half. 
It was countered by Mare's 45-yarder that made it 24-19 at 
intermission.

<HEADLINE> NiSource Raises Columbia Energy Bid </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HERNDON, Va. (AP) -- NiSource Inc. has upped its offer for  
Columbia Energy Group by 9 percent, or $6 a share, to try to 
persuade Columbia to drop its vigorous, months-long efforts to fend 
off the bid. 
</P>
<P>
	NiSource, facing a deadline today to announce the results of a  
$68 a share offer initially made in June, said Sunday it would pay 
$74 a share for the Virginia company. The increase would boost the 
value of the deal to $6.1 billion from $5.7 billion. 
</P>
<P>
	The sweetened bid offers shareholders a 22 percent premium over  
Columbia's Friday's closing price of $60.50 on the New York Stock 
Exchange. 
</P>
<P>
	``Today's offer is the right price for the right company at the  
right time,'' said Gary L. Neale, NiSource's chairman, president 
and chief executive officer. ``The $74 cash per share we are 
offering is well above the value that Columbia, on its own, in any 
reasonable time frame, could provide its shareholders and allows 
Columbia shareholders to receive their share of the value created 
by the combination of the two companies.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The offer expires at midnight Nov. 12.  
</P>
<P>
	In an overture to Columbia's management, Neale said Columbia  
Energy Chairman Oliver G. Richard III would become vice chairman of 
the combined company, and that he and four other members of 
Columbia's board would be invited to join an expanded NiSource 
board. 
</P>
<P>
	NiSource, based in Merrillville, Ind., said its bid has received  
``substantial'' support from Columbia shareholders, with 44.4 
million shares, or nearly 54 percent, agreeing to the offer, as of 
midnight Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	In a statement Sunday, Columbia Energy said its board would  
review the higher offer but urged shareholders not to act before 
the board had made a recommendation. 
</P>
<P>
	Maria Hibbs, a spokeswoman for NiSource, said size and geography  
are becoming increasingly critical to succeeding in the changing 
energy industry. She said NiSource and Columbia Energy would make a 
good fit in a natural gas distribution corridor stretching from the 
Chicago market to New England. 
</P>
<P>
	Last week, Columbia launched a final appeal to shareholders to  
reject the previous NiSource bid. The Herndon-based company also 
paid for ads in Indiana newspapers claiming that the buyout would 
harm consumers there. 
</P>
<P>
	``Shouldn't NiSource be spending its time and money trying to  
reduce harmful smokestack emissions and protecting the welfare of 
its customers and communities in Indiana?'' said one ad, which 
accused NiSource of having a ``disturbing environmental record.'' 
</P>
<P>
	NiSource is the parent company of Northern Indiana Public  
Service Co. and Bay State Gas Co. in Massachusetts. It would become 
one of the nation's biggest natural gas companies if the takeover 
succeeds. 
</P>
<P>
	Columbia Energy is involved in natural gas exploration,  
production, transmission, storage and distribution as well as 
propane sales and electric power generation, sales and trading. 
</P>
<P>
	In April, Columbia Energy attempted to buy Pittsburgh-based  
Consolidated Natural Gas. But CNG rejected the offer and chose to 
proceed with a previously planned merger with Richmond, Va.-based 
Dominion Resources Inc.

<HEADLINE> Forbes, Dole Target GOP Women </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SEATTLE (AP) -- Steve Forbes and Elizabeth Dole, trying to make  
headway against the juggernaut of Republican front-runner George W. 
Bush, on Sunday urged GOP women activists to give a second look at 
their bids for the White House. 
</P>
<P>
	Forbes, a conservative publisher able to tap his personal wealth  
to challenge Bush, presented himself as a reform-minded 
``independent outsider'' who offers more substance and specific 
positions than Bush. 
</P>
<P>
	He drew repeated ovations from the 2,000 delegates at the  
National Federation of Republican Women's last convention before 
the 2000 elections. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Dole got a heroine's welcome at the convention a few hours  
later. She was introduced as a lifelong trailblazer and the first 
woman with a credible shot at a major party presidential 
nomination. 
</P>
<P>
	Federation President Mary Jo Arndt of Illinois urged delegates  
to write out a generous check to Mrs. Dole, even if they support 
Bush or someone else, as a tribute to her courage. 
</P>
<P>
	Neither candidate, however, got the star treatment given Friday  
night to Bush, the governor of Texas, who has a commanding lead in 
the polls and has broken all fund-raising records. The audience for 
Bush's speech was considerably larger than those who stuck around 
for Forbes and Mrs. Dole on Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	But the two candidates showed no sign of preparing to quit the  
race. 
</P>
<P>
	Forbes was the more aggressive in taking on Bush and a  
Democratic candidate, Vice President Al Gore. He appeared to lump 
the two together at one point, complaining about the ``gap, the 
disconnect, between the political culture'' and ordinary citizens. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Dole was the sentimental favorite of the convention,  
though. She was surrounded by autograph-seekers and well-wishers as 
she sat at the block-long head table. 
</P>
<P>
	She was repeatedly interrupted with applause as she gave her  
standard campaign speech, complete with stories from the campaign 
trail and numerous references to ``my husband, Bob,'' the 1996 GOP 
nominee. 
</P>
<P>
	She said more than half her contributors are women -- an aide  
called her ``the only candidate with no gender gap'' -- and that her 
campaign has attracted young people and others who rarely get 
involved in politics. She was introduced as ``one of America's most 
powerful and admired women, always ahead of her time.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Like Forbes, she called for tax cuts and parental choice in  
education.

<HEADLINE> Atlanta's Rocker Ruckus Continues </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Atlanta Braves reliever John Rocker, locked in a  
feud with New York Mets fans, had the last word Sunday night. 
</P>
<P>
	Rocker pitched 1 1-3 innings of shutout relief in the Mets' 4-3,  
15-inning victory over Atlanta in Game 5 of the NL Championship 
Series. 
</P>
<P>
	When he came into the dugout after striking out Mike Piazza to  
end the 13th inning, nearby fans were heckling him. 
</P>
<P>
	``I just struck out your best hitter,'' he said, yelling back.  
</P>
<P>
	He stayed in the game and retired Robin Ventura leading off the  
14th, gesturing that the fly ball didn't scare him. 
</P>
<P>
	``I would say the majority of Mets fans aren't even human,''  
Rocker said after the game. ``I've said how brutal the fans were 
and how disgusting they were. They were worse than I ever 
suspected.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Rocker had called New York fans ``stupid,'' and ``a tired act,''  
before the Braves arrived in New York. That made him a target in 
the three games played at Shea Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
	``I actually enjoyed myself the last couple of days,'' said the

<HEADLINE> South Pole Doctor Returning to U.S. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- The doctor who gave herself chemotherapy for a  
lump on her breast she discovered while at the South Pole said 
shortly before her rescue that she was anxious about her prognosis. 
</P>
<P>
	``I am sick and would like to go the hospital and learn my  
fate,'' Dr. Jerri Nielsen said in an e-mail exchange with Newsweek 
a few days before a daring air mission evacuated her from the U.S. 
National Science Foundation's South Pole research station. 
</P>
<P>
	Nielsen, from Youngstown, Ohio, was rescued Saturday by a crew  
from the New York Air National Guard's 109th Airlift Wing. 
</P>
<P>
	The 47-year-old discovered a lump in her breast in June, which  
is wintertime in the Antarctic. An air drop of medical supplies in 
July allowed her to begin treating herself with chemotherapy. 
</P>
<P>
	She performed her own biopsy and then e-mailed photographs of  
slide samples to doctors in the United States, Newsweek reported. 
At her request, the National Science Foundation has not released 
details of her diagnosis or condition. 
</P>
<P>
	But Newsweek, citing an Science Foundation source, reports in  
its October 25 issue that after Nielsen completed the first round 
of chemotherapy, doctors advised her to begin a second round. The 
magazine released a copy of the story Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	Temperatures finally thawed enough last week for a transport  
plane to land at the station, evacuate her and drop off another 
doctor to care for the 41 people living there. 
</P>
<P>
	Nielsen's sister-in-law, Diana Cahill, said Nielsen was flying  
to the United States on Sunday with her brothers, who met her at a 
stopover in New Zealand. 
</P>
<P>
	``The distance between she and the family, to not be able to  
physically comfort her, has been hard,'' said Cahill.

<HEADLINE> Cards' Plummer Breaks Finger </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TEMPE, Ariz. (AP) -- Arizona's Jake Plummer left Sunday night's  
game against the Washington Redskins early in the third quarter 
when he broke the ring finger on his right hand. 
</P>
<P>
	Plummer, knocked out of a game for the second time in as many  
weeks, was injured on a vicious sack by linebacker Shawn Barber 
with about 14 minutes to play in the third quarter. 
</P>
<P>
	Plummer's finger became stuck in Barber's facemask on the hit.  
He went to the locker room for X-rays and came back onto the field 
with his hand wrapped with about three minutes left in the quarter. 
</P>
<P>
	Plummer already was bothered by a hip pointer which sidelined  
him for much of last week's 14-3 victory over the New York Giants. 
Plummer missed most of the preseason with a sprained right thumb. 
</P>
<P>
	Before he left, Plummer had thrown two interceptions, giving him  
15 for the season. Champ Bailey returned his first interception 
Sunday night 59 yards for a touchdown.

<P>
	NEW ORLEANS (AP) -- New Orleans coach Mike Ditka made an obscene  
gesture to taunting fans when he left the field at halftime Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	Ditka, who has not been the target of much fan criticism since  
becoming New Orleans coach in 1997 despite back-to-back 6-10 
records, was booed loudly and taunted Sunday after a botched play 
ended the first half, although the Saints were leading Tennessee 
10-0. The Titans came back to win 24-21. 
</P>
<P>
	With 12 seconds left and no timeouts, the Saints had  
first-and-goal from the 1. They ran Ricky Williams up the middle 
for no gain and then watched the clock run out. 
</P>
<P>
	The fans booed as the team left the field and Ditka made a  
finger gesture to them. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't appreciate that,'' Ditka said of the boos, then added,  
``the fans have a right to do anything they want.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Saints' loss was the fourth time this season New Orleans  
(1-4) has blown a lead in the last half and lost. The small crowd 
remaining in the Superdome at the end of the game again jeered 
Ditka and the players as they left the field.

<HEADLINE> Irene Lashes Carolina Coasts </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WILMINGTON, N.C. (AP) -- Hurricane Irene drenched southeastern  
North Carolina with more than a half foot of rain before heading 
out to sea Sunday night, unleashing more flooding in a region still 
saturated by record floodwaters from Hurricane Floyd. 
</P>
<P>
	As the storm turned east and its strongest winds moved away from  
land, the National Weather Service dropped hurricane warnings at 11 
p.m. Tropical storm warnings remained in effect for most of the 
North Carolina coast. 
</P>
<P>
	The National Hurricane Center in Miami said it appeared  
increasingly likely that Irene's northeast track and its 85 mph 
winds might skirt the North Carolina coast without coming ashore. 
</P>
<P>
	As the storm turned east and its strongest winds moved away from  
land, the National Weather Service dropped hurricane warnings at 11 
p.m. Tropical storm warnings remained in effect for most of the 
North Carolina coast. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's moving more toward the east, but it could be very close  
to the Cape Lookout area in the early morning hours. That's what it 
looks like,'' said meteorologist Bill Frederick. 
</P>
<P>
	At 2 a.m. Monday, Irene was 40 miles south-southeast of Cape  
Hatteras, moving toward the northeast at about 30 mph. 
</P>
<P>
	A flurry of beach town evacuations preceded the storm, North  
Carolina's third hurricane in two months. Torrential rains in front 
of Irene's core swamped dozens of roads, and National Guard troops 
were called out to sandbag against rising flood waters. 
</P>
<P>
	A tornado spawned by the hurricane touched down near Weeksville  
at about 6:40 p.m., destroying six homes and damaging several more. 
One person suffered minor injuries. 
</P>
<P>
	The greatest concern was rain, not wind, and the eastern coastal  
plain, inundated by Hurricane Floyd just four weeks ago, was 
especially vulnerable to more flooding. 
</P>
<P>
	Up to 7 inches had fallen in parts of eastern North Carolina by  
Sunday night, the National Weather Service said. 
</P>
<P>
	State public safety secretary Richard Moore said the worst  
flooding was expected in the Fayetteville area and along the Cape 
Fear River, expected to crest 20 feet above flood stage later this 
week. 
</P>
<P>
	No deaths had been reported in association with the storm in  
North Carolina by Sunday night. Irene has been blamed for seven 
deaths, five of them in Florida and two in Cuba. 
</P>
<P>
	A flash flood warning was canceled late Sunday for a  
100-mile-by-50-mile swath of eastern North Carolina straddling 
Interstate 95 between Fayetteville and Rocky Mount. A similar 
warning remained in effect early Monday for two northeastern 
counties. Gale-force winds were measured at the coast, and a 
tornado was reported by radar over Jacksonville on Sunday morning. 
</P>
<P>
	Scores of roads in the eastern part of the state had been closed  
because of flash flooding by 10 p.m. More than 2,100 homes and 
businesses were without power in the eastern half of the state. 
</P>
<P>
	Irene initially was expected to come ashore near the South  
Carolina line Sunday night, but then it picked up speed and tacked 
to the northeast. 
</P>
<P>
	An evacuation order was issued for several beach towns near  
Wilmington, and people living in low-lying areas and mobile homes 
were encouraged to seek shelter. Many left homeless by Floyd were 
evacuated from temporary trailer villages to shelters. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm getting to the point where I can't take it any more,''  
said Herbert Person Jr., 48, who lost his Princeville home and was 
living in a government trailer park when he was evacuated to a 
shelter. ``I've worked hard all my life and paid taxes, and now I 
feel like I have nothing.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The prospect of more flooding from Irene disheartened others  
still recovering from Floyd, which drenched eastern North Carolina 
with up to 20 inches of rain on Sept. 16. 
</P>
<P>
	``I can only imagine the frustration and anxiety I have seen on  
people's faces, having to move again into shelters and not knowing 
what they will find when they go back,'' said Moore. ``It's 
devastating.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The American Red Cross reported at least 690 people were staying  
at 58 shelters Sunday night. 
</P>
<P>
	State officials prepared for Irene by activating 500 National  
Guardsmen, opening 39 Guard armories and putting 10 water rescue 
teams on standby in anticipating of flooding. 
</P>
<P>
	Because of Floyd's destructiveness -- at least 49 deaths and some  
6,000 homes destroyed and billions in damages -- people were taking 
Irene very seriously, Moore said. 
</P>
<P>
	``If anything, people are going to err on the extreme side of  
caution,'' he said, adding that heavy rainfall could keep eastern 
North Carolina rivers above flood stage all week. 
</P>
<P>
	In South Carolina, dozens of church services were canceled, draw  
bridges were locked down and the Charleston International Airport 
was closed. Up to 6 inches of rain fell in parts of the state. 
</P>
<P>
	Across the state line, at Carolina Beach south of Wilmington,  
the boardwalk was deserted and the go-carts were lashed together at 
a nearby amusement park, closed for business. 
</P>
<P>
	Jack Tucker looked out over the empty Carolina Bingo hall, where  
he was helping out Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think even the flies are gone today,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> Farms Turn Fair-Like for Customers / Farm Scene  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	GASPORT, N.Y. (AP) -- Unmistakable signs of the fall harvest in  
New York: The rumble of tractors through sweet-smelling apple 
orchards. Piles of pumpkins at roadside stands. The steel-drum 
sound of a Calypso band and the smell of popcorn wafting above the 
heads of children waiting for pony rides. 
</P>
<P>
	It's the annual marriage of farm meets fair as growers with  
loads of produce to sell reach out to the buying public. 
</P>
<P>
	With many supermarket chains giving their produce sections a  
homegrown farmers' market feel, it's no easy task persuading busy 
shoppers to make an extra detour to the country. 
</P>
<P>
	But with foreign competition driving wholesale prices down, many  
farmers can't afford or aren't willing to lose their 
direct-to-consumer business. So they pull out all the stops to keep 
families coming to them, carving out cornfield mazes, hiring 
magicians, setting up petting zoos and opening restaurants. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's become a case of the tail wags the dog,'' said Bob Brown,  
owner of Brown's Berry Patch in Waterport. His farm's gift shop, 
deli, ice cream counters, storybook-themed play areas and live 
animal displays draw more customers than the pick-your-own produce 
business they were set up to boost. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's become more and more entertainment and less and less  
produce,'' Brown said. 
</P>
<P>
	It's demanding, yes, handling extra staff, advertising and  
licensing on top of the perpetual weather and crop price worries. 
But with childhood memories of his father picketing an apple packer 
for an extra penny a pound, Brown is determined not to become 
dependent on the processing industry for his livelihood. 
</P>
<P>
	``Now, we sell Pepsi,'' he said. ``I never wanted to sell Pepsi,  
but if that's what the public wants, you're a fool not to.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The state's Guide to Farm-Fresh Foods lists more than 1,000  
farms that sell at least some of their harvest directly to the 
public, but there has been no survey to determine how many farms 
have gone beyond the traditional roadside stand. 
</P>
<P>
	The number is growing, said Pete Gregg, spokesman for the New  
York Department of Agriculture and Markets. 
</P>
<P>
	As a farmer, ``you have more control over your prices, you have  
more control over your operation and you have more control over 
your destiny when you're directly marketing your product to the 
consumer,'' Gregg said. 
</P>
<P>
	Farmers who may get $7 per bushel of apples from a packing house  
can charge twice that at their own shops and still be well below 
supermarket prices. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a win-win situation because the consumer also gets to  
pick the produce that appeals to them,'' Gregg said. ``They're 
getting fresh local produce, which is always going to taste the 
best, plus it's a great family thing to do.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The trend goes beyond produce. Maple syrup producers offer  
pancake breakfasts, wineries have added cafes, Christmas tree 
growers provide cross-country ski trails and cut-your-own 
operations and herb farms host culinary seminars. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's an exciting thing that's happening in agriculture right  
now,'' Gregg said. ``There's a large amount of consumers and a 
large amount of farms, and marrying the two is really a key to the 
future of agriculture here.''

<HEADLINE> Missed Chances Doom Braves </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- For the Atlanta Braves, Sunday's Game 5 of the  
National League Championship Series was a frustrating string of 
missed opportunities, 15 innings of aggravation. 
</P>
<P>
	They loaded the bases in consecutive innings, both times without  
benefit of a base hit, and failed to score each time in a game they 
lost 4-3 to the New York Mets after taking the lead in the top half 
of the 15th and needing just three outs to reach the World Series. 
</P>
<P>
	This was a game the Braves should have won earlier and thought  
they had finally won despite having a runner thrown out at the 
plate and leaving a record 19 runners on base. 
</P>
<P>
	Even in the inning they scored their first two runs, they came  
away with less than they might have. 
</P>
<P>
	The bases-loaded situations might have been turning points if  
Atlanta had not wasted so many other chances. Perhaps the most 
painful came in the 13th inning when Keith Lockhart singled with 
two out and tried to score from first on Chipper Jones' two-out 
double. He was thrown out by at least 10 feet. 
</P>
<P>
	Batting just .198 in the first four games of the series, the  
Braves had one brief breakthrough, stringing consecutive doubles by 
Bret Boone and Jones and a single by Brian Jordan to tie the score 
2-2 in the fourth. 
</P>
<P>
	When Ryan Klesko walked, there were two on and no outs. But Orel  
Hershiser came out of the Mets bullpen to strike out Andruw Jones 
and Eddie Perez and get Walt Weiss on a roller to first base. 
</P>
<P>
	For the next 10 innings, the Braves had plenty of chances but  
couldn't score. 
</P>
<P>
	Atlanta left two runners on base in the fifth, wasting Gerald  
Williams' double. But the Braves' best chances came in the sixth 
and seventh, even though they never got a hit in either inning. 
</P>
<P>
	After Klesko, leading off, reached on an error by John Olerud,  
he was bunted to second. After walking Perez intentionally, 
Hershiser then walked Weiss unintentionally to load the bases. With 
pitcher Greg Maddux at bat, manager Bobby Cox put on the squeeze, 
despite a two-strike count. Maddux missed the bunt for strike three 
and Klesko had no chance coming down the line and was tagged out to 
end the inning. 
</P>
<P>
	An inning later, the Braves were back, knocking on the door  
again. 
</P>
<P>
	Boone was hit by a pitch with one out and Turk Wendell came on  
to strike out Chipper Jones. Boone stole second on the third strike 
and Jordan was walked intentionally, the first two balls thrown by 
Wendell, the last two by Dennis Cook, brought in to force Cox to 
pinch hit for Klesko. 
</P>
<P>
	When righty swinging Brian Hunter came to bat, Pat Mahones  
relieved for New York but walked the pinch hitter, loading the 
bases again. Then he got Andruw Jones on a fly ball, ending the 
threat. 
</P>
<P>
	It was like that all night for Atlanta. The Braves wasted a  
leadoff double by Perez in the third inning and one-out doubles by 
Williams in the fifth and Weiss in the eighth. In the 10th, Perez 
opened with a single and pinch-runner Howard Battle stole second, 
but Atlanta couldn't get the run home. 
</P>
<P>
	Finally, in the 15th, a triple by Lockhart drove in the go-ahead  
run. But the Mets weren't done. 
</P>
<P>
	When Robin Ventura delivered the winning hit, the Braves ran out  
of chances and now they won't get anymore until Tuesday when the 
series returns to Atlanta for Game 6.

<HEADLINE> N.Y. Leader To Back John McCain </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- In a blow to George W. Bush, one of his most  
influential New York backers is switching allegiances to back 
presidential rival John McCain. 
</P>
<P>
	Former Rep. Guy Molinari, a powerful Republican who had urged  
the Texas governor to seek the presidency, said he had decided to 
``place principle above politics'' and become McCain's New York 
chairman. 
</P>
<P>
	In a statement prepared for his announcement today, Molinari did  
not criticize Bush but offered a cryptic explanation for his change 
of heart. ``Candidates -- both Democratic and Republican alike -- 
define their beliefs and shape their convictions by taking polls. 
John McCain is a notable exception.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The statement was provided by the McCain campaign.  
</P>
<P>
	Molinari, who served in the House from 1981 to 1989, is in his  
fourth term as Staten Island borough president. He was a key New 
York supporter of former President George Bush, the Texas 
governor's father. 
</P>
<P>
	Molinari has been feuding with New York Gov. George Pataki,  
Bush's top supporter in the state. 
</P>
<P>
	Welcoming the change of heart, McCain said, ``I'm humbled to  
accept the support of Guy Molinari.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Arizona senator and former Vietnam prisoner of war has  
narrowed the gap in polls against Bush in New Hampshire, the 
first-in-the-nation primary state. Though still far behind Bush in 
money-raising and the polls, McCain hopes to stagger the 
front-runner in New Hampshire and the follow-up primary in South 
Carolina, a state with many military veterans. 
</P>
<P>
	One of Bush's strengths is a long list of endorsements from  
party leaders such as Molinari. 
</P>
<P>
	Molinari said he respects Bush, and noted that it would make  
sense to continue backing the GOP front-runner. ``But my respect 
for John McCain and the values he represents compel me to place 
principle above politics,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	The statement did not explain why he backed Bush initially,  
knowing McCain was a rival. 
</P>
<P>
	He said McCain ``is best able to continue the legacy of  
leadership of George Bush and Ronald Reagan.''

<HEADLINE> Turkey Quake Victims To Get Housing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ISTANBUL, Turkey (AP) -- Turkey's leaders promised Sunday that  
the hundreds of thousands of victims of August's devastating 
earthquake would be out of cold tents and in homes by the end of 
November. 
</P>
<P>
	President Suleyman Demirel and Prime Minister Bulent Ecevit  
toured the hard-hit cities of Yalova, Izmit and Adapazari to mark 
the construction of 6,400 prefabricated houses. 
</P>
<P>
	They are the first of 32,000 temporary houses the government  
promised would be ready by Nov. 30, the Anatolia news agency 
reported. 
</P>
<P>
	The cold, wet weather has added to the misery of the quake  
survivors, many of whom have been living in leaky tents. 
</P>
<P>
	``With the strength of our state and people and the help of  
friendly nations, we will heal this wound,'' Demirel said in 
Yalova, a seaside resort 25 miles south of Istanbul. 
</P>
<P>
	On Saturday, the government announced state aid of up to $12,700  
for those whose homes were ruined in the quake and who want to buy 
or build a new home. 
</P>
<P>
	Demirel said the government would build 60,000 permanent homes  
next year. 
</P>
<P>
	The government said it also would help families rent homes, as  
well as compensate for the family members' deaths and for 
disabilities that resulted from the quake. 
</P>
<P>
	The 7.4-magnitude tremor on Aug. 17 killed more than 17,000  
people in Turkey's industrial heartland. 
</P>
<P>
	The state was criticized for failing in the first days after the  
disaster to organize rescue operations and distribute aid. Public 
anger, still running high, grew when authorities began distributing 
poor-quality tents, some of which weren't waterproof. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, the earth has continued to tremble in Turkey, where a  
3.8-magnitude quake shook the Aegean port city of Izmir early 
Sunday, Istanbul's Kandilli Observatory said. It was not seen as an 
aftershock to the Aug. 17 temblor. No damages or injuries were 
reported.

<HEADLINE> Web Sites Offering Luxury Goods </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Shoppers are buying lots of books, videos and  
toys on the Internet these days, but are they ready to purchase 
diamond necklaces or designer suits online? 
</P>
<P>
	The test may come this holiday season. Dozens of Web sites --  
from traditional retailers to startups -- are flooding the 
marketplace with all sorts of luxury goods, including Prada 
pocketbooks and Rolex watches. 
</P>
<P>
	But getting people to actually click on the ``buy'' button --  
especially from e-tailers they've never heard of -- may be tough. 
</P>
<P>
	``Selling luxury goods online is nothing like selling most other  
things on the Web,'' said Michael May, an analyst at the Internet 
research firm Jupiter Communications. 
</P>
<P>
	``You've got the issue of what is real and what is a knockoff  
... the issue of price, with some sites discounting and others that 
don't,'' he said. ``But that doesn't mean shoppers won't buy 
expensive stuff online. They just may proceed with caution.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The luxury goods market is already big business in the  
traditional retailing world. Sales last year totaled $133 billion 
as the robust economy and surging stock market helped encourage 
shoppers to buy expensive clothing and accessories. 
</P>
<P>
	Many expect luxury sales to eventually flourish on the Internet,  
given the potential for a vastly increased selection and the high 
incomes of those who buy online. About a quarter of the 38 million 
U.S. households that were online last year made more than $75,000 a 
year. That's about a third more than the average American 
household, according to Jupiter Communications. 
</P>
<P>
	But demand for upscale products online so far has been fairly  
small. 
</P>
<P>
	``The Internet is still new. When someone is first going online,  
they won't buy a diamond ring, but I think that as shoppers become 
more comfortable with the Web, they will be more willing to go for 
the higher-priced stuff,'' said Seema Williams, an analyst at 
Forrester Research, an Internet research firm in Cambridge, Mass. 
</P>
<P>
	Believing that the online luxury market will soon take off, many  
merchants have opened stores selling just high-end goods on the Web 
in the last year. This month alone, more than a dozen companies are 
launching new or redesigned Web sites, just in time for the start 
of the holiday shopping season. 
</P>
<P>
	Many see big profits since the markup on luxury goods is  
significant, which means they can make more on each item sold than 
those merchants selling smaller ticket items such as books or toys. 
</P>
<P>
	As the category expands, however, there is increasing concern  
about how the Internet will change the luxury business. Since 
shoppers can scour the Web for the best deals, many merchants and 
manufacturers worry how that will affect pricing. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition, there is virtually no way to control counterfeit  
goods and it is sometimes hard to differentiate Web sites selling 
fakes from those offering legitimate products. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's tough. You don't want someone selling a Prada pocketbook  
for next to nothing or selling a fake Prada,'' said May, the 
Jupiter analyst. ``When that happens, the notion of luxury becomes 
a commodity and the business model crumbles.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Nancy Epstein, of Laguna Beach, Calif., says she buys expensive  
things online only at Web sites with reputable names. 
</P>
<P>
	``It would be terrible if I spent lots of money on something  
like a Louis Vuitton purse, and it ended up not being real,'' she 
said. ``That makes me think twice before buying online.'' 
</P>
<P>
	With the luxury space getting more crowded, analysts point to a  
few sites that will give shoppers fair pricing and quality 
products. 
</P>
<P>
	One is neimanmarcus.com, which is expected to be launched by the  
venerable retailer Neiman Marcus on Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	Shoppers will find more than 500 items on neimanmarcus.com --  
from many top-of-the-line designers, including Gucci and Donna 
Karan -- and the inventory is expected to grow in the coming months. 
Live customer service is available on the site as is a unique 
merchandising service that helps shoppers match clothes and 
accessories. 
</P>
<P>
	What makes neimanmarcus.com stand out is its link to its already  
reputable stores and catalog. Every item is guaranteed and 
returnable. 
</P>
<P>
	Analysts also laud Internet startup Ashford.com, which currently  
sells 10,000 different styles of watches, fragrances, leather 
accessories, sunglasses and writing instruments, including goods 
from Rolex, TAG Heuer and Cartier. On Monday, it is expected to 
announce it will begin selling designer jewelry and diamonds. 
</P>
<P>
	Some merchandise is discounted. Every item it sells is  
guaranteed to be authentic and there is a 30-day money back 
guarantee. 
</P>
<P>
	``I was pleasantly surprised at the experience I had at  
Ashford.com,'' said Dan George, of Carlsbad, Calif., who bought a 
Breitling watch on the site for nearly $1,000. 
</P>
<P>
	``I wasn't sure what to expect. But they had more watches than  
any of the local jewelry stores, and everything, down to the box 
that the watch came in, was done absolutely right.''

<HEADLINE> Report: Minority Students Lagging </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Black and Hispanic students lag behind white and  
Asian students academically -- even when they come from similarly 
privileged backgrounds, according to a new report. 
</P>
<P>
	To bridge the gap, the report issued Sunday by the College Board  
recommends tutoring, mentoring and other support to minority 
students in all grades and from all socioeconomic backgrounds. 
</P>
<P>
	The New York-based College Board administers the SATs.  
</P>
<P>
	``We are not just talking about disadvantaged youngsters,'' said  
Gaston Caperton, president of the College Board. ``Even minority 
students from relatively wealthy families with well-educated 
parents do not typically perform as well as white and Asian 
students from similar backgrounds.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Surveying data going back to the 1960s, the report found that  
academic underachievement among black and Hispanic students begins 
in the earliest grades and persists all the way into higher 
education. 
</P>
<P>
	Even among students whose parents had PhDs and high incomes,  
some black and Hispanic students tended to get lower test scores 
and grades than white and Asian students. The wealthier minority 
students' ``patterns of academic achievement tend to resemble those 
of less affluent whites and Asian Americans,'' the report said. 
</P>
<P>
	The report found some signs of progress. For example, the gap in  
average math scores for 17-year-old minorities versus white 
students decreased by 30 percent between the early 1970s and the 
mid-1990s. And 87 percent of all black students graduate from high 
school or pass equivalency tests -- about the same rate as white 
students. 
</P>
<P>
	In seeking answers about why some minorities might not perform  
as well academically as their white and Asian peers, the report 
noted that some experts cited racism, and peer pressure that 
disparages intellectual achievement.

Johnson as interim men's basketball coach to replace Othell Wilson, 
who was placed on leave after his arrest on rape charges, the 
school announced Sunday.

last month of abducting a 22-year-old woman and raping her at his 
apartment. Wilson played on Final Four teams in 1981 and 1984 
before moving on to the NBA, where he played with Sacramento and 
Golden State.

<HEADLINE> Do Wrestlers Have Eating Disorders? </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Wrestlers who go through dietary contortions  
to push their weights down don't have eating disorders, though they 
act like they do, a study shows. 
</P>
<P>
	``In our sample, we didn't find anyone who was bulimic,'' said  
researcher Daniel M. Landers of Arizona State University in Tempe. 
``Disordered eating is a better term, which I think everybody does 
in their life.'' A strict diet that starts on New Year's day could 
count as disordered eating, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Some wrestlers forced down their weights artificially before  
weigh-ins so they can wrestle in lower weight classes against 
potentially smaller and weaker competitors. 
</P>
<P>
	Previous studies used questionnaires to search for eating  
disorders among wrestlers. But questionnaires are only a start in 
differentiating bad diet habits from bulimia, which is a clinically 
diagnosable psychiatric disorder, Landers said. He went the extra 
step of interviewing wrestlers who had high scores on the 
questionnaires. 
</P>
<P>
	The study in the American College of Sports Medicine journal  
Medicine and Science in Sports and Exercise looked at 85 junior 
high and high school wrestlers in the Phoenix area, and 75 
nonwrestlers recruited from physical education classes in the same 
schools. Wrestlers took the questionnaire during and after the 
wrestling season; nonwrestlers took it once. 
</P>
<P>
	On the first test, 27 percent of wrestlers tested high in one of  
the categories, termed Drive for Thinness, which Landers described 
as an overwhelming fear of being overweight. In comparison, only 15 
percent tested high in the off-season. That's statistically 
different from the results during the season, but not different 
from the 13 percent of nonwrestlers who also tested high. 
</P>
<P>
	There were no significant differences among the students in two  
other categories -- Bulimia, which looked for behaviors such as 
self-induced vomiting, and Body Dissatisfaction, which was 
unhappiness with the overall shape of their bodies, Landers said. 
</P>
<P>
	Overall, 36 percent of wrestlers during the season reached the  
test's ``at risk'' threshold, while only 19 percent were considered 
at risk of bulimia after the season; 29 percent of nonwrestlers 
were rated at risk. The difference between wrestlers' scores during 
and after the season was significant. 
</P>
<P>
	Those findings are less worrisome than they seem -- the  
questionnaire is only a screening tool, and should be followed with 
interviews to see if a diagnosis could be made, Landers said. When 
that was done, ``we didn't find any who met the criteria for 
bulimic behavior,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	The wrestlers ``had a fear of being fat, but you find out the  
reason for the fear is they are not going to be able to wrestle, 
not because they have an overwhelming fear they look terrible,'' 
Landers said. 
</P>
<P>
	One giveaway for the wrestlers was that they didn't worry about  
their weight in the off-season, Landers said. ``Once that 
performance is over, they start eating. They like to eat. They have 
no aversion to eating,'' Landers said ``In fact, they don't like 
being skinny -- which is very different from people who have this 
disordered body image and who, even when they are skinny, think 
they want to be more skinny.'' 
</P>
<P>
	This fits the experience of Dennis Gurecki, who coaches at  
Channel High School in the Phoenix area and is state chairman of 
Arizona USA Wrestling, an amateurs governing body. ``There's always 
a few that will cut (weight) pretty hard, and the ones that do I 
guarantee they will right back up to their weight and past that,'' 
he said. ``They are eating machines. I have never seen one that has 
done the opposite in my 25 years of coaching.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The results suggest that wrestling officials who want athletes  
to avoid risky weight-loss methods should concentrate on changing 
the rules, not looking into the athletes' minds, Landers said. 
</P>
<P>
	Rule changes have been made, especially because some behaviors --  
dehydration is one -- have resulted in the deaths of wrestlers. 
</P>
<P>
	Schools affiliated with the National Federation of State High  
School Associations are requiring weigh-ins no more than one hour 
before the meet, effective this season, said Fritz McGuinness, 
editor of the wrestling rulebook. 
</P>
<P>
	Similar rules are in place at the college level, said Randy  
Dick, assistant director for health and safety at the National 
Collegiate Athletic Association.''Our concern was really the whole 
emphasis on making weight in the sport and the bouncing around,'' 
Dick said. ``We hope the rules changes have eliminated that -- or 
reduced it significantly.''

<HEADLINE> Low-Carb Diet Called Unhealthy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ATLANTA (AP) -- On a typical morning, Ron Glasgow eats a  
three-egg omelet and a 12-ounce package of bacon or a half-pound of 
ham. For the rest of the day, he can eat all the pork rinds, beef 
jerky, sausage and steak he wants. 
</P>
<P>
	After 11 months on this diet, he's gone from 425 to 330 pounds.  
</P>
<P>
	Glasgow and others claim to have shed stubborn fat by laying off  
carbohydrates and sugars. They stick to a menu of unlimited meat, 
cheese and eggs -- no sweets, rice, pasta or bread. 
</P>
<P>
	Many dietitians and health experts, 10,000 of whom will be in  
Atlanta this week for the American Dietic Association's annual 
meeting, say the diet is an unhealthy fad and the weight loss is 
temporary. 
</P>
<P>
	The high-protein, no-carb plan is ``a nightmare of a diet,''  
said Kathleen Zelman, a registered dietitian and ADA spokeswoman. 
``At first, it sounds so alluring. You get the green light to eat 
these foods.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But she said the monotony soon gets old. Sure, you get the  
hamburger, but no bun or fries. You can eat a big steak, but forget 
the baked potato and tossed salad. 
</P>
<P>
	Plus, it's just unhealthy, nutritionists say. Along with the  
risk of increasing cholesterol levels, the diet could cause kidney 
problems or possibly a loss of calcium in the bones, Ms. Zelman 
said. Limiting the intake of carbohydrates to such a dramatically 
low level starves the body of needed nutrients and it causes an 
artificial metabolic state. 
</P>
<P>
	``Think of it on a global perspective -- the world at large  
survives on grains,'' Ms. Zelman said. ``If we didn't have 
carbohydrates, we would not be able to survive. Bread is the staff 
of life.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The low-carb diet was first touted by Dr. Robert Atkins more  
than 20 years ago. Its popularity in the '90s has been attributed 
to his latest book ``Dr. Atkins' New Diet Revolution,'' currently 
the best-selling mass market paperback in the country. 
</P>
<P>
	Glasgow, a 39-year-old computer support technician from Cumming,  
said the diet allows him to lose weight and continue to be a ``big 
eater.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm aware of some of the opponents, but for me right now, it  
seems to be working,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Glasgow said he lost 100 pounds once before on a low-fat, high  
exercise diet. He took a two-month leave of absence from his job 
and exercised 6 to 8 hours a day. But when he switched to a more 
reasonable schedule, the weight stopped coming off and he went back 
to his old ways. 
</P>
<P>
	With studies showing exercise at an all-time low and more than  
half of all adults overweight, Americans are constantly searching 
for a way to slim down without drastically changing their 
lifestyles. 
</P>
<P>
	The increasing number of unhealthy and overweight adults and  
children is a particularly troubling issue the ADA will discuss at 
its four-day meeting, which starts Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	The group will also discuss food safety, children's health and  
reducing the risks of heart disease and colon cancer through diet. 
</P>
<P>
	Like other health organizations, the ADA maintains the only way  
to lose weight is through a healthy, well-balanced diet and 
exercise. 
</P>
<P>
	Atkins has dismissed criticism of his diet as ``dietitian talk''  
and points out that many people have maintained their weight loss 
for years and lowered their cholesterol by following his plan. 
</P>
<P>
	Glasgow and others who've lost weight on the plan will probably  
gain it back, Ms. Zelman says. The initial weight loss occurs 
because, without carbohydrates, the body is forced to burn fat and 
protein for fuel -- but that creates fatigue. Also, the monotony of 
the diet gets some people to eat less. 
</P>
<P>
	Sooner or later, the dieter will have to go back to at least  
moderate carbohydrate consumption. When they do, the weight will 
likely return. 
</P>
<P>
	Her advice for anyone who considers going on the diet is to  
consult their doctor, drink plenty of fluids and take a 
multivitamin, mineral supplement. 
</P>
<P>
	``Realize it's a short-term fix,'' she said. ``Ultimately, you  
will have to face reality of weight management.''

<HEADLINE> China Says Weapons Ready for Y2K </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BEIJING (AP) -- Computers at China's weapons and nuclear plants  
have been checked for the millennium bug and will be bug-free on 
New Year's Day, an official newspaper reported Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	``We can ensure all facilities in the country's defense sector  
will be safe and reliable on Jan. 1, 2000,'' the State Commission 
of Science, Technology and Industry for National Defense said in a 
report, according to the Business Weekly. A dozen groups have been 
conducting spot checks on defense equipment and production lines 
since August, the report said. 
</P>
<P>
	The Ministry of Information Industry ordered all government and  
industrial sectors that might be unable to remove millennium, or 
Y2K, bugs from their computer systems to propose emergency 
measures. 
</P>
<P>
	Such measures recently were tested by Chinese airlines. Many  
senior airline executives will fly at year's end to prove the 
planes are safe, Business Weekly said. 
</P>
<P>
	In Washington last week, Lawrence Gershwin, the CIA's national  
intelligence officer for science and technology, said China is one 
of the countries likely to suffer the greatest Y2K-related 
disruptions. 
</P>
<P>
	The Y2K problem is caused by computers that were programmed to  
read only the last two digits of a year. That will cause them to 
read the year 2000 as 1900, in some cases fouling up basic 
operations.

<HEADLINE> Art World Stir: Synthetic Charcoal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ALBUQUERQUE, N.M. (AP) -- It's black as coal, green at both ends.  
</P>
<P>
	But it isn't coal. It's Lithocoal, a new product causing a stir  
in the art world. 
</P>
<P>
	The synthetic charcoal was invented in Albuquerque by a  
22-year-old artist seeking a new look in lithography. 
</P>
<P>
	Lithocoal draws like charcoal, smooth and smudgy. But there is  
no need for aerosol fixatives to preserve the picture -- fixatives 
that include benzene, acetone and other toxic chemicals. 
</P>
<P>
	Lithocoal fixes, meaning it no longer smudges, with heat -- 30  
seconds at 225 degrees in a conventional oven. 
</P>
<P>
	Unlike brittle charcoal for which artists pay $2 a stick,  
environmentally friendly Lithocoal retails for $1.75 apiece. It's 
made from a plastic powder that was industrial waste before Joseph 
D'Uva and partner Robert Houston got their fingerprints all over 
it. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're recycling 100 percent of this material; we have no  
waste. We don't use any water in our process,'' says Houston. 
``It's green on both ends -- green because of what we use, and also 
because of what you're not going to use.'' 
</P>
<P>
	With help from graduate business students at the University of  
New Mexico, the partners formed D'Uva Fine Artists Materials Inc., 
filed patents, secured international contracts, designed and built 
the machinery in their production line, packaged, shipped and 
promoted their product starting last February. 
</P>
<P>
	D'Uva was studying at Albuquerque's Tamarind Institute when he  
created Lithocoal from a powder used there for lithography, a 
print-making technique. The powder was thrown away by a 
plastic-coating company. 
</P>
<P>
	D'Uva wondered: What if someone made a stick of this?  
</P>
<P>
	``I was doing a lot of research at Tamarind, just kind of  
playing around with stuff,'' D'Uva, now 25, said from the 
University of Iowa where he is pursuing a master's degree in art. 
``I wanted this very 'charcoal' look (for lithography), and I 
wanted to apply it the way charcoal would be applied.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He puttered with the smudgy soot, finally coming up with his  
patented process. He went to Houston, a sculptor at UNM, to help 
make forms to mold more sticks. 
</P>
<P>
	When they ran out of litho plates for testing prototypes, they  
used drawing paper. The stick drew and smudged just like charcoal. 
</P>
<P>
	``We looked at each other and said, 'Omigod,''' D'Uva recalls.  
</P>
<P>
	Lithocoal fixes to just about anything -- frosted glass, metal,  
stone, cloth, wood, ceramics. 
</P>
<P>
	D'Uva and Houston took the project to Armand Winfield, a  
research professor at UNM specializing in plastics and in creating 
businesses. Winfield guided them through the intricacies of patent 
law, helped line up international contracts and seek investors. 
</P>
<P>
	Now, eight months later, Lithocoal is sold in England,  
Australia, Canada and the United States. 
</P>
<P>
	``The response to Lithocoal so far has been tremendous,''  
reports Viv Arthur, who co-runs a British mobile art supplier, Art 
Van Go, which sold 300 boxes in six weeks. 
</P>
<P>
	Houston has produced 40,000 sticks so far, of which 36,000 have  
been shipped. He expects production to hit 75,000 by February, 
ending the first year. 
</P>
<P>
	The U.S. art materials market is estimated at $1.3 billion a  
year, Houston said, ``and our (10-year) sales goal is $10 million 
to $12 million annual.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In the United States, Lithocoal is marketed by one of the  
nation's largest art distributors, McPhersons, based in the San 
Francisco area. McPherson's president Frank Stapleton acknowledges 
it's always a tough challenge for a new product, but of Lithocoal 
he said: ``I think it's pretty cool, actually. It's so different. 
Once you tell the whole story, the possibilities open up and 
people's eyes definitely open wide.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Stapleton says he stocked thousands of Lithocoal boxes in about  
250 stores. 
</P>
<P>
	Rachel Popowcer, who teaches drawing at UNM, had Houston do a  
class demonstration. ``I think it's amazing,'' she said of 
Lithocoal, which she plans to use on under-drawings for her 
paintings. 
</P>
<P>
	``Spray fix really makes me ill,'' she added.  
</P>
<P>
	Several students planned to buy. Student Vincent Fusconi said he  
would use Lithocoal on his current class project. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm very intrigued with it,'' Fusconi said. ``I'll probably  
use it as a charcoal substitute. It feels identical to vine 
(branch) charcoal.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He added: ``It's nice to see one man's waste become another  
man's treasure.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Would there be objections from art purists?  
</P>
<P>
	Ellen Landis, curator of art at the Albuquerque Museum, didn't  
think so. 
</P>
<P>
	``There are new products all the time. Look at acrylics,'' she  
said. ``I don't see a problem with it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	At Tamarind, lithography shop manager Bill Lagattuta said it  
will be used more for charcoal drawing than for lithography. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think it's good for a lot of things, and the drawing part is  
really great,'' Lagattuta said. 
</P>
<P>
	Winfield, the company's mentor at UNM, is impressed with the way  
his young artists became businessmen, especially Houston, just 30. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's an amazing young man. He handles himself very, very well.  
He knew he needed help in business and in the development of the 
product,'' Winfield said, ``so he looked for help. That's my 
business, helping people take a concept from inception into the 
marketplace.'' 
</P>
<P>
	They unveiled Lithocoal at trade shows in England and America.  
It was one of the hits of the National Art Materials Trade 
Association Show in Chicago last April, said George Bussinger, an 
Ohio art materials retailer and NAMTA board member. It's featured 
at the Art Methods and Materials Show this month in Pasadena, 
Calif. 
</P>
<P>
	Next month, D'Uva Fine Artists Materials plans to introduce a  
10-color line of synthetic pastels made from the same material.

<HEADLINE> Dolphins 31, Patriots 30 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	FOXBORO, Mass. (AP) -- Damon Huard, filling in after Dan Marino  
left early with a sore shoulder, threw a 5-yard touchdown pass to 
Stanley Pritchett with 23 seconds left Sunday to give the Miami 
Dolphins a 31-30 win over the New England Patriots. 
</P>
<P>
	Huard, who had thrown just nine passes in his first two seasons,  
replaced Marino following the Dolphins' second series. He threw an 
interception that Ty Law brought back 24 yards for a score, but 
also threw a 69-yard TD pass to Tony Martin and the 5-yard score to 
Pritchett on a 59-yard drive on which he converted three third 
downs -- a third-and-10, a third-and-9 and a third-and-5. 
</P>
<P>
	After falling behind 14-0, Olindo Mare kept Miami (4-1) in the  
game with six field goals -- breaking an NFL record by kicking four 
or more for the fourth straight game. His 53-yarder with just over 
five minutes left set the stage for Miami's final drive. 
</P>
<P>
	Huard was sacked nine times by the Patriots -- a record for the  
most allowed by the Dolphins. But he also completed 24 of 40 passes 
for 240 yards and scrambled six times for 54 yards. 
</P>
<P>
	It was the second straight last-minute victory for Miami, which  
came from behind last week in Indianapolis to win 34-31. That 
victory was engineered by Marino, the week after he was criticized 
by coach Jimmy Johnson following a 23-18 home loss to Buffalo. 
</P>
<P>
	For New England (4-2), it was the second straight last-minute  
loss. The Patriots dropped a 16-14 decision in Kansas City last 
week when Adam Vinatieri missed a 32-yard field goal in the final 
seconds. 
</P>
<P>
	Marino started Sunday but clearly was under par. He surpassed  
60,000 career yards on his only completion, an 8-yarder, but his 
second pass was intercepted by Andy Katzenmoyer and returned 57 
yards for a touchdown. The interception was forced by Lawyer 
Milloy's safety blitz. 
</P>
<P>
	Marino, who clearly couldn't throw well, was lifted after a  
short pass for Pritchett fell well short of the target. 
</P>
<P>
	Vinatieri was three-for-three Sunday, hitting from 41, 39 and 34  
yards, but he was most of the New England offense. 
</P>
<P>
	The Patriots' only offensive touchdown came on a 29-yard pass  
from Drew Bledsoe to Tony Simmons with 1:03 left in the first half. 
It was countered by Mare's 45-yarder that made it 24-19 at 
intermission.

<HEADLINE> Rams 41, Falcons 13 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ATLANTA (AP) -- It didn't matter that Kurt Warner finally had one  
of those days when he didn't light it up for the St. Louis Rams. 
</P>
<P>
	He didn't have to do anything special Sunday as the Rams got a  
101-yard kickoff return from Tony Horne and a 91-yard interception 
return from Grant Wistrom to remain the NFL's only unbeaten team 
with a 41-13 rout of the Atlanta Falcons. 
</P>
<P>
	Warner put the Rams (5-0) in control when he engineered  
touchdown drives on the first two possessions, and after the 
Falcons (1-5) cut the lead to 14-7 early in the second, Horne raced 
the distance down the sideline for his second scoring kickoff 
return in two weeks. He had a 97-yarder in last week's 42-20 
victory over San Francisco. 
</P>
<P>
	Atlanta had one more chance to cut the lead to a touchdown  
before halftime, reaching the Rams 9, but Wistrom picked off Chris 
Chandler's pass and lumbered the distance for a 28-7 lead 1:42 
before halftime. 
</P>
<P>
	The Falcons never threatened to get back in the game again.  
</P>
<P>
	Warner, who passed for 1,217 yards and 14 touchdowns in the  
first four games, connected on 13 of 20 for 111 yards and one 
touchdown. It was his lowest yardage total since passing for 275 
yards and three scores when the Rams shelled the Falcons 35-7 in 
their first meeting in St. Louis three weeks ago. 
</P>
<P>
	Marshall Faulk gave him all the offensive help he needed,  
running for 181 yards and a touchdown on 18 carries. 
</P>
<P>
	Warner passed for 36 yards and Faulk added 40 yards on five  
carries to account for all yardage in the first possession of the 
game, one that ended with Warner's 4-yard scoring pass to Isaac 
Bruce with 9:20 left in the opening quarter. 
</P>
<P>
	Warner then had passes of 17 and 9 yards to Faulk in a 59-yard  
drive in which the Rams overcame three false start penalties to 
eventually score on Faulk's 5-yard run with 2:03 left in the 
opening quarter. 
</P>
<P>
	Chandler, bothered by a strained hamstring, threw a 13-yard  
touchdown pass to Bob Christian to make it 14-7 just over three 
minutes into the second quarter -- right before Horne's kickoff 
return. 
</P>
<P>
	Chandler completed 10 of 18 passes for 168 yards before leaving  
with 12:32 left in the third with what was called flu-like 
symptoms. 
</P>
<P>
	St. Louis also got a 1-yard touchdown run from Robert Holcombe  
in the fourth quarter, and its other scoring came on field goals of 
22 and 49 yards by Jeff Wilkins. 
</P>
<P>
	Morten Andersen had field goals of 19 and 25 yards for the  
Falcons.

 *Leo Lionni    	
</P>
<P>
	ROME (AP) -- Artist Leo Lionni, who devoted his versatile talents  
to everything from philosophical children's books to high-profile 
ad campaigns, died Oct. 11. He was 89. 
</P>
<P>
	Lionni was born in the Netherlands on May 5, 1910, and  
immigrated to the United States 10 years later, showing an early 
enthusiasm for drawing. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1925, he moved to Genoa, Italy, where his abstract paintings  
won him an invitation to exhibit with the then-cutting-edge 
Futurists. He worked on his first graphic design projects in Milan. 
</P>
<P>
	Mussolini's Fascist racial laws turned Lionni away from Italy  
and toward the United States in 1933, when he wove his artistic and 
business talents into a successful career in advertising. 
</P>
<P>
	As art director of N.W. Ayer in Philadelphia, Lionni designed ad  
campaigns for clients including Ford and General Electric, 
employing respected contemporary artists such as Fernand Leger and 
Willem De Kooning as illustrators. 
</P>
<P>
	In the 1950s, he became art director for Fortune magazine and  
edited catalogs for New York's Museum of Modern Art and 
Metropolitan Museum. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1959, Lionni published his first children's book, ``Little  
Blue and Little Yellow.'' The idea -- the book's protagonists are a 
blue dot and a yellow dot whose adventures blend them together into 
Little Green -- sprung from a story he once improvised for his 
grandchildren. 
</P>
<P>
	Lionni went on to write and illustrate another 30 children's  
books, which have been published in 11 languages.

 *Ella Mae Morse    	
</P>
<P>
	BULLHEAD CITY, Ariz. (AP) -- Ella Mae Morse, whose classic 1942  
recording ``Cow Cow Boogie'' became Capitol Records' first 
million-selling single, died Saturday. She was 75. 
</P>
<P>
	She had been suffering respiratory problems following a long  
illness, according to her publicist. 
</P>
<P>
	The Texas-born Morse combined boogie woogie, blues, jazz, swing  
and country influences in the 1940s and 50s, helping to create a 
pioneering ``pop'' sound that would later grown into rock 'n' roll. 
Elvis Presley even praised her for teaching him how to sing. 
</P>
<P>
	Describe as a black-trained, white ``hepchick,'' her songs  
earned her 10 gold records. One song was the ``The House of Blue 
Lights,'' which is regarded as one of the most influential songs in 
the evolution of rock 'n' roll, said Alan Eichler, her publicist. 
</P>
<P>
	Morse stopped recording in 1957, but continued performing until  
1987.

<HEADLINE> Raiders 20, Bills 14 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ORCHARD PARK, N.Y. (AP) -- Even magicians run out of tricks. Doug  
Flutie ran out of luck and receivers, too. 
</P>
<P>
	With Eric Moulds sidelined for the final drive, Flutie watched  
one pass slip through a receiver's fingers and another get picked 
off by Eric Turner in the end zone with no time left in Oakland's 
20-14 win over the Buffalo Bills on Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	``We got a few and had a few slip through our hands,'' said  
Flutie, who completed 19 of 41 passes for 210 yards and one 
touchdown with three interceptions. 
</P>
<P>
	Tyrone Wheatley racked up 97 of his team's 195 yards rushing and  
scored two touchdowns, and Michael Husted kicked two field goals as 
Oakland (3-3) snapped Buffalo's four-game winning streak and halted 
its own losing skid at two games. 
</P>
<P>
	The Bills (4-2) matched their lowest scoring output of the  
season in their worst game since a season-opening 31-14 loss to 
Indianapolis. The Raiders' win avenged a 44-21 loss to Buffalo last 
season. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've been up here eight or nine times and except for one other  
time, we've never been in the game,'' Raiders receiver Tim Brown 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Flutie connected with rookie Peerless Price on a 30-yard pass  
and hit Andre Reed for 14 more to the Oakland 29 with 15 seconds to 
go. 
</P>
<P>
	Two incompletions later, including a pass that went off Price's  
fingertips in the end zone, Turner picked Flutie off. 
</P>
<P>
	``I wouldn't call it demoralizing, but we didn't play well,''  
Buffalo linebacker Gabe Northern said. 
</P>
<P>
	Moulds injured his hamstring with about 7 minutes left and will  
be out 3-4 weeks. He was immediately missed. 
</P>
<P>
	``Eric is the kind of guy that can go up and make a play,''  
Flutie said. ``That's what I was trying to do on that drive, put 
the ball in position so someone could make a play.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Rich Gannon completed 15 of 22 passes for 155 yards with no  
interceptions, but the Oakland running game produced the winning 
points; Wheatley scored on an 11-yard dash for a 20-7 lead with 
10:17 left in the third quarter. 
</P>
<P>
	Flutie followed the Wheatley TD with a five-play scoring drive,  
throwing 29 yards to Kevin Williams to the Oakland 12-yard line and 
finding Moulds in the end zone on the next play to cut the lead to 
20-14 with 13:29 to play. 
</P>
<P>
	The Raiders ate up 6:34 but Husted missed a 32-yard field goal,  
giving the dangerous Flutie one more chance to tie with 59 seconds 
to play. 
</P>
<P>
	``You keep the wonder kid off the field, and you're going to be  
all right,'' Wheatley said. ``You don't want them to have the ball 
and (Flutie) to have time to throw.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Bills fell short as they targeted Oakland cornerback Charles  
Woodson on the last drive. ``I'll tell you this,'' Woodson said. 
``You're not going to beat the Oakland Raiders by coming after 
me.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Raiders, who rushed for just 55 yards against Denver last  
week after leading the league in rushing with an average of 147.5 
yards the first four weeks of the season, ran for 107 yards in the 
first half against a Buffalo defense that was ranked first in the 
league against the run. 
</P>
<P>
	The Raiders, whose injury-depleted secondary was shredded by  
Flutie last year, this time intercepted Flutie twice in the first 
half and limited the quarterback to 23 yards on three scrambles. 
</P>
<P>
	Cornerback Darrien Gordon intercepted Flutie's pass on Buffalo's  
first play from scrimmage to put Oakland at the Buffalo 31-yard 
line. The Raiders scored on six running plays, with Wheatley 
plowing in from the 3. 
</P>
<P>
	On first down, Oakland averaged 4.8 yards in the game and 5.2  
yards in the first half. ``It was a strength of ours against a 
strength of theirs and we were stronger today,'' Oakland coach Jon 
Gruden said, referring to the running game. 
</P>
<P>
	Antowain Smith scored on a 52-yard romp one play after Flutie's  
17-yard pass to Kevin Williams on third-and-9 to tie the game at 
7-7. 
</P>
<P>
	The Raiders drove for two field goals by Husted for a 13-7  
halftime lead. 
</P>
<P>
 *Notes: * Raiders cornerback Eric Allen, free safety Turner, and  
strong safety Anthony Newman all returned after sitting out last 
year's loss to the Bills with injuries. ... Steve Christie passed 
1,000 points with two PATs. ... Moulds has a career-high and

<HEADLINE> Crime Down for 7th Straight Year </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Serious crimes reported to police declined for  
the seventh straight year in 1998, as both the murder and robbery 
rates reached lows not seen in three decades, the FBI reported 
Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	The overall violent crime rate -- 566 murders, rapes, robberies  
and assaults per 100,000 residents -- dropped to its lowest figure 
since 556 in 1985, just before an epidemic of crack cocaine sent it 
soaring. 
</P>
<P>
	The FBI report showed the use of guns to commit murder and  
robbery is decreasing. Also, one of the most terrifying crimes that 
rose along with the crack epidemic -- murder by a stranger -- dropped 
below half of all murders, to 48 percent, for only the second time 
during the 1990s. 
</P>
<P>
	The national total of seven serious violent and property crimes  
reported to 17,000 police agencies around the nation was 12,475,634 
in 1998, down 5.4 percent from the previous year and 12 percent 
since 1989, the FBI said. 
</P>
<P>
	``For seven years now we have seen serious crime go down in each  
region of the country, and in cities and towns large and small. But 
we must not become complacent,'' Attorney General Janet Reno said. 
</P>
<P>
	She credited ``more police officers on the street, greater  
partnerships between law enforcement agencies, continued efforts to 
keep guns away from criminals, and a balanced approach that 
includes prevention, intervention, punishment and supervision.'' 
</P>
<P>
	President Clinton joined the call against complacency.  
</P>
<P>
	``This is good news for America's families, and it shows we can  
indeed turn the tide on crime,'' he said. But, he added, ``even as 
crime falls, we must not let down our guard. That is why we must 
redouble our efforts to build on what works.... Together, we can 
make America the safest big nation in the world.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Republicans credited their legislation encouraging longer prison  
sentences. Criminologists also cited the aging of baby boomers past 
crime-prone years and the decline of crack markets. 
</P>
<P>
	During 1998, all violent crimes -- murder, rape, robbery and  
aggravated assault -- and all the far more numerous property crimes 
-- burglary, auto theft and larceny-theft -- dropped in both number 
and rate. 
</P>
<P>
	The violent crime rate, which adjusts for population growth, was  
down 7.3 percent, led by an 11.3 percent decline for robbery and a 
7.4 percent drop for murder. The aggravated assault rate was down 
5.7 percent to the lowest level in a decade. The rape rate declined 
4.2 percent to the lowest in 15 years. 
</P>
<P>
	The property crime rate fell 6.2 percent -- down 9.3 percent for  
auto theft, 6.2 percent for burglary and 5.7 percent for 
larceny-theft. 
</P>
<P>
	The murder rate of 6.3 per 100,000 residents was the lowest in  
31 years. As in 1997, it was the lowest since 6.2 in 1967. The 
robbery rate of 165.2 was the lowest in 29 years, since 148.4 in 
1969. 
</P>
<P>
	Firearms were used in 64.9 percent of murders, down from 67.8  
percent in 1997. The drop in firearm murders accounted for the 
entire drop in murders nationwide. The percentage of robberies with 
guns dipped from 39.7 to 38.2. 
</P>
<P>
	``That's a consequence of all the efforts limiting access to  
guns by people who shouldn't have them,'' said Alfred Blumstein, a 
professor of urban systems and operations research at 
Carnegie-Mellon University in Pittsburgh who directs the National 
Consortium on Violence Research. 
</P>
<P>
	Blumstein credited big city police departments for stepping up  
searches for guns, particularly among juveniles, tracing guns to 
illegal sellers and even paying bounties to turn in guns -- as well 
as federal and state background checks to prevent sales to felons. 
</P>
<P>
	Criminologists pointed out the national figures obscured a  
lingering problem: Although teen-age murders have been cut in half 
since their peak in 1993, they remain almost twice as high as in 
1984 before crack gangs began arming some teen-agers, and their 
schoolmates got guns to copy them or to protect themselves. 
</P>
<P>
	``The crack epidemic has subsided, but we haven't taken all the  
guns out of the hands of youths,'' said James Alan Fox, professor 
of criminal justice at Boston's Northeastern University. ``Youth 
crime is down but not out.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Police have adopted smarter strategies, focusing on guns and  
high-risk juveniles, taking a preventive approach rather than 
waiting in squad cars for 911 to ring,'' Fox added. ``Communities 
are involved as never before; corporations have made jobs 
available; clergy have taken their ministry to the streets.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``But if we let our guard down, the problem could resurface with  
a vengeance, because every year for the next couple decades we're 
going to have a record number of black and Latino teen-agers, and 
they live in the most at-risk situations,'' Fox said. 
</P>
<P>
	Although there were highly publicized mass shootings by students  
at a handful of suburban or rural schools, the overall incidence of 
deadly violence at schools has been declining as well. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1998, rural areas, the last places reached by the crack  
gangs, finally joined in the decline in crime volumes and rates 
that big cities and smaller cities have seen for several years. The 
year before, rural areas had seen a 1 percent increase in crime 
total from 1996. 
</P>
<P>
	Crime also dropped in every region: down 7 percent in the  
Northeast and West, 5 percent in the South and 4 percent in the 
Midwest.

<HEADLINE> Williams Beats Hingis in Final </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ZURICH, Switzerland (AP) -- Venus Williams routed Martina Hingis  
6-3, 6-4 to win the Swisscom Challenge on Sunday, denying Hingis a 
chance to capture her first title in her home country. 
</P>
<P>
	Williams defeated the world's top-ranked player for her sixth  
title this season. She did not lose a set all tournament. 
</P>
<P>
	This was Williams' second consecutive victory over Hingis. She  
beat her in the Grand Slam Cup semifinals two weeks ago. 
</P>
<P>
	Hingis last defeated Williams in the U.S. Open in September.  
Hingis won that semifinal before losing the final to Venus's 
sister, Serena. 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
	Bring on the Bowden Boys -- it's time for college football  
history. 
</P>
<P>
	When No. 1 Florida State plays at Clemson on Saturday night,  
Seminoles coach Bobby Bowden will attempt to become the fifth major 
college coach to reach 300 wins. 
</P>
<P>
	To join Bear Bryant, Pop Warner, Amos Alonzo Stagg and Joe  
Paterno on his first try, Bobby Bowden's Seminoles (7-0, 3-0 ACC) 
will have to beat a team coached by son Tommy Bowden. 
</P>
<P>
	It's the first father vs. son coaching matchup in major college  
football. 
</P>
<P>
	``We better be sharp next week or we'll get whipped,'' Bobby  
Bowden said following his team's less-than-impressive 30-10 win 
over Wake Forest on Saturday night. 
</P>
<P>
	A loss would not only delay No. 300, it would severely damage  
Florida State's run at a national championship. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think everyone knows who we're playing,'' Clemson  
quarterback Woodrow Danzler said after he totaled 435 yards -- 252 
passing, 183 running -- in a 42-30 win over Maryland. ``We just have 
to go out and prepare.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The matchup may seem one-sided, but Tommy's Tigers have a  
chance. Clemson (3-3, 3-1) has the ability to score against Florida 
State's unimpressive defense. The question is whether the Tigers' 
porous defense can slow Florida State's offense. 
</P>
<P>
	Peter Warrick, the Seminoles' star receiver, remains suspended  
because of his legal problems. Ron Dugans, now the team's top 
receiver, left Saturday's game with a bruised sternum and may not 
play. 
</P>
<P>
	Bobby Bowden said it would be a dream if the Seminoles win.  
</P>
<P>
	``It'll be a nightmare if we don't,'' he said. Then, referring  
to his wife, Ann, he said: ``We got to go up there and play Ann's 
boy, not mine, but Ann's.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Several other games with national title implications are set for  
next Saturday: No. 2 Penn State at No. 16 Purdue; No. 3 Nebraska at 
No. 18 Texas; and No. 5 Tennessee at No. 10 Alabama. 
</P>
<P>
	In results of other Top 25 games Saturday, it was: No. 2 Penn  
State 23, No. 18 Ohio State 10: No. 4 Virginia Tech 62, Syracuse 0; 
No. 6 Florida 32, Auburn 14; No. 7 Kansas State 40, Utah State 0; 
No. 8 Georgia Tech 38, Duke 31; and No. 10 Alabama 30, No. 25 
Mississippi 24. 
</P>
<P>
	Also, it was: No. 16 Purdue 52, No. 11 Michigan State 28; No. 13  
Texas A&AMP;M 34, Kansas 17; No. 14 Georgia 27, Vanderbilt 17; No. 17 
Wisconsin 59, Indiana 0; No. 19 BYU 31, New Mexico 7; and No. 21 
Southern Mississippi 24, Army 0.

</P>
<P>
                *No. 16 Purdue 52, No. 11 Michigan State 28    	
</P>
<P>
	At West Lafayette, Ind., the Spartans (6-1, 3-1 Big Ten) saw  
their title dreams shattered by Drew Brees, who threw for 509 yards 
and five first-half TDs and added a scoring run in the second half. 
</P>
<P>
	Chris Daniels, the league's leading pass catcher, set Big Ten  
records with 21 receptions for 301 yards for the Boilermakers (5-2, 
2-2). 
</P>
<P>
	``This is a very humbling game,'' said Michigan State coach Nick  
Saban, whose team ended Ohio State's perfect season bid last 
season. ``We got slammed. I wasn't pleased with the way we played 
at all.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In I-AA, Appalachian State (4-2) upset top-ranked Georgia  
Southern (5-2) 17-16; and Richmond surprised Hofstra, ranked No. 3, 
31-21. 
</P>
<P>
                           	THE BLOWOUTS   	
</P>
<P>
                   *No. 4 Virginia Tech 62, Syracuse 0    	
</P>
<P>
	At Blacksburg, Va., the Hokies (6-0, 2-0 Big East) moved to  
their best start since 1967 and showed they are a national title 
contender in handing the Orangemen (5-2, 2-1) their worst loss in 
77 years. 
</P>
<P>
	The dominating win -- Syracuse had 120 total yards -- led coach  
Frank Beamer to boast, ``We have the ability right now to get you 
in every way. I don't think we have a weakness.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He might be right. Michael Vick threw for 135 yards and one TD,  
Shyrone Stith ran for 140 yards and two TDs, and the defense scored 
twice on a fumble and interception returns. 
</P>
<P>
	It was the largest shutout loss by a ranked team in the  
63-year-old history of the AP poll. The previous largest was No. 1 
Army's 61-0 win over No. 6 Penn State in 1945. 
</P>
<P>
                    *No. 17 Wisconsin 59, Indiana 0    	
</P>
<P>
	At Madison, Wis., Ron Dayne ran for 167 of the Badgers'  
school-record 705 total yards, and the running back became just the 
fourth player in Division I to record four 1,000-yard rushing 
seasons. 
</P>
<P>
	Wisconsin (5-2, 3-1 Big Ten) led 38-0 by halftime, and Dayne sat  
out the second half. 
</P>
<P>
                        	THE RECORD-SETTER   	
</P>
<P>
	At Alliance, Ohio, Mount Union now owns the longest winning  
streak in college football history at 48 games after Saturday's 
44-20 win over Otterbein. 
</P>
<P>
	The Purple Raiders, shooting for a fourth consecutive Division  
III national title, broke Oklahoma's 47-game streak set 42 years 
ago under coach Bud Wilkinson. 
</P>
<P>
	``These games, that's what you like to play for,'' quarterback  
Gary Smeck said after throwing for 282 yards and three TDs. ``But 
I'm glad it's over. Now we'll get back in our routine. No more 
press conferences on Tuesdays.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A record crowd of 7,132 showed up at the 5,000-seat Mount Union  
Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
	Elsewhere:  
</P>
<P>
	At State College, Pa., Eric McCoo ran for a career-best 211  
yards and Penn State (7-0, 3-0 Big Ten) held Ohio State (4-3, 1-2) 
to 143 total yards and sacked Steve Bellisari eight times in an 
easy 23-10 win. 
</P>
<P>
	The Nittany Lions gave Joe Paterno career win No. 314, tying him  
for third place with Stagg for most victories among major college 
coaches. 
</P>
<P>
	At Oxford, Miss., Shaun Alexander ran for 214 yards and three  
TDs as Alabama (5-1, 4-0 SEC) held off Mississippi (5-2, 2-2) 
30-24. 
</P>
<P>
	Also, Jabari Holloway recovered Jarious Jackson's fumble in the  
end zone with 2:40 left to cap a 22-point comeback in Notre Dame's 
25-24 win over USC. ... As a light snow fell, Steve Smith caught 
two TD passes and returned a punt 61 yards for another score in 
Utah's 21-15 upset of Air Force. ... Brian Allen scored on 37- and 
20-yard runs in the fourth quarter as Stanford (4-2, 4-0 Pac-10) 
edged Oregon State (3-3-3, 0-3) 21-17. Stanford is 4-0 in the 
league for the first time since 1970. ... Ryan Kealy threw for 194 
yards and two TDs as Arizona State (3-3, 2-1 Pac-10) topped 
Washington (3-3, 2-1) 28-7. ... Arizona (5-2) won, too, as Ortege 
Jenkins threw for one TD and ran for another and Trung Canidate ran 
for 202 yards in a 34-21 victory over UTEP. ... Cal beat UCLA 17-0, 
the first time the Bruins were shut out since 1994. ... Arkansas

<HEADLINE> Tokyo Stocks Fall in Early Trading / Japanese Stocks  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TOKYO (AP) -- Japanese stocks fell broadly in early trading  
Monday after last week's sell-off on Wall Street. The dollar fell 
against the yen. 
</P>
<P>
	The benchmark 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average shed 189.58 points,  
or 1.09 percent, to 17,411.99 in the first hour of trading. On 
Friday, the index shed 178.69 points, or 1.00 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	The dollar bought 105.38 yen, down 0.40 yen from late Friday in  
Tokyo and also below its late New York level of 105.42 yen, also on 
Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	In Tokyo, share prices moved lower as sentiment was dampened by  
a sharp fall on Wall Street Friday after Federal Reserve Chairman 
Alan Greenspan expressed concern about U.S. stock prices. 
</P>
<P>
	On Friday, the Dow Jones industrial average lost 266.90 points,  
or 2.6 percent, to close at 10,019.71. At one point, the Dow 
slipped below 10,000 points. The average also recorded its worst 
weekly point drop in history, plummeting 630.05 points, or 5.9 
percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Traders in Tokyo said there was broad selling across the  
banking, brokerage, retail and high-technology sectors in early 
trading. 
</P>
<P>
	``Wall Street is expected to fall further for technical reasons,  
so it is difficult to go bargain hunting now,'' said Sachio 
Ishikawa, general manager of the stock division at Chuo Securities. 
</P>
<P>
	Greenspan's comments late Thursday suggesting that the stock  
market's great rally might abruptly end, were taken by many to mean 
the Fed would likely raise interest rates at its next Federal Open 
Market Operations meeting on Nov. 16. 
</P>
<P>
	The broader Tokyo Stock price index of all issues listed on the  
first section was down 35.96 points, or 2.44 percent, to 1,474.30. 
The TOPIX fell 26.48 points, or 1.72 percent, on Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	In currency dealings, traders said the dollar was under selling  
pressure amid nervousness over U.S. asset markets. 
</P>
<P>
	That pressure came after inflation fears resulting from the  
announcement Friday that U.S. wholesale prices rose 1.1 percent in 
September, far above the market estimate of 0.5 percent, spurred 
sales of the U.S. currency in New York by fueling further 
speculation that the Fed will raise lending rates next month. 
</P>
<P>
	In other currencies, the euro was trading at 115.21 yen, up from  
114.96 yen late Friday in Tokyo. 
</P>
<P>
	The yield on the benchmark 10-year Japanese government bond  
stood at 1.8150 percent, unchanged from Friday's close. Its price 
remained at 99.01 yen.

<HEADLINE> New Spine Injury Therapy Studied </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Rats recovered partially from spinal cord injury  
when they were treated quickly with a substance pumped out by 
immune-system cells, an indicator of a possible new therapy, 
researchers report. 
</P>
<P>
	While the rats were still impaired, the substance worked better  
than a drug currently given immediately after spinal cord injuries 
to promote recovery, said researcher W. Dalton Dietrich. 
</P>
<P>
	The substance, interleukin-10, might someday replace that  
standard drug, methylprednisolone, or be used in combination with 
it, he and colleagues suggest in the October issue of the Journal 
of Neurotrauma. 
</P>
<P>
	Dietrich is scientific director of the Miami Project to Cure  
Paralysis and professor of neurological surgery and neurology at 
the University of Miami School of Medicine. 
</P>
<P>
	Dr. Wise Young of Rutgers University, who didn't participate in  
the study, said he believed interleukin-10 could turn out to be a 
better therapy than the standard drug. It would be the first major 
advance in treating people who've just suffered spinal cord injury 
since methylprednisolone was shown to be effective in 1990, he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Interleukin-10 has been given to many people for bowel disorders  
and arthritis with no serious side effects, even at doses higher 
than the rats got, Dietrich said. Scientists might start testing 
its effect when given soon after human spinal cord injuries within 
the next year, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	It's not clear why interleukin-10 helped the rats. It does  
dampen inflammation, in which blood cells congregate and pump out 
potentially harmful substances, and inflammation is thought to 
damage the spinal cord after injury, Dietrich said. 
</P>
<P>
	In any case, interleukin-10 appears to help nerves survive a  
crushing injury, and the study found evidence that it also helps 
injured fibers regenerate, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	In the experiment, nine rats were injected in the leg with  
interleukin-10 a half-hour after their spinal cords were partially 
crushed. Nine others were given an inert injection. The treated 
rats showed better recovery starting two weeks later and extending 
to the end of the experiment, eight weeks after the injury. 
</P>
<P>
	The rats that got the inert injection were able to step with  
their hind legs, but only in an uncoordinated way. In the treated 
rats, the hind legs supported body weight better and showed much 
better coordination. 
</P>
<P>
	Scientists are now working with rats to see if interleukin-10 is  
still effective if given later than a half-hour after injury.

<HEADLINE> Pettitte Proves His Value to Boss </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BOSTON (AP) -- George Steinbrenner once again got a good look at  
why Andy Pettitte means so much to the New York Yankees in October. 
</P>
<P>
	Watching from a front-row seat next to the dugout Sunday night,  
the owner saw -- and applauded, even -- as Pettitte pitched the 
Yankees within one victory of a return trip to the World Series. 
</P>
<P>
	``Pretty much the way he's pitched every time he's had to pitch  
a good game,'' manager Joe Torre praised. 
</P>
<P>
	Pettitte's 9-2 victory over the Boston Red Sox gave the Yankees  
a 3-1 edge in the AL Championship Series. It was his second win of 
the postseason and reinforced his reputation as one of the Yankees' 
best big-game performers. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was a huge win for us in a very emotional game for me,''  
Pettitte said. 
</P>
<P>
	Not bad for a guy that Steinbrenner challenged in midseason to  
``show what kind of man he is.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Steinbrenner made the remark after Torre and general manager  
Brian Cashman persuaded the Boss not to ship Pettitte -- a deal was 
close with Philadelphia -- before the July 31 trading deadline. 
</P>
<P>
	At the time, Pettitte was 7-8 and seemed distracted, possibly by  
his father's heart problems back in Texas. 
</P>
<P>
	``Mechanically and mentally, I struggled,'' he said.  
</P>
<P>
	Since that time, helped along by pitching coach Mel Stottlemyre,  
he proved his worth, over and over again in finishing 14-11. 
</P>
<P>
	After Pettitte pitched 7 1-3 innings to beat Texas in Game 2 of  
the division series -- Steinbrenner personally complimented him in 
the Yankee Stadium clubhouse -- he came back with another 7 1-3 
effective innings against Boston. 
</P>
<P>
	Troy O'Leary hit an RBI single in the second and Jose Offerman  
singled home a run in the third. 
</P>
<P>
	Pettitte eventually struck out Mike Stanley with runners on  
first and second to end the third. The Red Sox did not get another 
runner past first against the left-hander. 
</P>
<P>
	``I worked my way out of a number of jams by getting ground  
balls when I needed them,'' Pettitte said. 
</P>
<P>
	Pettitte was pulled after a one-out infield single by Offerman  
in the eighth. As Mariano Rivera came in from the bullpen, Pettitte 
got a big cheer from Yankees fans near the third-base dugout. 
</P>
<P>
	Steinbrenner stayed in his seat to clap along, then took a sip  
from a water bottle as Pettitte accepted congratulations. 
</P>
<P>
	Pettitte allowed eight hits, walked one and struck out five in  
improving to 6-4 lifetime in postseason play. His 4.52 ERA is not 
overly impressive, but it does not reflect how clutch he has been. 
</P>
<P>
	Pettitte beat Atlanta 1-0 in the pivotal Game 5 of the 1996  
World Series, and also pitched shutout ball as the Yankees 
completed a sweep of San Diego in last year's World Series. 
</P>
<P>
	And now the Yankees are one win away from their third World  
Series in four years. Torre couldn't think of a better person to 
put them in that position than Pettitte. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's such a good guy to go along with everything else that  
he's been through,'' Torre said.

<HEADLINE> Report: Minority Students Lagging </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Black and Hispanic students lag behind white and  
Asian students academically -- even when they come from similarly 
privileged backgrounds, according to a new report. 
</P>
<P>
	To bridge the gap, the report issued Sunday by the College Board  
recommends tutoring, mentoring and other support to minority 
students in all grades and from all socioeconomic backgrounds. 
</P>
<P>
	The New York-based College Board administers the SATs.  
</P>
<P>
	``We are not just talking about disadvantaged youngsters,'' said  
Gaston Caperton, president of the College Board. ``Even minority 
students from relatively wealthy families with well-educated 
parents do not typically perform as well as white and Asian 
students from similar backgrounds.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Surveying data going back to the 1960s, the report found that  
academic underachievement among black and Hispanic students begins 
in the earliest grades and persists all the way into higher 
education. 
</P>
<P>
	Even among students whose parents had PhDs and high incomes,  
some black and Hispanic students tended to get lower test scores 
and grades than white and Asian students. The wealthier minority 
students' ``patterns of academic achievement tend to resemble those 
of less affluent whites and Asian Americans,'' the report said. 
</P>
<P>
	The report found some signs of progress. For example, the gap in  
average math scores for 17-year-old minorities versus white 
students decreased by 30 percent between the early 1970s and the 
mid-1990s. And 87 percent of all black students graduate from high 
school or pass equivalency tests -- about the same rate as white 
students. 
</P>
<P>
	In seeking answers about why some minorities might not perform  
as well academically as their white and Asian peers, the report 
noted that some experts cited racism, and peer pressure that 
disparages intellectual achievement.

<HEADLINE> What's Next for Wall Street? </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Stocks swooned last week under an unusual  
barrage of bad news. Market watchers are divided on whether stocks 
can rebound in the week to come, as expectations of good news about 
corporate profits and potentially bad news about inflation battle 
for investors' attention. 
</P>
<P>
	Last week, bad news won out, driving the Dow Jones industrial  
average down 630.05 points, or 5.9 percent, to close at 10,019.71. 
It was the Dow's worst week ever in terms of points lost, and the 
worst of the decade in terms of percentages. 
</P>
<P>
	Market analysts aren't sure whether the decline has laid ground  
for a further selloff, or opened the door to bargain-hunting 
investors who could once again propel stocks higher. 
</P>
<P>
	``We may have reached an oversold condition that will bring  
buyers back in,'' said Eugene E. Peroni, director of equity 
research at John Nuveen &AMP; Co. ``And that could set the stage for a 
better and more sustainable move later on.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Other analysts say stocks could be in for another rough week as  
last week's main menace -- the fear that signs of inflation will 
prompt the Federal Reserve to raise interest rates for the third 
time this year -- remains unresolved. 
</P>
<P>
	The Fed left rates unchanged at its last meeting, but hinted  
that it would boost rates if inflation appears to be escalating. 
That set a stage for fitful trading as investors watch carefully 
for any nascent signs of price pressures, analysts said. 
</P>
<P>
	That proved true on Friday, when a sharper-than-expected  
increase in the Producer Price Index sparked selling on Wall 
Street. 
</P>
<P>
	``The market can handle higher rates, but it cannot handle  
uncertainty,'' said Peter Canelo, U.S. investment strategist at 
Morgan Stanley Dean Witter. ``By failing to raise rates, the Fed 
opted to extend this torture for another month,'' until its 
policy-making group holds its next meeting Nov. 16. 
</P>
<P>
	The next major barometer of inflation will be the Consumer Price  
Index, due out from the Labor Department on Tuesday. If it shows 
that prices are on the rise, stocks could be in for another fall, 
analysts said. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, most market watchers continue to hope buyers will step  
back in if the next round of corporate profit reports is as strong 
as expected. Companies are expected to benefit from robust economic 
growth. Earnings should look especially good in comparison to the 
third quarter of 1998, when most businesses struggled with the 
fallout from Asia's financial crisis. 
</P>
<P>
	Last week, strong reports from companies like Apple and Boeing  
were outweighed by disappointments from Intel and Raytheon. In the 
coming week, industry leaders like Citigroup, Ford, Microsoft and 
IBM will compete for investors' attention as they divulge their 
earnings results. 
</P>
<P>
	Of course, strong earnings may not be enough to lift investors'  
spirits if the market's decline has eroded the optimism that has 
characterized the stock market for nearly 10 years, analysts said. 
</P>
<P>
	``Throughout this bull market, people have proven willing to buy  
on the market's dips,'' said Michael Metz, portfolio manager at 
CIBC Oppenheimer. ``If people become less willing to do that, it 
would be troubling.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Noting that some of the market's worst performances in history  
have come on the Monday following a Friday selloff, some analysts 
suggested that investors may have used the weekend to solidify 
their plans to get out of the market. 
</P>
<P>
	``While stocks may experience a short-lived bounce to start on  
Monday, investors will likely be overtaken by fears that compounded 
over the weekend,'' said Brian G. Belski, chief investment 
strategist at George K. Baum &AMP; Co. in Kansas City, Mo. 
</P>
<P>
	But by the same token, stocks may also benefit if investors  
return from the weekend with a sense of calm about the market's 
fundamental strength, analysts said. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's some cynicism and skittishness out there, but we have  
not sensed panic in the streets,'' said Jim Weiss, deputy chief 
investment officer for equities at State Street Research and 
Management Co. in Boston. ``I expect to see some buying on a 
selective basis.''

<HEADLINE> Chasen's Memorabilia Auctioned </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BEVERLY HILLS, Calif. (AP) -- Chasen's restaurant, where Ronald  
Reagan proposed to his second wife and Jimmy Stewart held his 
bachelor party, served up one last helping of Hollywood lore on 
Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	The famed gathering place for the movie industry's mightiest,  
which closed in 1995, auctioned its restaurant equipment and nearly 
60 years of memorabilia. 
</P>
<P>
	A photograph of Frank Sinatra and friends at Chasen's sold for  
$250, while an autographed picture of comedian Jerry Lewis went to 
a bidder for $225. 
</P>
<P>
	Other items for auction included an autographed picture of Clark  
Gable, a telegram from Howard Hughes and a booth favored by Alfred 
Hitchcock. 
</P>
<P>
	Brian Peck of Los Angeles said his parents brought him to eat at  
Chasen's for his 18th birthday, in 1978, and they sat across from 
Sinatra. 
</P>
<P>
	``My mother was going to try to get him to come over and sing  
`Happy Birthday' all night, and my father was mortified,'' Peck 
said. ``He said he would never speak with her again if she did.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Peck said he was interested in bidding on an autographed picture  
of Hitchcock hanging in Chasen's office. 
</P>
<P>
	Chasen's was opened by comedian Dave Chasen as a barbecue stand  
in 1936 and grew into a glamour spot for Hollywood's elite. 
Regulars in its exclusive front room included Humphrey Bogart, 
George Burns and Gracie Allen and Jack Benny. 
</P>
<P>
	Maude Chasen, now in her 90s, continued to run the restaurant  
after her husband died in 1973. 
</P>
<P>
	After closing, the restaurant licensed its name to another  
group, which opened a new Chasen's at a different location. 
</P>
<P>
	Ralph Woodworth, chief executive of Chasen's, said business was  
still all right when the restaurant closed ``but its heyday had 
passed. Younger crowds thought it was kind of a bastion for their 
parents.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The film industry had become more businesslike than the days  
when Chasen's served as a meeting place for movie deals, Woodworth 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	``The star system wasn't the same as when agents wanted to take  
their clients out to present them to producers,'' Woodworth said. 
</P>
<P>
	Chasen's VIP booth, reserved for the most notable diner, was on  
the auction block Sunday. The booth where Reagan proposed to future 
wife Nancy, though, is being donated to the Reagan Presidential 
Library. 
</P>
<P>
	The restaurant was sold right down to the etched windows,  
mirrors and doors. An antique tea cart went for $500. Also on the 
auction block was a silver-plated serving tray used at Stewart's 
bachelor party. 
</P>
<P>
	Chasen's was known for hearty fare. Among its specialties were  
seafood on ice, creamed spinach and the hobo steak, a sliced New 
York slab of beef cooked in butter and served on toast points with 
souffled potatoes. 
</P>
<P>
	The restaurant's chili was favored by President John F. Kennedy  
and Elizabeth Taylor, who had it frozen and flown to Rome during 
filming of ``Cleopatra.''

<HEADLINE> Jaguars 24, Browns 7 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	JACKSONVILLE, Fla. (AP) -- Mark Brunell got hurt. The  
Jacksonville Jaguars stumbled, bumbled and embarrassed themselves. 
Finally, it was Jay Fiedler who smoothed things over. 
</P>
<P>
	Entering in the third quarter for a banged-up Brunell, the  
fourth-year veteran from Dartmouth directed two touchdown drives 
and another for a field goal Sunday to help the Jaguars defeat the 
Cleveland Browns 24-7. 
</P>
<P>
	Before he left with bruised ribs, Brunell continued to struggle,  
throwing for 109 yards and leading Jacksonville (5-1) to just a 
pair of field goals. 
</P>
<P>
	Until Fiedler entered, it seemed almost any other team but the  
expansion Browns might have beaten the Jaguars, who continued to 
struggle on offense in the absence of former offensive coordinator 
Chris Palmer, who left to coach the Browns (0-6). 
</P>
<P>
	Jacksonville trailed 7-6 late in the third quarter when  
linebacker Bryan Schwartz forced a fumble that was recovered by 
Kevin Hardy at the Cleveland 25. 
</P>
<P>
	Three plays later, Fiedler lobbed a pass to the corner of the  
end zone to Kyle Brady, who extended for a nice catch in double 
coverage and a 7-yard touchdown. A 2-point conversion made it 14-7. 
</P>
<P>
	After Jacksonville forced a punt, Fiedler directed the best  
drive of the day, a 70-yard march that included completions to 
three different receivers and ended with a 2-yard touchdown run by 
James Stewart. 
</P>
<P>
	Playing for the injured Fred Taylor, Stewart finished with 58  
yards on 23 carries. Fiedler went 12-for-14 for 113 yards and also 
scrambled three times for 27 yards. 
</P>
<P>
	When Fiedler entered, the Jaguars defense perked up, as well,  
coming up with four sacks and shutting down a Cleveland offense 
that effectively ate up small chunks of yardage through the first 
half. 
</P>
<P>
	Tim Couch completed his first 12 passes and finished 18-for-23  
for 161 yards, running through his progressions with confidence and 
staying poised in the pocket when the Jacksonville pass rush 
developed. 
</P>
<P>
	He flipped a short screen to Terry Kirby for a 9-yard touchdown  
late in the second quarter that gave the Browns a 7-3 lead and 
brought boos from a crowd that expected more from the AFC Central 
champions. 
</P>
<P>
	The embarrassment extended beyond just football.  
</P>
<P>
	Late in the first half, Jaguars offensive line coach Mike Maser  
ran well onto the field to protest a hit on Brunell, who was 
lightly shoved to the ground by Browns linebacker Jamir Miller. 
Maser was hit for an unsportsmanlike conduct penalty, pulling the 
Jaguars out of scoring range. 
</P>
<P>
	In the fourth quarter, Jaguars linebacker Brant Boyer got  
involved in a shoving match with teammate Gary Walker as the 
defense was coming off the field. The jawing -- and shoving -- 
continued on the sideline until Brunell, out of the game but still 
on the sideline at that point, stepped in to calm things down. 
</P>
<P>
	Brunell completed 12 of 18 passes and once again had trouble  
leading the Jaguars to touchdowns. Twice in the first half, he 
moved Jacksonville inside the 20-yard line, but both times, the 
Jaguars settled for field goals.

<HEADLINE> Chargers 13, Seahawks 10 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SAN DIEGO (AP) -- The wacky AFC West has been turned on its head.  
</P>
<P>
	The San Diego Chargers, who finished last in the division each  
of the last two years, are alone at the top after a 13-10 win 
Sunday over another surprising contender, the Seattle Seahawks. 
</P>
<P>
	Up until the final 3 minutes, it was a pretty ugly day for the  
Chargers, from Erik Kramer's four interceptions in the second half 
to linebacker Junior Seau's garish blond dye job, which was on 
display for all to see as he walked out to midfield for the pregame 
coin toss. 
</P>
<P>
	Somehow, despite all the offense's misfiring, the Chargers  
managed to get into position for John Carney, who kicked two field 
goals in the final 2:54, including the game-winning 41-yarder as 
time expired. 
</P>
<P>
	The Chargers, under rookie head coach Mike Riley, improved to  
4-1. Seattle, in its first year under Mike Holmgren, dropped to 
3-2. 
</P>
<P>
	``This was a big win. I can't overemphasize that,'' said Seau,  
who rattled Seattle quarterback Jon Kitna in the first half and 
threw running back Ricky Watters for a big loss in the second half. 
``It will carry us a long way. 
</P>
<P>
	``To be 4-1, it doesn't happen often in San Diego,'' Seau added.  
``These young guys here really need to appreciate this because 
winning in this league is hard to do.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Seau had to dye his hair Saturday night -- it looked more neon  
orange than blond -- because his alma mater, Southern Cal, lost to 
Carney's school, Notre Dame. 
</P>
<P>
	``I tell you what, I love Notre Dame right now,'' Seau said. ``I  
will wear this hair anytime John Carney does that for me. It's just 
a great feeling. I'm so happy right now.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Chargers could just as easily have ended up as pretenders,  
although their defense once again came up big by holding Seattle to 
just 201 yards. Pro Bowl safety Rodney Harrison missed the second 
half with a bruised left shoulder. 
</P>
<P>
	Kramer was intercepted on San Diego's first four drives of the  
second half, but the Seahawks capitalized on just the first one, by 
Brian Walker, setting up Jon Kitna's 1-yard TD pass to backup tight 
end Itula Mili for a 10-7 lead with 5:37 left in the third quarter. 
</P>
<P>
	Carney kicked a 28-yard field goal with 2:54 left to tie the  
game at 10. After struggling to find his wide receivers all day, 
Kramer threw a 41-yard pass to Jeff Graham on the drive's first 
play. 
</P>
<P>
	Kramer suddenly turned perfect on the winning drive, completing  
four straight passes to move the Chargers from their 32-yard line 
to the Seattle 23, where Natrone Means ran it once to set up 
Carney's kick. 
</P>
<P>
	The Chargers called timeout with 3 seconds left, then Carney,  
who had missed badly left on a 42-yard try in the first quarter, 
had a perfect kick to set off a wild celebration. 
</P>
<P>
	Carney said the earlier miss was due to misreading the wind and  
pulling the ball. As he lined up for the final time he was 
thinking, ``Don't do what I did in the first quarter, think 
positive thoughts, put a good foot on the ball and make sure I had 
the wind figured out this time. 
</P>
<P>
	``I give a lot of credit to Erik Kramer for hanging in there and  
doing the job at the end,'' Carney added. 
</P>
<P>
	After all the turnovers, ``it was a matter of relaxing and just  
letting it happen,'' Kramer said. ``A lot of times it was not 
pretty, but there are games that will be pretty coming up.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Riley said only one of the interceptions was due to a bad  
decision by Kramer, and he never thought about taking him out. 
</P>
<P>
	``I like to let veteran quarterbacks play their way out of it,''  
Riley said. 
</P>
<P>
	San Diego's anemic offense finished with 330 yards, 90 coming on  
the last two drives. Kramer, making his second straight start in 
relief of injured Jim Harbaugh, was 27-of-44 for 296 yards. 
</P>
<P>
	San Diego had lost five straight to the Seahawks.  
</P>
<P>
	``We should have won this game,'' Watters said. ``We had the  
perfect opportunity. As an offense we're really frustrated right 
now because we know we are better than this.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Chris Canty, Cortez Kennedy and Willie Williams also intercepted  
Kramer, but the Seahawks followed those pickoffs with a punt, a 
missed 48-yard field goal attempt by Todd Peterson and another 
punt. 
</P>
<P>
	San Diego had led 7-3 after Means' 5-yard touchdown run with 42  
seconds before halftime. Means bounced off a pile and beat a 
defender to the right pylon. 
</P>
<P>
	That touchdown was set up by Darryll Lewis' interception.  
</P>
<P>
	Kitna was 17-of-29 for 151 yards, with one interception.  
</P>
<P>
	Seattle's Ricky Watters was held to 54 yards on 21 carries, the  
24th straight game in which the Chargers have not allowed a runner 
to gain 100 yards. 
</P>
<P>
	Peterson kicked a 40-yard field goal in the second quarter.  
</P>
<P>
 *Notes:* The last time the Chargers started 4-1 was 1996, when they  
promptly lost their next three games en route to an 8-8 finish that 
led to coach Bobby Ross being forced out. ... San Diego has scored 
one or fewer touchdowns 26 times in its last 37 games. ... Kitna is 
6-4 as a starter. His losses have been by a combined 19 points. ... 
Seattle has gone five games without a rushing touchdown for the 
first time since the 1992 season.

<HEADLINE> U.S., Russia Discuss Missile Shield </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- U.S. plans to deploy a nationwide  
anti-ballistic missile defense shield might require changes in a 
quarter-century-old anti-nuclear treaty that limits such systems, 
President Clinton's chief of staff said Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	John Podesta indicated the changes are the focus of discussions  
between the United States and Russia about the proposed deployment. 
</P>
<P>
	Podesta, appearing on ABC's ``This Week,'' would not talk about  
details of the discussions, specifically reports Sunday that the 
Americans are offering to help complete major defensive radar 
projects in Russia in exchange for Russian agreement to alter the 
1972 Anti-Ballistic Missile treaty. 
</P>
<P>
	The New York Times and The Washington Post reported that under  
the proposal, the United States would help Russia finish its radar 
arrays near Irkutsk, Siberia, that is oriented across Russia's vast 
southeastern coast and covers North Korea and other nations. 
</P>
<P>
	Podesta said in the discussions with the Russians, ``We are  
considering the issue of deploying a national defense system to 
deal with (nuclear) proliferation.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He said the planned deployment ``may necessitate adjustments in  
the (ABM) treaty.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton administration officials say North Korea and Iran, both  
said to be trying to develop nuclear arsenals and delivery systems 
that could reach U.S. territory, are among ``rogue states'' that 
the U.S. defense shield is to protect against. 
</P>
<P>
	The radar-enhancement idea drew no fire from senators of either  
party Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	Republican presidential hopeful Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., said  
it is clear that the Nixon-era ABM treaty needs changes. His GOP 
colleague, Sen. Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., said ``whatever it takes 
... to protect our people'' should be done. 
</P>
<P>
	Democratic Sen. Robert Torricelli of New Jersey expressed hope  
that members of both parties, bitterly divided by last week's 
scrapping of a treaty to ban nuclear testing, can ``together work 
with the Russians to save the (ABM) treaty.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Even with the test-ban treaty, Torricelli said, ``the United  
States is going to need at least some limited ballistic missile 
defense.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The three lawmakers spoke on NBC's ``Meet the Press.''  
</P>
<P>
	Just two weeks ago, the commander of Russia's strategic missile  
forces, Col. Gen. Vladimir Yakovlev, said the United States would 
trigger a Cold War-style arms race by developing a missile shield 
in violation of the 1972 Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty. It would 
threaten all disarmament agreements between the two countries, 
Yakovlev said.

<HEADLINE> New Spine Injury Therapy Studied </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Rats recovered partially from spinal cord injury  
when they were treated quickly with a substance pumped out by 
immune-system cells, an indicator of a possible new therapy, 
researchers report. 
</P>
<P>
	While the rats were still impaired, the substance worked better  
than a drug currently given immediately after spinal cord injuries 
to promote recovery, said researcher W. Dalton Dietrich. 
</P>
<P>
	The substance, interleukin-10, might someday replace that  
standard drug, methylprednisolone, or be used in combination with 
it, he and colleagues suggest in the October issue of the Journal 
of Neurotrauma. 
</P>
<P>
	Dietrich is scientific director of the Miami Project to Cure  
Paralysis and professor of neurological surgery and neurology at 
the University of Miami School of Medicine. 
</P>
<P>
	Dr. Wise Young of Rutgers University, who didn't participate in  
the study, said he believed interleukin-10 could turn out to be a 
better therapy than the standard drug. It would be the first major 
advance in treating people who've just suffered spinal cord injury 
since methylprednisolone was shown to be effective in 1990, he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Interleukin-10 has been given to many people for bowel disorders  
and arthritis with no serious side effects, even at doses higher 
than the rats got, Dietrich said. Scientists might start testing 
its effect when given soon after human spinal cord injuries within 
the next year, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	It's not clear why interleukin-10 helped the rats. It does  
dampen inflammation, in which blood cells congregate and pump out 
potentially harmful substances, and inflammation is thought to 
damage the spinal cord after injury, Dietrich said. 
</P>
<P>
	In any case, interleukin-10 appears to help nerves survive a  
crushing injury, and the study found evidence that it also helps 
injured fibers regenerate, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	In the experiment, nine rats were injected in the leg with  
interleukin-10 a half-hour after their spinal cords were partially 
crushed. Nine others were given an inert injection. The treated 
rats showed better recovery starting two weeks later and extending 
to the end of the experiment, eight weeks after the injury. 
</P>
<P>
	The rats that got the inert injection were able to step with  
their hind legs, but only in an uncoordinated way. In the treated 
rats, the hind legs supported body weight better and showed much 
better coordination. 
</P>
<P>
	Scientists are now working with rats to see if interleukin-10 is  
still effective if given later than a half-hour after injury.

<HEADLINE> Low-Carb Diet Called Unhealthy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ATLANTA (AP) -- On a typical morning, Ron Glasgow eats a  
three-egg omelet and a 12-ounce package of bacon or a half-pound of 
ham. For the rest of the day, he can eat all the pork rinds, beef 
jerky, sausage and steak he wants. 
</P>
<P>
	After 11 months on this diet, he's gone from 425 to 330 pounds.  
</P>
<P>
	Glasgow and others claim to have shed stubborn fat by laying off  
carbohydrates and sugars. They stick to a menu of unlimited meat, 
cheese and eggs -- no sweets, rice, pasta or bread. 
</P>
<P>
	Many dietitians and health experts, 10,000 of whom will be in  
Atlanta this week for the American Dietic Association's annual 
meeting, say the diet is an unhealthy fad and the weight loss is 
temporary. 
</P>
<P>
	The high-protein, no-carb plan is ``a nightmare of a diet,''  
said Kathleen Zelman, a registered dietitian and ADA spokeswoman. 
``At first, it sounds so alluring. You get the green light to eat 
these foods.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But she said the monotony soon gets old. Sure, you get the  
hamburger, but no bun or fries. You can eat a big steak, but forget 
the baked potato and tossed salad. 
</P>
<P>
	Plus, it's just unhealthy, nutritionists say. Along with the  
risk of increasing cholesterol levels, the diet could cause kidney 
problems or possibly a loss of calcium in the bones, Ms. Zelman 
said. Limiting the intake of carbohydrates to such a dramatically 
low level starves the body of needed nutrients and it causes an 
artificial metabolic state. 
</P>
<P>
	``Think of it on a global perspective -- the world at large  
survives on grains,'' Ms. Zelman said. ``If we didn't have 
carbohydrates, we would not be able to survive. Bread is the staff 
of life.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The low-carb diet was first touted by Dr. Robert Atkins more  
than 20 years ago. Its popularity in the '90s has been attributed 
to his latest book ``Dr. Atkins' New Diet Revolution,'' currently 
the best-selling mass market paperback in the country. 
</P>
<P>
	Glasgow, a 39-year-old computer support technician from Cumming,  
said the diet allows him to lose weight and continue to be a ``big 
eater.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm aware of some of the opponents, but for me right now, it  
seems to be working,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Glasgow said he lost 100 pounds once before on a low-fat, high  
exercise diet. He took a two-month leave of absence from his job 
and exercised 6 to 8 hours a day. But when he switched to a more 
reasonable schedule, the weight stopped coming off and he went back 
to his old ways. 
</P>
<P>
	With studies showing exercise at an all-time low and more than  
half of all adults overweight, Americans are constantly searching 
for a way to slim down without drastically changing their 
lifestyles. 
</P>
<P>
	The increasing number of unhealthy and overweight adults and  
children is a particularly troubling issue the ADA will discuss at 
its four-day meeting, which starts Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	The group will also discuss food safety, children's health and  
reducing the risks of heart disease and colon cancer through diet. 
</P>
<P>
	Like other health organizations, the ADA maintains the only way  
to lose weight is through a healthy, well-balanced diet and 
exercise. 
</P>
<P>
	Atkins has dismissed criticism of his diet as ``dietitian talk''  
and points out that many people have maintained their weight loss 
for years and lowered their cholesterol by following his plan. 
</P>
<P>
	Glasgow and others who've lost weight on the plan will probably  
gain it back, Ms. Zelman says. The initial weight loss occurs 
because, without carbohydrates, the body is forced to burn fat and 
protein for fuel -- but that creates fatigue. Also, the monotony of 
the diet gets some people to eat less. 
</P>
<P>
	Sooner or later, the dieter will have to go back to at least  
moderate carbohydrate consumption. When they do, the weight will 
likely return. 
</P>
<P>
	Her advice for anyone who considers going on the diet is to  
consult their doctor, drink plenty of fluids and take a 
multivitamin, mineral supplement. 
</P>
<P>
	``Realize it's a short-term fix,'' she said. ``Ultimately, you  
will have to face reality of weight management.''

<HEADLINE> Forbes, Dole Target GOP Women </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SEATTLE (AP) -- Steve Forbes and Elizabeth Dole, trying to make  
headway against the juggernaut of Republican front-runner George W. 
Bush, on Sunday urged GOP women activists to give a second look at 
their bids for the White House. 
</P>
<P>
	Forbes, a conservative publisher able to tap his personal wealth  
to challenge Bush, presented himself as a reform-minded 
``independent outsider'' who offers more substance and specific 
positions than Bush. 
</P>
<P>
	He drew repeated ovations from the 2,000 delegates at the  
National Federation of Republican Women's last convention before 
the 2000 elections. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Dole got a heroine's welcome at the convention a few hours  
later. She was introduced as a lifelong trailblazer and the first 
woman with a credible shot at a major party presidential 
nomination. 
</P>
<P>
	Federation President Mary Jo Arndt of Illinois urged delegates  
to write out a generous check to Mrs. Dole, even if they support 
Bush or someone else, as a tribute to her courage. 
</P>
<P>
	Neither candidate, however, got the star treatment given Friday  
night to Bush, the governor of Texas, who has a commanding lead in 
the polls and has broken all fund-raising records. The audience for 
Bush's speech was considerably larger than those who stuck around 
for Forbes and Mrs. Dole on Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	But the two candidates showed no sign of preparing to quit the  
race. 
</P>
<P>
	Forbes was the more aggressive in taking on Bush and a  
Democratic candidate, Vice President Al Gore. He appeared to lump 
the two together at one point, complaining about the ``gap, the 
disconnect, between the political culture'' and ordinary citizens. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Dole was the sentimental favorite of the convention,  
though. She was surrounded by autograph-seekers and well-wishers as 
she sat at the block-long head table. 
</P>
<P>
	She was repeatedly interrupted with applause as she gave her  
standard campaign speech, complete with stories from the campaign 
trail and numerous references to ``my husband, Bob,'' the 1996 GOP 
nominee. 
</P>
<P>
	She said more than half her contributors are women -- an aide  
called her ``the only candidate with no gender gap'' -- and that her 
campaign has attracted young people and others who rarely get 
involved in politics. She was introduced as ``one of America's most 
powerful and admired women, always ahead of her time.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Like Forbes, she called for tax cuts and parental choice in  
education.

<HEADLINE> Red Sox One Loss From Elimination </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BOSTON (AP) -- The last time the Boston Red Sox went to the World  
Series, they made it by rallying from a 3-1 deficit in the 1986 AL 
Championship Series. 
</P>
<P>
	Thirteen frustrating years later, that's the only way they can  
get back. 
</P>
<P>
	Sunday night's 9-2 loss to the New York Yankees in Game 4 of the  
ALCS left the Red Sox with just one option: win Monday night or 
extend their championship drought to 81 years. 
</P>
<P>
	But the Red Sox haven't given up.  
</P>
<P>
	A note on their clubhouse bulletin board after Sunday's loss  
read: ``Pack for travel after Monday night's game.'' 
</P>
<P>
	To make that trip back to New York for a Game 6 on Wednesday  
night, the Red Sox hope left-hander Kent Mercker, who has a 6.35 
ERA in 5 2-3 postseason innings this year, can come through. 
</P>
<P>
	He'll start against Orlando Hernandez, the Yankees' hottest  
pitcher. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're really not looking at the three games right now,''  
Boston third baseman John Valentin said. ``Now, obviously, you have 
to look at tomorrow. We're facing a tough pitcher and he's had 
success against us in the past and we've got to go get him.'' 
</P>
<P>
	On Sunday, Bret Saberhagen pitched better than in his two other  
postseason starts this year -- one earned run and five hits in six 
innings -- but the Red Sox still couldn't beat the Yankees. 
</P>
<P>
	Two questionable calls by umpires didn't help.  
</P>
<P>
	Second-base umpire Tim Tschida admitted he was wrong when he  
ruled Chuck Knoblauch had tagged Jose Offerman on the front end of 
a double play in the eighth with New York ahead 3-2. 
</P>
<P>
	And in the ninth, first-base umpire Dale Scott ruled Nomar  
Garciaparra out at first on a grounder to third baseman Scott 
Brosius. Replays indicated Garciaparra beat the throw. 
</P>
<P>
	``Tough loss,'' Saberhagen said. ``I think the big thing is  
we've got to put this behind us and play baseball like we have.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The last time Boston won the World Series was 1918 with Babe  
Ruth pitching the team to victory in Games 1 and 4. That was the 
Red Sox's fifth and most recent title. 
</P>
<P>
	Before the 1920 season, Ruth was traded to the Yankees, who are  
closing in on their 25th World Series crown. 
</P>
<P>
	Now, the Red Sox have a Ruth on their side. The Babe's daughter,  
Julia Ruth Stevens, is scheduled to throw out the first pitch 
Monday night. She has been a summer resident of New Hampshire for 
50 years. 
</P>
<P>
	Just before she moved there, the Red Sox had a chance to go to  
the World Series, in 1948. Boston and Cleveland tied for the AL 
pennant, but the Indians won a one-game playoff 8-3 at Fenway Park. 
</P>
<P>
	On Sunday, Boston catcher Carlton Fisk threw out the first  
pitch. It was Fisk who waved his winning homer fair in Game 6 of 
the 1975 World Series. Once again, a title proved elusive as 
Cincinnati won the championship the next day 4-3. 
</P>
<P>
	Improbable as it is, it's not impossible for the Red Sox to  
climb off the brink of elimination by winning three straight games. 
</P>
<P>
	They did it in the 1986 ALCS by beating the California Angels  
after trailing 5-2 going into the top of the ninth of Game 5. The 
Red Sox scored four runs in the inning and went on to a 7-6 win in 
11 innings. They won the series by winning the next two games 10-4 
and 8-1, with current Yankee Roger Clemens pitching the clincher. 
</P>
<P>
	They also won three straight games to take this year's best-of-5  
division series, beating the Cleveland Indians 9-3, 23-7 and 12-8. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're down three games to one,'' Nomar Garciaparra said. ``Can  
we come back? Sure we can. We did it before.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But the Yankees are the defending World Series champions and  
have a much better pitching staff than the Indians. 
</P>
<P>
	And the Red Sox have a long history of October anguish that  
continued Sunday with some bad plays by themselves and bad calls by 
umpires. 
</P>
<P>
	General manager Dan Duquette was asked his general feeling about  
those calls. 
</P>
<P>
	``My general feeling,'' he said, ``is that we need to win  
tomorrow's game.''

<HEADLINE> 14 Held Hostage in Colombia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BOGOTA, Colombia (AP) -- Suspected guerrillas posing as  
passengers hijacked a tourist boat off Colombia's Pacific coast, 
abducting 14 men before releasing the vessel, its captain and the 
women and children aboard, the navy reported Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	Four assailants with concealed weapons boarded the boat Saturday  
in Buenaventura, a major western port, then forced it to land at a 
beach where they took away the male passengers. 
</P>
<P>
	``An armed man took the steering wheel, threatened us and made  
us look downward,'' Patricia Sanchez, the wife of one of the men 
still hostage, told Radionet radio. 
</P>
<P>
	After reaching the beach, Sanchez said she grabbed hold of her  
husband's hand and tried to stay with him. But he and his captors 
insisted she remain behind with the other women and children. 
</P>
<P>
	No group has claimed responsibility. But the action appeared to  
be another in a wave of rebel abductions that have increasingly 
exposed ordinary Colombians to the dangers of the country's 35-year 
conflict. 
</P>
<P>
	The expedition was headed for a popular beach when it was forced  
off course, the navy said. After the captors fled with their 
hostages, the captain piloted the ship back to Buenaventura late 
Saturday with the women and children on board. 
</P>
<P>
	According to the navy's report, freed passengers said the  
hostage-takers declared they were punishing the boat's owner for 
refusing to make extortion payments to the country's largest rebel 
band, the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia, or FARC. 
</P>
<P>
	The FARC -- which finances its insurgency through kidnappings,  
extortion and by protecting the drug trade -- is set to begin peace 
talks with the government on Oct. 24. 
</P>
<P>
	A smaller leftist guerrilla group, the National Liberation Army,  
has also kidnapped hundreds of people this year. 
</P>
<P>
	Seeking ransoms and a seat at the peace table, the ELN has  
hijacked a domestic airliner in flight, raided a Catholic Mass and 
intercepted a fishing expedition in the Caribbean.

<HEADLINE> Cavalier's Murray Has Sprained Knee </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CLEVELAND (AP) -- Cleveland Cavaliers forward Lamond Murray will  
be out of action indefinitely with a sprained left knee. 
</P>
<P>
	Murray was injured in the second quarter of Saturday night's  
game as Cleveland played the New York Knicks in Syracuse, N.Y.. A 
medical examination Sunday at the Cleveland Clinic determined he 
had a sprain of the medial collateral ligament in his left knee. 
</P>
<P>
	Murray was fitted with a splint and given medication to reduce  
the pain and swelling. A time for his possible return has not been 
determined. 
</P>
<P>
	Murray played five seasons with the Los Angeles Clippers before  
Cleveland acquired him Aug. 4 in a trade for guard Derek Anderson 
and forward Johnny Newman. Used primarily at small forward, Murray 
averaged 12.2 points after losing his starting job 13 games into 
the season.

<HEADLINE> Clinton For Campaign Finance Reform </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MONTICELLO, N.Y. (AP) -- Senate contender Hillary Rodham Clinton  
told about 600 Democrats at a political fund-raiser Sunday that as 
an almost-candidate she has become an even bigger booster of 
campaign finance reform. 
</P>
<P>
	``Now that I'm leaning so far in becoming a candidate that if I  
leaned any further I'd fall over, I really support campaign finance 
reform,'' said Mrs. Clinton, whose supporters have vowed to raise 
$25 million for her race. 
</P>
<P>
	``In the weeks and months ahead I'm going to have more to say  
about that because I think it is imperative that we all, as 
citizens of our democracy, stand up for change in the way that we 
finance campaigns,'' the first lady said. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Clinton, a frequent campaigner who has not formally  
declared her candidacy, offered no details about what she might 
propose. 
</P>
<P>
	She starred at a $55-a-person Sullivan County Democratic  
Committee's fund-raising dinner at a Catskill Mountains landmark, 
Kutsher's Country Club. It was the second such event she has 
headlined in three days and the third in three weeks in her adopted 
state. 
</P>
<P>
	While Mrs. Clinton has regularly sought to help Democratic  
congressional candidates across New York, in recent weeks she has 
begun lending her fame to local party organizations in preparation 
for next year's Senate race. 
</P>
<P>
	The Clinton camp believes that helping local Democrats,  
particularly outside heavily Democratic New York City, could pay 
dividends for the first lady in a U.S. senate race against the 
probable opponent, New York City Mayor Rudolph Giuliani. The 
suburban counties surrounding New York City and the upstate area, 
where Republicans tend to do well, are expected to be key 
battlegrounds in the Senate race. 
</P>
<P>
	In recent days, Mrs. Clinton has stepped up her campaigning,  
drawing distinctions between herself and Giuliani, without 
mentioning the mayor by name.

<HEADLINE> Jets Bench Mirer for Lucas </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	EAST RUTHERFORD, N.J. (AP) -- Rick Mirer was benched as New York  
Jets quarterback Sunday by coach Bill Parcells, with Ray Lucas 
making his first NFL start. 
</P>
<P>
	Parcells hinted during the week he might make a change at the  
position, which has been in flux since Vinny Testaverde tore his 
Achilles' tendon in the season opener. Mirer, acquired Aug. 20, was 
slow to learn the offense and was coming off a weak performance 
last Monday night against Jacksonville. He was demoted to third 
string, behind punter Tom Tupa, for the game with Indianapolis. 
</P>
<P>
	Lucas, in his third NFL season, generally has played on special  
teams. He received about half of the snaps in practice during the 
week. Lucas has appeared in nine games at quarterback for the Jets, 
but only sporadically. He has not played quarterback this year.

<HEADLINE> Seminoles Remain No. 1 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TALLAHASSEE, Fla. (AP) -- Florida State coach Bobby Bowden is  
still waiting for his top-ranked Seminoles to play a complete game 
on both sides of the ball. 
</P>
<P>
	Florida State looked anything but the country's top-ranked team  
for a half Saturday night before stepping it up in a 33-10 victory 
over Wake Forest. 
</P>
<P>
	``We finally realized we were playing for a national title even  
in this game,'' Florida State senior offensive guard Jason Whitaker 
said. ``It doesn't matter who you lose to. If you lose you're out 
of the picture.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Florida State (7-0, 5-0 Atlantic Coast Conference) extended its  
home unbeaten streak to 45 games, including 28 straight victories. 
The Seminoles, 104-13-1 in the 1990s, have won the most games in a 
decade in NCAA history. 
</P>
<P>
	But Saturday's homecoming victory won't rank among the most  
memorable. 
</P>
<P>
	Bowden was upset about his team's 15 penalties and wondered  
about the intensity of his players. 
</P>
<P>
	``They've played good enough to win and sometimes good ball  
clubs do that,'' Bowden said Sunday. ``It's hard to be intense when 
things are going so well.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Seminole defense and placekicker Sebastian Janikowski  
combined to give Florida State a 9-3 halftime lead over Wake 
Forest. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think they play a little nervous because they are the No. 1  
team in the nation and everyone's taking a shot at them,'' said 
Wake Forest linebacker Dustin Lyman. ``They wore us down. ... And 
that's why they're No. 1.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Chris Weinke threw two third-quarter touchdown passes to former  
walk-on Atrews Bell and Sebastian Janikowski kicked his fourth 
field goal in the game and 17th of the season -- as the Seminoles 
took command. 
</P>
<P>
	``We didn't play great, but we came away with a win,'' said  
Weinke, who threw for a career-high 354 yards. ``We will have to be 
sharper for 60 minutes the rest of the way.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``They had a good plan for us,'' Bowden said. ``And we weren't  
sharp tonight. We'd better be sharp next week or we'll get our 
butts whipped.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Bowden will try to become only the fifth Division I-A coach to  
reach 300 victories next week when the Seminoles travel to Clemson, 
which is coached by his son, Tommy. 
</P>
<P>
	Janikowski kicked field goals from 31, 34, and 52 yards in the  
first half and then added a 32-yarder in the fourth quarter. 
</P>
<P>
	Wake Forest (3-3, 1-3) scored its only touchdown on a 1-yard  
pass from C.J. Leak to Fabian Davis on the final play of the game. 
</P>
<P>
	Wake Forest's Morgan Kane came into the game averaging 134 yards  
rushing a game, but was held to just 28 yards on 12 carries. 
</P>
<P>
	The Seminoles were playing for the second straight game without  
receiver Peter Warrick. He is hoping to have a felony theft charge 
reduced so he can return to the team. And the Seminoles lost senior 
receiver Ron Dugans with a chest contusion in the first half. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm getting a little nervous about these wide receivers,''  
Bowden said.

<HEADLINE> 3 Films Battle for Box Office Title / Box Office  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- ``Double Jeopardy'' won a narrow decision  
over newcomers ``Fight Club'' and ``The Story of Us'' to remain the 
weekend box-office champ with $10.5 million, according to industry 
estimates Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	If the numbers hold once final figures are in Monday, it would  
be ``Double Jeopardy's'' fourth straight weekend as the No. 1 
movie. 
</P>
<P>
	``The Story of Us,'' starring Michelle Pfeiffer and Bruce  
Willis, was second with $10.4 million, and the ultraviolent ``Fight 
Club,'' starring Brad Pitt and Edward Norton, third with $10.3 
million. 
</P>
<P>
	The figures are based on based on box-office receipts studios  
gather from theaters for Friday and Saturday, plus estimates for 
Sunday ticket sales. 
</P>
<P>
	Robert Bucksbaum of box-office tracker Reel Source Inc., which  
does its own projections based on surveys of theater chains, said 
he thinks ``Fight Club'' will come out on top when final numbers 
are reported Monday. ``The Story of Us'' probably will come in 
second and ``Double Jeopardy'' third, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	In ``Fight Club,'' Pitt and Norton lead a band of dissatisfied  
men who gather in bloody male-bonding sessions to pummel one 
another in barefisted brawls. Their violence eventually expands to 
guns and explosives. 
</P>
<P>
	``Double Jeopardy,'' starring Ashley Judd and Tommy Lee Jones,  
tells the story of a woman bent on revenge against her husband, who 
faked his death and framed her for murder. 
</P>
<P>
	Whether No. 1 or not, the film has grossed $80.6 million in 24  
days. 
</P>
<P>
	``'Double Jeopardy' does continue to roll along,'' said Paul  
Dergarabedian, president of Exhibitor Relations, which tracks movie 
ticket sales. ``That genre of a revenge-seeking woman has really 
caught on in a big way.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The ghost story ``The Sixth Sense'' edged near the  
quarter-billion-dollar mark in its 11-week run. ``Sixth Sense'' 
took in $5.2 million to raise its total gross to $249.9 million. 
</P>
<P>
	Estimated ticket sales for Friday through Sunday at North  
American theaters, according to Exhibitor Relations (final figures 
to be released Monday): 
</P>
<P>
	1. ``Double Jeopardy,'' $10.5 million.  
</P>
<P>
	2. ``The Story of Us,'' $10.4 million.  
</P>
<P>
	3. ``Fight Club,'' $10.3 million.  
</P>
<P>
	4. ``Three Kings,'' $7.3 million.

	5. ``American Beauty,'' $6.8 million.

<HEADLINE> Thornfield Wins Canadian Intl. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TORONTO (AP) -- Thornfield, the longest shot in the field and  
owned by Steve Stavro, a part-owner of the Toronto Maple Leafs and 
Toronto Raptors, overtook Courteous in the deep stretch and went on 
to win the $1.56 million Canadian International by a length on 
Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	The British-bred Courteous appeared to have the race well in  
hand, leading by seven lengths a half-mile into the 1 1/2-mile race at 
Woodbine Racetrack. Even turning for home, Courteous seemed in 
control, leading by five lengths. 
</P>
<P>
	But Courteous's blazing pace hurt down the stretch as the  
4-year-old began to wilt, allowing the onrushing Thornfield to make 
up ground. 
</P>
<P>
	Thornfield, a 5-year-old gelding, was timed on a good turf  
course in 2:32 1-5. The victory was worth $936,000. 
</P>
<P>
	Thornfield paid $39.70, $11.80 and $6.60 and became the fifth  
Canadian-bred winner of this event since 1958. Thornfield also 
became the first International winner to be sired by a prior victor 
of this event (Sky Classic in 1991). 
</P>
<P>
	American-bred Fruits of Love, who went off as the 8-5 favorite,  
finished second, paying $4.60 and $3.20. 
</P>
<P>
	Courteous, who was a 15-1 long shot, held on to third and paid  
$7.40. 
</P>
<P>
	The nine-horse field was truly an international one, with  
entries from Canada, the United States, England, Chile, Ireland and 
Brazil. 
</P>
<P>
	The Canadian International was the fourth stop on the inaugural  
Emirates World Series racing championship. The nine-race circuit 
began March 28 with the $5 million Dubai World Cup. 
</P>
<P>
	Each race in the championship carries a purse of at least $1  
million and will be run over either 1 1/4 or 1 1/2 miles. The horse that 
accumulates the most points over the course of the year will earn a 
$1 million bonus. 
</P>
<P>
	Many of the circuit's leading horses skipped the International,  
including Irish-bred Daylami, who tops the overall standings with 
26 points.

	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Wrestlers who go through dietary contortions  
to push their weights down don't have eating disorders, though they

``Disordered eating is a better term, which I think everybody does 
in their life.'' A strict diet that starts on New Year's day could 
count as disordered eating, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Some wrestlers forced down their weights artificially before  
weigh-ins so they can wrestle in lower weight classes against 
potentially smaller and weaker competitors. 
</P>
<P>
	Previous studies used questionnaires to search for eating  
disorders among wrestlers. But questionnaires are only a start in 
differentiating bad diet habits from bulimia, which is a clinically 
diagnosable psychiatric disorder, Landers said. He went the extra 
step of interviewing wrestlers who had high scores on the 
questionnaires. 
</P>
<P>
	The study in the American College of Sports Medicine journal  
Medicine and Science in Sports and Exercise looked at 85 junior 
high and high school wrestlers in the Phoenix area, and 75 
nonwrestlers recruited from physical education classes in the same 
schools. Wrestlers took the questionnaire during and after the 
wrestling season; nonwrestlers took it once. 
</P>
<P>
	On the first test, 27 percent of wrestlers tested high in one of  
the categories, termed Drive for Thinness, which Landers described 
as an overwhelming fear of being overweight. In comparison, only 15 
percent tested high in the off-season. That's statistically 
different from the results during the season, but not different 
from the 13 percent of nonwrestlers who also tested high. 
</P>
<P>
	There were no significant differences among the students in two  
other categories -- Bulimia, which looked for behaviors such as 
self-induced vomiting, and Body Dissatisfaction, which was 
unhappiness with the overall shape of their bodies, Landers said. 
</P>
<P>
	Overall, 36 percent of wrestlers during the season reached the  
test's ``at risk'' threshold, while only 19 percent were considered 
at risk of bulimia after the season; 29 percent of nonwrestlers 
were rated at risk. The difference between wrestlers' scores during 
and after the season was significant. 
</P>
<P>
	Those findings are less worrisome than they seem -- the  
questionnaire is only a screening tool, and should be followed with 
interviews to see if a diagnosis could be made, Landers said. When 
that was done, ``we didn't find any who met the criteria for 
bulimic behavior,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	The wrestlers ``had a fear of being fat, but you find out the  
reason for the fear is they are not going to be able to wrestle, 
not because they have an overwhelming fear they look terrible,'' 
Landers said. 
</P>
<P>
	One giveaway for the wrestlers was that they didn't worry about  
their weight in the off-season, Landers said. ``Once that 
performance is over, they start eating. They like to eat. They have 
no aversion to eating,'' Landers said ``In fact, they don't like 
being skinny -- which is very different from people who have this 
disordered body image and who, even when they are skinny, think 
they want to be more skinny.'' 
</P>
<P>
	This fits the experience of Dennis Gurecki, who coaches at  
Channel High School in the Phoenix area and is state chairman of 
Arizona USA Wrestling, an amateurs governing body. ``There's always 
a few that will cut (weight) pretty hard, and the ones that do I 
guarantee they will right back up to their weight and past that,'' 
he said. ``They are eating machines. I have never seen one that has 
done the opposite in my 25 years of coaching.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The results suggest that wrestling officials who want athletes  
to avoid risky weight-loss methods should concentrate on changing 
the rules, not looking into the athletes' minds, Landers said. 
</P>
<P>
	Rule changes have been made, especially because some behaviors --  
dehydration is one -- have resulted in the deaths of wrestlers. 
</P>
<P>
	Schools affiliated with the National Federation of State High  
School Associations are requiring weigh-ins no more than one hour 
before the meet, effective this season, said Fritz McGuinness, 
editor of the wrestling rulebook. 
</P>
<P>
	Similar rules are in place at the college level, said Randy  
Dick, assistant director for health and safety at the National 
Collegiate Athletic Association.''Our concern was really the whole 
emphasis on making weight in the sport and the bouncing around,'' 
Dick said. ``We hope the rules changes have eliminated that -- or 
reduced it significantly.''

<HEADLINE> Shannon Faulkner Teaching English </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	GREENVILLE, S.C. (AP) -- Shannon Faulkner was berated and ignored  
in her days at The Citadel. Now she has the undivided attention of 
her students at Carolina High School. 
</P>
<P>
	It's been a long road for the first-year English teacher, whose  
court battle with The Citadel forced the South Carolina military 
school to drop its all-male admissions policy in 1996. 
</P>
<P>
	Faulkner spent her only five days as a member of the Corps of  
Cadets at The Citadel in virtual solitude. When she dropped out, 
she was emotionally drained, the 24-year-old said in a recent 
interview with The Greenville News. 
</P>
<P>
	It wasn't until enrolling at Anderson College several months  
later that Faulkner found a home, she told the newspaper for a 
story published Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	``I started getting Shannon back,'' she said. ``It took awhile  
for me to be able to do whatever I wanted, to smile, be upbeat and 
happy.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Faulkner, who graduated with a degree in education in August,  
was hired at Carolina High School days later. 
</P>
<P>
	Faulkner said she has no regrets about her decision to enroll at  
The Citadel. 
</P>
<P>
	``I went into it knowing I may not get anything out of it. I was  
doing it for the next woman,'' she said.

<HEADLINE> Ohio Mayor Race Offers Many Firsts </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	COLUMBUS, Ohio (AP) -- Next month's mayoral race is drawing  
unusual attention -- and not just because it will give the nation's 
15th-largest city its first black or first female mayor. 
</P>
<P>
	The fact that there's a real race at all is news in Columbus, a  
city where Republicans have held the office since 1971. 
</P>
<P>
	If Democrat Michael Coleman wins the Nov. 2 election, his party  
could control the government of a capital city where Republicans 
hold all statewide nonjudicial offices. Democrats already have six 
of seven seats on the City Council and are likely to keep a 
majority with four seats up for election. 
</P>
<P>
	Coleman, 44, the City Council president, and Republican Dorothy  
Teater, 68, a Franklin County commissioner, emerged as the top two 
finishers in the May 5 nonpartisan primary. 
</P>
<P>
	Registered Democrats outnumber Republicans in Columbus, but  
thanks to a large number of independent voters, the Democrats have 
come close only once in the past 16 years to winning the mayor's 
office. 
</P>
<P>
	Coleman, however, is given a good shot. A mail poll conducted by  
The Columbus Dispatch from Sept. 24-Oct. 1 found that 47 percent of 
the respondents favored Coleman and 40 percent supported Teater, 
with 13 percent undecided. The random sample of 2,649 registered 
city voters had a margin of sampling error of plus or minus 2 
percentage points. 
</P>
<P>
	The closeness of the race, and a general lack of high-profile  
races in Ohio and across the nation, led the state and national 
political parties to make the campaign a priority. 
</P>
<P>
	Republican National Committee Chairman Jim Nicholson appeared at  
a fund-raiser for Teater in September, while Democratic National 
Chairman Joe Andrew has been in town twice for Coleman. 
</P>
<P>
	Each candidate expects to spend at least $1 million, the bulk of  
it for advertising down the stretch. 
</P>
<P>
	Teater's television advertising has been typical of candidates  
playing catch-up late in the race: Focus on the opponent and make 
it negative. 
</P>
<P>
	The first ad criticized Coleman for voting to give pay raises to  
Police Chief James Jackson, who has been criticized and suspended 
by Mayor Greg Lashutka, but has civil service protection. 
</P>
<P>
	Under Jackson, too many officers are behind desks and not on the  
streets, and the community is fed up with slow response times to 
crimes, Teater said. Coleman isn't crazy about Jackson either, but 
he said the mayor has no choice but to coexist with the chief. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's very important to keep politics out of the Division of  
Police,'' Coleman said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	One of the few other issues sharply dividing the candidates is a  
plan to use property tax generated by a planned suburban mall to 
finance road work and other improvements for that area. Teater 
supports a ballot issue to repeal what she considers a tax break 
for a wealthy developer that would devastate an older mall closer 
to the center of Columbus. Coleman says the city must keep its 
promise on the tax deal. 
</P>
<P>
	But Teater said it may not be the issues themselves that the  
city's 670,000 residents will remember most about the campaign 
</P>
<P>
	``The big thing is the diversity issue, a black man against a  
white woman. There's never been a woman run before,'' Teater said 
Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	Before they got into politics, Coleman was a lawyer and Teater  
was a teacher in high school, college and adult education. She 
worked in consumer affairs for a bank and the city, and did not run 
for office until her four sons were grown.

<HEADLINE> Incumbant Winning Catalan Elections </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BARCELONA, Spain (AP) -- The nationalist party maintained its  
grip on power in Sunday's regional parliamentary elections in 
prosperous northeastern Catalonia, but its rival Socialists still 
scored major gains, preliminary results indicated. 
</P>
<P>
	Catalan President Jordi Pujol, the 69-year-old leader of the  
Convergence and Union Party who has held office for 19 years, 
claimed victory at a a Barcelona hotel as hundreds of supporters 
cheered wildly, ``President, President!'' 
</P>
<P>
	``We have won a sixth time, not the Socialists, so we will  
govern Catalonia,'' Pujol shouted back. 
</P>
<P>
	With 96.7 percent of the vote counted, Pujol's party had won 56  
seats in the 135-seat Parliament, compared with 52 seats for the 
Socialists and 12 for the Popular Party of Spanish Prime Minister 
Jose Maria Aznar. Esquerra Republicana, which advocates Catalan 
independence, won 12 seats, and the Green Party won three. 
</P>
<P>
	The win would mean a sixth consecutive term for Pujol, a  
national power broker. Pujol had faced his toughest challenger in 
years in the leader of the Socialists -- the popular former 
Barcelona Mayor Pascual Maragall. 
</P>
<P>
	The results showed Pujol's party short of a majority 68 seats  
and indicated major gains for the Socialists, who held only 34 
seats in Parliament going into the elections. 
</P>
<P>
	``We think that a new stage is opened in the parliamentary and  
political history of Catalonia'', said Joaquim Nadal, who was 
second in the Socialist's list of candidates for the presidency. 
</P>
<P>
	Police reported scattered incidents of violence overnight.  
Assailants hurled gasoline bombs at automatic cash machines, a 
police van and a political party office in Granollers, Barcelona, 
and Barbera del Valles. Police blamed the attacks on young 
independence advocates. Damage was described as moderate. 
</P>
<P>
	Catalonia, with its capital in Barcelona, is Spain's most  
prosperous region with 6.1 million people and a thriving economy. 
</P>
<P>
	For many Spaniards, Pujol, 69, personifies Catalan nationalism.  
He promotes himself as the guardian of the Catalan language and 
culture and during his 19 years in office has gained greater 
administrative powers for the region. 
</P>
<P>
	He earned a reputation for defending Catalonia during Gen.  
Francisco Franco's four-decade dictatorship. 
</P>
<P>
	Regardless of the election's outcome, Maragall, is the first  
candidate to come within striking distance of Pujol. Maragall was 
highly praised for attracting the Summer Olympics to the city in 
1992. 
</P>
<P>
	Turnout was 46.36 percent among the region's 5.3 million voters  
two hours before the polling booth closed, the lowest of the 
region's sixth election since democracy was restored in 1978.

<HEADLINE> Mets Bullpen Comes Through </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Reliever after reliever came out of the New York  
Mets' bullpen to keep their season alive for at least another day. 
</P>
<P>
	It almost wasn't enough.  
</P>
<P>
	After 11 scoreless innings of relief, the Braves broke through  
against Octavio Dotel in the 15th inning Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	Just when it looked like New York's season would end three games  
short of a possible Subway Series, the Mets broke through in the 
bottom of the 15th to win 4-3 in the longest postseason game in 13 
years. 
</P>
<P>
	While Robin Ventura provided the game-winning hit with the bases  
loaded, it was the Mets' bullpen that deserved much of the credit 
for making it possible. 
</P>
<P>
	Trailing Atlanta 3-1 in the best-of-7 series, Bobby Valentine  
managed the game as if it were the Mets' last -- which it almost 
was. 
</P>
<P>
	Valentine set a postseason record by using nine pitchers --  
including four in a four-batter span in the seventh inning -- after 
starter Masato Yoshii was knocked out with no outs in the fourth 
inning. 
</P>
<P>
	That maneuvering left Valentine with just Dotel in the bullpen  
after Game 2 starter Kenny Rogers pitched the 11th and 12th 
innings. 
</P>
<P>
	Dotel shut down the Braves for his first two innings, escaping  
in the 13th when Lockhart was gunned down at the plate trying to 
score from first on Chipper Jones' double to right. 
</P>
<P>
	Had Ventura not broken the 3-3 tie, Game 4 starter Rick Reed  
would have pitched the 16th. 
</P>
<P>
	That Valentine and the Mets relied so heavily on the bullpen  
should come as no surprise, as it was one of the strengths of the 
team all year. 
</P>
<P>
	The Mets took an NL-record 119 games to throw their first  
complete game, but with one of the best bullpens in the league, New 
York remained in contention. Mets relievers went 31-19 with a 3.67 
ERA on the year. 
</P>
<P>
	But they didn't pitch any more important innings than they did  
Sunday. After Yoshii gave away a 2-0 lead in the fourth inning, 
Orel Hershiser came in and got out of a first-and-second, no-out 
jam. 
</P>
<P>
	In his second relief appearance this decade, Hershiser struck  
out Andruw Jones and Eddie Perez before getting Walt Weiss to 
ground out. 
</P>
<P>
	Mets relievers would pitch in and out of trouble until  
Lockhart's hit in the 15th. The Braves stranded a playoff-record 19 
runners -- 18 against the bullpen -- and were 1-for-13 with runners 
in scoring position after Yoshii left. 
</P>
<P>
	Hershiser struck out Brian Jordan to end the fifth with two men  
on, before facing real trouble in the sixth. He loaded the bases 
with one out on an error by first baseman John Olerud and two 
walks. 
</P>
<P>
	With Greg Maddux at the plate, Braves manager Bobby Cox called  
for a squeeze bunt on a 1-2 count. Maddux bunted through the pitch 
and Ryan Klesko was caught in a rundown to end the inning. 
</P>
<P>
	Hershiser left after hitting Bret Boone with one out in the  
seventh. That's when Valentine really put his relievers to work, 
using four in a four-batter span. 
</P>
<P>
	Turk Wendell struck out Chipper Jones on three pitches, with  
pinch-runner Otis Nixon stealing second on the last pitch. After 
Wendell fell behind Jordan 2-0, Valentine brought in Dennis Cook to 
complete the intentional walk. 
</P>
<P>
	By bringing in the left-hander then, Valentine could take Cook  
out as soon as Bobby Cox pinch hit for the lefty-swinging Klesko. 
Pat Mahomes came on and walked pinch-hitter Brian Hunter before 
getting Andruw Jones to fly out to left. 
</P>
<P>
	John Franco came on with two on and two outs in the eighth and  
got Lockhart to ground out. Franco pitched a scoreless ninth and 
Armando Benitez pitched the 10th.

<HEADLINE> Mets 4, Braves 3, 15 innings </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- There was confusion over the score, but one  
thing was certain after one of the wackiest -- and greatest -- games 
in playoff history: The New York Mets are still alive in the NL 
championship series. 
</P>
<P>
	Robin Ventura's grand slam-single drove home the winning run in  
the 15th inning and gave the Mets an improbable 4-3 victory over 
the Atlanta Braves in Game 5, capping baseball's longest postseason 
contest. 
</P>
<P>
	``If we come back and win this series, this will go down as one  
of the great games in history,'' Orel Hershiser said after the 
5-hour, 46-minute epic. ``One of the ones they show on the sports 
classic channel and cut out some of the dry parts, although there 
will be hardly any.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The 482-pitch game ended in confusion, with two runners crossing  
the plate while Ventura was mobbed by his teammates before he could 
get to second base. Workers pulled up the bases, the umpires left 
the field and no one knew the score: 4-3, 5-3 or 7-3. 
</P>
<P>
	``I never saw it go out. Did it?'' Mets manager Bobby Valentine  
said as reporters told him of the confusion over the final score. 
``Then it's a grand slam. But he never touched the bases? I'll be 
doggone!'' 
</P>
<P>
	About 10 minutes after the game ended, official scorer Red Foley  
announced that Ventura was credited with a run-scoring single and 
the final was 4-3. But the umpires insisted the score was 5-3, 
counting both runners who came home before the celebration. 
Finally, the NL ruled it 4-3, saying Foley and the Elias Sports 
Bureau were responsible for the final decision. 
</P>
<P>
	``The game ends in sudden death when the winning run scores,''  
Elias spokesman Steve Hirdt said. ``The only exception is on a home 
run, assuming the player rounds all the bases. He never rounded the 
bases.'' 
</P>
<P>
	It didn't matter. The Mets forced a Game 6 in Atlanta on Tuesday  
night. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm just glad we're actually going back after getting down  
3-0,'' Ventura said. 
</P>
<P>
	The Braves still lead the best-of-7 series 3-2, but this was  
another devastating blow after losing the previous night 3-2 on 
John Olerud's two-out, two-run single in the eighth inning. 
</P>
<P>
	Atlanta was three outs away from reaching the World Series for  
the first time since 1996 after Keith Lockhart's two-out, 
run-scoring triple in the top of the 15th broke a 2-2 tie -- the 
first run scored in the game since the third. 
</P>
<P>
	But the Mets, who had to win their final four games of the  
regular season just to make the playoffs, would not die. 
</P>
<P>
	After fouling off pitch after pitch, Shawon Dunston led off the  
home half of the 15th with a single to center against 22-year-old 
rookie Kevin McGlinchy, who then walked pinch-hitter Matt Franco. 
</P>
<P>
	Edgardo Alfonzo bunted the runners to second and third before  
McGlinchy walked Olerud intentionally to load the bases. Todd 
Pratt, who entered the game in the 14th after Mike Piazza suffered 
a strained right forearm, walked on five pitches to force in the 
tying run. 
</P>
<P>
	With the Shea Stadium crowd drowning out the sound of jets  
taking off from nearby LaGuardia airport, Ventura, who was 1-for-18 
in the series, drove a 1-1 pitch over the right-field wall for an 
apparent grand slam. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's very discouraging,'' said McGlinchy, making his first  
appearance of the series. ``It's one of those things you have to 
forget. Baseball is a crazy game, this was a crazy game.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Braves manager Bobby Cox, who has used three of his starters out  
of the bullpen during the postseason, chose not to call on Game 6 
starter Kevin Millwood for the potential save. Cox was concerned 
about the muddy conditions on the mound as the game was played in a 
steady rain from the sixth inning on. 
</P>
<P>
	``(McGlinchey) is a big leaguer,'' Cox said. ``He should be able  
to throw strikes and get them out. We thought he would.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ventura didn't get a chance to circle the bases, but it didn't  
matter. One run was all the Mets needed to cap an incredible day 
and keep their season alive. 
</P>
<P>
	``I was just looking for something in the middle of the plate I  
could get in the air,'' Ventura said. ``Everybody had all the tough 
at-bats before me, mine I was just trying to put the barrel on it. 
As long as I got to first base, I don't care. It was a great game 
to be involved in.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Mets swept the Pirates on the final weekend to force a  
wild-card playoff with Cincinnati, winning that game 5-0 to earn 
New York's first postseason berth since 1988. 
</P>
<P>
	After putting themselves in an 0-3 hole against the Braves, they  
need another four-game streak to advance to the World Series. 
</P>
<P>
	New York is halfway there, though the series now shifts back to  
Atlanta. Game 7, which seemed improbable just a couple of days ago, 
would be Wednesday night if needed. 
</P>
<P>
	The Mets become only the second team in baseball history to win  
as many as two games after dropping the first three in a postseason 
series. The Braves did it last year before losing Game 6 to the 
Padres in the NLCS. 
</P>
<P>
	The most important game of the season ended with a pair of  
rookies on the mound: McGlinchy and 23-year-old Octavio Dotel for 
the Mets. 
</P>
<P>
	The New York bullpen pitched 10 shutout innings before Atlanta  
broke through against Dotel in the 15th. Walt Weiss led off with a 
single, stole second while McGlinchy was striking out and came home 
when Lockhart hit a drive to deep right-center, falling just out of 
the reach of Dunston. 
</P>
<P>
	Atlanta set a postseason mark by leaving 19 runners on base,  
putting at least one runner on base from the third inning on. They 
were 3-for-18 with runners in scoring position. 
</P>
<P>
	The Mets used a postseason-record nine pitchers, including Game  
2 starter Kenny Rogers. Rick Reed, who started the previous day, 
was warming up to pitch the 16th, but he wasn't needed. 
</P>
<P>
	The last four games in what is becoming a classic series have  
been decided by one run. Atlanta won the first game 4-2. 
</P>
<P>
	It was the longest LCS game by innings since the Mets needed 16  
to beat Houston in the deciding game of the 1988 NL series. It was 
the longest postseason game by time ever, surpassing the 5-hour, 
13-minute marathon between the New York Yankees and Seattle 
Mariners in Game 2 of a 1995 division series. 
</P>
<P>
	Despite the rain, more than half of the sellout crowd of 55,723  
stayed around to the end and were rewarded with a chance to do a 
``14th Inning Stretch.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Our crowd was great tonight,'' Ventura said. ``They're partly  
responsible for this.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Braves, after falling behind 2-0 in the first with Game 1  
winner Greg Maddux on the mound, put up 13 consecutive zeros on the 
scoreboard. Benny Agbayani walked and stole second in the 14th, 
making him the first Mets player to get that far since the sixth. 
But Rey Ordonez grounded out to second to end the inning. 
</P>
<P>
	Mets nemesis John Rocker made his fifth straight appearance,  
pitching 1 1-3 scoreless innings, striking out two and keeping up 
his war of words with the Shea Stadium faithful each time he walked 
back to the dugout. 
</P>
<P>
	The Braves gambled for a victory in the top of the 13th when  
Chipper Jones doubled into the right-field corner on a hit-and-run 
with Lockhart breaking from first. 
</P>
<P>
	It didn't pay off. Melvin Mora retrieved the ball in the  
right-field corner, threw to second baseman Alfonzo, who wheeled 
and made a perfect one-hop throw home to Piazza. 
</P>
<P>
	Lockhart, who was still at least 10 feet from home, tried to run  
over the Mets catcher but couldn't knock the ball away. 
</P>
<P>
	Piazza suffered a strained right forearm on the play, though he  
batted in the bottom of the 13th. After striking out to end the 
inning, he was replaced by Pratt. 
</P>
<P>
	Olerud, the hero of Game 4, came through again in the first  
inning against Maddux, driving a two-run homer over the right-field 
fence. Olerud also homered the previous night and drove in all 
three runs in New York's victory. 
</P>
<P>
	Masato Yoshii, making his second start of the series, struck out  
the first two hitters and breezed through the first three innings, 
allowing only one baserunner. 
</P>
<P>
	But he couldn't get an out in the fourth. Bret Boone and Chipper  
Jones led off with back-to-back doubles, cutting New York's lead to 
2-1. Brian Jordan followed with a single to left, bringing home 
Jones with the tying run. After Yoshii walked Klesko, the Mets 
called on Orel Hershiser, who escaped the jam and went on to pitch 
3 1-3 scoreless innings. 
</P>
<P>
	Maddux bounced back from Olerud's homer to pitch seven strong  
innings, allowing seven hits, striking out five and walking no one. 
He was bombed in his last New York appearance, giving up eight 
straight hits without getting an out in the fourth inning -- 
including a grand slam by Olerud. 
</P>
<P>
 *Notes:* Mora started in right field in place of Roger Cedeno, who  
was bothered by a sore back. ... Hershiser made only his second 
relief appearance since 1989, the first coming in the division 
series against Arizona. ... Rickey Henderson, who showered and left 
the clubhouse just minutes after Game 3, angering at least one 
teammate, started in left. ... The Mets returned to their normal 
lineup, batting Alfonzo second, Olerud third, Piazza fourth and 
Ventura fifth. ... Maddux, making his seventh appearance in the 
NLCS, has never won two games in a series. ... Rocker has pitched 
in 11 straight LCS games -- all six against San Diego in 1998 and 
all five this year.

<HEADLINE> What's Next for Wall Street? </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Stocks swooned last week under an unusual  
barrage of bad news. Market watchers are divided on whether stocks 
can rebound in the week to come, as expectations of good news about 
corporate profits and potentially bad news about inflation battle 
for investors' attention. 
</P>
<P>
	Last week, bad news won out, driving the Dow Jones industrial  
average down 630.05 points, or 5.9 percent, to close at 10,019.71. 
It was the Dow's worst week ever in terms of points lost, and the 
worst of the decade in terms of percentages. 
</P>
<P>
	Market analysts aren't sure whether the decline has laid ground  
for a further selloff, or opened the door to bargain-hunting 
investors who could once again propel stocks higher. 
</P>
<P>
	``We may have reached an oversold condition that will bring  
buyers back in,'' said Eugene E. Peroni, director of equity 
research at John Nuveen &AMP; Co. ``And that could set the stage for a 
better and more sustainable move later on.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Other analysts say stocks could be in for another rough week as  
last week's main menace -- the fear that signs of inflation will 
prompt the Federal Reserve to raise interest rates for the third 
time this year -- remains unresolved. 
</P>
<P>
	The Fed left rates unchanged at its last meeting, but hinted  
that it would boost rates if inflation appears to be escalating. 
That set a stage for fitful trading as investors watch carefully 
for any nascent signs of price pressures, analysts said. 
</P>
<P>
	That proved true on Friday, when a sharper-than-expected  
increase in the Producer Price Index sparked selling on Wall 
Street. 
</P>
<P>
	``The market can handle higher rates, but it cannot handle  
uncertainty,'' said Peter Canelo, U.S. investment strategist at 
Morgan Stanley Dean Witter. ``By failing to raise rates, the Fed 
opted to extend this torture for another month,'' until its 
policy-making group holds its next meeting Nov. 16. 
</P>
<P>
	The next major barometer of inflation will be the Consumer Price  
Index, due out from the Labor Department on Tuesday. If it shows 
that prices are on the rise, stocks could be in for another fall, 
analysts said. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, most market watchers continue to hope buyers will step  
back in if the next round of corporate profit reports is as strong 
as expected. Companies are expected to benefit from robust economic 
growth. Earnings should look especially good in comparison to the 
third quarter of 1998, when most businesses struggled with the 
fallout from Asia's financial crisis. 
</P>
<P>
	Last week, strong reports from companies like Apple and Boeing  
were outweighed by disappointments from Intel and Raytheon. In the 
coming week, industry leaders like Citigroup, Ford, Microsoft and 
IBM will compete for investors' attention as they divulge their 
earnings results. 
</P>
<P>
	Of course, strong earnings may not be enough to lift investors'  
spirits if the market's decline has eroded the optimism that has 
characterized the stock market for nearly 10 years, analysts said. 
</P>
<P>
	``Throughout this bull market, people have proven willing to buy  
on the market's dips,'' said Michael Metz, portfolio manager at 
CIBC Oppenheimer. ``If people become less willing to do that, it 
would be troubling.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Noting that some of the market's worst performances in history  
have come on the Monday following a Friday selloff, some analysts 
suggested that investors may have used the weekend to solidify 
their plans to get out of the market. 
</P>
<P>
	``While stocks may experience a short-lived bounce to start on  
Monday, investors will likely be overtaken by fears that compounded 
over the weekend,'' said Brian G. Belski, chief investment 
strategist at George K. Baum &AMP; Co. in Kansas City, Mo. 
</P>
<P>
	But by the same token, stocks may also benefit if investors  
return from the weekend with a sense of calm about the market's 
fundamental strength, analysts said. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's some cynicism and skittishness out there, but we have  
not sensed panic in the streets,'' said Jim Weiss, deputy chief 
investment officer for equities at State Street Research and 
Management Co. in Boston. ``I expect to see some buying on a 
selective basis.''

<HEADLINE> 47 Injured on Hong Kong-Bound Jet </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HONG KONG (AP) -- A China Southern Airlines jet ran into strong  
turbulence and plunged 2,000 feet shortly before it landed in Hong 
Kong on Sunday, injuring 47 passengers. 
</P>
<P>
	Seven of the injured were hospitalized in serious condition,  
including one American and one Japanese, said Dr. N. K. Leung, 
chief executive of the government-run Princess Margaret Hospital. 
Their names were not released. Leung said two other Japanese were 
in stable condition. 
</P>
<P>
	The plane fell from 21,000 feet to 19,000 feet in about five to  
10 seconds, said Wang Guixiang, president and director of China's 
National Civil Aviation Corporation. 
</P>
<P>
	Some passengers said they saw others fly from their seats and  
hit the cabin's roof. 
</P>
<P>
	``It happened very suddenly and everything was very chaotic,''  
said Yau May Kam, a Taiwanese passenger whose 5-year-old daughter 
was slightly injured. ``The plane just dropped and I saw things 
flying all over.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ambulances rushed the injured to three hospitals after the  
Boeing 757, with 160 passengers aboard, arrived at Chek Lap Kok 
airport from the southern Chinese city of Kunming, authorities 
said. About 10 people had to be carried off the plane on 
stretchers. 
</P>
<P>
	City civil aviation officials said the pilot didn't tell air  
traffic controllers of the air turbulence, and instead told his own 
airline -- but said only six people were hurt. 
</P>
<P>
	Wang said the pilot was too busy trying to land the plane.  
</P>
<P>
	Southern Airlines officials were not immediately available for  
comment. 
</P>
<P>
	In August, three people were killed when an MD-11 jet belonging  
to Taiwan's China Airlines crashed while landing in a storm at the 
airport.

<HEADLINE> Ray Wins IRL Race, Season Title </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	FORT WORTH, Texas (AP) -- Greg Ray, the local driver who went  
from unknown to favorite over the last two years, captured his 
first Indy Racing League championship Sunday by finishing third in 
the season finale. 
</P>
<P>
	Ray, who lives about an hour away in Plano, was locked in a  
tight duel for first on the track and in the points race with 
defending champ Kenny Brack until tire problems wiped out the Swede 
with 22 laps left. 
</P>
<P>
	Ray was easily in the lead then, but he pitted for fuel and new  
tires. It cost him a chance to win the race because shortly after 
he returned, Robby Unser wiped out, forcing 11 of the last 13 laps 
to be run under caution. 
</P>
<P>
	Mark Dismore, who started on the front row alongside polesitter  
Ray, ended up winning his first IRL event with Davey Hamilton 
second. The sixth-place finish by Scott Harrington gave him the 
rookie of the year title and a $50,000 bonus. 
</P>
<P>
	The points championship was worth a $500,000 bonus for both Ray  
and team owner John Menard. Ray joined Menard's team last October 
in hopes that his deep pockets would take the driver farther than 
his low-budget team could. 
</P>
<P>
	Ray finished 21st in the season's first three races, then turned  
things around with a second-place finish in Texas in June. He won 
three of the next five events before returning to his home track 
for the capper. 
</P>
<P>
	Although Ray insists he's not the superstitious type, his  
results improved once he started carrying in his pocket and taped 
to his leg some good-luck charms given to him by his oldest son. 
</P>
<P>
	Ray, who finished 21st and 23rd in the two races he forget the  
trinkets, won't divulge all of them, but he's said they include 
some Pokemon trading cards and a black-and-white portrait photo of 
his sons, 6-year-old Winston and 1-year-old Simon, with a penny 
taped to the back. 
</P>
<P>
	The 33-year-old Ray celebrated the season championship by doing  
donuts at each end of the frontstretch. It was his way of thanking 
the home crowd, which was smaller than 50,000 because of rain that 
delayed the start of the race by nearly four hours. 
</P>
<P>
	Dropping temperatures forced precautions to be taken to keep  
tires warm. Although there were several incidents, none seemed to 
be because of the weather. 
</P>
<P>
	The first big crash took out Scott Goodyear while he was in the  
lead. On the restart, Scott Sharp knocked out Sam Schmidt, who came 
into the race third in the points standings. 
</P>
<P>
	Schmidt broke his left foot and fractured a toe on his right  
foot. Goodyear reinjured the left leg he broke in the previous 
race. The two shared a helicopter ride to a Dallas hospital. 
</P>
<P>
	None of Sunday's collisions were as bad as the Saturday incident  
on pit road when rookie Niclas Jonsson lost control of his car and 
injured 12 people, including nine members of Tyce Carlson's crew. 
</P>
<P>
	Using borrowed crew members, Carlson finished 13th. Jonsson was  
unable to compete. 
</P>
<P>
	Sarah Fisher's first race ended in disappointment when a broken  
timing chain knocked out the 19-year-old after 99 laps. The 
youngest driver in IRL history and only the second female plans to 
join the circuit full-time next season. 
</P>
<P>
	``I am a little upset now, but I really like the people that I'm  
around and I'm looking forward to racing next year,'' she said.

<HEADLINE> Alabama Tide Rises Back Into Top 10 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	OXFORD, Miss. (AP) -- A month ago, Alabama had fallen out of the  
Top 25, its athletics director had resigned and coach Mike DuBose 
was on the hot seat for problems on and off the field. 
</P>
<P>
	The Tide has since climbed all the way back to No. 10 in the new  
Associated Press poll released Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	Since a last-minute loss to Louisiana Tech and the turbulent  
week that followed, Alabama has won three straight games. The 
Crimson Tide is back among the nation's elite teams and leads the 
Southeastern Conference West Division. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't know if we are the front-runners (to win the SEC  
West), but we are in an advantageous position,'' DuBose said after 
the Crimson Tide won 30-24 at 25th-ranked Mississippi on Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
	Alabama (5-1, 4-0 SEC), up a spot in the poll since last week,  
is certainly in a much better position that it was after the 
Louisiana Tech game. 
</P>
<P>
	In the week after that Sept. 18 game, athletics director Bob  
Bockrath resigned. That left a cloud over coach DuBose, who had 
admitted he lied earlier in the year about an alleged affair with a 
department employee. 
</P>
<P>
	The focus has since shifted back to Alabama winning football  
games. 
</P>
<P>
	The Crimson Tide beat Arkansas a week later and then took  
advantage of a second-chance extra point in overtime to break 
Florida's 30-game home winning streak. After an open date, Alabama 
held off Ole Miss (5-2, 2-2). 
</P>
<P>
	``This was a huge win. I was concerned about coming off the  
Florida win and the week off,'' DuBose said. 
</P>
<P>
	Against an Ole Miss defense that had allowed just 45 yards per  
game and four rushing touchdowns all season, Shaun Alexander rushed 
for 214 yards and three scores. 
</P>
<P>
	Not only did he help Alabama win, but Alexander added to his  
ever-growing list of credentials as a leading Heisman Trophy 
candidate. 
</P>
<P>
	With previous Heisman front-runner Peter Warrick sidelined at  
Florida State because of off-the-field problems, the race for 
college football's top individual prize is wide open. 
</P>
<P>
	Alexander has rushed for at least 100 yards in every game this  
season, and in five games has scored at least three times. 
</P>
<P>
	Alexander increased his career rushing total to 3,116 yards,  
becoming the second Alabama running back and 17th in the SEC to 
surpass 3,000 yards. He also became the Tide's career touchdown 
leader with 43, including 16 this season (13 rushing, three 
receiving). 
</P>
<P>
	Alexander had two 1-yard TD runs in the first half, the second  
capping a 99-yard drive, and added a 2-yard score on Alabama's 
opening possession of the second half. 
</P>
<P>
	Freddie Milons had nine receptions for 133 yards, including  
three for 49 on Alabama's 99-yard touchdown drive. It was his third 
straight 100-yard receiving game, a first in Tide history. 
</P>
<P>
	Ole Miss trimmed a 20-point deficit with 17 straight points in  
the second half, but couldn't get closer and fell to Alabama for 
the ninth straight year. 
</P>
<P>
	Alabama, which hosts fifth-ranked Tennessee next weekend, has a  
half-game lead in the SEC West over 12th-ranked and defending champ 
Mississippi State (6-0, 3-0).

<HEADLINE> Hokies Prove They're No Fluke </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BLACKSBURG, Va. (AP) -- Who could blame the Hokies for bragging  
about this one? 
</P>
<P>
	In a setting where it has failed before, No. 4 Virginia Tech  
produced the biggest shutout ever of a team ranked in The 
Associated Press poll. 
</P>
<P>
	The 62-0 victory over Syracuse on Saturday may have provided  
irrefutable proof that the Hokies indeed belong in the national 
championship chase. 
</P>
<P>
	``We played with a lot of emotion in a big ball game against a  
good team,'' coach Frank Beamer said. ``We have the ability right 
now to get you in every way. I don't think we have a weakness.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Hokies (6-0, 2-0 Big East) entered the game simply hoping  
they wouldn't blow it. They had started homecoming day unbeaten 
each of the last two years and were hit with big upsets both times. 
There was also the memory of a last-minute loss at Syracuse last 
year. 
</P>
<P>
	Well, they sure didn't blow it. Instead, it was a blowout  
against a team that came into the game ranked No. 16. 
</P>
<P>
	``I was surprised,'' receiver Ricky Hall said. ``I hope it will  
erase all of the doubters, but that's not going to happen. You're 
still going to have doubters out there.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In the 63-year history of the AP poll, the previous record for  
biggest shutout of a ranked team was No. 1 Army's 61-0 victory over 
No. 6 Penn State in 1945. The largest losing margin for a ranked 
team is 63 points -- by No. 11 Texas in a 66-3 rout by UCLA two 
years ago. 
</P>
<P>
	Virginia Tech's defense led the way, scoring two touchdowns and  
allowing just three first downs before the backups came in at the 
start of the fourth quarter. The Orangemen gained 120 total yards, 
and the Hokies are now allowing an average of just 8 points per 
game. 
</P>
<P>
	``They're playing great defense,'' Syracuse coach Paul  
Pasqualoni said. ``We made a play or two, but we were not able to 
consistently put plays together.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But as much as the Hokies deserve credit for the lopsided  
victory, the Orangemen (5-2, 2-1) can blame themselves for the 
final, humiliating margin of defeat. Syracuse played ugly football 
in the second half, missing tackles, fumbling snaps and looking 
like a beaten team that just didn't care. 
</P>
<P>
	Pasqualoni was embarrassed. The loss was Syracuse's worst in 77  
years, and the Orangemen have been outscored 169-34 in their last 
four games at Lane Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
	``Things really got out of whack,'' Pasqualoni said. ``Life is  
90 percent how you react and 10 percent what happens. We have a lot 
of football to play. The No. 1 thing right now is the kids have to 
stay together.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The score matched a 62-0 loss by the Orangemen at Princeton in  
1912. Syracuse was beaten 66-0 by Union in 1893 and 75-0 by Union 
in 1891. 
</P>
<P>
	For Virginia Tech, it was the largest margin of victory since a  
73-0 victory over Catholic in 1922. The 6-0 start is Tech's best 
since 1967. 
</P>
<P>
	Hokies freshman quarterback Michael Vick continued his quick  
maturation. He was 8-for-16 for 135 yards and one touchdown. In his 
last three games, Vick is 26-of-37 for 605 yards with six 
touchdowns and no interceptions -- and he is dancing out of the way 
of tacklers. 
</P>
<P>
	``Vick gives them a dimension that is very special,'' Pasqualoni  
said. ``Even though he's only played in five or six games, he's 
throwing the ball with confidence. He's throwing and they're 
catching. He's elusive, kind of reminds you of (former Syracuse 
quarterbacks) Donovan McNabb or Marvin Graves.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Both teams have open dates next weekend, giving the Orangemen  
time to pull themselves together -- and the Hokies a little extra 
time to bask in the glow. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm proud of what we got going here,'' Beamer said.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Mulls Puerto Rico Bomb Range </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	VIEQUES, Puerto Rico (AP) -- Lightning flashes overhead and a  
hard rain falls as salsa singer Willie Colon joins protesters 
camping amid the craters on the U.S. Navy's beachfront bombing 
range. 
</P>
<P>
	The surreal stream of celebrities, politicians, clerics,  
athletes and fishermen who occupy the bomb-pocked campsites 
underscores the political quagmire facing President Clinton: Should 
he evict the protesters -- as the military demands -- and risk 
widespread civil disobedience in Puerto Rico? 
</P>
<P>
	On Tuesday, the U.S. Senate's Armed Services Committee will hear  
from Navy Secretary Richard Danzig, who wants bombing practice to 
resume, and Puerto Rico Gov. Pedro Rossello, who adamantly opposes 
it. 
</P>
<P>
	Like few other issues before it, the campaign to boot the Navy  
from the outlying island of Vieques has galvanized Puerto Rican 
nationalism and attracted politicians of all persuasions -- even 
those, like Rossello, who want to make this Spanish-speaking U.S. 
territory the 51st state of the union. 
</P>
<P>
	And it has given Independence Party chief Ruben Berrios, the  
protest leader, a platform far greater than the 3 percent showing 
his cause received in last December's plebiscite on statehood. 
</P>
<P>
	Defying repeated warnings from the Navy, protesters have  
occupied the range since David Sanes Rodriguez, a civilian security 
guard, was killed in a bombing accident April 19. 
</P>
<P>
	For many, that was the last straw in an on-again, off-again  
campaign to get the Navy off Vieques, a 20-mile-long island 
inhabited by 9,300 civilians. Bombing was halted after the 
accident, and Clinton is awaiting a Pentagon report on possible 
alternatives before deciding the issue. 
</P>
<P>
	The civilian occupation of the range ``is the ultimate  
expression of a people in a desperate state,'' Colon said. So 
desperate, some fear, that widespread civil disobedience -- even 
violence -- could ensue if Clinton doesn't hand over the Navy range 
to Puerto Rico. 
</P>
<P>
	Protesters have erected five tent camps along the white beaches  
of the range, located 10 miles from the island's main town, Isabel 
II. It is littered with bombs and artillery shells, water-filled 
craters, rusted scrap, charred tree bark -- the detritus of 
live-fire military exercises since World War II. 
</P>
<P>
	Skeleton crews run the camps during the week. The numbers swell  
into the hundreds on weekends, when families and friends come by 
boat, bringing food, drink and music. 
</P>
<P>
	The issue has dominated news media and street talk for months,  
and the chorus of indignation has drowned out those concerned about 
the consequences of rebellion for Puerto Rico, whose 4 million 
people have U.S. citizenship and get $11 billion annually in 
federal funds. 
</P>
<P>
	The Navy insists Vieques is vital to national security as the  
only place where East Coast fleets can train in simultaneous air, 
land and sea operations. It has been used to prepare for every U.S. 
conflict since Vietnam. 
</P>
<P>
	Losing Vieques could mean losing lives at war -- a risk not  
acceptable to the American public in this era of precision bombing, 
the Navy says. It also notes that Sanes Rodriguez's death was the 
first at the range in more than 50 years. 
</P>
<P>
	In an Oct. 13 meeting with Hispanic members of Congress, Clinton  
``expressed real concern for both the Puerto Rican perspective, but 
also the military readiness issues,'' said Maria Echaveste, a 
deputy chief of staff. 
</P>

	``We really solicited their viewpoint, their assistance, and  
acknowledged that some dignity needs to be restored to the 
relationship with the Puerto Ricans,'' Echaveste said. 
</P>
<P>
	Berrios, the independence activist, said he thinks Clinton's  
``heart is in the right place.'' But some protesters wonder if 
Clinton will risk alienating the Pentagon's supporters only weeks 
after his controversial pardon of Puerto Rican nationalists 
convicted of sedition. 
</P>
<P>
	Despite the ruins of the range, Vieques' eastern tip is hallowed  
ground for many local residents whose grandparents were bought out 
by the Navy in 1941. 
</P>
<P>
	The Navy acquired roughly two-thirds of Vieques -- land for a  
munitions dump on the western end and land for the bombing range on 
the eastern half. Vieques' civilians are sandwiched in between. 
</P>
<P>
	For years, they've complained about shaking windows and  
frightened schoolchildren, about high cancer rates and the use of 
napalm, about fisheries off limits to their fishing fleet. Recently 
the Navy admitted that it had mistakenly fired bullets tipped with 
depleted uranium in violation of federal laws and that it dropped 
napalm in 1993. 
</P>
<P>
	Prospects for a compromise seem slim. Puerto Rico's leaders have  
criticized a leaked proposal to allow the Navy five years before a 
pullout. And the Navy, for its part, says it cannot find another 
Atlantic range.

<HEADLINE> Stopping Dallas Starts With Emmitt </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	EAST RUTHERFORD, N.J. (AP) -- The New York Giants' defensive unit  
has enough to wonder about. Such as when the offense will start 
scoring. 
</P>
<P>
	Now the defense has something else to ponder -- the rejuvenation  
of Emmitt Smith. 
</P>
<P>
	The Dallas running back comes into Monday's night's game against  
the New York Giants leading the NFC in rushing with 409 yards. He 
also is tied for second overall in the league, just 14 yards behind 
Corey Dillon of the Cincinnati Bengals. 
</P>
<P>
	While Giants defensive line coach Denny Marcin has been in the  
league only three years, he insists Smith has gotten better the 
last few years. 
</P>
<P>
	``The first year we played them, I said: `Man, that's not the  
Emmitt Smith I saw on TV,'' the longtime college coach said. ``Last 
year, he turned it up and this year, to me, he looks like the best 
I've seen him. He's running hard, getting to the outside and making 
good cuts.'' 
</P>
<P>
	With receiver Michael Irvin sidelined indefinitely with a spinal  
injury, the Cowboys may need even more from Smith. He enters the 
game 25 yards shy of becoming the fourth NFL player to rush for 
13,000 yards in his career. 
</P>
<P>
	``I have confidence in the guys that are going to be in there,''  
Cowboys coach Chan Gailey said. ``But at the same time, anytime you 
lose a player of Michael's stature you lose something off your 
football team. It will have an impact. How much of an impact, 
remains to be seen.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Even if Irvin were playing, the Giants' approach would be to  
stop Smith first. 
</P>
<P>
	``They're not one-dimensional,'' safety Percy Ellsworth said.  
``We can hold Emmitt to 60-some-odd yards and still lose because 
Troy (Aikman) can throw for 300. 
</P>
<P>
	``But we have to at least get them to the point where we know  
they will pass and then see how we match up,'' Ellsworth added. 
``We're a solid group in the secondary, so if we can stop the run 
and force them to pass, we should have some success.'' 
</P>
<P>
	That's not always been the case. In the last six games against  
the Giants, Smith has carried 103 times for 415 yards and two 
touchdowns. That's a 69.2-yard average, 4.0 per carry. 
</P>
<P>
	What's even more interesting is that in Dallas' 16-6 win over  
the Giants last Nov. 8, Smith rushed for 163 yards. That means in 
the other five games against New York, he had only 252 yards 
combined, or 50 yards on average. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't think that we will allow Michael's injury to determine  
how we are going to approach the game offensively,'' Aikman said. 
``That is really the way we have done it for quite some time.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In the Cowboys' 31-7 win at Giants Stadium on a Monday night  
early last season, Deion Sanders scored on a punt return and an 
interception return. He also set up another TD with a 55-yard pass 
reception. 
</P>
<P>
	``They're still good,'' Giants All Pro defensive end Michael  
Strahan said. ``They're better with Michael Irvin, don't get me 
wrong. But without him, they are still a good offense. The key is 
stopping the running game and, with Dallas, that means Emmitt.'' 
</P>
<P>
	On the other hand, the Giants have struggled all season  
offensively, whether it's been with Kent Graham or Kerry Collins at 
quarterback. Graham will be back this week after missing last 
week's 14-3 loss to Arizona because of a concussion. 
</P>
<P>
	The loss triggered an offense vs. defense tiff for a day or so,  
but that dispute has subsided, for now. 
</P>
<P>
	``We need to win for the morale of the team,'' kicker Brad  
Daluiso said. ``That would help a lot. To get a win on national 
television against the Cowboys, it would do a lot for us.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But here's a bad statistic for Giants: Dallas is 6-0 in Monday  
night games against New York.

<HEADLINE> Lesbian Moms Left in Legal Limbo </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	With a mother's love, Kathleen Crandell writes every week to two  
girls she cannot visit. Whether they get the letters, she doesn't 
know. 
</P>
<P>
	Crandell helped raise the girls before splitting with her  
lesbian partner and considers them her daughters. Distraught when 
excluded from their lives, she sued for visitation rights -- and 
lost. Under California law, she has no greater right to access than 
a stranger. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't think, unless you've lost a kid, you can even fathom  
what it's like,'' Crandell says. ``It's pretty much every moment. 
It's a constant level of missing them.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Similarly wrenching cases are surfacing across the nation as  
more lesbian partners raise children born after artificial 
insemination. When such couples separate, dissolving a union that 
no state recognizes as marriage, the partner who is not the 
biological parent finds herself in legal limbo. 
</P>
<P>
	In California, New York and Florida, state courts have ruled  
within the past 18 months that lesbian ex-partners are not entitled 
to visitation rights with children they helped nurture, regardless 
of how deep the emotional bond. 
</P>
<P>
	Massachusetts' highest court, in contrast, granted visitation  
rights in June to a lesbian who helped raise her ex-partner's son. 
The woman was a ``de facto'' parent, said the court, winning praise 
from gay-rights groups for asserting that nontraditional families 
deserve legal respect. 
</P>
<P>
	The Massachusetts judges were venturing into a legal vacuum; one  
dissenting justice condemned the ruling as an unwarranted step 
toward endorsing same-sex marriages. 
</P>
<P>
	Courts in many other states have sided categorically with the  
biological mother in such disputes, ruling that estranged lesbian 
partners have no more legal right to demand visitation than a 
long-term nanny or close family friend. 
</P>
<P>
	``The courts aren't used to looking at people without a  
biological relationship as being a child's parent,'' says Michael 
Adams, associate director of the American Civil Liberties Union's 
lesbian and gay rights project. ``We are forced to work within laws 
passed by legislatures that simply never considered these 
circumstances, and we can get some very unfortunate results.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Gay-rights activists don't contend that every ex-partner's  
demand should be granted. But they do want courts at least to 
consider whether requested visitation rights might be in a child's 
best interest. 
</P>
<P>
	``We want courts to force our families to play by the very same  
rules that heterosexual couples have been forced to play by for 
decades,'' says Kate Kendell, executive director of the National 
Center for Lesbian Rights in San Francisco. ``We don't want 
anything special or different.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In Crandell's case, the California Supreme Court in July let  
stand an appeals court ruling against her. The lower court said no 
legal grounds exist for granting visitation rights to a nonparent 
over the biological mother's objection. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's the height of irony, given that California has perhaps  
more lesbian couples raising children than any other state,'' 
Kendell says. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're not talking about live-in girlfriends. We're not talking  
about a nanny. We all know a parent when we see one -- someone who 
read a child stories at night, who changed their diapers, who was 
there day in, day out, nurturing and caring.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Crandell, now 43, and her partner started living together in  
1985 when the partner's daughter was almost 3. Two years later, the 
partner gave birth to another daughter by artificial insemination. 
</P>
<P>
	The couple jointly raised the two girls until separating in  
1990. In 1994 the ex-partner demanded that Crandell cease her 
periodic visits. 
</P>
<P>
	The court ruling means Crandell cannot see the children until  
they turn 18. They are now 17 and 12. 
</P>
<P>
	Crandell hasn't ruled out trying to take her case to the U.S.  
Supreme Court, though she has modest hopes. ``Nothing has been more 
important to me than asking for my children in every possible 
way,'' she said in a telephone interview. 
</P>
<P>
	The next major ruling on the issue may come in New Jersey. The  
state Supreme Court plans hearings this fall on an appeals court's 
split decision granting a lesbian visitation rights to her former 
partner's twin toddlers. 
</P>
<P>
	The twins, a boy and girl, were born two years after the women  
began living together, and the plaintiff shared child-rearing 
duties with the biological mother. Each took turns changing 
diapers, picking up the twins from day care, rocking them to sleep. 
</P>
<P>
	To date, virtually every high-profile court case regarding  
children of same-sex partners has involved lesbians, not gay men. 
That could change, however, as liberalized adoption policies expand 
the ranks of gay fathers. 
</P>
<P>
	Although many gay-rights groups have intervened in the court  
cases to espouse the validity of same-sex partnerships, they would 
prefer that couples avoid litigation. 
</P>
<P>
	This summer, an alliance of groups published guidelines for  
same-sex couples, urging those who want children to agree in 
advance on how to solve problems that might arise if they separate. 
Options vary from state to state, but it is often possible for a 
partner to become a legal parent through guardianship or adoption. 
</P>
<P>
	``There are ways to resolve these things outside of court,''  
says Mary Bonauto, a Boston lawyer who drafted the guidelines. ``We 
have a legal system that for the most part does not acknowledge the 
legal existence of our families. So it's important that we honor 
our own agreements.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Bonauto, civil rights director for Gay and Lesbian Advocates and  
Defenders, says children of same-sex couples, and the gay-rights 
movement, can be losers when a case goes to court. 
</P>
<P>
	``It is extremely damaging to our community and our families  
when we disavow as insignificant the very relationships for which 
we are seeking legal and societal respect,'' she wrote in the 
guidelines. 
</P>
<P>
	As a positive example, Bonauto cites Joyce Kauffman, a  
lesbian-rights lawyer in Boston who settled a child-custody dispute 
with her former partner without litigation. 
</P>
<P>
	Kauffman gave birth to her daughter, Becca, as a single mother  
15 years ago, and soon afterward began a relationship that lasted 
four years. 
</P>
<P>
	When the partners broke up, and realized how distraught the  
child was, they decided to continue co-parenting. For the past 10 
years, Becca has spent half of each week with each of the women, 
who live a few blocks apart. 
</P>
<P>
	``My daughter still calls both of us Mom,'' Kauffman says. ``It  
was not my favorite thing to do, to deal with my ex-partner all the 
time. But I didn't feel I had any right to curtail my daughter's 
relationship with her. I felt morally it would have been wrong.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Kauffman is frustrated by the tactics some lesbian mothers use  
to oppose visitation rights. 
</P>
<P>
	``We've been working so hard for so many decades to gain  
respect,'' she says. ``Then to have people within our own community 
use homophobic law against other gay and lesbian people -- that 
really troubles me. If we don't respect our own relationships, how 
can we expect other people to respect them?''

<HEADLINE> South Pole Doctor Returning to U.S. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- The doctor who gave herself chemotherapy for a  
lump on her breast she discovered while at the South Pole said 
shortly before her rescue that she was anxious about her prognosis. 
</P>
<P>
	``I am sick and would like to go the hospital and learn my  
fate,'' Dr. Jerri Nielsen said in an e-mail exchange with Newsweek 
a few days before a daring air mission evacuated her from the U.S. 
National Science Foundation's South Pole research station. 
</P>
<P>
	Nielsen, from Youngstown, Ohio, was rescued Saturday by a crew  
from the New York Air National Guard's 109th Airlift Wing. 
</P>
<P>
	The 47-year-old discovered a lump in her breast in June, which  
is wintertime in the Antarctic. An air drop of medical supplies in 
July allowed her to begin treating herself with chemotherapy. 
</P>
<P>
	She performed her own biopsy and then e-mailed photographs of  
slide samples to doctors in the United States, Newsweek reported. 
At her request, the National Science Foundation has not released 
details of her diagnosis or condition. 
</P>
<P>
	But Newsweek, citing an Science Foundation source, reports in  
its October 25 issue that after Nielsen completed the first round 
of chemotherapy, doctors advised her to begin a second round. The 
magazine released a copy of the story Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	Temperatures finally thawed enough last week for a transport  
plane to land at the station, evacuate her and drop off another 
doctor to care for the 41 people living there. 
</P>
<P>
	Nielsen's sister-in-law, Diana Cahill, said Nielsen was flying  
to the United States on Sunday with her brothers, who met her at a 
stopover in New Zealand. 
</P>
<P>
	``The distance between she and the family, to not be able to  
physically comfort her, has been hard,'' said Cahill.

<HEADLINE> Airlines Offering Same-Sex Benefits </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ARLINGTON, Va. (AP) -- As gay and lesbian workers fight for  
benefits for their partners, this summer brought good news for 
those working in the airline industry. 
</P>
<P>
	In less than two weeks, three major airlines announced they  
would extend employee benefits to homosexuals. Just like that, the 
airlines joined the entertainment and high-tech industries as the 
most visible business sectors to offer such benefits. 
</P>
<P>
	United Airlines, the nation's largest, was the first to make the  
decision, on July 30, followed closely by American Airlines and US 
Airways. 
</P>
<P>
	Despite the good will the airlines hope the policies will  
engender among their gay workers and customers, the rush to add 
benefits was triggered by a court decision. 
</P>
<P>
	In July, a federal judge in San Francisco ordered Chicago-based  
United to provide employee flight discounts, bereavement leave and 
medical leave to both same-sex couples and unmarried heterosexuals 
living together. 
</P>
<P>
	The judge's decision was designed to bring United into  
compliance with a San Francisco city ordinance. 
</P>
<P>
	Hours after an appeals court upheld that ruling, United  
announced it would offer all benefits, including health insurance, 
to partners of employees and retirees nationwide beginning next 
May. 
</P>
<P>
	US Airways and American said their new policies apply so far  
only to gay couples. They're still studying extending them to 
live-in heterosexuals. 
</P>
<P>
	American, based in Fort Worth, Texas, expects to have the new  
benefits in place by spring 2000, spokesman Tim Kincaid said. 
</P>
<P>
	US Airways, based in Arlington, is discussing the scope of the  
benefits with labor leaders and hasn't yet set a date for their 
implementation, spokesman David Castleveter said. 
</P>
<P>
	``These policies make good business sense,'' said Kim Mills,  
spokeswoman for the Human Rights Campaign, which says about 2,800 
companies and 74 Fortune 500s have implemented same-sex benefit 
policies. 
</P>
<P>
	``In a labor market where unemployment is running at about four  
percent, it's hard for companies to attract and keep good 
employees,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	The Human Rights Campaign is discussing the policies with other  
airlines, including Continental, Delta, Southwest and Northwest, 
officials from the Washington-based nonprofit group said. 
</P>
<P>
	The policies are expected to raise costs for the airlines, but  
it's difficult to say by how much. 
</P>
<P>
	``We don't know yet how it's going to fall out,'' said  
American's Kincaid, noting the airline has no idea how many 
employees are gay and how many will sign up. Because benefits to 
same-sex partners are taxable income, many employees may not sign 
up, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Some companies have balked at such policies because of fears  
that health insurance premiums would jump if employees' partners 
with HIV or AIDS had to be covered, Kincaid said. 
</P>
<P>
	In fact, same-sex benefits may be inexpensive because they  
generally will not have to cover the costs of troubled pregnancies 
or children, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	``Most companies have found that it's a much lower impact than  
what was expected,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	The high-tech industry pioneered the effort in the late 1980s  
when Lotus Development Corp. implemented same-sex benefits. Since 
then, Microsoft and IBM, among others, have followed. 
</P>
<P>
	In the entertainment industry, most of the major studios have  
added gay-friendly policies, including Fox, Walt Disney Corp. and 
Sony Pictures. 
</P>
<P>
	Other industries that have seen some companies add same-sex  
benefits include banking and oil, Human Rights Campaign officials 
said. Chevron, based in San Francisco, was the first oil company to 
take the leap, and was followed by Shell, BP Amoco and Mobil. 
</P>
<P>
	The San Francisco court decision also caused Bank of America and  
Wells Fargo &AMP; Co. to offer same-sex benefits. 
</P>
<P>
	``A lot of companies want to be second. They don't want to be  
first,'' Ms. Mills said. 
</P>
<P>
	Not everyone is pleased with the changes.  
</P>
<P>
	``We feel like it's a continuing attack on the traditional  
family,'' said Herb Hollinger, spokesman for Southern Baptist 
Convention. 
</P>
<P>
	The Baptists have been among the loudest critics of same-sex  
benefits policies. Church leaders urged their 15 million members in 
1997 to boycott Walt Disney when Disney announced a similar policy. 
</P>
<P>
	Even so, Hollinger said the Baptists have called for no boycotts  
of the airlines. 
</P>
<P>
	``I can understand from a business point of view,'' he said.  
``We think it's a commentary on our culture, in which it's 
basically `anything goes.'''

	Murder Rate Drops to 31-Year Low  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The U.S. murder rate fell to a 31-year low as  
the overall violent crime rate dropped to its lowest figure since 
1985, the FBI reported today. The murder rate of 6.3 per 100,000 
residents is the lowest since 6.2 in 1967. Also, one of the most 
terrifying crimes that rose along with the crack epidemic -- murder 
by a stranger -- dropped below half of all murders, to 48 percent, 
for only the second time during the 1990s.

	Group Calls Low-Carb Diet Unhealthy  
</P>
<P>
	ATLANTA (AP) -- Many dietitians and health experts, 10,000 of  
whom will be in Atlanta this week for the American Dietetic 
Association's annual meeting, say the popular protein diet is an 
unhealthy fad and the weight loss is temporary. The high-protein, 
no-carb plan is ``a nightmare of a diet,'' said Kathleen Zelman, a 
registered dietitian and ADA spokeswoman. Along with the risk of 
increasing cholesterol levels, the diet could cause kidney problems 
or possibly a loss of calcium in the bones, she said.

	Irene Drenches N.C., But May Skirt Shore

<P>
	WILMINGTON, N.C. (AP) -- Hurricane Irene drenched southeastern  
North Carolina with nearly half a foot of rain today as it churned 
up the coast, unleashing more flooding. The National Hurricane 
Center in Miami said there was a chance Irene and its 75 mph winds 
might skirt the North Carolina coast without coming ashore. But the 
greatest concern is rain, not wind, and the eastern coastal plain, 
inundated by Hurricane Floyd just four weeks ago, is especially 
vulnerable to more flooding.

their attacks around Chechnya's capital Sunday, while the 
republic's president called for urgent negotiations to end the 
fighting. The Russian commander in Chechnya, Col. Gen. Viktor 
Kazantsev, said Sunday his forces had taken a strategic ridge 20 
miles northwest of Grozny, south of the Terek River that cuts 
across the northern third of Chechnya. Also on Sunday, Chechen 
President Aslan Maskhadov called for talks, despite the Kremlin's 
earlier refusals.

	Indiana Jury Convicts Ex-Nurse for 6 Murders  
</P>
<P>
	BRAZIL, Ind. (AP) -- A former nurse was convicted of murder today  
in the deaths of six patients at a western Indiana hospital. Jurors 
hearing the case of Orville Lynn Majors told the judge they could 
not reach a verdict on the seventh count. Majors, 38, could be 
sentenced to life in prison. He contended the patients died of the 
ailments that put them in the hospital, but prosecutors said the 
deaths were consistent with injections of potassium chloride, 
epinephrine or both.

	Wall St. Tries To Rebound From Rough Week

630.05 points, or 5.9 percent, to close at 10,019.71 last week. It 
was the Dow's worst week ever in terms of points lost, and the 
worst of the decade in terms of percentages. The next major 
barometer of inflation will be the Consumer Price Index, due out on 
Tuesday.

<HEADLINE> Ventura Loses Apparent Grand Slam </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	The longest major league postseason game that ever was ended  
similarly to the longest perfect game that wasn't. 
</P>
<P>
	Robin Ventura, meet Joe Adcock.  
</P>
<P>
	And say hello to Chris Chambliss, Bill Mazeroski and Joe Carter,  
who had similar adventures on title-winning homers. 
</P>
<P>
	When Ventura lost his apparent grand slam for failing to touch  
second base -- and third, and home plate -- in the 15th inning of the 
New York Mets' wild 4-3 playoff victory over Atlanta on Sunday, it 
was the second such bizarre and memorable finish involving the 
Braves. 
</P>
<P>
	Forty years ago this season, Harvey Haddix of the Pittsburgh  
Pirates pitched the greatest game in major league history against 
the-then Milwaukee Braves, hurling 12 perfect innings before losing 
3-0 on Joe Adcock's home run in the 13th inning. 
</P>
<P>
	Only it wasn't a home run.  
</P>
<P>
	The score of the May 26, 1959 game was changed to 1-0 a day  
later by National League president Warren Giles because Adcock 
passed Hank Aaron on the bases, turning his homer into a 
game-winning single. 
</P>
<P>
	This time, Ventura hit a ball over the center field fence at  
Shea Stadium with the bases loaded. Ordinarily, that's a grand 
slam. But Ventura never made it around the bases, mobbed by his 
teammates at second base. 
</P>
<P>
	The ruling was an RBI-single for Ventura and a final score of  
4-3 instead of 7-3. 
</P>
<P>
	``I saw it go over and then I just ran to first,'' Ventura said.  
``As long as I touched first, we won. So that's fine with me.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In the 1959 game, Haddix retired the first 36 batters he faced --  
still a major league single-game record -- before an error by third 
baseman Don Hoak gave the Braves their first base runner of the 
game. 
</P>
<P>
	Eddie Mathews then sacrificed Mantilla to second. Hank Aaron was  
intentionally walked to set up the possible double play. 
</P>
<P>
	With the no-hitter still in place, Adcock came up. He hit a high  
slider over the right-center field for a game-winning three-run 
homer. Or so everyone in the crowd of 19,194 thought. 
</P>
<P>
	Aaron, who had touched second base, thought the ball had bounced  
at the bottom of the wall, not beyond it, and stopped running, 
assuming the game had ended as soon as Mantilla scored. 
</P>
<P>
	Adcock, running the bases as normal and did not look up. He did  
not see Aaron stop, passed him up and was declared out. 
</P>
<P>
	The next day's newspapers declared the score as 2-0. At first,  
only Adcock's run was wiped out. But Giles officially changed the 
score to 1-0. 
</P>
<P>
	Haddix's reaction to the scoring change was almost identical to  
Ventura, who said, ``I don't care if it was a home run or not as 
long as we won.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Haddix, who lost the game and, three decades later, saw the  
no-hitter tag removed from his game by a historical committee, 
said, ``I didn't care what the score was. All I know was we lost.'' 
</P>
<P>
	On three other famous game-winning homers, the hitters had to  
fight their way around the bases. 
</P>
<P>
	Chambliss hit the pennant-winner for the New York Yankees in the  
ninth inning of the 1976 playoffs against Kansas City. He was 
mobbed by joyous fans, who ran on the field at Yankee Stadium, and 
battled his way around the bases. An hour or so later, he came back 
on the field to touch home plate, just in case someone thought he 
had missed it the first time. 
</P>
<P>
	``Home plate was gone. Somebody had already taken it,''  
Chambliss recounted Sunday night. ``There were no umps there, 
either. But a few of them told me years later that the run counted 
because it was fans that were in the way.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Mazeroski won the 1960 World Series for Pittsburgh against the  
Yankees with a home run and ran through fans to complete his 
circuit of the bases. Toronto's Carter did the same thing to win 
the Series against Philadelphia in 1993.

<HEADLINE> Poland Highlights Chopin's Music </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WARSAW, Poland (AP) -- Playing his uniquely melodic music and  
celebrating Mass at the cathedral where his heart is kept, Poland 
and the world on Sunday marked 150 years since the death of 
composer Frederic Chopin. 
</P>
<P>
	The events were the highlight of the worldwide Chopin year,  
declared in 1999 by Polish musical and cultural officials, to mark 
the death anniversary of Poland's greatest composer and one of 
world's leading piano music authors. 
</P>
<P>
	Chopin was born in 1810 in Zelazowa Wola, some 37 miles west of  
Warsaw, to a Polish mother and French father. In search of the best 
piano teachers and larger audiences, Chopin left Poland at the age 
of 20 and traveled to Vienna and then to Paris, where he settled in 
1831 and died Oct. 19, 1849 at the age of 39. 
</P>
<P>
	``Chopin's music is the most valuable thing that Poland can  
offer to the uniting Europe,'' President Aleksander Kwasniewski 
said before a concert in Zelazowa Wola by Polish pianist Halina 
Czerny-Stefanska. 
</P>
<P>
	For Poles it is ``a sign of national identity, at the same time  
its universal artistic value and beauty belong to the whole 
world,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Earlier, Kwasniewski laid flowers at a Chopin monument in  
Warsaw's picturesque Lazienki park, where outdoor concerts of the 
composer's music are held every summer. 
</P>
<P>
	A Mass was celebrated in the Holy Cross church in Warsaw where  
Chopin's heart is deposited. The composer was buried at the Pere 
Lachaise cemetery in Paris, but according to his will, his heart 
was brought to Warsaw. 
</P>
<P>
	In Paris, Polish pianist Krystian Zimerman was to give a concert  
at the Salle Pleyel, where Chopin used to play.

<HEADLINE> 'Dame Edna' Leaves Audiences Giddy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 *An AP Entertainment Review    	
</P>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- There may be more theatrical sights on Broadway  
this season but for sheer blissful incongruity it will be hard to 
top a sea of gladioluses gracefully bobbing above contented, 
exhausted theatergoers at the Booth Theater. 
</P>
<P>
	Contented and exhausted because they have just laughed  
themselves silly over the antics of Dame Edna Everage, the creation 
and alter ego of Australian actor Barry Humphries. The performer 
has discovered there is gold in drag, particularly in England, 
where this exotic creature has flourished for more than two 
decades. Now, she's set to make her mark here. 
</P>
<P>
	The glads have been flung into the audience by Dame Edna at the  
end of her show, which opened Sunday at the Booth. It's called, 
appropriately enough ``Dame Edna: The Royal Tour.'' The Dame 
exhorts her fans -- possums, she calls them -- to thrust those 
flowers into the air and join her in a catchy little tune -- and 
they slavishly comply. 
</P>
<P>
	What does Dame Edna do exactly? Sing? More off-key than on.  
Dance? Ginger Rogers, she's not. Act? The woman is from the 
heaving-bosom-and-rolling-eyeball school of emoting. 
</P>
<P>
	What Dame Edna does better than anyone else is chat. She talks  
to the audience, bringing them into her gaudy world, a stage 
setting designed by Kenneth Foy that looks like a cross between a 
Las Vegas wedding chapel and Barbie's doll house. 
</P>
<P>
	Dame Edna herself could be Barbie's dizzy aunt, slightly naughty  
and not above a few catty remarks about everyone from Nicole Kidman 
to Dame Judi Dench. Her hair, purple cotton candy rather than 
coiffed, and her outfits -- check out the pink and silver shift in 
the first act -- celebrate excess. 
</P>
<P>
	``The Royal Tour'' is subtitled ``The Show that Listens,'' and  
Dame Edna does that, too. It is part of Humphries' genius that he 
works his conversations with audience members into an important 
part of the act. The results are sublimely funny, as the Dame 
tweaks herself and her willing victims. 
</P>
<P>
	Dame Edna has no doubts about her status as housewife, megastar,  
icon and adviser to the Queen of England. She dispenses wisdom with 
maternal pride, talking with theatergoers about their clothes, 
eating habits, decorating ability and their children. 
</P>
<P>
	Edna also talks about her family: unmarried son Kenny, a fashion  
designer with a penchant for leather and head of the Yvonne DeCarlo 
Appreciation Society, and daughter Valmai, who lives in one of New 
York's outer boroughs with her same-sex partner, a former tennis 
star of Eastern European descent. Then there is Edna's mother, who 
is spending her remaining days in ``a maximum security twilight 
home.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Humphries gleefully attacks the cult of celebrity while having  
his creation revel in it. Dame Edna has no doubt about her worth. 
She cheerfully and publicly corrects flaws in others, but ``only in 
the nicest way possible.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Audience participation is a dangerous game, but Humphries gets  
the most out of eager theatergoers, turning innocuous facts he 
learns about them into belly laughs. He even parades a couple on 
stage to eat a meal and dresses up others as members of the Royal 
Family. 
</P>
<P>
	For all the supposed spontaneity of the evening, the show is  
carefully constructed. Humphries operates loosely with that 
structure, but he thinks fast and furiously enough to insure the 
laughs don't stop. ``Dame Edna: The Royal Tour'' makes for mighty 
entertainment -- but then, the woman, of course, is invincible.

<HEADLINE> Scratch Pad Wins Alcibiades Stakes </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LEXINGTON, Ky. (AP) -- Racing with a substitute jockey on an  
unfamiliar track, Scratch Pad swept to a three-length victory 
Sunday in the $400,000 Alcibiades Stakes at Keeneland, earning a 
start in next month's Breeders' Cup Juvenile Fillies. 
</P>
<P>
	It was a tough trip for Scratch Pad, who had difficulties in the  
paddock and at the gate before settling in and racing to victory 
over eight other 2-year-old fillies. Rare Beauty was second and 
Cash Run third, another 6 1/2 lengths back. 
</P>
<P>
	Scratch Pad covered 1 1-16 miles on a fast track in 1:44.16.  
</P>
<P>
	Trainer Joseph Waunsch said Scratch Pad first acted up in the  
paddock and was taken back to her stall to be saddled. There, she 
threw herself over when she was startled by a flashbulb. 
</P>
<P>
	``I said, `There it goes,''' the trainer said afterward. ``There  
was no way. When they act stupid like that, they don't come back 
and run good. They take the race out of them.'' 
</P>
<P>
	To further complicate matters, jockey Willie Martinez had to  
back the filly out of the starting gate and dismount so her 
blinkers, which had come loose, could be changed by the starters. 
Again, she became fractious. 
</P>
<P>
	``It seemed like, for a moment, everything went against us,''  
Martinez said. ``That just shows you when a good horse is a good 
horse. ... Once she got into the race, she was good. She settled 
good. She's a big, long-strided filly.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Settling into the middle of the pack, Scratch Pad went five-wide  
on the backstretch as she moved up, then edged toward the rail on 
the second turn as she closed in on Cash Run, the favorite and 
early pacesetter. 
</P>
<P>
	Scratch Pad took the lead at the top of the stretch and drew  
clear even as she drifted out. 
</P>
<P>
	The winner paid $12.60, $5.60 and $3, while Rare Beauty was  
$6.40 and $3.80, and Cash Run was $2.80 to show. 
</P>
<P>
	Martinez got his start as a jockey riding for Waunsch at Tampa  
Bay Downs a decade ago. He was a late substitute for Eibar Coa, who 
chose to remain at Miami's Calder Race Course, where Hurricane 
Irene had delayed several races from Friday and Saturday to Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	``He was on a lot of favorites and Coa wants to be the leading  
rider. He's three wins in front, and he wants to stay that way,'' 
Waunsch said. ``So I guess it was more important to him to be a 
leading rider than to possibly ride a Breeders' Cup winner.'' 
</P>
<P>
	After running all four of her previous starts at Calder, Waunsch  
said Scratch Pad probably would have stayed there and run in the 
Florida Stallion Series for 2-year-old fillies -- if breeder Tim 
Ahearn hadn't missed a $50 nomination payment. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is great,'' he said. ``I'm not complaining. I'm glad we  
came.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The way Scratch Pad handled the Alcibiades field, Waunsch said  
he was confident she can take on other top contenders like Darling 
My Darling and unbeaten Chilukki at the Nov. 6 Breeders' Cup at 
Gulfstream. 
</P>
<P>
	``Maybe she'll only win by a length, but that'll be good enough  
for me,'' he said with a laugh. 
</P>
<P>
	In an earlier stakes, the $100,000 Thoroughbred Club of America,  
Bourbon Belle outdueled Cinemine down the stretch of the 
six-furlong sprint for older fillies and mares, only to be placed 
second when stewards ruled jockey Patrick Johnson interfered with 
Cinemine.

<HEADLINE> Calif. Quake Uncovers Active Fault </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PASADENA, Calif. (AP) -- California's magnitude-7.0 earthquake  
exposed a fault line previously considered inactive and proved a 
perfect test for the U.S. Geological Survey's new quake data 
network, geologists said Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	The temblor, which struck at 2:46 a.m. Saturday near Ludlow  
caused minor injuries and light damage. It occurred along a 
25-mile-long fault geologists had only partly mapped, said USGS 
geologist Ken Hudnut. 
</P>
<P>
	But geologists didn't bother naming or researching the fault  
because its remote location made it a low priority compared with 
faults, such as the San Andreas, that are located near heavily 
populated areas. 
</P>
<P>
	``We weren't going to do a lot of research along a fault that  
would only bother a rattlesnake,'' said Lucy Jones, a USGS 
seismologist. 
</P>
<P>
	Now it has a name: the Lavic Lake fault, named for a dry lake  
bed near the Mojave Desert through which the fault broke ground. 
The quake that rocked the Southwest will make Lavic one of the most 
studied faults these next few years. 
</P>
<P>
	``We got a lot of information about this quake, a ton,'' said  
Hudnut. 
</P>
<P>
	He said the more geologists can learn about the physics of  
earthquakes, the more they can do to advise planners to avoid 
building on active faults and keep buildings already on them safer 
during temblors. 
</P>
<P>
	Among things they learned: the deadly 1992 Landers earthquake  
that hit the area near Big Bear Lake had a large effect on the 
Lavic Lake fault and could have hastened Saturday's quake. 
</P>
<P>
	Jones said scientists are still studying how earth stress  
affects faults. 
</P>
<P>
	The quake also was the first major event recorded on the TriNet  
quake data system, a network of 200 seismographic stations that 
measure quake intensity and other properties. The system and 
stations are linked by computer. 
</P>
<P>
	By 2001, scientists expect TriNet to grow to 670 stations. It's  
a joint project of the USGS, the California Institute of Technology 
in Pasadena, and the California Division of Mines and Geology.

<HEADLINE> Fires Blaze Across Northern Calif. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BELLA VISTA, Calif. (AP) -- Fires burned out of control across  
thousands of acres of brush and grass on Sunday in Northern 
California, where the blazes have destroyed scores of homes and 
forced thousands of people to evacuate. 
</P>
<P>
	Winds moderated in the afternoon and some of those forced on  
Saturday to flee a 20,000-acre fire in Shasta County were allowed 
to return to see if they still had homes. More than 100 structures 
were destroyed. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's people calling who I've known for 20 years, calling to  
see if their houses are okay,'' said volunteer Fire Capt. Jan 
Gross. ``I don't have the heart to tell them they've lost it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Karen Jane Savage, 44, a volunteer firefighter from Junction  
City, Calif., died after she was hit by a fire truck near the 
blaze, said Rose Wyckoff of the California Department of Forestry. 
</P>
<P>
	The fire was 20 percent contained Sunday, and full containment  
was expected by late Monday, Wyckoff said. Some 940 people were 
fighting the blaze. 
</P>
<P>
	Dozens of homes were destroyed Saturday by the fast-moving fire,  
which began at 4:15 a.m., fanned by winds gusting to 25 mph. The 
loss by Sunday was estimated at $5 million. 
</P>
<P>
	Exact numbers of homes destroyed would likely not be available  
until the flames were extinguished, fire officials said. 
</P>
<P>
	A fire about 50 miles northwest of Sacramento that started  
Saturday had burned more than 36,000 acres by Sunday morning. One 
home was lost, and some 430 firefighters, along with a dozen 
bulldozers, five helicopters and six air tankers, were fighting to 
keep the flames away from other homes in a vacation area near Lake 
Berryessa. 
</P>
<P>
	In Yuba County, about 50 miles north of Sacramento, a fire  
charred 5,120 acres and threatened about 500 structures in the 
Dobbins and Challenge areas, which were evacuated Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	In Trinity County, a fire that began two months ago has so far  
burned 111,000 acres. 
</P>
<P>
	Along the central coast, meanwhile, two fires in the Los Padres  
National Forest continued to burn after scorching more than 85,000 
acres.

<HEADLINE> Five Found Dead in Denver Car </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DENVER (AP) -- Three women and two men were killed when the car  
they were in apparently missed a stop sign at the bottom of a steep 
hill and came to rest upside down in a river south of downtown, 
police said. 
</P>
<P>
	Detective Virginia Lopez said police received a call shortly  
after 9 a.m. from someone who reported seeing the car. One of the 
officers who responded immediately jumped into the Platte River and 
tried to break the car's windows to free the victims, but he was 
unsuccessful, Ms. Lopez said. 
</P>
<P>
	It appeared the victims had been dead for some time.  
</P>
<P>
	``They could have been there anywhere between last night and 9  
this morning,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Lopez said there were no cans or bottles inside the car to  
indicate whether alcohol was a factor in the accident, but she said 
tests would be conducted on the victims.

<HEADLINE> Colombia Auctions Cattle on Video </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MEDELLIN, Colombia (AP) -- Contestants parade before the admiring  
gazes of the all-male audience while the master of ceremonies reads 
off the contenders' full-bodied measurements. 
</P>
<P>
	``Check out those beauties,'' exclaims Arturo Jaraba, the  
evening's host at the video cattle auction in an air-conditioned 
conference center in the capital of war-wracked Antioquia state. 
</P>
<P>
	``Look at the way they walk,'' he beams.  
</P>
<P>
	Popularized a decade ago in the United States as a low-cost way  
to unite distant buyers and sellers, the auctioning of cattle 
videotaped on faraway ranches is catching on in Colombia for an 
even more compelling reason. 
</P>
<P>
	The gatherings in safe urban venues allow ranchers to do  
business without venturing personally into Colombia's lawless 
countryside,where they are coveted kidnap targets for leftist 
rebels trying to finance their 35-year-old struggle. 
</P>
<P>
	The auctions have also become social events. The ranchers swap  
stories, whisper secrets, tell jokes and sip aguardiente, a 
traditional licorice-flavored liqueur served by cheerful 
waitresses. 
</P>
<P>
	``This has been my savior,'' said Javier Builes, a burly  
57-year-old cattleman who has sold hundreds of heads of cattle at 
the events, which began in Medellin in March and have extended to 
four other cities. 
</P>
<P>
	Builes said he's narrowly escaped three abduction attempts,  
although other family members have fallen prey. A nephew was freed 
in September after seven months held captive by Colombia's largest 
rebel band, the leftist Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia, or 
FARC. 
</P>
<P>
	``Cattle ranchers are the most ravaged of the industries,'' said  
Juan Mesa, who directs the private Pais Libre anti-kidnapping 
foundation. ``They are immensely vulnerable.'' 
</P>
<P>
	About 10 percent of the victims of the nearly 2,000 abductions  
reported annually in Colombia are cattlemen, snared by guerrillas, 
common criminals and right-wing militias who are the rebels' main 
rivals, Mesa said. 
</P>
<P>
	Those who do roam their lands unmolested have typically  
``vaccinated'' themselves by making sizable payoffs to the rebels. 
Between 1997 and 1998 cattlemen shelled out $131 million in 
extortion payments, according to the National Cattle Ranchers 
Federation. 
</P>
<P>
	The insecurity, says the federation, is taking a devastating  
toll in Latin America's third-ranking cattle industry, one that 
employs some 300,000 people and is an integral part of the national 
folklore. 
</P>
<P>
	Although many cattle buyers will still only purchase an animal  
they can inspect firsthand, the video auction trend is catching on 
with a total of 16,000 animals sold, said Jarabe, the auctioneer 
who has pioneered the practice in Colombia. 
</P>
<P>
	Besides the security factor, many ranchers are learning they can  
avoid the costs of transporting their cattle to the auctions, long 
trips in which the cows often arrive underweight after days without 
eating. 
</P>
<P>
	Prior to each video auction, Jaraba's firm sends crews out to  
film the cattle on the absentee owners' ranches, which are 
typically run by local hired hands. 
</P>
<P>
	One sunny afternoon on a ranch in Monteria, a town 170 miles  
north of Medellin, company employee Carmelo Carcamo jotted down the 
weight, color, and ages of a dozen hunchbacked Brahman cattle. With 
a portable video camera he then filmed the animals striding in a 
pack along a dung-strewn corral beside a vast green pasture. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's simple,'' said Carcamo, who visits as many as 15 ranches  
in a day in the region. ``You choose them, weigh them, mark them, 
and film them.'' 
</P>
<P>
	With the kidnapping risk running higher than ever as Colombia's  
insurgency escalates, many ranchers have stopped going to their 
properties altogether. 
</P>
<P>
	But an intrepid few can't stay away.  
</P>
<P>
	Saying he has ranching in his blood, Builes still travels  
occasionally to his 360-acre property in northern Sucre state, a 
battleground for the rebels and rightist paramilitary groups. 
</P>
<P>
	``I go, but I don't stay long,'' he said smiling broadly.

<HEADLINE> Penn State Stifles Buckeyes </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	STATE COLLEGE, Pa. (AP) -- The situation was strangely similar to  
the game-turning play of last year's showdown between Ohio State 
and Penn State. 
</P>
<P>
	With the Nittany Lions pinned deep in their territory, the  
Buckeyes sacked Kevin Thompson, forced a fumble, leapt on it for 
the touchdown and grabbed the momentum. 
</P>
<P>
	After that turn of events last October, the Lions quickly  
surrendered. 
</P>
<P>
	On Saturday, they didn't.  
</P>
<P>
	Unfazed, they went on to win 23-10, proving the point they've  
been trying to make all year: This isn't the same team that folded 
against Top 25 teams the past two seasons. 
</P>
<P>
	``I remember someone on the sideline saying, `We are not going  
to fall apart. We're a different team,''' said Penn State defensive 
lineman Justin Kurpeikis. 
</P>
<P>
	As their march toward the national title continues, No. 2 Penn  
State (7-0, 3-0 Big Ten) had better hope they're different than the 
last Lions team to start 7-0. In 1997, that group collapsed at the 
end to finish 9-3. 
</P>
<P>
	Pitfalls are possible: No. 16 Purdue is next, and No. 24  
Minnesota, No. 9 Michigan and No. 11 Michigan State await in 
November. 
</P>
<P>
	There's good news for these Lions: They have a stifling defense  
the 1997 Penn State team lacked. 
</P>
<P>
	``We made our minds up that we have to win a couple of these  
kind of games,'' coach Joe Paterno said. ``The defense came to 
town. Really, it would be tough to think they've played a better 
one.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ohio State managed 71 yards in the first half and 72 in the  
second, and the 143 yards of total offense was the least Penn State 
has surrendered since joining the Big Ten in 1993. 
</P>
<P>
	An offense averaging 399 yards per game got only 11 first downs  
and never found the end zone. Ohio State dropped to 4-3 overall, 
1-2 in the conference and No. 22 in the AP poll. 
</P>
<P>
	``You only get four against Ohio State. After what they've done  
to us, last year, and how they ruined a few seasons since I've been 
here, it feels great,'' Kurpeikis said, recalling losses to Ohio 
State in 1996 and 1998. 
</P>
<P>
	Penn State's victory started with blitzes. The Lions finished  
with eight sacks on Buckeyes quarterback Steve Bellisari. 
</P>
<P>
	``That's a big concern -- that he's back there taking so many  
beatings,'' said Ohio State receiver Reggie Germany. ``We just 
didn't have a lot of time today.'' 
</P>
<P>
	It got worse after the Buckeyes' defensive score pulled them  
within 13-10 at the end of the first half and threatened a repeat 
of 1998. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's no deja vu here,'' Lions linebacker Brandon Short told  
the team in the huddle. 
</P>
<P>
	He was right. Penn State's defense forced the Buckeyes to go  
three-and-out on their first three series of the second half. On 
the fourth series, James Boyd intercepted Bellisari. 
</P>
<P>
	``They're as good or better than advertised,'' Ohio State's John  
Cooper said.

<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- By the time Robin Ventura delivered his  
game-winning hit in Game 5 of the NL Championship Series on Sunday, 
Bobby Valentine and Bobby Cox had nearly run out of players. 
</P>
<P>
	An LCS record 45 players were used -- 23 by the Mets and 22 by  
the Braves -- as New York won 4-3 in 15 innings to close Atlanta's 
lead to 3-2 in the best-of-7 series. 
</P>
<P>
	Valentine used everyone but Al Leiter and Rick Reed, his  
starting pitchers the previous two nights. And if Ventura hadn't 
won the game in the 15th, Reed would have pitched the 16th inning. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't think there could have been more moves,'' Valentine  
said. ``It all started in the fourth inning and the game went 15. 
Every pitch was important, every play was important.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The only Braves that didn't see action were starters John  
Smoltz, Kevin Millwood and Tom Glavine, though Smoltz was in the 
on-deck circle as a possible pinch hitter at one point. 
</P>
<P>
	The previous record for players in an LCS game was 39, by San  
Diego and Atlanta in Game 5 last year. 
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	 *AILING BACK:* Roger Cedeno, who leads the Mets in batting in  
the NLCS, didn't start Game 5 because of back spasms, but ended up 
scoring the winning run. 
</P>
<P>
	Cedeno, who is 6-for-10 in the series, entered the game as a  
pinch runner in the 15th inning and scored on Robin Ventura's 
game-winning single. 
</P>
<P>
	Cedeno scored the tying run in Game 4 Saturday night on John  
Olerud's single. Melvin Mora, who started in Cedeno's place in 
right field, followed closely with the go-ahead run and leapt into 
Cedeno's arms after crossing home plate. 
</P>
<P>
	The Mets were uncertain when Cedeno injured himself.  
</P>
<P>
	``He's been bothered now for about the last week with recurring  
stiffness,'' manager Bobby Valentine said. ``But today he came in 
with a pretty severe spasm.'' 
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	 *LUCKY SUIT:* For Game 4, Mets general manager Steve Phillips  
wore the same suit he wore the day New York beat Cincinnati in the 
wild-card playoff. 
</P>
<P>
	Phillips, keeping up with the lucky suit theory, went with the  
outfit he wore Oct. 3, when the Mets beat Pittsburgh 2-1 on the 
final day of the season to force the one-game playoff. 
</P>
<P>
	The Mets played in their black uniform tops for the second  
straight game.

<HEADLINE> GOP Group Seeks Hispanic Backers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- No mas. No more, says Scott Reed -- a  
Republican presidential consultant tired of watching GOP 
politicians drive Hispanic voters to the Democratic Party. 
</P>
<P>
	So the strategist who managed Bob Dole's failed 1996  
presidential bid is launching a campaign of his own for 2000. The 
goal: show Republicans how to attract Hispanics. 
</P>
<P>
	``We can't leave this ground unattended,'' Reed said.  
</P>
<P>
	His new organization, the Republican Leadership Coalition, is  
spending $45,000 on radio ads on Hispanic stations in Florida, 
California, New Mexico and Texas. The spots, produced in Spanish, 
promote a Republican congressional plan that would give tax credits 
of up to $3,000 to insurance companies that provide policies to the 
uninsured. 
</P>
<P>
	``Fair-Care gives $3,000 a year, tax-free, so that every family  
can buy health insurance,'' an announcer says in the ads, which 
begin airing this week. ``With this, you can buy health insurance 
with any private company.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The coalition is pretty much a one-man operation that raises  
money to pay for political research and advertising focused on 
Hispanic voters. Reed hired a pollster to interview small groups of 
Hispanics to determine what issues most interest them. 
</P>
<P>
	Health care ``was off the charts,'' he said. Many of the  
Hispanics from California and Texas said they go to Mexico to get 
medical care. 
</P>
<P>
	Education, another top concern raised in the focus groups, will  
be the subject of the next batch of ads, Reed said. He plans 
follow-up research to document any effects the ads had on Hispanic 
listeners. 
</P>
<P>
	Reed is trying to bring Hispanics into the GOP with the ads, but  
his broader goal is to demonstrate to Republican leaders that the 
right message can draw voters from the nation's fastest-growing 
population bloc. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're committed to expanding the Republican majority coalition  
and we recognized the increasingly important role that minorities 
play with all these changing demographic trends at the national, 
state and local levels,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Republicans have alienated Hispanics with anti-immigration  
policies and rhetoric that makes them feel unwanted, Reed said. He 
eventually hopes to extend his effort to blacks and other 
minorities. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think if you look at the results of the elections in  
California last year, where we lost two statewide elections by huge 
margins and left the Republican Party in shambles, the answer is 
yes. We've hurt ourselves with Hispanics,'' he said. ``And if we 
don't do something about this and go back to talking about issues 
that people can understand we will become the minority party 
overnight.''

<HEADLINE> Stopping Dallas Starts With Emmitt </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	EAST RUTHERFORD, N.J. (AP) -- The New York Giants' defensive unit  
has enough to wonder about. Such as when the offense will start 
scoring. 
</P>
<P>
	Now the defense has something else to ponder -- the rejuvenation  
of Emmitt Smith. 
</P>
<P>
	The Dallas running back comes into Monday's night's game against  
the New York Giants leading the NFC in rushing with 409 yards. He 
also is tied for second overall in the league, just 14 yards behind 
Corey Dillon of the Cincinnati Bengals. 
</P>
<P>
	While Giants defensive line coach Denny Marcin has been in the  
league only three years, he insists Smith has gotten better the 
last few years. 
</P>
<P>
	``The first year we played them, I said: `Man, that's not the  
Emmitt Smith I saw on TV,'' the longtime college coach said. ``Last 
year, he turned it up and this year, to me, he looks like the best 
I've seen him. He's running hard, getting to the outside and making 
good cuts.'' 
</P>
<P>
	With receiver Michael Irvin sidelined indefinitely with a spinal  
injury, the Cowboys may need even more from Smith. He enters the 
game 25 yards shy of becoming the fourth NFL player to rush for 
13,000 yards in his career. 
</P>
<P>
	``I have confidence in the guys that are going to be in there,''  
Cowboys coach Chan Gailey said. ``But at the same time, anytime you 
lose a player of Michael's stature you lose something off your 
football team. It will have an impact. How much of an impact, 
remains to be seen.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Even if Irvin were playing, the Giants' approach would be to  
stop Smith first. 
</P>
<P>
	``They're not one-dimensional,'' safety Percy Ellsworth said.  
``We can hold Emmitt to 60-some-odd yards and still lose because 
Troy (Aikman) can throw for 300. 
</P>
<P>
	``But we have to at least get them to the point where we know  
they will pass and then see how we match up,'' Ellsworth added. 
``We're a solid group in the secondary, so if we can stop the run 
and force them to pass, we should have some success.'' 
</P>
<P>
	That's not always been the case. In the last six games against  
the Giants, Smith has carried 103 times for 415 yards and two 
touchdowns. That's a 69.2-yard average, 4.0 per carry. 
</P>
<P>
	What's even more interesting is that in Dallas' 16-6 win over  
the Giants last Nov. 8, Smith rushed for 163 yards. That means in 
the other five games against New York, he had only 252 yards 
combined, or 50 yards on average. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't think that we will allow Michael's injury to determine  
how we are going to approach the game offensively,'' Aikman said. 
``That is really the way we have done it for quite some time.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In the Cowboys' 31-7 win at Giants Stadium on a Monday night  
early last season, Deion Sanders scored on a punt return and an 
interception return. He also set up another TD with a 55-yard pass 
reception. 
</P>
<P>
	``They're still good,'' Giants All Pro defensive end Michael  
Strahan said. ``They're better with Michael Irvin, don't get me 
wrong. But without him, they are still a good offense. The key is 
stopping the running game and, with Dallas, that means Emmitt.'' 
</P>
<P>
	On the other hand, the Giants have struggled all season  
offensively, whether it's been with Kent Graham or Kerry Collins at 
quarterback. Graham will be back this week after missing last 
week's 14-3 loss to Arizona because of a concussion. 
</P>
<P>
	The loss triggered an offense vs. defense tiff for a day or so,  
but that dispute has subsided, for now. 
</P>
<P>
	``We need to win for the morale of the team,'' kicker Brad  
Daluiso said. ``That would help a lot. To get a win on national 
television against the Cowboys, it would do a lot for us.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But here's a bad statistic for Giants: Dallas is 6-0 in Monday  
night games against New York.

<HEADLINE> New Spine Injury Therapy Studied </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Rats recovered partially from spinal cord injury  
when they were treated quickly with a substance pumped out by 
immune-system cells, an indicator of a possible new therapy, 
researchers report. 
</P>
<P>
	While the rats were still impaired, the substance worked better  
than a drug currently given immediately after spinal cord injuries 
to promote recovery, said researcher W. Dalton Dietrich. 
</P>
<P>
	The substance, interleukin-10, might someday replace that  
standard drug, methylprednisolone, or be used in combination with 
it, he and colleagues suggest in the October issue of the Journal 
of Neurotrauma. 
</P>
<P>
	Dietrich is scientific director of the Miami Project to Cure  
Paralysis and professor of neurological surgery and neurology at 
the University of Miami School of Medicine. 
</P>
<P>
	Dr. Wise Young of Rutgers University, who didn't participate in  
the study, said he believed interleukin-10 could turn out to be a 
better therapy than the standard drug. It would be the first major 
advance in treating people who've just suffered spinal cord injury 
since methylprednisolone was shown to be effective in 1990, he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Interleukin-10 has been given to many people for bowel disorders  
and arthritis with no serious side effects, even at doses higher 
than the rats got, Dietrich said. Scientists might start testing 
its effect when given soon after human spinal cord injuries within 
the next year, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	It's not clear why interleukin-10 helped the rats. It does  
dampen inflammation, in which blood cells congregate and pump out 
potentially harmful substances, and inflammation is thought to 
damage the spinal cord after injury, Dietrich said. 
</P>
<P>
	In any case, interleukin-10 appears to help nerves survive a  
crushing injury, and the study found evidence that it also helps 
injured fibers regenerate, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	In the experiment, nine rats were injected in the leg with  
interleukin-10 a half-hour after their spinal cords were partially 
crushed. Nine others were given an inert injection. The treated 
rats showed better recovery starting two weeks later and extending 
to the end of the experiment, eight weeks after the injury. 
</P>
<P>
	The rats that got the inert injection were able to step with  
their hind legs, but only in an uncoordinated way. In the treated 
rats, the hind legs supported body weight better and showed much 
better coordination. 
</P>
<P>
	Scientists are now working with rats to see if interleukin-10 is  
still effective if given later than a half-hour after injury.

<HEADLINE> Confusion Over Final Mets Score </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- The umpires initially said the New York Mets  
beat the Atlanta Braves 5-3. NBC flashed a 7-3 score immediately 
after Robin Ventura's apparent grand slam. 
</P>
<P>
	Guess what? Neither was right.  
</P>
<P>
	The National League, official scorer Red Foley, and Elias Sports  
Bureau -- the only three voices that count -- all agreed that the 
Mets beat the Braves 4-3 in Game 5 of the NL Championship Series on 
Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	It was only befitting of a bizarre game like this that no one  
knew the score. 
</P>
<P>
	The confusion came with the score tied at 3 and the bases loaded  
in the 15th inning. Ventura hit a pitch from Kevin McGlinchy over 
the center-field fence to end the game. 
</P>
<P>
	While Roger Cedeno and John Olerud ran home from third and  
second base, Todd Pratt, who was on first, stopped somewhere around 
third base. Pratt ran toward second and embraced Ventura. 
</P>
<P>
	The rest of the Mets mobbed Ventura behind second base. After a  
few minutes, the umpires left the field and workers began picking 
up the bases. 
</P>
<P>
	About 10 minutes after the game ended, Foley ruled the score 4-3  
because Cedeno's run was the only one that mattered,and Ventura 
didn't touch home. 
</P>
<P>
	``The game ends in sudden death when the winning run scores,''  
said Elias spokesman Steve Hirdt, who according to the NL made the 
official ruling in conjunction with Foley. ``The only exception is 
on a home run, assuming the player rounds all the bases. (Ventura) 
never rounded the bases.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Crew chief Ed Montague initially told reporters after the game  
that the score was 5-3, because two runners crossed the plate 
before Ventura stopped rounding the bases. 
</P>
<P>
	He later told The Associated Press that home plate umpire Jerry  
Layne watched Cedeno touch home plate, then turned and walked away, 
because he was only looking for the winning run to score.

<HEADLINE> Brunell Leaves With Bruised Ribs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	JACKSONVILLE, Fla. (AP) -- Jacksonville Jaguars quarterback Mark  
Brunell left Sunday's game against the Cleveland Browns in the 
third quarter with bruised ribs. 
</P>
<P>
	Coach Tom Coughlin said Brunell took the first blow to the ribs  
sometime in the first half, then was knocked out of the game when 
he strained the ribs making a long throw down the sideline to start 
the third quarter. 
</P>
<P>
	Brunell returned to the sideline and threw for a brief period,  
but Coughlin said there was no way the quarterback would return to 
the game. 
</P>
<P>
	``He had difficulty twisting and turning and throwing the  
ball,'' Coughlin said. ``So we made the decision not to put him 
in.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Coughlin said he didn't yet know how serious the injury was.  
Brunell will have the luxury of the bye week as he begins his 
recovery. 
</P>
<P>
	The Jaguars also have the comfort of knowing that, yet again,  
they have a dependable backup quarterback. 
</P>
<P>
	Jay Fiedler led three scoring drives and finished 12-for-14 for  
113 yards and one touchdown in the 24-7 victory. He followed in the 
footsteps of other backups who have thrived for the Jaguars, 
including Rob Johnson, Steve Matthews and Jamie Martin, who is now 
a third-stringer for the Browns. 
</P>
<P>
	``We've been fortunate that we've had some young men who have  
been able to accomplish that, knowing full well they're not the 
starter, but having to understand everything,'' Coughlin said. ``He 
knew the game plan and he responded well.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Fiedler left the field with the fans chanting his name.  
</P>
<P>
	Undoubtedly, his solid performance will stir something of a  
quarterback controversy. Brunell entered the game with a 72.0 
quarterback rating and was struggling along with the rest of the 
Jaguars offense, which was ranked 20th in the league in passing. 
</P>
<P>
	``Mark is out starter right now,'' Fiedler said. ``Until coach  
Coughlin makes a change, that's the way it is.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Coughlin said no change was imminent.  
</P>

<HEADLINE> Strike Threat Looms for GM Canada </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DETROIT (AP) -- The Canadian Auto Workers will strike General  
Motors Corp. this week unless the company withdraws its proposal to 
outsource hundreds of jobs at five plants, union President Buzz 
Hargrove said. 
</P>
<P>
	The union's strike deadline is midnight Tuesday.  
</P>
<P>
	The automaker has reduced the number of jobs it wants to  
eliminate by shifting them to outside suppliers from more than 
1,000 to about 700, Hargrove said Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	But he said the CAW will not accept any outsourcing at a time  
when more than 1,500 workers are on layoff from GM's Canadian 
plants. 
</P>
<P>
	``There is not a chance we will agree to these outsourcing  
decisions,'' Hargrove told reporters at a news conference in 
Toronto. Unless GM withdraws the proposal, ``we'll have a strike,'' 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Stew Low, a spokesman for GM Canada, said the outsourcing is one  
of the issues still on the table. He said GM's investment plan 
``may require a minor degree of outsourcing.'' 
</P>
<P>
	During 1996 contract talks, the CAW struck GM's Oshawa, Ontario,  
assembly plant, idling some U.S. parts and assembly plants. 
</P>
<P>
	Other aspects of the contract with GM are expected to closely  
model agreements already reached with Ford Motor Co. and 
DaimlerChrysler AG. 
</P>
<P>
	Those call for a 3 percent wage increase in each year of a  
three-year package, a $1,000 (Canadian) signing bonus, an improved 
retirement package and other benefits. 
</P>
<P>
	Hargrove said in July that the future of the St. Therese,  
Ontario, plant and GM plans to outsource work would be key issues 
in this year's negotiations. 
</P>
<P>
	GM has said it will cease production of Chevrolet Cameros and  
Pontiac Firebirds at St. Therese in September 2002, and nothing is 
scheduled to replace that line, Hargrove said. 
</P>
<P>
	The union is willing to consider modular assembly proposals for  
St. Therese as part of a plan to keep the plant open, Hargrove 
said. Modular assembly involves suppliers assembling many 
components into modules -- such as a complete dashboard -- that are 
then put into the vehicle at assembly plants. 
</P>
<P>
	So far, GM has not budged on its plan to close the plant, he  
said. 
</P>
<P>
	A strike would be expected to have some effect on U.S. plants  
that provide parts for GM's Canadian assembly plants and on U.S. 
assembly plants that use parts made by GM in Canada.

<HEADLINE> Lawsuit Filed Over 'Rat Pack' Show </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LAS VEGAS (AP) -- Sammy Davis Jr.'s widow has sued a hotel over a  
lounge show featuring impersonations of her late husband and other 
members of ``The Rat Pack.'' 
</P>
<P>
	According to Altovise Davis' federal lawsuit, the Desert Inn has  
wrongfully used her husband's name, identity and persona in its 
advertising for ``The Rat Pack Is Back'' show. 
</P>
<P>
	The lawsuit, filed Friday, comes more than a month after the  
hotel was sued by Sheffield Enterprises, a licensing company owned 
by Frank Sinatra's children. 
</P>
<P>
	Resort spokeswoman Caroline Coyle said the show will go on.  
</P>
<P>
	``The Desert Inn believes its actions in hosting 'The Rat Pack  
Is Back' lounge show are completely lawful,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	The show features performers who impersonate Rat Pack members  
Dean Martin and Joey Bishop in addition to Davis and Sinatra. 
Sinatra died in May 1998, Martin in 1995, and Davis in 1990.

</P>
<P>
	WILMINGTON, N.C. (AP) -- A flash flood warning was issued for a  
100-mile-by-50-mile swath of eastern North Carolina straddling 
Interstate 95 between Fayetteville and Rocky Mount as Hurricane 
Irene drenched the state in the southeast with nearly half a foot 
of rain today. Gale-force winds were measured at the coast, and a 
tornado was reported by radar over Jacksonville on Sunday morning. 
No injuries were reported. At 8 p.m. EDT, Irene was located near 
latitude 33.3 north and longitude 77.8 west.

deliberately given lethal injections at a western Indiana hospital. 
Jurors hearing the case of Orville Lynn Majors told the judge they

	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The United States today praised Gen. Pervaiz  
Musharraf for pledging to return Pakistan to democratic rule but 
expressed disappointment that the military leader offered no 
timetable for that transition. U.S. officials said they were 
pleased by several points Musharraf made in an address Sunday, his 
first public appearance since announcing last week that he had 
ousted Pakistan's civilian government. They cited his references to 
reducing the military presence at the border with India.

fighting. The Russian commander in Chechnya, Col. Gen. Viktor 
Kazantsev, said Sunday his forces had taken a strategic ridge 20

	CLEVELAND (AP) -- The son of Dr. Sam Sheppard completed a  
400-mile walk on Sunday that he started a month ago with the aim of 
preparing himself for trial of his wrongful imprisonment lawsuit 
against the state of Ohio. Dr. Sheppard spent a decade in jail for 
the 1954 beating death of his wife, Marilyn, before a second jury 
acquitted him in a retrial. The sensational trial inspired a movie 
and ``The Fugitive'' television series. His son, Sam Reese 
Sheppard, has been trying to clear his father's name and hold state 
officials responsible for what he calls a miscarriage of justice.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Mulls Puerto Rico Bomb Range </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	VIEQUES, Puerto Rico (AP) -- Lightning flashes overhead and a  
hard rain falls as salsa singer Willie Colon joins protesters 
camping amid the craters on the U.S. Navy's beachfront bombing 
range. 
</P>
<P>
	The surreal stream of celebrities, politicians, clerics,  
athletes and fishermen who occupy the bomb-pocked campsites 
underscores the political quagmire facing President Clinton: Should 
he evict the protesters -- as the military demands -- and risk 
widespread civil disobedience in Puerto Rico? 
</P>
<P>
	On Tuesday, the U.S. Senate's Armed Services Committee will hear  
from Navy Secretary Richard Danzig, who wants bombing practice to 
resume, and Puerto Rico Gov. Pedro Rossello, who adamantly opposes 
it. 
</P>
<P>
	Like few other issues before it, the campaign to boot the Navy  
from the outlying island of Vieques has galvanized Puerto Rican 
nationalism and attracted politicians of all persuasions -- even 
those, like Rossello, who want to make this Spanish-speaking U.S. 
territory the 51st state of the union. 
</P>
<P>
	And it has given Independence Party chief Ruben Berrios, the  
protest leader, a platform far greater than the 3 percent showing 
his cause received in last December's plebiscite on statehood. 
</P>
<P>
	Defying repeated warnings from the Navy, protesters have  
occupied the range since David Sanes Rodriguez, a civilian security 
guard, was killed in a bombing accident April 19. 
</P>
<P>
	For many, that was the last straw in an on-again, off-again  
campaign to get the Navy off Vieques, a 20-mile-long island 
inhabited by 9,300 civilians. Bombing was halted after the 
accident, and Clinton is awaiting a Pentagon report on possible 
alternatives before deciding the issue. 
</P>
<P>
	The civilian occupation of the range ``is the ultimate  
expression of a people in a desperate state,'' Colon said. So 
desperate, some fear, that widespread civil disobedience -- even 
violence -- could ensue if Clinton doesn't hand over the Navy range 
to Puerto Rico. 
</P>
<P>
	Protesters have erected five tent camps along the white beaches  
of the range, located 10 miles from the island's main town, Isabel 
II. It is littered with bombs and artillery shells, water-filled 
craters, rusted scrap, charred tree bark -- the detritus of 
live-fire military exercises since World War II. 
</P>
<P>
	Skeleton crews run the camps during the week. The numbers swell  
into the hundreds on weekends, when families and friends come by 
boat, bringing food, drink and music. 
</P>
<P>
	The issue has dominated news media and street talk for months,  
and the chorus of indignation has drowned out those concerned about 
the consequences of rebellion for Puerto Rico, whose 4 million 
people have U.S. citizenship and get $11 billion annually in 
federal funds. 
</P>
<P>
	The Navy insists Vieques is vital to national security as the  
only place where East Coast fleets can train in simultaneous air, 
land and sea operations. It has been used to prepare for every U.S. 
conflict since Vietnam. 
</P>
<P>
	Losing Vieques could mean losing lives at war -- a risk not  
acceptable to the American public in this era of precision bombing, 
the Navy says. It also notes that Sanes Rodriguez's death was the 
first at the range in more than 50 years. 
</P>
<P>
	In an Oct. 13 meeting with Hispanic members of Congress, Clinton  
``expressed real concern for both the Puerto Rican perspective, but 
also the military readiness issues,'' said Maria Echaveste, a 
deputy chief of staff. 
</P>
<P>
	``We really solicited their viewpoint, their assistance, and  
acknowledged that some dignity needs to be restored to the 
relationship with the Puerto Ricans,'' Echaveste said. 
</P>
<P>
	Berrios, the independence activist, said he thinks Clinton's  
``heart is in the right place.'' But some protesters wonder if 
Clinton will risk alienating the Pentagon's supporters only weeks 
after his controversial pardon of Puerto Rican nationalists 
convicted of sedition. 
</P>
<P>
	Despite the ruins of the range, Vieques' eastern tip is hallowed  
ground for many local residents whose grandparents were bought out 
by the Navy in 1941. 
</P>
<P>
	The Navy acquired roughly two-thirds of Vieques -- land for a  
munitions dump on the western end and land for the bombing range on 
the eastern half. Vieques' civilians are sandwiched in between. 
</P>
<P>
	For years, they've complained about shaking windows and  
frightened schoolchildren, about high cancer rates and the use of 
napalm, about fisheries off limits to their fishing fleet. Recently 
the Navy admitted that it had mistakenly fired bullets tipped with 
depleted uranium in violation of federal laws and that it dropped 
napalm in 1993. 
</P>
<P>
	Prospects for a compromise seem slim. Puerto Rico's leaders have  
criticized a leaked proposal to allow the Navy five years before a 
pullout. And the Navy, for its part, says it cannot find another 
Atlantic range.

<HEADLINE> Eagles 20, Bears 16 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- It took a career half from Doug Pederson to give  
the Philadelphia Eagles their first win in 20 road games since Dec. 
14, 1996. 
</P>
<P>
	Pederson, playing like another quarterback Eagles coach Andy  
Reid tutored in Green Bay, had career highs in completions (16), 
yards passing (207) and longest pass (57 yards) by halftime Sunday, 
and the Eagles hung on for the 20-16 victory over the Chicago 
Bears. 
</P>
<P>
	Cade McNown, making his first NFL start in place of the injured  
Shane Matthews, threw an 80-yard touchdown pass, and Chris Boniol 
kicked a 41-yard field goal in the second half, but the Bears (3-3) 
came up empty in two other trips inside the Eagles 31. 
</P>
<P>
	The victory gives Philadelphia (2-4), which beat Dallas last  
week, a winning streak for the first time since 1997. It also is 
the Eagles' first victory ever at Soldier Field, and just their 
second win over Chicago since 1980. 
</P>
<P>
	Philadelphia, 0-18-1 since beating the New York Jets 21-20  
almost three years ago, looked right at home in the first half. 
After going three-and-out on their first series, the Eagles scored 
on their next four possessions. 
</P>
<P>
	Everything seemed to go their way, with the second series  
symbolizing the half. After two Eagles were called for pass 
interference, giving them second-and-20 from their own 36, Pederson 
hit Torrance Small for a 7-yard gain. 
</P>
<P>
	On the next play, Pederson and Dietrich Jells connected for a  
57-yard score, the Eagles' longest play from scrimmage this season. 
It also was a career-long for Pederson, topping his 36-yard pass to 
Charles Johnson last weekend. 
</P>
<P>
	Pederson also threw a 3-yard TD pass to Luther Broughton, and  
Norm Johnson kicked field goals of 28 and 27 yards. 
</P>
<P>
	Pederson finished 32-of-38 for 228 yards. Duce Staley rushed for  
101 yards on 23 carries. 
</P>
<P>
	The Bears, who had fans talking playoffs after upsetting the  
Minnesota Vikings at the Metrodome last weekend, reverted to their 
bumbling ways of last year. The defense was practically helpless in 
the first half and the offense was out of synch all game. 
</P>
<P>
	Chicago fans had no idea when the season began how much they'd  
miss Matthews. Though McNown played at least one series in each of 
the first five games, he looked shaky in his first start. 
</P>
<P>
	He threw two interceptions in the first half, with the first  
setting up a Philadelphia field goal. It didn't help that he was 
playing without leading receiver Curtis Conway, who was out with a 
sprained ankle. 
</P>
<P>
	He looked sharper in the second half, finding Marcus Robinson  
for the 80-yard score on his second play of the third quarter. But 
he couldn't find the end zone again, getting sacked for a loss at 
the Eagles 31 and throwing an incompletion on fourth-and-3 from the 
Eagles 30. 
</P>
<P>
	McNown finished 17-of-33 for 255 yards.

<HEADLINE> Bush Sets Record for Fund Raising </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
                      *Associated Press Writer-    	
</P>
<P>
	SEATTLE (AP) -- The Seattle Mariners' bats have been silent for  
days at Safeco Field, but Republican presidential front-runner 
George W. Bush hit the political equivalent of a grand slam 
Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
	The Texas governor, whose campaign treasury is closing in on the  
$60 million mark, a record, lent his starpower and fund-raising 
prowess to Sen. Slade Gorton, the state GOP and the National 
Republican Senatorial Committee. 
</P>
<P>
	The event, the first political event staged in America's newest  
and most expensive ballpark, raised more than $400,000, the largest 
single fund-raising event in Washington state history. 
</P>
<P>
	Bush's senior advisers said it's part of a new strategy of  
cementing his relations with congressional incumbents -- the very 
ones he has criticized generically in recent days -- and with GOP 
organizations in key battleground states. 
</P>
<P>
	``I like to help my friends,'' Bush said in an interview.  
</P>
<P>
	Aides said Bush has been swamped for months with requests and  
that after the bulk of his own fund-raising was completed, the 
governor decided to work in some of the events. 
</P>
<P>
	As the Iowa caucuses and New Hampshire primary draw nearer, he  
will have to concentrate on his own race more, his political 
strategists said Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
	``There is a benefit for me to do this,'' Bush said. ``It will  
help me a lot, if I am elected president, to have my friends in the 
House and in the Senate and in governors' mansions all across this 
great land. I'm asked a lot (to do campaign appearances and 
fund-raising), and I will do what I can.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Republicans haven't carried Washington in the past three  
presidential elections. Bush's father, former President George 
Bush, lost the state in both 1988 and 1992. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's just about time to break that streak,'' Bush told about  
400 people at the Safeco Field event. He told reporters he thinks 
his platform -- including education, free trade, a strong military 
and sensible environmental controls -- will resonate with Washington 
voters. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a little early to tell what the dynamics are going to be  
for the general election, but my political antennae tell me I have 
a good chance. There is a certain disgruntlement with the status 
quo. 
</P>
<P>
	Bush fans paid $1,000 and up to dine on salmon, salad and wine,  
and hear speeches from Bush and Gorton. It was called a ``grand 
slam'' event -- and the setting was appropriate. 
</P>
<P>
	Tables, set up on the outfield, were covered with linen  
tablecloths, china and pots of flowers. The speeches were broadcast 
on giant screens on the Mariners' scoreboard.

<HEADLINE> Missed Chances Doom Braves </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- For the Atlanta Braves, Sunday's Game 5 of the  
National League Championship Series was a frustrating string of 
missed opportunities, 15 innings of aggravation. 
</P>
<P>
	They loaded the bases in consecutive innings, both times without  
benefit of a base hit, and failed to score each time in a game they 
lost 4-3 to the New York Mets after taking the lead in the top half 
of the 15th and needing just three outs to reach the World Series. 
</P>
<P>
	This was a game the Braves should have won earlier and thought  
they had finally won despite having a runner thrown out at the 
plate and leaving a record 19 runners on base. 
</P>
<P>
	Even in the inning they scored their first two runs, they came  
away with less than they might have. 
</P>
<P>
	The bases-loaded situations might have been turning points if  
Atlanta had not wasted so many other chances. Perhaps the most 
painful came in the 13th inning when Keith Lockhart singled with 
two out and tried to score from first on Chipper Jones' two-out 
double. He was thrown out by at least 10 feet. 
</P>
<P>
	Batting just .198 in the first four games of the series, the  
Braves had one brief breakthrough, stringing consecutive doubles by 
Bret Boone and Jones and a single by Brian Jordan to tie the score 
2-2 in the fourth. 
</P>
<P>
	When Ryan Klesko walked, there were two on and no outs. But Orel  
Hershiser came out of the Mets bullpen to strike out Andruw Jones 
and Eddie Perez and get Walt Weiss on a roller to first base. 
</P>
<P>
	For the next 10 innings, the Braves had plenty of chances but  
couldn't score. 
</P>
<P>
	Atlanta left two runners on base in the fifth, wasting Gerald  
Williams' double. But the Braves' best chances came in the sixth 
and seventh, even though they never got a hit in either inning. 
</P>
<P>
	After Klesko, leading off, reached on an error by John Olerud,  
he was bunted to second. After walking Perez intentionally, 
Hershiser then walked Weiss unintentionally to load the bases. With 
pitcher Greg Maddux at bat, manager Bobby Cox put on the squeeze, 
despite a two-strike count. Maddux missed the bunt for strike three 
and Klesko had no chance coming down the line and was tagged out to 
end the inning. 
</P>
<P>
	An inning later, the Braves were back, knocking on the door  
again. 
</P>
<P>
	Boone was hit by a pitch with one out and Turk Wendell came on  
to strike out Chipper Jones. Boone stole second on the third strike 
and Jordan was walked intentionally, the first two balls thrown by 
Wendell, the last two by Dennis Cook, brought in to force Cox to 
pinch hit for Klesko. 
</P>
<P>
	When righty swinging Brian Hunter came to bat, Pat Mahones  
relieved for New York but walked the pinch hitter, loading the 
bases again. Then he got Andruw Jones on a fly ball, ending the 
threat. 
</P>
<P>
	It was like that all night for Atlanta. The Braves wasted a  
leadoff double by Perez in the third inning and one-out doubles by 
Williams in the fifth and Weiss in the eighth. In the 10th, Perez 
opened with a single and pinch-runner Howard Battle stole second, 
but Atlanta couldn't get the run home. 
</P>
<P>
	Finally, in the 15th, a triple by Lockhart drove in the go-ahead  
run. But the Mets weren't done. 
</P>
<P>
	When Robin Ventura delivered the winning hit, the Braves ran out  
of chances and now they won't get anymore until Tuesday when the 
series returns to Atlanta for Game 6.

<HEADLINE> Flames Blaze Across Northern Calif. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BELLA VISTA, Calif. (AP) -- Fires burned out of control across  
thousands of acres of brush and grass on Sunday in Northern 
California, where the blazes have destroyed scores of homes and 
forced thousands of people to evacuate. 
</P>
<P>
	Winds moderated in the afternoon and some of those forced on  
Saturday to flee a 25,900-acre fire in Shasta County were allowed 
to return to see if they still had homes. More than 100 structures 
were destroyed. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's people calling who I've known for 20 years, calling to  
see if their houses are okay,'' said volunteer Fire Capt. Jan 
Gross. ``I don't have the heart to tell them they've lost it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Karen Jane Savage, 44, a volunteer firefighter from Junction  
City, Calif., died after she was hit by a fire truck near the 
blaze, said Rose Wyckoff of the California Department of Forestry. 
</P>
<P>
	The fire was 20 percent contained Sunday, and full containment  
was expected by late Monday, Wyckoff said. Some 2,000 people were 
fighting the blaze. 
</P>
<P>
	Dozens of homes were destroyed Saturday by the fast-moving fire,  
which began at 4:15 a.m., fanned by winds gusting to 25 mph. The 
loss by Sunday was estimated at $5 million. 
</P>
<P>
	Exact numbers of homes destroyed would likely not be available  
until the flames were extinguished, fire officials said. 
</P>
<P>
	A fire about 50 miles northwest of Sacramento that started  
Saturday had burned more than 42,000 acres by Sunday morning. One 
home was lost, and some 430 firefighters, along with a dozen 
bulldozers, five helicopters and six air tankers, were fighting to 
keep the flames away from other homes in a vacation area near Lake 
Berryessa. 
</P>
<P>
	In Yuba County, about 50 miles north of Sacramento, a fire  
charred 5,500 acres and threatened about 500 structures in the 
Dobbins and Challenge areas, which were evacuated Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	In Trinity County, a fire that began two months ago has so far  
burned 111,000 acres. 
</P>
<P>
	Along the central coast, meanwhile, two fires in the Los Padres  
National Forest continued to burn after scorching more than 85,000 
acres.

<HEADLINE> Group Calls Low-Carb Diet Unhealthy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ATLANTA (AP) -- On a typical morning, Ron Glasgow eats a  
three-egg omelet and a 12-ounce package of bacon or a half-pound of 
ham. For the rest of the day, he can eat all the pork rinds, beef 
jerky, sausage and steak he wants. 
</P>
<P>
	After 11 months on this diet, he's gone from 425 to 330 pounds.  
</P>
<P>
	Glasgow and others claim to have shed stubborn fat by laying off  
carbohydrates and sugars. They stick to a menu of unlimited meat, 
cheese and eggs -- no sweets, rice, pasta or bread. 
</P>
<P>
	Many dietitians and health experts, 10,000 of whom will be in  
Atlanta this week for the American Dietetic Association's annual 
meeting, say the diet is an unhealthy fad and the weight loss is 
temporary. 
</P>
<P>
	The high-protein, no-carb plan is ``a nightmare of a diet,''  
said Kathleen Zelman, a registered dietitian and ADA spokeswoman. 
``At first, it sounds so alluring. You get the green light to eat 
these foods.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But she said the monotony soon gets old. Sure, you get the  
hamburger, but no bun or fries. You can eat a big steak, but forget 
the baked potato and tossed salad. 
</P>
<P>
	Plus, it's just unhealthy, nutritionists say. Along with the  
risk of increasing cholesterol levels, the diet could cause kidney 
problems or possibly a loss of calcium in the bones, Ms. Zelman 
said. Limiting the intake of carbohydrates to such a dramatically 
low level starves the body of needed nutrients and it causes an 
artificial metabolic state. 
</P>
<P>
	``Think of it on a global perspective -- the world at large  
survives on grains,'' Ms. Zelman said. ``If we didn't have 
carbohydrates, we would not be able to survive. Bread is the staff 
of life.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The low-carb diet was first touted by Dr. Robert Atkins more  
than 20 years ago. Its popularity in the '90s has been attributed 
to his latest book ``Dr. Atkins' New Diet Revolution,'' currently 
the best-selling mass market paperback in the country. 
</P>
<P>
	Glasgow, a 39-year-old computer support technician from Cumming,  
said the diet allows him to lose weight and continue to be a ``big 
eater.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm aware of some of the opponents, but for me right now, it  
seems to be working,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Glasgow said he lost 100 pounds once before on a low-fat, high  
exercise diet. He took a two-month leave of absence from his job 
and exercised 6 to 8 hours a day. But when he switched to a more 
reasonable schedule, the weight stopped coming off and he went back 
to his old ways. 
</P>
<P>
	With studies showing exercise at an all-time low and more than  
half of all adults overweight, Americans are constantly searching 
for a way to slim down without drastically changing their 
lifestyles. 
</P>
<P>
	The increasing number of unhealthy and overweight adults and  
children is a particularly troubling issue the ADA will discuss at 
its four-day meeting, which starts Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	The group will also discuss food safety, children's health and  
reducing the risks of heart disease and colon cancer through diet. 
</P>
<P>
	Like other health organizations, the ADA maintains the only way  
to lose weight is through a healthy, well-balanced diet and 
exercise. 
</P>
<P>
	Atkins has dismissed criticism of his diet as ``dietitian talk''  
and points out that many people have maintained their weight loss 
for years and lowered their cholesterol by following his plan. 
</P>
<P>
	Glasgow and others who've lost weight on the plan will probably  
gain it back, Ms. Zelman says. The initial weight loss occurs 
because, without carbohydrates, the body is forced to burn fat and 
protein for fuel -- but that creates fatigue. Also, the monotony of 
the diet gets some people to eat less. 
</P>
<P>
	Sooner or later, the dieter will have to go back to at least  
moderate carbohydrate consumption. When they do, the weight will 
likely return. 
</P>
<P>
	Her advice for anyone who considers going on the diet is to  
consult their doctor, drink plenty of fluids and take a 
multivitamin, mineral supplement. 
</P>
<P>
	``Realize it's a short-term fix,'' she said. ``Ultimately, you  
will have to face reality of weight management.''

<HEADLINE> Crew 2, Mutiny 0 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	COLUMBUS, Ohio (AP) -- Stern John scored two goals in a  
seven-minute span Sunday and the Columbus Crew beat the Tampa Bay 
Mutiny 2-0 in the first game of the best-of-3 MLS Eastern 
Conference semifinals. 
</P>
<P>
	John's first goal came in the 77th minute on an assist from  
Brian West, who had kicked it toward Brian McBride. The ball landed 
at McBride's feet, but he never touched it as John scored from 12 
yards, beating Mutiny goalkeeper Scott Garlick on the left side. 
Garlick got a hand on the ball but wasn't able to deflect it away 
from the goal. 
</P>
<P>
	John, whose 18 goals in the regular season tied him for the  
league lead, used the bottom of his foot to re-direct a free kick 
by Robert Warzycha past Garlick in the 84th minute. 
</P>
<P>
	The teams play again Friday in Tampa Bay, with a third game, if  
necessary, in Columbus on Oct. 27. The winner of the series plays 
either D.C. United or Miami in the conference finals. 
</P>
<P>
	Tampa Bay had an 11-5 advantage in total shots in the second  
half and led 17-13 in that category, but Columbus had a 5-2 lead in 
shots on goal. The Mutiny also committed 22 fouls, compared with 
eight for the Crew. 
</P>
<P>
	Columbus, which finished second in the Eastern Conference, had  
lost three straight regular season games to third-place Tampa Bay 
after winning the first game between the teams in April.

<HEADLINE> Spina Bifida Procedure Publicized </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NASHVILLE, Tenn. (AP) -- Drs. Joseph Bruner and Noel Tulipan have  
received accolades for their pioneering method of treating spina 
bifida in the womb but have gotten chilly reviews in some medical 
circles for their method of publicizing it. 
</P>
<P>
	Rather than waiting months or years for their procedure to be  
reviewed by peers and published in a medical journal, the 
Vanderbilt University Medical Center doctors took their story 
straight to the media. Soon, stories about them, their procedure 
and their patients started showing up in newspapers and magazines, 
and on television shows around the country. 
</P>
<P>
	Then came e-mails and phone calls from doctors criticizing them  
as media hounds more interested in self-promotion than sound 
science. 
</P>
<P>
	``We felt it was important for the public to know we were  
performing a new and innovative procedure on unborn babies,'' 
Bruner said. ``The public has a right to know about that, and we 
wanted to work with news organizations to let the public know as 
much as we could.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Though the procedure is yielding good initial results, some  
physicians are uncomfortable with the doctors going public before 
their work was reviewed by peers. 
</P>
<P>
	Among them is Dr. N. Scott Adzick, director of the Center for  
Fetal Diagnosis at Children's Hospital in Philadelphia and the only 
other doctor using a similar technique to treat spina bifida. 
``Folks can make claims about everything, and I don't think the lay 
process is the place to ferret that out,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	``My approach would not be to have reporters follow families  
through the process or have TV crews following families through the 
process because these are very vulnerable families now.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A bitter rivalry developed between Adzick and the Vanderbilt  
doctors last November when he published the results of his work in 
The Lancet, a British medical journal, and called his procedure the 
first of its kind. 
</P>
<P>
	The Vanderbilt doctors sent an angry letter to the journal  
saying they were the first, and Adzick responded by criticizing the 
doctors for using the mass media to publicize their work. 
</P>
<P>
	The acrimony has ended, both sides say, and the doctors now  
refer patients to each other. 
</P>
<P>
	Spina bifida is the nation's most common permanently disabling  
birth defect, affecting about one of every 1,000 births. It occurs 
when the skin fails to properly close over the spinal cord early in 
the pregnancy and may result in excess fluid on the brain, bowel 
and bladder problems, clubbed feet, partial paralysis and learning 
difficulties. 
</P>
<P>
	Traditionally, doctors have tried to limit its effects by  
closing the spinal cord in the first 24 hours after birth. In the 
procedure done by Bruner and Tulipan, doctors operate while the 
baby is in the womb, between 20 weeks and 28 weeks after 
conception. 
</P>
<P>
	The surgeons place the uterus on the mother's belly, pull the  
fetus out through an incision, locate the spinal cord and close 
tissue over the exposed area. The fetus is then returned to the 
womb and allowed to develop until the mother gives birth. 
</P>
<P>
	The doctors have performed about 60 operations. In about half,  
their patients have avoided the shunts almost all spina bifida 
patients need to drain fluid from the brain for the rest of their 
lives. Though it is too early to tell, Bruner and Tulipan are 
hopeful the surgery will improve brain function, too. 
</P>
<P>
	When Bruner and Tulipan began doing the procedure in April 1997,  
they planned to wait and see the results of 10 cases before they 
went public with their findings. 
</P>
<P>
	But their initial patients were so pleased they contacted media  
in their hometowns to try to raise money to help other parents get 
the procedure, which at the time was not covered by insurance. The 
doctors cooperated with the reporters. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't think that we really had a concept at the time how  
this would really capture the public imagination and how tremendous 
of an advance the public would perceive this as,'' Bruner said. 
</P>
<P>
	While the public wanted to learn about the procedure, medical  
journals were not eager to provide a forum. The New England Journal 
of Medicine rejected a paper on their technique because the results 
already had appeared on the hospital Web site. 
</P>
<P>
	Medical journals want doctors to follow tradition, presenting  
their work to their colleagues for review before any word of it is 
published. 
</P>
<P>
	When doctors go to the public without having their work verified  
and scrutinized by other doctors, ``the risk of harm (to the 
public) may actually outweigh the benefits,'' said Dr. Richard 
Glass, an interim co-editor of the Journal of the American Medical 
Association. 
</P>
<P>
	Since their paper was rejected, Bruner said, he and Tulipan have  
become more reluctant about sharing their results to prevent 
themselves from being barred by other publications. That puts them 
in a bind. As they perform more surgeries, they have more results 
to share. 
</P>
<P>
	``We now know, for example, that there are some babies that have  
better outcomes than others. There are some babies that will 
benefit tremendously from this and there are others that won't 
benefit so much,'' Bruner said. 
</P>
<P>
	``We think this is important information to get out to the  
public. Unfortunately, the turnaround time for journals is 
somewhere between one to two years. By the time the information 
that we've already submitted to journals gets published, it's going 
to be out of date. And by the time we send them new information, 
it'll be another year or two years to get it published. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's very frustrating to have information that we know is  
important for the public and that we know patients need in order to 
make reasonable decisions.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The need for speed is not lost on medical journals. The Journal  
of the American Medical Society announced in May a new ``JAMA 
Express'' process to rush information deemed critical into 
publication within six weeks, up from an average of five months. 
</P>
<P>
	Extremely critical articles can be published much faster on the  
journal's Web site. In June 1998, JAMA posted a report about a 
potentially fatal pairing of two drugs used to treat high blood 
pressure. The report hit the Web three days after it was accepted. 
</P>
<P>
	``Those things have to be considered very carefully,'' Glass  
said. ``Everybody would like things to go fast, and it's just not 
possible for everything to go that fast.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Adzick said while things move faster now, it's important for the  
peer review process to continue to ensure credibility. Tulipan 
agreed. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't think the lay press or the public is qualified to  
decide whether a procedure is effective or not,'' Tulipan said. 
Peer review is ``still the gold standard. It's still the 
benchmark.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Still, Bruner has few regrets about the methods he and Tulipan  
used. 
</P>
<P>
	``Looking back over the past few years, I can't see it happening  
any differently,'' he said. ``The only way it could have been 
different is if we refused to talk to the media altogether, and 
that would have been unfair. 
</P>
<P>
	``Back in the '50s and '60s, a lot of human experiments were  
done that were kept secret from the public and when the public 
found out, they were always upset. So we weren't going to hide what 
we were doing.''

<HEADLINE> Maple Leafs 2, Blackhawks 1 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- Jonas Hoglund and Yanic Perreault each scored a  
goal, while Glenn Healy stopped 25 of 26 shots as the Toronto Maple 
Leafs held on for a 2-1 win over the Chicago Blackhawks on Friday 
night. 
</P>
<P>
	Josef Marha's power-play goal with 7:05 remaining in the third  
period spoiled Healy's bid for a 12th career NHL shutout. But even 
though the Blackhawks came on to test the Toronto goaltender in the 
game's final minutes, Chicago remained winless at 0-3-2-0. 
</P>
<P>
	Toronto, skating without injured star center Mats Sundin,  
improved to 5-2-0-0. 
</P>
<P>
	Healy, a back-up netminder to Curtis Joseph, was making only his  
second start of the season. 
</P>
<P>
	Hoglund's deflection during a Toronto power play at 12:44 of the  
first period opened the scoring. Stationed in the slot, he 
redirected Alexander Karpovtsev's shot from the right point past 
Chicago goaltender Jocelyn Thibault. 
</P>
<P>
	Perreault converted a two-on-one break with Hoglund at 16:07 of  
the second period to extend the Maple Leafs' lead to 2-0. Carrying 
the puck down right wing, Perreault faked a pass to Hoglund, then 
fired himself and beat Thibault with a high, glove-side shot. 
</P>
<P>
	Marha ruined Healy's shutout bid during a Chicago power play  
with 7:05 left in regulation. Marha's shot, the Blackhawks' 22nd 
shot on goal of the game, from the right circle deflected off 
Toronto defenseman Cory Cross and sailed over Healy's glove.

<HEADLINE> Details of Military Poll </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	The Associated Press poll on the military is based on telephone  
interviews with 1,011 randomly selected adults from all states 
except Alaska and Hawaii. The interviews were conducted Sept. 17-24 
by ICR of Media, Pa. 
</P>
<P>
	The results were weighted to represent the population by  
demographic factors such as age, sex, region and education. 
</P>
<P>
	No more than one time in 20 should chance variations in the  
sample cause the results to vary by more than 3 percentage points 
from the answers that would be obtained if all Americans were 
polled. 
</P>
<P>
	This margin of sampling error is larger for responses of  
subgroups, such as income categories. There are other sources of 
potential error in polls, including the wording and order of 
questions. 
</P>
<P>
	The poll's questions:  
</P>
<P>
	1. Do you think federal spending on military and defense  
programs should be increased, decreased or kept about the same? 
</P>
<P>
	--increased, 34 percent  
</P>
<P>
	--decreased, 12 percent  
</P>
<P>
	--kept about the same, 47 percent  
</P>
<P>
	--don't know, 7 percent  
</P>
<P>
	--refused, 1 percent  

</P>
<P>
	2. As you may have heard, Congress is considering a pay increase  
for those who serve in the U.S. military. Do you support or oppose 
raising their pay? 
</P>
<P>
	--support, 78 percent  
</P>
<P>
	--oppose, 13 percent  
</P>
<P>
	--don't know, 9 percent  

</P>
<P>
	3. If you had a son or daughter who was planning to enter the  
military, would you support that step or would you suggest a 
different occupation? 
</P>
<P>
	--would support entering military, 66 percent  
</P>
<P>
	--suggest a different occupation, 29 percent  
</P>
<P>
	--don't know, 5 percent  

</P>
<P>
	4. How much confidence do you have in America's armed forces? Do  
you have a good deal of confidence, some confidence, very little 
confidence or no confidence at all? 
</P>
<P>
	--good deal of confidence, 64 percent  
</P>
<P>
	--some confidence, 28 percent

</P>
<P>
	--don't know, 1 percent  

</P>
<P>
	5. Do you support or oppose using U.S. troops as peacekeepers in  
such places as Bosnia or East Timor? 
</P>
<P>
	--support, 49 percent  
</P>
<P>
	--oppose, 42 percent

<HEADLINE> Poll Finds Support for Military </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CONWAY, Wash. (AP) -- As the crow flies, this hamlet nestled  
among Skagit Valley farm houses and strawberry fields is about as 
distant from the Pentagon as you can get in the continental United 
States. 
</P>
<P>
	Yet when it comes to national defense, folks around Conway,  
about 60 miles north of Seattle, share with many Americans a 
mixture of appreciation for the military and the longstanding 
debate over whether it costs too much. 
</P>
<P>
	``We need to have a strong military,'' says Bruce Morrison. He  
believes the military enjoys strong public support and has become 
more closely linked to civilian society since it became an 
all-volunteer service more than two decades ago. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, Morrison's own son, now in college, never considered a  
career in the military. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's got all the opportunity he needs without the military,''  
Morrison, 52, said as he fingered a heaping carton of fresh-picked 
blueberries at the Snow Goose produce stand along the north fork of 
the Skagit River. 
</P>
<P>
	In random interviews recently with people in and around Puget  
Sound, it was difficult to find evidence of a ``disconnect'' with 
the military that Defense Secretary William Cohen fears may be 
undermining support for men and women in uniform -- a culture gap, 
some say, that isolates the military. 
</P>
<P>
	At a flower shop in the fishing village of Blaine, abutting the  
Canadian border, 35-year-old Sherry, who declined to give her last 
name, said she believes a strong military is ``just as important as 
it's always been.'' She would recommend military service to any 
young person. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's probably one of the most important things you could do,''  
she says. 
</P>
<P>
	These views are largely in line with the results of a poll  
conducted for The Associated Press by ICR of Media, Pa., which 
asked adult Americans how much confidence they have in their 
military. Sixty-four percent said they had a ``good deal'' of 
confidence and 28 percent had ``some'' confidence. Only 7 percent 
had little or no confidence. 
</P>
<P>
	The AP poll also asked whether people would support a son or  
daughter's plan to enter the military. Sixty-six percent said they 
would be supportive, and 29 percent said they would suggest a 
different line of work. Five percent did not know. 
</P>
<P>
	The poll also indicated:  
</P>
<P>
	--More than three-quarters said they support a pay raise for the  
military, while 13 percent oppose it. 
</P>
<P>
	--About half, 49 percent, support using U.S. troops as  
peacekeepers overseas, while 42 percent oppose it. 
</P>
<P>
	``We need to keep peace or we'll all be at war,'' said  
50-year-old Sheila Hudson of Tulsa, Okla. 
</P>
<P>
	``I oppose using troops as peacekeepers,'' said Ira Smith, a  
machinist from Jacksonville, Fla. ``I don't think the United States 
should be the world police. Our tax money should be used for 
protecting our own citizens.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The poll of 1,011 people was conducted Sept. 17-24 by  
International Communications Research and has an error margin of 
plus or minus 3 percentage points. 
</P>
<P>
	Some people fault the military for wasteful spending. Others,  
like Richard Owens, say the military simply takes too big a share 
of taxpayer dollars. Over breakfast with his wife and three 
daughters at the Captain Whidbey Inn overlooking Penn Cove near 
Coupeville, Wash., Owens said he believes the military is building 
weapons it no longer needs. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think money in this country should be spent on other  
things,'' he said, like social services. 
</P>
<P>
	In the AP poll, 47 percent said defense spending should be kept  
about the same, 34 percent wanted higher spending and 12 percent 
wanted less. Defense spending for the current budget year is set at 
$270 billion, and the Clinton administration's longer-range plan is 
for military spending to rise to $318 billion by 2005. 
</P>
<P>
	Early this year, Cohen began a public campaign to ``reconnect''  
America to its military, a sales job he felt necessary to boost 
understanding of and support for the 1.4 million men and women on 
active duty. He took his message on the road, starting with an 
address to the Illinois State Assembly where he made a pitch for 
military pay raises. 
</P>
<P>
	Cohen also visited the Redmond, Wash., headquarters of computer  
giant Microsoft Corp., an unusual audience for a Pentagon chief. 
</P>
<P>
	``I believe there exists a gap between some in this industry and  
our military,'' Cohen told his Microsoft listeners. 
</P>
<P>
	The gap, he said, is not unique to the high-tech industries but  
is ``indicative of our country.'' There is a tendency to ``dismiss 
the importance of the national security world,'' he said, and to 
conclude that with the Cold War over, ``tanks and guns are somehow 
rusty relics of the past and nearly obsolete in the new 
information-based world.'' 
</P>
<P>
	That does not fit with the views of Tom Holum, 43, who lives on  
the south end of Whidbey Island, just west of Everett. He thinks 
the military plays an important role in America's economic 
security, and he believes young people still are attracted to the 
military for high-tech skills that are transferrable to the 
civilian job market. 
</P>
<P>
	On the campus of the University of Washington in Seattle, Kristi  
Beck, a 20-year-old psychology major, said she admires the men and 
women who serve in the military but never seriously considered it 
as a possible career path. 
</P>
<P>
	``I didn't like the idea of having to move around a lot,'' she  
said.

<HEADLINE> Yonehara Wins Athens Marathon </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ATHENS, Greece (AP) -- Japan's Masato Yonehara sprinted to the  
finish line and defeated last year's winner, Nikos Pollias, by 
three seconds to win the Athens Marathon Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	The 32-year-old Yonehara finished in a time of 2 hours, 18  
minutes and 35 seconds. Pollias' countryman Vassilis Zambelis, of 
Greece, was third at 2:22:29. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was very stressful... but I'm very happy,'' said Yonehara,  
winner of the 1994 Portland Marathon. ``The course was difficult, a 
lot of uphill and downhill.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In the women's field, Okuno Tamaki of Japan won in 2:46:46,  
beating Greece's Georgia Abatzidou and Iota Nikolakopoulou, who 
finished respectively in 2:53:01 and 3:09:13. 
</P>
<P>
	The same course is planned for the 2004 Olympics in Athens.  
</P>
<P>
	Organizers said more than 1,500 people took part in the  
marathon, which ended at the all-marble Pan Athenian stadium, site 
of the first modern Olympic Games in 1896.

<HEADLINE> Umps Clear Field After Close Calls </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BOSTON (AP) -- After a close call against Boston brought a shower  
of debris in the ninth inning, umpires cleared the field for eight 
minutes Sunday night in Game 4 of the AL Championship Series 
between the Red Sox and New York Yankees. 
</P>
<P>
	``That's not very good sportsmanlike conduct from the fans,''  
Boston first baseman Mike Stanley said. ``We're sorry for the way 
we acted, that's not right. Not right at all.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The sellout crowd of 33,586 already was angry, having seen  
second-base umpire Tim Tschida call out Jose Offerman in the eighth 
inning -- replays showed second baseman Chuck Knoblauch missed the 
tag. 
</P>
<P>
	``No, I didn't make the right call,'' Tschida said, the second  
time in this series an ump admitted blowing a call against Boston. 
</P>
<P>
	Then, after pinch-hitter Ricky Ledee's grand slam in the top of  
the ninth broke it open and gave the Yankees a 9-2 lead, the real 
trouble began. 
</P>
<P>
	Nomar Garciaparra opened the bottom half with a grounder to  
third baseman Scott Brosius, and was called out by first-base 
umpire Dale Scott in a bang-bang play. 
</P>
<P>
	Red Sox manager Jimy Williams ran on the field to argue, and  
threw his hat. Williams was ejected, and the fans went crazy. 
</P>
<P>
	Williams did not comment on the incident.  
</P>
<P>
	``Their manager was getting my vote for manager of the year  
until tonight,'' said Yankees owner George Steinbrenner, seated in 
a front-row box. ``He incited it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	At first, a few plastic water bottles were thrown on the field.  
Glass bottles followed, with several of them barely missing Scott's 
head. 
</P>
<P>
	With security personnel rushing on the field, first baseman Tino  
Martinez and other Yankees also had to duck flying objects as they 
went scurrying for cover in the third-base dugout. New York 
relievers also ran out of the right-field bullpen as umpires waved 
them off the field. 
</P>
<P>
	At one point, there appeared to be a yelling match between a Red  
Sox security person and Yankees pitcher Jeff Nelson in the dugout. 
</P>
<P>
	``Jimy Williams, if he incited the crowd, that was not his  
intention,'' Yankees manager Joe Torre said. 
</P>
<P>
	``The sad part about it is you have a team -- the Boston Red Sox  
-- that has given this city something to be proud about. To have 
people throwing stuff, that's disgraceful,'' he said. ``I know it's 
not an indication of Boston, Mass. But that was a bad mark against 
a very good team.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The crowd continued to chant profanities, and the public-address  
announcer was forced to urge fans to halt, saying the Red Sox might 
be forced to forfeit the game. 
</P>
<P>
	After the Yankees waited safely in their dugout, order was  
restored and the game resumed. 
</P>
<P>
	New York won 9-2 and took a 3-1 lead in the best-of-7 series.  
</P>
<P>
	``It's quite regrettable,'' Steinbrenner said. ``I'm sorry it  
happened.''

<HEADLINE> Rams 41, Falcons 13 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ATLANTA (AP) -- It didn't matter that Kurt Warner finally had one  
of those days when he didn't light it up for the St. Louis Rams. 
</P>
<P>
	He didn't have to do anything special Sunday as the Rams got a  
101-yard kickoff return from Tony Horne and a 91-yard interception 
return from Grant Wistrom to remain the NFL's only unbeaten team 
with a 41-13 rout of the Atlanta Falcons. 
</P>
<P>
	Warner put the Rams (5-0) in control when he engineered  
touchdown drives on the first two possessions, and after the 
Falcons (1-5) cut the lead to 14-7 early in the second, Horne raced 
the distance down the sideline for his second scoring kickoff 
return in two weeks. He had a 97-yarder in last week's 42-20 
victory over San Francisco. 
</P>
<P>
	Atlanta had one more chance to cut the lead to a touchdown  
before halftime, reaching the Rams 9, but Wistrom picked off Chris 
Chandler's pass and lumbered the distance for a 28-7 lead 1:42 
before halftime. 
</P>
<P>
	The Falcons never threatened to get back in the game again.  
</P>
<P>
	Warner, who passed for 1,217 yards and 14 touchdowns in the  
first four games, connected on 13 of 20 for 111 yards and one 
touchdown. It was his lowest yardage total since passing for 275 
yards and three scores when the Rams shelled the Falcons 35-7 in 
their first meeting in St. Louis three weeks ago. 
</P>
<P>
	Marshall Faulk gave him all the offensive help he needed,  
running for 181 yards and a touchdown on 18 carries. 
</P>
<P>
	Warner passed for 36 yards and Faulk added 40 yards on five  
carries to account for all yardage in the first possession of the 
game, one that ended with Warner's 4-yard scoring pass to Isaac 
Bruce with 9:20 left in the opening quarter. 
</P>
<P>
	Warner then had passes of 17 and 9 yards to Faulk in a 59-yard  
drive in which the Rams overcame three false start penalties to 
eventually score on Faulk's 5-yard run with 2:03 left in the 
opening quarter. 
</P>
<P>
	Chandler, bothered by a strained hamstring, threw a 13-yard  
touchdown pass to Bob Christian to make it 14-7 just over three 
minutes into the second quarter -- right before Horne's kickoff 
return. 
</P>
<P>
	Chandler completed 10 of 18 passes for 168 yards before leaving  
with 12:32 left in the third with what was called flu-like 
symptoms. 
</P>
<P>
	St. Louis also got a 1-yard touchdown run from Robert Holcombe  
in the fourth quarter, and its other scoring came on field goals of 
22 and 49 yards by Jeff Wilkins. 
</P>
<P>
	Morten Andersen had field goals of 19 and 25 yards for the  
Falcons.

<HEADLINE> Ex-Nurse Convicted in 6 Ind. Deaths </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BRAZIL, Ind. (AP) -- A former nurse was convicted of murder  
Sunday in the deaths of six patients at a western Indiana hospital. 
</P>
<P>
	Jurors hearing the case of Orville Lynn Majors told the judge  
they could not reach a verdict on the seventh count. 
</P>
<P>
	Majors, 38, could be sentenced to life in prison.  
</P>
<P>
	He contended the patients died of the ailments that put them in  
the hospital, but prosecutors said the deaths were consistent with 
injections of potassium chloride, epinephrine or both. Police found 
containers of those drugs at Majors' house and in his van. 
</P>
<P>
	The patients died in a 13-month span at Vermillion County  
Hospital in Clinton. Relatives of the seven testified they saw 
Majors near the patients just before they died, and witnesses said 
they saw him give injections to four of the patients. 
</P>
<P>
	The defense called family doctors of several patients as  
witnesses, who said their patients died from the illnesses that 
brought them to the hospital. 
</P>
<P>
	Prosecutors built their case around the fact that Majors was  
present, and often alone, when each patient died. 
</P>
<P>
	Jurors never saw statistical studies that linked Majors to as  
many as 130 of 147 deaths at the hospital. Special Judge Ernest 
Yelton, fearing the deluge of information would overwhelm the jury 
and bog down the trial, didn't allow prosecutors to use the 
studies. 
</P>
<P>
	The jury had heard evidence for five weeks, and began  
deliberating on Thursday morning. 
</P>
<P>
	The case began more than four years ago when a nursing  
supervisor became suspicious of the rising death rate in the 
hospital's intensive care unit, where Majors worked most days.

<HEADLINE> Several Hospitalized in Pit Accident </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	FORT WORTH, Texas (AP) -- Five people remained hospitalized  
Sunday, one in serious condition, after rookie Niclas Jonsson lost 
control of his car on pit road at the Texas Motor Speedway. 
</P>
<P>
	Twelve people, including nine members of Tyce Carlson's crew,  
were injured in Saturday's accident during post-qualifying practice 
for the Indy Racing League's Mall.com 500. 
</P>
<P>
	Crew member Tracy Hash was in serious condition with a broken  
leg, speedway officials said. Fellow crew members Jeff Howerton and 
Thomas Bose also were recuperating. Howerton was in stable 
condition with a broken leg, and Bose was in fair condition with 
broken ribs, according to hospital officials. 
</P>
<P>
	Two other members of Carlson's crew, Greg Height and William  
Dyer, were scheduled to be released from the hospital today, 
speedway officials said. 
</P>
<P>
	Jonsson, who sustained a slight concussion and was released from  
the hospital, missed Sunday's season-ending race. Carlson wasn't 
injured, but his father, Richard Carlson, who has a heart problem, 
was hospitalized as a precaution and later released. 
</P>
<P>
	Jonsson was heading back onto the track after a pit stop when  
his car jerked left, hit the retaining wall and smacked into 
Carlson's parked car. 
</P>
<P>
	Carlson's crew was working on an electrical problem. They never  
saw or heard Jonsson coming. The Swede had been building up speed 
for about 50 yards. 
</P>
<P>
	Carlson said he was running today's race for his injured crew  
members. 
</P>
<P>
	``These guys are not only my teammates, but they are also my  
best friends,'' he said in a statement before the race. ``Today's 
race is dedicated to them and they will be with me all the way.''

<HEADLINE> NiSource Raises Columbia Energy Bid </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HERNDON, Va. (AP) -- NiSource Inc. has upped its offer for  
Columbia Energy Group by 9 percent, or $6 a share, to try to 
persuade Columbia to drop its vigorous, months-long efforts to fend 
off the bid. 
</P>
<P>
	NiSource, facing a deadline today to announce the results of a  
$68 a share offer initially made in June, said Sunday it would pay 
$74 a share for the Virginia company. The increase would boost the 
value of the deal to $6.1 billion from $5.7 billion. 
</P>
<P>
	The sweetened bid offers shareholders a 22 percent premium over  
Columbia's Friday's closing price of $60.50 on the New York Stock 
Exchange. 
</P>
<P>
	``Today's offer is the right price for the right company at the  
right time,'' said Gary L. Neale, NiSource's chairman, president 
and chief executive officer. ``The $74 cash per share we are 
offering is well above the value that Columbia, on its own, in any 
reasonable time frame, could provide its shareholders and allows 
Columbia shareholders to receive their share of the value created 
by the combination of the two companies.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The offer expires at midnight Nov. 12.  
</P>
<P>
	In an overture to Columbia's management, Neale said Columbia  
Energy Chairman Oliver G. Richard III would become vice chairman of 
the combined company, and that he and four other members of 
Columbia's board would be invited to join an expanded NiSource 
board. 
</P>
<P>
	NiSource, based in Merrillville, Ind., said its bid has received  
``substantial'' support from Columbia shareholders, with 44.4 
million shares, or nearly 54 percent, agreeing to the offer, as of 
midnight Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	In a statement Sunday, Columbia Energy said its board would  
review the higher offer but urged shareholders not to act before 
the board had made a recommendation. 
</P>
<P>
	Maria Hibbs, a spokeswoman for NiSource, said size and geography  
are becoming increasingly critical to succeeding in the changing 
energy industry. She said NiSource and Columbia Energy would make a 
good fit in a natural gas distribution corridor stretching from the 
Chicago market to New England. 
</P>
<P>
	Last week, Columbia launched a final appeal to shareholders to  
reject the previous NiSource bid. The Herndon-based company also 
paid for ads in Indiana newspapers claiming that the buyout would 
harm consumers there. 
</P>
<P>
	``Shouldn't NiSource be spending its time and money trying to  
reduce harmful smokestack emissions and protecting the welfare of 
its customers and communities in Indiana?'' said one ad, which 
accused NiSource of having a ``disturbing environmental record.'' 
</P>
<P>
	NiSource is the parent company of Northern Indiana Public  
Service Co. and Bay State Gas Co. in Massachusetts. It would become 
one of the nation's biggest natural gas companies if the takeover 
succeeds. 
</P>
<P>
	Columbia Energy is involved in natural gas exploration,  
production, transmission, storage and distribution as well as 
propane sales and electric power generation, sales and trading. 
</P>
<P>
	In April, Columbia Energy attempted to buy Pittsburgh-based  
Consolidated Natural Gas. But CNG rejected the offer and chose to 
proceed with a previously planned merger with Richmond, Va.-based 
Dominion Resources Inc.

<HEADLINE> NFL Roundup </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	Lots of quarterback changes brought mixed results.  
</P>
<P>
	For Jacksonville, Miami and Detroit, the changes worked. For the  
Jets, Vikings, Bears and Saints, they didn't. 
</P>
<P>
	Jay Fiedler, a fourth-year veteran from Dartmouth, replaced the  
injured Mark Brunell and led the sputtering Jaguars to 18 points 
over the final 1 1/2 quarters Sunday, going 12-of-14 for 113 yards and 
scrambling three times for 27 yards in a 24-7 victory over the 
Cleveland Browns. 
</P>
<P>
	Damon Huard, filling in after Dan Marino left early with a sore  
shoulder, threw a 5-yard touchdown pass to Stanley Pritchett with 
23 seconds left to give the Dolphins a 31-30 win over the New 
England Patriots. 
</P>
<P>
	Gus Frerotte relieved the injured Charlie Batch for Detroit and  
had five straight completions for 45 yards to set up Jason Hanson's 
winning field goal in a 25-23 victory over Minnesota. 
</P>
<P>
	In other games Sunday, Indianapolis edged the Jets 16-13;  
Philadelphia topped Chicago 20-16; Tennessee downed New Orleans 
24-21; Oakland defeated Buffalo 20-14; Pittsburgh beat Cincinnati 
17-13; St. Louis crushed Atlanta 41-13; San Diego edged Seattle 
13-10; Denver downed Green Bay 31-10; and Carolina nipped San 
Francisco 31-29. 
</P>
<P>
	In a night game, it was Washington at Arizona.  
</P>
<P>
	Baltimore, Kansas City and Tampa Bay had the week off.  
</P>
<P>
	Brunell appeared to injure his ribs early in the third quarter  
when he threw a long pass down the sideline that Jimmy Smith just 
missed. 
</P>
<P>
	Jacksonville (5-1) trailed 7-6 when linebacker Bryan Schwartz  
forced a fumble that was recovered by Kevin Hardy at the 25-yard 
line of the Browns (0-6). 
</P>
<P>
	Three plays later, Fiedler lobbed a pass to the corner of the  
end zone to Kyle Brady, who extended for a nice catch in double 
coverage and a 7-yard touchdown -- the first TD pass of Fiedler's 
career. A 2-point conversion made it 14-7. 
</P>
<P>
	``Any time a starting quarterback gets hurt and comes out,  
everyone else picks his game up a little bit,'' Fiedler said. 
``They helped me out a great deal. The line was protecting very 
well.'' 
</P>
<P>
	After Jacksonville forced a punt, Fiedler directed the best  
drive of the day, a 70-yard march that included completions to 
three receivers and ended with a 2-yard touchdown run by James 
Stewart for a 21-7 lead. 
</P>
<P>
	As the Jaguars left the field, fans serenaded Brunell's  
replacement with chants of ``Fiedler, Fiedler, Fiedler.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Within minutes, coach Tom Coughlin was answering questions about  
who the starter would be once Jacksonville returns from a bye week, 
assuming Brunell recovers from the bruised ribs that sidelined him. 
</P>
<P>
	``Our situation will not change,'' Coughlin said. ``Hopefully,  
Mark will be able to rest this week and he'll be ready to go.'' 
</P>
<P>
                      *Dolphins 31, Patriots 30    	
</P>
<P>
	At Foxboro, Mass., the Dolphins had fallen behind 14-0 on two  
interception returns by the Patriots (4-2) -- a 57-yarder by Andy 
Katzenmoyer off Marino and a 24-yarder by Ty Law on Huard's first 
pass. 
</P>
<P>
	But after that Huard settled down. He threw a 69-yard TD pass to  
Tony Martin and the final 5-yard score to Pritchett on a 59-yard 
drive on which he converted three third downs -- a third-and-10, a 
third-and-9 and a third-and-5. He finished 24-of-42 for 240 yards 
and ran six times for 54 times. 
</P>
<P>
	In between, Olindo Mare kept Miami (4-1) in the game with six  
field goals -- breaking an NFL record by kicking four or more for 
the fourth straight game. They included a 53-yarder with 3:01 left 
that set the stage for Miami's final drive. 
</P>
<P>
                        *Lions 25, Vikings 23    	
</P>
<P>
	At Pontiac, Mich., Hanson's 47-yard field goal put Detroit on  
top 22-20 with 7:06 remaining. 
</P>
<P>
	Jeff George, who replaced the ineffective Randall Cunningham,  
had a 38-yard completion to Jake Reed in a 71-yard drive that set 
up Gary Anderson's 26-yarder to give Minnesota (2-4) a 23-22 lead. 
Still, some of the Vikings felt they should have gone for a 
touchdown instead of settling for that field goal. 
</P>
<P>
	``I wanted a touchdown,'' said Randy Moss, who had 10 receptions  
for 125 yards. ``Last year's team went for everything.'' 
</P>
<P>
	On the winning field goal, Hanson was good from 43 yards out,  
but officials waved it off, flagging the Lions (3-2) for delay. 
Then the Vikings called a timeout in an effort to test Hanson's 
nerves before he hit the winner. 
</P>
<P>
                          *Colts 17, Jets 14    	
</P>
<P>
	At East Rutherford, N.J., untested Ray Lucas made his first NFL  
start and threw a late interception at the goal line that Jeff 
Burris returned 55 yards. The runback set up Mike Vanderjagt's 
27-yard field goal with 14 seconds remaining to give the Colts 
(3-2) the win. 
</P>
<P>
	``We were on the sideline talking about our two-minute drill,''  
Colts quarterback Peyton Manning said. ``We were hoping to be down 
by only three, but expecting to be down by seven. Fortunately, Jeff 
and the defense put us in position to win.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Jets (1-5) blew an early 13-0 lead.  
</P>
<P>
                         *Eagles 20, Bears 16    	
</P>
<P>
	At Chicago, Doug Pederson had career highs in completions (16),  
yards passing (207) and longest pass (57 yards) by halftime, and 
the Eagles (2-4) hung on for the victory. 
</P>
<P>
	Cade McNown, making his first NFL start in place of the injured  
Shane Matthews, threw an 80-yard touchdown pass, and Chris Boniol 
kicked a 41-yard field goal in the second half, but the Bears (3-3) 
came up empty in two trips to the Eagles 31. 
</P>
<P>
                        *Titans 24, Saints 21    	
</P>
<P>
	At New Orleans, the Titans (5-1) rallied to win in the second  
half for the fourth time this season, while the Saints (1-4) lost a 
second-half lead for the fourth straight game. 
</P>
<P>
	Jason Fisk, a 300-pound defensive tackle, and cornerback Donald  
Mitchell intercepted passes in the closing minutes to secure the 
outcome as the Titans continued their best start since 1991, when 
they opened 7-1 as the Houston Oilers. 
</P>
<P>
                        *Raiders 20, Bills 14    	
</P>
<P>
	At Buffalo, Eric Turner picked off Doug Flutie's 24-yard  
desperation pass in the end zone with no time left. 
</P>
<P>
	Tyrone Wheatley had 97 of his team's 195 yards rushing and  
scored two touchdowns, and Michael Husted kicked two field goals as 
Oakland (3-3) snapped the four-game winning streak that Buffalo 
(4-2) brought into the game. 
</P>
<P>
                       *Steelers 17, Bengals 3    	
</P>
<P>
	At Cincinnati, Jerome Bettis bowled over tacklers and provided  
the only semblance of offense by either team, rushing for 111 yards 
and two touchdowns. 
</P>
<P>
	The Steelers (3-3) intercepted Cincinnati (1-5) quarterback  
Akili Smith twice, sacked him four times, batted down four throws 
at the line and got their hands on 13 of his throws overall. 
</P>
<P>
                         *Rams 41, Falcons 13    	
</P>
<P>
	At Atlanta, Tony Horne had a 101-yard kickoff return and Grant  
Wistrom brought back an interception 91 yards for a score as St. 
Louis (5-0) remained the league's only undefeated team. 
</P>
<P>
	Kurt Warner engineered touchdown drives on the first two  
possessions, and after the Falcons (1-5) cut the lead to 14-7 early 
in the second, Horne raced down the sideline for his second scoring 
kickoff return in two weeks. 
</P>
<P>
                      *Chargers 13, Seahawks 10    	
</P>
<P>
	At San Diego, John Carney kicked two field goals over the final  
2:54, including the game-winning 41-yarder as time expired. 
</P>
<P>
	The Chargers, under rookie head coach Mike Riley, improved to  
4-1 for the first time since 1996. The Seahawks, in their first 
year under Mike Holmgren, fell to 3-2. 
</P>
<P>
                       *Broncos 31, Packers 10    	
</P>
<P>
	At Denver, Brian Griese threw two touchdown passes to Ed  
McCaffrey and ran for a third and the Broncos (2-4) finished with a 
huge edge in total offense (514-133) and time of possession 
(45:14-14:46). 
</P>
<P>
	Olandis Gary, elevated to a starting role because of injuries to  
Terrell Davis and Derek Loville, carried 37 times for 124 yards and 
a score, and the Broncos' defense intercepted Brett Favre three 
times. 
</P>
<P>
                        *Panthers 31, 49ers 29    	
</P>
<P>
	At San Francisco, the Panthers (2-3) scored 24 second-quarter  
points and hung on to stop San Francisco's club-record 19-game home 
winning streak. 
</P>
<P>
	Steve Beuerlein threw for four touchdowns, including 7- and  
33-yard strikes to Patrick Jeffers. The 49ers (3-3) played their 
third straight game without Steve Young, still bothered by the 
aftereffects of his fourth concussion in three years.

<HEADLINE> Clinton For Campaign Finance Reform </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MONTICELLO, N.Y. (AP) -- Senate contender Hillary Rodham Clinton  
told about 600 Democrats at a political fund-raiser Sunday that as 
an almost-candidate she has become an even bigger booster of 
campaign finance reform. 
</P>
<P>
	``Now that I'm leaning so far in becoming a candidate that if I  
leaned any further I'd fall over, I really support campaign finance 
reform,'' said Mrs. Clinton, whose supporters have vowed to raise 
$25 million for her race. 
</P>
<P>
	``In the weeks and months ahead I'm going to have more to say  
about that because I think it is imperative that we all, as 
citizens of our democracy, stand up for change in the way that we 
finance campaigns,'' the first lady said. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Clinton, a frequent campaigner who has not formally  
declared her candidacy, offered no details about what she might 
propose. 
</P>
<P>
	She starred at a $55-a-person Sullivan County Democratic  
Committee's fund-raising dinner at a Catskill Mountains landmark, 
Kutsher's Country Club. It was the second such event she has 
headlined in three days and the third in three weeks in her adopted 
state. 
</P>
<P>
	While Mrs. Clinton has regularly sought to help Democratic  
congressional candidates across New York, in recent weeks she has 
begun lending her fame to local party organizations in preparation 
for next year's Senate race. 
</P>
<P>
	The Clinton camp believes that helping local Democrats,  
particularly outside heavily Democratic New York City, could pay 
dividends for the first lady in a U.S. senate race against the 
probable opponent, New York City Mayor Rudolph Giuliani. The 
suburban counties surrounding New York City and the upstate area, 
where Republicans tend to do well, are expected to be key 
battlegrounds in the Senate race. 
</P>
<P>
	In recent days, Mrs. Clinton has stepped up her campaigning,  
drawing distinctions between herself and Giuliani, without 
mentioning the mayor by name.

<HEADLINE> Vlasic Resurrects Old TV Commercial </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- If the Vlasic pickle commercial that starts  
running next month looks familiar, you may be showing your age. 
</P>
<P>
	Vlasic Foods International dug into its commercial archive in  
developing its ad plans for this fall and discovered it had a 
25-year-old commercial featuring the voice of Groucho Marx that 
still resonates with consumers. 
</P>
<P>
	The animated ad shows a cartoony grandmother, schoolboy and  
husband each taking a bite of a Vlasic pickle and then imitating 
Marx's distinctive voice and style in saying ``Now that's the best 
tasting pickle I've ever heard.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Diana Robina, head of programming for Viacom's TV Land cable  
network that carries a steady diet of program and commercial reruns 
to 42 million subscribers, said old commercials ``hit an emotional 
chord with the viewer.'' 
</P>
<P>
	That is important to advertisers who are finding it tougher to  
stand out amid the clamor of traditional TV advertising. 
</P>
<P>
	``People do stop and watch them,'' she said, referring to the  
old adsTV Land regularly carries without charge to the original 
advertisers, some of whom aren't around to pay anyway. 
</P>
<P>
	Several paying advertisers have recently brought back retired  
advertising icons like Charlie the Tuna for StarKist and Mr. 
Whipple for Charmin. Others like Maxwell House and Life cereal have 
used parts of old ads in new commercials. 
</P>
<P>
	But advertising executives were hard-pressed to name another  
advertiser who has brought back an old commercial decades after it 
had been run and used it again without alterations. 
</P>
<P>
	``We had planned to remake the ad, but when we tested it with  
consumers, it scored so well we decided not to reinvent the 
wheel,'' said Vlasic marketing executive Joe Adams. 
</P>
<P>
	He said about 15 percent of the people who were shown the ad  
remembered its run which began and ended in 1974. He said they 
mentioned they liked both the humor and the nostalgic feelings it 
evoked in them about their youth. 
</P>
<P>
	But it also scored well in the tests with viewers who either  
didn't remember it or were too young to have seen it the last time 
it ran. 
</P>
<P>
	``It worked literally as well today as it worked back then''  
Adams said. 
</P>
<P>
	Vlasic, which is based in Cherry Hill, N.J., intends to spend $5  
million to $10 million to run the ad in November and December on a 
mix of network, cable and syndicated TV programs. In addition to 
the original 30-second version, it has created a 15-second version 
using the same material. The ads may continue into the new year if 
they are well received. 
</P>
<P>
	The company is also sponsoring a contest to find a Groucho  
Marx-imitator whose voice will be used in its next ad. 
</P>
<P>
	Vlasic pickles have been the best-selling brand since 1978, the  
company says, accounting for about 32 percent of the $800 million 
market last year.

<HEADLINE> Bush Wasn't Always a Front-Runner </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	AUSTIN, Texas (AP) -- On the stump, George W. Bush was for  
business, against government regulation and intent on running as 
his own man despite a well-known father. 
</P>
<P>
	``Responsibility,'' he said, ``is a good thing to learn.''  
</P>
<P>
	The year: 1978.  
</P>
<P>
	Bush was making his first bid for elected office -- for a House  
seat. He lost. 
</P>
<P>
	Much has changed since that congressional campaign. Much has  
stayed the same. 
</P>
<P>
	``He was conservative and a personable young man,'' says Jane  
Anne Stinnett of Lubbock. ``Still is.'' 
</P>
<P>
	------	 
</P>
<P>
	Bush was in the oil business in Midland, his childhood hometown,  
when he announced his candidacy in July 1977 for the House seat 
representing West Texas' 19th District. 
</P>
<P>
	``George just drove into town one day and started walking down a  
strip mall shopping center,'' said Mike Weiss, who was to become 
his Lubbock campaign chairman. ``I happened to be in a men's store. 
He walked up and introduced himself. I liked him.'' The two met 
again the next day, talked, ``and I signed on.'' 
</P>
<P>
	West Texas in 1978, like much of the state, was solidly  
Democratic. No Republican had been elected governor in 100 years. 
Democrats controlled politics from the Statehouse to the 
courthouses. 
</P>
<P>
	``There was a pretty general feeling that Republicans couldn't  
get elected,'' Weiss said. 
</P>
<P>
	But Bush's first problem was not a Democrat; it was the GOP  
primary. 
</P>
<P>
	He was challenged by Jim Reese, a conservative Republican and  
former Odessa mayor who was defeated two years earlier in a bid for 
the House seat, and Joe Hickox of Shallowater. Bush led the primary 
with 6,296 votes and bested Reese in a runoff. 
</P>
<P>
	Bush's general election opponent, Democrat Kent Hance, was a  
state senator from Lubbock, the district's biggest city. 
</P>
<P>
	There were not many philosophical disagreements. Bush said Hance  
would make a good Republican. Hance said Bush would make a good 
conservative Democrat. 
</P>
<P>
	``On issues of oil and gas, inflation, national defense, the  
public works bill and extension of time to pass the Equal Rights 
Amendment, Hance and Bush were as compatible as two warts on a 
toad,'' the Midland Reporter-Telegram wrote. 
</P>
<P>
	Hance, who now practices law in Austin, recalls that they were  
asked about gun control at a forum. ``Every candidate was against 
it. When they finally got down to me, I said, `Not only am I 
against it -- if they ever pass it and try to get your guns, I'll 
come over to your house and help you.' Even Bush laughed at that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Bush's campaign speeches were peppered with lines today's  
audiences will recognize. 
</P>
<P>
	On the economy: Government ``should help people realize their  
American dream. People should be given a chance to realize their 
own ambitions.'' 
</P>
<P>
	On personal responsibility: ``In my view, individuals need to  
solve their own problems. The federal government hurts what we are 
trying to achieve.'' 
</P>
<P>
	On negative campaigning: ``Our whole thing is to keep it  
positive. People are tired of negative politicians ... I'm 
convinced people are looking for somebody to say, `Here's what's 
good.''' 
</P>
<P>
	On the influence of his father, who had been a congressman, U.S.  
Senate candidate, GOP chairman, CIA director and U.S. envoy to 
China: ``We don't need dad in this race.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Hance made an issue of Bush's family ties and his prep school,  
Ivy League education. He even poked fun at Bush's jogging. 
</P>
<P>
	``We tried to make it Texas Tech vs. Yale. And in that district,  
the Red Raiders will beat the Bulldogs every time,'' Hance recalls. 
</P>
<P>
	Bush responded, ``Would you like me to run as Sam Smith? The  
problem is I can't abandon my background. I'm not trying to hide 
behind any facade.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Bush proved a tough opponent.  
</P>
<P>
	``Our original strategy was that I'd be the good guy next door,  
and Bush would be the outsider,'' Hance said. 
</P>
<P>
	``After a few months, at a strategy session, one of my guys  
said, `You know, he's turning out to be a good ol' boy.' After 
that, Bush was the guy next door -- but I'd be in their house, one 
of the relatives.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Then, as now, Bush was a prodigious fund-raiser. Between July 1  
and Sept. 30, he raised $207,558. Hance pulled in just $74,822. 
</P>
<P>
	A ``Bush Bash'' ad in Texas Tech's student newspaper offered  
``free beer-music.'' Hance's campaign launched an 11th-hour attack, 
but he says he does not think that played a role in the outcome. 
</P>
<P>
	A key factor, both sides agree, was demographics.  
</P>
<P>
	Bush's background was in the oil business and Midland was an oil  
town. Lubbock and much of the rest of the High Plains district was 
farm and ranch country. Lubbock was Hance territory. He had 
represented much of the region in the state Senate. 
</P>
<P>
	``Hance worked the rural areas extremely well. He had  
friendships built up over 10, 15 years that were impossible to 
overcome in the period of time we had,'' Weiss said. ``If they had 
played that football game another quarter, we'd have won.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Hance says Election Day arrived in the nick of time.  
</P>
<P>
	``It was Bush's first campaign, and he improved every week. By  
the end of the race, he was an excellent candidate. I really didn't 
want another month of campaigning. There was no doubt in my mind 
that I didn't want to face him again, either,'' Hance said. 
</P>
<P>
	When the votes were counted, Hance had 54,729; Bush got 48,070.  
</P>
<P>
	The Democrat went to Congress, backed Ronald Reagan's tax cut  
and eventually became a Republican. 
</P>
<P>
	Bush went back to the oil business in Midland and eventually  
bought a piece of the Texas Rangers baseball team. 
</P>
<P>
	When Bush announced plans in 1993 to challenge popular  
Democratic Gov. Ann Richards, one of his first contributions was a 
$10,000 check from Kent Hance. 
</P>
<P>
	``When I handed him that check, he laughed and said, `Fifteen  
years ago a lot of people from Midland wouldn't have believed 
this,''' Hance recalled. ``I said a lot of people from Lubbock 
wouldn't have believed it, either.''

<HEADLINE> 'Dame Edna' Leaves Audiences Giddy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 *An AP Entertainment Review    	
</P>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- There may be more theatrical sights on Broadway  
this season but for sheer blissful incongruity it will be hard to 
top a sea of gladioluses gracefully bobbing above contented, 
exhausted theatergoers at the Booth Theater. 
</P>
<P>
	Contented and exhausted because they have just laughed  
themselves silly over the antics of Dame Edna Everage, the creation 
and alter ego of Australian actor Barry Humphries. The performer 
has discovered there is gold in drag, particularly in England, 
where this exotic creature has flourished for more than two 
decades. Now, she's set to make her mark here. 
</P>
<P>
	The glads have been flung into the audience by Dame Edna at the  
end of her show, which opened Sunday at the Booth. It's called, 
appropriately enough ``Dame Edna: The Royal Tour.'' The Dame 
exhorts her fans -- possums, she calls them -- to thrust those 
flowers into the air and join her in a catchy little tune -- and 
they slavishly comply. 
</P>
<P>
	What does Dame Edna do exactly? Sing? More off-key than on.  
Dance? Ginger Rogers, she's not. Act? The woman is from the 
heaving-bosom-and-rolling-eyeball school of emoting. 
</P>
<P>
	What Dame Edna does better than anyone else is chat. She talks  
to the audience, bringing them into her gaudy world, a stage 
setting designed by Kenneth Foy that looks like a cross between a 
Las Vegas wedding chapel and Barbie's doll house. 
</P>
<P>
	Dame Edna herself could be Barbie's dizzy aunt, slightly naughty  
and not above a few catty remarks about everyone from Nicole Kidman 
to Dame Judi Dench. Her hair, purple cotton candy rather than 
coiffed, and her outfits -- check out the pink and silver shift in 
the first act -- celebrate excess. 
</P>
<P>
	``The Royal Tour'' is subtitled ``The Show that Listens,'' and  
Dame Edna does that, too. It is part of Humphries' genius that he 
works his conversations with audience members into an important 
part of the act. The results are sublimely funny, as the Dame 
tweaks herself and her willing victims. 
</P>
<P>
	Dame Edna has no doubts about her status as housewife, megastar,  
icon and adviser to the Queen of England. She dispenses wisdom with 
maternal pride, talking with theatergoers about their clothes, 
eating habits, decorating ability and their children. 
</P>
<P>
	Edna also talks about her family: unmarried son Kenny, a fashion  
designer with a penchant for leather and head of the Yvonne DeCarlo 
Appreciation Society, and daughter Valmai, who lives in one of New 
York's outer boroughs with her same-sex partner, a former tennis 
star of Eastern European descent. Then there is Edna's mother, who 
is spending her remaining days in ``a maximum security twilight 
home.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Humphries gleefully attacks the cult of celebrity while having  
his creation revel in it. Dame Edna has no doubt about her worth. 
She cheerfully and publicly corrects flaws in others, but ``only in 
the nicest way possible.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Audience participation is a dangerous game, but Humphries gets  
the most out of eager theatergoers, turning innocuous facts he 
learns about them into belly laughs. He even parades a couple on 
stage to eat a meal and dresses up others as members of the Royal 
Family. 
</P>
<P>
	For all the supposed spontaneity of the evening, the show is  
carefully constructed. Humphries operates loosely with that 
structure, but he thinks fast and furiously enough to insure the 
laughs don't stop. ``Dame Edna: The Royal Tour'' makes for mighty 
entertainment -- but then, the woman, of course, is invincible.

<HEADLINE> Martinez Shut Down Yankees </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BOSTON (AP) -- Pedro Martinez wasn't as unhittable as he was in  
his last outing against the New York Yankees -- or the rest of the 
season, for that matter. 
</P>
<P>
	Instead, he was merely dominating.  
</P>
<P>
	Missing as much as 9 mph off his fastball and still feeling the  
pain of a strained shoulder muscle, Martinez at 90 percent was good 
enough to shut down the Yankees in a ballyhooed matchup with Roger 
Clemens in Game 3 of the AL championship series. 
</P>
<P>
	``In the first inning, I had exactly what I had the whole game --  
nothing,'' he said Saturday night after Boston beat New York 13-1 
to narrow that gap in the best-of-7 series to 2-1. ``I didn't feel 
good at all. ... I didn't have a fastball. I didn't feel like I had 
a good breaking ball, or a good changeup at all. I just managed to 
spot the ball well, mix them in there and see what happens.'' 
</P>
<P>
	All the same, Martinez struck out 12 in seven innings, the most  
for a Red Sox pitcher in a postseason history, and extended his 
playoff shutout streak to 17 innings. He allowed just two hits, 
both singles, and did not allow a batter past first base. 
</P>
<P>
	In fact, no runner has advanced to second in the last 14 1-3  
innings against Martinez, dating to the third inning of Game 1 of 
the first-round series against the Cleveland Indians. 
</P>
<P>
	In the fourth inning of that game, Martinez strained his  
shoulder. But that's only slowed him a little; Indians and Yankees 
hitters have just two hits in their last 45 at-bats against him, 
with five walks and 22 strikeouts. 
</P>
<P>
	It may not have been the 17-strikeout one-hitter he threw at the  
Yankees on Sept. 10, but it was plenty. 
</P>
<P>
	``Pedro proved what a good pitcher he is,'' said New York  
shortstop Derek Jeter, who singled in the first inning, then struck 
out twice against Martinez in Game 3. ``He didn't use his fastball 
as he has in the past. He beat us with his other two pitches.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Although Martinez is unquestionably the Red Sox ace, with a  
league-leading 23-4 record, 2.07 ERA and 313 strikeouts, the 
37-year-old Clemens was merely the No. 3 pitcher in New York's 
postseason rotation. But with Clemens' history in Boston, where won 
three Cy Young Awards, Game 3 was trumpeted as a heavyweight 
championship fight. 
</P>
<P>
	But if it was, it was more like Mike Tyson vs. Peter McNeeley  
than Muhammad Ali against George Foreman: a quick knockout, with 
Clemens leaving after two innings. 
</P>
<P>
	The five-time Cy Young Award winner gave up a leadoff triple to  
Jose Offerman and went downhill from there. In all, Clemens allowed 
five runs while getting six outs to see his career postseason 
record fall to 2-3. 
</P>
<P>
	Even with the injury, though, Martinez lived up to his billing.  
And that makes the Red Sox confident about another potential 
matchup between Martinez and Clemens in Game 7. 
</P>
<P>
	Now all they have to do is get there.

	Syrian President Hafez Assad praised Mandela as a freedom  
fighter respected around the world, while Mandela called Assad an 
``establishment.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``I am happy to be with a renowned and a well-known president,''  
Mandela said of Assad after receiving a red-carpet welcome at the 
airport. 
</P>
<P>
	The two later met again for formal talks, Assad's spokesman,  
Jubran Kourieh, said. He did not give details. 
</P>
<P>
	Mandela, who is touring the Middle East and meeting with top  
politicians, was in Iran earlier Sunday. He planned to go to 
Jordan, the Palestinian territories and Israel on Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	Mandela's visit to Israel was seen as a sign of reconciliation  
between the Jewish state and South Africa's anti-apartheid 
movement, which Mandela once led from a prison cell. 
</P>
<P>
	A sought-after mediator of international problems, Mandela was  
expected to encourage the Israeli-Palestinian peace process, the 
Sunday Independent reported in Johannesburg. 
</P>
<P>
	Mandela and other anti-apartheid leaders have said they shared  
the Palestinians' longing for self-determination, and noted that 
Israel helped supply military training, assault rifles and patrol 
boats to the apartheid regime. 
</P>
<P>
	In Tehran, Iran's capital, Mandela laid a wreath on the tomb of  
the late Ayatollah Khomeini, according to the official Islamic 
Republic News Agency, monitored in Dubai, United Arab Emirates. 
</P>
<P>
	Mandela praised Iran's severing of relations with South Africa's  
former apartheid government, and said ``we are indebted to the 
Islamic revolution,'' the news agency reported. 
</P>
<P>
	Mandela also met with President Mohammad Khatami and Ayatollah  
Ali Khamenei, Iran's powerful spiritual leader. 
</P>
<P>
	Mandela recently brokered the end to U.N. sanctions against  
Libya, which were imposed because of suspected Libyan involvement 
in a 1988 bombing of a Pan Am jetliner that killed 270 people.

<HEADLINE> Creativity Seen in New GM Vehicles </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WARREN, Mich. (AP) -- The ``Hi, I'm Jenny'' from General Motors  
Corp. offers weary city commuters a new place to park: the air. 
</P>
<P>
	Not available in stores anytime soon, the Jenny drives like a  
normal car. But when space gets tight, it takes to the skies and 
``parks'' by attaching to special hooks attached to office 
buildings. 
</P>
<P>
	The Jetsons-esque vehicle exists only as a paper in the GM  
Portfolio Development Center, tacked to a wall covered with scores 
of ideas for new vehicles or gadgets. Like the vast majority, it's 
destined to be thrown away. 
</P>
<P>
	The wall is key to a new effort at the world's largest automaker  
to inject excitement into a stoic lineup of cars, trucks and sport 
utility vehicles, and catch whatever wave sweeps car buyers next -- 
before the competition catches it first. 
</P>
<P>
	``GM is a company that's in transition,'' said Wayne K. Cherry,  
GM vice president for design and portfolio development. ``For 
several years, there's been a focus on cost and quality. We're 
still focused on quality, (but) there's a renewed innovation in 
product and design.'' 
</P>
<P>
	GM has been occupied in the 1990s with keeping itself  
financially healthy, by battling unions, cutting costs and shedding 
entire parts of the company along thousands of jobs. At the same 
time, GM's place in the market has shrunk. In 1989, GM had almost 
34 percent of the market and sold 4.9 million vehicles. Last year, 
after strikes nearly shut down its North American production, the 
company sold about 300,000 fewer vehicles and had 29.4 percent of 
the market. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, competitors have won customers with more inventive  
cars and trucks, such as the Lincoln Navigator SUV, Dodge Viper and 
Volkswagen's New Beetle. 
</P>
<P>
	But with labor peace and lower costs in hand, GM appears ready  
to improve its lineup. 
</P>
<P>
	About four years ago, GM began working on a new approach it  
calls the Advanced Portfolio Concepts team. The first production 
vehicles to spring from its ideas will hit the market next year. 
</P>
<P>
	The team is a group of about 40 people who try to predict the  
future -- watching trends, interviewing sociologists and 
anthropologists and trying to answer all sorts of what-if questions 
about the world's future need for transportation. The group also 
looks to find ways GM can improve its cars or sell new products and 
to identify threats to GM's business, for example if gasoline 
prices soar or cities ban cars. 
</P>
<P>
	``If we can have Scotty beam us over, we may not need to have  
cars and trucks anymore. We need to watch those technologies that 
affect how transportation operates,'' said L. Delf Dodge, director 
of portfolio concepts. 
</P>
<P>
	Teams of five to seven people then brainstorm about what kind of  
vehicles would be necessary for any combination of future trends. 
They condense those ideas into a ``inspiration board'' -- a 7-foot 
tall collage of photos, drawings and mottos used to keep track of 
the idea. 
</P>
<P>
	GM has about 360 ideas, including ``Hi, I'm Jenny,'' floating  
around the center. ``Dot Com'' is a vehicle that provides audio 
books and educational programs through GM's OnStar service; 
``Matlock'' is a car for older drivers with easy access and 
controls. Its not just cars and trucks; there are also ideas for a 
commuter train, video games, even power plants. 
</P>
<P>
	From there, the teams refine the concepts by trying to match  
them to a GM brand. To broaden its reach, GM has come up with 
themes that it uses to separate its brands; the portfolio designers 
have turned these into life-size comic-book character cutouts that 
they use as a visual guide. Saturn is a midriff-baring girl on a 
skateboard, while Cadillac is a sleek black robot reminiscent of 
the ``Transformers'' cartoons. 
</P>
<P>
	Most of the ideas never move on to the next stage, where  
designers at GM's Corporate Brand Character Center fashion them 
into life-sized mockups and concept cars. 
</P>
<P>
	This year, GM will show off nine concept cars at major auto  
shows that have sprung from the portfolio center. One of them, the 
GMC Terradyne pickup, began as an idea called ``Work Truck'' aimed 
at men who need a utilitarian truck, said John Taylor, director of 
product design strategies. 
</P>
<P>
	``We thought, 'Well what about the bloke who really wants to do  
some work?''' Taylor said. ``He's been left behind here. He's 
forced to buy chrome and leather and 27 cupholders.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The result? A beveled, brawny machine that can be hosed out, but  
also includes a fold-down laptop computer, an extendable pickup bed 
and hidden side bins. 
</P>
<P>
	Designers say the Terradyne is a fair indicator of what GMC  
trucks will look like in a few years. Features of the other concept 
cars could also eventually hit the street. 
</P>
<P>
	Lawrence Burns, GM's vice president for research, development  
and planning, said the company's goal is to have half of its 
vehicles be innovative, either by creating a new type of car or 
truck, or offering a new feature. 
</P>
<P>
	Burns said a few years ago, less than 5 percent of GM's  
offerings would have fit that definition. 
</P>
<P>
	``As Peter Drucker says, it's really impossible to predict the  
future,'' Burns said, citing the well-known management consultant. 
``You should spend your time creating it.''

<HEADLINE> Mets' Henderson Knocks Teammate </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Rickey Henderson lashed out at a teammate Sunday  
for implying he's a quitter. 
</P>
<P>
	Henderson was removed for defense in the top of the eighth  
inning of Game 4 on Saturday, a 3-2 victory that kept the New York 
Mets alive in the NL championship series. 
</P>
<P>
	He did not comment after the game, bolting out of the clubhouse.  
Reliever Turk Wendell then questioned Henderson's work habits. 
</P>
<P>
	``If he doesn't respect me, then tough luck,'' Henderson said  
before Game 5 against the Atlanta Braves. ``He should be happy he's 
in this position. He wouldn't be here if not for me.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Manager Bobby Valentine and general manager Steve Phillips tried  
to defuse the dispute. Henderson was in the lineup, leading off and 
playing left field. 
</P>
<P>
	``Rickey was embarrassed,'' Phillips said. ``Bobby told him he  
had a brain cramp and screwed up. I think everything is over with 
now.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The problems started when Valentine decided to replace Henderson  
before the top of the eighth inning. However, the manager forgot to 
tell Henderson and Melvin Mora, his replacement. 
</P>
<P>
	After Henderson took his position, Valentine realized his  
oversight and sent Mora out to left field. Henderson apparently 
took this is a slight. 
</P>
<P>
	``The timing was very bad, particularly for a player of Rickey's  
stature,'' Valentine said. ``I expressed those concerns yesterday 
to him. ... Some of my coaches thought it was improper to take him 
out at that time. I believed my job is to do what's proper to win 
the game, regardless of timing.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Part of the mix-up might have happened because bench coach Bruce  
Benedict was coaching third base instead of sitting next to 
Valentine in the dugout. Regular third-base coach Cookie Rojas was 
serving the fourth game of a five-game suspension for bumping an 
umpire in the division series. 
</P>
<P>
	When Henderson returned to the dugout, he walked right by  
Valentine, who tried to explain his move. Valentine later 
apologized before Henderson left the stadium. 
</P>
<P>
	``He was man enough to come up to me and admit he made a  
mistake,'' Henderson said. 
</P>
<P>
	The Mets already have had to deal with a season full of  
controversies. Phillips fired three coaches in June following an 
eight-game losing streak, causing friction with Valentine. 
</P>
<P>
	Valentine nearly came to blows with outfielder Bobby Bonilla in  
the middle of one game. Valentine also came back to the Mets dugout 
in a disguise after being ejected in a game in June, leading to a 
two-game suspension. 
</P>
<P>
	The latest dispute came last week, when Valentine criticized his  
own players in Sports Illustrated. He told an interviewer: ``You're 
not dealing with real intelligent guys for the most part,'' and 
said five of the players were ``losers.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Controversy hasn't distracted our team all year,'' Phillips  
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Players also questioned Henderson's lack of effort running out  
balls at certain times of the year. But Valentine said their is no 
dissension on the team. 
</P>
<P>
	``The players I talked to are ready to go and to go with him,''  
Valentine said.

<HEADLINE> The Senate Holds Off Civil War </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The balance between North and South was at  
risk and Henry Clay of Kentucky, standing on the Senate floor, 
waved in the air a piece of George Washington's coffin. 
</P>
<P>
	The fragment had come to him unexpectedly, as a gift. Clay said  
its sudden appearance was an omen, ``a warning voice, coming from 
the grave to the Congress, to beware, to pause, to reflect ...'' 
</P>
<P>
	There was ample reason for reflection in Washington in the  
winter, spring and steamy summer of 1850, 11 years before what some 
called ``the irrepressible conflict'' between slave states and free 
states would lead to secession and explode into civil war. 
</P>
<P>
	The recent victory of U.S. troops in Mexico, and the vast new  
lands that had fallen to the United States, had brought the law of 
unintended consequences into full play. 
</P>
<P>
	America had believed the North-South balance between free and  
slave states settled with the Missouri Compromise of 1820. 
</P>
<P>
	But the Mexican War had threatened the balance, bringing in new  
lands stretching from Texas to California. And the question was 
back on the table: Should new territories enter the Union with 
slavery or without? 
</P>
<P>
	The cockpit of debate was the Senate chamber where a gilt eagle,  
suspended over the presiding officer's dais, glared at senators in 
their curving rows of mahogany desks. 
</P>
<P>
	``All is now uproar, confusion, menace to the existence of the  
Union,'' Clay told them on Feb. 5. 
</P>
<P>
	In the long, nerve-grating debate, lasting until September, a  
Southern senator aimed a pistol at a blustering Northerner. 
</P>
<P>
	Daniel Webster, premier orator of the day, was battered by waves  
of abuse from Northern abolitionists angered by his bid to mollify 
the South. 
</P>
<P>
	And flinty South Carolinian John C. Calhoun, gaunt, feeble and  
in the final month of his life, would not be moved. 
</P>
<P>
	The Union could not be preserved, he said, unless the rights of  
the South and its slaveholders were guaranteed in ``honor and 
safety.'' 
</P>
<P>
	On March 7, 1850, Webster opened with words that were once  
memorized by America's schoolchildren: ``I wish to speak today, not 
as a Massachusetts man, nor as a Northern man, but as an American 
... I speak today for the preservation of the Union. Hear me for my 
cause.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Senate chamber was filled to capacity. Many senators had  
given their seats to women who attended the 3 1/2-hour oration as if 
it were a play. 
</P>
<P>
	Webster's underlying point: If the South was to give way on  
territorial issues its grievances must be addressed. 
</P>
<P>
	But he scornfully dismissed the idea that the Union could ever  
be disbanded peacefully, without the most savage of civil wars. 
</P>
<P>
	``Your eyes and mine are destined never to see that miracle!''  
Webster thundered. 
</P>
<P>
	Six days later, on March 13, Calhoun spoke in the Senate for  
what was to be the last time. 
</P>
<P>
	He had been misunderstood; his purpose was to save the Union,  
not destroy it, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	But he saw the threat to its survival as coming not from the  
South but from the growing agitation of antislavery advocates in 
the North. He denounced Northern senators who echoed those views on 
the Senate floor. 
</P>
<P>
	``I will not be on good terms with those who wish to cut my  
throat,'' Calhoun said. He died in his nearby boarding house on 
March 31. 
</P>
<P>
	Clay made more than 70 speeches on behalf of an intricate  
compromise that, like the mechanism of a clock, would operate only 
if all of its parts were in place and in order. 
</P>
<P>
	Under its terms, California would join the Union as a free  
state; the debts of slaveholding Texas would be paid by the federal 
government; the territories of New Mexico and Utah would be 
organized with no encouragement to slavery; and, a strong Fugitive 
Slave Law would be enacted to return runaway slaves to bondage. 
</P>
<P>
	But the clockwork failed. The effort to pass an omnibus bill  
with so many working parts collapsed. 
</P>
<P>
	And then with Clay defeated, Calhoun dead and Webster in a new  
job as secretary of state, a fresh voice made itself heard. 
</P>
<P>
	Sen. Stephen A. Douglas of Illinois guessed that while there  
might not be a majority to pass Clay's compromise as a package 
there probably were majorities to approve each of its many parts. 
</P>
<P>
	``As soon as one section passed, Douglas brought up the next:  
Utah, Texas, California, New Mexico -- each territorial issue was 
finally settled,'' said Sen. Robert C. Byrd, D-W.Va., in an 
analysis written as a Senate speech in 1983. ``Just two weeks after 
Clay's omnibus bill had overturned, Douglas had hoisted it aright 
and enacted its various parts.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In the end, all that was won was time, important as that was.

<HEADLINE> South Pole Doctor Returning to U.S. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- The doctor who gave herself chemotherapy for a  
lump on her breast she discovered while at the South Pole said 
shortly before her rescue that she was anxious about her prognosis. 
</P>
<P>
	``I am sick and would like to go the hospital and learn my  
fate,'' Dr. Jerri Nielsen said in an e-mail exchange with Newsweek 
a few days before a daring air mission evacuated her from the U.S. 
National Science Foundation's South Pole research station. 
</P>
<P>
	Nielsen, from Youngstown, Ohio, was rescued Saturday by a crew  
from the New York Air National Guard's 109th Airlift Wing. 
</P>
<P>
	The 47-year-old discovered a lump in her breast in June, which  
is wintertime in the Antarctic. An air drop of medical supplies in 
July allowed her to begin treating herself with chemotherapy. 
</P>
<P>
	She performed her own biopsy and then e-mailed photographs of  
slide samples to doctors in the United States, Newsweek reported. 
At her request, the National Science Foundation has not released 
details of her diagnosis or condition. 
</P>
<P>
	But Newsweek, citing an Science Foundation source, reports in  
its October 25 issue that after Nielsen completed the first round 
of chemotherapy, doctors advised her to begin a second round. The 
magazine released a copy of the story Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	Temperatures finally thawed enough last week for a transport  
plane to land at the station, evacuate her and drop off another 
doctor to care for the 41 people living there. 
</P>
<P>
	Nielsen's sister-in-law, Diana Cahill, said Nielsen was flying  
to the United States on Sunday with her brothers, who met her at a 
stopover in New Zealand. 
</P>
<P>
	``The distance between she and the family, to not be able to  
physically comfort her, has been hard,'' said Cahill.

<HEADLINE> Sheppard's Son Ends 400-mile Walk </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CLEVELAND (AP) -- The son of Dr. Sam Sheppard completed a  
400-mile walk on Sunday that he started a month ago with the aim of 
preparing himself for trial of his wrongful imprisonment lawsuit 
against the state of Ohio. 
</P>
<P>
	Dr. Sheppard spent a decade in jail for the 1954 beating death  
of his wife, Marilyn, before a second jury acquitted him in a 
retrial. The sensational trial inspired a movie and ``The 
Fugitive'' television series. 
</P>
<P>
	His son, Sam Reese Sheppard, has been trying to clear his  
father's name and hold state officials responsible for what he 
calls a miscarriage of justice. 
</P>
<P>
	``Forty-five years ago today, tonight, my dad sat in jail in  
this county to go to trial tomorrow for his life,'' Sheppard said. 
``To go to trial in which the state of Ohio charged him with a 
capital crime and wanted to execute him. I believe that is an act 
of terrorism.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Sheppard spoke from the steps of the Cuyahoga County Courthouse  
steps where he ended the journey he started Sept. 18 at the U.S. 
Supreme Court in Washington. 
</P>
<P>
	Sheppard had planned the walk months ago to coincide with the  
start of his trial. But the case was postponed from Monday to Jan. 
31 so county prosecutors could have time to analyze DNA samples 
from Mrs. Sheppard and the fetus she was carrying when she was 
killed. County Prosecutor William Mason had their bodies exhumed 
Oct. 5 to prepare for the civil trial. 
</P>
<P>
	``The walk was originally planned so I'd be here in Cleveland  
mentally and emotionally ready to go to trial,'' Sheppard said. 
``But the county prosecutors office decided to exhume my mother's 
body at the last minute. A last minute effort to delay the trial.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Sheppard, 7 when his mother was slain, contends the real killer  
was a man who washed the family's windows. He died while in prison 
for another murder.
