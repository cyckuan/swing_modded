STATE PROGRAM CREATES PRESCRIPTION DRUG `BUYING CLUB' 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By ROBERT L. JAMIESON JR.  
 c.2000 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ In a move to combat the skyrocketing cost of medicine,
Gov. Gary Locke Tuesday announced a new program to slash the price
of prescription drugs by nearly half for people 55 and older.
</P>
<P>
   The program, called AWARDS, would take effect in January, and it
would extend privileges to members of a ``buying club'' for
prescription drugs: a laminated discount card as well as price
breaks, ranging from 12 percent to 49 percent.
</P>
<P>
   ``The state of Washington is like a Costco,'' Locke said,
referring to the giant warehouse retailer. ``We want to expand the
membership.''
</P>
<P>
   Speaking at a press briefing Tuesday at the Redmond Senior
Center, where he unveiled the plan, Locke added: ``Tens of
thousands of older Washington citizens need one or more
prescription drugs to stay healthy ... yet the cost of these drugs
is skyrocketing, and fewer seniors can afford them.''
</P>
<P>
   News of the program, which officials anticipate will be used by
as many as 275,000 people in its fledgling period, was applauded by
lawmakers and senior citizens who were gathered at the center.
</P>
<P>
   Lobbying groups representing elderly issues also were sanguine.
They praised Locke for using the state's buying power to leverage
discounts for pharmaceuticals _ a lifeline that is important, they
said, because federal Medicare does not cover prescription drugs.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's excellent the state and Gov. Locke is stepping
in, considering Congress' failure to enact drug benefits under
Medicare,' said Will Parry, president of the Puget Sound Council of
Senior Citizens.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a positive, progessive step that will be welcomed by
every senior with a prescription drug bill,'' the 80-year-old
advocate said.
</P>
<P>
   But one of Locke's Republican opponents for governor, John
Carlson, dismissed Tuesday's announcement as politically motivated.
</P>
<P>
   ``Why did Gary Locke neglect this problem for three and a half
years?'' Carlson said through a spokeswoman. ``At first glance, the
benefits appear exaggerated.''
</P>
<P>
   Locke said his office has been working on the program for
months. He was introduced at the press conference by state Rep.
Laura Ruderman of Redmond, a democrat, who said that rising
medication costs are ``a real issue'' _ not just campaign fodder.
</P>
<P>
   Regardless of political affiliation, several people Tuesday
agreed that pharmaceutical costs are high _ and that something
needs to be done.
</P>
<P>
   A study released this month by Families USA, an advocacy group,
said Americans 65 and older pay an average of $1,205 a year for
prescriptions _ up from $559 in 1992. By 2010, the cost will rise
to $2,810, according to the study.
</P>
<P>
   For Nancy Stephens, of Sumner, who currently pays $1,100 and
more each month for nearly one dozen drugs, Locke's plan was
welcome news. Already, she said she struggles to pay for her
medication, relying on contribution from church members and using
her Visa card ``which is running out.''
</P>
<P>
   And it is people such as Stephens who Locke and his advisors had
in mind when they decided, months ago, to tackle the issue of
prescription drug costs. In recent weeks, the topic has become the
focus of sharp debate in the presidential race.
</P>
<P>
   Other states offer subsidy programs for presciption drugs; but
Washington state was beset by unique circumstances that called for
a creative solution: double-digit inflation in healthcare and a
spending cap of Intiative 601.
</P>
<P>
   The governor's office looked to Merck Medco, a pharmaceutical
benefits company, which negotiates medication discounts for state
employees under the Uniformed Medical Plan.
</P>
<P>
   And the state leveraged its buying power to get discounts, which
now will be extended to pharmaceutical buyers.
</P>
<P>
   Under Locke's plan seniors will pay a membership fee annually of
$15 for an individual and $25 for a family. Beginning in January,
they wil be able to call an 800 number for application materials.
</P>
<P>
   Later, they will get a membership card, which will enable them
to go to their doctor and get their prescription. If they go to the
window of a participating pharmacy, they will get discounts ranging
from 12 percent to 30 percent.
</P>
<P>
   If they use a mail service, they would be able to get an even
bigger discount _ 20 percent to 49 percent. The ultimate size of
the discount will be determined by the buyer's pharmeceutical
needs.
</P>
<P>
   For drugs such as Lipitor, which treats high cholesterol and
sells retail for $97.59, a buyer would pay $85.88 after a 12
percent savings.
</P>
<P>
   Faith Homan, political director of Washington CItizen Action, a
group that has pressed for change, said Locke's move was ``a good
first step.''
</P>
<P>
   But she said provisions also need to be made for other groups
who could benefit from discount prescription drugs: uninsured
people under 55 years old, uninsured families and disabled people.
</P>
<P>
   State officials said Tuesday that after they start the discount
program, they will look at ways to leverage that state's purchase
of drugs into savings that can benefit others.

SELECTIVE DISCLOSURE CAN HELP THE MARKET 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JERRY HEASTER  
 c. 2000 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Securities regulators, investors and corporate executives have
learned yet again, in the harshest way possible, that they have
much greater problems than what's known in the trade as selective
disclosure.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this month the Securities and Exchange Commission
approved a rule barring companies from sharing important tidbits
with favored analysts and investors before making public disclosure
of the information. The idea is to prevent heavy hitters from
profiting at the expense of the little guys as the stock market
increasingly becomes the province of small investors.
</P>
<P>
   The advent of worker capitalism, online trading and
lightning-fast dissemination of fact and rumor on the Internet has
made regulators more sensitive to the need to protect the investing
public. It's a notion that sounds good in theory, although in
reality it's arguable whether the little guys should be playing the
same game as the big guys.
</P>
<P>
   The investors the SEC is mostly trying to protect are for the
most part those who shouldn't be trading, but rather buying and
holding stock in companies with promising prospects. Or, perhaps
even better, they should be buying and holding mutual funds with
solid records of investment performance.
</P>
<P>
   As it turns out, however, the potential for Internet abuse
transcends the issue of traditional give-and-take of material
information. A brutal reminder of this fact of life came Friday
when a bogus news release concerning Emulex Corp. was posted online
on an obscure business news wire. It falsely warned of an impending
earnings restatement from profit to heavy loss.
</P>
<P>
   The story was picked up by the major financial newswires, and
Emulex's stock fell 60 percent, wiping out nearly $2.5 billion of
the company's market value before the hoax was revealed. The stock
did manage to recover most of its loss, closing 6.5 percent lower
for the day.
</P>
<P>
   When a stock can be clobbered this badly by a fraudulent news
release, it would seem that selective disclosure may not be as
threatening as regulators perceive. In fact, it might even serve as
a useful filter for financial intelligence.
</P>
<P>
   If, for instance, the system allowed early briefings for a
favored few, a fraudulent press release might be recognized as such
more quickly. In a world in which the analyst community has early
access to information, revelations create a buzz about companies
experiencing untoward developments. Thus, if word of an untoward
event appears without warning on the Net, it might be viewed as
suspect in the absence of any Wall Street buzz about the company.
</P>
<P>
   A generation ago, one of the big debates among Wall Streeters
concerned the so-called efficient markets hypothesis. According to
the theory, stock prices always reflect the knowledge and
expectations of all market players. Thus, nobody has an edge and
it's impossible to beat the market by finding undervalued stocks.
</P>
<P>
   Given the Internet's ability to communicate info-garbage as well
as straight poop, too much efficiency may prove a dangerous thing.
The best way to counter this threat will no doubt be a subject of
intense debate. Meanwhile, it's possible that too democratic an
information marketplace may work against the little guys rather
than for them.

DE LA HOYA FILES SUIT TO SEPARATE FROM ARUM
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By MICHAEL ROSENTHAL  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   The eight-year relationship between Oscar De La Hoya and Bob
Arum, one of the most successful promoter-boxer teams in history,
could be over.
</P>
<P>
   De La Hoya announced Tuesday he has sued Arum in an attempt to
end their contract three years before it expires. A statement says
flatly that the relationship is ``terminated.''
</P>
<P>
   Arum, angry and defiant, responded by hiring his own attorney
and plans to sue De La Hoya for breech of contract. He also
questioned the integrity of the East L.A. fighter.
</P>
<P>
   De La Hoya said he was upset over published comments made by
Arum suggesting the fighter should retire.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was very surprised and disappointed by Bob's recent comments
to the press stating that I should retire from boxing,'' the
statement said. ``I am as committed to boxing as I ever have
been.''
</P>
<P>
   De La Hoya's attorney, Stephen Espinoza, also told The
Associated Press that the contract was ``negotiated at a stage of
his career where he gave up way too much.''
</P>
<P>
   The suit alleges other ``numerous legal and contractual
violations'' but doesn't name them.
</P>
<P>
   De La Hoya tried to buy out his contract offering Arum
``millions,'' the promoter said _ but Arum didn't bite. He doesn't
plan to let De La Hoya go so easily.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm going to fight this tooth and nail,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   One, he said he never intended to push De La Hoya into
retirement. He said he merely suggested he will support De La Hoya
if the fighter decides to pursue his fledgling singing career full
time.
</P>
<P>
   And, two, he believes Espinoza's objection to the contract has
no merit because it has been renegotiated more than once, most
recently in June of 1997.
</P>
<P>
   ``They had to find a scapegoat and the scapegoat is me,'' said
Arum, referring to the fact De La Hoya has lost his last two big
fights and some of his earning power. ``Oscar has a character flaw:
He has no loyalty. He does everything for convenience without
taking responsibility for himself.''
</P>
<P>
   Arum said failed negotiations for a rematch with Shane Mosley _
who outpointed De La Hoya in June _ are at least partly responsible
for the fighter's actions.
</P>
<P>
   De La Hoya demanded at least $15 million for the rematch _ the
same amount he made in the first fight, even though he lost, Arum
said. Arum offered to guarantee both fighters $10 million.
</P>
<P>
   ``It doesn't make sense,'' Arum said of De La Hoya's demands.
</P>
<P>
   Arum didn't discount the possibility the two sides could resolve
their differences and again work together, ``but there might not be
as much affection as their was before.''
</P>
<P>
   Mosley is caught in the crossfire. He and De La Hoya were
negotiating to fight Jan. 20 and De La Hoya said he still hopes it
will happen.
</P>
<P>
   However, it doesn't seem possible until his dispute with Arum is
settled because they are part of a three-way contract with HBO. De
La Hoya can't fight on HBO without Arum or on a rival network as
long as the contract remains valid or all sides agree.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, Mosley probably will fight Arturo Gatti on Dec. 16
at Madison Square Garden.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's what it looks like,'' said Norman Horton, Mosley's
publicist. &QL;

&HT;    WHITES NOW MINORITY IN STATE
</HEADLINE>
(For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BILL HILLBURG 
c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News 
<TEXT>
 &LR;
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Under a wave of immigration from Latin America and
Asia, the population of non-Latino whites in California fell below
50 &UR;  &LR; percent in 1999 for the first time since the Gold Rush, the
U.S. Census Bureau reported today.
</P>
<P>
   The statewide numbers showing minorities had become the majority
last year reflects what already occurred in Los Angeles County and
the rest of Southern California where the non-Latino white
population continued its decline last year. Statewide, whites were
49.8 &UR;  &LR; percent of the population in 1999, down from 57 &UR;  &LR; percent in
1990.
</P>
<P>
   The bureau's report, based on 1990 census data and estimates
compiled as of July 1, 1999, attributed the demographic shifts to a
massive influx of legal and illegal immigrants and the relocation
of many white Californians to Nevada and other Western states.
</P>
<P>
   The new study estimated that Los Angeles County had a net gain
of 454,672 residents in the 1990s, a 5 &UR;  &LR; percent increase. That
included net gains of 724,089 Latinos, or 23 &UR;  &LR; percent, and 248,626
Asian-Pacific Islanders, or 25 &UR;  &LR; percent.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, the county lost 521,473 white residents, or
14 &UR;  &LR; percent. African-Americans posted a gain of 4,153, or
0.4 &UR;  &LR; percent.
</P>
<P>
   Overall, whites account for 33.1 &UR;  &LR; percent of the county
population, Latinos 41.6 &UR;  &LR; percent, Asians 13.4 &UR;  &LR; percent and
African-Americans 11.2 &UR;  &LR; percent.
</P>
<P>
   ``California gets 40 &UR;  &LR; percent of all the immigrants in the
U.S.,'' said Larry Sink, a Census Bureau statistician who compiled
the report.
</P>
<P>
   ``And there has also been a tremendous migration out of the
state. Californians are fueling the boom we see in Nevada, Arizona,
Colorado, Washington and Oregon.''
</P>
<P>
   The latest census estimates provide a preview of the results of
the 2000 census, which will be released in late December. Since the
1990 census, the bureau has compiled yearly estimated updates,
based on birth and death rates and other factors, for use by
government agencies, businesses and researchers.
</P>
<P>
   In the six-county Los Angeles region, only Riverside and San
Bernardino counties -- which drew many newcomers in search of
afforda recorded net gains of white residents during the 1990s.
White declines were also reported for Orange, Santa Barbara and
Ventura counties.
</P>
<P>
   Every county in the region reported sizable increases of Latinos
and Asian-Pacific Islanders.
</P>
<P>
   The Southern California trends were mirrored statewide.
California gained nearly 3.2 million residents, or nearly 11
percent, while the state's white population fell by 563,000, or 3
percent.
</P>
<P>
   There were 16.5 million whites in 1999 among the overall
population of 33.1 million, a 10.6 percent increase in the decade,
while the Latino population reached 31.5 percent and the Asian 12
percent. The population of African-Americans and American Indians
increased slightly, with African-Americans accounting for 7.5
percent of the state's people.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a trend that has been building for years,'' said
Reynaldo Baca, a University of Southern California sociologist who
specializes in Mexican immigration and immigrant education.
</P>
<P>
   ``It has great implications for California. These are the people
who will be our future tax base, work force and the student bodies
of our universities. We need to invest in that future now.
</P>
<P>
   ``I realize that this is not the America that many people
envisioned. And there has often been a nativist response to
newcomers. But I see great hope. These newcomers will relay the
pillars of our civilization because they believe in the future and
in hard work.''
</P>
<P>
   The Census Bureau's latest findings tracked with a March report
by the agency, which studied domestic migration to and from
California and other states between 1990 to 1999. It estimated a
net 7.3 percent loss for the state due to migration to other
states. During the same period, the study estimated that California
experienced a net 7.6 percent gain in residents born outside the
United States.
</P>
<P>
   Domestic migration out of California, which peaked during the
height of the post-Cold War recession in 1993-94, was more
pronounced in Los Angeles County.
</P>
<P>
   Los Angeles County's estimated 1999 population of 9.3 million is
larger than some nations, including Sweden with 8.9 million and the
Dominican Republic with 8.4 million.
</P>
<P>
   If the county were a nation, it would rank 82nd on the Census
Bureau's population list of 227 world nations. And, if the
six-county Southern California region were a country, its total
estimated population of 15 million would place it 62nd on the
bureau's list.
</P>
<P>
   Sink noted that tracking race data will become much more
complicated for the bureau under new rules enacted for the 2000
census. For the first time, persons of mixed-race heritage were
allowed to list that information on their census forms.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've got 32 possible combinations for race,'' said Sink. ``We
are still trying to determine how we'll compile and report that
information.''

BABY DIES AS CAR PLOWS INTO BANK
</HEADLINE>

 &HT;    (Corrects driver's age to 91 years.) (For use by NYTimes News Service clients)

<TEXT>
 &LR;
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ A 1-year-old boy was killed and four other people
injured Tuesday when a 91-year-old motorist accidentally hit the
accelerator instead of the brake and smashed into a Bank of America
branch in Sylmar, authorities said.
</P>
<P>
   The driver, Val Conrad, who renewed his license just six days
ago, was backing out of a handicapped space at the bank about 11
a.m. when he sent his station wagon plowing through the plate glass
doors and across the bank, police said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The baby was sitting with two men and a woman on a couch
inside the bank when the car hit them,'' said Capt. Greg Meyer of
the Los Angeles Police Department's Valley Traffic Division. ``It's
a real tragedy here.''
</P>
<P>
   The child was identified as Nathaniel Escodero, according to the
Los Angeles County Coroner's Office.
</P>
<P>
   Three other bank patrons, along with Conrad, were treated for
minor injuries at area hospitals, Meyer said. Their identities were
not immediately available.
</P>
<P>
   ``He lost control for reasons we have yet to determine,'' he
said. ``He came out of the parking spot at a high rate of speed and
through to the other side of the bank.''
</P>
<P>
   The boy was in the bank with his grandmother and 8-year-old
brother, but neither of them was injured, Meyer said.
</P>
<P>
   Patrons in the bank said the lobby was busy with lunchtime
customers when the crash occurred.
</P>
<P>
   ``Suddenly glass was flying everywhere and people were
screaming, running and crying,'' said 24-year-old Sylmar resident
Ray Moreno who was inside the bank making a deposit during his
lunch break.
</P>
<P>
   ``I saw people get hit and thrown out of the way. Then I heard
the grandmother screaming for her kid,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Moreno said he found the child unconscious, wedged beneath the
rear of Conrad's car and the couch he'd been sitting on. Moreno
also said Conrad looked confused by what had occurred.
</P>
<P>
   ``He pretty much didn't know what was going on, he just asked
what happened,'' he said. ``I even saw him backing out of the
parking spot. Next thing you know he didn't stop -- he just didn't
stop.''
</P>
<P>
   The crash remains under investigation.
</P>
<P>
   ``If the detectives feel there's a chargeable offense, they'll
recommend that,'' said Los Angeles police Sgt. John Amott. ``But
ultimately that is up to the city attorney or the District
Attorney's Office.''
</P>
<P>
   Conrad has no crashes or tickets on his record, according to DMV
records.
</P>
<P>
   The Sylmar man was driving with a valid California license
issued Thursday, according to the Department of Motor Vehicles. His
license was restricted to driving only between sunrise and sunset,
with no freeway driving allowed, the technician said.
</P>
<P>
   Isabelle Conrad, Conrad's wife of 46 years, said her husband had
been told in the past that he shouldn't drive because of his
health, specifically because of his diabetes, she said.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was going out to get a haircut and do some shopping
today,'' she said. ``I was worried. They told him he isn't supposed
to drive. But he's a pretty good driver.''
</P>
<P>
   Meyer said his investigators will ask the DMV to review Conrad's
driving license.
</P>
<P>
   ``The bigger issue here is that as we get older, I think it's
well-established that our motor skills deteriorate,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's difficult because people don't want to give up their
independence, but the reality is they've got to make a mature
decision and realize their driving abilities.''
</P>
<P>
   Coincidently, the Legislature sent Gov. Gray Davis a bill that
would require the DMV to toughen rules for licensing certain
California drivers. The Brandi Joy Mitock Safe Drivers Act -- SB
335 -- would force the DMV to give road, written and vision tests
to motorists determined unsafe by police, doctors or family
members.
</P>
<P>
   The legislation, sponsored by state Sen. Tom Hayden, D-Los
Angeles, was sparked by the 1998 hit-and-run death of 15-year-old
Woodland Hills resident Brandi Joy Mitock by a 96-year-old driver
who had been suffering strokes for four years prior.
</P>
<P>
   ``The bill is a reaffirmation of the Legislature's desire to
establish safer driving measures for all Californians,'' said
Brandi Joy's father, Mark Mitock. ``Had our bill been in place a
few years ago, who knows who we might have saved.''

   LOS ANGELES _ Los Angeles Unified students improved on the SAT
college entrance exam, with Van Nuys High School and School
claiming the district's top scores, according to results released
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Districtwide, average math scores rose 10 points to 457 and
verbal scores rose six points to 439 over last year, but both were
still far below state and national averages. For the second time in
three years, Van Nuys had the highest average scores for both math
and verbal, with a combined 1,095 out of 1,600.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's fantastic,'' said Herm Clay, principal of Van Nuys,
which averaged 536 on the verbal SAT and 559 on the math SAT.
``We've always been a high-performing school on SATs and it's very
gratifying to continue to have the best scores in the district.''
</P>
<P>
   Greater San Fernando Valley Area suburban schools in Ventura
County, Las Virgenes, Santa Clarita and Glendale districts
continued to beat the state and national averages although Glendale
scores fell this schools had mixed results.
</P>
<P>
   Of seven schools in Los Angeles Unified that scored above the
national average in math, six were in the Valley. Besides Van Nuys,
they were El Camino Real (556), Sherman Oaks Center for Enriched
Studies (514), Chatsworth (515), Taft (516) and Granada Hills
(527).
</P>
<P>
   The scores released Tuesday by the New York-based College Board,
which administers the test, pleased Los Angeles Unified officials,
who have been struggling to overcome classroom and teacher
shortages wh academic standards.
</P>
<P>
   Statewide, the average verbal score was 497, unchanged from the
previous two years. The state's math average increased four points
to 518. Nationwide, verbal scores stayed steady at 505 while math
scores rose three points to 514.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've improved at a faster rate than either the state or the
nation,'' said Gordon Wohlers, associate superintendent of
planning, assessment and research.
</P>
<P>
   He attributed the increases, which followed incremental changes
during the past several years, to ``a strong focus on academic
performance that started five or six years ago'' under
then-Superintendent Sid Thompson.
</P>
<P>
   ``Having said that, we've got a long way to go to catch up to
the mean (scores) on both the state and the national level.''
</P>
<P>
   Wohlers said the fact that the district has been coping with
worsening teacher and classroom shortages underscores the
significance of the improved scores.
</P>
<P>
   ``It means that we're rising above some of the hurdles,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Elsewhere, scores continued to rise for districts outside Los
Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   Ventura County schools scored above the state and national
averages for the sixth year in a row, and scores for Las Virgenes
Unified were its highest ever.
</P>
<P>
   In the Las Virgenes district, students at Agoura High earned a
combined average of 1,144 while those at Calabasas High posted
1,149 -- the best ever, said assistant superintendent of education
Jim Christianson.
</P>
<P>
   In Santa Clarita, average SAT scores posted by local high school
students fell slightly, but still surpassed state and national
averages, according to results released Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   In the William S. Hart Union School District, the average score
was 551 in math, down by three points from last year, and 526 in
the verbal portion, down by two points.
</P>
<P>
   In Burbank and Glendale, nearly all schools saw declines in
verbal and math scores.
</P>
<P>
   In the Glendale Unified School District, Blue Ribbon award
winner Crescenta Valley High School showed the greatest drop. The
school's verbal score slid 23 points to 516, while its math scores
plummeted 18 points to 571. Glendale High School posted the only
gains, improving seven points to achieve 534 on the math section.
</P>
<P>
   Glendale Unified School District officials attributed the poor
performance to greater numbers of students taking the exam. This
year, 1,007 students took the exam compared with 895 students last
year. At Crescenta Valley, 11 percent more students took the test.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're happy that the number of students tested is up but we
did drop a little in the performance area,'' said Donald Empey,
Glendale Unified's assistant superintendent.
</P>
<P>
   At John Burroughs High School in Burbank, verbal scores dropped
by 10 points to 487 while marks in math went up seven points to
504. Though more students took the test, the group made up a
smaller percentage than the previous year.
</P>
<P>
   ``That concerns me,'' said Caroline Brumm, coordinator of
Burbank Unified's student and program evaluation. ``Our (scores)
are pretty stable but I'd like to see them increase.

<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBUQUERQUE, N.M. _ Vice President Al Gore kept his campaign
focused on health care Tuesday by emphasizing his plan for
providing access to coverage for the country's 11 million uninsured
children.
</P>
<P>
   Gore's plan, for insuring all children by 2005, relies primarily
on an expansion of the Children's Health Insurance Program, or
CHIP, an initiative that has provided coverage, with modest
premiums, for about 2 million children since its enactment in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   The program now covers children in families with incomes up to
200 percent of the poverty level, and Gore would raise that ceiling
to 250 percent, or to about $41,000 for a family of four.
</P>
<P>
   ``We need to cover every single child within this next
presidential term,'' Gore said, addressing a group of parents and
health care workers that had been gathered by his campaign in a
park here.
</P>
<P>
   New Mexico is a swing state that was carried by President
Clinton in 1992 and 1996. Before then it had voted for the
Republican nominee in six consecutive presidential elections.
</P>
<P>
   Access to health insurance is a serious problem in the state,
where 14 percent of poor children are uninsured, the sixth-highest
proportion of any state, according to the Census Bureau. The
problem is particularly severe among Latinos and American Indians,
and Gore laced his comments Tuesday with Spanish phrases.
</P>
<P>
   The Democratic nominee had little to say about his Republican
rival, Gov. George W. Bush of Texas. But, in what has become a
regular feature of his policy discussions, he closed his remarks by
challenging Bush to issue a detailed plan.
</P>
<P>
   ``Presently he has not presented any plan to address this
problem,'' Gore said of children's health coverage, ``but there is
still time, even before Labor Day, to offer these specifics.''
</P>
<P>
   Dan Bartlett, a spokesman for Bush, called Gore's claim
``inaccurate,'' and said Gore should explain why the number of
uninsured children had increased by more than 2 million during the
Clinton-Gore years.
</P>
<P>
   Bush, Bartlett said, has put forth a plan to provide a tax
credit of up to $2,000 for premiums on health insurance policies
bought by families with incomes of $30,000 or less. Families
earning $30,000 to $60,000 would qualify for a smaller credit.
</P>
<P>
   Sarah Bianchi, a Gore policy adviser, said the Bush credit would
not be large enough to help many families buy insurance in the
private market.
</P>
<P>
   Gore's proposals, which would increase access for both poor
children and their parents, would cost an estimated $95 billion
over 10 years. The CHIP program relies on states to sign up
eligible children. The state and federal governments share the
cost, with the federal government paying most of it.
</P>
<P>
   The proposal to raise the income ceiling for CHIP coverage is
the centerpiece of Gore's plans to move incrementally toward a
system of universal health coverage. That incremental approach, he
has said, reflects the lessons learned from Clinton's failed
efforts to insure all Americans in one vast restructuring of the
American health care system.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want to make it clear that the proposals that I'm announcing
here do not represent a complete solution to every problem in
health care,'' Gore said. ``The approach that I'm recommending is
the step-by-step approach, paso a paso, so that we move toward
universal health insurance for all.''
</P>
<P>
   In the Democratic primaries, Gore's opponent, former Sen. Bill
Bradley, criticized his reliance on the CHIP program, because it
has had difficulty enrolling all eligible children. Currently an
estimated 7 million children eligible for CHIP are not enrolled.
</P>
<P>
   Gore acknowledged that shortcoming Tuesday, but placed blame for
it on states that, he said, ``put up barriers to participation''
because they ``don't really want to put their own money into the
program, and so they make it difficult for families to
participate.''
</P>
<P>
   Some governors, noted Bartlett, the Bush spokesman, have
attributed the problem to a lack of flexibility in federal
regulations.
</P>
<P>
   Gore has outlined a series of measures intended to lower what he
called the ``cultural barriers'' to enrolling in CHIP. Those
measures include simplifying applications for coverage, eliminating
asset tests that sometimes intimidate eligible families, requiring
states to change their minimum eligibility periods to a year from
six months, and allowing families to apply by mail instead of in
person.
</P>
<P>
   The vice president would also allow families with incomes above
the higher CHIP ceiling that he proposes to buy insurance for their
children, through either CHIP or Medicaid. Those families would
have to pay a full premium, but the financial burden would be
reduced somewhat if they applied for Gore's proposed 25 percent tax
credit on health insurance premiums.
</P>
<P>
   Another Gore proposal would extend CHIP coverage to the 7
million uninsured parents of children who are eligible for either
CHIP or Medicaid. Some 85 percent of the parents of eligible
children are not insured, according to Gore aides.
</P>
<P>
   Under Gore's plan, states could set their own eligibility levels
but would receive federal matching funds for those parents they
enroll. If health coverage for parents is provided, Gore reasons,
families will be more likely to seek coverage for their children as
well.

 &UR; CABLE:  &LR; By all accounts, AT&AMP;T's efforts to sell local phone service
in California three years ago was a disaster. Thousands of
residential customers had to wait weeks to be switched over from
Pacific Bell, partly because of glitches in Pac Bell's order

it was forced to pay so much to Pac Bell, which controls the local

INVESTIGATIONS BEGIN INTO ALLEGED VIOLATION AT USC
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By SCOTT WOLF  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ The NCAA and Pacific-10 Conference have launched
separate investigations into allegations that a USC assistant
basketball coach offered money to a junior college coach to secure
a player.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are investigating this issue with the cooperation of USC
and the NCAA has also begun an investigation,'' said Pac-10
assistant commissioner Jim Muldoon. ``It appears the NCAA
investigation has already started.''
</P>
<P>
   Pac-10 assistant commissioner for enforcement Dan Coonan was out
of his office Tuesday, interviewing some of those involved in the
case. It's customary for the Pac-10 to enlist the assistance of a
member school when conducting an investigations. The findings would
then be forwarded to the NCAA.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, Southern Idaho coach Derek Zeck said USC assistant
Dave Miller offered him money during a summer camp at Cal State
Northridge to land 6-foot-7 forward Jerry Dupree.
</P>
<P>
   ``He said, `I'll write you a check to donate to your booster
club to recruit and get Jerry,'`` Zeck said. ``I said `I don't do
that.'''
</P>
<P>
   USC coach Henry Bibby said the allegations were ``totally
false,'' and added ``neither I nor anyone on my staff offered any
money to Mr. Zeck while we were recruiting Mr. Dupree.''
</P>
<P>
   According to sources, USC and Southern Idaho coaches have had an
antagonistic relationship for some time, stemming from problems
obtaining Dupree's transcripts. &QL;

BATTERIES, BOXES AND LOWER PHONE BILLS  &HT;     BY TODD WALLACK
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
Is phone service any different via cable lines? The answer: Not
much.
<P>
   ``Basically it works,'' said Robert Lee, a Fremont resident and
quality assurance agent for the Internal Revenue Service, who uses
AT&AMP;T cable lines for his local phone service.
</P>
<P>
   One subtle wrinkle is that AT&AMP;T gives customers shoe-box-size
batteries, normally placed in the garage, with enough juice to
power the phones for eight hours during a blackout. Telephone
service, by contrast, normally has backup batteries and generators
hooked to the network.
</P>
<P>
   But AT&AMP;T spokesman Andrew Johnson said the company is building
power supplies into the network in future towns, just like
traditional phone service. ``The battery made customers question
whether they should make the change,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   AT&AMP;T also installs boxes on the side of homes to connect the
cable wires to customers' internal telephone wiring. That way
customers can plug their handset into the usual phone jack.
</P>
<P>
   To be sure, there have been bugs:
</P>
<P>
   _Billing errors. Howard Underwood, a Fremont attorney, said AT&AMP;T
routinely bills him for free local calls at local toll rates of 5
cents a minute. Underwood said the problem occurred during three of
the last four months.
</P>
<P>
   _Voice mail. About 600 customers in the San Ramon area lost
voice mail access for three days earlier this year.
</P>
<P>
   _Occasional outages. One customer noticed the phone service
recently went dead for two hours.
</P>
<P>
   But Johnson said the company has ironed out most of the glitches
and, to be fair, Pacific Bell has also been fraught with its own
problems. And just to reassure customers, AT&AMP;T has promised to give
customers a mobile phone in case of an outage. (AT&AMP;T said it has
stashed away enough phones to handle any routine glitch, though not
a major disaster _ like an earthquake _ that shuts down the entire
network.)
</P>
<P>
   Several customers also reported good luck with the customer
service. ``The call times were short and they solved the problem on
the first call three out of four times,'' Lee said. The fourth
time, he said, AT&AMP;T called him back twice to answer his question.
</P>
<P>
   AT&AMP;T has also offered customers strong incentives in the past to
sign up. Lee said the company gave him a month's free service and
knocked $50 off his cable bill. Underwood got $150 to try it for
three months.
</P>
<P>
   But both said they stuck with AT&AMP;T because of the lower monthly
bills. Lee said AT&AMP;T's service includes a wider calling area for
free calls; he now pays $20 per month for AT&AMP;T versus $30 for Pac
Bell. Also, AT&AMP;T service is cheaper for multiple lines.
</P>
<P>
   Neither reported installation problems, though Johnson said Pac
Bell still takes longer than AT&AMP;T would prefer to transfer
customer's phone numbers.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson said AT&AMP;T can install a phone line with a new number in
three days, but the process takes seven to 10 days to transfer
existing Pac Bell customers who want to keep their number. Johnson
also said the company wishes it could complete installations on
Sunday, but Pac Bell technicians do not handle orders that day.
</P>
<P>
   Pac Bell spokesman Bill Mashek, however, insists it takes three
business days to switch over a phone number. He said Pac Bell can't
move faster because of industry rules.
</P>
<P>
   Regardless, some local customers said they are benefiting so far
from the battle. Dan Calic, best known as the founder of a Fremont
AtHome users group, which tracks AT&AMP;T's cable Internet service,
estimates he saved $90 on installation and other fees by signing up
for AT&AMP;T's phone service for two lines.
</P>
<P>
   ``I jumped at the opportunity,'' Calic said. ``I haven't had any
glitches and the quality of the reception has been fine.''

STOCK LOSSES FOR SPRINT EXECUTIVES HAVE BEEN HUGE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)

 c. 2000 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   (Eds. please note: This is a sidebar to SPRINT-FUTURE.)
</P>
<P>
   KANSAS CITY, Mo. _ Another day, another 10 million dollars.
</P>
<P>
   That is the average Sprint Corp. Chief Executive William T.
Esrey has lost on the value of his Sprint securities every day
since July 13, when Sprint and WorldCom Inc. called off their
proposed merger in the face of opposition from regulators in the
United States and in Europe.
</P>
<P>
   The day after Sprint and WorldCom gave up on their $129 billion
merger, Sprint's stock ticked up slightly. The next day it started
a decline that has seen it drop to levels it had not seen in two
years.
</P>
<P>
   Shares and options Esrey received that were worth more than $700
million at the merger price, even after accounting for the average
price Esrey had to pay for the shares, were worth about $244
million at Tuesday's stock close of $32.56 for Sprint FON shares
and $48.06 for Sprint PCS shares, a loss of more than $472 million.
</P>
<P>
   Esrey is not alone, of course. Most Sprint employees have stock,
and then there are the rest of the shareholders. The company's
capitalization, the value of all Sprint FON shares and PCS shares,
dropped to $73.5 billion, compared with the $115 billion WorldCom
was going to pay, not counting the $14 billion in debt it would
have assumed.
</P>
<P>
   Sprint's tracking stock for PCS traded Tuesday at 28 percent off
its 52-week high of $66.94 on March 31.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is not much to say. The disappointment of the failed
merger lingers,'' said Tom Burnett of Merger Insight, a research
firm for institutional investors.
</P>
<P>
   Sprint's broadband and Internet assets are strong, and its local
telephone service is solid, but until the market decides what
Sprint can earn independently, its stock will suffer, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I had to guess, I would say it is within 10 percent of a
tradable bottom,'' Burnett said.

SPRINT'S PRESIDENT LOOKS AT THE COMPANY'S FUTURE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)

 c. 2000 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   KANSAS CITY, Mo. _ ...double hit to Sprint's stock.
</P>
<P>
   Many analysts still like Sprint. They say it is innovative and
has a motivated work force and some strong assets, particularly its
wireless and local phone services. But they say that several
factors tied to the failed merger raise questions about Sprint's
ability to move forward.
</P>
<P>
   One is the loss of more than half a dozen top executives. A
provision of the Sprint stock option program allowed options that
otherwise would take years to earn to become available when
shareholders approved the merger, even if the deal was not
finalized.
</P>
<P>
   Some analysts even question whether William T. Esrey, the chief
executive who built Sprint into a force to be reckoned with, is the
person to lead it now.
</P>
<P>
   ``Esrey and his top people said Sprint could succeed alone and
then they went into the WorldCom deal,'' said Steve Koppman, senior
analyst with Dataquest, a division of the Gartner Group of
information technology consultants. ``Now, when he says they can go
on their own, it doesn't sound credible to the market.''
</P>
<P>
   LeMay called that assessment ``hogwash.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Bill said very clearly...at the time that we decided to merge
with WorldCom, that going alone was still a viable strategy. To
suggest that we had concluded that we couldn't make it on our own,
there wasn't a strategy we couldn't employ going forward, it
absolute hogwash,'' LeMay said. ``People are engaged in revisionist
history.''
</P>
<P>
   Wall Street wants Sprint to clearly articulate a strategy and
present people who can carry out that strategy, and Sprint is
working to do that, LeMay said. ``That's the issue, not Bill
Esrey.''
</P>
<P>
   The company will present its plans and introduce the new
management to investors and analysts in presentations before the
end of the year.
</P>
<P>
   Those plans include Sprint's place in the explosive growth
expected in data transmission. Though Sprint does not have the
world's largest Internet backbone, it is often acknowledged as one
the best.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our Internet backbone business is about a billion dollars now
and is growing at about 75 percent a year,'' LeMay said. ``We think
we can accelerate that growth next year.''
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, Sprint has its Integrated On-Demand Network,
or ION technology, which allows customers to use multiple fax,
phones or Internet hookups through a single line into the home or
business. Though Sprint has some difficulties with that technology,
LeMay said it was the technology customers wanted, a single line to
provide all their voice and data needs.
</P>
<P>
   By the beginning of 2002, LeMay predicted, Sprint also will be
able to offer ION services through its wireless network, greatly
expanding its market potential. That means the company will be able
to offer the service without having to work through a local
telephone provider. And it will be able to serve customers who live
too far away from special equipment to get high-speed Internet
connections by land lines.
</P>
<P>
   The tremendous growth of data movement over wire lines will
happen with wireless service as well, LeMay said: ``People are
going to find uses for that technology that we simply cannot
comprehend now. It is a major part of our growth opportunity. It is
just a matter of timing.''
</P>
<P>
   But in any transforming market, timing can be everything.
</P>
<P>
   ``The whole industry is going through a major shift. All
companies, including Sprint, face uncertainty,'' Kagan said. ``But
Sprint also is facing these challenges after they lost a lot of
senior talent.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is Esrey's time to become a bold visionary leader or step
aside. It can't be business as usual. Sprint is at a very important
transition point. We will just have to wait and see.''

NEWBURY HAD BIG DAY WHILE DOING THE SPLITS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By SCOTT WOLF  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ USC kicker David Newbury had never made three
field goals in a game before Sunday's victory over Penn State, a
fact made more surprising because Newbury did it with a shoe that
split open during pregame warm-ups.
</P>
<P>
   ``It had started to split the last couple of days at Irvine, and
we glued it back together,'' Newbury said. ``But by the end of
pregame warm-ups, it split back open.''
</P>
<P>
   Newbury did not want to break in a new pair of cleats right
before kickoff, so he had the shoe glued again before the game.
</P>
<P>
   ``I never thought about wearing new shoes,'' he said. ``If I can
make three field goals with a split shoe, I'm pretty happy.''
</P>
<P>
   After making only 11 of 20 field goals last season, Newbury's
3-for-3 performance against Penn State has surprised more people
than even he expected.
</P>
<P>
   During a communications class Tuesday, Newbury said the
professor, unaware that Newbury was a student, told his class that
he had watched the game and couldn't believe the kicker had
performed so well.
</P>
<P>
   ``He said, `Last year, Newbury couldn't hit anything.' We were
all smiling,'' Newbury said.
</P>
<P>
   But after the class, Newbury made a point to introduce himself
to the professor.
</P>
<P>
   ``We laughed it off,'' Newbury said.
</P>
<P>
   FAN ARRESTED: A Penn State student was arrested during the
Kickoff Classic for attempting to steal a USC helmet that was on
the team bench. The fan snuck on to the field with the Penn State
band but was apprehended by Giants Stadium security before he could
leave the field with the helmet.
</P>
<P>
   ANALYZING CARSON: USC quarterback Carson Palmer's subpar
performance was still a heavy topic of conversation Tuesday, and
Hackett said Palmer was ``short-arming'' throws and never got ``in
a rhythm or a flow.''
</P>
<P>
   Hackett said wide receiver Kareem Kelly, who caught just two
passes, also never was allowed to get into a flow.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've got to look back at that,'' Hackett said. ``Neither guy
had a chance to get into a rhythm.''
</P>
<P>
   NEW ATTITUDE: Hackett said the biggest difference in the 29-5
victory over the Nittany Lions was how the Trojans reacted to Penn
State formations for which they had not prepared.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our guys adjusted,'' he said. ``Our guys played with a
confidence I hadn't seen before.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought (Penn State) would be more physically dominant
against our defense. Was it us or was their offense disjointed? I
don't know.''
</P>
<P>
   KNIGHT RETURNS: Linebacker Darryl Knight did an about-face and
decided to rejoin the football team. Knight contacted Nevada-Las
Vegas and informed the Rebels he intended to transfer but changed
his mind after a meeting with USC coach Paul Hackett.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was just frustrated. It was something we talked and got
resolved,'' Knight said. ``I want to be a Trojan.''
</P>
<P>
   Knight quit the team last week after being kicked off the
practice field by defensive coordinator Bill Young during a
walk-through. He had been demoted to the scout team prior to the
incident.
</P>
<P>
   He could challenge for a starting linebacker spot next season
because he plays weakside linebacker, where senior Markus Steele is
the current starter.
</P>
<P>
   ``He has been reinstated. The Knight family has too much history
here,'' Hackett said.
</P>
<P>
   Center Carlos Acosta of Moorpark College, who left the team last
month after becoming homesick, also returned Tuesday and will
redshirt this season.
</P>
<P>
   MACKENZIE OUT: Tailback Malaefou MacKenzie will not practice
this week to rest his strained hamstring. Hackett said MacKenzie
should be ready for the Colorado game the following week.
</P>
<P>
   Defensive tackle Ryan Nielsen (shoulder) and tailback Petros
Papadakis (foot) will only practice once to rest nagging injuries
but are also fine for the game.
</P>
<P>
   GOAL FOR WEEK: Hackett said the Trojans have not played well in
games following a victory and a bye, and it's something he wants to
correct.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our history the last two years is we play questionable after a
bye,'' Hackett said.
</P>
<P>
   USC is 2-1 in those situations. They lost to UCLA 34-17 in 1998
but also defeated San Diego State 35-6. Last year, the Trojans
defeated San Diego State 24-21.
</P>
<P>
   DELAY OF PLANE: Lightning forced the team plane to sit on the
runway for more than two hours after the game, and USC did not
return from New York until 2:30 a.m. PDT Monday morning. &QL;

SPRINT'S PRESIDENT LOOKS AT THE COMPANY'S FUTURE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ERIC PALMER  
 c. 2000 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   KANSAS CITY, Mo. _ Since Sprint Corp. and WorldCom Inc. gave up
on their $129 billion merger, Wall Street has kicked the breath out
of Sprint's main stock.
</P>
<P>
   The shares, known by their FON trading symbol, closed Tuesday at
$32.56, less than half the $76 in stock that WorldCom was going to
pay. Sprint's separate PCS stock, which tracks the operation of its
wireless business, traded Tuesday at $48.06, 20 percent off its
price July 13 when the deal was canceled.
</P>
<P>
   Watching the stock price slide has sickened Ronald T. LeMay,
Sprint's president and chief operating officer. But during a recent
interview, LeMay outlined Sprint's plan to address Wall Street's
uncertainties about how the telecommunications company will move
forward independently.
</P>
<P>
   Sprint, which employs roughly 20,000 people in the Kansas City
area, will shift from being known primarily as a national
long-distance provider to a mover of voice and data by both land
lines and wireless technology, LeMay said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are not happy at all where the stock price is. I am a big
shareholder too. I can empathize because I am feeling it,'' said
LeMay, whose value of Sprint and Sprint PCS securities has fallen
by about $223.7 million, to about $127.6 million, since the merger
was canceled.
</P>
<P>
   The company will focus on markets worldwide where it is
currently building out networks of its Internet backbone _ which
connects Internet service providers to the Internet _ and its
wireless broadband technology.
</P>
<P>
   Its wireless broadband, the ability to provide Internet service
with wireless technology, has the potential to reach roughly a
third of the U.S. market to serve both consumers and businesses.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, LeMay said Sprint would work its way out of the
stand-alone consumer long-distance market, packaging its
long-distance with such services as PCS wireless and Internet
services.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is not going to be the same uniform national market people
have gotten accustomed to when people look at long-distance
carriers,'' LeMay predicted. ``It is going to be much more a
locally oriented market with long-distance and other things as
components.''
</P>
<P>
   There is no question there are fundamental changes occurring in
the market. The question, analysts said, is whether nine months of
merger negotiations sapped Sprint of some of the talent, drive and
agility to master the rearranged steeplechase.
</P>
<P>
   ``They are saying the right things, that the market is changing
and they are changing to meet that challenge,'' said Jeff Kagan, a
telecommunications industry analyst based in Atlanta. ``Recognizing
the problem and admitting you have a problem is half the battle.
</P>
<P>
   ``They still have to deal with the reality, that they are
without the same bench strengths they had a year ago. The company
has to either go it alone and fill in all of their weak spots or be
acquired.''
</P>
<P>
   Not all of what has happened to Sprint's share price is tied to
the annulment of the merger, analysts say. Investors are
disenchanted with the telecommunications category generally, and
the shares of AT&AMP;T, WorldCom and many others are trading well off
prices of a year ago.
</P>
<P>
   Prices for long-distance service continue to drop, putting
pressure on company earnings at the same time many companies are
investing tens of millions of dollars in the data and wireless
networks essential to be competitive. That revaluing of the
telecommunications industry was already under way at the time that
Sprint's merger with WorldCom was canceled, giving a double hit to
Sprint's stock.
</P>
<P>
   Many analysts still MORE

 MISTAKES WERE MADE ...   &HT;     By SCOTT OSTLER 
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ In the lovely and talented Leah Garchik's
meticulously researched and edited column Tuesday in this very
newspaper, there was a tiny mistake.
</P>
<P>
   It was a reference to actor Jack Larson, ``who played
photographer Jimmy Olsen on the TV series `Superman.' ''
</P>
<P>
   As a former kid whose lower jaw hung like a busted drawbridge
for 30 minutes every week during ``Superman,'' I know that Jimmy
was not a photographer, but a cub reporter for the Daily Planet
newspaper.
</P>
<P>
   I blanched at the tiny mistake because:
</P>
<P>
   1. Now Leah can't have a perfect year '00.
</P>
<P>
   2. Now Leah will get e-mail from every Boomer still alive.
</P>
<P>
   The largest volume of response I've received to any one item
came after I mixed up two ``Leave It to Beaver'' characters, Larry
Mondelo and Lumpy Rutherford.
</P>
<P>
   Larry, of course, was the Beaver's African American pal. Just
kidding! As anyone who watched TV in the late '50s knows, blacks
had not yet been invented.
</P>
<P>
   Nor had homosexuals. Leah's item was interesting in that it
revealed that Jack Larson was (is?) gay. So mild-mannered Clark
Kent wasn't the only person on that TV show who was ducking in and
out of closets to keep a secret.
</P>
<P>
   ANYWAY, my point is that mistakes happen and we need to be
forgiving. In Monday's column, for instance, I wrote that San
Francisco's Ingleside Terraces neighborhood is located in the
city's southeast corner, when in reality it is quite clearly in the
southwest corner.
</P>
<P>
   This might explain why, on a Boy Scout hike, I took a wrong turn
and wound up being raised by wolverines.
</P>
<P>
   ONE PROBLEM is that there are no orientation songs about San
Francisco, like there are about, say, New York City.
</P>
<P>
   ``New York, New York, it's a helluva town/The Bronx is up and
the Battery's down.''
</P>
<P>
   I'm working on one.
</P>
<P>
   ``That old S.F., it's a columnist's feast/Ingleside's west and
the Bayview is east.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The fog's from the left, so it's never too hot/North Beach is
North and Soma's south of the Slot.''
</P>
<P>
   I could go on. That might be a mistake.
</P>
<P>
   EVEN JERRY Brown makes mistakes.
</P>
<P>
   Oakland's New Age, free-range mayor hosts yoga and
consciousness-raising sessions in his own home, as do most of us.
</P>
<P>
   In a Chronicle story on the sessions, Brown is quoted thusly:
``Aristotle says the unexamined life is not worth living.''
</P>
<P>
   Sharp-eyed Barbara Loeb points out: Wrong.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mayor Brown should get his philosophers straight,'' Loeb says,
and she's right, because what's worse than a crooked philosopher?
</P>
<P>
   Loeb notes that the famous quote (``The life which is unexamined
is not worth living'') is from Plato. The quote is from Plato's
``Apology,'' in which Plato wrote down not his own words and
thoughts, but the orations of, and the dialogues involving,
Socrates.
</P>
<P>
   Aristotle? He was that ancient Greek shipping magnate who
married Jackie Kennedy.
</P>
<P>
   AND SAY, maybe Mayor Brown can invite Al Gore in for a few of
those yoga sessions, loosen Al up a bit, free his head.
</P>
<P>
   What a scene: It would take six burly Secret Service agents
armed with Liquid Wrench to help Gore achieve a lotus position.
</P>
<P>
   But as Yogi Berra, the great yoga master and George W. Bush
speechwriter, once said, ``When you come to the fork in the road _
take it.''
</P>
<P>
   MAYOR JERRY, by the way, just might be the most relentlessly
idealistic person in American folklore since Jimmy Olsen. (Gunther
Toody is close, but a little too ditzy.)
</P>
<P>
   Jimmy was just so full of enthusiasm and energy. Even when he
and Lois Lane were tossed into a dark mine shaft by the bad guys,
Jimmy always knew that Superman would rescue them.
</P>
<P>
   As for Jerry Brown, saving Oakland might be the craziest and
most ambitious political stunt in decades. And undertaken with a
seeming lack of ulterior motive, except maybe that of collecting
frequent-flier cosmic karma points.
</P>
<P>
   San Francisco used to have a fascinating, in his own way, mayor.
Whatever happened to that Willie Brown guy? Somebody should check
the bottom of the old mine shaft. Which, by the way, is being
converted to a live-work shaft loft.
</P>
<P>
   RETURNING TO the theme of mistakes and Greeks, the Greek
community in Sydney, Australia, is in an uproar, and you hate it
when that happens.
</P>
<P>
   In designing the medals that will be awarded to Olympic
medalists, the artist was instructed to salute the ancient Olympics
of Greece, but rendered an arena that is distinctly ancient Roman
in style.
</P>
<P>
   Which is like designing a travel poster of San Francisco that
features Dodger Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, I'm told that if you look closely at the medal, the
athlete is wearing horn-rim glasses and has a plastic
pocket-protector on his toga. The artist explained, ``Oh. I thought
you said you wanted me to honor the ancient  &UR; geeks. &LR; ''
</P>
<P>
   FULL CIRCLE back to my own mistakes: I noted in Monday's column
that Urbano Drive is the only street in the city where you can go
around and around forever.
</P>
<P>
   Readers such as Ernie Lubbe point out that I am way wrong. There
are many many circular streets in San Francisco. There is even a
circular street, Country Club Drive, that circles inside another
circular street, Lakeshore Drive.
</P>
<P>
   However, notes Lubbe, Circular Ave. is not circular.
</P>
<P>
   All I can say is, if I spent all my time checking old facts, I
wouldn't have time to make up new ones.
</P>
<P>
   Or as Jimmy Olsen used to say, ``Jeepers!''

SITE EASES SALE OF BUSINESSES  &HT;     BY PETER SINTON
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;         c.2000 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
If you want to buy a small business or have one you want to sell,
there are a number of useful Web sites to learn how to do it and
find listings.
<P>
   One of the best, especially if you live in California, is San
Ramon's Business Exchange Network and its California Businesses for
Sale site ( &LR; www.allcalifbiz.com &LR; ). Former small business consultant
and business broker Peter Siegel started the Web site seven years
ago for two main reasons _ to track the number of businesses sold
in California and to create a central clearinghouse for business
buyers, owner/sellers and agents and brokers.
</P>
<P>
   ``No one knew what was on the market so I started both a monthly
newspaper and a Web site,'' said Siegel. The site has about 2,100
California business listings at any one time and more than 50,000
visitors a week. Businesses can be perused by county and region or
by sector, such as manufacturing, services, restaurants, hotels,
liquor stores, gas stations and million-dollar businesses.
</P>
<P>
   Siegel, who operated a catering company and traffic schools
while getting his undergraduate and MBA degrees at UCLA, also
offers plenty of free information and advice on his site. Articles
cover dozens of subjects, including negotiating the sale of your
business, putting a value on goodwill, the escrow process and
presale tuneups. California Businesses for Sale also sponsors
workshops.
</P>
<P>
   Several other Web sites also help connect business sellers and
buyers. They include  &LR; www.bizquest.com &LR; ,  &LR; www.biztrader.com &LR; ,
 &LR; www.businessesforsale.com &LR; ,  &LR; www.mergernetwork.com &LR;  and
 &LR; www.nationlist.com &LR; .
</P>
<P>
   Many businesses sell for between 2.5 and 6 times their annual
adjusted gross income, according to Siegel. Fifteen years ago, when
he operated eight traffic schools catering to Los Angeles college
students like himself, Siegel did even better than that. He figures
he made close to $300 on every $450 of revenues. Thirty people
would pay $15 each to attend the class and he paid the instructor
about $85 and rented a room from the YMCA for about $40.
</P>
<P>
   Operating your own business can still be a good deal. But in
this era of plenty of jobs and low unemployment, Siegel said it has
been getting harder for some sellers to find buyers. In fact,
California business sales are down from a year ago. Through Aug.
19, California Businesses for Sale tracked 11,875 sales compared to
12,710 in the same period last year.
</P>
<P>
   Siegel offers these 10 tips to business sellers to avoid
wrecking a deal:
</P>
<P>
   _ Place a reasonable price on your business. Because an inflated
figure either turns buyers off or slows down potential buyers, rely
on a consultant to help you arrive at the best ``win-win'' price.
</P>
<P>
   _ Carry on ``business as usual.'' Don't become so obsessed with
the transaction that your attention wavers from day-to-day demands,
affecting sales, costs and profits.
</P>
<P>
   _ Hire experts to ensure confidentiality.
</P>
<P>
   _Prepare for the sale well in advance. Be sure your records are
complete for at least several years back and do all pertinent legal
or accounting ``housecleaning'' and literally spruce up the plant
or store.
</P>
<P>
   _ Anticipate information the buyer may request. To obtain
financing, the buyer will need appraisals on assets such as real
estate, as well as information to satisfy environmental
regulations.
</P>
<P>
   _ Make sure your marketing and advertising are going full tilt
to keep potential buyers competing against one another.
</P>
<P>
   _ Be flexible. Don't insist on all-cash at the closing or
dismiss any contingent payments. Depend on the advice of your
consultant, CPA or attorney and their knowledge of financing and
tax implications.
</P>
<P>
   _ Negotiate; don't ``dominate.'' Decide ahead of time when ``to
hold'' and when ``to fold.''
</P>
<P>
   _Keep time from dragging down the deal. Stay on a schedule.
</P>
<P>
   _Be willing to stay involved for a time to help the buyer
through a transition period.

COMMERCIAL FEDERAL TURNS DOWN BANKER'S OFFER TO BUY COMPANY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DAN MARGOLIES  
 c. 2000 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   KANSAS CITY, Mo. _ Kansas City banker Tom Burcham and a fellow
investor said Tuesday that thrift giant Commercial Federal Corp. of
Omaha, Neb., had rejected their offer to buy the company for what
they said was $1.3 billion in cash and stock.
</P>
<P>
   The $13 billion-asset institution owns banks and thrifts in
Nebraska, Missouri, Kansas and five other states and operates 22
branches in the Kansas City area. The company is the fourth-largest
savings and loan in the Midwest.
</P>
<P>
   Burcham, 58, is chairman of Missouri Bank &AMP; Trust Co., a small
bank in downtown Kansas City owned by Burcham and members of his
family. He owns less than 3 percent of Commercial Federal's stock,
which he acquired when the company purchased Burcham's stake in
First United National Bank and Trust Co. of Great Bend, Kan., three
years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Burcham and fellow investor John Eggemeyer III, president of the
bank investment firm Castle Creek Capital in Rancho Santa Fe,
Calif., said they had proposed to pay Commercial Federal
shareholders $18.50 in cash and 25 percent of the common stock in a
new holding company they planned to form. The two estimated their
offer to be worth $24 for each share of Commercial Federal, or
about $1.3 billion. That would represent 40 percent more than
Commercial Federal's book value.
</P>
<P>
   Commercial Federal's stock has been in the doldrums for more
than two years, closing Tuesday on the New York Stock Exchange at
$16.88, down from its 52-week high of $23.81 and its April 1998
peak of $39. The stock's book value as of March 31 was $17.29.
</P>
<P>
   The two said they learned this week that their unsolicited offer
had been rejected. Burcham said Commercial Federal's chairman and
chief executive officer, William Fitzgerald, informed the two that,
based on a restructuring Commercial Federal announced earlier this
month, the company's board did not support the proposal.
</P>
<P>
   Fitzgerald on Tuesday said Commercial Federal's board, ``along
with our financial advisers, saw (Burcham and Eggemeyer's
proposal), as submitted, as not being of substantial value for the
shareholders, given the restructuring that has been under way for
the past six months.''
</P>
<P>
   Fitzgerald declined to comment further and referred inquiries to
Merrill Lynch, Commercial Federal's investment banker. Merrill
Lynch officials could not be reached for comment.
</P>
<P>
   Commercial Federal, parent company of Commercial Federal Bank,
announced Aug. 15 that it expected to take a pretax restructuring
charge of $118 million to $138 million to get rid of more than $2
billion in lower-yielding assets and to pay off higher-cost
borrowings. The company also said it would expand its stock buyback
plan by up to 5.5 million shares, or 10 percent of its outstanding
stock.
</P>
<P>
   Like other financial institutions, Commercial Federal has seen
its cost of raising funds from deposits and other sources rise in
tandem with interest rates, shrinking its interest margins. The
Federal Reserve has raised interest rates six times since June
1999, from 4.75 percent to 6.5 percent.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's very sad that they've rejected this offer,'' Eggemeyer
said Tuesday. ``The company has missed its earnings estimates now
for basically two years. They've written off $250 million, or
almost 20 percent of their capital, in that time.
</P>
<P>
   ``They let their chief financial officer go about nine months
ago, they let their president go about four months ago and most
recently had major defections in their community banking group. So
you've got management in turmoil, a company that has underperformed
for an extended period of time and a lot of angry shareholders.''
</P>
<P>
   Burcham and Eggemeyer said their offer was backed by Credit
Suisse First Boston, a major investment bank. The two said they
sent a formal proposal letter to Fitzgerald on Aug. 17 and received
Fitzgerald's negative reply, dated Aug. 24, on Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Both said they were concerned that Commercial Federal's board
did not give their offer a proper hearing and that shareholders
were not informed of the offer.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's frustrating that this offer never saw the light of day,''
Eggemeyer said.
</P>
<P>
   Burcham said he and Eggemeyer ``have no intention of trying to
do a hostile takeover'' and considered their negotiations with
Commercial Federal concluded.
</P>
<P>
   About a year ago, Franklin Mutual Advisors, a mutual fund that
holds about 8.3 percent of Commercial Federal's stock, urged
Commercial Federal to seek a buyer. Although nothing came of the
effort, Franklin secured two seats on Commercial Federal's board
after a bitter proxy fight.
</P>
<P>
   An Aug. 16 research report by Friedman Billings Ramsey &AMP; Co.
Inc., an Arlington, Va., investment banking firm, stated that
Commercial Federal might receive ``continuing pressure from
shareholders to sell the company as management continues to
struggle as an independent institution.'' The report pegged the
thrift's worth at between $20 and $24 a share.
</P>
<P>
   Beginning about three years ago, Commercial Federal embarked on
an aggressive acquisition campaign, completing seven purchases in
six states totaling nearly $4 billion in deposits. The acquisitions
included Midland Bank in Lee's Summit, which Commercial Federal
bought for $83 million in March 1999.
</P>
<P>
   Eggemeyer, 54, has served as a top executive at a variety of
financial organizations, including First Chicago Corp., Norwest
Corp., Chemical Banking Corp., U.S. Bancorp and Drexel Burnham
Lambert. He co-founded Castle Creek, which invests in financial
institutions, in 1995.
</P>
<P>
   Last year he orchestrated the sale of Western Bancorp in Newport
Beach, Calif., to U.S. Bancorp for $958 million, or 4.4 times its
book value.

TWO CASINOS FINED FOR NOT PREVENTING UNDERAGE GAMBLING 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RICK ALM  
 c. 2000 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   KANSAS CITY, Mo. _ Two Kansas City casinos were fined a combined
$500,000 on Tuesday for failing to prevent a 16-year-old girl from
boarding the riverboats during a weekend gambling spree in June.
</P>
<P>
   Station Casino Kansas City and Harrah's North Kansas City Casino
&AMP; Hotel were each hit with $250,000 fines by the Missouri Gaming
Commission.
</P>
<P>
   It was the second such offense for Station Casinos Inc., which
paid a $250,000 fine in 1997 after a woman and her 12-year-old
daughter were caught playing slot machines at the company's St.
Charles, Mo., casino.
</P>
<P>
   The action Tuesday also included new allegations that Station,
on separate occasions in May and June, had let 20-year-old males
gain entrance to the Kansas City casino with false identification
and gamble.
</P>
<P>
   Station and Harrah's have 30 days to accept the fines or file
appeals that would be resolved at a public hearing.
</P>
<P>
   Troy A. Stremming, Station's Midwest counsel, acknowledged the
casino's responsibility but told commissioners the company may
appeal the amount of the fine, which he termed ``excessive.''
</P>
<P>
   Stremming noted that company employees apprehended the underage
gamblers in all three cases and reported them to the Gaming
Commission.
</P>
<P>
   ``Station Casinos takes this matter very seriously,'' he said.
``Unfortunately there's not a perfect system in place. Sometimes
(underage gamblers) find a way.''
</P>
<P>
   The teen-age girl, who was said to appear much older, presented
another person's driver's license to Station employees during the
evening of June 9 and was admitted to the casino. Until Sunday
morning, that ID fooled pit bosses, bartenders, card dealers and
others.
</P>
<P>
   She was with her mother at least part of that time, officials
said.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier on June 9 the girl also was admitted to Harrah's Mardi
Gras casino boat and gambled there, too.
</P>
<P>
   The mother, 41-year-old Carla Jean Wilson of Ash Grove, Mo.,
near Springfield, is a well-known player at area casinos.
</P>
<P>
   Clay County authorities in July charged Wilson with a class B
underage gambling misdemeanor that carries a penalty of up to six
months in the county jail and a fine of up to $500. She is
scheduled to appear in court Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Several Station employees who had contact with the girl were
fired or disciplined, but casino executives refuse to divulge how
many employees were involved.
</P>
<P>
   One of those fired was Becky Meyer. The 49-year-old Raytown
woman was the first of several employees who inspected and approved
the girl's false identification.
</P>
<P>
   Meyer said Tuesday that she was still out of work.
</P>
<P>
   But she said she sympathized with the casinos.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel bad that the boats have to pay,'' Meyer said. ``I think
she (Wilson) should have to pay. She knew what was right and what
was wrong. A 16-year-old should know right from wrong, too.''
</P>
<P>
   Harrah's officials had no comment.
</P>
<P>
   Also Tuesday, the commission approved the relicensing of
Harrah's North Star, the smaller of its two casino boats.
</P>
<P>
   Harrah's Assistant General Manager Bill Noble disclosed to the
commission that once Harrah's completes its announced $45 million
expansion of the Mardi Gras casino about a year from now, the North
Star will close and probably replace a smaller Harrah's vessel in
Metropolis, Ill.
</P>
<P>
   The company had said earlier it would continue to operate both
vessels in Kansas City.
</P>
<P>
   Noble said Kansas City customers had expressed a clear
preference for the larger Mardi Gras boat.
</P>
<P>
   Instead of expanding operations by more than 1,000 slot machines
and nearly 20 table games, the change will result in only a
marginal increase in Harrah's gambling capacity.
</P>
<P>
   Noble pledged that no employees will lose their jobs in the
consolidation.

COMPANIES SEEK A CLEAR LINE AROUND PAC BELL 
 &HT;     BY TODD WALLACK
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
 &LR;   &LR; By all accounts, AT&AMP;T's efforts to sell local phone service in
California three years ago was a disaster.
<P>
   Thousands of residential customers had to wait weeks to be
switched over from Pacific Bell, partly because of glitches in Pac
Bell's order system. Others lost their dial tone for several days.
And AT&AMP;T said it was forced to pay so much to Pac Bell, which
controls the local phone lines, that it had little hope of ever
turning a profit.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, in late 1998, AT&AMP;T offered to pay its 50,000 customers
to switch back to Pacific Bell, and reported it lost $4 million on
the effort.
</P>
<P>
   But Ma Bell isn't giving up on the local market. During the past
two years, the telecommunications giant has quietly signed up many
more than 10,000 local phone customers in the Bay Area through its
cable television lines _ doing a partial end run around Pac Bell.
In a handful of cities in the East Bay, including Fremont, AT&AMP;T has
signed up nearly 20 percent of homes eligible for the service. The
company now serves more than two dozen towns, mostly in the East
Bay and Marin County.
</P>
<P>
   Now, AT&AMP;T is preparing to fire a cannon shot across Pac Bell's
bow on Friday, offering potential customers five free months of
local phone service to switch. AT&AMP;T insists there are no
installation fees, long-term contracts or other catches. If
consumers decide to switch back to Pac Bell after five months, they
can do so without paying AT&AMP;T a penny.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's just unbelievable,'' said one financial analyst who
follows AT&AMP;T. Added Yankee Group analyst Fritz McCormick: ``It
shows they are very aggressive.''
</P>
<P>
   The promotion also demonstrates that local phone competition is
starting to become a reality in some neighborhoods _ but in a
different form than originally envisioned. Instead of using Pac
Bell's telephone wires, rivals are increasingly offering phone
service to consumers over coaxial cable TV lines.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to AT&AMP;T, two cable upstarts are also rolling out
phone service: RCN Communications, which just struck an agreement
to lay wires in San Francisco, is initially offering phone service
in Daly City, South San Francisco and San Mateo. And Seren
Innovations has initiated local telephone service under the
``Astound'' brand name in Concord with plans to expand into nearby
Walnut Creek.
</P>
<P>
   The competition is already translating into lower prices. RCN is
offering basic dial tone for just $5 _ half the $10.69 Pac Bell
charges. And AT&AMP;T is charging just $5 for a second or third line;
Pac Bell, by contrast, charges another $10.69 per month plus a $33
setup fee.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, both RCN and Seren, a division of Northern States
Power Co. in Minneapolis, are bundling phone service with cable TV
service and superfast Internet access, promising customers a
discount for the entire package. Seren, for instance, is knocking
10 percent off the total price. AT&AMP;T says it plans to follow suit
next year.
</P>
<P>
   But consumer advocates are underwhelmed with the choice.
</P>
<P>
   Regina Costa, a telecommunications analyst with The Utility
Reform Network in San Francisco, said cable coverage is too spotty.
</P>
<P>
   AT&AMP;T doesn't offer any phone service in San Francisco, San Jose
or Oakland, for instance, because the equipment is outdated. AT&AMP;T
said it must retrofit most of its 2.6 million cable lines in the
Bay Area during the next couple years to offer the service. And
even in cities it serves, AT&AMP;T hasn't upgraded the equipment in
some apartment buildings or blocks.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is wishful thinking that cable is going to be a viable
competitor for phones for anything but a handful of customers,''
Costa said.
</P>
<P>
   Ironically, though, Pac Bell could benefit if AT&AMP;T and RCN steal
a significant slice of its customers. The phone company needs to
convince state regulators that the local phone market is open to
competition in order to win permission to enter the long-distance
market.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, a handful of companies are using Pac Bell's wires
to offer local phone service, but it is extremely limited.
</P>
<P>
   Verizon Communications, for instance, is test marketing a
package in San Francisco that includes local and long-distance
service for $34. But Verizon doesn't market local phone service by
itself.
</P>
<P>
   Other major players, including WorldCom and Sprint, also tried
marketing local phone service through phone wires in 1997 and 1998,
but pulled out along with AT&AMP;T. They both blamed foul-ups with Pac
Bell's order system and said Pacific Bell charges too much to tap
into its wires to a home. (Companies typically must pay about
$14.50 per line, Pac Bell spokesman Bill Mashek said, or they can
buy Pac Bell's services at a 17 percent discount.) Pac Bell says
that it ironed out most of the bugs, and that none of the players
made a ``whole-hearted'' effort to compete through local phone
wires.
</P>
<P>
   Regardless, AT&AMP;T is making a huge bet that it can gain a leg up
on Pac Bell by using its own wiring. The telecommunications giant
spent roughly $125 billion buying companies like TCI, the cable
company that serves 90 percent of the Bay Area, and Media One, a
Colorado cable giant. To make the deal pay off, AT&AMP;T has told Wall
Street it hopes to sign up millions of local phone customers during
the next few years.
</P>
<P>
   But critics say the company has had trouble meeting its target
of signing up 400,000 local phone customers nationwide by year end
(not including Media One). As of June, AT&AMP;T sold roughly 101,000
lines.
</P>
<P>
   ``They are not necessarily going to hit those goals,'' said
McCormick, the Yankee Group analyst. Although McCormick said that
AT&AMP;T has been reasonably successful, the firm may have set the bar
too high.
</P>
<P>
   Given the situation, some analysts weren't sure whether AT&AMP;T's
five-month promotion is an aggressive marketing tactic or a
desperate move to meet its subscriber goals.
</P>
<P>
   ABN AMRO analyst Kevin Roe said the move could be logical in a
``highly penetrated market'' like some parts of San Francisco. But
if AT&AMP;T starts using the promotion in ``virgin markets,'' he said
it could be a troublesome sign. Another analyst, who asked not to
be named, said the promotion shows that AT&AMP;T ``will do anything''
to meet its goals.
</P>
<P>
   AT&AMP;T spokesman Andrew Johnson, however, said the company is
doing well without the promotion. Since it started service in
Petaluma in May, for instance, AT&AMP;T said it has grabbed 2.5 percent
of the market in just three months.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now is the time that we're ready to make a big splash,''
Johnson said.
</P>
<P>
   AT&AMP;T plans to back up the promotion with newspaper ads, radio
spots and television commercials on both broadcast stations and
cable. (Until now, AT&AMP;T has mostly used direct marketing tactics,
even going door to door, in a handful of towns.) In addition to the
Bay Area, AT&AMP;T plans to start the five-month promotion in eight
other cities around the country, such as Seattle and Chicago.

LAWRENCE LETS GO OF RECORD HIGHS AS STUDENTS MONITOR AN `ARCTIC'
96 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By LEE HILL KAVANAUGH  
 c. 2000 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LAWRENCE, Kan. _ Outside, temperature readings again flirted
with 100 on Tuesday. Inside the University of Kansas Storm
Prediction Center, three student meteorologists wrote down the
readings, printed them out and dutifully recorded them on
clipboards filled with thick stacks of other numbers.
</P>
<P>
   But these KU students don't have to read the thermometer to know
it's hot outside. Before Tuesday's comparatively arctic 96 on
Tuesday, Lawrence endured back-to-back highs of 109 degrees,
national highs for each day.
</P>
<P>
   ``The irony of all this,'' said KU senior Keith Weber, 21, ``is
that we're at the hottest spot in the nation and the weather lab
has no air conditioning.''
</P>
<P>
   Since last week, the air-conditioning unit on the sixth floor of
KU's Malott Hall has refused to do its job.
</P>
<P>
   But the students monitoring the lab's numbers are still there,
albeit wearing shorts and sweat-drenched T-shirts, trying to
capture readings as furnacelike drafts from four fans surround
them.
</P>
<P>
   ``You do get kinda used to it after a while,'' said Matt Makens,
a 20-year-old junior. ``We're still laughing about it, though. And
if it does get cooler, we'll be the first to know.''
</P>
<P>
   If?
</P>
<P>
   ``Oh yeah, it will get cooler; we just don't know when,'' Makens
said.
</P>
<P>
   The KU weather lab is an unofficial National Weather Service
monitoring station. It houses $30,000 worth of computers and
monitoring equipment that help examine the science of Lawrence's
weather from ground level to the atmosphere.
</P>
<P>
   Not a cloud was in sight Tuesday from an office window facing
some residence halls on the KU campus. Just endless blue. On the
roof of Malott Hall is a weather monitor that records wind speeds
and humidity and temperature readings at the university.
</P>
<P>
   ``Last night at midnight, it was 89 degrees,'' Makens said.
``We're right on the boundary of wet weather...but the southern
winds are sucking up all the warm Texas air and just blowing it on
us. If it could just shift a little, we'd have rain.''
</P>
<P>
   He used a computer model to demonstrate. ``Only thing is, the
computers are out to lunch too, because of the heat,'' he said.
``They base their prediction models on what it should be from
previously recorded weather averages. The computers don't even know
about these extreme temperatures. One model told us it would be in
the high 80s today.''
</P>
<P>
   The three students shook their heads.
</P>
<P>
   In weather like this, human beings _ and their knowledge of
fluid mechanics and weather systems _ beat out a computer guess any
day, the students said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's like the professors are always telling us, `don't marry
the models,' '' said senior Brian Koochel, 23.
</P>
<P>
   David Braaten, an associate professor of atmospheric science,
explained that the weather temperatures are only as accurate as the
monitoring stations that record them.
</P>
<P>
   ``In Lawrence, our weather data is recorded out at the municipal
airport,'' he said. ``If we only beat the Texas record by two or
three degrees, well, that can always be chalked up to the
calibration of the instruments or the site location of the
sensors.''
</P>
<P>
   The Automated Surface Observing System sits off to the side of
the main runway at Lawrence Municipal Airport, a few miles from
Interstate 70.
</P>
<P>
   The machine is actually eight modules mounted on poles. Each
module analyzes one aspect of the weather and reports the
information to computers in Lawrence and Wichita.
</P>
<P>
   But inside one dome-shaped unit, a fan whirrs continuously. Here
is where the thermometer sits.
</P>
<P>
   ``What most people don't know,'' said Braaten, ``is that every
temperature printed in the newspaper or broadcast over television
or radio is really a shade temperature.''
</P>
<P>
   The unit, he explained, always records the temperature inside
the housing cooled by the fan, because scientists want to know the
temperature of the air, not the solar temperatures on the ground.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you're standing out in the sun, it's safe to say that you
can easily add 30 more degrees and you'd be pretty accurate on the
actual temperature,'' he said. ``But that probably won't make
anyone feel any better.''

YAHOO'S STOCK GETS CLAWED ON WALL STREET  &HT;     BY KATHLEEN PENDER
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;         c.2000 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
There's a tug-of-war breaking out on Wall Street over Yahoo.
<P>
   On Monday, Lehman Bros. stock analyst Holly Becker questioned
Yahoo's growth prospects and sky-high valuation in light of the
slowdown in Internet advertising. Her report sent Yahoo shares
plummeting $12.19 _ about 9 percent _ to $122.06.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday, Yahoo bulls _ including Henry Blodget of Merrill Lynch
_ rushed to the company's aid with positive comments about its
long-term prospects, but they failed to breathe much life into the
stock. It closed yesterday at $121.
</P>
<P>
   This chain of events was eerily similar to what happened to
Amazon.com earlier this summer, and shows how susceptible even the
leading Internet companies have become to the slightest shift in
sentiment.
</P>
<P>
   On June 22, another Lehman analyst _ Ravi Suria _ issued a
scathing report on Amazon.com's convertible bonds. Amazon's stock
fell from $46.06 the day before the report to $33.88 the day after.
</P>
<P>
   Amazon's backers, again including Blodget, reiterated their
bullish opinions, but there was no immediate improvement in the
stock. It has since regained about half that loss, closing
yesterday at $39.63.
</P>
<P>
   Ironically, when Suria initiated his missile attack on Amazon's
bonds, his co-worker Becker had a buy rating on Amazon stock. Since
then, Becker has lowered her opinion on Amazon to ``neutral,'' the
same opinion she ``reiterated'' on Yahoo this week.
</P>
<P>
   Becker didn't respond to requests for comment yesterday.
</P>
<P>
   When I called Yahoo for a response, a Yahoo spokeswoman pulled
out her ``Holly Becker'' file and read me the following:
</P>
<P>
   ``At this juncture we see no material change to the past
statements we have made about our business. As we identified in
discussing the June quarter, we are not immune to changes in the
dot-com world and are working a little harder in this quarter than
in past ones given the tightness in dot-com advertising budgets.''
</P>
<P>
   The beating Yahoo stock took is a bit puzzling. Becker's report
didn't break a lot of ground, and she's not the first analyst to
raise such warnings. As Yahoo's statement indicates, Internet
advertising has been a concern for most of the summer.
</P>
<P>
   In case you were glued to ``Survivor'' instead of ``The Nightly
Business Report,'' here's a recap:
</P>
<P>
   A lot of dot-coms are running out of money. Since dot-coms are
the biggest Web advertisers, this is bad news for Internet
companies that rely on advertising. Analysts estimate that
advertising accounts for 70 to 80 percent of Yahoo's revenues.
</P>
<P>
   On July 11, Yahoo reported a blowout second quarter, and its
stock jumped from $105 to $124 in one day. The stock kept going up,
hitting $139 last week, until Becker weighed in.
</P>
<P>
   In her report, she explains that ``in the second quarter, the
dot-com environment remained healthy until June, leaving Yahoo with
only one difficult month. In 3Q, Yahoo will be facing a full
quarter of belt tightening by dot-com companies.
</P>
<P>
   ``Further, Yahoo's 2Q also benefited from unexpected upside in
e-commerce,'' Becker writes. In addition to advertising dollars,
Yahoo gets a cut of certain sales that go through its site. But,
``with a lion's share of its merchants already paying a royalty and
flattish transaction growth, we believe it is unlikely that 3Q will
see as great of an impact.''
</P>
<P>
   Becker says she's looking for signs that traditional advertisers
are moving online, ``but we are receiving little comfort.''
</P>
<P>
   She looked at Yahoo's top 200 advertisers for July and found
that ``dot-com advertisers continued to make up the majority of
advertisers, 61 percent in July compared to 63 percent in May. ...
Traditional companies were down to 23 from 24 percent.''
</P>
<P>
   Most analysts _ even the bulls _ agree that Yahoo is unlikely to
have an exceptional third quarter.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the first full quarter of the dot-com shakedown. And it's
a weak seasonal advertising quarter,'' says Blodget.
</P>
<P>
   He says things will pick up for Yahoo during the fourth quarter,
because advertisers won't cut back on marketing during the
pre-holiday season. But others envision a longer slump.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't see any near-term catalyst that's big enough to
really drive this stock to the next plateau,'' says Derek Brown of
WR Hambrecht &AMP; Co.
</P>
<P>
   Analyst John Corcoran of CIBC World Markets agrees.``Over the
next two quarters, investors need to be cautious in terms of their
upside expectations,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   Eventually, Yahoo will replace dot-com advertisers with Fortune
500 companies. ``But when you sell to a Fortune 500 player, it's a
much longer selling cycle. It takes six to nine months to get in
the door,'' he says. ``They're also more sophisticated and
conservative media buyers than the dot-com players. They start off
with smaller ad buys.'' And, needless to say, they will drive a
harder bargain.
</P>
<P>
   Last Friday, Corcoran reduced his 12-month price target on Yahoo
to $215 from $250, but maintained his ``strong buy'' rating.
</P>
<P>
   Like most analysts, he says Yahoo ultimately will benefit from
dot-com consolidation. Weaker competitors will disappear and
Fortune 500 companies will concentrate their spending on the top
two or three sites.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you believe that the Internet is a mass medium which is
rapidly acquiring real estate across a variety of new technology
platforms, there are two or three players defining and establishing
brands that are truly global platforms. One is Yahoo,'' says
analyst Chris Dixon of PaineWebber.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're also one of the few that has figured out how to
integrate (Web) hosting and business services with advertising and
e-commerce,'' he adds. ``Most importantly, they have a business
model that is almost the best I have ever seen.''
</P>
<P>
   This is where Yahoo differs from Amazon.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yahoo is a very clean Internet play,'' Corcoran says. ``They
understand that the marginal cost of distribution over the Internet
approaches zero.''
</P>
<P>
   Amazon uses the Internet to great advantage on the front end,
but it still has to ship and warehouse books, a capital-intensive
business subject to intense price competition.
</P>
<P>
   Another difference: Yahoo is profitable; Amazon is not.
</P>
<P>
   Then again, Yahoo's market capitalization is $66 billion,
Amazon's is $14 billion.
</P>
<P>
   Even with this week's $7 billion decline in Yahoo's market cap,
Brown warns, ``there's little room for a shortfall.''

SIERRA TOWN FINDS BANK WITH HEART 
 &HT;     BY SAM ZUCKERMAN
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
 &LR;   &LR; The little eastern Sierra town of Bridgeport won't lose its only
bank next month after all.
<P>
   When Bank of America leaves Bridgeport at the end of September,
its place will be taken by Oak Valley Community Bank, a tiny
independent based in the San Joaquin Valley town of Oakdale.
</P>
<P>
   Bridgeport, the center of a tourist region that draws tens of
thousands of vacationers to its mountains, lakes and streams every
summer, is one of the most isolated communities in California.
Mammoth Lakes, the nearest town with a bank, is nearly 60 miles
south.
</P>
<P>
   BofA's announcement two months ago that it planned to close its
Bridgeport branch meant the town's 700 residents would have had to
drive 120 miles round trip to do their banking.
</P>
<P>
   Area merchants said the bank's departure would disrupt their
businesses and leave them vulnerable to robbery as they took their
cash on the highway. Bridgeport's plight was the subject of stories
in The Chronicle and other news media.
</P>
<P>
   Oak Valley decided to take over BofA's Bridgeport office after
local residents carried out a three-week whirlwind courtship.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm just thrilled,`` said resort owner Kellie Annett, who
spearheaded the campaign to keep a bank in Bridgeport. Annett said
she telephoned the chief executives of every bank within 100 miles
to find a replacement for BofA.
</P>
<P>
   Most bankers said BofA's Bridgeport branch didn't do enough
business to make money. But Oak Valley Chief Executive Officer Ron
Martin said he was won over by the prospect of gaining a new group
of loyal customers.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're excited,'' said Martin. ``We met a lot of nice people in
Bridgeport.`'
</P>
<P>
   Martin said he hopes to make a go of it by winning more business
from area residents and taking over the accounts of the Mono County
government, whose seat is in Bridgeport. ``In the scheme of things,
it will be profitable,'' he predicted.
</P>
<P>
   Oak Valley will purchase for an undisclosed sum the office BofA
built 40 years ago when it first came to town, plus some equipment.
The bank isn't buying accounts, but BofA said it will make it easy
for customers to make the switch.
</P>
<P>
   The Oakdale bank is asking state and federal regulators to speed
the process of approving the branch sale so it can take possession
on Sept. 29, the date BofA is scheduled to leave. BofA has pledged
to keep the branch open if the red tape isn't completed by that
date, officials of the two banks said.
</P>
<P>
   Oak Valley's arrival takes the heat off BofA for a move many
local residents saw as a case of an unfeeling corporation putting
profits before community service. That rap was unfair, BofA
officials said, because they had been trying to sell the Bridgeport
branch for years before deciding to close it.
</P>
<P>
   Making sure that Bridgeport had a bank ``was something we placed
a high value on,'' said Larry Knutson, the BofA executive in
Bakersfield who supervises the branch. ``In this case we were very
fortunate.``
</P>
<P>
   The deal pairs the nation's biggest bank with one of
California's smallest. North Carolina's BofA has $680 billion in
assets and more than 4,400 branches in 21 states. Oak Valley has
$120 million in assets and four offices in the San Joaquin Valley
and Sierra foothills.

DESPITE SLIGHT BREAK IN HEAT, MAN DIES IN KANSAS CITY HOME 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MICHAEL MANSUR and DONNA McGUIRE  
 c. 2000 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   KANSAS CITY, Mo. _ After more than a week of 100-degree
temperatures, the relentless heat wave has claimed its first
victim.
</P>
<P>
   A family member found the body of a 68-year-old man late Monday
in his uncooled Northeast area home. A fan buzzed inside, but it
probably just increased the elderly man's body temperature by
circulating hot air, health officials said.
</P>
<P>
   For eight days now, temperatures in parts of the metropolitan
area have hit at least 100 degrees. A weak weather front brought
some relief Tuesday to Kansas City's north side.
</P>
<P>
   That brought a divergence in temperatures from north to south _
a disparity that reached its greatest difference at 2:30 p.m., when
the temperature at Kansas City International Airport was 87 while
at New Century AirCenter in southwest Johnson County, Kan., it was
100.
</P>
<P>
   The official high at KCI on Tuesday was 91, which was a break
from a 105-degree Monday. New Century AirCenter's high Tuesday was
100. Kansas City's record high for a Tuesday, set in 1984, was 110.
Today the high may reach 102 degrees.
</P>
<P>
   Across the metropolitan area, social service agencies,
utilities, cities and school districts were reallocating resources
to combat the effects of the heat. The area remains under a heat
advisory today, and Health Department officials urge people,
particularly the elderly, to take precautions and stay cool.
</P>
<P>
   Many schools were letting students out early.
</P>
<P>
   The weather also kept the Kansas City area under an orange alert
for ozone, a warning that air pollution may rise to unhealthy
levels.
</P>
<P>
   Local utilities _ both electric and water _ reported record
consumption on Monday.
</P>
<P>
   But it was the heat wave's human toll that concerned most on
Tuesday. This week's heat-related death brings the year's total to
six, but health officials worry that the number could quickly rise
if the intense heat lingers. The forecast calls for temperatures in
the 100s and high 90s through the weekend.
</P>
<P>
   Last year 21 died in the summer heat. Those concerns had social
service agencies scrambling Tuesday to establish cooling shelters
and provide air conditioners, fans and information about how to
stay cool.
</P>
<P>
   Marguerite Williams, 94, had no air conditioner in her Northeast
area home on Monday, and she regretted having to close her front
door at sunset. It meant she would be stuck inside her steamy home,
without a breeze, all night.
</P>
<P>
   Before relief came her way, she stretched out on the living room
couch, near the front door where the breeze once flowed. And she
turned off a large floor fan borrowed from a neighbor. It was
blowing only hot air, she said.
</P>
<P>
   She was afraid to look at the thermostat. She didn't want to
know how hot it really was. Finally, she got the idea to soak bath
towels with water and drape them across her body. She also wet a
wash cloth and periodically brushed it across her cat, Blackie.
</P>
<P>
   ``Those wet towels sure saved me,'' she said Tuesday afternoon,
a few hours after two men from Bishop Sullivan Center installed a
new window air conditioner for her.
</P>
<P>
   Sheryl Woods, chairwoman of the Kansas City Health Department's
heat task force, cautioned that when temperatures are around 100,
fans do little more than circulate the hot air. They may even raise
the body temperature of someone trapped in that heat, she said.
</P>
<P>
   Fans can be helpful, she added, if people spray their bodies
with water or use wet towels, as Williams did.
</P>
<P>
   In response to last year's heat wave, Bishop Sullivan Center has
provided about 300 free air conditioners this year to low-income
elderly and disabled people.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd like to think this program has helped,'' said Executive
Director Tom Turner, who purchased an air conditioner for Williams
on Tuesday after hearing of her situation.
</P>
<P>
   The agency, which quickly gave away the five air conditioners it
had available Tuesday, expects to receive about 30 more today. That
likely won't be enough.
</P>
<P>
   By 1 p.m. Tuesday, more than 150 people had called seeking help.
A few others dropped by the agency's office on Truman Road. One man
looked downcast when a staff member said about 100 people were
ahead of him.
</P>
<P>
   Nena Sudan, who lives a few blocks from the agency, was among
many turned away in recent days because her home already had one
window air conditioner.
</P>
<P>
   ``I understand that,'' Sudan said Tuesday in her rented
Northeast area home. ``But I'm just suffering.''
</P>
<P>
   One window air conditioner cools her living room and a small
downstairs bedroom, where her husband, Sabir Sudan, sleeps in a
hospital bed. The 51-year-old Vietnam veteran has kidney cancer and
arthritis in his spine.
</P>
<P>
   Nena Sudan, 57, avoids sleeping on the cooled couch downstairs
because it hurts her arthritic hips too much. Her upstairs bedroom
gets so hot, she can't sleep there until 2 a.m.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yesterday afternoon at 4:30 p.m., it was 104 degrees up here
with the fans going,'' she said, huffing from climbing 12 wooden
stairs from the kitchen.
</P>
<P>
   She hopes someone else will donate a window unit for her.
</P>
<P>
   The Sullivan Center and United Services Community Action Agency
are seeking money to buy more air conditioners. United Services
provided 360 units to Missouri residents before running out earlier
this month.
</P>
<P>
   An officer from the Kansas City Police Department's East Patrol
Division called to check on elderly people Monday and Tuesday as
part of the patrol's senior watch program.
</P>
<P>
   One 95-year-old woman reported dizziness, heat problems and
possible dehydration Monday but refused to seek medical attention.
She had an air conditioner but refused to run it regularly because
of the electric costs.
</P>
<P>
   A worried officer, Donna Rollo-Leap, went to the woman's home
with paramedics. The woman still refused a hospital visit, but
Rollo-Leap finally persuaded her to stay at her granddaughter's
home for a while.
</P>
<P>
   ``What I don't think (people) understand is there is help for
their utility bills,'' Rollo-Leap said.
</P>
<P>
   Across the metropolitan area, hospitals reported people seeking
treatment for heat-related problems.

FBI CHARGES TECH WORKER IN INSIDER TRADING CASE  &HT;     BY DAVID LAZARUS
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
A former engineer at Santa Clara's Nvidia Corp. was arrested
Tuesday on insider trading charges after allegedly earning almost
$450,000 on the company's shares prior to the announcement of a
major partnership with Microsoft Corp.
<P>
   Manu Shrivastava, 31, an Indian citizen residing in San Jose,
was released later in the day on $500,000 bail. His next court
appearance is scheduled for Sept. 12.
</P>
<P>
   Nvidia, a maker of computer-game technology, fired Shrivastava
several weeks ago after learning of his alleged stock trades from
securities regulators.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a serious thing for this company,'' said Dan Vivoli,
Nvidia's senior vice president of marketing. ``As soon as we
realized what happened, we took action against this employee.''
</P>
<P>
   According to the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission,
Shrivastava purchased nearly $31,000 worth of Nvidia call options
in early March.
</P>
<P>
   Call options allow a buyer to purchase shares at a fixed price.
Typically, an investor hopes the value of a stock rises before the
actual purchase is made, thus allowing the shares to be sold at a
profit.
</P>
<P>
   The SEC said Shrivastava began purchasing Nvidia call options
using an online brokerage account after learning through an
internal company e-mail that Nvidia had won a lucrative contract to
develop components for Microsoft's new X-Box game machine.
</P>
<P>
   ``Xbox deal is closed!'' the SEC quoted Nvidia's chief
executive, Jen-Hsun Huang, as saying in one of the messages. ``If
Xbox becomes as big as Sony Playstation, we generate about $2B in
sales over 5 years.''
</P>
<P>
   This message was followed the next day by a separate e-mail from
Vivoli reminding the company's 500 employees that the Microsoft
contract remained confidential.
</P>
<P>
   ``Not a word to anyone outside of our walls,'' it said. ``Let
the news roll out in a controlled way.''
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft unveiled its X-Box several days later, including word
of the collaboration of Nvidia in developing graphics components.
</P>
<P>
   But rumors of the deal leaked out in advance of the unveiling,
driving Nvidia's share price up more than 70 percent. After the
announcement, Nvidia's stock price jumped another 18 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Shrivastava's total earnings from his stock deals during the
period came to $446,724, the SEC said.
</P>
<P>
   Robert Mitchell, an SEC spokesman, said the Nasdaq Stock Market,
on which Nvidia's shares change hands, routinely investigates
trades that take place prior to major price movements. This led
securities regulators to Shrivastava, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Leslie Caldwell, who heads the securities fraud section of the
San Francisco office of the U.S. attorney's office, said
Shrivastava was arrested by FBI agents at his home yesterday
morning on charges of wire fraud and insider trading.
</P>
<P>
   Neither Shrivastava nor his lawyer could be reached for comment.
</P>
<P>
   While Nvidia has not been charged with wrongdoing, the SEC's
Mitchell said the case raises questions about how a company should
share confidential information with hundreds of workers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Is it appropriate for a company to be sharing this information
without reminding them of the legality of trading on this
information?'' he asked. ``That's the question this case clearly
flags.''
</P>
<P>
   Caldwell at the U.S. attorney's office agreed. ``The company
might want to think about how widely it wants to publicize
impending announcements that could affect the stock price.''
</P>
<P>
   But Nvidia's Vivoli insisted that the company had acted
responsibly. He noted that all company employees sign an agreement
never to trade in stock options, and that they also agree never to
buy or sell the company's shares during self-imposed ``blackout
periods.''
</P>
<P>
   He said a blackout period had been declared shortly after the
first message went out telling Nvidia workers that the deal had
been closed with Microsoft.
</P>
<P>
   Vivoli also observed that nearly all of the company's employees
were involved with the X-Box project ``in one way or another,'' and
thus it would have been difficult keeping a lid on such news.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft's X-Box is slated to hit store shelves by late 2001.
It is the software giant's first stab at competing with the likes
of Nintendo Co., Sony Corp. and Sega Enterprises.
</P>
<P>
   Since Shrivastava's firing, Vivoli said the company's
stock-trading policy has been reiterated to workers in an e-mail
message and through team meetings.
</P>
<P>
   He said Shrivastava had been working for Nvidia as a software
engineer for only about a year. ``He was one of several engineers
in the company,'' Vivoli said. ``He didn't stand out one way or
another.''
</P>
<P>
   If found guilty of insider trading, Shrivastava would forfeit
all his stock-market winnings to the U.S. government. He also faces
imprisonment for up to 10 years and fines of up to three times his
alleged profits.
</P>
<P>
   Nvidia's share price slipped 19 cents yesterday to close at
$77.81.

CHENEY VISITS KANSAS CITY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By STEVE KRASKE  
 c. 2000 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   KANSAS CITY, Mo. _ The venue for Dick Cheney on Tuesday was the
Fellowship of Christian Athletes national headquarters in Kansas
City. The topic was character.
</P>
<P>
   Teaching character, Cheney told an audience of about 70, is as
important as learning how to read.
</P>
<P>
   ``We want them to know right from wrong,'' Cheney said in a
quiet voice, referring to George W. Bush's goal of teaching
children to be ``good and kind and decent'' in public schools.
``Nothing is more important than teaching character.''
</P>
<P>
   The former Wyoming congressman and defense secretary under
President George Bush described character as ``the very essence of
our country.'' America's creed, Cheney said, is ``leadership based
on character.''
</P>
<P>
   So it came as no surprise that Texas Gov. George W. Bush's
running mate had a very definite opinion on whether President
Clinton should have been removed from office last year as a result
of the Monica Lewinsky scandal.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would have voted to impeach him,'' Cheney said in an
interview with The Kansas City Star. ``Because I thought he was
guilty. I thought he lied under oath. And I thought the House made
a strong case to that effect.''
</P>
<P>
   He is, Cheney told an interviewer later, a ``man of few words''
who prefers low-key campaign events that are in sharp contrast to
the more lively events that Democrats Al Gore and Joe Lieberman
regularly stage.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday's event certainly fit Cheney's preferences. The FCA
crowd was in business attire and remained quiet for most of
Cheney's brief remarks. In fact, attendees waited to politely
applaud until well after Cheney and his wife entered the hall.
</P>
<P>
   His toughest remarks directed at the Democratic team also were
brief and were presented with no change in Cheney's somber tone.
The running mate criticized Gore for opposing any type of school
voucher plan that would provide federal grants to parents with
children in failing schools. The parents could then use the money
to pay for private schooling.
</P>
<P>
   ``Al Gore does not support the idea of giving low-income parents
a wide range of choices,'' Cheney said.
</P>
<P>
   As he often is on the campaign trail, Cheney was joined by his
wife, Lynne. Others featured at the gathering were Royals' first
baseman and FCA member Mike Sweeney and Erika Garris, a junior at
Knob Noster High School and FCA member who has signed a pledge to
remain drug-free.
</P>
<P>
   Afterward, Cheney stopped at the Carriage Club near State Line
Road and Shawnee Mission Parkway for a private fund-raiser that
brought in an estimated $50,000 for the Missouri Republican Party.
He then left Kansas City for Jackson, Miss.
</P>
<P>
   Bush has made character education a part of his school platform.
He's proposed increasing to $25 million from $8 million the amount
spent on ``character education grants'' so that teachers can learn
how to incorporate character-building lessons in their classrooms.
</P>
<P>
   Bush also has proposed increases in the amount spent on
abstinence education from $62 million a year to at least $135
million a year, which, he notes, is the amount the federal
government spends on teen contraception programs.
</P>
<P>
   Founded in 1954, the FCA is a faith-based organization aimed at
student and professional athletes. The group's motto is that
building better persons translates into molding better athletes.
</P>
<P>
   On other topics, Cheney deflected pressure from Gore's campaign
to accept three nationally televised, prime-time debates as
proposed by the Commission on Presidential Debates.
</P>
<P>
   Bush has said he ``would welcome'' three prime-time debates. But
his campaign said that did not mean that Bush would accept the
commission's proposed dates or formats.
</P>
<P>
   In the interview with The Star, Cheney pointed out his campaign
has received 41 debate invitations from different groups. The
invitation from the commission is ``one proposal out of several,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are a lot of different ways to go,'' Cheney said. ``And
I don't think there's necessarily any one particular approach. My
guess is we'll end up with a mix, and that's probably as it should
be.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked about the B-2 stealth bomber fleet based at Whiteman Air
Force Base in Knob Noster, Mo., Cheney said he opposed moving the
fleet closer to the world's hot spots in Europe and the Mideast.
The bomber was not used in the Persian Gulf War, when Cheney was
defense secretary.
</P>
<P>
   ``One of great features of the B-2 is the fact that you can base
it here in Missouri and can, with air-to-air refueling, literally
hit virtually any target any place in the world without having to
land on foreign soil,'' he said. ``That's a great asset.''
</P>
<P>
   On another topic, Cheney said Bush is just as prepared as his
father to assume the presidency, although he said the Texas
governor's background is based more on domestic policy while his
father had more foreign policy experience when he became president.
</P>
<P>
   ``No one president ever arrives in the Oval Office with total
experience,'' Cheney said. ``It's not a one-man operation. You have
to build a team. The governor has demonstrated that he's very much
committed to that course of action, and he's started to assemble a
good team.''
</P>
<P>
   He gave Clinton some credit for overseeing the nation's robust
economy. But Cheney said that the causes of America's economic boom
predated the Clinton administration by more than a decade. One of
those causes was the major tax cut Ronald Reagan passed early in
his administration.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would not want to attribute to him sole responsibility for
our current prosperity,'' Cheney said of Clinton. ``I don't think
that's accurate.''

<TEXT>
The 1990s was a period of explosive growth for some minority groups
nationwide, and in California such increases put the total minority
population squarely in the majority, according to new figures
released Wednesday by the U.S. Census Bureau.
<P>
   It is a trend that experts say is likely to continue through the
next decade and one that will have enormous political and economic
impact.
</P>
<P>
   Asians and Pacific Islander populations across America grew by a
staggering 43 percent, while Latinos also made significant gains,
with a 39.7 increase in population.
</P>
<P>
   Experts say the growth has been fueled in part by immigration of
high-tech workers, births to young immigrants and the arrival of
spouses and children of new citizens in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is substantial growth in two populations that were
already fairly large. To grow that fast really shows how strong the
migration has been over the last decade,'' said Barry Edmonston,
director of the Population Research Center at Portland State
University.
</P>
<P>
   A lot is riding on the data, said Amy Smith, a census
statistician demographer.
</P>
<P>
   ``Federal dollars are allocated based on these numbers, things
like Head Start programs and Children in Poverty programs,'' she
said.
</P>
<P>
   The census figures _ annual estimates based on births, deaths
and net migration for 1990-1999 _ show California's population
becoming increasingly diverse as it grew from 29.8 million to 33.1
million.
</P>
<P>
   During the decade, California had the largest numeric increase
in both Latino and Asian populations, with Los Angles County
showing unequaled growth from both groups.
</P>
<P>
   The population of Latinos in Los Angeles grew by 790,079 to
4,141,317, and the population of Asians increased by 259,665 to
1,253,291.
</P>
<P>
   California's Latino population rose from 7.7 million to 10.5
million from 1990 to 1999, a 36.4 percent increase. The Asian and
Pacific Islander population grew by nearly 36 percent, from 2.95
million to 4 million.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, the state's non-Latino white population
declined from 17.9 million in 1990 to 16.5 million in 1999.
Non-Latino whites were 49.8 percent of the total state population
last year, while in 1990 they were 57 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Other California minorities showed increases, but far smaller
than Asians and Latinos. American Indian and Alaska Native
populations grew by 9.4 percent, while African American populations
increased by 5.1 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Nationally, the population grew from 249.5 million to 272.7
million. The Latino population rose from 22.4 million to 31.3
million, and Asian and Pacific Islanders went from 7.4 million to
10.8 million. The white population grew by 9.6 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Edmonston said the decade's change has been influenced heavily
by immigration. One part of that is from foreign high-tech workers
being recruited to areas where the industry is booming, such as
Silicon Valley and Seattle.
</P>
<P>
   However, the bulk of it is from Asian and Mexican immigrants who
were legalized in 1986 and became citizens in the 1990s, he said.
They then brought their spouses and children to the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Edmonston said NAFTA also affected population, bringing in
foreign workers and their families for a few years. Even though
they are in the nation temporarily, they are included in the count.
</P>
<P>
   The latest national figures reflect a change from the 1990
Census, when Latinos had to choose between white, black and
``other'' categories. There were also Asian and American Indian
options, but none for Latinos or Hispanics, who had traditionally
been counted among the white population.
</P>
<P>
   According to the new data, Nevada was the fastest-growing state
in the nation, ballooning about 50 percent from 1.2 million to 1.8
million, largely because a dramatic increase in the Latino and
Asian populations.
</P>
<P>
   Nevada saw a 144.6 percent increase in Latinos and a 123.7
percent increase in Asians _ the biggest growth in the nation.
</P>
<P>
   Arkansas topped the nation for growth in Latino population, with
a 170.3 percent rise from 19,876 to 53,729.
</P>
<P>
   The figures are indicative of how diversity has spread across
the nation. Margaret Leal-Sotelo, former national director of
census education programs for the Mexican American Legal Defense
and Education Fund in Los Angeles, said the figures also validate
the belief among Latino advocates that Latinos have been
undercounted in the past.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was a time when you could go to parts of the country and
not see Latinos, and now we are seeing Latinos in Arkansas, in
Atlanta and in parts of the Carolinas. And I think that is very
telling,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   &LR; sh1  &LR; Effect on Elections
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the Census Bureau released additional figures Tuesday
showing that the number of Latinos and Asian Americans who vote
jumped sharply, even as the overall number of voters nationwide
dropped by 2.6 million.
</P>
<P>
   More than 500,000 additional Latinos voted in the congressional
elections of 1998 than voted in 1994, and the number of Asian
Americans and Pacific Islanders voting increased by 366,000 in the
same period.
</P>
<P>
   Glenn Magpantay of the Asian American Legal Defense and
Education Fund in New York said the new population figures raise
the prospect that increasing numbers of Asian American voters could
have an effect on the November election.
</P>
<P>
   He said many Asian Americans registered to vote after
Republicans cut safety nets and benefits for immigrants.
</P>
<P>
   ``Asian Americans are voting their preferences. They are voting
for who they think will represent their interests,'' Magpantay
said. ``Asian Americans are going to have a much bigger impact.''

SELECTIVE DISCLOSURE CAN HELP THE MARKET 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JERRY HEASTER  
 c. 2000 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Securities regulators, investors and corporate executives have
learned yet again, in the harshest way possible, that they have
much greater problems than what's known in the trade as selective
disclosure.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this month the Securities and Exchange Commission
approved a rule barring companies from sharing important tidbits
with favored analysts and investors before making public disclosure
of the information. The idea is to prevent heavy hitters from
profiting at the expense of the little guys as the stock market
increasingly becomes the province of small investors.
</P>
<P>
   The advent of worker capitalism, online trading and
lightning-fast dissemination of fact and rumor on the Internet has
made regulators more sensitive to the need to protect the investing
public. It's a notion that sounds good in theory, although in
reality it's arguable whether the little guys should be playing the
same game as the big guys.
</P>
<P>
   The investors the SEC is mostly trying to protect are for the
most part those who shouldn't be trading, but rather buying and
holding stock in companies with promising prospects. Or, perhaps
even better, they should be buying and holding mutual funds with
solid records of investment performance.
</P>
<P>
   As it turns out, however, the potential for Internet abuse
transcends the issue of traditional give-and-take of material
information. A brutal reminder of this fact of life came Friday
when a bogus news release concerning Emulex Corp. was posted online
on an obscure business news wire. It falsely warned of an impending
earnings restatement from profit to heavy loss.
</P>
<P>
   The story was picked up by the major financial newswires, and
Emulex's stock fell 60 percent, wiping out nearly $2.5 billion of
the company's market value before the hoax was revealed. The stock
did manage to recover most of its loss, closing 6.5 percent lower
for the day.
</P>
<P>
   When a stock can be clobbered this badly by a fraudulent news
release, it would seem that selective disclosure may not be as
threatening as regulators perceive. In fact, it might even serve as
a useful filter for financial intelligence.
</P>
<P>
   If, for instance, the system allowed early briefings for a
favored few, a fraudulent press release might be recognized as such
more quickly. In a world in which the analyst community has early
access to information, revelations create a buzz about companies
experiencing untoward developments. Thus, if word of an untoward
event appears without warning on the Net, it might be viewed as
suspect in the absence of any Wall Street buzz about the company.
</P>
<P>
   A generation ago, one of the big debates among Wall Streeters
concerned the so-called efficient markets hypothesis. According to
the theory, stock prices always reflect the knowledge and
expectations of all market players. Thus, nobody has an edge and
it's impossible to beat the market by finding undervalued stocks.
</P>
<P>
   Given the Internet's ability to communicate info-garbage as well
as straight poop, too much efficiency may prove a dangerous thing.
The best way to counter this threat will no doubt be a subject of
intense debate. Meanwhile, it's possible that too democratic an
information marketplace may work against the little guys rather
than for them.

 CALIFORNIA MAN KIDNAPPED BY PHILIPPINE REBELS  &HT;     By BENJAMIN PIMENTEL 
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
<P>
   An Oakland, Calif., man became the first American taken hostage
in the latest campaign of terror waged by Philippine rebels, who
have threatened to kill him if their demands are not met.
</P>
<P>
   Jeffrey Schilling, 24, a recent graduate of the University of
California at Berkeley, was abducted Monday by the Abu Sayyaf,
which is fighting for an Islamic state in the southern Philippines.
Since April, the group has kidnapped three dozen people, including
European tourists from a Malaysian resort.
</P>
<P>
   Shilling's mother said Tuesday that hearing the news was like
plunging into ``The Twilight Zone.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I have to figure out how to pray, how to wait,'' Carol
Schilling, 51, of Oakland, said. Her son had been living in the
southern Philippine city of Zamboanga with his Filipino wife, who
reportedly is related to a rebel spokesman.
</P>
<P>
   In a radio interview in the Philippines, the rebel spokesman,
Abu Sabaya, accused Schilling of being a CIA agent and threatened
to execute him unless the United States agrees to release militants
jailed for the bombing of the World Trade Center in New York in
1993. That attack killed six people and injured more than 1,000.
</P>
<P>
   Schilling's abduction came after the rebels released six other
captives, all Westerners, from a guerrilla camp this week _
reportedly in exchange for $6 million. The captors continue to hold
French journalists and Filipino Christian evangelists who came to
their hideout.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had followed news of those hostages and was feeling relieved
that they were being released, even though (Jeffrey) wasn't part of
that,'' said Carol Schilling. ``Now, my son is a hostage.''
</P>
<P>
   A U.S. State Department official said the American Embassy in
Manila was working with the Philippine government to negotiate
Schilling's freedom. But the U.S. government will not pay ransom,
release prisoners or change policies, the official said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Doing so only encourages additional terrorism and endangers
other people,'' the official said.
</P>
<P>
   It was unclear how Schilling, who moved to Zamboanga in March,
was abducted. An envoy to Philippine government hostage negotiator
Robert Aventajado confirmed seeing Schilling in an Abu Sayyaf camp,
a U.S. State Department representative said.
</P>
<P>
   Schilling's wife, Ivi Osani, said the rebels accompanied her and
Schilling to a rebel camp on Jolo island. She said the rebel
spokesman, Sabaya, is related to her mother and had been urging the
couple to visit the outpost.
</P>
<P>
   In a tearful interview with a radio journalist in the
Philippines, Osani pleaded with the rebel group to release her
husband. She said Schilling had told her to return alone to
Zamboanga, and she learned of his kidnap when she arrived there
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Father Jun Mercado, a Mindanao-based Catholic priest who has
followed the conflict on the island, said the Abu Sayyaf may have
decided to use Schilling as a shield in anticipation of a major
military offensive by the Philippine army after the release of the
other hostages this week.
</P>
<P>
   Sabaya, the Abu Sayyaf spokesman, said in the radio interview
that his group had been looking for an opportunity to kidnap an
American. He also suggested that they may demand even more money
for Schilling.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Americans may think we are afraid of them, but we are
really determined to get an American,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Carol Schilling denied that her son is a CIA agent, calling him
a ``passionate, very idealistic'' young man.
</P>
<P>
   Schilling, who graduated from UC Berkeley last year with a
degree in Near Eastern Studies, converted to Islam six years ago
and had befriended Filipino Muslims in the Bay Area before moving
to Zamboanga, his mother said.
</P>
<P>
   ``He went to the Philippines because he had sympathy for the
Muslim people, their poverty,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Schilling eventually fell in love with Osani, a Filipino Muslim
student from Zamboanga. In April, he sent his mother an e-mail that
said: ``Met the girl of my dreams.'' The couple were married two
months ago. When the rebel group kidnapped the group of tourists in
Malaysia on April 23, Carol Schilling urged her son to come home
and even sent him a plane ticket, she said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``But he was just too in love with Ivi to leave,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   However, her son told her that he was getting worried about the
Abu Sayyaf's threat to behead Americans. The group had beheaded two
Filipino captives earlier this year.
</P>
<P>
   In late April, the Philippine military waged an all-out
offensive against a bigger rebel group, the Moro Islamic Liberation
Front, on the island of Mindanao, creating more tension in the
region.
</P>
<P>
   Carol Schilling said her son had tried to keep a low profile in
Zamboanga, remaining mostly indoors in the past months. He also
tried to get a job in Zamboanga, but he didn't have the proper
visa.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, she said, he e-mailed her to say that he was coming
home on Sunday. His future plans with his new wife were unclear,
she said, but he planned to get a job.
</P>
<P>
   ``He needed to start working for his wife and the kids they
planned to have,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Carol Schilling said that despite her son's abduction, she
harbors no ill will toward Muslim Filipinos.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know there's a distinction between the Muslim Filipinos and
the Abu Sayyaf,'' she said. ``They're extremists.''

SUPREME COURT RULING KEEPS CALIFORNIA POT CLUB FROM DISTRIBUTING 
 ITS WARES
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     By HENRY K. LEE 
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
 &LR;   &LR;  Responding to an urgent request from the Clinton
administration, the U.S. Supreme Court issued an emergency order
Tuesday temporarily preventing an Oakland, Calif., medicinal
marijuana club from distributing its goods.
<P>
   The justices agreed by a 7-to-1 vote to stay enforcement of a
federal judge's ruling in San Francisco that would have allowed the
Oakland Cannabis Buyers' Cooperative to dispense marijuana to
seriously ill patients.
</P>
<P>
   But supporters of the Oakland club said they were not surprised
by the ruling, and they voiced confidence that they will prevail
when the U.S. Court of Appeals in San Francisco _ which ruled in
their favor last year _ again hears their case.
</P>
<P>
   ``This to me is a little bump in the road,'' said Jeff Jones,
executive director of the Oakland club. ``The Ninth Circuit could
lift the power of the stay and change the direction this case is
going again, kind of like a tennis match.''
</P>
<P>
   Gerald Uelmen, a Santa Clara University law professor and an
attorney for the club, agreed, saying the Supreme Court ruling only
``preserves the situation'' for now. ``Stay tuned,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Gretchen Michael, a spokeswoman for the Department of Justice,
had no immediate comment Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   The Court of Appeals could decide as early as next month whether
it will schedule oral arguments to review a decision made in July
by U.S. District Judge Charles Breyer in San Francisco that allowed
the dispensing of medicinal marijuana.
</P>
<P>
   For now, the Oakland club has a new incarnation as the Co-op
Stop on Broadway in Oakland, selling hemp products and providing
identification cards for medicinal marijuana patients.
</P>
<P>
   Breyer's decision was based on a ruling last year by the appeals
court that said he should have considered the needs of patients who
could ``suffer imminent harm`' without marijuana and had no legal
alternative. In doing so, Breyer essentially modified his own 1998
order that shut down the Oakland club and five others in Northern
California.
</P>
<P>
   The Supreme Court ruling is the latest in a protracted legal
battle that has pitted the wishes of California voters and
advocates of medicinal marijuana against federal drug laws.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the passage in 1996 of Proposition 215, the
voter-approved measure that allows marijuana to be provided for
medicinal use, enforcement of the initiative has been tangled up in
the courts.
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton administration has not budged from its stand that
marijuana is an outlawed substance under federal law.
</P>
<P>
   Laws similar to Proposition 215 have been passed in Alaska,
Arizona, Hawaii, Maine, Nevada, Oregon and Washington state.
</P>
<P>
   No sooner did medicinal marijuana clubs open for business than
then-state Attorney General Dan Lungren, joined by federal and
local law enforcement agencies, moved to shut them down.
</P>
<P>
   Eventually, Breyer ordered the shutdown of a number of pot
clubs, including those in San Francisco, Oakland and Santa Cruz.
</P>
<P>
   Breyer's brother, Stephen Breyer, sits on the Supreme Court and
recused himself from the case Tuesday.

EAGLES OVER COWBOYS? WE'LL FIND OUT SUNDAY
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By RAY BUCK 
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   DALLAS _ Dave Campo admitted Tuesday that he is ``nervous ...
excited ... scared of everybody'' just five days before his first
game as head coach at any level.
</P>
<P>
   Then he added that he could not have handpicked a better
opponent for his Dallas Cowboys to open the season against than
Philadelphia, at 3:05 p.m. Sunday at Texas Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   The Eagles haven't had a winning season since 1996, but they've
become a sexier preseason pick than the Cowboys in some national
publications, and have been tabbed to make the playoffs for what
would be the first time in four years for long-suffering Philly
fans.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sports Illustrated'' picked Philadelphia to finish second in
the NFC East behind Washington and predicted Dallas will finish
fourth in the division, ahead of only Arizona. (''SI'' has the
Washington Redskins, Eagles, New York Giants and Cowboys all making
the playoffs, by the way.)
</P>
<P>
   ``It really doesn't matter who we play, but I think it is a
little bit of added incentive that some publications are picking
Philadelphia,'' Campo said before the annual Kickoff Luncheon and
Happy Hill Farm fund-raiser at the Intercontinental Hotel.
</P>
<P>
   ``I like (opening against the Eagles), personally,'' Campo
added. ``Starting out in your division adds a little significance
to what you do in preparation in training camp. Philadelphia is
probably just as excited about the same situation.''
</P>
<P>
   The Cowboys' first three games, over a span of 22 days, will be
played against divisional rivals Philadelphia, Arizona and
Washington. The latter two are night games on the road.
</P>
<P>
   Facing divisional opponents early provides a ``barometer'' _
Campo's word _ for where the Cowboys are likely to fit into the NFC
East picture this season.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's obvious the Eagles are a better football team than they
were a year ago,'' said Campo, citing the development of
second-year quarterback Donovan McNabb, the dogged running style of
Duce Staley and a revamped offensive line as just three reasons for
their improvement offensively.
</P>
<P>
   Defensively, the Eagles led the NFL last season with 46 takeways
(28 interceptions, 18 fumble recoveries).
</P>
<P>
   ``We cannot have turnovers and win,'' Campo said. ``They're a
pressure defense. That's good for them and good for us. It's a good
news/bad news story. If you guess right, you make some big plays;
if you guess, you give up some big plays.
</P>
<P>
   If the Eagles ``blitz up the middle, and you happen to be
running an off-tackle play. ... I like Emmitt's chances of getting
the ball downfield.''
</P>
<P>
   Emmitt is Emmitt Smith, who missed all five preseason losses
with two injuries, a toe sprain then a calf strain. The last time
Smith missed an entire preseason (1993), he rushed for 1,486 yards
in 13 starts and the Cowboys won the Super Bowl.
</P>
<P>
   Campo couldn't say it clear enough: ``Emmitt is 100 percent.
He's ready to go.''
</P>
<P>
   But neither owner Jerry Jones nor Campo could be dragged into
making a prediction about where the Cowboys will finish in 2000.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think one of the things that has hurt this team in the past
is maybe we worried too much about where we were going to end up,''
Campo said. ``Remember, we didn't win the division last year. The
Redskins won the division.''
</P>
<P>
   The preseason consensus among national publications is for
Washington to win the NFC East again. The debate is over the depth
of the division, and which team among the Cowboys, Eagles and
Giants will be second-best.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the division is much improved. Every team made some
strides in the off-season,'' Campo said. ``The tougher the
division, the better chance that a team coming out of that division
has of going all the way. I'd rather have it that way.''
</P>
<P>
   Campo waited 30 years to get to Sunday's game. He becomes a
first-time head coach when the scoreboard actually matters.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm scared of everybody ... whether it's their first string or
their second string ... because somebody has made a big play
somewhere to get here,'' said Campo. ``So, I'm nervous going into
this game; it's very simple.''
</P>
<P>
   The game is still four days away. But Campo already knows he'll
never forget it. nn

LIEBERMAN DEFENDS HIS MENTION OF RELIGION WHILE CAMPAIGNING
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     By CARLA MARINUCCI 
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
 &LR;   &LR;  ANAHEIM, Calif. _ Refusing to bow to criticism from the
Anti-Defamation League that he has overemphasized religion in his
vice presidential campaign, Democrat Joseph Lieberman said Tuesday
that he will continue to discuss ``the constructive role that faith
has traditionally played in American life, and what it can play in
our future.''
<P>
   ``The ADL has a job to do, and I respect them. In this case, I
respectfully disagree,'' Lieberman said in an interview with The
Chronicle during a campaign stop in San Diego. ``Faith is a source
of unity, I believe, and it has also been a source of good works.''
</P>
<P>
   Lieberman was quick to add that he is ``a fervent believer in
the First Amendment and the separation of church and state.'' But
the Connecticut senator added: ``I'm not talking about programs
here. I'm talking about a tone of respect _ for the place that
faith plays in people's lives and the lives of the American
people.''
</P>
<P>
   The comments by the first Orthodox Jew to be part of a
presidential ticket came in response to sharp criticism this week
from ADL director Abraham Foxman, who charged that Lieberman
appeared to be almost ``hawking religion'' in his most recent
campaign stops, in which he discussed the importance of religious
beliefs in American life.
</P>
<P>
   Foxman seemed to expand his criticism in comments to the Reuters
news service Tuesday, saying the message of both presidential
campaigns appears to be: ``Vote for me because I believe in God.''
</P>
<P>
   The mix of religion and politics threatened to overshadow
attempts in recent days by both Lieberman and Vice President Al
Gore to define differences between Democrats and Republicans on key
campaign issues like prescription drug benefits, health care and
helping working class families benefit from the ``new economy.''
</P>
<P>
   Lieberman has emphasized religion and morality throughout his
political career. He was one of the first Democrats to criticize
President Clinton over the Monica Lewinsky affair, and in the last
year, he has called for the Federal Communications Commission to
consider the content of TV programs when renewing broadcasters'
lucrative licenses.
</P>
<P>
   He has said that if it were up to him, such shows as ``Friends''
would be shown only in movie theaters or late at night so children
couldn't watch, and he once stated that Hollywood ``doesn't
understand piety.''
</P>
<P>
   In the interview, Lieberman responded to comments by
screenwriter Joe Eszterhas, who took out a full page ad in
entertainment industry publications urging Hollywood to give ``not
a penny more'' to the Gore-Lieberman team until the senator could
``clarify`' his comments on the creative freedom of the
entertainment industry. Eszterhas, author of ``Basic Instinct'' and
``Showgirls'' is in the midst of a marketing campaign for his
latest book.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't ever want to be at a point where government tells
Hollywood what movie to make as a matter of law,'' Lieberman said.
``Most of what we'd tried to do ... is to appeal to the industry to
draw its own line and acknowledge that we have a culture that's too
violent and too vulgar.
</P>
<P>
   ``And the violence and vulgarity in the movies is one of the
contributors to that,'' Lieberman said, adding, `I don't ever say
that it creates  &UR; all  &LR; the problems. It doesn't.' ''
</P>
<P>
   With just two months to go before the general election,
Lieberman's first solo trip to California since the Democratic
National Convention provided a glimpse of the Democrats'
presidential strategy for securing victory in the nation's most
populous state.
</P>
<P>
   Lieberman plunged into GOP strongholds in Southern California,
beginning the day with a spur-of-the-moment stop at an Anaheim
coffee shop, where he slid into booths with diners, asked about
their lives, then asked them: ``Anything you want to say about this
campaign?''
</P>
<P>
   Earlier in the day, Lieberman received a rousing reception at a
speech to 2,500 members of the Communications Workers of America in
Anaheim, where he was repeatedly interrupted by standing ovations,
rhythmic applause and chants of ``Go, Joe, go!''
</P>
<P>
   In a speech that focused on high-tech issues, Lieberman won
applause when he said that ``America cannot afford to have a
president in the 21st century who doesn't know the terrain of the
new economy.''
</P>
<P>
   And, outlining the differences between Democratic and Republican
tax plans, Lieberman argued, ``There's nothing wrong with being
rich. In America, we all want to be rich. But we shouldn't help
those who need it least at the expense of those who need it most.''
</P>
<P>
   Later, at Children's Hospital in San Diego, Lieberman toured
oncology wards and held a round-table discussion with health
workers and parents of critically ill children to stress the
Gore-Lieberman health care proposals _ and what he charged is a
Republican lack of planning on health issues.
</P>
<P>
   ``The government has a role to play here,'' he told Sherri Buys,
a mother from El Cajon, after she described her family's health
care problems. ``Our opponents are good people. We never say
anything about them personally. ... But our opponents, as far as I
can tell, don't have any program to deal with health insurance for
children.''
</P>
<P>
   Lieberman himself, without ever specifically mentioning
religion, raised moral and cultural issues in his speech before the
CWA.
</P>
<P>
   Praising Al and Tipper Gore for leading what he called ``a
crusade about the moral future of America,'' Lieberman said, ``They
know that many Americans have a swelling sense that our standards
of decency and civility are being eroded.''
</P>
<P>
   ``There is too much violence and vulgarity in our culture, and
it's affecting our children and our safety,'' Lieberman said. The
Democratic ticket, he promised, will ``stand up and fight for
American families so you can give kids the values and faith that
you want to give them.''
</P>
<P>
   At least one voter who heard Lieberman speak Tuesday said the
candidate had earned himself points. ``I don't care what religion
you are,'' said Buys, a Mormon and mother of five. ``As long as you
have something to believe in.''

 By SELENA ROBERTS   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ White lines marked off the court inside Arthur Ashe
Stadium, but Serena Williams arrived to defend her U.S. Open title
as if stepping out onto a dance floor, wearing a party dress from a
Woodstock reunion.
</P>
<P>
   In a black mesh outfit cut low and high, with a fuchsia-colored
tie-dyed print curving along provocative lines, Williams scrambled
to put away points in hot-pink Pumas. But as impossible as she was
to miss during her 6-3, 6-2 bludgeoning of Tina Pisnik on Tuesday,
Williams managed to camouflage herself less than an hour later. In
a hallway outside of an interview room, Williams slipped inside of
a vestibule, where she went unnoticed as Lisa Raymond exited an
adjacent door and walked past her.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't want to run into her,'' Williams admitted a few
minutes later. ``Obviously, she's probably still not feeling great.
It was a tough one to lose.''
</P>
<P>
   But Williams wasn't talking about a match. Just a week earlier,
Raymond's lawyer argued in front of an arbitrator in Manhattan that
she _ and not Williams _ had earned the right as the No. 1 doubles
player to represent the United States on the four-woman Olympic
team.
</P>
<P>
   In the past, the U.S. Tennis Association had selected the top
doubles player to be the fourth person on the team. But this time,
the coach Billie Jean King went against precedent and chose on
singles rankings alone. And although arbitrator Richard Jeydel
called the USTA's selection process unclear and misleading, he
ruled last Wednesday that Williams would remain on the team with
Lindsay Davenport, sister Venus Williams and Monica Seles.
</P>
<P>
   The outcome was devastating to Raymond. And perhaps most
upsetting to her the fact that King, famous for fighting injustices
against women, didn't come to her defense.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's definitely an irony to that,'' Raymond said after
dismissing Magdalena Grzybowska 6-1, 6-0, on the Grandstand Court
on Tuesday. ``Billie got her Dream Team.''
</P>
<P>
   America has a group capable of sweeping the medals, right down
to the powerful doubles combo of Venus and Serena Williams. This is
the intimidating team King wanted to assemble, the popular players
the USTA needs to promote the sport and the group NBC must be
thrilled to have in order to boost the Olympic television ratings.
</P>
<P>
   It's win-win for everyone but the unassuming Raymond, a career
wallflower on the Tour. Although Raymond is a top-25 singles player
and dominant in doubles, she is more solid than sizzle on the
tennis scene.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's great we have the Williams sisters,'' Raymond
said. ``I think it's great we have the Anna Kournikova's, the
rivalries with the Williamses and Lindsay and Martina Hingis. You
would just hope when you're making a decision like this, that would
be put aside.''
</P>
<P>
   Of all the attention-getters on the women's tour, Serena
Williams may be the hottest product. She is the one who rang the
opening bell on the New York Stock Exchange on Monday morning, the
one with a doll created in her stylish image and the defending
champion who turned everyone's head in her first-round match
Tuesday. With overhead smashes that sent the crowd flinching at her
might, with blistering forehands that clipped the lines, her
powerful game was on display. And so was her taste in a tennis
dress she helped design.
</P>
<P>
   ``It shows how well _ how good I look, how well in shape I am,''
said Williams with a sly smile. ``It's just really flattering, I
think.''
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Maybe the men will wear dresses next. As a sign of how anonymous
the men's tour has become, there was barely a buzz in Arthur Ashe
Stadium when second-seeded Gustavo Kuerten was upset in four sets
by Wayne Arthurs of Australia.
</P>
<P>
   Here was the tour's best hope to fill the void that will soon be
created when Pete Sampras and Andre Agassi leave the stage. Here
was the charismatic Brazilian with the colorful style and telegenic
game. Here was the one player the tour had heavily featured when
officials kicked off a marketing campaign with the slogan ``New
Balls, Please'' in an effort to promote the young stars.
</P>
<P>
   But the instant Arthurs slashed an ace by Kuerten on match
point, the moment the curly-haired French Open winner dropped his
head in defeat, the marketing campaign aimed at their American
audience during the Open suffered a humiliating hit.
</P>
<P>
   ``No, I said to them, I don't want to be promoted,'' said
Kuerten, who is an icon in Brazil. ``I'm already too much promoted.
I want to be unknown. I don't want to go and people recognize me
everywhere.''
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Some players are more comfortable with attention that others.
Serena Williams seems to revel in it. At times during her match
against Pisnik, she turned ordinary points into theater. Instead of
a simple overhead, she cracked her racket like a whip as she
crushed the ball for winners. Instead of giving up on a well-placed
passing shot by the Slovene, she raced against the odds to reach
it, if only to extend the point one stroke longer.
</P>
<P>
   Through it all, Williams put on a show for those assembled in
Arthur Ashe Stadium, the site of her first _ and, so far, only _
Grand Slam title one year ago. If Williams feels any pressure from
the hype around her, she isn't letting on. When told that John
McEnroe was quoted as saying a good male college player or senior
player could beat her, she just grinned.
</P>
<P>
   ``You want a piece of me?'' Williams said, playfully challenging
McEnroe. ``Obviously, men are stronger than women. He can throw
down if he wants. I don't know. Who knows? It's interesting. It
would be interesting to see where we stand on that.''
</P>
<P>
   Any match with Williams is usually quite a sight. Tuesday,
everyone was riveted to one of the tour's top entertainers.
</P>
<P>
   ``It seems wherever I go, there's a lot of attention on me,
anyway,'' Williams said. ``It's like I'm used to it. It really
doesn't change with the new outfit, the dolls, Stock Exchange bell.
I'm kind of used to a lot of attention.''
</P>
<P>
   She can disappear when she wants, too. Raymond never saw
Williams as she walked down the hall.
</P>
<P>
   ``She's a really nice girl,'' said Williams, who was an
unwitting participant thrown into the selection fray. ``She made it
clear that she wasn't bringing the case against me; she just
thought she should be able to go. It's completely understandable.''

COWBOYS' AIKMAN POURS EFFORTS, FUNDS INTO HELPING CHILDREN
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By CHAREAN WILLIAMS 
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ADDISON, Texas _ Although it was hard to tell, Brooke Elliott
was excited. Brooke, 10, had just met her hero, Troy Aikman. Aikman
shook her hand and asked her name, causing her to blush.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was cool,'' said Brooke, a resident of Happy Hill Farm
Academy/Home.
</P>
<P>
   Aikman was all dressed up with somewhere important to go Tuesday
on the Cowboys' first off day of the 2000 regular season. The Troy
Aikman Foundation was one of the sponsors for the Dallas Cowboys
Kickoff Luncheon.
</P>
<P>
   The annual event, which drew the entire Cowboys team to the
Hotel Intercontinental benefits The Courage House _ an abused
children's center _ located at Happy Hill Farm near Granbury.
</P>
<P>
   The Cowboys could have been golfing, running errands or resting
on their only off day of the week. Instead, they gave of their
time.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a responsibility that we have,'' Aikman said. ``It's a
big part of what we do with the foundation. That takes up a
considerable amount of our time, but I think it's something that's
worthwhile, and it's making a difference. It's not so much about
what's fun. Even though it's enjoyable, it's about being given an
opportunity to make a difference and trying to take advantage of
that.''
</P>
<P>
   It was a typical off day for Aikman.
</P>
<P>
   The Troy Aikman Foundation is busy building interactive
playrooms in children's hospitals across the country. Three ``End
Zones'' are open already, including one at Cook Children's Medical
Center in Fort Worth, and a similar project is opening soon at St.
Anthony's in Oklahoma City, where Aikman's sister, Tammy Powell, is
program director. Others are planned for Houston, Indianapolis and
the UCLA Medical Center.
</P>
<P>
   ``When he formed the foundation, it was because he had done a
lot of charity work, golf tournaments and whatever, and even though
he knew a lot of money was raised, he never knew where it went,''
said Aikman's mother, Charlyn Aikman, who runs The Troy Aikman
Foundation. ``You never saw a face with where the money was going.
When he formed his foundation, it was with the idea that we would
help individual children one-on-one, but we were raising more money
than what people were applying for.
</P>
<P>
   ``One of the board members had the idea of building an
interactive, high-tech playroom in a children's hospital, so the
children could go in there and have a place just to get away from
their rooms and do something interesting. We did the one in Dallas
and thought that would be it. Well, now we've got hospitals calling
us and saying, `Can we have one?' That is now 100 percent of our
focus.''
</P>
<P>
   Aikman shows up for the grand openings of his ``End Zones,'' and
then occasionally makes unannounced visits to spend time with the
hospitalized children. Tuesday, he spent his day with the children
of Happy Hill Farm.
</P>
<P>
   ``Troy's profile is very high,'' said Ed Shipman, the founder of
Happy Hill Farm. ``He has been very good to me. He came down to the
farm a couple of years ago and toured the campus with the kids.
They know Troy, and they know a lot of the Cowboys on a first-name
basis. In terms of role models, he's the kind of guy who is right
out there in front, and we're very grateful for that
relationship.'' nn

 LAWMAKERS APPROVE STRICTER CAR SEAT MEASURE  &HT;     By GREG LUCAS 
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SACRAMENTO _ In a move to reduce the number of children killed
or maimed in car crashes, lawmakers approved a bill Tuesday
requiring car safety seats or booster seats for kids younger than 6
years and lighter than 60 pounds.
</P>
<P>
   Currently, the seats are required for children under age 4 or
less than 40 pounds.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not at all uncommon for children over age 4 ... to slip
out of the belt, get thrown from the car and suffer severe brain or
spinal injuries,'' said state Sen. Jackie Speier, D-Hillsborough,
the bill's author. ``This bill is probably not as far as we should
go.''
</P>
<P>
   Under Speier's bill, the $100 fine for child seat violations
would rise to $250 for subsequent offenses. Violations also would
cost one point on a driver's record, which could lead to more
expensive auto insurance.
</P>
<P>
   The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration recommends
that all states require seats for children weighing between 40 and
80 pounds.
</P>
<P>
   Seventy-one percent of deaths and 66 percent of injuries in car
accidents would be eliminated if children were properly restrained
in safety seats, booster seats or seatbelts, according to the
group.
</P>
<P>
   Gov. Gray Davis is expected to sign the bill. Last year, he
objected to a tougher car safety bill carried by Speier.
</P>
<P>
   The new age and weight requirements would take effect January 1,
2002.
</P>
<P>
   Car accidents are the leading cause of death for California
children ages 5 through 7. In 1998, 697 children under age 6 died
in car crashes. Nearly 100,000 were injured, according to
government data.
</P>
<P>
   Since 1991, the state has required children younger than 4 or
less than 40 pounds to ride in car safety seats. Speier's bill,
although aimed at ensuring that larger children use booster seats,
is slightly different. It would exempt kids over 6 or over 60
pounds, whichever comes first.
</P>
<P>
   Safety seats are designed for infants and small children and
have a protective case and their own seat belts. Booster seats
allow shoulder and lap seatbelts, which are designed to fit a
168-pound adult rider, to cross a child in the correct places _
over the chest and below the pelvis. Many child safety seats are
designed to convert to boosters as the child gets bigger.
</P>
<P>
   ``As parents we all sort of thought its safe to put bigger kids
in adult seat belts. It's not,'' Speier said.
</P>
<P>
   Several groups including the American Pediatric Association
recommend booster seats be used until a child weighs 80 pounds and
is at least 4 feet 10 inches tall.
</P>
<P>
   That would generally mean children under age 10 sit on boosters.
</P>
<P>
   Speier's bill initially required children up to age 7 to use
safety or booster seats but contained no weight limits.
</P>
<P>
   It would have made California the first state to have such a
law, she said. Since then, Washington has enacted a similar law.
</P>
<P>
   Davis objected to the lack of a weight ceiling in Speier's
original bill. Speier scaled back the measure to win his signature.
</P>
<P>
   The 40-member Senate sent the bill to Davis by a vote of 24 to
9.

EYES SEEM TO BELIE COWBOYS' VIEWPOINT
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By CLARENCE E. HILL JR. 
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Who are you going to believe, me or your lying eyes?
</P>
<P>
   That's the question that comes to mind when assessing the Dallas
Cowboys' less-than-stellar preseason play, and then listening to
them go on about how good they're going to be this season.
</P>
<P>
   It makes one feel like a naive lover who catches his partner
with someone else, yet believes her when she says, ``It wasn't
me.'' You know what you saw, but you know what you want to believe.
</P>
<P>
   What you know is that quarterback Troy Aikman, he of the three
Super Bowl rings and superb accuracy, is in his favorite offense
again.
</P>
<P>
   Emmitt Smith, the third-ranked rusher in NFL history and owner
of four rushing titles to go along with three Super Bowl rings, is
still the running back.
</P>
<P>
   Receivers Joey Galloway and Raghib Ismail are the fastest combo
in the league, which in turn should mean the most explosive.
</P>
<P>
   Jackie Harris, a former All-Pro, is expected to be the best
inside target the Cowboys have had at tight end since Jay Novacek
retired.
</P>
<P>
   Toss in extremely capable backups in quarterback Randall
Cunningham and running back Chris Warren, and more speed at
receiver in Jason Tucker, James McKnight and Wane McGarity, and
it's hard find a team other than the Super Bowl champion St. Louis
Rams with more weapons.
</P>
<P>
   Certainly, no team in the NFC East compares to the Cowboys'
offense, not even the favored Redskins.
</P>
<P>
   But let's consider a few other things:
</P>
<P>
   The Cowboys will be hard-pressed to be hitting on all cylinders
when the season opens, considering they are running a new offense.
Only Smith, Aikman, center Mark Stepnoski, guard Larry Allen and
tackle Erik Williams were around when they used the system from
1992-1997.
</P>
<P>
   There's no way the six other members of the offense will be as
comfortable against the Eagles on Sunday as they will be in
December, which is good considering that's the toughest part of the
Cowboys' schedule. Three of their final four games are against
Tampa Bay, Washington and Tennessee.
</P>
<P>
   However, it also means that the Cowboys need to get off to a
good start, so the season won't hinge on those final games.
</P>
<P>
   The Cowboys are 6-19 on the road the past three years combined,
including a 1-12 mark against nondivision opponents. The Cowboys'
four nondivision road opponents _ Tennessee, Tampa Bay, Baltimore
and Carolina _ are playoff and Super Bowl contenders. Having talent
on paper is one thing, but the Cowboys must prove they have the
character to take care of business away from home.
</P>
<P>
   Coach Dave Campo promised that the Cowboys, who led the league
in penalties last season, would be more disciplined in 2000. While
winning exhibition games doesn't matter, you can assess a team's
ability to execute and eliminate mental miscues. The Cowboys didn't
show they've overcome their penalty problems in the preseason.
Sure, the Cowboys have weapons, but how do we know they won't shoot
themselves in the foot?
</P>
<P>
   As usual, the defense is considered the team's weak link. Most
experts say the Cowboys will have to outscore opponents to win,
citing the uncertainty in the secondary and their inability to rush
the passer and stop the run in the preseason. Signing former Giants
cornerback Phillippi Sparks helps the secondary, but Sparks is
weeks away from being in optimum shape.
</P>
<P>
   The Cowboys must prove there is life without middle linebacker
Randall Godfrey (Tennessee) against the run, and Deion Sanders
(Washington) in the secondary.
</P>
<P>
   Sure, Sanders was hurt for much of last season, but opponents
didn't target his side of the field on a regular basis. The Cowboys
like the combo of Sparks and Ryan McNeil at cornerback. Neither,
however, strikes fear in opposing quarterbacks.
</P>
<P>
   Despite what you saw in the preseason, Cowboys defensive
coordinator Mike Zimmer guarantees that they will be able to rush
the passer with defensive ends Greg Ellis and Ebenezer Ekuban and
tackles Leon Lett and Alonzo Spellman.
</P>
<P>
   ``We will get the passer unless we just grossly over-evaluated
our players,'' Zimmer said.
</P>
<P>
   Ellis' 1999 performance, Lett's Pro Bowl past and Spellman's
dominance in practices gives credence to Zimmer's promises.
</P>
<P>
   But it smacks of an unfaithful lover saying ``trust me.''
</P>
<P>
   So, who are you going to believe, your eyes or the Cowboys?

STATUS OF LUCKY, SPARKS NEVER SEEMED THIS ELITE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By RANDY GALLOWAY 
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   I'm wondering. Do you figure Mike Lucky ever knew he was this
important? And what about Phillippi Sparks? He had actually retired
from the game. As it turned out, Sparky undersold his ability by a
mere $2 million, maybe more.
</P>
<P>
   But as the Dallas Cowboys scurried around this week to fill
talent gaps (that's a tad worrisome, don't you think? Mere days
before the regular season opens, and the local team has to still
``scurry''?), the addition of a third-string tight end and a
nondescript journeyman cornerback caused jubilation at Valley
Ranch.
</P>
<P>
   Hey, I read it in the paper, so it must be true. Jerry has gone
sleepless this week because of a continuing case of the giggles.
And Camps is wearing a smile wider than the grill on a '57
Cadillac.
</P>
<P>
   All this joy resulted because of O.J. Santiago, a tight end no
longer wanted in Atlanta (speaking of worrisome _ the Falcons don't
want you?), and Mr. Sparks, a cornerback who told the Giants he was
retiring after last season and the Giants replying, ``What took you
so long?''
</P>
<P>
   But as a businessman, there is no doubting Phillippi. He turned
retirement into a financial bonanza, after he had spent the summer
turning down the Jerry Jones offer of a minimal NFL contract valued
at $444,000. Then cornerback desperation took over for the Cowboys,
once it became obvious that Kareem Larrimore wasn't yet prepared to
take over.
</P>
<P>
   Phillippi, the shrewd one, will pocket $2 million, bonus
included, for 2000, and can make another million if he's still
around next season. The Cowboys hope he won't be, but that depends.
</P>
<P>
   Anyway, the last time Jones paid out this kind of big dollars to
talk a guy out of retirement, he ended up with coach Gunsmoke.
Hopefully, that won't be a reflection on Phillippi.
</P>
<P>
   But while Sparks has earned All-Pro honors for business smarts
in the jock kingdom, his summer still pales in comparison with Mike
Lucky's. From almost total football obscurity, Lucky is now an NFL
legend. Yes, legend.
</P>
<P>
   When misfortune struck Lucky early in training camp, he ended up
on crutches with a blown-out knee, his second NFL season over and
done with. But to be harsh about it, the Cowboys' year didn't
exactly hinge on the absence of a third-string tight end. Or did
it?
</P>
<P>
   Seven tight ends came to Wichita Falls trying unsuccessfully to
replace Lucky. Seven of 'em. All released.
</P>
<P>
   The eighth turned up this week in Santiago, who does have some
proven NFL ability, and the Cowboys were thrilled to surrender a
fourth-round draft pick next year, and a seventh-rounder the year
after.
</P>
<P>
   Tell me this: What other player in NFL history went down with an
injury and it took eight guys to replace him? Like I said, Mike
Lucky, the legend.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday, it was mentioned to a Cowboys' staffer how shocking it
was to only now realize the value of Lucky, while not realizing
what his July injury had meant.
</P>
<P>
   ``We tried to tell you,'' came the answer. And yes, they did.
But obviously, I didn't have the proper appreciation for
third-string tight ends, or an understanding yet of the Jack Reilly
offense.
</P>
<P>
   Talk about intrigue. Forget Joey and Rocket, what the heck does
Reilly have planned for his three-headed tight end monster of
Harris-LaFleur-Santiago? We all wait in eager anticipation, which
is also the case for young Philadelphia quarterback Donovan McNabb,
except for different reasons.
</P>
<P>
   The Eagles, who provide the opening-game competition for the
Cowboys on Sunday at Texas Stadium, have installed a bombing-raid
kind of passing attack to fit the immense talents of McNabb. Don't
you know Donovan's game face had to light up Monday when he took a
film-look at the Cowboys' defensive misfortunes of the exhibition
season.
</P>
<P>
   Larrimore, of course, was hardly the lone problem, but as a
rookie corner, he became the focus. And with Sparks in questionable
physical condition, Kareem could still be seeing plenty of action
against the Eagles.
</P>
<P>
   Snideness and jokes aside, the signing of Sparks was a
necessity. You might say Jones was forced to wisely buy 2 million
bucks worth of time for Larrimore to relax and not feel the
pressure. The kid seemed to be doing OK until two weeks ago in the
exhibition game at Denver. The Broncos chewed on him badly that
night and, as was feared, that experience appeared to spook Kareem.
His confidence suffered.
</P>
<P>
   Larrimore was basically handed the starting left corner spot
after fellow rookie Mario Edwards was injured. So, of course, was
the second-round rookie pick, Dwayne Goodrich, but Goodrich's
injury came after he had fallen far behind the other rooks in the
immediate cornerback pecking order.
</P>
<P>
   Do not buy into Valley Ranch current excuses that Larrimore was
only listed No. 1 because of the pending retirement of Kevin Smith.
It was known after the Valley Ranch minicamps in June that Kevin's
on-going physical problems were beyond repair. Actually, Charlie
Williams was the probable stop-gap solution at left corner, until
the rookies matured, but he also has been shut down with injuries.
</P>
<P>
   The Cowboys were banking on Larrimore being the immediate
answer, and if not him, Edwards. That's why Sparks stayed on hold
until now. But it's not a disgrace for Larrimore to need seasoning.
This is normal for most corners. Even Kevin Smith, as great as he
once was, didn't start until the 11th game of his rookie season.
Old-time fans will remember Ike Holt, ordinary at best, holding the
job until Kevin was declared ready to go.
</P>
<P>
   Valley Ranch glowed this week with the smiles of Jerry and Dave
Campo. The rest of us start finding out on Sunday just how
permanent those smiles will be.

&HT;    WRITER OF ``BASIC INSTINCT'' WANTS DEMOCRATIC GIFTS FROZEN
</HEADLINE>
(For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
 &HT;    By DANA BARTHOLOMEW 
c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News

<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Bad boy screenwriter Joe Eszterhas urged Hollywood
on Tuesday to withhold contributions from the Democratic
presidential campaign until its leaders clear up what he calls
not-so-veiled threats of movie censorship.
</P>
<P>
   The angry screed from the author of ``Basic Instinct'' was
splashed across the back page of Daily Variety on Tuesday and urged
moviemakers to withhold money from Democratic presidential
candidate Vice President Al Gore and his running mate, Sen. Joe
Lieberman.
</P>
<P>
   ``Joe Lieberman frightens me,'' Eszterhas wrote of the senator
who has campaigned for Hollywood to curtail graphic sex and
violence.
</P>
<P>
   ``He makes not-so-veiled threats about censorship by government
legislation if we don't censor ourselves. Not a penny more until he
`clarifies' his positions.''
</P>
<P>
   Eszterhas demanded that the Connecticut senator speak with
writers and directors of violent or sexually graphic films. Besides
``Basic Instinct,'' Eszterhaus wrote ``Showgirls'' and recently
published ``American Rhapsody,'' which he claims reveals ``ultimate
truths'' about the Clinton presidency.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you're going to hold the (political) right to a certain
yardstick about creative expression and freedom of speech,''
Eszterhas told the Daily News, ``then let's hold that same
yardstick to the politically correct left.''
</P>
<P>
   Many in an industry famous for its Democratic Party support
declined to comment Tuesday on Eszterhas' $5,600 ad.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wouldn't touch it with a 10-foot pole,'' said a well-known
Hollywood agent who asked that his name not be used.
</P>
<P>
   ``In this town, to come out against a Jew, the (entertainment)
industry, the Democratic Party -- you'd never work again, unless
you're Joe Eszterhas. How many Republicans do you know working in
this town?''
</P>
<P>
   Tipper Gore, the would-be first lady, has called for ratings on
compact disks containing references to sex and violence, and the
censorship has threatened to singe the Democratic ticket ever since
Lieberman was chosen.
</P>
<P>
   Neither the vice president nor Lieberman has advocated movie
censorship, a campaign spokeswoman said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Rather, both have fought for voluntary guidelines from the
industry and tools for the parents so parents can have more
controls over what (children) watch, such as the V-chip,'' said
Maria Meir, western field director for the Gore campaign.
</P>
<P>
   ``We understand that parents are struggling to pass on right
values in a culture that seems sometimes chaotic and sometimes
cruel. Democrats feel that parents need to have more control over
the images their children are exposed to.''
</P>
<P>
   The Parents Television Council, which has called for an industry
curb on sex and violence, said Eszterhas' exhortation to Hollywood
will never stop the million-dollar checks.
</P>
<P>
   ``Earth to Joe Eszterhas: Wake up and realize that Joe Lieberman
could be a (movie industry) ally,'' said Brent Bozell, the
council's chairman in Alexandria, Va. ``He's not a grenade thrower,
so why make him into one?''
</P>
<P>
   Johnny Grant, 77, a Republican who serves as honorary mayor of
Hollywood, said he doesn't like to knock anyone, even Eszterhas.
</P>
<P>
   ``Joe's in his own world,'' he said. ``I live in Hollywood;
Joe's on another planet.''

 BATTLE LINES DRAWN IN LAST ALASKAN WILDERNESS  &HT;     By GLEN MARTIN 
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ON THE COPPER RIVER, South Central Alaska _ Brown bears are not
seen particularly often in this region, but they are omnipresent _
both in the bush and inside your head.
</P>
<P>
   They leave their tracks along the beach at every camp, sometimes
right by your tent. They are the sovereigns of this green and rainy
realm; you are the vulnerable interloper.
</P>
<P>
   Yet these 1,500-pound predators are not particularly interested
in the few rafters who manage to negotiate the Copper River's
serpentine length to its delta on Prince William Sound.
</P>
<P>
   At this time of year, the bruins are here for the salmon _ for
the 400,000 sockeyes, 50,000 kings and 50,000 coho that dodge the
offshore commercial fleet and swim up the Copper's turbid waters to
spawn in its hundreds of clear tributary creeks.
</P>
<P>
   Stay out of the bears' right of way, don't surprise them in the
bush, avoid getting between a sow and her cubs and you'll be OK.
Usually.
</P>
<P>
   The bears and the salmon are firm evidence of the Copper's wild,
even primeval, state. By any measure, this is one of the last great
wilderness complexes left in the world. The 350-mile river drains
an area the size of West Virginia.
</P>
<P>
   But the 21st century is encroaching on the river, engendering a
fierce conflict in the process.
</P>
<P>
   On one side is the Eyak Corp., a consortium of Alaskan Native
Americans that claims its tribal members need dividends from
resource-extraction projects to prosper. The corporation wants to
develop the region, to open it to logging, road building and
mining.
</P>
<P>
   Leading the fight against the consortium are Dune Lankard and
Pamela Smith, traditionalist brother-and-sister Eyaks who say
development of the river's delta would doom both its rich fisheries
and native culture. Lankard and Smith have recently been joined in
their fight by Julia Butterfly Hill, the California activist who
spent two years in a Humboldt County redwood tree to protest
logging plans by the Pacific Lumber Co.
</P>
<P>
   Their confederation points to something even larger than the
issues swirling around the Copper: A growing association of
environmentalists and traditionalist natives who hope to combine
their individual skirmishes into a coordinated effort to restore
the once-contiguous coastal rain forest that stretched from Big Sur
to Prince William Sound.
</P>
<P>
   Alaska has been much tamed in recent decades, but the mighty
Copper River and its main tributaries and branches _ the Chitina,
the Tazlina, the Bremner _ are still remote, unpeopled and wholly
wild.
</P>
<P>
   Though the river _ named for a rich copper ore body in its upper
reaches _ is relatively short, it transports a huge amount of water
due to runoff from the great glaciers that crowd its innumerable
tributary valleys.
</P>
<P>
   The only sign of human activity during a typical eight-day raft
trip is the occasional bush plane. No people live here, though a
derelict cabin can sometimes be discerned through the thick scrub
of alders and cottonwoods.
</P>
<P>
   But the wildlife is extravagantly abundant. Bald eagles seem as
common as crows, perching on snags as they scan the shallows for
fish. Moose browse in the willow thickets, and mountain goats
forage on the crags that loom over the river.
</P>
<P>
   The sandbars are thick with tracks: not just brown bear, but
black bear, wolf, coyote, lynx, wolverine, marten and river otter.
</P>
<P>
   The Copper's 750,000-acre delta constitutes the biggest wetland
on the Pacific North American coast, a vast maze of tidal flats,
sloughs and channels that supports millions of shorebirds and
waterfowl.
</P>
<P>
   Copper River king and sockeye salmon are reckoned the best in
the world by many top chefs, and the season's first commercial
catches bring rarefied prices in Seattle and San Francisco.
</P>
<P>
   Yet the transcendent biological richness of the Copper River
system hangs in a delicate balance _ one, say its advocates, that
could be catastrophically upset by the developments now planned.
</P>
<P>
   Foremost among these is a road that would traverse the delta to
a huge coal deposit, incidentally opening vast portions of country
to logging, mining and recreational development.
</P>
<P>
   And there are other threats: another proposed road east of the
river to a body of gold ore, and a planned 60-mile biking and
hiking path along the Copper from a trailhead south of the river
hamlet of Chitina to the fishing town of Cordova. Critics maintain
that the trail is simply a precursor to a full-fledged state
highway.
</P>
<P>
   ``The more access, the fewer fish, the less wildlife,'' said
Lankard, an Eyak/Aleut native and commercial fisherman who helped
lead a recent raft trip down the Copper.
</P>
<P>
   ``This system may look infinitely rich, but in reality it's
limited and very sensitive,'' said Lankard. ``The salmon run is
already reduced from what it was several years ago. We have more
subsistence dip netters (anglers fishing for home use) each year.
There's a jet boat working the lower river. It all adds up.''
</P>
<P>
   Lankard is trying to impose a vastly ambitious vision on the
river and the delta, one that is without precedent: A cultural
easement.
</P>
<P>
   Like the commonly employed conservation easement, it would
protect natural resources by paying landowners to relinquish
development rights.
</P>
<P>
   But Lankard's plan goes a step further: It would formally
empower the Eyaks _ who have inhabited the Copper River region for
about 3,500 years _ as part of the conservation plan, allowing them
subsistence hunting, fishing and gathering rights.
</P>
<P>
   The Eyaks, said Lankard, are as much a part of the Copper River
ecosystem as the bears and the salmon.
</P>
<P>
   Roaming through the Copper's gorges and delta, fishing for kings
and sockeyes, hunting the seals that swim 80 miles upriver in
pursuit of the salmon, picking the abundant berries, mushrooms and
fiddlehads _ these are all activities integral to Eyak culture,
Lankard said.
</P>
<P>
   ``In Eyak tradition, people, fish and wildlife are all fellow
beings inhabiting the same sacred place,'' said Lankard. ``The
river and delta are our mother _ and you don't sell mom.''
</P>
<P>
   The salmon is an especially sacred emblem for the Eyak,
pervading diet, social life and religion. When Lankard fishes the
dangerous waters off the delta, he always prays to &UR; Wilghtnee, &LR;  the
Eyak salmon goddess.
</P>
<P>
   ``And she's always brought me home safely,'' he said, `'though
once I had to change a starter when my boat was drifting (without
engines) into the breakers, and another time I had to be airlifted
out.''
</P>
<P>
   Lankard wants to use federal conservation funds to establish an
easement on the Copper River system, preserving its fisheries,
wildlife and forests in perpetuity.
</P>
<P>
   He also favors buying out the development rights from native
corporations and private investors for the coalfields east of the
delta.
</P>
<P>
   ``The owner of the fields has indicated he'd be willing to
establish an easement for $10 (million) to $15 million,'' Lankard
said. ``He knows development will involve a lot of delay and
expensive litigation, and he seems agreeable to a smaller profit in
the short term.''
</P>
<P>
   Lankard is finding some powerful allies in the environmental
community. The National Wildlife Federation, the Wilderness
Society, the Sierra Club and the Audubon Society have all joined
his cause, as has the tree-sitting activist Hill.
</P>
<P>
   Hill accompanied Lankard on his recent trip down the Copper. She
acknowledged her support for native subsistence hunting and fishing
rights may draw fire from some environmental and animal-rights
advocates who have supported her in the past, but she was
unperturbed by the prospect.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've always gone with my heart, not by what's popular,'' she
said. ``Fishing and hunting for food is basic to Eyak culture. The
Eyaks have a profound respect for the fish and wildlife they take,
and they consume it reverently. I have a far greater problem with
factory farming.''
</P>
<P>
   Hill is also joining forces with Lankard and other coastal
activists to promote the idea of protecting the Pacific rain forest
as one entity, a single forest that runs from Big Sur to south
central Alaska.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are redwoods in the south and spruce in the north, but
it was originally one forest, and it should be restored as one
forest,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   But Lankard is also facing formidable resistance _ including
from many of his 325 fellow shareholders in the Eyak Corp., which
controls about 100,000 acres of forestland around the river and
Prince William Sound.
</P>
<P>
   After oil was discovered on Alaska's North Slope in the late
1960s, federal legislation was passed that deeded vast amounts of
land to state tribal corporations.
</P>
<P>
   Tribal members thus became shareholders in their corporations _
and dividends depended on the exploitation of tribal lands through
logging, mining and development.
</P>
<P>
   Lankard believes such development undermines the very essence of
being native. And besides, he said, the tribal corporations have
been abysmally inept at providing fat dividends through the
liquidation of natural resources.
</P>
<P>
   The Eyak Corp. was founded in 1971. By 2002, it will have paid a
total of $102,000 to each shareholder.
</P>
<P>
   More money can be made for the Eyaks, Lankard believes, by
selling conservation easements for tribal forests and by promoting
environmentally sound activities such as regulated commercial
fishing and ecotourism.
</P>
<P>
   Lankard points to some success in this regard. He worked long
and hard to stop logging on 3,000 tribal acres near Cordova on
Nelson Bay, and the corporation ultimately negotiated a $3.6
million easement deal with a trustee council formed to disburse
settlement money after the 1989 Exxon Valdez oil spill.
</P>
<P>
   A year later, the corporation sold easements on an additional
77,000 acres to the federal government for $50 million.
</P>
<P>
   But while those actions have basically put the tribe out of the
logging business, Eyak Corp. managers still view some resource
development as essential to the well-being of shareholders.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't support all forms of resource development, but I do
believe in balance,'' said Brian Lettich, general manager for the
Eyak Corp. ``I don't think we should lock everything up.''
</P>
<P>
   Lettich said fishing and tourism are not enough to support
Cordova, where most of the region's residents _ including Eyaks _
live.
</P>
<P>
   ``The fishing has been fairly bad in recent years, and even when
it's good a lot of the money leaves town each winter because
fishermen are transient _ they live in Anchorage, Seattle or
Bellingham,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Lettich says only the development of natural resources can
support and improve the region's infrastructure.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's always been that way up here,'' he said. ``Resource
development pays taxes for roads, water systems, sewers and city
services. If it wasn't for the roads and airstrips that exist in
Cordova and Chitina, Dune and his folks couldn't raft the Copper.
They wouldn't have access.''
</P>
<P>
   For that reason, Lettich supports the proposed road to the
coalfields east of the delta.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Eyak Corp. wouldn't benefit from the road that much _ most
of the land is controlled by the Chugach (native) Corp.,'' said
Lettich. ``But it would really improve Cordova's economic base.''
</P>
<P>
   That position rankles David Grimes, who was also on the recent
raft trip down the Copper with Lankard.
</P>
<P>
   Grimes, a commercial fisherman, raft guide and co-founder of the
Coastal Coalition, which was formed after the Exxon Valdez oil
spill to lobby for the protection of Prince William Sound and its
surrounding forests, said the last thing the Copper needs is more
development.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's already developed,'' he said. ``We have the finest
biological development in the world, and we already have a superb
access corridor _ the river.''
</P>
<P>
   Grimes is particularly concerned about the proposed bike trail
down the Copper, a project enthusiastically supported by Alaska
Gov. Tony Knowles.
</P>
<P>
   He explained his fears as he adroitly rowed around and through
the Copper's heaving boils, whirlpools and eddy lines.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's promoted as a bike path, but it will be built with heavy
equipment and helicopters,'' Grimes said. ``It will involve
spanning dozens of creeks, rivers and gorges with trestles, it will
allow passage for three-wheel all-terrain vehicles, and it will
cost tens of millions of dollars.''
</P>
<P>
   Grimes pointed to a sign that had been recently tacked to a
shoreline cottonwood.
</P>
<P>
   ``That marks an access easement through native lands to U.S.
Forest Service lands and the Richardson Highway,'' he said. ``What
you basically have here is (a stalking horse) for a river highway.
The ultimate goal is a road.''
</P>
<P>
   At Abercrombie Rapids, the Copper _ which in some places is a
mile wide _ narrows to about 250 yards. Brown bears congregate here
to catch salmon, and harbor seals ply the surge of the main
channel, having followed the fish up from the sea.
</P>
<P>
   Grimes rowed hard for the north bank at the rapids, beaching the
raft on a small sandbar. The group cautiously disembarked.
</P>
<P>
   Bear scat and prints were everywhere. Across the river, five
brown bears _ including a sow and two cubs _ paced the banks,
gazing hungrily into the silty water.
</P>
<P>
   Abruptly, a bear walked out of the alders and intensely regarded
the group from a distance of 75 yards.
</P>
<P>
   ``Avoid eye contact and walk slowly back to the raft,'' Grimes
said. As the group inched backward, the bear ambled back to the
river for more fish.
</P>
<P>
   ``The state wants to build a bear-viewing platform here,'' said
Grimes as he rowed out of the eddy to the main current. ``You don't
think that will change the character of this place? The bears will
be constantly distracted from their fishing by hikers and mountain
bikers, and sooner or later you'll have (an attack). Then what?''
</P>
<P>
   Like Hill and Lankard, Grimes supports the idea of conserving
the Pacific rain forest as a single ecosystem. He said the key to
restoring and protecting it is to make sure wild salmon have the
conditions they need to thrive.
</P>
<P>
   ``All the forests from Alaska to California originally supported
wild salmon,'' he said. ``Salmon are basically forest creatures, so
if the runs are healthy, the forests are healthy. That means the
watersheds are stable, you have good cover from old-growth trees,
you have good biodiversity. Wild salmon are the prime indicators
for forest health along the Pacific Coast.''
</P>
<P>
   To Smith, Lankard's sister, the Copper River system and the
creatures that inhabit it are essential for resuscitating Eyak
culture.
</P>
<P>
   Smith is a member of a group of Eyak traditionalists that is
trying to preserve tribal identity _ partly through lobbying to
establish conservation easements on Eyak lands, partly through the
revival of local ceremonies.
</P>
<P>
   She was instrumental in organizing the first potlatch _ a
traditional gathering focused on feasting and gift-giving _ to be
hosted by the Eyaks in almost a century.
</P>
<P>
   At a proper potlatch, the Eyaks believe, everyone and everything
shows up _ not just human guests, but the spirits of ancestors and
wildlife, and the very essence of the natural elements.
</P>
<P>
   ``We held it at midsummer, when we figured the weather would be
best,'' Smith recalled. ``But the worst summer storm in years hit
as it got under way.''
</P>
<P>
   The celebrants moved into a large warehouse, said Smith. There
was no power, it was cold and dark, and the storm raged outside
with unrestrained ferocity.
</P>
<P>
   ``We just had the people, our food and the (ceremonial) drums,''
she said. ``So I apologized about the weather to one of the elders
who was there.''
</P>
<P>
   Smith's voice caught at the memory, and she paused before
continuing.
</P>
<P>
   ``He told me, `Don't you understand? You invited everyone _ and
they  &UR; all  &LR; came.' ''

the Rangers' $68 million payroll.

   Hicks, speaking Tuesday before the Rangers' 12-1 loss to the
Cleveland Indians at The Ballpark, said he doesn't know exactly how
much the payroll will increase. He said it will depend on who the
Rangers can acquire, either by trade or through free agency.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's nothing magic,'' Hicks said. ``We'll take it position by
position and pitcher by pitcher. We'll spend what we need to
spend.''
</P>
<P>
   Hicks was at The Ballpark on Tuesday night to help honor former
club president Tom Schieffer. He'll be back again Wednesday for his
monthly meeting with general manager Doug Melvin and manager Johnny
Oates. They have much to talk about.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm frustrated like everybody else,'' Hicks said.
</P>
<P>
   Hicks said he does not see next year as being a choice between
staying with younger players or spending a lot of money on veteran
players to fill the many holes on the team.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody talks about following the White Sox's model,'' Hicks
said. ``I don't see us following the White Sox's model, the
Yankees' model or the Orioles' model. Well, I know we're not going
to be like the Orioles. We're going to continue to follow the
Rangers' model.
</P>
<P>
   ``I agree with Doug Melvin's philosophy. You need to have a
strong core of good players, some young players pushing them from
below and then you add through free agency what you need to round
out the team. We've got good young players and we've got the
flexibility to add free agents. It doesn't have to be one way or
another.''
</P>
<P>
   It has to be some way or his manager may go nuts, if he hasn't
already. He watched the Cleveland Indians pummel starter Ryan Glynn
for five runs in five innings, add five more off reliever Francisco
Cordero and cruise the rest of the way behind starter Steve
Woodard.
</P>
<P>
   Oates said he spent most of the game on the bench thinking and,
``I'm totally wiped out between the ears.''
</P>
<P>
   Said Oates: What do I think? How do I act?' Everyone is
frustrated, discouraged. We're all soul-searching and spellbound.
In 33 years, I've never experienced anything like this.''
</P>
<P>
   Glynn was making his first start since fainting in the dugout
Aug. 11, and Oates said: ``I think he was trying to overthrow a
little bit. Stuff-wise he had good stuff, but he didn't locate it
very well. He got a little hyper, which is understandable since
it's been a while since he's been out there.''
</P>
<P>
   Oates said Glynn will be fine. He said his team will be fine. He
just doesn't know when.
</P>
<P>
   ``This ballclub won't lose every game the rest of the season,
even though it looks that way,'' Oates said. ``We'll get it turned
around.''
</P>
<P>
   Hicks is determined that it will happen next year. He also
remains determined that Oates will be there to see it happen. Hicks
repeated again Tuesday that Melvin and Oates won't be held
responsible for the collapse.
</P>
<P>
   ``This team won three division titles in the past five years,''
Hicks said. ``We're going to go through this project together. If I
ever lose confidence in them, it will be for reasons that haven't
happened yet.'' nn

CORA GETS THE DODGERS THINKING
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BRIAN DOHN  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   MILWAUKEE _ Alex Cora has proven to the Dodgers he can be
effective at the plate along with providing stellar defense, and in
the process it should refocus the Dodgers' offseason efforts.
</P>
<P>
   Alex Rodriguez is the marquee free agent in the upcoming class,
but the Dodgers won't be ultra-active in courting him because of
Cora's play at shortstop this season and the Dodgers' need to
upgrade its starting pitching, baseball sources said.
</P>
<P>
   As late as May, the Dodgers had questions about whether Cora
could handle himself at the plate. He had batted .143 with three
RBI in parts of 1998 and 1999, and the memory of him getting
overpowered against San Diego closer Trevor Hoffman in '98 has
faded.
</P>
<P>
   Cora's played well defensively, and though he's been streaky
offensively, he's handled the bat well. Cora went 2 for 4 Tuesday
against Milwaukee and is batting .265 with three homers and 23 RBI.
</P>
<P>
   Dodgers general manager Kevin Malone said Cora's established
himself as an everyday major-league shortstop.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm very confident with him,'' Malone said. ``I think he's a
potential Gold Glove defender. He's definitely shown he can handle
himself offensively. I'm excited about his future. I think he's a
winning player. He does a lot of things to help you win.''
</P>
<P>
   The Dodgers won't turn a deaf ear when it comes to Rodriguez,
but they no longer believe they have to make an all-out run to
acquire him because of Cora's development, sources said.
</P>
<P>
   GOIN' WITH FIVE: If the Dodgers get back in the playoff race and
make a run during the last few weeks of the season, they'll go down
the stretch with a five-man rotation. Because of Darren Dreifort's
right arm troubles, Dodgers manager Davey Johnson said he wouldn't
go to a four-man rotation late in the season.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not going to happen,'' Johnson said. ``That won't happen.
He usually has a hard time throwing on the second day (after a
start).''
</P>
<P>
   Johnson has used discretion and given Dreifort an extra day or
two to rest whenever possible. That was again the plan this time
through the rotation until lefty Carlos Perez pitched in relief
Sunday. Therefore, Dreifort, who's 10-7 with a 4.48 ERA, was moved
to today. It marks the 14th time in 26 starts he's pitched on a
``normal'' four days of rest.
</P>
<P>
   Since the All-Star break, Dreifort's started four times on four
days' rest. He's 3-0 with a 2.74 ERA in those starts.
</P>
<P>
   ``At some time you have to go to the whip,'' Malone said. ``I
personally don't feel it's an issue.''
</P>
<P>
   COURT TALK: It's unlikely any of the 21 members of the Dodgers
organization subpoenaed will actually have to appear in court, said
Mike Abernathy, the Chicago-based lawyer representing the Dodgers
in the criminal proceedings stemming from the May 16 brawl at
Wrigley Field.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think 19 Dodgers or 21 Dodgers are going to be
traipsing into the courtroom for this,'' Abernathy said. ``This is
a misdemeanor, and videotapes are usually enough.''
</P>
<P>
   Abernathy said defense lawyers were denied access to Major
League Baseball's files on the incident pertaining to the Dodgers
and Chicago Cubs. The hearings were for the disorderly conduct
cases against James Maness and Ronald Camacho. The trial won't be
until November, Abernathy said.
</P>
<P>
   The disorderly conduct case of George Carlin is set for Sept.
18, but Abernathy said he would file motions to strike the
subpoenas to a group that includes manager Davey Johnson and
general manager Kevin Malone. &QL;

PARK TOSSES ONE-HITTER IN DODGERS' WIN
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BRIAN DOHN  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   MILWAUKEE _ If a borderline 3-1 pitch in the sixth inning wasn't
called a strike, Dodgers right-hander Chan Ho Park may have been
celebrating more than just an overpowering outing.
</P>
<P>
   Park, along with his teammates, could have celebrated a
no-hitter.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, James Mouton homered on the next pitch for Milwaukee's
only hit as Park struck out a career-high 14 in a 7-2 victory that
was the most commanding performance of his career Tuesday at County
Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   Not only did Mouton's homer end Park's no-hit bid at 52/3
innings, but the Brewers didn't come close to another hit.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's nothing you can say,'' Brewers hitting coach Rod Carew
said. ``He just dominated us. That's the best I've ever seen him
throw.''
</P>
<P>
   Second baseman Mark Grudzielanek tied a career high with four
RBI on three hits, but he was certainly overshadowed. Park (14-8)
walked three and hit a batter, but the first Milwaukee runner to
reach base came after first baseman Eric Karros' fielding error
with one out in the fourth inning. Mouton's homer came after a
two-out walk to pinch hitter Mark Sweeney.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't know it was a no-hitter,'' said Park, who has won 21
of his last 30 decisions. ``After the home run, I was mad about
(it) because it was a ball. After that, I was looking at the people
get excited and I checked the scoreboard and it was one hit. That's
how I knew, and I said, `OK, forget about everything.'''
</P>
<P>
   The Dodgers (70-62) have won eight of their last nine and have
tied a season high by going eight games over .500 for the fourth
time.
</P>
<P>
   However, the most amazing part of going 8-1 without left fielder
Gary Sheffield (he remains in Los Angeles with a viral infection)
is the ground the Dodgers have made up. They were nine games behind
first-place San Francisco in the National League West after losing
to Montreal last Monday, but after this road win _ their NL-leading
38th _ the Dodgers are five games behind the Giants.
</P>
<P>
   ``In spring training, they told me (Park) was uncomfortable
throwing certain pitches in certain counts, and I said that was
going to change,'' Dodgers catcher Chad Kreuter said. ``I want him
to be able to throw any pitch at any time, and to be successful in
the big leagues you need to have that confidence. That has
changed.''
</P>
<P>
   Park (14-8) is one win shy of tying his career high of 15, which
he established in 1997, but he's throwing as well now as he has at
any juncture of his career.
</P>
<P>
   Against the Brewers, just like he's done for the past two
months, he's mixed his slider, curve, changeup and fastball. But
the key has been his ability to throw any pitch during any count
for quality strikes.
</P>
<P>
   Park has allowed two earned runs or less in his last seven
starts, and he hasn't allowed more than three earned runs since
July 4. He's also won his last three starts and had a career-high
string of 20 scoreless innings snapped on the Mouton homer.
</P>
<P>
   ``You (saw) him change the hitter's eyesight so many times,''
pitching coach Claude Osteen said. ``He's got the hard breaking
stuff down, the changeup is down and now, boom, here's a 95 mph
fastball letter high. That's going to get a lot of people out.''
</P>
<P>
   Park's 14 strikeouts, the last of which came against Mark
Loretta to end the eighth, was the most by a Dodgers pitcher since
Hideo Nomo struck out 17 Florida Marlins on April 13, 1996.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was looking for this last year, and I've seen it now on a
regular basis,'' Dodgers manager Davey Johnson said. ``He's
focused, relaxed, making a lot of quality pitches. He still fools
around a little bit, throwing a couple flop curves up there, maybe
trying to get an easy out. But when he got serious he got 'em. All
his pitches are sharp and crisp and he's not overthrowing.'' &QL;

U.S. NEWS CHIEF AT CNN EXPECTED TO QUIT 
</HEADLINE>
   (SUBS to rewrite and expand by 250 words.)  
 By JIM RUTENBERG   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Rick Kaplan, who has been the president of CNN's U.S.
news-gathering operation since 1997, is expected to announce
Wednesday that he is leaving the network, executives close to the
situation said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   CNN executives are also planning to announce a major
reorganization of its management, reflecting dissatisfaction with
the channel's inability to turn around its weak ratings in the
absence of breaking news.
</P>
<P>
   Kaplan's resignation comes at a particularly difficult time for
CNN, a unit of Time Warner Inc., leaving its leadership unclear
during a presidential campaign.
</P>
<P>
   CNN's ratings have been sliding precipitously recently, and its
parent company is about to complete its merger with America Online.
</P>
<P>
   News of Kaplan's departure began circulating through CNN late
Tuesday afternoon and took many on his staff by surprise. There
were conflicting reports as to whether he was leaving on his own
accord or had been asked to leave.
</P>
<P>
   But CNN executives made it clear Tuesday night that although
they regarded Kaplan as a talented producer, they had been unhappy
with his management of budgets and his occasionally explosive
temper.
</P>
<P>
   His duties will be divided among a number of executives. Tom
Johnson, the chairman of CNN, will continue in his position, with
Eason Jordan, formerly of CNN International, taking over as the
chief news executive. Phil Kent of Turner Broadcasting
International will become the chief operating officer. Jim Walton,
the president of the sports division, will head the network group
for the United States. Chris Cramer, a former BBC news executive,
will take over the international group.
</P>
<P>
   The changes are being instituted by Terence F. McGuirk, the
chief executive of the Turner Broadcasting System and a longtime
and trusted lieutenant to Ted Turner, the founder of CNN. Amid
lagging CNN ratings, McGuirk, aided by Steven Heyer, the president
of TBS and former head of Booz Allen's media group, had instituted
a sweeping evaluation of the network. They are devising a plan to
start a major marketing and advertising campaign to try to counter
its lagging ratings, which have fallen during slow news days, and
because of additional competition from networks like the Fox News
Channel and MSNBC.
</P>
<P>
   Executives Tuesday night did not offer details of their
findings. Kaplan did not return phone calls. McGuirk, who is also
close to Johnson, was said to be unhappy with what one executive
called ``Mr. Kaplan's my-way-or-the highway approach.''
</P>
<P>
   Certainly, his tenure at the network has been rocky.
</P>
<P>
   Kaplan joined CNN after a 17-year career as a producer at ABC
News, where he won 34 Emmy Awards serving as executive producer of
that network's leading news programs, ``Nightline'' and ``World
News Tonight.'' He also became the first executive producer of the
ABC news magazine program ``Prime Time Live.''
</P>
<P>
   At the time of his hiring, CNN executives had said they expected
Kaplan to help them combat their traditional lull in ratings during
slow news cycles.
</P>
<P>
   Audiences tune to CNN when important news breaks but do not
commit to a regular schedule of programs. When Kaplan took over
CNN, he promised an antidote to that problem, instituting what
executives called ``appointment viewing'' _ network-news-style
programming that people would watch regularly.
</P>
<P>
   But his time at CNN had been marked by a series of
confrontations over news and personnel decisions. The main program
that Kaplan created, ``CNN NewsStand,'' was embroiled in a fiasco
in 1998 when its very first program, called ``Tailwind,'' a report
contending that U.S. forces had used nerve gas in Vietnam, was
found to be full of errors and had to be retracted, complete with
an on-the-air apology. Two producers were fired, and one executive
resigned.
</P>
<P>
   Kaplan's job was considered in jeopardy at the time, but he was
absolved of the final responsibility for the broadcast by Johnson.
</P>
<P>
   A year later, the highly popular Lou Dobbs, the anchor of the
network's most profitable program, ``Moneyline,'' quit after
fighting with Kaplan over news coverage that interrupted Dobbs'
program. ``Moneyline'' has since dropped in both ratings and
profits, and Dobbs has been publicly wooed by NBC.
</P>
<P>
   At one point last year, CNN's founder, Turner, expressed
interest in bringing Dobbs back to CNN, a move that Kaplan strongly
opposed. Dobbs did not return.
</P>
<P>
   Many at CNN had expected that Kaplan would leave the network
after the election campaign.
</P>
<P>
   The executives said that he was offered various other
opportunities with Turner Broadcasting, but that he declined them.
His departure will be effective at once.
</P>
<P>
   The executives believe they are in good hands with the new team
of Jordan and Kent.
</P>
<P>
   ``Eason Jordan may be the strongest young television executive
in the world,'' one senior Turner executive said.

FOR PRISONER'S PARENTS, A POLITICAL EDUCATION 
</HEADLINE>
   By SHAILA K. DEWAN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Wheeling a suitcase behind them, Rhoda and Mark L.
Berenson looked like any retired couple off for a vacation as they
waited in an American Airlines ticket line at La Guardia Airport
Tuesday afternoon. But the man in front of them in line knew
otherwise.
</P>
<P>
   ``Are they going to release your daughter?'' he asked.
</P>
<P>
   Although she had appeared on every news report the night before,
Mrs. Berenson was startled. ``We're so known,'' she murmured.
</P>
<P>
   But then she realized that the man was not exactly a stranger.
He was Brad Blakeman, a lawyer who works for the George W. Bush
campaign and is one of the many critical contacts she and her
husband have made over their four years of writing letters,
visiting lawmakers and talking to anyone who would listen about the
plight of their daughter, Lori Helene Berenson, 30.
</P>
<P>
   In January 1996, Ms. Berenson, 30, was convicted by a masked
military tribunal of conspiring to attack the Peruvian Congress,
and she has been imprisoned high in the Peruvian mountains on a
life sentence ever since.
</P>
<P>
   Mr. Berenson, a lifelong Democrat, started in on Blakeman,
rattling off the names of Republicans who support his efforts to
free his daughter. After the encounter, Mr. Berenson said, ``We
desperately need a way to get to George W.''
</P>
<P>
   It had been just over 24 hours since the U.S. Embassy had called
to tell the Berensons that their daughter was to be given a new
civil trial. Since then, Mr. Berenson said, they had answered 100
e-mail messages, held a news conference outside their apartment
near Gramercy Park, planned another news conference with Jesse
Jackson, and packed their bags for Tuesday's flight to Chicago to
appear on Oprah Winfrey's television show. The show's segment,
``The Fight of Your Life,'' had been scheduled before the big news.
</P>
<P>
   Since their daughter's arrest, the Berensons have gone from
professors to crusaders. They retired from their jobs _ he taught
statistics and she taught physics, both at the college level _ to
devote themselves, and a considerable amount of cash, to the
Committee to Free Lori Berenson. And they have steadfastly
maintained her innocence, despite skepticism from U.S. officials
and some human rights advocates.
</P>
<P>
   They have learned to talk Peruvian politics, and they have
learned that letters to their daughter, which have to be in Spanish
so the censors can read them, should say ``translated by a
computer'' at the top in case there is some incendiary mistake.
They have learned where to buy knitting yarn in Arequipa, where
they stay when they go to Peru to visit their daughter, taking
turns every few weeks.
</P>
<P>
   Their experience has taught them, too, that the announcement of
a new trial may not be the breakthrough many have taken it to be.
The Berensons have welcomed the news, but cautiously.
</P>
<P>
   They have already had their hopes raised and dashed countless
times, said Mrs. Berenson, 57. There was the time in June 1998 when
Peru's new prime minister said Ms. Berenson should be pardoned and
sent home, only to be immediately contradicted by the country's
real power, President Alberto K. Fujimori.
</P>
<P>
   Then there was December 1998, when the Tupac Amaru Revolutionary
Movement, a guerrilla group, took over the residence of Japan's
ambassador to Peru. The incident seemed so similar to the one Ms.
Berenson had been accused of devising with the same group that it
jeopardized attempts to secure her a new trial. More recently,
prison guards said Ms. Berenson was drawing an escape plan, but it
was actually just a knitting diagram for a cat pattern that her
mother admired.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's very difficult to be an individual human being depending
on a large government for your life, because they're just not
geared to focus on individuals,'' Mrs. Berenson said. ``It's like
what that one congressman said: Lori is like a little shrimp caught
between two giant whales.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Congressman James Talent, a Republican from Missouri,'' Mr.
Berenson supplied.
</P>
<P>
   The Berensons would much rather talk about their daughter than
their own work to free her. That, they say with a shrug, is just
what any parents would do. Indeed, they often seem to be nothing
more than regular parents.
</P>
<P>
   But events have cast them into the unexpected. Mrs. Berenson is
now an expert on prisons, and Mr. Berenson, 58, wants to continue
working for human rights. ``I have the idea that Lori will be
working with me,'' he said. Then, he was back to sounding like a
normal parent: ``Of course, no one wants to work with their father
all of the time.''

MARTINEZ ONE-HITS DEVIL RAYS 
</HEADLINE>
 SOX-DEVIL RAYS-BOS   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BOB HOHLER  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ST. PETERSBURG, Fla. _ In a Red Sox spectacle for the ages,
Pedro Martinez Tuesday &UR;  &LR; night lost a no-hitter to the first batter
in the ninth inning but won an extraordinary showdown marked by a
bench-clearing melee, the ejection of eight Devil Rays, and a Carl
Everett slugging explosion.
</P>
<P>
   The bizarre evening ended with an 8-0 Red Sox victory and two
Boston players in the hospital: third baseman Lou Merloni for
overnight observation after a concussion, and first baseman Brian
Daubach for X-rays on his left elbow.
</P>
<P>
   Both were injured in a brawl that erupted after Martinez hit the
first batter he faced, Gerald Williams, on the left hand, prompting
Williams to charge the mound and whack Martinez.
</P>
<P>
   Only one other Tampa Bay batter reached base. And that was 24
outs later, on the fifth pitch of the ninth inning, a
95-mile-an-hour fastball that former Sox catcher John Flaherty
drove to right-center for a single.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wanted the no-hitter so bad for Pedro that I wished I had a
long, rubber arm that could have reached out and grabbed it,'' said
Everett, who hit two homers, a triple, and a double, driving in six
runs.
</P>
<P>
   But Flaherty's hit dropped for a clean single, and Martinez
gracefully accepted the outcome. He has yet to pitch a no-hitter,
though he pitched nine perfect innings for Montreal in 1995, only
to give up a hit in the 10th.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not disappointed at all,'' said Martinez. ``I have
achieved enough excitement in my career. A no-hitter is not what is
going to dictate what kind of pitcher I am. I think my career is
more interesting than just one game.''
</P>
<P>
   But this was as unforgettable as any. A game that began with a
crowd of 17,450 jeering Martinez for hitting Williams ended with
virtually every patron cheering every pitch as Martinez approached
the first Boston no-hitter since Dave Morehead's in 1965.
</P>
<P>
   The brawl broke out when Martinez plunked Williams on a 1-and-2
count. Williams paused for a moment as if to assess his injury,
then raced toward Martinez as both benches and bullpens cleared.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was really surprised,'' Martinez said. ``I had no intention
whatsoever of hitting him.''
</P>
<P>
   Tell that to the Devil Rays.
</P>
<P>
   ``The guy has 27 walks and 14 hit batsmen,'' said manager Larry
Rothschild. ``I gotta wonder about that.''
</P>
<P>
   Martinez leads the league in hit batsmen _ three ahead of
Detroit's Jeff Weaver and Tampa Bay's Esteban Yan _ and he is
perennially among the major league leaders.
</P>
<P>
   As Martinez stood his ground with his hands down, Williams
shoved him, swung wildly, and hit him in the arm. When Martinez
swung back, Merloni tackled Williams and settled at the bottom of a
pile as more than a dozen players flung themselves into the fray.
Catcher Jason Varitek also landed on top of Williams.
</P>
<P>
   Martinez was down there, too,
</P>
<P>
   ``I escaped all right,'' he said. ``Gerald seemed to be
complaining a lot and crying for people to get them off him. He was
scared down there; I wasn't. He was crying a lot, saying, `Just get
them off me, get them off me.' If you're going to charge the mound,
you better be responsible for the things that happened down
there.''
</P>
<P>
   Merloni stayed in the game until the third inning, when Manny
Alexander hit for him. He suffered worsening headaches as the night
went on, manager Jimy Williams said, and he was taken to nearby
Bayfront Medical Center.
</P>
<P>
   Gerald Williams was ejected for charging the mound, and
Rothschild was tossed while arguing Martinez should also have gone.
</P>
<P>
   Daubach was also among the first to reach the melee. And
something he did in the scrum not only injured his left elbow but
earned him the wrath of the Devil Rays. A group of them pulled him
out and screamed at him, and as Daubach tried to walk away,
clutching his elbow in pain, Tampa Bay's 6-foot-4-inch, 250-pound
closer Roberto Hernandez gave him a hard, two-handed shove in the
back.
</P>
<P>
   As if that were not enough, Tampa Bay then waged a bizarre war
for much of the game against Daubach: Three pitchers were tossed
for hitting him or throwing at him. Two coaches, acting as interim
managers, were ejected along with them.
</P>
<P>
   ``He certainly had an invisible bull's-eye on his back,'' Jimy
Williams said.
</P>
<P>
   Rothschild said the Rays believed Daubach was throwing ``cheap
shots'' in the pile.
</P>
<P>
   Martinez, asked what Daubach might have done to incite Tampa's
wrath, said, ``I think Gerald, by charging the mound, got hit a
little, because he was bleeding. But if I saw something, I'm going
to keep it inside of me. I'm not going to tell you.''
</P>
<P>
   It was a night when the number of Devil Rays ejected (eight)
exceeded the number of balls they hit out of the infield (six).
</P>
<P>
   Other than Flaherty's hit, only one other ball threatened to
drop. Left fielder Troy O'Leary made a leaping catch at the wall to
catch that one, a shot by Steve Cox.
</P>
<P>
   Nomar Garciaparra also prevented a hit in the first inning,
snaring a grounder by Miguel Cairo and making an acrobatic throw to
first to nail him.
</P>
<P>
   Mixing a fastball that reached 97 miles an hour and a jarring
changeup that all but paralyzed every Devil Ray he faced, Martinez
struck out 13.
</P>
<P>
   ``He had the best fastball he's had all year,'' Varitek said.
</P>
<P>
   More important, Jimy Williams said, Martinez maintained his
composure after the brawl and throughout the night, which included
a series of Tampa Bay eruptions, including a Daubach plunking that
cleared both benches in the seventh after the Red Sox began to move
en masse toward the field, led by Alexander. There was more
posturing than fighting, though, before order was restored.
</P>
<P>
   Things got so crazy that even Everett wanted peace.
</P>
<P>
   ``Normally, I'm the one who's hyped up,'' Everett said. ``But I
wanted to tell everybody to calm down.''
</P>
<P>
   Martinez, who was suspended for five games in May for hitting
Cleveland's Roberto Alomar, said he considered retaliating as the
Rays continually attacked Daubach. And he was advised against it by
Everett, who was suspended for 10 games for bumping umpire Ron
Kulpa. ``Don't even do it,'' Everett told him.
</P>
<P>
   And Martinez concurred, earning his manager's great admiration.
</P>
<P>
   ``I cannot afford to retaliate and be thrown out and act
stupid,'' said Martinez. ``I need to help this team.''
</P>
<P>
   Just as Everett helped the team Tuesday &UR;  &LR; night. Martinez had
told him before the game, ``Just give me three (runs).''
</P>
<P>
   After knocking in his first three, Everett said he told him,
``There's your three.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Then he went to work,'' Everett said.
</P>
<P>
   Did he ever.

MARTINEZ'S STYLE GETS DEVIL RAYS HOT 
</HEADLINE>
 RAYS-BOS   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BOB HOHLER  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ST. PETERSBURG, Fla. _ They call him Ice.
</P>
<P>
   But Gerald Williams was afire Tuesday &UR;  &LR; night after Pedro
Martinez hit him in the left wrist with his fourth pitch of the
game, which would turn into a dazzling one-hitter.
</P>
<P>
   Seems Williams and his Devil Ray mates had some issues with
Martinez. ``It started when Jose Guillen got hit there (by Martinez
in Boston Aug. 14),'' said Tampa Bay manager Larry Rothschild.
``Pedro made an issue of it being his arm and all that. We didn't
do anything that night, and right away tonight with two strikes it
starts up.''
</P>
<P>
   Boy, did it start up. Williams, apparently acting on behalf of
the team, carried his fury to the mound, flailed at Martinez, and
wound up at the bottom of a massive pile.
</P>
<P>
   Was Martinez throwing at Williams? ``Obviously, we felt that he
was,'' said Rothschild, who was ejected along with Williams. ``The
guy has 27 walks and 14 hit batsmen. I gotta wonder about it.''
</P>
<P>
   Williams, who had to be restrained repeatedly from taking
another run at Martinez after order was restored, had little to say
afterward. ``I think it should speak for itself,'' he said of
Pedro's pitching style. ``I just want to remain a professional.
Sometimes it becomes increasingly difficult, given a guy's
background.''
</P>
<P>
   Williams added, ``I had a better chance preserving my health
fighting than I did taking the ball 95 miles an hour on a small
bone in my hand.''
</P>
<P>
   The Rays, like many of Martinez's foes, believe he gets away
with more than he deserves.
</P>
<P>
   ``It seems there are some guys who can do whatever they want to
do and it's all right,'' said Greg Vaughn, who was ejected for
arguing a called third strike. ``And that's not right.''
</P>
<P>
   The scene only got uglier as the night went on.
</P>
<P>
   In the third inning, Rays starter Dave Eiland also was ejected,
after he hit consecutive batters, Brian Daubach and Nomar
Garciaparra. Acting manager Bill Russell also was tossed.
</P>
<P>
   Then Eiland's replacement, Cory Lidle, was thrown out of the
game for sailing a pitch behind Daubach in the seventh. And out
went another acting manager, Jose Cardenal.
</P>
<P>
   Moments later, Lidle's relief, Tony Fiore, brushed back Daubach
with one pitch and hit him with the next. That earned Fiore an
ejection.
</P>
<P>
   Rothschild said the Rays targeted Daubach because they believed
he ``was throwing cheap shots in the pile.''
</P>
<P>
   Said the manager, ``You've got to protect your players. The only
problem is that our pitchers kept missing the guy.''
</P>
<P>
   That's news to Daubach, who got hit twice and was forced to
dance away from several other pitches before Sox manager Jimy
Williams spared him any further anguish by replacing him in the
seventh with Rico Brogna.
</P>
<P>
   Asked if Daubach threw cheap shots, Eiland said, ``Damn right he
did.''
</P>
<P>
   Amid all the mayhem, there was a baseball game, a fact that
appeared lost on many players in Tampa Bay uniforms.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was such a crazy game,'' Guillen said, ``that people forgot
it was a no-hitter.''
</P>
<P>
   Others wished they had been somewhere else.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not proud to stand here and say I was part of that game,''
said former Sox catcher John Flaherty, whose leadoff single in the
ninth broke up the no-hitter.
</P>
<P>
   But Martinez said it had a positive effect on the Sox.
</P>
<P>
   ``It brought out the best in us,'' he said. ``Maybe we needed
something to wake us up and get reunited again and play as hard as
we could. Today was a good sign they better not wake us up.''

A MAD, MAD WHIRL FOR RED SOX 
</HEADLINE>
 SOX-ANALYSIS-BOS   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By GORDON EDES  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The most famous, and bizarre, no-hitter in Red Sox history began
this way:
</P>
<P>
   A 21-year-old lefthanded pitcher with a nasty fastball and an
unbridled temper named Babe Ruth walked the first batter, Ray
Morgan of the Washington Senators.
</P>
<P>
   When umpire Clarence ``Brick'' Owens called ball four, Ruth
charged the plate, and the following exchange is reported to have
ensued.
</P>
<P>
   ``Get back to the mound or you're out of the ballgame,'' Owens
yelled at Ruth.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you chase me, I'll punch your face,'' Ruth replied.
</P>
<P>
   ``You're out now,'' said Owens, whereupon Ruth delivered on his
end of the bargain, throwing a left at Owens's head.
</P>
<P>
   After Ruth's ejection (he later was fined 100 bucks and
suspended 10 days), his onetime roommate, Ernie Shore, replaced
him. Morgan was caught stealing, and Shore retired all 26 batters
he faced for a perfect game.
</P>
<P>
   That was 83 years ago. Tuesday &UR;  &LR; night in St. Petersburg, Fla.,
the Florida retirement haven with inhabitants old enough to
remember Shore's masterpiece, Pedro Martinez came within three outs
of trumping it in both brilliance and weirdness.
</P>
<P>
   Four pitches into the game, Martinez hit leadoff batter Gerald
Williams in the left hand. Williams was guilty of nothing other
than being the first man of the night in a Tampa Bay uniform to
face Pedro, who had lost three straight decisions to the Devil Rays
and had been roughed up by them in his last outing.
</P>
<P>
   By now, we are all aware (aren't we, Einar Diaz and Matt
Lawton?) that when Martinez takes offense for any slight _ real or
imagined _ someone pays the price. In this case, it was Williams,
who didn't appreciate the terms of the transaction and charged the
mound, knocking Pedro down and undoubtedly causing John
Harrington's forehead to leak perspiration as he watched his $75
million investment manhandled.
</P>
<P>
   The benches cleared, and the tone for a night of madness had
been set. And given that the game was being played in a domed
ballpark, Sox manager Jimy Williams couldn't blame either of his
usual suspects: a full moon or, as he said Sunday in Kansas City, a
full sun.
</P>
<P>
   In the center of the vortex stood Martinez, who inning after
inning seemed unaffected by the chaos swirling about. Twenty-four
up, 24 down, not so much as a sniff at a base hit until catcher
John Flaherty, the onetime Red Sox benchwarmer, lined an outside
fastball to right-center field for a single to open the bottom of
the ninth inning.
</P>
<P>
   Martinez would finish with his third career one-hitter. Once
again, a Red Sox pitcher would fall short of the feat last
accomplished Sept. 16, 1965, by Dave Morehead, who in a near-empty
Fenway Park no-hit the Cleveland Indians, 2-0.
</P>
<P>
   ``The next day, Tom Yawkey called me up and gave me a $1,000
check,'' Morehead was quoted as saying in Peter Golenbock's oral
history of the Sox, ``Fenway.'' ``He even paid the taxes on it.''
</P>
<P>
   Morehead threw his no-no days after his 22d birthday. The
following April, on a wet and cold Patriots Day, he hurt his elbow
and was never the same.
</P>
<P>
   But no pitcher, it is safe to conclude, ever has flirted with
perfection under stranger circumstances _ hit batsmen,
bench-clearing brawls, and ejections _ unless it is Martinez
himself.
</P>
<P>
   On April 13, 1994, when he was just 22 and pitching for the
Montreal Expos, Martinez took a perfect game into the eighth inning
against Cincinnati before hitting Reggie Sanders with an 0-and-2
fastball. Sanders, apparently oblivious to the reasoning that only
a fool would throw at a batter with a perfecto in progress, took
exception and charged the mound.
</P>
<P>
   Martinez lost his no-hitter, and the lead, in the next inning.
</P>
<P>
   A year later, on June 3, 1995, in San Diego, Martinez was
perfect for nine innings, then gave up a leadoff double to Bip
Roberts to open the 10th and was taken out of the game. The Expos
held on to win, 1-0, and Martinez should have gone into the record
books with a perfect game.
</P>
<P>
   But no. Four years earlier, a committee charged with holding up
the statistical purity of the game had ruled that a pitcher
couldn't be called perfect, or be given credit for a no-hitter,
unless he pitched a complete game. Nine innings of perfection
wasn't enough, so Martinez joined Harvey Haddix of the Pirates (12
perfect innings in 1959) in a netherworld as strange as the one
occupied by Roger Maris when commissioner Ford Frick wouldn't
recognize him in the record book as the sole holder of the home run
record, previously set by that man again, Babe Ruth.
</P>
<P>
   By the way, here's what Shore gave manager Wild Bill Carrigan as
the reason he had to stop rooming with the Babe, according to
Golenbock.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't live with that man Ruth,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Why? I thought you and Ruth were friends,'' Carrigan said.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's right, we are,'' Shore said. ``But there's a place
where friendship stops. I told him he was using my toothbrush and
he said, `That's all right, I'm not particular.'
</P>
<P>
   ``But that isn't all, Mr. Carrigan. A man wants some privacy in
the bathroom.''

MARINERS BEAT YANKEES, 5-3 
</HEADLINE>
   By BUSTER OLNEY   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ Like Boston's Pedro Martinez, Andy Pettitte flirted
with a no-hitter Tuesday night. But unlike Martinez, Pettitte did
not engage in any brawls, there were no ejections _ and after
Pettitte's no-hitter was broken up in the sixth, he suffered the
loss when the Seattle Mariners came back for five runs in the
eighth inning.
</P>
<P>
   Edgar Martinez hammered a grand slam off reliever Jeff Nelson
with two outs in the eighth, giving Seattle a shocking 5-3 lead
over the Yankees. The Mariners had lost 13 of their last 15 games,
and the Yankees had won three in a row. Pettitte (16-7) had won
seven straight games.
</P>
<P>
   The 5-3 loss marked the third time in their last 11 games that
the Yankees blew a three-run lead and lost.
</P>
<P>
   Carlos Guillen broke up Pettitte's no-hitter with a bloop single
with two outs in the sixth, but Pettitte was in command, leading by
3-0. He retired the first batter in the eighth, but allowed three
consecutive singles to load the bases. Stan Javier then hit a
sinking line drive in the direction of Luis Polonia, the left
fielder broke late and just missed a sliding catch; one run scored.
</P>
<P>
   Yankees manager Joe Torre summoned Nelson to relieve Pettitte,
and Nelson struck out shortstop Alex Rodriguez for the second out.
Nelson fell behind Martinez, two balls and no strikes, fired a
fastball and Martinez drove it to the opposite field, about three
rows into the right-field stands, thrilling the Safeco Field fans.
It was the second home run surrendered by Nelson this season.
</P>
<P>
   Pedro Martinez was three outs from completing a no-hitter
against Tampa Bay when the Yankees began their game here Tuesday
night. It may be that as Pettitte changed T-shirts in the clubhouse
or got a cup of water or had a last look at the Seattle scouting
reports, he might have seen the last few outs of that game, the hit
by Devil Rays catcher John Flaherty that broke up Martinez's
no-hitter.
</P>
<P>
   Pettitte might have had no-hitter on the brain when he took the
mound, but there was no way he would expect to throw one himself,
for he is not well suited to do so. Unlike Martinez or Randy
Johnson, Pettitte does not overpower hitters and compiles few
strikeouts. To the contrary, Pettitte is reliant on his sinkerball,
his objective to get batters to beat this pitch into the dirt and
get lots of ground-ball outs. Going into Tuesday night's game,
Pettitte had allowed more than a hit an inning, 172 hits in 161
innings, with just 96 strikeouts.
</P>
<P>
   But Pettitte was particularly sharp Tuesday night, throwing
harder than usual; on an average day, his fastball will be clocked
at 88 mph to 89 mph, and Tuesday night, the radar gun readings were
91 mph to 92 mph. All three types of his fastball were moving well:
the sinker down and away, the cutter darting inside, the fastball
boring down on batters.
</P>
<P>
   The Mariners could not merely wait for a fastball, either, for
Pettitte mixed in a curveball at about 73 mph to 75 mph and a
changeup of 82 mph to 83 mph, the change of speeds confounding.
Pettitte retired the first nine hitters he faced on four ground
balls, two strikeouts and three fly balls _ and he seemed appeared
annoyed, nonetheless, griping to catcher Chris Turner as he walked
off the mound at the end of third.
</P>
<P>
   Pettitte walked Rickey Henderson on four pitches leading off the
fourth, but Javier grounded to short to start a double play, and
Scott Brosius gloved Rodriguez's hot smash to close the inning.
Pettitte retired the Mariners in order in the fifth, the last out
coming when Chris Widger flailed at a breaking ball. Pettitte had a
3-0 lead, he had great stuff and he was facing a team in the midst
of a deep, depressing, debilitating slump; the possibility of a
no-hitter appeared real.
</P>
<P>
   Joe Oliver popped a foul ball near the stands, and Jorge Posada
_ playing first base _ reached over the hands of some fans to make
a leaning catch. Eleven outs to go. David Bell popped to second; 10
outs.
</P>
<P>
   But Pettitte's preponderance for creating contact finally
manifested itself, in the form of a fluke hit. The
right-handed-hitting Guillen swung hard and looped a pop fly into
short right field, far out of the reach of the three fielders who
pursued it, and the Seattle fans _ suffering through the team's
drought _ stood and cheered, their enthusiasm tinged with sarcasm.
Pettitte's expression never changed; it was impossible to tell,
from his body language, whether he realized he was throwing a
no-hitter, if he was vested in the idea of creating history.
</P>
<P>
   No, he just got the ball back and concentrated on facing the
next hitter. Henderson slapped a double into the right-field
corner, but with Javier representing the potential tying run at the
plate, Pettitte rebounded, enticing Javier to chase a cut fastball
in the dirt.
</P>
<P>
   The Yankees scored all their runs early, rewarded for their
patience against the Seattle left-hander Jamie Moyer. Bernie
Williams singled with two outs in the first, and designated hitter
Jose Canseco waited through a walk.
</P>
<P>
   Before the game, Roger Clemens remarked how difficult it is for
opposing pitchers to get through this part of the Yankees' lineup
now, knowing that a mistake could kill them. It wears on a pitcher,
Clemens explained, and eventually, the increased tension causes a
mistake.
</P>
<P>
   Canseco has 444 career home runs, David Justice has 34 homers,
Glenallen Hill is averaging a home run for every seven at-bats
since he joined the Yankees, and Posada is on a pace to hit 30
homers. With their revamped lineup, the Yankees have 45 homers this
month, most in the league.
</P>
<P>
   So Moyer got himself into trouble with the Canseco walk, and
suffered the consequences. Justice ripped a single to drive home
Williams, and after Hill got ahead in the count, three balls and
one strike, before lining a single to left. Yankees 2, Seattle 0.
</P>
<P>
   The Yankees added a run in the second, collecting three more
walks; Moyer would allow seven in all, a career high, and last six
innings.
</P>
<P>
   Over the last 46 games, the Yankees have knocked out opposing
starters 12 times before the end of the fifth inning; only 13
pitchers have survived the seventh.
</P>
<P>
   Brett Tomko (7-4) gave up two hits in two innings to earn the
triumph after replacing Moyer.

ANGELS BAIL OUT KARL, BEAT BLUE JAYS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By GORDON VERRELL  
 c.2000 Long Beach Press-Telegram  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ANAHEIM, Calif. _ The best thing about Scott Karl's performance
Tuesday night in his first start for the Angels: He kept the ball
in the ballpark.
</P>
<P>
   That may not be saying a lot, but it was critical, as it turned
out.
</P>
<P>
   He didn't dig that big of a hole, and the Angels, once they got
their big bats cranking, were able to overcome Karl's shortcomings
for their 32nd come-from-behind win, 9-4 over the Toronto Blue Jays
in front of 17,773 fans at Edison Field.
</P>
<P>
   Troy Glaus slugged a three-run home run in the fourth inning to
get the Angels close. It was his 38th homer, leaving him just one
shy of Reggie Jackson's franchise-record 39 set in 1982. And Mo
Vaughn walloped his 32nd in the fifth inning to tie the score 4-4.
</P>
<P>
   The Angels then batted around in the sixth, scoring four times _
on a run-scoring double by Adam Kennedy to break the tie, a
run-scoring single by Bengie Molina and a two-run single by Darin
Erstad, who reached the 200-hit plateau with three singles.
</P>
<P>
   It was a notable milestone.
</P>
<P>
   Erstad got his 200th hit in the Angels' 132nd game. The last
time anyone got there faster was in 1935, when Joe Medwick of the
St. Louis Cardinals got to 200 in 131 games. Erstad got there
faster than any AL player in 75 years, since the Philadelphia A's
Al Simmons got his 200th hit in his 125th game. Erstad is now just
two hits shy of Alex Johnson's club-record 202 in 1970.
</P>
<P>
   ``The guy is incredible,'' said Angels manager Mike Scioscia,
who once more mounted the soapbox in support of Erstad as the AL
Most Valuable Player.
</P>
<P>
   ``What he brings to this club ... he plays every game one way,
the right way, whether it's a spring training game or the seventh
game of the World Series.''
</P>
<P>
   The World Series, of course, is something the Angels only talk
about _ they haven't been there _ but it was with that in mind that
they sought to add to their pitching with the acquisition of Karl,
a 28-year-old left-hander who had struggled mightily at Colorado
(1-3, 7.40 ERA).
</P>
<P>
   ``It was everything ... nervousness, rustiness, excited ... they
hit good pitches, they hit bad pitches,'' Karl said, assessing his
2 2/3 innings in which he was clubbed for four runs on nine hits.
</P>
<P>
   Once Karl departed, the bullpen took charge. Lou Pote bailed
Karl out of a jam in the third, Mike Holtz got Pote out of a mess
in the sixth, then Al Levine, Shigetoshi Hasegawa and Troy Percival
combined to retire the final nine Blue Jays in order.
</P>
<P>
   In all, the five Angels relievers shut out Toronto on two hits
over the final 6 1/3 innings.
</P>
<P>
   The win kept the Angels four games behind first-place Seattle in
the American League West and three games back of Cleveland in the
AL wild-card race.
</P>
<P>
   Toronto's Carlos Delgado had two of the nine hits off Karl,
including his club-record 88th extra-base hit. And Dave Martinez
had two singles to stretch his career-best hitting streak to 19
games.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've got a potent offense, but the key to this game was
Pote,'' Scioscia said, noting his reliever's 3 1/3 scoreless
innings. ``Their guy (starter Chris Carpenter) shut us down the
first time through the lineup, but the second time around we got
some balls to hit.''
</P>
<P>
   The Angels hit 'em, too, led by Erstad's three singles, hits
No.198-200.
</P>
<P>
   Someone wondered the fastest Scioscia ever got to 200 hits,
knowing, of course, the former catcher topped out one year with the
Dodgers at 127.
</P>
<P>
   Scioscia didn't have to think too long.
</P>
<P>
   ``Four years,'' he said. &QL;

MARTINEZ JARS YANKEES WITH LATE GRAND SLAM 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By JOHN HICKEY   
 c.2000 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ Any one of the Mariners would have walked through fire
to get a hit like this one.
</P>
<P>
   Getting a little singed is nothing compared to the hellish last
two weeks Mariners had just been through.
</P>
<P>
   Edgar Martinez brought fire back into the Mariners offense
Tuesday night with an eighth-inning grand slam that produced a 5-3
victory over New York. The comeback easily stands as the Mariners'
biggest win of the year.
</P>
<P>
   ``We needed this one more than we needed oxygen,'' shortstop
Alex Rodriguez said of Martinez's fourth grand slam of 2000. ``It
was the biggest hit of our season.''
</P>
<P>
   The Mariners were five outs away from losing, down 3-0 to
Yankees lefty Andy Pettitte, who was so on top of his game that it
took Seattle all of six innings just to get a hit. With a trail of
tears that included 13 losses in their previous 15 games, the
Mariners' night looked like simply more of the same.
</P>
<P>
   Pettitte carried a three-hitter into the eighth. The way recent
history had played out, the Mariners could have mailed this one in.
Instead, the results of a late night of talking baseball kicked in.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the Mariners remained in the clubhouse long after
Monday's 9-1 loss to the Yankees. They talked over the ins and outs
of the bad spell. They talked about having fun, about putting all
those yesterdays behind them. They talked about playing baseball
more and about worrying about the pennant race less.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe at the time it sounded dumb and hit jaded ears like just
another sound bite. But one out into the eighth inning, the words
rang true.
</P>
<P>
   David Bell singled to right. Carlos Guillen singled to right.
The crowd started to get into it.
</P>
<P>
   And then a freaky thing happened. The Mariners caught a break.
Jorge Posada was still playing first base for the Yankees. He's a
catcher by trade, and just fills in at first. He didnt have the
experience to cope with Rickey Hendersons tortured fly ball behind
first base. Posada never came close to catching the ball. Henderson
had a hit and the Mariners had the bases loaded.
</P>
<P>
   And then another freaky thing happened. The Mariners caught
another break. Luis Polonia tried to make a sliding catch of Stan
Javiers sinking line drive in left. Polonia had a bead on the ball,
but he missed it. Javier got a single and the Mariners got a run.
</P>
<P>
   For two weeks, the breaks had gone against Seattle. All of a
sudden, the clouds had parted. With Jeff Nelson coming in out of
the New York bullpen, Pettitte was out of the game and light was
beginning to shine. The light dimmed some when Rodriguez struck
out, but up stepped Martinez, a man made for hitting with the game
on the line.
</P>
<P>
   Martinez came into the at-bat with just one hit in his previous
18 at-bats, but he's such a good hitter pitchers have to fear him
more in a slump than they do most hitters on their best day.
</P>
<P>
   Nelson missed with one pitch. Then another. Nelson didnt miss
with his third pitch, catching the strike zone. It also caught
Martinezs bat. Right fielder Clay Bellinger gave ground, then gave
more ground, trying to will the ball into his glove. What he found
was that there was more room on Martinez's fly ball than there was
in the ballpark. Bellinger had his body pressed vainly up against
the right field wall while Martinezs home run settled into the
seats.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'd talked about how much we'd been overswinging,'' said
Martinez, who'd been one of the culprits. ``This time, I didn't
overswing. I didn't try to hit a home run. I just tried to hit the
ball hard.''
</P>
<P>
   It just so happened he hit it high, too. High enough for a grand
slam. High enough to finally let the dogs out.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was crazy,'' Mike Cameron, the next hitter, said of the
emotion let loose in the Mariners' dugout.
</P>
<P>
   How crazy?
</P>
<P>
   ``So crazy I didn't even see the first two pitches that (Nelson)
threw me,'' Cameron said.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's the one we've been looking for,'' said reliever Arthur
Rhodes, who was warming up in the bullpen at the time of the home
run. ``No one had his head down. We were behind, but we felt
positive.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you're down three runs in the eighth and come back with a
big inning like that, it's huge.''
</P>
<P>
   Manager Lou Piniella said the win ``has to be our biggest one of
the year.''
</P>
<P>
   The most immediate residual of the victory was an increase in
Seattle's AL West lead to 2{ games over Oakland.
</P>
<P>
   ``This was a special win for us,'' Piniella said. ``This is the
type of win that can maybe turn things around for us. We got
pitching, defense and timely hitting. This was the type of game we
have been waiting for.''
</P>
<P>
   Lost in the glow of Martinezs accomplishment was that of
starting pitcher Jamie Moyer. The lefty gave up three runs in the
first two innings and was on the verge of being blown out in the
fourth inning when he intentionally walked Bernie Williams to load
the bases with one out and Jose Canseco at the plate.
</P>
<P>
   Moyer fell behind 2-0 and 3-1, then came back to strike out
Canseco. David Justice then lined out, and for the first time in
just short of forever, the Mariners avoided a big inning. That kept
the Mariners within striking range. Ultimately, they would strike.
</P>
<P>
   ``For me, that was the turning point of the game,'' Javier said.
``It was a tough situation, and Moyer pitched out of it. Getting
Canseco was huge.''
</P>
<P>
   He wasn't the last Mariners pitcher to get Canseco with the game
on the line. Once the Mariners took the lead, Kazuhiro Sasaki had
to pitch through the middle of the Yankees lineup to finally put
New York away.
</P>
<P>
   Bernie Williams lined out hard to first base, where John Olerud,
just brought into the game as a defensive change, made a nice
catch. Canseco struck out. Polonia popped out.
</P>
<P>
   End of game. End of slump?
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the kind of win that can turn things around for us,''
Rodriguez said. ``We've got to build on this one.''

FOR PRISONER'S PARENTS, A POLITICAL EDUCATION 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Repeats for all needing.)   By SHAILA K. DEWAN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Wheeling a suitcase behind them, Rhoda and Mark L.
Berenson looked like any retired couple off for a vacation as they
waited in an American Airlines ticket line at La Guardia Airport
Tuesday afternoon. But the man in front of them in line knew
otherwise.
</P>
<P>
   ``Are they going to release your daughter?'' he asked.
</P>
<P>
   Although she had appeared on every news report the night before,
Mrs. Berenson was startled. ``We're so known,'' she murmured.
</P>
<P>
   But then she realized that the man was not exactly a stranger.
He was Brad Blakeman, a lawyer who works for the George W. Bush
campaign and is one of the many critical contacts she and her
husband have made over their four years of writing letters,
visiting lawmakers and talking to anyone who would listen about the
plight of their daughter, Lori Helene Berenson, 30.
</P>
<P>
   In January 1996, Ms. Berenson, 30, was convicted by a masked
military tribunal of conspiring to attack the Peruvian Congress,
and she has been imprisoned high in the Peruvian mountains on a
life sentence ever since.
</P>
<P>
   Mr. Berenson, a lifelong Democrat, started in on Blakeman,
rattling off the names of Republicans who support his efforts to
free his daughter. After the encounter, Mr. Berenson said, ``We
desperately need a way to get to George W.''
</P>
<P>
   It had been just over 24 hours since the U.S. Embassy had called
to tell the Berensons that their daughter was to be given a new
civil trial. Since then, Mr. Berenson said, they had answered 100
e-mail messages, held a news conference outside their apartment
near Gramercy Park, planned another news conference with Jesse
Jackson, and packed their bags for Tuesday's flight to Chicago to
appear on Oprah Winfrey's television show. The show's segment,
``The Fight of Your Life,'' had been scheduled before the big news.
</P>
<P>
   Since their daughter's arrest, the Berensons have gone from
professors to crusaders. They retired from their jobs _ he taught
statistics and she taught physics, both at the college level _ to
devote themselves, and a considerable amount of cash, to the
Committee to Free Lori Berenson. And they have steadfastly
maintained her innocence, despite skepticism from U.S. officials
and some human rights advocates.
</P>
<P>
   They have learned to talk Peruvian politics, and they have
learned that letters to their daughter, which have to be in Spanish
so the censors can read them, should say ``translated by a
computer'' at the top in case there is some incendiary mistake.
They have learned where to buy knitting yarn in Arequipa, where
they stay when they go to Peru to visit their daughter, taking
turns every few weeks.
</P>
<P>
   Their experience has taught them, too, that the announcement of
a new trial may not be the breakthrough many have taken it to be.
The Berensons have welcomed the news, but cautiously.
</P>
<P>
   They have already had their hopes raised and dashed countless
times, said Mrs. Berenson, 57. There was the time in June 1998 when
Peru's new prime minister said Ms. Berenson should be pardoned and
sent home, only to be immediately contradicted by the country's
real power, President Alberto K. Fujimori.
</P>
<P>
   Then there was December 1998, when the Tupac Amaru Revolutionary
Movement, a guerrilla group, took over the residence of Japan's
ambassador to Peru. The incident seemed so similar to the one Ms.
Berenson had been accused of devising with the same group that it
jeopardized attempts to secure her a new trial. More recently,
prison guards said Ms. Berenson was drawing an escape plan, but it
was actually just a knitting diagram for a cat pattern that her
mother admired.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's very difficult to be an individual human being depending
on a large government for your life, because they're just not
geared to focus on individuals,'' Mrs. Berenson said. ``It's like
what that one congressman said: Lori is like a little shrimp caught
between two giant whales.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Congressman James Talent, a Republican from Missouri,'' Mr.
Berenson supplied.
</P>
<P>
   The Berensons would much rather talk about their daughter than
their own work to free her. That, they say with a shrug, is just
what any parents would do. Indeed, they often seem to be nothing
more than regular parents.
</P>
<P>
   But events have cast them into the unexpected. Mrs. Berenson is
now an expert on prisons, and Mr. Berenson, 58, wants to continue
working for human rights. ``I have the idea that Lori will be
working with me,'' he said. Then, he was back to sounding like a
normal parent: ``Of course, no one wants to work with their father
all of the time.''

RANGERS, JAYS CONSIDER OPENING 2001 SEASON IN PUERTO RICO
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By T.R. SULLIVAN 
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ARLINGTON, Texas _ The Texas Rangers could open the regular
season next year in San Juan, Puerto Rico, against the Toronto Blue
Jays.
</P>
<P>
   The Rangers and the Blue Jays are close to finalizing an
agreement to play their season opener on April 1 in San Juan. The
game would be televised by ESPN.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a possibility,'' Rangers vice president John Blake said.
``It's under discussion but nothing has been decided. Major League
Baseball has made us a proposal, and we're going through that
proposal.''
</P>
<P>
   Major League Baseball would be opening the season outside the
continental United States for the third consecutive year. The first
game of 1999 was played in Mexico, and this year it was held in
Japan. TEAM MEETING
</P>
<P>
   Rangers manager Johnny Oates held a team meeting Tuesday, trying
to keep his team focused for the final month of the season.
</P>
<P>
   ``We discussed a few things,'' Oates said. ``Mainly, just to
stick with it. The effort has been there, but maybe the focus or
the concentration might wander. I have no problem with the effort
or the concentration. When have you seen a guy not run out a ground
ball? They've played hard to a man.''
</P>
<P>
   First baseman Rafael Palmeiro said: ``I think sometimes you lose
focus when you go through a bad time. We need to refocus, and this
was to give us a jump-start.'' LAMB FRUSTRATED
</P>
<P>
   Third baseman Mike Lamb was at The Ballpark in Arlington early
Tuesday, working on defense with infield coach Bucky Dent. But he's
out of the lineup both Tuesday night and Wednesday night as manager
Johnny Oates wants to give him a couple days off to clear his head.
</P>
<P>
   Lamb committed his league-leading 26th error Monday.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a new experience for me,'' Lamb said. ``For me, it's been
hard, but that which won't kill me will only make me better. But
it's tough. I have high expectations, and it's difficult when you
don't meet those expectations.''
</P>
<P>
   Oates said he expects Lamb to return the lineup Thursday night.
HICKS WON'T SHY FROM TOP PICK
</P>
<P>
   The the Rangers could have the top pick in next year's June
amateur draft, which could be an expensive proposition. In fact,
some teams with the top pick often shy away from taking the best
player because they're not sure they can afford them.
</P>
<P>
   Owner Tom Hicks said that won't happen with the Rangers if
they're in that situation.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're going to draft based on the who's the best player, not
on signability,'' Hicks said. ``To me that's money well-spent.''
ROSTER MOVE
</P>
<P>
   The Rangers optioned reliever Darwin Cubillan to Class-A Pulaski
on Tuesday to make room for pitcher Ryan Glynn, who was activated
off the disabled list. Cubillan was optioned to Pulaski because the
Appalachian League season ends Saturday and he can be added to the
big-league roster immediately afterward. He will remain with the
Rangers but can't be in uniform for games. CRABTREE SUPPORTS

   Tim Crabtree, the Rangers' player representative, said his

   ``I think the game right now is in good shape,'' Crabtree said.
``We've got some teams that aren't spending a lot of money in the
middle of the pennant race. There are a lot of good things going on
if somehow in the next contract we can figure out how to increase
revenue sharing.'' MINOR-LEAGUE FLASHES

BASIC AGREEMENT EXTENDED, BUT STRIKE HASN'T BEEN AVERTED

   ARLINGTON, Texas _ There was a great deal of irony Tuesday night
during Tom Schieffer's much deserved tribute for his tenure as
president of the Texas Rangers.
</P>
<P>
   Schieffer was lauded for his role in building The Ballpark in
Arlington, the club's palatial home. He was presented with a
Rangers jersey with the number 94, emblematic of the year the
stadium opened.
</P>
<P>
   The irony is the number also is a reminder of the low point of
Schieffer's time at the helm: the players' strike that wiped out
the '94 World Series.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no question in my mind that the most difficult period
to be involved with the franchise was during the strike,''
Schieffer said. ``That was just awful, and it took all the fun out
of it for everybody. Hopefully, because it was so bad last time, it
scared the beejeebies out of everybody, and they won't bring us
close to that again.''
</P>
<P>
   All anyone can do at this point is hope.
</P>
<P>
   The union announced Monday that it is picking up its option on
the Basic Agreement for 2001. But the action is merely the
continuation of the cease fire in the labor wars, not the end of
hostilities. The issues that led to the most damaging strike in
baseball history still exist.
</P>
<P>
   The owners wanted a device that would slow down salaries. They
sought a salary cap but settled for a luxury tax.
</P>
<P>
   It didn't work. From 1996, the first year of the current
agreement, until Opening Day this year, the average salary rose
from $1,119,981 to $1,988,034.
</P>
<P>
   The salary cap would trigger more revenue sharing, leveling the
playing field between the large- and small-market clubs.
</P>
<P>
   It didn't happen. The gap between the clubs with the largest and
the smallest payrolls is larger than ever. Teams that spend a lot
of money dominate in the postseason.
</P>
<P>
   Schieffer knows the issues. He once was a member of commissioner
Bud Selig's blue-ribbon panel charged with finding ways to solve
the economic-disparity issue.
</P>
<P>
   The panel recommended that teams share 40 to 50 percent of all
local revenues, that a 50 percent competitive-balance tax be
assessed on payrolls that top $84 million and that money be
available for low-revenue clubs to meet a minimum payroll of $40
million.
</P>
<P>
   ``What happened with the blue-ribbon committee was you had some
very thoughtful people get together and examine the game in a
somewhat dispassionate way and make some recommendations that I
think people ought to look at very hard,'' Schieffer said.
</P>
<P>
   They ought to, but will they?
</P>
<P>
   It's assumed the committee's recommendations will form the basis
of the owners' negotiating strategy, but first Selig has to sell it
to the owners. It won't be easy to get the large-market clubs to
sign off on a plan that would cost them that much revenue.
</P>
<P>
   ``Teams that produce more revenue and cash flow are more
valuable than teams that don't,'' Schieffer said. ``When you go
into revenue sharing that reduces their income and their cash flow,
that reduces the value of their franchise. How do you compensate
the larger franchises for a reduction in their overall value? You
have to figure out how to solve that problem.''
</P>
<P>
   If the owners figure it out, they still have to sell it to a
union that not only remains opposed to anything that might slow the
growth of salaries, but will have its own issues.
</P>
<P>
   ``You're always trying to make it as good as possible to be a
big-league player, whether it's pension or minimum salaries going
up,'' said Rangers pitcher Rick Helling, a member of the union's
executive board. ``I'm sure there'll be things we want to discuss.
It's give and take on both sides.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, Helling is cautiously optimistic because, so far, there
has been little of the bitter rhetoric that led up to the '94
strike.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think I've heard one player or one owner say we're
headed for a work stoppage,'' he said. ``It's always been media, or
in a couple of cases maybe an agent saying this doesn't look good.
As far as I understand, I've never seen a player or an owner say
that, and that's a good sign.''
</P>
<P>
   Schieffer is cautiously optimistic because few dispute the
financial problems facing the game.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a much broader consensus now that you have to look at
this as an industry problem and not just an individual club
problem,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   But there remains much work to be done if the number 02 isn't
going to be as foreboding in a few years as 94 is now. nn

AT TEXAS, CHOOSING BETWEEN SIMMS AND APPLEWHITE ISN'T A SNAP
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JIMMY BURCH 
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ In the ongoing and oft-analyzed competition to
land the starting-quarterback job at Texas, this much is a given:
Chris Simms is No. 1 on the Longhorns' roster.
</P>
<P>
   That became a fact during the off-season, when coaches granted
Simms' request to switch numerals on his game jersey; he wore No. 8
last season. Whether the new digit coincides with the sophomore's
status on the Texas depth chart at the conclusion of fall drills
remains to be determined.
</P>
<P>
   Simms is locked in a battle for playing time with Major
Applewhite, the 1999 Big 12 Offensive Player of the Year, who
underwent reconstructive knee surgery in January. Texas coaches
have pointed to a series of fall scrimmages as the primary platform
for quarterbacks to stake their claim to the starting job for the
Longhorns' Sept. 9 opener against Louisiana-Lafayette.
</P>
<P>
   Heading into Wednesday's final preseason scrimmage at
Royal-Memorial Stadium, neither quarterback has made significant
headway. Simms, in the first two scrimmages, has completed 12 of 26
passes for 206 yards and three touchdowns. He has thrown one
interception. Applewhite is 13-of-30 for 216 yards and one
touchdown. He has thrown one interception.
</P>
<P>
   Their near-identical statistics do not surprise Texas offensive
coordinator Greg Davis, who stressed that both quarterbacks will
play, at least during the early stages of the season.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't expect much separation,'' Davis said. ``They're both
extremely talented and very accurate passers. One of them is not
likely to come out here and go 0-for-14 to help make things real
clear-cut.''
</P>
<P>
   Thus far, the most clear-cut message has come from coach Mack
Brown. Although Applewhite has not experienced swelling in his knee
during fall drills, Brown said he will have reservations about
Applewhite's health until he plays in a game with full contact.
</P>
<P>
   ``Major's not competing for a job or with Chris,'' Brown said.
``He's competing with his knee. The important thing for him is just
being healthy.''
</P>
<P>
   Because the Longhorns' quarterbacks will not be exposed to
contact until the season opener, Applewhite can't convince coaches
he is fully recovered until the Louisiana-Lafayette game. Davis
said both quarterbacks will play in that contest. When and how much
is yet to be determined.
</P>
<P>
   The only certainty, said Davis, is there will be no preordained
appearance schedule. If a quarterback leads scoring drives on
consecutive possessions to open a game, said Davis, that player is
staying in as long as he has the hot hand.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are telling them we plan on playing both, but we're not
going to script anything that we can't follow through on,'' Davis
said. ``How that works itself out will be determined.''
</P>
<P>
   Both quarterbacks expressed satisfaction with a shared-duty
situation for the short term. But both players predicted coaches
would settle on an established starter by mid-September.
</P>
<P>
   ``I see two guys starting off the season. But, eventually, I
think there will probably be one person,'' Applewhite said.
</P>
<P>
   Asked if he expected coaches to settle on a single starter
before Big 12 play begins Sept. 30 against Oklahoma State, Simms
said: ``I would think so. Coach Brown has got a great sense for the
aura of the team and the right timing for everything. I trust him
with that.''
</P>
<P>
   Thus far, Brown said the timing hasn't been right to settle the
No. 1 issue on the minds of Longhorns' fans. But there is a new No.
1 on the Texas roster, a switch Simms made because he thought the
digit looked better on his 6-foot-5, 222-pound frame than the No. 8
he wore last season.
</P>
<P>
   Soon, Texas fans will learn if Simms emerges as No. 1 on the
depth chart as well.

A MODEL FIRST LADY WITH `INFINITE HEART' 

</HEADLINE>
   By SUSAN SWARTZ   
 The Press Democrat, Santa Rosa , Calif.   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Listening to the candidates' wives in Philadelphia and Los
Angeles go on about their husbands put Allida Black in mind of
Eleanor Roosevelt's appearance in Chicago in 1940.
</P>
<P>
   Historian and author Black, who's tailored a career around the
person she calls ER, tells how Eleanor Roosevelt stopped a nasty
fight on the floor of the Democratic convention that year. FDR, who
stayed home, was about to be nominated for his third term, but
there was hot disagreement over his vice presidential choice, Henry
Wallace.
</P>
<P>
   No first lady had ever addressed a national political
convention, but FDR asked his wife to go make peace. She took her
regal straight-backed self to the podium and without notes
addressed the scrapping delegates, telling them this was no time
for a president to not have a solid right-hand man. She pacified
the crowd, Wallace got the necessary votes and her speech became
another part of the ER legend.
</P>
<P>
   During FDR's days, Republicans complained that it wasn't right
for a president to cash in on his wife's popularity. Now everyone
loves the idea.
</P>
<P>
   Black spoke at a recent Women's Equality Day lunch in Santa
Rosa, Calif., one of the few places in the country that annually
celebrates the 19th amendment. She thinks Laura Bush, Lynne Cheney,
Tipper Gore and Hadassah Lieberman all made political points for
their husbands, but doesn't see any of them carrying what she calls
the ``Eleanor gene.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Not that they're wimps, but there's no one there who has the
vision of Eleanor Roosevelt,'' said Dr. Black, who teaches history
at George Washington University and is director and editor of the
Eleanor Roosevelt Papers.
</P>
<P>
   She credits Tipper Gore for having ``good knowledge of politics
and policy, knowing how to use her influence and understanding the
need to sometimes cross the aisle and build bipartisan support,''
as she did for her warning label project and mental health
awareness.
</P>
<P>
   The one with the Eleanor gene is Hillary Clinton, says Black,
who knows the first lady and who, in fact, regularly sent her ER
quotes for three years by e-mail.
</P>
<P>
   Think back to the early Hillary-bashing days and remember Bob
Woodward making sport of the first lady for saying that she had
imaginary conversations with Eleanor Roosevelt.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was the stupidest thing,'' says Black, pointing out that
anyone tuned into history who has a particular champion always
wonders how that person might respond in a given situation.
</P>
<P>
   Black, who has worked with the first lady on assembling a
collection of ER papers at the university, is accustomed to making
Eleanor-Hillary comparisons.
</P>
<P>
   ``In her heart ER was committed to her beliefs. It wasn't an
act. But Eleanor was also a pol, a real political warhorse. Same
with Hillary.''
</P>
<P>
   Another comparison is that both married men were comfortable
around strong women but took flak from their advisors when their
wives grabbed the spotlight. A popular line during Eleanor's time
was, ``Please, God, make Eleanor tired.''
</P>
<P>
   Regarding what kind of first-lady influence they actually
wielded, Black says, ``Eleanor lied. Hillary told the truth and got
in trouble for telling the truth. Eleanor went to her grave saying
she had no power.''
</P>
<P>
   Black got interested in Eleanor Roosevelt while studying FDR.
``I realized that so many things I associated with what he did,
Eleanor had a hand in.''
</P>
<P>
   She admired her faith in human nature. ``Her heart was infinite.
She saw the worst that democracy had to offer and she still kept
going. She saw people starving and she saw people being mean and
selfish, but she said you either believe that people are inherently
good or inherently bad. And she thought they were good. Not that
they were perfect but they had possibilities.''
</P>
<P>
   Eleanor, she said, believed that women's role was to be involved
in social change in matters of health care, schools, civil rights,
housing, immigration and the like, ``some of those things that are
now part of the platform for both political parties.''
</P>
<P>
   As to ER's appeal to women, she continues to enthrall. ``Women
admire the way she spoke out. She struggled to find her voice and
then she used it masterfully.''
</P>
<P>
   Who doesn't have a favorite ER quote pinned to their bulletin
board or their brain? Such as:
</P>
<P>
   ``You must do the thing you think you can not do.''
</P>
<P>
   Or, ``No one can make you feel inferior without your consent.''
</P>
<P>
   Black's favorite is, ``Staying aloof is not a solution. It is a
cowardly evasion.''
</P>
<P>
   If your spouse were running for president or you were running
for the U.S. Senate, it might be, ``A woman in politics must have a
hide as thick as a rhinoceros.''

is money, he believes, or so it is implied in the angry avalanche
of words he's pouring over reporters in Hawaii. There, in paradise
with the U.S. Olympic basketball team, the Miami Heat point guard
purports to be in purgatory. Free agency isn't supposed to be this
frustrating for a five-time All-Star like Timmy. Free agency is
supposed to be a time to savor, a time to be courted by NBA teams
with championship dreams, a time to ask for the moon, or at least
the monetary equivalent of what it took to send Neil Armstrong
there. Something changed for Hardaway, however, something he can't
see and won't acknowledge. He got hurt, repeatedly. He got old,
inevitably. And he became, consequently, more of a health risk than
a supernatural contract reward warrants. (George, Palm Beach Post)

 &HT;    NURSING HOME BANKRUPTCIES PROMPT CALLS FOR AID, QUESTIONS ABOUT
COLLAPSE
</HEADLINE>
 &HT;    For release on or after Sunday, Sept. 3 
 &HT;    By JULIA MALONE
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The nation's ailing nursing home industry is
pressing for a new infusion of federal funds as Congress returns to
the capital next week.
</P>
<P>
   And with one of every ten facilities now in bankruptcy
proceedings, Congress is widely expected to deliver $2 billion in
higher Medicare payments _ the second boost in as many years _ to
help the industry.
</P>
<P>
   Even so, calls for more funds have prompted renewed questions
about why the industry, whose nearly 17,000 facilities run chiefly
on government money, soared on huge profits during the 1990s and
then crashed last year. Eight of the major chains have sought
bankruptcy protection.
</P>
<P>
   The troubled companies blame budget-cutting by the federal
government, which three years ago turned down the spigot on
Medicare reimbursements.
</P>
<P>
   The nursing home industry, led by the American Health Care
Association, has run a $1 million public relations campaign, to
make its case that that Medicare spending for skilled nursing
facilities has been dropping lower _ by $15.8 billion over seven
years _ than Congress intended in its own budgets.
</P>
<P>
   However, critics of the industry fault the big chains for
creating their own crisis by over-extending themselves and
over-charging the government, even as they kept staffing so low
that, according to a federal study, 54 percent of the homes fail to
offer adequate care.
</P>
<P>
   Some of these conflicting views will be laid out Tuesday when
Sen. Charles Grassley, R-Iowa, holds a hearing in his Senate
Special Committee on Aging to examine the cause of the nursing home
collapses.
</P>
<P>
   The roots of the problem go back to the mid-1990s, when loose
rules for Medicare reimbursements allowed costs to soar 30 percent
a year to a high of $13.6 billion in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   The General Accounting Office, the investigative arm of
Congress, warned in 1995 of ``widespread examples of overcharges''
by nursing homes. The GAO cited a speech therapist whose pay was
only $12-25 an hour but whose company billed Medicare for $600 or
more per session.
</P>
<P>
   Nursing home chains also have been investigated for billing the
government for blood tests that were unnecessary, for
double-billing, and for seeking payment for services that were
never delivered.
</P>
<P>
   The Justice Department is now seeking $1.3 billion in repayment
for alleged fraud by Louisville-based Vencor Inc., a major nursing
home operator that is currently in bankruptcy court.
</P>
<P>
   The nation's largest chain, the Arkansas-based Beverly
Enterprises, Inc., has agreed to pay $175 million and sell 10
facilities to resolve federal charges that it defrauded Medicare.
</P>
<P>
   Congress clamped down on the Medicare overpayments and the
abuses by setting flat rates per resident as part of the Balanced
Budget Act of 1997. As a result, nursing chains that had reaped
huge profits under the old system saw their future suddenly darken.
</P>
<P>
   ``The companies that have gone bankrupt are the ones that were
very aggressive with their expansion plans throughout the mid
1990s,'' said Andrew Gitkin, a nursing home analyst with
PaineWebber. ``Their balance sheets got very bloated. That put them
in a vulnerable position.''
</P>
<P>
   Even so, he argued that Medicare payments dropped too low and
should be raised. ``If the industry is going to recover, that's a
critical component,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Critics of the industry are hard-pressed to reject the plea for
more funds. ``We don't want these facilities to close because it
would be a nightmare to move these residents,'' said Joshua Wiener,
an expert on long-term care with the Urban Institute, a Washington
research group.
</P>
<P>
   ``They basically hold older people hostage because they're
living in the facility,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   James Wilkes, whose Tampa, Fla., law firm has filed some 1,000
lawsuits against nursing homes for shoddy care, offers a harsher
assessment of the industry.
</P>
<P>
   ``They've created their own crisis, and they're now playing on
fears'' by pressuring Congress for more aid, he said. ``So far, the
blackmail's working.''
</P>
<P>
   Industry backers plan a rally next Tuesday of nursing home
workers on the steps of the U.S. Capitol to portray support for
Medicare increases as support for the elderly.
</P>
<P>
   In a sign of the group's confidence, the AHCA has halted an
earlier ad campaign to rally support for a new round of Medicare
increases for nursing homes.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, it is now running ads in the home states of key
senators, including Senate Minority Leader Tom Daschle, D-SD, and
Senate Finance Chairman William Roth, R-Del., to thank them for
their help.
</P>
<P>
   ``Caring for seniors,'' says the narrator in one of the TV
spots. ``That's our senator.''

 &HT;    Peeved neighbor rousts roosters
 &HT;    By John Kelso
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ An indication of how much Austin has become
infected with a bad case of infectious yuppititis can be seen on El
Paso Street.
</P>
<P>
   Somebody contacted the city to complain about Jesse Strzelecki's
three pet roosters roaming freely in the neighborhood.
</P>
<P>
   Lee Kelley, senior sanitarian with the city health department,
won't say who lodged the complaint. But there has been some talk
that the person who turned Jesse in must be a newcomer who doesn't
understand the Austin tradition of decorating with farm animals.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're being attacked by the new, newly nouveau riche of
dot-com people,'' said Diana Claitor, who is pro-rooster ``and
damned proud of it.'' She's a book editor who lives near Jesse.
</P>
<P>
   After the complaint, a city health inspector called Jesse and
told him he had to confine the roosters to his property. Now the
birds are in a pen in Jesse's yard.
</P>
<P>
   If you can't have free-range roosters in Austin, where can you
have free-range roosters?
</P>
<P>
   ``A large pain in my (butt) is what it is,'' said Jesse, a
carpenter who has two boats in his front yard, an enormous
Rottweiler-husky mix named Roger on a chain, a ``Ski Boat 4 Sale''
sign nailed to a tree and, all of a sudden, a wire pen with
roosters inside.
</P>
<P>
   It is trendy in Austin to have livestock in the neighborhoods.
We used to have a 400-pound hog named Wallstreet in my
neighborhood. I have seen a goat in a yard near Fran's Hamburgers
on South Congress Avenue. But as the town becomes more gentrified,
expect the herd to move on.
</P>
<P>
   Jesse says his rooster collection began two years ago when a
rooster _ he named him The Old Man _ showed up in his yard. ``I
started throwing food out to it, and it decided to stay,'' Jesse
said. He kept The Old Man, then went to a flea market and bought
two more roosters _ Red and Raven _ to keep The Old Man company.
</P>
<P>
   They're pets, and Jesse says most of the neighbors like having
them visiting their yards. ``Hey, at least I ain't fightin' 'em,''
Jesse said.
</P>
<P>
   He says The Old Man and the Rottweiler mix are buddies. ``The
Old Man, he'll sleep underneath the boat with my dog,'' Jesse said.
Now that The Old Man is doing time in bird jail, however, those
days of wine and roses are over.
</P>
<P>
   Linda Carlin, Jesse's next-door neighbor who moved here from
Seattle in November, is glad the birds are in prison.
</P>
<P>
   ``They scare my cats to death, and they poop in my yard,'' she
said.
</P>
<P>
   Hey, lady, free fertilizer.
</P>
<P>
   Linda said the birds keep her up all night with their crowing.
``I've had lots of friends make jokes about making chicken soup,''
she said. But she said she's not the one who got the birds busted.
</P>
<P>
   ``Several times when they start crowing at 4 in the morning, the
dog will chime in,'' she said. ``Then the guy starts up his truck.
Vroom vroom. At all hours. It's just bizarre.''
</P>
<P>
   Sounds normal to me.
</P>
<P>
   Linda likes the idea of the roosters being in a pen with a tarp
thrown over the top. ``I noticed this morning they were quieter,''
she said. ``They were still crowing, but it was like a muffled
crow.''
</P>
<P>
   Some of the street's longtime residents see it otherwise.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think they might as well run loose,'' said Mary McFarland,
who has lived in the same house for 47 years. ``They might as well
run loose as the dogs. If the dogs can run loose, I think the
chickens should run loose, too. At least they don't destroy the
yard. And the city sure don't keep up with their leash law.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's just the whole neighborhood's going to hell,'' Diana
said, speaking of the growth. She's got a point. Nobody in Austin
is free when the roosters aren't.

 &HT;    Months of therapy paying off for determined police officer
 &HT;    By Mary McCarty
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   DAYTON, Ohio _ Tuesday morning, Mary Beall went home to her
family.
</P>
<P>
   It was 107 days after she was critically wounded in the line of
duty during what the Dayton police officer describes as ``the one
minute and 48 seconds that changed everything.''
</P>
<P>
   Declaring ``I feel good,'' Beall said she couldn't wait to sleep
under the same roof with her family, to be there when children
Vanessa, 16, Ian, 13, and Maddie, 7, come home from school.
</P>
<P>
   ``That means almost everything to me,'' Beall said as her
husband, John, wheeled her out of the rehabilitation unit at Miami
Valley Hospital. ``It's what I've worked so hard for.''
</P>
<P>
   Beall spent the morning exchanging hugs and sometimes tearful
goodbyes with a staff that had come to regard her as family.
</P>
<P>
   Heather Boehmer, 21, a patient care technician, was one of many
wiping away tears after Beall's departure. ``I love her to death,''
she said. ``She's one strong lady. She just refused to be bitter.''
</P>
<P>
   Witnessing Beall's ``depth of character'' from day to day was a
life-changing experience for Boehmer: ``I always wanted to be a
nurse. Now I want to be a spinal cord nurse.''
</P>
<P>
   Certified rehabilitation nurse Donna Bova vacillated between joy
and sorrow. ``She's ready,'' Bova said. ``I'm only worried that
she'll try to do too much too soon.''
</P>
<P>
   ``She has a lot of support from her family and community,'' said
RN Gail November. ``She and John are very strong. They're going to
make it through the hard spots. She's going to come through and
shine like I know she can.''
</P>
<P>
   Paralyzed since the May 15 shooting, Beall has been undergoing
intensive therapy since being transferred from Good Samaritan
Hospital in mid-June. The suspect, Raham Twitty, 21, has been
indicted on nine felony counts, including three counts of felonious
assault.
</P>
<P>
   John Beall, also a Dayton police officer, said he expects his
wife to recover even more rapidly now that she is home.
</P>
<P>
   ``She's home now, and that in itself is a huge accomplishment,''
concurred Beall's doctor, David Shuster, medical director of the
spinal cord injury team at Miami Valley Hospital.
</P>
<P>
   Since coming to Miami Valley Hospital, Beall has resumed normal
speech and has undergone daily therapy to regain daily living
skills such as feeding herself and even applying makeup. She is
able to move her shoulder and to bend her arm at the shoulder and
at the wrist.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mary and her family; they have the right stuff,'' Shuster
said. ``Now will be the time to put that to use so that she can
function optimally.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of people look at this homecoming as an ending, but I
see it only as a beginning.''
</P>
<P>
   Before leaving the hospital Beall said that community support
has boosted her morale. ``I want to say thank you to everybody who
supported me and sent letters and cards, and thought about me all
the time in the hospital,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Beall's return home was the high point of what promised to be an
upbeat two days for the family. Tuesday was Mary Beall Get Well
Night at the Dayton Dragons minor league baseball game, and John,
flanked by Vanessa and Ian, threw out the first pitch. Proceeds
from items raffled at the game will be donated to the Mary Beall
Get Well Fund, managed by National City Bank. Some of the items
include a baseball signed by Dragons' part owner Earvin ``Magic''
Johnson and the honor of throwing out the first pitch at one of
this year's Dragons playoff games.
</P>
<P>
   Now, at $135,000, the fund will finance the building of a more
accessible home for the Beall family. Groundbreaking on the new
home is scheduled to take place this afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   It is hoped that the family will be able to move in before the
end of the year. But Tuesday morning, Mary Beall had a more
immediate goal: ``I just want to go home now,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Escorted by family, friends and partner, Dayton police officer
Shawn Smiley, Mary Beall left Miami Valley Hospital on Tuesday
morning _ and entered a new life.
</P>
<P>
   Heather Boehmer and her co-workers went back to the unit and had
a good cry. ``She means a lot to me,'' Boehmer said. ``She is so
ready to dive back in and resume her role as mother, wife,
daughter, sister. All these things in her life have changed. But
she's still Mary.''

 &HT;    COMMENTARY: Keeping the state out of religious affairs in
everyone's best interest
 &HT;    By Rowland Nethaway
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``We feel very strongly, and we hope you would agree, that
appealing along religious lines, or belief in God, is contrary to
the American ideal.
</P>
<P>
   ``The First Amendment requires that government neither support
one religion over another, nor the religious over the
non-religious.''
</P>
<P>
   Those words could have been directed at the ``No Pray, No Play''
advocates urging ``spontaneous prayer'' at football games of the
Santa Fe, Texas, high school where student-led prayers over
loudspeakers were ruled unconstitutional.
</P>
<P>
   Santa Fe is a town of about 8,500 about 30 miles southeast of
Houston. Santa Fe's minority of Jewish, Mormon and Catholic
residents report they feel surrounded by hostile forces in a
religious war.
</P>
<P>
   Many Christian fundamentalists feel the U.S. Supreme Court has
repeatedly demonstrated it does not understand the U.S.
Constitution's ``establishment clause'' that says, ``Congress shall
make no law respecting an establishment of religion, or prohibiting
the free exercise thereof. . . .''
</P>
<P>
   People who want to mingle government and religion argue that the
words ``separation of church and state'' do not appear in the
Constitution. They're right. But neither do the words ``interstate
commerce,'' ``separation of powers'' or ``right to privacy.'' They
are, however, fundamental constitutional principles.
</P>
<P>
   It was President Thomas Jefferson who first used the expression
``a wall of separation between church and state'' in an 1802 letter
explaining the First Amendment's establishment clause to the
Danbury Baptists.
</P>
<P>
   Many religious fundamentalists work tirelessly trying to force
the government to turn the United States into a Christian nation,
or at least take a supporting role in religion.
</P>
<P>
   The Founding Fathers understood the threat government-sponsored
religion posed for their new nation. That's why they restrained the
government from taking sides in religious matters while giving
rights to citizens to believe or not believe in religion.
</P>
<P>
   President George Washington's administration signed a treaty
with Tripoli in 1797 that declared ``the government of the United
States is not, in any sense, founded on the Christian religion.''
</P>
<P>
   The majority of the citizens in Santa Fe appear to want to
impose their religious beliefs on citizens who hold minority
beliefs by reciting the Lord's Prayer following the National
Anthem. A similar recitation of the Lord's Prayer took place in
Hattiesburg, Miss., last week without the use of a loudspeaker or
an official leader.
</P>
<P>
   Christian fundamentalists have started a movement to
spontaneously pray at high school football games by reciting the
principal Christian prayer taught by Jesus to his disciples. They
do not care about the feelings of non-Christians, non-believers or
Christians who believe that religious expressions should be
private.
</P>
<P>
   If these public prayers really are spontaneous, and if school
officials really have no role in this spontaneous expression of
personal religious observance, then they might be considered
constitutionally protected free speech.
</P>
<P>
   They also can be considered rude and disrespectful of the
beliefs of others who came only to enjoy a state-sponsored event.
</P>
<P>
   The words at the beginning of this column were not directed to
the ``No Pray, No Play'' fundamentalists. They were sent to Sen.
Joseph Lieberman, the Democratic vice-presidential candidate who is
an Orthodox Jew. Lieberman often fills his campaign talks with
``overt expressions'' of his religious beliefs.
</P>
<P>
   The words came from the Anti-Defamation League (ADL), the
world's leading organization fighting anti-Semitism through efforts
that counteract hatred, prejudice and bigotry.

<P>
   Have a question about the news? Colin Bessonette will try to get
an answer. Call 404-222-2002, or write him at The Atlanta
Journal-Constitution, P.O. Box 4689, Atlanta, Ga. 30302, or e-mail
him at q&AMP;a(at)ajc.com. Please include your name and hometown.
</P>
<P>
   Q: The Kursk tragedy reminds me of a similar incident involving
a U.S. submarine in the '60s. Can you elaborate on that?
</P>
<P>
   A: You're probably remembering the Thresher, a nuclear sub lost
after making a deep dive on April 10, 1963, some 220 miles east of
Cape Cod, Mass. It had 129 men aboard. A Navy court of inquiry
reported in December 1963 that the sinking ``most likely'' was due
to a piping system failure that allowed flooding of the engine
room.
</P>
<P>
   Another U.S. nuclear-powered sub, the Scorpion, with 99 men
aboard, was lost on May 27, 1968, 400 miles southwest of the
Azores. Officials said in December 1968 that the Scorpion probably
had suffered an implosion (caving in), caused by exceeding crush
depth.
</P>
<P>
   Q: With all the fires in our western states, I'm curious: Have
there been fires in the Canadian west as well?
</P>
<P>
   A: Yes, but they haven't been as widespread as in the United
States. ``We really haven't had much of a fire season in Canada,''
said Tom Johnston of the Canadian Interagency Forest Fire Center in
Winnipeg, Manitoba.
</P>
<P>
   Despite that, fires have burned areas in Manitoba, British
Columbia, Ontario, Northwest Territories and northern Saskatchewan.
Most recently, a fierce lightning storm sparked more than 350
forest fires in southeast British Columbia.
</P>
<P>
   Q: It was reported about two weeks ago that Albert Gore III was
ticketed in North Carolina for speeding 97 miles per hour in a
55-mph zone. What became of that? Has his father commented on this
publicly?
</P>
<P>
   A: The incident occurred Aug. 12. A magistrate released Gore,
17, on $100 bail and ordered a hearing for Sept. 13. Punishment
could be a steep fine and loss of driving privileges in North
Carolina. The only statement came from Camille Johnston,
spokeswoman for Tipper Gore, who said the Gores are dealing with
this ``as a family matter.''
</P>
<P>
   Q: The newspaper reported that ABC is not going to show Monday
Night Football this year in high definition. I bought a high
definition television set a year ago mainly to watch Monday Night
Football, and the picture was absolutely stunning. This seems like
a step backward. What are ABC's plans for this?
</P>
<P>
   A: The network would not tell why it decided not to broadcast
this year's Monday night games in high definition. ``Those are
business reasons we keep to ourselves,'' said Mark Mandel,
spokesman for ABC Sports. ``Next year, you never know.''
</P>
<P>
   Last year, the network had to broadcast the games through two
signals: one in high definition and one for regular TV viewers.
Mandel pointed out that this was expensive, and not enough
consumers yet have high definition sets to make the cost
worthwhile.
</P>
<P>
   Q: We visited the Biltmore Estate in Asheville, N.C., recently
and have two questions. During our tour, one of the rooms was shut
off for the filming of a scene for the sequel to ``Silence of the
Lambs.'' How many movies have been shot at the Biltmore Estate?
Also, while driving around the property, we saw several homes
marked ``Private Residence.'' Who lives there?
</P>
<P>
   A: Both the library and the tapestry room at Biltmore Estate
have been closed all of August for filming of ``Hannibal,''
starring Anthony Hopkins as the cannibalistic doctor Hannibal
Lecter and Julianne Moore as FBI Agent Clarice Starling. The
estate's grounds also will appear in the movie, said Elizabeth
Sims, public relations manager for Biltmore.
</P>
<P>
   Filming there was set to wrap up by this weekend, but Sims said
she can't tell how the scenes will fit into the movie's plot.
``It's a deep, dark secret here,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Ten other movies have filmed scenes on the grounds or in the
house, including ``The Last of the Mohicans,'' ``Richie Rich,''
``Forrest Gump,'' ``My Fellow Americans'' and ``Patch Adams.''
</P>
<P>
   There are several homes for estate employees that have sat on
the 8,000 acres since George Vanderbilt, Cornelius Vanderbilt's
grandson, opened the house on Christmas Eve, 1895. While George
Vanderbilt created the homes for people who helped run the farm,
they are now used for agriculture staff, security guards and other
employees whose jobs require them to be nearby.
</P>
<P>
   Q: What effect do the forest fires out West have on our smog
conditions?
</P>
<P>
   A: Nobody really knows, said Ted Russell, professor of civil and
environmental engineering at Georgia Tech. Some air particles, such
as sand and soot, can travel great distances.
</P>
<P>
   Sand from the Sahara Desert in Africa has been found in the air
in North America, and a study last year in Nashville found that
carbon monoxide from Canadian forest fires had found its way to
Tennessee.
</P>
<P>
   Even if soot and carbon monoxide could travel all the way across
the country by wind, it would be significantly diluted by the time
it got here, Russell said. In that case, soot from the fires could
contribute slightly to the haze we see overhead, and carbon
monoxide could affect the ozone levels in our area.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Does the air conditioning system in a car or house filter out
the harmful ozone or smog? In other words, during a smog alert, are
we safer, or just cooler, in a car or house?
</P>
<P>
   A: Today's air conditioners are not designed specifically to
filter out smog and ozone, but you are more protected from air
pollution while in your car or in a building because you're closed
off from air and the sun, said Dale Kemmerick of the Georgia
Environmental Protection Division.
</P>
<P>
   Plans are in the works for a coating to put on new and existing
air conditioners in cars and buildings that would reduce ozone
concentrations by up to 80 percent by breaking down ozone into
regular oxygen.

<TEXT>
<P>
   Q: What is happening with the lawsuit against Rep. Tom DeLay on
charges of racketeering and corruption?
</P>
<P>
   A: The latest development came in July when lawyers for DeLay
(R-Texas) filed a motion asking Democrats to clarify their case
that the congressman's campaign fund-raising activities amounted to
racketeering.
</P>
<P>
   The 14-page motion denounced as ``virtually devoid of precise
factual allegations'' the suit filed in May by the Democratic
Congressional Committee against DeLay and three tax-exempt
fund-raising groups: US Family Network, Republican Majority Issues
Committee, and Americans for Economic Growth.
</P>
<P>
   The groups are among the so-called ``stealth'' political action
committees under increasing scrutiny for expensive issue-advocacy
campaigns this election year. President Clinton recently signed
into law a measure that will require these organizations to
disclose sources of funding.
</P>
<P>
   Q: What is Tipper Gore's real first name?
</P>
<P>
   A: The name given to her at birth: Mary Elizabeth Aitcheson. Her
nickname was derived from a favorite song of her mother's,
``Ti-Pi-Tin,'' a Spanish ditty popular a half-century ago and used
as a lullaby in her childhood.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Who plays the part of Earl in the Dixie Chicks' music video
``Goodbye Earl?''
</P>
<P>
   A: It's Dennis Franz of ``NYPD Blue.'' In the piece, the Chicks
sing about Wanda, who is repeatedly beaten by her husband, Earl.
Wanda and her pal, Marianne, take matters into their own hands and
kill the wife-beater by feeding him poisoned black-eyed peas.
</P>
<P>
   Q: What was Sen. Joe Lieberman's service record? Did he serve in
the military?
</P>
<P>
   A: Lieberman avoided military service with two deferments, one
as a student and another for being a father.
</P>
<P>
   Here's the military history of the other major candidates, for
those who don't already know: Dick Cheney, like Lieberman, avoided
military service with deferments as a student and expectant father;
Al Gore volunteered for enlistment in the Army, serving as a
reporter and spending five months in Vietnam; and George W. Bush
served in the Texas Air National Guard as an F-102 pilot, signing
up for a program that rotated Guard pilots to Vietnam, but not
being called overseas.
</P>
<P>
   Q: What has become of Craig Livingstone, the former White House
security director who resigned in the wake of the FBI background
gathering incident? I haven't seen anything in the media about him
in quite some time.
</P>
<P>
   A: Livingstone is still in Washington, although he has indeed
dropped out of the headlines. He's a limo driver these days.
</P>
<P>
   Incidentally, it might be more correct to say he was fired as
the White House security chief, or at least ``resigned under
pressure,'' in June 1996 after it was discovered he had improperly
asked the FBI to turn over the secret background files on more than
400 Republican staffers.
</P>
<P>
   Jeffrey Podalsky, an editor at George magazine who was
Livingstone's passenger recently, recognized his driver's profile.
As Podalsky tells it, Livingstone told him, ``I'm Craig
Livingstone. I'm a victim of Filegate.''
</P>
<P>
   Q : In response to a question about Eli Whitney, Q&AMP;A mentioned
Revolutionary War Gen. Nathanael Greene. I'm interested in Greene,
because I moved here from Greensboro, N.C., which is named for him.
Where is he buried?
</P>
<P>
   A: Greene, who died in 1786 at Mulberry Grove Plantation near
Savannah, Ga., is buried in Savannah's Johnson Square.
</P>
<P>
   Q: We understand that Clemson University has been named by Time
magazine as its college of the year 2001. Can you confirm?
</P>
<P>
   A: Clemson is among four colleges and universities named College
of the Year by Time's annual college guide. The magazine focused on
colleges that do an exceptional job of teaching writing and
communication skills.
</P>
<P>
   Time's three other schools named College of the Year were in
different categories: Sarah Lawrence, Bronxville, N.Y., chosen for
liberal arts; Longview Community College, Lee's Summit, Mo.,
two-year college; and Cornell University, Ithaca, N.Y., private
college.
</P>
<P>
   The publication, Time's 2001 ``The Best College for You,''
arrived on newsstands Aug. 21.
</P>
<P>
   Q: I've seen reports on the Internet that Nation of Islam leader
Louis Farrakhan has stated that Sen. Joe Lieberman has dual
citizenship (United States and Israel). Is this true?
</P>
<P>
   A: Farrakhan questioned the national loyalty of Lieberman at a
news conference Aug. 11in Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   Farrakhan was quoted by the Los Angeles Times as saying: ``Mr.
Lieberman, as an Orthodox Jew, is also a dual citizen of Israel.
The state of Israel is not synonymous with the United States, and
the test he would probably have to pass is: Would he be more
faithful to the Constitution of the United States than to ties that
any Jewish person would have to the state of Israel?''
</P>
<P>
   A few days later, Farrakhan denounced the Times article, saying
the newspaper ``made a mischief of my words.''
</P>
<P>
   The assertion that Lieberman holds dual citizenship is
incorrect, by the way.
</P>

the White House security chief, or at least ``resigned under
pressure,'' in June 1996 after it was discovered he had improperly
asked the FBI to turn over the secret background files on more than
400 Republican staffers.

   Jeffrey Podalsky, an editor at George magazine who was
Livingstone's passenger recently, recognized his driver's profile.
As Podalsky tells it, Livingstone told him, ``I'm Craig
Livingstone. I'm a victim of Filegate.''
</P>
<P>
   Q : In response to a question about Eli Whitney, Q&AMP;A mentioned
Revolutionary War Gen. Nathanael Greene. I'm interested in Greene,
because I moved here from Greensboro, N.C., which is named for him.
Where is he buried?
</P>
<P>
   A: Greene, who died in 1786 at Mulberry Grove Plantation near
Savannah, Ga., is buried in Savannah's Johnson Square.
</P>
<P>
   Q: We understand that Clemson University has been named by Time
magazine as its college of the year 2001. Can you confirm?
</P>
<P>
   A: Clemson is among four colleges and universities named College
of the Year by Time's annual college guide. The magazine focused on
colleges that do an exceptional job of teaching writing and
communication skills.
</P>
<P>
   Time's three other schools named College of the Year were in
different categories: Sarah Lawrence, Bronxville, N.Y., chosen for
liberal arts; Longview Community College, Lee's Summit, Mo.,
two-year college; and Cornell University, Ithaca, N.Y., private
college.
</P>
<P>
   The publication, Time's 2001 ``The Best College for You,''
arrived on newsstands Aug. 21.
</P>
<P>
   Q: I've seen reports on the Internet that Nation of Islam leader
Louis Farrakhan has stated that Sen. Joe Lieberman has dual
citizenship (United States and Israel). Is this true?
</P>
<P>
   A: Farrakhan questioned the national loyalty of Lieberman at a
news conference Aug. 11in Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   Farrakhan was quoted by the Los Angeles Times as saying: ``Mr.
Lieberman, as an Orthodox Jew, is also a dual citizen of Israel.
The state of Israel is not synonymous with the United States, and
the test he would probably have to pass is: Would he be more
faithful to the Constitution of the United States than to ties that
any Jewish person would have to the state of Israel?''
</P>
<P>
   A few days later, Farrakhan denounced the Times article, saying
the newspaper ``made a mischief of my words.''
</P>
<P>
   The assertion that Lieberman holds dual citizenship is
incorrect, by the way.
</P>

 By ELEANOR BROWN    
 c.2000 New York Times    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ When we hear the term ``religious activists'' on
the evening news, we think automatically of Jerry Falwell, Pat
Robertson and a parade of conservative Christian evangelicals. But
now Joe Lieberman, a Jewish, mostly liberal Democrat running for
vice president, is talking about God, and as he does so, reviving a
potent tradition of a different kind of religious activism, one
that had lain dormant since an assassin's bullet struck down Martin
Luther King in 1968. When Lieberman called for a ``new spiritual
awakening'' in America in a sermon Sunday at a black church, he
nourished the hope of those more than ready for a rebirth of the
religious left.
</P>
<P>
   The selection of Lieberman as Al Gore's running mate has driven
a wedge between the words ``religious'' and ``right'' _ a pairing
that had come to seem automatic. His words echo King's in haunting
ways.
</P>
<P>
   It is ``midnight within the moral order,'' King once wrote. ``At
midnight colors lose their distinctiveness and become a sullen
shade of gray.'' He added, ``Midnight is the hour when men
desperately seek to obey the Eleventh Commandment, `Thou shalt not
get caught.'''
</P>
<P>
   Lieberman condemns a ``values vacuum,'' which he describes as
``an amorphous area where moral certainty fears to tread'' and
where there are ``fewer and fewer bright lines and more and more
blurs of gray.'' For some, he says, ``the Ten Commandments have
become little more than another `do and don't' list.''
</P>
<P>
   If Lieberman succeeds at reuniting morality and political
liberalism, he will have revived one of the most powerful movements
in American history _ a potent force in the abolition of slavery,
labor reforms and the civil rights movement. In the last few
decades, the debate about religion in public life has been unable
to move beyond a divisive standoff between religious conservatives
and liberal secularists who are overwhelmingly hostile to public
displays of religiosity. These secularists have embraced an
understanding of the Constitution as mandating a wall of separation
between church and state. In the interest of fostering social
cooperation and undermining religious bigotry, liberals insist that
we shed those aspects of our identities that are non-negotiable _
including our religious identities _ prior to entering the public
sphere.
</P>
<P>
   Liberals have misidentified the source of the problem. What is
problematic is not vibrant religious activism in the public square,
but the consistent association of religious devotion with a
particular set of dogmatic political opinions. And as much as
liberals have misidentified the problem, conservatives have
exacerbated the misconception through their strong-arm tactics and
unwillingness to entertain debate on their political views.
</P>
<P>
   Sadly, public religiosity is now automatically associated with a
core set of political positions, with opposition to abortion high
on the list. The intensity of the fundamentalist Christian
conservative position on abortion may be understandable, relating
as it does to the central religious idea of the sanctity of life.
However, the Christian conservatives have taken on other
controversial political positions with no clear connection to
religious belief. What, for example, does Christianity have to do
with supply-side economics?
</P>
<P>
   This is why Lieberman is so important. By severing the
connection between religious devotion and political conservatism,
he has revived the political debate. Although much has been made of
his moral rhetoric, he receives high ratings from liberal groups.
On core issues, he holds views that are diametrically opposed to
those of the religious right.
</P>
<P>
   Lieberman demonstrates that people of religious faith can, and
do, disagree on important political issues that imply deeply held
moral beliefs, including abortion. More important, he represents a
willingness _ rarely seen among liberals at the national level _ to
ground his political positions in specific religious commitments.

   LEGAL-MARIJUANA (San Francisco) _ Despite the U.S. Supreme
Court's ruling barring distribution of medicinal marijuana in

Supporters say they are not quite willing to give up the court

of marijuana will most likely be resolved in Congress and the White
House rather than in court. By JIM HERRON ZAMORA and ULYSSESS

   Generally a dish of Chinese Pork Tenderloin would be served with
an appropriate Chinese side dish like rice.
</P>
<P>
   But one of the wonderful things about American cooking is that
it can put dishes from any cuisine together if they taste good.
What appeals to me about this combination is the play of the salty,
spicy tenderloin against the creaminess of the Italian dish, pasta
with ricotta, garlic and basil.
</P>
<P>
   These dishes are opposites and they complement each other in
ways Chinese dishes cannot.
</P>
<P>
   The ricotta mellows the Chinese ingredients; the Chinese
ingredients enliven the Italian.
</P>
<P>
   The combination has one drawback: it provides a brown plate. So
I suggest a dish of cherry tomatoes on the side. They will provide
some acidity and lots of color.
</P>

&HT;     CLINTON AND LAZIO SPEAK, BUT DON'T ACT, LIKE CENTRISTS 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By LARA JAKES  
 &HT;     c.2000 Albany Times Union  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. _ She calls herself a ``New Democrat,'' standing in
the middle of the political road on social and fiscal issues. He
rides his ``Mainstream Express'' tour bus along the U.S. Senate
campaign trail in New York, touting himself as a moderate
Republican.
</P>
<P>
   But the ideological paths of First Lady Hillary Rodham Clinton
and four-term Rep. Rick Lazio rarely converge.
</P>
<P>
   For all their attempts to claim the political center, Clinton
and Lazio far more represent their respective parties' extremes
than either would likely admit.
</P>
<P>
   On issue after issue _ from abortion rights and health care to
crime and federal spending _ there are stark differences between
the two candidates where political analysts and pundits once
suggested there were none.
</P>
<P>
   ``Absolutely, there are differences,'' said Barbara Bartoletti,
state legislative director of the League of Women Voters, a
nonpartisan advocacy group. ``You can look at several issues and
see their differences, whether it's a tax plan or abortion or the
issue of responsible gun legislation.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton began running for the Senate in July 1999, while Lazio
entered the race only in May, replacing New York City Mayor Rudolph
Giuliani, who dropped out amid health and marital woes. The
candidates are vying in a historic race to replace retiring
Democratic Sen. Daniel Patrick Moynihan.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton and Lazio do share common ground in a few areas. Both
ardently favor environmental protection and the death penalty. Both
agree on increasing federal aid to hire more teachers and build new
classrooms, although Lazio only this summer reversed his
long-standing voting record to make way for those education plans.
</P>
<P>
   The most succinct example of their differences is in how Clinton
and Lazio would apportion federal aid. Each has called for at least
modest tax cuts and neither supports dipping into the $2.3 trillion
Social Security surplus.
</P>
<P>
   Overall, however, Clinton generally favors using federal tax
dollars for social programs: expanding health care coverage,
stabilizing low rent for public housing tenants and supplying
economic assistance to needy foreign nations. Lazio, meanwhile,
generally favors distributing federal aid in the form of deep tax
cuts and tax credits. He also supports giving more spending
discretion and control back to states and localities _ a main plank
of the GOP's ``Contract With America'' in 1994.
</P>
<P>
   In keeping with fiscal restraint, Lazio reserves judgment on the
$3.8 billion Transportation Bond Act New York voters will face on
November's ballot, fearing it could exacerbate state debt. Clinton
supports the referendum, which will repair crumbling roads and
bridges upstate and pump money into New York City's mass transit
system.
</P>
<P>
   On the matters that party extremists care most about, Clinton
and Lazio do not disappoint their respective ideologues:
</P>
<P>
   _ Lazio disavows flag-burning; Clinton would not vote for a
constitutional amendment to ban it.
</P>
<P>
   _ Lazio would hold U.S. senators and representatives to 12 years
of service; Clinton opposes such term limits.
</P>
<P>
   _ Lazio has voted against federally funded health insurance for
homosexual and other domestic couples; Clinton supports such
legislation.
</P>
<P>
   Only after Lazio entered the race did he openly favor making
attacks on homosexuals a federal crime, legislation that Clinton
has backed for years. And on abortion rights _ perhaps the most
inflammatory campaign topic of all _ Lazio's support is far
scaled-back compared with Clinton's.
</P>
<P>
   On gun control, too, Clinton's proposals to limit firearm sales
go well beyond Lazio's. But gun control is one of the only criminal
justice matters Clinton is willing to discuss, even when pressed.
Lazio's voting record is chock full of purported crime-curbing
measures _ well in line with the Republican Party.
</P>
<P>
   Because New York voters generally favor strong abortion rights
and increased spending on social programs like health care and
education, Clinton appears to have an edge on the issues, political
scientists have said.
</P>
<P>
   Yet Clinton has so far failed to break through the 50 percent
ceiling in public opinion polls, suggesting that voters may care
more about the personalities in the race than their stands on
issues.
</P>
<P>
   And if there is one point on which Clinton and Lazio steadfastly
converge, it is in pledging to stick to the issues while bashing
each other personally.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a citizen's responsibility to go beyond the rhetoric and
get to those differences on where these two stand on the issues,''
Bartoletti agreed. ``There are ideological differences here.''

&HT;     CADILLAC ROLLING OUT A BEEFIER SISTER TO THE CORVETTE 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By G. CHAMBERS WILLIAMS III  
 &HT;     c.2000 San Antonio Express-News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   The Corvette is about to go upscale. Way upscale.
</P>
<P>
   It will have a new name as well as a new look and a new
(translate: much higher) price. And to justify that higher price,
it will be badged as a Cadillac.
</P>
<P>
   But not to fear, Corvette fans; the Chevrolet version won't be
affected, and the Corvette as we know it will continue to exist and
evolve as before.
</P>
<P>
   The new roadster, as yet unnamed, will be just an extension of
the critically acclaimed Corvette C5 platform that debuted in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   But it will be trimmed in Cadillac regalia and priced to compete
against the likes of the Mercedes-Benz SL 500, Jaguar XK8, BMW's
new Z8, and the forthcoming Lexus SC 430 _ all of which are
limited-production luxury roadsters.
</P>
<P>
   Cadillac announced plans for the new roadster at the recent
Pebble Beach Concours d'Elegance car show in California, and said
that it would carry over many of the styling cues of the Cadillac
Evoq concept roadster that was unveiled in January 1999 at the
North American International Auto Show in Detroit.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Evoq concept dramatically demonstrated the promise of
Cadillac's `art and science' vision, and the production version
delivers on that promise,'' Cadillac General Manager Michael J.
O'Malley said. ``As we expand Cadillac's global portfolio, this
expressive roadster will be developed to attract customers in all
important luxury markets, including North America, Europe, Japan
and the Middle East.''
</P>
<P>
   General Motors said that it would expand the Corvette factory in
Bowling Green, Ky., to build the new Cadillac roadster alongside
the 'Vette, beginning in August 2002. It will go on sale that fall
as a 2003 model.
</P>
<P>
   Dave Hill, chief engineer for the current Corvette generation,
will lead the team developing the Cadillac, which he promises will
be quite different from the 'Vette.
</P>
<P>
   ``The new luxury roadster will be a Cadillac through and
through, blending the very best elements of dynamic styling,
advanced technology and robust performance,'' said Hill, who has 27
years experience with Cadillac even though he has been closely
connected with the Corvette program for a long time.
</P>
<P>
   Underneath, the car will ride on the same front engine/rear
transaxle vehicle platform as the current Corvette, but its
exterior, engine and transmission will be completely different.
</P>
<P>
   The luxury roadster will feature several exclusive Cadillac
technologies, GM said, including the 4.6-liter Northstar V-8 in its
first production rear-wheel-drive configuration, mated to an
electronic five-speed automatic transmission with manual mode in a
transaxle configuration like that of the C5.
</P>
<P>
   It will have other elements of the Northstar System, now used in
cars such as the Cadillac DeVille and Seville, including MagneRide
active suspension damping and the StabiliTrak yaw-control system.
The roadster also will have Michelin's revolutionary run-flat PAX
tire system and night vision, a Cadillac technological first
available this year only on the DeVille.
</P>
<P>
   Forget the Evoq name (pronounced ``evoke''), though; GM has
endured a lot of good-natured ribbing about the name of the concept
car (a lot of people have redubbed it the ``Ewok''), and has
decided that the production car will be called something else. We
don't know what, yet, however.
</P>
<P>
   Although an exact price hasn't been announced, the vehicles that
the new Cadillac will compete against cost from the low $80,000s
up. Expect the new roadster to be priced somewhere between $75,000
and $85,000, GM officials said.
</P>
<P>
   The big question, of course _ the one that underscores what a
gamble this vehicle will be for General Motors _ is whether enough
consumers will want to ante up 80 grand or more for a car bearing
the Cadillac name.
</P>
<P>
   This isn't Cadillac's first attempt at marketing a high-priced,
two-seat roadster. There was the Allante, on the market from 1987
to 1992, a $70,000 two-seater whose body was designed and built by
Pininfarina in Italy.
</P>
<P>
   Allante bodies were airlifted aboard Boeing 747 freighters to
Detroit, where final assembly of the vehicles took place.
</P>
<P>
   It also was intended to compete against the Mercedes roadster of
the day, the 560SL. Although the body was beautiful, the car fell
short of its mark in lots of other ways, including performance.
</P>
<P>
   Like all other Cadillac products since 1985, the Allante came
with front-wheel drive, which isn't what consumers expected in such
an expensive car that is supposed to have outstanding performance.
Competing vehicles all had rear drive, the preferred system for
high-end luxury cars.
</P>
<P>
   The new Cadillac roadster will have rear-wheel drive, of course,
because it is to be built on the Corvette chassis. But it also
signals the beginning of a switch back to rear-wheel drive for
Cadillac, whose only rear-drive product now is the German
Opel-built Catera midsize sedan.
</P>
<P>
   Even if it isn't a huge sales success, the new roadster is
expected to pave the way for a new, reinvented Cadillac brand
designed to appeal to consumers much younger than the median age of
67 for current Caddy buyers.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's one of these things that for internal and external
reasons, Cadillac has to go ahead with,'' said Rex Parker, vice
president of AutoPacific Inc., a leading auto-industry consultant
group based in Santa Ana, Calif. ``If BMW is going to do their Z8
roadster and Mercedes is continuing to do its SL, then Cadillac has
no choice if it wants to be a world-class luxury brand.
</P>
<P>
   ``Whether people buy it or not doesn't matter,'' Parker said.
``A manufacturer with pretensions of selling against the BMWs,
Mercedes, Audis and Lincolns of the world is forced into these
things. It's the ultimate rite of passage for Cadillac as it
prepares for its next generation of buyers. They have to do
something, no matter how expensive it is.''
</P>
<P>
   Putting the new roadster on the Corvette platform is a stroke of
genius, and will mean that the car will be much better executed
than the Allante, Parker said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It will have to be better conceived than the Allante simply
because the Corvette platform is so good,'' he said. ``And why not
build it? GM already has this great platform and a plant that is
way under-utilized.''

<P>
   Nissan's 2001 Pathfinder sport-utility vehicle might not exactly
qualify as a hot rod, seeing as though it is, after all, a truck.
</P>
<P>
   But with its all-new 240-horsepower V-6 engine, the midsize
Pathfinder has the most powerful standard engine in the class _ one
that has even more power than some V-8s in this segment.
</P>
<P>
   To get more power than what comes with the Pathfinder, in a
similarly priced vehicle, you would have to choose the biggest V-8
available in the Dodge Durango, and then you still would have just
245 horsepower. You could still top that with a Pathfinder if you
chose a manual transmission, because with the manual, the
Pathfinder's engine cranks out 250 hp.
</P>
<P>
   Sure, you could spend $43,000 or more for a V-8 model of the
Mercedes-Benz M-class or $50,000-plus for a BMW X5 and have more
power, but then you'd have to worry about making the mortgage
payment on the house.
</P>
<P>
   For just over $28,000, you can get a two-wheel-drive Pathfinder
with all of this zip, like our test vehicle, the 2001 Pathfinder
SE. Those of you who have older Pathfinders will find this extra
power quite exhilarating, seeing as how the new engine replaces one
that turned out just 170 horsepower. Torque has improved
dramatically, too, now up to 265 foot-pounds from 200.
</P>
<P>
   Nissan says the new Pathfinder will go from zero to 60 mph in
just 8.8 seconds, up from 10.9 seconds in last year's model.
</P>
<P>
   The new V-6 is based on the Nissan VQ 3.0-liter engine used in
the 2000 Maxima, Nissan's flagship sedan. But it has been enlarged
to 3.5 liters for the Pathfinder, and it was designed specifically
for sport-utility applications, with emphasis on higher torque at
the lower end of the power spectrum for off-road and trailer-towing
duties.
</P>
<P>
   With its aluminum block (35 pounds lighter than the cast-iron
block in the previous 3.3-liter V-6) and other improvements, Nissan
has been able to improve the efficiency and therefore the fuel
economy of this engine so that even with all of the extra power,
the EPA fuel-economy ratings are the same as last year's _ 16 miles
per gallon in the city and 19 on the highway (with automatic
transmission).
</P>
<P>
   Many of the engine improvements were designed to reduce noise,
vibration and harshness _ NVH in auto-engineering language. That
has helped to make the Pathfinder one of the most refined SUVs in
this class.
</P>
<P>
   Midway through the 1999 model year, the Pathfinder got a
refreshed exterior, but the vehicle's styling remains much like it
was when the current generation was introduced in 1996. The
exterior continues unchanged this year. The changes that came in
the mid-99 models brought a bolder, more aggressive appearance to
the vehicle, with a higher hood, multi-parabola headlights, special
grille designs and a muscular front fascia.
</P>
<P>
   There are some improvements inside for 2001, including a
restyled instrument panel and new center console.
</P>
<P>
   Even the four-speed automatic transmission is new, featuring
Nissan's ``Duette'' electronic control system for seamless
shifting. The automatic is standard on entry-level XE and uplevel
LE models, while it is optional on the midlevel, sportier SE model.
For performance addicts, the SE comes with a five-speed manual
gearbox, which can be a lot of fun with all of the extra
horsepower. (Remember than the Ford Mustang GT has only 260
horsepower with its V-8 engine. Of course, it weighs less than the
Pathfinder, so it has a bit more zip.)
</P>
<P>
   All Pathfinder models are available with shift-on-the-fly
four-wheel drive, which can be engaged at speeds up to 50 mph.
</P>
<P>
   Ride comfort is outstanding in the Pathfinder, due in large part
to its monoframe construction. Like such vehicles as the Jeep Grand
Cherokee and Lexus RX 300, this arrangement combines body, floor
and frame into one piece, like a car. Most other SUVs are pure
trucks, with body-on-frame designs.
</P>
<P>
   For everyday family use and highway trips, the Pathfinder is
hard to beat. Roadhandling is fairly decent for a sport-utility,
again due in large part to the monoframe construction.
</P>
<P>
   Sixteen-inch aluminum-alloy wheels with unique designs for each
model are standard on the 2001 Pathfinder, along with mud- and
snow-rated steel-belted radial tires. Antilock brakes are standard
throughout the model lineup, along with power rack-and-pinion
steering.
</P>
<P>
   Nissan's Infiniti luxury-car division sells its own version of
the Pathfinder called the QX4, but even the Pathfinder has a full
complement of premium equipment.
</P>
<P>
   Ours came with the automatic transmission, a fantastic
six-speaker Bose audio system with six-disc in-dash CD changer
(including steering-wheel controls), air-conditioning, halogen fog
lights, rear wind deflector, power windows/mirrors/door locks (with
remote control), cruise control, heated sideview mirrors,
titanium-tinted gauges, padded center armrest with dual-level
storage, retractable cargo cover to help keep your luggage secure,
leather-wrapped tilt steering wheel, 12-volt power outlets up
front, in the center console and in the rear, reclining 60/40 split
rear seat, variable windshield wipers, electric rear defroster and
wiper, and a flip-out rear liftgate glass.
</P>
<P>
   The test vehicle came with a few options to dress it up,
including an interior package ($1,799) that added leather seating
surfaces, power front bucket seats, simulated leather door trim,
and side air bags for the front occupants; and the SE sunroof
package ($1,099) that brought a power sliding glass sunroof, dual
illuminated visor mirrors, Homelink universal garage-door opener,
and a digital temperature gauge/compass.
</P>
<P>
   Base price for the SE two-wheel-drive model is $28,349 plus $520
transportation. Our test car's sticker totaled $31,767, including
transportation.
</P>
<P>
   Premium unleaded fuel is recommended, which will add to the cost
of operation of the new Pathfinder. Last year's model ran on
unleaded regular.

&HT;     VOLVO THINKS OUTSIDE THE BOXINESS WITH NEW MIDSIZE SEDAN 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By G. CHAMBERS WILLIAMS III  
 &HT;     c.2000 San Antonio Express-News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Volvo is out to get more of your business, especially if you're
in the market for a high-end model of the Toyota Camry or Honda
Accord.
</P>
<P>
   Ante up just a few bucks more, and you can drive the newest and
most affordable midsize Volvo rather than a boring Camry or Accord,
Volvo officials say.
</P>
<P>
   Meet the all-new S60 sedan, introduced recently in Sweden and
set to go on sale at U.S. Volvo dealerships in November with a base
price _ well-equipped _ of $27,075, including $575 transportation.
</P>
<P>
   You can load up an Accord or Camry to that kind of sticker
price, but Volvo believes that many consumers would rather have one
of its cars if the price were similar. I know I would. Besides the
inherent safety that comes with a Volvo, it has a lot more going
for it than a mass-produced car like a Camry or Accord.
</P>
<P>
   Even though Volvo expects the S60 to become its biggest seller
in the United States, with projected sales of 35,000 units for
2001, this car is not going to be in everyone's driveway, and
that's always a big plus for me. I've never been one to go with the
flow and buy what everyone else is buying; I prefer to drive
something that is a bit different, and perhaps even a lot more fun.
</P>
<P>
   Now I'll concede that not many people equate Volvo with fun,
because this is a brand that has built its reputation worldwide on
such solid and sensible attributes as safety and longevity. In the
past, the cars have been boxy and rather dull performers, but in
the past two or three years, Volvo has taken great steps to shed
its stodgy image.
</P>
<P>
   The new S60 is about the sportiest-looking Volvo in decades at a
reasonably affordable price, although company officials are quick
to point out that it is a sporty car, not a sports car.
</P>
<P>
   Gone are flat and boring body panels; everything on the S60 is
curved or creased, giving it the most exciting Volvo styling yet.
</P>
<P>
   Under the hood, there will be three engine choices, ranging from
a more-than-adequate naturally aspirated 168-horsepower, 2.4-liter
five-cylinder, to a light-pressure turbo version of this engine
rated at 197 horsepower, to the top-of-the-line 2.3-liter
high-pressure turbo that cranks out 247 horsepower.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, that could be a problem as far as Volvo's safety
record goes. Turn a lot of people loose in a sporty sedan with 247
horsepower, and they might not be driving as safely and sanely as
the average middle-age female Volvo driver of days gone by.
</P>
<P>
   You'll be able to buy the S60 with a five-speed manual
transmission if you want to have more driving fun, and even if you
decide you need an automatic, there will be an optional five-speed
automatic with Geartronic manual clutchless shifting in addition to
the regular five-speed automatic.
</P>
<P>
   Underneath, the S60 shares about 60 percent of its components _
including engines and transmissions _ with the luxury S80, Volvo's
$36,000-plus full-size sedan. That's a plus for consumers, because
you're essentially getting a more expensive car than you're paying
for. In fact, the S60 even bears a strong resemblance to the S80.
</P>
<P>
   Inside, the car is designed to hold five adults quite
comfortably, and as usual, safety abounds. Driver and front
passenger get front and side air bags, while rear outboard
passengers have the safety benefits of a side-curtain air bag for
side-impact protection. Anitlock brakes are standard.
</P>
<P>
   Judging by length, the S60 is the smallest in the midsize class
at 180.2 inches long. That's more than eight inches shorter than
the Camry and Accord, and 17 inches shorter than the Ford Taurus.
</P>
<P>
   But interior volume is on par with the competitors, keeping the
S60 in the midsize class.
</P>
<P>
   Whether this car really is sporty enough to give Volvo a big
boost out of the boxy-car syndrome will be up to the consumers, but
achieving the sales goal shouldn't be all that difficult _
considering that Toyota, Honda and Ford sell 300,000 to 400,000 of
their respective midsize cars each year.

&HT;     EUROPE HELPS MAKE CATERA ANYTHING BUT A CADILLAC 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By G. CHAMBERS WILLIAMS III  
 &HT;     c.2000 San Antonio Express-News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   General Motors' luxury-car brand has never been popular with
baby boomers or Generation Xers, who haven't bought into the
gratuitous luxury trappings of traditional Cadillacs _ that cheap,
Las Vegas-giltzy stuff that starts falling off after a year or two.
</P>
<P>
   To be fair, Cadillac has been moving away from that silly
pseudo-luxury stuff for several years now, having seen its share of
the market fall dramatically over the past decade or so as affluent
boomers and Generation Xers have shown preference for European and
Japanese luxury vehicles.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the larger Cadillacs such as the Seville and the all-new
DeVille have a lot of negativity to overcome in the minds of
younger buyers, which is why GM chose to bring the Catera to
Cadillac showrooms three years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Built in Germany by GM's Opel subsidiary, the Catera really is
anything but a Cadillac. It's a version of the Opel Omega, softened
up a bit for the American market, but looking more like a high-end
model of a mainstream midsize sedan such as the Toyota Camry, Honda
Accord or Volkswagen Passat than a luxury car.
</P>
<P>
   GM says the Catera is designed to compete against near-luxury
midsize models such as the Mercedes C280, BMW 328i, Lexus ES300,
Volvo S70 GLT and Lincoln LS.
</P>
<P>
   As far as price goes, that's true. With a base price of $30,860
(plus $640 transportation), the Catera fits into that class, which
starts about $5,000 or more above the high-end models of the Camry,
Accord and Passat.
</P>
<P>
   But even with its European heritage, the Catera faces an uphill
battle with those $30,000-plus competitors, whose brand names are
well-represented in the driveways of affluent, educated people in
the 35-55 age bracket.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the Catera has a lot going for it, especially among
consumers who want an American brand (even if it is made in
Germany) with the style and driving characteristics of a premium
European or Japanese sedan.
</P>
<P>
   I can't say that I believe the Catera will take a lot of sales
away from Lexus, Acura, BMW or Mercedes, but it is doing a credible
job of taking sales away from some other brands besides those built
by General Motors (a so-called conquest sale). In a survey of
Catera buyers in 1998, GM found that 45 percent came from non-GM
brands, making the Catera the top conquest vehicle in the GM fleet.
</P>
<P>
   Nationwide, Catera buyers have been averaging about 10 years
younger than the average age for buyers of Cadillac's other cars
(which is about 60). GM's target age group for the Catera is 35-49,
with average household income of $75,000 or more, primarily
college-educated professional and managerial consumers _ with a
50-50 split of male and female buyers.
</P>
<P>
   The gender split has been close to that 50 percent, as targeted,
although I believe more women than men will like this car.
</P>
<P>
   That's because, while the car has appealing if not exciting
styling, a very functional interior with comfortable seats and lots
of worthwhile amenities, overall performance is not on par with
that of some competitors.
</P>
<P>
   What that means is that much like Cadillacs of the past, the
Catera is more of a riders' car than a driver's car. Roadhandling
isn't crisp and precise like that of a BMW or Audi; it's more like
that of a Volvo S70 or Lexus ES 300.
</P>
<P>
   That's not bad; those are fine automobiles. But they just don't
evoke the kind of driving excitement that is found in a driver's
car, and consumer studies have shown that men are more interested
in that kind of performance than women are (although I know there
are many women who like performance-oriented cars, and many men who
couldn't care less about performance).
</P>
<P>
   The Catera is 192 inches long _ about five inches longer than
the Camry and Accord _ and has only one engine available: a
3.0-liter, double-overhead-cam V-6 rated at 200 horsepower and 192
foot-pounds of torque. The only transmission available is a
four-speed automatic.
</P>
<P>
   The car will go from zero to 60 mph in 8.5 seconds, which is a
bit sluggish for this class, and top speed is 125 mph.
</P>
<P>
   Steering isn't as crisp as it could be, probably because of the
old-style recirculating-ball system in the Catera. BMW and Mercedes
held on to recirculating-ball steering for a long time, but
recently shifted to the more precise rack-and-pinion system that
the Japanese use.
</P>
<P>
   One plus for the Catera is its rear-wheel drive, which has
become a rare commodity among midsize premium sedans.
</P>
<P>
   Competing sedans from Lexus, Acura, Volvo, Saab, Volkswagen,
Lincoln and Infiniti come with front-wheel drive. BMW and Mercedes
are still clinging to rear drive. (There are a couple of Lexus
models with rear drive that are close to the price of the Catera,
however, including the GS 300 and all-new IS 300 sedans.) Rear
drive is generally preferred on a performance car because it often
creates better roadhandling.
</P>
<P>
   Our test car was the top-of-the-line Catera Sport, a version
that was introduced in 1999 and continued in 2000 as the sportiest
and most expensive model.
</P>
<P>
   The Sport package is a $2,510 option to the base Catera sedan
that includes such extras as a rear-deck spoiler, special 17-inch
tires and wheels, sport suspension, xenon high-intensity-discharge
headlights, eight-way power front passenger seat, memory driver's
seat and mirrors, heated front seats, exterior and interior special
Sport trim, audible theft-deterrent system and built-in garage-door
opener.
</P>
<P>
   Standard equipment on all Cateras includes eight-way power
driver's seat, front bucket seats, rear bench seat with 40/20/40
folding split to expand trunk capacity, power windows and door
locks with remote control, dual-zone automatic climate control,
front and side-impact air bags for driver and front-seat passenger,
unibody construction (with steel safety cage), four-wheel power
antilock disc brakes, cornering lights, cruise control, rear
defogger, electronic level control, fog lights, leather seats,
power outside mirrors, full-size spare tire, speed-sensitive power
steering, tilt steering wheel, traction control and
twilight-sentinel automatic headlights.
</P>
<P>
   Our test car came with the optional Bose audio system with
built-in AM/FM/weather band/cassette/single-disc CD player in the
dash ($973) and a power sunroof ($995). Total sticker was $35,978,
including transportation.
</P>
<P>
   The Catera seats five adults rather comfortably, although with
the front seats pushed as far back as they will go to accommodate
tall people, leg room gets a bit tight for the rear passengers.
</P>
<P>
   The front bucket seats were among the most comfortable I've
tested this year, and the two cup holders that pop out of the
center console hold large soft-drink cups (but not the huge ones).
</P>
<P>
   The instrument panel and dash are simple and straightforward,
with clear, easy-to-read analog gauges and black plastic trim (with
no silly gold-looking trim stuck on that will fall off later). This
is definitely the kind of understated elegance and functionality
that will appeal to sophisticated buyers, the kind that GM is
targeting with the Catera.

   INNOVATION-IN-WORKPLACE-HARVARD-NEWSLETTERS _ Innovation is hot
these days _ what company doesn't want to be considered innovative?
Unfortunately, many managers often assume that coming up with
creative ideas is somebody else's responsibility. After all, the
innovations that get the most attention are technologies or
services that find huge markets (Post-it notes, online trading) or
that somehow change the rules of the business game (a new
e-purchasing system). This articles offers tips to managers to
create a culture of innovation in the office. By the editorial

   Innovation is hot these days _ what company doesn't want to be
considered innovative?
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately, many unit heads and managers often assume that
coming up with creative ideas is somebody else's responsibility.
After all, the innovations that get the most attention are
technologies or services that find huge markets (Post-it notes,
online trading) or that somehow change the rules of the business
game (a new e-purchasing system).
</P>
<P>
   In fact, what might be called ground-level innovation _ new
products or processes developed on the shop or office floor _ can
be a powerful competitive weapon.
</P>
<P>
   Consider the following example: Managers and employees of
Gardner Merchant, a U.K.-based industrial food-service and catering
company, came up with a number of ideas to boost revenue. They
began profiling the customers at each location and tailoring the
food accordingly. They developed a frequent-flyer-style ``food
miles'' scheme to encourage more patronage of the cafeterias. They
even sponsored cooking demonstrations, which increased cafeteria
patronage 12.5 percent, according to Bob Nelson, author of the book
''1001 Ways to Take Initiative at Work'' (Workman Publishing,
2000).
</P>
<P>
   Here are some tips to create a culture of everyday innovation:
</P>
<P>
   TALK TO CUSTOMERS
</P>
<P>
   That's a Marketing 101 lesson, and most business units with
external customers make a point of asking those customers what else
they might need.
</P>
<P>
   But even units such as human resources or maintenance have
customers; they're just inside the organization. How many such
departments ever ask the managers and employees they serve how they
could improve?
</P>
<P>
   Cisco Systems' famous real-time accounting system got its start
five years ago with one such step. According to Fortune's Thomas A.
Stewart, the company's salespeople were ``fuming'' because expense
reporting was cumbersome and reimbursement slow. The finance
department figured out how to move the process to the Web, thereby
speeding it up and delighting the salespeople. That move led to an
automated commission system, one big step toward real-time
financial reporting.
</P>
<P>
   LISTEN TO EMPLOYEES
</P>
<P>
   Suggestion systems, brainstorming sessions, ``innovation
challenge'' meetings _ there's no shortage of techniques to solicit
innovative ideas from employees.
</P>
<P>
   Set a goal of coming up with ideas for five product
improvements, 10 workable cost-cutting suggestions or three ways to
boost revenue.
</P>
<P>
   In many companies the main challenge isn't coming up with ideas.
It's figuring out whether and how to implement them. Experts
recommend these approaches:
</P>
<P>
   1. Guilty until proven innocent. In a brainstorming session,
every idea is worth writing down. When it comes to selecting,
evaluating and implementing innovative ideas, however, start by
assuming they're all worthless. This avoids wasting time on bad
ones.
</P>
<P>
   2. Not just the usual suspects. It's always tempting to populate
the research-and-evaluation team with people who are the most
knowledgeable in any given area. Trouble is, that's likely to
produce answers based on what these people already know.
</P>
<P>
   David Snowden, director of IBM Corp.'s Institute of Knowledge
Management, suggests mixing in some people who are good at
networking _ people who will ask around outside the group and get
ideas no one has thought of.
</P>
<P>
   WATCH FOR DISRUPTIVE INNOVATION
</P>
<P>
   The ground-level innovator faces the same potential pitfall as
the official new-product developer: Listening to customers and even
employees is likely to generate ideas for more of the same, only
better. Meanwhile, new technology or business practices may be
creating radical alternatives that you hardly notice until they
take away your reason for being.
</P>
<P>
   Corporate print shops and travel departments, for example, may
be great at what they do, yet still fall victim to sophisticated
and less expensive external service providers. But sometimes new
technology can be co-opted and implemented at home, as when a print
shop switches over to the latest desktop-publishing equipment.
</P>
<P>
   Ground-level innovation is like a stealth weapon, hardly visible
to competitors. But it may be one armament that distinguishes
victors from vanquished in today's business battles.

<P>
   Successful presenters stand up, speak with confidence and
passion, and sit down in the time allotted to the warm applause of
the contented crowd. Unhappy presenters fail because of a huge
variety of individual mistakes, hang-ups and personal tics.
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, there are whole categories of similar mistakes that
unpracticed speakers make and that are worth noting in order to
avoid. Here are five of the most common.
</P>
<P>
   NOT REHEARSING
</P>
<P>
   Lack of rehearsal is the most common mistake business presenters
make.
</P>
<P>
   Professional performers find this lapse in good sense
inexplicable. Musicians practice for hours daily. Actors rehearse
for up to six weeks before a show. And yet, business presenters
say, ``I'll just wing it.''
</P>
<P>
   Those are the four saddest words in the business lexicon. Nine
times out of 10, they lead to disaster.
</P>
<P>
   Why not rehearse? Afraid of looking silly? You'll feel much
worse bombing in front of the real crowd.
</P>
<P>
   Are you so nervous that the idea of rehearsing is almost as bad
as the speaking itself? Then you need rehearsal more than most.
Remember, the alternative is worse.
</P>
<P>
   NOT TELLING YOUR AUDIENCE WHY YOU'RE THERE
</P>
<P>
   Audiences come to hear a presentation with one question in their
minds: why are we here?
</P>
<P>
   Don't begin by giving them the information that you've carefully
prepared. Instead, tell them why your material is important. Only
then will they settle in to listen to all the brilliant material
you have to offer.
</P>
<P>
   How long should you spend framing the issue? It depends on how
familiar the audience is with the topic. If you're discussing a
well-known problem, you can dispense with the orientation in a few
minutes. If you're delving into material that's new to them, you
may want to take longer.
</P>
<P>
   INTRODUCING THE TOPIC, EXPLAINING IT, THEN SUMMARIZING WHAT WAS
SAID.
</P>
<P>
   This bit of advice has been a staple of public speaking courses.
The problem is that audiences today are quicker to pick up the
context than they used to be _ and they have shorter attention
spans.
</P>
<P>
   If you begin by giving them a quick summary of what you're going
to say, audiences will spend the time getting settled, scanning
their appointment books or deciding whether to attend another
presentation. Then, when you get to the end and offer a summary,
they'll start to leave.
</P>
<P>
   Endings are crucial for successful public speaking because they
are what people are most likely to remember. Skip the summary and
end with a bang _ something useful and new for the audience.
</P>
<P>
   USING TOO MANY SLIDES
</P>
<P>
   For some reason, probably because PowerPoint has made slide
creation far too easy, listeners everywhere are inundated with
massive numbers of slides.
</P>
<P>
   Slides should be used sparingly to show a powerful visual image
that reinforces a key point.
</P>
<P>
   A barrage of slides misuses the medium. Why? When your audience
is looking at the slide, it's not looking at you. You have lost the
attention of your listeners, even if for only a brief time. You
then must put out a great deal of extra energy to get that
attention back.
</P>
<P>
   Rule of thumb: Limit yourself to one slide every five minutes.
</P>
<P>
   USING SLIDES AS A SPEECH OUTLINE
</P>
<P>
   Far too many speakers today create a slide ``deck'' by dumping
all the information they have into slides and, as a result,
presenting an endless show of data.
</P>
<P>
   The result? Word-heavy slides that essentially represent an
outline for the speaker to follow.
</P>
<P>
   But, you say, it's comforting for the presenter. So what's wrong
with presenting the audience with an outline of the speech through
slides?
</P>
<P>
   First, it kills the mystery out of the speech. The audience can
see where the speaker is going and get bored. Also, reading all
those words, and reconciling them with what the speaker actually
says, is tiring.
</P>
<P>
   But most important, the speaker will appear unprepared, and that
is both discourteous to the audience and a signal of disaster to
come.
</P>
<P>
   Don't join the throngs of boring business speakers and dull
presentations. Refuse to follow these surefire rules for failure.
</P>
<P>
   But be warned if you do: You may find your audiences actually
listening to what you have to say.

passion, and sit down in the time allotted to the warm applause of
the contented crowd. Unhappy presenters fail because of a huge
variety of individual mistakes, hang-ups and personal tics.
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, there are whole categories of similar mistakes that
unpracticed speakers make and that are worth noting in order to
avoid. Here are five of the most common.
</P>
<P>
   NOT REHEARSING
</P>
<P>
   Lack of rehearsal is the most common mistake business presenters
make.
</P>
<P>
   Professional performers find this lapse in good sense
inexplicable. Musicians practice for hours daily. Actors rehearse
for up to six weeks before a show. And yet, business presenters
say, ``I'll just wing it.''
</P>
<P>
   Those are the four saddest words in the business lexicon. Nine
times out of 10, they lead to disaster.
</P>
<P>
   Why not rehearse? Afraid of looking silly? You'll feel much
worse bombing in front of the real crowd.
</P>
<P>
   Are you so nervous that the idea of rehearsing is almost as bad
as the speaking itself? Then you need rehearsal more than most.
Remember, the alternative is worse.
</P>
<P>
   NOT TELLING YOUR AUDIENCE WHY YOU'RE THERE
</P>
<P>
   Audiences come to hear a presentation with one question in their
minds: Why are we here?
</P>
<P>
   Don't begin by giving them the information that you've carefully
prepared. Instead, tell them why your material is important. Only
then will they settle in to listen to all the brilliant material
you have to offer.
</P>
<P>
   How long should you spend framing the issue? It depends on how
familiar the audience is with the topic. If you're discussing a
well-known problem, you can dispense with the orientation in a few
minutes. If you're delving into material that's new to them, you
may want to take longer.
</P>
<P>
   INTRODUCING THE TOPIC, EXPLAINING IT, THEN SUMMARIZING WHAT WAS
SAID.
</P>
<P>
   This bit of advice has been a staple of public speaking courses.
The problem is that audiences today are quicker to pick up the
context than they used to be _ and they have shorter attention
spans.
</P>
<P>
   If you begin by giving them a quick summary of what you're going
to say, audiences will spend the time getting settled, scanning
their appointment books or deciding whether to attend another
presentation. Then, when you get to the end and offer a summary,
they'll start to leave.
</P>
<P>
   Endings are crucial for successful public speaking because they
are what people are most likely to remember. Skip the summary and
end with a bang _ something useful and new for the audience.
</P>
<P>
   USING TOO MANY SLIDES
</P>
<P>
   For some reason, probably because PowerPoint has made slide
creation far too easy, listeners everywhere are inundated with
massive numbers of slides.
</P>
<P>
   Slides should be used sparingly to show a powerful visual image
that reinforces a key point.
</P>
<P>
   A barrage of slides misuses the medium. Why? When your audience
is looking at the slide, it's not looking at you. You have lost the
attention of your listeners, even if for only a brief time. You
then must put out a great deal of extra energy to get that
attention back.
</P>
<P>
   Rule of thumb: Limit yourself to one slide every five minutes.
</P>
<P>
   USING SLIDES AS A SPEECH OUTLINE
</P>
<P>
   Far too many speakers today create a slide ``deck'' by dumping
all the information they have into slides and, as a result,
presenting an endless show of data.
</P>
<P>
   The result? Word-heavy slides that essentially represent an
outline for the speaker to follow.
</P>
<P>
   But, you say, it's comforting for the presenter. So what's wrong
with presenting the audience with an outline of the speech through
slides?
</P>
<P>
   First, it kills the mystery of the speech. The audience can see
where the speaker is going and get bored. Also, reading all those
words, and reconciling them with what the speaker actually says, is
tiring.
</P>
<P>
   But most important, the speaker will appear unprepared, and that
is both discourteous to the audience and a signal of disaster to
come.
</P>
<P>
   Don't join the throngs of boring business speakers and dull
presentations. Refuse to follow these surefire rules for failure.
</P>
<P>
   But be warned if you do: You may find your audiences actually
listening to what you have to say.

&HT;     GORE CAN'T COUNT ON ASIAN-AMERICAN VOTE 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     Commentary  
 &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By WILLIAM WONG  
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ An Asian-American political action committee
called 80/20 made headlines last weekend when it endorsed the
presidential candidacy of Democrat Al Gore. Even some Republicans
in the nonpartisan group voted to support Gore over Republican
nominee George W. Bush.
</P>
<P>
   But before anyone concludes that Asian-Americans lean
Democratic, let's examine the endorsement in political context.
</P>
<P>
   The 80/20 committee was started by S.B. Woo, a University of
Delaware physics professor, a former Democratic lieutenant governor
and an unsuccessful U.S. Senate candidate from that small state.
</P>
<P>
   His main issue is Asian-American empowerment through fair
representation in a presidential administration and major private-
and public-sector institutions. It is, in short, a ``glass
ceiling'' issue for well-educated, middle-class Asian-American
professionals.
</P>
<P>
   He recruited such well-known Asian-Americans as Chang-lin Tien,
the former chancellor at the University of California at Berkeley,
and launched an electronic mail campaign that now has an address
list exceeding 300,000 names.
</P>
<P>
   80/20's goal is to funnel 80 percent of the Asian-American
community's votes and financial contributions to the presidential
candidate who has shown the most support for the group's goals. A
committee made up of Democrats, Republicans and independents
debated endorsements over the weekend in Los Angeles. Their choice
was Gore.
</P>
<P>
   The fact the group's endorsement drew national news media
attention indicates growing recognition of Asian-American political
empowerment issues. It would be a mistake, however, to assume
80/20's support of Gore means Asian-Americans will vote
overwhelmingly for the Democrat in November.
</P>
<P>
   Asian-Americans are maddeningly diverse in their political views
and actions and no one has yet been able to rely on significant
bloc votes the way the Democrats can count on African-American
support in presidential campaigns.
</P>
<P>
   As much as 80/20 members will try to influence family and
friends, I doubt Gore will get 80 percent of the Asian-American
vote. I cannot think of a reliable way to measure whether 80
percent of Asian-American political contributions will go to Gore.
</P>
<P>
   Besides, it is doubtful Gore would openly embrace getting
financial support from Asian-Americans, given his continuing
embarrassment over the infamous Buddhist temple fund-raiser four
years ago.
</P>
<P>
   While I personally like 80/20's presidential choice, there are
other issues to be considered. The Democratic fund-raising scandal,
for one.
</P>
<P>
   Asian-American Democratic apparatchiks were stung when their
party questioned their loyalty after media and congressional
revelations of questionable Asia-based contributions to the
Clinton-Gore re-election campaign in 1996. In fact, a handful of
Asian-American Democratic operatives have been caught holding the
bag while Democratic big-shots like Clinton, Gore and party
higher-ups have escaped, relatively unscathed.
</P>
<P>
   On another front, the Clinton administration's Justice
Department is pursuing the prosecution of Wen Ho Lee, a Taiwan-born
computer scientist and U.S. citizen accused of mishandling
sensitive nuclear secrets and suspected of being a spy for China.
The Lee case has become a cause celebre among many 80/20 supporters
who, like Lee, are Asian immigrant scientists and scholars.
</P>
<P>
   Third, while the Clinton-Gore administration supports continuing
``engagement'' with China, some Democrats have been openly hostile
to China over human-rights issues. In fact, Rep. David Wu, D-Ore.,
has lost some support among Chinese-Americans because of his stance
on China.
</P>
<P>
   These oddities don't mean 80/20 should have gone for Bush, even
though many Asian-Americans say they share similar ``family
values'' with Republicans. Some Republican leaders are as vehement
in their anti-China rhetoric and action as certain prominent
Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   Overall, the Republican Party has nurtured leaders who have
shown a mean streak toward immigrants, including those from Asia.
</P>
<P>
   The bottom line: 80/20's endorsement of Gore makes for lively
political fodder, but one group's action isn't necessarily going to
sway many Asian-Americans one way or the other.

IT WAS AN EDGY DAY FOR PATRIOTS ROOKIES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MICHAEL MADDEN  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   FOXBOROUGH, Mass. _ It was a Sunday morning in late August,
usually the quietest time of the week. A time to go to church, to
head to the beach or lake, to lounge in the yard, to nibble on
breakfast while perusing the Sunday papers.
</P>
<P>
   But for a few young men in Foxborough, those usually placid
hours were a time of angst. There was no football game, just a
wait. A wait to learn whether the direction of their lives would be
reversed 180 degrees. Boyhood dreams realized _ or perhaps gone
forever.
</P>
<P>
   They are football players. Last Sunday was the day the Patriots,
as well as 30 other National Football League teams, made the final
reductions to their squads. Those reductions are called ``cuts,'' a
most apt word, since cuts bring blood.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was in my room at the End Zone Motel (in Foxborough),'' said
rookie wide receiver Dane Looker. ``My wife and I woke up about
8:30 in the morning, and I don't think I stopped staring at the
phone the whole time.''
</P>
<P>
   A phone call would be catastrophe, Looker knew. His family was
back home in Washington state, three hours behind Foxborough time,
``and I knew if anybody called that early in the morning, it
wouldn't be anybody from the Left Coast,'' said Looker. ``It was
5:30 in the morning back there.''
</P>
<P>
   A phone call could only be bad news. A phone call would bring a
voice from Foxboro Stadium with instructions to bring his playbook
with him for a meeting with the coach.
</P>
<P>
   So Looker stared at the phone for nearly three hours. His wife
was with him, and she was scheduled to leave for home that night.
If the phone rang, Looker might be on the plane with her. Or on
another plane headed in another direction to another football team
where he would have to start all over. Already this summer, Looker
had had to start twice, first in St. Louis with the Rams and then
in New England with the Patriots.
</P>
<P>
   ``A couple of times,'' said Looker, ``I thought I heard phantom
phone rings.''
</P>
<P>
   But the phone never rang. And, around noon, as anxious rookies
arrived at Foxboro Stadium, glancing at other anxious rookies,
Looker finally learned his fate.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think it really hit me that I'd made it until later in
the day,'' said the rookie. ``When you're around here, there are a
lot of guys who didn't make it, and you don't want to show any
emotions to make them feel bad. I finally took it in when I was
back with my wife at the End Zone Motel.''
</P>
<P>
   Looker recalled thinking, ``Finally. It seems like the longest
half a year in my life was finally over. Finally, it came to a
climax, and it was an amazing feeling.''
</P>
<P>
   Lonie Paxton had a different reaction Sunday morning. Paxton is
a rookie long snapper from Sacramento State, and the combination of
``rookie'' and ``long snapper'' and ``Sacramento State'' put him
foremost on the list of the NFL's Most Endangered Species. Usually,
long snappers are grizzled veterans who not only snap the ball on
punts and kicks but can play some other position in a pinch.
</P>
<P>
   Paxton is a long snapper. Period.
</P>
<P>
   He is a very good long snapper, one who sends laser beams back
to the punter or holder, snaps so crisp and sharp that Patriot
kicker Adam Vinatieri senses that he gets off his kicks a crucial
fraction of a second quicker than in previous years ``because Lonie
gets the ball back there so fast.''
</P>
<P>
   Last Sunday morning, Paxton recalled, he was not worried. ``This
was already a dream come true for me, just to be with an NFL team
in camp,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Back on draft day in April, when Paxton had a backyard barbecue
to watch the draft, Paxton and his father cried when the phone call
came from New England and he was told that the Patriots wanted to
sign him as an undrafted free agent.
</P>
<P>
   Were there calls from other teams?
</P>
<P>
   ``One was enough,'' said Paxton. ``I didn't want any more. One
call _ the Patriots _ that was enough for me.''
</P>
<P>
   Paxton said he decided to take Sunday morning ``hour by hour''
as he awaited his fate. ``It wouldn't have hurt my feelings too bad
because it's all been pleasant feelings just being here,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Still, his dream was so close.
</P>
<P>
   And when Paxton arrived at the stadium, he still didn't know. So
the rookie went to a team meeting and found out.
</P>
<P>
   ``I guess anybody who was left in there at the meeting,'' said
Paxton, ``was left in there. And then I went to our (special teams)
meeting and they told me, `Congratulations.' So I figured that was
it.''
</P>
<P>
   Quarterback Tom Brady already had seen big-time football, having
played in college at Michigan, with 107,000 fans watching his every
pass at Ann Arbor. But last Sunday morning, Brady found himself
with a group of anxious rookies, few of whom knew whether they were
staying or going.
</P>
<P>
   ``But I really wasn't nervous,'' said Brady, even though the
Patriots clearly had three quarterbacks already in front of him.
``The approach I took was that I had the ability to play in the
NFL, and hopefully my coaches had seen it. And hopefully I would
make it. And if they didn't want me, I would go somewhere else and
play football. That's because I'm confident in what I can do.''
</P>
<P>
   Brady, like the other rookies, found out at noon that he had
made the team. Once again, Brady's emotions were different from
those of some other rookies.
</P>
<P>
   ``I remember thinking this wasn't the end but the beginning,''
he said. ``Just because I made the team is no guarantee that I'll
be here next week. I have to go out and earn my keep every day.''
</P>
<P>
   Shockmain Davis, a rookie free agent like Looker, spent Sunday
morning wondering ``if I was going to have to go somewhere and
start all over again. I didn't want to do that.''
</P>
<P>
   Davis admittedly was nervous but steeled himself to come to the
stadium ``and take the news as best as possible.'' On one hand,
said the wide receiver, ``I knew I couldn't worry about it too much
because things happen. So I just tried to prepare myself for the
situation.''
</P>
<P>
   And, at noon, Davis learned he had made the Patriots, learning
the best of news ``when the coaches didn't call me in. If the
coaches called you in, that means you was done. If the coaches
didn't call you in, that was good.''

$600,000 LIFESTYLE WON'T COME AUTOMATICALLY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By KENNETH HOOKER  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Q. My goal is to retire at 60 at a level somewhat equal to the
lifestyle we are accustomed to.
</P>
<P>
   W.K., Weston, Conn. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. Yours is not all that different from most other people's
problems _ if I just divide everything by 10, I'm in familiar
territory. As the blues singer Big Bill Broonzy used to say,
retiring on your current savings with no impact on your lifestyle
is just a dream, just a dream you've got on your mind.
</P>
<P>
   Let's start with the budget and inflation. In six years, you
will need $737,553 to buy what $600,000 buys today, provided
inflation averages 3.5 percent annually. That means you would have
to draw $657,553 from your investments, which currently total
$3,567,500. If your portfolio averages 10 percent growth in the
next six years, it would reach $6,483,668 _ meaning you would have
to achieve returns slightly in excess of 10 percent. (That
calculation presumes reinvestment of dividends from your taxable
portfolio.) Even if your investment portfolio could reach that
$6.48 million level, it's unlikely it could do anything to protect
you against inflation in your later years.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, this doesn't include any portfolio additions in the
next six years. If you were to add $10,000 a month, the portfolio
would reach $7,464,750 _ again, not enough to prudently support
withdrawals at the level you seek. (You could withdraw $54,796 a
month, and the pool would last nearly 30 years, presuming overall
investment returns of 8 percent, but that ignores the fact that
after 10 years of your retirement, you will need $1,040,391 a year
to maintain your current $600,000 lifestyle.
</P>
<P>
   There are a lot of things you can do, of course. The primary one
is to save as much as possible while you are working. Next comes
reducing your expectations. Third would be to get a financial
adviser to come up with specific plans and realistic income
projections, and to diversify more broadly your portfolio, which is
dominated by large-cap stocks _ unless your common stock portfolio
varies substantially from your tax-deferred positions. Finally,
despite your substantial wealth, you should begin establishing a
fixed-income portfolio that can predictably deliver some of the
substantial cash you will require.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. I'd like to have $40,000 to supplement Social Security, plus
have a portion of my investment provide growth potential. My funds
are currently with Vanguard.
</P>
<P>
   R.B., Payson, Ariz. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. If your money is in one of Vanguard's money market funds, you
are already getting the desired income stream, although not much in
the way of growth. If I had to stick with Vanguard, I'd put a
quarter of the money into Vanguard GNMA, currently yielding 6.85
percent, and the rest in Vanguard Balanced Index, with a 3.14
percent yield.
</P>
<P>
   The latter fund holds 58 percent of its portfolio in stocks,
indexed in an effort to match the results of the Wilshire 5000
Index, the broadest index of stocks in captivity, roughly
equivalent to the stock market as a whole. But like most broad
indexes, it's dominated by large-cap stocks.
</P>
<P>
   It should certainly provide plenty of long-term growth, though,
and combined with the GNMA position, the investment in Vanguard
Balanced Index would yield $40,675 a year. You could then reinvest
any capital gains.
</P>
<P>
   If you're not limited to Vanguard, go with a five-year jumbo CD
for that first $250,000. The current national high rate is 7.81
percent, which would mean a difference of $2,400 a year on a
$250,000 investment, compared to Vanguard GNMA.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. I have been talking to a few people about switching to a Roth
IRA. Some say I can take the money out after five years without tax
or penalty. Others told me it is better to leave it alone, because
the tax and penalty would reduce my current account by about half.
I am not thinking of touching this account until I retire. What
should do?
</P>
<P>
   H.T., San Diego &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. The answer requires answers to other questions. First, let me
clear up some confusion. It is true that both the principal in a
Roth IRA and any earnings can be withdrawn tax-free at the option
of the owner. But this can be done without penalty only after the
owner has reached age 59 1/2 or has held the money being withdrawn
in the account for five years _ whichever comes second. Thus a
person of your age could not withdraw the money without penalty at
age 40, nor could a person who is aged 59 put money in a Roth IRA
and withdraw it without penalty until age 64.
</P>
<P>
   Second, if you transfer your IRA to a Roth you would pay no
penalty, but would pay taxes owed as if the amount transferred were
earned income. There is no penalty that stems from transferring
from a traditional IRA to a Roth account, unless you made the
unfortunate move of simply withdrawing the funds and then putting
the allowed maximum new contribution (up to $2,000 a year) in a
Roth account. So it's important the transaction be a transfer and
not a withdrawal. You should have no problem, especially if you
simply transfer the funds from one kind of account to the other
within the same institution.
</P>
<P>
   Those matters aside, the first question that arises concerns
your future income. If you think you will be in a lower tax bracket
in retirement than you are now, you would be better off sticking
with the traditional IRA. Conversely, if you are saving
aggressively for retirement and expect to be well fixed at that
point, the Roth will give you a great advantage.
</P>
<P>
   Another question is how you are saving. If you are using
conservative accounts such as bank programs, this will not make a
great deal of difference. But if you have a typical retirement
savings program, relying heavily on stocks, with a few aggressive
investments, the Roth can offer a wonderful advantage. You would
want to put your most aggressive investments _ which are
accordingly the ones upon which you expect the greatest long-term
gains _ in the Roth accounts.
</P>
<P>
   For example, say your retirement savings consist of a core
holding such as a Standard and Poor's Index fund, a balanced fund
that holds stocks and bonds, and two more-aggressive holdings _
let's suppose these include a health care stock fund and a
technology stock fund. Since you can expect these last two to
produce the greatest long-term gains, these are best held in a Roth
account.
</P>
<P>
   Next, if either you or your wife has a 401(k) plan or any other
tax-deferred retirement savings, holding some of your retirement
savings in a Roth IRA will offer you a great deal of flexibility in
managing your taxes in retirement. It's a pool of money you can
keep aside or draw upon without tax consequences, allowing you to
manage your tax-deferred and taxable accounts to best advantage.
</P>
<P>
   Generally, the younger you are and the wealthier you expect to
become, the greater the chances the Roth IRA will work to your
advantage. Moreover, the Roth account offers another protection,
which is that by the time that you are retired, tax rates in
general might be higher than they are now.
</P>
<P>
   You will have to answer these questions for yourself. Bear in
mind that if you use some of the traditional IRA balance to pay the
taxes that are due from the transfer, that amount is treated as a
withdrawal and accordingly is subject to a 10 percent penalty for
premature withdrawal, as well as being subject to tax. You might
decide to budget the transfers over the course of a number of
years, to keep you in the same tax bracket and give you a chance to
earn the money to pay the taxes that result from the transfers.

TIMBERLAND TESTS `COMMUNITY STORE' CONCEPT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)

<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Part social experiment, part listening post, a new
Timberland store in a city neighborhood long avoided by many
mainstream retailers aims to prove that doing well and doing good
are inextricably linked.
</P>
<P>
   At the moment, shopper Greg Gaskins isn't much interested in
social experiments. He's browsing the store for size-15 shoes.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're super comfortable,'' the contract worker says of
Timberland footwear. ``And they're super durable.''
</P>
<P>
   In recent years, black city residents such as Gaskins have
emerged as some of Timberland's best customers.
</P>
<P>
   That came as a bit of a surprise to a New Hampshire company best
known for $145 yellow boots and pricey outdoor gear, but not to
Calvin Johnson, a local businessman who is a part owner of the new
Timberland store.
</P>
<P>
   Neighborhood residents ``want good retail merchandise, not some
garbage,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   It was partly to learn more about the fashion preferences of
urban blacks and partly to advance a do-good social agenda that led
Timberland Co. to test what it calls a ``community store.''
</P>
<P>
   In a formula that may be unique, the store is a three-way
collaboration that teams Timberland with Johnson's company, Urban
Hospitality, which operates an Athlete's Foot store.
</P>
<P>
   The third member of the team is Community Impact, a group that
distributes scholarships to neighborhood students. Plans call for a
permanent profit-sharing arrangement between the store and the
scholarship fund.
</P>
<P>
   Gaskins is more interested in shoes than scholarships at the
moment. What impresses him is Timberland's breadth of selection.
</P>
<P>
   ``They have sizes that fit,'' he marvels.
</P>
<P>
   Buying shoes wasn't always so easy in this part of town. A
decade ago, most neighborhood retailers were ``liquor stores and
Chinese carryouts,'' Johnson says. To buy most things, residents
had to get in a car or get on a bus, and most of the dollars earned
by the community wound up being spent elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
   That's one of the goals of the community store, which opened in
December _ to keep dollars in the neighborhood where the store does
business.
</P>
<P>
   The Washington store is the first to open using the new concept.
Similar stores may soon open in Cleveland and Detroit, and if
Timberland can find the right site and the right local partners,
Boston could see a community store some day.
</P>
<P>
   Over time, Timberland hopes the community-store concept can
evolve into a franchising program.
</P>
<P>
   At first glance, the Washington store seems small and not very
unusual. On the back wall are Timberland boots and casual shoes.
Also on display are the clothing lines that have given the company
a lift at a time when many rivals are struggling.
</P>
<P>
   It's what customers can't see that may make this store unique,
according to the Initiative for Competitive Inner Cities, a
Boston-based group that studies the impact of the retailing
business on poor urban neighborhoods.
</P>
<P>
   With the economy booming, many national chains, especially
pharmacies, have begun to open stores aggressively in Roxbury,
Harlem, and Chicago's South Side, ICIC claims.
</P>
<P>
   The Washington shopping center where the Timberland store opened
may be evidence of this trend. Other tenants include a Safeway
supermarket, a Hollywood Video, and an Athlete's Foot store that
Johnson's company owns.
</P>
<P>
   But if many national chains are coming into the city, Timberland
may be the only retailer so far to set up a permanent
profit-sharing arrangement with the neighborhood it serves.
</P>
<P>
   ``This approach could be unique,'' says ICIC executive vice
president Anne Habiby, who notes that retailers often have been
criticized for taking money out of poor neighborhoods.
</P>
<P>
   ``Doing well by doing good'' is something Timberland has tried
to practice for many of the 48 years the Swartz family has been
associated with it.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm interested in how a business can be a vehicle for social
justice,'' says chief executive Jeffrey B. Swartz, 40, the third
generation of his family to head Timberland.
</P>
<P>
   Although the Swartzes control half its stock, the company has
been traded publicly for nearly 15 years, and social goals have to
be pursued at the same time shareholders are kept happy.
</P>
<P>
   As Jeffrey Swartz sees it, doing well and doing good aren't
competing goals. Rather, when properly linked, they reinforce each
other. The thinking is that some consumers will reward a company
deemed socially responsible by purchasing its products.
</P>
<P>
   Given its modest sales projections, Timberland's community store
is unlikely to have much immediate top-line impact on a company
whose annual sales should exceed $1 billion this year.
</P>
<P>
   Besides making footwear and clothing, Timberland operates 60
full-price stores and 90 outlet stores. In 1999, retail accounted
for a quarter of its $917.2 million in total revenues. The
community store is Timberland's third retail category.
</P>
<P>
   If a community store won't immediately give a major boost to
sales, it still could provide Timberland with something of value _
information about an important group of customers.
</P>
<P>
   By teaming up with a local businessman and by staffing the store
with young people from the neighborhood, Timberland hopes to gain
all sorts of insights into urban black consumers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Make no mistake,'' says Greg Taylor, executive director of
Community Impact. ``Calvin (Johnson) is going to help them learn
about urban (fashion) trends. Calvin is going to give them
information on how to better market to the inner city.''
</P>
<P>
   It was about five years ago that Timberland realized many black
consumers were embracing its boots as a fashion statement, and to
this day Swartz says he still isn't sure why.
</P>
<P>
   Though Timberland sometimes ran ads with such slogans as ``Give
racism the boot'' and though it was an early supporter of City Year
Inc., the self-described ``urban Peace Corps,'' the company never
deliberately set out to woo black consumers.
</P>
<P>
   Rightly or wrongly, Swartz says, Timberland focused on the
quality of its product, figuring that if it made superior footwear,
consumers would respond.
</P>
<P>
   But following a mid-1990s slump, Timberland began paying more
attention to marketing and to its best customers.
</P>
<P>
   Aggressively marketing to urban black consumers could have an
additional payoff. As sneaker-maker Nike Inc. and many others have
learned, black teenagers often start fashion trends. Get young
blacks to wear your products, and affluent young suburbanites
sometimes will follow suit.
</P>
<P>
   Not only has Timberland become more attentive to marketing since
its rare money-losing year in 1995, it also has tried to reposition
itself. Instead of just a bootmaker, it now wants to be seen as a
``global lifestyle brand.''
</P>
<P>
   To that end, Timberland has placed more emphasis on clothing,
which now accounts for about 20 percent of sales.
</P>
<P>
   Recently, Timberland has launched some ``sub-brands.'' One is
Mountain Athletics, which aims at off-road joggers and mountain
bikers. Another new line called Trek Travel targets the growing
segment of consumers who take ``adventure vacations'' such as
African safaris and hikes in the Himalayas.
</P>
<P>
   When companies attempt to reposition themselves or chase fashion
trends, they sometimes leave their customers confused. But
Timberland seems to be managing.
</P>
<P>
   Part of Timberland's recent success is because ``consumers know
what Timberland stands for,'' says Bob McGee, editor of Sporting
Goods Intelligence, an industry newsletter.
</P>
<P>
   Timberland's performance now outpaces an industry that is mostly
seeing 2 percent or 3 percent annual growth. Last year, Timberland
posted 6.4 percent sales growth.
</P>
<P>
   The move toward casual clothing has hurt many midprice shoe
companies, but high-end brands such as Timberland are doing much
better, says William Boettge, president of the National Shoe
Retailers Association.
</P>
<P>
   While others plod along, Timberland's 1999 profits rose 27
percent to $75.25 million. Recent quarterly earnings were even more
impressive.
</P>
<P>
   Such success has given Jeffrey Swartz the opportunity to pursue
his goal of making Timberland an agent for change.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our mission now is to equip people to make a difference in the
world,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   Cynics may sneer that tying a business to a social cause has
become a highly effective marketing technique of late.
</P>
<P>
   Carol Cone won't dispute that. Her firm, Cone Communications of
Boston, advises clients, including Timberland, on how to practice
so-called cause-related marketing. When so many products seem
similar, cause-related marketing is one way for one company to
stand out from a crowd of me-too rivals, she says.
</P>
<P>
   In recent years, many companies have jumped on the bandwagon,
but Cone says social values were already part of Timberland's
philosophy when she began advising the company in 1981.
</P>
<P>
   ``With a lot of companies, it's `Oh, God, we have to do this
because everyone else is doing it,' '' Cone says of cause-related
marketing. ``With Timberland, it's in the corporate DNA.''
</P>
<P>
   City Year can attest to Timberland's long involvement with
social issues. In 1989, few people had ever heard of the group. So
cofounder Alan Khazei concentrated early fund-raising efforts on
Boston companies and didn't expect to get much of a response from
Timberland, which by then was based in Stratham, N.H.
</P>
<P>
   To Khazei's surprise, Timberland instantly agreed to supply City
Year with work boots. True, Timberland has Boston roots. Previously
known as Abington Shoe Co., it made shoes in the South End before
moving to New Hampshire in 1969.
</P>
<P>
   But Khazei says he thinks one reason for Timberland's immediate
generosity was that Swartz was so receptive to City Year's message
of community service.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was like pushing on an open door,'' Khazei says.
</P>
<P>
   Over the years, he says, Timberland has given City Year about
$10 million in either cash or product donations, making Timberland
the group's largest private contributor, and Swartz now chairs City
Year's board of trustees.
</P>
<P>
   Timberland's contributions to City Year soon could get larger.
Last year in Philadelphia, Timberland debuted a special edition of
its yellow boot in City Year's signature red color. The ``Red Boot
Collection,'' which includes some apparel offerings, soon will roll
out in selected urban markets. Khazei says a portion of the profits
from the Red Boot Collection will be shared with City Year.
</P>
<P>
   As Khazei notes, the Swartz family likes to sum up its three
generations at Timberland with the phrase, ``Boot, brand, belief.''
</P>
<P>
   Nathan Swartz was responsible for the famous Timberland boot.
Son Sidney W. Swartz made the boot into a brand. And now it's up to
grandson Jeffrey B. Swartz to deliver on the belief that a business
can be a force for social change.
</P>
<P>
   Timberland's latest effort at social change is the community
store in Washington. To be successful, it must be a win-win for all
three members of the team behind it _ Timberland, Johnson, and
Community Impact. Take profits out of the equation, and the
ambitious social goals that ride on the store cannot be attained,
team members stress.
</P>
<P>
   At ICIC, Habiby knows what a valuable asset a healthy retailer
can be to a poor city neighborhood.
</P>
<P>
   ``Retail is the first visible sign that a neighborhood is
connected to the rest of the economy,'' she says.
</P>
<P>
   To Timberland, retail means more.
</P>
<P>
   Says Swartz, ``We think a store can be a tool for social
engineering.''

 IN THE CLUBHOUSE, HE'S THE CLEANUP MAN  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By NATHAN COBB  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOWELL, Mass. _ Had Andrew ``Woody'' Wittman's summer job been
advertised, the pitch might have gone like this:
</P>
<P>
   ``Work from early June to Labor Day washing uniforms, organizing
sports equipment, preparing food, running errands, etc.
Fourteen-hour workdays common. Total of three days off. Lots of bus
travel. Pay: about $8 per hour.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd heard about Clubbies, but I didn't know what they did,''
muses the 21-year-old senior at the State University of New York at
Albany. ``I didn't know about the hours, that's for damn sure. I
think they made certain not to tell me about the hours.'' Then he
smiles an I'm-a-little-wiser-now smile.
</P>
<P>
   Woody Wittman is serving his first and perhaps last season as
clubhouse manager of the Lowell Spinners, the popular (33 straight
sell-outs) ``short season-A'' affiliate of
</P>
<P>
   the Red Sox that plays in sweet little Edward A. LeLacheur Park,
hard by the Merrimack River. As the team's Clubbie, he does
everything from washing seven or so loads of laundry a day _ each
player has a home, away, and practice ``uni'' _ to making sure no
one runs short of sunflower seeds on which to munch during games.
</P>
<P>
   It was not how he planned to spend his summer. A political
science major who was raised in Middletown, N.Y., in a family of
Yankees worshipers, Wittman had only vague job plans when he was
approached in late April about the position via a circuitous
connection to Spinners trainer Keith Johnson. A little more than a
month later, he found himself tending to the needs of a couple
dozen entry-level professionals, ages 19 to 23, young men not too
different from himself who don't have major-league egos and
probably never will: Of the 141 players who performed for Lowell in
the four seasons prior to this one, only two have made it briefly
to the Red Sox, and both _ Wilton Veras and Steve Lomasney _ are
back in the minors.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's exciting here because we're contending for a pennant,''
Wittman says of life among the Spinners, who were one and a half
games out of first place in the McNamara Division of the New
York-Pennsylvania League going into Tuesday night's game. ``But I'd
like to get back to my girlfriend and my friends. This work wears
on me, it really does.''
</P>
<P>
   He literally eats and sleeps the job, dining and living like the
players themselves on the neighboring campus of the University of
Massachusetts at Lowell. His office is the team's equipment room, a
windowless rectangle tucked beneath the grandstand and packed with,
among many other things, washers, dryers, bats, baseballs,
oversized coolers filled with thirst quenchers, and brightly
colored Canaligator outfits worn by the team's mascot. ``It's my
palace,'' Wittman says of the cluttered room, flashing a wry smile
again.
</P>
<P>
   Being a Clubbie is something of an entrepreneurial gig. Wittman
is paid $500 a month by the Spinners' front office, but himself
collects two dollars per day from each player and coach, who are
Red Sox employees. He also operates the soda machines in both the
home and visiting teams' clubhouses _ charging the out-of-towners
25 cents more per can than the locals _ and reaps their profits. He
figures to gross something over $7,000 this summer, or about $2,300
per month and around $8 per hour. (Spinners players earn only $850
per month.) Since there's little time or opportunity to spend this
stash _ and since he receives free room and board both in Lowell
and on the road _ Wittman will take most of it home come Labor Day.
``Maybe I'll open an IRA,'' he says, and he's serious.
</P>
<P>
   But he'll earn it. Arnold Beyeler, the 36-year-old manager of
the Spinners who never saw the big leagues as a player but has
observed a Clubbie or two in his career, defines Wittman's job in
simple terms: ``You want someone who's always around when you need
him and gets the unis dry.'' Then he adds: ``Woody does a good
job.''
</P>
<P>
   On days in which the Spinners play at home, doing a good job
means piloting his vaguely maroon 1987 Buick Century 18 miles north
to BJ's Wholesale Club in Nashua, N.H. It is there that Wittman
purchases the all-important ``Spread,'' i.e. the
post-batting-practice clubhouse repast he prepares for Spinners
players and coaches. ``This is my twenty-third trip here,'' he
declares at BJ's on a recent Saturday afternoon as he fills his
grocery cart with $38.10 worth of white and wheat bread, chunky
peanut butter, Concord grape jelly, tortilla chips, salsa, babycut
carrots, veggie dip, and oranges. If his selection seems rather,
well, bush league, remember that his per-game budget is only $50
and that he must have money left over to purchase cold cuts for the
coaches and manager, whose status has earned them something a tad
better than PB&AMP;J. Remember, too, that the players, who tend to
approach the Spread as first-graders might a birthday buffet, seem
not to mind at all.
</P>
<P>
   ``Food preparation is something else they didn't tell me
about,'' Wittman says as he motors back to Lowell and looks forward
to laying out his purchases.
</P>
<P>
   No one warned him about nights like the previous one, either. He
arrived home with the team after an eight-game road trip at 1:30
a.m., washed uniforms and sorted out the equipment room before
going to bed at 6, and awakened at 9. ``I'm beat,'' he says softly
now between yawns. ``I'm not myself.
</P>
<P>
   ``You absolutely have to be organized to do this job,'' he
declares a few minutes later. ``Procrastination will kill you. It's
the difference between getting eight hours' sleep and getting
three.''
</P>
<P>
   Team road trips are his salvation. Hotels take care of the
Spinners' laundry and the Spread is replaced by individual take-out
orders. There's actually time to go out with the boys after a game,
although you should remember that this is a league in which
Burlington, Vt., is considered the hot spot. ``We've got a
four-game series there soon and we're all looking forward to it,''
Wittman says, perking up at the thought.
</P>
<P>
   He's also juiced by the ballgame he's just watched both on the
clubhouse TV and in the runway leading to the Spinners dugout, a
3-2, 10-inning win over the Queens Kings on Lunch Cooler Giveaway
Night. Suddenly he's not so ambivalent about his summer. ``My goal
used to be to go into broadcasting,'' he says as the noisy players
file past him toward the showers. ``But the college I went to
didn't offer the kinds of courses I wanted. So I switched to
political science, and I'm not sure why. But since I got here I've
been thinking about going to grad school in sports management. I'm
thinking I'd like to become a general manager.''
</P>
<P>
   For the moment, however, he's still a Clubbie. Some of the
players may be off to the nearby Brewhouse Cafe &AMP; Grille, but
Wittman has many loads of laundry to go before he sleeps.
(Including, on this night, the other team's uniforms, an unexpected
chore for which the Kings will pay him $50.) He'll probably work
until 3:30 a.m., and then ``If I'm lucky I'll sleep till noon.''
</P>
<P>
   And before he leaves LeLacheur Park in the middle of the night,
Woody the Clubbie will have one more chore. He will arm the
security alarm. After all, he'll be the last one out of the
building.

&HT;     MAN CHARGED IN INSIDER TRADING CASE 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By CHRISTIAN BERTHELSEN  
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ A Silicon Valley man has been charged with
criminal securities fraud and civil insider trading violations. He
was accused of netting nearly $447,000 in illegal profits by buying
options on his company's stock after learning it had won a
lucrative contract to work on Microsoft's new video game console.
</P>
<P>
   Manu B. Shrivastava, 31, of San Jose was arrested at his home
Tuesday morning and taken before U.S. Magistrate Judge Joseph
Spero, who released him on $500,000 bond.
</P>
<P>
   Federal authorities say an indictment must be filed in the case
by Sept. 12, at which point he would enter a plea in the case.
</P>
<P>
   There was no immediate comment from Shrivastava's lawyer.
</P>
<P>
   Shrivastava was an engineer at nVidia, a Santa Clara-based
developer and marketer of computer graphics components. The
corporation's president and chief executive, Jen-Hsun Huang, sent
out a companywide e-mail to 400 employees March 5 informing them
the company had won a contract to design and manufacture computer
graphics and multimedia images for Microsoft's new video game
console, the X-Box.
</P>
<P>
   The e-mail message said the contract could generate about $2
billion in sales over 5 years.
</P>
<P>
   The following day, nVidia's vice president of marketing sent a
subsequent e-mail to the entire staff, entitled ``xbox shhhhhh,''
telling them that news of the X-Box contract should be kept
confidential.
</P>
<P>
   Authorities' eyebrows were raised by the wide dissemination of
the sensitive insider information. Generally, the problem occurs
with smaller companies that are about to go public, where
information is more free-flowing throughout the company. But
businesses that are becoming publicly traded companies are advised
by their attorneys to be much more conservative in disseminating
insider news.
</P>
<P>
   ``While you want to retain that corporate culture, you want to
keep from disseminating that kind of information on a broad
basis,'' said Jorge del Calvo, a partner with the law firm
Pillsbury, Madison &AMP; Sutro, which advises corporate clients on how
to handle insider information.
</P>
<P>
   ``The risk that the information will leak exponentially
increases with each person you add to the list.'' Investor
confidence in companies, del Calvo pointed out, can be undermined
when they see stock prices moving up before company information is
publicly announced.
</P>
<P>
   According to a civil filing by the Securities and Exchange
Commission and an affidavit by an FBI agent, Shrivastava then
logged on to his on-line brokerage account and used it to begin
assembling 100 call options on nVidia stock, worth a total of
$30,825. By the time news of the contract was officially announced
by the two companies March 10, Shrivastava had sold all of the
options contracts, realizing net profits of $446,724, according to
the filings.
</P>
<P>
   Leslie Caldwell, the head of the securities fraud division at
the U.S. attorney's office, said Shrivastava had made no effort to
conceal his identity in making the trades, logging on to his
brokerage account and buying the options in his own name.
</P>
<P>
   Officials at nVidia said Shrivastava had been fired in early
August when the matter came to their attention. They said
Shrivastava had signed an agreement that generally prohibited
trading on insider information and specifically barred buying
options on the company's own stock.
</P>
<P>
   They said Shrivastava was the only employee at the company who
had come under the scrutiny of securities regulators. The SEC said
its investigation was continuing.

 MORMONS TO OPEN THEIR 100TH TEMPLE

<TEXT>
<P>
   SALT LAKE CITY _ The 90-year-old Mormon prophet looks out over
his religious statuary, past the six-towered Gothic temple and
beyond the Wasatch Mountains, and in his mind's eye sees a rocky
hilltop in Belmont, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   Upon that hill is the realization of a Mormon dream. The world's
100th Mormon temple, a hulking rectangle of white Sardinian
granite, looms above Route 2, fulfilling Gordon B. Hinckley's goal
of having a century of temples in this first year of the
millennium.
</P>
<P>
   Hinckley, a compact, energetic man who enjoys enormous
popularity among Mormons, calls the temple ``a reminder to the
world.'' It stands as evidence of a new aggressiveness by a faith
that sees itself as a religion of the future.
</P>
<P>
   The Mormons have dramatically accelerated their pace of building
temples and winning converts; after taking 170 years to build the
first 55 temples, the church opened another 45 in just the last two
years, and at a time when some mainstream churches are losing
members, the Mormons now boast 11 million adherents, up from 1
million a half-century ago.
</P>
<P>
   For a church that has been persecuted ever since 14-year-old
Joseph Smith said that God and Jesus appeared to him in the woods
of western New York in 1820, the Belmont temple is a victory. The
70,000-square-foot structure sits just up the hill from where the
first Mormon meetinghouse in Belmont was destroyed in an apparent
arson in 1984, and it has opened despite ongoing legal battles that
have prevented the erection of the spire with a gold-leafed statue
of the angel Moroni that tops every other Mormon temple.
</P>
<P>
   The Belmont temple is also a homecoming for a church whose
founding leaders _ Smith and Brigham Young _ came from Vermont, but
which had almost no presence in New England for its first 90 years,
when converts were encouraged to move to Utah. The president of the
Belmont temple, Loren Dunn, recalls being in Boston as a college
student in the 1960s when there were more Catholics in the
Archdiocese of Boston than Mormons in the world.
</P>
<P>
   ``The church started here, but went away, and was not very large
in New England for a long time,'' said Kim B. Clark of Belmont, one
of the world's most prominent Mormons as the dean of Harvard
Business School and a candidate to be the next president of Harvard
University. Clark traces his own ancestry to the Bunker family, for
whom Bunker Hill is named.
</P>
<P>
   The two legal battles being waged against the Belmont temple by
a handful of neighbors have significant implications: At stake is
how much power, if any, cities and towns should have over the size
and design of religious and educational buildings.
</P>
<P>
   But with the temple opening this week for a month-long open
house, the building takes on new importance as the local heart of
the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, as the Mormons are
formally known.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mormonism is now a worshiping community that can make itself
established, if not fully at home, in any culture, and that is a
dramatic transformation from a community that was embedded in the
inner mountain West,'' said Jan Shipps, an expert on Mormonism at
Indiana University.
</P>
<P>
   Being at home here means winning converts. In Massachusetts,
there are now about 16,000 Mormons, a small group in a state of 6
million, but a church whose size has tripled over the last
quarter-century while many other faiths have seen numbers dwindle.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our mission has always been to the world, but we haven't made
the kind of progress that we're making now,'' Hinckley said. ``Our
numbers are moving upward _ we're nearly 11 million strong now _
and that will continue. There is no doubt in my mind at all
concerning that.''
</P>
<P>
   In Boston and around the world, Mormons pose a challenge to
Catholics and Protestants with their success at evangelization. The
church's missionaries have been highly visible in the neighborhoods
of Boston most populated by immigrants and ethnic minorities, as
well as in the Belmont area.
</P>
<P>
   ``They've been canvassing the area _ visiting every home,'' said
the Rev. James E. O'Leary of Saint Camillus Catholic Church in
Arlington, across the street from the Mormon temple.
</P>
<P>
   Hinckley, who as president of the Mormon church is revered as
prophet, seer, and revelator by Mormons, said that New England
isn't the strongest growth area of the church _ that would probably
be Mexico and other parts of Latin America _ but that the church is
making progress here. And Hinckley is unapologetic for his church's
zealous missionary efforts or its highly visible temple sites.
Belmont Hill is the second highest point inside Route 128; and in
Washington, D.C., a gigantic temple looms over the Capital Beltway,
Interstate 495.
</P>
<P>
   Hinckley has his own strong connection to Massachusetts. He
traces his ancestry to Thomas Hinckley, who was the last governor
of Plymouth Colony. And there are parallels between the two men's
lives: Governor Hinckley was a member of a controversial religious
group, the Puritans, which fled persecution in England, and he was
an eager evangelist, in his case spreading the Christian gospel to
American Indians.
</P>
<P>
   For years, persecution of Mormons was driven in part by their
beliefs about the nature of God, which differ significantly from
other Christians, and in part by their support for polygamy, which
they renounced in 1890. Smith was murdered by an anti-Mormon mob in
Illinois in 1844. Two years later, his followers, led by Young,
began to flee the United States for a territory that has since
become Utah.
</P>
<P>
   Though the days of persecution are over, the church is often
criticized from the left for its political views and from the right
for its theological views. Evangelical Christians, competitors in
the marketplace of missoinary work, have been particularly
outspoken; the Promise Keepers, a national movement of Christian
men rallying in Worcester this weekend, refuse to allow Mormons to
speak at their events, declaring that ``the beliefs of the Mormon
Church are inconsistent with historic, orthodox Christianity.''
</P>
<P>
   The church is so sensitive to criticism that at its Sunday
worship services, called sacrament meetings, speakers conclude
their remarks by saying ``I know this church is true. I know Gordon
Hinckley is a prophet of the Lord.''
</P>
<P>
   That sense of truth is particularly evident at temples, which,
unlike churches and synagogues, are not halls of communal worship
but a collection of small rooms used for the personal rituals
Mormons believe are essential for salvation. The open house in
Belmont provides a rare opportunity for the public to see the
spaces used for ceremonies that have long been secret. Once
dedicated, the temple will be closed forever to all but observant
Mormons whose moral conduct, as well as spiritual and financial
fealty, has been verified by a local bishop.
</P>
<P>
   The temple rituals include baptism, marriage, and a rite Mormons
call ``endowment,'' which entails receiving instruction in Mormon
beliefs, making promises about conduct, and a ceremony of
anointing. Because Mormons believe these rituals are an essential
condition for access to the highest level of heaven, they perform
them not only for themselves, but also vicariously for their
ancestors.
</P>
<P>
   ``The experience of going to the temple . . . helps you anchor
your life,'' said Michael D. Schetzel, the director of sales for
the Red Sox. ``It drives home your beliefs and your values, and to
have that experience more frequently makes your life a little
better.''
</P>
<P>
   At Mormon weddings inside the temple, vows do not include the
words ``till death do us part,'' because Mormons believe marriages
continue in the afterlife.
</P>
<P>
   ``This marriage service will ensure that not only will my
husband and I be together after death, but our children will also
be able to be with us,'' said Josephine Nielsen, 25, of Hingham,
who expects to be the first bride married in the temple when she
weds Robert Pepe, 25, of Washington, D.C., just after the Oct. 1
dedication.
</P>
<P>
   The temples also seal relationships between parents and
children. Teresa Meredith, 43, of Acton, used a ceremony at a
temple in Spokane, Wash., to seal her relationship with a child who
died in infancy.
</P>
<P>
   ``Just to know that he will be forever a part of our family, and
we'll be able to raise him again, it gave us a peace that I don't
know we would have had otherwise,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Local Mormons, who have had to travel long distances to
participate in a temple ceremony, are eagerly awaiting the Belmont
temple's opening.
</P>
<P>
   ``It feels great to have a temple closer to home,'' said Mitt
Romney, the Belmont Republican who ran for Senate in 1994 and is
now heading the Salt Lake City organizing committee for the 2002
winter Olympics. ``It makes you feel proud that the membership of
the church has grown large enough to merit a temple being
constructed so close.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   Millennium Pharmaceuticals Inc., the Cambridge, Mass.
biotechnology company that specializes in gene-based drug
discovery, has a staggering 1,500 applications pending at the US
Patent and Trademark Office.
</P>
<P>
   Even if only 40 percent of those applications are granted _ the
current success rate for the biotech industry _ the company will
more than quadruple its portfolio of 135 patents. And Millennium is
just one of many biotech companies rushing to nail down patents in
ever-increasing numbers.
</P>
<P>
   The number of biotech patent applications nationally increased
15 percent last year to more than 20,000, according to the patent
office. It is expected to jump another 25 percent this year,
outpacing even the Internet and computer industry patent
applications, which have exploded in recent years. And despite this
year's addition of 80 examiners, the patent office's biotech
division just barely kept up with the workload.
</P>
<P>
   The rise in patents can be explained, in part, by the
unprecedented growth in the understanding of human biology and,
more specifically, of the human genetic code. Scientists are making
discoveries in record numbers. And more discoveries obviously mean
more patents.
</P>
<P>
   But industry professionals say there are business reasons as
well. For biotech companies, they say, patents are capital. More
than 1,300 companies are now competing to identify genes and
proteins, cure cancer and other diseases, and develop ways to speed
that research. Most aren't profitable for years. Some may never be.
So at the very least, investors want to know that the research and
the money they are pouring into it is protected by patents.
</P>
<P>
   ``We do not do a deal before we look closely at the intellectual
property,'' said Michael Carusi, general partner of Advanced
Technology Ventures, a Waltham venture capital firm. ``To me, this
is the fundamental difference between health care and some Internet
business models, even between biotechnology and some other areas of
health care.''
</P>
<P>
   Often before a company gets started, it has patents, Carusi
said. Carusi is currently investigating the patent position of a
company that doesn't even have employees. Everyone, he said, wants
to be sure that the patents don't infringe on other existing
patents and that they would be defensible in court.
</P>
<P>
   The law allows anyone who invents or discovers ``a new and
useful process, machine, manufacture, or composition of matter'' to
get a patent. Processes used in making a drug as well as its
chemical recipe can be patented. But anything found in nature, such
as an element of the periodic table, can not. Gene patent holders
avoid that prohibition because genes must be isolated, cloned or
otherwise changed to be studied. And in the eyes of the law, once
genes have been manipulated, they are no longer in their natural
state.
</P>
<P>
   To get a patent, the applicant must also prove that the
invention or discovery is new and that it has a ``specific,
substantial and credible'' use. Once a patent is granted, it gives
its owner exclusive commercial rights to the invention or discovery
for 20 years from the date of the application.
</P>
<P>
   Jack Douglas, general counsel at Millennium, said patent
position is crucial for companies, whether they are large or small,
new or established. Companies devote years of work and millions of
dollars to develop potentially valuable cures. Without the patent
protection, he said, companies couldn't possibly recoup their
investments.
</P>
<P>
   ``Patents provide the incentive,'' Douglas said. ``They promise
a company a period of exclusivity, and without it companies
wouldn't make the investment. There's still healthy competition,
and it's resulting in companies investing a lot of resources in
what we all hope will be cures for diseases.''
</P>
<P>
   Douglas said Millennium patents genes the company identifies as
well as its discoveries about the functions of genes in disease. It
also patents small fragments of genes, known as expressed sequence
tags, in hopes they will help identify genetic variations that make
a person susceptible to disease.
</P>
<P>
   He recognizes, however, that there is still a lot of uncertainty
about how some patents will stand up legally over time. Early gene
patents allowed companies to lay claim to future uses the company
didn't even know the gene had. Some hope that by patenting a piece
of a gene they will gain the rights to entire gene. And while the
patent office has raised its requirements, questions remain about
how far-reaching future patents will be.
</P>
<P>
   The issue troubles Dr. Aubrey Milunsky, director of the Center
for Human Genetics at the Boston University School of Medicine. The
BU lab already pays licensing fees to gene patent holders when
running certain diagnostic tests for patients. Now, he said,
companies like Celera Genomics Corp., which recently decoded the
human genome, want to patent thousands of genes without knowing
much about them.
</P>
<P>
   ``By doing so, they would ultimately exclude someone else from
working on that gene,'' Milunsky said.
</P>
<P>
   Douglas and others in the biotech industry disagree. They argue
that patents actually promote the free exchange of science.
Applications require the filer to explain the invention or
discovery in enough detail that it can be replicated. Researchers
are free to use the information as long as they don't profit from
it.
</P>
<P>
   The system also encourages companies to stake out different
areas of science, they say, ensuring a diversity of research that
will lead to more discoveries and more medical advances. And with
an estimated 120,000 genes and many more proteins, there is plenty
of work to be done, they argue.
</P>
<P>
   Gene patent filings are growing even faster than patent
applications for the biotech industry as a whole, said John Doll,
who head the patent office's biotechnology division. He estimates
the number of gene applications will grow by a third this year and
expects the rate to accelerate in coming years.
</P>
<P>
   ``Anytime you have an emerging technology and new discoveries in
the emerging area, the patents tend to be broad because there is
nothing known about that area,'' Doll said. He said the first
patent in biotechnology ``was very, very broad. But it didn't stop
the technology. It allowed others to look at it and move it
forward.''
</P>
<P>
   Alan Watson, senior vice president of corporate development at
Cubist Pharmaceuticals Inc., a Cambridge biotech company, believes
many of these issues will eventually be resolved in court. In the
meantime, companies are protecting a single product with multiple
patents and using a variety of strategies.
</P>
<P>
   Patents are expensive, however, so most companies don't file
applications indiscriminately. Fees run about $700 to apply,
another $1,200 when the patent is issued and $5,600 more to
maintain the patent during its 20-year lifespan. Cubist has 133
patents in its portfolio and has filed applications for another 40
in the last two years.
</P>
<P>
   ``You start as broadly as you can,'' Watson said. ``As the
research narrows, you narrow your patent coverage and close in
around a product. As the science and the industry matures, you'll
start to see more specificity and more narrow claims. Right now,
it's like a lot of little insurance policies.''
</P>
<P>
   Most companies say they aren't trying to squeeze out the
competition. They are just trying to claim what competitive
advantages they can to survive and stay healthy. And patents are
the way to do that.
</P>
<P>
   Gregory Williams, general counsel for New England Biolabs Inc.,
said that is true even for established biotech companies. The
Beverly, Mass. company has been in business for 25 years and
supplies other biotech companies with research tools, primarily
enzymes that scientists use to isolate and cut up segments of DNA.
</P>
<P>
   The company holds 88 patents, most of them for the DNA of those
enzymes, and has 23 applications pending. Without patent
protection, competitors could sell those enzymes for less than
Biolabs could because the competitors didn't invest the money to
discover them.
</P>
<P>
   Biolabs' patent portfolio has also aided partnerships with
companies interested in developing therapies or diagnostic tests
using the company's discoveries and technologies. Patents can
encourage cooperation between competitors, Wiliams said, giving
companies the incentive to trade information in ways that will
enhance their businesses and their research.
</P>
<P>
   ``Technology feeds on itself,'' Williams said. ``As the level of
technology and the level of skill is raised, it opens more doors. I
don't see it slowing down any time soon.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   BOMBAY, India _ Maqbool Ahmed has dreams of instant wealth,
which ordinarily would require a mighty burst of imagination from a
man living in the Bombay slum of Geeta Nagar, a hideous warren of
hovels where the air reeks of kerosene and fish, and there are only
24 toilets for 6,000 people.
</P>
<P>
   But come 9 p.m., Mondays through Thursdays, Ahmed, like
virtually everyone else in this monsoon-swamped ghetto, ignores the
leaky roof, turns on a cheap black-and-white television and watches
the Indian version of ``Who Wants to Be a Millionaire''
</P>
<P>
   ``Even I know Josip Broz Tito was not the leader of Egypt,''
Ahmed said confidently last night, harrumphing at a confused
contestant named Ravi who must have slept through the Cold War and
was now using a valuable ``lifeline'' to phone his friend Murli for
help. ``The correct answer is Yugoslavia.''
</P>
<P>
   Since early July, India _ a nation where the average person
would need 2,325 years of income to become a millionaire _ has been
obsessed with ``Kaun Banega Crorepati,'' the Indian version of the
game show created in Britain and now exported to 31 countries
including the United States, Japan, Israel, Finland and Argentina.
</P>
<P>
   East is East and West is West, and this is where the twain have
met.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everyone understands the language of money,'' said Ahmed, 41,
who peddles envelopes from a pushcart for a living. ``The show is
simple to follow. I am not so smart, and I know many of the
answers. Maybe I will be a millionaire.''
</P>
<P>
   The show is unusual here because of its extravagant production
quality and the large jackpot. Crore is a number meaning 10
million. A crorepati, then, is actually someone with 10 million
rupees _ about $222,000 at current exchange rates.
</P>
<P>
   Ratings are as yet an inexact science in India, but by some
counts ``Crorepati'' is being watched nightly by more than 100
million people. In a single leap it took Star TV, owned by Rupert
Murdoch, from the No. 3 to the No. 1 spot among the nation's cable
channels.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have 85 percent of the viewers in Bombay and 93 percent in
Kanpur,'' said Sameer Nair, who is in charge of the network's
programming. ``Of course, the joke is: what are those other 7
percent up to?''
</P>
<P>
   This can be a tough country for television. In 1965, when in
America Ozzie and Harriet were starting their last season, there
were still fewer than 1,000 television sets in all of India. Even
today, only about one-third of the households have televisions _
and less than half of those are set up for cable or satellite
reception.
</P>
<P>
   India's population has topped 1 billion, but the nation is a
polyglot of 17 major languages. Most people in Calcutta do not know
what the people in Madras are saying. ``The Wheel of Fortune'' was
tried without much success.
</P>
<P>
   ``India has no national language and has a low level of
literacy; this is not a place for a game like that, based on word
play,'' said Amit Khanna, a television executive.
</P>
<P>
   ``Crorepati'' is in Hindi, with English thrown in here and
there. Its popularity is highest in the nation's so-called Hindi
Belt in the north.
</P>
<P>
   The show is hosted by Amitabh Bachchan, a legendary leading man
in Indian films and now a suave graybeard at age 58. His movie
career had hit the skids, and ``Crorepati'' has become his
resurrection. Contestants occasionally kiss his feet. Fan letters
sometimes come written in blood.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was apprehensive about whether I could deliver the goods,''
Bachchan said in an interview, relaxing in an apartment built for
him near the stage set. It is modeled after a Swiss chalet. ``In
films, people always put words in my mouth. Here, it is a very ad
hoc, ad lib kind of atmosphere.''
</P>
<P>
   Like Regis Philbin, he has become famous for this litany: ``Are
you sure? Confident? Is that your final answer?'' It is presumed
here that this is a Bachchan touch, part of his pose as a
philosopher-guide.
</P>
<P>
   But the ``Millionaire'' format, as created by the British
production company Celador, is highly scripted. It is the fast food
chain of quiz shows.
</P>
<P>
   The patter is precisely pat. The look of each set is identical.
A computer program synchronizes the music and lighting. British
technicians train the local crews.
</P>
<P>
   ``They send us a production bible, about 300 pages,'' said
Ravinath Menon, Crorepati's executive producer. ``It's all a
formula. Our idea was not to re-invent the show, but to duplicate
the show.''
</P>
<P>
   While the Indian masses are wild about the program, some of the
intelligentsia have been sniffy. P.C. Joshi, a retired academic,
said he has an ``instinctive revulsion'' to the show and has
refused to watch it.
</P>
<P>
   In 1985, Joshi headed a national commission that warned that
careful controls must be maintained on television programming or
Indian culture will be befouled.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, such taint came to seem inevitable in the early
'90s when Western tastes began to invade the airwaves via
satellite. Shows such as ``The Bold and the Beautiful'' were
decried for licentious plots dependent on bed-hopping. In time,
however, local producers have developed their own various soap
operas rich with sexual escapades. It turned out that most people
here did not object to shows that depicted adultery, as long as the
adults involved were Indians.
</P>
<P>
   ``Crorepati,'' despite its Western roots, is not seen as an
invasion. ``Money is money, finally, and I think Indians just adore
it and always have,'' said cultural critic Shanta Gokhale. ``We're
inveterate gamblers.''
</P>
<P>
   Rival networks have game shows in the works that will offer
similar amounts.
</P>
<P>
   But being on the show would seem to require far more luck than
is common in Geeta Nagar. People from there do call the show,
trying to register their names. For them, it is like buying a
lottery ticket: an expensive fantasy. Use of the public phone costs
about 50 cents, for many almost an entire day's pay.
</P>
<P>
   Besides, few Muslims or Hindus from the lower castes have made
it on to the show. Those chosen are mostly professionals from big
cities.
</P>
<P>
   ``Only the bureaucrats seem to get to compete,'' Ahmed said
haplessly.

<P>
   Before the end of the summer that never really was, there are at
least a few days left to grab The Oxford American's fourth annual
double issue (July/August) on Southern music before it's pulled
from the shelves.
</P>
<P>
   That's Oxford as in Mississippi, and the subtitle is The
Southern Magazine of Good Writing. And even if it's best known for
its publisher, John Grisham (the magazine is serializing his novel
``A Painted House,'' with Part 4 in this issue), some music lovers
know better. The special issue is a triumph in tone, and there's no
skimping on content: It's 208 pages and comes with a 23-song CD,
``Southern Sampler 2000.''
</P>
<P>
   What resounds here is an unabashed love of music instead of
clinical expertise. There are some lively Q&AMP;As (Sam Phillips, Tom
Petty, and Al Green's collaborator Teenie Hodges are among the
subjects) and two thoughtful remembrances of singer/songwriter Jeff
Buckley, but it's three of the magazine's short opening essays that
set a lasting mood.
</P>
<P>
   The title of editor Marc Smirnoff's piece on compiling the
enclosed CD sums up his strategy: ``More Personal Than
Scientific.'' And though the downside is that the outcome is
lopsidedly white, the upside is that Smirnoff's heart is all over
this thing. He wants you to love the songs he loves. Next, Hal
Crowther writes about a conference of new Southern writers and
Dolly Parton (whose gorgeous bluegrass take on ``Silver Dagger'' is
on the CD), connecting the topics with a sharp eye. ``One of my
litmus tests for Southern authenticity,'' Crowther writes, ``would
be the ability to appreciate the paradox of Dolly Parton: Beneath a
blinding surface of deliberate, exaggerated, self-satirizing
artifice lurks one of the most engagingly authentic individuals in
the Nashville pantheon.''
</P>
<P>
   Elvis biographer and Massachusetts resident Peter Guralnick
movingly recounts how he started writing about the blues. As he
puts it, ``What I was trying to capture . . . was the feeling, not
the technique. I was not trying to provide deconstructive analysis
. . . (but) writing that would bring the reader to the same
appreciation of the subject that I felt, that would in a sense
mimic the same emotions not just that I experienced but that I
believed the musician put into the music in the first place.''
Hear, hear.
</P>
<P>
   The issue is $8.50 or free to new subscribers; call 800-269-6926
or go to www.oxfordamericanmag.com; 10 percent of proceeds from
this issue will go to the Music Maker Relief Foundation, which
``helps support forgotten blues artists by giving them money for
basic living necessities.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Guralnick wrote that he started his work ``when much of this
music was not simply ignored but reviled in the mainstream press.''
That sounds uncannily like Lewis Lapham's criticism about media
coverage of Ralph Nader's presidential campaign in the September
issue of Harper's Magazine.
</P>
<P>
   Lapham, the editor of Harper's, is wise to call his piece an
essay, though part of it is based on an interview with Nader;
Lapham also spends a chunk of a day accompanying the Green Party
candidate to other press appointments. Lapham's heart is out there
throbbing on his sleeve. Big surprise. He holds as one of his
recurring themes that a healthy democracy should be unruly _ the
messier, the better. He doesn't think Nader can win, but he is
wide-eyed about how Nader's candidacy could affect the year's
debate, how the entire process might be more meaningful, and yes,
more sloppy.
</P>
<P>
   Lapham spent June 30 with Nader, the same day The New York Times
published an editorial that called his campaign ``a self-indulgent
exercise'' and said that ``the public deserves to see the
major-party candidates compete on an uncluttered playing field.''
Lapham elaborates, sarcastically, that if Nader ``were a true
gentleman and a real liberal he would stay with the seat belts and
leave the politics to the professionals.'' Nader, reacting to the
editorial, tells Lapham, ``You've got to love these people. . . .
They think the American electoral process is a gated community.''
</P>
<P>
   Nader trots out some compelling stories, attacks the notion that
Gore is an ``outstanding environmentalist,'' and tells Jim Lehrer
that as president he would understand the complicated workings of
government agencies because ``I don't know anybody who has sued
more of them.'' Lapham is at his best here, in a story that calls
on him to report and not just editorialize. He is never going to
get out of the way when he tells a story _ why would he bother
telling it? _ but he does a good job of explaining why he loves the
third-party participation in this race. Lapham paints a picture of
an agitator who speaks to the integrity and intelligence of the
electorate and is ``less interested in the counting of votes than
in the lesson of freedom.'' (For another opinionated stand on the
state of our democracy, check out art critic Dave Hickey's ``A
World Like Santa Barbara'' in the same issue.)
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The cover of October's Psychology Today promises a look at
``Election 2000: Gore &AMP; Bush on the Couch,'' but the story is about
as satisfying as one M&AMP;M. The analysis of the candidates' speeches
is statistically numbing, then the authors advise Gore to ``Stop
talking about the environment _ or start talking in more upbeat
terms about the possibility of change _ if you want to appeal to
the public.'' (Bush, it seems, is more optimistic, and optimism
gets one elected.)
</P>
<P>
   What's more entertaining are interpretations of the candidates'
facial expressions. Gore: ``Eyebrows down show dominance.'' Bush:
``Eyebrows up show submissiveness.'' Also, ``Gore shows
concentration, Bush playfulness.'' There's a funny shot of Bush
with his thumb up, but, as the caption asks, ``Why's his smile
upside down?'' Of Gore, it's wondered, ``Do tight lips mean
tight-lipped?'' His gestures ``reveal him to be more serious,
constrained, controlled, weighty, ponderous, dominant.'' Bush's
``gestures convey that he is less serious, silly, at times
contemptuous, though also open to others.''

<P>
   CAMBRIDGE, Mass. _ Denise Buckley and Jim Ryan were married back
in November, but they spent a recent Saturday walking down the
aisle of St. Peter's Church over and over again, as family and
friends watched from the pews.
</P>
<P>
   The Ryans, it turns out, were reenacting their wedding for a
video that will be distributed around the world to enable
prospective couples to see how the Roman Catholic Church recommends
that a ceremony be performed.
</P>
<P>
   The need for the video, called ``Our Catholic Wedding,'' may
come as a surprise to some, but it seems that few people,
especially in New England, have been paying much attention to the
1969 revision of the wedding rite, a change that followed the
Second Vatican Council.
</P>
<P>
   The reason? Few people who are engaged are willing to break with
tradition on the all-important day by taking their vows in a new,
comparatively untested ceremony. This film _ produced and
distributed by Liturgy Training Publications _ will be the first to
show a complete ceremony conducted according to the revised rite.
</P>
<P>
   The company is under the jurisdiction of the Archdiocese of
Chicago, and it hopes this video will help overcome resistance to
the changes in the ceremony.
</P>
<P>
   ``The video will really be aimed at the bride and groom,'' says
Maria Leonard, executive producer of the film, who was overseeing
operations the day of the filming. ``Our goal is to give a common
vision of the wedding ceremony.''
</P>
<P>
   Surprising as it is, most New England Catholics have never seen
a wedding according to the revised rite, according to Paul Covino ,
a chaplain at the College of the Holy Cross in Worcester who is an
adviser for the film. With no example to guide them, many Catholics
continue to get married in the more traditional, somber ceremonies
that borrow from weddings of the Middle Ages, when marriages sealed
alliances and brides and grooms didn't see each other before they
were hitched.
</P>
<P>
   The revised ceremony is distinctly modern. For the bride, there
is no more hiding in a back room, no more being given away by her
nervous father, and no more symbolic burning of unity candles. Even
the guests participate before and during the ceremony, gathering to
say hello to the bride and groom at the front of the church and
singing during the ceremony.
</P>
<P>
   ``The biggest change was greeting people as they come in. . . .
After all, it is no surprise that Jim and I are getting married, so
why hide in the back?'' asks Denise. When she and Jim got married _
the first time _ they chose to follow the revised ceremony.
</P>
<P>
   Denise works as a financial aid counselor at Harvard Law School
and Jim teaches Spanish at Milton Academy, where they live.
(``We're dorm parents to 40 girls,'' Denise says.) Both grew up in
the area _ Jim, 29, in Dorchester, and Denise, 34, in Waltham. St.
Peter's was, in fact, the Buckleys' church when Denise was growing
up, and she was baptized here, just about the time the changes to
the wedding rite were being written.
</P>
<P>
   Because the Ryans' marriage was performed by the book, the new
one, and because of Denise's work with the Office of Worship,
Liturgy Training Publications asked the Ryans, and many of the
wedding guests, to reenact the ceremony. ``We had experience. We
weren't really acting, but reenacting,'' Denise says. They agreed,
even though it meant 10 hours in wedding dresses, bridesmaids'
gowns, and tuxedos under movie lights in the overheated church.
</P>
<P>
   St. Peter's itself, with its pipe organ and stained glass
windows, was chosen because it had a large open space by the front
doors in which the assembly could gather (and be filmed) as they
came into the church. It also lent solemnity to the proceedings, as
the half-dozen members of the film crew hurried around to ready
shots, moving cameras and sound booms and wires into place before
calling for silence as each scene began.
</P>
<P>
   By volunteering to be in the video, the wedding party and guests
are helping to overcome resistance to the new ceremony, although
many of them did not intially agree with the changes. Patrick
Buckley, Denise's father, was especially wary of alterations in the
wedding processional. Instead of the bride being led up the aisle
and given away by her father, the bride and groom walk with their
parents, and approach the altar together.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't really think it was a good idea, but after the
rehearsal (for the November wedding), I thought it was great.
Especially walking down the aisle with them. That was completely
new to me,'' says Buckley, who has seen four of his five daughters
get married, giving three away in more traditional ceremonies
before Denise became a Ryan.
</P>
<P>
   The wedding rite was rewritten to bring the ceremony more in
line with the teachings of the Roman Catholic Church. This meant
including the church's guests in the ritual as well as the
betrothed, and excluding cultural practices that do not have a
foundation in the church or its teachings. Another major change is
the seating arrangement for the family. No longer is there a
bride's and a groom's side of the church _ instead, both families
sit together.
</P>
<P>
   Many of the cultural practices that have been layered onto the
ceremony ``really come from a medieval, feudal expression of
marriage,'' says Jim Field, director of the Office of Worship. He
adds that the church revised the ceremony because it sees the bride
and groom as equals, and ``as adults, making mature adult
decisions.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Over the centuries things have crept in which really shouldn't
have been there,'' says the Rev. Austin Fleming, a parish priest in
Concord who presided over the videotaped wedding. One of the
examples he cites is the ubiquitous unity candle, a feature in many
weddings in different faiths.
</P>
<P>
   ``The unity candle was invented by some company that markets
unity candles,'' he says, laughing. Fleming also acts as an adviser
on the ceremony, and has written several books about Catholic
weddings, including ``Parish Weddings'' and ``Prayerbook for
Engaged Couples.''
</P>
<P>
   ``People tend to get it when they see it done. It's a woman
giving herself to her husband, and a man giving himself to his
wife,'' says Fleming, who dismisses the old practice under which
the groom would not see his bride before the ceremony as
``superstition.''
</P>
<P>
   Of course, the church does not insist that couples follow the
rewritten ceremony.
</P>
<P>
   ``I put in front of them the ways the church says to do it, and
I try and discourage what I call the marginalized groom approach,''
says Fleming, referring to the groom's awkward position when the
assembly turns away from him to watch the bride approach.
</P>
<P>
   The video will be sold primarily to parishes and churches in
English-speaking countries, which will in turn loan it to would-be
spouses. Copies will also be given to the members of the assembly
who volunteered to be in the video.
</P>
<P>
   And what is it like to be a model couple for Catholics
everywhere?
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not really real for us yet, at least until we see it in
January,'' Denise says.
</P>
<P>
   The couple said reenacting their ceremony had other benefits as
well. Some of their friends couldn't make it to their real wedding,
but showed up for the filming. All in all, it was fun to get their
friends and family together again, Jim says. ``It's not hard at all
to smile walking down the aisle.''

CELLULAR TOWERS IN THE WILD SEND A BAD SIGNAL 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ALEX BEAM  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Here is a different kind of summer hiking story: Not so long ago
a group of friends and I were ascending Mount Kearsarge, a not
particularly challenging 2,900-foot peak in central New Hampshire.
It was rainy and foggy. We had a bunch of children with us and were
planning to picnic on the summit, which was obscured from view.
</P>
<P>
   Imagine our surprise when we discovered who had arrived there
first _ US Cellular Corp., with a 180-foot-tall cellphone antenna
tower. The otherworldly forest of high-tech geegaws was footed
firmly in concrete blocks, otherwise we might have been tempted to
cut it down.
</P>
<P>
   The story of what happened to Mount Kearsarge is quite
astonishing, and it is one that is being repeated all around the
country. The cellphone industry has wired most urban areas and the
nation's most-traveled highways so that Muffy always can reach
husband, Ralph, in his Jeep Explorer and remind him to bring home
that fresh arugula for supper.
</P>
<P>
   Now the industry is adding 50,000 new sites to ``fill in'' the
uncovered tracts, which is why cellphone towers are becoming a
common sight in state parks and wilderness areas. Mountaintops all
over New England are fair game. In Massachusetts, the Department of
Environmental Management has leased 35 of its 50 summit fire towers
for commercial transmissions. On Mount Mansfield, Vermont's highest
peak, a summit trail has been closed for several years because of
excessive microwave radiation from a communications tower.
</P>
<P>
   When it comes to siting one of these ungainly monsters,
underhanded behavior is the order of the day. The Society for the
Protection of New Hampshire Forests deeded the Kearsarge
mountaintop to the state ``upon the express condition that the
state will maintain said tract as a forestry and recreation
reservation for public use and benefit.'' But in 1997, in the
proverbial dead of night, New Hampshire's Department of Resources
and Economic Development let US Cellular throw up its gargantuan
tower. One state bureaucrat counseled that the tower be built
without ``a general public notice and notification.''
</P>
<P>
   Soon after the tower went up, 1,000 local residents petitioned
Gore administration wannabe N.H. Gov. Jeanne Shaheen for its
removal. She blew them off. Concord (N.H.) Monitor columnist John
Skow, who lives near Kearsarge, calls the tower ``a huge,
glittering one-finger salute from business greedsters and our own
state officials.'' (An un-gelded columnist at a serious American
newspaper? That's a story in itself. . . .) Two citizens groups and
the SPNHF itself have filed lawsuits seeking to tear down the
tower. They've lost in lower courts, and the impeachment-depleted
New Hampshire Supreme Court is in no condition to hear their
appeals.
</P>
<P>
   Prodded by the Federal Communications Commission, the telecom
industry last year agreed to inform the Appalachian Trail
Conference when it planned to site a tower within a mile of the
historic Georgia-to-Maine hiking path. But at least seven such
towers have been sited, and only one was reported to the ATC.
``There is a legal document requiring notification, but the
industry associations are not getting the word out,'' says David
Reus of the ATC.
</P>
<P>
   Thanks to the Republican Congress and the telecom-friendly
Clinton Administration, cell tower opponents hardly have a leg on
which to stand. The Telecommunications Act of 1996 says local
authorities can review, but not reject, cellphone tower proposals _
quite a dandy present for the wireless industry. So far, attempts
to strengthen local autonomy in tower siting have failed. Vermont
Senator Patrick Leahy and Representative James Jeffords proposed
legislation in Congress that died. The Massachusetts Legislature
passed a similar bill that Governor Cellucci vetoed. A proposed
moratorium on the development of Mount Kearsarge languishes in the
New Hampshire Legislature.
</P>
<P>
   The broad anti-community wording of the Telecom Act has provided
a field day for lawyers, and suits opposing cell towers have sprung
up in almost every jurisdiction in America. But no
precedent-setting case has yet made its way to the Supreme Court.
Meanwhile, the towers keep going up. ``They really are changing
these mountaintops,'' says Eleanor Tillinghast, an environmental
activist in the town of Mount Washington. ``And once they change,
they're changed forever.''

ON STYLE, MESSAGE, GOVERNOR GOES HIS OWN WAY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By GLEN JOHNSON  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ George W. Bush talks a lot about being a
``compassionate conservative,'' but in conducting his campaign,
he's taken a decidely ``my-way-or-the-highway'' approach.
</P>
<P>
   The Republican presidential contender still gets his principal
political advice from the ``Iron Triangle'' of aides who helped him
run for Texas governor in 1994, despite recommendations that he
expand his team for the general election with experienced
Washington operatives.
</P>
<P>
   On the stump, Bush is delivering pretty much the same speech he
has all year, focusing on the core themes of schools, Social
Security reform, military readiness, religion-based welfare
programs, and tax cuts. The message stays the same despite attacks
by Vice President Al Gore that Bush's $1.3 trillion tax-cut plan
``would wreck our good economy.''
</P>
<P>
   While the Commission on Presidential Debates, created to
organize the fall face-offs, has proposed three meetings between
Bush and Gore, the Texas governor has resisted the panel's
recommendation and is instead saying he may participate in only two
of those debates. Eager to control the format for his appearance,
he is toying with selecting a third debate from nontraditional
hosts such as late-night television's David Letterman or CNN's
Larry King.
</P>
<P>
   Even with his daily routine, Bush is breaking the mold for
presidential candidates.
</P>
<P>
   Two weeks ago, he wrapped up an appearance in Memphis and
decided to head immediately for Dallas, even though his traveling
press corps had spent thousands of dollars running phone lines and
ordering food for a filing center arranged by the campaign. The
reason for the change? Bush wanted to run at a favorite athletic
club in Texas.
</P>
<P>
   The governor has also refused to submit to the longheld practice
of moving everywhere with a small group of reporters in case
something unexpected happens while traveling from place to place.
Bush routinely leaves reporters behind and takes just his Secret
Service detail to fund-raisers or for exercise.
</P>
<P>
   While brashness and independence are hallmarks of Texans in
general, they are attributes of Bush in particular. His bravado has
manifested itself in ways big and small throughout his life. In
fact, his wry smile has often been interpreted as a smirk.
</P>
<P>
   As a child and teenager, he was forever the ring leader, setting
up neighborhood baseball games or a stickball league at Phillips
Academy in Andover, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   In his 20s and 30s, he was known for his hard-partying ways,
favoring bourbon and beer. In a rare sign of contrition, he quit
drinking in 1986 after repeated requests from his wife, Laura, and
overindulging at his 40th birthday party.
</P>
<P>
   In running for Texas governor, Bush broke with conventional
wisdom by challenging a popular incumbent, Democrat Ann Richards.
His chief political strategist, Karl Rove, outlined a strategy of
focusing on four core themes, and Bush executed the plan with
success, even as Richards derided him as ``Shrub'' and someone with
a limited vision.
</P>
<P>
   Today Bush still receives advice from Rove and the other two
members of the ``Triangle,'' campaign manager Joe Allbaugh and
communications director Karen Hughes.
</P>
<P>
   He is sticking with his tax cut plan, which dwarfs cuts proposed
by Republicans in Congress, even though it was initially proposed
to entice voters in tax-free New Hampshire and to rally the GOP
base.
</P>
<P>
   When Rove's primary strategy appeared to falter with Bush's loss
in the first-in-the-nation primary, his boss scoffed at calls for a
staff shakeup and instead bore down on the campaign trail.
</P>
<P>
   Today, despite the pressure of being the Republican nominee,
Bush still moves to his own beat.
</P>
<P>
   He prefers to sleep in his own bed, so recent campaign weeks
have called for no more than three days on the road. When he
travels, he takes along his favorite feather pillow and eats peanut
butter-and-jelly sandwiches that airplane caterers make especially
for him.
</P>
<P>
   Asked last week when he would pick up the leisurely pace, Bush
sounded offended.
</P>
<P>
   ``You thought it was leisurely coming down the train in
California? I didn't think it was so leisurely,'' he said,
referring to his train trip with Senator John S. McCain of Arizona.
Most days featured only one public appearance, followed by hours on
the train. During that span, Bush was often out of public view,
conducting media interviews, some even by a satellite dish loaded
onto the train.
</P>
<P>
   Bush has made it clear that he'll continue to set his own
cadence should he be elected president in November.
</P>
<P>
   While President Bush, the candidate's father, retreated to the
family compound in Kennebunkport, Maine, a resort community where
his staff and entourage could also take working vacations, the
governor insists he will seek refuge within a 1,500-acre ranch he
is building a ranch in Crawford, Texas, a one-stoplight town 30

eat.

PICKING JUSTICES IS TRICKY STUFF 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MARTIN F. NOLAN  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   In his acceptance speech in Los Angeles, Vice President Gore
delivered a promise and a prediction on abortion rights. ``I will
protect and defend a woman's right to choose,'' Gore said. ``The
last thing this country needs is a Supreme Court that overturns Roe
v. Wade.''
</P>
<P>
   Since he opposed some abortion rights in the 1970s, Gore was
less exercised about this alleged rollback than other orators at
the Democratic National Convention. A student of history, Gore also
knows that no president can guarantee how an appointee will act
once draped in that lifetime black robe. Hence his veiled
prediction: a repeal of Roe v. Wade is probably the last thing the
country will get, partisan frenzy notwithstanding.
</P>
<P>
   History is a stronger precedent than rhetoric. ``Presidents
seldom get what they expect when they appoint judges,'' says
Stephen J. Wermiel, an authority on a notoriously unpredictable
appointee, the late William J. Brennan Jr., chosen by a
conservative, President Eisenhower. Brennan became a liberal lion
on the court for 33 years.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was October in an election year, 1956, and Republicans
wanted to shore up the Catholic vote in the Northeast, so here was
a state court judge in New Jersey with a moderate record,'' says
Wermiel, a professor of law at American University in Washington.
``Eisenhower engaged in electoral politics, not judicial politics,
an important point. He wasn't trying to reshape the court. One
argument is that by appearing bipartisan in choosing Brennan, a
Catholic Democrat, Ike got just what he wanted, help in the '56
election.''
</P>
<P>
   Politics can backfire, even in abortion rights. The repeal of
Roe v. Wade has been a Democratic staple of Halloween hyperbole
since the court affirmed abortion rights in 1973. Since then, eight
justices have been confirmed for the court. Six of the eight, all
but Antonin Scalia and Clarence Thomas, have backed Roe v. Wade,
which protects first-trimester abortions. President Clinton
appointed Stephen G. Breyer and Ruth Bader Ginsburg. Republican
presidents chose the other four: John Paul Stevens, Sandra Day
O'Connor, Anthony M. Kennedy, and David H. Souter.
</P>
<P>
   The historical record does not diminish political sniping.
``Five people can decide the destiny of unborn children,'' Pat
Robertson told a Republican rally in Philadephia, as he fashioned
actuarial tables into fright totems: ``It looks as if two or three
of those unelected officials are getting ready to retire or go on
up to that great court in the sky.''
</P>
<P>
   The reverend's fellow alarmist, Bill Clinton, said of
Republicans during the GOP convention: ``What they want to do is to
seem safe and reliable and compassionate and inclusive. They're not
going to be up there saying, `Vote for us, our favorite Supreme
Court judges are Justice Thomas and Justice Scalia, and we're going
to repeal Roe v. Wade,' but that's what's going to happen.''
</P>
<P>
   The Democratic platform seconds that sentiment: ``This year's
Supreme Court rulings show to us all that eliminating a woman's
right to choose is only one justice away. That is why the stakes in
this election are as high as ever.''
</P>
<P>
   If that rhetoric were not high-pitched enough, abortion rights
supporter Kate Michelman told the Democratic delegates that, ``If
he has the opportunity, George W. Bush will appoint enough Supreme
Court justices to overturn Roe V. Wade and end legal abortion.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush and his party oppose abortion rights, but says he will
follow no litmus test. He calls himself ``a uniter, not a divider''
and is unlikely to roil the country by picking fulltime ideologues
like Scalia and Thomas.
</P>
<P>
   The framers of the Constitution tried to shield it from
politicians. In Federalist Paper No. 78, Alexander Hamilton wrote
that ``the judiciary is beyond comparison the weakest of the three
departments of power.''
</P>
<P>
   That explains why every four years, the Supreme Court is a
tempting target for demagogues on both sides.

EXPLOITING CHILDREN 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DERRICK Z. JACKSON  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The difference between capitalism and communism is that under
capitalism, man exploits man. Communism is the opposite. So goes a
joke from the Cold War. You can say the same thing about exploiting
children.
</P>
<P>
   Under communism, we were told, children behind the Berlin Wall
or in the shadows of the Great Wall trudged forelornly to school in
drab shades of gray, green, and brown. We were told these children
were allowed no individuality or freedom of expression, being
ground into a mindless monotony. To underscore the bituminous haze
through which we saw those children, Richard Nixon said, ``What are
our schools if not for indoctrination against communism?''
</P>
<P>
   Today, capitalism is the opposite.
</P>
<P>
   A reminder of this was in The Boston Globe sports section last
Thursday. Red Sox outfielder Darren Lewis was photographed with a
group of children. Lewis was pointing to a new ballfield at the
Roxbury Boys and Girls Club.
</P>
<P>
   Far more striking was that nearly every one of the children in
the picture wore exactly the same T-shirt. The T-shirt was for
Claritin allergy drugs, an official sponsor of Major League
Baseball.
</P>
<P>
   The caption under the photo said Lewis offered a ``helping
hand'' to the youths. As the children's chests blared ``Claritin
(loratadine), Claritin (loratadine), Claritin (loratadine),
Claritin (loratadine),'' it was clear that it was the children who
were far more helpful as unwitting billboards for the
pharmaceutical industry.
</P>
<P>
   We cannot seem to invest in public schools so that these kids
can think for themselves, but we have no problem producing a
proletariat that possesses neither capital nor the means of
production, but do offer mobile spaces of 18 inches by 24 inches to
drum Claritin (loratadine) into the heads of anyone they meet.
</P>
<P>
   Claritin is a particularly ironic case, finding the time to play
urban savior at the very time it is under attack for gouging the
kids' parents and elders. This week on the presidential campaign
trail, Vice President Al Gore singled out Claritin, made by
Schering-Plough, for using its patents to pile up profits.
Pharmaceuticals are the most profitable companies in the world, and
Schering-Plough, with Claritin as its flagship drug, had a profit
of $2.1 billion in 1999 on sales of $9.2 billion. The 23 percent
return on revenues was four times higher than the average return,
for example, for airlines.
</P>
<P>
   According to a Wall Street Journal feature last month, drug
companies spend more money on salespeople than on scientists.
Schering-Plough, instead of working with Congress to make drugs
more affordable, now spends more on advertising Claritin than
Coca-Cola spends on Coke or what Anheuser-Busch spends to push
Budweiser and its Super Bowl lizards.
</P>
<P>
   Instead of seeking compromise with politicians on Capitol Hill
who note that 20 pills of Claritin cost $44 in the United States
while they cost $8.75 in a more universal-health-care Europe,
Schering-Plough has reportedly tripled its lobbying budget to $6.6
million. It has hired former US Representative Bob Livingston to
lobby for patent extensions and the license to further gouge.
</P>
<P>
   But this is far greater than just singling out Claritin. This is
about the use of our children as billboards, period. Coca-Cola may
lag behind Claritin in overall advertising, but Coke is leading the
race to turn public schools into one giant billboard. Soda
companies, one of the biggest contributors to our national epidemic
of child obesity, are throwing cash at struggling school systems to
gain exclusive vending machine rights, to plaster their name along
the hallways, on scoreboards, on school buses and on rooftops.
</P>
<P>
   Once we let Channel One into schools a decade ago, with its
12-minute homeroom show that contained two minutes of fast-food
commercials, the floodgates were open. For all the pious things we
say about how precious our children are and how priceless is their
childhood, we have allowed capitalism to put a price on their heads
and on their chests.
</P>
<P>
   Not one of these companies cares whether standardized scores
rise, but I bet you would see the greatest rise in scores in the
history of the Western world if you took out a few questions on
Charlemagne and asked things like:
</P>
<P>
   ``Michael Jordan and Tiger Woods are associated with: a.
humanitarian causes; b. politics; c. choking in big matches; d. a
swoosh.''
</P>
<P>
   Why, after a few more Claritin sports clinics, kids might even
be able to spell loratadine. Communism has faded into feeble
caricatures, but there are still children being indoctrinated. They
are told they are individuals, but capitalism is doing its best to
convince them otherwise. What are our schools, if not to turn
children into a mindless, monotonous billboard?

&HT;     APPLE SAYS NEW OPERATING SYSTEM ON TARGET 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By VICTORIA COLLIVER  
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Apple Computer Inc. chief executive Steve Jobs
says the release of the next-generation Mac OS X is on schedule
with its first public test set for Sept. 13.
</P>
<P>
   The new operating system, which Jobs called the ``future of the
Macintosh,'' will be released at the Apple Expo in Paris. The
company is on track to release the product to the general public in
early 2001.
</P>
<P>
   Apple has spent years preparing a rewritten version of the
operating system that runs its computers. Dubbed OS X (10), the
software program includes features such as a tool bar for
organizing frequently used documents and programs, a software
player for listening to music MP3 files and an updated Quicktime
player for viewing video.
</P>
<P>
   David Bailey, research analyst with Gerard Klauer Mattison &AMP; Co.
in New York, said that the Cupertino-based company is right on
track.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the first major upgrade to the operating system in many
years, and it brings many fundamental benefits to users like
stability, reliability and performance,'' he said, adding it has a
greater affinity to Unix-type systems, such as Linux.
</P>
<P>
   Jobs demonstrated the new system Tuesday at a convention in San
Francisco, but things didn't go as planned when he tried to show
how quickly the computer will resume working from sleep mode.
</P>
<P>
   ``Something's going wrong here,'' he said when nothing happened.
``But when it works, it actually wakes up in 1 second.'' The
previous version, Mac OS 9, takes at least 8 seconds.
</P>
<P>
   Jobs spent much of his time Tuesday rehashing the new line of
products he debuted six weeks ago at the Macworld Expo show in New
York, including the widely acclaimed Power Mac G4 Cube.
</P>
<P>
   The Cube, which retails for $1,799, is a faster, more powerful
version of the existing G4 Power Mac packed into an 8- by 8-inch
cube. He said the company has already shipped ``tens of thousands''
of the new computers.

POTATOES, PESTICIDES DIVIDE CANADIAN ISLAND 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By COLIN NICKERSON  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   KENSINGTON, Prince Edward Island _ On this bucolic island, the
potato is king _ lord of the field and dominator of the economy,
thanks largely to the insatiable North American appetite for french
fries.
</P>
<P>
   But a hard-charging coalition of environmental activists,
anglers, wildlife scientists, organic farmers, and summer visitors
is seeking to topple the tuber from the throne, charging that
pesticides used to cultivate potatoes are contaminating rivers and
streams.
</P>
<P>
   In the end, the sound and fury echoing over tiny Prince Edward
Island's big potato fields is really about changes coming to the
island's farms, and about a widening gulf between farmers and a new
generation of neighbors, people who live in the country but do not
take their livelihoods from the land.
</P>
<P>
   The attack on a crop that is a staple of the economy and even an
integral part of the island's identity has gained surprising
momentum, mainly as the result of a shocking series of ``fish
kills'' by insecticides and fungicides washed from potato fields
during intense rainbursts over the past two summers.
</P>
<P>
   Owing to a combination of freak weather _ with torrents of rain
falling in mere minutes _ but also to drastically expanded acreage
planted in potatoes, roughly a dozen such kills have occurred since
July 1999, with tens of thousands of trout and other fish dying
within hours of the deluges.
</P>
<P>
   The waterways seem to rebound, but dead fish floating belly-up
down tainted streams is not a happy image. ``It's a pretty jarring
note in our pastoral symphony,'' said Wayne MacKinnon, spokesman
for the provincial Department of Agriculture. ``PEI's reputation as
a pristine place is taking some knocks.''
</P>
<P>
   In terms of economic might, tourism ranks a close second to
potatoes. So letters to newspapers from off-island visitors upset
by dead fish resonate at least as loudly as local complaints. As a
result, businessfolk and tourist officials are also leaning on
potato growers to clean up their act.
</P>
<P>
   The island's more strident critics of modern agriculture,
meanwhile, accuse farmers of nothing less than poisoning paradise,
wiping out aquatic species and introducing chemicals that may even
pose a threat to human health in this picture-postcard realm of
red-dirt fields, quaint fishing villages, and sandstone cliffs
rising from the Gulf of St. Lawrence.
</P>
<P>
   ``The fish deaths are just an outward sign of deeper
contamination by industrial-corporate agriculture,'' said activist
Sharon Labchuk, who gained notoriety last year by posing naked,
save a gas mask, for a photographer in a potato field. ``Beneath
the outward beauty lies poison and death. Our island is becoming a
toxic vacationland.''
</P>
<P>
   That kind of rhetoric infuriates farmers, who say pesticides are
crucial to healthy crops, and causes wincing among more moderate
campaigners against pesticides. ``The real issue is soil erosion,''
said Daryl Guignion, professor of wildlife biology at the
University of Prince Edward Island and president of the PEI
Wildlife Federation.
</P>
<P>
   ``Farming has changed so dramatically on the island over the
past decade or so,'' he said. ``The farms are bigger, the fields
are bigger, the hedgerows have been bulldozed to make room for even
more potatoes. Bigger fields mean more run-off, and that washed-off
soil is carrying the poisons to the water.''
</P>
<P>
   He added: ``I don't think we have an environmental catastrophe
here, yet. But the fish kills should certainly be taken as an
alarm, ringing loud.''
</P>
<P>
   Most potato farmers have come to agree, with varying degrees of
reluctance. Still, they are stunned by the anger and invective
hurled their way by the more vociferous activists. Pesticide use on
the island is at least as tightly regulated as anywhere else in
Canada, and, because of environmental critics, probably more
closely monitored.
</P>
<P>
   ``No one like pesticides, but the reality is that we need them
to grow the quantity and quality of potatoes that consumers
demand,'' said Robert MacDonald, whose family has been farming in
the community of Belle River for more than four decades.
</P>
<P>
   ``Fish kills are not acceptable. We're making changes and there
are perhaps more to come,'' he said. ``But we're also being
dehumanized with terms like `corporate agriculture' and `industrial
farming' _ as if we lived in distant boardrooms. We live on our
farms, and our families eat the crops we grow. Modern farming takes
more than sweat and a pitchfork. It takes brains, it takes
technology, and yes, it takes chemicals.''
</P>
<P>
   The controversy is the bitterest since the mid-1990s, when
opponents railed against construction of the Confederation Bridge,
an engineering marvel that anchored Prince Edward Island for the
first time to the mainland.
</P>
<P>
   Although the fish kills are real and frightening, much of the
debate seems to be about changes occurring as island farms expand
to compete in world markets.
</P>
<P>
   A sense of changelessness is part of the charm of Canada's
smallest province _ 2,184 square miles, population 135,000 _ whose
natural beauty was celebrated in Lucy Maud Montgomery's novel
``Anne of Green Gables.''
</P>
<P>
   But economic necessity means that small farms that once typified
island agriculture have given way to larger operations practicing a
more intensive form of agriculture. North America's voracious
hunger for fries has created a potato boom for the island,
resulting in the building of two mammoth potato processing plants
by Canadian food companies.
</P>
<P>
   A decade ago, Prince Edward Island produced an annual 1.5
billion pounds of potatoes, most of which were sold as seed stock
or in grocery bags as table fare. Today, the island's 600 farms
grow 2.5 billion pounds of potatoes a year, about half of which are
processed into french fries for fast-food chains.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, the amount of land dedicated to potato
cultivation has doubled, from 55,000 acres in 1980 to 110,000 acres
today. Farmers have had to employ an arsenal of chemicals to fight
pests _ most notoriously the Colorado potato beetle and late
blight, the fungus that caused the famines that devastated
19th-century Ireland. The use of poisons to battle the beetle has
declined a bit in recent years, but spraying of fungicide to fight
blight has risen 85 percent.
</P>
<P>
   ``The over-intensive potato practices are very destructive,''
said Tony Reddin of the Environmental Coalition of Prince Edward
Island. ``But farmers are as much the victims as the wildlife. . .
. Provincial and federal governments, as well as agribusiness, have
sold them on industrial farming methods.''
</P>
<P>
   Farmers roll their eyes at ecologists' suggestion that they give
up modern methods to raise organic crops on small holdings. But
most concede that new provincial rules setting buffer zones of 10
to 30 yards between potato fields and waterways are both necessary
and overdue.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, however, they feel frustrated by environmental
activists who blast pesticide use but have prevented farms from
switching to genetically modified potato stocks resistant to
beetles and blight.
</P>
<P>
   ``We spray our crops not because we want to kill fish or hurt
rivers, but because that's what it takes to raise healthy crops,''
said MacDonald. ``Our only realistic choice is use these sprays or
watch fields wither and die.''

KENNEDY STATUE A BIT TOO SURREAL, CRITICS SAY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ELLEN BARRY  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   HYANNIS, Mass. _ Over the years, in its capacity as the Kennedy
family's summer retreat, this village has embodied sun-drenched
promise, numbing loss, and dreamlike elegy, but never, not until
now, has it ventured into the realm of the supernatural.
</P>
<P>
   Here, where one family's past has become a local industry, the
bronze statue due to rise up next year at the corner of Ocean and
South streets will depict a moment that flies in the face of
history and physics: a 46-year-old John F. Kennedy, in an
open-necked Oxford and rolled-up khakis, with his arm slung around
the neck of his 38-year-old son, John Jr.
</P>
<P>
   Since preliminary drawings were made public last week, admirers
have praised the idea as a rendering of the two men as they could
be imagined today in heaven.
</P>
<P>
   But along Main Street last week, a number of people who were
asked about the plans used the same word: ``Bizarre.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't like the idea,'' said 64-year-old Grace Winters, a
clerk at Sullivan's religious supply store, where, she points out,
Ethel Kennedy frequently shopped for spiritual texts. ``He didn't
know John as a young man, he knew John as a child. If they wanted
to do the two John Kennedys, I think it should be father and baby
son.''
</P>
<P>
   But officials from the Hyannis Area Chamber of Commerce, which
commissioned the statue, said Kennedy relatives requested that both
men be depicted as adults.
</P>
<P>
   The way sculptor David Lewis sees it, the decision to portray a
fantasy is underlaid by a truth that is obvious to anyone who lives
here: It's not historical research that brings Kennedy buffs to
Hyannis. For 30 years, visitors have arrived as pilgrims as much as
tourists, pouring in to pass their hands over the Kennedy pews at
St. Francis Xavier Church and glimpse the Kennedy houses from the
distant vantage of a Hy-Line tour boat.
</P>
<P>
   Occasionally, in an effort to grasp something real out of the
haze of memories, they have gone further than that. Years ago,
before the stockade fence went up around the Kennedy compound in
Hyannis Port, people used to rip shingles off the sides of the
houses, said Harold Tobey, 64, who was a police officer here for 17
years. Another resident recalled watching visitors reach underneath
the stockade fence to grab dirt and grass.
</P>
<P>
   Ruth Rusher, a longtime tour guide from Hyannis who gives her
age as ``almost 90,'' said the fence went up after an unpleasant
encounter between Rose Kennedy and a bus full of tourists who
``appeared to be, shall we say, pushy . . . and felt they should
touch Rose.''
</P>
<P>
   The Hyannis Area Chamber of Commerce recognized long ago that
visitors came here in search of an uplifting emotional experience.
At the tiny JFK Museum, which is squeezed in between the Consumer
Credit Counseling Service and the Cape Cod Dispute Resolution
Center, the assassination of the president is barely mentioned.
It's in this spirit, Lewis said, that he is fixing the father and
son as two young men on an imaginary beach idyll. What this
sculpture is, he said, is ``a wish.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I think people have to get used to the fact that this is
poetical, mystical,'' said Lewis in his Osterville studio. ``Every
great figure in our history is a flawed human being like we are,
but their deeds take on aspects of mythology, and we strive for
it.''
</P>
<P>
   What's more, he said, the responses he's heard have been
positive and emotional _ a boon for the $350,000 project, which
will be paid for with private donations. Within three days after
the concept was made public, to Lewis's surprise, four donors
offered $10,000, enough to earn each of them a limited-edition
miniature of the statue.
</P>
<P>
   ``They get tearful and they get emotional. They love the idea. I
have heard very little skepticism,'' Lewis said.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, some visitors interviewed, like John and Florence
Tutunjian, a Long Island couple of around 60, said they were
enraptured by the idea. The Tutunjians _ he in crisp nautical wear
and she in aqua, with a neck scarf and sunglasses _ were sitting
quietly at the JFK memorial, having come to Hyannis in search of
``a spirit,'' said John Tutunjian, a first-generation
Syrian-American who recalled hearing about the Kennedy compound as
a young man and assuming that someday he would have a Tutunjian
compound of his own.
</P>
<P>
   Seeing the statue would be ``almost a religious experience,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   But a number of local people interviewed said they found the
idea of the father and son strolling together jarring, to say the
least. Jacqui McGuire, 35, of Sandwich, shook her head and said the
idea was ``surreal.'' Tobey, a former president of the Town
Council, said the imaginary tete-a-tete ``just doesn't seem real to
me.'' Chuck Odams, who sells sculptures at Just Africa on Main
Street, called it ``an odd concept.''
</P>
<P>
   One woman just hummed the theme song to ``The Twilight Zone.''
</P>
<P>
   If any event could elevate this coastal town from tourist
attraction to something like a shrine, though, it was the crash
last year that took the lives of 38-year-old John F. Kennedy Jr.;
his wife, Carolyn Bessette Kennedy, 33; and her sister, 34-year-old
Lauren Bessette. In the weeks after the plane went down, Hyannis
hosted a flood of visitors who followed some impulse across the
country so they could grieve here. In the first week after the
crash, 8,000 people walked through the tiny museum, which had
logged an average of 40,000 people a year since it opened in 1991.
By the end of last year, 70,000 had visited the museum, marking its
highest attendance rate ever, said Lynne Poyant, director of the
Hyannis Area Chamber of Commerce.
</P>
<P>
   In discussing plans for a statue of John F. Kennedy and his son,
John Jr., some villagers wondered whether the massive upswelling of
emotion that followed last summer's plane crash might subside
dramatically, as it appears to have for Diana, Princess of Wales,
after her death in a 1998 car crash.
</P>
<P>
   But Fred Stetson, a former president of the Chamber of Commerce
who sits on the advisory committee for the statue, doesn't believe
the fascination and grief will ever subside. If watching the
visitors here has taught him anything, it has taught him that.
</P>
<P>
   ``People come looking for contact. And one of the reasons it's
continued so strong is that you can't get that contact,'' Stetson
said. ``You haven't really put your hands on anything.''

<P>
   STOCKBRIDGE, Mass. _ In the age of voyeurism and tell-all
stories, Diane Schwartz is the perfect Hollywood teen. She is
gutsy, street-chic hip, and she has the pouty lips and
honey-colored hair of a model.
</P>
<P>
   Plus, she has a gut-wrenching story to tell.
</P>
<P>
   Schwartz looks back to her early teens, and can now say,
bluntly, ``I was on the road to death.'' She was an anorexic who
would binge eat, then stick her fingers down her throat. She
overdosed four times, on whatever drugs she could find in the
medicine cabinet. The last time it was 36 Dexatrim diet pills.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wanted to die, but I was too scared to die,'' said Schwartz,
now 18.
</P>
<P>
   So when she and her seven friends first took the stage at the
DeSisto School, a leafy campus in a former Berkshires mansion that
caters to emotionally troubled teens, she wasn't acting _ exactly.
</P>
<P>
   In a rock-musical about the anguish of teen life, she belts out
songs of despair. In one she cries out, ``Where were you when I
needed you? Why weren't you ever home, Daddy?''
</P>
<P>
   From a high-school auditorium in 1996, ``Inappropriate'' went to
an off-Broadway theater a year later, where it wowed critics who
called ``Inappropriate'' a prequel to ``Rent.'' During a run this
spring in Los Angeles with a different cast, film executives saw it
and were enraptured. Now three Hollywood studios are vying to turn
it into a movie.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a tried-and-true Hollywood story,'' said Alan Shapiro,
a screenwriter best known for ``The Crush,'' which starred Alicia
Silverstone. ``Their stories are endemic to the struggles of
adolescents, and they are authentic.''
</P>
<P>
   Shapiro, who graduated from DeSisto in 1975, has wanted to tell
this story _ which is also his story _ for 25 years, partly for
catharsis. But he also knows it will sell. The teen market is so
hot that even bad films, like this summer's ``Scary Movie,'' can
gross $145 million.
</P>
<P>
   Based on a treatment of the movie, three film studios are
negotiating a screenplay with him. School administrators say actor
Laurence Fishburne is interested in playing the leading adult role.
</P>
<P>
   The movie will be ``Fame'' meets ``The Breakfast Club,'' but in
a rawer, in-your-face style that's part ``Real World.'' It centers
on eight students who arrive at the school against their will, as
most do. Here, they slowly become friends. And along the way, as
the real-life drama unfolded, their theater director, Lonnie
McNeil, proposes a play about their struggles.
</P>
<P>
   But just putting it together, with a cast of clashing, sometimes
needy, teenagers, presented problems.
</P>
<P>
   One student at first refused to perform, saying he didn't want
people to think he was gay. Another performer, a female, ran away
during rehearsal season. On the road, they argued, sometimes over
the silliest things.
</P>
<P>
   ``One time when we were in New York I got into an argument with
Jamie about sponges. He was like, `Use the counter sponge for the
counter and the dishes sponge for the dishes,' '' Schwartz said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It wasn't a big deal, but she got all upset,'' said Jamie
Ourisman, 20, sitting across from Schwartz in the campus's Rose
Room.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought he was being controlling. I just ran into the
bathroom and cried,'' Schwartz said. ``I laugh now, thinking about
it. I would make a big deal out of little things.''
</P>
<P>
   One of the biggest problems, though, was that some of the
students had never performed before. But what they lacked in
on-stage experience, they made up for digging into the emotions of
their real-life experiences.
</P>
<P>
   In 90 minutes, through rock, rap, poetry, and dance, the eight
actors deal with issues ranging from rape, to homophobia, to drug
abuse, to loneliness.
</P>
<P>
   When Adam Schiffman, 19, sings ``The Dream'' his arms tremor,
his eyes widen, as if he sees his dad's face:
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
(lyrics style) &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Your finger points and puts me down
</P>
<P>
   Your words slice me like a knife
</P>
<P>
   in forming me to measure up
</P>
<P>
   to your own standards
</P>
<P>
   you say I need to make you proud and become more like you . . .
well . . . you are not my idol.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
(end lyrics style) &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   One night, his father came to watch him perform. From the stage,
Schiffman could see his dad wiping a tear. It's the only time, he
said, he ever saw his father cry.
</P>
<P>
   Their relationship, which was distant, is improving. But every
time Schiffman sings that song, he isn't acting. He's telling his
story.
</P>
<P>
   Josh Geyer, 16, who plays a gay teenager who is often taunted by
homophobes, takes his scenes from real life. He struggled with his
sexuality and two years ago came out of the closet, at the prodding
of his roommate, Ourisman.
</P>
<P>
   ``I knew he was. When you live with someone, you just know,''
Ourisman said.
</P>
<P>
   The students live on a 300-acre campus of rolling lawns, and
study in a Colonial mansion. About 110 students live here, in a
year-round program that combines scholastics, athletics, individual
therapy, and group counseling.
</P>
<P>
   It's a place of last resort for troubled youths whose parents
can afford the $60,000-a-year tuition. To learn Spanish, they live
in the school's villa in San Miguel de Allende, Mexico. A biology
program brings others to the Florida Keys.
</P>
<P>
   Now the school can add ``Inappropriate'' to its list of unusual
programs. After all, how many schools can say their theater
students performed off Broadway?
</P>
<P>
   On its third run off Broadway, The New York Times reviewed it
and said: ``There are moments when this show really could be
compared to the brilliant use of anger, hurt and exuberance in
`Rent' and `Hair.' At other times, the show seems to have been
written and staged by a self-confident high school student.''
</P>
<P>
   Hardly a rave, but enough to draw hundreds to the Theater Row
Theater to see the students. Now, they are working on a deal to
bring ``Inappropriate'' to Boston.
</P>
<P>
   The students are excited, not just because it would give them
celebrity status, but because they want people to know they're not
the only ones who have felt frustrated, bitter, and abandoned.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't even believe that I'm alive,'' Schwartz said, ``and
now they want to make a movie about my life.''

 IN THE CLUBHOUSE, HE'S THE CLEANUP MAN

   LOWELL, Mass. _ Had Andrew ``Woody'' Wittman's summer job been
advertised, the pitch might have gone like this:
</P>
<P>
   ``Work from early June to Labor Day washing uniforms, organizing
sports equipment, preparing food, running errands, etc.
Fourteen-hour workdays common. Total of three days off. Lots of bus
travel. Pay: about $8 per hour.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd heard about Clubbies, but I didn't know what they did,''
muses the 21-year-old senior at the State University of New York at
Albany. ``I didn't know about the hours, that's for damn sure. I
think they made certain not to tell me about the hours.'' Then he
smiles an I'm-a-little-wiser-now smile.
</P>
<P>
   Woody Wittman is serving his first and perhaps last season as
clubhouse manager of the Lowell Spinners, the popular (33 straight
sell-outs) ``short season-A'' affiliate of
</P>
<P>
   the Red Sox that plays in sweet little Edward A. LeLacheur Park,
hard by the Merrimack River. As the team's Clubbie, he does
everything from washing seven or so loads of laundry a day _ each
player has a home, away, and practice ``uni'' _ to making sure no
one runs short of sunflower seeds on which to munch during games.
</P>
<P>
   It was not how he planned to spend his summer. A political
science major who was raised in Middletown, N.Y., in a family of
Yankees worshipers, Wittman had only vague job plans when he was
approached in late April about the position via a circuitous
connection to Spinners trainer Keith Johnson. A little more than a
month later, he found himself tending to the needs of a couple
dozen entry-level professionals, ages 19 to 23, young men not too
different from himself who don't have major-league egos and
probably never will: Of the 141 players who performed for Lowell in
the four seasons prior to this one, only two have made it briefly
to the Red Sox, and both _ Wilton Veras and Steve Lomasney _ are
back in the minors.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's exciting here because we're contending for a pennant,''
Wittman says of life among the Spinners, who were one and a half
games out of first place in the McNamara Division of the New
York-Pennsylvania League going into Tuesday night's game. ``But I'd
like to get back to my girlfriend and my friends. This work wears
on me, it really does.''
</P>
<P>
   He literally eats and sleeps the job, dining and living like the
players themselves on the neighboring campus of the University of
Massachusetts at Lowell. His office is the team's equipment room, a
windowless rectangle tucked beneath the grandstand and packed with,
among many other things, washers, dryers, bats, baseballs,
oversized coolers filled with thirst quenchers, and brightly
colored Canaligator outfits worn by the team's mascot. ``It's my
palace,'' Wittman says of the cluttered room, flashing a wry smile
again.
</P>
<P>
   Being a Clubbie is something of an entrepreneurial gig. Wittman
is paid $500 a month by the Spinners' front office, but himself
collects two dollars per day from each player and coach, who are
Red Sox employees. He also operates the soda machines in both the
home and visiting teams' clubhouses _ charging the out-of-towners
25 cents more per can than the locals _ and reaps their profits. He
figures to gross something over $7,000 this summer, or about $2,300
per month and around $8 per hour. (Spinners players earn only $850
per month.) Since there's little time or opportunity to spend this
stash _ and since he receives free room and board both in Lowell
and on the road _ Wittman will take most of it home come Labor Day.
``Maybe I'll open an IRA,'' he says, and he's serious.
</P>
<P>
   But he'll earn it. Arnold Beyeler, the 36-year-old manager of
the Spinners who never saw the big leagues as a player but has
observed a Clubbie or two in his career, defines Wittman's job in
simple terms: ``You want someone who's always around when you need
him and gets the unis dry.'' Then he adds: ``Woody does a good
job.''
</P>
<P>
   On days in which the Spinners play at home, doing a good job
means piloting his vaguely maroon 1987 Buick Century 18 miles north
to BJ's Wholesale Club in Nashua, N.H. It is there that Wittman
purchases the all-important ``Spread,'' i.e. the
post-batting-practice clubhouse repast he prepares for Spinners
players and coaches. ``This is my twenty-third trip here,'' he
declares at BJ's on a recent Saturday afternoon as he fills his
grocery cart with $38.10 worth of white and wheat bread, chunky
peanut butter, Concord grape jelly, tortilla chips, salsa, babycut
carrots, veggie dip, and oranges. If his selection seems rather,
well, bush league, remember that his per-game budget is only $50
and that he must have money left over to purchase cold cuts for the
coaches and manager, whose status has earned them something a tad
better than PB&AMP;J. Remember, too, that the players, who tend to
approach the Spread as first-graders might a birthday buffet, seem
not to mind at all.
</P>
<P>
   ``Food preparation is something else they didn't tell me
about,'' Wittman says as he motors back to Lowell and looks forward
to laying out his purchases.
</P>
<P>
   No one warned him about nights like the previous one, either. He
arrived home with the team after an eight-game road trip at 1:30
a.m., washed uniforms and sorted out the equipment room before
going to bed at 6, and awakened at 9. ``I'm beat,'' he says softly
now between yawns. ``I'm not myself.
</P>
<P>
   ``You absolutely have to be organized to do this job,'' he
declares a few minutes later. ``Procrastination will kill you. It's
the difference between getting eight hours' sleep and getting
three.''
</P>
<P>
   Team road trips are his salvation. Hotels take care of the
Spinners' laundry and the Spread is replaced by individual take-out
orders. There's actually time to go out with the boys after a game,
although you should remember that this is a league in which
Burlington, Vt., is considered the hot spot. ``We've got a
four-game series there soon and we're all looking forward to it,''
Wittman says, perking up at the thought.
</P>
<P>
   He's also juiced by the ballgame he's just watched both on the
clubhouse TV and in the runway leading to the Spinners dugout, a
3-2, 10-inning win over the Queens Kings on Lunch Cooler Giveaway
Night. Suddenly he's not so ambivalent about his summer. ``My goal
used to be to go into broadcasting,'' he says as the noisy players
file past him toward the showers. ``But the college I went to
didn't offer the kinds of courses I wanted. So I switched to
political science, and I'm not sure why. But since I got here I've
been thinking about going to grad school in sports management. I'm
thinking I'd like to become a general manager.''
</P>
<P>
   For the moment, however, he's still a Clubbie. Some of the
players may be off to the nearby Brewhouse Cafe &AMP; Grille, but
Wittman has many loads of laundry to go before he sleeps.
(Including, on this night, the other team's uniforms, an unexpected
chore for which the Kings will pay him $50.) He'll probably work
until 3:30 a.m., and then ``If I'm lucky I'll sleep till noon.''
</P>
<P>
   And before he leaves LeLacheur Park in the middle of the night,
Woody the Clubbie will have one more chore. He will arm the
security alarm. After all, he'll be the last one out of the
building.

Democrats slap back, saying Cheney is resorting to a tired

fiasco and from United Airlines about a summer-long spate of flight
delays and cancellations. The ads feature top executives.
``Clearly, the most effective way to deal with a crisis is full

   BELLSOUTH _ Thursday is the last day of August and BellSouth
(again) has reached a self-imposed deadline for making its request
to enter long-distance. And BellSouth (again) is not ready to make
that request. Clearly frustrated by the continued delays, BellSouth
is starting to see some real attacks on its home markets. This
month, AT&AMP;T planted its own name on MediaOne and is ramping up
efforts to sell phone service along with Internet access and
television via its upgraded cable lines. Meanwhile, SBC is in
long-distance in Texas and has signed up hundreds of thousands of
customers. Verizon, the former Bell Atlantic, has signed up more

   BKN-HARDAWAY _ The love of money is the root of all evil, the

is money, he believes, or so it is implied in the angry avalanche
of words he's pouring over reporters in Hawaii. There, in paradise
with the U.S. Olympic basketball team, the Miami Heat point guard
purports to be in purgatory. Free agency isn't supposed to be this
frustrating for a five-time All-Star like Timmy. Free agency is
supposed to be a time to savor, a time to be courted by NBA teams
with championship dreams, a time to ask for the moon, or at least
the monetary equivalent of what it took to send Neil Armstrong
there. Something changed for Hardaway, however, something he can't
see and won't acknowledge. He got hurt, repeatedly. He got old,
inevitably. And he became, consequently, more of a health risk than
a supernatural contract reward warrants. (George, Palm Beach Post)

<TEXT>
<P>
   Last spring, newspapers across the country were publishing
articles almost daily about ABC's search for a new ``Monday Night
Football'' announcer to join the veteran Al Michaels in the
broadcast booth. With the NBA playoffs in full swing and kickoff
still four months away, this kind of publicity would have
ordinarily been a testament to the strength and power of the NFL
and its top-rated weekly telecast. But, as Paul Tagliabue, the NFL
commissioner, knew too well, exactly the opposite was true.
</P>
<P>
   Tagliabue had been feeling the heat from the networks that
televise the league's games. In the last go-round, ABC, CBS, Fox
and ESPN anted up a record $17.6 billion over eight years, which,
they quickly discovered, made it impossible for them to make money.
During those negotiations two years ago, Dick Ebersol, president of
NBC Sports, had angrily ended his network's 33-year relationship
with the league, saying that he ``refused to put the livelihood of
its employees at risk'' by entering into such an imprudent deal.
The continued ratings slump last year only hammered home his point.
In March, following the worst season ever for ``Monday Night
Football,'' ratings-wise, ABC persuaded the programming guru Don
Ohlmeyer to come out of retirement and retool the show he produced
in its heyday.
</P>
<P>
   Now, if the newspapers were to be believed, the conservative
radio host Rush Limbaugh was up for the announcer's job. Tagliabue
knew Ohlmeyer as the man who had taken NBC's entertainment division
from dead last to the top of the TV universe, and he hoped that the
Limbaugh reports were either a joke or a marketing ploy. But ABC
was refusing to confirm or deny the reports. He picked up the phone
and called Ohlmeyer at his home in Beverly Hills to set up a
meeting.
</P>
<P>
   The two men sat down to breakfast a few days later at the Four
Seasons in Los Angeles, where Tagliabue suggested Ohlmeyer consider
the veteran ESPN reporters Tom Jackson and Robin Roberts for the
job. But Ohlmeyer wasn't there to talk about announcers. Instead,
he steered the conversation toward what he felt was the bigger
issue and the reason he had decided to go back to producing
football games at age 55.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a critical year for sports and television,'' Ohlmeyer
remembers telling him. So-called reality shows like ``Survivor''
were about to transform viewers' expectations for entertainment on
television. And a new pro football league, dreamed up by the
wrestling impresario Vince McMahon and brought to NBC by Ebersol,
would begin play in 2001, promising to bring fans closer to the
game than they had ever been before. If the NFL wanted to stay
ahead in this environment, Ohlmeyer said, it would have to change
its ways. By the end of the two-hour meeting, Tagliabue had only
one question: Would Ohlmeyer come to the NFL owners' meeting in two
weeks and tell them what he had just told him?
</P>
<P>
   Ohlmeyer's innovations for the new ``Monday Night Football''
won't exactly leap out of the TV set. With great effort, he helped
persuade the league to mount miniature cameras on the referees'
caps and to allow more reporters to roam the sidelines and
interview players coming on and off the field at halftime. The
greatest change, however, will be the comedian in the broadcast
booth, Dennis Miller, the first nonsports announcer ever to join a
major sports telecast.
</P>
<P>
   The criticism that greeted Miller's appointment shows what
Ohlmeyer is up against. ``I thought the game was the
entertainment,'' sneered John Madden of Fox. The purists have a
point: sports remains a staple of network TV, and the NFL is the
single biggest draw. But there is so much product on the air (by
one calculation, 235 hours a day of sports programming pours into
the typical American home) that it's impossible for even the mighty
NFL to maintain its dominance. More than that, sports is losing the
golden demographic it once owned: young men. Forty-seven percent
more of them tuned in to the Monday night telecast of McMahon's
``Raw Is War'' last year than to ``Monday Night Football.''
</P>
<P>
   Sports had always been considered the ultimate formula _ the
original ``reality TV'' that unlike every other type of show on
television never needed reinventing. But the way that Don Ohlmeyer
and Dick Ebersol are attacking the problem this year, even that
notion is being challenged. As former proteges of Roone Arledge at
ABC _ and old friends themselves _ they have made their reputations
as entertainment producers. And in their view, relative to what
else is on television, sports has lost its spark. Viewers love the
highlight reels, but persuading them to sit through an entire game
is getting harder all the time.
</P>
<P>
   How far will they be able to go? Ebersol has a completely
unproved entity in the XFL, but his costs are low and he can get
away with practically anything. Ohlmeyer's advantage is that he has
the NFL, notoriously conservative and fiercely protective of its
game but also far and away the pre-eminent brand in sports, and as
tough and ruthless a competitor as Microsoft.
</P>
<P>
   Don Ohlmeyer glides his black Mercedes sedan through the crowded
streets of Los Angeles toward Dodger Stadium. As he settles into
his regular third-row seat near first base, he admits that it was
frustration with the limitations of sports broadcasting that drove
him into the entertainment side of the business 17 years ago.
``There was a sameness about it,'' he says. ``People have seen
thousands of games. How do you get them to watch my telecast?''
</P>
<P>
   When Ohlmeyer joined Arledge at ``Monday Night Football'' in
1971, the show's second year, it was the only sports program in
prime time. Initially, the network had been reluctant even to fork
out the $8.5 million rights fee to put it on the air. But Arledge,
then president of ABC Sports, promised to make the show like
nothing anybody had ever seen.
</P>
<P>
   He deployed three times as many cameras as other networks and
provided coverage not just of the plays but also of the players
themselves and of the crowd's reactions. The shots of stadium
lights gleaming off the players' helmets, backed by the staccato
voice of Howard Cosell, made even humdrum matchups seem like
once-in-a-lifetime epics. John Lennon, Burt Reynolds, Gov. Ronald
Reagan and Vice President Spiro Agnew made guest appearances. While
other networks lambasted Arledge's ``show biz'' approach to
football, the show became a juggernaut.
</P>
<P>
   ``Monday Night Football'' not only defined how sports was
packaged on television; it also changed forever the economics of
the industry. The major sports leagues, suddenly aware of their
value as prime-time fare, escalated their demands for fees.
</P>
<P>
   In March, Ohlmeyer, who had been happily retired and golfing
every day, agreed to return to ``Monday Night Football,'' on the
condition that he be given complete freedom. On his orders, the
entire staff, except for his old golfing buddy Al Michaels, was
dismissed. During the news conference announcing the moves,
Ohlmeyer talked about wanting to bring ``a sense of danger'' and
``unpredictability'' back to the program, the same elements that
would soon make reality TV the new craze. To the extent that he can
script the game, he will, and he hired a television writer and
producer to help him develop compelling story lines based around
the players and matchups each week.
</P>
<P>
   Finding the right person for the booth took time, but the longer
it dragged on, he realized, the more publicity the show got.
``There would be days when we'd be playing golf and we'd go through
30 different possibilities, everything from President Clinton _
hey, he needs a job _ to guys who are in jail,'' Michaels says.
Ohlmeyer had Billy Crystal, Chris Rock and Dennis Miller on his
list, but he initially thought of the entertainers as hosts of a
souped-up halftime show.
</P>
<P>
   In mid-May, Ohlmeyer received a call from Miller's agent telling
him that Miller wanted to be in the booth. At that time, Rush
Limbaugh was in fact the front-runner for the job; Ohlmeyer saw his
divisiveness as a selling point. ``People used to pay for the
pleasure of throwing a brick through the TV at Howard,'' Ohlmeyer
says. But executives at ABC, including Arledge, made it clear to
Ohlmeyer that picking Limbaugh would be a mistake.
</P>
<P>
   Ohlmeyer figured Miller was ``worth a meeting,'' and after a
promising audition, he emerged as the favorite. The other top
contender was more in the strident Cosell mold: Tony Kornheiser, a
kvetching 52-year-old columnist for The Washington Post who had
gained a surprisingly strong following for his show on ESPN Radio.
But Ohlmeyer believed Miller's iconoclastic image would better
appeal to the key young male demographic. As a courtesy, he called
Tagliabue the week before he made the hire and got his blessing.
The flirtation with Limbaugh had been shrewd. By comparison, even a
comedian was taken seriously by the NFL.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know if I'm the right guy to do this,'' says Miller,
``but I'm a decent roll of the dice.''
</P>
<P>
   Dick Ebersol is a studious, almost grandfatherly man of 53, an
appearance that belies his reputation as the most dangerous man in
the business. His ability to land huge deals before anyone else has
even imagined them made NBC the leader among network sports
divisions over the last decade. But Ebersol never moved quicker
than he did last February, when he saw Vince McMahon on TV
announcing the formation of the XFL, a new eight-team circuit that
would begin play the following winter after the NFL season was
finished.
</P>
<P>
   After bidding good riddance to the NFL, Ebersol had spent the
last 18 months trying to create his own pro football league with
Turner Sports. But he couldn't figure out what would draw viewers
to a league owned by a TV network. The XFL was a little different
from what he had envisioned; it was a ``brand of smash-mouth
football,'' McMahon said, ``not for pantywaists and sissies.''
</P>
<P>
   It wouldn't be scripted like his wrestling programs, McMahon
insisted, but there was no doubt it would be a made-for-television
extravaganza like no other in sports. Cameras and microphones would
be everywhere, including in the locker rooms and in the huddles;
the cheerleaders would not only be the prettiest in football _ they
would also be ``encouraged'' to date the players.
</P>
<P>
   Ebersol was well-acquainted with McMahon. In 1985, they had gone
into business together. Then an independent producer, Ebersol sold
``Saturday Night's Main Event'' to NBC, where it ran for six years,
making both men a fortune and putting wrestling on the map. When
Ebersol rejoined NBC in 1989, he had to sell his stake back to
McMahon, but he had watched as the popularity of the WWF
mushroomed. As Ebersol listened to McMahon that afternoon, he
realized that if he was going to put his reputation on the line and
buy a football league, there was no surer bet. Not only would he
control the content, but producing each game would likely cost less
than NBC paid for a typical three hours of prime-time programming.
</P>
<P>
   By the time McMahon was in his limo heading back to his
Stamford, Conn., headquarters, his cell phone was ringing. It was
Ebersol. ``Don't do anything else yet,'' he told McMahon. Two
months later, they announced the historic deal: NBC was investing
$30 million in the WWF and would be a 50-50 owner of the XFL,
marking the first time a major sports league would share ownership
with a network. The games will be shown weekly on NBC, one of them
as a prime-time lead-in to ``Saturday Night Live,'' the show
Ebersol created in 1975.
</P>
<P>
   Ebersol is not new to controversy. Critics have tarred him for
moves like his decision to show the summer Olympics in Sydney
entirely on tape, so he can package the events as shiny
human-interest dramas for prime-time audiences. But the opprobrium
brought on by the XFL deal was harsher than ever. The New York Post
headlined its story, ``NBC Makes Deal With Devil.'' Even his mentor
thought he'd gone too far. ``At some point you have to decide how
classy you want to be,'' says Arledge.
</P>
<P>
   But if Ebersol has been a visionary about anything, it is deal
making. By becoming a partner in the XFL itself, Ebersol has
declared sports leagues unnecessary middlemen.
</P>
<P>
   Tagliabue says the NFL would never consider gimmicks like
microphones in the huddle. ``Obviously the reason is competitive,''
the commissioner says. ``You can't put strategy on the air for
other teams to watch. This is a game of surprise. We've done focus
groups, and what they tell us is what sells football is the
competition on the field. That's what gives us the No. 1 audience
in sports. It doesn't depend on where the microphones are or who we
interview at halftime. It depends on the national passion for the
game.''
</P>
<P>
   On a humid night in Canton, Ohio, on the last day of July, the
new ``Monday Night Football'' team took to the air for the first
time, a preseason game between the San Francisco 49ers and the New
England Patriots. The telecast opened with a beautifully shot
prepackaged story about rookies trying to make an NFL team;
Michaels described training camp as ``the ultimate game of
'Survivor.'''
</P>
<P>
   When they came back live, Michaels introduced Dennis Miller by
saying that he had ``come to expect the unexpected, but this is off
the charts.'' It may have been the most anticipated moment in the
history of sportscasting. Miller said: ``If there's anyone in this
stadium more pumped up than me, they wouldn't pass the league's
standardized drug test.'' The telecast featured noticeably improved
sound quality of the grunts and groans of players in the trenches,
and the view from the referee cam was revealing.
</P>
<P>
   In the end, though, it all felt very much like a football game _
and a bad one at that. The Patriots won, 20-0.
</P>
<P>
   The biggest challenge Ohlmeyer _ and by extension, all of
professional sports _ face is: How do you make an old, familiar
product seem fresh and new? ``Monday Night Football'' has always
treated the game itself as sacred, and it will this season, too,
even with a comedian in the booth. Commissioner Tagliabue has to be
happy about that. But he won't be if it doesn't boost the ratings.

thought he'd gone too far. ``At some point you have to decide how
classy you want to be,'' says Arledge.
</P>
<P>
   But if Ebersol has been a visionary about anything, it is deal
making. By becoming a partner in the XFL itself, Ebersol has
declared sports leagues unnecessary middlemen.
</P>
<P>
   Tagliabue says the NFL would never consider gimmicks like
microphones in the huddle. ``Obviously the reason is competitive,''
the commissioner says. ``You can't put strategy on the air for
other teams to watch. This is a game of surprise. We've done focus
groups, and what they tell us is what sells football is the
competition on the field. That's what gives us the No. 1 audience
in sports. It doesn't depend on where the microphones are or who we
interview at halftime. It depends on the national passion for the
game.''
</P>
<P>
   On a humid night in Canton, Ohio, on the last day of July, the
new ``Monday Night Football'' team took to the air for the first
time, a preseason game between the San Francisco 49ers and the New
England Patriots. The telecast opened with a beautifully shot
prepackaged story about rookies trying to make an NFL team;
Michaels described training camp as ``the ultimate game of
'Survivor.'''
</P>
<P>
   When they came back live, Michaels introduced Dennis Miller by
saying that he had ``come to expect the unexpected, but this is off
the charts.'' It may have been the most anticipated moment in the
history of sportscasting. Miller said: ``If there's anyone in this
stadium more pumped up than me, they wouldn't pass the league's
standardized drug test.'' The telecast featured noticeably improved
sound quality of the grunts and groans of players in the trenches,
and the view from the referee cam was revealing.
</P>
<P>
   In the end, though, it all felt very much like a football game _
and a bad one at that. The Patriots won, 20-0.
</P>
<P>
   The biggest challenge Ohlmeyer _ and by extension, all of
professional sports _ face is: How do you make an old, familiar
product seem fresh and new? ``Monday Night Football'' has always
treated the game itself as sacred, and it will this season, too,
even with a comedian in the booth. Commissioner Tagliabue has to be
happy about that. But he won't be if it doesn't boost the ratings.

 &HT;    Who's the guy you've got to know in Austin? The AC guy, that's
who
 &HT;    By Mark Lisheron
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas - The most important man in Austin is touring
Robin's new apartment, letting the 90-degree air blowing from each
of the ceiling vents warm his calloused hand.
</P>
<P>
   On the kitchen counter hums a 10-inch plastic fan, the only
cooling implement Robin Schiller and her fiance, Christopher, have
had since their air conditioning unit quit the day before. Chris is
cooling himself at a University of Texas orientation day, leaving
Robin to wait for the most important man in Austin.
</P>
<P>
   Schiller looks upon this man the way one imagines Lazarus'
sister looking upon Jesus (at least Lazarus had a place to keep
cool). He doesn't disappoint. He removes a rusted facing plate from
a unit next to the front door and clamps an amperage meter around a
pipe. Suddenly, and for no reason he can explain, the unit comes to
life.
</P>
<P>
   After he refills a compressor at the back of the North Austin
apartment with Freon, the numbers on the digital thermometer in the
kitchen ceiling vent begin to plummet. Schiller bathes her hands in
the cool air. ``So, is that it?'' she asks, implying that miracles
oughtn't be this ordinary.
</P>
<P>
   ``There it is,'' the most important man in Austin says, looking
at Schiller's face. ``There's the difference between the smile and
the frown. You get the smile when the place starts to cool down.''
</P>
<P>
   On 28 days this summer, the equivalent of February if February
was ever this cruel, the temperature has climbed past 100 degrees.
According to the National Weather Service, the average high
temperature for all of July was 99.4 degrees, and it's 99.7 degrees
so far in August.
</P>
<P>
   Into the Austin-area swamp venture approximately 5,000 air
conditioning repairmen, or technicians, as the Texas Air
Conditioning Contractors Association is wont to refer to them.
</P>
<P>
   Workweeks average between 50 and 60 hours in the summer, helping
a hard-working veteran technician make about $50,000 a year,
according to Nancy Jones, executive director of the association.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't get a lot of good press,'' Jones says. ``Especially
with the kind of summer this has been, it has been tremendously
stressful for our members. People die in this kind of weather. Air
conditioning technicians are true heroes.''
</P>
<P>
   Geoff Hiesler, air conditioning tech, hero and the most
important man in Austin, is listening to what is supposed to be the
address of his next call, but is instead a crackling, broken CB
transmission in his Pronto Service Co. truck.
</P>
<P>
   He presses a Doral into an ashtray so full the butt falls to the
truck floor, trailing smoke behind it. He finishes the last of a
Sam's Choice cola and makes another deposit in the passenger side
footwell. Next to an unopened bag of pork rinds on the seat is a
copy of The Nelson Study Bible.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yeah, I read it, it's something to do between calls,'' he
says. ``It was here when I got the truck. I found out later one of
the guys at work told me he tries to leave one in every truck.
That's the way to do it so you don't try to ram religion down
anyone's throat.''
</P>
<P>
   Although he is not temperamentally inclined to think of himself
as heroic, Hiesler is well-aware of his importance. Before this day
is over he will have visited six homes, each in a particular state
of desperation. Some days he takes 12 calls and doesn't get home to
his wife, Alexandria, and two children, until 10 p.m.
</P>
<P>
   ``You gotta enjoy this business and everything that goes with
it,'' he says, ``or you better get out. People are either screaming
at you or complimenting you.''
</P>
<P>
   Before he leaves for the next call, Phyllis, a Lakeway homeowner
whose 1-year-old compressor failed, has come home to a cool house.
Hiesler has replaced the compressor and reset the thermostats,
while Avery, Phyllis' Yorkie, yaps at him from a safe distance.
</P>
<P>
   ``Look at all these windows,'' Phyllis says. ``We do everything
we can to turn our homes into hotboxes and then complain when the
air goes out. But people just can't live here without air.''
</P>
<P>
   When Hiesler was a boy, he took calls with his father, who
repaired the old gas air conditioners for 31 years for Southern Gas
Co. ``You wouldn't believe it, I'm 31 and I tell people I've been
in the business for 20 years. That's how long I been doing it. I've
lived and breathed it all my life.''
</P>
<P>
   Technically, this isn't true. About five years ago, ground down
by the summers, Hiesler took some training and became an auto
mechanic. The apprenticeship didn't last long.
</P>
<P>
   ``Five thousands dollars worth of tools got stole from me,'' he
says. ``I took it that the good Lord was telling me to go back to
air conditioning.''
</P>
<P>
   The good Lord greets Hiesler at his next stop. In a brown back
yard across from a compressor low on Freon, a plaster Jesus on a
stump looks down on a hand-painted plaster angel. The Blessed
Mother looks out from behind the stump, and around the yard are
scattered various saintly figures.
</P>
<P>
   As he attaches pressure gauge hoses to the nipples on the pipes
of the second compressor, Julieanne, another Lakeway homeowner,
corners Hiesler, fingering a folded check. The date on the check
reads July 12, the date she tells Hiesler the first of four Pronto
technicians attempted to solve her problem. Hiesler listens and
shakes his head, a bead of sweat snapping off the tip of his nose.
</P>
<P>
   ``We (she and her husband, John) have seven children, It's lucky
we have two units,'' she says. ``For a month we were sleeping on
one side of the house. You had people from this company telling us
someone would be there and they wouldn't come and when they did the
problem wasn't fixed.''
</P>
<P>
   Julieanne follows Hiesler into the master bedroom, still
clutching the check. He is on the tips of his steel-toed boots at
the top of a ladder peeking through the ceiling hatch into an
attic, a most evil place.
</P>
<P>
   All manner of vermin may await you under a house. Tarred pea
gravel may roast you on a roof. These are islands of comfort
compared to the suffocating closeness of an attic, crawling on your
belly as a storm of insulation fiber rains down from lifeless air,
closing each and every sweaty pore.
</P>
<P>
   The most important man in Austin counts the seconds, gathering
strength from the silence. The involuntary spasms of the air
conditioning unit Julieanne had reported have mysteriously
subsided. Hiesler steps down, folds the ladder and invokes the
magic incantation.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's cycling off, just the way it's supposed to,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   This visit has restored enough of Julieanne's faith in service
people to shake Hiesler's hand. He rewards her with a receipt that
indicates no charge.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have no way of knowing how much of what she said was true,''
he says. ``You just have to take it with a smile. The first thing
that goes in the heat is the sense of humor. You got a lot of angry
people out there.''
</P>
<P>
   Across the street from where he parks the truck on Wrightwood
Road on the last call of the day is a man wearing no shirt and
sitting in a plastic chair next to the rear end of a rumbling wall
unit air conditioner. The front yard is obscured by beer cans and
bottles; Hiesler is too polite to describe the source of the odor
in the living room.
</P>
<P>
   The motor is going out on this air conditioner, he tells the
man. For the $250 it would cost to replace the motor, the man could
buy a brand-new wall unit, he says.
</P>
<P>
   Hiesler is no whistle-blower, but he says there are some people
in the air conditioning industry who would have done the work.
What's more, there are a few who do work that isn't necessary, he
says.
</P>
<P>
   After his employers at Pronto interviewed Hiesler, he says he
interviewed them. He says he told them he couldn't work for a
company that would ask him to cheat. His father didn't teach him
that way.
</P>
<P>
   The most important man in Austin tells the man to pretend he
didn't stop by.
</P>
<P>
   ``Why charge him $49.95 for a service call to tell him what he
probably already knows,'' Hiesler says, already thinking about the
cold beers he'll have when he gets home. ``You can see he hasn't
got a whole lot of money. I'm not gonna charge him. You gotta think
about things like that.''

 &HT;    Hardest part of replacing a shower head is removing old one
 &HT;    By James Cummings
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   DAYTON, Ohio - A lot of home improvement jobs turn out to be
more complicated than you expect. Others are so easy that one class
at a home-improvement store or 30 minutes helping someone with
experience will teach you all you need to know.
</P>
<P>
   Changing a shower head can fall into either category. The
hardest part is getting the old shower head off. If the old fixture
screws off without any trouble, the whole replacement process will
take less than half an hour. If the old shower head gets stuck, the
job will take more time and elbow grease.
</P>
<P>
   You need a pair of channel-type pliers and an adjustable wrench.
Working with an assistant can be helpful. You'll also need a roll
of Teflon tape.
</P>
<P>
   Home-improvement stores carry a wide selection of shower heads.
Simple replacement shower heads that do the same work as the
original equipment cost as little as $2, but you'll be happier in
the long run with something in the $10 to $30 range.
</P>
<P>
   Low-flow shower heads are designed to cut water and energy
usage. They cut the volume of water through the shower head but
pressurize it so that, theoretically, it feels like you're still
getting about the same amount as with a regular shower head. I
personally don't like low-flow heads because they seem to take
forever to rinse shampoo out of my hair, but they're quite popular
and sell for about $5 to $25.
</P>
<P>
   Massaging shower heads that can be adjusted to pulsating
patterns or fine sprays go for about $25 to $100. They come with
stationary heads or in hand-held models with wands that can direct
the spray to different parts of the body. Less-expensive models
tend to be plain and plastic; more expensive models come in
metallic finishes.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, you can spend quite a bit for an exotic shower head.
One type gives a broad, rain-like spray. Another has twin heads
that spray two parts of the body at once. And you can find
adjustable-height shower heads that move up and down on a bar to
accommodate people of varying sizes.
</P>
<P>
   Also available are shower systems with multiple shower heads
arrayed up the wall of the shower stall. Installing these systems,
though, is probably beyond the skill level of the typical
do-it-yourselfer and should be left to professional plumbers.
</P>
<P>
   Pressure-sensitive showers also are best left to professional
installers, said Ginny Long, a spokeswoman for Moen Inc.
Pressure-sensitive showers adjust themselves to avoid excessive
temperature swings associated with changes in water pressure that
can occur, for example, when a nearby toilet is flushed.
</P>
<P>
   These systems are becoming standard in new construction and in
major bathroom renovations, and cost about 20 percent more than
regular showers, Long said. To install such a system requires
getting behind the wall of the shower enclosure and replacing the
mechanism that mixes hot and cold water.
</P>
<P>
   Another way to reduce scalding risk is to lower the temperature
at the water heater.
</P>
<P>
   To remove an existing shower head, start by wrapping the jaws of
a pair of channel-type pliers or an adjustable wrench with masking
tape. The tape keeps the tools from scratching the finish on the
shower head and shower arm, the angled pipe to which the shower
head is attached.
</P>
<P>
   Use the pliers or wrench to grasp the nut holding the shower
head to the shower arm and apply moderate pressure to loosen it. If
the nut doesn't turn readily, have a helper grasp the shower arm
with a pair of channel-type pliers while you apply more pressure to
the shower-head nut with the wrench. The jaws of both tools should
be wrapped with tape to prevent scratching.
</P>
<P>
   If the shower-arm threads have lime deposits on them, use a
small wire brush dipped in vinegar to clean the threads.
</P>
<P>
   If you want to clean and reuse the old shower head, remove it
and disassemble the portions that can be unscrewed. Poke a stiff
wire or a pipe cleaner through the inlet holes and outlet holes to
clean out deposits. If the shower head has a rubber O-ring, you
should replace it with a new one of the same size.
</P>
<P>
   Flush fresh water through the cleaned head. If it seems usable,
wrap the shower-arm threads with Teflon tape and screw the old head
back on, tightening it with only enough pressure to prevent leaks.
</P>
<P>
   Putting on most new shower heads is a two-step process. Metallic
shower heads require Teflon tape to attach to the shower arm. Some
plastic shower heads don't need tape. Read the installation
instructions.
</P>
<P>
   In cases where tape is required, wrap Teflon tape around the
threads on the shower arm. The tape both lubricates the connection
and helps seal the joint.
</P>
<P>
   The second step is tightening the fastening nut onto the shower
arm. Using one hand to hold the new shower head at the angle you
want it to face, apply moderate pressure to tighten the nut that
holds it to the shower arm. Don't bear down on the wrench to
tighten the nut; the connection should be firm, not tight. Many
plastic shower heads can be tightened by hand and don't need a
wrench or pliers at all. Turn on the water to see if the joint
leaks and tighten it a bit more if it does.

 &HT;    Before you add detergent, get the scoop from your high-tech
washing machine's owner's manual
 &HT;    By James Cummings
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   DAYTON, Ohio - Doing the laundry used to be physically
challenging but intellectually simple: You dragged your stuff to
the nearest stream, wet one item at a time, pounded the stuff on a
rock and spread it on the bank or over a branch to dry.
</P>
<P>
   Automatic washers and dryers have taken most of the physical
labor out of getting our clothes and linens clean, but it now takes
smarts to do the laundry.
</P>
<P>
   The intellectual work starts with understanding the increasingly
complex features of the washers and dryers available on the market
and matching them to your laundry needs and habits. One of the big
variables distinguishing washers and dryers is energy efficiency,
and you may find that your next machines can save you significant
money by using less water, energy and detergent.
</P>
<P>
   Even after you've chosen your machines, the intellectual work
continues with relearning your laundry skills. To get the most out
of your washer and dryer and out of the high-tech fabrics you'll be
washing, you can't approach laundry with the old
beat-everything-on-a-rock mentality.
</P>
<P>
   ``The average consumer knows you don't wash the denim jeans with
the lingerie,'' said textile expert Elizabeth Easter. ``But people
do mix clothes they probably shouldn't.
</P>
<P>
   ``To do laundry well you have to read the owner's manual for
your washer and dryer and understand all their features, and you
have to read and follow the fabric-care labels on your clothes.''
</P>
<P>
   A revolution may be under way in the design of America's washing
machines. The thing that's changing is the wash tub: Almost all of
the washers currently holding EnergyStar ratings for exceptional
energy efficiency have horizontal tubs instead of the more
traditional upright tubs.
</P>
<P>
   Horizontal-axis machines almost always have a door in the front
through which clothes are loaded, so they're commonly known as
front-loading machines. Vertical-axis washers are commonly known as
top loaders.
</P>
<P>
   Charles Samuels, a counsel for the Association of Home Appliance
Manufacturers, said front loaders were fairly popular in the United
States in the 1950s and 1960s. They were particularly prevalent,
and still are found, in coin-operated laundries where their energy
and water savings add to the laundromat's bottom line.
</P>
<P>
   Samuels said the older front-loading machines developed a
reputation for maintenance problems and faded from common use in
the United States. Front loaders remained popular in Europe,
however.
</P>
<P>
   As U.S. consumers have become more interested in energy
conservation, manufacturers have taken a fresh look at
front-loading machines. Samuels said European washers tended to be
smaller than U.S. buyers were used to, so manufacturers had to
develop larger Americanized versions.
</P>
<P>
   The traditional top-loading machine works like this: You load
clothes into a drum with an agitator in the middle and add enough
water to submerge the clothes. The agitator moves from side to side
circulating water and detergent through the clothes until they are
clean.
</P>
<P>
   A front loader doesn't require that clothing be submerged. The
clothes are put in, and the door is closed and sealed. The drum
rotates and fins on the side of the drum lift clothes out of the
water and drop them into the water and detergent solution as they
near the top of the drum.
</P>
<P>
   The plopping action is as effective as agitating in getting
clothes clean, and it's at least as gentle on fabrics. But less
water is used, so the consumer pays less for water and for heating
water.
</P>
<P>
   The Energy Department estimates that the most efficient washers
use almost 50 percent less water and 30 percent to 40 percent less
energy per load than the average washer.
</P>
<P>
   Front-loading machines don't need as much detergent as top
loaders, either, and special detergent formulas just for
front-loading machines are available. Front loaders also may handle
unbalanced loads better.
</P>
<P>
   With those advantages, you'd think the new generation of
front-loading machines would dominate the marketplace. But most
local retailers carry at least five times as many top loaders than
front loaders because front loaders are more expensive.
</P>
<P>
   It's common for front-loading machines to cost more than $500
and to exceed the price of similar size top loaders by as much as
$200. Samuels said the higher prices reflect the fact that front
loaders are more expensive to build.
</P>
<P>
   The machines eventually recoup the extra expense because of
their lower operating costs, but that message apparently hasn't
reached the public yet.
</P>
<P>
   Local appliance sellers say some customers come into their
stores after reading consumer publications, and they know they want
a front-loading machine. Many seem attracted to the prestige of
paying top dollar for the top-of-the-line Maytag Neptune front
loader that sells for $999.
</P>
<P>
   Other customers simply see the higher price tags on front
loaders and walk away. In some communities where excessive energy
and water consumption are critical problems, consumers can get
rebates for buying energy-efficient washers.
</P>
<P>
   There's a proposal before the Congress that might help make the
most energy-efficient appliances more affordable. The Resource
Efficient Appliances Incentives Act of 2000 recently introduced in
the House and Senate would create tax incentives for
high-efficiency clothes washers and refrigerator-freezers from 2001
through 2006.
</P>
<P>
   The bill, if passed, would work in conjunction with federal
efficiency standards proposed by energy advocates, appliance
manufacturers and state and local governments in May. Manufacturers
making appliances exceeding the standard would receive tax credits
of $50 to $100 per unit.
</P>
<P>
   Tom Catania, vice president for government affairs at the
Whirlpool Corp., said the incentive program has bipartisan support
in Congress, and manufacturers and energy conservation advocates
are hopeful it will become law as part of budget appropriations
adopted later this year.
</P>
<P>
   Catania said some manufacturers would use the money to develop
new energy-efficient appliances while others might use the
incentives to lower prices on energy-efficient products already on
the market. But either way, he said, the tax incentives would
increase the available choices of affordable energy-efficient
washers.
</P>
<P>
   Easter teaches textile sciences at the University of Kentucky
and is a consultant for GE Appliances. She said that often the
first issue people consider when shopping for washers and dryers is
capacity.
</P>
<P>
   ``They think of the largest loads they have, and buy
accordingly,'' she said. ``They don't want to have to go to the
laundromat every time they want to wash a comforter.''
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps we'd be better off investing in slightly smaller
machines and accepting an occasional trip to use a commercial
washer for the unusually bulky items we must wash.
</P>
<P>
   Easter said the best way to do laundry is to sort and sort again
until each load contains items of similar color, fabric and soil
level. The clothes should also have matching washing and drying
instructions on their fabric care labels.
</P>
<P>
   The results for most families would be more smaller loads and
fewer big loads that require the machine's full capacities. Of
course, to wash small loads efficiently means lowering the water
level in the washer.
</P>
<P>
   ``People who sort clothes completely are going to be interested
in machines with lots of options for temperature and motion so they
can tailor the cycles to fit the clothes being washed,'' Easter
said.
</P>
<P>
   For example, a load of heavy-duty, heavily soiled white cottons
might require high water temperatures and a vigorous washing motion
followed by an aggressive spin cycle to remove as much water as
possible from the absorbent cotton fibers.
</P>
<P>
   Nylon and polyester clothing, on the other hand, don't hold as
much water and don't need to be wrung out as hard.
</P>
<P>
   Sorting properly also helps when the clothes go from the washer
to the dryer. Polyesters mixed into a load of cottons will be
overdry and wrinkled by the time the whole load is dried.
</P>
<P>
   Here are some features to look for and ideas to consider when
shopping for a washer and dryer:
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Fabric care selections: Look at the labels on the washable
clothes and linens you usually launder and you'll notice you're
being asked to control the force of the agitator, the temperature
of the wash water, the speed of the spin cycle, the heat of the
dryer and so on. Make sure the machines you choose have the
flexibility to adjust to all your fabric requirements.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Controlled water temperature: Automatic washing machines
traditionally have had three settings for water temperature: cold,
warm and hot. The warm setting was usually an equal mix of water
from the hot and cold taps. Modern machines with temperature
controls compensate for variables and always give you the water
temperature you need. For example, the machines may include more
hot water during the warm setting to compensate for the coldness of
the water in the cold pipes. Warm water that's too cold won't
dissolve laundry products effectively.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Variable water level settings: Because not every load you wash
will be a full load, you must be able to customize the water level
to the load. Using too much water is wasteful, while not using
enough may not clean the clothes and damage the washer. Some
machines offer few choices on water level, but it's preferable to
have a machine that lets you make a precise selection.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Soak cycles: This option is useful primarily for households
that regularly have very heavily soiled clothes such as those that
might belong to a mechanic or a soccer player. If you only rarely
have to soak clothes before washing, your machine probably doesn't
need a soak cycle.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Extra rinse setting: Easter said people with unusually
sensitive skin use an extra rinse cycle to remove laundry-product
residue from clothing that will contact their skin. If no one in
the family has sensitive skin, an extra rinse option may not be
needed. Most machines rinse adequately for most people, and extra
rinsing does use extra water and energy.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Exotic agitation: Whirlpool and Sears Kenmore have joined
forces to develop the Kenmore Elite Washer with ``Calypso Wash
Motion,'' one of the few top loading machines to earn an Energy
Star rating. The new machine uses about half the water of a normal
top loader. It has no agitator and washes clothes by spraying them
from above while lifting and bouncing them with a movable plate at
the bottom of the wash tub.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Space saving: Many brands of washers and dryer are designed to
be stacked on top of one another. That can be convenient if your
space is limited, but remember stacked components tend to have
smaller load capacities and they require some extra lifting and
stretching to use.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Drying sensors: Most modern dryers offer the option of drying
clothes for a certain amount of time or drying the clothes until
sensors say they are ready. When used properly, the sensor settings
dramatically improve the efficiency and performance of the dryer.
Some sensors measure the heat coming from the dryer chamber and use
that to guess when the clothes are dry; more modern sensor are
strips that actually feel when the clothes are dry. Sensors work
best when all the clothes in the load are of similar fabrics and
weights. In those cases, all the clothes get dry at about the same
time, and the dryer stops before anything is overdried. The most
common drying mistake is overdrying, which wastes energy and time
and can damage fabrics.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Permanent press drying: Fabrics designed to come out of the
dryer ready to wear will only do that if they're dried correctly.
They also require a cooling-off period between the time most of the
moisture is removed and the time the clothes are removed from the
machine. Before buying a dryer, ask how its permanent-press and
delicate drying cycles work. Some machines get too hot even on
delicate settings and can damage fragile garments such as items
with acrylic webbing. Other machines ``step down'' the temperatures
as permanent press clothes approach dryness to minimize wrinkling.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Gas vs. electric drying: Most of the energy consumed by an
electric dryer goes toward heating air to dry the clothes. Because
natural gas produces heat much more cheaply than electricity
(although prices are rumored to increase dramatically this winter),
a gas dryer is generally more economical. Gas dryers cost slightly
more initially than electric dryers, and you may have to have a gas
line extended from elsewhere in your house to the laundry room. But
in the long run, a gas dryer should save you money. Check
energy-consumption labels on brands you are considering for a
savings estimate.
</P>
<P>
   Cheaper model
</P>
<P>
   might not be
</P>
<P>
   energy bargain
</P>
<P>
   The Federal Trade Commission requires that all washers, dryers
and other major appliances be labeled with a yellow and black
EnergyGuide sticker. The stickers give you an easy basis for
comparing one appliance to another.
</P>
<P>
   The trade commission and U.S. Energy Department recommend that
when you buy an appliance you consider not only the purchase price,
but also the lifetime operating price.
</P>
<P>
   If one washer has a price tag that's $100 less than another,
more efficient model, that washer probably isn't a bargain if the
more efficient model cost $20 less per year to run.
</P>
<P>
   When you shop for one of these appliances in a dealer's
showroom, you should find the EnergyGuide labels hanging on the
inside of an appliance or secured to the outside. The law requires
that the labels specify:
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  The capacity of the particular model.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  For refrigerators, freezers, dishwashers, clothes washers and
water heaters, the estimated annual energy consumption of the
model.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  For air conditioners, heat pumps, furnaces, boilers and pool
heaters, the energy efficiency rating.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  The range of estimated annual energy consumption, or energy
efficiency ratings, of comparable appliances.
</P>
<P>
   Some appliances also may feature the EnergyStar logo, which
means that the appliance is significantly more energy efficient
than the average comparable model.
</P>
<P>
   For more information on the EnergyStar program, operated by the
Department of Energy and the Environmental Protection Agency, visit
the EnergyStar Web site at www.energystar.gov.
</P>
<P>
   Manufacturers must use standard test procedures developed by the
Department of Energy to prove the energy use and efficiency of
their products, and those test results are what go on EnergyGuide
labels. Many companies have these tests performed by independent
laboratories.

&HT;     KNOW YOUR WEAKNESSES, BEFORE AND AFTER THE JOB INTERVIEW 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By DAVE MURPHY  
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ If you want to understand why relying too much
on job interviews is an idiotic way to hire people, think about one
of the all-time favorite interview questions and how conventional
wisdom says you should answer it.
</P>
<P>
   ``What's your biggest weakness?'' If you ask this and let the
applicant give a pat answer, you're wasting your time. If you stop
and think about it, anyone you hire who seriously believes in one
of those cliched answers would have a complete lack of
self-awareness and self-discipline.
</P>
<P>
   Probably not what you had in mind.
</P>
<P>
   So what IS your biggest weakness? A lot of job-hunting experts
say applicants should answer with something innocuous, with one
possible answer being that they work too hard and don't know when
to stop.
</P>
<P>
   If an applicant says his biggest problem is being a workaholic,
you probably will just move on and not give it another thought.
After all, it's not like he said something that would be a real
problem, like ``I just love to embezzle money'' or ``I can't keep
my hands off of co-workers'' or even ``I have no weaknesses. I am
the messiah, here to wash away your sins, cure world hunger and
wipe out Old Navy commercials.''
</P>
<P>
   But this time, just for the heck of it, give the answer another
thought. It can mean one of three things:
</P>
<P>
   _ He thinks you are easily snowed.
</P>
<P>
   If this is someone you're sincere about hiring, the interview is
the beginning of a long-term relationship. Do you really want your
subordinates to think you're that big of a sucker?
</P>
<P>
   _ He has you confused with a therapist.
</P>
<P>
   Those who are truly workaholics do have a serious problem. They
are so focused on work that they have lost touch with reality, and
it has the potential to destroy their families and personal lives.
</P>
<P>
   But someone who does see that as a serious problem and has any
sense at all would get therapy or enroll in a 12-step program or
talk about it with close friends, not offer it as an answer to some
cliched job interview question. It's too personal to share with
someone you barely know, much less a prospective employer.
</P>
<P>
   Certainly some prospects, including recovering workaholics,
might say they want to limit themselves to a 40-hour workweek, but
they would consider that a lifestyle choice, not a weakness.
</P>
<P>
   _ He sincerely thinks that is his biggest weakness.
</P>
<P>
   OK, so you hire him. And then, being a talented worker, he
strives to overcome his biggest weakness. Where does that leave
you?
</P>
<P>
   Let's see. His biggest weakness is that he works too hard. How,
oh how, can he overcome that? Maybe he could work less. That's it!
</P>
<P>
   Congratulations. You've hired someone who has already peaked.
You get to join him for that long downhill ride to retirement.
</P>
<P>
   More than likely, though, he has bigger weaknesses, but he's
oblivious to them. That means he probably has an inflated view of
his own work or will resist you if you discover weaknesses down the
road.
</P>
<P>
   The same thing is true if the applicant offers up any sort of
innocuous weakness; he's either snowing you or is clueless. Take
your pick.
</P>
<P>
   Another way applicants dodge the question is to point to some
past weakness, and how they've overcome it. That reminds me of a
wisecrack a friend used to make when we were teen-agers. ``I used
to be conceited,'' he'd say, ``but now I'm perfect.''
</P>
<P>
   Pin the applicant down to get a real answer, or don't bother
asking the question.
</P>
<P>
   Good workers know they have weaknesses. They strive to overcome
them. That's what makes them good workers, rather than complacent
workers.
</P>
<P>
   From a worker's standpoint, understanding your weaknesses is
crucial to moving ahead.
</P>
<P>
   Unless you know your weaknesses, you won't know what things you
need to improve upon or work around. Sometimes the best way to
handle a weakness is to team up with someone who complements you.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe you're a wonderful saleswoman who's lousy when it comes to
paperwork. Sure, you could make yourself a better paper pusher, but
it might be better to hire a detail-oriented assistant, so you can
spend more time doing what you do best: selling.
</P>
<P>
   It's all about turning something weak into something strong.
That applies to job interview questions, too.

   Entertainment and culture stories from The N.Y. Times News
Service for Thursday, Aug. 31.
</P>
<P>
   CATSKILLS (Monticello, N.Y.) _ The Catskills have always been
synonymous with comedy, with the shtick and shpritz of Sid Caesar,
Jerry Lewis and Mel Brooks. But the glorious mountains here and the
flavorful summertime crowds they drew have also proved to be a
fertile ground for more thoughtful dramas, fiction and films about
love, betrayal, even struggles with faith. This Jewish world of the
Catskills seems to be accumulating something of a genre worthy of
serious literary and cinematic study. By Joseph Berger.
</P>
<P>
   BOLSHOI-DIRECTOR (Moscow) _ In the latest twist to years of
artistic and administrative turmoil, Vladimir Vasilyev was
dismissed as director of the Bolshoi Theater, Russia's premier
opera and ballet company, in a decree signed on Monday by President
Vladimir Putin. By Sophia Kishkovsky.
</P>
<P>
   CHINA-CARTOONISTS (Beijing) _ Stan Lee and the famous characters
he helped create in the heyday of Marvel Comics, including
Spider-Man, the Incredible Hulk and the X-Men, are scarcely known
in China. But his company recently formed a partnership with a
leading Japanese producer of animation to market Lee's Web-based
animated series and associated products in Asia. By Erik Eckholm.
</P>
<P>
   KNOX-BOOK-REVIEW (Undated) _ ``The Knox Brothers,'' a family
biography by the late Penelope Fitzgerald, one of the most
remarkable British novelists of the past half-century, is well
worth notice. Reviewed by Richard Eder.

&HT;     TEXAS COWPOKE ENJOYS HIS AMBASSADORIAL ROLE 
</HEADLINE>

 &HT;     c.2000 San Antonio Express-News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   BANDERA, Texas _ It doesn't take a rope and a whip to get
foreigners to visit Texas, but they sure help.
</P>
<P>
   The traditional tools of cowboys are public relations devices in
the gifted hands of Kevin Fitzpatrick, a trick roper who serves as
an international ambassador for the Lone Star State.
</P>
<P>
   Fitzpatrick, 42, this year has cracked bullwhips at Canadians
and lassoed Swiss conventioneers on trips arranged by the San
Antonio Convention and Visitors Bureau and the Texas Department of
Economic Development.
</P>
<P>
   Fitzpatrick's friendly demeanor and playful antics have only
enhanced the international love affair with the American cowboy.
</P>
<P>
   ``He really ropes them in,'' said Gwen Spain, of the state
economic development agency.
</P>
<P>
   Gerlinde VanWerdt of the convention and visitors bureau said
there is more to Fitzpatrick than fancy tricks and cowboy looks.
</P>
<P>
   ``People really like him,'' she said. ``He's very personable. He
smiles and talks to everybody.''
</P>
<P>
   Fitzpatrick said he loves meeting new people and promoting
Texas, a job for which he is not paid. Only his expenses are
covered.
</P>
<P>
   While on duty, he doesn't develop a thick drawl, feign having
bowlegs or put on other airs to fulfill expectations of the cowboy
image.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm always myself,'' he said. ``I've always been a polite
person and had manners. I don't dip or chew or smoke or cuss.''
</P>
<P>
   It doesn't hurt that he comes from Bandera, the town in the Hill
Country northwest of San Antonio that bills itself as ``The Cowboy
Capital of the World.'' People here are happy to call him one of
their own.
</P>
<P>
   ``Kevin is not just a show cowboy. He's a real cowboy. He keeps
his horses, he ropes on his range and he's got cattle,'' said
Patricia Moore, of the Bandera County Convention and Visitors
Bureau.
</P>
<P>
   Fitzpatrick honed his skills working at festivals, rodeos, dude
ranches and parties around Texas over the past two decades.
</P>
<P>
   His horse, Wet, is a big part of his local act, but doesn't make
the out-of-country tours.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can get on a horse seven different ways, like they do in the
movies,'' Fitzpatrick said in a rare display of self-promotion.
</P>
<P>
   He is impressive nonetheless performing solo, whether jumping
through roomy lassos, rolling lassos across his shoulders or
dancing as lassos whirl around his feet.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, he and some roping friends gathered at the Dixie Dude
Ranch, where Fitzpatrick was hired as a ranch hand in 1980 and
still appears regularly.
</P>
<P>
   Joining Fitzpatrick for a little friendly competition was trick
roper Fred Schneider, a native of Germany.
</P>
<P>
   Also on hand was Nathalie Menu, a trick roper on vacation from
France, where she recently began teaching the Texas two-step at her
dance studio.
</P>
<P>
   Schneider and Fitzpatrick competed last year in Munich to see
who could do the most Texas skips in one minute. They tied, each
jumping back and forth 79 times through a spinning lasso.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike Fitzpatrick, who has made a living from his roping for a
decade, Schneider has a real job and does rope tricks for fun.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you see me on a horse, I look silly,'' said Schneider, 45.
``If you see Kevin on a horse, he looks homogeneous. The horse, the
rope and Kevin are one.''
</P>
<P>
   Clay Conoly, the dude ranch's manager, called Fitzpatrick a
natural choice for cowboy ambassador.
</P>
<P>
   ``He even drinks Lone Star Beer, God help him,'' he said.

COOLMAX TAKES ON TORRID TEXAS SUMMER
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients)

<TEXT>
<P>
   Fashion magazines and catalogs have been featuring wool and
cuddly knits for weeks now. Meantime, we swelter through the long
Texas summer. It ends in October? Right?
</P>
<P>
   While the rest of the world begins to bundle up, we are still in
search of the perfect summer clothes.
</P>
<P>
   We turn to CoolMax, the fabric DuPont introduced for sportswear.
No longer is CoolMax reserved for the gym or the golf course. This
summer, we've seen it show up in dresses, skirts, cardigans and
T-shirts suitable for the office. We've seen it in Casual Friday
polo shirts for guys, too.
</P>
<P>
   CoolMax, a fabric of Dacron fiber, is very lightweight; it
resists wrinkles, wicks moisture away quickly and dries much faster
than cotton. All of that makes it a great pick for a summer fabric.
Plus, it's great to stash in a suitcase. It unpacks ready to wear,
and it can be washed in a hotel-room sink and hung to dry without
needing to be ironed.
</P>
<P>
   Ah, we love the simple things in life. For now, forget the wool.
Our favorite spot for finding street-smart CoolMax is
www.travelsmith.com.

 &HT;    Hardaway says no love is in the air
 &HT;    By Dave George
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. - The love of money is the root of all
evil, the scriptures say, but Tim Hardaway has his own
interpretation.
</P>
<P>
   Love is money, he believes, or so it is implied in the angry
avalanche of words he's pouring over reporters in Hawaii. There, in
paradise with the U.S. Olympic basketball team, the Miami Heat
point guard purports to be in purgatory.
</P>
<P>
   Free agency isn't supposed to be this frustrating for a
five-time All-Star like Timmy. Free agency is supposed to be a time
to savor, a time to be courted by NBA teams with championship
dreams, a time to ask for the moon, or at least the monetary
equivalent of what it took to send Neil Armstrong there.
</P>
<P>
   Something changed for Hardaway, however, something he can't see
and won't acknowledge. He got hurt, repeatedly. He got old,
inevitably. And he became, consequently, more of a health risk than
a supernatural contract reward warrants.
</P>
<P>
   ``I deserve a lot more respect than I'm getting,'' Hardaway
said, popping off about being made to wait on a new deal from Pat
Riley. ``I'm getting no love from the Miami Heat.''
</P>
<P>
   Love makes the world go 'round, the songwriter says, but
Hardaway has his own interpretation. Love makes the world revolve
around him, the hustling hero who has pushed his 6-foot body to
such heights over 11 NBA seasons that there's just got to be a $20
million lifetime achievement award in it.
</P>
<P>
   Now he's threatening, against his agent's advice, to sign a
one-year bargain basement deal with Indiana. He's playing in the
Olympics all next month, a deeply satisfying career highlight, and
asking the Heat to accept his personal guarantee that the
additional wear and tear on his knees and various other body parts
won't lead to another post-season breakdown.
</P>
<P>
   Friday is Hardaway's 34th birthday. Three more seasons seems a
perfectly reasonable goal to him, and at a very high level of
competition. Of course, it also seemed possible to him several
years back that the Heat might earn the everlasting honor of
knocking off the Chicago Bulls while Michael Jordan still was in
uniform. This is the aggressive attitude you want in your point
guard. In fact, it's probably what Riley loves most about the guy.
</P>
<P>
   Oops, there's that word again. Love, in Hardaway's mind, means
never having to say you're all tapped out making other big deals
this summer. Pay me back, it means, for taking less to sign a
four-year deal with Miami in 1996 than might have been available in
Houston or New York. You owe me, big time, even though it really
was Gary Payton you wanted all along.
</P>
<P>
   Funny thing is, all this ranting is almost certainly irrelevant.
The Heat aren't about to make any further personnel moves until the
Brian Grant trade is official, a formality that should be announced
this week. Only then will Riley turn his attention to Miami's proud
point man, unbound by salary cap concerns thanks to the wiggle room
allowed in the re-signing of a returning player.
</P>
<P>
   When Hardaway finally gets happy, it will be because the Heat
need him, not because they love him. If respect and genuine
affection alone were enough to protect a player, P.J. Brown would
have stayed on Riley's roster forever.
</P>
<P>
   One other thing will heal this breach. Hardaway might not love
Riley right now, but he needs the Heat right back.

&HT;     RUNNING GAME IS KEY FOR THE 49ERS 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By KEVIN LYNCH  
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ The focus of the 49ers offense shouldn't be on
Terrell Owens, Jerry Rice, Jeff Garcia, Rick Mirer, J.J. Stokes or
Tai Streets _ even though they have proven worthy. The constant
emphasis on the team's passing game misses the point.
</P>
<P>
   The 49ers are a run team. That's what they do best and that's
where the focus of their offense should lie. If the team wants to
eke out every inch of success they can muster this year, they'll do
it by running.
</P>
<P>
   The team seems bound by tradition to hoist the ball skyward even
when logic dictates otherwise. The 49ers led the league in rushing
yardage and average yards per carry last year.
</P>
<P>
   Yet the team only rushed the ball 418 times. Twenty-one teams
rushed the ball more often, including Buffalo, which ran 101 more
times than the 49ers.
</P>
<P>
   Run naysayers say the 49ers were forced to pass last season
because they fell behind early in many of their games. But several
times, the 49ers abandoned the run far too soon.
</P>
<P>
   The offense's most talented player last year was running back
Charlie Garner, who darted and shimmied his way to 1,229 yards and
an impressive 5.1 yards per carry average. That's the highest
yardage per tote of the top 20 rushers from 1999.
</P>
<P>
   While Garner deserves credit for his production, the 49ers also
led the league a year earlier with Garrison Hearst, when he romped
for a franchise record 1,502 rushing yards.
</P>
<P>
   Truth be told, the most talented players on offense the last few
years are not Hearst, Garner or even Steve Young. A strong argument
could be made for the guys with their bellies flowing over their
trousers. We're talking Ray Brown, Chris Dalman, Greg Clark,
Derrick Deese and Dave Fiore.
</P>
<P>
   These are the guys who brush aside defensive linemen and bowl
over linebackers so that Garner and Hearst can run unimpeded. They
could be the best run-blocking unit in the NFL right now, even
though Dalman will miss the season with a neck injury.
</P>
<P>
   His replacement, Jeremy Newberry, isn't as experienced, but he's
a more imposing physical player, which could make the 49ers even
better in the run game.
</P>
<P>
   Just ask Jonas Lewis and Travis Jervey, players with resumes
devoid of impressive NFL rushing credentials. But, by the end of
preseason, Lewis was the division's leading rusher in exhibition
yards, and Jervey was averaging 4.8 per carry.
</P>
<P>
   And the 49ers could use a strong running game right now. Even
though the defense is improved, they're still vulnerable. By
running and controlling the clock, the 49ers would keep opposing
defenses on the sidelines.
</P>
<P>
   Also, the strategy could protect Garcia, who's still learning
the offense. Garcia could be more effective if he threw less. It
would mean fewer interceptions and sacks.
</P>
<P>
   And should defenses gear up to stop the 49ers' run, the passing
game would open up like a blooming rose. Single coverage on the
49ers talented corps of wide receivers would abound.
</P>
<P>
   Keeping the ball on the ground could also slow down the blitz,
which shackled the passing game and led to sacks, interceptions and
the career-ending concussion to Steve Young. The right running
plays can burn the blitz.
</P>
<P>
   Running will also benefit an offensive line that only returns
Brown to the same position (right guard) he played last season.
Offensive lines love to run, and there's no better way to establish
chemistry among the group.
</P>
<P>
   Even the great 49ers offenses of the past ran more than most
realize. Of the 49ers' five championship teams, four finished the
regular season with more rushes than passes, including the 1981
club.
</P>
<P>
   With Joe Montana and renowned wide receivers Freddie Solomon and
Dwight Clark, the team ran 560 times and passed 517.
</P>
<P>
   Success with the run is also evident in the more recent era
under coach Steve Mariucci. He wisely decided to run the ball after
Rice and Young were injured in the 1997 season opener.
</P>
<P>
   Despite being without Rice, the 49ers went to the NFC title game
that season, the farthest any Mariucci coached team has ventured.
</P>
<P>
   The current team's run game is no passing fancy, and if the
49ers are wise they'll use it _ often.

S&AMP;P 500'S RISE OFFERS SCANT EVIDENCE OF BROAD NEW RALLY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By STEVEN SYRE AND CHARLES STEIN  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   You may have noticed the Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 stock index is
quietly inching toward record territory, modest though it is, in
these waning days of summer.
</P>
<P>
   Our first thought: that broadening market trend pundits keep
talking about, said to be widening Wall Street's circle of winners,
must be pushing lots of stocks higher to elevate the S&AMP;P near a
record.
</P>
<P>
   But when we looked closely, it was hard to find any evidence of
a broader rally producing more winners among the stocks that
currently make up that single, though important, stock index. The
breadth of gains inside the S&AMP;P 500 this year is virtually
unchanged from the performance of 1999.
</P>
<P>
   Though the S&AMP;P 500 is 18 points away from an all-time high of
1527 set in March, this is not turning out to be a banner year for
the index. The S&AMP;P 500 has gained 2.8 percent so far in 2000, far
below its 21 percent advance of last year but much better than the
decline of more than 9 percent it had suffered in the first months
of this year.
</P>
<P>
   Market analysts prefer broadly advancing stock markets, like the
bullish tide of 1995 that raised a large majority of S&AMP;P 500 stocks
and pushed the overall index up 37.6 percent that year.
</P>
<P>
   That kind of activity is considered more stable and much
healthier than markets propelled by a few high-flying stocks that
can mask a malaise _ or outright losses _ among a large percentage
of other equities.
</P>
<P>
   This much is true in 2000 so far: There are more different types
of stocks making gains in the S&AMP;P 500. There is also some evidence
of a larger number of advancing S&AMP;P stocks since the spring and
broadening gains may in fact be taking place in the overall market.
</P>
<P>
   ``My feeling is that last year there was a very narrow rise in
stock prices because there was only one kind of stock driving the
index, technology,'' said Hugh Johnson of First Albany Corp. ``This
year it's not just tech, but other sectors are involved.''
</P>
<P>
   But in this case, the similarities between one year and the next
are much more striking than any evidence of changing tides (One
important detail in the way we measured S&AMP;P 500 stocks: we followed
only the stocks that currently make up the index, including some
that were added in 1999 or earlier this year).
</P>
<P>
   So far this year, a total of 242 stocks in the S&AMP;P 500 have
posted some sort of gain for investors. The same group produced 243
stocks that were in the black throughout all of 1999.
</P>
<P>
   For the most part, similarly ranked stocks of this year and 1999
produced gains or losses that closely resembled each other. For
example, FleetBoston Financial Corp. is the S&AMP;P 500's 179th
best-performing stock so far this year with a return of 14 percent.
The same group's 179th rank stock of 1999, Unocal Corp., earned
14.99 percent.
</P>
<P>
   That kind of parity, or at least something close to it, held
true through more than 400 places on each year's list.
</P>
<P>
   Performance was dramatically different on the top of the list,
where gains were much higher last year. That mostly reflectedly
hyper-growth that propelled smaller companies into the S&AMP;P 500 for
the first time.
</P>
<P>
   Each of the top five gainers for 1999 were added to the index
that year or in 2000. They include technology hotshots like
Qualcomm Inc. (up 2,619 percent), JDS Uniphase (ahead by 830
percent), and Sapient Corp. of Cambridge, Mass. (up 403 percent).
</P>
<P>
   Top performers in the S&AMP;P 500 so far this year represent a
broader slice of the market, including the expected technology
industry hotshots as well as other companies like Reebok Inc. of
Canton, Mass. and Nabisco Group Holdings Inc.
</P>
<P>
   They also have generated more muted returns. The top S&AMP;P 500
stock so far this year, Scientific-Atlanta Inc., is up about 187
percent in 2000 to date.
</P>
<P>
   There are a handful of industries with S&AMP;P 500 stocks that
clearly have performed well this year, especially drugs, biotech,
and utilities.
</P>
<P>
   But others still can't get anyone to pay attention, despite
attractive valuations caused by weak stock prices.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nobody cares about the industrial companies,'' said value
investor Scott Black of Delphi Management in Boston. ``People worry
if the economy close that their earnings power will collapse in a
lot of these companies. And nobody gets excited over 5 to 7 percent
growth.''
</P>
<P>
   Of course, the S&AMP;P 500 index only represents a slice of the
stock market and many strategists, like Ned Riley of State Street
Global Advisors, argue that the important shift has begun among the
hottest technology stocks in the Nasdaq index.
</P>
<P>
   He notes that some investment money hot for New Economy
companies has tapered off, but probably continues to chase some
stocks too aggressively.

   GOOD-JUNK (Undated) _ The pin on Mimi Mannix's hat said it all.
``Junk 'til you drop'' it read, which is why Ms. Mannix was outside
the Strudel Haus in Covington, Ky., on a Thursday afternoon
painting a giant pig. Like a multitude of less colorful people, Ms.
Mannix, an Indiana collectibles dealer had come to this musty
little town across the Ohio River from Cincinnati to shop. ``I'm
selling, I'm buying, I'm doing my pig,'' Ms. Mannix said, dipping
into a vat of pink enamel. ``I'm having fun.'' Here at the
northernmost tip of an annual event known as the 450-Mile Route 127
Corridor Sale, it was no wonder why. A banner spanning Main Street
hailed, ``Welcome to the start of the world's largest yard sale.''
On the reverse it said, ``Welcome to the end of the world's largest
yard sale.'' Covington was the final destination if you started
your journey at the other end, 450 miles away in Gadsden, Ala. Like
everything about this multistate flea market, it was all in how you
looked at it. By Frank DeCaro.

   SPOTLIGHT ON ... &QL; 
Grady Spears
</P>
<P>
   Age: 32 &QL; 
Hometown: Fort Worth, Texas &QL; 
Profession:Executive chef/co-owner, Reata Restaurants in Beverly
Hills and Alpine and Fort Worth, Texas. Author of ``A Cowboy in the
Kitchen,'' with Robb Walsh and ``Cowboy Cocktails,'' with Brigit L.
Binns. &QL; 
Food background: Never in his wildest dreams did Spears think he'd
be a chef someday. Spears started out busing tables at a restaurant
in Fort Worth and then went on to become a waiter (he could make
more money waiting tables than he ever did as a cowboy or cattle
buyer). Eventually he took a job managing a vegetarian restaurant
in Houston and from there moved on to manage the restaurant at the
Gage Hotel in Marathon in the Trans-Pecos region of Texas. It was
desolate, but he fell in love with the area.
</P>
<P>
   Two weeks after he arrived, on a Saturday night, the hotel
restaurant cook walked out with 90 people waiting to eat. There was
no other place to eat within a 60-mile radius, so Spears was forced
to go into the kitchen. ``That was my introduction to cooking 10
years ago,'' noted Spears, who has been a cowboy chef ever since.
</P>
<P>
   In 1994, he left the Gage in hopes of opening his own
restaurant. It became a reality when he and two partners opened
Reata (named for the Texas ranch in Edna Ferber's book _ and the
1956 movie _ ``Giant'') in a restored 1880s house in Alpine, Texas,
in 1995 featuring West Texas cowboy cuisine. In 1996, the trio
opened a Reata in Fort Worth, followed by Reata Restaurant in
Beverly Hills earlier this year.
</P>
<P>
   In 1998, the self-taught Spears was named one of the top five
new chefs in the country by Restaurants and Institutions Magazine.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
Cooking style: Unpolished and rich _ comfort food with a rural
twist.
</P>
<P>
   !Most popular dish he makes: Chicken fried steak. &QL; 
Favorite thing to cook and eat: Rib eye steaks or any kind of
beef. &QL; 
Favorite foods: Fried chicken and street food in Mexico. &QL; 
Favorite junk food: Monster tacos at Jack in the Box; chocolate
chip cookie dough ice cream. &QL; 
Secret food passion: Lone Star beer. &QL; 
Favorite kitchen gadget: Mandoline (a slicing tool) and food mill. &QL; 
Pet peeve: Bad service. &QL; 
Favorite cookbook: ``Feast of Life'' by Patricia Quintana. &QL; 
Ideal vacation: Fishing on the Texas coast. &QL; 
Favorite restaurant: Gramercy Tavern in New York; Caro restaurant
in Fort Worth (which makes fantastic puffy tostadas that are like
corn chips). &QL; 
What does he do when he's not cooking?: Goes fishing. &QL; 
If he couldn't be a restaurant chef and owner, what would he be?: A
cowboy. &QL; 
Worst kitchen disaster: At the opening night of Reata Restaurant in
Alpine, Texas, all of the electricity went out for three hours (an
hour before opening) because of a huge fuse blow-out. He lighted a
lot of candles in the restaurant. Although his cooking wasn't
affected (because the kitchen was equipped with gas), he didn't
have a lot of light to see what he was doing. He served 120 people
for two hours _ and then the lights finally came back on. &QL; 
If he could dine with anyone (current or in history) who would it
be?: George W. Bush. (Spears cooked a totally Texas Christmas
dinner in the Governor's Mansion in Austin for the Bushes one
year.) &QL; 
Most memorable meal: Eating suckling pig at Cliff Teinert's ranch
in West Texas six or seven years ago.

RUSTLE UP SOME DARN GOOD EATS 
ART AVAILABLE
</HEADLINE>
  (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By NATALIE HAUGHTON 
c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The stampede is on. Texas-style Cowboy cooking has arrived in
Los Angeles _ in a big way at Reata Restaurant in Beverly Hills
which opened six months ago.
</P>
<P>
   They serve up plenty of simple, unpretentious and flavorful fare
_ some with a contemporary twist in an atmosphere filled with
cowboy memorabilia and western art _ from sculptures and murals to
saddles, cowboy hats, boots and more.
</P>
<P>
   You'll find large portions of things like charbroiled rib eye,
pan-seared pepper crusted tenderloin with port wine sauce,
smothered Texas T-Bone topped with cacciota cheese enchiladas,
chicken fried steak, mashed potatoes, cream gravy, venison ribs
with apricot glaze, calf fries with spicy tomato gravy and more on
the menu.
</P>
<P>
   Now it's feasible to rustle up some of those down-to-earth
cowboy style creations at home with the help of the restaurant's
chef/co-owner Grady Spears. And what better time than for upcoming
Labor Day parties and festivities.
</P>
<P>
   In Spears' cookbook, ``A Cowboy in the Kitchen,'' (Ten Speed
Press; $29.95), co-authored with Robb Walsh, an Austin-based food
journalist, you'll find recipes that, for the most part, feature
readily accessible ingredients. Spears has taken cowboy recipes,
the kind of food you'd get from the back of a chuck wagon, along
with regional ingredients, added his own quirky nuances and a dash
of Southwest flavor _ and the result is real food for real people.
</P>
<P>
   ``My cooking style is rustic, rural comfort food,'' says Spears.
``I'm not a chef. I'm just a cowboy in the kitchen.'' His food has
chuck wagon, Mexican, American, country, rural and cowboy
influences.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't count calories. I'd much rather have something taste
good and look bad than look good and taste bad. Taste is most
important. I don't spend 20 minutes to build a tower for looks.''
</P>
<P>
   Grady, a former cowboy, started cooking by a fluke when the chef
walked out at the Gage Hotel in Marathon, Texas, a decade ago. From
there went on to create _ with two business partners _ the first
Reata Restaurant in Alpine, Texas, followed by a second in Fort
Worth _ and now a third in Beverly Hills.
</P>
<P>
   When it comes to cooking cowboy fare at home, Spears is quick to
point out, that ``recipes are just guidelines _ they are not the
Bible. If you line up 10 jalapenos or cut into 10 rib eyes _ they
are all different.'' You'll need to adjust recipes to suit the
ingredients and personal tastes. ``A dish will always taste
different every time you make if you're using fresh ingredients _
because the ingredients are different.''
</P>
<P>
   Spears has learned from the cooking classes he teaches around
the country that `people are really intimidated by food.'' But the
bottom line, he tells students, is, ``If it (something you cook)
doesn't work out, throw it out. It's not that big a deal. The sun
is going to shine tomorrow.'' By teaching comfort food (mostly
recipes from his cookbook) _ or food that people can relate to _ he
hopes to make people more comfortable in the kitchen.
</P>
<P>
   In his continuing efforts to show people that food is
approachable, in October, he'll be filming and sharing his tricks
of the trade in a television show, ``A Cowboy in the Kitchen,''
which is scheduled to air on The Food Network later this year. And
he's also working on another cookbook.
</P>
<P>
   Another Texas restaurateur, Tom Perini, also addresses cowboy
cooking in his recently released book ``Texas Cowboy Cooking,''
(Time Life Books; $24.95). ``I'm really a cowboy cook,'' says
Perini, who started out as a rancher, running the family cattle
business, but traded it to become a restaurateur on the same
640-acre ranch in 1983 after catering for a number of years for a
number of big ranches for their cowboys and guests.
</P>
<P>
   Perini's volume, filled with color photographs, celebrates the
culinary history of the Texas cowboy with recipes from chuck-wagon
cooks, ranchers' wives and his restaurant _ Perini Ranch Steakhouse
in Buffalo Gap, 15 miles south of Abilene in west central Texas, a
town with a population of 499. ``We're definitely a mom-and-pop
operation which serves mainly steak (ribeye is the most popular
cut) along with pork ribs and chicken.'' The restaurant averages
about 300 dinners nightly on the weekends, when a reservation is
necessary.
</P>
<P>
   The food at his restaurant, which is set up like a ranch cook
shack, he notes ``is a spinoff of the old chuck-wagon and ranch
food.'' What makes his food different from the food at Reata, he
says, is that he cooks with 100 percent mesquite.
</P>
<P>
   ``Reata is probably more upscale,'' Perini says, adding that he
is not into creative dishes fashioned by a chef. ``I don't believe
in doing anything at 45 degree angles and have no cute names on the
menu. I don't do any plate drawing, where they drizzle sauces to
paint your dish.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want food that looks and tastes good and is recognizable. We
do simple food seasoned with salt, pepper and a little garlic.''
</P>
<P>
   In the case of green beans, he uses a small amount of bacon
drippings. He also serves lots of red beans, and green chile
hominy, a wonderful way to have a starch, is one of his signature
dishes.
</P>
<P>
   When it comes to beef, the restaurant cuts all its own meat _
and only seasons it with dry rubs. ``That's the great thing about
beef: it doesn't need some fancy preparation to be delicious,''
says Perini. Although sauce is available at the restaurant, the
only time he personally uses it on beef is when it is overcooked.
For maximum tenderness and juiciness, Perini eats beef medium rare
_ and he recommends not cooking it beyond medium.
</P>
<P>
   His recipes reflect the simple pleasures of Texas cowboy and
ranch life. ``They're not fancy; they're just good home cooking,''
says Perini, who has been honored to cook real Texas food at the
James Beard House in New York three times in the last five years.
</P>
<P>
   When someone called him from there in 1995, he didn't return the
phone call for a couple of days, thinking they had called the wrong
person. When he did, he asked, ``Do you think (with the name
`Perini') we are some fancy Italian place? Do you know who we
are?'' Of course the caller did, and the rest is history. He also
has cooked for the Bushes in Austin and for Fess Parker at his
winery in Los Olivos, Calif.
</P>
<P>
   The book is sprinkled with personal anecdotes and lore as well
as historical facts. Perini hopes the recipes will reawaken
consumers' tastebuds and stir their memories so they'll want to
make dishes like pot roast and chicken fried steak again.
</P>
<P>
   Any of these inspirations from Spears or Perini would be great
for Labor Day celebrations or backyard parties any time of year. &QL;

 &QL; 
 &QL; 
GRILLED STRIP STEAK WITH CILANTRO BUTTER
</P>
<P>
   They call this a ``New York strip'' in Kansas City and a
``Kansas City strip'' in New York. The strip steak, or top loin, is
the cut that forms the bigger side of a porterhouse or T-bone. &QL; 
1/4 cup Worcestershire sauce &QL; 
1/4 cup olive oil &QL; 
4 strip steaks (about 14 ounces each) &QL; 
4 teaspoons Reata Grill Blend (recipe follows) &QL; 
4 slices Cilantro Butter (recipe follows) &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Prepare and heat grill. Mix Worcestershire sauce and olive oil
in a shallow pan. Soak steaks in this mixture while grill is
heating. Remove from marinade and season with Reata Grill Blend.
</P>
<P>
   When grill feels hot to a hand held 5 inches over fire, it is
ready to use. Place steaks on grill and cook 5 minutes on each side
for medium. Top each steak with a cold slice of Cilantro Butter.
Serve immediately. Makes 4 servings.
</P>

Walsh, Ten Speed Press &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL; 
REATA GRILL BLEND &QL; 
Our homemade steak seasoning mix is addictive _ put some in a jar
in your pantry and you'll find yourself using it on everything. &QL; 
4 tablespoons kosher salt &QL; 
3 tablespoons pasilla powder (see Note) &QL; 
2 tablespoons dried granulated garlic &QL; 
2 tablespoons sugar &QL; 
2 tablespoons ground cumin &QL; 
2 tablespoons coarsely ground black pepper &QL; 
1 tablespoon ground thyme &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Combine all ingredients in a small bowl, blending well to evenly
distribute spices. Be sure to break up any chunks that appear.
</P>
<P>
   Store blend in an airtight container. Shake or stir again before
each use. Makes about 1 cup.
</P>
<P>
   NOTE: To make pasilla powder, remove stems and seeds from 2 to 3
pasilla chiles. Toast peppers in a skillet over medium heat 5
minutes, turning often until dry and crisp, but not burned. Puree
peppers in a coffee grinder until they become a fine powder.
</P>
<P>
   From ``A Cowboy in the Kitchen,'' by Grady Spears and Robb
Walsh, Ten Speed Press &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL; 
CILANTRO BUTTER &QL; 
2 cups loosely packed cilantro leaves &QL; 
1 cup unsalted butter, softened &QL; 
Kosher salt to taste &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Finely chop cilantro leaves or place in container of a food
processor and process. The processor method will give a greener
color to the finished butter. Place cilantro, butter and salt in a
mixer fitted with a paddle attachment and beat at medium speed
until butter is light and fluffy.
</P>
<P>
   Remove butter from bowl, place on a length of parchment paper or
foil, and roll into a 1 1/2-inch-wide cylinder, squeezing gently to
remove any air pockets.
</P>
<P>
   Freeze better until ready for use. Just before serving time,
thaw butter 10 minutes. Then cut into thin disks.
</P>
<P>
   Serve it cold. Butter will keep in freezer up to 3 months. Makes
8 (1-ounce) servings. &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL; 
LAMB CHOPS WITH JALAPENO JELLY &QL; 
Ask your butcher for thick lamb chops if you like them rare. &QL; 
2 tablespoons olive oil &QL; 
Leaves from 3 sprigs of rosemary &QL; 
2 teaspoons lime juice &QL; 
4 tablespoons jalapeno jelly &QL; 
8 lamb chops, T-bone OR loin &QL; 
Kosher salt to taste &QL; 
1 tablespoon Cracked Pepper (recipe follows) &QL;
</P>
<P>
   To make marinade, combine olive oil, rosemary, lime juice and
jalapeno jelly in a bowl and whisk together. Place lamb chops and
marinade in a plastic bag. Remove air from bag, seal and
refrigerate at least 2 hours, or overnight.
</P>
<P>
   Prepare a grill. Remove chops from marinade and season with salt
and Cracked Pepper. Place chops 2 to 3 inches above white coals and
cook meat on both sides (3 to 4 minutes for medium rare), turning
frequently so marinade doesn't burn. Place 2 chops on each plate
and serve warm. Makes 4 servings.
</P>
<P>
   CRACKER PEPPER: Cracked pepper is very different from freshly
ground pepper. The aroma and flavor of the peppercorn comes through
in every bite.
</P>
<P>
   To make cracked pepper, you need to crush each peppercorn into
no more than eight or ten pieces. You can put whole peppercorns in
a large frying pan and use a smaller frying pan to crush them, but
you really need to bear down hard and this takes a lot of strength.
</P>
<P>
   The easiest cracking method is to put peppercorns in a food
processor and pulse once or twice. This method takes patience and
usually requires several batches. You have to sort through the
cracked peppercorns, remove remaining whole ones and repeat
process.
</P>
<P>
   The simplest way to keep cracked peppercorns is to buy a bottle
of whole black peppercorns, crack them all and return them to the
same bottle for storage.

 &QL; 
RANCH BEANS &QL; 
4 cups dried pinto beans &QL; 
Water &QL; 
4 cups minced plus 1 1/2 cups diced yellow onions &QL; 
1/2 cup pure chile powder &QL; 
1/4 cup kosher salt &QL; 
1/2 bunch cilantro, stemmed and chopped &QL; 
4 tablespoons olive oil &QL; 
2 cups diced red bell peppers &QL; 
2 cups diced green bell peppers &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Wash beans and sort through to remove any foreign particles and
broken beans. In a stockpot, cover beans with cold water by 6
inches and soak 6 hours or overnight. Be sure beans remain covered
with water during soaking process.
</P>
<P>
   Drain beans and return to same pot. Cover with fresh water by 1
1/2 inches.
</P>
<P>
   Add minced onions, chile powder, salt and cilantro and stir to
blend. Bring beans to a boil over medium heat. Reduce heat, cover
and cook until beans are tender, about 2 1/2 hours.
</P>
<P>
   From time to time check and stir beans. If necessary, add water
as needed. Near end of cooking time, liquid should be almost
absorbed.
</P>
<P>
   Close to serving time, heat olive oil in a large saute pan. When
oil is very hot, add diced onion and peppers, and cook quickly,
about 6 minutes, stirring and tossing until crisp but tender. Stir
this mixture into beans. Serve at once. Makes 10 servings.

COWTOWN COLESLAW &QL; 
This peppery slaw is colorful and has a zing to it. It's great with
smoked meats and picnic fare. &QL; 
5 cups julienned green cabbage (about 1 head) &QL; 
1 1/2 cups julienned red cabbage (about 1/3 head) &QL; 
2 carrots, peeled and julienned &QL; 
5 jalapeno peppers, stemmed, seeded and julienned &QL; 
1 1/4 cups mayonnaise &QL; 
1/2 cup malt vinegar &QL; 
1/2 cup sugar &QL; 
1 1/2 tablespoons freshly squeezed lime juice &QL; 
Kosher salt to taste &QL; 
Freshly ground pepper to taste &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Place all vegetables in a large bowl.
</P>
<P>
   In another bowl, whisk together mayonnaise, vinegar, sugar and
lime juice. Pour dressing over vegetables, season with salt and
pepper and toss to combine.
</P>
<P>
   Set aside in refrigerator until serving time. This is best made
and served on same day. Makes 6 servings.

COWBOY BROWNIES &QL; 
For exceptional brownies, use a great milk chocolate like Lindt.
Eat these brownies while they're still warm and gooey, with a big
scoop of vanilla ice cream on top. &QL; 
4 1/2 cups (about 1 3/4 pounds) bittersweet chocolate chunks &QL; 
1 cup unsalted butter, cut into pieces &QL; 
8 eggs &QL; 
3 cups sugar &QL; 
1 1/2 cups flour &QL; 
1/2 cup cocoa powder &QL; 
4 teaspoons vanilla &QL; 
3 cups chopped pecans &QL; 
1 cup (about 6 ounces) milk chocolate chunks &QL; 
Vanilla ice cream (optional) &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Butter a 13x9x12-inch baking pan; set aside.
</P>
<P>
   Combine 3 cups (about 1 pound) bittersweet chocolate with butter
and melt in a bowl in a microwave oven or in a saucepan over low
heat on top of stove. When butter and chocolate are melted, set
aside.
</P>
<P>
   In a mixer, using paddle attachment, beat eggs 3 minutes on
medium speed. Add sugar and continue to beat until mixture is light
in color and texture. Add melted chocolate and combine well.
</P>
<P>
   Mix flour and cocoa together and add them to chocolate mixture,
along with vanilla. Fold nuts, remaining 1 1/2 cups bittersweet
chocolate chunks and milk chocolate chunks into mixture by hand or
with a mixer on low speed.
</P>
<P>
   Spread mixture in prepared pan using a spatula. Place this pan
in a larger pan and pour boiling water halfway up sides of larger
pan to create a hot water bath. Place pans in oven. Bake in
preheated 325-degree oven 40 to 45 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   Remove pans from oven and remove brownies from water bath to
cool. Serve slightly warm, with ice cream if desired. Makes 15
servings.

 &QL; 
SPICY PECANS &QL; 
At Reata, these pecans are served on a salad with goat cheese and
tomatoes, but some folks like them by themselves. &QL; 
4 cups (about 1 pound) shelled pecan halves &QL; 
6 tablespoons unsalted butter, melted &QL; 
4 teaspoons chile powder &QL; 
1/2 cup packed brown sugar &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In a large bowl, toss pecans in melted butter until completely
coated. Sprinkle chile powder over nuts and toss to coat
completely. Add brown sugar and toss with hands to keep sugar from
forming lumps.
</P>
<P>
   Spread mixture out onto a lightly oiled baking sheet, scraping
residue from bowl on top of nuts.
</P>
<P>
   Bake in preheated 350-degree oven 20 minutes, or until nuts
begin to brown and butter begins to spread. At this point, coating
won't be crunchy, but as the nuts cool, coating will harden. Nuts
can be stored in an air-tight container up to 2 weeks. Makes 4
cups.

 &HT;    Barbie still has intrinsic value for parts only)
 &HT;    By Emily Minor
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. - I've been feeling a little rough around
the edges lately, what with ``Survivor'' over and all, so thank God
for mothers and their ability to divert. Mine called the other day
under the pretense of wanting to know how her youngest grandson is
doing in the fourth grade when, lo and behold, she let the real cat
out of the bag.
</P>
<P>
   ``Emily,'' she asked casually, ``do you still have your
Barbies?''
</P>
<P>
   She asked this as though she and I have discussed Barbie, Midge
and Ken and their black patent-leather case every day for the past
37 years, which we have not.
</P>
<P>
   When this casual inquisition began, my heart leaped, my breath
stopped, for even at age 44, it's difficult to disappoint one's
mother. How could I tell her Ken's arm is missing? Indeed, Ken
himself has not been seen in months.
</P>
<P>
   Midge is in good shape, freckles and all, but Barbie _ well, she
has a little problem with her head.
</P>
<P>
   It keeps falling off.
</P>
<P>
   The last time I saw Midge and Babs, they were sitting on a shelf
in our bedroom next to my white wedding boots, Barbie's loose head
sitting in Midge's lap. Please, don't write me with your analysis
of what all that might mean. I don't want to know.
</P>
<P>
   ``You know,'' my mother continued, ignoring my tense breathing.
``I heard those dolls are worth $4,000.'' I have to admit, I had a
brief flash of hope. Four grand! Then I remembered the source. This
was the same woman who once suggested you could die from one puff
of a marijuana cigarette.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mom,'' I said, with daughterly reproach, ``they're not worth
$4,000.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I only know what people tell me,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Still, you've got to give a person her due when it's her due,
and my mother gets all the Barbie dues. It was she who insisted,
sometimes quite loudly, that I keep those Barbies. Indeed, she
pretty much forced me to lug my entire youth around the country
after I graduated from college.
</P>
<P>
   Baby pictures. Nancy Drew books. The Barbies _ Ken, Midge and
the Queen herself.
</P>
<P>
   I did what she told me, my first real act of obedience, although
somewhere along the line, I lost the Nancy Drew books (still
hearing about that one), and some of the baby pictures got wet. But
Barbie and her friends? They're made of fine, fine plastic. They
survived.
</P>
<P>
   ``You keep those Barbies for your kids,'' my mother would tell
me when I'd call collect from remote corners of the earth. ``One
day they'll be worth something.''
</P>
<P>
   Then one day came, and I got married and had a kid, and I made
the mistake of getting out the Barbies and allowing actual children
to play with them, a little something that caused Ken to turn up
one-armed and missing and Barbie to lose her head.
</P>
<P>
   And now this. The awful truth.
</P>
<P>
   My Barbies are pretty much worthless.
</P>
<P>
   The 1963 Barbie Graduation Doll. She's worth $120 or so. The
1963 vintage Barbie in mint condition is going for about $100. But
plain old dirty, tired, been-around-the-country Barbie?
</P>
<P>
   She's worth about 50 bucks. I will not be paying off my son's
new braces with the plastic pieces of my past. Indeed, I would have
been better off keeping track of Nancy Drew. Story of my life. And
my mother's.

<P>
   GOOD-JUNK (Undated) _ The pin on Mimi Mannix's hat said it all.
``Junk 'til you drop'' it read, which is why Ms. Mannix was outside
the Strudel Haus in Covington, Ky., on a Thursday afternoon
painting a giant pig. Like a multitude of less colorful people, Ms.
Mannix, an Indiana collectibles dealer had come to this musty
little town across the Ohio River from Cincinnati to shop. ``I'm
selling, I'm buying, I'm doing my pig,'' Ms. Mannix said, dipping
into a vat of pink enamel. ``I'm having fun.'' Here at the
northernmost tip of an annual event known as the 450-Mile Route 127
Corridor Sale, it was no wonder why. A banner spanning Main Street
hailed, ``Welcome to the start of the world's largest yard sale.''
On the reverse it said, ``Welcome to the end of the world's largest
yard sale.'' Covington was the final destination if you started
your journey at the other end, 450 miles away in Gadsden, Ala. Like
everything about this multistate flea market, it was all in how you
looked at it. By Frank DeCaro.

   CATSKILLS (Monticello, N.Y.) _ The Catskills have always been
synonymous with comedy, with the shtick and shpritz of Sid Caesar,
Jerry Lewis and Mel Brooks. But the glorious mountains here and the
flavorful summertime crowds they drew have also proved to be a
fertile ground for more thoughtful dramas, fiction and films about
love, betrayal, even struggles with faith. This Jewish world of the
Catskills seems to be accumulating something of a genre worthy of
serious literary and cinematic study. By Joseph Berger.

DORF'S FACTORY DIRECT

  Edgy N.Y.C. transplant hoping to mesh with mainstream L.A. 
(For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By DAVID BLOOM 
c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News 
<TEXT>
<P>
   It's a long trip, in a lot of ways, from downtown New York to
downtown Hollywood, from the avant-garde edges of jazz and blues to
the absolute epicenter of mass-market pop music.
</P>
<P>
   But that's exactly the trip Michael Dorf is taking with the
Knitting Factory, his edgy New York club that has limned the
fringes of popular music for 13 years, with the opening of a
sleekly designed second venue just a hop, skip and walk of fame
down the block from Mann's Chinese Theater on a Hollywood
Boulevard, a venue that is trying to reinvent itself.
</P>
<P>
   Characteristically, Dorf is doing it as much out of love of
music as of money, a bit of heresy in a town known for figuring all
the angles on any entertainment venture.
</P>
<P>
   ``Money isn't the end goal,'' said Dorf, founder and president
of the club and its parent company, KnitMedia, which also runs a
record label and music-oriented Web site (www.knittingfactory.com).
``The end goal is to have a compelling business model that balances
commercial and artistic needs. It's a huge idea, and you know
what's amazing is that we've delivered on the idea.''
</P>
<P>
   The club is tucked behind the Hollywood Entertainment Museum in
a long- struggling commercial center a block west of a massive $300
million development project whose centerpiece is the Chinese
Theater. Dorf's neighbor won't open for another year, but is
expected to draw huge crowds to the reviving Hollywood area when it
does.
</P>
<P>
   Dorf is hoping to enjoy some spillover from the revival, but his
club is actually constructed as much for people who can't make it
through the club doors as for those who can.
</P>
<P>
   It comes loaded with high-tech features, such as computer kiosks
in the bar where you can literally share a face-to-face virtual
drink with someone in the New York club. The wall of one hallway is
lined with computers connecting to the Web sites of several online
partners. Gas-plasma flat- screen displays ring the bar area,
continually televising concerts and other activities at the clubs.
</P>
<P>
   The club is wired with high-speed Net connections so it can
Webcast high-quality broadband versions of concerts and other
events it is hosting. Wedged between the club's two performance
spaces and visible from the bar and restaurant is a glassed-in
digital control room that oversees the technology and cameras
involved in televising on-stage events.
</P>
<P>
   Mix in a post-modern design for the restaurant and bar, large
and small performance spaces that are all polished wood and steel,
and you have a very different Knitting Factory from its New York
progenitor.
</P>
<P>
   ``The clubs don't look identical,'' said Ric Dube, an analyst
with Webnoize, a Massachussetts-based Internet music consultancy.
``The New York club is awfully ragged; you can see the pipes. The
L.A. one, the lines are cleaner, the colors are softer, there's a
lot more attention paid to a cool sleekness.''
</P>
<P>
   But it is the Net capabilities of the new Knitting Factory that
make it more than just another club, Dube said. That ability is
crucial to Dorf's vision of putting Knitting Factories in major
cities around the world, the next to be in Berlin.
</P>
<P>
   ``Can we build something that on its veneer works like a club
and can be profitable, but with the backing of a studio to create
branding content?'' Dorf asks. ``More and more people are going to
be online listening to their music, whether it's Napster or
downloadable concerts. But those people who are getting their music
via their computer or Palm Pilot are still going to need to and
want to go to a club. And we've got a great club. People are going
to want to see music there.''
</P>
<P>
   The club also comes with artist-friendly touches such as
oversize stages connected directly to a loading dock by a series of
easy-on-the-back ramps.
</P>
<P>
   ``The reason we went with a larger stage and camera platforms:
If an artist has an amazing experience performing there, that's
their stage and their home from then on,'' Dorf said. ``That's the
place they want that performance captured. We want the artist to
feel it's as great a musical experience as possible.''
</P>
<P>
   Getting the club opened, however, has proved expensive and
frustrating. More than two years in the planning, the club was
supposed to open in mid-June with a big kickoff party.
</P>
<P>
   But construction was nowhere near done, forcing the cancellation
of the event, and many more concerts after it, costing the company
more than $250,000 just to pay off guarantees and appearance fees
to high-profile musicians who couldn't play. The club lost another
$100,000 in fixed overhead costs and had to forgo unknown amounts
of revenue that it had counted on.
</P>
<P>
   Dorf finally opened the club in mid-August with lower-profile
acts while work continued on many of the club's high-tech features.
A grand-opening event, featuring New York stalwart Arto Lindsay and
others, is now scheduled for Sept. 18, and Dorf is upbeat.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everything paid off,'' he said. ``The layout to capture
content and deliver it to broadband platforms means we're able to
get stuff out there in a significantly more functional way than we
have been able to do in New York.''
</P>
<P>
   It's uncertain, however, how Dorf will translate his New York
booking policies to the more mainstream tastes of Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   Knitting Factory New York says in its literature that ``downtown
isn't just an address,'' a reference to the quirky tastes it has
fostered by repeatedly booking challenging artists such as John
Zorn, Lindsay and Philip Glass. But Dorf freely acknowledges L.A.
will force changes.
</P>
<P>
   ``For us, `downtown,' as almost the word `jazz,' has incredible
ambiguity,'' Dorf said. ``The whole concept of not being a ZIP code
means it can be adjusted. We're going to reach into a much more
mainstream, pop, radio-friendly group of bookings.''
</P>
<P>
   The two performance areas _ one capable of holding about 440
people, the other only 40, both closed off from the bar and dining
room _ will provide greater flexibilty, Dorf said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We need to touch on acts that are a little bit downtown, like
Elliott Smith or Martin Sexton, but are still commercial enough
that they will draw an audience,'' Dorf said. ``L.A. will be more
poppy, more reflective of Los Angeles. But thank God for that
second room. We can worry more about the aesthetics there.''
</P>
<P>
   The club's construction headaches cost it the chance to book
some natural allies, such as Marc Ribot, the avant-garde jazz and
rock guitarist who has frequently played the New York Knitting
Factory. But for his Sept. 6 Los Angeles performance, Ribot and his
Los Cubanos Postizos band will play the Conga Room, a frustration
for Dorf, who says his club just wasn't ready when it came time to
book the Ribot concert.
</P>
<P>
   For his part, Ribot said the Knitting Factory faces some serious
challenges.
</P>
<P>
   ``It remains to be seen how the Knitting Factory will play into
the L.A. scene,'' Ribot said. ``In New York, it brought a
medium-sized venue where bands like my own can perform. In the
past, it's been more open to experimental music, but that seems to
be changing. At the last Knitting Factory festival, they moved
towards mainstream jazz, which is unfortunate, because I always
thought experimental music was their raison d'etre.''
</P>
<P>
   But Ribot added that he hopes the Knitting Factory Hollywood
will feed a Los Angeles new-music scene.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sometimes, a scene grows into the space,'' he said. ``You
never know.''
</P>
<P>
   Chris Monaco _ a DJ, founding partner in the Hollywood club
Vynyl and head of international marketing at Spike Radio _ said the
Knitting Factory can create a worldwide club franchise that can
accommodate the tours of edgier, mid-size artists, much as House of
Blues revived a mainstream slice of that same concert business.
</P>
<P>
   ``It used to be there was either the large national tour or the
small-venue shows,'' said Monaco. ``Then House of Blues came along
and somewhat commoditized it. In relative terms, it wasn't a
straight sell-out type of venture, because it helped put a lot of
alternative acts onto stages where people will go see them. Now
these people can go headline a show.''
</P>
<P>
   Whether the New York sensibility translates is a trickier
question.
</P>
<P>
   ``What they're doing in New York works for them in New York,''
Monaco said. ``But a lot of New York people come out to L.A. and
find out this is L.A. They're going to have to appeal somewhat to
what works in L.A. These guys are really going to have to take it
to a broader audience. I actually think they're going to be not
avant-garde, but to the left of center.''
</P>
<P>
   Webnoize's Dube thinks the translation can be done, however.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a wonderful company run by a very nice music lover,''
said Dube. ``The Knitting Factory has always been open-minded to
include anything and everything. The experiment is to see how L.A.
adopts a New York City sensibility and makes it its own. And I
think there will be a way to make it L.A.'s own.''

&HT;     SAT SCORES IN TEXAS REMAIN STATIC 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By EDMUND S. TIJERINA  
 &HT;     c.2000 San Antonio Express-News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN ANTONIO _ Math scores for Texas high school students taking
the Scholastic Assessment Test were static in 1999 even though the
nationwide scores hit a 30-year high. Educators and business
leaders in the state said the scores show that Texas' education
reforms now must move to the high school level.
</P>
<P>
   ``We seem to have built a four-lane highway for the elementary
division and it's beautiful,'' said State Board of Education member
Joe Bernal. ``And we're driving right into a marshland, which is
the secondary areas.''
</P>
<P>
   Nationally, mean scores on the SAT this year rose 3 points over
in 1999, from 1016 to 1019, the College Board announced Tuesday.
Math scores rose 3 points to a 30-year high, from 511 to 514, while
verbal scores held at 505.
</P>
<P>
   In Texas, scores for the math and verbal tests combined remained
below the national average, at 993.
</P>
<P>
   The math score went up a point, from 499 to 500, while the
verbal score dropped a point, from 494 to 493.
</P>
<P>
   The SAT, along with the American College Test or ACT, have been
used as a college admissions standard for decades and long have
been criticized as not accurately reflecting the abilities of
low-income and minority students. Scores on each section of the
test, verbal and math, range from 200 to a perfect 800.
</P>
<P>
   Scores for Mexican-Americans in Texas remained below the
national and state averages _ up a single point from 904 to 905 for
both verbal and math scores.
</P>
<P>
   For blacks, the combined score rose slightly but remained low,
from 847 to 850. The scores for white students rose from 1048 to
1051.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, the number of Texas high school students
taking the SAT increased.
</P>
<P>
   Of the class of 2000, 52 percent of the state's graduating
seniors took the test, or 108,919 students. Last year, 50 percent
of the state's seniors took the test. Both years are significantly
higher than the national average, in which 44 percent of the
country's students took the exam.
</P>
<P>
   Officials with the Texas Education Agency say that the increased
number of students taking the test is responsible for the scores
staying put.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm glad so many Texas young people are interested in going to
college,'' Education Commissioner Jim Nelson said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
   Still, students throughout the state have shown consistently
higher scores on the Texas Assessment of Academic Skills, a
standardized exam students take in grades 3-8 and 10.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, a record-breaking 80 percent of students in the state
passed the test.
</P>
<P>
   John Stevens, executive director of the Texas Business and
Education Coalition, said the combination of results shows the need
to concentrate on a coming 11th-grade exit test, which will be
designed to reflect skills that high school graduates will need in
the working world and in college.
</P>
<P>
   The organization formed in response to complaints from business
leaders that they were shut out of the state's efforts to improve
education.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have focused on lower grades, and that has worked,''
Stevens said. ``Now we have to focus on the performance of students
in the upper grades.''

 &HT;    For love, tenor turns on the power
 &HT;    By Pierre Ruhe
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   What's a lyrical Spanish tenor doing belting out Teutonic love
songs? Following the composer's orders, it turns out. Richard
Wagner, master of heavy German opera, wanted his music sung like
Italian bel canto, with smooth phrasing and an emphasis on the long
line. Placido Domingo is one of the only singers around with enough
thrust to carry the roles of Siegfried and Tristan and bring them
to full blossom with effortless beauty of tone. But he's
approaching retirement and will likely never sing these
ultra-demanding roles complete. For now, these excerpts _ the final
scene from ``Siegfried'' and the charged love scene from Act 2 of
``Tristan und Isolde'' (in Wagner's own curious concert
arrangement) _ are the among the best on disc. Domingo's love
interests are sung by Deborah Voigt. As Brunnhilde, she doesn't
have the vocal acting abilities of her paramour, which leads to
some imbalance in passion. Yet her tone is flowing and elegant.
London's Covent Garden Orchestra performs magnificently, conducted
by Antonio Pappano.

<P>
   Various artists. Skaggs Family Records. 13 tracks.
</P>
<P>
   Grade: B+
</P>
<P>
   Most tribute records are about making money. But here's one
steeped in respect, because most, if not all, of the artists played
with, or at least stood onstage in awe of, Bill Monroe, the creator
of bluegrass, who died in 1996 at 84. I expected Monroe protege
Ricky Skaggs and veterans who grew up in Appalachia (notably, Dolly
Parton, Steve Wariner and Dwight Yoakam) to expertly perform
Monroe's songs. But what a nice surprise to hear solid salutes from
John Fogerty (``Blue Moon of Kentucky''), the Dixie Chicks (``Walk
Softly on This Heart of Mine'') and Travis Tritt (``My Little
Georgia Rose,'' supposedly Monroe's ode to a child born out of
wedlock). The master of that high, lonesome sound that is bluegrass
would be proud.

</P>
<P>
   Grade: A-
</P>
<P>
   Recently, several artists _ notably, Corey Harris, Guy Davis and
Keb' Mo' _ have worked to revive acoustic blues, those from which
all others sprang. Add now Eric Bibb, who with this graceful album
establishes himself as an innovative voice in a historic genre. The
son of a folk singer, he was exposed early to Pete Seeger, Odetta
and Bob Dylan; he colors these 13 songs _ 10 are originals _ with
tinges of folk, gospel and pop. Purists may say it ain't the blues,
but Bibb honors tradition by breathing life into it. On two songs,
he haunts us with only his voice, guitar and soul. He ends with
``Sing Your Song,'' a finger-popping duet with that old revivalist
Taj Majal.

</P>
<P>
   Irma Thomas. Rounder. 13 tracks.
</P>
<P>
   Grade: B-
</P>
<P>
   Separately, Dan Penn and Irma Thomas have the kind of deep soul
cred you can't buy. The legendary Memphis songwriter has penned
such classics as ``Dark End of the Street'' and ``Do Right Woman.''
The Soul Queen of New Orleans has the kind of earthy alto that can
shake you to your roots. Their collaboration here is unfortunately
not as strong as their separate efforts. Though it has its high
points _ the evocative title track, steeped in moody sax and
Hammond B3, the slow-burning ``Not Enough Time to Change'' and the
vintage lament ``Woman Left Lonely,'' written with Spooner Oldham _
the album doesn't have the kind of flow you'd expect from a
collaboration this fine. The highs aren't as high, nor the lows as
low, as on the best Memphis soul recordings (think Hi Records, Stax
and Aretha) _ too much just slides along in a middling modern
groove. Penn says in the liner notes he wrote new songs because he
didn't want Thomas to have to record his old stuff. Hate to dispute
the master on that one, but setting Irma's voice loose on Penn's
best material would have made for an entire album of keepers.

</P>
<P>
   Grade: B-
</P>
<P>
   NBC isn't as hip as MTV, but network producers know a good
performance when they hear it. Most of the time, anyway. This
collection, though spotty as a rug in a coffeeshop, gathers some
strong musical outtakes from recent ``Today'' spots. Sheryl Crow
delivers a blistering reworking of ``If It Makes You Happy,''
Hootie &AMP; the Blowfish get funky on ``Hold My Hand,'' and Brian
Setzer obviates the need for coffee with a hyperactive ``Rock This
Town.'' Too bad the also-rans get equal time: Lionel Richie's
insipid ``Easy,'' Phil Collins' bloodless gutting of ``You Can't
Hurry Love'' and Amy Grant's pale ``Baby Baby.'' The CD also
includes some cheeky, wince-inducing artist intros by Katie Couric
and Co. and a goofy ``Theme 2000'' track. Still, the highlights
make the disc worth your while _ even as the lesser efforts make
you grateful for the CD ``skip'' function.

 &HT;    Diaperbags to drool for
 &HT;    By Sabine Morrow
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   With many of us lugging briefcases, cellphones, Palm Pilots,
laptops, lunch boxes and handbags, leaving the house is no
lightweight task these days.
</P>
<P>
   Add a baby and you've got your hands _ and arms _ full.
</P>
<P>
   A roomy, well-designed diaper bag could make your life a lot
easier and keep that tot well-stocked with baby must-haves when
you're both on the run.
</P>
<P>
   That old-fashioned frilly, pink-and-blue quilted diaper bag your
mother dragged around is pretty much a relic. Today's versions run
the gamut from rough and tumble nylon backpack styles equipped with
cellphone pockets to sleek and sexy satin looks brandishing tony
designer monikers and matching price tags.
</P>
<P>
   When shopping for a diaper bag, remember that while looks do
count, they aren't everything.
</P>
<P>
   What do you really need?
</P>
<P>
   Since it's going to get a major workout, purchase a durable bag
that can take some abuse. For comfort's sake, something with a
flexible shoulder strap makes sense. Also, look for a diaper bag
with features such as a full-size, fairly thick changing pad, a
removable dirty duds bag and plenty of easy-to-access nooks and
crannies. If it's machine washable, that's a bonus. But a fabric
you can wipe clean is a must.
</P>
<P>
   And let's not forget Dad. We found a slew of diaper bags in
neutral colors that easily pass for gym totes or overnight bags.
</P>
<P>
   Since many of these diaper bags will be pressed into doing
double duty as a handbag or briefcase, consider getting travel-size
baby powder, lotions and even baby wipes. They'll take up less
room, allowing space for your keys, wallet and that Palm Pilot.
</P>
<P>
   Here's a sample of the diaper bags we found that can accommodate
just about any lifestyle and budget.

<TEXT>
<P>
   This is not Disney kid stuff. There's so much going on in this
astonishing, mystically complex animated epic from Japan that it
makes Wagner's Ring Cycle look like the Teletubbies. It's a ``once
upon a time'' tale about the battle between nature and
civilization. Boldly innovative yet eerily innocent, it's the sort
of thing you simply have to see for yourself.

<P>
   &QR;  ``The Big Kahuna'' (R) _ This one's well worth your time for
the terrific acting. Three salesmen _ a corrosive cynic (Kevin
Spacey), a resigned old-timer (Danny DeVito) and an eager-beaver
newcomer (Bob Facinelli) _ wait in their version of hell, i.e., a
hospitality suite in Wichita, for the chance to land that one
all-important client. Spacey and DeVito's performances are bracing
and brainy. Grade: B

<P>
   &QR;  ``Deterrence'' (R) _ In 2008, an eclectic collection of folks
is stranded in a Colorado diner. Among them, the U.S. president
(Kevin Pollak). Then comes news that Saddam Hussein's son has
invaded Kuwait. What's a second-string prez to do? Why, drop the
bomb, of course. The film wants to be a taut nuclear-showdown
debate, but the talk grows less interesting and the tension never
grows at all. Grade: D
</P>
<P>

<P>
   &QR;  ``I Dreamed of Africa'' (PG-13) _ Cardboard figures have
adventures in Africa. Kim Basinger stars as the real-life Kuki
Gallmann, who up and moves her family from Italy to the dangerous
Dark Continent because, as she tells her son, ``I've stopped
growing.'' Considering all the calamities that befall her family
after their move, you realize she should have considered something
like a yoga class instead. Directed by one-hit wonder Hugh Hudson
(``Chariots of Fire''), the movie never slows down long enough to
get inside the heads of its characters. Grade: C -
</P>
<P>
   _Steve Murray
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  ``The Next Best Thing'' (PG-13) _ Madonna and Rupert Everett
play a yoga instructor and her gay best pal who spend a drunken
night together and end up parents of a darling son. The would-be
wacky comedy (the writers forgot to supply good lines) turns into a
tiresome custody battle. Most of the effort seems to have gone into
making sure Madonna's eyes are lit in a flattering way at all
times. Grade: D +

 &HT;    Some films about labor that work
 &HT;    By Eleanor Ringel Gillespie
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Ah, Labor Day. That conundrum of a holiday on which labor is the
one thing we're not supposed to do. Rather, it's a time to laze
around, say goodbye to summer, have a cookout and maybe watch a few
videos. Here are some rental ideas if you want to be reminded what
Labor Day is all about. Beyond the long weekend, I mean.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  ``Matewan'' (1987): John Sayles' very fine, fact-based tale of
a miners' strike in West Virginia in the 1920s, which culminated in
the bloodiest confrontation between government and labor in U.S.
history. Chris Cooper, now best-known as the military madman living
next door to Kevin Spacey in ``American Beauty,'' plays a union
representative sent to the company town of Matewan to organize the
strikers. The mining company retaliates by hiring blacks and
Italians. The result is a struggle that pits white against black,
immigrant against longtime mountain man. Cooper, meanwhile, strives
to get the men to recognize that the real fight is against the
owners. Look for Sayles in the role of the shrill local minister
who's more or less in the owners' pockets, for David Straithairn as
the town's conscionable, caught-in-the-middle sheriff, and for
James Earl Jones, who agreed to play the leader of the black miners
for scale because he believed in the project so much.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  ``The Big One'' (1997): The moral of this movie may well be
never turn your back on Michael Moore. The maker of ``Roger &AMP; Me''
strikes again with this ruthless, inventive and often scathingly
hilarious documentary/essay about the insatiable greed that fuels
corporate America. While on a promotional tour for his book
``Downsize This!,'' Moore brings along a skeletal film crew and
uses the various stopovers to look at the way most major
corporations treat their employees. His wiseguy approach can be
cruel; typically, he ends up needling mindless midlevel management
types who haven't made a decision in years _aside from how to
better play up to their boss. But Nike CEO Phil Knight decides to
play along and agrees to meet with Moore. For his trouble, he gets
presented a plane ticket to Indonesia so he can visit the
14-year-olds who make his shoes. Just do it?
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  ``Hoffa'' (1992): It took 'em years, but they finally found
Jimmy Hoffa, the labor leader who mysteriously disappeared in 1975.
He resurfaced in 1992 in the person of Jack Nicholson, who gives a
brave, forceful performance in an admittedly uneven film that never
quite fulfills its initial promise. Written by David Mamet and
directed by Danny DeVito, the movie begins on that fateful day when
somebody did something to the former Teamsters president. But the
fill-in-the-blanks flashbacks can be confusing if you don't know
Hoffa's story as well as the filmmakers. Even so, the picture is
worth seeing _ as a thoughtful gloss on an ongoing mystery and for
Nicholson's thuggish magnetism in the title role. The movie is
something of a family affair as well; his daughter Jennifer makes
her screen debut in a small role as a nun.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  ``On the Waterfront'' (1954): OK, so many of us have already
seen it and many of us know that it's as much about Marlon Brando's
union troubles on the waterfront as it is about director Elia
Kazan's willingness to cooperate with House Un-American Activities
Committee. In other words, Kazan is insisting that, under certain
circumstances, it's OK to be a stool pigeon. Well, we all have our
agendas, and while the overall power of this Oscar winner (best
picture) may seem somewhat diminished _ it's full of '50s
morality-play bombast _ the performances remain as memorable as
ever. Brando won an Oscar. Lee J. Cobb, Rod Steiger and Karl Malden
were all supporting nominees, but the team-player winner was Eva
Marie Saint, whose leading-lady role was shrewdly pushed into the
supporting category, thus improving her chances. It also helped
pave the way for similar strategies by Goldie Hawn, Geena Davis and
Marisa Tomei.

 &HT;    SHOPPING DESTINATION: Northport, Ala.
 &HT;    Art at heart of many businesses, residents
 &HT;    By Marylin Johnson
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   NORTHPORT, Ala. _ f you enjoy paintings as well as pigskin play,
head for this artsy town across the Black Warrior River from
Tuscaloosa, home to the University of Alabama's Crimson Tide
football team.
</P>
<P>
   Here in this revitalized community of 24,000, you can view Ann
Mottershead Betak's romantic oil landscapes in her studio, shop for
an Italian bronze at Adams Antiques and meet artist Danny Rountree.
His watercolor of Main Avenue was commissioned by Friends of
Northport and is a colorful symbol of this charming town.
</P>
<P>
   You can also tour the Kentuck Art Center, located in a 1920
masonry building. Nestled around a landscaped courtyard, Kentuck _
Northport's original name _ houses an art museum, a gallery, seven
artists' studios and a shop selling folk and contemporary art and
traditional crafts. Look for Jerry Brown's face jugs, Edwin D.
Walter's glassware and T.R. Reed's fanciful wood whirligigs.
</P>
<P>
   The art center also stages the juried Kentuck Festival of the
Arts, which began in 1971. More than 300 invited artists from
around the country will converge Oct. 21-22 in Kentuck Park near
the Black Warrior River. The two-day event will feature craft
demonstrations by basketmakers, blacksmiths, furniture makers,
quilters and potters. It offers activities for kids, continuous
music and plenty of food as well. For information, call
205-758-1257.
</P>
<P>
   The fact that Northport is listed in John Villani's book, ``The
100 Best Small Arts Towns in America'' (John Muir Publications,
$16.95), is no accident.
</P>
<P>
   Jewelry designer Celia O'Kelley, who works in precious metals
and enamel, says the town works hard to attract its art crowd. ``A
couple of artists came here and were treated well by the locals,''
she says. ``Others arrived and soon the arts community flourished.
It succeeds because we have lots of diversity among our artisans,
from metalsmithing to digital art. We are not just painters.''
</P>
<P>
   The Renaissance Gallery on Main Avenue represents 23 artists.
``Our goal is to bring as much different art as possible to
Northport,'' says co-owner and artist Kathy Groshong. ``My Atlanta
customers like variety, from traditional to contemporary. Often,
they say, an Atlanta gallery focuses on just one or two styles.''
</P>
<P>
   Northport's history follows the river. More than 200 years ago,
the settlement of Kentuck was a convenient ford for those crossing
the Alabama Territory. Kentuck, so named because it was a canebrake
wilderness, eventually became known as North Port, the farthest
navigable point on the Black Warrior River. The city of Northport
was incorporated in 1871.
</P>
<P>
   Much of the charm of downtown Northport's Main Avenue comes from
its renovated buildings, ornate light poles, and baskets of
colorful flowers. And you can't miss the 102-year-old wooden train
trestle _ still in use _ which serves as the area landmark. When
the town needed new sidewalks, merchants spearheaded the drive to
``sell'' commemorative bricks and raised $400,000.
</P>
<P>
   Not all businesses are art influenced. Since 1909, Anders
Hardware has stocked more than 65,000 items, from screws to mule
collars, from fertilizer to pumps. Faucett's women's clothing store
has been in business since 1881 and in its present location on Main
Avenue since 1937, according to John Faucett, a descendant of the
founder.
</P>
<P>
   And the Northport 5 &AMP; 10 _ ``the store with a little bit of
everything!'' _ carries squirt rings for a nickel, pirate eye
patches for a dime as well as candies, sodas and notions.
</P>
<P>
   Two of the prettiest shops in Northport are the Potager, which
carries English statuary and everything for the gardener, and Wild
Birds Unlimited, housed in a restored Victorian home.
</P>
<P>
   With its small-town Southern charm, Northport grabs visitors and
residents alike. ``It reminds me of Mayberry,'' says Beth Campbell,
referring to the fictional town in the TV series ``The Andy
Griffith Show.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I've lived here five years and found that it has a wonderful
sense of community. People know each other and they wave at you. In
larger cities you don't find that.''
</P>
<P>
   If you go
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Getting there: Northport is about 205 miles west of downtown
Atlanta. Take I-20 west to Birmingham. It joins with I-59. Take
Exit 136 to I-459, which circles Birmingham. Eventually you will
find yourself back on 1-59 and I-20. Follow the signs to
Tuscaloosa. Take Exit 71B (I-359) and exit to right. Take second
exit, 15th Street, and follow signs to Northport.
</P>
<P>

A few are closed on Mondays and a few open on Sundays. Some studios
are open by appointment only.

   Q: My wife enjoyed wearing her Laurel Burch jewelry, which is
made in San Francisco. But she lost much of it during a burglary a
few years ago. I have not been able to find a source in Atlanta. We
have our 54th wedding anniversary coming up and I would love to
surprise her with some jewelry.
</P>
<P>
   _ Gil Tauffner, Atlanta
</P>
<P>
   A: What a thoughtful husband you are! Laurel Burch is a
self-taught California artist and her jewelry is sold at The Classy
Cat, 2900 Delk Road, Marietta (770-850-7240). The feline pin is $72
and the pair of earrings is $39.75. Burch is known for her
colorful, stylized animals, including cats and horses. The shop
also stocks the artist's posters, wooden masks, wall hangings and
throws as well as her line of ceramics, including teapots and mugs.
Her designs are also on note cards, T-shirts and totes, scarves and
socks. For more information, see www.laurelburch.com.
</P>
<P>
   Q: I am looking for Sen-Sen, the breath enhancer. It tastes like
licorice and is used to kill cigarette and alcohol breath.
</P>
<P>
   _ Gary Furin, Atlanta
</P>
<P>
   A: Valuable to singers, speakers and smokers, Sen-Sen, the tiny
black-square breath freshener, was created in the mid-1890s and
described as a ``throat ease and breath perfume.'' The product is
made from licorice and rare herbs, says the manufacturer F&AMP;F Foods.
You can have it mailed by calling 1-800-621-0225. Twelve foil
packets of 0.1-ounce each are $7.80 including shipping. A literary
note: Sen-Sen garnered a mention in Stephen King's novel ``Four
Past Midnight.''
</P>
<P>
   Q: A few months ago, I read about a person who holds the
Guinness record for being the loudest snorer. He said the only
thing that stopped his snoring was ySnore. I've looked everywhere
for this product but can't find it. You probably guessed it, my
husband is a very loud snorer, and I need this product desperately!
</P>
<P>
   _ Shirley Dutton, Villa Rica, Ga.
</P>
<P>
   A: We have a quiet, and hopefully happy, solution to your
problem. You can buy ySnore, the anti-snoring nose drops at Eckerd.
We found our bottle at the location in Ansley Square, 1512 Piedmont
Ave. N.E. (404-876-2263). A 5-milliliter bottle is $6.49. The
product is simple to use. Have the snorer place two to four drops
into each nostril before retiring. Then the entire family might
enjoy a quiet night's rest. Check out the company's Web site,
www.ysnore.com, for more information.
</P>
<P>
   Q: I am looking for Di Gas or Mildewcide made in Florida by
Vapor Products. It's a small bag of powder that you can put inside
a suitcase with woolen items, paperwork or records and it stops any
smell of mildew or moths. I bought it for years but now I can't
find it. Can you?
</P>
<P>
   _ Patricia Barnett, Atlanta
</P>
<P>
   A: No wonder you can't find it _ Vapor Products no longer makes
the item. However, another Florida company, Damp Check, markets
Damp Check Mildewcide, which has the same ingredients as the
discontinued product. While not available in stores, you can order
it via 1-800-339-8603. Six 4-ounce packages are $21, including
postage. For more information, check out the company's Web site,
www.dampcheck.com. A. Vaughn Williams, president of Damp Check,
refers to his product as ``packaged sunshine.'' The active
ingredient is paraformaldehyde. Says Williams: ``It kills mildew
and musty odors and protects clothing, leather, paper and wood
items in closets for months.'' He says it can also be used to
protect vacation homes, RVs and boats during non-use.
</P>
<P>
   Q: When I was a kid, I enjoyed Sky Bar candy. It came in four
sections and each section, which you broke off, had a different
filling. Can you find it?
</P>
<P>
   _ Stan Funk, Lawrenceville, Ga.
</P>
<P>
   And another candy request: I am looking for a product, probably
discontinued, called a Sky Bar, which I enjoyed 35 years ago. It
was a sectioned bar with four flavors, chocolate, vanilla, peanut
butter and caramel, and came in a yellow-wrapped package. Let me
know if it is still in production.
</P>
<P>
   _ John Arth, Roswell, Ga.
</P>
<P>
   A: We salivated over this request, you sweet tooth fans, then
tracked down the bars at Cracker Barrel, 2150 Delk Road S.E.,
Marietta (770-951-2602). Each bar, made by Necco, is 69 cents and
contains 190 calories. And the candy bar is just as our readers
fondly remembered, with four flavors in a yellow wrapper. Personal
note: It's also yummy.

 &HT;    Aussie culture takes its 'cue from the grill
 &HT;    By Jim Auchmutey
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   When it comes to eating, Australia and America are divided by a
common ritual: the barbecue.
</P>
<P>
   Australians love to grill meat in their back yards or on
communal braziers in pubs where customers do their own cooking. But
when they speak of throwing something on the barbie, Aussies don't
necessarily mean the open-grate grills most Americans use. (And
they certainly don't mean the slow-smoked meat we love in the
South.)
</P>
<P>
   The proper Australian barbie is essentially a gas-fired
hotplate, the firebox usually covered with a solid cooking surface.
It is almost always tended by a man with long tongs, short pants
and a tinnie of beer.
</P>
<P>
   The carefree image may be better than the reality. ``We love our
barbecues, but the food isn't as flavorsome as yours,'' says Fred
Mitchell, a winery representative in Adelaide who lived for three
years in Marietta. When he returned home, he took a Coleman grill
back with him.
</P>
<P>
   There's a lot more to Australian cooking than the barbie, of
course. Here's a sampler on this page and on H4.
</P>
<P>
   DESSERT
</P>
<P>
   Marshmallow Pavlova
</P>
<P>
   Makes 8 servings
</P>
<P>
   Preparation time: 70 minutes
</P>
<P>
   Cooking time: 45 minutes
</P>
<P>
   Many Australians consider pavlova their national dessert. The
story goes that a hotel chef in Perth created the dish in the
1930s, naming it for Russian ballerina Anna Pavlova. The whipped
cream topping is supposed to recall her swirling skirt. Terri Steel
of the Australian Catalogue Co. in Marietta makes this version for
dinner parties.
</P>
<P>
   4 egg whites
</P>
<P>
   1 cup granulated sugar
</P>
<P>
   1/2 teaspoon vanilla
</P>
<P>
   1 teaspoon white vinegar
</P>
<P>
   1 pint whipping cream
</P>
<P>
   2 bananas
</P>
<P>
   2 tablespoons lemon juice
</P>
<P>
   8 ounces strawberries
</P>
<P>
   2 kiwi fruit
</P>
<P>
   2 passion fruit
</P>
<P>
   3 tablespoons seedless strawberry jam
</P>
<P>
   To make the meringue: Preheat oven to 300 degrees. Beat egg
whites until soft peaks form; gradually add sugar, beating well
after each addition until all sugar is dissolved. Add vanilla and
vinegar; beat 1 minute longer. Spread meringue into greased,
paper-lined 11-by-7-inch baking pan that has been lightly dusted
with flour. Bring paper over sides of pan. Bake for 45 minutes, or
until meringue is crisp and has a hard shell. Lift out carefully on
to wire rack to cool. (You will notice the top of the pavlova has
fallen slightly, giving room for the topping.) Trim edges with
sharp knife.
</P>
<P>
   To finish the pavlova: Beat 3/4 of the pint of whipping cream
(reserving 1/4) until soft peaks form; spread over meringue. Peel
bananas, cut into diagonal slices and put into the lemon juice to
keep their color. Hull and halve strawberries. Peel and slice kiwi
fruit. Remove pulp from passion fruit.
</P>
<P>
   Heat strawberry jam in small saucepan; brush over strawberry
halves to glaze. Arrange banana slices, strawberries and kiwi fruit
decoratively on top of pavlova; spoon passion fruit pulp over
bananas. Whip remaining cream and pipe decoratively around edge of
pavlova.

   Like bison or venison, kangaroo is a lean red meat that can be
quite tasty if properly cooked. That means medium rare over high
heat. Anything more, and the meat takes on a faint liverish taste.
We don't know of a retail supplier in Atlanta, but we were able to
get some beautiful frozen kangaroo fillets for $8.95 a pound (plus
shipping) from Broadleaf Venison, a California game supplier that's
happy to ship small quantities to individual customers. It also
supplied this recipe, which we highly recommend. 1-800-336-3844;
www.broadleafgame.com.
</P>
<P>
   For the sauce:
</P>
<P>
   3/4 cup heavy cream
</P>
<P>
   2 green onions, sliced diagonally
</P>
<P>
   2 tablespoons whole-grain mustard
</P>
<P>
   Salt to taste
</P>
<P>
   For the fillets:
</P>
<P>
   1 tablespoon olive oil
</P>
<P>
   1 pound kangaroo fillets
</P>
<P>
   To make the sauce: Place cream, onions and mustard in a
saucepan; bring to a boil and simmer for 1 minute. Season with salt
to taste. Keep warm.
</P>
<P>
   To cook the fillets: Heat oil in a frying pan and cook fillets
over high heat for about 2 minutes, turning once during cooking.
(Or cook on an outdoor grill.) Transfer to a warm plate and let
stand for 2 more minutes. Slice fillets and serve with warm sauce,
baby potatoes and snow peas or beans.

   Luke Mangan started cooking at 15, when he was tossed out of
school for ``being cheeky,'' as he puts it. Now 29, he's the chef
at one of Sydney's hottest new restaurants, Salt. You'll probably
see him cooking on the U.S. morning shows during the Olympics. His
food is an intriguing mixture of modern Australian and traditional
French. This dish, from the menu at Salt, appears in his first
cookbook, due this fall, ``BLD'' (as in breakfast, lunch, dinner).
</P>
<P>
   6 ounces instant polenta
</P>
<P>
   3 tablespoons heavy cream
</P>
<P>
   3 ounces blue cheese (such as Stilton), crumbled
</P>
<P>
   Salt and freshly ground pepper to taste
</P>
<P>
   1/2 to 3/4 cup finely sliced shiitake mushrooms
</P>
<P>
   1 to 2 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil
</P>
<P>
   3/4 pound medium-large sea scallops (about 12), roe off
</P>
<P>
   Truffle oil (optional)
</P>
<P>
   Watercress, for garnish
</P>
<P>
   In a medium saucepan, combine the polenta and cream and stir
over low heat until cooked according to instructions on the packet,
usually 5 minutes. Crumble in the blue cheese and stir until melted
through. Season with salt and pepper.
</P>
<P>
   Blanch mushrooms in boiling salted water for about 30 seconds.
Drain.
</P>
<P>
   Just before the polenta is ready, heat a medium, heavy-bottomed
frying pan over medium-high heat. Add 1 tablespoon olive oil, then,
when hot, add the scallops and cook until they have just lost their
translucency, turning once. This may take about 10 to 12 minutes.
Take care not to overcook.
</P>
<P>
   On each plate, dollop about 2 heaping tablespoons polenta and
flatt the bed of watercress and top with the shiitake mushrooms.
Drizzle with truffle oil, if desired. Serve with champagne.

<P>
   Makes 2 large servings Preparation time: 15 minutes
</P>
<P>
   Cooking time: 8 minutes
</P>
<P>
   This fusion stuff can get confusing. The reigning champions of
Pacific Rim cuisine in Sydney are Tetsuya Wakuda, the Japanese-born
chef of Tetsuya's, and Neil Perry, a native Australian who cooks
like he was born in Asia. Their restaurants feature cross-cultural
dishes like this stir-fried crab omelet, a mainstay at Perry's
flagship, Rockpool. He has another restaurant called Wockpool and a
new cookbook titled ``Simply Asian.''
</P>
<P>
   For the broth:
</P>
<P>
   3/4 cup chicken stock
</P>
<P>
   3 tablespoons palm sugar (found in
</P>
<P>
   specialty shops carrying Asian and/or Indian products;
substitute granulated sugar if unavailable)
</P>
<P>
   2 tablespoons fish sauce
</P>
<P>
   1 teaspoon sesame oil
</P>
<P>
   For the omelet:
</P>
<P>
   5 eggs
</P>
<P>
   1 tablespoon palm sugar
</P>
<P>
   1 tablespoon fish sauce
</P>
<P>
   6 ounces white crab (Spanner crab if available)
</P>
<P>
   3 ounces ( 7/8 cup) bean sprouts
</P>
<P>
   1/2 cup snow pea sprouts (found in specialty stores and Asian
markets)
</P>
<P>
   15 Chinese yellow chives, washed and halved crosswise
</P>
<P>
   1/2 cup peanut or vegetable oil
</P>
<P>
   4 tablespoons oyster sauce
</P>
<P>
   To make the broth: Combine chicken stock, sugar and fish sauce
in a pot. Bring to a boil, pour in the sesame oil and keep warm
while making omelet.
</P>
<P>
   To make the omelet: Beat the eggs in a medium-size bowl. In a
small container, dissolve the palm sugar in the fish sauce. Add to
the eggs and whisk well.
</P>
<P>
   Pick through the crab meat for any cartilage and shell. Add the
bean sprouts, snow pea sprouts and chives. Mix well.
</P>
<P>
   Place the oil in a wok and heat until it is very hot and
smoking. (Otherwise, the eggs will soak up the oil.) Pour in the
egg mixture (it should puff up). Cook for 3 minutes, then place the
crab mixture in the middle. Cook for 3 minutes more and remove from
the heat.
</P>
<P>
   Pour off excess oil. Fold the omelet and place it back in the
wok for a minute. Turn off the heat and rest it near a heat source
for 2 minutes more.
</P>
<P>
   Remove the omelet from the wok with a fish lifter and place on a
board. Trim off the ends and place in a large bowl. Pour over the
hot broth and top with oyster sauce.

   Nathalie Dupree picked up this dish when she traveled to
Australia for a TV show that repeats at 3 p.m. Sept. 9 on GPTV. She
adapted the recipe from Ian Parmenter, host of the Australian
Broadcasting Co.'s show ``Consuming Passions.'' He used prawns; she
went with shrimp.
</P>
<P>
   1/2 cup honey
</P>
<P>
   1 tablespoon reduced-sodium soy sauce
</P>
<P>
   1/2 cup sherry
</P>
<P>
   1 teaspoon sesame oil (preferably light)
</P>
<P>
   Ground black pepper to taste
</P>
<P>
   1/2 teaspoon five-spice powder
</P>
<P>
   1 to 2 tablespoons olive oil
</P>
<P>
   1 piece ginger, about the size of a
</P>
<P>
   quarter, peeled and chopped,
</P>
<P>
   about 1 teaspoon
</P>
<P>
   2 or 3 hot chiles, chopped

<P>
   1 pound large shrimp, peeled and

<P>
   deveined
</P>
<P>
   Salt to taste
</P>
<P>
   2 tablespoons sesame seeds, preferably lightly toasted
</P>
<P>
   3 green onions, bulbs and greens, chopped
</P>
<P>
   In small bowl, make a sauce by mixing honey, soy sauce, sherry,
sesame oil, black pepper and five-spice powder. Heat 1 tablespoon
oil in a large nonstick pan over medium heat. Add ginger, chiles
and garlic and cook gently without browning for about 2 minutes.
Remove from pan and set aside. Increase heat and add shrimp, a few
at a time, and cook for 3 to 5 minutes, undercooking slightly. Add
more oil as needed. Remove shrimp and keep warm until all are
pre-cooked. Put ginger, chiles and garlic back in pan, add sauce
and reduce to a syrupy consistency, about 10 minutes. Taste and add
additional soy sauce, salt and pepper as needed. Toss the shrimp in
the sauce until coated and cook thoroughly, about 3 minutes. Remove
from heat, sprinkle with toasted sesame seeds and toss. Serve
topped with chopped green onions.

   When the downtown Atlanta Hilton scheduled an Australian brunch
for Sept. 17, executive chef Louis Spost hit the Internet to
research recipes. He plans to serve crocodile fritters, some kind
of kangaroo and this potato salad, which uses lemon myrtle oil, an
intense lemon-lime flavoring extracted from a tropical tree native
to Australia. It gives the spuds and goobers a pronounced twang.
</P>
<P>
   The oil could also be used for vinaigrette dressings and
brushing on fish _ and possibly polishing furniture. We found our
lemon myrtle through Spicehouse International in Hicksville, N.Y.,
516-942-7248. It's pricey _ $29 for about 4 ounces.
</P>
<P>
   15 cloves garlic
</P>
<P>
   2 teaspoons butter
</P>
<P>
   1 tablespoon water
</P>
<P>
   1 pound gold potatoes (or 3 large)
</P>
<P>
   1 pound red potatoes (or 3 large)
</P>
<P>
   1 pound sweet potatoes (or 2 medium)
</P>
<P>
   1/2 cup extra-virgin olive oil
</P>
<P>
   Salt and freshly ground pepper
</P>
<P>
   1 small yellow pepper
</P>
<P>
   1 small red pepper
</P>
<P>
   1 large onion, thinly sliced
</P>
<P>
   2 cups unsalted roasted peanuts
</P>
<P>
   1/4 cup balsamic vinegar
</P>
<P>
   2 teaspoons lemon myrtle oil (or, for a similar but not
identical flavor,
</P>
<P>
   substitute zest of 1 lemon)
</P>
<P>
   Preheat oven to 350 degrees. Peel loose skin off garlic.
Separate cloves and place in small baking pan with butter and
water. Roast in preheated oven for 1 hour (or until soft), adding
more water as necessary. Allow cloves to cool, remove skins, mash
and set aside. While garlic is roasting, wash, peel and dice
potatoes. Place in large roasting pan. Mix with oil, salt and
pepper to taste, and roasted garlic. Roast potato mixture during
last 35 minutes of roasting time for garlic until potatoes are
soft. Set aside. Broil peppers 4-5 inches from heat for 15 minutes
on all sides until skin is charred. (If oven is in use, this can
also be done by holding over a gas flame or on a grill.) Remove
from oven and place in a closed paper bag to cool. Remove charred
skin, stems and seed from peppers. Cut peppers into small pieces.
Toss potatoes with peppers, onion, peanuts, balsamic vinegar and
lemon myrtle oil. Mix thoroughly and serve at room temperature.

   You probably guessed that these aren't the kind of biscuits you
split open and fill with country ham. In Australia, as in England,
biscuits are cookies. These oatmeal treats probably came from the
large number of Scots who migrated to the young nation. The name
dates to World War I, when people held bake sales to show their
support for the Australia New Zealand Army Corps.
</P>
<P>
   1 cup self-rising flour

   MAIN DISH

<P>
   Barbecued Lamb Loins in Spicy Yogurt Marinade
</P>
<P>
   With Tomato and Chickpea Salad
</P>
<P>
   Makes 4 servings Preparation time: 60 minutes
</P>
<P>
   Cooking time: 10-15 minutes, plus 1 1/2 hours for the chickpeas
Marinating time: overnight
</P>
<P>
   Here's a grilled dish that lives up to the reputation of
Australian barbecues. The reason is the meat: The lamb Down Under
tastes agreeably milder than American lamb. This recipe, by
Victoria chef Alla Wolf-Tasker, comes from the collection
``Australian Food: In Celebration of the New Australian Cuisine''
(Ten Speed Press, $24.95) by Alan Saunders. We used New Zealand
lamb, a nearly identical substitute available at Whole Foods Market
and from some local butchers.
</P>
<P>
   For the marinade:
</P>
<P>
   1 teaspoon cardamom pods
</P>
<P>
   1 teaspoon cloves
</P>
<P>
   2 teaspoons black peppercorns
</P>
<P>
   1 teaspoon ground turmeric
</P>
<P>
   1 teaspoon ground cinnamon
</P>
<P>
   3 cloves garlic
</P>
<P>
   1/2 teaspoon salt
</P>
<P>
   5 small red chiles, stems and seeds removed
</P>
<P>
   1 cup cilantro leaves, washed and dried
</P>
<P>
   1 pint plain yogurt
</P>
<P>
   2 tablespoons vegetable oil
</P>
<P>
   4 (8-ounce) lamb loins
</P>
<P>
   For the Tomato and Chickpea Salad:
</P>
<P>
   8 ounces dried chickpeas, soaked overnight
</P>
<P>
   1/2 onion, chopped
</P>
<P>
   1 carrot, chopped
</P>
<P>
   3 bay leaves
</P>
<P>
   3 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil
</P>
<P>
   1 clove garlic, crushed
</P>
<P>
   3 large shallots, finely chopped
</P>
<P>
   1/2 cup cilantro leaves, washed and finely chopped
</P>
<P>
   4 medium tomatoes, peeled, seeded and diced
</P>
<P>
   Lemon juice
</P>
<P>
   Sea salt and freshly ground black pepper
</P>
<P>
   To make the marinade: Roast the cardamom pods, cloves and
peppercorns in a dry, hot frying pan. Grind the roasted spices in a
spice or coffee grinder, or use a mortar and pestle. Combine all
the marinade ingredients in a food processor or blender, adding the
yogurt and oil last. Coat the lamb in the marinade paste, cover and
leave in the refrigerator overnight.
</P>
<P>
   To make the salad: Put the chickpeas in a saucepan, cover with
water and place over medium heat. Add the onion, carrot and bay
leaves. Cook for at least 1 1/2 hours, or until the chickpeas are
tender. Allow to cool in the liquid, then drain.
</P>
<P>
   Heat the olive oil in a frying pan or skillet, add the garlic
and shallots and cook gently until softened. Remove the frying pan
from the heat and allow to cool partially, then stir in the
cilantro and cool completely. Combine with the tomato and adjust
the flavor with lemon juice, salt and pepper. Add to the chickpea
mixture and mix throughly.
</P>
<P>
   To cook the lamb: Preheat a covered kettle-style barbecue or the
oven to about 425 degrees. Place the lamb on the grill or on a
baking sheet and cook for about 10 minutes for rare. Remove from
the heat and tent with foil, to keep the meat warm, and allow to
rest for at least 15 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   To serve, slice the lamb and place on warm serving plates with
the Tomato and Chickpea Salad and some good, crusty bread.

&HT;     KEEP THE WALL BETWEEN CHURCH AND STATE 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By HELEN THOMAS  
 &HT;     c.2000 Hearst Newspapers  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _The time has come for all the candidates on the
national tickets to reaffirm their belief in the constitutional
separation of church and state.
</P>
<P>
   No one doubts the spirituality of each of the candidates. But
these days they all seem bent on blurring the line between religion
and politics. God is not on the ballot.
</P>
<P>
   No one made clearer his devotion to the wall between the church
and state than John F. Kennedy when he ran for the presidency in
1960. When Kennedy's Roman Catholic faith became a political issue
in the campaign, he was able to dispel fears that he would be
taking orders from the pope.
</P>
<P>
   In remarks before the Greater Houston Ministerial Association on
Sept. 12, 1960, he said: ``I believe in an America where the
separation of church and state is absolute, where no Catholic
prelate would tell the president (should he be Catholic) how to
act, and no Protestant minister would tell his parishioners for
whom to vote''
</P>
<P>
   The issue of religion in politics has been on the back burner
until the current campaign. Today, the four national candidates are
flaunting their spiritual beliefs as they run for the top jobs in
the nation.
</P>
<P>
   Both Vice President Al Gore, a Baptist and Texas Gov. George W.
Bush, a Methodist, have announced they are ``born again
Christians.'' Bush also said that Jesus Christ was his favorite
philosopher.
</P>
<P>
   Bush's running mate, Richard Cheney, is also a Methodist while
Gore chose Sen. Joseph Lieberman, who is the first national
candidate of Jewish faith in history. Lieberman has called his
selection a ``miracle.'' He invokes ``God'' in many of his stump
speeches and is profuse in his Biblical references. He likened the
election of Bill Clinton as president and Gore as vice president to
the parting of the Red Sea.
</P>
<P>
   He obviously enjoys his self-appointed role as the voice of
morality in the Senate for having publicly denounced Clinton for
his affair with intern Monica Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   But he also seems to have forgotten that the vice presidency is
a secular post.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking recently at a black church in Detroit, Lieberman said:
``There must be and can be a constitutional place for faith in our
public life.''
</P>
<P>
   The following day, he attended an interfaith breakfast in
Chicago where he declared: ``We are not only citizens of this
country, we are citizens of the same awesome God.''
</P>
<P>
   Not to be outdone, Bush told B'nai Brith, a Jewish service
organization: ``Our nation was chosen by God and commissioned by
history to be a model to the world of justice and inclusion and
diversity without division''
</P>
<P>
   The mixing of politics and religion is causing alarm in some
quarters.
</P>
<P>
   Abraham H. Foxman, national director of B'nai Brith's Anti
Defamation League, called on Lieberman to refrain from using
``overt expressions'' of religious beliefs, saying they were not
appropriate in campaign speeches.
</P>
<P>
   Kiki McLean, Lieberman's spokeswoman, said the senator's `faith
is an important component of who Joe Lieberman is.'' She also said
Lieberman ``always expresses his support of tolerance and the
separation of church and state.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore's spokesman, Douglas Hattaway, says Gore has no problem
with Lieberman's spiritual emphasis on the campaign trail. Gore, he
added, recognizes ``that government can't solve every problem,''
and believes religion can enhance people's lives.
</P>
<P>
   It would take a leap of faith to believe that Gore is not also
trying to steal the script of the religious right and to deflect
the taint of the Clinton White House.
</P>
<P>
   Others on the campaign trail also seem to want to cross the
line.
</P>
<P>
   Both Bush and Gore promote ``faith-based charity,'' hopefully
not in lieu of government-backed social programs that have a wider
reach to the poor.
</P>
<P>
   Every president has proclaimed his faith. It's fair to say there
have been no atheists in the White House.
</P>
<P>
   President Richard Nixon held Sunday prayer services in the White
House, inviting prominent ministers to preach in the East Room. For
members of the Cabinet, it was almost a command performance.
Government officials as well as outsiders were invited to
participate.
</P>
<P>
   As a White House correspondent, I thought that covering the
prayer service would give me easy access to the government elite,
that is until one Cabinet official stared me down and chided me for
asking him a news question ``in church.''
</P>
<P>
   When it comes to religion and the campaign, one might ask:
``Which side is God on.''
</P>
<P>
   The same question might be asked of the defiant students and
parents, urged on by some pastors and Christian broadcasters, who
stood in the bleachers in high school stadiums across the South
last weekend to recite the Lord's Prayer before the opening
kickoff.
</P>
<P>
   All the candidates have to do is look around the world to see
how well religion and politics mix.
</P>
<P>
   The Founding Fathers certainly knew and protected us from the
combination.

 &HT;    Asian influence, seafood abound in Australia's dashing `Mod-Oz'
 &HT;    By Jim Auchmutey
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   SYDNEY, Australia _ The best food in Sydney doesn't start in the
chic bistros that have multiplied during the lead-up to the
Olympics. It begins where it has for decades: under the wings of
seagulls circling a hangarlike structure beside Blackwattle Bay _
the Sydney Fish Market.
</P>
<P>
   Every weekday before dawn, the largest fish market in the
Southern Hemisphere springs to life with the snort of refrigerated
trucks, the rattle of handcarts and the crunch of shovels thrust
into ice. Scores of fishmongers sit in a grandstand facing a huge
electronic tote board and bid on the catch. It could be an
off-track betting parlor in Vegas except for the briny smell and
the water-slicked floor, lined with blue bins full of cold eyes and
spiky fins.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've got bream and snappah!'' the auctioneer announces,
cracking off the last syllable like a crab claw. ``Bream and
snappah!''
</P>
<P>
   They've also got squid and barramundi and John Dory and
sashimi-grade tuna and Tiger prawns and rock oysters and
crustaceans with strange names like yabbies and Balmain bugs.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our seafood,'' says Neil Perry, one of Sydney's top chefs,
``is simply amazing.''
</P>
<P>
   The seafood has always been here. It's what the cooks are doing
with it that has changed.
</P>
<P>
   Australia used to be strictly a fish-and-chips kind of place.
From its beginnings as a British penal colony, the nation was a
culinary prisoner, its cooking a distant imitation of the
not-so-enticing food back home. Its reputation was such that Calvin
Trillin, writing about expense-account restaurants in the States,
once complained that their continental cuisine tasted ``as if the
continent they had in mind was Australia.''
</P>
<P>
   No more. As the world tunes in to the Sydney Games in September,
it will discover a city and nation undergoing a transformation that
reminds some people of the gastronomical reawakening that began in
California a generation ago. Sydney is a city of markets and
coffeehouses and stylish restaurants where chefs are combining
local ingredients and international cooking styles _ especially
Asian and Mediterranean _ to create something fresh. Most of the
restaurants describe themselves as Modern Australian, or Mod-Oz, a
designation that didn't even appear in the Sydney Morning Herald's
dining guide a dozen years ago. Now almost half the establishments
listed come under the heading.
</P>
<P>
   The new flavors of Australia startle outsiders expecting
warmed-over roasts and puddings. ``I assumed everything was going
to be British,'' says Nathalie Dupree, the TV cook and Southern
food authority, who first visited a few years ago. ``But some of
the food just dazzled me. I was struck with how free their cooking
is of any constraints.''
</P>
<P>
   That's particularly true in Sydney, where Pacific Rim is all the
rage. The hottest chefs in town these days are wok-slingers. Whole
streets in the suburbs have been taken over by Vietnamese,
Malaysian and Singaporean restaurants. Thai kitchens have become as
common as Tex-Mex in Atlanta. The slurp of noodles has joined horns
on the harbor as a definitive sound of the city.
</P>
<P>
   Oz discovers Asia
</P>
<P>
   Yet news of the evolving Australian palate has scarcely washed
ashore on the other side of the Pacific Rim. While Australian wines
have attracted a following, Mod-Oz restaurants aren't exactly
carving a niche in America. There's only one in Manhattan, a new
place called Eight Mile Creek, and there are none in Atlanta
(although the downtown Hilton will get in the Olympic spirit with a
special Sydney brunch Sept. 17.) If the average American thinks of
Aussie eats at all, it's usually shrimp on the barbie or a Vegemite
sandwich or the bloomin' onions that Outback Steakhouse serves in a
g'day cliche out of ```Crocodile' Dundee.''
</P>
<P>
   Never mind that they don't deep-fry onions in the real Outback;
the Tampa-based chain, which will open its first franchise in
Sydney this December, makes no claim to culinary authenticity.
``Australia,'' says vice president for marketing Nancy Schneid,
``has never been known as a food capital.''
</P>
<P>
   There was a time when few Australians would have debated the
point. During its first century and a half, the nation's prime
contribution to world cuisine was Dame Nellie Melba, an opera
singer who went to Paris in the 1880s and impressed Escoffier so
much that he named a dessert after her _ Peach Melba.
</P>
<P>
   The Australian diet back then was larded with meat, stews and
puddings. ``It was nothing like what you find over there now,''
says Josephine Marcinek, an accountant in DeKalb County who grew up
in Brisbane during the '30s and '40s. ``Every week we had Sunday
tea with sliced cold joint (beef roast) and lemon-curd tarts. Very
English.''
</P>
<P>
   The fare started to modify after World War II, as immigration
laws that had once barred nonwhites were liberalized. Greeks and
Italians and Lebanese began to enter the country, bringing with
them a taste for new foods and spices.
</P>
<P>
   Cherry Ripe, the deliciously named food columnist for The
Australian newspaper, wrote about the dawning era of multicultural
cooking in her book ``Goodbye Culinary Cringe.''
</P>
<P>
   ``My mother used to go to the greengrocer and just cry, it was
so bleak,'' she remembers. ``Then she started coming back all
excited. `You'll never guess what I found today.' A baby carrot one
time. Maybe a telescope cucumber the next. Each new vegetable was a
cause for celebration.''
</P>
<P>
   The melting pot really started to bubble in the '70s as
Australia opened its doors to Vietnamese refugees and other Asian
immigrants. The newcomers brought lemongrass, turmeric, Thai basil
_ and a sense of liberation.
</P>
<P>
   ``For the first time we realized how close we were to Asia,''
says Perry, the chef/owner of Rockpool, one of Sydney's most
honored restaurants.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps no cook better embodies the metamorphosis of Australian
food than Perry. At 43, the ponytailed son of a Sydney butcher runs
three restaurants, issues best-selling cookbooks and has a
consulting business that recently refashioned the first-class meals
on Qantas airlines. He's the Wolfgang Puck of Oz.
</P>
<P>
   Perry has relished Asian cooking since he was a boy and two of
his best friends were Chinese. His menus are full of bilingual
dishes that combine local seafood and Asian flavors, like his
blue-swimmer crab omelet stir-fried in fish sauce and sesame oil
(see recipe, H4).
</P>
<P>
   ``To me, that mix of cultures is Australia,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   Back to the bush
</P>
<P>
   But some people think the Pac-Rim chefs have overlooked a
culture, the oldest one in Australia: that of the Aborigines.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can find fusion food in California, London, Tokyo. But if
you want to really represent our cuisine to the world, you have to
include the native foods that are uniquely Australian,'' says
Sydney cookbook author Vic Cherikoff.
</P>
<P>
   He's talking about bush tucker, the indigenous nuts, berries,
fruits and critters that Aborigines have eaten since before England
existed. Cherikoff sells many of them through his native foods
supply business _ uncultivated flavors like lemon aspen, a wild
citrus that's somewhere between lime and grapefruit, and wattle
seeds, a chocolaty nut that he uses to brew ``wattleccino.''
</P>
<P>
   If they're up for it, foreign journalists can sample some of the
more exotic indigenous foods during the Olympics. At the main press
center, Edna's Table, a Sydney restaurant known for its game, will
be serving emu, crocodile and kangaroo to the intrepid. (They won't
go so far as to offer the ultimate dare of Australian food _
witchetty grubs _ the plump white larvae that some Aborigines pop
into their mouths raw.)
</P>
<P>
   Should some of the media enjoy kangaroo, they wouldn't be the
first. Many visitors like it. Nathalie Dupree tried it during a
nature walk, the guide grilling kangaroo steaks as koalas looked
down from eucalyptus trees. She thought it a tasty cross between
lamb and rare duck breast.
</P>
<P>
   Australians have mixed feelings about consuming kangaroo. While
Aborigines have hunted and roasted them for thousands of years, it
was illegal until recently to sell the meat for human consumption
in parts of the country. Some Aussies still can't bring themselves
to ``eat Skippy,'' as they say, referring to ``Skippy the Bush
Kangaroo,'' a TV show that featured a heroic marsupial as a sort of
spring-loaded Lassie.
</P>
<P>
   ``Eating kangaroo would be like eating a cat,'' says Terri
Steel, a Sydney native who runs the Australian Catalogue Co.
mail-order business in Marietta.
</P>
<P>
   Steel's cats have no such compunctions. When she lived in
Sydney, they devoured the frozen kangaroo meat she bought at the
store. Now that she's living in Georgia and 'roo is tough to find,
she gives them something else to maintain their ties to the
homeland: that salty yeast extract that can bring tears of
nostalgia to any Aussie expatriate.
</P>
<P>
   ``My cats,'' she says, ``love Vegemite.''

 &HT;    All about Aussie, at your fingertips
 &HT;    By Betty Parham

<TEXT>
<P>
   It happens every four years. When a city hosts the Olympics, a
veritable polyglot nation of the world's media descends upon it.
Not just to relay scores and sports news but to dissect and report
upon every aspect of life in the Olympic city. The good, the bad
and the ugly of a city, along with who wins the medals, are exposed
to the world. Including the food.
</P>
<P>
   When the Games were held in Atlanta in 1996, reporting on
Southern cooking was a fairly easy task. Before long, people from
around the globe had read or heard of or tasted such Southern
classics as grits, barbecue, corn bread, peach cobbler and catfish.
But the job of the media to report on the food of Australia will
not be such a cinch. The cuisine from Down Under is so diverse and
so different from that of any other place in the world, it's
difficult to pin down.
</P>
<P>
   To better understand the fascinating cuisine of this most
fascinating country and to search out some Aussie recipes to help
you cook up some Olympic spirit while you watch the Games, see
these Web sites.

series. Working your way through the contents of the 13 episodes
will give you an idea of the diversity of Australian cuisine. Each
show spotlights amazing ingredients, a chef, a feast and foods and
menus that uniquely blend together cuisines from the world over.
Chinese, Italian, Belgian, German, French, Dutch, African,
Caribbean, Hungarian, Cuban and Spanish are just a sample of the

each dish.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Kangaroo
</P>

<P>
   &QR;  Bush food
</P>
<P>
   Australian Aborigines have been preparing this land's food
resources for the past 40,000 years and have a unique cuisine using
fruits, berries, herbs, plants, game and even insects that the rest
of the world has never heard of, much less tasted.
</P>
<P>
   Recently, though, Aboriginal foods are coming into mainstream
kitchens as chefs _ specifically, Chinese, Italian, Thai and French
_ discover and incorporate the unique flavors into their menus.
</P>
<P>
   See www.bushtucker.com.au (also www.cherikoff.com.au), the site
for Cherikoff the Rare Spice Co., for an overview of these foods
and sources to acquire such bush delicacies as akudjura (ground
bush tomato), illawarra plums, lemon aspen juice and munthari
berry.
</P>
<P>
   There, you'll also find numerous recipes using this exotica,

<P>
   The Australian Food Source at www.eatyabbies.com gets you to the

crawfish), barramundi (a tasty tropical fish) and other Aussie
delicacies. The importer is supplying live, farm-raised yabbies to
Whole Foods Market in Atlanta, which should have them for sale any
day.
</P>
<P>
   The Australian Catalogue Co. at www.aussiecatalog.com is run by
Terri Steel of Marietta, a native of Sydney. She sells all sorts of
Australia stuff, including a bunch of packaged foods like Vegemite,
Tim Tam biscuits (cookies) and musk Lifesavers. She even sells a
Vegemite cookbook.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking of Vegemite, if you are a fan of Australia's national
spread, see www.ozchannel.com/vegemite.
</P>
<P>
   If you're hankering for emu, see the American Emu Association's
site at www.aea-emu.org. Unlike kangaroo, the other native animal
that Australians eat, emu is raised in the United States. The site
lists local suppliers.

 &HT;    Corn bread takes cheeses and broccoli
 &HT;    By Marcia Langhenry
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   When we published a corn bread recipe recently that contained
shrimp, it prompted Pat Cornick of Peachtree City, Ga., to ask for
one she remembered that included broccoli, and cottage and cheddar
cheeses. Several readers responded, including Susan Lindley of
Atlanta. She sent this one she got about 10 years ago from the
Farmers Market Bulletin published by the Georgia Department of
Agriculture.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is not low fat, but it is wonderful,'' Lindley said.

 &HT;    Think of your brows as just hair above your eyes? Browse this!
 &HT;    By Kim Folstad
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. - Chances are slim that a course in
eyebrow history will be added to women's studies curricula any time
soon.
</P>
<P>
   But the evolution of that expressive arch can tell us a lot
about feminism, as well as femininity, says Cynthia Robins,
co-author of ``The Eyebrow'' (ReganBooks, $30).
</P>
<P>
   In this glossy new guide dedicated solely to our uppermost
facial feature, Robins and celebrity makeup artist Robyn Cosio
explore how cultural changes have shaped women's brows. And they
chart those changes through the centuries, from the exaggerated
eyebrows of the ancient Egyptians to the pierced brows of today.
</P>
<P>
   Usually, there's more behind a trend than mere whim, Robins
says. Take, for example, the switch from the all-out glamour of the
'30s to the fuss-free look of the '40s, when women tried to achieve
``a beauty that's responsible _ not a responsibility.''
</P>
<P>
   The men had gone to war, and ``Rosie the Riveter'' went to work;
beauty products and the time it took to use them were a luxury. ``A
woman wasn't going to sit there for an hour, plucking her
eyebrows,'' Robins says.
</P>
<P>
   And again, when women transitioned from the ``skinny commas,
paisleys or tadpoles'' of the '70s to the ``generous'' brows of the
'80s, it wasn't just to provide visual balance to their shoulder
pads. ``Greed is good'' was a mantra for the times, the authors of
``The Eyebrow'' point out. ``Everything about the 1980s was
generous and overblown,'' and makeup styles reflected that
attitude.
</P>
<P>
   So what will an aesthetic anthropologist write some day about
the brows at the turn of this century?
</P>
<P>
   Ahhhh.
</P>
<P>
   The style for 2000 is a clean but natural brow _ geared to the
face instead of what's in vogue, says Robins, who is fashion and
beauty editor at the San Francisco Examiner.
</P>
<P>
   This is the brow that Cosio _ whose client list includes Jamie
Lee Curtis, Vanessa Redgrave and Lesley Stahl _ has been touting
for years. ``She designs an eyebrow for the face. The hell with the
trend,'' Robins adds.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, not every woman is ready to give up on the brow-do to
which she's become attached, Robins knows. A woman can get
``permaplaqued in time'' when she gets wedded to the look she had
when she felt the prettiest, or most confident, or was at her
sexual peak.
</P>
<P>
   Just as you'll see a woman who's held onto a favorite hairstyle
long past its freshness date (Farrah Fawcett feathering, for
example, or the Dorothy Hamill wedge), there are those whose brows
still reflect their hippie or disco heydays.
</P>
<P>
   Then there are the ``back-to-earthers,'' who protest plucking
even one out-of-place hair, Robins says, and the ``mommies'' who
are so busy they reluctantly retire their tweezers for a few years.
Robins understands, but she warns: ``Your eyebrows can change how
people think about you. And we all know you only get one chance to
make a first impression.''
</P>
<P>
   Heavy brows that sit too close together can make a person look
angry, Robins and Cosio have found. On the flip side, brows that
have been shaved or plucked to a thin semicircle can be just as
off-putting, they caution.
</P>
<P>
   Robins recommends going to a professional regularly to have
brows properly groomed, even for today's ``natural'' look.
</P>
<P>
   ``To me, plucking your own eyebrows is asking for trouble,'' she
says. ``But not everyone can afford to have it done.'' For those
who don't have the time or the cash to make that monthly trip to
the salon, ``The Eyebrow `` (and, often, beauty magazines and
books) includes a do-it-yourself guide.
</P>
<P>
   Either way, it may take a while to get your brows just the way
you want them. But with patience and a little pain, you can get
what aestheticians call an ``instant face-lift.''
</P>
<P>
   ``That's the beauty of it,'' Robins says.

 LOS ANGELES: in Moss Beach. 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Moss Beach Distillery Restaurant, Beach Way and Ocean Boulevard,
Moss Beach, (650) 728-5595
</P>
<P>
   Supposedly haunted, this ramshackle building was a delivery
point for liquor smugglers during Prohibition. The place still
rests on those laurels (and the killer view). The food is not much,
but they charge a lot for it. Buffalo wings are $13.95, a Caesar
salad is $8.95. But if you're tempted to stop _ and you will be,
because the patio is outfitted with chairs and blankets _ order the
steamers. A pound of clams and mussels cooked in herb butter is
$15.95 and is plenty for two to share.
</P>
<P>
   _
</P>
<P>
   It's difficult not to love San Francisco, despite $3,000-a-month
rents for an 1,800-square-foot loft, parking fees to grocery shop
and unpredictable cab service. The women don't use hairspray, the
men all travel in comfortable shoes and there's further evidence of
laissez faire across the bridge in Berkeley. There's a visible lack
of the dot.com money that is pumping through the city these days.
</P>
<P>
   And there are the neighborhoods.
</P>
<P>
   Driving over San Francisco hills, getting lost only twice, we
spotted Thanh Long on the edge of Golden Gate Park.
</P>
<P>
   Thanh Long, 4101 Judah St., San Franciso, (415) 665-1146: Opened
in 1971 by Diana An, this wandering maze of rooms bustles with
families late on a Sunday evening.
</P>
<P>
   Despite a tab for two that runs near $100, families of eight to
12 diners are tucking into whole Dungeness crab roasted in butter
and cracked black pepper _ at a market price of $32 each in August.
The rest of the menu is surprising fusionesque with dishes such as
shaken beef _ cubes of New York steak flambeed medium rare and
served ``au jus'' on a bed of potatoes, mixed greens and cherry
tomatoes for $16.50.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the creative menu, the crowd is not avocational
restaurant grazers, it's Asian families ending (or beginning) the
week. Perhaps this is where all the dot.com money goes. It
certainly makes more sense than an 8,000-square-foot zero-lot-line
home with bathrooms the size of Delaware and a room devoted to gift
wrapping. Make reservations _ dot.coms are still doing fine,
despite the March scare.
</P>
<P>
   _
</P>
<P>
   I scheduled Gilroy as a mandatory stop on my journey through
California. My resume must note that I've eaten in the Garlic
Capital of the World.
</P>
<P>
   But when I stopped in at the Gilroy Garlic Festival office to
get some restaurant recommendations, the festival representative
looked as if I'd asked for the impossible.
</P>
<P>
   ``Well, there really is no special garlic dish. A continental
place down the street has a garlic soup sometime, but I don't know
if they'll have it today. But they do have a garlic burger. And
there's an Italian place down the road that, of course, uses a lot
of garlic.''
</P>
<P>
   Allllrighty then. I'd try the burger, but if that didn't work
out, maybe I could find some garlic earrings to prove my
pilgrimage.
</P>
<P>
   Harvest Time Restaurant, 7397 Monterey St., Gilroy, (408)
842-7575
</P>
<P>
   Here's the difference between loving garlic, to which I
willingly confess, and living with garlic. Ms. Festival
Representative, living with garlic, is oblivious to its presence.
</P>
<P>
   Harvest Time, the ``continental'' restaurant down the street, is
delightful, a toughened-up tea room that won't keep away the ladies
but also won't simper to the brokers and farmers who might stop in.
It was full with both during a Tuesday lunch.
</P>
<P>
   I ordered that recommended garlic burger _ a hamburger basted
with roasted garlic _ and for good measure, added the appetizer of
baked heads of whole garlic.
</P>
<P>
   Pretty heavy on the garlic, but I'm not a woman of halves.
However, I knew I was sunk when the waitress delivered the
pre-lunch bread. At Harvest, the bread is served with a bowl of
garlic butter plus a dish of pickled garlic cloves. Hmmm _ what to
do? Well, here's the benefit of dining alone _ I ate it all.
</P>
<P>
   Then I dug into the appetizer: three baked heads of garlic. I
squeezed the soft pulp from the silvery peel, smearing it onto the
bread and then topping it with a swipe of equally subtle feta
spread.
</P>
<P>
   And then came the burger _ an (almost) Texas size affair with an
aroma of more garlic _ soaked up (well, sorta) by the fries on the
side. Oh, boy, I wasn't going to need to buy those earrings after
all.
</P>
<P>
   I did, however, have to make a stop before hitting the highway.
Thank goodness Texaco stocks Rolaids.
</P>
<P>
   Next week: Only in California _ a 50-year-old Los Angeles
hamburger chain, complete with paper-boat hats for the servers,
caters to diners on today's popular low-carbohydrate diets.

CALIFORNIA, HERE I COME, PACKING AN APPETITE
</HEADLINE>

 c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Do not think that all of California is Wolfgang
Puck. In fact, most of California is Spago-free, tending more
toward Spaghetti Warehouse than pizza with artichokes.
</P>
<P>
   But rather than spaghetti, I drove into flat 1950s-movie-set
Bakersfield wanting to check out one of this agricultural town's
Basque restaurants _ legendary trencherman spots that originated to
serve the Spanish shepherds who helped settle the area.
</P>
<P>
   But I had car trouble outside Barstow _ my rental car decided to
shut off in the middle of the Mojave Desert _ and didn't pull in
until linner, those weird hours between lunch and dinner when
decent people are at their desks. And the Basques are punctual,
shutting their restaurants promptly at 2 p.m.
</P>
<P>
   Well, if I couldn't have Basque, what would be next best? Buck
Owens is known to serve a mean chicken-fried steak at his
honky-tonk, but the Crystal Palace also shuts up its sequins during
the day.
</P>
<P>
   So I opted for the next best thing for a Texas girl on the road.
</P>
<P>
   Hodel's, 5917 Knudsen Drive, Bakersfield (661) 399-3341:)
</P>
<P>
   The Hodel's complex is a family-owned version of Luby's _ minus
the tea ladies and the LuAnn platter. It's more what hearty
Midwesterners call a smorgasbord _ a church-supper version of home
cooking with as many return trips as you could ever pray for. (More
polite versions are called buffets and add sushi and a Champagne
fountain to the salads so they can charge $20 a person, plus
parking.)
</P>
<P>
   But the Hodel family _ Mom Hodel was the founder _ would feel
quite at home in Texas. The groaning tables were filled with all
sorts of things that we love: lots of mayonnaise-based salads,
mashed potatoes, fall-apart pot roast plus a couple of colors of
Jell-O. And on the end of one of the steam tables is a bowl of
escabeche, those hot pickled peppers that seem to have made their
way from Mexico out into the great big world.
</P>
<P>
   Hodel's is the perfect place to make a family stop when driving
through the flatlands of California. You might even think you're
still in Texas;_ the surrounding territory looks an awful lot like
Midland-Odessa on a bad hair day.
</P>
<P>
   _
</P>
<P>
   As much as I appreciate the agricultural bounty that California
delivers to the rest of the country, I was headed for the bridges
of San Francisco. I drove across the dinge of central California to
reach the lushness _ day lilies blooming in August, a morning of no
moisturizer needed _ just at dusk. As in dark, as in having no clue
where I was going. As in, don't you remember this same car stopping
outside of Barstow and what makes you think it's not going to stop
going across the Bay Bridge? As in, you're already training your
8-year-old son how to ask for directions.
</P>
<P>
   As in, two hours later (after, ahem, a couple of trips back and
forth over that same Bay Bridge) I arrived at my destination. No
dinner for this girl _ a bottle of that California wine will be
lovely, thank you so much.
</P>
<P>
   The next day is northern California summer heaven; it's sunny,
but a Texan is tempted to grab a sweater because of a morning
temperature less than 90 degrees.
</P>
<P>
   So it's a drive in a convertible _ this is really possible,
fellow Texans, during August, in other parts of the country _ down
the edge of the state just south of San Francisco. And then I run
into another peculiarity of California:
</P>
<P>
   The highways are so revered that they have more than one name.
This one has at least three: El Camino Highway, California Highway
1 and Pacific Coast Highway. Despite the identity crisis, it is one
of the country's great paved stretches.
</P>
<P>
   Ice plant crops up along the dunes, surfers are dancing the
waves, and I've not sneezed once because of the ozone. Ahhhh. Then
I see it _ a piece of home.
</P>
<P>
   The Taco Bell With The World's Best View, 5200 Cabrillo Highway,
California Highway 1 or Pacific Coast Highway (650) 355-0591
</P>
<P>
   Texans who have relocated to California complain about the
Mexican food. Too much sour cream, they say. No cumin, they note.
Fajitas that are stir-fried, they complain. So when a Tex-Mex fix
hits, they generally head for Taco Bell, the closest thing they can
find.
</P>
<P>
   If they're lucky, they find this Taco Bell, a former upscale
seafood restaurant that couldn't make the rent. It's no wonder that
corporate food does the trick here. The kids will eat the food,
you'll get a vacation price break and with the stunning view of the
Pacific, the rocks, the surf, the day trippers, you can also get an
ersatz gordita.
</P>
<P>
   The food may be familiar, but be certain _ you're nowhere near
Dallas.
</P>
<P>
   _
</P>
<P>
   Moving farther down the highway, it's difficult not to stop
again. And if you'd like something a bit more historic than the
home of the chihuahua, there are several possibilities. One is an
old rum-running spot in Moss Beach.

   Q: Was the song ``People'' recorded first by a male vocalist
prior to Barbara Streisand?
</P>
<P>
   _ S.W., Granbury, Texas
</P>
<P>
   A: The song originated with Barbara Streisand in the 1964
musical ``Funny Girl'' and was included on her album ``People,''
released the same year.
</P>
<P>
   Only a few ``People'' covers turned up in a search of music
databases on the Internet: Wayne King recorded a waltz included on
``The Best of Wayne King'' in 1987, Shirley Bassey's 1960s-era
version was included on her 1997 collection ``I'm in the Mood for
Love'' and Claire Moore recorded it for the CD ``Celebrating Jule
Styne,'' released in February.
</P>
<P>
   Streisand told CNN in 1996 that she once disliked the song,
changing her mind by the time she left ``Funny Girl'' in 1965. ``I
remember my first argument with Jule Styne and Bob Merrill, saying,
`Isn't it people who don't need people who are the luckiest people
in the world?' '' she said.

   A: Tom ``Wimpy'' Paciorek resigned in October 1999 to spend more
time with his family, ending a 12-season streak of broadcasting
games with Ken ``Hawk'' Harrelson.
</P>
<P>
   A Detroit native and University of Houston graduate, Paciorek
occasionally fills in for Kirk Gibson on Detroit Tigers TV
broadcasts.
</P>
<P>
   The White Sox replaced Paciorek during the off-season with one
of the team's players, 36-year-old outfielder Darren Jackson, who
retired after 12 seasons in the majors.
</P>

</P>
<P>
   A: Write to her in care of International Creative Management,
8942 Wilshire Blvd., Beverly Hills, CA 90211.
</P>
<P>
   Ehle, 30, is the daughter of actress Rosemary Harris and
screenwriter John Ehle. She had a lead role in the 1995 miniseries
``Pride and Prejudice'' and was in the films ``This Year's Love''
and ``Sunshine'' last year.
</P>
<P>
   When she won the best actress Tony Award for the Tom Stoppard
play ``The Real Thing'' this year, one of the other nominees was

THE HEAVY METAL JOKE NOT EVERYONE GOT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For release Sunday, September 3)  
 By JOHN LELAND    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   When the makers of ``This Is
Spinal Tap'' first showed their movie to test audiences in 1984,
the reaction was noteworthy. The people hated it. Shot in deadpan
documentary style, the film tells the story of a fictional heavy
metal band blazing a spandex trail across America. The audience did
not get it. Some objected that the band was too obscure and poor;
others thought the filmmakers should have chosen a good band, like
Led Zeppelin. One answered every question about the movie with
three cryptic letters, DNA.
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``It took us a long time to figure out what this meant,'' said
Michael McKean, who played the band's singer and guitarist, David
St. Hubbins. ``Finally, we realized it meant Does Not Apply. She
disliked everything about the movie so much that no possible
standards could apply to any part of it.''
</P>
<P>
   The people had spoken. ``It was kind of scary,'' McKean said. As
the St. Hubbins character observes in the film, ``It's such a fine
line between stupid and clever.'' The filmmakers had found this
line, and their audience was on the other side of it.
</P>
<P>
   Sixteen years later, ``This Is Spinal Tap'' returns to theaters
on Friday as an established language, a universal shorthand for
unintended farce. When a video at the Democratic National
Convention showed President Clinton making his endless march to the
stage, USA Today observed, ``It looked more like a scene out of
`This Is Spinal Tap.''' The film's title has become a punch line
waiting to reveal any subject as a joke, the more deadly serious
the better.
</P>
<P>
   For cultists, MGM Home Entertainment is also releasing a digital
videodisc of the film, with more than an hour of added footage,
most of which has been circulating for years on bootleg
videocassettes. The longer version includes, among other things, a
chance to see the band's Sinatra-obsessed limo driver, played by
Bruno Kirby, getting stoned and singing ``My Way'' in his
underpants.
</P>
<P>
   The difference between the first reception of ``Spinal Tap'' and
its current status is the story of an American mode of viewing. In
1984, test audiences could not recognize the movie's knowing wink;
the pretensions of the heavy rock experience were still sacrosanct.
</P>
<P>
   Now even the pomp of the presidency is wrapped in quotation
marks, humbled as it stands straight-faced before people who know
too much about the contrived conditions of its manufacture.
Musicians like Kid Rock, and movies like the ``Scream'' series, now
routinely build self-parody into their voices, having their camp
and eating it too. This rockumentary _ directed by Rob Reiner and
improvised by McKean, Christopher Guest, Harry Shearer and others _
helped usher in the era of reflexive irony.
</P>
<P>
   The movie follows the American tour of an aging English heavy
metal band whose fortunes are turning sour _ or, as their
perpetually harassed manager, played by Tony Hendra, puts it, whose
``appeal is becoming more selective.'' As gigs go bad, or don't go
at all, the stage gimmicks and corporate weaselry that bands like
Spinal Tap depend on to generate the effect of spontaneous hysteria
at their shows start to clamber into the foreground.
</P>
<P>
   All the gears become visible. Stage props don't work; a
Stonehenge megalith, meant to tower 18 feet over the band, comes in
at 18 inches, a dramaturgic whammy lost to bungled paperwork. Even
anthems like ``Big Bottom,'' the band's paean to full-bodied women
(``How can I leave this behind?''), are no longer enough to rally
the faithful.
</P>
<P>
   The boys in the band remain charmingly benighted, but the magic
becomes tortured; once we see it, it loses its spell. In the gap
between the effect the band thinks it creates and the one it really
does, the film's satire works its mischief.
</P>
<P>
   ``This Is Spinal Tap'' arrived in theaters just as the public
fascination with the processes of the entertainment business was
beginning to take the place of simple interest in stars. Reiner's
deft grasp of the small details _ the barracuda record company
liaison, the tragic bad luck with drummers _ anticipated Robert
Altman's arch film ``The Player'' as well as all the ``Access
Hollywood''-type syndicated television shows and Web sites
dedicated to behind-the-scenes arcana.
</P>
<P>
   The movie's satire escaped some early audiences in part because
the band was so generic. It was the industry architecture around it
that resonated. The band members just had to seem small enough to
live in it.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike Altman's 1975 movie ``Nashville,'' which poked into the
machinery of country music as a metaphor for the moral smarm of
post-Watergate America, ``This Is Spinal Tap'' does not aim at any
larger cultural game. Reflexive irony runs broad, but it does not
run too deep. With its droll wit, the film sends up the band
members' affectations while leaving their souls unscathed. The
music industry is silly but not craven. The band meets even its
harshest criticism _ one review read on camera describes them as
``treading water in a sea of retarded sexuality and bad poetry''_
with addled equanimity.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's nit-picking, isn't it?'' responds Nigel Tufnel, the
band's fecklessly thick guitarist, played by Guest in a performance
so low-key as to be near subsonic. They're ridiculous not because
they fail to live up to rock's ennobling promise, but because they
believe it has one. And they're lovable, because to them, at least,
it does. As hopeless as they are on the road, they'd be even more
lost off it.
</P>
<P>
   The actors wrote and played all the music themselves, striving
to be the best poor heavy metal band they could be. By the time
they revived the characters for the ``Break Like the Wind'' concert
tour in 1992, the audience was ready to join in the gag.
</P>
<P>
   ``We finally figured out what was so much fun,'' McKean said.
``We were pretending to be this big rock 'n' roll band, and they
were pretending to be our fans. So they built these Stonehenge
monuments and threw them onstage, made us T-shirts. It was just the
best. We know that there's a big lie at the center of this. We know
there really is no Spinal Tap.'' But in the movie's gentle parody,
you could play along without being splashed by the bile.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, there are unintended consequences to all this
reflexive satire. ``This Is Spinal Tap'' returns to theaters less
than one month after ``Gimme Shelter,'' the documentary about the
Rolling Stones' 1969 tour, which ended in tragedy at Altamont
Speedway. These are possibly the two best movies ever about rock
'n' roll. In 1984, the dumbfounded test audiences saw ``Spinal
Tap'' in the towering shadow of the Stones; these days, it is
difficult not to see ``Gimme Shelter'' at least partly through the
mocking prism of its successor. The juxtaposition is not kind to
the Stones, whose self-serious identification as ``the greatest
rock 'n' roll band in the world'' finds a lighter echo in Spinal
Tap's claim to be ``one of England's loudest bands.''
</P>
<P>
   The two bands seem similarly preposterous in their plumage; it's
such a fine line between the Stones' sympathy for the devil and
Tap's return to Stonehenge. From different sides, each movie
documents the fall of rock 'n' roll innocence _ as Marx said, first
as tragedy, then as farce.
</P>
<P>
   For the record, the fictional band claims to have been
misrepresented by the movie. Speaking by telephone, Shearer slipped
into his character, Derek Smalls, to convey the band's feelings of
betrayal. ``There were dozens of days when we found our way to the
stage'' without getting lost, he said.
</P>
<P>
   But he said the musicians were taken in by the director's guile,
and by their own need for attention. Smalls described a seduction
in which the director ``comes in as `Oh, I'm your biggest fan.'
Right away, we should have been suspicious. But we were so
desperate for people who were our biggest fans that we let down our
guard.''
</P>
<P>
   This desperation runs underneath the Rolling Stones to ``Spinal
Tap'' to the president, an aching to be loved that, once exposed,
lends itself to easy satire. ``This Is Spinal Tap'' asked audiences
to split their gaze, to see the band as both real and parody at the
same time.
</P>
<P>
   These days, anyone can walk the fine line between stupid and
clever. But ``This Is Spinal Tap'' walked it with a cucumber down
its trousers, and sometimes that is the most righteous stroll of
all.

   You've had a prescription filled, and along with the pills you
get a slip of paper instructing you to ``take this medication
exactly as prescribed.''
</P>
<P>
   Lots of people don't take their prescriptions the way they've
been told, and that's a real problem. But did you ever wonder
whether doctors themselves comply with prescriptions?
</P>
<P>
   According to the June issue of the Southern Medical Journal,
they are more compliant than the average patient. But they're still
not perfect.
</P>
<P>
   Researchers at New York Medical College in Valhalla, N.Y.,
surveyed 301 physicians and nurses about the way they comply with
instructions on taking medication.
</P>
<P>
   For short-term drugs such as antibiotics, the adherence rate is
about 77 percent. And for long-term medications, such as those for
high blood pressure or high cholesterol, the rate is 84 percent.
</P>
<P>
   The survey finds that older physicians and nurses are better at
taking medications than younger ones, and that everyone fares
better with medications that require one or two doses a day than
with drugs that need three or four daily doses.

INDONESIA WAITS TO SEE IF SUHARTO WILL ATTEND HIS OWN TRIAL 
</HEADLINE>
  (EDS: This early version will be updated as needed.) 
 By MARK LANDLER   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   JAKARTA, Indonesia _ As Indonesia prepared to put its fallen
leader, Suharto, on trial here Thursday, the government on
Wednesday finished elaborate preparations _ converting the
auditorium of a state ministry into an oversized courtroom,
enlisting 1,200 police officers for security, even requisitioning a
helicopter to evacuate Suharto in case he comes under threat or
needs medical help.
</P>
<P>
   But the one thing prosecutors cannot control is the defendant
himself.
</P>
<P>
   Suharto's doctors are scheduled to examine him three hours
before the hearing begins on Thursday. If they determine that the
79-year-old former president is too ill to attend, the trial will
stop before it starts.
</P>
<P>
   For months, Suharto's lawyers have said that their client, who
was hospitalized twice last year after a stroke, is too frail to
answer charges that he swindled hundreds of millions of dollars
through his charitable organizations during his three decades as
Indonesia's ruler.
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutors have vowed to pursue the case, even if Suharto fails
to appear. An adviser to Attorney General Marsuki Darusman said
Wednesday evening that ``It's 50-50 that Suharto will be there.''
</P>
<P>
   Guessing whether the defendant will show up has become a sort of
parlor game here in recent days, as demonstrators have marched,
prosecutors have made tough statements and newspapers have mused
about Suharto's state of mind. Few people will be surprised if he
pleads illness.
</P>
<P>
   Even after the tumultuous changes that followed Suharto's ouster
in May 1998, people here are skeptical that their stunted legal
system can take on a strongman who ruled this country for 32 years,
amassing a vast fortune and turning Indonesia into a byword for
corruption.
</P>
<P>
   The stakes go beyond Suharto's own future. Legal experts and
political analysts said that unless the government successfully
prosecutes the former president, Indonesia will never cleanse
itself of a legacy of corruption and impunity that ranges from
financial scandals to military massacres.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have to make an example of Suharto,'' said Umar Juoro, a
former adviser to Suharto's successor, B.J. Habibie. ``Bring him
into the court, charge him, convict him and then pardon him if
necessary. But we must demonstrate that everybody is the same
before the law.''
</P>
<P>
   The case against Suharto was dealt its first setback under
former President Habibie, when his government dropped its
investigation of him in October, saying it could not turn up enough
evidence. That decision drew howls of protest from people here, and
it contributed to Habibie's ignominious withdrawal from the
presidential election held later that month.
</P>
<P>
   Habibie's successor, President Abdurrahman Wahid, swiftly
reopened the case. And his prosecutors have steadily tightened the
noose around Suharto _ placing him under city arrest in April,
house arrest in May and formally charging him with corruption
earlier this month.
</P>
<P>
   Wahid has promised to pardon Suharto _ but only after he is
judged. The president has also suggested that Suharto could strike
a deal by returning money stolen from the state. One of Wahid's
senior advisers, Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono, began negotiations with
members of the Suharto family. But he said Wednesday that those
talks had been suspended.
</P>
<P>
   Suharto and his family are accused of building a
multibillion-dollar fortune by siphoning off state funds and
steering contracts to family-owned firms. But Darusman, the
attorney general, has focused on a narrower set of allegations
involving seven tax-free foundations. Suharto is accused of
funneling at least $150 million through the foundations into
personal accounts.
</P>
<P>
   While Jakarta has been peaceful in recent months, people worry
that Suharto's trial could inflame old passions. Demonstrators for
and against the former president have rallied this week in front of
the South Jakarta District Court. Student leaders said Wednesday
that they would gather Thursday at the site of the trial, defying a
police ban on demonstrations.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Critics say the case falls far short of the broad prosecution
that Suharto deserves. The prosecutors say they are sticking to
charges that they can prove. Suharto threw a cloak of legitimacy
over many of his financial deals by issuing presidential decrees,
which have legal standing.
</P>
<P>
   Suharto's trial is so important because it comes at a time when
the struggle for Indonesia's future has shifted from the streets
into the courtroom. His case is one of nearly a dozen
investigations and prosecutions of people who were officials,
cronies or tycoons in the Suharto era.
</P>
<P>
   Indonesia's record with legal cases is uneven. On Monday,
parliament voted to investigate allegations that close aides to
Wahid had misappropriated $4.2 million from the state logistics
agency and a $2 million donation from the Sultan of Brunei.
</P>
<P>
   The same day, a Jakarta court acquitted a central figure in a
scandal involving one of Indonesia's largest banks, Bank Bali.
Noting that the defendant had admitted taking $64 million, The
Jakarta Post said the ruling ``created a very large dent in the
nationwide campaign against corruption.''

EXPERTS SQUARE OFF IN A HEATED DEBATE ON THE BEST WAY TO GRILL
</HEADLINE>
  (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
 By BEVERLY BUNDY 
 c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   SANTA FE, N.M. _ They're the best of friends, these three
cookbook writers, but when it comes to the art of grilling, they
march to different kettledrums.
</P>
<P>
   Cheryl Alters Jamison and Bill Jamison have written a phalanx of
award-winning grilling books, including ``Born To Grill'' and
``Smoke &AMP; Spice,'' testing and creating recipes at their converted
adobe dairy barn in Tesuque, N.M., just outside Santa Fe.
Outfitting their enclosed garden with smokers, kettles, gas grills
and an outdoor fireplace, they've run food through countless trials
by fire.
</P>
<P>
   Across town, Michael McLaughlin has done the same. McLaughlin's
latest books, ``The Southwestern Grill'' and ``All on The Grill,''
are a continuation of more than 25 years of cheffing and writing
and co-writing books, including ``The Silver Palate Cookbook.''
</P>
<P>
   So when open-fire restrictions in conflagration-plagued New
Mexico were lifted this summer, the trio took off the oven mitts
and pleasantly thrashed out their grilling differences.
</P>
<P>
   After mixing a batch of margaritas, substituting blackberry
brandy for the empty bottle of Triple Sec, they set to work cooking
recipes from their books. (It should be noted, all recipe-dependent
readers, that authors do look up their own recipes in their
cookbooks when they're cooking at home.)
</P>
<P>
   The Jamisons prefer using an open fire of natural charcoal. In
fact, almost all of their test equipment (except their beloved
smokers) has been discarded in favor of their fireplace _ a simple
grate that straddles a hot fire.
</P>
<P>
   Bill, a cerebral sort, explains the choice in almost scholarly
terms.
</P>
<P>
   ``Grilling is using the highest heat possible to create a crust
on the surface of the food. We don't think cooking on a covered
kettle is technically grilling.''
</P>
<P>
   It's a purist approach.
</P>
<P>
   Cheryl, the practical sort, agrees with her husband but sees the
process more in cooking terms.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the popularity of the Weber exploded because backyard
cooks had so many flare-ups. The flare-ups were a result of all the
marinades and the sauces people were using back in the 1950s. Some
of those marinades had a cup of oil in them,'' Cheryl says.
``People take the food out of the marinades and throw it sopping
wet onto the grill. What you get is steamed food, not grill food,
from the smoke that occurs when the sauce hits the charcoal and
then the cover is put on the grill.''
</P>
<P>
   ``That's another issue I have. A lot of recipes call for cooking
shrimp in the peel on the grill. Again, you're steaming the shrimp
and not getting the grill flavor onto the meat,'' she says as she
piles tail-on grilled shrimp into a large margarita glass. The
presentation is restaurant-worthy.
</P>
<P>
   ``Oh,'' Bill says in passing to McLaughlin, ``You're using Pam
on the grill?''
</P>
<P>
   ``No, I'm using it on the quesadilla,'' replies McLaughlin,
wincing at the design flaw in his brand-new Weber Genesis Platinum
that renders the metal handle of the $1,500 gas grill untouchable.
Despite the glitch, McLaughlin prefers cooking with covered grills.
</P>
<P>
   ``Cooking with charcoal is an art form,'' McLaughlin says, ``and
I think beginners have better control with gas. A covered grill,
gas or charcoal, is more controlled and more reliable, especially
if you live in a windy place. The heat stays more even, if you work
with wood chips the flavor goes into the food, and flare-ups are
reduced, though not eliminated.
</P>
<P>
   ``I like gas because it eliminates the guesswork, not causes it.
It's charcoal for me that requires holding the hand over the flame
and waiting for the pan, all very awkward.
</P>
<P>
   ``Grilling over an open flame for fairly small or thin foods
works great,'' McLaughlin says in agreement with the Jamisons.
``I'm not against much except precooking foods for the grill, which
is almost never necessary.''
</P>
<P>
   And when the tongs are put away and the three tuck into one
anothers' tenderloin sandwiches and fish tacos, they agree _
everything grilled tastes great under a starry New Mexico sky.

 &HT;    Publishers now courting African-American readers
 &HT;    By Don O'Briant
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Until Terry McMillan proved them wrong with her best-selling
``Waiting to Exhale,'' most New York publishers ignored the
African-American market as basically a non-reading audience.

   Authors such as Tajuana ``TJ'' Butler and former Atlantan E.
Lynn Harris had to resort to publishing their own books. Harris
sold copies of ``Invisible Life'' out of the back of his car and in
beauty parlors. Butler, whose novel ``Sorority Sisters'' was
published this year by Villard, peddled copies of her
self-published books to black-owned businesses.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I first started publishing myself, I was advised against
it because I was told the industry frowned upon it. But within the
African-American community I saw lots of sales,'' says Harris, a
Doubleday author with 2 million books in print.
</P>
<P>
   With Harris and fellow author Eric Jerome Dickey now regularly
landing on the best-seller list, more doors are opening for black
writers.
</P>
<P>
   In September, Kensington Publishing will launch a new line of
fiction and nonfiction for African-Americans, and next winter
Random House will follow suit with its Strivers Row imprint.
</P>
<P>
   Kensington plans 12 titles for the first year on topics from
mysteries to health. The list includes ``Souls of My Sisters: Black
Women Break Their Silence, Tell Their Stories and Heal Their
Spirit'' by Dawn Marie Daniels and Candace Sandy, and ``Looking for
Luv,'' a novel by Carl Weber.
</P>
<P>
   ``After Terry McMillan's success, blacks were buying books (by
African-Americans) just because of the novelty. Taste wasn't really
involved,'' says Manie Barron, publisher of Amistad Press, an
imprint of HarperCollins that publishes fiction and nonfiction by
blacks. ``Now, a decade later, readers are more discerning.''

   &QR;  Movies and the morgue: Ever since Jodie Foster rejected offers
to play medical examiner Kay Scarpetta, Patricia Cornwell has
resisted making any movie deals. But now the Richmond author has
sold the rights to all 11 Scarpetta novels to Sony Pictures.
Publishers Weekly reports that the $5 million price tag includes a
five-year option on future novels. Cornwell's latest novel, ``The
Last Precinct'' _ which will hit stores in October _ focuses on
Scarpetta's investigation of the 400-year-old violent death of one
of the Jamestown, Va., settlers. In the process, Scarpetta, her
niece Lucy, and detective Pete Marino become the targets of vicious
hate crimes apparently connected to the excavation.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Like, Harry Who? Younger readers may be devouring J.K.
Rowling's Harry Potter novels with a passion, but many teenagers
apparently have no time for literary pursuits. When teenmag.com,
the Web site of Teen Magazine, asked 3,090 teens how many books
they read for fun this summer, 41 percent said none; 30 percent
said fewer than five; 17 percent said between five and 10; and
slightly more than 11 percent said more than 10 books.

 &HT;    Herb by any name still tastes as sweet
 &HT;    By Lee May
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHARLOTTE _ The night was warm, and the mood was mellow. The
three of us, my host Debbie Moore Clark, her pal Christine Lange
and I, were motoring back to Debbie's home after a festive
gathering of the Charlotte Herb Guild, where I had done a little
speechifying.
</P>
<P>
   Somehow, we began talking about how different words are used in
different regions of the country. And how some are passed down in
families, even after passing out of general use. In Debbie's
family, bedspreads were ``counterpanes,'' and coverlets were
``kiverlets'' (many of my Alabama ancestors called bedcovers
``kiver,'' rhyming with river).
</P>
<P>
   Naturally, conversation got around to herbs. And from there it
didn't take long for the three of us language lovers to get to how
the word ``herb'' is pronounced.
</P>
<P>
   Christine and I quickly agreed that not pronouncing the ``h''
was our way, always had been, always would be. That ``herb''
wouldn't be like some other words we could think of, words that
started out one way and got dragged into another pronunciation by
some style whim.
</P>
<P>
   Halley's Comet, for example. Most of my life, I heard it
pronounced to rhyme with ``Bailey's'' (admittedly, my world was far
from worldly). Then I started hearing it rhyme with ``Sally's.''
Everyone I knew used to say ``ha-rass.'' Lately, I hear (especially
among TV news readers) as many accents on the first syllable,
making it sound like somebody's name.
</P>
<P>
   All of us laughed when we noted how the pronunciation of some
words _ ``vase'' and ``tomato'' among them _ makes some people
sound as if they're putting on airs: ``Vahz.'' ``To-mah-toe.''
</P>
<P>
   When conversation got back to herbs, Martha Stewart was not far
behind. She pronounces them ``herbs,'' with an ``h,'' as do the
Brits. But because Martha so inspires ridicule, her pronunciation
seems affected, even if it isn't. As Debbie learned a few years
ago, in some places, even in America, herbs' ``h'' comes naturally.
</P>
<P>
   From 1989 to 1996 Debbie lived in Roanoke, Va., where friends
from the Herb Society of Southwestern Virginia introduced her to
the ``pristinely beautiful'' Buffalo Springs Herb Farm, near
Lexington. After a year of frequent visits to the farm, immersing
herself in the study of herb culture, harvesting and use, Debbie
noticed that ``most, if not all, the professional herb growers and
speakers voiced the `h' when pronouncing the word `herb.' I had
always said `erb,' the American version of the British `herb.'''
</P>
<P>
   As the saying goes, when in Roanoke. ... ``I decided to change
my pronunciation to `herb,' voicing the long-silent `h.' Once
determined, it did not take me long to feel comfortable with the
change.''
</P>
<P>
   Then, in 1996, she and her husband, Mack, moved to Charlotte,
where they built their home (Maison Aurore), moving in last year.
Here, Debbie's diligently acquired knowledge has been loosed in a
space that grows herbs galore, including basil (her pesto is
legendary) so big and healthy that it looks illegal, along with
mountains of one of my favorites, rosemary. It always invites
touches and sniffs when planted along pathways.
</P>
<P>
   After arriving in the Queen City, Debbie of course reached out
to other herb people, carrying with her that British-sounding `h.'
``Without fail,'' she said, ``my pronunciation was politely
corrected: `Don't you mean ``erb?'''''
</P>
<P>
   Once, during her ultimately successful search for kindred herb
souls, she telephoned the Chamber of Commerce, where the
receptionist asked, ``Herb who?''
</P>
<P>
   So what does Debbie do when the word comes up these days?
</P>
<P>
   Skillfully wheeling through traffic, she answered without
'esitation: ``Now, I say it both ways.''
</P>
<P>
   Why not? In language (especially English) as in gardening, if
you're looking for blind consistency, fuggiddabouddit.

BOOKS TO HELP KIDS MANAGE MONEY
</HEADLINE>
  (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
 By ALYSON WARD 
 c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Kids tend to be overly conscious or totally clueless when it
comes to money; some want to own the stock market by the time
they're 10, and others don't understand the difference between 50
cents and $50.
</P>
<P>
   So how do you teach your kids about money? Dr. Spock never
covered the Dow, but an entire subcategory of parenting books
offers advice about kids and finances. We've rounded up some of the
most promising books we've found. Most are written by financial
experts, and they're full of advice about allowances and
investments and teaching children the value of a dollar.
</P>
<P>
   _
</P>
<P>
   1. ``Kids and Money: Giving Them the Savvy to Succeed
Financially'' by Jayne A. Pearl (Bloomberg Press, $12.95).
</P>
<P>
   This book covers just about everything: allowances and first
investments, financial aid for college and profitable first jobs.
Jayne A. Pearl, a former business reporter and editor, offers
advice and personal stories from parents, kids and financial
experts, which makes ``Kids and Money'' informative and readable.
</P>
<P>
   _
</P>
<P>
   2. ``Kids and Money: A Hands-On Parent's Guide to Teach Children
About Money Management and Business Basics'' by Michael J. Searls
(Summit Financial Products, $9.95).
</P>
<P>
   Yes, another book called ``Kids and Money'' _ but this one's
different. This book teaches parents how they can encourage wise
spending, saving and investing; the emphasis is on good money
management all the way through adulthood. Michael J. Searls, a
former Wall Street adviser, also offers ideas for kids with an
entrepreneurial streak.
</P>
<P>
   _
</P>
<P>
   3. ``Kiplinger's Dollars &AMP; Sense for Kids'' by Janet Bodnar
(Kiplinger Books, $17.95).
</P>
<P>
   Janet Bodnar (who writes a nationally syndicated column as ``Dr.
Tightwad'') is a senior editor at ``Kiplinger's Personal Finance
Magazine'' _ and she has three children. In this book for parents,
Bodnar reminds parents that they are the ones with the authority
and responsibility to teach their kids the value of money. Excerpts
from her syndicated question-and-answer column are interspersed
with advice on educating kids and handling sticky financial
situations.
</P>
<P>
   _
</P>
<P>
   4. ``Kids' Allowances: How Much, How Often &AMP; How Come'' by David
McCurrach (Kids' Money Press, $8.95).
</P>
<P>
   Financial adviser David McCurrach helps readers determine how
much allowance to give kids _ what amount will teach them how to
manage money but won't be more than they need. One chapter provides
tips from money experts; you can also read how other parents
developed their allowance system and learn the average amount that
thousands of parents give their children. A separate workbook lets
you sit down with your child and figure out the right amount
together.
</P>
<P>
   _
</P>
<P>
   5. ``Growing Money: A Complete Investing Guide for Kids'' by
Gail Karlitz and Debbie Honig (Price Stern Sloan Pub., $6.99).
</P>
<P>
   This is a book for parents and kids (ages 9-12) to read
together; it teaches kids (and confused adults) the basics of the
stock market. After spilling all the facts, ``Growing Money'' lets
kids practice what they've learned: Readers get a fund of imaginary
dollars, and the book takes them through the process of investing
it wisely. They learn how to read stock pages and can use a chart
to track their earnings and losses. By the end, they'll understand
the process and the risks of investing real money.

&HT;     CALIFORNIANS DEFIANT ON USE OF MEDICAL MARIJUANA 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By JIM HERRON ZAMORA and ULYSSES TORASSA  
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Despite the U.S. Supreme Court's ruling barring
distribution of marijuana for medicinal uses to Californians whose
doctors prescribe it, cannabis supporters are optimistic they will
win the fight in the long run.
</P>
<P>
   Supporters, including San Francisco District Attorney Terence
Hallinan, said Tuesday that they are not quite willing to give up
the court battle.
</P>
<P>
   But they concede that the quest to legalize marijuana as a
medicine will most likely be resolved in Congress and the White
House rather than in the courts.
</P>
<P>
   ``The federal classification of marijuana as a drug with no
medical benefit is a case where the federal law is wrong,''
Hallinan said. ``We hoped the courts would agree with the doctors
on this.''
</P>
<P>
   The Supreme Court's 7-1 ruling, in response to an emergency
request from the Clinton administration, postponed the effect of a
federal court ruling that would have allowed the Oakland Cannabis
Buyers' Cooperative to distribute marijuana for medicinal use.
</P>
<P>
   Although it is the first time the Supreme Court has weighed in
on the issue, it does not mean the justices have made their final
decision on the issue.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday's brief order from the high court suspends a lower court
ruling until the issue can be appealed to the 9th U.S. Circuit
Court of Appeals in San Francisco. No date has been set for the
next round of appeals.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is just a small bump in the road,'' said Robert Raich,
the lawyer for the marijuana club. ``The important decisions in
this case will be made later.''
</P>
<P>
   Hallinan and other supporters hope the next president and
Congress will revise federal laws to allow marijuana to be used for
medicinal purposes.
</P>
<P>
   ``Whether or not we prevail in court, we have always prevailed
in the court of public opinion,'' said Jeff Jones, the Oakland
cooperative's director.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday's order was the latest development in a four-year
conflict between federal narcotics laws and Proposition 215, the
California ballot initiative that voters approved in 1996
legalizing the use of marijuana for medicinal uses.
</P>
<P>
   So far seven other states _ Alaska, Arizona, Hawaii, Maine,
Nevada, Oregon and Washington _ have passed initiatives similar the
one in California.
</P>

   Hammering nails is such an elementary task that it would seem
that no explanation is needed. Yet professional carpenters and shop
instructors say that many do-it-yourselfers don't know how to drive
nails efficiently. The most common mistake is in holding the hammer
too close to the head.
</P>
<P>
   If you only use a hammer for an occasional task, like hanging a
picture, then you can use almost any method to get the job done,
provided you don't damage the work or hurt yourself. But if an
involved construction project requires driving a lot of nails, then
proper technique is essential to avoid arm fatigue and mishaps.
</P>
<P>
   Good nailing technique starts by choosing the right hammer. The
claw hammer is the traditional tool because it can be used to pull
nails as well as drive them. Until recently, most claw hammers came
with wooden handles. A wooden handle has a natural resiliency that
absorbs the shock generated when the hammer strikes the nail.
</P>
<P>
   The main drawback to the wooden handle is that it will split or
crack when subjected to a lot of nail pulling. In an effort to
produce a more durable handle, tool manufacturers introduced
steel-shank hammers. These stand up to strenuous nail pulling, but
they have little spring and they can cause arm fatigue. Tubular
steel and fiberglass handles are an attempt to combine the best of
both materials.
</P>
<P>
   The handle is only part of the hammer; it is also important to
consider the working end of the hammer, the head. Hammerheads are
available in weights ranging from 16 to 22 ounces. (Some specialty
dealers offer hammers in lighter weights for model makers.)
Generally, the 16-ounce head is better for light construction,
finishing and repair work. Choose a hammer with the heavier
22-ounce head for framing work.
</P>
<P>
   The face of the hammer may be either smooth or textured. A
smooth face is designed for finish work. If the hammer slips from
the nail, the wood will be dented but not scratched. A hammer with
a smooth face, however, will often slip off the nail head if the
carpenter works too fast.
</P>
<P>
   Textured faces are designed to grip a nail head even if the
hammer doesn't land squarely. There are two types: One is milled
(also called a serrated or waffle face). It has a series of
parallel grooves cut across the hammer face in a checkerboard
pattern. Milled-face hammers are good for driving galvanized nails
because the rough face pattern will not rub the galvanized coating
off the nails. The main disadvantage to a milled-faced hammer is
that it can leave an ugly hammer track if it strikes the wood.
</P>
<P>
   The second type of textured face is the sandpaper face, which
has more grip than a smooth face but won't scar a wood surface.
</P>
<P>
   Nailing technique consists of tapping the nail lightly to give
it a good start in the wood, then swinging the hammer properly to
drive the nail home with the least amount of effort. For a large
nail, grip the shaft of the nail between the thumb and index finger
using the other three fingers to brace the hand. For smaller nails,
like roofing nails or brads, it is easier to keep the hand flat,
palm up, and grip the nail between the first two fingers. With this
approach, the knuckles of the holding hand are out of the way and
you have a clear view of the nail.
</P>
<P>
   When starting the nail, hold the hammer toward the middle of the
handle for greater control. Give the nail a few light taps to seat
it into the wood, then remove the nail-holding hand. Slide the hand
on the hammer toward the end of the handle. This position will give
you greater driving force.
</P>
<P>
   Your hammer grip should be firm. If the handle is slippery and
difficult to hold, try roughening it with coarse-grit sandpaper.
Some carpenters rub their hammers with pine tar (available at
sporting good stores for baseball bats), but too much can make the
handle sticky.
</P>
<P>
   There may be times when you have to start a nail in a
hard-to-reach spot. For example, if you are working from a ladder,
you have to hold the ladder rung with one hand while starting the
nail with the other. You can accomplish this with a special
nail-hammer grip. Wrap the fingers around the hammerhead and hold
the nail so the head rests against the hammer cheek. Drive the nail
into the wood by punching the hammerhead with the heel of the hand.
</P>
<P>
   Hammering a nail seems relatively simple, but it can be
dangerous. A glancing hammer blow can cause nails to become
projectiles. Always wear eye protection. Never hold nails in your
mouth; the coating on some nails, galvanized or resin compounds,
could cause a toxic reaction.

MANY SITES ARE TROLLING FOR VOTERS 
</HEADLINE>
   (Circuits)  
 By REBECCA FAIRLEY RANEY    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   This election year, if you visit a Web site created by any group
with political interests, you will probably have a chance to
register to vote as well.
</P>
<P>
   Links to voter registration sites are appearing on the Web sites
of candidates, political parties, labor unions, groups for
teen-agers and environmental advocates, and even on a site for a
Jeep owners' club.
</P>
<P>
   But the registration process is not as simple as clicking on
Send. Because signatures are required on voter registration cards,
online systems often merely start a process that must be completed
by mail.
</P>
<P>
   The Federal Election Commission offers a postcard form at
www.fec.gov/votregis/vr.htm that can be printed, filled out, signed
and mailed. Printed on ordinary paper, the form is accepted by
about half the states. But most other states require an additional
step: they mail a registration card to the individual to sign and
return.
</P>
<P>
   Still other sites, like BeAVoter.org and Election.com, let
prospective voters type information into electronic forms. The
information is then transferred to registration cards and mailed to
the registrants for signatures.
</P>
<P>
   The next step, allowing people to register directly online using
digital signatures, does not seem likely in the near future. The
concept has met opposition in California, where a report issued
earlier this year by the secretary of state's office said that
direct online registration would be ``an invitation to automated,
large-scale vote fraud.''
</P>
<P>
   Privacy experts have warned that plugging information into an
online form could lead to problems. Even though the commercial and
nonprofit voter registration sites have policies that say the
groups do not sell personal data, bankruptcy proceedings and
mergers can nullify those policies.
</P>
<P>
   Kim Alexander, president of the California Voter Foundation, a
nonprofit group, said she was most concerned that commercial
entities would link data about political leanings with consumer
data.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's really important that voters be very conscientious about
what kinds of sites they use to facilitate their voter
registration,'' Alexander said. ``If there's more and more abuse of
data on the Internet through voter registration, it may lead people
to not want to register to vote at all.''
</P>
<P>
   The election commission has offered its form for printing online
for more than two years. The form is downloaded about 15,000 times
per month, said Brian Hancock, an elections research specialist for
the commission. The agency does not track how many people have
registered using the system.
</P>
<P>
   By contrast, the number of registration forms filed at motor
vehicle offices around the nation under so-called motor voter laws
has been far greater, totaling more than 15 million in 1997 and
1998.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the greater number of registered voters since the
national form became available, the turnout among voters has
dropped substantially. The number of registered voters increased by
more than 11 million people from 1992 to 1996, but the percentage
of people voting dropped to 49 percent in 1996 from 55 percent in
1992. Offering registration forms online is not likely to change
that trend, experts said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think it's going to be a revolution,'' said Curtis
Gans, director of the nonprofit Committee for the Study of the
American Electorate. Technology, Gans said, would not correct the
problems created by poor civic education and negative campaigning.
</P>
<P>
   ``When we correct some of those things,'' he said, ``then
perhaps we can rebuild the motivation to vote.''

ECONOMIC SCENE: FOR MANY AMERICANS, INCOME HAS ERODED DESPITE
PROSPERITY 
</HEADLINE>
   By JEFF MADRICK   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Make no mistake about how good the last five years have been to
Americans. The usually cautious economists at the Economic Policy
Institute point out in their new issue of The State of Working
America that wages went up strongly across the board since 1996,
even for low-income workers. In the meantime, low levels of
unemployment meant that many who dropped out of the labor force
were back at work, and jobs in general were more stable. Small
wonder that Americans are confident again.
</P>
<P>
   But what is too often ignored is that this remarkable
performance has not yet compensated for the persistent erosion of
the income of male workers since the early 1970s. And this goes a
long way toward explaining why Al Gore's message at the Democratic
convention to help working families seems to have caught on. Women
have had to fill the breach, with a far higher proportion of them
now working. But although their wages have risen substantially on
average, they remain roughly 20 percent below what men earn.
</P>
<P>
   Few of the instant television analysts at the convention grasped
the point. ``Contentment'' is the tenor of the times, one pundit
asserted, claiming that Gore was misreading the electorate. The
going line was this: Maybe we should worry about the poor and those
without health insurance, but should we really be concerned with
most of working America?
</P>
<P>
   A few facts will help. The Census Bureau provides a useful
measure of income by sex that includes not just wages and salaries
for all workers, which are typically cited by analysts, but also
sources of income like rent and interest as well as government
transfers like Social Security benefits and unemployment insurance.
The bureau also provides data by age group and for the typical, or
median, worker _ the worker who earns more than half of all workers
and less than the other half.
</P>
<P>
   I have also had the data discounted for the latest estimates of
inflation, which adjust incomes upward for new improvements in the
quality and variety of products. Thus the following conclusions are
based on a quite generous estimate of income growth.
</P>
<P>
   Despite significant gains recently, however, the median male
worker has fared poorly since the 1970s. In fact, adjusted for
inflation, the median worker in the 25-to-34 age group earned 13
percent less in 1998 (the latest data available) than the median
worker of the same age in 1973.
</P>
<P>
   Median workers in the 35-to-44 age group earned about 9 percent
less in 1998 than their counterparts 25 years earlier. And the
45-to-54 median-income group essentially stagnated since 1973, up
only slightly. By comparison, in the post-World War II period,
median incomes for these age groups rose by 50 to 100 percent over
25 years.
</P>
<P>
   But even if overall incomes fell compared with levels for
equivalent workers in the past, how did men do as they grew more
experienced at work and built up financial and real estate assets
over time? These same data allow us to assess this, and the
findings are sobering.
</P>
<P>
   Beginning in the 1970s and persisting into the 1990s, the
incomes of a majority of men under 35 rose about half as fast as
they did in earlier decades, and the incomes of a majority of men
aged roughly 35 or older essentially stagnated or fell.
</P>
<P>
   To take but one example, the median income of a male aged 35 to
44 in 1988 was $39,331. In 1998, the equivalent man, now 10 years
older, took in $300 less. To match the gains typically made in the
1950s and 1960s, the median income should have been approximately
$51,000 by 1998.
</P>
<P>
   Updating the data through 2000 would improve the performance of
the past 25 years only slightly.
</P>
<P>
   Some economists say such data do not tell the whole story.
Incomes for the top 20 percent of men rose rapidly in the past 25
years, and some assert that because income mobility is greater now,
many in the lower 80 percent occasionally climb into the highest
quintile. But claims of greater income mobility have been
criticized by both conservative and liberal economists.
</P>
<P>
   A more relevant criticism is that even if incomes stagnate,
Americans can buy many more exciting new products at low and
falling prices. Even the poor own VCRs, microwave ovens and Sony
Walkmans. But the costs of products and services that some may view
as even more critical to modern life than a VCR _ housing,
education, medical care, and public transit _ have all risen much
faster than incomes since the early 1970s.
</P>
<P>
   It is an extraordinary social achievement that so many women now
have the opportunity to work. But the inescapable fact is that if
women did not work, most family incomes would not have risen at all
in the 1980s and 1990s. The median annual income of a two-worker
family is now about $60,000. The median family income of a
one-worker family is about $32,000.
</P>
<P>
   The resulting pressures are obvious. A parent now stays at home
full time in fewer than one out of four families, compared with two
out of three in the 1950s. In half of all families, both parents
work, compared with one out of five in the 1950s. Twenty-five
percent of all families are headed by a single parent, typically a
mother.
</P>
<P>
   This is a new reality in America. Despite five years of
prosperity, the poor are still not doing well, and working families
in the broad middle are in need of relief _ both from long work
hours and from the pressures of the rising cost of education,
health care and other requirements for a middle-class life. And the
cost of professional child care has risen much faster than incomes.
</P>
<P>
   Surveys by two sociologists, Jerry Jacobs of the University of
Pennsylvania and Kathleen Gerson of New York University, among
others, show that those who work especially long hours want to work
less. And those who work short hours, usually earning too little,
want to work more.
</P>
<P>
   For a long time, both political parties put the best face on
these grinding facts. Al Gore simply let the cat out of the bag. My
guess is that George W. Bush is beginning to get the message, even
if the instant media pundits are not.

   SOMALIA-POLITICS (Mogadishu, Somalia) _ Somalia finally has a

Wednesday escorted by at least 120 pickup trucks carrying well over

double-barreled anti-aircraft guns. And just to be on the safe

the closest the new president, Abdikassim Salad Hassan, came to
harm was from Somalis a little too eager to show their affection.
At mid-day, he arrived at a downtown soccer stadium, packed with

TWO BEDFORD BLUES FESTS, BUT ONE'S IN DALLAS
</HEADLINE>
  (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
 By DAVE FERMAN 
 c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   FORT WORTH, Texas _ Sit down. Take a deep breath. This gets
complicated.
</P>
<P>
   For five years, the Bedford Blues Festival &AMP; Art Fair brought
artists such as Delbert McClinton, Jimmie Vaughan and Keb' Mo' to a
large field adjacent to Harris Methodist H.E.B. hospital just in
Bedford, a Fort Worth suburs.
</P>
<P>
   This weekend, there is a festival in the same place, but it's
called the City of Bedford Labor Day BluesFest. McClinton, soul
queen Irma Thomas, New Orleans' Funky Meters, Wilson Pickett and
many more will be playing.
</P>
<P>
   The festival ends Sunday, the day before Labor Day.
</P>
<P>
   Wait, there's more.
</P>
<P>
   A blues festival called, once again, the Bedford Blues Festival
&AMP; Art Fair will also go on this Friday, Saturday and Sunday _ in
downtown Dallas. This Bedford blues festival will include sets by
Shemekia Copeland, Coco Montoya and Cowtown's own Robert Ealey, all
at City Hall Plaza.
</P>
<P>
   This festival is being put on by the same company, Main Events
International, that put on the Bedford Blues Festival &AMP; Art Fair
for five years in Bedford.
</P>
<P>
   Got all that? Good. Now the question is: How did this confusing
situation happen? The answer, of course, depends largely on whom
you ask.
</P>
<P>
   Ray Hair, who has booked every Bedford blues festival held ``in
Bedford,'' and Sherri Strayer, the city's special events
coordinator, say that Stephen Millard, MEI's president, has been
sneaky, right down to copyrighting the name Bedford Blues Festival
&AMP; Art Fair and the logo.
</P>
<P>
   Two festivals with ``Bedford'' in the name, both running on the
same days, will only confuse blues fans, they say.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's crazy, isn't it?'' asks Hair. ``Millard doesn't have
Bedford behind his event _ we have the same staging and the same
location. And ours is free. I think he's just hurting himself. He's
attempting to portray his event as the same event it's been for the
past five years, and it's not. It's misleading.''
</P>
<P>
   Millard, naturally, doesn't see it that way.
</P>
<P>
   ``When we started this event, there was nothing going on as far
as blues in the Metroplex,'' he says. ``We put Bedford on the map.
We already had this year's festival on the books and the talent
hired and they decided to do their own festival in Bedford. And
it's not just the music _ it's the party. And we know how to throw
a good party. This is a community celebration.''
</P>
<P>
   What we know for sure is that in January, the city of Bedford
cut its ties to Millard and MEI. The reasons included wanting to
get more local artists and performers and advertisers, according to
Strayer.
</P>
<P>
   ``We weren't moving the festival in the way we wanted it to
go,'' she says. ``And last year there was a $5 admission; we wanted
the festival to be free. There were continuous disagreements, and
we had to make our decision and move forward.''
</P>
<P>
   The final straw, she says, was learning that Millard had
copyrighted the name and logo.
</P>
<P>
   ``The staff felt betrayed,'' she says. ``Obviously this was not
done in a forthright way. That was the final point; and at that
point, we decided we'd part ways and didn't need MEI's services.''
</P>
<P>
   Millard sharply disagrees, saying he registered the name in 1995
as a business under the MEI umbrella and that he copyrighted the
logo only to protect it. It just made good sense, he says.
</P>
<P>
   ``I felt we'd been used,'' he says of his dealings with the
city. ``We brought this event to the city of Bedford. They saw us
struggle with the event for the first three years, and in the
fourth year we made a profit and they said, `Hey, we could do that'
and tried to take it over. We accepted all the responsibility on
this event, and they took us out.''
</P>
<P>
   So the two sides split, and each decided to put together its own
festival. At that point, Hair and MEI's Abby Goldstein worked on
booking the talent for their respective festivals. Hair's lineup _
that is, the one in Bedford _ is a more diverse blend of blues,
soul, funk and (with Joe Ely and Monte Montgomery aboard) Texas
roots music.
</P>
<P>
   Goldstein, who's part of the Bedford festival in Dallas, says
she concentrated more on a ``traditional blues lineup and giving an
opportunity to local and regional people as well as those with a
national reputation.'' Admission to the Dallas-based festival
ranges from $8 to $20, with limited opportunities to get in free.
</P>
<P>
   Hair says that there was only one act that both festivals were
going for: youngster Kenny Wayne Shephard. In the end, neither
festival could book him.
</P>
<P>
   ``Millard is closing his event with people who were openers for
us, such as Shemekia Copeland and Coco Montoya,'' he says. ``They
would still be openers for our show. The talent we have blows his
out of the water, and you can quote me.''
</P>
<P>
   Whatever the case, several local musicians say that having two
blues festivals over the same weekend won't help anybody.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's kind of stupid,'' says Fort Worth-based guitarist
Sumter Bruton. ``The one in Dallas is a little bluesier, but the
Bedford one has bigger names. The one in Dallas is the way the one
in Bedford was five years ago. A lot of people are confused. It's
like a couple kids saying, `I'll show you.' ... I'm not going to
drive to Dallas, but people there might not drive to Bedford,
either.''
</P>
<P>
   Guitarist David Millsap, who has toured with McClinton, compares
the situation to ``takin' the football and going home _ it's kinda
childish.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a no-win situation,'' says Millsap, who will be
performing in Bedford on the second stage. ``A lot of things don't
add up to me. A lot of people will show up in Bedford not ever
knowing the difference. If anybody gets hurt, it's going to be the
people who moved to Dallas _ people are just used to the routine
and the place in Bedford. The Bedford blues festival is in
Bedford.''
</P>
<P>
   Not necessarily, Millard says. He has plans to take the Bedford
festival on the road to other Texas cities next summer.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bedford's just a name,'' he says. ``You could do the New
Orleans jazz festival outside New Orleans. We could have the
Bedford Blues Festival of San Antonio or something like that. We
were even approached once to have the New Bedford Blues Festival in
a New England town called New Bedford. Bedford rolls nicely off the
tongue and always has.''
</P>
<P>
   Finally, Millard and the folks in Bedford say they are happy
with the festival they'll be presenting this coming weekend.
</P>
<P>
   Millard says he loves the new site and predicts that the Dallas
Bedford will be a big ol' Texas blues party.
</P>
<P>
   Strayer says the ``Bedford'' Bedford festival is once again free
and includes more artists (15 to 20, as opposed to five last year)
and the contributions of local businesses and advertisers.
</P>
<P>
   In the end, the fans will decide where to get their blues.

A DESIGN FOR A LITTLE FUN: EASY TO PLAY, AND TO FORGET 
</HEADLINE>

   Kiss Psycho Circus: The Nightmare Child; published by Gathering

for players 17 and older.

   Dracula Resurrection; published by Dreamcatcher Interactive and
developed by Index Multimedia; for Windows 95, 98 and NT (Macintosh
version will be available sometime this fall); $19.95; for players
17 and older.
</P>
<P>
   Some games are so original or technically innovative or visually
powerful that the game world is never quite the same. Games like
Doom, Myst and Sim City are not only fondly remembered but are
still played. But there are other entertaining games that are
forgotten almost as soon as they are played. If there are B movies,
then these are B games.
</P>
<P>
   Two such games are Kiss Psycho Circus: The Nightmare Child, an
action game based on the Kiss Psycho Circus comic books, which are
inspired by the rock band Kiss, and Dracula Resurrection, an
adventure game.
</P>
<P>
   Even though Nightmare Child combines three of the things that
have been blamed for the degeneration of America's youth, it is
unlikely to have parents up in arms. You don't shoot anything human
in this game. Your foes are mutant circus freaks: Clowns with
spidery metallic legs, strongmen with weights grafted to their
arms, human balloons who spit poisonous gas. While the game is
quite violent, it seems harmless when compared with more sadistic
fare, like Soldier of Fortune or Kingpin.
</P>
<P>
   The framework is silly but functional. The members of Kiss
arrive without makeup to play a concert but instead find themselves
confronted by a gypsy fortuneteller who demands that they save the
world from a ``nightmare child'' that is approaching consciousness.
The setup is reminiscent of an episode of ``The Monkees'' or
``Scooby-Doo,'' only here each band member is fitted out with
artillery and must seek out supernatural armor that will both give
him extraordinary powers and make him look just like his stage
persona in Kiss.
</P>
<P>
   The most interesting element of Nightmare Child is its circus
motif. There is a perverse, comic-book feel to enemies like an evil
clown throwing deadly juggling clubs or a zombie fat lady throwing
globs of toxic cellulite. If the rest of the game had shown as much
originality, Nightmare Child could have truly been memorable.
</P>
<P>
   But coming on the heels of a string of games like Half-Life and
Deus Ex, which have expanded the whole concept of what a good
action game should be, Nightmare Child's old-fashioned plotless
killfest seems hollow, like mayhem without context, violence
without purpose. Nightmare Child is a throwback to a time when
killing was enough.
</P>
<P>
   In spite of the Kiss tie-in, Nightmare Child has little rock
flavor. While you might occasionally come across a jukebox playing
a Kiss song, the score is a fairly standard one, without screaming
guitars and hoarse vocals. The game might have been more
interesting if it had been as over the top as the band.
</P>
<P>
   Nightmare Child can be a lot of fun at times, and some
confrontations are very exciting. But as you have to blast away at
yet another monster-spawning machine spitting out yet another horde
of headless bugs, it becomes increasingly hard to stay interested.
Nightmare Child's lack of fresh ideas makes it exciting for only
half of the 40 or so hours it takes to play it.
</P>
<P>
   You're less likely to feel that Dracula Resurrection has worn
out its welcome. It can be finished by any experienced gamer in 10
hours or so, hardly enough time to get bored. Like Nightmare Child,
Resurrection is good-looking and unoriginal. The puzzles are
unexceptional in design and ingenuity and are truly notable only
for their remarkable lack of challenge.
</P>
<P>
   But like Nightmare Child, Resurrection has a certain B-game
charm. Much of the game feels like one of those old Dracula movies
with Christopher Lee. It's all there: Fearful villagers, sinister
demons, a damsel in distress. Every time you solve a puzzle, the
game moves forward with a brief animated scene. It's as if a
projectionist kept stopping the movie to ask you simple riddles,
then showed you a little more once you've answered.
</P>
<P>
   The scenes are quite enjoyable, whether they show a frightened
innkeeper warning you of danger while you study the veins in her
nose or a trio of half-naked female vampires who threaten you while
doing turns and cartwheels that suggest they're planning to take
their act to Las Vegas.
</P>
<P>
   Resurrection has almost every puzzle-design flaw common to the
adventure game, yet it never mires the player in an insoluble
muddle. Some puzzles are provided with insufficient clues and one
must use trial and error, but the choices are limited enough that a
trial-and-error approach can be done quickly. Sometimes an
important item is barely visible, but you will find everything
eventually because the game is compartmentalized into small
discrete spaces that limit the area you have to search.
</P>
<P>
   Resurrection may not have any puzzles that will excite you, but
it is also free of puzzles that will send you into a blind rage. If
you've never played an adventure game, Resurrection might be a good
place to start. If you can't get through this one, there's not much
point in going out and buying a difficult adventure game like Grim
Fandango.
</P>
<P>
   At times a B movie can be more fun than a Hollywood epic. One
doesn't always want to be challenged, to be forced to think or
confront something new and unexpected. The same is true of games,
where originality can be both exhilarating and exhausting.
Nightmare Child and Resurrection are games designed to give you a
little fun without disturbing the status quo, and they are
successful in doing that. They are as simple to play as they are
easy to forget.

THE IMMIGRANT EXPERIENCE ON CD-ROM 
</HEADLINE>
   (Circuits)  
 By DAVID M. OSHINSKY    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Most Americans view the immigrant experience through the bold
strokes of struggle and assimilation. They barely notice the
underside of immigration _ the rules for inspecting, admitting and
excluding newcomers to American shores. For much of American
history, this process was handled by state and local authorities.
But that changed in the 1890s, when Congress, worried by a flood of
immigrants from central and southern Europe, gave the federal
government complete jurisdiction.
</P>
<P>
   Laws were passed excluding immigrants with a criminal past, a
mental deficiency, or a communicable disease. The Bureau of
Immigration was created, along with 24 federal inspection stations,
to process the new arrivals and weed out those deemed medically
suspect, politically subversive, or unlikely to find a job.
</P>
<P>
   For the immigrants who came through New York harbor in the late
19th and early 20th centuries, the Statue of Liberty no doubt
dazzled their senses, but Ellis Island determined their fate.
Opened on Jan. 1, 1892, Ellis Island's vast inspection center
served as the entry point for more than 10 million men, women and
children, mostly European Catholics and Jews. In the busiest years,
between 1898 and 1915, its overburdened staff processed 5,000
people a day with cold, stunning efficiency.
</P>
<P>
   The CD-ROM ``The Ellis Island Experience'' begins slowly. Its
opening section, ``The Old World,'' is a collection of essays about
the conditions in 19th century Europe _ industrialization,
political upheaval, religious persecution _ that led millions to
flee the continent.
</P>
<P>
   Left largely unexplored is how these people chose America, and
what they hoped to find. Why, for example, did some immigrant
groups see the United States as their final destination while
others traveled back and forth between the continents, often dozens
of times. And why did millions of immigrants bypass our shores
entirely to settle in countries like Australia, Canada, Argentina
and Brazil?
</P>
<P>
   More surprising is the failure of ``The Ellis Island
Experience'' to emphasize the changing dynamic of immigration. In
the 1890s, Americans grew uneasy about the enormous flow of
immigrants from places like Greece, Italy, Russia, Poland and
Hungary. Without new safeguards, they believed, these immigrants
would pollute the nation with a stream of alien blood. Ellis Island
was a logical response.
</P>
<P>
   The key sections of this CD-ROM _ ``The Journey'' and ``The
Golden Door'' _ are very well done. Combining videos, photographs,
primary documents and crisp commentary, they follow the immigrant
path from the tiny villages of Europe to the controlled chaos of
Ellis Island. Viewers should have no trouble navigating along.
There is an adequate search function to retrieve large themes and
topics, a zoom lens to enlarge images, and simple commands to store
and print documents.
</P>
<P>
   With a click of the mouse, we are transported to the seaports of
Bremen or Liverpool, where giant shipping lines like Cunard, White
Star and Hamburg-Amerika herd waiting immigrants into dockside
hotels to be examined, fumigated and then quarantined for the trip
to New York.
</P>
<P>
   For a $12 ticket _ often prepaid by relatives in the United
States _ the immigrant received third-class passage or steerage on
a deck crammed with hundreds of other bodies, enduring a week or
more of rolling seas without a bath or a change of clothes. The
great majority of people who went down with the Titanic were
immigrants trapped in the bowels of the doomed ship.
</P>
<P>
   Entering New York harbor, the immigrants were taken to Ellis
Island on a giant barge. We watch as medical officers single out
those with a heavy cough or a wild look in their eye, and then mark
their lapels with blue chalk, indicating a need for further review.
We enter an interrogation room to see an Italian fisherman being
asked about his employment prospects, and look in on an exclusion
hearing where a Russian Jew is being questioned about his political
beliefs. By selecting from a short menu of questions, we can direct
the actors in these video dramas to give us the information we
require to judge the cases for ourselves.
</P>
<P>
   Ellis Island could be a frightening experience for immigrants,
but it also served them well. There were showers and hot food for
everyone, and the hospitals provided excellent medical care. Most
immigrants were processed quickly, in a matter of hours. Fewer than
10 percent faced additional tests or hearings; and only 2 percent
were denied entry to the United States. Government policy at Ellis
Island was to admit, if at all possible.
</P>
<P>
   The center went quickly downhill in the 1920s. The Bolshevik
Revolution, the Red Scare of 1919, disillusionment with America's
participation in World War I _ all raised anti-immigrant feelings
at home. Congress passed the National Origins Act in 1924, which
used a quota system to slash immigration from central and southern
Europe. The Great Depression of the 1930s further slowed this
process, and, when Ellis Island closed for good in 1954, the United
States contained the smallest percentage of foreign-born residents
in its history.
</P>
<P>
   But times have again changed. New immigrants are pouring into
the nation, rekindling old fears. Viewing ``The Ellis Island
Experience,'' one is struck by the battles we keep refighting, the
lessons we repeatedly forget. In the balance swings the golden door
to freedom, its direction uncertain, its future unknown.

AIMING FOR COOL WHIP
</HEADLINE>
  After being slapped with undesirable MPAA rating, film's creator
struggles to maintain movie's flavor 
(For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By SANDRA BARRERA 
c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &QL; 
There's a fine line between raunchy and just plain crude, and
``Whipped'' walks it.
</P>
<P>
   But it took a lot of dialogue tweaking on the part of the
independent filmmaker to get it there.
</P>
<P>
   ``Whipped,'' which opens today and stars Amanda Peet of the WB
comedy series ``Jack &AMP; Jill,'' was initially flagged with an NC-17
rating when it was sent to the Motion Picture Association of
America. According to a Washington, D.C., spokesman, the ratings
board is made up of a dozen or so parents who based their decision
on the film's scathing script.
</P>
<P>
   The film follows three best friends, played by Brian Van Holt,
Jonathan Abrahams and Zorie Barber, around New York City hot on the
trail of a quick roll in the sheets with unsuspecting single women.
Then, one by one, the guys meet Mia (Peet), and their whole
perspective changes.
</P>
<P>
   Her icy baby blues and quick wit start the hearts of these men
pounding like no other woman before. What they don't know is that
Mia's got a little surprise cooked up for them in the end.
</P>
<P>
   While ``Whipped'' shows no nudity, it lays on the sex talk
thicker than ``Swingers'' did the lounge-lizard jargon.
</P>
<P>
   ``'Swingers' was definitely an influence,'' says first-time
filmmaker Peter M. Cohen. ``I wanted to write a movie about the way
guys in New York are, you know? The New York scene is totally
different from the L.A. scene. We have a lot of our own catch
phrases.''
</P>
<P>
   Of course, the vast majority of examples that come to mind are
too graphic to mention here. The only PG-13 exception was used by
Judah Domke, the actor who plays the dorky married outcast of the
group.
</P>
<P>
   Domke's character Eric is taking pity on himself for being the
guy whose job it was to always have sex with the ugly girls in the
groups they hit on.
</P>
<P>
   He calls it ``jumping the grenade'' before confessing, ``I
married the grenade.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We would try to come up with things that were somewhat new,''
says Cohen. ``I mean, we definitely have terms in there that have
been around for a long time.''
</P>
<P>
   Words to describe oral sex, female genitalia and the bedroom
litter the script _ no thanks to the cast who embellished the
dialogue with their own colorful catch phrases.
</P>
<P>
   Even Peet got into the act by rewriting her surprise scene at
the end.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it would have been hard for a guy to come up with
stuff that castrating,'' she says. ``It was harsh. Totally,
unadulteratedly sexist.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Whipped'' doesn't shy away from sex, not even for a second.
</P>
<P>
   That created a problem for Cohen when he was forced into
cleaning up his movie for a nicer MPAA rating.
</P>
<P>
   ``They don't tell you what to take out,'' he says. ``You have to
just keep on resubmitting, and I think I resubmitted about eight
times.''
</P>
<P>
   Cohen cut out a ton of profanity, catch phrases and kicker jokes
that pushed the dialogue to the next level. He magnified scenes
that went beyond suggesting a sex act to leave more to the
imagination.
</P>
<P>
   ``They didn't ask me to remove these things, but these are the
things that got it down to an R,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   Luckily for him.
</P>
<P>
   ``Whipped'' could not have opened on 1,500 screens today had it
kept its NC-17 rating, making it crucial that Cohen chip away at
his film.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the kiss of death when you get an NC-17 rating,'' says
Art Rockwell, a box office analyst at Rockwell Capital Management,
who explains that theaters are less willing to play a film with a
spicy rating as a matter of policy. ``It really does eliminate a
big chunk of the audience.
</P>
<P>
   ``Realistically, you're looking at less than 1,000 theaters
willing to feature your film,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   There are exceptions where a spicy rating could help.
</P>
<P>
   ``But that's more of what I would call art-house fare,''
Rockwell says. ``Anything that is designed for a general audience,
which presumably most pictures are, you're looking to get as much
business as possible and not to restrict your potential.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Whipped'' is not an art-house film despite its low-budget
production, rumored at less than $200,000 for its 18 days of
shooting two years ago.
</P>
<P>
   The film was made before Peet's acting career really started to
take off, although she had done ``One Fine Day'' and ``She's the
One.''
</P>
<P>
   Movies like ``The Whole Nine Yards'' and ``Simply Irresistible''
came later. So did her show ``Jack &AMP; Jill.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Amanda made this experience for me,'' says Cohen of his film's
star. ``She's not only a great actress, but she's a great person.
Very smart. And I think that's important with actresses.''
</P>
<P>
   Ironically, Peet, whose next role is as a woman who gets
kidnapped by her boyfriend's buddies in the comedy ``Saving
Silverman,'' expressed similar sentiments for Cohen.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was very smart,'' she says. ``He knew that with the nature
of this film _ the way it was relying a lot on dialogue _ he could
let us riff sometimes.''
</P>
<P>
   In fact, the actors went to town improvising.
</P>
<P>
   It's no wonder Peet was a bit miffed by the MPAA rating, which
in order to be upheld meant some of the film's content had to be
censored.
</P>
<P>
   ``It seems to me that the point of the whole movie is that
they're all talk,'' she says. ``They're laughable. So it's not like
the movie is glorifying that kind of moonlighting or that kind of
cruel bragging. And it seems to me they have no ability to
recognize the tone of the movie.''
</P>
<P>
   Peet wasn't alone in her opposition to the forced edits.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was not like there was a sex scene in there or a death
scene or a rape scene or anything like that,'' says Abrahams, who
played the habitual masturbator Jonathan.
</P>
<P>
   Adds Van Holt, the actor who played the stud Brad, ``The MPAA
were being a little harsh on us because we're new filmmakers.''
</P>
<P>
   While the MPAA doesn't specify the reason it gives a film a
certain rating, its director of public affairs, Phuong Yokitis,
says it has nothing to do with the experience level of a filmmaker.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no check-off list where, if they say so many things or
depict a scene a certain way, that would get it this rating,'' she
says. ``It's subjective. And it's dependent on how the context is
used.''
</P>
<P>
   Cohen, who is completing work on a script for Robert Zemekis'
Image Works company, admits that having to remove dialogue from his
film was upsetting.
</P>
<P>
   The bright side is that it ended up broadening its appeal.
</P>
<P>
   ``Definitely it still has an edge,'' Cohen says. ``But it used
to have a bigger edge.'' &QL;

BEATING AUDIENCE WITH VULGARITY
</HEADLINE>
  (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
(Eds: Fact box below) 
Our rating: 1 star 
By BOB STRAUSS 
c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The sleazoid summer of '00 ends, appropriately, with the nadir
of foulmouthed shock movies. ``Whipped's'' only apparent ambition
is to discover just how degradable the young male mindset can be.
Pretty depraved, according to this.
</P>
<P>
   It fancies itself a comedy.
</P>
<P>
   The movie is about what the kids these days may or may not call
``scamming.'' (Since little about the characters' behavior is
recognizably human, let alone believable, every aspect of the
picture is called into question.) That's, basically, trying to
achieve as much commitment-free sex as possible by any means
necessary. It's been done before, and for countless generations, I
might add. But it's never been approached with quite the disgusting
avidity of ``Whipped's'' dog-pound quartet.
</P>
<P>
   The four friends meet every Sunday morning at a Manhattan diner
to discuss _ in heartless, excruciating detail _ their weekend's
erotic escapades. Handsome stockbroker Brad (Brian Van Holt)
usually lies his way into women's graces. Faux sensitive writer
manque Zeke (Zorie Barber) is not above picking up larcenous combos
for menages-a-trois; he figures losing a TV set in the morning is a
small price to pay for the experience. Loser-ish Jonathan (Jonathan
Abrahams) tends to choke in the seduction stretch and usually goes
home alone. And their pathetic married bud Eric (Judah Domke)
religiously shows up to live vicariously through the others'
recounted adventures.
</P>
<P>
   Crudely grotesque as their witless sex patter is, things take an
even more dire turn when all three bachelors show up one morning in
love. Brad has met a girl who's genuinely interested in securities
analysis. Zeke's new lady is, well, literate. Jonathan's
acquaintance shares his passion for a certain solitary pursuit and
isn't embarrassed to discuss its joys with him.
</P>
<P>
   Trouble is, the guys soon discover that they've all fallen for
the same girl. Mia is inarguably a dream come true, sweet and
intelligent and certainly accommodating. Her only weensy little
flaw is that she can't make up her mind, and soon the pals are at
each other's throats over who'll become her main man.
</P>
<P>
   The movie's one virtue is the casting of Amanda Peet as Mia. The
wily and evidently fearless actress is also absolutely captivating,
much like she was earlier this year when she stole the show as
``The Whole Nine Yards' '' eager hit woman, but this time in a
generally reactive role. It isn't until the see-it-from-a-mile-away
``surprise'' ending that Peet takes charge of the film's definition
of humor. Considering how lame the boys' antics are leading up to
then _ they drop things in toilets, they get caught in compromising
positions wearing tiger-striped skivvies, etc. _ Peet probably
comes off as well as she does by wisely playing so much of it
straight.
</P>
<P>
   ``Whipped'' is the feature writing, directing and producing
debut of an advertising person named Peter M. Cohen. It has all the
insight into the battle of the sexes of a tire commercial, with
noticeably less wit and taste than most. In fact, it's not off-base
to call ``Whipped'' the Firestone recall of gross-out comedies. &QL;

   The new romantic comedy ``Smiling Fish and Goat on Fire'' is a
low-key, low-budget charmer in the tradition of ``The Brothers
McMullen,'' the kind of movie whose small pleasures and disarming
sincerity will make you forget its rough edges and revel instead in
its feel-good story.
</P>
<P>
   Brothers Derick and Steven Martini wrote ``Smiling Fish'' and
star as the title characters, who aren't, as one might expect,
American Indians. Smiling Fish is Tony (Steven Martini), a
struggling actor, and Goat on Fire is Chris (Derick Martini), a
dependable accountant. We learn in the opening minutes that the
brothers' half-American Indian grandmother gave them their
nicknames when they were children, reflecting Chris' seriousness
and Tony's roguish charm.
</P>
<P>
   The brothers are living in a ramshackle North Hollywood home,
inherited after their parents' death in a car crash. And they're
more or less still living up to their nicknames. Tony spends more
time going through callow women than going on auditions, while
Chris is stuck in a dead-end relationship with a woman who cries
every time they make love.
</P>
<P>
   But as the film casually unfolds, it's clear the boys are about
to be thrown a curve. Tony meets Kathy (Christa Miller from ``The
Drew Carey Show''), a down-to-earth postal carrier, first at his
mailbox and later at an audition, where Kathy has driven her
aspiring actress daughter, Natalie (Nicola Ray). Tony and Natalie
are reading for the same movie, a neat coincidence, and a romance
blooms between the adults.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, button-down Chris has met Anna (Rosemarie Addeo), an
Italian bombshell animal wrangler. They, too, begin a romance,
thanks in large part to the efforts of Clive (veteran character
actor and jazz great Bill Henderson), a retired sound man who
believes in ``magnetic perfection'' and dispenses sage advice about
matters of the heart.
</P>
<P>
   By meeting their opposites, the brothers are forced to confront
lifelong behavioral patterns and decide if it's worth making some
changes. It's a conceit that's sometimes a little too cute and
convenient, but it works, thanks in large part to the performances.
Miller is particularly appealing as the single mom who worries that
Tony loves her out of pity, and Henderson anchors the movie as the
knowing, doughnut-loving old-timer.
</P>
<P>
   Kevin Jordan, a New York University grad and Martin Scorsese
protege, directs with assurance in his feature debut, perfectly
capturing the story's small, intimate moments. Having managed this
with a $40,000 budget and 12-day shoot, it marks Jordan as a
filmmaker worth watching in the future. &QL;

Henderson. &QL;

SNIFFING OUT THE LIARS AND CHEATERS 
</HEADLINE>
   (Circuits)  
 By DENNIS BLANK    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Many of her clients are surprised when Kellie Carlisle, a
high-tech investigator in Orlando, Fla., tells them she really
doesn't need to have physical custody of a suspected computer in
order to reach inside the labyrinth of chips and wires for the
information she needs.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am a good-guy hacker,'' said Carlisle, who legally breaks
into password-protected computer systems for private detectives,
banks and large corporations. Often within minutes, she has laid
out records of illegal drug transactions, infidelity, fraud or
pornography. What she finds often shocks even her most educated
clients.
</P>
<P>
   In less than a year, Carlisle, a former computer consultant for
Bell Laboratories, has built her company, Advanced Computer
Investigations, into a multimillion-dollar business that employs 72
contract workers. For that, she credits God and her love of
ferreting out information from what she calls the ``gutless
warriors'' who commit crimes from their living rooms.
</P>
<P>
   What particularly worries her is what she says are the hundreds
of teen-agers being lured from their homes by smooth-talking sexual
predators over the Internet. ``There's a lot of creeps out there,''
Carlisle said. ``They know just what to say to seduce somebody.''
</P>
<P>
   What pushed her to become a computer detective was a crime in
which she was the victim. One evening last August, while walking
across a golf course to her home in Celebration, Fla., near
Orlando, she was assaulted and raped by a man she worked with.
</P>
<P>
   After she pressed charges, Carlisle urged police investigators
to retrieve the man's personal computer, which she believed would
contain a trail of evidence, including e-mail messages, that would
help convict her assailant. They told her it couldn't be done.
</P>
<P>
   So she set out to prove that it could be done and began working
with a private detective, Robert Brown, whom she describes as her
friend and mentor. Her case is still being investigated.
</P>
<P>
   Among Carlisle's clients are a family trying to find a runaway
child, a wife trying to prove that her husband is having an affair
and a bank that suspects a customer of laundering money. Many of
her corporate clients hire her to track the doings of disgruntled
employees, like the unhappy worker at an Internet service provider
who used the company's database to send out disparaging e-mail
messages about the company.
</P>
<P>
   Carlisle is part of a fast-growing network of private and public
investigators who specialize in computer crime. James Murray, who
is president of the High Technology Crimes Investigation
Association, said the organization has grown by 700 members, to
2,300, in the last year.
</P>
<P>
   ``Obviously, there is increased use of computers and access to
the Internet,'' Murray said, ``and with that is the opportunity for
people who choose to commit crimes using a computer. We really need
to train a lot more people.''
</P>
<P>
   Businesses and investigators say services like Carlisle's are
needed more than ever.
</P>
<P>
   ``We found we needed people like Kellie to retrieve
information,'' Brown said. ``It's almost a necessity because in
this day of cyberspace sex and so forth, it is something we can't
get along without.''
</P>
<P>
   The easiest part of Carlisle's job is cracking passwords. ``The
two most common passwords are `God' and `sex,'' she said. With the
aid of special software, she can usually figure out a password in
minutes.
</P>
<P>
   As a high-tech crime investigator, she uses a number of tools to
get the information she needs. Her husband, Michael, a computer
consultant, has developed proprietary software, and she is a fan of
Norton Internet Security 2000.
</P>
<P>
   To catch an errant husband, for example, Carlisle can monitor
his computer use with a ``sniffer,'' software that captures picture
images on the computer screen every few seconds and is
automatically routed to one of her investigators.
</P>
<P>
   ``We can `sanitize' a computer to catch and prevent unauthorized
intrusion and corruption of files such as bank accounts, e-mails
and pictures,'' Carlisle said.
</P>
<P>
   Carlisle keeps her legal bases covered. She received a signed
statement from the wife in the adultery case, for example, that
gives her access to information because the woman and the husband
owned the computer jointly.
</P>
<P>
   She also enlists the help of Internet service providers, who are
more than willing to cooperate with releasing e-mail addresses
after she tells them they may be prosecuted for protecting a
suspect. She emphasizes to her clients that they must be willing to
prosecute offenders after her staff uses computer forensics'
techniques to extract data that is encrypted, damaged or even
deleted.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am hoping to get more into homicides,'' Carlisle said.
``That's where my interest really lies. Everyone confesses their
crime, and people tend to confess a lot on their computer. They
have to get it off their chest.''

ARTTISTS JAM AT SMOOTH-JAZZ FEST
</HEADLINE>
  (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
(Eds: Fact box below. `Friday' refers to Sept. 1,2000.) 
By FRED SHUSTER 
c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Smooth-jazz may be the Rodney Dangerfield of pop genres _ it
gets no respect.
</P>
<P>
   There are many reasons for this. Some say smooth-jazz is jazz
for people who hate jazz, or know nothing about it. Some say it's
new age with saxophones.
</P>
<P>
   Remember, smooth-jazz is the radio format that's home to the
likes of the dreaded (by true jazzers) Kenny G, Boney James and
Dave Koz. One of the genre's biggest outlets is local station
KTWV-FM (94.7) _ the Wave. But that station has found room to play
some imaginative music _ specifically, pianist Brad Mehldau's cover
of Neil Young's ``Old Man'' from the ``Space Cowboys'' soundtrack,
among other pieces.
</P>
<P>
   Not all of them go that far.
</P>
<P>
   Some artists involved in the music refuse to even cop to the
smooth-jazz label. For example, of the acts on Friday's ``Montreux
Festival on Tour'' show at the Universal Amphitheatre, featuring Al
Jarreau, Roberta Flack, David Sanborn, Joe Sample and George Duke,
few would admit to playing that type of music, which partly has its
origins in the mid-'70s work of saxophonist John Klemmer.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is not a smooth-jazz show in the classic sense,'' insists
tour musical director Duke, the eclectic keyboardist, producer and
singer who made trend-setting fusion albums in the '70s and went on
to produce some of the biggest names in r&AMP;b and jazz. ``The term is
a little strange because there's not a lot of jazz in the smooth.
We're a nation of musical followers instead of innovators.
Smooth-jazz sounds manufactured, like it comes from Detroit.''
</P>
<P>
   For 34 years, international jazz, rock, gospel, pop and blues
acts have jammed on the stages of the Montreux Jazz Festival in
Montreux, Switzerland. This is the first year the concept has been
taken on the road, to 21 cities.
</P>
<P>
   ``The most wonderful thing about it is the jam session
approach,'' says veteran crooner and five-time Grammy winner
Jarreau. ``It makes people's eyes light up. On these multiple-act
bills _ unless you go to a late-night jazz spot _ you don't usually
see these kinds of mixes and matches in these interesting
combinations, everyone playing with everyone else.''
</P>
<P>
   For example, Jarreau, whose current album, ``Tomorrow Today''
(GRP/VMG), has spent 23 weeks in Billboard's Top Contemporary Jazz
Albums chart, will sing the Count Basie tune, ``Shiny Stockings,''
with Duke, while saxophonist Sanborn will be involved in numerous
musical meetings.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're supporting each other at various times,'' says
keyboardist Sample, whose current hit album, ``The Song Lives On''
(PRA/GRP), features singer Lalah Hathaway, daughter of the late r&AMP;b
great Donny Hathaway.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are no formulas on this stage,'' he adds. ``It's a
compilation of various artists and sidemen and musicians and
vocalists who have something to say. It's a very unformulized
concept. These are the types of acts that the smooth-jazz stations
have created from.''
</P>
<P>
   While Los Angeles' highly successful Wave shows imagination,
other new adult contemporary/smooth-jazz formats across the country
reveal less. At smooth-jazz stations elsewhere, a typical playlist
includes generous helpings of often bland pop instrumentals by the
likes of Kenny G, David Benoit, James, Koz and Fourplay _ and no
Steely Dan, Kenny Garrett, George Benson, Ronny Jordan or Mehldau,
artists that could easily fit the format.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's room for all of it,'' declares L.A. Wave music
director Ralph Stewart. ``There are a number of smooth-jazz
stations in the top five of their markets. We all know where our
sweet spot is. I believe there's room to grow the format. People
want a little surprise in the music programming.''
</P>
<P>
   Sample believes the music would be better off if it wasn't so
heavily researched by radio stations.
</P>
<P>
   ``Smooth-jazz wouldn't be an offensive term if they were doing
it without consultants and one guy ruling it and they were really
getting into the music of the artist,'' says Sample, one of the
founders of pioneering jazz-funk group the Jazz Crusaders.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, as the Montreux tour travels the country, audiences
are getting something they rarely see these days _ musical
experimentation and improvisation, even if the results are
decidedly easy to swallow.
</P>
<P>
   And the crowds, ranging widely in age and makeup, have been
coming in droves.
</P>
<P>
   At a show a few days ago in Tampa, Fla., for instance, Jarreau
called for the house lights to be turned up.
</P>
<P>
   ``It looked like the United Nations in there _ white, black,
Asians, Cubans, Puerto Ricans _ an interesting mix of ages and
musical backgrounds,'' says Duke, whose new largely vocal-oriented
album, ``Cool,'' is due in early October. ``The show is so diverse.
It's really a variety show, a thoroughly integrated variety show.
Like, I'll be playing something and all of a sudden David Sanborn
will come out and start jamming with me. Last night, I was playing
some space music and a guy from the crew came out in an alien mask.
Stuff like that.''
</P>
<P>
   Jarreau is an artist who is comfortable both in improv sessions
and more controlled musical environments. Dubbed ``the voice of
versatility,'' the singer has performed many times at the Montreux
Festival in its home base.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm lucky,'' he says. ``I'm getting a lot of airplay without
having to change what I do. I'm not gonna rap and nothing's
sampled, but we have kept the sound current.''
</P>
<P>
   Jarreau bemoans the fact that there isn't a lot of competition
waiting in the wings these days. In the age of hip-hop, few
memorable singers are being produced, he says.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hip-hop is the sound kids want today,'' Jarreau says. ``We've
kind of lost a generation, sadly. There's a fine group of young
singers out there, but their music doesn't offer them a broad
format for singing as it could. I wish there were more singers, but
this is the day of the rapper. There's great rap and mediocre rap,
like anything else.''
</P>
<P>
   Equally disappointing, Jarreau continues, is the lack of
exciting new instrumentalists on the scene. He chalks that up to
the all-encompassing commercial effects of hip-hop, too.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've lost a generation who might've learned an instrument,''
the singer says. ``Today, it's all about sampling and rapping. Kids
who might've looked up to Herbie Hancock or any number of players
aren't doing that. They're sampling.
</P>
<P>
   ``The other upsetting trend is the closing of the clubs _ not
just jazz clubs but Top 40 _ where people can hear actual music
being performed.''
</P>
<P>
   Sample went even further: ``I wish they would put a jazz club
back into every black neighborhood in every American city.''

U.S. REJECTS DIRECT TALKS WITH REBEL GROUP HOLDING AMERICAN
TOURIST 
</HEADLINE>
  (EDS: This early version will be updated as needed.) 
 By SETH MYDANS   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   BANGKOK, Thailand _ The Muslim rebel gunmen who have kidnapped
an American tourist in the southern Philippines belong to a
particularly brutal faction that has tortured and killed hostages
in the past.
</P>
<P>
   Two days after seizing the tourist, Jeffrey Schilling, 24, a
member of the group told a local radio station Wednesday that it
was ``fully prepared'' to talk with the United States, but only if
Libya, Iraq, North Korea and China also took part.
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, said the group member, Abu Sabaya, ``Maybe we
will behead him.''
</P>
<P>
   In Washington, a spokesman for the State Department, Philip
Reeker, ruled out negotiations, saying, ``The United States does
not make deals with terrorists, and this organization, the Abu
Sayyaf group, is an organization which is listed in our patterns of
global terrorism as one of the radical Islamic separatist groups
operating in the southern Philippines.''
</P>
<P>
   He stressed that the United States would not pay ransom money
but, in answer to a question, said mediation by other nations like
Libya would be welcome.
</P>
<P>
   Libya, which has longstanding contacts with the rebels, has
stepped in to negotiate for the release of a dozen Western hostages
kidnapped four months ago by the Abu Sayyaf group. Libyan officials
said on Tuesday that they would be willing to help in the case of
Schilling.
</P>
<P>
   So far, Libya has secured the release of six of the Westerners,
paying a ransom of $1 million for each of them. The chief
Philippine negotiator, Roberto Aventajado, said Wednesday that he
expected the last six Westerners to be released soon.
</P>
<P>
   But in what could be a troublesome sign for the case of
Schilling, Aventajado said he was optimistic because those other
hostages are being held by a separate, and perhaps more amenable,
faction of the Abu Sayyaf group.
</P>
<P>
   Abu Sayyaf is a minor group in a long-running Muslim separatist
war in the south of the Philippines, an overwhelmingly Roman
Catholic nation. Unlike the major participants, it has occupied
itself more with terror and ransom kidnappings than with
ideological warfare.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Formed in 1991 by a veteran of the anti-Soviet war in
Afghanistan, Abu Sayyaf, which means ``Bearer of the Sword,'' has
earned a reputation as one of the more aggressive of the region's
armed groups.
</P>
<P>
   In 1993 it killed seven people by rolling grenades down the
aisle of a Roman Catholic cathedral. In 1995 it massacred 53 people
in a shooting spree in a Christian-dominated village. Its kidnap
victims have included Spanish nuns, an American Bible translator
and a fishery worker from Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
   But it had remained a small group of perhaps 200 armed men until
the windfall of ransom money from its recent kidnappings. According
to some reports, new recruits have swelled its number to as many as
5,000 fighters.
</P>
<P>
   As it grew, Abu Sayyaf fragmented into a half dozen sometimes
squabbling factions spread across several tiny islands. Its
internal divisions over tactics and money have complicated recent
hostage negotiations.
</P>
<P>
   The faction with which Aventajado has been negotiating has
treated its hostages carefully and has already released two dozen
of them _ in return for a reported total of at least $11.5 million
_ since its latest spate of kidnappings began in April.
</P>
<P>
   Naming two leaders of this faction, Aventajado said Wednesday
that ``I have received a letter from Robot and Mujib assuring me
that they don't have anything to do with this Schilling
abduction.''
</P>
<P>
   The separate faction that apparently seized Schilling is
responsible for the kidnapping earlier this year of about 50
Philippine schoolchildren and teachers whom it held for months,
sometimes in underground pits.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   At one point it apparently tortured and killed a Catholic
priest. At another it beheaded two teachers when the United States
did not respond to its demand for the release of Arab terrorists
convicted in the 1993 bombing of the World Trade Center.
</P>
<P>
   In a rambling radio interview, an Abu Sayyaf member suggested
that the group might make a similar demand in return for the
release of Schilling. He said formal demands would be announced on
Friday.
</P>
<P>
   The rebel member asserted that Schilling worked for the Central
Intelligence Agency, but both his family and U.S. officials
dismissed that claim.
</P>
<P>
   ``This individual is a completely innocent person who has been
unjustifiably seized,'' said John Caulfield, the U.S. consul
general in Manila.
</P>
<P>
   In Oakland, Calif., Schilling's home, a friend, Anthony Rodgers,
said: ``There's no CIA involvement. He's apolitical. He's just a
guy who happens to be in love. That's all it is.''
</P>
<P>
   Schilling is a graduate of the University of California,
Berkeley, who majored in Near Eastern studies and converted to
Islam, his friends said.
</P>
<P>
   According to his mother, Carol, he had gone to the Philippines
in March because of a longstanding interest in the region and had
stayed on because he fell in love with a woman from the southern
Philippines, Ivi V. Osani.
</P>
<P>
   ``I tried to get him out of the country three times but he
didn't come out,'' his mother said. ``He was too much in love.''

<P>
   PHILADELPHIA _ The Wobblies, diehard iconoclasts of the labor
movement, are still around. Still organizing. Still looking to
transform the world order.
</P>
<P>
   Over the last few years, the tiny yet feisty Industrial Workers
of the World has seen its membership grow _ to 1,000 worldwide, up
from a low of fewer than 100 in the early 1960s.
</P>
<P>
   And those members remain true to the concept of ``one big
union.'' They're radical syndicalists, as they have been since the
IWW's founding in 1905 in Chicago. (Quick labor history review: A
syndicalist favors bringing government and industry under control
of labor unions by means of ``direct action,'' such as general
strikes and, if need be, sabotage.)
</P>
<P>
   They fight to transfer all profits and power from bosses to
workers, because it's the workers who do all the work. That victory
would form the shell of a new society, they say _ as they have
said, loudly, for all these years.
</P>
<P>
   Their idealistic battle was ignited generations ago by Wobblies
that became legendary: Mother Jones, who agitated for labor rights
into her 90s and inspired a magazine that still bears her name.
Elizabeth Gurley Flynn, a co-founder of the American Civil
Liberties Union. Balladeer Joe Hill, whose last words were, ``Don't
waste time in mourning. Organize.'' Eugene Debs, who helped create
the Socialist Party in America.
</P>
<P>
   That the Wobblies still exist, much less are growing, runs
against a decadeslong decline in mainstream American labor union
membership. It hit a high of 27 percent of the workforce in 1953;
its current 14 percent is an all-time low, according to the Bureau
of Labor Statistics.
</P>
<P>
   The IWW has made inroads recently, organizing bookstores, small
shops, college-student workers and temporary employees. It got a
smattering of national publicity in 1996 when an employee was fired
after trying, unsuccessfully, to organize a Borders Books &AMP; Music
store in Philadelphia.
</P>
<P>
   The national IWW headquarters shifted this year from Ypsilanti,
Mich., to Philadelphia, site of former glory days: Back in 1916,
all but two of the bustling docks at this port were under IWW
control.
</P>
<P>
   And now, the top Wob is a young woman. She is Alexis Buss, a
slight, 27-year-old freckled Philadelphian who wears her IWW cap
backward. Buss was elected in January, after pledging ``to make the
IWW a cohesive fighting organization, rather than a collection of
isolated activists.'' To reinvigorate the IWW, once known_ and
feared _ as ``the fighting union.''
</P>
<P>
   No one remembers exactly why members are called Wobblies, or
Wobs for short, as they have been since the early 1900s. Some say
it's symbolic of the wobble saw, mounted to cut a groove wider than
the saw is thick. Others think it's based on an immigrant's
mispronounciation of the letters IWW _ ``eye
wobble-you-wobble-you.''
</P>
<P>
   From its founding, the IWW has been one intense bunch:
</P>
<P>
   _ They wrote and sang the most enduring labor songs, including
``Solidarity Forever,'' ``Rebel Girl'' and ``The Preacher and the
Slave,'' origin of the phrase, ``pie in the sky.''
</P>
<P>
   _ They staged dramatic job actions: In 1912, Wobs lead 10,000
strikers at the American Woolen Co. mills in Lawrence, Mass.,
forcing managers to give workers significant pay raises. Strikers
were beaten and a woman worker was killed by shots from the swarms

</P>

   _ They've constantly fought for a seemingly unattainable goal:

   But now, ``what I hear all the time is, `Wobblies? You guys

buttons with such slogans as ''4 Hour Day, 4 Day Week'' and ``Stop
Exploiting Student Workers!''
</P>
<P>
   A tattooed man toting a motorcycle helmet approaches. He eyes
the selection on the corkboard leaning against Buss' leg.
``Wobblies? Cool,'' he says. He pays her for several pins, offers a
variation on ``glad to know you guys are still around,'' and shakes
her hand.
</P>
<P>
   The day is hot. Buss is standing in the sun. She shifts feet.
It's important to sell buttons, she says. ``They're popular. They
bring in money.'' Bumper stickers, too. One says, ``Because
capitalism cannot be reformed.''
</P>
<P>
   Buss is a 21st-century Wobbly. She works to generate revenue,
while still supporting the overthrow of capitalism.
</P>
<P>
   She laments the ``squandering'' of a $200,000 bequest to the IWW
in the early 1990s. ``Let's just say that it wasn't as well spent
as it should have been,'' she says. Instead, the money, from two
former members in the Pacific Northwest, ``just kind of went away,
into lots of little places.'' Buss would rather have invested it _
which runs counter to that old Wobbly saying that the ``the union
treasury is in the members' pockets.''
</P>
<P>
   Buss once even accepted a management job _ forfeiting her IWW
membership _ to ensure that workers at a print shop had a fair
boss. ``We figured, better me than somebody else.''
</P>
<P>
   She comes from traditional Pennsylvania blue-collar roots, and
joined the IWW at age 19. Her grandfather was a longtime union
organizer at a steel plant. ``Working there totally destroyed his
hearing,'' she says.
</P>
<P>
   Even after he'd been incapacitated by Alzheimer's disease,
``he'd see me and say, `How's the union?' I was happy we had that
link.''
</P>
<P>
   She passed on a college education, taking just one labor law
course.
</P>
<P>
   Now her title is IWW general secretary-treasurer. It reflects
the union's disdain of authority. ``We tried having a president
awhile back, members didn't go for that,'' she says.
</P>
<P>
   (FIRST OPTIONAL TRIM ENDS)
</P>
<P>
   Buss heads a movement based on ideals that, ironically, hinder
it from gaining any real power.
</P>
<P>
   The IWW is a pure democracy, controlled by its rank and file
without a traditional leadership structure. Dues start at just $5 a
month, so it's perpetually cash-poor.
</P>
<P>
   Members, tasked with literally organizing the entire world, are
themselves difficult to corral. Most are independent thinkers who
lean toward the cantakerous. They are socialists, atheists,
intellectuals, dreamers. Some have multiple piercings and tatoos;
others, gray ponytails.
</P>
<P>
   Even determining just how many Wobblies there are is tricky.
``It varies by month, when people pay their dues,'' Buss says.
There is no demographic information on the thousand or so members.
(By comparison, the AFL-CIO currently has about 13 million
members.)
</P>
<P>
   Wobbly locals are active across the country, from Boston
(Education Workers Industrial Union 620) to San Francisco (Marine
Transport Workers Industrial Union 510). There also are branches in
England, Australia, South Africa _ ``traditional Wobbly
strongholds,'' as Buss says.
</P>
<P>
   Tradition is what lures, and inspires, most Wobblies.
</P>
<P>
   ``I believe in unionism, that all labor unions must come
together,'' says Miriam Fried of Philadelphia, the employee fired
after the '96 organizing drive at Borders. ``The Wobblies are the
most dedicated union around. I believe workers should make their
own decisions. In the IWW, it's direct democracy, from the bottom
up.''
</P>
<P>
   Sharon Vance, another Philadelphia Wobbly, says the IWW has
``the big advantages without the big disadvantages of other
unions.''
</P>
<P>
   That includes representing workers usually overlooked. ``Even if
it's a workplace with just two people and one boss, we're there to
organize,'' she says.
</P>
<P>
   Melvyn Dubofsky is an expert on the IWW. He's a history
professor at Binghamton University-State University of New York and
author of the definitive, ``We Shall Be All: A History of the
Industrial Workers of the World,'' being reissued this November.
</P>
<P>
   ``The IWW reached their real peak during World War I,'' Dubofsky
says. ``So, actually, they've survived as a miniscule force for
more than 80 years.''
</P>
<P>
   Along the way, the passionate Wobblies have become part of the
cultural texture of America, he says. They appear as characters in
Dashiel Hammett's ``Red Harvest,'' in John Dos Passos' ``U.S.A
Trilogy,'' in ``From Here to Eternity'' by James Jones.
</P>
<P>
   Not to mention the enduring myth of larger-than-life Wobbly
martyr Joe Hill, executed by a Utah firing squad for a murder that
many still insist he didn't commit.
</P>
<P>
   As the song goes, ``And standing there as big as life, / And
smiling with his eyes, / Joe says, ``What they forgot to kill /
Went on to organize, / Went on to organize.''
</P>
<P>
   What union bosses ``forgot to kill'' was the Wobbly dream of one
union for all, regardless of race, nationality, gender, income or
occupation.
</P>
<P>
   ``Different people and different generations find parts of that
dream that appeals to them,'' Dubofsky says.
</P>
<P>
   And that is what keeps the movement going. Just barely.
</P>
<P>
   IWW headquarters is in a gritty Philadelphia neighborhood, with
an address that belies its name: Spring Garden Street. There are no
gardens here, only rundown buildings, pitted curbs, worn and
splintered front doors.
</P>
<P>
   Behind one is the old walk-up that Wobblies are slowly
renovating. There will be an office for Buss, a conference room, a
library for IWW books and pamphlets. The rooms are now a jumble of
bookshelves and desks and half-unpacked boxes and construction
tools. A window fan whirrs in the dusty humidity.

<P>
   What decor there is leans toward red, the color of socialism,
the Wobbly color. There's a red phone, piles of copies of the
legendary ``Little Red Songbook.'' A massive banner nearly covers
one wall: ``AN INJURY TO ONE IS AN INJURY TO ALL.''
</P>
<P>
   Buss is greeting visitors at the headquarters' first open house.
The event has drawn about 30, mainly young people wearing red or
black T-shirts. Causing a quiet buzz of excitement is a celebrity
guest, Socialist Party presidential candidate David McReynolds.
</P>
<P>
   ``My young comrades in the party persuaded me to run,'' says
McReynolds, 70, a retired peace activist who lives in New York's
East Village.

from a fund-raiser the night before for another presidential
candidate, Ralph Nader.

said they had extra food, and asked if we wanted it. I said sure.''

<P>

</P>
<P>
   Buss is a pragmatist. When she took over, the IWW had an $8,000
deficit; now it's solvent. She aims to be able to accept a small
salary so she can drop her part-time typesetting job. She wants to
reach out to younger retail workers and workers toiling too many
hours without overtime. She hopes to circulate more literature,
increase the Wobbly Web presence, organize job actions, build cash
reserves, and, of course, sign up more members.
</P>
<P>
   And she has one more goal:
</P>
<P>
   After his cremation, Joe Hill's ashes were divided and sent to
IWW delegates to be scattered around the world. A small pillbox of
his cremains, after taking a circuitous route, finally ended up
back at the headquarters of the IWW, the union Hill helped to make
famous.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd like to get an urn, but we can't afford it,'' Buss says.
``We'll have to raise some money.''

<P>
   PHILADELPHIA _ The Wobblies, diehard iconoclasts of the labor
movement, are still around. Still organizing. Still looking to
transform the world order.
</P>
<P>
   Over the last few years, the tiny yet feisty Industrial Workers
of the World has seen its membership grow _ to 1,000 worldwide, up
from a low of fewer than 100 in the early 1960s.
</P>
<P>
   And those members remain true to the concept of ``one big
union.'' They're radical syndicalists, as they have been since the
IWW's founding in 1905 in Chicago. (Quick labor history review: A
syndicalist favors bringing government and industry under control
of labor unions by means of ``direct action,'' such as general
strikes and, if need be, sabotage.)
</P>
<P>
   They fight to transfer all profits and power from bosses to
workers, because it's the workers who do all the work. That victory
would form the shell of a new society, they say _ as they have
said, loudly, for all these years.
</P>
<P>
   Their idealistic battle was ignited generations ago by Wobblies
that became legendary: Mother Jones, who agitated for labor rights
into her 90s and inspired a magazine that still bears her name.
Elizabeth Gurley Flynn, a co-founder of the American Civil
Liberties Union. Balladeer Joe Hill, whose last words were, ``Don't
waste time in mourning. Organize.'' Eugene Debs, who helped create
the Socialist Party in America.
</P>
<P>
   That the Wobblies still exist, much less are growing, runs
against a decadeslong decline in mainstream American labor union
membership. It hit a high of 27 percent of the workforce in 1953;
its current 14 percent is an all-time low, according to the Bureau
of Labor Statistics.
</P>
<P>
   The IWW has made inroads recently, organizing bookstores, small
shops, college-student workers and temporary employees. It got a
smattering of national publicity in 1996 when an employee was fired
after trying, unsuccessfully, to organize a Borders Books &AMP; Music
store in Philadelphia.
</P>
<P>
   The national IWW headquarters shifted this year from Ypsilanti,
Mich., to Philadelphia, site of former glory days: Back in 1916,
all but two of the bustling docks at this port were under IWW
control.
</P>
<P>
   And now, the top Wob is a young woman. She is Alexis Buss, a
slight, 27-year-old freckled Philadelphian who wears her IWW cap
backward. Buss was elected in January, after pledging ``to make the
IWW a cohesive fighting organization, rather than a collection of
isolated activists.'' To reinvigorate the IWW, once known_ and
feared _ as ``the fighting union.''
</P>
<P>
   No one remembers exactly why members are called Wobblies, or
Wobs for short, as they have been since the early 1900s. Some say
it's symbolic of the wobble saw, mounted to cut a groove wider than
the saw is thick. Others think it's based on an immigrant's
mispronounciation of the letters IWW _ ``eye
wobble-you-wobble-you.''
</P>
<P>
   From its founding, the IWW has been one intense bunch:
</P>
<P>
   _ They wrote and sang the most enduring labor songs, including
``Solidarity Forever,'' ``Rebel Girl'' and ``The Preacher and the
Slave,'' origin of the phrase, ``pie in the sky.''
</P>
<P>
   _ They staged dramatic job actions: In 1912, Wobs lead 10,000
strikers at the American Woolen Co. mills in Lawrence, Mass.,
forcing managers to give workers significant pay raises. Strikers
were beaten and a woman worker was killed by shots from the swarms
of 22,000 military police.
</P>
<P>
   _ They were famous for their propaganda: ``Keep warm, burn out
the rich.'' ``The boss needs you, you don't need him.'' ``Good pay
or bum work.''
</P>
<P>
   _ They've constantly fought for a seemingly unattainable goal:
As the preamble to the IWW constitution reads, ''... a struggle
must go on until the workers of the world organize as a class, take
possession of the means of production, abolish the wage system, and
live in harmony with the Earth.''
</P>
<P>
   (FIRST OPTIONAL TRIM BEGINS)
</P>
<P>
   But now, ``what I hear all the time is, `Wobblies? You guys
still around?' '' Buss says at a recent protest march while hawking
buttons with such slogans as ''4 Hour Day, 4 Day Week'' and ``Stop
Exploiting Student Workers!''
</P>

the selection on the corkboard leaning against Buss' leg.
``Wobblies? Cool,'' he says. He pays her for several pins, offers a
variation on ``glad to know you guys are still around,'' and shakes
her hand.

DEUTSCHE BOERSE CHIEF SCOFFS AT RIVAL BID FOR LONDON STOCK
EXCHANGE 
</HEADLINE>
   By EDMUND L. ANDREWS   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   FRANKFURT, Germany _ Werner Seifert, the head of Germany's stock
exchange, refused Wednesday to sweeten the terms of a proposed
merger with the London Stock Exchange, dismissing a rival bid of
$1.2 billion by OM Gruppen AB of Sweden as ``ridiculous and
derisory.''
</P>
<P>
   But the unexpected, and hostile, bid by OM, which owns the
Stockholm stock exchange, has ignited speculation about other
takeover bids for the London market, potentially from companies
that do not even operate securities exchanges at the moment. It has
already temporarily blocked the planned merger with Deutsche Boerse
AG, parent of the Frankfurt market.
</P>
<P>
   Seifert and other German executives asserted Wednesday that they
would press ahead with their plans, and that Deutsche Boerse's
shareholders would still vote on the merger plan as previously
scheduled on Sept. 14. But the London Stock Exchange has postponed
its own shareholder vote, and the plan is for all practical
purposes in at least temporary hiatus.
</P>
<P>
   Rolf Breuer, chief executive of Deutsche Bank AG and chairman of
Deutsche Boerse, said the exchange might consider organizing a
higher counterbid, possibly in conjunction with the Milan, Italy,
and Madrid, Spain, exchanges, but said they had no plans to mount
such an action yet. In a deal reached this spring, the London and
Frankfurt markets form a carefully-balanced ``merger of equals''
and create a pan-European equities exchanged called iX.
</P>
<P>
   German executives said Wednesday that they were confident that
OM's bid would fail to win 75 percent of the shareholder votes at
the London Stock Exchange, the minimum percentage required for the
takeover to succeed. At least for the moment, Seifert said, the
Deutsche Boerse will simply watch the situation unfold.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'll decide to make a move when we feel it's right,'' Seifert
said here Wednesday. ``The situation is different now, but not
worse.''
</P>
<P>
   Financial executives across Europe, however, are bracing for the
possibility of yet more bids.
</P>
<P>
   ``The London exchange is a sitting duck,'' one executive said.
``This has completely changed the game board.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The debate is no longer about the ins and outs of the iX
proposal,'' the executive said. ``The debate is now about who will
come along with a biggish wad of cash. Anyone who thinks they would
be good at running an exchange can try.''

   Joe Eszterhas is nervous. You know Joe _ he wrote Sharon Stone's
flasher pic, ``Basic Instinct.'' This is the guy who gave the world
the movie ``Showgirls'' _ and even though the world gave it right
back to him, holding it with tongs, he continues to be a Famous
Screenwriter. He's worried about Gore-Lieberman; he thinks they'll
start a new reign of virtue, so he took out a full-page ad in
Variety to warn his fellow sybarites. ``No more Hollywood money for
Al Gore,'' Eszterhas demanded. ``I'm a writer who likes pushing the
envelope, and Joe Lieberman frightens me.''

   Could the Democrats ask for anything more? It fits perfectly
with their new role as Safely Devout. Gore, according to The New
York Times, has said he asks himself ``What would Jesus do?'' when
confronted with a thorny moral dilemma. (Perhaps Jesus would tell
Pilate there is No Controlling Roman Authority.) Lieberman has been
making speeches so ridden with references to the Creator that even
the Anti-Defamation League is getting annoyed. If the Father of
``Showgirls'' is worried about these guys, they must be for real.
</P>
<P>
   The secular left wonders when someone will stand up to these
moralizing spiritualists. The religious right barks: How come these
guys can mention God without getting in trouble?
</P>
<P>
   Into this fray rides Eszterhas, warning the land that the very
future of envelope-pushing is in danger. And of course we must push
it, and push it again, even though it's been pushed and stretched
so much that it sags like the skin of a sick elephant. If Eszterhas
had directed ``Saving Private Ryan,'' he would have staged the
invasion of Normandy with an army of lesbian strippers. That's
pushing the envelope. ``Apollo 13''? Simple: three strippers
marooned in space. Which one is a bisexual murderess? Houston, we
have a problem _ and it's not wearing underwear!
</P>
<P>
   Take that, envelope!
</P>
<P>
   Eszterhas is not the mainstream. But people like him are always
redefining the mainstream, pumping the tributaries full of brackish
water until the mainstream overflows its banks. Politicians like
Lieberman, earnest and clueless, are bailing with a pop-bottle cap.
George Bush pere, for example, once made the famous remark that the
nation needed to emulate the Waltons, not the Simpsons. This struck
the Gen X demographic as a classic clueless grandpa quote; he
probably cost the GOP 20 million votes for the next 10 years.
</P>
<P>
   Same thing with Lieberman's pronouncements. In an interview with
Variety, Lieberman suggested that ``Friends'' was not fit for prime
time, but should be shown in movie theaters. Yes, raincoated
debauchers would have to skulk off to the triple XXX pornhouse to
see ``Friends'' and wait in moist, panting anticipation for the
next naughty single-entendre. If Lieberman is offended by
``Friends,'' someone show him the ``Tom Green Show'' and watch him
dissolve into a smoking puddle of embarrassed goo.
</P>
<P>
   But Lieberman has been talking about using the power of
government to affect your entertainment choices, and that's what
steams Eszterhas and others. Lieberman's made earnest, nerdy noises
about making TV stations' licenses contingent on a review of their
programming, and making it illegal for minors to be the targets of
ad campaigns for R-rated movies. Of course, no one wants minors to
be the targets, but how would you prove such a thing?
</P>
<P>
   It's the New Democrat approach. Small, precise, targeted laws
that make great sound bites and accomplish nothing. That's why
Eszterhas' campaign will be ignored by his fellow
envelope-piercers. Let Gore and Lieberman make their pious peeps.
Nothing will change.
</P>
<P>
   As for Eszterhas, well, Hollywood knows the score there, too.
Joe has a book to sell _ ``American Rhapsody,'' a funny and
coruscating account of impeachment. This is good publicity. And he
needs it: Once upon a time, the words ``From the Writer of `Basic
Instinct''' sold a few tickets, but people have come to realize
that's now a warning label.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps people will head to Amazon.com to buy his book. If they
do, they'll see a thumbnail biography with this precious line: ``He
has also won awards for attending every one of his son's Little
League games and for writing `Showgirls.'''
</P>
<P>
   What makes him prouder _ mainstreaming the crotch shot or
cheering from the sidelines of his son's games? The latter,
probably. But woe to the God-bothering moralist who thinks he
should be prouder of his son than his movies. Lunatics like that
are downright dangerous.

PURSES WITH PERSONALITY
</HEADLINE>
  (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
 By CATHERINE NEWTON 
 c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Maybe this has happened to you. You go to your book club, your
PTA meeting or the office, and three of your fellow females are
toting the exact same Kate Spade bag you just bought instead of
this week's groceries.
</P>
<P>
   This is life with purses in 2000. Amazing. Amazingly redundant.
</P>
<P>
   Sherie D. Giles of Houston is a woman with a solution. A year
ago, she quit her job as a computer software consultant and started
designing a line of handmade bags, dubbed Cocktail Fusion. The bags
are made from a wide range of fabrics that she hunts down from the
Far East to the East Coast. Trims include one-of-a-kind beading,
fabric flowers and outlandish feathers and furs. The bags are fun,
sassy, sometimes sophisticated _ and always unique.
</P>
<P>
   Giles says she'll never make more than four bags from the same
fabrics, and all are reversible. So if you do find yourself in the
company of another Giles purse, you can always turn your bag inside
out. Reverse course, as it were.
</P>
<P>
   The purses have stories. Here's one, in a gold silk fabric
printed with red fish silhouettes. The material comes from Austin,
Giles says. She got it from a woman who sits on her porch, drinks
beer and stamps fabric. And there's a black velvet bag, handpainted
in gold, from Asia. A red bag with a monkey print has tiny glass
beads as fringe. There's an animal-print bag with fur trim that
reverses to a honey-brown velvet. And a red and black silk bag with
a feathery plumage that reverses to elegant basic black. Retail
prices for the bags range from about $75 to $135.
</P>
<P>
   Giles' purse persuasion began when the similarly whimsical
Christmas stockings she made for a home arts-and-crafts show _ most
in animal prints _ sold out. She did some prototypes of the
cocktail purses, enlisted her mother, Mickey, as seamstress and
took her wares to statewide arts fairs _ where, again, they sold
big. Soon, Giles' sister Ginny was able to leave her full-time
banking job and join the growing family sewing circle. Today, Giles
concentrates on finding fabrics and designing the purses, which
Ginny and Mickey piece together in their homes in Liberty, Texas.
</P>
<P>
   Gearing up for the holiday season, Giles says the trio currently
produce about 300 purses a month _ which is just fine with her.
</P>
<P>
   ``It gives my mom something to do,'' she says, ``and my sister
got to quit her job.'' As for Giles, ``It fixes my shopping
fetish.''
</P>
<P>
   What's in the future for the woman with a purse passion? Giles
says that she's happy with the pace of the company and that she
doesn't want it to get too large. Although, she says, ``My husband
wants it huge.''
</P>
<P>
   And it may have to get bigger. Because couldn't we all _ Spade,
Coach and Fendi fans that we are _ use a little more purse-onality
in our lives?
</P>

 HOWE-INTERVIEW-TEX
 CAN A PLAYWRIGHT CORRECT PAST INJUSTICES? AND HOWE
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients)
 By MARK LOWRY
 c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram
<TEXT>
<P>
   If she could accomplish one athletic feat, says playwright Tina
Howe, it would be to traverse the unpredictable waters of the
English Channel.
</P>
<P>
   ``I love the (idea) of traveling through the water,'' she says.
``To me, there's something so elegant and elemental'' about
swimming.
</P>
<P>
   In lieu of making that challenging voyage herself, she wrote a
play about a woman from an upper-crust Boston family whose
rebellious spirit led her to become the first woman to swim the
Channel.
</P>
<P>
   That play is ``Pride's Crossing,'' a 1997 Pulitzer Prize
finalist. The 1997 production at Lincoln Center in New York earned
kudos from critics, including New York Post critic Clive Barnes,
who wrote: ``Most plays you watch, but every so often there comes
one you experience. Tina Howe's delightful and moving `Pride's
Crossing' is definitely one you experience and savor.''
</P>
<P>
   Along with the critical raves, the play also garnered a Drama
Desk award for actress Cherry Jones in the lead role of the
fictional Mabel Tidings Bigelow. In the play, at age 90, Bigelow
recalls life experiences from ages 10 to 60 while planning a Fourth
of July croquet party.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the reminiscences parallel the author's own. Born in New
York, Howe, 62, grew up in what she calls a wealthy New England
family of eccentrics. Her plays and characters reflect that life of
extravagance, excess and intellect, but like herself, her heroes
have a wild side, which she considers essential if those to the
manor born are to accomplish anything significant.
</P>
<P>
   ``I saw what growing up in a privileged life did to my parents.
I think it's poison,'' she says. ``When I was growing up, I was in
constant rebellion.''
</P>
<P>
   Mabel, the marathon swimmer of ``Pride's Crossing,'' is a
composite of the author and her Aunt Maddy, who is approaching 100.
Maddy also had a rebellious spirit, Howe says, but never acted upon
it.
</P>
<P>
   ``She had boundless amounts of love and tolerance. Even though
she had grown up in this rather punishing, elitist world. It always
angered me that she wasn't allowed to reach her full potential,''
Howe says of the society and era that discouraged women from
pursuing their dreams.
</P>
<P>
   ``One of the things one can do as a playwright is change the
facts of life. I just felt that I wanted to rewrite Maddy's past
for her, and I wanted to give her an opportunity to achieve
something extraordinary.''
</P>
<P>
   Howe, who teaches at Hunter College and New York University, has
been writing plays for 30 years, including the 1984 Pulitzer
finalist ``Painting Churches'' and the 1987 Tony-nominated
``Coastal Disturbances.''
</P>
<P>
   But for all the awards and praise she's received, Howe has also
met with fierce criticism.
</P>
<P>
   Her first two works, ``The Nest'' and ``Birth and After Birth,''
delved into gender politics in the early '70s, and audiences
weren't ready for such challenging fare. So Howe decided to
re-evaluate her subject matter and looked around to see what kinds
of material were successful and jibed with her artistic vision. It
was 1973, and Edward Albee and Tom Stoppard were drawing notice.
``It was clear audiences were into escape, so I decided to write a
play set in a museum. I wrote a smart piece about aesthetics that
had 55 characters that were played by a cast of 18. This was my
attempt to be commercial,'' she says, laughing.
</P>
<P>
   The play was ``Museum,'' in which visitors to a modern art
exhibit debate over white canvases presented as art, tackling
perceptions about what constitutes art long before Yasmina Reza's
recent Broadway hit ``Art.'' Howe also pays homage to the aesthetic
world in ``The Art of Dining,'' in which a brilliant writer shows
her shocking lack of table etiquette. This she counts as her most
autobiographical play, and her personal favorite.
</P>
<P>
   Howe acknowledges a debt to the Absurdists: Luigi Pirandello,
Samuel Beckett, Jean Genet, Albee. In fact, she counts seeing a
1960 production of Ionesco's ``The Bald Soprano'' in Paris as the
moment that changed her life.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had never seen theater like that,'' says Howe. ``What I
particularly loved about Ionesco was the joy and irreverence with
which he approached theater, the extravagance of language and the
extravagance of event, and the daring and mischief he was willing
to make.
</P>
<P>
   ``To me, that's what the theater is supposed to do. It's
supposed to challenge an audience and shake them up. It's not
supposed to be well-behaved and well-manicured like television.
It's supposed to test the limit of word and action.''
</P>
<P>
   Although Howe's work isn't considered absurd _ a style
characterized by seemingly meaningless dialogue in which the
significance is buried beneath what is (and is not) said _ her
reverence for the genre occasionally pops up in her work, such as
in the open-ended expression of ``Approaching Zanzibar.''
</P>
<P>
   She refers to Zanzibar, as well as ``Birth and After Birth'' and
``One Shoe Off,'' as ``the plays that got me into trouble.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's one thing to have characters break into jigs or put out
imaginary fires, or go completely berserk on the stage,'' she says
of ``The Bald Soprano,'' ``or even what Beckett was having Pozzo
and Lucky do'' in ``Waiting for Godot.'' ``It's one thing when a
man can go to the outer edge, but to have a woman explode her own
domestic arena, I think that really frightened the critics.''
</P>
<P>
   Whether or not she has the critics on the run, Howe likes to
keep busy. Her next project is getting her new play ``Women in
Flames,'' about a middle-aged female playwright who falls in love
with a young leading man, produced. She's also negotiating with the
Ionesco estate to write translations of ``The Bald Soprano'' and
``The Lesson.'' Last year, she even performed as the maid in a
student production of ``The Bald Soprano.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I wasn't terribly good; I got better as I went along,'' she
says. ``It was very frightening, but it was a benchmark experience.
I think it taught me that I don't belong on the stage.''

 &HT;    COMMENTARY: SAY IT AIN'T SO JOE
 &HT;    Moving in (k) commentary and (p) political categories for

 &HT;    Sunday, Sept. 3.
 &HT;    By ANDREW J. GLASS

<P>
   WASHINGTON As Sen. Joe Lieberman approached the podium at the
Democratic National Convention, the band struck up the theme from
``Chariots of Fire,'' a movie that featured a Jewish track star who
overcame bias and emerged as a winner.
</P>
<P>
   But the real bias that Lieberman faces these days arises from
his fellow Jews. As Lieberman began his quest for the vice
presidency, some prominent Jewish leaders urged him privately not
to talk so much about his faith. When he ignored their advice, they
went public with their criticism.
</P>
<P>
   Whoever wins in November, that underlying problem won't go away.
</P>
<P>
   The Anti-Defamation League was founded by Jews in 1913 to fight
bigots, especially anti-Semites. The group believes that the best
way to insure the well-being of Jewish Americans, who comprise 2
per cent of the U.S. population, is by strict adherence to
separation of church and state.
</P>
<P>
   Lieberman, who defines himself as an observant Jew, has invoked
his faith in public throughout his long political career. He has no
intention of changing his stance.
</P>
<P>
   Here's what has changed.
</P>
<P>
   In the mid-1940s (when I arrived on these shores with my
parents, fleeing the Nazi terror), a Gallup Poll revealed that 37
percent of Americans would be comfortable voting for a Jewish
president. Fifty years, later 92 percent answered ``yes'' to the
same question.
</P>
<P>
   What continues is a poorly understood struggle between
tradition-minded ``Orthodox'' Jews and modern ``progressive'' Jews,
whose forebears were strongly influenced by the European
Enlightenment and who have generally sought to assimilate
themselves into the mainstream culture.
</P>
<P>
   In a religious context, the word ``Orthodox,'' which means
``correct belief,'' initially arose within Christianity, where it
denoted, from the viewpoint of liberal Protestants, a cast of mind
that relied too heavily on ritual. The term was first applied
derisively to conservative Jews by their reform-minded critics.
</P>
<P>
   Lieberman observes most of the 613 ancient Jewish religious
rites that stem from the Torah, the first five books of the Old
Testament. He worships at Kesher Israel, an Orthodox synagogue in
Georgetown, where men and women remain segregated, sends his son to
a Orthodox Jewish day school and refuses to campaign on Saturday,
the Jewish Sabbath.
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, the senator often greets women by shaking
hands, which many observant Jews and Muslims regard as a religious
abomination. And he attends Saturday sessions of the Senate,
although he walks the five miles from his home to do so.
</P>
<P>
   Louis Farrakhan, the Nation of Islam leader, raises the wrong
question when he asks whether ``white America (is) ready to have a
Jewish vice president who is a heartbeat away from being president
of the United States of America?'' (''Black America,'' he adds,
``would always be ready to receive a Jewish vice president because
it has never been a problem for black people what a person's faith
is if that person is qualified.'')
</P>
<P>
   Americans of all hues have moved beyond that. Rather, the real
schism persists between Jews who would remove religion from the
public discourse and an observant politician who would not.

   Whoever wins in November, that underlying problem won't go away.
</P>
<P>
   The Anti-Defamation League was founded by Jews in 1913 to fight
bigots, especially anti-Semites. The group believes that the best
way to insure the well-being of Jewish Americans, who comprise 2
per cent of the U.S. population, is by strict adherence to
separation of church and state.
</P>
<P>
   Lieberman, who defines himself as an observant Jew, has invoked
his faith in public throughout his long political career. He has no
intention of changing his stance.
</P>
<P>
   Here's what has changed.
</P>
<P>
   In the mid-1940s (when I arrived on these shores with my
parents, fleeing the Nazi terror), a Gallup Poll revealed that 37
percent of Americans would be comfortable voting for a Jewish
president. Fifty years, later 92 percent answered ``yes'' to the
same question.
</P>
<P>
   What continues is a poorly understood struggle between
tradition-minded ``Orthodox'' Jews and modern ``progressive'' Jews,
whose forebears were strongly influenced by the European
Enlightenment and who have generally sought to assimilate
themselves into the mainstream culture.
</P>
<P>
   In a religious context, the word ``Orthodox,'' which means
``correct belief,'' initially arose within Christianity, where it
denoted, from the viewpoint of liberal Protestants, a cast of mind
that relied too heavily on ritual. The term was first applied
derisively to conservative Jews by their reform-minded critics.
</P>
<P>
   Lieberman observes most of the 613 ancient Jewish religious
rites that stem from the Torah, the first five books of the Old
Testament. He worships at Kesher Israel, an Orthodox synagogue in
Georgetown, where men and women remain segregated, sends his son to
a Orthodox Jewish day school and refuses to campaign on Saturday,
the Jewish Sabbath.
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, the senator often greets women by shaking
hands, which many observant Jews and Muslims regard as a religious
abomination. And he attends Saturday sessions of the Senate,
although he walks the five miles from his home to do so.
</P>
<P>
   Louis Farrakhan, the Nation of Islam leader, raises the wrong
question when he asks whether ``white America (is) ready to have a
Jewish vice president who is a heartbeat away from being president
of the United States of America?'' (''Black America,'' he adds,
``would always be ready to receive a Jewish vice president because
it has never been a problem for black people what a person's faith
is if that person is qualified.'')
</P>
<P>
   Americans of all hues have moved beyond that. Rather, the real
schism persists between Jews who would remove religion from the
public discourse and an observant politician who would not.

CONNECTING TO A SENSE OF HOME FROM FAR AWAY 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Argentina, France, Australia, Spain, Germany, Switzerland,
Belgium, the Netherlands, Britain, Iran)   (Circuits)

<TEXT>
<P>
   In the 1800s, when the Irish left for America, relatives bid
them goodbye with a wake, a celebration normally held for the
deceased.
</P>
<P>
   The likelihood that the emigrants would come back was thought to
be about the same as their chance of returning from the dead; in
those days there were no quick trips back for Christmas, no phone
cards and no digital video of the grandchildren.
</P>
<P>
   Such journeys now take hours instead of weeks, and
telecommunications have reduced the distance between home and away.
Most recently, the Internet has bridged the gap, so that
expatriates can be more connected to home than ever before. Whether
the new American residents are from Australia, France, India or
almost anywhere else in the world, there is a Web site that ties
them to families and alleviates the strange grief of unavailable
junk food. (What? No Tim Tams?)
</P>
<P>
   Kate Juliff of Australia, an information technology manager who
has lived in New York for seven years, started Australians Abroad
(www.australiansabroad.com) in 1996 with Richard Rankin, in order
to ``raise issues of relevance to expatriates, as well as provide
stories of interest, resources and a cybermeeting place for
Australians living overseas.'' The site now has 600 regular users
with 1,000 drop-ins a day from 50 countries.
</P>
<P>
   Australians Abroad features a message board, a chat room, a
resources list with links to travel, immigration and international
shipping sites, as well as columns written by Australians,
including, ``Letter from New York'' and ``Musings from Melbourne.''
The anecdotal columns, in which Australian slang is common, address
issues facing many expatriates _ managing finances in Australia
from overseas, obtaining credit in a foreign country, finding
insurance.
</P>
<P>
   In one ``Letter from New York,'' Juliff wrote about the
difficult experience of a parent's illness and eventual death while
she was living overseas. Australians Abroad also has a search
engine and database for Australian-related sites.
</P>
<P>
   Two sites, www.farsinet.com and www.iaol.com, also try to
provide a cyberhome-away-from-home. FarsiNet, for the international
Iranian and Persian community, gives weather forecasts for 50
cities in Iran, relevant news articles from The Associated Press
and articles and resources on Iranian and Persian business, poetry,
art, food, history and events (mostly in the United States). It has
a chat forum for ``Foreign husbands of Iranian women,'' and an
online translator converts any English word into Farsi script.
</P>
<P>
   The Indians Abroad Online offers users a residential or business
dial-up service, free e-mail messaging, home pages, horoscopes,
greeting cards (``Happy Love at First Sight Day''), audio music
files, a chat room and encyclopedic information on Indian dining,
fashion, immigration, science and technology, and ``Bollywood''
(the Indian film industry). The Matrimonials section allows users
to find a mate by specifying traits like age, immigration status,
religion or caste.
</P>
<P>
   Some sites bring expatriates together based on country of
residence rather than country of origin.
</P>
<P>
   Al Nevarez was working in Japan, first for the Ford Motor Co.
and then Visteon Corp., when he started jotting down notes about
his favorite restaurants in his Palm Pilot. As Nevarez watched
other Americans doing the same, he decided to develop a PDA and Web
tool to bring ``peace of mind to expatriates in an environment
where there is little English.''
</P>
<P>
   Now, Nevarez said, 300 users download the
site(www.japaninyourpalm.com) to their PDAs everyday, and in July,
there were 130,000 hits at the site. He also offers an i-mode
mobile Internet cell version of the site.
</P>
<P>
   JapanInYourPalm.com features restaurant reviews and resources
organized into topics like sports, nightlife, health, family and
church, as well as train schedules and restaurant menus in English.
</P>
<P>
   ``Living overseas brings a unique appreciation for the power of
the Internet,'' said Nevarez, who returned to the United States in
July but, with contributions from friends still in Japan, updates
the site daily.
</P>
<P>
   Other location specific sites include www.expatsingapore.com,
which claims 20,000 users a month and over 1 million users overall,
and www.expatvillage.com, a site for foreigners in Buenos Aires,
Argentina, that went online in mid-April. The sites carry weather
information, features on culture, travel, dining, immigration and
advertisements. The classified advertisements in Expatvillage.com
offer everything from ``Focused Psychotherapy in Spanish, English
or French'' to ``European home appliances repair.''
</P>
<P>
   Another site (www.expataccess.com) is based on both nationality
and location with a focus on people who are moving abroad. Having a
baby in France, Spain, Germany, Switzerland, Belgium, the
Netherlands or Britain is just one of the many detailed topics. The
site also has sections for American or British residents who are
moving to continental Europe, offering tips like how to import a
car. Similar in scope is www.peoplegoingglobal.com, which covers
every continent and is dense with country-specific governmental and
economic information and related links.
</P>
<P>
   Betsy Burlingame, who once lived in Germany, started a Web site
(www.expatexchange.com) as a master's thesis project at New York
University. The site, which went online in 1997, has four employees
and more than 100 volunteers. It joins with companies in a
``General Store'' to tailor products and services for members, like
Medibroker International, a medical and health insurance broker
that is run by expatriates.
</P>
<P>
   Expat Exchange has information for nonmembers and private forums
for members (registration is free). The forums are divided into
categories including ``women's,'' ``men's,'' ``spouse's'' and
``GenXpat'' (young professionals), as well as jobs, books and
travel. The site has 8,000 members from more than 60 nations and
18,000 monthly visitors, and it seeks to create a community for
expatriates in all countries. Country specific forums feature
stories like the eight-part diary of Lexie, an American cat, and
her journey through the rigorous Australian quarantine process.
</P>
<P>
   The mission of Expat Expert, said Robin Pascoe, a Canadian whose
husband was a diplomat in the Canadian Foreign service for 15
years, is to ``inform, advise, and offer online friendship to
relocating expatriate spouses and families.''
</P>
<P>
   Pascoe said she started the site (www.expatexpert.com) when she
realized, ``how desperate expats are for online help with the
emotional side of living abroad, which for the spouse can include
giving up a career, major blows to self-esteem (you become Mrs.
Husband's job) and general wear and tear on the mind and body from
looking after everyone else.''
</P>
<P>
   The features on Expat Expert offer a perspective on recurrent
issues, like culture shock, health emergencies and the trials of
repatriation.
</P>
<P>
   The curious or the lonely expatriate can also find advice and
resources at sites attached to publications, like The Weekly
Telegraph (www.globalnetwork.co.uk) and The International Herald
Tribune (www.iht.com), or organizations like the Canadian Foreign
Service Community Association (www.fsca-acse.org) or Outpost
(www.outpostexpat.nl), sponsored by Shell International.
</P>
<P>
   The number of expatriate sites is growing, and even if they do
not get wandering souls closer to home, they give users a chance to
bond with people engaged with similar issues. At the very least,
surfing these Web sites helps kill time while waiting for a
life-saving shipment of Reeses Peanut Butter Cups (or Twisties or
Barry's Tea or Bovril).

   If you can't be with the one you love, get a Webcam.
</P>
<P>
   At least, that's what Simon Wong, an engineer in California, and
Chiunwei Shu, a student in Arizona, have done to make it easier to
live in different states and still date each other. Wong and Shu,
who met when Shu was visiting California, say they spend at least
two hours every night with their Webcams trained on their bedrooms.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's cool,'' Wong said. ``I'll be at home watching TV _ and
she's not here, so we can't hang out _ and she'll be at home doing
her thing, reading a book, and I can check out what she's doing.''
</P>
<P>
   Shu agreed. ``If I'm studying, it's not bothering me,'' she
said. ``But we can both look up and smile at each other.''
</P>
<P>
   High-tech communication isn't just giving e-commerce a global
outlook or letting adolescent gamers shoot at one another across
town or across the country. Tools like instant messages,
videoconferencing software, Web phones and wireless communications
are making it easier to keep love alive in long-distance
relationships.
</P>
<P>
   Wong and Shu use NetMeeting, Microsoft's videoconferencing
program, to gaze adoringly at each other over the Internet while
they talk.
</P>
<P>
   They also keep in touch via instant messages and daily e-mail
notes, usually with photos. Shu said she took a picture of herself
and sent it to Wong every day so he could keep up to date on
whether she looked happy, sad or stressed. But aside from that
analogue standby, the phone, videoconferencing is their favorite
means of communication.
</P>
<P>
   ``If it weren't for the Internet,'' Wong said, ``we wouldn't
spend the same percentage of the day communicating _ you simply
can't talk on the phone all the time. But it's easy to spend two
hours on NetMeeting. It actually feels like we hang out all the
time.''
</P>
<P>
   There is an added benefit, Wong said, laughing: ``If the phone
rings on her side, I can still play the jealous boyfriend,'' he
said. ``Like, `Who's calling you?' Or if we're talking, I can see
her expression _ if she looks bored, I can say, `Are you really
interested in this conversation?'''
</P>
<P>
   Prentice Welch and Erika Lam, both 24, are old hands at using
technology to keep in touch while they are apart. They have been
sweethearts since high school but in 1997, Lam moved to Costa Rica
for a year of college while Welch stayed in Davis, Calif. ``That
was before we knew about instant messaging,'' Lam said.
</P>
<P>
   The two kept in touch by sending e-mail almost every day. Lam
used an online florist to send Welch flowers, and he sent her the
Web address for his basketball league's site so she could keep up
with his games. (But she didn't check. ``It took too long,'' she
explained).
</P>
<P>
   Two years later, Welch moved to Beijing for the school year
while Lam stayed in San Francisco. This time, instant messaging was
more common, and they started doing that right away.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was huge to be able to chat live,'' said Welch, now a
computer operator in San Francisco, where he and Shu share a home.
``We'd set up dates, when we'd meet online every other day. And
sometimes I'd be online, sitting in a cafe in Beijing, and we'd
bump into each other. That was so cool.''
</P>
<P>
   Long-distance romance over the Web is not all sweetness and
light. For one thing, annoying technical glitches sometimes crop
up. Wong said that he and Shu sometimes spent an hour or two trying
to get the software to work, to no avail. ``Then it's like spending
time on the relationship that ends up not being time spent
together,'' Wong said.
</P>
<P>
   The technology can be distracting, he added. ``Sometimes
focusing on this little screen image distracts from the
conversation,'' he said. ``It's not as real.''
</P>
<P>
   Lam and Welch said that while instant messaging had helped them
stay in touch, high-tech communication could make things harder.
</P>
<P>
   Lam said that conflict over international data lines could be
hard to manage. ``An argument in cyberspace is the worst,'' she
said. ``You never get a feeling of resolution.''
</P>
<P>
   Welch agreed. ``And when we'd get in fights _ as much of a fight
as you can have typing rapidly at each other _ she'd always win
because she can type faster,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The limits of the technology could prove frustrating.
``Sometimes it made me want to cry,'' Lam said. ``It was like, I
can't touch you through the screen.''
</P>
<P>
   Both agreed that even though they felt connected when they were
online, they had become lonely as soon as they turned away from the
computer.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd be in some smoky Internet cafe,'' Welch said with
melancholy in his voice.
</P>
<P>
   ``And I'd be alone in my dark room,'' Lam said with a shudder.
</P>
<P>
   They resolved that problem when Lam moved to Beijing to be with
Welch after a five-month separation. The couple are expecting their
first child in October, and they say their days of Internet
connections are behind them. ``Next time we go somewhere,'' Welch
said as he took Lam's hand, ``we'll go together.''

</P>
<P>
   For some people, the problem is not maintaining a relationship,
but ending one. Ask Sun Kim, a 24-year-old research associate in a
San Francisco cardiology laboratory. When her boyfriend moved to
Korea last December for a consulting job, the two decided not to
keep dating long distance but resolved to stay friends.
</P>
<P>
   That, however, proved more difficult than it sounded. ``While we
were dating,'' Kim said, ``he was really good at e-mailing. He
worked in a dot-com and sat around in a cubicle and e-mailed me
every day. He sent messages, stuff he found on the Internet, and he
was the king of Egreetings.'' (Egreetings.com is an online
greeting-card service.)
</P>
<P>
   When he moved to Korea, nothing changed. ``It was bad because we
were supposed to be broken up,'' Kim said, ``but he'd send flirty
e-mails and use Net phones to call me from Korea _ for free _ all
the time.'' She said her ex-boyfriend had also beamed a copy of the
PocketSutra _ a copy of the Kama Sutra for handhelds _ to her
Handspring Visor.
</P>
<P>
   ``Geographically,'' Kim said, ``the relationship changed, but
most of it stayed the same through technology. It was like it was
before, only I never saw him anymore. It was like, `We're just
friends, but I'm still going to be your virtual boyfriend.'''
</P>
<P>
   Frequent instant messaging, or IM, sessions made the
relationship drag out for months, Kim said, even though they were
continents apart. ``About six months after he left,'' Kim said, ``I
was ready to date other people. I told him that, and it turned into
this big `define the relationship' discussion over IM.''
</P>
<P>
   The time lag between replies opened up room for confusion. ``I'd
ask a question,'' Kim said, ``and he wouldn't respond right away,
and I'd wonder: Is he offended? Away from his desk? Working?''
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, Kim said she thought that her former boyfriend
preferred the medium _ lag time or no _ to face-to-face discussion.
``At one point in this weird breakup discussion over instant
messaging,'' she said, ``I said, `You're probably so relieved we're
doing this over IM,' and he said, `Yeah, I am, actually.'
</P>
<P>
   ``Finally, I told him: `I think it would be a good idea if we
don't communicate like this anymore. Call me on the phone or don't
contact me.' There was no response, so I logged off. He called a
few days later, and he hadn't gotten the message. His Yahoo
Messenger had been logging him on and off so he never got my
message. He thought everything was fine.''
</P>
<P>
   She added: ``It's hard to convey emotions over IM. If you're
mad, it's hard to convey that in your tone without coming right out
and saying, `I'm mad at you.'''
</P>
<P>
   ``In general,'' she said, ``technology makes it hard to have an
old-fashioned breakup, where you never see or speak to each other
again. I kind of miss the old-fashioned breakup.''

 &HT;    POLITICAL TICKER: Texas gets court order on health care
 &HT;    (EDs: A brief roundup of the day's campaign events, pulled from
Cox staff and wire reports.)
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   A federal judge, saying Texas has not lived up to a 1996
agreement to make major changes in its Medicaid system, has ordered
the state to improve access for children and fix other problems in
medical coverage for low-income Texans. The ruling, by U.S.
District Judge William Wayne Justice, comes as Texas Gov. George W.
Bush has been drawing criticism on the subject from Al Gore. The
order could trigger sweeping changes in the state's program,
prompting officials to back off a plan to transfer most poor people
into managed care and to raise reimbursements to dentists who treat
Medicaid patients. Bush campaign officials noted that the case grew
out of a lawsuit filed in 1993, predating Bush's election as
governor in 1994.
</P>
<P>
   CONFRONTATION ON MEDICARE
</P>
<P>
   Keeping the focus on health care, Al Gore is demanding that
George W. Bush say what he is willing to do to save Medicare, all
the while promoting his own $400 billion boost for the program.
Gore was holding a town hall meeting with running mate Joe
Lieberman in Portland, Ore., to discuss his plan to preserve
Medicare and offer a new prescription drug benefit for senior
citizens. Bush, who plans to issue details of his Medicare plan
next week, responded today on a live on-air and online CNN
interview. He said the Clinton-Gore administration squandered
opportunities during the past seven years to shore up Medicare.
</P>
<P>
   BUSH'S EDUCATION PACKAGE
</P>
<P>
   George W. Bush kept his focus today on education, which he sees
as a winning voter issue. ``When you raise standards, students will
follow,'' Bush told students at a high school in Portsmouth, N.H.
Bush's plan: increase the maximum Pell grant for first-year
students from $3,300 to $5,100; a tax exemption for participating
in tuition savings plans; a $1.5 billion grant to help states pay
for aid for advanced-placement high school students; and education
savings accounts that would allow contribution up to $5,000
annually per child, with tax-free withdrawals.
</P>
<P>
   TALKING ABOUT HOW TO DEBATE
</P>
<P>
   George W. Bush is dispatching aides to meet with major TV
network execs and the special debate commission to decide on times,
places and formats for the debates that Al Gore accuses him of
trying to duck. Bush denies trying to avoid prime-time face-offs,
and says he'd welcome them. Top advisers Joe Allbaugh, Andrew Card
and Don Evans are in Washington now to discuss debate scenarios
with officials at CNN, ABC, CBS, NBC, Fox, PBS and the Commission
on Presidential Debates. The Bush aides also plan to meet this week
and next with potential debate sponsors. After those sessions, Bush
will present his debate schedule, a counteroffer to Gore's.
</P>
<P>
   MILITARY AND TAXES ON SOUTHERN TOUR
</P>
<P>
   Dick Cheney made stops today in North Carolina and Georgia to
talk about defense spending and his concerns that the military is
overstretched. In North Carolina, he pushed for the Republican
ticket's tax-cut proposal and said a Bush administration would let
citizens decide how to spend the federal budget surplus. In
Georgia, Cheney blasted the Clinton-Gore administration for what he
says is a poor record of support for the military. Georgia
Democrats slapped back, saying Cheney is resorting to a tired
Republican line of attacking Democrats on the military to avoid
getting into the real issues: health insurance for children and
prescription drug coverage for the elderly.
</P>
<P>
   GORE MAKES PROGRESS IN THREE STATES
</P>
<P>
   Al Gore has reclaimed a double-digit lead in Maryland, has an
edge in Illinois, and has closed to a dead heat with George W. Bush
in New Hampshire, according to new state polls of the presidential
race. In Maryland, with 10 electoral votes, Gore led Bush 51-36
percent in a Gonzales-Arscott poll. In Illinois, with 22 electoral
votes, Gore had a 46-41 percent edge over Bush in a Mason-Dixon
poll. In New Hampshire, with 4 electoral votes, Bush had a 48-44
percent lead. The error margin in all three surveys was 4
percentage points. In polls taken before the party conventions,
Bush had been about even in Maryland and Illinois and ahead by 10
points in New Hampshire.
</P>
<P>
   JUDGE PULLS OUT OF REFORM PARTY BATTLE
</P>
<P>
   A federal judge in Lynchburg, Va., ruled today that he doesn't
have jurisdiction to decide who is the Reform Party's real
presidential nominee. Allies of Pat Buchanan sought an order
barring an opposing faction backing John Hagelin from operating
under the party's name. U.S. District Judge Norman Moon said he
lacked jurisdiction because the power struggle did not raise any
constitutional issue. Both sides are seeking $12.6 million in
Federal Election Commission money. Dale Cooter, lawyer for the
Buchanan faction, said he will take the issue to a state court,
possibly as early as next week. But he wasn't sure in which state
he would file.
</P>
<P>
   OUTREACH BY MAIL AND PHONE
</P>
<P>
   George W. Bush spent more than $40 million trying to reach
voters through advertising and by mail and telephone, nearly as
much as Al Gore doled out for his campaign during the primaries. An
analysis of campaign spending records shows that through July 31
shows that Bush spent $43 million _ nearly half of his
record-shattering $100 million campaign treasury _ on efforts to
reach voters, including $25 million on TV and radio ads. Gore spent
just $14 million on similar voter-targeted activity. Campaign
strategists say the spending spree should give Bush an edge with
voters for the fall campaign, when each candidate will be limited
to spending $67.6 million in federal funds.
</P>
<P>
   MEANWHILE, BACK AT THE RANCH
</P>
<P>
   The Secret Service is asking local county commissioners to do
more to control traffic and parking around George W. Bush's new
ranch near Waco, Texas. R.L. Smith, in charge of the Austin Secret
Service office, said his agency requested changes ``to get
clarification'' about local laws, especially since there is no
posted speed limit on the roads. Most of the problems have been
caused by the media, including trucks parked with satellite dishes
along the 22-foot wide road outside Bush's front gate. McLennan
County Commissioner Ray Meadows said officials had hoped they could
wait to see how Bush fared in the November election.
</P>
<P>
   SHOCKER FROM ELECTRICAL WORKERS?
</P>

   The United Electrical, Radio and Machine Workers of America was
debating today whether to endorse Green Party presidential
candidate Ralph Nader. Appearing at the union's annual convention
in Erie, Pa., Nader told the members that the Democratic Party,
labor's traditional partner in politics, promises too much and
delivers too little. He offered himself as a strong alternative,
claiming that President Clinton and Al Gore have failed to push
hard for a ban on hiring permanent replacements for striking
workers despite voicing support for it. A Nader endorsement, if it
comes, would be its first departure from backing Democrats, said
union spokesman Peter Gilmore.

   LABOR ONLINE FOR GORE
</P>
<P>
   The AFL-CIO has created a Web site for Al Gore to hold a live
Web cast on Labor Day for union members. The Web site will allow
union members to send e-mail messages to political candidates,
including Gore, George W. Bush and members of Congress. The Web
site _ www.workingfamilies.com _ also will feature a speech by John
Sweeney, the union president, and video messages from the ``Texas
Truth Squad,'' a group of workers who are traveling the country to
accuse Bush of doing little on issues that unions care about. Web
site users also will be able to register to vote, and can examine
the voting record of candidates for federal office. The site will
be up through Sept. 6.

   ALLEN LEADS ROBB IN VIRGINIA
</P>
<P>
   Ex-Virginia Gov. George Allen, the architect of Virginia's
Republican revival, holds an early lead over incumbent Sen. Charles
Robb in nearly every corner of the state, according to a new
Washington Post survey. Statewide, Allen leads Robb 48-43 percent
among registered voters and by 8 percentage points among those most
likely to vote. Allen enjoys wide margins of support among men,
married couples with children, whites, voters in their 20s,
veterans, the wealthy and newcomers to the state, the survey found.
Robb leads only in vote-rich Northern Virginia, but only by 6
percentage points, and in the Democratic stronghold of southwest
Virginia. The poll's margin of error for the overall results is 3
percentage points, and 4 percentage points for results based only
on likely voters.

   HEAVY ARTILLERY FIRING IN NEW YORK
</P>
<P>
   New York Senate candidates Hillary Clinton and Rick Lazio rolled
out the big guns today, with the first lady releasing a
fund-raising letter from President Clinton and the congressman
running a TV ad starring John McCain. ```I have worked as hard as I
could to turn our country around,'' the president writes in the
appeal. ``Now, the work must be carried on by others. No one is
more qualified than Hillary to do it.'' In the new Lazio ad, McCain
casts doubt on Clinton's claim that she is willing to give up
unlimited soft-money campaign contributions if her Republican
opponent does the same.

   BUCHANAN OUT OF ACTION
</P>
<P>
   Reform Party presidential hopeful Pat Buchanan will have no
public appearances until after Labor Day. He underwent gall bladder
surgery Aug. 19, and had a second operation four days later when
doctors found another stone. Now, ``he feels a lot better and is
coming along fine,'' said campaign spokesman Brian Doherty. ``But
after two operations and losing 15 pounds or so from not being able
to eat much, he needs to rest another week.'' Buchanan plans to
remain at home until Sept. 5.

   JILTED WIFE HEADS FOE'S CAMPAIGN
</P>
<P>
   Maryland Rep. Albert Wynn's worst enemy may be his estranged
wife, who is lending her services _ and her intimate knowledge of
the Democratic congressman _ to his GOP opponent. Jessie Wynn, who
is locked in a bitter divorce and custody battle with her husband,
a black Democrat, is serving as John Kimble's campaign chief. And
she has recorded this blistering message being transmitted by
telephone to thousands of homes in the Maryland suburbs of
Washington: ``Hi, this is Jessie Wynn, wife of Congressman Albert
Wynn. Albert Wynn does not respect black women. He left me for a
white woman. . . . Please help us defeat Albert Wynn.'' Kimble, who
is white, said he hopes to reach every home in the mostly black
district.
</P>
<P>
   ABOVE ALL, HE'S G. GORDON'S SON
</P>
<P>
   His name stands out among the crowded field of candidates for an
Arizona congressional seat. Tom Liddy is a Phoenix attorney, Marine
Corps veteran, party activist and ex-schoolteacher. But as the son
of G. Gordon Liddy, the Watergate henchman, Tom Liddy can't stray
too far from his heritage. ``My dad has given me a name that is
very high profile,'' he said. ``He's a guy who never backed away
from a fight and relished some of them. Like father, like son.''
The son now seeks to succeed Rep. Matt Salmon, who is keeping a
term-limit pledge to only serve six years in Congress. Liddy is
being supported by Arizona Sen. John McCain.
</P>
<P>
   FEW WORDS SAY IT ALL
</P>
<P>
   Dick Cheney says he's a ``man of few words'' who prefers low-key
campaign events without a lot of hoopla. Making a swing of Southern
states, he and his wife, Lynne, had spent Tuesday night, their 36th
wedding anniversary, in Jackson, Miss. His few words to several
hundred people at the local airport there: ``I can't think of a
better place to spend it than Mississippi.''
</P>
<P>
   CALIFORNIA EYES NEW PRIMARY SYSTEM
</P>
<P>
   California lawmakers are trying to revamp a wide-open primary
election process that was struck down by the U.S. Supreme Court. A
bill in the Legislature would implement a new primary system that
would permit independent voters to participate in primaries, but
limit them to voting for one party's candidates. The Democratic and
Republican parties bitterly fought the state's ``blanket primary''
approved by voters in 1996, contending it violated their
association rights by letting voters choose any candidate,
regardless of party affiliation. The Supreme Court agreed and
overturned the system in June. Alaska and Washington state have
similar primaries.

A WAVE OF THE HAND MAY SOON MAKE A COMPUTER JUMP TO OBEY 
</HEADLINE>
   (Circuits)  
 By ANNE EISENBERG    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Without a doubt, there are uncounted millions of people who have
made rude gestures to their computer screens in moments of
desperation. And the computers never respond, which doesn't help
matters.
</P>
<P>
   That may change. One day soon, computers may understand and
respond to many common human gestures, from simple pointing and
grasping to the complex motions used to conduct an orchestra.
</P>
<P>
   In laboratories in the United States and abroad, researchers are
experimenting with computer systems that use tiny cameras, fast
processors and smart software to identify and respond quickly and
accurately to a range of hand gestures natural to humans.
</P>
<P>
   Such systems promise to simplify the way people and computers
interact. For instance, people may one day walk through their
offices, living rooms or backyards and point out the chores that
need to be done to video-based interfaces that will pass on the
information to computers that can process motions as well as words.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hand gestures _ and eventually full body and facial
information _ are the natural complement to speech communication
with a computer,'' said Dr. Jakub Segen, a researcher who has
worked in this field for 10 years. Segen is a member of the
technical staff at Lucent Technologies' Bell Labs in Murray Hill,
N.J.
</P>
<P>
   He and Dr. Senthil Kumar reported their work on gesture
recognition technology, including tests of its accuracy, in the
July issue of Communications of the ACM, a journal of the
Association for Computing Machinery.
</P>
<P>
   Segen said he had been teaching the computer to recognize and
respond accurately to a number of gestures made by the hand. His
current project is aimed at making video conferences work better.
</P>
<P>
   ``Video conferences don't really cut it in their present form,''
Segen said. ``That's why I end up flying to California for
meetings. So this seemed like a promising area for improvement.''
</P>
<P>
   People attend Segen's virtual meetings by logging onto computers
equipped with cameras that observe them and with special software
that extracts important elements in their gestures. The computers
translate participants' gestures into the movements of animated
figures he calls varionettes, articulated, marionettelike
characters that imitate on the computer screen just what the people
at their desks are doing.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you raise your hand to make a point,'' Segen said, ``the
figure raises its hand, too.''
</P>
<P>
   He has also demonstrated his technology in a livelier spot than
a corporate meeting: The conductor's podium. Last year he conducted
a digital orchestra _ as cameras tracked the position of Segen's
hand, which was holding a baton, his software translated that
motion into tempos for the digitally sampled instruments.
</P>
<P>
   Such applications of gesture technology are not as far in the
future as they might seem.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Frederick Bianchi, a professor at Worcester Polytechnic
Institute and one of the founders of the Virtual Orchestra, the
computerized orchestra simulation that Segen conducted, has also
conducted the Virtual Orchestra by using Segen's system.
</P>
<P>
   ``We plan to have this technology on Broadway and on the road in
the next few years,'' Bianchi said. Without Segen's system, someone
keeps the beat for the Virtual Orchestra by tapping out a rhythm on
a computer keyboard. With the new software system, Bianchi said, a
conductor will be able to use the baton to set the dynamics and
speed of the orchestra.
</P>
<P>
   The system is set up for the one-handed conductor. What about
the conductor who uses two hands, one to keep the pace and the
other to signal crescendos or diminuendos or to tell players when
to come in?
</P>
<P>
   Richard Campbell, a colleague of Bianchi's on the Virtual
Orchestra project and an electrical engineering professor at
Worcester Polytechnic Institute, has supervised a graduate
student's dissertation on a gesture controller that can understand
two hands. ``One performance was the overture to Tchaikovsky's
`Nutcracker' with a full orchestral score,'' he said. ``The tempo
tracked beautifully.''
</P>
<P>
   While baton movements interest Campbell, Dr. Charles Cohen, vice
president of research and development at the Cybernet Systems Corp.
in Ann Arbor, Mich., has been concentrating on circles _
specifically, repeated circular motions. The work is being done for
NASA and the Army.
</P>
<P>
   The Army is using Cohen's programs to train scouts in the secret
hand signals they must transmit stealthily but accurately to
troops. ``These are exactly the gestures our system can
recognize,'' he said. The system promises to train scouts at least
as well as the most remorseless sergeant, delivering relentless
feedback about errors.
</P>
<P>
   For the National Aeronautics and Space Administration, Cohen is
developing kiosk screens that respond to gesture rather than touch.
Such screens would, for instance, let an observer wave a hand in a
circle to rotate a display of the space station.
</P>
<P>
   Gesture-driven screens sidestep the problems of wear and tear
that plague standard touch screens, problems like broken joysticks
and dirt on the screens. They also make life easier for users.
</P>
<P>
   ``We want to create kiosks where people can use their hands, not
a keyboard or mouse,'' said Stacey Morrison, the deputy chief
information officer for the Space and Life Sciences Directorate at
the Johnson Space Center in Houston. ``It's simpler if people can
just point their hand to go left or right.''
</P>
<P>
   Segen sees enormous potential for gesture technology. ``The
ultimate wireless interface will be optical,'' he said. And optical
devices can be very precise, he said, pointing out that cameras can
read license plates from space.
</P>
<P>
   So will computers someday be able to understand the kind of
unfriendly gestures that show that a user is reaching a point of
uncontrollable rage? The researchers have not tackled that problem
yet. But computers that evolve in that direction could be the ones
with the best chances of survival.

TWO NIXON AIDES DENY HE MEDICATED HIMSELF IN THE WHITE HOUSE 
</HEADLINE>
  (EDS: This early version will be updated as needed.) 
 By DAVID STOUT   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Two aides to President Richard M. Nixon said
Wednesday that they doubted he ever took the drug Dilantin, which
can induce mental confusion and nervousness, despite a new book
that says he did.
</P>
<P>
   The aides, John H. Taylor, the director of the Nixon Library in
Yorba Linda, Calif., who knew Nixon from the mid-1980s until the
former president's death in 1994, and Steve Bull, who was Nixon's
personal aide from mid-1969 until late 1974, said they were
skeptical of assertions in the book that Nixon medicated himself
with Dilantin given to him by Jack Dreyfus, the founder of the
Dreyfus Fund and an avid promoter of the drug.
</P>
<P>
   Dreyfus said last week that an account in ``The Arrogance of
Power: The Secret World of Richard Nixon'' that he gave Dilantin to
Nixon in 1968 was correct. Dreyfus said he gave him a bottle of
1,000 capsules of 100 milligrams each ``when his mood wasn't too
good,'' and later gave him another bottle of 1,000 capsules.
</P>
<P>
   The book written by Anthony Summers and published by Viking
paints an unfavorable portrait of Nixon politically and personally.
Its assertion that he freely medicated himself while coping with
the burdens of the White House is one of several contentions that
have been disputed by Nixon's relatives and associates. Taylor and
Bull volunteered their views in reaction to reports about the book.
</P>
<P>
   Taylor said the Richard Nixon he knew ``went to traditional
doctors when he was sick and always did what they said.''
</P>
<P>
   As for Dilantin, Bull, who is now director of government
relations for the U.S. Olympic Committee, said, ``I never saw any
evidence that he used any medication of that kind. Never.''
</P>
<P>
   Dreyfus has advocated the drug as being effective in dealing
with anxiety, anger, depression and other troubling conditions. The
Physicians' Desk Reference describes Dilantin as a barbiturate
relative used to treat seizures and says its side effects include
mental confusion, slurred speech, insomnia and nervousness.
</P>
<P>
   Taylor produced a summary of White House records from April 1969
through mid-1973 recalling numerous attempts by Dreyfus to gain
government backing for Dilantin through Nixon. The records state
that Nixon met with Dreyfus now and then socially, but they portray
the president as reluctant to get into lengthy discussions about
Dilantin.
</P>
<P>
   Taylor said Nixon might have accepted Dilantin from Dreyfus so
as not to hurt his feelings, but that if he did he threw it out
rather than take it.

REGULATORS INVESTIGATE FORD'S HANDLING OF DEFECTIVE TIRES ABROAD 
</HEADLINE>
  (EDS: This early version will be updated as needed.) 
 By STEPHEN LABATON   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Under growing political pressure, federal
regulators announced Wednesday that they had significantly
broadened their investigation of the Ford Motor Co. to examine its
handling of replacing potentially defective tires in 16 countries
outside the United States.
</P>
<P>
   The disclosure was made in a letter to Ford that was made public
Wednesday by the National Highway Transportation Safety
Administration asking the company to describe in detail the reasons
for the recall.
</P>
<P>
   The announcement followed the emergence of disputes between Ford
and Bridgestone/Firestone, the U.S. unit of Japan's Bridgestone,
about tire problems in Venezuela and Thailand. Ford recalled
Explorers equipped with Firestone tires in Venezuela last May after
a dispute in which Ford claimed the tires were defective and
Bridgestone said they were not. Ford is replacing the Firestone
tires with ones manufactured by Goodyear. But Bridgestone has
repeatedly assured Ford that there are no problems with the tires.
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday, a government agency in Venezuela is expected to
issue a report criticizing both Ford and Bridgestone.
</P>
<P>
   The two companies and American auto regulators are expected to
face intensive questioning next week when congressional hearings
begin over the tire recall.
</P>
<P>
   ``Manufacturers have certain legal obligations to report defect
problems and NHTSA has some obligations to Congress,'' said Ken
Johnson, a spokesman for Rep. Billy Tauzin, R-La., who heads one of
the House committees investigating the tire recall. ``Someone
dropped the ball and we're trying to find out who. But we're really
trying to figure out some broader issues. Did Firestone break the
law or is the law broken? We're going to have to take a hard look
at the law to make sure it's strong enough.''
</P>
<P>
   Set to testify next week are Transportation Secretary Rodney
Slater, federal highway safety officials, executives from the two
companies and safety experts. Congressional aides say they may also
take testimony from owners of Explorers involved in traffic
accidents that were caused by the tire defects.
</P>
<P>
   Ford has been bombarded with complaints in the weeks after
Bridgestone announced a recall of 6.5 million Firestone tires in
the United States, many of which were installed on Ford Explorers.
</P>
<P>
   Lawyers and safety investigators have said the tread can
separate when underinflated. Damage to the tires has been linked to
hundreds of accidents and dozens of deaths, according to safety
investigators.
</P>
<P>
   Adding to Ford's troubles this week was a preliminary ruling by
a California judge that Ford installed defective ignition modules
in 2 million vehicles between 1983 and 1995.
</P>
<P>
   Michael E. Ballachey, a Superior Court judge in Alameda County,
east of San Francisco, said Tuesday he intended to order the
company to recall and repair the cars and trucks. Plaintiffs have
alleged that the ignition mechanisms fail at high temperatures and
cause the engines to stall.
</P>
<P>
   A final decision will be issued Sept. 28. Ford has denied the
ignitions are faulty and has said they will appeal any decision
ordering a recall. Complying with an ignition recall could cost
Ford between $70 million to $250 million, consumer advocates said.
</P>
<P>
   Bridgestone, meanwhile, has been fighting to maintain its
reputation and public trust after the tire recall.
</P>
<P>
   Although Bridgestone and Ford had been working together on the
recall, and trying to reassure consumers who have bought the tires,
there are growing signs of tension between the two companies like
the tussle over Venezuelan tires.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday, Bridgestone announced its chief executive would fly
from Japan to Washington to testify before congressional committees
investigating the tire failure. But Ford's chief executive, Jacques
A. Nasser, has declined the invitation to testify next week,
prompting criticism from a subcommittee chairman.
</P>
<P>
   Ford official and congressional staff members are negotiating to
see if Nasser will appear before the House committee next week. A
scheduled hearing before the Senate Commerce Committee has been put
off until Sept. 13 because the committee chairman, Sen. John
McCain, R-Ariz., is recovering from skin cancer surgery.

   Telnet Still Available For Cruising the Web
</P>
<P>
   Q. What is Telnet, and what can it do? I have Windows 98. Can I
use Telnet?
</P>
<P>
   A. Although it is not used as much as it once was because of the
Web, Telnet can still be a good way to connect to other computers
from your own machine. It is a text-based system that dates to the
1970s, and some users who are used to point-and-click browsing may
find Telnet a bit arcane. If one doesn't mind the old-fashioned
interface of typed commands and numbered choices, however, it is a
speedy way to connect to systems like online library catalogs and
electronic bulletin boards.
</P>
<P>
   Yes, you can use Telnet with Windows 98, as long as you have a
Telnet program installed on your computer. (If you have configured
your Web browser properly, you can also use Telnet with it by
typing a command in the browser's URL box.)
</P>
<P>
   Most recent versions of Windows come with a program called
HyperTerminal already installed with the communications programs.
There are other Telnet programs, like NetTerm, that you can
download from shareware Web sites as well. Several Telnet programs,
including ones for Windows, Macintosh and Unix, are available from
the TuCows shareware site at www.tucows.com.
</P>
<P>
   Some popular Mac Telnet programs are BetterTelnet, dataComet and
NiftyTelnet. The National Center for Supercomputing Applications
keeps an informative (but no longer updated) page on its Telnet
program at www.ncsa.uiuc.edu/SDG/Homepage/telnet.html. The site
also provides a program manual that can be downloaded.
</P>
<P>
   Once you have become acquainted with your Telnet software, you
can use it to tap in remotely to other computers around the world.
The Library of Congress has a Web site but still allows users to
Telnet in to search its databases. Type locis.loc.gov in the Telnet
address box to get there. A list of other places to Telnet into can
be found at www.anzio.com/telnetsites.htm.
</P>
<P>
   Q. I use a Macintosh and have been getting a disturbing error
message from my Eudora e-mail program. It keeps saying something
about memory, then gives me these options: Quit or Live
Dangerously. What happens if I decide to live dangerously?
</P>
<P>
   A. Living dangerously can be a bit of an adrenaline rush, but if
you choose to do that with your e-mail program, it may soon start
crashing or have trouble starting up when you least expect it. That
particular alert box is warning you that the Eudora program is just
about out of the system memory that it needs to operate properly.
To make the message go away, you need to allot more of your Mac's
RAM to the program or start deleting old messages and mailboxes
that you don't need anymore.
</P>
<P>
   The Quit option you were given in the dialogue box anticipates
that you will tell your Mac to give Eudora more RAM to work with
because you need to shut down the program to adjust the memory
settings. Once you quit Eudora, go to your hard drive and locate
the program's icon. Click once on the icon, then press Command I on
the keyboard to call up the Get Information box for Eudora. You can
also get that box by selecting Get Information from the File menu.
</P>
<P>
   In the Get Information box, you will see the settings for
Suggested, Minimum and Preferred Memory size. (Some later versions
of the Macintosh operating system keep the Memory settings under a
pop-up tab at the top of the box.) To give Eudora more memory,
increase the numbers in both the Minimum and Preferred size boxes.
For example, if the minimum and preferred sizes are both listed as
1,024 kilobytes, changing both numbers to 3,072 kilobytes will
increase Eudora's share of RAM from one megabyte to three
megabytes. Once you have adjusted your settings, close the Get
Information box and restart Eudora. If you are still getting
messages about tight memory, repeat the process and increase the
memory settings even more.

   NBC specializes in adulterating hard-core Olympic sports into
treacly mush, so when the U.S. women's gymnastics team competes in
Sydney, Australia, next month, the network will undoubtedly torture
viewers with endless images of Bela Karolyi bearhugging his
teensy-weensy acolytes.
</P>
<P>
   These Karolyi squeezes _ at once heartwarming and creepy _ have
become the money shot of the Summer Olympics. In 1984, Mary Lou
Retton became America's darling when Karolyi leapt a barrier to
snuggle her. In 1996, Karolyi assured the immortality of the
``Magnificent Seven'' women's team when he told Kerri Strug to
vault on a gimpy leg, then scooped her up and carried her to the
podium to collect her gold medal.
</P>
<P>
   Thank heaven for little girls!
</P>
<P>
   NBC and women's gymnastics enthusiasts crave more Karolyi
histrionics in Sydney. The U.S. team is in trouble. It has no
name-brand star, and it tanked the last two world championships.
</P>
<P>
   In November, the national gymnastics federation lured Karolyi
out of retirement to serve as national team coordinator _ a kind of
Ubercoach. He has been conducting training camps for the elite
gymnasts at his Texas ranch all year. He supervised last week's
Olympic trials, and when they ended, he selected _ largely by
himself _ the six members of the Sydney team.
</P>
<P>
   Karolyi, the David Koresh of the gymnastics cult, is one of the
very few folks to successfully reconcile the values of Eastern bloc
communism and American capitalism.
</P>
<P>
   Karolyi and his wife Martha, also a gymnastics coach, defected
to the United States in 1981. He masterminded Romanian Nadia
Comaneci to her perfect 10 gold medal in the 1976 Olympics, but
irked Communist authorities after the 1980 Moscow Games.
</P>
<P>
   When he arrived here, he found American gymnastics in shambles.
Within a few years, he built one of the world's best teams by
marrying American-style public relations to Soviet-style training.
</P>
<P>
   Karolyi understood the importance of a snazzy image. He had
shown his flash in 1976, when he decorated his Romanian girls with
devastatingly sexy red hair bows. In the United States, he sought
cute, tiny, young gymnasts with bubbly personalities. Their small,
limber frames permitted them to do tricks that older girls
couldn't, but he also knew that judges would be seduced by his
enchanting pixies.
</P>
<P>
   Even as he trained his doll army, Karolyi perfected his public
self: Bela, the Transylvanian Delight. He mugged for the camera
with hugs and pep talks. According to Joan Ryan's devastating
expose of gymnastics, ``Little Girls in Pretty Boxes,'' some of his
former athletes allege that he offered affection only when cameras
were watching.
</P>
<P>
   He bragged about his protegees and boldly predicted victories.
He hammed up his accent and carnival personality, using broken
English to burnish his charmer image. Recently Bela described the
``spectaculous'' failure of the U.S. team at the world
championships. Reporter after reporter repeated the word in
stories. Now he says it all the time.
</P>
<P>
   In Eastern-bloc fashion, Karolyi built a gymnastics factory that
produced a few brilliant gymnasts and broke everyone else. Most top
gymnastics coaches punish their adolescent students, but even by
the sport's low standards, Karolyi was tough. ``Little Girls in
Pretty Boxes'' and 60 Minutes chronicled Karolyi's gulag. He called
his teen-age charges ``little engines'' and treated them like
machines. They worked out eight hours a day, six days a week _ a
schedule twice as rigorous as sports docs advise for teens.
</P>
<P>
   He prodded them to train despite stress fractures and ligament
damage. According to Ryan, he belittled already petite girls as
``fat cows'' and ``pregnant goats'' to get them to cut weight. Some
of them drank laxatives to get thinner; others were bulimic.
</P>
<P>
   He sought younger and younger girls to train, and
psychologically overwhelmed them. ``I am going to turn their little
minds around,'' he said. ``The young ones are the greatest little
suckers in the world. They will follow you no matter what.'' He
called his methods ``survival of the fittest'' and ``scorpions in a
bottle.'' He constantly set the girls against each other, knowing
that the survivors would be impervious to competition pressure.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bela is a great coach for two reasons,'' says Ryan. ``First,
he is an incredible motivator. He could get you to run through a
wall. And second, he has no conscience when it comes to the damage
done to these little girls. He says that he's the coach, and
everything else _ eating disorders, for example _ is the parents'
responsibility.''
</P>
<P>
   The Soviet-style tactics worked. Many girls washed out with
injuries, eating disorders and/or frustration. But the ones who
survived _ Retton, Strug, Kim Zmeskal, Dominique Moceanu _ were
tough as hell and would do anything for Karolyi. He produced 28
Olympians, nine gold medalists, 15 world champions, and six U.S.
champions.
</P>
<P>
   TV viewers, who saw the smiling survivors but not the castoffs,
fell in love with the Romanian bear. Even when Karolyi's less
savory methods were publicized, he was quickly forgiven. He won,
and winning erases sin. His defenders argue that all championship
athletes must be driven hard: Why coddle gymnasts?
</P>
<P>
   Today's incarnation of Karolyi is slightly more benevolent.
Since his 1996 retirement, he hasn't coached any gymnasts. As
national team coordinator, he supervises monthly training camps,
but gymnasts no longer work and live under his thumb. Their
coaches, who tend to be milder than Bela, maintain day-to-day
control. This allows the gymnasts to benefit from Karolyi's ability
to motivate and inspire without subjecting them to his work-camp
methods. And Karolyi speaks out (softly) against the pixiefication
of gymnastics.
</P>
<P>
   The minimum age for Olympic gymnasts was raised from 15 to 16
for the Sydney Games. Karolyi now favors slightly older and larger
gymnasts than he used to. This nod to maturity reduces, by a
minuscule amount, the scent of pedophilia that clings to women's
gymnastics.
</P>
<P>
   Karolyi vows to save U.S. gymnastics again. ``They can and they
will and they must be successful again,'' he announced. ``We are a
gymnastics nation.'' But he's wrong. We are not a gymnastics nation
anymore.
</P>
<P>
   Americans used to like their female athletes in makeup and
skirts: gymnasts, figure skaters, and decorous tennis players. But
the women's sports explosion has changed that. Girls once wanted to
be Mary Lou. Now they worship Mia Hamm, Chamique Holdsclaw and
Venus Williams. Our favorite female athletes are big, tough
bullies.
</P>
<P>
   Bela may have mellowed, but he still expects us to watch
half-pint girls. We want to see women.

   NBC specializes in adulterating hard-core Olympic sports into
treacly mush, so when the U.S. women's gymnastics team competes in
Sydney, Australia, next month, the network will undoubtedly torture
viewers with endless images of Bela Karolyi bearhugging his
teensy-weensy acolytes.
</P>
<P>
   These Karolyi squeezes _ at once heartwarming and creepy _ have
become the money shot of the Summer Olympics. In 1984, Mary Lou
Retton became America's darling when Karolyi leapt a barrier to
snuggle her. In 1996, Karolyi assured the immortality of the
``Magnificent Seven'' women's team when he told Kerri Strug to
vault on a gimpy leg, then scooped her up and carried her to the
podium to collect her gold medal.
</P>
<P>

&HT;     MARINE OFFICIAL CALLS LATEST TAILHOOK INCIDENT `ISOLATED' 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By ERIC ROSENBERG  
 &HT;     c.2000 Hearst Newspapers  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Gen. Terrence R. Dake, the No. 2 Marine Corps
official, said Wednesday that the reported sexual harassment at a
recent Tailhook Association convention was isolated and not like
the Tailhook gathering of 1991 in which 140 officers sexually
assaulted 83 women.
</P>
<P>
   The Navy said last week that it was investigating a complaint by
a civilian couple that at least one servicemember staying at a
Sparks, Nev., hotel ``inappropriately'' touched the wife as she was
making her way though a hallway and that several servicemen made
``inappropriate comments,'' according to Lt. Com. Cate Mueller, a
Navy spokeswoman. Mueller added that the investigation would
determine to which military service the alleged offenders belonged.
</P>
<P>
   The incidents are alleged to have taken place during the Aug.
17-20 Tailhook convention at the hotel.
</P>
<P>
   The San Diego-based Tailhook Association, named for the hook on
the rear of many Navy and Marine Corps aircraft that allow them to
land on a carrier, is a private organization that represents
aviators. The Navy suspended its relationship with the group
following the 1991 episode and only restored a connection this
year.
</P>
<P>
   Dake said the allegations arising out of the recent convention
are ``troubling'' especially given that the Navy and Marines
``fought so hard'' to renew the relationship with the association.
</P>
<P>
   But, said Dake, ``my sensing is that what we are seeing is not
as widespread as the previous Tailhook 1991.''
</P>
<P>
   Dake, the assistant commandant of the Marine Corps, defended the
renewed relationship. The group ``has a lot to offer if in fact it
can police itself and can maintain its dignity as an organization
that should be (used for) an exchange of professional ideas.
There's great merit to having that type of organization.''
</P>
<P>
   He added, however, that ``Tailhook has to deserve the Navy's
support.''
</P>
<P>
   Dake, a pilot, previously served as the deputy chief of staff
for Marine Corps aviation and inspector general of the Marines.
</P>
<P>
   In the aftermath of the 1991 convention, the Tailhook group was
criticized for letting the event get out of hand at after-hours
parties where alcohol flowed freely and Navy and Marine pilots got
drunk.
</P>
<P>
   The 1991 convention shook the Navy to its roots and led to
resignations of the Navy Secretary and chief of naval operations.
It also generated questions about the service's ability to
investigate itself.
</P>
<P>
   The service was criticized for belatedly beginning an
investigation into charges of sexual harassment and abuse made by
several female Navy personnel. The Navy's probe found little or no
culpability.
</P>
<P>
   Dake acknowledged that all eyes will be on the service's
investigative process, but he added that the Navy and Marines have
learned from its mistakes. This time he said that he had ``every
expectation'' that the Navy investigation would be thorough and
timely.

<P>
   There was a time, not long ago, when football and computers had
as much to do with each other as touchdowns and home runs.
</P>
<P>
   But the two are merging this weekend in the first live Webcast
of a major college football game _ between the No. 1 University of
Nebraska Cornhuskers and the unranked and unsung Spartans of San
Jose State University.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a great opportunity to bring the game to people who
otherwise couldn't watch it unless they were in the stadium,'' said
Danny Greenberg, senior vice president of FoxSports.com, which is
working with the University of Nebraska to provide the Webcast of
the game that will be played Saturday at Memorial Stadium in
Lincoln.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the popularity of the Cornhuskers, the game is not being
televised. ``That probably has more to do with how they feel the
game might turn out than the size of one of the schools,'' said
Chris Anderson, sports information director at the University of
Nebraska. ``We had been wanting to try this, and it was a unique
opportunity to do it with the first game at home.''
</P>
<P>
   The Webcast will be available free, but it is recommended that
potential viewers log on ahead of time to register and to download
necessary programs, like RealPlayer. In conjunction with
FoxSports.com, the University of Nebraska will be providing the
game to Internet users at Huskers.com by using four cameras inside
the stadium.
</P>
<P>
   FoxSports.com has produced five Webcasts of high school all-star
football games this summer, and high school basketball games last
season. Although audio broadcasts of college and professional
sports are common on the Web, this is the first Division I college
football game to be broadcast online with streaming video and
audio.
</P>
<P>
   ``Given that San Jose is in the heart of Silicon Valley, it
seems appropriate to be part of something new, to be a pioneer in
this particular venture,'' said Lawrence Fan, sports information
director at San Jose State. The university will also provide a link
from its site, www.sjsuspartans.com.
</P>
<P>
   The University of Nebraska has had audio play-by-play of its
football games on the Internet for years. ``We found we have a huge
following on the Internet already,'' Anderson said. ``In other
nontelevised games we've had more than half a million people from
20 countries listening.''
</P>
<P>
   In addition to the video and play-by-play commentary, the site
will provide real-time game statistics, chats and live polling, as
well as a pregame show. Yet given the quality of streaming video,
television broadcasts will probably remain the favorite for some
time.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is an experiment,'' Greenberg said. ``It's not meant to
be what you see on your TV.'' He said viewers using a typical modem
speed of about 56k would see jerky or jumpy movements, but that a
higher speed connection would provide an experience closer to that
of television.
</P>
<P>
   One difference with the Webcast is the starting time of the
game, which was moved to 11:30 a.m. CST so as not to conflict with
televised broadcasts of other Big 12 games _ and with the opening
of the Nebraska State Fair.

   To the Tape for Confessions
</P>
<P>
   Early last week Court TV announced it would begin showing a new
series featuring the videotaped confessions of murderers, rapists
and other offenders.
</P>
<P>
   The program, Court TV executives said, would feature segments
from the confessions _ recorded by district attorneys and the
police during the course of criminal investigations _ accompanied
by crime scene photographs and eerie video of the locations where
the incidents had taken place.
</P>
<P>
   It will run for half an hour and have neither a host nor a legal
analyst, the executives said, adding that those looking for further
explanation and interpretation of the confessions could find some
on the Court TV Web site (www.courttv.com). ``Confessions'' is to
have its debut on Sunday night, Sept. 10, at 10.
</P>
<P>
   By producing such a program, executives said, they knew they
were inviting controversy.
</P>
<P>
   But it seems Court TV may have gotten more than it bargained
for. In the days after the announcement, the network was heavily
criticized throughout the media, with many saying it was
inappropriate to show criminals' confessions as entertainment.
</P>
<P>
   Disputing Court TV's argument that the series was intended to
give the public a better idea of how the criminal justice system
works, critics said it could not successfully do so without
offering its viewers analysis or explanation.
</P>
<P>
   Los Angeles City Councilman Nate Holden demanded that Court TV
not show the program, warning that it could spur copycat crimes.
The New York Times, in an editorial, referred to it as ``a rank
appeal to prurience and the thrill of violence, motivated by the
network's desire for an audience-grabbing hit.''
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, Court TV announced it would make a concession to its
critics.
</P>
<P>
   Henry Schleiff, the Court TV chairman, said the series premiere
would be followed by a half-hour panel discussion about the
confessions, featuring experts in crime and psychology. It is
possible there will be similar panel discussions following
subsequent episodes, but that, Schleiff said, will be determined
later.
</P>
<P>
   Schleiff said that when it makes its actual debut, the program
could also have further explanation of the various cases that would
run somewhere on the screen while the confessions are playing.
</P>
<P>
   In the pilot episode the confessions are introduced with tersely
worded introductions detailing the charges and followed with terse
conclusions describing the outcomes.
</P>
<P>
   ``The most important thing here is that Court TV prides itself
on being responsible,'' Schleiff said. ``And where there is valid
concern, I think, we're responding to that in a responsible way.''
</P>
<P>
   Nancy Ruhe-Munch, executive director of the National
Organization of Parents of Murdered Children, said the announced
changes did not satisfy her.
</P>
<P>
   ``The only thing that would appease me is not to air these
confessions,'' she said. ``How much pain do they think family
members need to go through?''
</P>
<P>
   Stephen Gillers, a law professor at New York University who
specializes in legal ethics and had described the program as
voyeuristic, said he thought the changes could improve it,
depending on how they are done.
</P>
<P>
   ``If it is just a veneer, it is not enough,'' he said. ``If it
is a real effort to deal with the legal issues, then I think it
could be valuable.''

   `Oz' Steps In
</P>
<P>
   When David Chase decided to delay the new season of ``The
Sopranos'' to March instead of January, HBO was faced with a hole
on its Sunday night lineup. Coincidentally, Tom Fontana, the
creator of HBO's other high-rated drama, ``Oz,'' had been told by
his production studio in Manhattan that, as he put it, ``They were
kicking us out.'' Fontana's elaborate prison set for ``Oz'' takes
up 60,000 square feet and only had a year-by-year lease.
</P>
<P>
   ``They got an offer for a 10-year lease from New York 1,''
Fontana said, ``Which, ironically enough, is a Time Warner sister
entity.''
</P>
<P>
   Faced with the loss of his space, Fontana asked whether HBO
wanted him to produce his next eight episodes of ``Oz'' early.
Chris Albrecht, the president of original programming for HBO,
responded immediately, saying that the network had that hole in its
January schedule coming up, and that ``Oz'' would fit in nicely.
</P>
<P>
   So Fontana kept his show in production and this week will finish
shooting the eight new episodes of ``Oz'' that will begin in
January. The series had previously played only in the summer. The
January season will also reflect the growing respect the show is
enjoying by including appearances by guest stars like Luke Perry,
Roger Rees, Ally Sheedy and Betty Buckley.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile HBO is also shooting a pilot for a dark comedy from
Alan Ball, writer of ``American Beauty.'' This one, called ``Six
Feet Under,'' is about the funeral business.

   `Arliss' Unsure
</P>
<P>
   The only HBO series apparently unsure of its future is
``Arliss,'' the five-year-old comedy about a sports agent. Robert
Wuhl, who produces, stars in and writes for the show, is also its
unrelenting advocate. On at least two earlier occasions he lobbied
hard to keep the show alive and succeeded.
</P>
<P>
   Now, having been paired with the ultra-hot ``Sex and the City,''
``Arliss'' has seen its ratings improve about 7 percent for the
season that just ended. Wuhl said in a telephone interview that HBO
had ordered him to write six more scripts. ``It may be because of
the possible strike'' of actors and writers, Wuhl said. ``This is a
way to get us started early.'' But whatever the reason, he is eager
to keep his show going.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we bring a new audience after `Sex and the City,''' he
said, `though we've been keeping more and more of their viewers.''
</P>
<P>
   An HBO spokesman said that ``Six Feet Under,'' if it becomes a
series, may get a shot at filling the half-hour behind ``Sex and
the City,'' which may have some impact on the future of ``Arliss.''
But Albrecht has said he would like to keep expanding the number of
series on HBO, which may mean more seasons for all the current
entries.

   Nickelodeon Shifts
</P>
<P>
   For the first time in 10 years, Nickelodeon, the top-rated
network on basic cable, is changing its look. Starting in early
September, executives said Wednesday, they will introduce new
promotional spots and graphics for its children's programming. They
said the spots would be less erratic and more uniform than they are
currently.
</P>
<P>
   The promotional spots will feature variations of the Nickelodeon
logo, quick shots of characters from the show in progress and the
children's voices alerting the audience to stay put during the
commercial breaks or that a show is returning from commercial
break.
</P>
<P>
   The change is notable because the network's brightly colored
graphics and overall lively appearance _ established through
promotions as much as programming _ have been considered a vital
ingredient to its success.
</P>
<P>
   They were devised to make children feel that Nickelodeon is
their home base on television.
</P>
<P>
   But Nickelodeon has in some respects become a victim of its own
success, inspiring others, like Walt Disney Co., Fox and Turner
Broadcasting to form their own channels with similar approaches to
Nickelodeon's.
</P>
<P>
   Cyma Zarghami, Nickelodeon's executive vice president and
general manager, said it was with that in mind that she and her
fellow executives had decided to devise the changes. ``There are a
lot of players in our game right now, and there are a lot of
copycats,'' she said. ``While everybody has gotten to look a lot
like we look, we're changing our look.''
</P>

<P>
   More `Band'
</P>
<P>
   ABC announced that it will order a second season for a show once
thought irretrievably dead: `Making the Band.'' The network ordered
13 more episodes Wednesday and may have it available for
mid-season.
</P>
<P>
   While it has never exploded in the ratings, the series, about
the development of a boy band, has attracted something of a cult
following. It also fits the genre of reality programming, which
means it would not be affected by a strike of actors and writers.

   Hip `Nightline'
</P>
<P>
   ABC's ``Nightline'' is venturing into uncharted territory.
</P>
<P>
   Next Wednesday it begins a three-part series on the rap music
industry, a decidedly young and hip topic for the late-night news
program. Robert Krulwich, an ABC News correspondent on the series,
said one hope was that it would lure younger people, who tend to
watch less news than their elders.
</P>
<P>
   But, he said, he thought it was an important topic that has been
somewhat neglected by major news organizations in general.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a culture that has remained somewhat under the
radar,'' he said. ``You hear the noise of it. You smell the
violence of it, and that's pretty much all you notice _ other than
the fact that kids are spending long, long periods of time in their
rooms listening to it.''

WHAT DO ORTHODOX JEWS THINK ABOUT ABORTION AND WHY? 
</HEADLINE>
  (Slate commentary)  
<TEXT>

online magazine of politics and culture, is available from the New

</P>
<P>
   &UR; BY JUDITH SHULEVITZ &LR;  &QL; 
 &UR; (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Many of us have heard the Jewish joke about the rabbi who is
asked to settle a dispute. After listening to one side's argument,
the rabbi declares, ``You're right!'' After listening the other
side's argument, the rabbi nods and says, ``You're right, too.''
His wife, who is listening, declares, exasperated, ``Rabbi, this is
absurd! They can't both be right!'' The rabbi sighs and replies
sadly, ``You're also right!''
</P>
<P>
   The case of Lieberman vs. Medved bears a certain kinship to the
story.
</P>
<P>
   On one side we have the Democratic vice-presidential nominee
Sen. Joseph I. Lieberman, an Orthodox Jew, who supports a woman's
right to have an abortion. He told Larry King, on his show, that
Jewish law is so deeply divided on the issue that even among
Orthodox Jews it may be construed as ``a personal matter.''
</P>
<P>
   On the other side we have conservative radio host Michael
Medved, also an Orthodox Jew, who derides Lieberman for distorting
Jewish thought. The law is clear, Medved wrote in The Wall Street
Journal: Orthodox Judaism ``sanctions abortion only when the life
of the mother is directly threatened.''
</P>
<P>
   Guess what: Lieberman and Medved are both right! They're also
both wrong. Lieberman is right to say that Orthodox Jews have
differing opinions on abortion, but wrong to create the impression
that the liberal notion of abortion on demand is among them. Jewish
law emphatically rejects that idea. Women are never allowed to
dispose of a fetus for so-called trivial reasons _ because they
can't afford to have a baby, for instance, or because there's a
chance that it may be deformed.
</P>
<P>
   So Medved is right to say that the Jewish law frowns on abortion
in general, but it's misleading of him to suggest that the rabbis
make only one exception. Indeed, this is the question they disagree
about most. The term ``threat to the mother'' is more of a
guideline than a strict principle and may be interpreted so
broadly, even by respected Orthodox rabbis, that it includes
situations in which the mother's life would not appear _ to the
non-rabbinic eye _ to be at risk.
</P>
<P>
   How can a single legal system engender such disparate
perspectives? To understand that, you have to grasp a central fact
about the Jewish legal code, which is that it's not a set of
policies. It's a compendium of debates about possible policies.
</P>
<P>
   It is commonly believed in the non-Jewish world that the Talmud
is the Jewish book of laws, but that's not quite right. The
Pentateuch, or Five Books of Moses _ that is, the first five books
of the Old Testament _ contain the 613 mitzvahs, or commandments,
by which Jews live.
</P>
<P>
   The Talmud is an anthology of abstruse and weirdly fascinating
conversations about those commandments, as well as a slew of other
biblical and extrabiblical passages that appear to the uninitiated
to have nothing to do with the principles of conduct extracted from
them.
</P>
<P>
   You cannot compare the Talmud to, say, the United States civil
code, a series of definitive propositions issuing from Congress, or
to Catholic doctrine, which comes directly from the pope. The
Talmud is more like the minutes of religious study sessions, except
that the hundreds of scholars involved in these sessions were
enrolled in a seminar that went on for more than a millennium and
touched on every conceivable aspect of life and ritual. It would be
hard to overstate the Talmud's amorphousness.
</P>
<P>
   The more closely you look at it, the harder it is to pin down.
How did the rabbis choose which verses to analyze? What's their
system of logic? The rabbis derived their rules from the sacred
narratives by means of induction and deduction and syllogism and
whimsical etymologies and literary hermeneutics, but those weren't
their only methods. They also incorporated folkloric glosses that
had been passed down orally over hundreds of years, in part to
ensure that these stray ideas got written down.
</P>
<P>
   And then they argued ceaselessly among themselves about which
interpretation was right.
</P>
<P>
   If all this doesn't make coming to clear-cut conclusions taxing
enough, consider that Jewish law also comprises dozens of
commentaries on the Talmud and thousands of individual rabbinic
responses, their opinions expanding on or refuting previous
opinions.
</P>
<P>
   In the case of irreconcilable differences, which are legion,
there is no court of appeal other than God, and his views, of
course, will never be known. In other words, the Jewish legal
system is an ongoing give-and-take between rabbis who see
everything as up for discussion and nothing as settled once and for
all.
</P>
<P>
   Don't think, though, that just because Jewish law lacks
agreed-upon sources or an ultimate authority that means the rabbis
welcome change. On the contrary, the difficulty of participating in
the debate sets the bar for advancing it extremely high. A rabbi
who can convince others that he's right on some key point is
awarded the title of ``posek,'' or ``decisor.''
</P>
<P>
   So while the Jewish position on abortion is better described as
a set of finely nuanced positions arrayed between two extremes,
they are more or less the same extremes that have dominated the
discussion for the past two millenniums.
</P>
<P>
   Here are the outer limits of the Jewish positions on abortion:
</P>
<P>
   1) Unlike in Catholicism, in Judaism the fetus isn't a legal
person until it's born, so abortion can't be murder. (This isn't
even as different from Catholicism as it seems. The Catholic Church
itself didn't insist that life began at conception until 1869.
Before that, the Church tolerated abortions through the 40th day of
pregnancy.)
</P>
<P>
   2) The fetus, although perhaps not a legal person, is a
potential one with a limited number of legal rights (such as the
ability to inherit property in certain cases), so abortion is like
murder, even if it isn't exactly the same thing.
</P>
<P>
   Naturally, depending on where you're disposed to end up on the
abortion question, you'll start with a different biblical text. If
you're basically willing to tolerate the practice, you'll cite a
passage in Exodus (Ex. 21:22) in which two men fight and one of
them accidentally hits a pregnant woman in the belly, causing her
to miscarry. If she is not harmed in any other way, the Bible says,
then the man who struck her has to pay her husband damages.
</P>
<P>
   From this one can deduce that feticide isn't murder, because the
penalty for murder is death. Rather, removing a fetus is said to be
like amputating a limb _ which a woman is still not allowed to do
for mere economic or cosmetic reasons, since that would be
self-mutilation, which is forbidden.
</P>
<P>
   If you sternly oppose abortion, you'll point to Genesis 9:6.
This verse is more of a stretch, but by Talmudic standards, it
works. It reads: ``He who sheds the blood of man through man (that
is, through a human court of law), shall his blood be shed.''
</P>
<P>
   In Biblical Hebrew, ``through'' can also be ``in,'' so one
Roman-era rabbi who was probably disgusted by his country's
occupiers' practice of experimenting on fetuses re-interpreted the
phrase as saying, ``He who sheds the blood of man in man (that is,
kills a fetus), shall his blood be shed.'' That made abortion a
capital crime, but for reasons too complicated to get into here,
one whose penalty can only be imposed by God, not man.
</P>
<P>
   Since the rabbis all but abolished the death penalty by making
it impossible to enact, saying a crime was capital didn't have much
effect anyway.
</P>
<P>
   The one thing everybody agrees about, whether abortion resembles
murder or not, is that in the case of a threat to the mother's
life, Jewish law requires you to save her rather than the fetus.
Catholics save the fetus, on the grounds that the mother bas been
baptized and will go to heaven, whereas the fetus has not and is
damned to everlasting hell. Jews don't worry as much about the
afterlife.
</P>
<P>
   Opinions diverge again, however, over how elastic to make this
notion of threat. Rabbis who think abortion is like murder believe
that only imminent physical or psychological danger _ such as a
suicide threat accompanied by clear signs of psychosis and a
psychiatrist's evaluation _ constitute sufficient grounds for an
abortion, because then you can argue that the woman does it in
self-defense.
</P>
<P>
   Rabbis who think abortion is like cutting off a leg will permit
abortion in cases of less physical threat to the woman. When the
justification is psychological, they'll accept that mere anguish
might be reason enough to warrant the procedure, rather than
require her to show that she is insane. Having been raped might be
one such cause for distress; the prospect of raising a seriously
deformed child might be another.
</P>
<P>
   Rabbis also offer a dizzying menu of views about how early or
late into a pregnancy the procedure can be performed, ranging from
only up to 40 days after conception to up to the beginning of the
third term. If the birthing process seems likely to be fatal for
the mother, you can remove the fetus at the very last moment _
until the head crowns, at which point the fetus becomes a person
with a soul and a full legal identity.
</P>
<P>
   These debates derive from different verses than the ones cited
above. In one such verse, the fetus is deemed to be little more
than water until quickening (in the ancient world, 40 days after
insemination).
</P>
<P>
   Lieberman and Medved are both fully aware of the complex
shadings of Jewish law, so why do they give such partial accounts
of its views on abortion? Setting aside the fact that you'd have to
be a master aphorist to communicate Talmudic reasoning in a sound
bite or op-ed, each man has little interest in having the whole
truth be known.
</P>
<P>
   Lieberman doesn't want to be seen to be failing to act on
Orthodox Jewish values as he advances the Democratic Party line,
even though most members of the American public would probably be
willing to grant him the right to espouse two points of view _ a
privately held religious view and a view about what would be best
for the country. That's how the Catholic Mario Cuomo used to
explain his support for abortion, for example.
</P>
<P>
   Lieberman could also argue that while Jewish law doesn't leave
it up to a woman to decide whether to abort her pregnancy, that
decision is left to her rabbi, so a national policy of abortion on
demand actually grants rabbis the greatest possible scope for the
exercise of their authority. Politically, that is not an entirely
satisfying position, since it suggests one standard for Jews and
another standard for everybody else.
</P>
<P>
   Medved's reasons for representing the Jewish stance on abortion
as more negative than it might otherwise seem are, in all
likelihood, twofold. Medved _ who sometimes substitutes for Rush
Limbaugh on his radio show _ is as ardent a Republican as Lieberman
is a Democrat, and like Lieberman, Medved is trying to repackage
Jewish thought as consistent with his party's line. But his comment
also reflects a sociological fact about Judaism. Over the past
half-century, and particularly in the past two decades, Orthodox
Judaism has moved noticeably to the right.
</P>
<P>
   Up until 50 years ago, the Genesis passage and the strong
anti-abortion position were invoked relatively rarely. In a
post-Holocaust world, however, some Orthodox Jews have considered
it an implicit imperative to repopulate their ranks and have begun
to have extremely large families. There is a powerful social
presumption against abortion, and the Genesis verse has become a
more common starting point for discussion.
</P>
<P>
   A few leading ultra-Orthodox rabbis have even taken to
dismissing the Exodus argument as irrelevant, since it deals with
damages, not abortion per se. To them, abortion is murder,
permissible only in extreme self-defense. With that, these rabbis
have ruled out of order a strain of thought valid for more than a
millennium. This may be why Medved feels he can represent a
hard-line opposition to abortion except in cases of dire threat to
the mother as the Orthodox Jewish position.
</P>
<P>
   Lieberman, on the other hand, adheres to the most liberal and
outward-looking branch of orthodoxy, Modern Orthodox Judaism, and
is therefore more likely to see the law as a spectrum of opinions,
rather than a definitive pronouncement.

&HT;     SCIENTISTS SAY ACID RAIN, BUDGET CUTS POSE GROWING MENACE TO
LAKES

<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. _ For years, the invisible menace of acid rain has
been slowly destroying life in the once-pristine lakes of the
Adirondack Park.
</P>
<P>
   Researchers say 500 of the roughly 2,800 lakes scattered
throughout the New York's 6-million-acre park show few signs of
animal or plant life. And unless conditions change _ mainly by
diminishing air pollution generated by power plants hundreds of
miles south and west of the mountains _ half of the Adirondack
lakes could be dead 40 years from now.
</P>
<P>
   ``The acid rain problem is worse in the Adirondacks than any
other place in the country,'' said Charles Driscoll, a professor of
environmental engineering at Syracuse University, who has studied
acid rain throughout the Northeast since the 1970s.
</P>
<P>
   The outlook is not bright.
</P>
<P>
   ``At current emission levels the recovery process will be very
slow. There will be minimal improvement to no improvement in water
quality,'' said Greg Lawrence, a research scientist with the U.S.
Geological Survey.
</P>
<P>
   But decades after acid rain was first identified by scientists,
the state has actually cut funding to measure the destructiveness
of acid rain. The state Department of Environmental Conservation
(DEC), charged with carrying out the policies of Gov. George Pataki
_ a Republican who boasts of his record on the environment _ lacks
a coordinated strategy to deal with the issue.
</P>
<P>
   To be sure, New York has taken major strides to clean up the air
in the last few years _ fighting in court, in the state Legislature
and in Congress to force plants to reduce pollutants.
</P>
<P>
   But even as the state is gearing up to take on polluting
industries, critics say New York lacks the evidence it needs to win
political battles because the state does not spend enough to study
lake water quality. Only $550,000 has been spent over the last
three years.
</P>
<P>
   That wasn't always so. In the mid-1980s, the state and the
utility industry joined to create the Adirondack Lakes Survey
Corp., which analyzed the impact of acid rain on 1,469 Adirondack
lakes. The definitive study was a wake-up call for many who had
believed the Adirondacks were immune to pollution. It found that
almost one-fourth of the lakes were critically acidified.
</P>
<P>
   But the study was only a snapshot. Since then, the state has not
funded a comprehensive lake study in the Adirondacks, and the state
environmental agency has cut both money and manpower for long-term
water quality monitoring. Federal funding has also been reduced.
</P>
<P>
   ``If it was up to the state Department of Environmental
Conservation, we would not be involved in any monitoring work,''
said James Sutherland, a research scientist with the DEC's Division
of Water, who is studying Adirondack lakes with $1.4 million in aid
from the federal government. ``The minuscule amount of funding
available statewide for analysis would give anyone on the outside
the impression that the agency has no interest in water quality
monitoring in lakes and ponds.''
</P>
<P>
   Carl Johnson, deputy commissioner of the DEC's Air and Waste
Management Division, said the 52 lakes the agency has focused on
since 1992 are enough to gather the information needed on acid
rain.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sampling more lakes is only going to tell us more of what we
already know,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Scientists have unearthed a lot about acid rain's causes and
effects since it was first described in a scientific journal in
1972. Over time, lakes fill with millions of tiny raindrops loaded
with acid generated when air pollution and water mix in clouds. The
small creatures that spend their lives afloat in the water or
submerged in the mud die first, unable to withstand the acidic
conditions. Then death spreads upward to the predators of the lake,
the fish.
</P>
<P>
   ``Anything that impacts the bottom of the food chain echoes to
everything else,'' said Larry Eichler, a research scientist with
the Darrin Fresh Water Institute at Rensselaer Polytechnic
Institute in Troy. Eichler has worked since 1992 on 30 Adirondack
lakes as part of the federally financed Adirondack Effects
Assessment Program.
</P>
<P>
   Only in the last eight years have scientists begun to piece
together acid rain's myriad impacts on the environment, a game of
catch-up that even has the state's own scientists disheartened.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was more state money involved directly in the program in
the past,'' said Walt Kretser, director of the Adirondack Lakes
Survey, which continues to monitor 52 lakes on the $500,000 that
the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency and in-state power
companies provided this year.
</P>
<P>
   Environmentalists studying the information collected by Kretser
and others say that while it is valuable, more data collected over
time are needed to back up the state's push for a solution.

WHAT DO ORTHODOX JEWS THINK ABOUT ABORTION AND WHY?

</P>
<P>
   &UR; BY JUDITH SHULEVITZ &LR;  &QL; 
 &UR; (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Many of us have heard the Jewish joke about the rabbi who is
asked to settle a dispute. After listening to one side's argument,
the rabbi declares, ``You're right!'' After listening the other
side's argument, the rabbi nods and says, ``You're right, too.''
His wife, who is listening, declares, exasperated, ``Rabbi, this is
absurd! They can't both be right!'' The rabbi sighs and replies
sadly, ``You're also right!''
</P>
<P>
   The case of Lieberman vs. Medved bears a certain kinship to the
story.
</P>
<P>
   On one side we have the Democratic vice-presidential nominee
Sen. Joseph I. Lieberman, an Orthodox Jew, who supports a woman's
right to have an abortion. He told Larry King, on his show, that
Jewish law is so deeply divided on the issue that even among
Orthodox Jews it may be construed as ``a personal matter.''
</P>
<P>
   On the other side we have conservative radio host Michael
Medved, also an Orthodox Jew, who derides Lieberman for distorting
Jewish thought. The law is clear, Medved wrote in The Wall Street
Journal: Orthodox Judaism ``sanctions abortion only when the life
of the mother is directly threatened.''
</P>
<P>
   Guess what: Lieberman and Medved are both right! They're also
both wrong. Lieberman is right to say that Orthodox Jews have
differing opinions on abortion, but wrong to create the impression
that the liberal notion of abortion on demand is among them. Jewish
law emphatically rejects that idea. Women are never allowed to
dispose of a fetus for so-called trivial reasons _ because they
can't afford to have a baby, for instance, or because there's a
chance that it may be deformed.
</P>
<P>
   So Medved is right to say that the Jewish law frowns on abortion
in general, but it's misleading of him to suggest that the rabbis
make only one exception. Indeed, this is the question they disagree
about most. The term ``threat to the mother'' is more of a
guideline than a strict principle and may be interpreted so
broadly, even by respected Orthodox rabbis, that it includes
situations in which the mother's life would not appear _ to the
non-rabbinic eye _ to be at risk.
</P>
<P>
   How can a single legal system engender such disparate
perspectives? To understand that, you have to grasp a central fact
about the Jewish legal code, which is that it's not a set of
policies. It's a compendium of debates about possible policies.
</P>
<P>
   It is commonly believed in the non-Jewish world that the Talmud
is the Jewish book of laws, but that's not quite right. The
Pentateuch, or Five Books of Moses _ that is, the first five books
of the Old Testament _ contain the 613 mitzvahs, or commandments,
by which Jews live.
</P>
<P>
   The Talmud is an anthology of abstruse and weirdly fascinating
conversations about those commandments, as well as a slew of other
biblical and extrabiblical passages that appear to the uninitiated
to have nothing to do with the principles of conduct extracted from
them.
</P>
<P>
   You cannot compare the Talmud to, say, the United States civil
code, a series of definitive propositions issuing from Congress, or
to Catholic doctrine, which comes directly from the pope. The
Talmud is more like the minutes of religious study sessions, except
that the hundreds of scholars involved in these sessions were
enrolled in a seminar that went on for more than a millennium and
touched on every conceivable aspect of life and ritual. It would be
hard to overstate the Talmud's amorphousness.
</P>
<P>
   The more closely you look at it, the harder it is to pin down.
How did the rabbis choose which verses to analyze? What's their
system of logic? The rabbis derived their rules from the sacred
narratives by means of induction and deduction and syllogism and
whimsical etymologies and literary hermeneutics, but those weren't
their only methods. They also incorporated folkloric glosses that
had been passed down orally over hundreds of years, in part to
ensure that these stray ideas got written down.
</P>
<P>
   And then they argued ceaselessly among themselves about which
interpretation was right.
</P>
<P>
   If all this doesn't make coming to clear-cut conclusions taxing
enough, consider that Jewish law also comprises dozens of
commentaries on the Talmud and thousands of individual rabbinic
responses, their opinions expanding on or refuting previous
opinions.
</P>
<P>
   In the case of irreconcilable differences, which are legion,
there is no court of appeal other than God, and his views, of
course, will never be known. In other words, the Jewish legal
system is an ongoing give-and-take between rabbis who see
everything as up for discussion and nothing as settled once and for
all.
</P>
<P>
   Don't think, though, that just because Jewish law lacks
agreed-upon sources or an ultimate authority that means the rabbis
welcome change. On the contrary, the difficulty of participating in
the debate sets the bar for advancing it extremely high. A rabbi
who can convince others that he's right on some key point is
awarded the title of ``posek,'' or ``decisor.''
</P>
<P>
   So while the Jewish position on abortion is better described as
a set of finely nuanced positions arrayed between two extremes,
they are more or less the same extremes that have dominated the
discussion for the past two millenniums.
</P>
<P>
   Here are the outer limits of the Jewish positions on abortion:
</P>
<P>
   1) Unlike in Catholicism, in Judaism the fetus isn't a legal
person until it's born, so abortion can't be murder. (This isn't
even as different from Catholicism as it seems. The Catholic Church
itself didn't insist that life began at conception until 1869.
Before that, the Church tolerated abortions through the 40th day of
pregnancy.)
</P>
<P>
   2) The fetus, although perhaps not a legal person, is a
potential one with a limited number of legal rights (such as the
ability to inherit property in certain cases), so abortion is like
murder, even if it isn't exactly the same thing.
</P>
<P>
   Naturally, depending on where you're disposed to end up on the
abortion question, you'll start with a different biblical text. If
you're basically willing to tolerate the practice, you'll cite a
passage in Exodus (Ex. 21:22) in which two men fight and one of
them accidentally hits a pregnant woman in the belly, causing her
to miscarry. If she is not harmed in any other way, the Bible says,
then the man who struck her has to pay her husband damages.
</P>
<P>
   From this one can deduce that feticide isn't murder, because the
penalty for murder is death. Rather, removing a fetus is said to be
like amputating a limb _ which a woman is still not allowed to do
for mere economic or cosmetic reasons, since that would be
self-mutilation, which is forbidden.
</P>
<P>
   If you sternly oppose abortion, you'll point to Genesis 9:6.
This verse is more of a stretch, but by Talmudic standards, it
works. It reads: ``He who sheds the blood of man through man (that
is, through a human court of law), shall his blood be shed.''
</P>
<P>
   In Biblical Hebrew, ``through'' can also be ``in,'' so one
Roman-era rabbi who was probably disgusted by his country's
occupiers' practice of experimenting on fetuses re-interpreted the
phrase as saying, ``He who sheds the blood of man in man (that is,
kills a fetus), shall his blood be shed.'' That made abortion a
capital crime, but for reasons too complicated to get into here,
one whose penalty can only be imposed by God, not man.
</P>
<P>
   Since the rabbis all but abolished the death penalty by making
it impossible to enact, saying a crime was capital didn't have much
effect anyway.
</P>
<P>
   The one thing everybody agrees about, whether abortion resembles
murder or not, is that in the case of a threat to the mother's
life, Jewish law requires you to save her rather than the fetus.
Catholics save the fetus, on the grounds that the mother bas been
baptized and will go to heaven, whereas the fetus has not and is
damned to everlasting hell. Jews don't worry as much about the
afterlife.
</P>
<P>
   Opinions diverge again, however, over how elastic to make this
notion of threat. Rabbis who think abortion is like murder believe
that only imminent physical or psychological danger _ such as a
suicide threat accompanied by clear signs of psychosis and a
psychiatrist's evaluation _ constitute sufficient grounds for an
abortion, because then you can argue that the woman does it in
self-defense.
</P>
<P>
   Rabbis who think abortion is like cutting off a leg will permit
abortion in cases of less physical threat to the woman. When the
justification is psychological, they'll accept that mere anguish
might be reason enough to warrant the procedure, rather than
require her to show that she is insane. Having been raped might be
one such cause for distress; the prospect of raising a seriously
deformed child might be another.
</P>
<P>
   Rabbis also offer a dizzying menu of views about how early or
late into a pregnancy the procedure can be performed, ranging from
only up to 40 days after conception to up to the beginning of the
third term. If the birthing process seems likely to be fatal for
the mother, you can remove the fetus at the very last moment _
until the head crowns, at which point the fetus becomes a person
with a soul and a full legal identity.
</P>
<P>
   These debates derive from different verses than the ones cited
above. In one such verse, the fetus is deemed to be little more
than water until quickening (in the ancient world, 40 days after
insemination).
</P>
<P>
   Lieberman and Medved are both fully aware of the complex
shadings of Jewish law, so why do they give such partial accounts
of its views on abortion? Setting aside the fact that you'd have to
be a master aphorist to communicate Talmudic reasoning in a sound
bite or op-ed, each man has little interest in having the whole
truth be known.
</P>
<P>
   Lieberman doesn't want to be seen to be failing to act on
Orthodox Jewish values as he advances the Democratic Party line,
even though most members of the American public would probably be
willing to grant him the right to espouse two points of view _ a
privately held religious view and a view about what would be best
for the country. That's how the Catholic Mario Cuomo used to
explain his support for abortion, for example.
</P>
<P>
   Lieberman could also argue that while Jewish law doesn't leave
it up to a woman to decide whether to abort her pregnancy, that
decision is left to her rabbi, so a national policy of abortion on
demand actually grants rabbis the greatest possible scope for the
exercise of their authority. Politically, that is not an entirely
satisfying position, since it suggests one standard for Jews and
another standard for everybody else.
</P>
<P>
   Medved's reasons for representing the Jewish stance on abortion
as more negative than it might otherwise seem are, in all
likelihood, twofold. Medved _ who sometimes substitutes for Rush
Limbaugh on his radio show _ is as ardent a Republican as Lieberman
is a Democrat, and like Lieberman, Medved is trying to repackage
Jewish thought as consistent with his party's line. But his comment
also reflects a sociological fact about Judaism. Over the past
half-century, and particularly in the past two decades, Orthodox
Judaism has moved noticeably to the right.
</P>
<P>
   Up until 50 years ago, the Genesis passage and the strong
anti-abortion position were invoked relatively rarely. In a
post-Holocaust world, however, some Orthodox Jews have considered
it an implicit imperative to repopulate their ranks and have begun
to have extremely large families. There is a powerful social
presumption against abortion, and the Genesis verse has become a
more common starting point for discussion.
</P>
<P>
   A few leading ultra-Orthodox rabbis have even taken to
dismissing the Exodus argument as irrelevant, since it deals with
damages, not abortion per se. To them, abortion is murder,
permissible only in extreme self-defense. With that, these rabbis
have ruled out of order a strain of thought valid for more than a
millennium. This may be why Medved feels he can represent a
hard-line opposition to abortion except in cases of dire threat to
the mother as the Orthodox Jewish position.
</P>
<P>
   Lieberman, on the other hand, adheres to the most liberal and
outward-looking branch of orthodoxy, Modern Orthodox Judaism, and
is therefore more likely to see the law as a spectrum of opinions,
rather than a definitive pronouncement.

&HT;     U.S., CANADA SHOULD CONSIDER MEXICO'S ECONOMIC PROPOSAL 
</HEADLINE>
  
 &HT;     (For release Sunday, Sept. 3)   &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients)

<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Sweeping out of Mexico like a fast-moving tropical
storm, Vicente Fox, who revolutionized politics in his homeland,
has injected some revolutionary concepts into Mexico's relationship
with the United States and Canada.
</P>
<P>
   In separate visits with leaders of his two northern neighbors,
Mexico's president-elect suggested that the two countries consider
helping Mexico expand its economy in order to create new,
well-paying jobs.
</P>
<P>
   That, he said, would deter workers from trying to leave Mexico.
At the same time, he urged a shift in American policy so that
Mexican workers coming to the United States would be viewed ``as an
opportunity, not a threat.''
</P>
<P>
   The towering (6 foot, 4 inch) former Coca Cola executive, who
will be inaugurated as president of Mexico Dec. 1, also spoke in
visionary terms about developing a closer interdependence among the
three North American allies.
</P>
<P>
   His remarkable election on July 2 as the candidate of the
center-right National Action Party marked the first time in 71
years that a candidate of the ruling Institutional Revolutionary
Party (PRI) had been defeated. Throughout Mexico, people rejoiced
over Fox's triumph.
</P>
<P>
   After meeting with Fox Aug. 24 at the White House, President
Clinton also predicted an eventual ``growing interdependence in our
hemisphere.''
</P>
<P>
   He did not commit himself on the specifics of Fox's proposal.
But Clinton, whose term ends Jan. 20, said of interdependence, ``I
think it will be the way of the world. I regret I won't be around
for a lot of it. But it is a good thing.''
</P>
<P>
   Vice President Al Gore and Texas Gov. George W. Bush, who also
met with Fox, were equally noncommittal on his proposals. But the
Republican presidential nominee, whose state has the longest border
with Mexico, said he will continue to enforce laws that protect
America's borders.
</P>
<P>
   Both presidential nominees are internationalists who can be
counted on to seek improved relations with all of Latin America,
especially Mexico, which, next to Canada, is the United States'
chief trading partner.
</P>
<P>
   Fox insists that in this global era barriers must come down
along the border.
</P>
<P>
   Before leaving Mexico to visit Washington and Ottawa, Fox said
that ``building up walls putting up arms (and) dedicating billions
of dollars to avoid migration (are) not the way to go.''
</P>
<P>
   For decades, debate over Mexican migration into the United
States has festered, and sometimes it has exploded. In 1994
California voters passed a ballot initiative, Proposition 187, that
prohibited children of illegal immigrants from going to school and
receiving most health benefits.
</P>
<P>
   The measure, supported by then Republican Gov. Pete Wilson, was
later declared unconstitutional.
</P>
<P>
   Its impact was to help diminish GOP power in a state with a huge
Hispanic population that had been dominated by Republicans for
years. The furious reaction of Latinos and Asian Americans to what
they saw as immigrant-bashing by California Republicans was a big
factor in the 1998 election of Gray Davis, the state's first
Democratic governor in 16 years.
</P>
<P>
   Too often, we in the United States have failed to look seriously
at the problems of Mexico. For too long we viewed Mexico through
the stereotypes created by Hollywood.
</P>
<P>
   Few visitors to Mexico noticed its vast areas of poverty and
deprivation. Instead, they refreshed themselves with visits to
Acapulco and Cancun, inspected magnificent Mayan ruins and enjoyed
Mexico's Ballet Folklorico.
</P>
<P>
   Every seven years, Mexico would automatically elect the
presidential candidate of the ruling PRI party. The new leader
would meet with the U.S. president and exchange pleasantries, and
the United States would pledge various forms of aid to its sister
republic.
</P>
<P>
   But poverty-stricken Mexicans continue to try in every way to
sneak into this country, which in turn spends millions of dollars
each year trying to keep them out.
</P>
<P>
   Fox's visionary proposals should neither be rejected out of hand
nor accepted without thorough study. But Mexico needs our help, and
we need to find better ways to curtail illegal immigration from
that country.
</P>
<P>
   If we are to move together into a brighter future, we cannot do
so simply by cursing illegal immigrants or building higher,
stronger fences along the border.
</P>
<P>
   There must be, as Fox and Clinton have suggested, more
enlightened ways to bolster Mexico's economy and job expansion
while at the same time reducing illegal immigration and
strengthening our own economy and culture.
</P>
<P>
   The time has come to try a new approach.

</P>
<P>
   Opponents of the new rules for government-funded stem-cell
research are right that the rules are irrational. The rules forbid
government-funded researchers to extract stem cells from human
embryos, but they allow those researchers _ on alternate Tuesdays
when the wind is from the northeast and at least three members of
five different review boards have dreamed of a fish _ to use stem
cells extracted by others.
</P>
<P>
   Opponents of stem-cell research believe that ``a microscopic
clump of cells'' (The New York Times' description of an embryo at
the stage when stem cells are removed) has the same moral claims as
a fully formed human being.
</P>
<P>
   Proponents believe that a clump of cells has no serious moral
claim compared with people who ``feel want, taste grief, need
friends'' (Shakespeare's description of a human being).
</P>
<P>
   No one believes that a clump of cells is just a clump of cells
in private hands but becomes a full human being in the hands of a
government grantee. You don't absolve yourself of murder by hiring
a hit man.
</P>
<P>
   The answer to this objection (which the authors of the
regulations cannot make) is: Of course it's not rational. It's a
compromise between two logically irreconcilable positions. And it
stretches democracy as far as it can be stretched in deference to
the strongly held views of the losing side of an argument. It says:
``You cannot have your way. You cannot impose the burden of your
views on others. But at least you can know that your own tax
dollars won't be spent directly on something you find immoral.''
</P>
<P>
   This is quite a concession. It's more than opponents of wars,
for example, are allowed.
</P>
<P>
   Even the burden of this compromise is heavy on those awaiting
the tremendous promise of stem-cell research. That promise has
already been delayed for years by the congressional ban these new
rules are designed to accommodate. The breakthroughs will be slowed
by more years because of all the elaborate safeguards built in to
protect those clumps of cells. Imagine being paralyzed by a spinal
cord injury in your teens, watching for decades as medical
treatment progresses but not quite fast enough, and knowing that it
could have been faster.
</P>
<P>
   In the endless right-to-life debate, compromise is difficult for
pro-lifers because the strength of their side of the argument comes
from its absolutism _ Unless it comes from faith, about which there
can be no argument.
</P>
<P>
   Absolutism is their logical trump card. If you don't protect
every human being from the moment of conception, where do you draw
the line? Anywhere you draw it is another irrational distinction,
conferring humanityand, possibly, life itself _ on one organism and
denying both to another that is nearly identical.
</P>
<P>
   But absolutism is also a great weakness, because it puts you at
the mercy of your own logic. Opposition to stem-cell research is
the reductio ad absurdum of the right-to-life argument. A goldfish
resembles a human being more than an embryo does. An embryo feels
nothing, thinks nothing, cannot suffer, is not aware of its own
existence.
</P>
<P>
   Embryos are destroyed routinely by the millions in the natural
process of human reproduction. Yet opponents of stem-cell research
would allow real people, who can suffer, to do so in service of the
abstract principle that embryos are people too. If faith takes you
there, fine. Reason can't.
</P>
<P>
   Ronald Reagan used to play the logical trump card this way: If
we don't know for sure when human life begins, we're like rescue
workers after a mine explosion who don't know if anyone has
survived. Shouldn't we assume there is life to be saved, rather
than assuming there isn't?
</P>
<P>
   The problem with this analogy is that the beginning of human
life is not a factual question to which we ``don't know'' the
answer. Biology is not going to solve this puzzle for us someday.
``Human life'' is a label we confer, and the uncertainty is in how
we choose to define it, not in some missing bit of information.
Furthermore, the definition depends on why you're asking.
</P>
<P>
   In the context of abortion, it doesn't matter when a fetus
develops hands or feet or a heartbeat. What matters is when it
develops a sense of self, an ability to suffer, or _ if you go that
route _ an immortal soul.
</P>
<P>
   And the fact that these conditions (except for the soul) don't
arrive at any clear-cut moment is not the logical argument for
absolutism that pro-lifers seem to think. We used to learn in
high-school biology that ``ontogeny recapitulates phylogeny'': The
development of each individual human being resembles the evolution
of the species.
</P>
<P>
   Apparently, these days that is regarded as unhelpful, if not
inaccurate. But even most right-to-lifers do believe in evolution
and are comfortable with the idea that humanity is one end of a
continuum, not a thing apart.
</P>
<P>
   They are comfortable drawing a crisper line than nature does
between humans and lesser beasts and denying human rights to
animals that share many human attributes. Why is it so hard for
them to accept something similar about the development of an
individual human being? That we each start out as something less
than human, that the transformation takes place gradually, but that
it's morally acceptable to draw a line somewhere other than at the
very beginning.
</P>
<P>
   Not just acceptable, but necessary.
</P>
<P>
   If faith tells you otherwise, listen. But don't mistake it for
the voice of reason.

MARSHALL CRENSHAW _ UNSUNG GENIUS
</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By MICHAEL D. CLARK 
c. 2000 Houston Chronicle 
Should Marshall Crenshaw stick to any of his many musical interests
for an extended period, he could probably call one of them his own.
Ironically, the prolific Brooklynite appears to prefer the life of
unsung cult genius.
<TEXT>
<P>
   At least unsung by him.
</P>
<P>
   Scroll down his songwriting credits and one finds a bevy of
other vocalists who have had success with Crenshaw's music. His
witty ``You're My Favorite Waste of Time'' has become a beloved
standard of the divine Ms. Bette Midler. Kelly Willis' 1993
self-titled debut was anchored with a mandolin treatment of
Crenshaw's ``Whatever Way the Wind Blows.''
</P>
<P>
   Most successful was the 1996 Gin Blossoms hit ``Til I Hear It
From You.'' Crenshaw co-wrote the song with the band for the
``Empire Records'' soundtrack. The resulting fervor helped make the
movie an underground curiosity.
</P>
<P>
   If Crenshaw is carrying a grudge about the lack of credit, he's
not letting on.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Gin Blossoms thing was never going to be one of mine,''
Crenshaw says by phone from the Savoy Hotel in San Francisco, where
he's resting before a recent gig. ``I do have some regrets, but
they're not killing me. I feel I have had an interesting and varied
career.''
</P>
<P>
   Varied is the perfect definition of the underground renaissance
man's two decades standing in the spotlight's shadow.
</P>
<P>
   Four years before cutting his first solo album, he tried out for
a role in ``Beatlemania'' and wound up playing John Lennon for the
West Coast tour. He portrayed his main musical influence, the
square-spectacled Buddy Holly, in the 1987 Ritchie Valens biopic
``La Bamba'' and had a walk-on role as a member of the high school
reunion band in Francis Ford Coppola's ``Peggy Sue Got Married.''
</P>
<P>
   Trading his guitar for a pen, Crenshaw wrote and compiled
critical input for ``Hollywood Rock: A Guide to Rock N' Roll in the
Movies,'' and has written liner notes for compilation albums for
artists ranging from Rick Nelson to the Louvin Brothers.
</P>
<P>
   Many people have probably heard the multi-instrumentalist's
music without even knowing it. He performed the theme song _ a
cover of Larry Williams' ``Bad Boy'' _ for the short-lived Rob
``Makin' copies!!'' Schneider sitcom, ``Men Behaving Badly,'' in
1996. Last year he composed the score for the PBS baseball-legend
documentary ``Yogi Berra: Deja Vu All Over Again.''
</P>
<P>
   Under his own name, however, Crenshaw is mainstream and pop
chart anesthesia. His early punk poetry is a cross between Holly's
rockabilly and Elvis Costello's sneering cynicism. In a career
spanning eight critically revered studio albums, the highest peak
he reached was No. 36 on the Hot 100 for ``Someday, Someway'' in
1982.
</P>
<P>
   Nothing else has come close, and maybe that's the point. Art
over the shopping cart. Through touring and his various acting
roles, Crenshaw has acquired a devoted underground audience.
</P>
<P>
   Fans who catch him in concert probably will be thrilled that a
favored wandering minstrel continues to have a voice without having
to mix and mingle with Eminem and 'N Sync.
</P>
<P>
   For that matter, so does Crenshaw.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you came to me when I was 17 and told me I would have the
career I've had, I would've felt pretty good,'' Crenshaw says. ``My
ego is very resilient. I refused to be crushed.''
</P>
<P>
   Rhino Records is also refusing to let Crenshaw be crushed _ or
forgotten. Earlier this month the label remastered, refined and
reissued his self-titled debut album. The new incarnation adds nine
songs to the set, including original B-sides, previously unreleased
tracks and a couple of covers, such as the Motown classic ``Stop
Her on Sight (S.O.S.).''
</P>
<P>
   Rhino simultaneously released the first-ever Crenshaw anthology,
``The Best of Marshall Crenshaw: This Is Easy!'' The 22-song
retrospective captures his reliance on shuffling early-rock licks
in ``There She Goes Again'' and ``Someday, Someway'' to the more
plodding and sullen ``I'm Sorry (But So Is Brenda Lee).''
</P>
<P>
   ``This Is Easy!'' draws to a close with a much more mature and
complex Crenshaw remaking John Hiatt's ``Someplace Where You Can't
Love Me'' and the deep melancholy of 1996's (the set's most recent
entry) ``What Do You Dream Of?''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's cool, and it's novel. The track list wasn't my final say,
but I was definitely consulted,'' Crenshaw says of ``This Is
Easy!'' ``I'm very self-critical, and there are two or three songs
I would have personally left off. I'm not going to tell you which
ones, though.''
</P>
<P>
   The idea to reissue the songs was the brainchild of a Rhino
senior vice president, Gary Stewart, one of many in the music
industry who describes himself as a ``Marshall maniac.'' According
to Stewart, there has been talk of reissuing Crenshaw's other
mid-'80s out-of-print records, ``Down Town'' and ``Mary Jean and 9
Others.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think we're done with Marshall,'' says Stewart, who
had approached the anthology project as far back as five years ago
but was only able to make it happen when Rhino got access to
Crenshaw's Warner Bros. catalog in 1998. ``Rhino is kind of
treating this like the new Limp Bizkit record, and we don't often
do that.''
</P>
<P>
   All of this is in addition to Crenshaw's most recent studio
album for the New York indie label Razor &AMP; Tie, the jazz-inflected
No. 447. Beginning with the big-band swing and horns of
``Opening,'' the 45-second song snippet immediately suggests
Crenshaw has _ once again _ changed muses. ``Dime a Dozen Guy''
unearths surf rock with a stand-up bass, while ``Glad Goodbye''
finds his inner-folkie with a dobro as accompaniment.
</P>
<P>
   ``Eydie's Tune'' and ``You Said What'' are easy-groove
instrumentals that stray from Crenshaw's quick, catchy lyrics and
crushed grooves into experimental territory. It's a vibe he grabbed
sometime between the making of ``No. 447'' and the ``Yogi Berra''
score. The songs are featured on both.
</P>
<P>
   Just like most of his albums, ``No. 447'' works better as a
whole than it does cut into individual pieces. It makes the current
live set a particular challenge. How do you please an audience that
wants both the new, spacey and improvised music, as well as the
skiffle of the early hits? And how do you re-create the
multiple-layer melodies as a solo artist?
</P>
<P>
   Crenshaw chooses to let instinct and the limits of his long-term
memory make the call from night to night.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I happen to suddenly remember a song I haven't done in a
while, I play it,'' Crenshaw says tongue-in-cheek. ``On each of my
records I was pleased that I had the nerve to change the songs each
time around. It's no different live.
</P>
<P>
   ``It perfectly sums up the rest of my life.''

   NATIONAL FORECAST &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Periods of rain will linger from the Middle Atlantic coast to
the southern Appalachians on Thursday as low pressure drifts west
across the Carolinas. The steadiest rain will be near the east
slopes of the mountains from Virginia to northern Georgia, where
moist winds ascend the sloping terrain. Meanwhile, plenty of clouds
and limited sunshine will linger from southern New England to the
central Appalachians. Farther north in the Northeastern States, it
will be partly sunny and warm.
</P>
<P>
   Searing heat with little chance for rain will persist from the
southern Plains to the lower Mississippi Valley. The hot air mass
will surge temporarily into the southern Great Lakes on Thursday as
breezes from the southwest increase ahead of a cold front.
</P>
<P>
   Cool air will cover most of the Northwest and northern Plains.
Plenty of clouds and scattered showers will prevail from the Sierra
to the Rockies.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   FOCUS: POWER OF WATER
</P>
<P>
   Water in motion can be a powerful force. A cube of water
measuring just 3 feet on each side weighs more than 2,000 pounds.
On Monday, several cars were swept away by relatively shallow flash
flood waters north of Las Vegas. The majority of flood-related
deaths occur when motorists attempt to drive their cars through
flooded crossings and are carried rapidly away by swift currents.
The best rule to follow is to avoid driving through any flooded
areas, particularly in unfamiliar territory where the depth of the
water is unknown.

   SAN MATEO, Calif. _ The Winter Olympics are still two years
away, but already they're producing a tale
</P>
<P>
   of a little-known underdog winning out in a contest of Olympian
proportions.
</P>
<P>
   Organizers of the 2002 Olympic Winter Games on Wednesday picked
an upstart Internet company called LogicTier Inc. to run its Web
operations _ a huge job given that the Games' Web site is predicted
to be the most heavily trafficked of any event in history, with as
many as 20 billion hits.
</P>
<P>
   If you haven't heard of LogicTier, don't be surprised. The
company was started less than a year ago and didn't really get
rolling until April.
</P>
<P>
   Its biggest clients so far include a company that auctions
bulldozers and other heavy equipment over the Internet and an
operator of an online trivia game called Duckets.
</P>
<P>
   By comparison, the company in charge of technology for the
Olympics for the past 40 years _ and the Games' Web sites in recent
years _ is a bit better known: IBM Corp. IBM has said September's
Summer Olympics in Sydney will be its last.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the equivalent of winning the gold,'' LogicTier Chief
Executive Mary Ann Byrnes said Wednesday while on her way to an
employee party featuring former Olympic skater Dan Jansen. ``It's
huge.''
</P>
<P>
   It's also another sign that in today's technology age, companies
don't have to be behemoths to be big-time players. San Mateo,
Calif.-based LogicTier is one of hundreds of small technology
companies tucked away
</P>
<P>
   in Silicon Valley looking for a big break. Managing the Web site
and all of the Internet infrastructure for the Olympics _
everything from computers and software to the bandwidth needed to
move up-to-date scores
</P>
<P>
   and video clips _ is about as big as it gets.
</P>
<P>
   Olympic officials in Salt Lake City picked LogicTier over more
than a dozen companies in part because its executives have
experience with major Web sites ranging from USA Today's to
ESPN.com. Byrnes, one of
</P>
<P>
   Silicon Valley's more experienced female executives, ran Corsair
Communications Inc., which develops software for the wireless
industry, before joining LogicTier earlier this year. Also lending
credence to the
</P>
<P>
   company is the venerable Kleiner Perkins Caufield &AMP; Byers
venture capital firm, one of several that sunk $41 million into the
company just a week ago.
</P>
<P>
   Mitt Romney, president of the Salt Lake Organizing Committee,
declined to name other companies that were considered to run the
Games' Web operations, but said size didn't matter.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are not a lot of companies that have been around on the
Internet for more than a couple of years,'' said Romney, a former
Boston-based venture capitalist. ``And on the Internet, everybody's
small.''
</P>
<P>
   LogicTier isn't expected to see any direct revenues from the
deal with the Olympics. Technically, in fact, it's just another
sponsor, meaning it is providing its equipment and management
essentially for free. But
</P>
<P>
   the value of the resulting exposure _ and potential customers _
is incalculable.
</P>
<P>
   ``This will definitely put them in the running'' with bigger
companies in the future, said Rick Juarez, an Internet analyst with
investment banking firm Robertson Stephens Inc. ``The public is
going to hear more
</P>
<P>
   from them.''

   Olympic officials in Salt Lake City picked LogicTier over more
than a dozen companies in part because its executives have
experience with major Web sites ranging from USA Today's to
ESPN.com. Byrnes, one of
</P>

   Silicon Valley's more experienced female executives, ran Corsair
Communications Inc., which develops software for the wireless

credence to the

Boston-based venture capitalist. ``And on the Internet, everybody's
small.''
</P>
<P>
   LogicTier isn't expected to see any direct revenues from the
deal with the Olympics. Technically, in fact, it's just another
sponsor, meaning it is providing its equipment and management
essentially for free. But

is incalculable.

HOME IMPROVEMENT THAT COMES TO YOU VIA THE INTERNET 
</HEADLINE>
   By JAY ROMANO   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Economists will tell you that one hallmark of a hot economy is
an increase in the amount of money homeowners are willing to spend
on upgrading, repairing and maintaining their homes.
</P>
<P>
   What they won't tell you is how to find a good contractor.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, any homeowner who has scoured the telephone book looking
for a contractor has discovered that it is often the contractor who
gets to pick and choose customers rather than the other way around.
</P>
<P>
   A number of Internet-based services, however, have been set up
to help consumers find qualified and reliable contractors.
</P>
<P>
   ``We provide a free service to homeowners by matching them with
prescreened contractors, architects and designers in their
geographic area,'' said Sharon Land, a manager with ImproveNet, an
online contractor referral service based in Redwood City, Calif.
</P>
<P>
   Land said that the company has about 40,000 registered
contractors who have passed a stringent prequalification procedure.
</P>
<P>
   ``We screen under four criteria,'' she said, explaining that
before contractors will be accepted by ImproveNet they must have
been in business under the same name for at least three years, must
have a clean legal history (which means that the company cannot
have been on the losing end of any lawsuits brought by clients or
creditors) and a clean credit history, and must provide proof of
insurance.
</P>
<P>
   ``About half the contractors who apply fail the screening
process,'' Land said.
</P>
<P>
   Nora DePalma, a spokeswoman for ImproveNet, said the company had
registered contractors in every state who were experts in just
about every home improvement specialty. But unlike most referral
services _ which provide homeowners with lists of contractors based
on geographical factors or the type of project contemplated _
ImproveNet provides the contractors with the names of homeowners.
</P>
<P>
   ``The way we work is the homeowner describes the project by
filling out an online form,'' DePalma said, adding that a
description of the work to be performed, along with a hoped-for
start date and a range of what the customer can afford, is then
passed along to contractors in the homeowner's general vicinity.
</P>
<P>
   The service is free to homeowners, DePalma said, because the
contractors pay ImproveNet a commission for every job they get
through the company. ``They pay us between 2 and 10 percent of the
job, depending on the type of work they do,'' she said, adding that
the maximum amount a contractor is required to pay ImproveNet for
any individual job is $995.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to simply matching up homeowners with contractors,
ImproveNet also monitors the process to provide additional
assistance and follow-up. ``We assign a personal project adviser to
monitor the relationship between the homeowner and the
contractor,'' Land said, explaining that the adviser is available
to answer questions the homeowner may have and to assess the
results of the matchup when the work is done. The Internet address
of ImproveNet is www.ImproveNet.com.
</P>
<P>
   Another nationwide online contractor referral service is
Handyman Online, a company based in Beaverton, Ore. ``We just
recently referred out our 100,000th home improvement project,''
said Bruce Stahl, director of marketing for the company.
</P>
<P>
   Stahl said that Handyman Online (www.handymanonline.com) was
formed in 1997 by two former contractors.
</P>
<P>
   ``We realized that there was a real consumer need for this type
of service,'' Stahl said. ``And the service works well for the
contractors, too, because it's a more efficient way for them to
find customers.''
</P>
<P>
   Stahl explained that the 8,000 or so contractors currently
registered with Handyman Online had all been prescreened by the
company.
</P>
<P>
   ``Before we send anyone out to a customer we check to make sure
that the contractor has insurance and that he is licensed if
licensing is required in the state where he's doing business,''
Stahl said. ``We also require every contractor to provide three
references and to sit down with us for a personal interview.''
</P>
<P>
   Like ImproveNet, Handyman Online is free to customers because
contractors pay the company when they land jobs. ``Our contractors
pay us a fee of anywhere from $10 to several hundred dollars,
depending on the size and type of the job,'' Stahl said, adding
that his company also assigns a customer service representative to
each homeowner who requests a contractor.
</P>
<P>
   ``We contact the customer to make sure that a contractor has
called,'' he said. ``And then we follow up on the job until the
project is completed.''
</P>
<P>
   Other Internet sites that provide online contractor referrals
include www.nari.org, the Web site of the National Association of
the Remodeling Industry; www.ServiceMagic.com, a company that
provides consumers who submit project descriptions with up to three
qualified professionals, and www.NationalContractors.com, a company
that specializes in providing preconstruction project planning
experts for remodeling projects costing $25,000 or more.

<P>
   NEW YORK _ It isn't easy to find the Queens Botanical Garden,
unless you live on Main Street in Flushing, or down one of those
little one-way streets like Dahlia or Blossom. The 39-acre garden,
with its campy, low-slung buildings and boisterous plantings, is
tucked into the northeastern corner of Flushing Meadows-Corona
Park, cinched in by a pretzel of highways: the Grand Central
Parkway, the Van Wyck Expressway, the Long Island Expressway. One
wrong turn, and you're heading for the Whitestone Bridge, an
18-wheeler on your rear bumper. (You can always take the No. 7
train to the end of the line, and walk eight blocks.)
</P>
<P>
   This garden, which was seized by the city eight years ago when
its director and 20 members of its board were removed for misuse of
funds and negligence, is experiencing a rebirth that can only be
described as joyful. ``We want to be a botanic garden for cultural
diversity and education,'' said Susan Lacerte, the garden's
executive director. She was appointed six years ago by the board of
the Queens Botanical Garden Society, which regained control of the
garden in 1993 and has new corporate connections and a bent for
fund raising. ``There are plenty of other botanic gardens doing
scientific research,'' she continued. ``Our research is cultural
research, how people use plants around the world.''
</P>
<P>
   The Queens Botanical Garden welcomes just about anyone with a
passion: a Russian opera singer who manages the beehives, a
meteorologist in love with composting. Bird walkers. (``Baby! Baby!
Baby!'' a Chinese woman cried one morning. Her bird had flown off
its string.) And then there's tai chi, the ancient Chinese exercise
that evolved from the martial arts centuries ago, practiced here
from 7 to 9 every morning, 365 days a year.
</P>
<P>
   Just walk through the gate (no admission charge!), pass the
garden shop in a Quonset hut and the composting office in a
green-shingled trailer, and join the Happy Exercise Club ($5 for a
life membership) under the allee of grand old oaks. It's like
slipping into a quiet pond, moving arms and legs so deliberately
they seem to be pushing water.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's slow,'' said Raymond Chen, 70, as he followed the
movements of Hansong Huang, the 82-year-old master, who leaned
back, and then forward, impossibly balanced for a man his age.
``You've got to use concentration.'' As mist cleared over the
European hornbeam, hovering like a green unisphere over a sea of
giant hibiscus, men and women of all ages followed Master Huang
through 24 movements with names like Parting the Horse's Mane,
Grasping the Swallow's Tail and Clouds Roll By.
</P>
<P>
   Nearby, Korean gardeners tended their wild sesame and angelica,
a Japanese woman weeded the soybeans she had planted from seeds
sent from Kyoto, a Latino gardener picked the thick leaves of a
``Vicks'' plant (after Vicks VapoRub), started from a cutting he
spirited out of Puerto Rico in his suitcase. An African-American
man harvested leaves from his patch of collard greens, taking a
leaf here, a leaf there, so as not to destroy the whole.
</P>
<P>
   The 1990 census made it clear that Queens was the most
ethnically diverse county in the United States. Since then,
immigrants have continued to stream into the borough. A botanical
garden in such a setting must take a universal approach.
</P>
<P>
   ``The key is moving all these groups into the garden,'' said
David Quintas-Parquet, a Cuban-born, Miami-raised Verizon executive
who lives in Forest Hills and serves on the board. ``Most
mainstream institutions never make the point to reach out to these
communities. But we're saying we have to, for moral as well as
economic reasons.''
</P>
<P>
   Quintas-Parquet makes a point of coming to the garden for Latino
outreach days, where he has been known to wax poetic about the
tuberoses that grew in his mother's garden in Miami. ``They don't
look like much, but they have a fragrance I will never forget.''
</P>
<P>
   More than 2,000 people, more than half of them Asian, came to
Gardening Day in April 1997, when a local florist translated into
Chinese a lecture by David and Kasha Furman on the Chinese tree
peony, long a symbol of love and prosperity. In 1998, Gardening Day
concentrated on Hispanic traditions.
</P>
<P>
   Korean gardeners planted their national flower, the Rose of
Sharon, in a wide swath behind the Wedding Garden, booked for
ceremonies in Hindi, Hebrew, Spanish, Korean, Pakistani and
Chinese. (Garden regulars park their lawn chairs outside the gate
and offer ruthless commentary on the best, ugliest, happiest or
saddest bride.)
</P>
<P>
   When the city returned control to the Queens group, it had
operated on a deficit for five years. ``When I took over in July
1994, the garden had $38,000 in the bank,'' said Lacerte, who has a
degree in public administration and cut her teeth on finance as an
intern in City Councilman Peter F. Vallone's office. ``The garden
uses that much money in two to three weeks. I couldn't meet the
payrolls without help from the state.''
</P>
<P>
   The garden itself was a wreck. The demoralized staff had stopped
weeding. The bathrooms weren't working. There were no supplies.
``No peat moss, no paper clips,'' Lacerte said. ``They didn't even
have a Band-Aid. A public place with 300,000 visitors a year, and
no Band-Aid?''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   She hired two supervisors to energize the garden crew and
started steering the garden into the black. The board brainstormed
ways to draw the area's diverse population through the gates.
Community leaders and neighbors were invited to air their opinions,
as master planners considered how to turn this former swamp into a
cultural, and sustainable, landscape. The ambitious plan, which
could cost from $50 million to $80 million, is in its preliminary
stages, and could take 15 years to complete.
</P>
<P>
   ``We just started securing the perimeter of the garden, which is
a $3.3 million project,'' Lacerte said, adding that without a
fence, plants are too easily vandalized. ``And we want to make
water a unifying element of the garden,'' she said. ``A branch of
the Flushing River is buried under here. We want to uncover it, and
build a constructed wetlands.''
</P>
<P>
   The garden evolved out of a swamp that was filled in to build
the 1939 World's Fair, which featured a five-acre horticultural
extravaganza called ``Gardens on Parade.'' A group of Queens
residents restored the gardens in 1948 and set up the Queens
Botanical Garden Society. They were bumped from the site by the
1964 World's Fair, and moved to the northeast corner of Flushing
Meadows-Corona Park, but they took three blue atlas cedars,
survivors from 1939, with them.
</P>
<P>
   These elegant evergreens now stand rather incongruously over
Victorian bedding schemes that flaunt 12,000 tulips in spring and
ever-changing annuals circling a spiky cycad shrub. That's known as
Bernie's Bed. Nobody can remember who Bernie was, but they plant it
the way Bernie did, year after year.
</P>
<P>
   A fragrance garden, full of lilacs, clethra, viburnum, nicotiana
and many other sweet bloomers, wages a questionable battle with the
fumes of Main Street's nearby heavy traffic (master planners
suggested this garden be moved). And the old fountain _ drained
because so many homeless people bathed there _ is now full of
summer bloomers like Indian Summer rudbeckia and 10-foot-tall
purple ironweed.
</P>
<P>
   It's this very live-and-let-live theory of gardening that is so
engaging when public gardens are usually so polished and manicured.
Here, the atmosphere is as free as the admission. ``It's very
folksy,'' Lacerte said. ``It's a welcoming place.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's of the community, by the community, and we don't want to
lose that.''
</P>
<P>
   The master plan, for example, drawn up by the landscape
architects Susan Wisniewski and Jamie Crelly Purinton, urges a
return to the native plants that would work well as part of a
sustainable landscape. ``I think that's smart, but we can't be all
native,'' Lacerte said. ``I don't think that's what we're all
about.''
</P>
<P>
   But she loves the vision of returning natural water systems to
the land. ``I could see a water wall in the new administration
building,'' Lacerte said. The new greenhouse could include tanks of
fish and plants that thrive on nitrates and purify water that can
be recycled through the garden.
</P>
<P>
   And if anything, these master planners are trying to preserve,
even cultivate, the garden's zany, anything-goes atmosphere.
</P>
<P>
   ``The master planners observed we had interesting staff gardens
that should be open to the public,'' Marianne Kristoff, the
supervisor of gardens, said, leading the way through a maze of
trellises built from scrap wood, branches and twigs. (They are
open.) Here, melons are supported way off the ground, in little
hammocks made of string. Garlic chives are buried in rich compost,
to keep their stalks white and tender.
</P>
<P>
   Soaring over this global farm is a boxwood airplane, a whimsical
salute to La Guardia and Kennedy Airports' deafening jets
constantly crossing overhead. There's a train too, and a pouncing
cat, and a hand with two fingers raised in the sign language for
``I love you,'' all made by Louis Quiles, who has tended the
grounds for 15 years.
</P>
<P>
   ``You couldn't make this stuff up if you tried,'' said Kristoff,
who came here from the lavish sculpture gardens at PepsiCo's
corporate headquarters in Purchase. ``There, everything was
planned. Here, you can say, `Oh, that's a good idea,' and it
happens.''
</P>
<P>
   The statue ``Jesus and St. John in the Corn Field,'' on loan
from the Brooklyn Museum, stands in a bed of red begonias. ``I keep
saying we should grow corn'' around it, Kristoff said, but her
gardeners keep planting flowers.
</P>
<P>
   In a typical botanical garden, the suggestions from the
supervisor of gardens might well be heeded. But this is no typical
botanical garden, and there isn't really a botanical name for what
is growing here.

<TEXT>
<P>
   It used to be hard enough to keep up with all the new TV series
and schedules. But these days, you also have to keep up with the
new networks vying for your attention. And with each one offering
24/7 programming, even if you have one of those digital video
recorders that will scout out your favorite programs and record
them on a hard drive, you may no longer know what to record.
</P>
<P>
   My company, Youth Intelligence, surveyed 1,000 teens from all
around the country, asking them which channels they consider to be
the hottest new offerings.
</P>
<P>
   HBO and SHOWTIME
</P>
<P>
   From ``Sex &AMP; the City'' to ``The Sopranos,'' HBO has some of the
most talked-about TV shows, and the upcoming series ``Band of
Brothers'' (with Tom Hanks) may make the biggest splash yet.
</P>
<P>
   When Youth Intelligence asked trendsetting teens where they
thought the next ``big thing'' in TV would come from, many said
``HBO.''
</P>
<P>
   Many young people say that the big networks' hands are tied.
(``They can't do anything risky! Their advertisers would get mad,''
said a 16-year-old in New York.) As a result, they look to HBO and
Showtime to provide new, more original entertainment. And as they
become more accustomed to commercial-free and censor-free
television, they seem less averse to having to pay for these
channels.
</P>
<P>
   MTV
</P>
<P>
   While MTV went through a rough period of reduced focus, the
network is clearly on the upswing. MTV is ever-popular with Gens X
and Why, and remains the No. 1 rated cable network for 12- to
24-year-olds.
</P>
<P>
   MTV offers a good mix of programming and remains edgy, fun and
still about music. While many networks are having trouble with
comedy, ``Lyricists Lounge'' and ``The Tom Green Show'' remain
favorites.
</P>
<P>
   COMEDY CENTRAL
</P>
<P>
   Already a favorite with teens who set trends, ``Comedy Central''
is likely to become more popular with mainstream teen audiences as
well.
</P>
<P>
   One of the first to shift from fall to summer premieres, their
summer lineup combined the highly sought-after audience
participation show, ``Don't Forget Your Toothbrush'' with the
outrageous serialized comedy, ``Strip Mall,'' and the British
import, ``League of Gentlemen.'' In conjunction with the existing
hits (``The Man Show,'' ``Strangers With Candy,'' ``The Daily
Show'' and ``Win Ben Stein's Money''), Comedy Central's 2000
program schedule means we'll be laughing with them, not at them.
</P>
<P>
   E! NETWORKS
</P>
<P>
   Young people just can't seem to get enough eye candy, and E! is
willing to endlessly support their habit. They are the authorities
on entertainment news and lifestyle-related programming and
therefore a must-watch for trendsetters and anyone wanting to stay
``in the know.'' As one 23-year-old explained, ``E! is addictive! I
can watch the same fashion special or celebrity profile five times
and not get bored.''
</P>
<P>
   With the recent launch of ``Style!'' a 24-hour network devoted
to style, fashion and design from the people who brought us E!,
look for the brand to garner even more of a following. (In the
interest of full disclosure, I'm a correspondent for ``Style!,''
but, as they say, also a user!)
</P>
<P>
   DISCOVERY CHANNEL
</P>
<P>
   If your teen suddenly flips the TV channel when you walk into
the room, the good news is he may not be surreptitiously trying to
unscramble the X-rated channels. Instead, he may just be hiding his
love of learning.
</P>
<P>
   Young people tell us they love finding out new things, as long
as it's done in an engaging manner. From ``Shark Week'' to ``The
FBI Files,'' Discovery offers some of the best learning around
(although TLC _ The Learning Channel _ also gets high fives for its
``Live Surgeries.'')
</P>
<P>
   THE SUNDANCE CHANNEL
</P>
<P>
   In the wake of the growing popularity of The Sundance Film
Festival and its independent films, comes its related network. The
Sundance film channel has appeared on trendsetters' radar screens
for the last couple of years and is growing hotter even among
mainstream youth.
</P>
<P>
   With a growing following for ``indie'' films, teens are
interested in seeing movies that they may have missed in the art
houses or ones that never made it to the big screen at all.
</P>
<P>
   BBC AMERICA
</P>
<P>
   This network is the product of an alliance between the British
Broadcasting Corporation and Discovery Communications Inc.
</P>
<P>
   BBC America is known for its outlandish comedies including
``Brilliant!,'' ``The League of Gentlemen'' and ``People Like Us''
as well as its British-style shows, ``Cool Britannia'' and ``This
Life.'' You don't have to be an Anglophile to want to tune in.

   MEXICO-ZEDILLO _ MEXICO CITY _ Mexican President Ernesto Zedillo

delays and cancellations. The ads feature top executives.
``Clearly, the most effective way to deal with a crisis is full
disclosure, right up front,'' said Jeff Springston, an associate
professor of advertising and marketing at the University of
Georgia. ``The public will forgive mistakes, but they'll never
forgive a lie.'' (Leith, Atlanta Journal-Constitution)

efforts to sell phone service along with Internet access and

with the U.S. Olympic basketball team, the Miami Heat point guard
purports to be in purgatory. Free agency isn't supposed to be this
frustrating for a five-time All-Star like Timmy. Free agency is
supposed to be a time to savor, a time to be courted by NBA teams
with championship dreams, a time to ask for the moon, or at least
the monetary equivalent of what it took to send Neil Armstrong
there. Something changed for Hardaway, however, something he can't
see and won't acknowledge. He got hurt, repeatedly. He got old,
inevitably. And he became, consequently, more of a health risk than
a supernatural contract reward warrants. (George, Palm Beach Post)

   OLY-TECH _ SAN MATEO, Calif. - The winter Olympics don't start
for another two years, but already it has produced the tale of a
little-known underdog winning out in a contest of truly Olympian
proportions. Organizers of the 2002 Winter Olympics on Wednesday
selected an outfit called Logictier Inc. to handle all of its
Internet operations. If you haven't heard of Logictier, don't be
surprised. It's less than a year old and its biggest Web projects
so far include running the sites of a company that auctions
bulldozers and other heavy equipment and an online trivia game
called Duckets. Winning the Olympic contract could be huge for
little San Mateo, Calif.-based Logictier. For the past 40 years,
the company in charge of technology at the games has been an outfit
called IBM Corp. It just goes to show again that in today's
technology age, you don't have to be a behemoth to be a big-time
player. (Keefe, Austin American-Statesman)

commercials from Ford Motor Co. concerning the Firestone tire
fiasco and from United Airlines about a summer-long spate of flight
delays and cancellations. The ads feature top executives.
``Clearly, the most effective way to deal with a crisis is full
disclosure, right up front,'' said Jeff Springston, an associate
professor of advertising and marketing at the University of
Georgia. ``The public will forgive mistakes, but they'll never
forgive a lie.'' (Leith, Atlanta Journal-Constitution)

   CNN _ Rick Kaplan's departure from CNN is part of a larger
executive shake-up announced today by the Atlanta-based network.
Phil Kent, formerly chief of Turner Broadcasting's international
unit, assumes the newly created job of president and coo of CNN
News Group, while three other network insiders are being promoted.
The moves, which could make Kent the heir apparent to CNN Chairman
Tom Johnson, come as the network faces two big issues: sagging
ratings and a pending merger with AOL. (Kempner/Kloer, Atlanta

   GP-MILLS _ As expected, Georgia-Pacific has put several of its
pulp mills up for sale, including its large plant in Brunswick. At

away from the commodity side of the business in its merger with

   BELLSOUTH _ Thursday is the last day of August and BellSouth
(again) has reached a self-imposed deadline for making its request
to enter long-distance. And BellSouth (again) is not ready to make
that request. Clearly frustrated by the continued delays, BellSouth
is starting to see some real attacks on its home markets. This
month, AT&AMP;T planted its own name on MediaOne and is ramping up
efforts to sell phone service along with Internet access and
television via its upgraded cable lines. Meanwhile, SBC is in
long-distance in Texas and has signed up hundreds of thousands of
customers. Verizon, the former Bell Atlantic, has signed up more
than 1 million after receiving long distance approval in New York.
And then there's BellSouth.... (Kanell, Atlanta

   BKN-HARDAWAY _ The love of money is the root of all evil, the
scriptures say, but Tim Hardaway has his own interpretation. Love
is money, he believes, or so it is implied in the angry avalanche
of words he's pouring over reporters in Hawaii. There, in paradise
with the U.S. Olympic basketball team, the Miami Heat point guard
purports to be in purgatory. Free agency isn't supposed to be this
frustrating for a five-time All-Star like Timmy. Free agency is
supposed to be a time to savor, a time to be courted by NBA teams
with championship dreams, a time to ask for the moon, or at least
the monetary equivalent of what it took to send Neil Armstrong
there. Something changed for Hardaway, however, something he can't
see and won't acknowledge. He got hurt, repeatedly. He got old,
inevitably. And he became, consequently, more of a health risk than
a supernatural contract reward warrants. (George, Palm Beach Post)

   OLY-TECH _ SAN MATEO, Calif. - The winter Olympics don't start
for another two years, but already it has produced the tale of a
little-known underdog winning out in a contest of truly Olympian
proportions. Organizers of the 2002 Winter Olympics on Wednesday
selected an outfit called Logictier Inc. to handle all of its
Internet operations. If you haven't heard of Logictier, don't be
surprised. It's less than a year old and its biggest Web projects
so far include running the sites of a company that auctions
bulldozers and other heavy equipment and an online trivia game
called Duckets. Winning the Olympic contract could be huge for
little San Mateo, Calif.-based Logictier. For the past 40 years,
the company in charge of technology at the games has been an outfit
called IBM Corp. It just goes to show again that in today's
technology age, you don't have to be a behemoth to be a big-time
player. (Keefe, Austin American-Statesman)

NEO-NAZI YOUTHS SENTENCED IN BEATING DEATH OF IMMIGRANT 
</HEADLINE>
   By ROGER COHEN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   BERLIN _ Three young neo-Nazis were convicted of murder
Wednesday for beating an African immigrant to death, and one of
them was sentenced to life imprisonment, the heaviest punishment
under German law.
</P>
<P>
   Deliberating in a case that has become a symbol of the virulence
of anti-immigrant sentiment among many youths in the former East
Germany, Judge Albrecht Hennig said the victim, Alberto Adriano, a
39-year-old meatpacker from Mozambique, had been killed because of
the color of his skin.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was the latest in a long series of attacks to which we must
put an end,'' Hennig said. That series began on Nov. 25, 1990, when
an Angolan was killed by rightists in the eastern town of
Eberswalde, and has continued sporadically ever since, drawing
occasional national attention.
</P>
<P>
   Such attention has grown of late, with the government seemingly
awakening to the fact that neo-Nazi violence, however marginal, has
a terrible impact on Germany's image. Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder,
who is likely to visit a small memorial to Adriano this week in
Dessau, where he lived, appealed Wednesday for a mass movement
against racism.
</P>
<P>
   ``We need the engagement of civil society,'' Schroeder said in a
television interview. ``We need a repeat of what the people in the
east of our country did in the peaceful revolution of 10 years ago,
an involvement in the fight for what is right.''
</P>
<P>
   The chancellor was referring to the demonstrations that led to
the collapse of the East German state and the Berlin Wall, a time
of euphoric optimism. But a tough reality has emerged since then:
high unemployment in the east, bitterness at the western takeover
of the area, nostalgia for the security of socialism and its proud
slogans.
</P>
<P>
   Against this backdrop, rightist, anti-foreigner movements have
proved attractive to some youths in the east, despite the fact that
the overwhelming majority of immigrants in Germany live in the
west. Christian Richter, one of the convicted men, said he had
attacked Adriano ``because foreigners take our jobs.''
</P>
<P>
   Adriano was kicked and beaten in a Dessau park on June 11 and
died three days later without recovering consciousness. He was
married to a German woman and had three children, the youngest 7
months old.
</P>
<P>
   His wife, Angelika, did not appear in court Wednesday after
receiving a threatening letter now being examined by the
prosecutor's office in Dessau. Razak Minhel, the Dessau city
official responsible for foreigners, said Mrs. Adriano was ``too
scared to leave her children alone and come to court.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The court sentenced Enrico Hilprecht, 24, to life imprisonment.
Richter, 16, and Frank Miethbauer, also 16, were sentenced to nine
years of detention, one year less than the maximum sentence under
Germany's juvenile law.
</P>
<P>
   In a climate of considerable agitation over rightist violence
since a bomb in Duesseldorf last month wounded nine immigrants, the
sentences were clearly intended to send a signal that Germany has
lost patience with xenophobia and rightist nationalism.
</P>
<P>
   In the television interview, Schroeder said the police and
judiciary needed to be tougher on extremists. Some evidence has
emerged that the police in the east, who are sometimes former
police employees of the defunct communist state, are reluctant to
crack down on the rightists because of tacit sympathy for their
cause.
</P>
<P>
   In the latest incident of racist violence, prosecutors in the
northern town of Luebeck said Wednesday that they had arrested two
skinheads for wounding a 33-year-old African in an attack on
Tuesday.

MAKING MARRIAGE A POLITICAL ISSUE 
</HEADLINE>
   (Religion Commentary) 
 &HT;    
 &HT;    (Mike McManus is a syndicated columnist whose ``Ethics &AMP;
Religion'' appears in almost 100 newspapers)
 &HT;    
 &HT;    
 By MIKE McMANUS  
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
 &HT;    
 &HT;    
 &HT;    Can marriage be made a political issue? A new group, the
Alliance for Marriage, hopes so.
 &HT;    It commissioned a Wirthlin National Marriage Poll, which found a
large majority of Americans agree that the health of marriage and
families should be a top priority for political leaders in the
United Sates. Consider the data:
 &HT;    -- 64 percent of Americans say that strengthening families is a
greater national priority than increasing job opportunities;
 &HT;    -- 77 percent regard strengthening families as more important
than a cleaner environment;
 &HT;    -- 92 percent believe America can only move forward as a nation
with stronger families.
 &HT;    Interestingly, there was little difference in the opinion of
people of different political parties. For example, 67 percent of
both Republicans and independents said family issues were more
important than increasing job opportunities and 61 percent of
Democrats agreed.
 &HT;    If all of this seems obvious to you, why isn't it obvious to our
presidential candidates? What has George Bush or Al Gore or any
gubernatorial candidate proposed to do to strengthen the family?
 &HT;    So far, virtually nothing, except that Bush and Gore say they
want to reduce the marriage tax penalty that allows many cohabiting
couples to have a lower tax rate than married couples. However, the
Clinton-Gore administration vetoed a marriage tax reform bill.
 &HT;    Matt Daniels, the Alliance director, asked politicians of both
parties to heed the admonition of Sen. Pat Moynihan, described by
the Almanac of American Politics as ''the nation's best thinker
among politicians since Lincoln and its best politician since
Jefferson.'' Moynihan said, ''The principal objective of American
government at every level should be to see that children are born
into intact families and that they remain so.''
 &HT;    Interestingly, Moynihan was excoriated by blacks 35 years ago
for his report on ''The Negro Family'' which reported that 25
percent of black babies were then being born out of wedlock, and
predicted a continued family disintegration. At this week's press
conference, Rev. Walter Fauntroy, organizer of the 1963 March on
Washington by Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr., ruefully noted that
nearly 70 percent of black babies have unmarried fathers. He added
that white illegitimacy has soared from 2 percent to 25 percent.
 &HT;    Fauntroy is a Democrat who admires former vice president Hubert
Humphrey's vision: ''The moral test of government is how we treat
those at the dawn of life, the twilight of life and those in the
shadow of life _ the sick, poor and the disabled.'' He urged voters
to distinguish between those ''talk the talk but don't walk the
walk, of strengthening the family.''
 &HT;    The Alliance is a nonpartisan, racially and religiously diverse
coalition that is as concerned about the divorce and cohabitation
rates as the six-fold jump in out-of-wedlock births.
 &HT;    Skeptical reporters asked what political leaders could do to
reverse these trends.
 &HT;    Daniels said he is challenging both parties but said his reform
agenda is ''bigger than parties and more important than the
election cycle. President Kennedy set a goal to put a man on the
moon in a decade. Let's set a goal of reducing fatherlessness by a
third in this decade. It is a goal that state and federal
government leaders could call on the clergy to work together on.''
 &HT;    He also noted that some governors, such as Mike Huckbee in
Arkansas and Oklahoma's Frank Keating, were encouraging the
creation of Community Marriage Policies in which ''clergy come
together to mandate minimal premarital preparation so couples can
not go church-shopping for a quick marriage. This is a common-sense
reform which has been successful in many cities.''
 &HT;    The Wirthlin poll found that 87 percent of Americans urge
''businesses to voluntarily do more to help strengthen their
employees' marriages by offering flex-time/job sharing/home-based
work options.''
 &HT;    Three-quarters also support two other reforms. First, require
counseling by married couples with children who are considering a
divorce before the divorce is granted; second, reduce taxes for
married couples with children. And 63 percent back bigger tax
incentives for adoption.
 &HT;    One reporter asked about marriages of same-sex couples. Daniels
replied, ''This press conference is not about that at all. Every
state, even Vermont, recognizes marriage as a union of a man and a
woman.''
 &HT;    Finally, Daniels, who acknowledged his own father abandoned him
at age 2, concluded,''We believe there is a need to fund public
education campaigns to emphasize the importance of marriage. In
every society, marriage is what makes fatherhood more than a
biological event, by connecting men to the children they bring into
the world. In every culture, there is no substitute for it. We will
either have a marriage-based culture or a culture of divorce and
out-of-wedlock births.''

 &HT;    
 &HT;    
 &HT;    Can marriage be made a political issue? A new group, the
Alliance for Marriage, hopes so.
 &HT;    It commissioned a Wirthlin National Marriage Poll, which found a
large majority of Americans agree that the health of marriage and
families should be a top priority for political leaders in the
United Sates. Consider the data:
 &HT;    -- 64 percent of Americans say that strengthening families is a
greater national priority than increasing job opportunities;
 &HT;    -- 77 percent regard strengthening families as more important
than a cleaner environment;
 &HT;    -- 92 percent believe America can only move forward as a nation
with stronger families.
 &HT;    Interestingly, there was little difference in the opinion of
people of different political parties. For example, 67 percent of
both Republicans and independents said family issues were more
important than increasing job opportunities and 61 percent of
Democrats agreed.
 &HT;    If all of this seems obvious to you, why isn't it obvious to our
presidential candidates? What has George Bush or Al Gore or any
gubernatorial candidate proposed to do to strengthen the family?
 &HT;    So far, virtually nothing, except that Bush and Gore say they
want to reduce the marriage tax penalty that allows many cohabiting
couples to have a lower tax rate than married couples. However, the
Clinton-Gore administration vetoed a marriage tax reform bill.
 &HT;    Matt Daniels, the Alliance director, asked politicians of both
parties to heed the admonition of Sen. Pat Moynihan, described by
the Almanac of American Politics as ''the nation's best thinker
among politicians since Lincoln and its best politician since
Jefferson.'' Moynihan said, ''The principal objective of American
government at every level should be to see that children are born
into intact families and that they remain so.''
 &HT;    Interestingly, Moynihan was excoriated by blacks 35 years ago
for his report on ''The Negro Family'' which reported that 25
percent of black babies were then being born out of wedlock, and
predicted a continued family disintegration. At this week's press
conference, Rev. Walter Fauntroy, organizer of the 1963 March on
Washington by Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr., ruefully noted that
nearly 70 percent of black babies have unmarried fathers. He added
that white illegitimacy has soared from 2 percent to 25 percent.
 &HT;    Fauntroy is a Democrat who admires former vice president Hubert
Humphrey's vision: ''The moral test of government is how we treat
those at the dawn of life, the twilight of life and those in the
shadow of life _ the sick, poor and the disabled.'' He urged voters
to distinguish between those ''talk the talk but don't walk the
walk, of strengthening the family.''
 &HT;    The Alliance is a nonpartisan, racially and religiously diverse
coalition that is as concerned about the divorce and cohabitation
rates as the six-fold jump in out-of-wedlock births.
 &HT;    Skeptical reporters asked what political leaders could do to
reverse these trends.
 &HT;    Daniels said he is challenging both parties but said his reform
agenda is ''bigger than parties and more important than the
election cycle. President Kennedy set a goal to put a man on the
moon in a decade. Let's set a goal of reducing fatherlessness by a
third in this decade. It is a goal that state and federal
government leaders could call on the clergy to work together on.''
 &HT;    He also noted that some governors, such as Mike Huckabee in
Arkansas and Oklahoma's Frank Keating, were encouraging the
creation of Community Marriage Policies in which ''clergy come
together to mandate minimal premarital preparation so couples can
not go church-shopping for a quick marriage. This is a common-sense
reform which has been successful in many cities.''
 &HT;    The Wirthlin poll found that 87 percent of Americans urge
''businesses to voluntarily do more to help strengthen their
employees' marriages by offering flex-time/job sharing/home-based
work options.''
 &HT;    Three-quarters also support two other reforms. First, require
counseling by married couples with children who are considering a
divorce before the divorce is granted; second, reduce taxes for
married couples with children. And 63 percent back bigger tax
incentives for adoption.
 &HT;    One reporter asked about marriages of same-sex couples. Daniels
replied, ''This press conference is not about that at all. Every
state, even Vermont, recognizes marriage as a union of a man and a
woman.''
 &HT;    Finally, Daniels, who acknowledged his own father abandoned him
at age 2, concluded,''We believe there is a need to fund public
education campaigns to emphasize the importance of marriage. In
every society, marriage is what makes fatherhood more than a
biological event, by connecting men to the children they bring into
the world. In every culture, there is no substitute for it. We will
either have a marriage-based culture or a culture of divorce and
out-of-wedlock births.''

 &HT;    BellSouth-SBC wireless marriage clears Justice Department
barrier
 &HT;    By Michael E. Kanell
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA - The Justice Department has given conditional
endorsement to the plan of BellSouth and SBC to merge wireless
units, a deal that will assemble the nation's second-largest
wireless carrier.
</P>
<P>
   If Texas-based SBC and BellSouth receive final approval from the
Federal Communications Commission on Oct. 1 _ as they hope _ then
they will announce a name for the venture, which will be
headquartered in Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   ``This approval is a major step toward the launch of a
world-class national wireless company,'' said Stephen Carter, the
SBC executive named president and chief executive of the newly
formed wireless company.
</P>
<P>
   The company will start with about 18 million subscribers,
comfortably ahead of AT&AMP;T's 13 million and behind only Verizon,
which has about 26 million. SBC will be majority owner of the
venture, but the companies have pledged to split the management.
</P>
<P>
   The companies must only sell interests in four cities where they
each have investments, with one company or the other shedding its
wireless property, said the Justice Department.
</P>
<P>
   In Indianapolis, SBC will sell its interests to AT&AMP;T. In New
Orleans and Baton Rouge, La., SBC will sell its interests to Little
Rock, Ark.,-based Alltel. In Los Angeles, no decision has been made
yet as to which company will sell its interest.
</P>
<P>
   ``Today's action by the department ensures that this joint
venture will not reduce competition in these local markets,'' said
Joel I. Klein, who heads the agency's antitrust division.
</P>
<P>
   Since the companies had said they would sell overlapping
properties, Justice Department approval was expected. Still, the
agency is flush with an antitrust court victory over Microsoft
followed by its objections to WorldCom's purchase of Sprint, which
killed that deal.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't emphasize it enough _ this is a big piece,'' said
BellSouth spokesman Jeff Battcher. ``This is very good news to so
quickly get the DOJ blessing.''
</P>
<P>
   The areas covered by the SBC-BellSouth venture will include 34
states, the District of Columbia and two territories. On that turf,
the venture will have 175 million potential customers _ along with
a raft of competition.
</P>
<P>
   But SBC and BellSouth have vowed to become as national as Sprint
or AT&AMP;T, which both tout coast-to-coast reach. The companies won't
saywhether they will pick up wireless licenses in coming FCC
auctions or if they will buy struggling carriers that serve those
areas.

GALVESTON AUTHOR'S NEWEST BOOK GOES TOTHE HEART OF FRIENDSHIP 
(WITH PHOTO AND SIDEBAR)
</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By BARBARA KARKABI 
c. 2000 Houston Chronicle 
GALVESTON, Texas _ For much of her life, writer Sandy Sheehy was
terrible at making and keeping friends.
<TEXT>
<P>
   When teams were picked in high school, she was generally the
next to last choice. Even though she was on the newspaper and
literary magazine, Sheehy never really had the elusive ``best''
friend.
</P>
<P>
   While a student at Vassar College, she was so focused on meeting
guys that she ignored the many potential female friends. It wasn't
until she was in her mid-30s that Sheehy began reaching out to
other women. It took another decade before she understood what it
meant to be a good friend.
</P>
<P>
   And at her 40th birthday party, she had what might be called a
friendship wake-up call.
</P>
<P>
   ``My husband got a bunch of friends together for dinner,'' she
recalled. ``I looked around the table at the five couples, and they
were all people who really mattered to me. But they were all couple
friends. In some cases the bond was between me and the women. In
others between my husband and the guy.''
</P>
<P>
   Sheehy remembers thinking: ``I want some relationships with
women that are relationships of my own.''
</P>
<P>
   Fourteen years later, Sheehy looks back on the night as the
beginning of a journey that has enriched her life. It gave her the
idea for her second book: ``Connecting: The Enduring Power of
Female Friendship'' (William Morrow, $25) and in the process, she
said, made her a better friend.
</P>
<P>
   A former Houstonian who now lives in Galveston, Sheehy learned
that until late in the 20th century, women were asked to believe
what she calls ``two lies'': Other women aren't worth our time, and
neither is friendship. Instead, romance and family bonds were what
women should seek.
</P>
<P>
   That was especially true for women born before 1940, she found
out. Women born after 1950, who came of age in the first wave of
feminism, felt differently about female friendships. But Sheehy was
an early baby boomer _ born between 1940 and 1950 _ so she had to
figure things out for herself.
</P>
<P>
   ``I really felt like there was a lack in my life,'' Sheehy said.
``I hadn't built much time into just seeing my women friends, and I
wanted more than I had. I felt like there was an important
relationship missing, and I also suspected there was power in the
friendship of women to help us become our best selves.''
</P>
<P>
   As Sheehy began thinking about this personal issue, she wrote
about it for Self and Working Woman magazines. The stories weren't
always positive. One was on how to end a friendship without making
an enemy, and another was on how to keep money problems from
interfering with a friendship.
</P>
<P>
   Eventually it became her next book project. Her first book,
``Texas Rich,'' was published in 1990.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought, `If I'm becoming intensely interested about
something, there is this whole bulge of people who will be
interested, too,''' she said.
</P>
<P>
   But getting it published was another story. Sheehy wrote a
proposal and sent it to the man who then was her agent. He returned
it after a couple of women in his office told him that women don't
have friendships.
</P>
<P>
   She found a new agent, rewrote her proposal and got a publisher.
</P>
<P>
   Because she had been a philosophy graduate student, Sheehy said,
she loves to analyze things and figure out how they work.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wanted to look at friendship and what it does for us,'' she
said. ``I wanted to find the answers to questions like: Why do some
friendships last and others don't? What are women's main challenges
in friendship? What do we do well in friendship, and what do we
need to improve?''
</P>
<P>
   She began by talking to her own friends and researching the
database at University of Houston. Eventually, Sheehy found about
two dozen social scientists and therapists who had written about
and studied aspects of women's friendship or friendship in general.
</P>
<P>
   To conduct her own research, she made a questionnaire and
interviewed more than 200 women and girls around the country. They
ranged in ages from 8 to 90. About half were married, a quarter
were single and a quarter divorced; 13 were lesbians. Most were
middle-class, but a few were just above poverty level, and a couple
were millionaires.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was surprised by several things. First was how many people
said that a sense of humor played a big part in selecting someone
as a friend,'' Sheehy said. ``That was right up there with shared
interests.''
</P>
<P>
   Another surprise was how much the teen-age girls she talked to
had thought about their friendships.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think when I was a teen, 30-something years ago, that
we gave our friendships with other girls a lot of thought,'' she
said. ``Unless one of them blew up, and we wondered what to do. But
we didn't think: What does this bring to my life, and how does this
help me gain independence from my family?''
</P>
<P>
   When asked about ``best friends,'' Sheehy found that most women
had four to seven close friends at any given time. Then they had
good friends _ people they are in contact with less often, followed
by a layer of acquaintances.
</P>
<P>
   ``Often when someone moves who is part of your closest circle,
you will draw someone in from the next circle of friends,'' Sheehy
said. ``It doesn't mean you will lose a friendship if a woman
moves, but it may take a different form.''
</P>
<P>
   Weaving the women's stories and voices together with the
research of sociologists and therapists, Sheehy found seven stages
of female friendship: attraction, initiation, structuring, comfort,
strengthening, testing and commitment.
</P>
<P>
   ``It can take years to go through those and may stop at some
initial stage,'' she said. ``Or it could go through all of those
stages pretty much on fast-forward.''
</P>
<P>
   She also puts the friendships women make into 10 categories:
soul mates, life mates, companions in crisis, nurturers and
nurtured, playmates and work mates, allies, complementary
opposites, mentor and protege, history friends and ensemble
friends.
</P>
<P>
   As important as friendship was to all the women interviewed, it
was obvious there were different phases. From ages 8 to 12, Sheehy
found that girls had a variety of friends for different things.
They tended to have playmates and soul mates who felt and reacted
the way they did.
</P>
<P>
   For teens, 13 to 17, friendships were in groups of people who
did things together. College friendships, from 18 to 22, were made
closer by shared living experiences.
</P>
<P>
   But from ages 23 to 39, Sheehy found, women had a hard time
maintaining friendships _ often because of career moves or work and
family commitments.
</P>
<P>
   ``I talked to women who weren't married and didn't have kids and
weren't necessarily working in 80-hour-a-week jobs,'' Sheehy said.
``They still had a few friends, and they were close, but they
didn't have the sort of enriching network of friends they had
earlier.''
</P>
<P>
   The good news is that around age 40, women start acquiring more
friends, spending more time with existing pals and reconnecting
with old friends.
</P>
<P>
   ``Even if you have a supportive husband, mother or sister, you
need a friend who sees you as an individual,'' she said. ``Someone
who values you not because you are a daughter or wife, but solely
because of your individual qualities.''

   All the color for fall is not in the fabric of clothing. Many
women will choose to update their existing wardrobes or new
neutrals with bright accessories.
</P>
<P>
   Think orange _ safety orange, road-cone orange, autumnal orange,
deep rust. One of nature's most eye-popping colors also is
predicted to be one of the most popular this fall.
</P>
<P>
   In the photo, accessories with orange spice include a beaded
Etro shawl, $930; sunglasses by Alberta Ferretti, $110; orange
suede fringed jacket by Gilles Ricart City, $335; and Oscar de la
Renta couture necklace, $880. All from Pryorities, a Houston
boutique. Plaid wool Mary Jane shoes are by Kate Spade, $235 at
Saks Fifth Avenue.

   The pin on Mimi Mannix's hat said it all. ``Junk 'til you drop''
it read, which is why Mannix _ was outside the Strudel Haus in
Covington, Ky., on a Thursday afternoon painting a giant pig. Like
a multitude of less colorful people, Mannix, an Indiana
collectibles dealer, and her capacious yellow porker, a mascot long
ago rescued from the roof of a Piggly Wiggly grocery store, had
come to this musty little town across the Ohio River from
Cincinnati to shop.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm selling, I'm buying, I'm doing my pig,'' Mannix said,
dipping into a vat of pink enamel. ``I'm having fun.'' Here at the
northernmost tip of an annual event known as the 450-Mile Route 127
Corridor Sale, it was no wonder why. A banner spanning Main Street
hailed, ``Welcome to the start of the world's largest yard sale.''
On the reverse it said, ``Welcome to the end of the world's largest
yard sale.''
</P>
<P>
   Covington was the final destination if you started your journey
at the other end, 450 miles away in Gadsden, Ala. Like everything
about this multistate flea market, it was all in how you looked at
it.
</P>
<P>
   The Route 127 Corridor, as this scenically rich, economically
underprivileged stretch is called, is not lined with Heywood
Wakefield dining room sets and paved with lilac Fiesta Ware. But
for a few very busy days every August, there is good junk as far as
the eye can see. A 1966 Batman lunchbox for $50, a Shawnee
Polynesian lady head vase for $40, a Continental Kilns Bali Hai
vegetable bowl for $5, a set of Tiki spice shakers for $6, cartoon
figurines from fast-food shops for a quarter. It is as if, for one
long weekend a year, the 26th Street Flea Market extended from New
York to Toronto.
</P>
<P>
   For shoppers like my junking buddy, Chuck Hettinger, and me,
longtime collectors who live by the words ``Have Bubble Wrap, Will
Travel,'' this was a four-day odyssey like no other. Although eBay
and a plethora of guidebooks have inflated the prices of
collectibles the world over, this rural flea market has not been
completely spoiled by price-gouging dealers and pay-anything urban
aficionados.
</P>
<P>
   Trendy collectors _ the internationally known fashion designers,
interior decorators and celebrities who frequent the flea markets
of Manhattan or Pasadena, Calif. _ were not perusing Covington's
card tables. Nor were they pawing the racks at Possum Trot Antiques
in Pall Mall, Tenn., a day's drive away and one of the many antique
stores dotting the route.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, Possum Trot's Doris Doss was selling poodle-shaped
liquor decanters and lunches of country ham, candied sweet potatoes
with toasted marshmallows and slices of ``Million Dollar Pie'' to
customers who came from as far away as Canada.
</P>
<P>
   Fueled by such artery-clogging foods, we made our way along the
mostly two-lane road that snaked through Kentucky and Tennessee.
The slow-going drive continued into Georgia and Alabama. But after
shopping for 12 hours a day for three days straight, we never made
it past Chattanooga, Tenn. By then, we were just too junked out to
go any farther than an antiques mall in East Ridge, Tenn.
</P>
<P>
   Cruising past Baptist churches, double-wide trailers, green
tobacco fields and solemn graveyards, we stopped our rented minivan
every few minutes to browse through wares set out in the driveways
of private homes, along sidewalks, in high school parking lots, in
former chicken coops and on flatbed trailers parked in muddy
fields. A pickup parked on the bank of the Ohio River near the
Indiana border produced a 1950s tropical leaf-shaped dish from Hull
pottery marked $35.
</P>
<P>
   ``Will you take $20?'' I asked a man who had fashioned his
T-shirt into a hat. ``Make it $22, so my wife won't kill me,'' he
replied.
</P>
<P>
   Among the detritus of the 20th century _ from guns to gravy
boats _ we perused pressed-glass pitchers, old Louis L'Amour
paperbacks, Fire King mugs, confederate flags, hubcaps and talking
Pee-wee Herman dolls who uttered their last ``I know you are, but
what am I?'' years ago. Empty Mrs. Butterworth's bottles shared
tables with several decades' worth of Kentucky Derby glasses.
Barbie dolls in hand-crocheted Southern belle dresses stood next to
an unopened box of ``Mork and Mindy'' trading cards from the 1970s.
Baby clothes cried out for a new generation of wearers.
</P>
<P>
   There were some real finds on our trip _ a $10 box of Eva Zeisel
Town and Country dishware that might fetch $500 on eBay, for
instance. But a lot was the kind of stuff Housing Works would
reject as too cruddy to sell in its New York City thrift shops.
Still, the pleasure of the world's longest yard sale was in the
hunt, the joy of uncovering that one coveted piece that made the
trip spiritually, if not economically, worthwhile.
</P>
<P>
   My accomplice in all this, Chuck, is a decorative painter whose
collections include cookie jars, tin noisemakers and Lu-Ray Pastel
dishes. For him, the Holy Grail was a 3-foot-tall blown-glass
bottle made by a company called Blenko in the early 1970s.
</P>
<P>
   After looking through hundreds of thousands of items, we felt
the junker's tingle in a scraggly crescent of grass and gravel with
nothing else even remotely attractive for sale. There we found,
lying on its side, the oversized decanter, a giant yellow vessel
with its stopper still intact.
</P>
<P>
   ``How much is that big bottle?'' I asked the man standing near
it.
</P>
<P>
   ``Oh that's not for sale,'' he said. We hadn't come all this way
to hear that.
</P>
<P>
   ``If it's not for sale, why is it here?'' Chuck asked.
</P>
<P>
   The man explained that he had bought the bottle that morning for
$25, and didn't want to part with it. ``I'll give you $50,'' Chuck
said.
</P>
<P>
   No thanks, the man replied. On it went, $75, $100, finally $125.
</P>
<P>
   That was the magic number. ``I can't say no to making a hundred
dollars,'' the man said. A few minutes later, I overheard one
female shopper say to another, ``That guy must know something if
he's willing to spend that much for a bottle.''
</P>
<P>
   We both did. Chuck knew a similar Blenko bottle recently sold on
eBay for close to $1,000. I knew I didn't want to be in that
minivan if the guy had refused to sell it to Chuck.
</P>
<P>
   Steals like that one, we've since been told, have gotten fewer
and farther between as the sale has grown. ``Four years ago, before
eBay, there was a lot more collectible stuff for a quarter,'' said
Ryan Lance, a proprietor of a store called Howdy Do on East 7th
Street in Manhattan, which sells campy pop culture items like
``Cher's Dressing Room Play Set'' and ``H.R. Pufnstuf'' coloring
books.
</P>
<P>
   Programs like ``Antiques Roadshow'' and published guides to all
types of collectibles have helped to jack up prices, too, he said.
``I saw a rusted-out, horrible old `Charlie's Angels' lunchbox _
the handle was half melted _ and the lady had $95 on it,'' Lance
said. ``I asked her, `Why is it this much?' and she said, `That's
what it books for.'''
</P>
<P>
   His partner, Michael Torres, added, ``People this year were much
more aware of what they have in their homes and in their
basements.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   At least one thing hasn't changed: The so-bad-it's-good
aesthetic hasn't reached these parts yet. ``The people down there
don't appreciate black velvet paintings,'' Lance noted. ``They're
$3 apiece there, and we can get $75 here. What's sad is that people
probably took them down off their walls for the sale.''
</P>
<P>
   For those who live in these economically depressed environs _
particularly junk dealers, restaurant operators and motel owners _
the Route 127 sale is a significant source of income. ``This is by
far the biggest week of the year here,'' said Scott Sandman,
executive director of the Jamestown, Tenn., Chamber of Commerce,
which promotes the event. ``There are sellers who make 8 or 10
thousand dollars in these four days,'' he said. The median
household income in 1999 for Fentress County, Tenn., was $21,293.
</P>
<P>
   As Doss of Possum Trot Antiques said, ``In four days, we do what
we usually do in two months.''
</P>
<P>
   Debbie Barnett, who owns the County Line Antiques Mall in
Lawrenceburg, Ky., said, ``People buy for it all year long, box it
up and store it until 127.'' She sees 50 to 100 customers on a
typical day. During the sale, she estimated that 2,500 people a day
browsed through her bric-a-brac. It is so busy, in fact, that she
never leaves the store during the four-day yard sale, sleeping on a
cot rather than going home to Lexington, which is a half-hour away.
</P>
<P>
   ``Last year we had people peeking in the door at 6:30 a.m.,''
she said. ``And we stay open until they stop coming.'' That may be
as late as midnight.
</P>
<P>
   Started more than a dozen years ago, the giant yard sale has
grown since the days when a former county executive named Mike
Walker, a lawyer in Jamestown, came up with the idea of a crafts
sale to lure tourists off the interstate. ``The first year, we put
out crafts and didn't sell anything,'' Doss said. ``But after that
we put out junk and whatnot, and it sold.''
</P>
<P>
   The Route 127 Corridor Sale is no longer much of a secret. On
June 14, HGTV, the home and garden cable channel, presented a
one-hour documentary called ``The Longest Yard Sale.'' ``They aired
that special on a Wednesday, and the next day the phones wouldn't
quit,'' Sandman said. ``We had 400 calls.''
</P>
<P>
   One was from Allen Holladay, a machinist from Rock Island, Ill.
He and his girlfriend, Lori Bitterman, a nursing instructor, had
driven 750 miles from home when I caught up with them, near the
Isaac Shelby Cemetery State Historic Site, 7 miles northwest of
Stanford, Ky. ``We were sitting watching the Home and Garden
network and heard about this,'' Holladay said. ``We hadn't planned
a vacation, so we decided to come here.''
</P>
<P>
   The couple were carting furniture home in a blue van with an
open trailer attached. ``It looks like the Beverly Hillbillies,''
he admitted.
</P>
<P>
   For next summer, PBS plans to show ``A Flea Market
Documentary,'' another special featuring the Route 127 sale. At the
Lake Cumberland Motel in Jamestown, Ky., Rick Sebak, a bearish
television producer with a jovial demeanor, was conducting
interviews for it. Sebak, who produced the critically lauded PBS
specials ``An Ice Cream Show'' and ``A Hot Dog Program,'' said that
he and his crew ``have been totally flabbergasted by it all.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's better than we expected,'' he said. ``In rural Kentucky
and Tennessee, there's still cool stuff left in people's houses.''
</P>
<P>
   Not for long, perhaps. But for now, the sale still has the
feeling that around the next corner will be another Blenko bottle,
another '60s lunchbox in fabulous condition and another woman
painting a giant pig. When I think of Mannix back in Covington
pointing to her hat, I laugh.
</P>
<P>
   ``See this button?'' she asked. ``It says, `Don't pay department
store prices.' I raised four kids on yard sales.''
</P>
<P>
   Then, as she had probably done at least a hundred times before,
Mannix went into a story about the time she dressed the giant pig
up as Zsa Zsa Gabor and took him to the Queen Kumquat Sashay in
Orlando, Fla.
</P>
<P>
   The story was free. No purchase required.

GARDENING QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS

 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service

   Calendula Choices
</P>
<P>
   Q. When I lived in New Hampshire, I grew calendulas in my herb
garden that were to die for. Now, we have moved near Washington,
and they just aren't performing well. I'm baffled and need your
help, please, as these are among my favorite easy-to-grow annuals.
</P>
<P>
   A. Welcome to summer heat. Calendula, also called pot marigold,
takes little effort to grow other than remembering to put it in
full sun. But while it loves cool climates, in warmer areas it
quits blooming in midsummer. If the selection you have has grown
long and rangy, this is a perfect time to cut them back by a third
to a half. As cool weather returns, they'll rebloom. When they
start again, continue your religious devotion to deadheading, so
they will keep flowering cheerfully right until hard frost finally
takes them.
</P>
<P>
   Calendula selections range from under 1 foot tall to over 2. The
flowers are usually bright orange or shades of yellow, and are
often fully double. Knockout cultivars include Pink Surprise, with
soft peach melba petals and a well-behaved habit, and Touch of Red,
whose many petals are edged in a mahogany blush.
</P>
<P>
   Seed sources include Pinetree Garden Seeds, Box 300, New
Gloucester, Maine 04260, (207) 926-3400; and Thompson &AMP; Morgan, Box
1308, Jackson, N.J. 08527, (800) 274-7333. Both catalogs are free.

<P>
   Best and Worst of Crab Apples
</P>
<P>
   Q. This is a tale of two crab apples, and I hope you know a
happy ending. Both trees were on the property when we bought our
house last year, so I don't have any information about them. This
summer the backyard tree has lost all its leaves. The front tree
looks fine, but I am afraid that it will also succumb. What steps
can we take to help the remaining tree?
</P>
<P>
   A. Don't cut the backyard tree down _ it isn't dead. Crab
apples, lovely as they are, attract not only humans and birds, but
also a whole host of fungi. Your backyard tree has apple scab,
which the wet, cool weather has encouraged this summer. But if it
hadn't been scab, it might have been cedar-apple rust, fire blight
or powdery mildew.
</P>
<P>
   When buying one of the trees, the previous owner of your house
may have fallen in love with a pretty flower and forgot to ask
about disease resistance. Considering everything there is to decide
when choosing a crab apple _ like size and shape of the tree when
mature; size, color and persistence of the fruit; single or double
flowers in red, white, or pink; and whether it's an alternate-year
bloomer _ he or she may have just been awestruck in the middle of
all those trees in glorious flower at the nursery.
</P>
<P>
   Scab is a surprising disease. You may not notice the dull, smoky
or sooty area on new leaves, or even the irregular olive-green or
brown velvety spots. But you sure notice when all the leaves fall
off in midsummer. Rake up and destroy all those fallen leaves,
because the fungus overwinters on them and can reinfect the tree
next year. Spraying an entire tree every eight to 10 days with
fungicides to prevent scab is not just difficult, but also silly
when disease-resistant crab apples are available everywhere.
</P>
<P>
   Resistance does not mean invulnerability, and a summer of
perfect fungus weather can overcome the most resistant of trees, so
some cultivars are clearly better than others. High on everyone's
list are Adams, Adirondack, Donald Wyman, Harvest Gold, Indian
Summer, Professor Sprenger, Prairifire, Snowdrift and Sugar Tyme.
By the way, all of these have excellent resistance to cedar-apple
rust, too.

LOOKING LIKE SPRING, AUTUMN FASHIONS ARE COLOR CODED 
WITH PHOTOS
</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By LINDA GILLAN GRIFFIN 
c. 2000 Houston Chronicle 
HOUSTON _ Fall is that time of year when fashion traditionally
folds its colorful summer beach umbrella and heads for the security
of dune-dull neutrals or the colors of autumn foliage.
<TEXT>
<P>
   Bring on the beige. Stock up on little black dresses. Rake in a
few forest green or rusty orange cashmere sweaters or wool suits.
That's what fall shopping is all about, right?
</P>
<P>
   Fall is not about racks newly stocked with baby blue, bubblegum
pink, grass green or neon orange. Not, that is, until fall 2000.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe it's millennium madness, but designers have dictated a new
attitude that includes the wearing of color all year round. Exactly
what color, however, is up for debate.
</P>
<P>
   ``Red, orange, olive and tobacco or camel,'' said Lisa Spain,
owner of the Cotton Club stores. She bought a lot of camel, ``but
not for wearing near the face. It looks too hard.''
</P>
<P>
   Spain is also seeing baby blue and pink, traditional
warm-weather colors.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the customer who liked spring because it was colorful
will like this fall and winter,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Any shade of the purple family,'' said Fred McCann, owner of
Esther Wolf. ``We can't keep it in.''
</P>
<P>
   McCann said lilac is the shade of purple attracting the most
attention because it is perfect to update last year's gray suits
and separates but also brightens any neutral, ``especially dark
brown.''
</P>
<P>
   At Arden B, stores young in outlook, the main colors of the
season are shaping up as purple, red, brick, orange and the brown
family, said Tess Hall, manager of the Galleria store.
Surprisingly, these are not necessarily the neon-bright colors one
associates with the very young.
</P>
<P>
   Hall sees these fall and winter colors as deeper, richer
continuations of spring and summer colors.
</P>
<P>
   ``The color green is (begin ital)very(end ital) important,''
said Stephanie McKinley, owner of Pixie &AMP; Ivy. And navy blue,
especially in sheer fabrics or in combination with black, is the
unexpected new color for evening.
</P>
<P>
   McKinley is one of the people who wholeheartedly approve of
springlike pastel colors done in fall fabrics, such as leather.
``They make me feel so happy.''
</P>
<P>
   Roz Pactor, vice president/fashion director of Foley's, said the
whole family of reds is important for early fall, with warm tones
such as loden green and spicy oranges, but she sees a lot of true
red returning for holiday wear.
</P>
<P>
   Women who are more timid about taking a major plunge into bright
colors might instead settle on bright separates or accessories _
and many stores anticipated this possibility.
</P>
<P>
   Sweater sets abound again this fall, but with more
unconventional pieces such as sleeveless turtlenecks instead of the
traditional short-sleeved shells.
</P>
<P>
   Furry and fuzzy sweaters, those that incorporate angora or
mohair, are also excellent ways to soften ultrabright colors or
accentuate icy pastels.
</P>
<P>
   At Saks Fifth Avenue, corduroy pants appear in bright colors,
said Jaqui Lividini, senior vice president of fashion merchandising
and communications.
</P>
<P>
   Fishnet stockings are one of the hottest accessories at
Pryorities, said owner Judy Pryor. She is selling them in purple
and red, as well as black.
</P>
<P>
   One of the color compromises this season is the popularity of
Emilio Pucci and Pucci-like prints _ wild graphic designs that
combine colors such as pink and brown or orange, lime and purple,
said Cari Kerns, buyer for Leonard Rutan.
</P>
<P>
   Another color ploy is tie dye. Strong for summer and pool or
beach wear, now it is showing up in one-ply cashmere sweaters in,
say, cherry red and fuchsia, said Evelyn Gorman, owner of Mix
boutique.
</P>
<P>
   When it comes to color, this season will see the return of one
color head to toe. Very matchy, matchy.
</P>
<P>
   Some store executives believe that with the brilliant colors of
spring and summer 2000, women may be looking forward to a more
subdued and sophisticated fall.
</P>
<P>
   ``Camel looks great as the new neutral,'' said Penne Weidig,
designer buyer for Tootsies. And although Weidig bought shades of
purple and green for fall, she was surprised to note that the first
color to sell was black.
</P>
<P>
   ``Maybe it's a backlash to all the color,'' she said.

 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   MONTICELLO, N.Y. _ The Catskills have always been synonymous
with comedy, with the shtick of Sid Caesar, Jerry Lewis and Mel
Brooks. But the glorious mountains here and the flavorful
summertime crowds they drew have also proved to be a fertile ground
for more thoughtful dramas, fiction and films about love, betrayal,
even struggles with faith.
</P>
<P>
   In the bungalow colonies _ the Jewish working-class family's
chance to flee the city's sweltering apartments on the cheap _
wives and children would be left on their own during the week until
the husbands drove or bummed rides back for the weekend.
</P>
<P>
   That premise inspired Pamela Gray, a bungalow baby herself, to
write the screenplay that became the 1998 film ``A Walk on the
Moon,'' which tells of the affair between one of these stranded
wives and a hippie ``blouse man'' who comes to the colony to peddle
clothes during the Woodstock summer of 1969.
</P>
<P>
   Isaac Bashevis Singer, in ``Enemies: A Love Story,'' mined the
poignant contrast between the carefree exterior of these summertime
Edens and the inner melancholy of refugees who just a few years
earlier had lost their families in Hitler's war. More recently
Allegra Goodman, in her first novel, ``Kaaterskill Falls,'' looked
at soul-searching among pale-faced Orthodox Jewish men and their
long-sleeved wives spending their summers as anomalies in the
bedrock American villages of these mountains.
</P>
<P>
   Though it may seem too grandiose to say so, the Jewish world of
the Catskills that thrived from the start of the 20th century until
the 1970s seems to be accumulating something of a genre worthy of
serious literary and cinematic study. Add Herman Wouk's 1955 novel
``Marjorie Morningstar,'' the 1987 hotel movies ``Dirty Dancing''
and ``Sweet Lorraine,'' and a library shelf of Catskills memoirs,
and you have enough for an academic conference, which in fact was
staged last weekend for the sixth summer at one of the surviving
dowager hotels here, Kutsher's Country Club.
</P>
<P>
   Amid classic Catskills ambience _ clamorous dinners of borscht
and boiled beef, games of shuffleboard and a nightclub performance
by four gray-haired doo-wop singers, the Elegants, who joked about
their triple bypasses and enlarged prostates _ 100 Catskills
alumni, hotel owners, writers and sociologists spent three days
reading from and analyzing Catskills novels and memoirs.
</P>
<P>
   Of course they could not escape the laughter.
</P>
<P>
   Arthur Tanney, who frequented the bungalows as a child, read
excerpts from short reminiscences he has placed on a Web site
(www.brown.edu/Research/Catskills Institute) that evoked the single
phone shared by all of a colony's denizens, the invasive
loudspeaker announcements, the flickering movies shown in the
casino. (Year after year it was always ``The Guns of Navarone'' and
something with Rock Hudson and Doris Day.)
</P>
<P>
   And he remembered Ruby the Knish Man, who drove up to the colony
to sell his goods and announced his presence in a gravelly
Yiddish-inflected voice: ``Ladies and gentlemen, this is Ruby the
Knish Man. I'm now on the premises with my homogenized, pasteurized
and recently circumcised potato knishes. Please folks come. I need
the money.''
</P>
<P>
   Kidding aside, what was it about the Catskills that still fires
the literary imagination?
</P>
<P>
   ``Some places simply seem to be the repository of stories,''
said Terry Kay, a Southern writer who read from his 1994 novel
``Shadow Song.''
</P>
<P>
   The book tells the story of Madison Lee Murphy, known as Bobo, a
Georgian so provincial he knew only one Jew, who comes up to the
Catskills to work as a waiter and falls irrevocably in love with a
beautiful Jewish girl. Kay, who comes from Ty Cobb's northern
Georgia town, Royston, did in fact work for three summers in the
1950s at the Colonial Hill in Pine Hill to help pay for college,
though after one grueling weekend washing a mountain of dishes, he
told his brother he did not want to go to college anymore.
</P>
<P>
   What gives Kay's novel much of its emotional power is the
contrast between Bobo and the Jews who people the hotel, some of
them with numbers tattooed on their arms. In real life it sometimes
made for comedy. ``I made a lot of money saying `Gut morgen,
y'all,'' he says in a resonant Billy Graham voice. But it also gave
him a more serious theme for his fiction.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a place where the guests were made to feel they
belonged, and to them belonging was important,'' he writes of the
hotel. ``Most were Jewish refugees from the First and Second World
Wars. They understood what it meant to be displaced, and they
understood, even more keenly, what it meant to belong.''
</P>
<P>
   Kay's narrator, after all, is as displaced in the Catskills as
the guests are in America.
</P>
<P>
   It was in such contrasts between gentile and Jew, between
cornbread and challah, between community and loneliness that his
story blossomed and, he says, much of the other Catskills
literature has found its voice. ``The most essential thing in
writing fiction is understanding contrast, and that world was a
great contrast to this boy from the rural foothills of the South,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   The vulgarity and excess associated with the Catskills have been
easy to mock, and the hotel comedians were more than willing to do
so right in the face of the summer revelers. But writers have also
felt a need to portray with tenderness the impulse that brought
tenement Jews who had known hunger during wars or the Depression up
to these mountains in the hope of seizing some relief in
pine-scented air, bracing lake water and merciful shade.
</P>
<P>
   ``They didn't have to be like the greenhorns and stay in
tenements,'' said Phil Brown, a 51-year-old professor of sociology
at Brown University (no relation). ``They could come up here and
have a regular vacation like the Americans.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   &QL; 
nn
</P>
<P>
   Brown, the child of a family that operated a Catskills hotel in
the late 1940s and early 1950s, has made the Catskills his passion.
He is a founder of the Catskills Institute, the year-round
organization that runs the conferences, and he has even taught a
seminar at Brown on the Catskills experience, complete with a
five-page reading list.
</P>
<P>
   The world of the Catskills was rich in the kind of quirky and
colorful situations that writers love to milk. The bungalow
colonies, for example, were not just clusters of cottages around a
lawn but a distinct culture. The heart of this necklace of cramped
two-room shacks was the loftily named casino, a social hall where
the only gambling involved bingo or the cigar-flavored poker games
that men played on weekends.
</P>
<P>
   In the daytime it was where teen-agers gathered to play Ping-
Pong and take their first stabs at sex. In the evenings it was
where their parents came to watch third-rate comics, hypnotists,
magicians, even an occasional stripper sent up from New York by the
Broadway Danny Roses of that time.
</P>
<P>
   Tanney captures the pleasure children took in sneaking peaks
into the casino and relishing their hard-working parents' rare
forays into merriment.
</P>
<P>
   At the hotels, which had a slightly more upscale crowd, the
sexual attraction between the vacationing women and the staffs of
muscular busboys and waiters inspired ``Dirty Dancing'' and
``Marjorie Morningstar.'' Wouk had been the children's waiter at
the Tamarack Lodge in the '30s, and in his novel, Marjorie is a
camp counselor who, like thousands of counselors and bungalow
inmates in real life, sneaks into a hotel, where she falls in love
with its social director, Noel Airman. But Marjorie's parents want
her to marry someone traditionally successful, and a songsmith is
not what they had in mind.
</P>
<P>
   Those at the conference were profoundly aware that they were
visitors to a vanishing world; one guest compared her capering at
Kutsher's to getting a chance to sail on the Titanic before it
sank. A world that in its heyday had more than 500 hotels and
bungalow colonies and a million summertime visitors has been
reduced to a handful of hotels surrounded by decaying bungalows and
swimming pools with trees growing out of them.
</P>
<P>
   For writers, that sense of loss gives their works an extra
piquancy. Kay, in his novel, describes the mountain towns he visits
decades after his waiter days as ``ghost towns.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Each moment is a visit with the ghost of who I used to be, and
with the ghosts of all the people I knew,'' Kay writes. `I see
them. They are walking in their toddling steps on sidewalks and
they are sitting in the fold-out lounge chairs beside the neglected
ruin of the swimming pool. They ask me for water _ `Wasser!
Wasser!' _ in the dining room.''
</P>
<P>
   Many of the Catskills tales are seen from the point of view of
children coming of age savoring the freedom to roam and experiment
in pastoral safety rather than the dicey streets of New York.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had my first kiss in the woods behind the bungalow colony,''
said Gray. ``And the people writing about the Catskills probably
had those experiences back then.''
</P>
<P>
   She knew that in writing her screenplay she was aiming not just
for a wide public but for Catskills aficionados grateful that their
little-known world was finally getting an airing. But at last
year's conference purists quibbled with the size of the kitchen in
Gray's movie _ she acknowledges that it had to be made big to
squeeze in a film crew _ and with the fact that there never was a
vendor that looked like the handsome lover of her film.
</P>
<P>
   ``They looked more like Dom DeLuise,'' Tanney said.
</P>
<P>
   Much of the Catskills fiction of course has been seen through
rose-tinted glasses of adults looking back nostalgically at their
impressionable youth. And there were some at the conference who
were not shy about pointing out the discrepancies.
</P>
<P>
   ``They say those were the good times, but that's baloney,'' said
Bob Fuller, an 82-year-old real estate owner in Brooklyn Heights
who remembers renting a kochalayn (``cook alone'') _ a room in a
boarding house with a common kitchen _ for $75. ``I was poor. I
envied the people in the hotels. When I wanted to go back to the
city, I had to hitch a ride. That wasn't a good time. Now is the
good time.''
</P>
<P>
   But the reason for the sunburst of Catskills writing is that
writers are eager to look back at their youth, when as Tanney said,
the days seemed endless and most complicated thing he had to think
about was what was for lunch.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're more connected than we've ever been in history, with the
Internet, cell phones and cable TV,'' Tanney told the conference.
``As connected as we are, we're more disconnected than we've ever
been. And that sense of community that I experienced in the
bungalows, of belonging, of being in the same place together is
gone.''

 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ J.D. Salinger's daughter, Margaret, is visiting from
Boston and staying at the Plaza Hotel, under an assumed name. There
are Salinger ``crazies'' out there, she says, who have written
menacing letters to her family. And then there is the possibility
that her famously private father will try to stop her from
publishing her memoir, ``Dream Catcher,'' due out on Sept. 6 from
Pocket Books.
</P>
<P>
   Salinger, 81, who has not published anything since 1965 and has
not spoken publicly for years, is so determined in his seclusion
that he successfully delayed the publication of a biography by Ian
Hamilton because Hamilton had sought to use some of his letters.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ian Hamilton thought my dad would be so proud of him and sent
him the galleys,'' said Ms. Salinger. ``I know better.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Salinger has written a book that reveals not only her own
life but previously unknown and deeply intimate aspects of her
father's life. Her motivation in breaching his zealously guarded
privacy is likely to be questioned by many who criticized Joyce
Maynard's 1998 memoir, which included details of her romance with
Salinger when she was 18 and he was 53. Last year's auction of
letters that Salinger wrote to Ms. Maynard in the early 1970s also
prompted criticism. The letters were bought by the California
software entrepreneur and philanthropist Peter Norton, who returned
them to Salinger.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Salinger says she is willing to take the risk that her
father might not speak to her again. And then of course there is
the possibility that the public might see her book as an attempt to
trade on his name. In any case she has written it, Ms. Salinger
says, to make sense of her strange childhood. And she has come to
New York to promote the book.
</P>
<P>
   The Plaza is a place of happy memories, where she used to stay
with her father when they visited her godfather, William Shawn, the
editor of The New Yorker. She is looking at photographs in her book
about her handsome young father, beaming as she learns to walk, as
she sits on his shoulders, plays the piano.
</P>
<P>
   ``He loves me,'' said Ms. Salinger, as if surprised. ``Isn't he
sexy! How funny he was.'' And she looks like him, too, tall, with
the same long face and dark eyes.
</P>
<P>
   Her father loved her, but he was also pathologically
self-centered, Ms. Salinger says. Nothing could interrupt his work,
which he likened to a quest for enlightenment. He was also abusive
toward her mother, Claire Douglas, Ms. Salinger says, keeping her a
virtual prisoner in his house in Cornish, N.H., refusing to allow
her to see friends and family. Ms. Salinger said that her father
feared the female body and that when Ms. Douglas was pregnant, he
found her abhorrent. She said that since her parents rarely had
sex, she feels her birth was almost an accident.
</P>
<P>
   Salinger's agent, Phyllis Westberg of Harold Ober Associates,
said he would not comment on Ms. Salinger's book.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Salinger also says that when she was 13 months old, her
mother planned to kill her and commit suicide, and later did indeed
burn the house down. Ms. Salinger said her mother denied setting
the fire. Ms. Douglas is now a Jungian analyst in California and
``a terrific grandma,'' Ms. Salinger said.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Douglas did not respond to messages left on her answering
machine.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Salinger pursued Scientology, homeopathy and
Christian Science. He drank urine, his daughter writes, and sat in
an orgone box. He spoke in tongues, fasted until he turned green
and as an older man had pen pal relationships with teen-age girls.
</P>
<P>
   After her parents divorced in 1966, her father continued to be a
part of her life. She stayed with him at times in Cornish.
</P>
<P>
   Does he know about her book? ``He does now,'' said Ms. Salinger,
because of newspaper articles. Has she spoken to him since then?
She laughs. ``I may be 44,'' she said, ``but I still don't want to
get yelled at.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, ``it's not unusual at all to not speak for several
months,'' said Ms. Salinger. ``Particularly because he's very
deaf,'' and for a long time refused to wear a hearing aid, she
added.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not officially estranged,'' she said. ``What other
people might call weird is just regular for us.''
</P>
<P>
   Considering Ms. Salinger's accounts of her childhood and
teen-age years _ bulimia, ``severe perceptual distortions,''
``panic attacks, chronic fatigue syndrome and fibromyalgia'' _ she
seems quite jolly. She laughs, makes fun of herself. Her father
loves her, she said, but ``he probably hates my guts, too, I would
say, operatically.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Salinger said she wrote ``Dream Catcher'' because ``I was
absolutely determined not to repeat with my son what had been done
with me.''
</P>
<P>
   ``There is something to be said for the examined life,'' she
said.
</P>
<P>
   There is one moment that stands out above all, she said. ``It is
so horrible, it's so powerful.'' When she was pregnant and sick,
instead of offering help, her father ``said I had no right to bring
a child into this lousy world,'' she writes, ``and he hoped I was
considering an abortion.''
</P>
<P>
   The book, she says, is her struggle to make sense of it all. The
Salingers have always been secretive, she said. It is embodied in
``Catcher in the Rye'': ``My parents would have about two
hemorrhages apiece if I told anything pretty personal about them.
They're quite touchy about anything like that.''
</P>
<P>
   From her Aunt Doris, her father's sister who is six years older
and in failing health, Ms. Salinger said she learned about her
father's childhood as Jerome David Salinger, son of Miriam and Sol
Salinger, who became a prosperous food merchant in New York. Jerome
grew up on the Upper West Side and Park Avenue and attended Valley
Forge Military Academy. He was the center of his mother's life, Ms.
Salinger said her aunt told her. But Miriam was also
overprotective. Salinger once wrote in a letter to Hemingway that
his mother walked him to school until he was 24, Ms. Salinger said.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   He had always thought his parents were Jewish, Ms. Salinger
writes, but when he was a teen-ager he discovered that his mother
was Irish Catholic. Still, he experienced anti-Semitism, from which
he developed his aversion, expressed by his characters, for the Ivy
League, for ``phonies.''
</P>
<P>
   During World War II he was a counterintelligence agent assigned
to the Twelfth Regiment of the Fourth Division, interrogating
POW's. He served in the most brutal campaigns of the European
theater, including D-Day and the Battle of the Bulge. In 1945 in
Germany he was hospitalized for ``battle fatigue.''
</P>
<P>
   In one of the book's surprises, Ms. Salinger writes that her
father arrested a young Nazi Party functionary, Sylvia, then
married her. The marriage was brief, and forever after he referred
to her as Saliva.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Salinger's parents met in 1950 at the writer Francis
Steegmuller's apartment; Claire Douglas was about 16 and Salinger
about 31. Ms. Douglas was born in England, the daughter of the art
critic and dealer Robert Langton Douglas.
</P>
<P>
   At the time Ms. Douglas and Salinger met, he abstained from sex,
her mother told Ms. Salinger, because he was studying with an
Indian mystic who taught that it interfered with enlightenment. Ms.
Salinger quotes from ``The Gospels of Sri Ramakrishna,'' written by
the guru's guru. An acolyte announces that he and his wife have had
intercourse: ``Don't you hate yourself for dallying with a body
which contains only blood phlegm, filth and excreta?'' Ramakrishna
asks. Ms. Salinger noted that in Salinger's story ``A Perfect Day
for Bananafish,'' the character Seymour shoots himself on his
honeymoon.
</P>
<P>
   Just months before her high school graduation, Ms. Douglas
married Salinger and moved with him to Cornish. Ms. Douglas told
her daughter that he demanded elaborate meals and that the sheets
had to be laundered twice weekly, though there was no heat or hot
water. When her mother became pregnant, Ms. Salinger writes, she
fell into ``a suicidal depression when she realized that her
pregnancy only repulsed him.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Salinger was born in 1955, the year her father's stories
``Franny'' and ``Raise High the Roof Beam, Carpenters'' were
published in The New Yorker.
</P>
<P>
   Salinger wrote letters about his joy in her, Ms. Salinger said.
He was a playful father who seemed easier in the magic world of
childhood. Her imaginary friends were real to him, too, she says,
as were the characters in his books. ``The world of fiction and
reality were very blurred,'' she writes. But, her mother felt
``jealousy and rage over my replacement of her in my father's
affections.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1960 the Salingers had a son, Matthew, who is now an actor
and producer in California. Last month The Sunday Times of London
quoted him as saying of his sister: ``I guess she's got a lot of
anger. But to write a book just isn't right. It's kind of
pathetic.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Salinger says she does not believe he said it: ``I love my
brother dearly. It just doesn't sound like him.''
</P>
<P>
   Attempts to reach him by telephone or through friends were not
successful.
</P>
<P>
   After his divorce in 1972, Salinger had a relationship with Ms.
Maynard, the journalist, who was two years older than his daughter.
To Ms. Salinger it was a repeat of his relationship with her
mother. He induced Ms. Maynard to leave college and live in
isolation with him, Ms. Maynard wrote her own memoir of Salinger,
``At Home in the World'' (Picador, 1998).
</P>
<P>
   After a brief ``impulsive'' marriage to her karate instructor,
Ms. Salinger began pulling her life together. She graduated from
Brandeis University with honors and received a degree in management
from Oxford University. She attended Harvard Divinity School and
trained as a nondenominational hospital chaplain. She is married to
an opera singer and actor _ she refuses to give his name, or that
of her son, or her son's age. She wants to write more books, she
said, though she would not say on what topics.
</P>
<P>
   Today Salinger is married to his third wife, Colleen, a nurse,
some 50 years younger than he. ``She's lovely,'' Ms. Salinger said.
She cared for Ms. Salinger for a time during her pregnancy, she
said, though Salinger constantly asked his wife to come home. Ms.
Salinger writes that her father berates Colleen, as he did her
mother. At one point the couple was trying to have a child, Ms.
Salinger said.
</P>
<P>
   Salinger still lives in Cornish. The curtains in the house are
drawn nearly all the time, said Ms. Salinger. She has seen his
bedroom and study, ``probably twice in my life.'' Salinger is still
writing, and lives on royalties. ``Catcher in the Rye'' sells ``at
least'' 250,000 copies annually, she said.
</P>
<P>
   She said she did not know why Salinger refused to publish his
work. ``My aunt thinks he can't stand any criticism,'' she said.
``He sure doles it out.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Salinger speaks with affection of her father's early
``lovely stories in magazines he won't allow to be published in
books.''
</P>
<P>
   ``He's stopped lecturing enough and was telling a good story,''
she said.
</P>
<P>
   Later stories, like ``Hapworth 16, 1924,'' are simply lectures,
she says, that she heard as a child. ``He has opinions on
everything from how to chew your food to proper breathing
techniques.''
</P>
<P>
   Toward the end of ``Dream Catcher,'' Ms. Salinger writes that in
giving up her dream of a perfect father, memories of happy times
with him have returned. ``When I was a kid, he was just so funny,''
Ms. Salinger said. ``The world just lit up when Daddy came home.''

<P>
   BANGKOK, Thailand _ The Muslim rebel gunmen who have kidnapped
an American tourist in the southern Philippines belong to a
particularly brutal faction that has tortured and killed hostages
in the past.
</P>
<P>
   Two days after seizing the tourist, Jeffrey Schilling, 24, a
member of the group told a local radio station Wednesday that it
was ``fully prepared'' to talk with the United States, but only if
Libya, Iraq, North Korea and China also took part.
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, said the group member, Abu Sabaya, ``Maybe we
will behead him.''
</P>
<P>
   In Washington, a spokesman for the State Department, Philip
Reeker, ruled out negotiations. He said that the United States
would ``not pay ransom, change policies, release prisoners or make
any concessions that reward hostage taking.''
</P>
<P>
   Reeker did say that the United States would welcome mediation by
other nations like Libya, which has longstanding contacts with the
rebels and has stepped in to negotiate for the release of a dozen
Western hostages kidnapped four months ago by the Abu Sayyaf group.
Libyan officials said on Tuesday that they would be willing to help
in the case of Schilling.
</P>
<P>
   So far, Libya has secured the release of six of the Westerners,
paying a ransom of $1 million for each of them. The chief
Philippine negotiator, Roberto Aventajado, said Wednesday that he
expected the last six Westerners to be released soon.
</P>
<P>
   But in what could be a troublesome sign for the case of
Schilling, Aventajado said he was optimistic because those other
hostages are being held by a separate, and perhaps more amenable,
faction of the Abu Sayyaf group.
</P>
<P>
   Abu Sayyaf is a minor group in a long-running Muslim separatist
war in the south of the Philippines, an overwhelmingly Roman
Catholic nation. Unlike the major participants, it has occupied
itself more with terror and ransom kidnappings than with
ideological warfare.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Formed in 1991 by a veteran of the anti-Soviet war in
Afghanistan, Abu Sayyaf, which means ``Bearer of the Sword,'' has
earned a reputation as one of the more aggressive of the region's
armed groups.
</P>
<P>
   In 1993 it killed seven people by rolling grenades down the
aisle of a Roman Catholic cathedral. In 1995 it massacred 53 people
in a shooting spree in a Christian-dominated village. Its kidnap
victims have included Spanish nuns, an American Bible translator
and a fishery worker from Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
   But it had remained a small group of perhaps 200 armed men until
the windfall of ransom money from its recent kidnappings. According
to some reports, new recruits have swelled its number to as many as
5,000 fighters.
</P>
<P>
   As it grew, Abu Sayyaf fragmented into a half dozen sometimes
squabbling factions spread across several tiny islands. Its
internal divisions over tactics and money have complicated recent
hostage negotiations.
</P>
<P>
   The faction with which Aventajado has been negotiating has
treated its hostages carefully and has already released two dozen
of them _ in return for a reported total of at least $11.5 million
_ since its latest spate of kidnappings began in April.
</P>
<P>
   Naming two leaders of this faction, Aventajado said Wednesday
that ``I have received a letter from Robot and Mujib assuring me
that they don't have anything to do with this Schilling
abduction.''
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   The faction that apparently seized Schilling is responsible for
the kidnapping earlier this year of about 50 Philippine
schoolchildren and teachers whom it held for months, sometimes in
underground pits.
</P>
<P>
   At one point it apparently tortured and killed a Catholic
priest. At another it beheaded two teachers when the United States
did not respond to its demand for the release of Arab terrorists
convicted in the 1993 bombing of the World Trade Center.
</P>
<P>
   In a rambling radio interview on Tuesday, an Abu Sayyaf member
suggested that the group might make a similar demand in return for
the release of Schilling. He said formal demands would be announced
on Friday.
</P>
<P>
   The rebel member asserted that Schilling worked for the Central
Intelligence Agency, but both his family and U.S. officials
dismissed that claim.
</P>
<P>
   ``This individual is a completely innocent person who has been
unjustifiably seized,'' said John Caulfield, the U.S. consul
general in Manila.
</P>
<P>
   In Oakland, Calif., Schilling's home, a friend, Anthony Rodgers,
said: ``There's no CIA involvement. He's apolitical. He's just a
guy who happens to be in love. That's all it is.''
</P>
<P>
   Schilling is a graduate of the University of California,
Berkeley, who majored in Near Eastern studies and converted to
Islam, his friends said.
</P>
<P>
   According to his mother, Carol, he had gone to the Philippines
in March because of a longstanding interest in the region and had
stayed on because he fell in love with a woman from the southern
Philippines, Ivi V. Osani.
</P>
<P>
   ``I tried to get him out of the country three times but he
didn't come out,'' his mother said. ``He was too much in love.''

<P>
   MOSCOW _ In the latest twist to years of artistic and
administrative turmoil, Vladimir Vasilyev was dismissed as director
of the Bolshoi Theater, Russia's premier opera and ballet company,
in a decree signed on Monday by President Vladimir Putin.
</P>
<P>
   Vasilyev and a deputy, Vladimir Kokonin, were removed and their
posts eliminated. The theater will now be run by a general director
and an artistic director, who have not been officially named.
Vasilyev was not informed in advance but heard about the decision
on the radio.
</P>
<P>
   As head of entire Bolshoi Theater, Vasilyev, a former ballet
star, was responsible for both artistic and administrative policy.
He was appointed in 1995 by President Boris Yeltsin in a decision
meant to put an end to the divisive rule over the ballet company by
Yuri Grigorovich, a brilliant choreographer whose policies were
attacked as dictatorial.
</P>
<P>
   Although the timing of the decision was a surprise, with the
theater closed on Monday and both companies on tour, people
familiar with the Bolshoi had speculated for months about impending
changes there. Rumors had circulated that Valery Gergiev, the
conductor and artistic director of St. Petersburg's Mariinsky
Theater, would be charged with restoring the Bolshoi's faded glory.
</P>
<P>
   The likely appointees, however, are Anatoly Iksanov, a former
director of St. Petersburg's Bolshoi Drama Theater, who is not well
known to the public but is respected in theater circles, as general
director, and Gennady Rozhdestvensky, the conductor, as artistic
director. But Gergiev's Mariinsky is clearly a model for the new
direction. Russia's culture minister, Mikhail Shvydkoi, said the
main reason for reorganizing the theater's management was an
extremely expensive project to renovate the main Bolshoi building,
which is 143 years old and deteriorating significantly, and to
construct an adjacent sister theater.
</P>
<P>
   The plan, announced in December, with work on the main building
scheduled to begin in 2001, has drawn criticism. Parts of the plan
are half completed, and others have never been clearly defined. The
project is being supported by UNESCO, but agency officials have
complained of difficulties in dealing with Bolshoi bureaucrats.
</P>
<P>
   ``The theater must be under the authority of those who are
responsible for the financial flow and are called upon to ensure
its reconstruction and construction,'' Shvydkoi told Moskovskiye
Novosti, a Moscow newspaper. ``For a minimum of the next five years
the key figure will be the administrative and not the artistic
director. Moreover, the volume of building and technological work
is so great that it is unlikely, I think, that a serious cultural
figure will risk taking on such responsibility.''
</P>
<P>
   Shvydkoi spoke of the realities of the market economy, which is
reshaping the way Russian cultural institutions function after
decades of state control and financing and years of post-Soviet
decline.
</P>
<P>
   ``We will restore the system of administration, which will be
headed by a manager,'' Shvydkoi said.
</P>
<P>
   Putin's decree subordinates the theater to the Ministry of
Culture. According to Yeltsin's 1995 order, the Bolshoi
administration answered to the prime minister, which according to
critics meant that in effect it answered to no one.
</P>
<P>
   ``The theater demanded everything from everyone, but didn't have
to do anything for anyone,'' said Yaroslav Sedov, a music and dance
critic for the news magazine Itogi.
</P>
<P>
   Some, though, have criticized the culture minister for trying to
take too much under his control. Shvydkoi's ministry recently took
over the state film ministry.
</P>
<P>
   While critics could forgive Vasilyev his shortcomings as an
administrator, they were angry about his failure to revive the
Bolshoi artistically. His staging of ``Swan Lake'' was deemed a
flop, but what critics found even more dismaying was his inability
to introduce the new ideas he had promised when appointed.
</P>
<P>
   The touring success of the Bolshoi, critics say, was built on
the strength of highly talented dancers and fail-safe favorites
like ``Don Quixote,'' performed during this summer's U.S. tour. And
while foreigners know the Bolshoi primarily as a ballet company, in
Russia it has historically been revered for its opera. Critics hope
a new director will be able to restore that luster.
</P>
<P>
   ``Young opera directors need to be invited,'' said Vadim
Gayevsky, a ballet scholar and critic. ``There are wonderful,
unknown directors here. They won't stage nonsense, but real operas.
They will stage Prokofiev and Shostakovich. Right now there is only
one Prokofiev in the repertory. The revival must first of all be in
opera. If they open the door to the young generation, then
everything can become brilliant.''

ISRAELI COURT BACKS COPYRIGHT ON RECONSTRUCTION OF ANCIENT SCROLL 
</HEADLINE>
   By JOEL GREENBERG  
 
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   JERUSALEM _ The Israeli Supreme Court ruled Wednesday that an
Israeli scholar had a copyright on his reconstruction of an
important Dead Sea Scroll and that his right had been violated by
an unauthorized early publication of his work.
</P>
<P>
   Lawyers who arguing the case said that it was the first in which
copyright law had been applied in court to a reconstruction of an
ancient document.
</P>
<P>
   Upholding the ruling of a lower court seven years ago, the
decision evoked what had been a heated debate over access to the
2,000-year-old scrolls, once restricted to a small group of
scholars but now open to researchers.
</P>
<P>
   Discovered in the late 1940s and 1950s in caves near the Dead
Sea, the more than 800 scrolls, including the oldest known copies
of Old Testament books, are thought to have been written between
the second century B.C. and A.D. 70. Scholars believe they provide
valuable insights into the history of Judaism and the origins of
Christianity.
</P>
<P>
   Their study was dominated for years by a team of editors
overseen by the Israel Antiquities Authority, but mounting
criticism of restricted access to the manuscripts led to a wide
expansion of the circle of editors and the eventual release of
photographs of the scrolls to all scholars.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday's ruling rejected an appeal by Hershel Shanks,
president of the Biblical Archaeology Society in the United States
and editor of Biblical Archaeology Review, a strong advocate of
free access to the scrolls.
</P>
<P>
   Shanks appealed a Jerusalem District Court ruling that he had
infringed the copyright of the Israeli scholar, Dr. Elisha Qimron,
by publishing Qimron's reconstruction of a scroll without credit or
permission before the planned publication of the work.
</P>
<P>
   The reconstruction appeared in an appendix to Shanks' forward to
``A Facsimile Edition of the Dead Sea Scrolls,'' a collection of
more than 1,700 photographs of scroll fragments published in 1991
by his society in an effort to bring previously unpublished
documents to light.
</P>
<P>
   The editors, who were also sued by Qimron and joined the appeal,
were Robert H. Eisenman of California State University at Long
Beach and James M. Robinson of the Claremont Graduate School in
California.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The reconstruction was photocopied from a Polish journal, The
Qumran Chronicle, where it had been published as an anonymously
received manuscript after Qimron and John Strugnell, a Harvard
scholar who had also worked on the scroll, circulated drafts of
their work to colleagues.
</P>
<P>
   Qimron spent more than a decade deciphering and reconstructing
the text of the scroll, known as MMT, initials of the Hebrew words
for ``Some Precepts of the Torah.''
</P>
<P>
   Arranging scroll fragments and filling in some 40 percent of the
restored text based on an analysis of the context, Qimron
reconstructed 121 lines of the manuscript, which lists differences
over religious laws that divided the sect that wrote the scrolls
from mainstream Judaism.
</P>
<P>
   Shanks and his lawyers argued in court that Qimron was
uncovering an existing composition and could not claim a copyright
for reconstructing an ancient text he did not write.
</P>
<P>
   They asserted that granting Qimron a copyright could inhibit
further study of the reconstructed manuscript and harm academic
freedom by giving him a monopoly over what was rightly ``part of
the cultural heritage of the Jewish people.''
</P>
<P>
   But Judge Jacob Turkel wrote in the decision Wednesday that by
filling in gaps of missing text, deciphering and putting together
scroll fragments, Qimron had shown ``originality and creativity''
that earned him a copyright that had been infringed by Shanks.
</P>
<P>
   Qimron said the case had nothing to do with academic freedom and
everything to do with theft of his work.
</P>
<P>
   ``This ruling showed that intellectual property also comes under
the commandment: Thou shalt not steal,'' he said.

PUTTING ON A FALL FACE 
WITH PHOTOS
</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By LINDA GILLAN GRIFFIN 
c. 2000 Houston Chronicle 
Color both seduces and scares women.
<TEXT>
<P>
   A makeup artist may suggest a color, and the color may look
good. But if a woman doesn't like it she won't wear it.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can tell a woman `This color will bring out your skin
tone, your eye color, brighten you up.' But if for some reason,
somewhere in her childhood, her mother wore a lipstick she just
hated, then she won't wear that color. It's just psychology,'' said
Heidi Schulze, a makeup artist at Michael Kemper Salon.
</P>
<P>
   But while a woman may not like orange, for example, there are a
lot of variations of a color, she said.
</P>
<P>
   Wearing of the orange
</P>
<P>
   If a woman is going to wear orange outfits, and she is a
brunette, Schulze will pull bronze or copper into her makeup for
fall.
</P>
<P>
   If she's a blonde, Schulze will add charcoal browns and coral
tones, so the woman has a little pink in her makeup. Coral, she
said, is simply another shade of orange, one mixed with pink.
</P>
<P>
   ``A redhead? That's too easy,'' Schulze said. ``She can wear any
shade of orange _ unless she's auburn. Then she needs a cooler
tone, something more tomatoey but with blue undertones.''
</P>
<P>
   In fall, blue tones usually abound, in cosmetics and clothing.
People tend to be paler. ``But they have to keep some warmness in
their look or they look ghoulish,'' Schulze said.
</P>
<P>
   Also, she said, as women get older and their hair grays, they
tend to wear more blue tones, but that can be a mistake if their
teeth have also discolored. ``They can start to look like Morticia
Addams'' of TV's ``The Addams Family.''
</P>
<P>
   Go for green
</P>
<P>
   Greens in clothing are nice colors for lots of people, Schulze
said. ``If they want a cool citrus green (eye shadow), they can mix
it with charcoal or gray browns to their makeup to produce a cooler
look. Use a khaki or eucalyptus in the crease of the eye or a green
cake liner. Or forest green mascara. You can also use black mascara
and just tip the lashes with the color mascara.''
</P>
<P>
   Wear magenta or even fuchsia
</P>
<P>
   These are very blue-based colors, said Schulze, and magenta has
more of a purple base than fuchsia.
</P>
<P>
   ``These colors look really good on a blonde, but you want a very
soft eye, an icy eye, in silver or gray or shimmery white. It is a
good idea to pretty closely match your lipstick and lip pencil to
your outfit.''
</P>
<P>
   Pretty in winter pink
</P>
<P>
   Schulze recommends that women older than 40 save bubblegum pink
clothing for spring, but if they must wear it, she recommends using
a lavender lip gloss to take off the neon edge.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is very hard for older women to wear neon-bright colors,''
she said.
</P>
<P>
   Makeup artist Laura Mercier recommends wearing a lip color more
vibrant than the pink worn during fall or winter. She suggests
blue-red tones or layering a deep blue-red with silver.
</P>
<P>
   Brown out
</P>
<P>
   With the emphasis on camel, brown, crocodile and python this
fall and winter, there is the possibility women will go too far
into brown-toned cosmetics, creating a washed-out look.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have two options,'' said Mercier, whose Temptress look for
fall includes strong red and red-brown lipcolors.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can either play up the color on your face by using smoky
eye colors with a very sexy red lip color, or you can use `happy'
browns. These have a tint of red that makes them more intense than
a regular khaki color.''
</P>
<P>
   In the Laura Mercier line, she recommends Temptation and Cognac
eye colors and Quartz or Lust lipsticks.
</P>
<P>
   Luxury woman look
</P>
<P>
   Wearing black or black-and-white fashions is one of the surest
ways to achieve this fall's luxury-woman look, but it requires
special makeup.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the fall to look a little more glamorous,'' Schulze said.
``The black-and-white eye is good but pull in a little silver and
wear bright red lipstick. Pull in dark as eyeliner.''
</P>
<P>
   Basically black-and-white eye makeup can also benefit from
pulling in colors such as periwinkle or lavender tones, but not
blue or turquoise.
</P>
<P>
   For fall, perhaps the most important thing to remember is that
there should be only one strong thing on your face.
</P>
<P>
   ``You don't want your face to enter the room before you do,''
Schulze said. With a dramatic eye, she recommends a soft lip, maybe
a berry stain instead of lipstick. With a bright, strong, lacquered
lip, she uses a smudged, softened eye.
</P>
<P>
   On cheeks, Schulze uses a bit of color, such as a soft warm
peach or bronze, or a sheer wash of pink, such as Trish McEvoy's
new Cheeky.
</P>
<P>
   Keep the basics
</P>
<P>
   ``What I learned when I studied portrait painting as an
artist,'' said Cynthia Christ, owner of Sensia Salon, ``is that
rather than changing the foundation color, it's better to change
the powder. For example, if someone is trying to wear the orange
colors, I change them to a yellow-based powder. If they're trying
to wear some of the new plums and burgundies, I might change them
to a rosy-based powder.
</P>
<P>
   ``By changing the powder color they look more natural,'' Christ
said.
</P>
<P>
   How-to help
</P>
<P>
   If the finer points of makeup application are missing in your
education, check Mercier's makeup video, ``Laura Mercier: Flawless
Face.''
</P>
<P>
   Priced at $25, the recently released instructional video
accompanies Mercier, one of the world's most in-demand makeup
artists, as she shares some of her secrets with six real women of
various ages and racial backgrounds.
</P>
<P>
   This is a fine way to learn why Mercier, who launched her own
makeup line four years ago, is in demand by celebrities such as
Madonna, Julia Roberts, Celine Dion and Susan Sarandon.

 By RABBI ELI HECHT  
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
 &HT;    
 &HT;    
 &HT;    There was once a congregation in need of a clergyman, a
community leader. They advertised in the local paper and two
candidates applied. One was a rich and successful cleric while the
other was as poor as a church mouse. Each was given a chance to
address the congregation.
 &HT;    The first told the people to attend daily prayer groups and
weekend retreats. He said families that prayed together had a
better chance of staying together, and that God was needed in all
decisions.
 &HT;    After his speech the executive board met and declined to give
him the job. ``He is too rich and has nothing to do with his time _
so he prays all day and wants us to do the same. We need a regular
clergyman.''
 &HT;    The second candidate addressed the people. He said that all of
society's problems were caused by the lack of religion. We need to
integrate God into our daily lives. Movies and TV shows are too
corrupt, polluting our minds and the minds of our children.
 &HT;    Once again the board met and rejected the second candidate. ``He
is so poor and has nothing to do except find faults with our way of
life. Now he wants us to give up our lifestyles. We need a regular
person to be a clergyman.''
 &HT;    So the story goes and a third candidate was interviewed. When he
spoke he said, ``You don't like the rich, you don't like the poor.
You have all the excuses for not having religion. Well, I was once
rich and once poor. Now I am a regular guy and I believe that
religion is the greatest. It gives us the moral background and
strength to build our country. Faith is indeed the mother and hope
for our survival.'' Needless to say, he got the job.
 &HT;    This story comes to mind when I hear that some Jewish leaders,
especially Abraham Foxman of the Anti-Defamation League, have asked
the Democratic vice presidential candidate, Sen. Joseph Lieberman,
to desist from speaking about religion on the campaign trail.
 &HT;    In a letter to the senator, Foxman has accused Lieberman of
``overt expressions'' that cross the line between politics and
religion.
 &HT;    What chutzpah. Nothing could be further from the truth.
Lieberman, Vice President Al Gore and Gov. George W. Bush all
profess their faith and interject it in their political speeches.
When did we give up free speech? Is religious expression
anti-democratic? Do we need protection from leaders who are
religious?
 &HT;    I believe Foxman's actions are the antithesis of religious
freedom. By demanding that Lieberman stop expressing religious
sentiments, he hijacks the Anti-Defamation League program. Foxman
misrepresents the Jewish and non-Jewish religious needs of our
country.
 &HT;    He is guilty of the very crimes the Anti-Defamation League was
meant to combat.
 &HT;    There is no greater defamation than for a Jew in a leadership
position to tell another Jew, elected by the people of our glorious
country, that he can't speak his mind. Ironically, it sounds
anti-Semitic.
 &HT;    Asking elected officials to stop speaking their minds about
religion is tantamount to asking Congress to stop opening its
session with a prayer or to remove the slogan ``In God We Trust.''
 &HT;    Lieberman is the epitome of the American dream. Luckily, he
dreams with his eyes open. He is a regular guy, elected by the
people, for the people. He shouldn't be censored because of his
religious beliefs. It is stated in the U.S. Constitution that
``Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of
religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof.''
 &HT;    Remember, God has granted us prosperity and peace because of our
religious beliefs and not in spite of them.
 &HT;    It was said by the great President Abraham Lincoln, ``We trust
sir, that God is on our side. It is more important to know that we
are on God's side.''

   CHENEY (Atlanta) _ Dick Cheney said a military made strong in
the 1980s by Republican-led defense spending is now low on morale,
weapons and soldiers because of ``eight years of neglect and
misplaced priorities'' by the Clinton-Gore administration. Cheney,
the former defense secretary and now Republican vice presidential
candidate, said troops that were victorious in the Persian Gulf War
have been hurt by spending cuts ``far beyond any careful weighing
of the national interest.'' (Summary from wires) By Michael Cooper.
</P>
<P>
   CAMPAIGN-VEEPS (Undated) _ Joseph Lieberman and Dick Cheney are
waging starkly different campaigns as they strike out on their own
for the first time since each party's national convention. Cheney,
who has confronted questions about his health, his voting record in
Congress and his multimillion-dollar retirement package from a
major oil services corporation, has largely kept a low profile,
staging small events, sticking to a safe speech script, generally
staying clear of reporters from national news organizations.
Lieberman has been a more active campaigner, drawing far larger
crowds and attracting _ indeed courting _ more media coverage. By
David Barstow.

   COLOMBIA-CLINTON (Cartagena, Colombia) _ In a show of

nation's fight against drugs, insurgents and recession. (Summary

   NY-PRIMARY (New York) _ It is a primary race that has spawned a
soap opera-like drama. The bitterness of a feud between two
Democrats in the 11th Congressional District in Brooklyn has not
only torn apart a longstanding relationship but has delivered some
of that anguish to the doorstep of other politicians and voters in
the borough. But it is also a race that has brought to the surface
simmering _ and often unspoken _ unease between black New Yorkers
whose roots are in the United States and those with Caribbean
heritage. By Jonathan P. Hicks.
</P>
<P>
   CHINA-WORKERS (Tianjin, China) _ The brick-walled Meite
Packaging factory at 208 Hongqi Street is nearly deserted now, its
managers and machines all hastily transferred over the last two
days to an isolated development zone. Although the closure had long
been planned, the precipitous departure was necessitated by an
extraordinary event: Last week, desperate Chinese workers fearing
layoffs kept six foreign managers from Meite's U.S. parent company
hostage in the factory for 40 hours, holding them incommunicado.
Taking foreign businessmen hostage is virtually unheard of in
China, despite the thousands of often fractious business
partnerships between Chinese and foreign companies that now exist
here. But the workers' frustrations that sparked this unusual
incident are extremely commonplace, leading to hundreds of worker
protests in the last 3 years. By Elisabeth Rosenthal.

   SOMALIA-POLITICS (Mogadishu, Somalia) _ Somalia finally has a
government, and its first president in nearly a decade arrived here
Wednesday escorted by at least 120 pickup trucks carrying well over
1,000 militia members armed with rifles, rocket launchers, even
double-barreled anti-aircraft guns. And just to be on the safe
side, the president wore a bullet-proof vest. Despite the fears,
the closest the new president, Abdikassim Salad Hassan, came to
harm was from Somalis a little too eager to show their affection.
For the new leaders of Somalia, elected during the last few weeks
at a peace conference in neighboring Djibouti, it was a hopeful
first step in restoring order and a central government to a nation
with neither since 1991. By Ian Fisher.

   SCI-ROBOTS-REPRODUCE (Undated) _ For the first time, computer
scientists have created a robot that designs and builds other
robots, almost entirely without human help or expertise. In the
short run, this advance could lead to a new industry of inexpensive
robots customized for specific tasks. In the long run _ decades at
least _ robots may one day be truly regarded as ``artificial life''
_ able to reproduce and evolve, building improved versions of
themselves. By Kenneth Chang.

THERE'S NOT MUCH TO LOVE IN `LOVE &AMP; SEX'
</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By ERIC HARRISON 
c. 2000 Houston Chronicle
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``Love &AMP; Sex'' is an intermittently funny comedy about an angry,
unfulfilled tall person who has lots and lots of sex. The tall
person is Famke Janssen, who has good cheek bones and is very
persuasive as an angry, unfulfilled tall person. Especially the
tall part.
</P>
<P>
   Her character, Kate, is a writer for a women's magazine. When
asked to write an article about relationships, she writes one
instead about the intricacies of a certain sex act at which she
apparently excels.
</P>
<P>
   ``I meant draw from your own experience and relationships,'' her
editor tells her.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's what I did,'' Kate replies.
</P>
<P>
   Kate has sex in restaurant men's rooms, and she engages in lots
of groping and smooching in public. None of this is particularly
sexy to watch.
</P>
<P>
   She has sex in lieu of relationships. This is told to us
repeatedly. Otherwise, we'd never guess there was any connection
between what one of her boyfriends calls her promiscuity and the
unhappiness she keeps talking about.
</P>
<P>
   The script doesn't really dramatize the ramifications. She talks
about ``living alone with four cats'' because she doesn't know what
makes relationships work. But we hardly ever see her outside of a
relationship. We see her with one boyfriend after another, starting
with her high school French teacher and progressing through to an
airhead actor, a painter, a guy who runs into her car, and on and
on.
</P>
<P>
   We never really get to know or to like Kate, because every time
we see her she's either wild with lust, crazy in love or grumpy. We
hardly ever even see her at work, even though the movie starts off
there with a work-related crisis.
</P>
<P>
   The movie _ the first for writer-director Valerie Breiman _
feels autobiographical in the same tired way that many first movies
and first novels feel drawn from life. It needed a mediating
intelligence to shape the raw material into a story that might
interest anyone whose initials aren't V.B.
</P>
<P>
   The painter, Adam Levy, is the boyfriend Kate is with the
longest. As played by Jon Favreau, he is a younger, stouter,
less-shaggy-haired Woody Allen. His personality, his gestures, even
his manner of speaking all are swiped from Allen, which makes it
only more painfully obvious that ``Annie Hall'' was the model for
this movie.
</P>
<P>
   That, like this, was a romantic comedy about a relationship
between two neurotics. It also was drawn from life and was narrated
by Allen at a point in the story where his relationship with the
title character was over. As Kate does in ``Love &AMP; Sex,'' he was
looking back, still in pain, but wiser for it.
</P>
<P>
   ``Annie Hall'' feels loosely plotted and casual, but this is
deceptive. Making a tightly constructed movie feel loose isn't
easy. Breiman's movie feels loose because it is. And having Kate
narrate the story (she's rehashing her past relationships for the
rewrite of that article) is a crutch. Kate tells us what the movie
should be showing us.
</P>
<P>
   What's more, Allen's Alvie Singer character was sympathetic. We
laughed at his neurosis just as we laughed at his jokes. Janssen's
Kate, on the other hand, is a bitter pill. The movie is set in Los
Angeles, but she's so tightly wound she should be in New York. She
lashes out at the slightest insult.
</P>
<P>
   Janssen used to be a fashion model. As an actress, she's good at
filling in the outline of her character with primary colors. She
can do angry, harried, happy, elated and bored. But there's no
shading, no layering or blending of hues. Nothing peeks out from
beneath her thickly applied brush strokes because, one suspects,
there isn't anything to peek out.
</P>
<P>
   It's obvious pretty early how a movie like this will end. The
fun, if there is any, is in the getting there. Most of the fun
drains out of this movie in the first 30 minutes. After that, it
becomes all too obvious why Kate's boyfriends don't stick around
because we don't want to either.
</P>

 &HT;    Led by McNabb, improving Eagles will be a tough test in Cowboys
opener
 &HT;    By Rick Cantu
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   IRVING, Texas _ It did not take Donovan McNabb long to become a
familiar face in Philadelphia.
</P>
<P>
   The second-year quarterback from Syracuse has his own radio
show. He has a weekly TV show that is filmed at his home.
Billboards promoting the Philadelphia Eagles sport McNabb's image.
</P>
<P>
   McNabb's light-hearted shows are a hit with fans and teammates
alike. The most important football player in Philadelphia has
become the man.
</P>
<P>
   Yep, the same man Eagles fans booed when he was picked over
Texas icon Ricky Williams in the 1999 draft.
</P>
<P>
   That was then. When Philadelphia and Dallas open the season
Sunday afternoon at Texas Stadium, McNabb's performance could spell
the difference between victory and defeat.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's a guy who can create something on a busted play,'' Dallas
cornerback Ryan McNeil said Wednesday. ``Our job is to be
disciplined, to not let him get outside. If a play's busted, it
should become a sack or an interception.... Is he a difficult
player to bring down? Yeah. Should it be difficult if we do our
job? No.''
</P>
<P>
   McNabb was the second player chosen in the 1999 draft, but was
not a major factor in Philadelphia's 5-11 season. He started six
games, completing 49 percent of his passes, including eight
touchdowns and seven interceptions. He is considered one of the
league's most mobile quarterbacks.
</P>
<P>
   When McNabb isn't spreading his charms on radio or TV, he is
scrambling to become the leader of an improving offense. Yet
getting him to open up about this week's opponent is like taking a
bone from a hungry dog.
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday McNabb had nothing but positive remarks about the
Cowboys. The Cowboys have an ``established'' defensive line, he
said. When asked if he will exploit rookie cornerback Kareem
Larrimore, he said no.
</P>
<P>
   McNabb is smart enough to know any negative comments will become
bulletin-board material in the Cowboys locker room.
</P>
<P>
   ``We really don't worry about what other people think (about the
Eagles),'' he said. ``Everyone has their own expectations. We have
goals and we'll do whatever we can to achieve those goals.''
</P>
<P>
   What are those goals?
</P>
<P>
   ``That something I keep to myself,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Many football experts project the Eagles to have a breakout
season. The strength of their schedule ranks last in the league,
McNabb has matured into an effective quarterback, and former Tampa
Bay right tackle Jon Runyan has emerged as leader of the improved
offensive line.
</P>
<P>
   There is pressure on Philadelphia to make the playoffs.
</P>
<P>
   ``You get pressure no matter what,'' Eagles coach Andy Reid
said. ``That's part of the job, part of the game. That includes
players, coaches, the front offense, (newspaper) writers.''
</P>
<P>
   A favorable schedule is one reason the Eagles will be 4-1 after
five games, one Philadelphia columnist wrote. First place in the
NFC East will be at stake when the Eagles take on 4-1 Washington in
week six.
</P>
<P>
   True or not, that is how many people see the Eagles.
</P>
<P>
   ``It really doesn't matter who we play (Sunday), but I think it
is a little bit of added incentive that some publications are
picking Philadelphia,'' Cowboys coach Dave Campo said. ``Starting
out in your own division adds a little significance to what you do
in preparation.''
</P>
<P>
   The Eagles were picked to finish 9-7 and in second place in the
NFC East by Sports Illustrated writer Paul Zimmerman, better known
as Dr. Z. He had the Cowboys at 8-8, fourth in the division.
</P>
<P>
   ``I like Dr. Z,'' Reid said.

 &HT;    Georgia Pacific seeks buyers for tissue, pulp mills
 &HT;    By Patti Bond
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA - Georgia-Pacific plans to sell several pulp and tissue
mills, including its large Brunswick mill, as it moves away from
the commodity side of the business.
</P>
<P>
   At least 11 mills in seven states are on the auction block.
Georgia-Pacific, which recently notified mill workers about the
pending sales, could not identify potential buyers because of
confidentiality agreements.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're in the divestiture planning process. We're proceeding
with discussions with potential buyers, but we've not made any
final decisions,'' said spokesman Ken Haldin.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the mills produce tissue and related products, including
a small plant in LaGrange that employs 130. Last month, the
Atlanta-based forest products giant said it planned to buy rival
Fort James and become the world's largest maker of toilet tissue
and paper towels. Georgia-Pacific agreed to get rid of at least
250,000 tons of tissue capacity to alleviate antitrust concerns.
</P>
<P>
   At the time of the Fort James announcement, Georgia-Pacific also
said it would shed operations that don't fit its new strategy as a
marketer of branded household products.
</P>
<P>
   Georgia-Pacific Chairman and Chief Executive Pete Correll wants
to focus more on finished products instead of raw materials.
</P>
<P>
   The company seems ready to yield its status as the
second-largest maker of pulp, which is prone to large price swings.
Two of its largest pulp mills, in Brunswick and New Augusta, Miss.,
are up for sale.
</P>
<P>
   The Brunswick plant, which employs 770, makes 700,000 tons of
pulp a year and is the company's largest pulp mill. Haldin said
Georgia-Pacific couldn't comment on the status of three remaining
pulp operations in Arkansas, Maine and Washington.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to the LaGrange plant, the tissue mills for sale
include plants in Arizona, Illinois, Indiana, New York and Vermont.
</P>
<P>
   Georgia-Pacific also wants to sell 5 million acres of timberland
to Seattle-based Plum Creek Timber Co.
</P>
<P>
   Ownership of pulp, paper and timber operations has shuffled
considerably this year due to several mega-mergers.
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday, Finnish-Swedish forestry group Stora Enso said
shareholders of U.S. Consolidated Papers have approved Stora Enso's
takeover bid. That creates the world's second-largest paper and
board producer behind International Paper-Champion International,
which merged earlier this year.

BLEDSOE CONFIDENT ENTERING BELICHICK-WEIS ERA 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MICHAEL MADDEN  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   FOXBOROUGH, Mass. _ At the start of last season, Drew Bledsoe
was ranked among the best National Football League quarterbacks. By
season's end, he was playing like the worst NFL quarterback.
</P>
<P>
   And if the irony is that it was the Bill Belichick's defensive
schemes with the Jets at the halfway point of the season that
helped turn New England from a 6-2 team with hope to an
indescribably inept offensive team the second half of the season,
all the while setting Bledsoe on a downward spiral like no other in
his career, it is now Belichick and his coaching staff that Bledsoe
turns to for his recovery.
</P>
<P>
   ``I won't go into the specifics of it because I don't want to
give away too much,'' Bledsoe said of offensive coordinator Charlie
Weis's system, ``but I think Charlie and I on offense believe in
some of the same things. I won't go into the specifics of exactly
what those things are, but one of the things that benefits Charlie
is that he has worked with a number of different (head coaches).''
</P>
<P>
   Bledsoe then chose to open up a bit.
</P>
<P>
   ``Charlie's also a younger guy who hasn't been around,'' Bledsoe
said. ``He doesn't have these ideas ingrained in his head from the
'70s and the '60s. He's a young guy who has his own ideas how to
attack somebody offensively.''
</P>
<P>
   A football Sherlock Holmes would not be needed to discern that
Bledsoe was thinking of his last coordinator, Ernie Zampese, who
was older and had derived many of his offensive schemes from former
Chargers coach Don Coryell and his air shows from the late 1970s
and early '80s.
</P>
<P>
   And that is a hint that Bledsoe might believe, as some did, that
Zampese's scheme was one of the reasons New England's offense
hitting rock bottom last season by early December. There were
Bledsoe bashers, blaming the quarterback for the offense's woes;
there were offensive line bashers, blaming the linemen for the
fierce physical throttling that Bledsoe took from defenders; and
there were Zampese bashers, who blamed the coordinator for not
adjusting to changing defenses.
</P>
<P>
   Whomever and whatever was at fault, though, it was abundantly
clear the second half of the season that New England's offense was
not attacking anyone. Instead, it was reacting to opposing
defenses. Even worse, it seemed the New England coaches and
offensive players had never seen a blitz before. Teams blitzed the
Patriots at will, and rarely paid the as New England seldom
adjusted.
</P>
<P>
   But Bledsoe paid a price. The quarterback was hammered, both
physically and mentally.
</P>
<P>
   ``Last year, through those eight games, I looked forward to each
one, with the next one being better,'' Bledsoe said.
``Unfortunately, I didn't have success and we didn't have success
through that stretch.''
</P>
<P>
   Some quarterbacks never recover their confidence after such a
beating. And confidence always has been Bledsoe's strongest weapon,
even stronger than his right arm. But Wednesday, Bledsoe reassured
all that what happened in the past is where it will stay . . . in
the past.
</P>
<P>
   ``What you have to do as an athlete in general, and as a
quarterback especially,'' he said, ``is forget what happened the
last play, the last game, the last season, and move on to the next
one. And I feel that has been a strength of mine, through high
school, through college, and in my NFL career. You know, move on
after the last one. That applies to my attitude toward last season
as well.''
</P>
<P>
   Whether that is easier said than done won't be known until the
regular season opens Sunday against Tampa Bay and in the following
weeks. Bledsoe, for his part, said he went back and studied film of
those horrid offensive games the last half of the season, trying to
find out what had gone wrong.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have gone back and looked back at a number of those games,
and the bad plays in particular,'' he said. ``During the offseason,
I went back and watched those, as painful as it was.''
</P>
<P>
   As his eighth season as New England's quarterback opens, Bledsoe
said he's eager to begin anew. What is different from past Patriot
offenses, though, is that Bledsoe seems to have fewer weapons at
his disposal, and many more questions, especially with the
instability on the offensive line.
</P>
<P>
   The only true threat on offense appears to be wide receiver
Terry Glenn and ``it's important for us that Terry touch the ball
often,'' said Bledose. But New England again has question marks at
running back, and this time tight end is an unknown, for the first
time since Bledsoe has been in New England. Weis's many formations
may have to disguise many problems.
</P>
<P>
   By late last season, when some Patriot watchers were so aghast
at what passed for a New England offense that they were yearning
for the days of Tony Eason, or even Mike Taliaferro, others were
creating a ruckus by calling for Michael Bishop, then a rookie, to
play more. That brouhaha caused barely a dent in Bledsoe's psyche.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the reason that it's easy for me is because of the
situation I'm in,'' he said. ``I don't think there's been a
question for a long time who's the quarterback of this team. I
don't think that's ever come into question. And, for that reason,
if we bring in Mike for a few plays here and there and help our
team score points, I've got zero problem with that.''
</P>
<P>
   As he has done for the last five or six years, Bledsoe Wednesday
spoke confidently of the offense and the team's prospects.
</P>
<P>
   ``Of course, we're capable of that,'' said Bledsoe when asked if
New England has a chance to make it to the Super Bowl. ``I really
believe that and I think everybody on this team does. I have
confidence and the team has confidence that we can go and compete
for a championship this year.''

PEDRO DOWNPLAYS NO-HITTER STATUS, BUT SOME WONDER... 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BOB RYAN  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Pedro says it's no big deal, that a no-hitter doesn't define a
pitcher's career, and, as usual, he is correct. Otherwise, we'd be
saying that such pitchers as Grover Cleveland Alexander, Lefty
Grove, Dizzy Dean, Steve Carlton, Early Wynn, Robin Roberts,
Ferguson Jenkins, Whitey Ford, and Don Sutton _ Hall of Famers, all
_ would have tarnished resumes.
</P>
<P>
   No-hitters are freaky. Anybody, absolutely anybody, can pitch a
major league no-hitter if the sun, moon, and stars are in the
proper alignment and baseballs are hit in the proper direction.
Alva ``Bobo'' Holloman threw a no-hitter in his first big league
start May 6, 1953. He won two more big-league games before fading
into obscurity.
</P>
<P>
   Was Ed Halicki a great pitcher? He threw a no-hitter. So did
Juan Nieves. And Bo Belinsky makes three.
</P>
<P>
   Yes, the chances are that if you are a certifiably great pitcher
you will throw one, sooner or later. If you're Vida Blue, it's
sooner. Vida was 21 when he no-hit Minnesota Sept. 21, 1970. But if
you're Warren Spahn, it's later. The great Spahnie was 39 and a
10-time 20-game winner when he no-hit the Phillies Aug. 18, 1960.
He apparently liked the feeling so much he felt compelled to throw
a second no-no 13 months later, this one against San Francisco.
</P>
<P>
   Cy Young threw three, including a perfect game. Walter Johnson
had one, against our Red Sox. Bob Feller had three. Christy
Mathewson had one, as did Carl Hubbell, Dazzy Vance, Ted Lyons, Bob
Lemon, Juan Marichal, Bob Gibson, Jim Palmer, and Tom Seaver.
Catfish Hunter had a perfect game. So did Jim Bunning as a Phillie.
He also no-hit the Red Sox.
</P>
<P>
   You wouldn't think a knuckleballer would throw a no-hitter, but
Hoyt Wilhelm and Phil Niekro each had one.
</P>
<P>
   Dizzy Dean never threw one, but brother Paul did in the second
game of an Ebbets Field doubleheader in which Ol' Diz had thrown a
three-hitter in the opener. ``Shucks,'' drawled, Diz, ``If I'da
knowed Paul was gonna throw one, I'da throwed one, too.'' Or words
to that effect.
</P>
<P>
   Way up in some unimaginable realm, Sandy Koufax had three no-nos
and a perfect game in four years. Then there's Nolan Ryan, who was
the personification of a guy with ``no-hit stuff.'' He retired with
seven, the last in 1991, when he was 44.
</P>
<P>
   Great. But can anyone explain how Bill Stoneman (54-85 lifetime)
threw two?
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, even though Hideo Nomos and Kent Merckers and Chris
Bosios can throw no-hitters, we are coming up to the 35th
anniversary of both the last no-hitter thrown by a Red Sox pitcher
and the last no-hitter thrown by anyone at Fenway Park.
</P>
<P>
   If anyone tells you he or she saw the last no-hitter at Fenway,
demand proof. On Sept. 16, 1965, the  &UR; afternoon &LR;  crowd was 2,370
when 22-year-old Dave Morehead no-hit the Cleveland Indians to
raise his season's record to 10-16. That's correct: 2,370, broken
down as follows: 1,247 paid, 1,019 guests, and 104 Ladies Day.
</P>
<P>
   Morehead was a kid from San Diego _ Ted Williams's high school,
no less _ who had a good, live fastball, a knee-buckling curve, and
absolutely no command of either pitch. He had come up in 1963, even
though he wasn't really ready. On those Red Sox teams, any live arm
was a good arm.
</P>
<P>
   His mound opponent on that September afternoon was Luis Tiant,
who had allowed just one hit through five. Then Jim Gosger singled
and Dalton Jones tripled for the first run. An inning later, Lee
Thomas, now a Red Sox executive, hit his 20th homer of the season.
</P>
<P>
   Morehead had been working with pitching coach Mace Brown on a
more compact delivery, and on this occasion everything was in
synch. He had walked Rocky Colavito on a 3-2 pitch in the second,
but there were no other base runners as the game moved into the
eighth.
</P>
<P>
   Cleveland skipper Birdie Tebbetts wasn't going down easily. He
pinch hit Bill Davis for Pedro Gonzalez to conclude the eighth (a
fly to center) and then came back with three more pinch hitters in
the ninth. Larry Brown, batting for Duke Sims, lined to short. Lou
Clinton (a former Red Sox), batting for Tiant, flied to center. One
out to go.
</P>
<P>
   Tebbetts's choice to bat for Dick Howser was the crafty, pesky,
irritating, and downright dangerous Venezuelan Vic Davalillo, who
was just the type of speedy player you don't want up in a situation
like this. The count went to 0-2, at which point Tebbetts called
time in order to have a chat with his batter.
</P>
<P>
   ``Don't take anything close,'' he ordered.
</P>
<P>
   Nine years after the fact, Tebbetts, good baseball man that he
was, was carrying the memory of Dale Mitchell being called out by
Babe Pinelli on a borderline pitch to complete Don Larsen's World
Series perfect game. He obviously thought the pitch should have
been ruled ball three. He assumed that Bill McKinley would
similarly ring up his man on anything remotely looking like a
strike.
</P>
<P>
   The pitch came and Davalillo tapped it back to the box on one
hop. The ball hit off the heel of Morehead's glove and rolled a
foot or two toward the third-base line. Morehead scrambled after
it, and came up throwing. It was a very low throw, but Thomas
scooped it, with Davalillo, according to the Globe's venerable
Roger Birtwell, ``20 inches, perhaps less,'' from the bag.
</P>
<P>
   What did the no-hitter mean for Dave Morehead's career? Nothing.
He lost his last two decisions in '65, and he eventually came up
with the proverbial sore arm. He would only win 12 more games. The
man who one overly exuberant friend of mine believed to be the
``righthanded Sandy Koufax'' finished his eight-year career with a
record of 40-64.
</P>
<P>
   But he had his no-hitter, despite Birdie Tebbetts's best efforts
to stop him. ``Nobody who saw this game can ever say Morehead
didn't earn it,'' Birdie chirped.
</P>
<P>
   Two years later, Billy Rohr came within one out of a no-hitter
in Yankee Stadium. Rick Wise likewise came within an out of a no-no
in 1976. Marty Pattin, Steve Renko, and Frank Viola have all gotten
through eight no-hit innings. But no one, not Tiant, not Roger
Clemens, not even Pedro Martinez has been able to throw one for the
Red Sox since Morehead did it nearly 35 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   A no-hitter doesn't change anything or even mean it was anything
more than a reasonably well-pitched game. You could, in theory,
throw a perfect game with 27 line drive outs. Would we have ranked
Tuesday night's performance ahead of the 17-strikeout one-hitter
against New York that wasn't even a shutout? Uh-uh. But I've got to
believe Pedro still wants one. He may not know who Bobo Holloman
was, but he's aware of Jose Jiminez. No way he wants that chump
with a no-no on his dossier while Pedro is still waiting to get one
for himself.
</P>
<P>
   The only thing we ask, Pedro, is to make sure you do it at home.
Oh, and it would sure help out us press guys if you'd do it in the
daytime. Finally, a personal note. Wait till next year, OK? I'd
sure hate to be in Sydney when _ and it is when, not if _ you do
it.

MSN TO OFFER HIGH-SPEED INTERNET ACCESS THIS FALL 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ALEX PHAM  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Making another run at America Online Inc.,
Microsoft Corp. will begin offering high-speed Internet access in
the fall, coupled with a makeover of its MSN online portal.
</P>
<P>
   The project, dubbed ``MSN 2001'' within the company, is aimed
squarely at luring Web surfers away from AOL.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are going to leapfrog AOL,'' said Mike Nichols, MSN's
product manager, Wednesday. ``We think we have a product that is
superior to AOL.''
</P>
<P>
   AOL, the nation's largest Internet service provider, has more
than 23 million users. MSN has just 3 million, despite having been
in existence since 1995.
</P>
<P>
   MSN is also targeting an estimated 14 million first-time Web
users who are expected to sign up for Internet access over the next
12 months. By emphasizing simplicity and ease of use, AOL has
traditionally fared well with first-time users.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft, based in Redmond, Wash., hopes to mimick AOL's
success by revamping its portal _ to be called MSN Explorer _ to
make it friendlier for new users. Colorful, rounded icons will
replace plain-text tabs, making MSN look more like a browser and
less like a Web site. The browser will contain more customized
information, such as local weather reports and news. A multimedia
player on the lower left hand corner will let users listen to
Internet radio or watch videos while surfing the Web. MSN's instant
messaging will also let users make free long-distance calls over
the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   ``It looks very good,'' said Bruce Kasrel, senior analyst at
Forrester Research in Cambridge. ``I'm impressed. But it's going to
take more than a good browser to get people to switch'' from AOL.
</P>
<P>
   MSN hopes to one-up AOL by offering high-speed Internet access
in major metropolitan areas, including Boston, starting this fall.
The company is currently testing the high-speed service in Boston,
San Francisco, and Dallas. The vast majority of AOL customers rely
on dial-up access, which is considerably slower.
</P>
<P>
   Access to MSN will be provided via digital subscriber lines
(DSL) by a network of local providers contracted by MSN. Consumers
in outlying areas with no access to DSL will have access through
high-speed satellite service from Gilat Satellite Networks Ltd., an
Israeli company in which Microsoft has invested $50 million.
Nichols declined to say how much MSN will charge for high-speed
service.
</P>
<P>
   Despite massive investments by Microsoft over the years, MSN has
languished behind AOL. Part of the problem has been Microsoft's
ambivalent, piecemeal approach to the Internet. MSN started five
years ago as a proprietary service with no access to the Web.
Later, it provided Web access, but then began to produce original
entertainment, an expensive gambit that failed to add substantial
numbers of new subscribers. Meanwhile, Microsoft launched Web sites
and services that were not well integrated, such as Hotmail,
Expedia, MSNBC, Gaming Zone, and Money Central.
</P>
<P>
   The new MSN promises to ``put these loose offerings together and
make it much more easy and seamless for users,'' Nichols said.

SECURITY EXPERT SEES LEAK WITH MICROSOFT OFFICE SUITE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By HIAWATHA BRAY  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The next time you read a document prepared with the popular
Microsoft Word program, the document may also be reading you.
</P>
<P>
   Computer security expert Richard Smith says he's found a feature
in Word that allows a document to transmit information about the
person reading it over the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   The same feature exists in other parts of Microsoft Corp.'s
Office software suite, including the Excel spreadsheet program and
the PowerPoint presentation graphics program. Documents created
with these programs, if used on a machine connected to the
Internet, can transmit the ``IP address'' of the reader's computer.
By entering the IP address in an online directory, it's possible to
find out the owner of the address.
</P>
<P>
   For example, Smith said a government agency could embed a ``Web
bug'' in a Microsoft Word document in order to keep track of where
it's being read.
</P>
<P>
   Suppose a whistle-blower leaks a copy of the document to a
Boston Globe reporter. If the reporter reads the document on a
computer attached to the Internet, a copy of his IP address is
instantly relayed to the government agency. By running an IP
address look-up, ``They could know (that) somebody at the Boston
Globe is reading this document,'' Smith said.
</P>
<P>
   Scott Culp, of Microsoft Corp.'s Security Response Center,
described the issue as ``much ado about very little.''
</P>
<P>
   Culp said that Smith has not discovered a security bug in Word.
Instead, it's an inevitable consequence of making the program
capable of interacting with the Internet, he said. Whenever a
program exchanges data over the Internet, it must send out its IP
address in order to receive a reply. All Internet-enabled office
software programs, from Microsoft or any other firm, will do the
same thing, Culp said.
</P>
<P>
   Smith, of Brookline, Mass., agreed other products probably
transmit IP addresses but said he hasn't tested them.

<P>
   BOSTON _ Sherri Lynne Mack of Boston, a graphic designer and
management consultant, died Friday at Beth Israel Deaconess Medical
Center after a three-week illness. She was 40.
</P>
<P>
   Born in Seattle, she studied communications at Santa Clara
University in California, where she joined the Delta Sigma Theta
sorority. After graduation she pursued her master's degree in media
and communications management at Emerson College in Boston.
</P>
<P>
   When she arrived in Boston in 1983, she became active in the
public-service activities of the Boston chapter of her sorority,
which included community outreach through Crittenton-Hastings
House, Project Homeless, Jabberwock, and the Social Action
Committees.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Mack was also an organizer of The Supper Club, a group of
black professional women.
</P>
<P>
   She had a great love of books and reading, and wanted people
with special needs to have the same pleasure. For several years she
was a volunteer reader for the Commonwealth of Massachusetts
Commission for the Blind. In this role she would record novels and
textbooks for visually impaired people.
</P>
<P>
   Her spirit of volunteerism led her to share her talents as a
graphic designer and desktop publisher with the People's Voice
Newspaper. She was also a member of the President's Circle at Beth
Israel Deaconess Medical Center.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Mack's experience as a self-employed management consultant
enabled her to teach desktop publishing, Web and graphic design at
various adult education centers in the Boston area.
</P>
<P>
   She was active at Bethel African Methodist Church in Boston's
Jamaica Plain neighborhood.
</P>
<P>
   She leaves her parents, Daniel and Sandra Mack of San Jose,
Calif; a brother, Ronald Miles of San Jose; a sister, Lori (Melvin)
Howard of Oakland, Calif.; and her two grandmothers, Wilma D. Wiles
of Altadena, Calif., and Seberia Mack of Seattle.

 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ J.D. Salinger's daughter has written a book that
reveals previously unknown and deeply intimate aspects of the
famously private writer's life, including that he fears the female
body, abstained from sex as a young man to achieve enlightenment
and drank urine as a home remedy.
</P>
<P>
   His daughter, Margaret, also writes in her memoir, ``Dream
Catcher,'' that her father, who was a counterintelligence agent in
World War II, was briefly married to a woman he had arrested as a
Nazi Party functionary.
</P>
<P>
   And when he was a teen-ager, Salinger discovered that his mother
was not Jewish, as he had been brought up to believe, but Irish
Catholic, his daughter writes. The book is due out Sept. 6 from
Pocket Books.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Salinger, in an intervew at the Plaza Hotel in New York,
said she wrote the book to make sense of her strange childhood,
adding that she is willing to take the risk that her father might
not speak to her again. She has taken precautions _ like staying at
the hotel under an assumed name _ against the possibility that her
father will try to stop her from publishing the memoir.
</P>
<P>
   Salinger, 81, who has not published anything since 1965 and has
not spoken publicly for years, is so determined in his seclusion
that he successfully delayed the publication of a biography because
the writer had sought to use some of his letters.
</P>
<P>
   Her father was pathologically self-centered, Ms. Salinger says.
Nothing could interrupt his work, which he likened to a quest for
enlightenment. He was also abusive toward her mother, Claire
Douglas, Ms. Salinger says, keeping her a virtual prisoner in his
house in Cornish, N.H., refusing to allow her to see friends and
family.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Salinger said that when Ms. Douglas was pregnant, her father
found her abhorrent. She said that since her parents rarely had
sex, she feels her birth was almost an accident.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Salinger also says that when she was 13 months old, her
mother planned to kill her and commit suicide, and later did indeed
burn the house down. Ms. Salinger said her mother denied setting
the fire.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Douglas is now a Jungian analyst in California and ``a
terrific grandma,'' Ms. Salinger said. She did not respond to
messages left on her answering machine.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, her father pursued Scientology, homeopathy and
Christian Science, drank urine and sat in an orgone box, Ms.
Salinger writes. And he spoke in tongues, fasted until he turned
greenish and as an older man had pen pal relationships with
teen-age girls, she writes.
</P>
<P>
   Her parents divorced in 1966.
</P>
<P>
   Does her father know about her book? ``He does now,'' said Ms.
Salinger, because of newspaper articles. Has she spoken to him
since then? She laughs. ``I may be 44,'' she said, ``but I still
don't want to get yelled at.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, ``it's not unusual at all to not speak for several
months,'' said Ms. Salinger. ``We're not officially estranged,''
she said. ``What other people might call weird is just regular for
us.''
</P>
<P>
   Her father loves her, she said, but ``he probably hates my guts,
too, I would say, operatically.''
</P>
<P>
   Salinger's agent, Phyllis Westberg of Harold Ober Associates,
said he would not comment on Ms. Salinger's book.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Salinger refused to give the name of her husband or son, or
give her son's age. She said she wrote ``Dream Catcher'' because
``I was absolutely determined not to repeat with my son what had
been done with me.''
</P>
<P>
   There is one moment that stands out above all, she said. ``It is
so horrible, it's so powerful.'' When she was pregnant and sick,
instead of offering help, her father ``said I had no right to bring
a child into this lousy world,'' she writes, ``and he hoped I was
considering an abortion.''
</P>
<P>
   From her Aunt Doris, her father's sister who is six years older
and in failing health, Ms. Salinger said she learned about her
father's childhood as Jerome David Salinger, son of Miriam and Sol
Salinger, who became a prosperous food merchant in New York. Jerome
was the center of his mother's life, Ms. Salinger said her aunt
told her. But Miriam was also overprotective. Salinger once wrote
in a letter to Hemingway that his mother walked him to school until
he was 24, Ms. Salinger said.
</P>
<P>
   During World War II he was a counterintelligence agent assigned
to the Twelfth Regiment of the Fourth Division, interrogating
POW's. He served in the most brutal campaigns of the European
theater, including D-Day and the Battle of the Bulge. In 1945 in
Germany he was hospitalized for ``battle fatigue.''
</P>
<P>
   In one of the book's surprises, Ms. Salinger writes that her
father arrested a young Nazi Party functionary, Sylvia, then
married her. The marriage was brief, and forever after he referred
to her as Saliva.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Salinger's parents met in 1950 when Claire Douglas was about
16 and Salinger about 31. At the time Ms. Douglas and Salinger met,
he abstained from sex, her mother told Ms. Salinger, because he was
studying with an Indian mystic who taught that it interfered with
enlightenment.
</P>
<P>
   Just months before her high school graduation, Ms. Douglas
married Salinger and moved with him to Cornish. Ms. Douglas told
her daughter that he demanded elaborate meals and that the sheets
had to be laundered twice weekly, though there was no heat or hot
water. When her mother became pregnant, Ms. Salinger writes, she
fell into ``a suicidal depression when she realized that her
pregnancy only repulsed him.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Salinger was born in 1955, and her father, she says, seemed
more comfortable in the magic world of childhood. Her imaginary
friends were real to him, too, she says, as were the characters in
his books. ``The world of fiction and reality were very blurred,''
she writes.
</P>
<P>
   But, her mother felt ``jealousy and rage over my replacement of
her in my father's affections.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1960 the Salingers had a son, Matthew, who is now an actor
and producer in California. Last month The Sunday Times of London
quoted him as saying of his sister: ``I guess she's got a lot of
anger. But to write a book just isn't right. It's kind of
pathetic.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Salinger says she does not believe he said it: ``I love my
brother dearly. It just doesn't sound like him.''
</P>
<P>
   Attempts to reach him by telephone or through friends were not
successful.
</P>
<P>
   In the mid-1970s, Salinger had a relationship with Joyce
Maynard, a journalist, who was two years older than his daughter.
Salinger induced Ms. Maynard to leave college and live in isolation
with him, Ms. Maynard wrote her 1998 memoir, ``At Home in the
World'' (Picador, 1998), which included details of her romance with
Salinger when she was 18 and he was 53.
</P>
<P>
   To Ms. Salinger it was a repeat of his relationship with her
mother.
</P>
<P>
   Today Salinger is married to his third wife, Colleen, a nurse,
some 50 years younger than he. Ms. Salinger writes that her father
berates Colleen, as he did her mother.
</P>
<P>
   Salinger still lives in Cornish. He is still writing, and lives
on royalties. ``Catcher in the Rye'' sells ``at least'' 250,000
copies annually, his daughter said.
</P>
<P>
   She said she did not know why her father has refused to publish
his work. ``My aunt thinks he can't stand any criticism,'' she
said. ``He sure doles it out.''

BUSH FINDS SNOWLESS NEW HAMPSHIRE CAN OFFER WARM WELCOME 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By GLEN JOHNSON  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   HAMPTON, N.H. _ Seven months after George W. Bush limped out of
New Hampshire nursing the wounds from his primary defeat, the Texas
governor returned for a stroll down memory lane.
</P>
<P>
   There was a rally at the airplane hangar where he had a Super
Bowl Party, a campaign speech along the Seacoast, and a reunion
with his bus driver John LaBombard, who ferried the Texan across
the state in the midwinter darkness and chill.
</P>
<P>
   Not only had the snow melted and his political consultant, Tom
Rath, shed 19 pounds, but the Republican presidential contender
said he felt he had a good chance of winning the state in this
fall's general election. He also repeated his assessment that his
18-point loss to Arizona Senator John S. McCain in the primary had
made him a better candidate.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think my message was defeated; I think John McCain
won,'' Bush said in an interview Tuesday evening as a green carpet
of trees and farms scrolled past his airplane window and the sun
stretched into the western horizon. Moments earlier, the governor
looked down on his flight from Portland, Maine, while the jet
crossed the coast directly over the Bush family compound in
Kennebunkport.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it helped in New Hampshire to have had a tough race
because, I think, the people got to see me handle the pressure of
defeat. ...Some of politics is the ability for the voter to get a
feel for the candidate, what they're like in good times and
no-so-good times, how they handle pressure,'' Bush added. All the
while, he fidgeted with a laminated, wallet-sized copy of the
electoral map.
</P>
<P>
   Bush said he had ``no idea'' whether he would participate in the
Oct. 3 presidential commission debate proposed for Boston. He said
he would not skip it solely because Massachusetts is a Democratic
stronghold and his face-off with Vice President Al Gore would be
held at the University of Massachusetts at Boston, just across
Columbia Point from the John F. Kennedy Presidential Library.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd rather have it at the Bush library,'' he joked, referring
to the Houston facility honoring his father, former President Bush,
``but nevertheless, I understand.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush also said he did not take offense as Gore criticizes the
quality of life in Texas, a tactic that recalls how Vice President
George Bush attacked Governor Michael S. Dukakis during the 1988
presidential election. The elder Bush repeatedly questioned the
``Massachusetts Miracle,'' the state's inmate furlough program, and
the cleanliness of Boston Harbor.
</P>
<P>
   ``I expect it. What the heck, I understand the give-and-take of
politics. I understand you can take a set of numbers and make 'em
sing or make 'em dance either way,'' the governor said. ``I think
it offends some of my fellow Texans, particularly the Democrats
that helped me get the initiatives through.''
</P>
<P>
   In a conversation Wednesday, Bush also said he talked about
``Catholic issues'' with former Boston Mayor Raymond L. Flynn while
in New Hampshire. The conversation took place Tuesday night during
a GOP fund-raiser in Rye, N.H. Bush said he was unsure if Flynn, a
Democrat who served President Clinton as Vatican ambassador, would
endorse his candidacy.
</P>
<P>
   ``You'll have to ask him that,'' the governor said. ``I was
honored he asked to meet with me.'' Campaign aides described it as
part of their outreach efforts. Flynn did not return two calls
placed to his home.
</P>
<P>
   As much as the 15 1/2-hour visit to New Hampshire late Tuesday
and Wednesday morning was a political venture, it was also journey
back in time for the governor and his entourage.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've never seen this place without snow,'' cracked one network
cameraman as Bush's chartered Boeing 727 settled onto the runway at
the Pease International Tradeport in Portsmouth.
</P>
<P>
   When the plane rolled to a stop, the welcoming party was much
the same it had been each time Bush arrived from Iowa or some other
early-voting state: state campaign chairmen Robert Thomson(CQ) and
Barbara Russell, and Rath and his fellow Republican National
Committee member, Ruth Griffin. US Senator Judd Gregg, Bush's guide
dog in New Hampshire, flew in with the governor.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's so nice to see you without overcoats,'' Rath said to Bush
communications director Karen Hughes, who greeted him with a hug.
``It's just so great to be back here,'' replied Hughes, who
commented on Rath's newly svelte figure. All the while, Bush shook
hands along a rope line erected in a barren Pan Am hangar that in
January rocked with a campaign Super Bowl party.
</P>
<P>
   Like the governor, Rath discounted Bush's loss in February, and
cited recent polls showing him leading Gore in the state.
</P>
<P>
   ``New Hampshire is at a different point in the process than a
lot of places, and it was sending a message out in terms of, `You
need to work hard to get at this thing,' that they didn't want it
over quite that early,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday, Bush visited Winnacunnet High School in Hampton to
deliver an education speech. He unveiled a $6.7 billion plan to
make college more affordable, principally through an expansion in
the number and size of Pell Grants for tuition.
</P>
<P>
   While at the school, he was reunited with LaBombard, a
56-year-old from Enfield who had driven Bush across New Hampshire
in his $300,000 custom motorcoach.
</P>
<P>
   The bus is outfitted with three TVs, a Jenn-Air stove, cherry
paneling, and a high-capacity heater, its driver recalled how Bush
would frequently wear a jacket because of the thinness of the
Texan's blood.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm very glad New Hampshire was a steppingstone for him,''
LaBombard said. ``It was a wakeup call, and he's done well since.
I'm 100 percent confident he'll make it all the way.''

<P>
   MOGADISHU, Somalia _ Somalia finally has a government, and its
first president in nearly a decade arrived here Wednesday escorted
by at least 120 pickup trucks carrying more than 1,000 militiamen
armed with rifles, rocket launchers, even double-barreled
anti-aircraft guns.
</P>
<P>
   And just to be on the safe side, the president wore a
bullet-proof vest.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the fears, the closest the new president, Abdikassim
Salad, came to harm was from Somalis a little too eager to show
their affection _ and overjoyed that their country might finally be
leaving behind years of civil war.
</P>
<P>
   Salad arrived at midday a downtown soccer stadium packed with
tens of thousands of people cheering and waving sprigs of small red
flowers.
</P>
<P>
   He tried to speak. But after just a few words, he was nearly
crushed by well-wishers, forcing him to flee the stadium, jostled
around the eye of a dangerous storm of happy people.
</P>
<P>
   ``The new president _ too much they like him,'' said Sandal
Agdige, 31, an unemployed driver who had just pried himself loose
from the swarming crowds at the stadium.
</P>
<P>
   For the new leaders of Somalia, who were chosen during the past
few weeks at a peace conference in Djibouti, the country to the
northwest, it was a hopeful first step in restoring order and a
central government to a nation with neither since 1991. The
conference had been organized by Djibouti's president, Ismail Omar
Guelleh, who also spent much of his nation's meager resources on
it, eager to see stability brought to the region.
</P>
<P>
   The immediate worry for Salad's safety arose because of the
warlords who have divided power in the nine years of chaos, and who
in recent weeks have vowed to oppose the new government. Some had
said they would even physically block the arrival of its new
leaders.
</P>
<P>
   But nothing happened on this first day. Some militiamen aligned
with the warlords even bucked their leaders to greet Salad, who
said his first day back home as president convinced him that this
new government would work.
</P>
<P>
   ``The people of Somalia are fed up with wars, violence, killing,
tribalism,'' said Salad, 58, in an interview later in the calm of
his hotel room in north Mogadishu. ``You have seen the people, many
thousands, hundreds of thousands, of people. No one can have fear
if he is surrounded by such well meaning crowds.''
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   For some in the entourage that flew in on two chartered
airplanes from Djibouti _ many of whom had not been to Somalia for
10 years or more _ it was a moment of high emotion.
</P>
<P>
   ``I must be honest with you, this was really overwhelming,''
said Ali Khalif Galaydh, also 58, a former government official who
left Somalia in 1982 and has since taught at Harvard and Syracuse
universities. Khalif, a member of the new Somali assembly and a
leading candidate to be prime minister, added that the reception
showed ``how hungry people are for good news.''
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday was only a tentative victory, and a reminder of the
huge job before Somalis, whose last government crumbled in civil
war when its long-time dictator, Siad Barre, fell from power in
1991. Three of the main warlords in Mogadishu happened to be out of
town, meeting with the president of Yemen, who was trying to
persuade them to support Salad. But they remain a threat.
</P>
<P>
   Even if the warlords end up on Salad's side, the streets that he
drove through Wednesday served as one vivid indication of how
scarred Somalia remains from its civil war and a later attempt by
the United Nations to feed the hungry in the early 1990s. On one
main road, twisted and rusty cars are piled up along the median. On
another lay the skeleton of a United Nations armored vehicle. Trash
is scattered everywhere, in a once-beautiful sea-side city with no
central electricity, water, police or schools. The outside world,
exhausted with Somalia, has not been eager to help.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is a very difficult task,'' Salad said in the interview.
``We need everything. Every sector is in shambles.'' In fact,
Salad's presidency is itself but an idea. He does not even have an
office to work out of, much less an organized army to command or
any government ministers to manage.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, Salad's transitional government must still deal with
the leaders of two autonomous regions in the north who have refused
to recognize his authority. The regions, Somaliland and Puntland,
had gone their own way and established relatively peaceful pockets
outside of the violence of Mogadishu.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   The new president must also contend with the nearly impossible
expectations of Somalis, who seem to believe a government will be
panacea for all their problems.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't have a job,'' said Aweys Salad, 18, no relation to the
president, at the stadium. ``When I get a government I will get
everything I need. I want an education. We need education.
Education is the light of the world.''
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Salad was elected during the weekend in an unusual peace
conference of more than 2,000 Somalis _ a cross-section of Somalis
and representatives of every clan _ who had gathered in Djibouti
for five months of touchy negotiations. During that time, they
managed to create a national charter _ something like a
transitional constitution _ and chose a temporary capital, the
southern city of Baidoa.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Salad was chosen by a 245-member assembly also formed in
Djibouti, which will sit for three years as a transitional
government before national elections. The conference purposely
sidelined the warlords, one reason for their opposition. Though
Somalis often talk about the dangers of clan _ the tribal groupings
that have divided the nation _ one of Salad's main qualifications
was, in fact, his background: He is a leader of the Hawiye clan,
more specifically the Habr Gidir subclan, that dominates in
Mogadishu, the main area of unrest.
</P>
<P>
   But Salad, a trim man with still black hair and a greying beard,
had also campaigned on a law-and-order platform attractive to many
Somalis. He has close ties to the Islamic courts _ with their own
police and jails _ that were established in the past few years. And
he has support among Mogadishu's increasingly influential business
community, which pushed for peace as a bottom line for making
money.
</P>
<P>
   He also gained credibility in the election because, unlike some
candidates, he lives in Mogadishu, and in recent years had overseen
a broad effort to re-unite the Hawiye. He is said to be personally
tough and dogged, and, in the interview, he outlined an ambitious
vision for transforming Somalia from a sick state into one of the
leaders of the Horn of Africa, itself a region of instability.
</P>
<P>
   Salad's critics point to his long career in the Barre regime,
which he served for the better part of 20 years in a succession of
top posts, including minister of the interior. Saying he committed
no crimes, Salad contended that Somalis understand that his
generation is the last with actual experience running a government.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's up to the people of Somalia to judge,'' he said.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Wednesday, Somalis said they were fervently behind Salad. Many
paraded the streets with photocopies of a flattering portrait
pasted to signboards. Children waving branches chanted: ``Who is
the winner? Abdikassim!''
</P>
<P>
   ``We are very happy,'' said Okash Sugow Mohamed, 29, holding a
flower in front of a truck filling with people waiting to see Salad
at the stadium. ``Before our survival was very low. Today, I think
I become full.''
</P>
<P>
   Salad plans to stay in Somalia until Saturday, before leaving
for Egypt to meet with the Arab League, then to New York to visit
the United Nations.

A WARRIOR WHOSE ONLY CHARM IS HIS LACK OF IT
</HEADLINE>
  (For release Sunday, September 3)  
 (Editors: Also See SHAKESPEARE-FIENNES-THEATER)  
 By MATTHEW GUREWITSCH    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Among Shakespeare's tragic heroes, Coriolanus stands apart. The
others seduce us. This one _ Rome's greatest warrior turned Rome's
fiercest scourge _ scorns even to try. When his city casts him out,
he joins forces with the enemy, sparing his compatriots not out of
clemency but out of deference to his gorgon mother.
</P>
<P>
   The play to which he lends his name, though praised by a
handful, is loved by few. Nor does his character find many
defenders. Yet as a comrade in arms, the man shines like a beacon:
To the courageous, a guardian angel; to the craven, a holy terror.
</P>
<P>
   Who forgives Coriolanus his righteousness, or his vicious
temper? In the field, against the enemy Volscians, he takes no end
of punishment, expecting no special credit (most certainly not
panegyrics) for his matchless deeds, and that is a sort of hubris.
But what does his tragic flaw amount to beside the self-lacerating
intellect of Brutus, who slaughters his beloved Caesar?
</P>
<P>
   Beside the ambition of Macbeth, who dispatches a sainted
monarch? Beside the jealousy of Othello, who murders a blameless
wife? Hamlet's indecision, Mark Antony's self-indulgence and King
Lear's vanity cause no end of calamity, to themselves and others.
Still, we suspend judgment, captivated by their gift for metaphor
or philosophical speculation. Coriolanus goes his way alone; his
soul has little music, maybe none.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps the Almeida Theater Company's production of
``Coriolanus,'' directed by Jonathan Kent, which begins
performances at the Brooklyn Academy of Music on Sept. 9, will
challenge entrenched opinion. The title role is entrusted to Ralph
Fiennes, the protagonist also of the Almeida's ``Richard II,''
which will alternate with ``Coriolanus.'' Not that Fiennes is an
actor to trade on easy charm. Yet deep within his tense, careworn
stage persona runs a streak of pathos that exercises a powerful
seduction of its own. In London, at the point in Act V where
Shakespeare's stage direction has Coriolanus holding his mother
``by the hand, silent,'' Fiennes grabbed her hand, kneeling and
sobbing.
</P>
<P>
   Shakespeare's departures in ``Coriolanus'' from his standard
practice are radical _ so much so that studies of the play tend
reflexively to switch focus from figure to ground. The clashes
between patrician and plebeian at the center of the tragedy are
indeed in an epic class by themselves: An anatomy of the body
politic at its most disordered, conducted with an icily impartial
hand. At a historic production in Paris in the 1930s, riots broke
out between Fascists and Communists. Each side was convinced that
Shakespeare was affirming the justice of their own party line and
exposing the bad faith of their opponents. (Or was it the other way
around?)
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
nn
</P>
<P>
   Against the excitement of the crowd scenes and in the absence of
poetically arresting language, what becomes of those specifically
tragic stirrings of compassion for the hero, which Aristotle
ascribed to pity and terror (and Shakespeare to woe and wonder)?
The view of Frank Kermode in the Riverside Shakespeare epitomizes
received wisdom: ``We never feel that the author allows the hero to
come very close to him or to us, but in spite of his keeping
Coriolanus at a critical arm's length, Shakespeare can rarely have
more fully extended his powers than he does here.''
</P>
<P>
   At critical arm's length? Seen another way, not even in the
scarcely endurable ordeals of the outcast Lear does Shakespeare
probe a heart more feelingly. In fact, in certain respects, his
achievement in ``Coriolanus'' is more extraordinary than in
``Lear.'' Lear's existential trajectory teaches him (and us) what
it means to be a human being against the backdrop of indifferent,
unfeeling Nature. It is a lesson the outcast sovereign learns at a
few seconds to midnight, at a threshold of mortality (``fourscore
and upward''), from which the playwright, the actor and presumably
the vast majority of viewers feel safely detached. Any
identification with him (if identification is quite the word)
remains contemplative, theoretical.
</P>
<P>
   In Coriolanus, by contrast, we encounter a man of action in the
prime of life, a condition that most of us (wishfully or
accurately) equate with our own. Yet even at the pinnacle of
autonomy, he hovers at the edge of the abyss: A man yet still a
boy, a law unto himself yet, to his credit. of ``woman's
tenderness'' in the face of the wife and son he has tried in vain
to banish from his heart. Humbling, even humiliating knowledge,
frightening to witness. Kermode calls Coriolanus a ``beast-god,''
meaning a monster. Our brother, rather. In the entire tragic canon,
Shakespeare tells no sadder story, or one that cuts closer.
</P>
<P>
   For all the reviled hero's faults, much counts in his favor.
Presumption and malicious detraction rile him, but he acknowledges
good will, loses bets like a gentleman and praises his Volscian
nemesis without reserve. He invades an enemy city single-handed,
but leaves the room rather than hear his deeds praised. He knows no
greed or envy. Only under extreme provocation does he speak up in
his own defense. His affections run deep, as evidenced when he
dries his wife's tears coming home from the wars. As for his
refusal to coax or charm by diplomacy or fine language, this, too,
redounds to his credit. Like Cordelia, Lear's true-hearted youngest
daughter, rejected for plain speaking, he lacks ``That glib and
oily art/ To speak and purpose not,'' and finds an eloquence in
silence _ his most revealing moments are seldom his loudest. His
rare sallies into metaphor _ in exile he gives his address as ``th'
city of kites and crows'' _ are terse and often harrowingly to the
point.
</P>
<P>
   The embodiment of the forces that destroy Coriolanus from within
is Volumnia, his mother, unlike any other in Shakespeare. Romeo and
Juliet have mothers, for all the good it does them. Richard III has
one, for all the good it does her. Lady Macbeth seems to be one,
though no offspring are in evidence, and of the specters that haunt
her husband, childlessness torments him most. Of Shakespeare's
handful of mothers with grown sons to manage (notably Gertrude, in
``Hamlet,'' and the Countess of Rossillion, in ``All's Well That
Ends Well''), Volumnia alone shows the muscle for the job.
</P>
<P>
   To all Rome, her son is Coriolanus, a name fresh-earned in blood
by the walls of the enemy town of Corioles. To Volumnia, who
flutters out to meet him as the troops return, all the while
thanking the gods for the wounds and scars he bears, he is ``my boy
Martius.'' Tullus Aufidius, general of the Volscians, on whose
mercy Coriolanus casts himself when the Roman rabble drives him
out, calls him ``boy,'' too, with lethal consequences. ``When blows
have made me stay, I fled from words,'' the hero confesses early
on. And words, not swords, are the weapons that destroy him.
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately for Volumnia, and in part for her son, her powers
do not work at a distance. The first of their two pitched battles
of will occurs in the wake of his reluctant campaign for the office
of consul, a political honor incompatible with his temperament or
his talents. Custom demands that a candidate stand forth publicly
in a ``gown of humility,'' showing passers-by his war wounds and
soliciting their votes, or ``voices.'' Coriolanus submits and wins
election, but his half-heartedness and sarcasm as he goes through
the distasteful motions give the Machiavellian tribunes of the
people all the ammunition they need to nullify the vote.
</P>
<P>
   ``Have I had children's voices?'' the outraged consul-elect
demands, characteristically counting on men to live up to their
word. Before long, the mob is baying for his blood. The only hope
for Coriolanus at this pass would be to make a calculated show of
contrition, a self-inflicted disgrace he consents to only after
Volumnia has played the most powerful card in her manipulative
deck: The threat of walking out.
</P>
<P>
   From the strategic point of view, she has only been making
sense. To her son, the appeal to expediency spells utter betrayal,
a trampling of the very values by which she has taught him to live
his life. He predicts that he will botch the charade (Shakespeare's
allusions to actors are seldom complimentary), and, sure enough, he
does. Once back in the public world of men, it takes the tribunes
the single word of ``traitor'' to goad Coriolanus to frenzy, with
his banishment the speedy result.
</P>
<P>
   When mother and son meet for the last time, he is leading the
Volscian army against Rome. Does this make him a traitor? Readers
have said so, but not the appalled patricians in the play, who see
his revenge as deserved retribution. Neither do the spineless
plebeians, who wring their ineffectual hands, or even the
unprincipled tribunes, whose wan hope is that the dreadful news
will prove false.
</P>
<P>
   Yet here Volumnia grasps the real monstrosity of his position.
Once again, though in a nobler cause, she goes the distance. Once
again, her boy capitulates at last, consenting to a peace that must
cost him his life. The flexible Aufidius, in whose rotten code of
honor Coriolanus has naively placed his faith, sells him out for
personal gain. As a last indignity, the butchered warrior is
subjected to his killer's cold epitaph:
</P>
<P>
   Though in this city he
</P>
<P>
   Hath widowed and unchilded many a one,
</P>
<P>
   Which to this hour bewail the injury,
</P>
<P>
   Yet he shall have a noble memory.
</P>
<P>
   What is it Mark Antony says over the corpse of Caesar? ``The
evil that men do lives after them,/ The good is oft interred with
their bones.'' So let it not be with Martius.

SHOWING ON A TV NEAR YOU 
</HEADLINE>
   (For release Sunday, September 3)  
 By ELVIS MITCHELL    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   One of the great things about having pay cable is the
opportunity it provides for discovering little films that were
denied theatrical release. Films like the awkwardly titled ``And
Then You Die,'' a hard-as-pig iron 1987 gangster drama that used to
pop up on HBO well past the shank of the evening.
</P>
<P>
   For its first five minutes, ``Die,'' which charts the
treacherous skirmishes between warring Quebec mobs, works solely in
somber and gripping imagery, neatly sketching out the conflicts; it
was superbly directed by Francis Mankiewicz. It's an instance where
you can literally see the filmmaker running out of money and the
picture eventually compromised by budgetary shortfalls, though the
director's control is evident throughout.
</P>
<P>
   Several of the films directed by John Dahl _ including ``Red
Rock West'' and ``The Last Seduction'' _ were first seen on pay
cable. Unreleased pictures made by major talents are going with
increasing frequency to the small screen. When ``Picking Up the
Pieces,'' a movie starring Woody Allen and directed by Alfonso
Arau, makes its debut on Cinemax, it's safe to say that the feature
film landscape has undergone a continental shift.
</P>
<P>
   A flimsy comedy with a core of magical realism, ``Picking Up the
Pieces'' went without distribution until it showed up earlier this
year on pay cable _ though the outlet's motivation was to score a
coup rather than to improve the level of its programming. Not all
films having their premieres on cable can be so quickly dismissed.
``Things You Can Tell Just by Looking at Her,'' which made a splash
on the film festival circuit this year, was swiftly acquired for
theatrical distribution at the Sundance Film Festival by MGM. It
has a noteworthy cast _ Cameron Diaz, Calista Flockhart, Glenn
Close and Amy Brenneman _ playing women who drift in and out of one
another's lives. Taking its shape from ``Short Cuts,'' Robert
Altman's collaboration with Raymond Carver, ``Things'' was directed
with a lighter-than-air touch by the newcomer Rodrigo Garcia. Yet
MGM decided that the film could never find an audience in theaters,
and it will slip into the world on Showtime in its first run, on a
date yet to be announced.
</P>
<P>
   The cast delivers a few inspiring performances; Amy Brenneman is
singular, and her work deserves a place on the big screen. The
movie is certainly as good as ``Autumn in New York,'' which MGM
foisted upon an unsuspecting public a few weeks ago. The problem is
that despite the record number of movie screens in the United
States, there are also a record number of independent films being
made. As you read about the notice some of them receive, but
realize they will never appear at a local theater, it's easy to
become dispirited.
</P>
<P>
   One such film _ which will get a berth in theaters in October
but is currently showing on Cinemax _ is ``Animal Factory,''
directed by Steve Buscemi and adapted from the Edward Bunker novel
of the same name. This fluky prison drama follows Ron (Edward
Furlong) and his assimilation into a large state prison, where he's
mentored (for lack of a better word) by the veteran inmate Earl
(Willem Dafoe, whose shaved head for the role makes his sharp
features look even more whittled). Despite his ropy build and
no-nonsense jaw line, Earl isn't the cliched kindly-but-tough
convict, nor is Ron the standard-issue fish needing to be schooled
in the ways of the prison yards. ``Animal Factory'' spares us the
baroque and picturesque tortures of something like ``Oz,'' the
gritty HBO prison series in which rape and assault appear so often,
they should be listed in the credits. ``Factory'' follows the
day-to-day dehumanization of the convicts and the tricks they
invent to get through a single day. Buscemi again reveals the fluky
timing and concern for the psychology of misfits that made ``Trees
Lounge,'' his 1996 directorial debut, such a pleasure; ``Animal
Factory'' actually plays like a novel.
</P>
<P>
   ``Panic,'' directed by Henry Bromell, is going the way of films
that will never be seen in a theater, heading straight to Cinemax.
It's the story of a troubled hit man (William H. Macy) who is
trained to follow his murderous father (Donald Sutherland) into the
family business but who also tries to keep it from affecting the
lives of his young son and his psychiatrist (John Ritter).
</P>
<P>
   It's the relationship between Macy's conscience-stricken killer
and Sutherland's amoral father that gives ``Panic'' a prickly
dynamic. The Macy character seems rational, but his composure is
only skin deep, and his attempt at order is failing him. There's
the stink of moral rot coming off the character played by
Sutherland, who has lately become a master at playing brusque,
manipulative father figures; his turn as the coach in ``Without
Limits'' ranks among the best work of his career, and his
performance in ``Panic'' is on a similar level.
</P>
<P>
   Bromell's ability to tell a story is a bit more advanced than
his directing skill at this point, but he's smart enough to stay
out of the way of his narrative and not weigh it down with
unnecessary stylization. He's interested in his protagonist, a guy
who thinks of himself as decent until he's forced to recognize his
life through the eyes of his own child. Although the claustrophobia
of ``Panic'' lends itself nicely to television, it's a shame that
we may never get to see how Bromell's tightening intensity might
play in a theater. The dilemma offers both good news and bad:
audiences will finally get to catch these pictures, but not the way
the filmmakers intended.

 &HT;    drkoop.com Inc. cuts work force even further
 &HT;    By Andrew Park
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas - Just a week after taking over, the new
management at Austin's drkoop.com Inc. has pulled the plug on 42
employees, thinning the company's already skinny ranks by about a
third.
</P>
<P>
   The move _ which cuts drkoop.com's work force to where it was
before the company went public last year _ will further reduce
costs and allow it to concentrate on generating revenue, President
Edward Cespedes said.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the remaining 79 employees will devote their time to
sales. Cespedes said the company would look to form partnerships
with hospitals and physicians' offices and sell advertising space
to pharmaceutical companies. Projects that weren't bringing in
money have been disbanded.
</P>
<P>
   ``This organization that we inherited was not focused on any one
goal,'' he said. ``We want to refocus the company around sales.''
</P>
<P>
   But some analysts say it will take more than new financing to
nurse drkoop.com back to health because the content-based site
relies too heavily on advertising sales.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is obviously a good thing that they are trying to reduce
unnecessary costs and get rid of nonessential personnel, but that's
not going to change the tide. It's a good, smart, effective
managerial thing to do, but it's not central to whether or not the
company will be able to make it,'' said Claudine Singer, senior
health-care analyst with Jupiter Communications.
</P>
<P>
   Cespedes and two other venture capitalists assumed management of
drkoop.com last week when investors committed a cash infusion to
the company.
</P>
<P>
   The investors _ California-based Prime Ventures, Austin's Eco
Associates and three other venture firms _ raised their investment
to $27.5 million Monday. The new investors have named six directors
to the reconfigured eight-seat board of directors.
</P>
<P>
   While the decision to cut back staff was not made until after
the new investors took over, it was an inevitable move as they
struggle to rein in expenses, Cespedes said.
</P>
<P>
   At its peak in March, drkoop.com employed 220 people, but began
losing many as its financial prospects dimmed in the spring.
</P>
<P>
   As it acknowledged that it had run through much of its cash, the
company laid off 30 people in May and 11 more in June, and most of
the top executives left by summer.
</P>
<P>
   As of Monday, the company had 103 full-time workers and 27
part-timers. Cespedes said the company would not have any more
layoffs.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we've done everything we need to do to move forward,''
he said. ``We are now in a position where we have plenty of
money.''
</P>
<P>
   But the newest layoff was the nail in the coffin of drkoop.com's
popular community programs. The site once featured scores of weekly
chat rooms centered around common health conditions and it employed
full-time staff as well as part-timers and volunteers as hosts.
Drkoop.com will discontinue the chats, though it might consider
reviving the section with chats created by another company,
Cespedes said.
</P>
<P>
   Separately, ProLink Management of Spicewood filed a lawsuit
against drkoop.com Tuesday in Travis County Court, alleging that it
is still owed money from an agreement the two companies made last
year to sponsor a series of professional tennis tournaments. The
suit claims that drkoop.com owes ProLink $6.1 million under the
contract, which was extended until 2003.

ROBOTS CREATED BY COMPUTER `BORN' IN BRANDEIS LAB 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DAVID L. CHANDLER  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe

<P>
   One of them pulls itself along a tabletop like a cross between
an inchworm and a swimmer doing the breast stroke. One uses a
strained two-legged gait while dragging its body along the surface,
while another skitters sideways like a crab.
</P>
<P>
   These odd-looking blobs of white plastic at Brandeis University
are not capable of doing anything useful. But they could be the
first wave of a true revolution in the young but burgeoning field
of robotics.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike any robot ever built before, these creatures were not
designed or built by human beings. They ``evolved'' inside a
computer, and the computer then selected the most successful
designs after hundreds of generations, and directed their
manufacture through a kind of three-dimensional printing machine.
</P>
<P>
   Only at the end of the process were humans required, to perform
a midwife's role in delivering these creatures into the world by
snapping motors into place on plastic arms.
</P>
<P>
   In short, this is the first true demonstration of robots that
evolve and even reproduce sort of like living creatures. But don't
be alarmed, the researchers say: Humans will continue to run the
show for the foreseeable future.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a long-awaited and necessary step towards the ultimate
dream of self-evolving machines,'' according to Rodney Brooks,
director of the Artificial Intelligence lab at the Massachusetts
Institute of Technology and one of the world's leading robotics
experts. He wrote a commentary in the current Nature accompanying
the paper describing the robots.
</P>
<P>
   Jordan Pollack, the Brandeis computer scientist who carried out
this project with mechanical engineer Hod Lipson, said the goal of
the research is to move toward robots that are cheap, abundant, and
capable of doing a host of specialized functions _ anything from
clearing minefields to mowing your lawn.
</P>
<P>
   ``Robotics, I think, has been on the wrong path for 50 years,''
Pollack said in an interview. He aims to set the whole field
straight.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, the robots he has produced so far aren't good for
anything in particular. The only thing they can do is move, and
they aren't even all that efficient at doing that. But, claims a
press release from Brandeis, ``The experimental machines now being
born in the Brandeis University DEMO Laboratory may well be to
robotics what Kitty Hawk was to aviation.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, the robots produced in this experiment are pretty
primitive, even compared to other robots. They consist of only four
elements, combined in different ways: cylinders, ball-and-socket
joints, motors, and control circuits. The basic nature of these
components is programmed into the computer, which then ``evolves''
new robots by combining any number of these building blocks in
different ways.
</P>
<P>
   The only measure of ``fitness'' used in the computer's
evolutionary program was the ability to move, measured as the
distance the robot was from a starting point after a given
interval. The program contained no guidance on how to produce this
motion, leaving that up to the trial-and-error process of
evolution. The computer was also programmed with the basic laws of
physics so that whatever the devices did on the screen would work
the same way in the real world.
</P>
<P>
   Then, the designs that seemed fittest were selected to be
automatically built by the rapid prototyping machine, which builds
them up from a quick-setting plastic, one layer at a time. Finally,
the motors and controller chips were snapped on by the researchers,
who then set the devices free on a tabletop world to see if they
behaved the way they had on screen.
</P>
<P>
   In virtually all previous robots, Pollack said, engineers built
the device first, and then software engineers figured out how to
program its actions. But that's not the way things work in the
world of biology: ``In nature, there never is a body without a
brain, flopping around on the ground waiting for a control
system,'' he said. Instead, the Brandeis team's approach is
``co-evolution, with incremental changes in the body and the
brain'' taking place together.
</P>
<P>
   Robots with the flexibility and intelligence to perform a whole
array of basic human tasks remain very far off, he said. ``The
field of robotics is still $100 billion shy, and centuries away,
from creating an all-purpose intelligent humanoid like Star Trek's
Commander Data,'' Pollack says.
</P>
<P>
   But if this work really succeeds, he said, ``we can do for
disposable robots what Bill Gates did for software releases: Make
them so affordable that everyone can own 100.''

BABY GETS LUNGS FOR TRANSPLANT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By LARRY TYE  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ Rachel Sweet has gotten the lungs she was waiting for,
and the new lease on life they hopefully will bring.
</P>
<P>
   The 6-month-old with hazel hair and blue-grey eyes has been
struggling for weeks to stay alive at Children's Hospital while her
parents and doctors made a national plea for a donor set of lungs.
That call was answered sometime during the past two days, and
Wednesday night the hospital announced that Rachel was in critial
condition but had ``tolerated the surgery well.''
</P>
<P>
   The New England Organ Bank declined to say where the lungs came
from, who donated them, or even when they arrived. The secrecy, it
said in a statement, is ``out of respect for the anonymity of the
donor family.''
</P>
<P>
   Rachel's family, however, has done everything it can to get out
the word about her illness and the fact that, without new lungs,
she would likely die soon. The infant had been in Children's
intensive care unit, with tubes pumping food into her stomach,
medicine into her arm and belly, and oxygen into her nostrils.
</P>
<P>
   Her condition is called alveolar dysplasia, which, together with
her pulmonary vascular disease, means that she has too few air sacs
to breath normally and that the ones she has do not work right.
Simply breathing took tremendous energy and put pressure on her
heart and other organs. It also impeded her physical and mental
development, although her doctor said that her prospects were good
if she got a lung transplant.
</P>
<P>
   Rachel's donation coincided with Tuesday's call by Pope John
Paul II for more people to donate their organs. But the pope's
plea, in a speech in Rome to 4,000 transplant specialists, is up
against imposing trends. Falling rates of violent and accidental
deaths, combined with rising numbers of people living long, healthy
lives, are shrinking the pool of suitable donors. In New England,
the list of those awaiting organs is 3,500 long, and nationwide
there are 71,000 on the list, with a new one added every 14
minutes.
</P>
<P>
   If Rachel recovers the way they hope, Stacey and Michael Sweet
plan to take her back to their home in Barnstead, N.H. _ a home
that, because of her hospitalization, she has lived in for only one
of her six months.

MAKING THE MOVIE   THEY LET YOU MAKE 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Attn: Wash., Calif.)   By JAMIE MALANOWSKI   (For release Sunday, September 3)  
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ To hear Chris McQuarrie tell it, the origins of the
new film he wrote and directed, ``The Way of the Gun,'' lay in
disgruntlement, frustration and anger. We pick up the story about
four years ago, shortly after he was awarded the Oscar for his
screenplay ``The Usual Suspects.'' At that point, the project that
most enthralled McQuarrie, who appears to be one of those
formidably intelligent people who can produce a trove of well
thought out, cogently stated reasons in support of his opinions,
was to direct the life story of Alexander the Great.
</P>
<P>
   But the then 27-year-old McQuarrie, author of a screenplay that
was nonpareil in its genre, was finding no one who would let him
direct a movie about a 20-year-old who had conquered the world.
``It was probably a bad idea to pursue that as the first film,'' he
now grudgingly concedes. ``But I decided if I wanted to direct that
I should direct other films first. So I came up with ideas for some
smaller films. But literally every time I would go to a meeting,
the only interest anybody had in me making a film was if it was a
crime film. But I didn't want to be the crime guy. So I started
lowering my price, and then I started lowering my back end'' _
money to be earned through foreign distribution, cable television
or video sales _ ``and then I started lowering my standards, and
finally it got to the point when I was in a meeting and I said, `I
will take no salary, I'll take no back end, I'll eat craft service
and I will live in the jungle while I make this movie. You decide
the budget and the casting, as long as you let me make the film I
want to make.' They still said no.''
</P>
<P>
   After that meeting, a frustrated and fairly furious McQuarrie
went for coffee with the actor-writer-director Benicio del Toro and
the producer Ken Kokin, both of whom had worked on ``The Usual
Suspects.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I was feeling completely miserable,'' McQuarrie recalled
recently during a visit to New York, ``and I said, `That's it, I'm
going to quit this whole business, I'm going to go write books.'
Benicio said: `It seems that they're willing to let you make a
crime film. If you want to say what you want to say, you have to
make the movie they want you to make. Why don't you make a crime
film?' So I conceded that he was right, and we started thinking
about a crime film.''
</P>
<P>
   But not happily. ``This movie was written from a place of real
anger,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   As del Toro explained later by telephone: ``Sometimes you get to
a point where you think everything is going to be easy, but then
there's another mountain to climb. He has so much talent. He just
had to use it before time passed him by.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The Way of the Gun,'' which opens Friday, is the story of two
sociopaths, Parker and Longbaugh, played by Ryan Phillippe and del
Toro, who decide to kidnap a surrogate mother (Juliette Lewis) and
hold her and her unborn child for ransom. As it turns out, the
kidnapping becomes a bloody mess, and, what's worse, the man for
whom she is carrying the child is mob connected. Soon the screen is
populated by a number of very dangerous men, portrayed by Taye
Diggs, Nicky Katt and an understated James Caan, none of whom has a
motivation that can be described as unalloyed. The movie is tense
and twisty; it should now be harder for McQuarrie to avoid being
called the crime guy.
</P>
<P>
   The idea for the movie was a marriage of del Toro's coffee shop
comment that he had never seen a really interesting kidnapping
movie, and a casual remark on the part of McQuarrie's wife. Heather
Neely McQuarrie, a film producer who also served as the costume
designer for ``The Way of the Gun,'' happened to mention an article
she had read about an executive with a much younger wife who hired
a surrogate mother so they could have a child.
</P>
<P>
   ``They were perfectly healthy,'' said McQuarrie, ``but she
didn't want to ruin her body. They hired bodyguards for the
surrogate mother. Well, as soon as I heard `bodyguards,' the movie
very easily unfolded. I wrote the first draft in about five days.''
Anger included.
</P>
<P>
   Apart from his personal difficulties, he was angry about the
film industry's insistence on sympathetic characters. (Many
executives found fault with Alexander's precipitous and
unattractive post-conquest, third-act decline.) ``I can't tell you
the number of times I've heard, `Well, you'll lose the audience if
that character does that,''' he said. ``It's maddening. It
completely takes away the ability to make a three-dimensional
character. They want films about crime, but they don't want
characters who are criminals. No one ever asked me to change the
fact that Person A killed Person B. They just wanted me to give
Person A a good reason, a reason why Person B deserved to die. And
I found that deplorable, that Hollywood's answer to toning down
violence was to work harder at making violence more acceptable, as
opposed to taking violence out.
</P>
<P>
   So when I sat down to write this film, I said fine, if I'm going
to write a crime film, I'm going to make a film about criminals.
Parker and Longbaugh are unapologetic, unqualified thugs who really
don't care who they're hurting or what they have to do to get their
way. When my agent read it, he said we're not even going to bother
taking it to the studios. They'd have wanted it rewritten. They'd
have wanted that scene _ that inevitable, awful scene _ in which
the characters explain why they are the way they are and end up
blaming somebody else so that you can find them acceptable.''
</P>
<P>
   Attentive readers will recognize Parker and Longbaugh as the
real surnames of Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid. That's part of
McQuarrie's demythification: Butch and Sundance are pop culture
criminal names; Parker and Longbaugh are blotter names, docket
names.
</P>
<P>
   Phillipe said: ``What I remember about reading the screenplay is
that as soon as I finished, I started reading it again. So much was
conveyed, on so many levels, and you couldn't see things coming. I
knew it would be a lot of fun to say his words.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Chris has a gift for storytelling,'' said del Toro. His
charismatic, not-too-talky performance in this film calls to mind
James Coburn's in ``The Magnificent Seven,'' only James Dean-ier.
``People could spend years writing and never write a line as good
as his.''
</P>
<P>
   McQuarrie said that watching movies was ``about all I did'' as a
boy. ``A friend and I would take the newspaper every Friday and we
would plot the movies that were opening, and we would line up all
the times so that we could hit one after the other, right down to
the time it would take to travel from one theater to the next,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   But his career in movies almost didn't happen. He was reared in
Princeton Junction, N.J., and although he liked to write, he was a
poor student and never aspired to college. Instead, he traveled a
bit, then took a temporary job, for his uncle's security agency.
</P>
<P>
   He was mostly a security guard, working, for example, in New
Jersey patrolling the construction site of the Freehold Raceway
Mall. After four years, he was about to join the New York Police
Department _ the broad-shouldered McQuarrie, who speaks in a low
rasp, would have been a formidable interrogator _ when he got a
call from a high school buddy, Bryan Singer, who was just out of
film school. Singer admired McQuarrie's writing and shared his
critical sensibility. Singer had money from investors to direct a
movie if only he could come up with a screenplay in 15 days. So
McQuarrie went to work, and three months later they were making a
thriller, ``Public Access'' (1992), about secrets in a small town.
Three years later they made ``The Usual Suspects.''

NEW YORK: ``Usual Suspects.''  
<TEXT>
<P>
   McQuarrie brought fairly firm ideas to his first job directing.
His heroes are John Huston, John Sturges, John Ford and Sidney
Lumet _ ``all directors who stay out of the way.'' In a similar
way, he is firm about the shortcomings he perceives in his initial
effort. ``The films that inspired the visual style of `The Way of
the Gun' are `Bad Day at Black Rock,' `The Man Who Would Be King'
and `The Magnificent Seven,''' he says. ``In all of them the camera
remains as far back from the action as possible and just captures
the drama. And then when I got there I realized I didn't know
enough to create that drama. This film is a visual history of me
learning how to direct.''
</P>
<P>
   The hardest part was taking charge. ``There's two kinds of
people in the film business,'' he says. ``Those for whom it is much
easier to say `please,' and those for whom it is much easier to say
`no.' The people who say please cannot ever say no. I was a please
person. As a writer, you kind of have to be. You work to include
everybody's vision in your work. Whereas when you're a director,
you have to include everybody's work in your vision. I had to
become a person who says no. But there I was, on the set, trying to
include every idea, giving the actors every single opportunity to
do what they wanted. And they were having a great time, but the
movie was getting further and further away from where it needed to
be.
</P>
<P>
   ``Finally James Caan called me aside and said: `Let me tell you
something. Actors like to be directed. They need direction.' He
said: `This is your film. Quit messing around, and go tell those
people what to do.' And that's what I started to do. But it was
very difficult. I felt most like the novice.''
</P>
<P>
   Del Toro, for one, disagrees. ``I never saw it,'' he says. ``I
say he looked like a director who was doing his 10th film.'' One
day it was determined del Toro's character needed to steal a car,
only there wasn't one with fake windows available. ``He just led us
out to the street and had me smash a real window,'' del Toro
recalls. ``He was commanding. It was thrilling.''
</P>
<P>
   One person director McQuarrie had no trouble saying no to was
screenwriter McQuarrie. He happily tells about a scene in which
Parker in a long monologue explains to the surrogate mother how he
and his partner differ from her and other ``civilians.'' ``He tells
her that she has a lie she tells herself so that she can get out of
bed in the morning,'' McQuarrie explains, ``And it's a lie that
says there's only two ways that you die _ that it was your time, or
that you had it coming. But, he says, guys like Parker and
Longbaugh know that there's only one way you die, and that's that
you were in the way.
</P>
<P>
   ``As we go in, Ryan asks for a sandwich _ he wants to be eating
in the scene. He does the scene beautifully _ he's phenomenal. When
he finishes, I let the camera run. There was a long silence, and
then Juliette ad libs, `Are you going to eat the rest of that
sandwich?' And then he ends up giving her half the sandwich. And it
was great.
</P>
<P>
   ``But when we got to the cutting room, I realized that was the
first time they'd really spoken to one another, and he wouldn't
have told her those things. So we cut the monologue and kept the
sandwich. And I was perfectly content. This was one of the places
where I was venting my anger. Once I was in the cutting room, I
could tell the difference between what was anger and what was
story.''
</P>
<P>
   This McQuarrie is a tough-minded fellow: reputations could be
built on what he throws away.
</P>
<P>
   McQuarrie is considerably less angry today. ``I've accepted that
when people hire you to write a screenplay, it's not your movie,
it's their movie,'' he says. He is currently working on a
screenplay for ``The Green Hornet.'' He and his wife have recently
settled in Seattle and are expecting their first child. ``I don't
know how I lived in Los Angeles for eight years,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most people there are frightened, but they're never frightened
of the things that can actually kill them, the earthquakes and the
fires and the gangs. They're oblivious to that. What they're afraid
of is their status and people's impressions of them.'' He says he'd
like to direct again; in the end, he says, it was fun. And he's
still interested in Alexander the Great.

IRS LIMITS DEDUCTIONS FOR KIDNAPPED CHILD 
</HEADLINE>
  (EDS: This story, held yesterday, is now released for publication;
this is a slightly expanded version of the story.) 
 By DAVID CAY JOHNSTON   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   The taxpayer's question started out poignant, then turned
pragmatic: My child has been kidnapped. Can I still take a
deduction on my income tax return? The answer this week from an IRS
lawyer was matter of fact: only for the year the child was
abducted.
</P>
<P>
   The taxpayer asked an IRS customer service representative in
April about the exemption for the 1999 tax year. The taxpayer also
asked if the exemption could be claimed in future years if the
child's room was being maintained and money was spent on a search.
</P>
<P>
   In a reply that the agency released Monday, George Baker, an IRS
lawyer, said that in the year of the kidnapping, Congress allows
the tax break. But in subsequent years no exemption can be claimed,
he wrote, because the tax law generally requires a parent to
provide more than half the support for a child to qualify. The IRS
did not identify the questioner, saying tax matters were private.
</P>
<P>
   Baker's advisory opinion acknowledged that ``the issue is not
free from doubt''; the lawyer said he could not find a case that
addressed these issues directly. But he relied heavily on a 1980
U.S. Tax Court case in which Ebrahim Otmishi sought an exemption
for a child, Jeiran, who had been abducted by Otmishi's wife, Mina
_ or, alternatively, to deduct the costs of hunting for his child
as a theft loss. The court ruled against him.
</P>
<P>
   Several tax experts said yesterday that they agreed with the
lawyer's advisory opinion _ though not all were confident how long
it would stand. ``Now I expect we will see Republicans and
Democrats racing each other to show how much they care about
kidnapped children by fixing the law before the elections,'' said
Lee Sheppard, a tax lawyer known for her acerbic critiques of tax
policy in the journal Tax Notes.
</P>
<P>
   Many missing children, experts say, have been taken by a parent
denied custody in a divorce. A study by the National Center for
Juvenile Justice, a private research group in Pittsburgh, found
that 24 percent of abductions were by strangers and the rest by
relatives or friends.
</P>
<P>
   Even so, a parent holding a child in such circumstances probably
would not qualify for a tax deduction _ and a kidnapper who was a
stranger certainly would not _ under a 1958 law in which Congress
denied dependent exemptions when ``the relationship between such
individual and the taxpayer is in violation of local law.''
</P>
<P>
   Jonathan Barry Forman, a University of Oklahoma law professor
who specializes in family tax matters, said he was surprised at the
IRS position.
</P>
<P>
   He pointed to an IRS regulation that lets the parents of a
newborn who remains hospitalized list the child as a dependent on
the theory that, but for the medical condition, the child would be
part of the household. By applying the same reasoning, the IRS
could let parents of abducted children claim the deduction, Forman
said.
</P>
<P>
   The IRS legal memo is consistent with the agency's actions in
the case of 12-year-old Johnny Gosch, who was kidnapped by a
stranger in front of five witnesses in Des Moines in 1982. His
mother, Noreen Gosch, said the family's tax return was audited in
1986 and the exemption claimed for Johnny was denied.
</P>
<P>
   ``The IRS agent was very cruel,'' Gosch said. ``She said, `Your
son chose to not live at home so you can't get an exemption for
him,' and we reminded her that he was taken from us. And she said
that was beside the point _ that if he wasn't living with us we
could not get an exemption for him.''
</P>
<P>
   Gosch and the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children
appealed to a variety of officials, but the auditor's decision
stood, she said. Johnny has never been found.
</P>
<P>
   Taxpayers claiming an exemption for a child must list the
child's Social Security number on their tax return. In 1999,
taxpayers could deduct $2,750 from their adjusted gross income for
each dependent.
</P>
<P>
   The IRS has a system to check its records for the addresses of
parents suspected of kidnapping their own child and to release
information to law enforcement.
</P>
<P>
   Ransom paid to recover an abducted child is deductible, the IRS
ruled in 1972. It said such payments were treated as theft losses
due to extortion.

CELLUCCI INTRODUCES CONTROVERSIAL TEACHER AID PLAN 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By SCOTT S. GREENBERGER  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ Saying Massachusetts is at a ``crossroads'' in its
seven-year school-reform effort, Gov. Paul Cellucci offered state
money Wednesday to boost the salaries of much-needed math, science
foreign language teachers and proposed a major expansion of
teacher-training programs outside traditional schools of education.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking at a Malden elementary school in what was billed as the
Commonwealth's first-ever ``State of Education'' speech, the
governor also promised that, despite alarmingly high MCAS failure
rates, he will not abandon the test as a graduation requirement.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some have already called for the suspension of the test or
easing of the standards,'' Cellucci said. `` But I will continue to
insist on high standards _ our children deserve nothing less.''
</P>
<P>
   Cellucci's proposals, which he unveiled without price tags, were
warmly received by most of the 400 people invited to the event in
the Beebe School auditorium. But a dozen anti-MCAS protesters
picketed outside, and some in the audience were unimpressed by the
governor's ideas.
</P>
<P>
   Stephen E. Gorrie, who heads the Massachusetts Teachers
Association, said the governor should concentrate on raising the
salaries of all teachers, not just a select few. And he cast doubt
on the quality of many alternative teacher-training programs, such
as the intensive, seven-week Massachusetts Institute for New
Teachers that Cellucci wants to expand.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're very very hesitant to back programs that will allow
people in the classroom who are not properly trained,'' Gorrie
said. ``Just knowing your subject is not all there is to
teaching.''
</P>
<P>
   Cellucci was joined on stage by Lieutenant Governor Jane Swift,
whom he designated as a sort of ``education czar'' _ although the
administration rejects that title.
</P>
<P>
   Swift will assume a leading education role at the beginning of a
critical school year: This year's 10th-graders will be denied a
high-school diploma if they don't pass MCAS by the end of the 12th
grade.
</P>
<P>
   Swift, who has been meeting for the past seveal months with
educators and others involved in reform efforts, will continue
those discussions and release a report this fall on how to improve
student performance.
</P>
<P>
   In her remarks, Swift reiterated her call for volunteer tutors
to help every one of the 30,000 10th-graders expected to fail the
test in the spring of 2001. She didn't provide additional details
on how to find them, however.
</P>
<P>
   ``State government is a partner in this important endeavor, but
we cannot do it alone,'' she said. ``Today we are providing an
opportunity for everyone in this state to get involved.''
</P>
<P>
   Cellucci's proposals are designed to counter a looming teacher
shortage caused in part by a graying teaching force and a red-hot
economy. Math, science and foreign-language teachers traditionally
are the toughest ones to find, and Cellucci's salary proposal is
designed to attract and keep them.
</P>
<P>
   Gorrie noted that many teacher contracts around the state
already allow districts to pay slightly higher salaries to those
teachers. But Michael Sentance, Cellucci's chief education adviser,
said the governor is proposing a far bolder approach _ and much
higher salaries.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not talking about putting them higher on the same pay
scale _ we're talking about blowing it up'' Sentence said. ``Steve
thinks inside the box. We're not talking about inside the box.''
</P>
<P>
   Cellucci said in his speech that any district that demonstrates
to the state that it will pay more to math, science and
foreign-language teachers could qualify for state money ``to offset
increased costs.'' But the governor's office couldn't provide
specific amounts, saying that would depend on how many districts
are interested and how much money ends up in the state budget for
the program.
</P>
<P>
   James A. Peyser, who chairs the State Board of Education, said
it makes sense to pay teachers based on ``market conditions.''
</P>
<P>
   ``If there are too few math teachers, we need to pay math
teachers more,'' he said. ``There is a role for the state to play
in topping off teacher salaries, but it ought to be targeted.''
</P>
<P>
   But even some math teachers worry about what such a program
would do to teacher morale.
</P>
<P>
   Marianne Moran, a math teacher at Methuen High School and the
state's reigning Teacher of the Year, said the proposal is logical
because many math teachers' skills would command much higher
salaries in the corporate world. But she said other teachers may
find the pay difference hard to swallow.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's difficult to give some of us more when we're all
underpaid,'' Moran said.
</P>
<P>
   In Malden, Cellucci also touted his alternative teacher-training
initiative as a way to deal with potential teacher shortages. Such
programs, he said, tend to attract professionals from other careers
who want to become teachers but don't want to spend years getting
the certification they need to be in the classroom.
</P>
<P>
   He said the state's goal should be to hire one-tenth of all new
teachers from such programs by 2002.
</P>
<P>
   Shorter alternatives to traditional education school programs
are becoming more popular. This past summer, the Commonwealth's
two-year old MINT program trained 150 new teachers in an intensive,
seven-week course. Sentance said that states such as Texas and New
Jersey already get between a quarter and one-third of their new
teachers from such programs.
</P>
<P>
   Susan Moore Johnson, a professor at the Harvard Graduate School
of Education, said alternative methods of teacher certification
should be considered, given the threat of a shortage. But she
cautioned that such programs must be carefully constructed and
monitored to make sure the new teachers are adequately prepared.
</P>
<P>
   If not, she said, ``people will enter the classroom with less
understanding of the challanges of teaching, the complexities of
teaching and the practical day-to-day requirements.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ J.D. Salinger's daughter, Margaret, is visiting from
Boston and staying at the Plaza Hotel, under an assumed name. There
are Salinger ``crazies'' out there, she says, who have written
menacing letters to her family. And then there is the possibility
that her famously private father will try to stop her from
publishing her memoir, ``Dream Catcher,'' due out on Sept. 6 from
Pocket Books.
</P>
<P>
   Salinger, 81, who has not published anything since 1965 and has
not spoken publicly for years, is so determined in his seclusion
that he successfully delayed the publication of a biography by Ian
Hamilton because Hamilton had sought to use some of his letters.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ian Hamilton thought my dad would be so proud of him and sent
him the galleys,'' said Ms. Salinger. ``I know better.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Salinger has written a book that reveals not only her own
life but previously unknown and deeply intimate aspects of her
father's life. Her motivation in breaching his zealously guarded
privacy is likely to be questioned by many who criticized Joyce
Maynard's 1998 memoir, which included details of her romance with
Salinger when she was 18 and he was 53. Last year's auction of
letters that Salinger wrote to Ms. Maynard in the early 1970s also
prompted criticism. The letters were bought by the California
software entrepreneur and philanthropist Peter Norton, who returned
them to Salinger.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Salinger says she is willing to take the risk that her
father might not speak to her again. And then of course there is
the possibility that the public might see her book as an attempt to
trade on his name. In any case she has written it, Ms. Salinger
says, to make sense of her strange childhood. And she has come to
New York to promote the book.
</P>
<P>
   The Plaza is a place of happy memories, where she used to stay
with her father when they visited her godfather, William Shawn, the
editor of The New Yorker. She is looking at photographs in her book
about her handsome young father, beaming as she learns to walk, as
she sits on his shoulders, plays the piano.
</P>
<P>
   ``He loves me,'' said Ms. Salinger, as if surprised. ``Isn't he
sexy! How funny he was.'' And she looks like him, too, tall, with
the same long face and dark eyes.
</P>
<P>
   Her father loved her, but he was also pathologically
self-centered, Ms. Salinger says. Nothing could interrupt his work,
which he likened to a quest for enlightenment. He was also abusive
toward her mother, Claire Douglas, Ms. Salinger says, keeping her a
virtual prisoner in his house in Cornish, N.H., refusing to allow
her to see friends and family. Ms. Salinger said that her father
feared the female body and that when Ms. Douglas was pregnant, he
found her abhorrent. She said that since her parents rarely had
sex, she feels her birth was almost an accident.
</P>
<P>
   Salinger's agent, Phyllis Westberg of Harold Ober Associates,
said he would not comment on Ms. Salinger's book.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Salinger also says that when she was 13 months old, her
mother planned to kill her and commit suicide, and later did indeed
burn the house down. Ms. Salinger said her mother denied setting
the fire. Ms. Douglas is now a Jungian analyst in California and
``a terrific grandma,'' Ms. Salinger said.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Douglas did not respond to messages left on her answering
machine.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Salinger pursued Scientology, homeopathy and
Christian Science. He drank urine, his daughter writes, and sat in
an orgone box. He spoke in tongues, fasted until he turned green
and as an older man had pen pal relationships with teen-age girls.
</P>
<P>
   After her parents divorced in 1966, her father continued to be a
part of her life. She stayed with him at times in Cornish.
</P>
<P>
   Does he know about her book? ``He does now,'' said Ms. Salinger,
because of newspaper articles. Has she spoken to him since then?
She laughs. ``I may be 44,'' she said, ``but I still don't want to
get yelled at.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, ``it's not unusual at all to not speak for several
months,'' said Ms. Salinger. ``Particularly because he's very
deaf,'' and for a long time refused to wear a hearing aid, she
added.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not officially estranged,'' she said. ``What other
people might call weird is just regular for us.''
</P>
<P>
   Considering Ms. Salinger's accounts of her childhood and
teen-age years _ bulimia, ``severe perceptual distortions,''
``panic attacks, chronic fatigue syndrome and fibromyalgia'' _ she
seems quite jolly. She laughs, makes fun of herself. Her father
loves her, she said, but ``he probably hates my guts, too, I would
say, operatically.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Salinger said she wrote ``Dream Catcher'' because ``I was
absolutely determined not to repeat with my son what had been done
with me.''
</P>
<P>
   ``There is something to be said for the examined life,'' she
said.
</P>
<P>
   There is one moment that stands out above all, she said. ``It is
so horrible, it's so powerful.'' When she was pregnant and sick,
instead of offering help, her father ``said I had no right to bring
a child into this lousy world,'' she writes, ``and he hoped I was
considering an abortion.''
</P>
<P>
   The book, she says, is her struggle to make sense of it all. The
Salingers have always been secretive, she said. It is embodied in
``Catcher in the Rye'': ``My parents would have about two
hemorrhages apiece if I told anything pretty personal about them.
They're quite touchy about anything like that.''
</P>
<P>
   From her Aunt Doris, her father's sister who is six years older
and in failing health, Ms. Salinger said she learned about her
father's childhood as Jerome David Salinger, son of Miriam and Sol
Salinger, who became a prosperous food merchant in New York. Jerome
grew up on the Upper West Side and Park Avenue and attended Valley
Forge Military Academy. He was the center of his mother's life, Ms.
Salinger said her aunt told her. But Miriam was also
overprotective. Salinger once wrote in a letter to Hemingway that
his mother walked him to school until he was 24, Ms. Salinger said.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   He had always thought his parents were Jewish, Ms. Salinger
writes, but when he was a teen-ager he discovered that his mother
was Irish Catholic. Still, he experienced anti-Semitism, from which
he developed his aversion, expressed by his characters, for the Ivy
League, for ``phonies.''
</P>
<P>
   During World War II he was a counterintelligence agent assigned
to the Twelfth Regiment of the Fourth Division, interrogating
POW's. He served in the most brutal campaigns of the European
theater, including D-Day and the Battle of the Bulge. In 1945 in
Germany he was hospitalized for ``battle fatigue.''
</P>
<P>
   In one of the book's surprises, Ms. Salinger writes that her
father arrested a young Nazi Party functionary, Sylvia, then
married her. The marriage was brief, and forever after he referred
to her as Saliva.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Salinger's parents met in 1950 at the writer Francis
Steegmuller's apartment; Claire Douglas was about 16 and Salinger
about 31. Ms. Douglas was born in England, the daughter of the art
critic and dealer Robert Langton Douglas.
</P>
<P>
   At the time Ms. Douglas and Salinger met, he abstained from sex,
her mother told Ms. Salinger, because he was studying with an
Indian mystic who taught that it interfered with enlightenment. Ms.
Salinger quotes from ``The Gospels of Sri Ramakrishna,'' written by
the guru's guru. An acolyte announces that he and his wife have had
intercourse: ``Don't you hate yourself for dallying with a body
which contains only blood phlegm, filth and excreta?'' Ramakrishna
asks. Ms. Salinger noted that in Salinger's story ``A Perfect Day
for Bananafish,'' the character Seymour shoots himself on his
honeymoon.
</P>
<P>
   Just months before her high school graduation, Ms. Douglas
married Salinger and moved with him to Cornish. Ms. Douglas told
her daughter that he demanded elaborate meals and that the sheets
had to be laundered twice weekly, though there was no heat or hot
water. When her mother became pregnant, Ms. Salinger writes, she
fell into ``a suicidal depression when she realized that her
pregnancy only repulsed him.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Salinger was born in 1955, the year her father's stories
``Franny'' and ``Raise High the Roof Beam, Carpenters'' were
published in The New Yorker.
</P>
<P>
   Salinger wrote letters about his joy in her, Ms. Salinger said.
He was a playful father who seemed easier in the magic world of
childhood. Her imaginary friends were real to him, too, she says,
as were the characters in his books. ``The world of fiction and
reality were very blurred,'' she writes. But, her mother felt
``jealousy and rage over my replacement of her in my father's
affections.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1960 the Salingers had a son, Matthew, who is now an actor
and producer in California. Last month The Sunday Times of London
quoted him as saying of his sister: ``I guess she's got a lot of
anger. But to write a book just isn't right. It's kind of
pathetic.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Salinger says she does not believe he said it: ``I love my
brother dearly. It just doesn't sound like him.''
</P>
<P>
   Attempts to reach him by telephone or through friends were not
successful.
</P>
<P>
   In 1972, Salinger began a relationship with Ms. Maynard, the
journalist, who was two years older than his daughter. To Ms.
Salinger it was a repeat of his relationship with her mother. He
induced Ms. Maynard to leave college and live in isolation with
him, Ms. Maynard wrote her own memoir of Salinger, ``At Home in the
World'' (Picador, 1998).
</P>
<P>
   After a brief ``impulsive'' marriage to her karate instructor,
Ms. Salinger began pulling her life together. She graduated from
Brandeis University with honors and received a degree in management
from Oxford University. She attended Harvard Divinity School and
trained as a nondenominational hospital chaplain. She is married to
an opera singer and actor _ she refuses to give his name, or that
of her son, or her son's age. She wants to write more books, she
said, though she would not say on what topics.
</P>
<P>
   Today Salinger is married to his third wife, Colleen, a nurse,
some 50 years younger than he. ``She's lovely,'' Ms. Salinger said.
She cared for Ms. Salinger for a time during her pregnancy, she
said, though Salinger constantly asked his wife to come home. Ms.
Salinger writes that her father berates Colleen, as he did her
mother. At one point the couple was trying to have a child, Ms.
Salinger said.
</P>
<P>
   Salinger still lives in Cornish. The curtains in the house are
drawn nearly all the time, said Ms. Salinger. She has seen his
bedroom and study, ``probably twice in my life.'' Salinger is still
writing, and lives on royalties. ``Catcher in the Rye'' sells ``at
least'' 250,000 copies annually, she said.
</P>
<P>
   She said she did not know why Salinger refused to publish his
work. ``My aunt thinks he can't stand any criticism,'' she said.
``He sure doles it out.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Salinger speaks with affection of her father's early
``lovely stories in magazines he won't allow to be published in
books.''
</P>
<P>
   ``He's stopped lecturing enough and was telling a good story,''
she said.
</P>
<P>
   Later stories, like ``Hapworth 16, 1924,'' are simply lectures,
she says, that she heard as a child. ``He has opinions on
everything from how to chew your food to proper breathing
techniques.''
</P>
<P>
   Toward the end of ``Dream Catcher,'' Ms. Salinger writes that in
giving up her dream of a perfect father, memories of happy times
with him have returned. ``When I was a kid, he was just so funny,''
Ms. Salinger said. ``The world just lit up when Daddy came home.''

GORE TOUTS HEALTH PLAN; BUSH FOCUSES ON EDUCATION 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ANNE E. KORNBLUT AND GLEN JOHNSON  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   PORTLAND, Ore. _ Sticking to familiar turf, Al Gore kept the
spotlight on health care Wednesday by focusing on his plan to shore
up Medicare.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, George W. Bush continued a two-week education push
with a campaign swing through New Hampshire, where he outlined a
$6.7 billion proposal to help students pay for college. But he also
had to devote some time to other issues, pledging to release a
detailed prescription-drug policy soon and defending his position
on the presidential debates. Bush has not yet decided which debates
he will participate in.
</P>
<P>
   For Gore, there was little deviation from his message. After
arriving here Tuesday, the vice presdient held a late-night rally
at a downtown intersection, then participated in a town-hall
meeting Wednesday to discuss Medicare. He appeared energized by the
topic, and even showed a few hints of spontaneous humor, despite a
noisy band of Ralph Nader protesters who followed him everywhere.
</P>
<P>
   ``Medicare is a lifeline for millions of seniors and their
families,'' Gore told the group at Portland State University,
describing in exhaustive detail his proposal to strengthen the
federal insurance program for seniors through 2030. ``You ought to
know what both sides are proposing to do to preserve it, and make
it stronger.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore has not mentioned Bush by name in days; Wednesday, in a
further dig, vice presidential candidate Senator Joseph I.
Lieberman raised the specter of Bush's opponent during the
Republican primaries.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our opponents have not proposed to spend a single additional
dime for Medicare,'' Gore said. ``Actually, that quote comes
from...''
</P>
<P>
   ``John McCain,'' Lieberman interjected, drawing laughter.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm just trying to keep this nonpartisan here,'' Gore said.
</P>
<P>
   Campaigning on opposite coasts, Bush and Gore hit states they
are increasingly confident they can win _ Gore in Oregon, Bush in
New Hampshire. Gore and Lieberman then flew to Seattle, where they
will campaign Thursday before flying to Washington.
</P>
<P>
   With a sometimes mind-numbing penchant for details, Gore has
kept his aim on health care all week, highlighting a different
pillar of his program each day. Wednesday's topic was Medicare;
Gore again pledged to spend $339 billion over 10 years to expand
Medicare to cover the growing senior population, and to use
additional money to restore funding for specific programs such as
teaching hospitals and rehabilitative care.
</P>
<P>
   Bush has also emphasized shoring up Medicare, praising a
commission that proposed, among other things, increasing the amount
seniors would pay as a premium and raising the eligibility age from
65 to 67 (although Bush has said he does not support that last
provision).
</P>
<P>
   Bush has also said he would sign into law a proposal by Senators
John Breaux, a Louisiana Democrat, and Bill Frist, a Tennessee
Republican, to reshape Medicare. And the Texas governor has pledged
to create a prescription-drug component to Medicare, saying he will
release details of that program next Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   But Gore has hammered Bush repeatedly for not laying out more
specifics already, and Wednesday questioned how the Texas governor
would pay for the ideas he has floated.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, Gore responded to a battery of negative
advertising by Republicans that criticize his opposition to the
1998 Medicare Commission. Gore said he would not support raising
the age requirement or the premiums.
</P>
<P>
   Bush unveiled a number of education initiatives before a crowd
of 750 at Winnacunnet High School auditorium in Hampton, N.H..
Among the proposals was raising the maximum amount of the Pell
Grant award from $3,300 to $5,100 for freshmen students and
covering a portion of states' costs for scholarships to students
who do advanced course work before entering college.
</P>
<P>
   ``These are some of the ways to make sure that the education
fulfills the promise of tomorrow,'' Bush said.
</P>
<P>
   But Bush also weighed in on health care. One day after Gore
aides attacked the Texas record on the Children's Health Insurance
Program, or CHIP, Bush said he had made progress as governor in
getting children insured under the program, which is designed for
children whose families are too wealthy for Medicaid but cannot
afford private insurance.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've heard the political rhetoric saying we don't want to sign
up children to our Children's Health Insurance Program, and that's
just not the truth,'' Bush said. ``It's the same old-style politics
_ make an accusation that has no truth to it and hope it sticks.
Our state of Texas is a compassionate state.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush also discussed the debates, saying he wanted to ``have
political discourse and debate, but we can do so in a spirit of
civility. We can do so without calling names or belittling people.
We can do so without wagging our fingers and claiming somebody is
bad just because they don't agree with us.''
</P>
<P>
   Later, in an interview with CNN, was asked about his advertising
strategy. ``I may run an ad that says nothing has been done and
this administration has not led,'' Bush said. ``Some people would
call that negative. I would call that the truth.''

AUSTRALIAN ACTION REOPENS DISPUTE ON HUMAN RIGHTS MONITORS 
</HEADLINE>
   By BARBARA CROSSETTE   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   UNITED NATIONS _ A decision by Australia to limit its
cooperation with the United Nations on human rights reporting has
reopened a debate about whether international monitors are
sometimes harder on democracies than on closed societies.
</P>
<P>
   Some democracies, aware that information is more accessible and
independent advocacy groups are more influential in their
countries, are wary of the monitoring.
</P>
<P>
   In Australia, a campaign has been building for months to curb
access to U.N. monitors since the release of reports that were
critical of the government's judicial treatment of Aborigines and
foreigners who sought asylum.
</P>
<P>
   Politicians from Prime Minister John Howard's conservative
Liberal Party have been particularly angry over criticisms from the
U.N. Committee for the Elimination of Racial Discrimination that
relate to mandatory sentencing laws in Australia. The committee
found that they fell hardest on Aborigines, some of them children.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday, Australia said that it would demand that U.N.
monitors produce compelling reasons to visit Australia before
permissions for fact-finding trips would be granted.
</P>
<P>
   The government also said it would reject requests from the
United Nations to stay the deportation of unsuccessful asylum
seekers. Australia has become a magnet for illegal immigrants from
as far afield as Afghanistan and Iraq.
</P>
<P>
   Howard told Parliament on Wednesday that the decision to reduce
cooperation did not amount to ``a turning away by Australia from
the principles of the United Nations.''
</P>
<P>
   ``But it does represent a determination by this government to
ensure that matters affecting Australia are resolved by Australians
within Australia,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   U.N. human rights activities are fragmented. There is a high
commissioner for human rights, Mary Robinson, a former president of
Ireland. That office is less than a decade old.
</P>
<P>
   An older group, the Human Rights Commission, is a body of
government representatives that meets annually to hear reports from
monitors assigned to specific countries or issues and may censure
governments.
</P>
<P>
   Then there are treaty committees set up to monitor individual
covenants against torture, on the rights of the child, on the
elimination of discrimination against women, on the elimination of
racial discrimination and on civil and political rights. These are
expert panels whose candidates are nominated by governments and
elected by nations that have signed the relevant treaties or
covenants.
</P>
<P>
   Only countries that have signed the treaties are required to
submit reports for scrutiny, leaving some countries that are known
for abuses free of monitoring. Other nations that are signatories
submit perfunctory or late reports or ignore the requirement
altogether.
</P>
<P>
   In open societies, where independent monitoring groups as well
as government agencies can provide voluminous information,
criticisms may be sharper and more detailed, human rights leaders
acknowledge.
</P>
<P>
   Australia has been a strong supporter of these treaties and has
submitted regular reports. The Australian decision to restrict
future cooperation came as a shock to many rights groups.
</P>
<P>
   ``For the Australians, who have done so much to build the
international human rights system and the treaty system, to say
this is a particularly sad moment,'' said Felice Gaer, director of
the Jacob Blaustein Institute for the Advancement of Human Right
and a member of the U.N. committee against torture.
</P>
<P>
   Of the 25 core international treaties that Secretary General
Kofi Annan has asked governments to sign or ratify during a summit
meeting of world leaders in new York next week, ``13 of them are
human rights treaties,'' Gaer said, adding that the timing of the
Australian step was unfortunate.
</P>
<P>
   ``What kind of a message does this send to the rest of the world
about the importance of global norms, and the importance of living
up to them?'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   In Australia, the Sydney Morning Herald said in an editorial
that the government had ``delivered a diplomatic windfall to odious
regimes everywhere.''
</P>
<P>
   Australia's decision reflects opinions shared by some Americans
who oppose what they see as a growing tendency toward international
scrutiny. John Bolton, executive vice president of the American
Enterprise Institute in Washington and a former assistant secretary
of state for international organization affairs in the Bush
administration, said that his objections were constitutional.
</P>
<P>
   ``What Australia has done is a triumph for democracy,'' he said
in an interview. ``Within a constitutional system of representative
government, you're allowed to struggle for policy outcomes. In a
democracy, sometimes you win and sometimes you lose. What Australia
is objecting to is the idea that a losing side in a democratic
country can ask for a lifeline to a U.N. agency.
</P>
<P>
   The committee on racial discrimination is purporting to tell
Australia that its mandatory sentencing policies are discriminatory
against the Aboriginal population, Bolton said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Maybe they are and maybe they aren't,'' he added. ``But in a
democratic society, that's a legitimate subject for debate, and it
gets resolved through the processes of representative government.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   In making its decision, Australia called for an overhaul of the
U.N.'s human rights committee system. Among the Australian demands
are ``adequate recognition of the primary role of democratically
elected governments and the subordinate role of nongovernmental
organizations.''
</P>
<P>
   Speaking to parliament in Canberra on Wednesday, Howard
contended that Australia, which has signed all of the main human
rights treaties, was under greater scrutiny than the United States
and as much as Britain.

The name, at least, is irresistible: ``Psycho Beach Party'' is the
kind of gimmick that the Z-grade producer in ``Ed Wood'' might have
pitched, brandishing a provocative title while lacking a script.
<TEXT>
<P>
   But in execution, this is no parodistic drop kick between the
goal posts of ``Psycho'' and ``Beach Party.''
</P>
<P>
   The latter is its prime target. But the trouble with sending up
such drive-in schlock is that the originals already are riddled
with inadvertent humor.
</P>
<P>
   Even without the barbs of ``Mystery Science Theater 3000,''
films such as 1964's ``Horror of Party Beach'' can be a cheesy
hoot, leaving ``Psycho Beach Party'' in a bit of a sand trap.
</P>
<P>
   While wallowing in quaint, retro ironies, the film ably emulates
the silly surf-and-sun antics of Frankie Avalon and Annette
Funicello, peppering the mix with plot-driving murders.
</P>
<P>
   ``Psycho Beach Party'' also punches up the equation by
sprinkling its surface innocence with bursts of profanity, flashes
of nudity, pointed sexual commentary and monotonous homo-eroticism.
</P>
<P>
   These jarring nuances work _ to a point. But more often the
movie is a mundane comic exercise, even while basking in the
tarnished nostalgic glow of cheaply patronizing teen exploitation
flicks.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking of cheap, take ``Psycho Beach Party.'' Its cast has one
name star in Thomas Gibson of TV's ``Dharma &AMP; Greg,'' and
production values are meager, especially the muddy sound mix.
</P>
<P>
   Gibson plays an overaged surfer guru to a gang of empty-headed
beachcombers whom we first see at a drive-in. There, one girl is
murdered during a movie about a pizza waitress with three heads
(the film's funniest send-up), and soon surfers start washing up
dead.
</P>
<P>
   Chief suspect is Chicklet (Lauren Ambrose), a tomboy among them
who has ``morbidly psychotic episodes of schizophrenia.''
</P>
<P>
   The mystery plays out more like a recent slasher flick than
horror yarns of yore. Yet plot points are beside the point.
</P>
<P>
   Rather, ``Psycho Beach Party'' is driven by a warped humor that
it rarely sustains.
</P>
<P>
   The absurdly grisly murders earn some guffaws, and the teens'
nutty naivete can be cute in a corny, offbeat way.
</P>
<P>
   But in an era of comic outrageousness, director Robert Lee King
and screenwriter Charles Busch have punched up the equation with
kinkiness, including a randy policewoman clearly played by an actor
in drag (Busch himself).
</P>
<P>
   Largely this comic carnality just doesn't fit. It's as
anachronistic as having '60s surfer chicks emulate Britney Spears.
</P>
<P>
   Yet ``Psycho Beach Party'' has its moments, especially a
galvanizing dance on the beach with music by legit surf band Los
Straitjackets.
</P>
<P>
   King also uses amusing, creaky flourishes such as rapid zooms
and inset thought balloons.
</P>
<P>
   How quaint _ and how fun. But finding hilarity in such silliness
remains a challenge when the source of the mocking is funny enough
by itself. &QL;

<P>
   Gore Vidal wrote ``The Best Man'' in 1959, a time when Joseph
McCarthy's legacy endured, when Adlai Stevenson and Richard Nixon
were among the nation's leading politicians, and when Vidal counted
as his friend a young senator from Massachusetts named John
Kennedy. The play, first produced on Broadway in March 1960, eight
months before Kennedy was elected president, drew on these
influences to become a tale of politics that may seem improbable
today: a stark struggle of two men of obvious complexity, set
during a national political convention where decisions of
consequence were actually made.

   ``The Best Man'' is returning to Broadway 10 presidential
campaigns since it first arrived to favorable reviews. Previews
begin on Sept. 5 at the Virginia Theater, where it opens on Sept.
17 with a cast that includes Charles Durning, Spalding Gray, Chris
Noth, Elizabeth Ashley, Christine Ebersole and Michael Learned,
under the direction of Ethan McSweeny.
</P>
<P>
   The play is dated, yet it is not, and in that, it is very much
like the 74-year-old Vidal himself. Politics have changed mightily
since 1959, and the play and its author are a reminder that much of
what once so invigorated the nation's presidential selection
process _ the suspense, the unvarnished characters, the sense that
something meaningful was at stake _ has seeped away.
</P>
<P>
   Vidal attended his first convention at the age of 14, yet he did
not even consider stopping by when the Democrats met in Los Angeles
to nominate Al Gore last month, even though he was 25 minutes away
by car, settled in at a rooftop suite with a private garden at the
Regent Beverly Wilshire Hotel. ``It's too dismal,'' Vidal said, the
morning after President Clinton gave his valedictory speech to the
assembled Democrats. ``I'm not interested in any of the
candidates.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, Vidal has not, it seems, lost enthusiasm for what was
probably his best-received play, nor has he made any changes in the
original script to account for the intervening 40 years. Now
formally retitled ``Gore Vidal's The Best Man,'' to avoid confusion
with an unrelated movie called ``The Best Man'' that was released
last fall, the drama abounds with themes and lines that are at
times strikingly contemporary, notwithstanding the fact that they
were written before many of the current crop of politicians were
old enough to vote.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've had some very good presidents who have slept around a
lot more than Bill Russell ever did, and in the White House, too,''
proclaims the frumpy national committeewoman Gamadge (played by
Ashley), as she comes to the defense of a candidate with an
exemplary public life and a marriage more complicated than that of
the couple now living in the White House. As Russell ( Gray) finds
himself drawn into the back alleys of political combat, he laments
that he entered public life to put an end to ``the business of
gossip instead of issues, personalities instead of policies.''
</P>
<P>
   Besides the two candidates, who are out to destroy each other,
there is a departing president (Durning), who makes a case for the
honorability of lying to the electorate, be it about his terminal
medical diagnosis or the fact that he does not believe in God. Most
fundamentally, though, Vidal presents a struggle between two types
of politicians who are as common today as they were then: the
ruthless, relentless yet effective Senator Joe Cantwell (Noth), and
the honorable, morally grounded yet maddeningly deliberate Bill
Russell.
</P>
<P>
   This was Nixon versus Stevenson in its time, the inspiration for
the competing politicians in the play, but there is no shortage of
present-day analogies. ``There are only so many types who are drawn
to politics,'' Vidal observed. And the questions he raises in
setting up the combat between his politicians are the same ones
that Bill Bradley's dispirited supporters were asking themselves in
New Hampshire as Al Gore cheerfully pummeled their candidate into
defeat: Who would make the better candidate for office? And who
would make the better president?
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't have an answer and I never will,'' Vidal said last
month in Los Angeles, poking at a slab of seared salmon and
drinking iced coffee in the dining room of the Beverly Wilshire,
which was teeming with Democratic delegates who, to his constant
distraction, had taken to chanting ``Gore!'' as they marched
through the hotel corridors.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm dealing with game players,'' Vidal continued. ``These are
chess games. And I'm not going to analyze the chess player. I'm
going to analyze the game.'' (That said, Vidal has never attempted
to hide his empathy for Stevenson. So it is not surprising that
Russell comes across as more noble by the play's end.)
</P>
<P>
   The game, as Vidal would have it, involves the struggle between
Russell and Cantwell to win their party's presidential nomination,
played out in two hotel suites in Philadelphia in July 1960, as the
convention unfolds around them. Each man has dug up information
that could likely doom the other's candidacy. Russell is mortified
at his own behavior when, exhorted by his lieutenants and the
president, he confronts Cantwell with what he has discovered. ``I
never thought I could bring up something like this against any
man,'' Russell says. ``It revolts me.'' It falls to Cantwell to
buck up Russell. ``Oh, come on _ don't give it a second thought,''
he says. ``Look, I don't blame you. I'd certainly use it against
you if it was there.''
</P>
<P>
   To be sure, the story line would be unimaginable today for
obvious reasons. `` `The Best Man' is based on the idea that
candidates have secrets,'' said Jeffrey Richards, one of the play's
producers and its press representative. ``Today, who has secrets on
the eve of the convention?''
</P>
<P>
   In its way, then, the play is a time capsule, a means to measure
how much the system has changed. Even the undercurrent of
homosexuality, which Vidal noted was ``scandalous'' in its time
(though certainly not a surprising theme for one of the nation's
first openly gay writers), seems almost quaint in these days of
Richard Hatch and television's ``Survivor.''
</P>
<P>
   Even though Vidal did not alter the script, he would not
approach the subject the same way now. ``If I were to do a
political play today about who governs the United States, it would
not be set at a political convention,'' Vidal said. ``It would be
within a board room, as they argue about politicians, and audition
politicians, and figure out which one they're going to make
president.''
</P>

</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   &QL; 
nn
</P>
<P>
   Speaking of his drama in light of the present period, he said:
``I don't see how you can begin to do a play that's constructed
like that _ which is really a dramatic contest between two
front-runners. And it can go either way. That doesn't happen
anymore. Primaries meant something then, but nobody knew in March
who the candidate was going to be _ which we knew in both parties
this year. It's predicted by how much money is spent in the primary
season and it's quickly wrapped up. So there's nothing to do at a
convention but pick a vice president. Generally undramatic, if
that.''
</P>
<P>
   It is no coincidence that ``The Best Man'' is being revived this
season. Richards said he had had it in mind for a play-reading
project that did not pan out, but still thought ``it would be great
to do in a year in which there was a presidential campaign.''
</P>
<P>
   When he subsequently contacted Vidal in Italy, Richards
recalled, ``His initial questions were: `Are you really serious
about this?' And, `Do you want me to update it?'''
</P>
<P>
   Richards said he put ``The Best Man'' in the category of
``classic popular entertainment''; ``I wouldn't update `The Front
Page' or `The Little Foxes.''' At the same time, though, there have
been few attempts by any writers over the last 40 years to make
politics the subject of a Broadway play ( Vidal tried once or twice
after ``The Best Man'' without much success), and it will be
intriguing to see if there is more interest in theatrical
treatments of politics than in the game itself. (The 1964 movie
version of ``The Best Man,'' for which Vidal wrote the screenplay,
starred Henry Fonda.)
</P>
<P>
   Vidal is not just another playwright, or historical novelist, or
essayist, or commentator, or whichever of the many resume entries
he might use to define himself. He has practiced what he is writing
about: he ran for Congress from New York in 1960, and for senator
from California in 1982, each time as a Democrat; he lost both
elections. And while in Los Angeles last month, he was a keynote
speaker at a forum sponsored by The Nation, an ideological retreat
for Democrats frustrated by the proceedings downtown.
</P>
<P>
   The speech he gave warned that the drive to increase the
country's military might was a threat to the economic viability of
the Republic at a time when the nation is anxious for peace and
suspicious of interventionism (much as Gore's grandfather was when
he served as a senator from Oklahoma).
</P>
<P>
   ``It was quite something,'' Gore said. ``Not only a standing
ovation, but they began to chant, `Go, Gore! Go, Gore! Go, Gore!'
They were running me for president!''
</P>
<P>
   Vidal is also unusual in that over the years he has kept some
notable company. He and Jacqueline Bouvier shared the same
stepfather, Hugh D. Auchincloss, at different times, and his
conversation is scattered with first-name references to former
presidents and first ladies, complete with anecdotes about, and
caricatures of, the people he has known.
</P>
<P>
   ``It doesn't remind me of Truman at all,'' Vidal declared in a
husky falsetto, as he recounted what Eleanor Roosevelt told him
when she was asked her opinion of the president in ``The Best
Man.''
</P>
<P>
   As the playwright sat in on a rehearsal the other day in
Manhattan, wearing sunglasses and drinking a Diet Coke while the
actors competed over the thump of construction machinery outside,
he leaned over to offer a real-time footnote to his play. ``The
next line is one Jack Kennedy gave me,'' he said. He turned to the
makeshift ``stage,'' an assortment of couches, tables and empty
Absolut bottles, where one of Russell's supporters proceeded to
promise him that he was behind his candidacy ``100 percent.'' That
means, then and now, that ``you're finished,'' Vidal said tartly.
</P>
<P>
   President Kennedy attended a performance of ``The Best Man'' on
Broadway, with Charles Spalding, a longtime friend, at his side.
Vidal stood behind a curtain in the wings, observing the president
as the president observed his play. ``I had never actually watched
anybody who was watching a play,'' Vidal said. ``I could see their
eyes, so I could see who they were looking at. He was following it
very attentively. And there was a little giggle between him and
Spalding on the line about how to get girls in the White House.''
</P>
<P>
   ``And then he did his famous'' _ Vidal brought his fingers to
his mouth and tapped his teeth, evoking a dozen pictures of Kennedy
_ ``which meant he was thinking, he was really following it.''
</P>
<P>
   As it turned out, another man who would be president, Ronald
Reagan, came close to playing Russell on Broadway. Vidal rejected
that casting suggestion from the producers, and the part went to
Melvyn Douglas. ``I'm responsible for Ronald Reagan,'' Vidal
whispered, as the rehearsal continued. ``I turned him down for the
part. They came to me and said, `What about Ronald Reagan?' I said,
`He is good, but I don't think he'd be credible as a presidential
candidate.' I have always thought that if I had cast him, Melvyn
Douglas would have become president. It's been on my conscience
ever since.''
</P>
<P>
   Vidal said his days of palling around with presidents ended with
the Kennedys: ``I learned my lesson from the Kennedys, which is if
you want to be effective as a commentator on political matters
you've got to stay away from presidents. I was continually attacked
as a Kennedy apologist.''
</P>
<P>
   He said he had met Clinton only briefly and found him charming,
``and I'm not easily charmed by presidents.''
</P>
<P>
   Al Gore is another matter. The two are distant cousins through
Vidal's mother, though Vidal, in the polite way one talks about
strayed relatives, leaves little doubt at his disappointment _ or
perhaps disinterest _ in this particular member of the famous
family.
</P>
<P>
   Would he vote for his cousin? Vidal, at this point speaking from
his villa in Italy by telephone, laughed heartily at the question.
``As they say in the House of Representatives, at the end of the
day, Gore is thicker than Nader,'' he said, presumably meaning that
his blood-tie to Gore counted more than his ideological attraction
to Ralph Nader.
</P>
<P>
   In any event, Vidal said he had never met Gore, and does not
think it possible to learn much about him, or George W. Bush, from
the way presidential campaigns are conducted. ``We'll never know
whether they're interesting or not,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking of himself, Vidal said that at his age, he had reached
the ``springtime of my senility.'' As sharp and acerbic as ever, he
is also white-haired, magisterial in bearing and a bit slow in his
gait. ``I don't do e-mail,'' he declared. He did not seem fazed at
the rehearsal when, during a break, Michael Learned asked if he
would autograph a copy of his 1967 historical novel, ``Washington,
D.C.'' He is about to publish ``The Golden Age,'' the concluding
volume in his series on American history.
</P>
<P>
   Vidal follows developments in American politics by way of CNN
and The International Herald Tribune from his home in Ravello,
though he is indignant at the suggestion that he is something of a
recluse, a subject he had raised himself as the lunch in Beverly
Hills had come to a quiet end, without dessert. ``The illusion that
the press has carefully developed, because my views are not popular
with management, is that I must be depicted as an exile _ an
embittered expatriate. I am no such thing, and they know it. I've
been involved in every election, in one way or another, as a
commentator, sometimes as a candidate, for most of my life. And
this, after all, is my subject as a writer.''

Our rating: 1 1/2 stars 
By DAVID KRONKE 
c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Muhammad Ali was the Greatest; ``Ali: An American Hero'' is the
Gratingest. This turgid, useless biopic of boxing legend Muhammad
Ali was shot at the same time as a similar ABC teleflick, but was
delayed when it became clear that ABC's rush job would hit the
screen first (to overwhelming indifference, it must be noted).
Between the networks, no one scores even a TKO; the only loser,
alas, is Ali, who must contend with these lame, diminishing
portraits.
</P>
<P>
   David Ramsey stars as Ali, who looks not even remotely like the
champ; frequently, he sounds nothing like him, as well. Since Ali
boasts one of the most famous mugs in the history of the 20th
century, from the outset this is a dubious project: No one, for a
second, will believe they're witnessing the heroics _ or the
inspired antics _ of boxing's most compelling hero. This is a
Bizarro-World Ali, and therefore, one we feel free not to empathize
with (and it's not Ramsey's fault _ it's the grievous error of the
producers).
</P>
<P>
   So we grudgingly follow the connect-the-dots high points of
Ali's career trajectory _ with, it seems, a little more emphasis on
his conversion to Islam than most biographies would have devoted
(due mainly, it seems, to the fact that Joe Morton gives a notable
turn as Malcolm X). It's all built around, predictably, Ali's
battle with George Foreman in Zaire, the legendary ``Rumble in the
Jungle.''
</P>
<P>
   Said ``Rumble'' _ which was definitively depicted in Leon Gast's
``When We Were Kings'' and can't possibly be improved upon here
(and, of course, isn't) _ provides the rudimentary basis for the
stupid flashback sequences; when we return to Ali preparing for his
rope-a-dope trick in Kinshasa, he even witnesses his essence as a
child, nodding to him approvingly. This is all you need to know to
understand that this movie is a specious piece of nonsense; it is
distressing, nonetheless, to realize that becoming World Champion
still can't protect one from such crummy, cynical and assaultive
biopics.
</P>
<P>
   ---Mama mia! &QL; 
David Proval, who nearly capered away with the past season from
``The Sopranos'' as the murderous Richie _ and still found time to
play a rabbi (!) on an episode of ``The West Wing'' _ will appear
in a recurring role this season on the Emmy-nominated sitcom
``Everybody Loves Raymond'' as an Italian patriarch who definitely
does not approve of Robert (Brad Garrett) as a potential
son-in-law. Proval promises that this character is, in fact, not a
mobster.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody Loves Raymond'' celebrated its 100th episode Tuesday
night at Spago in Beverly Hills. Les Moonves, CBS CEO, called
``Raymond'' the most important series of his tenure _ which,
obviously, includes ``Survivor.'' The show survived an uninspired
first season _ buried on Friday nights _ to become CBS' top-rated
entertainment series.
</P>
<P>
   ``Raymond's'' season opener will find Ray (Ray Romano) and his
family on vacation in Rome (the episode was shot on location),
where they encounter Proval's character. The 100th episode finds
Marie (Doris Roberts) inadvertently slamming her car through Ray's
front door, inspiring a testy round of family therapy in which Ray
and his long-suffering wife, Debra (Patricia Heaton), allow their
long-contained hostilities toward Ray's parents finally explode.
</P>
<P>
   --- &QL; 
The show: ``Ali: An American Hero.'' &QL; 
What: TV biopic about the boxing great. &QL; 
The stars: David Ramsey, Joe Morton, Vondie Curtis-Hall, Clarence

 &HT;    Ford, United face their crises with apologies from the top
 &HT;    By Scott Leith
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA - Corporate America is learning to do something that's
old hat to most folks.
</P>
<P>
   Say ``sorry.''
</P>
<P>
   That's the subtext of TV commercials from Ford Motor Co.
concerning the Firestone tire fiasco and from United Airlines about
a summerlong spate of flight delays and cancellations. The ads
feature top executives vowing to set things right.
</P>
<P>
   ``Clearly, the most effective way to deal with a crisis is full
disclosure, right upfront,'' said Jeff Springston, an associate
professor of advertising and marketing at the University of
Georgia. ``The public will forgive mistakes.''
</P>
<P>
   Fessing up is a departure from years past, when bad news was
often hidden or ignored. Today that stance can be dangerous with a
marketplace that expects contrition.
</P>
<P>
   Consumers also want speed. Coca-Cola Co. and Coca-Cola
Enterprises were criticized last year for the way they handled a
costly product recall in Belgium.
</P>
<P>
   Coke's former chief executive, M. Douglas Ivester, flew to
Europe to apologize in person. But the company still was seen as
slow to deal with the image crisis _ one of the factors that led to
Ivester's abrupt retirement a few months later and spurred ongoing
changes within the company.
</P>
<P>
   ``A company only has a very small window of time,'' said Leanne
Hand, senior vice president for public relations at WestWayne, an
Atlanta ad agency. ``It makes an indelible impression as to how
they treat their customer.''
</P>
<P>
   Johnson &AMP; Johnson set the standard for good crisis management
during the infamous Tylenol tamperings nearly 20 years ago. Tylenol
mounted an immediate recall, along with nationwide ads featuring
Johnson &AMP; Johnson's medical director asking for continued trust of
the brand.
</P>
<P>
   On the other end of the spectrum, Exxon was perceived as
arrogant after the Valdez oil spill in 1989. ``We've always held
Exxon up as sort of the `poster child' for not really stepping out
with a quick response,'' said Andy Bowen, vice president of
Fletcher Martin Ewing, a public relations firm in Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   Bad news can heavily tarnish a brand. Remember ValuJet? A year
after the 1996 crash in the Florida Everglades, Atlanta-based
ValuJet was still struggling. Its recovery only began when it
merged with AirTran Airways of Orlando and adopted the smaller
carrier's name as part of an image makeover.
</P>
<P>
   United, whose service troubles snarled summer travel for
thousands of passengers, decided to air an apology featuring Jim
Goodwin, the chairman of parent UAL Corp.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's the one who's leading us through this,'' said United
spokesman Matthew Triaca. Goodwin was always the first choice for
the ad, which addresses United's severe service disruptions. ``For
us not to have him would immediately take credibility away.''
</P>
<P>
   Triaca declined to say how much United is spending on the ads,
which will continue through this weekend.
</P>
<P>
   In the Ford commercials, company President and CEO Jacques
Nasser offers an earnest message. He doesn't apologize for
Firestone's defective tires, although he pledges that Ford will
help fix the problem.
</P>
<P>
   Firestones are made by Bridgestone/Firestone Inc. of Nashville,
a subsidiary of Bridgestone Corp.
</P>
<P>
   Carolyn Brown, a Ford spokeswoman, said the automaker was
inundated with calls after the Firestone recall began. Ford felt it
had to provide its own response.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is, of course, a Firestone tire that is the issue, but
Firestone has been a supplier to Ford for almost the whole 100
years we've been in business,'' Brown said.
</P>
<P>
   Nasser's second ad appeared this week and will run for another
week. Firestone ran its own TV ads over the weekend, featuring an
executive vice president.
</P>
<P>
   Are Ford's ads working? That depends on who's watching. Bob
Garfield, a critic for Advertising Age magazine, thought Nasser was
a ``distraction'' in the first ad, wearing ``the world's ugliest
$4,000 Italian suit.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Furthermore, his arms go up and down, to and fro, not like a
charismatic executive, but like an animatronic rodent at Chuck E.
Cheese,'' Garfield wrote. Nonetheless, Garfield credited the Nasser
spots with calling more attention to Ford's message.
</P>
<P>
   Bowen said Ford and Firestone both reacted predictably. ``Your
first inclination in a situation like this is to become
defensive,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Lynne Sallot, an associate professor of public relations at UGA,
said the companies could have been better prepared. ``They should
have a crisis plan on the shelf,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   The fallout could be troubling for a venerable company such as
Firestone, which turns 100 this year. ``One bad incident, handled
incorrectly, can have lasting effects,'' Hand said.
</P>
<P>
   Springston, of UGA, said there's still a risk when apologies are
issued because they can be seen as empty unless promises of better
performance are kept.
</P>
<P>
   ``What speaks even louder is actual behavior,'' Springston said.

 &HT;    Cheney blasts Gore over military policy
 &HT;    By Kathey Pruitt
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Republican vice presidential nominee Dick Cheney used
a sweep through Georgia on Wednesday to blast Democrat Al Gore for
``running down the military.''
</P>
<P>
   In a 25-minute speech repeatedly punctuated by applause from
veterans and GOP stalwarts, Cheney said the U.S. military is
``headed down the wrong road'' because of cutbacks by the
Clinton-Gore administration.
</P>
<P>
   Mounting a successful Gulf War-type operation would be difficult
today, said Cheney, who was secretary of defense during the Bush
administration, during his address at a Buckhead hotel.
</P>
<P>
   ``To point out that our military has been overextended, taken
for granted and neglected _ that is no criticism of the military,''
Cheney said. ``That is a criticism of a president and a vice
president and the record they have built together.''
</P>
<P>
   Cheney, the running mate of GOP presidential nominee George W.
Bush, has repeated the military readiness theme in recent campaign
appearances. His stop in Georgia during a three-day Southern tour
also helped raise money for the GOP ticket. A GOP fund-raiser at
another Buckhead hotel generated at least $600,000, most of it for
use in the Georgia presidential contest. Over the last decade,
Cheney said, military commitments worldwide have escalated 300
percent while U.S. military forces were being cut by 40 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Now, he said, the percentage of money spent by the U.S. on
defense is at a 60-year low, and only 65 percent of the Air Force's
combat units and 60 percent of the Army's helicopter fleets are up
to mission standards.
</P>
<P>
   ``We will prepare the military of the future,'' Cheney vowed.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats in Georgia immediately noted that Cheney oversaw
military cuts during the Bush administration _ a point Cheney
obliquely referred to in the speech as ``cutting what was no longer
needed and nothing more.''
</P>
<P>
   Campaign aides to Gore, the Democratic presidential nominee,
have accused Cheney of focusing on a toothless defense argument to
deflect attention from Bush's lack of a specific plan to provide
access to health care coverage for millions of uninsured children
and prescription drug coverage for the elderly on Medicare.
</P>
<P>
   ``The personal memory people have,'' said Georgia Democratic
Party chairman David Worley, ``is of the Bush administration
wanting to close military institutions across the state and
(then-Democratic U.S. Sen.) Sam Nunn kept them open.''
</P>
<P>
   But many of about 250 people in attendance _ including decorated
military veterans appearing in support of Cheney _ insisted the
military issue will ring true in the conservative South, where
military installations are bread-and-butter for many communities
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm impressed, glad and happy because somebody is finally
saying what the truth is,'' said Jim Walsh, a 27-year Army veteran.
``If this just gets out past the spin- meisters, people will
understand.''

ON HIS STAGES, LIFE IS BUT A DREAM, A LAMOS SIGNATURE
</HEADLINE>
  (For release Sunday, September 3)  
 By MATTHEW GUREWITSCH  
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Mark Lamos belongs to two worlds, in more ways than
one. First, he seemed headed for a career as a classical violinist,
a phase that lasted through four years at Northwestern University
on a music scholarship. Then he discovered the theater, where his
acting career lifted off in felicitous fashion, with an early
Broadway appearance as the heartthrob Christian de Neuvillette
opposite the Cyrano de Bergerac of Christopher Plummer and a
subsequent Hamlet at the Old Globe in San Diego. Next, Lamos
settled down as a director, first of straight plays, then also of
opera. At 54, he works steadily in both genres. The combination,
while not unique, is scarcely common. The track record, be it said,
is exceptional.
</P>
<P>
   Right now, his mind is on Donizetti's ``Roberto Devereux,''
which opens the New York City Opera season at the New York State
Theater on Sept. 12. Lauren Flanigan, his colleague on several
previous occasions, plays the starring role of Queen Elizabeth,
once played to iconic perfection on this stage by Beverly Sills.
Thanks to popular revivals (``Madama Butterfly,'' ``Tosca,'' ``The
Turn of the Screw'') and a transfer from Glimmerglass Opera (``Acis
and Galatea''), the season shapes up as an informal Mark Lamos
retrospective, with the director's signature on more than one in
three of the company's 14 productions.
</P>
<P>
   What is that signature?
</P>
<P>
   Paul Kellogg, long the artistic director at Glimmerglass and now
also at City Opera, who has been presenting Lamos' work since 1990,
puts it this way: ``On the whole, and certainly when Mark works for
us, there's a unifying clarity and freshness that I consider his
hallmark.''
</P>
<P>
   A vague answer, perhaps inevitably so. Unlike several brand-name
colleagues, Lamos has never settled down with a single designer or
circle of designers whose look might give his productions an
obvious stamp. Nor is he a slave to directorial theory. Sometimes
he mounts productions in period, sometimes he transposes. Above
all, he is a poet of the theater, if by poetry you mean not
embellishment and airy nothings but, as Lamos does, a property of
thought. His word for this is ``concentration,'' the arrangement of
all the elements of a production to point to one core truth.
</P>
<P>
   His dark, thick crop of hair brushed out of his face, dressed in
ivory ducks, a navy button-down shirt and the wire-rim glasses of
the inveterate bookworm, the director is unwinding at Calle Ocho, a
humming Pan-Latin eatery, just steps from the new Rose Center for
Earth and Space in Manhattan.
</P>
<P>
   Might I look in on a rehearsal? Sorry, no visitors.
</P>
<P>
   Could we look at some drawings?
</P>
<P>
   I happen to know that the City Opera press department has
stuffed Lamos' backpack with color copies of what I hear are
eye-catching set designs by Andrew Lieberman and sumptuous,
period-inspired costumes by Judy Levin. They are not forthcoming.
</P>
<P>
   Please, could we talk about the show?
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd rather not,'' Lamos replies, smiling at his martini, not
ungraciously. ``I work off instinct.''
</P>
<P>
   Conversation through dinner is by no means the ordeal this
opening may suggest. On any number of topics, Lamos swats the ball
back and forth with nimble, unguarded ease. His recent relocation
from Hartford to the Connecticut countryside, gardening, backstage
politics, his latest musical discoveries, his fondness for intimate
dinners, his horror of cocktail parties: all these yield delightful
volleys.
</P>
<P>
   Productions in progress are another story. ``We work in a dream
state,'' Lamos once told a roomful of directing interns, as good an
explanation as any of his reticence. On the subject of
``Devereux,'' he eventually relents a little: ``I'm feeling very
good about the production,'' he says. ``But I keep wondering. What
is it we're saying here? We're still conceiving to a certain
extent.''
</P>
<P>
   The idea of the auteur _ a director whose vision is the driving
creative force of a collaborative work _ belongs to film criticism,
but the phenomenon, if not the label, exists in the theater, too.
Robert Wilson definitely qualifies; Peter Sellars probably does;
Jonathan Miller may. Lamos definitely does not. One director he
does recall is Giorgio Strehler: similarly light in touch, catholic
in his tastes and inventive in making stage pictures that speak,
equally at home in straight plays and opera.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm an interpreter,'' Lamos says. ``There's a school of
thought that says it's not good directing unless the director's
hand is unseen. That's not my view. I think that I'm present in a
production, but that the material remains in the realm the creator
intended. My attitude probably comes from being a musician. You
learn how to play a Bach partita or a Mendelssohn sonata or the
Copland Sonata, and you find a different voice for each but a voice
that is your own, because that's who you are.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the same with acting. You use a different energy with
Shakespeare than you do with Shaw or with a new piece. You're
always releasing yourself into the piece and making it your own.
You're finding a voice somehow: a voice that is yours but works
with the piece.''
</P>
<P>
   Directing simply extends the process. Ideally, what results is a
collaboration in which the sense of ownership extends to everyone
on the team. At the design stage, Lamos may set the compass for a
certain direction, but once the cast is assembled, the voyage
unfolds according to its own dynamic. ``Everything in rehearsal is
negotiation,'' Lamos says. ``If you have a tenor who is a stick and
you want a tenor who moves like a dancer, you're just going to be
unhappy. You have to find a way to make the show work with the cast
you have.''
</P>
<P>
   Free-associate through memories of Lamos productions past, and
what comes to mind? Pictures, mainly:
</P>
<P>
   --A cross-legged Oberon, king of the fairies in ``A Midsummer
Night's Dream'' (the play), hanging upside down over a quadrille of
wrangling lovers as they splash through a pond.
</P>
<P>
   --``Hedda Gabler'' played on a blood-red floor against
bone-white walls, ``a state of mind with furniture,'' as Lamos once
called it.
</P>
<P>
   --Helena, in ``All's Well That Ends Well,'' waltzing the
moribund king of France from his four-poster deathbed with
corkscrew columns.
</P>
<P>
   --Richard Thomas as Hamlet in some mad banana republic, with the
court grandstanding to ubiquitous hand-held news cameras, long
before such technology had degenerated into cliche.
</P>
<P>
   --Massenet's Werther expiring in a frozen tornado of his own
love letters.
</P>
<P>
   --Jerry Hadley's Gatsby, in the premiere of John Harbison's
opera, materializing from nowhere at the top of a staircase, for
one brief, shining moment the dreamboat and the enigma Fitzgerald
meant the character to be.
</P>
<P>
   --Wozzeck's shadow splayed like a crucifix against a wall.
</P>
<P>
   And toys. Toys in abundance. Rocking horses (``Peer Gynt,''
``All's Well That Ends Well''). Doll's houses, some big enough for
actors to take up residence in (``Tiny Alice,'' ``School for
Wives''). Why?
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not sure,'' Lamos answers. ``I enjoy the scale of toys
onstage, even giant ones, against the live performers. In `Antony
and Cleopatra,' the battle of Actium was staged with war toys _
tiny ships on a map of the sea that burst into flames. Then A. and
C. collapsed with shame and regret in the midst of the wreckage. I
sense a nostalgia inherent in toys. For children, they represent an
artificial adulthood. For adults, an irrecoverable past. They are
iconic, completely representational. Like theater itself.''

NEW YORK: theater itself.''
<TEXT>
<P>
   A string of epiphanies, ephemeral as epiphanies are bound to be.
Yet two of Lamos' productions shine in memory with a brightness
time has not touched.
</P>
<P>
   One is ``Il Re Pastore'' (``The Shepherd King''), at
Glimmerglass. Minor Mozart, this early piece was written to
instruct a young archduke in the virtue of magnanimity. Around the
buckram of moral preachment, Lamos fashioned a silken
``entertainment for royal children,'' set in a schoolroom furnished
with blackboard, alphabet blocks and a cradle. Onstage, pint-size
extras appeared in gold paper crowns, spellbound as the cardboard
characters of the plot came to life: mellifluous role models,
enacted by the court tutors, starry storybook princes twinkling
with benevolence that ennobled (and momentarily rejuvenated) even
jaded oldsters out front in the house.
</P>
<P>
   Then there was ``The Rivals'' at the Hartford Stage, a
production fit to have crowned any drama festival on the planet.
Sheridan's featherweight plot involves two pairs of young lovers,
each pair perfectly matched but for the dizzy romantic caprices of
one of the ladies and the pathological jealousy of one of the
beaus. The characters and their meddlesome elders are easy prey for
slapstick, especially in the carnivals of artifice to which British
comedy of the 18th century is usually reduced.
</P>
<P>
   Looking beyond the frippery, powdered wigs and innuendo, Lamos
discovered in Sheridan's sentimental entanglements a clear-eyed yet
mellow (sometimes melancholy) affection for human foibles we may
well call Mozartean. Malaprop herself, fount and origin of torrents
of pompous poppycock, showed within her Amazonian affectations the
disarming vulnerability of a fading belle. For an equally tactful
and generous vision of the human comedy, one would have to go back
to Ingmar Bergman's thoroughly atypical ``Smiles of a Summer
Night'' or to Goldoni's ``Arlecchino, Servant of Two Masters'' in
Strehler's well-traveled, much-revived production. (Someday, Lamos
must direct Verdi's ``Falstaff.'')
</P>
<P>
   As chance or mystic correspondence would have it, Sheridan's
comedy and Mozart's little pastorale date to 1775, the same charmed
year. That these most inspired of Lamos' productions both arise
from the literature of the enlightenment is no coincidence at all.
On the cumulative evidence of his work, the 18th-century ideals of
classical balance and harmony are his as well. (They were
Strehler's, too, as evidenced in his Mozart and Goldoni, whose
Arlecchino first stepped out in 1745.)
</P>
<P>
   ``Balance is where I naturally go,'' Lamos says. ``Sometimes to
the detriment of the play if the play isn't doing that.''
</P>
<P>
   The caveat is perhaps unjust. More than a radical perspective,
an enlightened mind-set opens doors to worlds governed by laws
other than one's own. Here, too, may lie the key to Lamos' ease in
bridging the chasm between plays and operas. Attuned as he is to
their surface differences (and to the different working methods
those differences impose), Lamos perceives a musicality in action
and a structure in melody, which form their common ground.
</P>
<P>
   He has downed his decaf espresso. The night being balmy, we head
home on foot. Under the street lamp by his door, Lamos surrenders
the ``Devereux'' designs.
</P>
<P>
   What have we here?
</P>
<P>
   A marquee framed in light bulbs. Hard edges, strong verticals,
stark diagonals. A color scheme dominated by red and black. Looming
cutouts of Elizabeth in repeating formation, very sacramental.
Framed glamour shots of divas of yesteryear. A checkerboard floor
emblazoned, square by square with a portrait of the Virgin Queen.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's about images of kingship,'' Lamos explains. Hmm.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not using this,'' he warns, pointing out one striking
detail. ``And this area is different now.''
</P>
<P>
   Am I surprised?
</P>
<P>
   Experience has taught me that images in progress can look
stranger than what audiences see, usually more cluttered, mostly
less wondrous but sometimes more so. At a late rehearsal of Lamos'
original staging of ``The Turn of the Screw,'' the character of the
housekeeper came hulking onstage in a greatcoat lumpily studded
with dolls. Toys lost in action. Also on the casualty list: a tyke
in an angel suit, who walked Luciano Pavarotti onstage at the final
dress for the dream vision of Verdi's ``Lombardi,'' the occasion of
Lamos' Metropolitan Opera debut, in 1993.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it was a mistake to lose him,'' I suggest.
</P>
<P>
   ``So do I,'' says Lamos.
</P>
<P>
   ``Did the Met want you to get rid of him? Did Luciano?''
</P>
<P>
   ``No. It was my decision.''
</P>
<P>
   How often, I wonder, is Lamos happy with a production?
</P>
<P>
   ``Happy?'' he replies. ``I'm never happy. Or very rarely. The
fun in the work comes when I see an idea transformed by the
performers and the sets and the costumes and the lights into
something far beyond what I ever imagined it could be.''
</P>
<P>
   Editing dreams is delicate work.
</P>
<P>
   Postscript, via e-mail, under the ironic, mock-Teutonic subject
line ``DEVEREUX Konzept'':
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't mean to be coy,'' Lamos writes from cyberspace. ``I
was intrigued by the cult of Elizabeth, the Tudor myth that her
reign continually worked to uphold: the Virgin Queen, Gloriana.
What we have in the design is a world of iconography. This is
Elizabeth's world, not only as she created it for herself but as
interpreters (Donizetti, Bette Davis, etc.) recreated it. And
ultimately she is trapped in advertisements for herself, the
advertisements that kept her myths alive and kept her ruling for as
long as she did.
</P>
<P>
   ``The intersection of queens and divas: that's here, too. Hence
the high-contrast photos of famous divas hanging in front of the
repeated portraits of the young Virgin Queen that jut out from the
wings as if spying on the other characters. We're not so much
concerned with making the opera look like history (as the
production by Tito Capobianco with Beverly Sills attempted to do).
We want to watch the major character being trapped in her own world
of self-deception.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can see why I don't, as you point out, theorize. As Peter
Brook said, as soon as a theory in the performing arts makes itself
evident, another production comes along and that requires a whole
different set of theories.
</P>
<P>
   ``Or something like that!''

 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)   &HT;    Undersized work force puts NASA at `critical juncture'
 &HT;    
 &HT;    
 &HT;    By MARK CARREAU
 &HT;    c. 2000 Houston Chronicle
<TEXT>
<P>
   An aging, undersized work force that has shown signs of
job-related stress will be hard-pressed to fly NASA's shuttle
safely as the agency increases the flight rate to assemble the
international space station, congressional auditors warned
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Relying on NASA's internal assessments, the U.S. General
Accounting Office identified 26 technical skill areas, ranging from
computer software work to mechanical engineering, that will require
increased staffing at the Johnson Space Center in Houston and other
spaceflight facilities in Florida, Alabama and Mississippi.
</P>
<P>
   The space agency has reached a ``critical juncture,'' the GAO
said, because its shuttle program work force dropped from 3,000
federal workers in 1995 to 1,800 when NASA stopped the decline last
December.
</P>
<P>
   The drop was part of a wider effort by the Clinton
administration to reduce the federal work force to balance the
budget.
</P>
<P>
   Space agency officials embraced the GAO report, because the
findings essentially echoed a much harsher assessment of shuttle
safety issues prepared by NASA itself in response to an electrical
short that accompanied the July 1999 launching of the shuttle
Columbia.
</P>
<P>
   That incident prompted the Clinton administration to seek an
increase in shuttle spending and NASA to begin a sharp increase in
the number of workers.
</P>
<P>
   ``We think it's a very fair report,'' said Kirsten Williams, a
Washington-based spokeswoman for NASA's shuttle program. ``In a
balanced way it describes the challenges the shuttle program is
facing.''
</P>
<P>
   During the five-year period examined by the GAO, NASA's shuttle
launch rate dropped from eight in 1997 to just three in 1999.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the slowdown was because of Russian economic problems
that delayed the launch of the new station's habitat module by more
than two years.
</P>
<P>
   The Russian-built Zvezda crew living and working quarters
finally joined two other orbiting components of the fledgling
outpost on July 25. That milestone broke the logjam of U.S. station
components waiting to be launched on the shuttle.
</P>
<P>
   Even with fewer missions, the GAO found areas where NASA's
declining workforce was stretched. Where it was the thinnest, the
auditors said, NASA noted signs of overwork and stress, including
forfeited leave, absences from training classes and calls for
stress-related assistance.
</P>
<P>
   The difficulties of NASA's declining work force were further
compounded by its worker demographics, the GAO said.
</P>
<P>
   The space agency employs twice as many workers ages 60 or older
than those younger than 30, a trend that signals a further loss of
experienced personnel when their skills are needed most. The
auditors noted that it typically takes two years to train a new
hire and that the schooling often interferes with other job demands
when there is a worker shortage.
</P>
<P>
   Williams said the agency has been authorized to add 550 workers
by Oct. 1 at the Johnson, Kennedy, Marshall and Stennis space
centers to support a range of shuttle and station activities. The
shuttle program had 94 new hires by the end of July, said Williams.
</P>
<P>
   Additionally, NASA's prime shuttle contractor, United Space
Alliance, has increased by 250 to a total of 3,850 the number of
technicians who prepare shuttle hardware for launch from Kennedy in
Florida.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our work force is up. The training is in place. We are doing
the early preparations that will put us in an extremely good
posture to fly seven to eight flights a year,'' NASA shuttle
program manager Ron Dittemore said earlier this month.
</P>
<P>
   But he acknowledged that with the low flight rates of the past
few years, NASA will have to re-acclimate.
</P>
<P>
   ``The risk is there, and it will be a challenging effort for us
to put everything together,'' said Dittemore. ``There is a
confidence we can do it. It's not an overconfidence. We are being
very cautious.''
</P>
<P>
   The GAO's 20-page report was prepared for the U.S. Senate's
Commerce, Science and Transportation Committee, which has NASA
oversight.

ACQUISITION HIGHLIGHTS SWISS FLARE FOR MANAGING EXPANSION 
</HEADLINE>
   By JOHN TAGLIABUE   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   PARIS _ The Credit Suisse Group's planned acquisition of
Donaldson, Lufkin &AMP; Jenrette, following hard on the heels of the
deal for PaineWebber by the Swiss banking giant, UBS AG, is likely
to provide further illustration of Swiss banking's flair for
penetrating Wall Street and managing the cultural clashes that
expansion outside Europe often brings.
</P>
<P>
   The Swiss early on sensed the need to expand beyond a domestic
market of seven million. And they seem, more than their European
neighbors, to have learned from missteps and become better able to
balance the need in financial businesses between autonomy and
control.
</P>
<P>
   This ability to adapt is increasingly crucial as European banks
break out of their traditional national markets. Many, seeking to
grow in size and gain expertise in banking skills less developed in
Continental Europe, are acquiring banks in Britain and the United
States. The pressure to do so has intensified as European capital
markets have unified, spurred by the creation of a single currency.
</P>
<P>
   Financial service businesses from corporate banking to personal
investment are increasingly shedding the tightly cosseted and
closely managed rules of European finance to take on more of the
freewheeling, creative quality common in Britain and the United
States.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, for example, Deutsche Bank expanded its U.S. presence
by acquiring Bankers Trust for $10 billion.
</P>
<P>
   But Philip Zieschang, an analyst at Bank Julius Baer in Zurich,
said it was the Swiss who pioneered the penetration of the
Anglo-Saxon banking world. In 1995, the old Swiss Bank Corp., which
merged two years later with Union Bank of Switzerland to form UBS,
acquired SG Warburg, a British investment bank with a sizable Wall
Street presence. Swiss Bank also acquired two small but valuable
firms in Chicago: O'Connor Associates, a derivatives business, and
Brinson Asset Management, a money management firm.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Swiss were aware at an earlier stage of the critical
importance of growing internationally,'' Zieschang said.
</P>
<P>
   Credit Suisse had moved even before then. In 1978, it
established a joint venture with the Bank of Boston Corp. called
Financiere Credit Suisse First Boston. That was very much a
learning experience, said Bryan Crossley, an analyst at ABN Amro in
London. In 1988, Credit Suisse First Boston was beleaguered by
duplication and friction, not least because of financial fallout
from the stock market crash the previous autumn, prompting Credit
Suisse in Zurich to take full control. In the process, it acquired
a global investment bank and a powerful calling card in New York,
London and Europe.
</P>
<P>
   ``In that business, it can be pretty ruthless,'' Crossley said.
``You can spill blood, but can make it a clean cut.''
</P>
<P>
   It was also the Swiss who moved earliest in consolidating the
European banking market, in 1997, when Union Bank and Swiss Bank
startled the financial world by announcing the merger to form UBS,
then the world's biggest bank by assets.
</P>
<P>
   Susanne Borer, a financial analyst at Bank Vontobel in Zurich,
says that what is driving the Swiss overseas is also the thirst for
size. ``They're very big and they want to be very, very big,''
Borer said. With PaineWebber, she said, UBS ``essentially bought
assets under management.'' With Donaldson, Lufkin, Credit Suisse is
getting size in investment banking.
</P>
<P>
   The pattern is familiar, she said, and the Swiss have plenty of
competition. In January, Citigroup announced it was acquiring the
investment banking business of Schroders of London for about $2.2
billion; several months later, Chase Manhattan agreed to buy Robert
Fleming Holdings, the British investment bank with substantial
operations in Asia, for $7.7 billion.)
</P>
<P>
   Many analysts point to the considerable experience that Marcel
Ospel, the chairman of UBS, has had with American acquisitions.
Ospel played a role in Swiss Bank's acquisition of Warburg, a move
that some say threw the drive for British and American properties
into high gear.
</P>
<P>
   Zieschang called him a ``front runner in opening to Anglo-Saxon
influence.'' Ospel and Lukas Muhlemann, chief executive of Credit
Suisse Group, are both 50, part of a younger generation in Swiss
banking and insurance. Like Ospel, Muhlemann, a former McKinsey
consultant and insurance executive, has also understood the value
of integration. Muhlemann, for instance, rotated Credit Suisse
First Boston's chief financial officer, Richard E. Thornburgh,
between Zurich and New York to deepen trans-Atlantic ties.
</P>
<P>
   The Swiss hand in dealing with outsiders has not always proven
infallible, Borer said. For instance, efforts by Credit Suisse to
impose less lucrative European compensation schemes on Credit
Suisse First Boston's American bankers failed, she said, and Credit
Suisse was forced to backtrack.
</P>
<P>
   Still, said Vasco Moreno, who follows banking at the London
brokers Fox Pitt Kelton, ``the Swiss appear to be able to make it
stick more than other European institutions.'' In part, Moreno
said, that may be because the Swiss seem to be more culturally
aligned with the Anglo-Saxon way of doing business. The fact that
Swiss bankers, during the daily course of business in their own
country, have to deal with three different cultural groups and
three different languages may also be a reason they are more
adaptable.
</P>
<P>
   This does not, however, always mean they are welcome. Zieschang
noted that Josef Ackermann, a former Credit Suisse executive who
joined Deutsche Bank's management board in 1997, has been the focus
of friction and disputes that some attribute in part to his being
an outsider.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   AXA, the French financial services conglomerate that owns 72
percent of Donaldson, is shedding the unit because it ``was not
prepared to spend the capital to be a player in global investment
banking,'' said Crossley of ABN Amro.
</P>
<P>
   Some analysts expect AXA to use the proceeds to expand its asset
management business through acquisitions, notably in the United
States, following its big European competitors. Last year, Aegon NV
of the Netherlands paid almost $10 billion to acquire the
TransAmerica Corp. of San Francisco; earlier, the ING Group of the
Netherlands spent almost $15 billion buying various insurance
businesses from Aetna. In June, AXA Financial paid $3.5 billion
through an affiliate to buy the Wall Street broker Sanford C.
Bernstein Inc.
</P>
<P>
   Muhlemann of Credit Suisse has long been an advocate of
cross-fertilization of banking and insurance services. In 1997, the
year he took over as head of Credit Suisse, he bought the
Winterthur Insurance Co. Wednesday's cash-and-stock deal makes AXA
one of Credit Suisse's biggest shareholders, with a 10 percent
stake. It also stirred widespread speculation that Credit Suisse
might use the 5.5 percent share it holds in Swiss Life, another
insurer, as partial payment. Credit Suisse denied that this would
happen, but if it did, it would also leave AXA a major shareholder
in Swiss Life, weaving further links in Europe's financial services
industries.

<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ News travels quickly through the Santa Monica
Mountains National Recreation Area.
</P>
<P>
   That's the way the park's self-taught computer specialist, Mike
Maki, envisioned it a year ago when he designed an Intranet
patterned after a similar system at Yosemite National Park.
</P>
<P>
   The Santa Monica Mountains National Recreation Area is among the
country's few national parks to have its own Intranet, an internal
Web site.
</P>
<P>
   The Intranet allows more than 100 employees in remote offices,
spread throughout the 153,000-acre region stretching from Santa
Monica to Thousand Oaks, to view a frequently-asked-questions page,
newsletters, input vehicle reports, post bulletins and communicate
via e-mail.
</P>
<P>
   The heart of the Santa Monica Mountains National Recreation Area
lies in Maki's office in the Visitors Center in Thousand Oaks,
which is cluttered with books, CDs and three monitors. The park's
computers are linked to four servers in Maki's office, one for
mail, another for files and a third for the Intranet. The fourth is
a backup. The servers resemble nothing more than personal
computers.
</P>
<P>
   Maki, 40, had the system running in only one weekend, but it has
continually evolved with hundreds of hours of work. The Thousand
Oaks resident supervises the network of 100 computers, most in
outlying offices in Newbury Park, Calabasas, Agoura Hills and Los
Angeles. He is working on a project to convert to a higher-speed
connection.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our system is on the leading edge. He is just a great
resource,'' said Marilynn Sutton, Santa Monica Mountains National
Recreation Area Chief of Administration. ``He is able to
communicate to people with varying degrees of computer knowledge
and make some sense with everyone. He is very patient and friendly,
but most of all he adds the human touch to computers.''
</P>
<P>
   Computers have always been a hobby for Maki, a former volleyball
player at Cal State Northridge who rattles off terms like
bandwidth, packet size and window servers UNIX and LINUX as second
nature.
</P>
<P>
   But the West Hills native was not the typical techy nerd when he
joined the National Park Service in 1986, as he had visions of
becoming a consulting archeologist after graduating with a geology
degree. In fact, the position of computer specialist did not exist
within the Park Service.
</P>
<P>
   Maki started as a seasonal interpretive ranger at Channel
Islands National Park, leading hikes before working as a
law-enforcement ranger over the next five years. He spent his time
operating a boat or living on one of the five islands in the park,
serving as a caretaker on an island. The ranger station at San
Miguel consisted of a converted cargo box with no other
inhabitants.
</P>
<P>
   In 1992, Maki transferred to the Santa Monica Mountains National
Recreation Area as a supervisory ranger for the Conejo District. In
1998, Maki was named as the park's computer specialist. The
position's conventional working hours have allowed Maki, a father
of two, to spend more time with his family.
</P>
<P>
   ``I do miss the great outdoors of the park, but I truly enjoy
this extremely dynamic and fast-paced career,'' Maki said. ``I
don't miss working the nights, weekends or holidays. Supervising
computers is a lot easier than people.''
</P>
<P>
   Maki is on 24-hour call, but the typical crisis involves
troubleshooting, helping employees log on or accessing e-mail.
</P>
<P>
   Troubleshooting takes up about half his time, with another 20
percent devoted to backing up files. The remainder is devoted to
keeping up with personal enrichment and technology through the
Internet and magazines. Maki recently completed certification in
managing routers through a course at Moorpark College.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a steep learning curve,'' Maki said. ``Keeping up with
technology is half the battle. Just maintaining a network, you will
start to fall behind. You're always looking for creative ways to
increase speed. There are probably opportunities in the corporate
world, but it is nice to be part of an agency with a mission I
agree with.''

ADVERTISING: TEACHING KIDS ABOUT MARKETING TECHNIQUES 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Vt.)   By ALLISON FASS   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   The concept of summer camp normally conjures up images of
kayaks, campfires, s'mores and color wars. But at a new two-week
day camp, children instead find story boards, video cameras, cut-up
magazines and even the ingredients food stylists use to prepare
prop ice cream cones.
</P>
<P>
   The camp, called Club Media, is designed to teach children how
to be more aware of the persuasion techniques used in marketing.
</P>
<P>
   ``We want them to be aware and empowered _ to be able to think
about the media messages and have a conscious relationship with all
media, not just a passive relationship,'' said Diane Samples, a
director at Club Media, who worked in marketing and corporate
communications for about nine years.
</P>
<P>
   Club Media took place for the first time this month, with 28 10-
to 12-year-old campers, at St. Michael's College in Colchester, Vt.
Each day was split in half. During the mornings, instructors led
sessions on topics ranging from tricky wording in cereal ads
(cereal is part of a balanced breakfast, not a balanced breakfast
on its own) to digital manipulation and distortion of body images.
The goal, Samples said, was to encourage children to ask themselves
important questions about media: Who created a message and why?
What information has been left out that might be important to know?
Can you believe what you see?
</P>
<P>
   The afternoons were designated for group commercial production:
some children brainstormed the theme for an ad agency pitch, while
others acted in and filmed TV spots.
</P>
<P>
   Samples ran the camp, which cost each child $565, with three
other directors who have training and experience in media
education: Amy Damico, Suzanne DeBrosse and Brian Farmer. Samples
also founded Media Knowledge, a nonprofit organization that
developed the program and also runs similar workshops and
presentations for children, parents and teachers throughout the
year. She said media literacy was mostly absent from school
curriculums.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's a critical issue for kids of all ages,'' she
added, ``because they are exposed to media all the time, from the
very youngest of ages, even before school.''
</P>
<P>
   To that end, she left the communications field to teach
children, and those who interact with children the most, how to use
their heads, rather than their hearts, when responding to the
media.
</P>
<P>
   ``The more we can prepare our kids,'' said Yoram Samets,
creative director at Kelliher Samets Volk in Burlington, Vt., who
sent his 11-year-old son, Theo, to the camp, ``the better off
they'll be.''
</P>
<P>
   Samets said he thought Club Media could be a way for children to
find a different perspective, learn how ads are created and
possibly improve their communications skills.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think there's a total lack of integrity in communication,''
he said. ``I'm the captain of propaganda. I fight with this every
single day.''
</P>
<P>
   Barbara Russillo, president at Legale Legwear in New York, part
of DML Marketing, agreed. She sent her 12-year-old son, Matt, to
Club Media because he is interested in film.
</P>
<P>
   ``If it helps him in some career in film or advertising, it
would be great,'' she said. ``If it only helps him film his kids
one day, what the heck? If it makes him a smarter consumer one day,
that's good, too.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I want Matt to be an independent thinker when it comes to
media,'' she added. ``I want him to formulate his own impressions
rather than have media tell him how to think or feel.''
</P>
<P>
   Not everyone agrees with the tenets of media literacy, or thinks
that Media Camp is necessary.
</P>
<P>
   ``Kids seem to be doing a fine job of it on their own, if you
ask me,'' said Doug Zarkin, vice president for business development
and client services at G-Whiz Entertainment in New York, part of
the Grey Global Group, an agency that specializes in marketing to
children, teen-agers and young adults and works for clients like
Aeropostale and Warner Brothers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Next thing you know,'' he added, ``kids will be going to camp
to learn how to tie their shoes.''
</P>
<P>
   Zarkin, who has been working in advertising to the youth market
for more than seven years, also said that principles and guidelines
to regulate advertising to young people had been set up by
organizations like the Children's Advertising Review Unit, known as
CARU, which is part of the Council of Better Business Bureaus and
associated with the National Advertising Review Council.
</P>
<P>
   He said, for example, that a commercial for a toy airplane could
not feature an airplane flying on its own, if it could not actually
fly; the hand of someone playing with it must be evident. Though he
added: ``Kids are not easily deceived, they're very savvy
consumers.''
</P>
<P>
   ``They're jaded,'' said Ron Vos, president at Hi Frequency
Marketing in Carrboro, N.C., a youth marketing and entertainment
agency that works for clients like MTV and Calvin Klein, referring
to what he describes as Generation Y, 10- to 24-year-olds. ``They
grew up over the Internet, they're more media savvy.''
</P>
<P>
   ``To really get in under their shield,'' he added, ``you really
have to be clever and creative and make them laugh and get them
involved.''
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps media literacy programs like Club Media, which Samples
hopes to run again next summer in Vermont as well as in Fairfield
County, Conn., and Westchester County, N.Y., are going to make it
even more complicated to market to youngsters.
</P>
<P>
   ``Put Madison Avenue on warning,'' Samples said, ``a new
generation of media savvy kids are about to hit the streets.''

 &HT;    GOP camp in disarray on issues
 &HT;    By Tom Baxter
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA - Appropriately enough for a period when his campaign
finds itself on the defensive, Republican vice presidential
candidate Dick Cheney came to town Wednesday to speak on the
nation's military readiness.
</P>
<P>
   Repeating one of the themes that seemed to be resounding so well
at the beginning of this month, when the Republicans roared their
approval of him in Philadelphia, Cheney charged that the current
administration is leading the military ``down the wrong road.''
</P>
<P>
   In his Atlanta speech, Gov. George W. Bush's running mate also
said Al Gore was taking unfair advantage of Pentagon officials when
the vice president claims ``all is well'' in the military.
</P>
<P>
   The Atlanta speech was part of a day of talking tax cuts and
military spending across a region where that message has a deep
resonance. But the fact that Cheney was in the South, pounding in
this particular message as August draws to a close, says something
about the shifting tides of the presidential campaign as it draws
close to Labor Day.
</P>
<P>
   The squishy summer polls were never very reliable anyway, so the
Republicans should not lament the tightening to what is currently a
neck-and-neck race. Most Americans were talking about this being a
close race before they actually began reflecting that opinion in
the polls.
</P>
<P>
   What should be of greater concern to the Bush camp is the
disarray in which it finds itself over issues such as prescription
drugs, where Gore is making headway at the moment with the general
proposition that his policy proposals have more depth.
</P>
<P>
   After the Republican National Committee put up an ad on
prescription drugs in Georgia and other states, the Gore campaign
arranged a conference call with former FDA Director David Kessler,
now dean of Yale University Medical School, to blast the ad as
``disingenuous'' and ``false and misleading'' for claiming to have
a plan Bush hasn't covered in his budget estimates.
</P>
<P>
   It's part of the same attack in which Gore currently jabs at
Bush over their debate negotiations, saying Americans need ``an
intelligent, adult discussion.'' And until the Republicans can
steady themselves and come back with a counterpunch, the strategy
is having its effect.
</P>
<P>
   To return for a moment to the subject of military readiness,
here is the very last sentence of a Reuters dispatch about Bill
Clinton's visit to Colombia on Wednesday, which was marked by a
bomb scare and a pledge of $1.3 billion in U.S. aid for the war
against what is still not a very well understood assortment of
narco-terrorists and leftist guerillas:
</P>
<P>
   ``U.S. officials are going to great lengths to try to refute any
notion that the aid package is an initial step in getting involved
in a Vietnam-like quagmire in Colombia.''
</P>
<P>
   You don't have to have that long a memory, or be a defense
analyst, to hear an ominous tone in that sentence.
</P>
<P>
   Quagmires do not have to be ``Vietnam-like'' to be quagmires.
Neither campaign has had much to say about Colombia, which for the
moment is still thought of within the framework of U.S. drug
policy, which both parties support.
</P>
<P>
   But if the military is in fact going down the wrong road, it
would probably lead to a jungle where, until the consequences
become evident, everybody thought we ought to be.

<P>
   PASADENA, Calif. _ Bob Blackburn just wanted to cast his fly
fishing line better.
</P>
<P>
   But what the Pasadena resident found out - and it took him 1
years to learn - is that he needed to be perfect.
</P>
<P>
   Blackburn recently became a certified Fly Fishing Federation fly
caster instructor, an honor only 800 anglers worldwide hold.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was going through their drill,'' he recalls, ``and they were
telling me I was not ready. I had to practice, practice, practice.
It was like remodeling the house. I had to tear that old house
down.''
</P>
<P>
   Casters must pass a written, oral and 2-hour performance test to
receive the certificate. The performance test must be made in front
of a member of the federation's board of governors or in front of
two certified instructors. Casters must perform control, accuracy
and distance casts and instructing ability. They must perform the
technique once and if it's not done perfectly that one time, they
fail. Tests are held only once a year, and the Southwest Council's
test is traditionally held during the Fred Hall Show in Long Beach.
</P>
<P>
   ``We felt that we had a need for a program like this,''
certificate chair and board of governors member Floyd Franke said
from his Bozeman, Mont., office. ``We didn't want just anybody to
be teaching. The board felt that it is a major responsibility to
teach fly fishing instruction.''
</P>
<P>
   The federation began offering the certificate in 1992 and Bruce
Richards of the federation board says about half the applicants
fail the test on their first try.
</P>
<P>
   ``We want very high standards,'' Franke says. ``We have to be
very strict in our expectations because we want to make sure people
that want instruction will be prepared accordingly.''
</P>
<P>
   Among some of the casts that must be done in the performance
test are loop casts, line control, roll casts, accurate false casts
of 20, 30 and 45 feet, roll casts between 45 and 50 feet, double
haul casts of between 45 and 50 feet and a distance cast of a
minimum of 75 feet. Casters then must explain and demonstrate
casting narrow to loops, the cause and correction of tail loops,
changing casting distances, false casting and casting in head and
tail winds.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, the federation offers a Masters certification
program, which further enhances the certificate level, and involves
saltwater techniques, too.
</P>
<P>
   Blackburn, 68, failed in his first attempt at certification. He
began practicing at the Pasadena Casting Club's casting pond in
Lower Arroyo Park six days a week, two to three hours each day.
</P>
<P>
   The retired shopping center developer says he learned to fly
fish with his father 56 years ago, gave up fishing but then
returned to the sport in 1990 when he joined the Pasadena club.
Shortly after joining, he began helping teach casting techniques at
the club's Sunday afternoon casting sessions.
</P>
<P>
   ``I got to the point where I was casting at a certain level, but
I was not going anywhere,'' he said. ``I wanted to cast at that
next level.''
</P>
<P>
   And he discovered he wasn't teaching at a higher level, either.
</P>
<P>
   ``I did not quite completely understand the kinetics, and I was
unable to communicate effectively with students and explain casting
techniques.
</P>
<P>
   ``Having a certificate is like a two-sided coin. On one side you
become a better teacher. On the other side, a better caster.''
</P>
<P>
   The Pasadena Casting Club has three other certified instructors,
Bill Smith, Bill Heath and Steve Lim.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wanted to help people and I felt like I had (to get the
certificate) to do that,'' said Smith, who lives in La Canada. ``I
have to admit, it focuses your attention on working on your
casting.''
</P>
<P>
   Anglers do not need to take any tests to teach fly casting, but
when someone calls seeking lessons, Blackburn says it helps to say
that he has a certificate.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't want to be teaching faults,'' he said. ``We want to
be short and concise and we need to learn how to help students
overcome situations, like when they cast sidearm. The hardest is
teaching casters who already have faults. You have to break down
their muscle memory.''
</P>
<P>
   And perfect casting must include working with anglers with
disabilities.
</P>
<P>
   ``During the test, they asked me about teaching a woman who has
had a mastectomy. I hadn't thought about that. She can't cast
straight up because she has lost muscle. So, she has to start with
a sidearm delivery and then make a circle for the cast.''
</P>
<P>
   In the long run, Blackburn admits the process has made him a
better angler; not because he is catching more fish, but because he
can cast to a wider variety of spots.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can now cast to different spots I couldn't reach before,''
he says. ``That gives me a situation where I have the possibility
to catch more fish.

U.S.-RUSSIA DEDICATE INDUSTRIAL PARK AT OLD NUCLEAR PARK 
</HEADLINE>
   By MICHAEL WINES   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   MOSCOW _ American and Russian officials dedicated a 10-acre
industrial park on Wednesday at what was until recently a
nuclear-weapons factory east of Moscow. It was the second step in a
joint project that American experts hope will provide jobs for up
to 4,000 Russian weapons scientists and workers.
</P>
<P>
   Energy Secretary Bill Richardson attended the ceremony, in the
once-closed nuclear city of Sarov, several hundred miles east of
Moscow. The stop was part of a weeklong sweep through Russia and
other former Soviet states in which Richardson is promoting
programs to curb the spread of nuclear materials and technology.
</P>
<P>
   The United States will contribute $4.5 million next year to help
prepare buildings at the Sarov site for private businesses, and
hopes to spend $8.5 million more on other programs there in 2001,
U.S. officials said on Wednesday. Richardson said the first tenant
at the new Sarov Technopark at Avangard, as the site is called,
would be a German-American venture to make kidney-dialysis machines
and supplies.
</P>
<P>
   A Michigan company also is studying prospects for manufacturing
auto parts in the park, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Richardson toured the remaining operating section of the
top-secret Avangard weapons plant, which is now devoted to
dismantling nuclear arms. In an interview, he said his tour, the
first by an U.S. official, was evidence that ``despite
American-Russian relations suffering a few glitches, in the area of
transparency of nuclear weapons there has been quite a bit of
progress.''
</P>
<P>
   Military cooperation between Russia and the United States has
cooled considerably since NATO's air war against one of the
Kremlin's closest European allies, Yugoslavia, last spring.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a breakthrough in securing Russian nuclear materials
and persuading Russian scientists to stay home and not sell their
expertise to rogue states,'' Richardson said.
</P>
<P>
   About 3,500 people worked at the Avangard plant. The
kidney-dialysis venture should employ about 200, and 100 more work
at a second Russian-American project, a computing center at which
scientists and programmers turn their expertise to commercial
ventures.
</P>
<P>
   Officials said that Credit Suisse First Boston has awarded a
contract to the center to develop electronic-banking and e-commerce
software. Motorola Corp. also is considering employing the
computing center for software projects, officials said.
</P>
<P>
   The computing center already conducts research for the petroleum
industry and in high-energy physics, among other programs.
</P>
<P>
   The Energy Department's Nuclear Cities Initiative has targeted
Sarov and nine other weapons centers for programs to retrain
employees for commercial work, primarily to prevent rogue states
from buying Russian nuclear expertise.
</P>
<P>
   The 3-year-old conversion program is under way so far in only
two cities. But U.S. officials said on Wednesday that the effort at
Sarov has succeeded well enough to allow Russian officials to move
up by two years, to 2003 from 2005, the timetable for closing the
entire weapons plant, the oldest of four that manufactured nuclear
bombs for the Soviet Union.

 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)   &HT;    Undersized work force puts NASA at `critical juncture'
 &HT;    
 &HT;    
 &HT;    By MARK CARREAU
 &HT;    c. 2000 Houston Chronicle
<TEXT>
<P>
   An aging, undersized work force that has shown signs of
job-related stress will be hard-pressed to fly NASA's shuttle
safely as the agency increases the flight rate to assemble the
international space station, congressional auditors warned
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Relying on NASA's internal assessments, the U.S. General
Accounting Office identified 26 technical skill areas, ranging from
computer software work to mechanical engineering, that will require
increased staffing at the Johnson Space Center in Houston and other
spaceflight facilities in Florida, Alabama and Mississippi.
</P>
<P>
   The space agency has reached a ``critical juncture,'' the GAO
said, because its shuttle program work force dropped from 3,000
federal workers in 1995 to 1,800 when NASA stopped the decline last
December.
</P>
<P>
   The drop was part of a wider effort by the Clinton
administration to reduce the federal work force to balance the
budget.
</P>
<P>
   Space agency officials embraced the GAO report, because the
findings essentially echoed a much harsher assessment of shuttle
safety issues prepared by NASA itself in response to an electrical
short that accompanied the July 1999 launching of the shuttle
Columbia.
</P>
<P>
   That incident prompted the Clinton administration to seek an
increase in shuttle spending and NASA to begin a sharp increase in
the number of workers.
</P>
<P>
   ``We think it's a very fair report,'' said Kirsten Williams, a
Washington-based spokeswoman for NASA's shuttle program. ``In a
balanced way it describes the challenges the shuttle program is
facing.''
</P>
<P>
   During the five-year period examined by the GAO, NASA's shuttle
launch rate dropped from eight in 1997 to just three in 1999.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the slowdown was because of Russian economic problems
that delayed the launch of the new station's habitat module by more
than two years.
</P>
<P>
   The Russian-built Zvezda crew living and working quarters
finally joined two other orbiting components of the fledgling
outpost on July 25. That milestone broke the logjam of U.S. station
components waiting to be launched on the shuttle.
</P>
<P>
   Even with fewer missions, the GAO found areas where NASA's
declining workforce was stretched. Where it was the thinnest, the
auditors said, NASA noted signs of overwork and stress, including
forfeited leave, absences from training classes and calls for
stress-related assistance.
</P>
<P>
   The difficulties of NASA's declining work force were further
compounded by its worker demographics, the GAO said.
</P>
<P>
   The space agency employs twice as many workers ages 60 or older
than those younger than 30, a trend that signals a further loss of
experienced personnel when their skills are needed most. The
auditors noted that it typically takes two years to train a new
hire and that the schooling often interferes with other job demands
when there is a worker shortage.
</P>
<P>
   Williams said the agency has been authorized to add 550 workers
by Oct. 1 at the Johnson, Kennedy, Marshall and Stennis space
centers to support a range of shuttle and station activities. The
shuttle program had 94 new hires by the end of July, said Williams.
</P>
<P>
   Additionally, NASA's prime shuttle contractor, United Space
Alliance, has increased by 250 to a total of 3,850 the number of
technicians who prepare shuttle hardware for launch from Kennedy in
Florida.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our work force is up. The training is in place. We are doing
the early preparations that will put us in an extremely good
posture to fly seven to eight flights a year,'' NASA shuttle
program manager Ron Dittemore said earlier this month.
</P>
<P>
   But he acknowledged that with the low flight rates of the past
few years, NASA will have to re-acclimate.
</P>
<P>
   ``The risk is there, and it will be a challenging effort for us
to put everything together,'' said Dittemore. ``There is a
confidence we can do it. It's not an overconfidence. We are being
very cautious.''
</P>
<P>
   The GAO's 20-page report was prepared for the U.S. Senate's
Commerce, Science and Transportation Committee, which has NASA
oversight.

SPIDER-MAN SPRINGS INTO CHINA WITH MORE COMICS 
</HEADLINE>
   By ERIK ECKHOLM   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   BEIJING _ Spider-Man isn't scaling the Great Wall just yet. But
Stan Lee, the legendary impresario of Marvel Comic superheroes, was
in Beijing this week as an honored guest at a ``friendship
banquet'' of leading Japanese and Chinese cartoonists and
animators.
</P>
<P>
   And he just happened to bring along the president and chief
executive officer of Stan Lee Media, a year-old Internet venture
that dreams of marketing Lee's latest characters and products to
1.3 billion Chinese residents.
</P>
<P>
   Lee said he had been invited to Beijing by the Japan-Asia Comics
Exchange Society of Tokyo and by The People's Daily, which jointly
sponsored the banquet and an associated museum exhibition of
Japanese animation drawings and Chinese cartoons. Just why the gray
official newspaper of the Chinese Communist Party was playing host
was not clear.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was one of the most thrilling experiences of my life to
speak before that group,'' Lee said after the banquet. ``It's the
first time Japanese and Chinese artists have been gathered together
in this way, and if anything can bring countries together, it's
cartoons.)
</P>
<P>
   Lee, 77, and the famous characters he helped create in the
heyday of Marvel Comics, including Spider-Man, the Incredible Hulk
and the X-Men, are scarcely known in China. But this month Stan Lee
Media, which is based in Encino, Calif., and calls itself a
``multimedia production, marketing and licensing company,'' formed
a partnership with a leading Japanese producer of animation, the
Venture Soft Co. The venture, perhaps helping explain the
invitation, aims to market Lee's animated Web series and associated
products in Asia.
</P>
<P>
   Marvel-era die-hards may have a hard time digesting some of
Lee's latest creations. True, there is a Web serial called ``The
Seventh Portal,'' featuring superheroes and villains out to conquer
the universe. But his latest projects include an animated Web
series featuring the Backstreet Boys as rock stars by day and
supercrusaders by night with a promotional tie-in at Burger King,
and another series presenting the R&AMP;B singer Mary J. Blige as a
warrior linked to a line of hip-hop clothing.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're using the Internet to launch new branded character
franchises,'' is how Stan Lee Media's chief executive, Ken
Williams, described the company in an interview. Williams is a
former head of Sony's digital studios division.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Seventh Portal,'' Williams said, is likely to reappear as
a live feature film, a ride at Paramount theme parks and a
conventional Saturday morning animated series, and toys are being
licensed.
</P>
<P>
   And, oh yes. ``Well, I think inevitably there will be comic
books,'' he said after being prodded. ``But comics are a relatively
minor part of the revenue stream.''
</P>
<P>
   Williams said that he and Lee were aware of the barriers to
artistic production or sales in China. But the praise Lee heard at
the banquet, he said, ``was a validation of Stan's work and a
validation of the idea of entering China with American-style
animation.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We'll be back, and we'll be exploring ways we can work in
China,'' Williams said. ``We'll be moving resolutely but
judiciously.''
</P>
<P>
   As Disney and other Western entertainment groups have
discovered, gaining access to produce films or Web content in China
or even to market imported products faces stiff obstacles. For
example, this year's X-Men movie, loosely based on the old comic
book, has not been approved for commercial screening in China,
which strictly limits film imports, although pirated video compact
discs sell well. This may soften somewhat after China joins the
World Trade Organization.
</P>
<P>
   Chinese children often read translations of Japanese or
Taiwanese cartoon books and favor some Japanese animated serials
that are allowed on Chinese television. The domestic products tend
to be bland.
</P>
<P>
   China's political leaders have often expressed concern about an
influx of foreign animated cartoons, said William Brent, president
of China Entertainment Network, a consulting concern in Shanghai.
``They've repeatedly called for animation by the Chinese for the
Chinese,'' Mr. Brent said.
</P>
<P>
   Animated shows and other children's fare are closely scrutinized
by government censors who worry about excess violence as well as
what they deem inappropriate cultural or political content.
</P>
<P>
   ``If the Stan Lee group thinks they can come into China and make
superheroes along Western lines, they'll be disappointed,'' Brent
said. ``If they can find a way to develop home-grown superheroes
here, they'll have a better chance.''

VIRTUAL HOUSE TOUR ALLAYS URGE TO PEEP 
</HEADLINE>
   (Circuits)  
 By MICHELLE SLATALLA   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ I have what has been described as a ``sconce
problem,'' which explains why I like to loiter outside strangers'
houses at dusk and peer through the windows at their lighting
fixtures.
</P>
<P>
   The specialist who diagnosed this malady (my husband), has also
formed some preliminary theories about a related condition he calls
``coveting your neighbors' furniture arrangements.'' He believes
that both are incurable. The only recommended treatment is to take
the dog along on these ``walks'' to establish a plausible excuse
for lurking in case the police show up.
</P>
<P>
   But that was before Pottery Barn started a Web site this month.
The site's Home Tour invites shoppers to examine a layout that
shows the entire first floor of a real house (belonging to a family
in Piedmont, Calif.), then click on any room to start nosing
around, I mean, touring the premises. It is a kind of home remedy
for people like me who want not only to gaze through a stranger's
windows, but also to get inside to take a closer look at those
sconces flanking the fireplace in the living room.
</P>
<P>
   The idea behind the tour was to immerse a shopper in the
atmosphere of a real house, where it is possible to imagine oneself
reading a book while lolling in the Marseilles Leather Armchair
($1,649) or rolling out pie dough on the Hampstead Marble-Top Prep
Table ($699) in the kitchen.
</P>
<P>
   In some ways, this is much safer than my old method of snooping,
because it will not lead to a misdemeanor charge. But it also has
the potential to be far more dangerous for a longtime Pottery Barn
addict like myself, because Pottery Barn replaced the real-life
furniture (and sconces) with items that you can buy online.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, as a longtime customer _ I once considered a 12-step
program to wean myself from compulsive purchases of the company's
cotton velvet drapery panels _ I was dubious about whether the
company's new online component would add anything to the
tried-and-true Pottery Barn shopping experience. After all, for
years I had been seeing products displayed in real-room settings in
the company's catalogs.
</P>
<P>
   My skepticism was prompted by a twinge of resentment that I have
been harboring toward Pottery Barn's parent company, Williams
Sonoma Inc. The company has been slow to start online shopping
sites, a delay that has made it hard to compare prices.
</P>
<P>
   I do not want to sound whiny, but do you know what it is like,
every time you stumble across a promising home-furnishing product
online, to have to get up from the computer, walk down to the
kitchen bookshelf, dig through catalogs to find the latest Pottery
Barn offering, then page through the thing looking for some item _
a magazine rack, a cabinet knob _ that you vaguely remembered
seeing?
</P>
<P>
   After causing me such pain, Pottery Barn thinks it can tardily
waltz online and offer me a search function and all will be
forgotten?
</P>
<P>
   ``We wanted to take our time to focus on developing a model that
would really work, to develop an online visual and shopping
experience that would satisfy our customers,'' said Shelley
Nandkeolyar, vice president of the eCommerce division at Williams
Sonoma Inc.
</P>
<P>
   Grudgingly, I admitted the delay may have made business sense.
Although many other online home-furnishing retailers are flailing _
Living.com went out of business earlier this month and
Furniture.com barely avoided the same fate earlier this summer with
a last-minute infusion of cash _ it is a good time for
Potterybarn.com. Unlike those Internet upstarts, Pottery Barn sells
a well-known brand, has plenty of inventory and has a reliable
record when it comes to distribution and customer service.
</P>
<P>
   ``People have purchased something from the company before and
know that it's a quality product, but more important, that it's a
quality shopping experience,'' said Barrett Ladd, a senior analyst
at Gomez.com, which publishes reviews of online retailers. ``The
important thing for them is to try to differentiate the Web site
from what they already have in their catalog. They have to add
something.''
</P>
<P>
   With that in mind, I took a closer look at the site, which had a
clean design and simple, intuitive text and visual cues to aid
navigation. With the search function it was a cinch to find
information about any of the 3,000 products the company sells
online. Another important customer service convenience: you can
return any product you buy online to any of the 341 free-standing
Pottery Barn stores.
</P>
<P>
   Using Home Tour, I examined the house from the vantage of
someone who finally got inside a stranger's house. Although the
verisimilitude of the experience would have been enhanced if there
were a few pairs of children's shoes or some dog hair on the rug, I
was still having fun as I ran the cursor down the list of products
for sale.
</P>
<P>
   I clicked Mica Sconce to read the description: ``Shades made of
amber-toned mica, a thin material that creates warm ambient
light.'' At $89 each, I thought they might have been just what I
was looking for if I did not already own three pairs of garage-sale
sconces (including one set still packed away in a box).
</P>
<P>
   As I examined the Living Room more closely, I realized that the
thing that originally had captured my interest when I started the
Home Tour by peeping through the windows had been the beautiful
built-in bookcases that flanked the sconces. Now, I know the
architectural details in this house are not part of the Pottery
Barn merchandise list. Still, I printed out the image to store in
an already-bulging folder labeled ``Things to Ask the Carpenter to
Copy.''
</P>
<P>
   My specialist thinks that folder might be evidence of another
disease. But at least my sconce problem was in remission.

   c. Houston Chronicle
</P>
<P>
   AUSTIN _ In Houston, it took more than a year for a disabled
youth to replace the wheelchair he had outgrown. In Dallas, the
shortage of dentists serving the poor is so severe that only
patients with rotten teeth get prompt attention. In the Panhandle,
migrant workers often go unaware of their eligibility for free
health care.
</P>
<P>
   These were some of the Medicaid problems in Texas described by
Senior U.S. District Judge William Wayne Justice in his latest
bombshell ruling _ this time in a class action lawsuit over
indigent medical care. The judge concluded that more than 1 million
Texas children are poorly served by programs that are inadequately
funded and poorly managed.
</P>
<P>
   The ruling _ from the same judge who controlled Texas prisons
and mental health institutions for decades _ immediately set off a
rhetorical skirmish in the presidential campaign. Democratic Vice
President Al Gore assailed the performance of Republican Gov.
George W. Bush, who defended his efforts to extend health care to
needy families.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've got a good record signing kids up for Medicaid. We
intend to continue to do so,'' he said, adding, ``we're a
compassionate state.''
</P>
<P>
   Justice's scathing, 175-page ruling left Texas lawmakers
wondering what they might have to do to remedy Medicaid problems by
Oct. 13, as the judge demanded. It also sent state lawyers
scurrying to formulate a planned appeal due on Sept. 9. If a stay
were granted, remedial action could be postponed indefinitely
</P>
<P>
   ``We are disappointed with the judge's ruling and believe it
does not represent a fair or accurate portrayal of Texas' efforts
to provide health care to children on Medicaid,'' said Bush
campaign spokesman Dan Bartlett.
</P>
<P>
   ``Based upon where the state was in 1993, when the suit was
filed, and where we are today, we've made dramatic progress and
will improve upon that progress in the areas of outreach and
enrollment efforts,'' Bartlett said.
</P>
<P>
   Attorney General John Cornyn was unavailable for comment, but
spokeswoman Andrea Horton said, ``We believe neither the law nor
the facts support Judge Justice's decision.'' And Bush spokeswoman
Karen Hughes called the ruling the product of a ``liberal activist
judge.''
</P>
<P>
   Justice assailed the state's failure to provide medical and
dental checkups to many eligible adults and children and he
criticized the state's efforts to make services known to them.
Calling its data ``inflated and inaccurate,'' Justice said the
government exaggerated the number of people contacted and treated.
</P>
<P>
   Further, Justice said managed care was inhibiting access to
treatment by specialists and for mental health and pediatric
patients. Justice also cited logistical problems including poorly
publicized and operated transportation services, an inadequately
staffed toll-free help line and long delays in providing supplies
to patients.
</P>
<P>
   He cited the case of ``C.O.,'' a Harris County junior high
school student with cerebral palsy who outgrew his wheelchair.
</P>
<P>
   ``It took more than a year for C.O. to get a replacement
wheelchair. Unfortunately, C.O.'s troubles are not unusual,''
Justice said, noting that nearly half of the clients surveyed
reported problems obtaining special medical equipment.
</P>
<P>
   Justice also found a lack of medical services and outreach to
migrant families in the Lubbock area and he criticized as
inadequate the help offered to abused and neglected children
statewide.
</P>
<P>
   A lack of dentists has caused major problems in some areas,
Justice added. He said Dallas-area experts testified that a local
shortage was so critical that the only children getting treatment
through Medicaid were those with abscesses and rotten teeth.
</P>
<P>
   The lawsuit was filed in 1993 on behalf of 1.5 million indigent
children entitled to health benefits through the Early Periodic
Screening, Diagnosis and Treatment program, also known as ``Texas
Health Steps.''
</P>
<P>
   A consent decree was approved in 1996 but plaintiffs returned to
court claiming the decree was ignored. Justice agreed, despite the
state's claims that programs were continually improved.
</P>
<P>
   ``The increased efforts have resulted in notable advancements in
all areas of the program's performance, from outreach to numbers of
eligibles served to staff resources allocated, making it one of the
most successful in the country,'' a brief filed by Cornyn said.
</P>
<P>
   Further defending the state's efforts, Cornyn claimed:
</P>
<P>
   -- The medical checkup participation rate increased from 29
percent in 1993 to 66 percent currently;
</P>
<P>
   -- Program staff has grown from 10 in 1993, when the Medicaid
program was transferred to the Texas Department of Health, to
almost 600 workers now.
</P>
<P>
   -- The program made almost 5 million outreach contacts with
clients in 1999 _ about three times a year for each client.
</P>
<P>
   -- From 1993 to 1999, the Medicaid transportation program
expenditures increased from $19 million to $39 million.
</P>
<P>
   -- The dental program's expenditures have grown from $87 million
in 1993 to $140 million now.
</P>
<P>
   -- Some 87 percent of Medicaid recipients recognize the Texas
Health Steps name; and
</P>
<P>
   -- The participation rate for eligible teens rose from 37
percent in 1996 to 55 percent in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, Justice's ruling said there was ample proof that
the decree was violated.
</P>
<P>
   Plaintiff's attorney Susan Zinn of San Antonio said she was
delighted by the ruling.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think he's trying to say that the Texas Medicaid program is
not following federal law that Congress established in 1989. It's
more than 10 years later and they still haven't come through,'' she
said.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the remedies lie with the Legislature, whose next
regular session is in January. A special session appears
unnecessary at this time, state officials said, but questions about
future funding are already being posed.
</P>
<P>
   ``The dental program is under funded. The case management
program is under funded,'' Zinn said.
</P>
<P>
   The Legislature's decision in 1999 to establish a moratorium on
expansion of the managed care programs under Medicaid was
appropriate, Zinn added.
</P>
<P>
   ``Judge Justice's order confirms that Texas has a long way to go
before more expansion of the managed care program would be
warranted, because there are so many problems,'' Zinn said.
</P>
<P>
   Yet, money won't solve all the woes, a key lawmaker said.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are lots of things we know we don't do enough of _
public schools, teachers' salaries, children's health insurance,
nursing home (reimbursement) rates,'' said Senate Finance Chairman
Bill Ratliff, R-Mt. Pleasant.
</P>
<P>
   ``The problem I have of federal judges saying `you're not doing
enough' is one day they need to be in the shoes of the people
paying for it,'' Ratliff said.
</P>
<P>
   The Chronicle's Austin bureau chief Clay Robison contributed to
this report.

   NEW YORK _ Venus Williams is playing so well that she can afford
to pick on the little things. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel my forehand down the line isn't where I want it to
be,'' the third-seeded Williams said after dismantling Kveta
Hrdlickova, 6-1, 6-1, in the second round Wednesday at the U.S.
Open in Flushing Meadows-Corona Park. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Sixth-seeded Monica Seles, ninth-seeded Arantxa Sanchez-Vicario,
11th-seeded Sandrine Testud and 15th-seeded Jennifer Capriati faced
a similar lack of resistance on a day nearly upstaged by Damir
Dokic, the father of Jelena Dokic of Australia. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Organizers banished the father from the tournament after an
official reported Dokic had verbally abused him in the players'
lounge and thrown his own grounds pass on the floor while ranting
about the price of salmon. The 43rd-ranked Jelena Dokic, a
Wimbledon semifinalist who won her first-round singles match
Tuesday and a doubles match Wednesday, was nearby. Damir Dokic was
thrown out of Wimbledon in July for disruptive behavior that
included smashing a journalist's cell phone, and was arrested at a
tournament in Birmingham, England, two years ago for lying down in
traffic. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Williams, the Wimbledon champion, anchored the calm part of the
day, in which favorites marched through their opponents like
practice fodder. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Williams dissected her performance because there was nothing
really to say about Hrdlickova, whose offense was limited to two
winners to Williams' 29. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   By late afternoon, there were no upsets on the men's side
either. Third-seeded Magnus Norman ripped 56 winners to sweep Paul
Goldstein, 7-5, 6-4, 6-4; sixth-seeded Marat Safin defeated Thierry
Guardiola, 7-5, 6-7 (5), 6-4, 6-4; 10th-seeded Cedric Pioline beat
Sargis Sargsian, 6-3, 6-3, 6-1, and 15th seeded Mark Philippoussis
was a 6-3, 6-2, 6-3 winner over Albert Portas.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Seles committed 25 unforced errors, but she still tamed the
35th-ranked Anne Kremer, 6-3, 6-4. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Seles once owned this place. She won titles in 1991 and 1992
before she was stabbed in 1993 by a fan during a match in Germany.
Seles took two years off to heal, and has been a Top 10 occupant
for much of the time since her return in 1995. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A new era of sinew and full-court aggression emerged during
Seles' comeback. But Seles sticks to her old game plan like a
security blanket, patrolling the baseline with limited range and
laser groundstrokes. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Her familiar style has made her a sentimental favorite. When
Seles began talking to herself after a lapse in concentration
against Kremer, a fan yelled, ``C'mon, Monica!'' Seles said the
encouragement snapped her out of it. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``It's nice to have that support behind you when you go out on
the court, when you struggle,'' she said. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Seles's miscues did not hurt her Wednesday. She hit 29 winners
to Kremer's 16. By the time Kremer figured out a way to stretch
Seles' two-handed strokes into one-handed lunges, it was too late.
After a long rally, Kremer netted a forehand to end the match after
just 1 hour 9 minutes. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In the third round, Seles will face Chanda Rubin, a 2-6, 6-1,
6-1 winner over Barbara Schett. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Safin, who has won three tournaments in 2000, blamed his slow
start on a 10-day layoff since losing to Gustavo Kuerten in the
Indianapolis final. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``Even not playing your best tennis, you have to have this
attitude on the court where you try to make the game easier,''
Safin said. ``I don't have to make winners, just play my game.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In another men's match, Greg Rusedski, the Open runner-up in
1997, defeated Magnus Gustafsson, 6-1, 6-2, 6-4. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   For the women, Testud took advantage of 30 unforced errors by
Iroda Tulyaganoa to win, 6-4, 6-3. &QL;

   KARABULAK, Russia _ An August thunderstorm had just shredded the
roof and walls of Raisa Gotsayeva's canvas tent, and she was airing
out the bedding and washing the floorboards when a visitor came
across her dirt threshold to inquire about conditions in the sea of
tents here on the border with Chechnya.
</P>
<P>
   Set on the arid plain that sweeps up toward the Caucasus
Mountains, barely visible in the distance, this makeshift camp in
Ingushetia, which resembles an army bivouac, has taken the name
Sputnik.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I went to tell the authorities here that our tents are
leaking, they simply replied, `Why don't you go home?''' she said,
with a ring of indignation in her voice.
</P>
<P>
   She straightened her dress and motioned with more than a little
exasperation at the clutter of bunks, clothes and cooking utensils
that now defines her life, which she describes as ``sitting on
suitcases.''
</P>
<P>
   ``There is no other place I would rather go than home,'' said
Gotsayeva, who fled Chechnya last October after Russian rockets
destroyed the central market in Grozny, the capital. She had been
selling clothes there when the rockets hit, killing 140 people.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would go with great pleasure,'' she said. ``I would go
tomorrow, but my house is destroyed, there is no work there, and
every night there is shooting and they detain all the young men. If
you have a beard, they say you are a rebel. If you have a cut or a
scar, they say you are a rebel.
</P>
<P>
   ``We would go home with pleasure. But we are afraid, and there
are no guarantees there for our security.''
</P>
<P>
   After a year of fighting, Russia's armed forces have declared
that the war against separatists in Chechnya is effectively over,
with only ``mopping up'' operations continuing.
</P>
<P>
   Some 155,000 people are still refugees, and the task of
returning them to their devastated land has confronted Moscow and
international aid groups with another problem: almost no one wants
to go home to a country where gunfire rules the night and where no
family feels safe after reports of rape, torture and abuse at the
hands of Russian military forces.
</P>
<P>
   Now another winter is coming, and hopes here are flagging. The
mammoth relief effort that has sustained the Chechen refugee
population is suffering from fatigue among donors. Bread
distribution here was cut off for six weeks this summer because the
Russian government failed to pay food vendors.
</P>
<P>
   The United Nations food relief coordinator for Russia, Bnim K.
Udas, said in an interview that his program did not have enough
food to get through September. A U.N. appeal for more food
assistance to Chechen refugees was sent out in June, he said. ``But
we have only received a response from the United States and
Canada,'' he added. ``No other countries made pledges so far,
including the European countries.''
</P>
<P>
   Ingushetia's top disaster coordinator, Valery Kuksa, told
reporters earlier in August that about 50,000 refugees were living
in tent camps and in abandoned train cars, but that this winter
there would be spaces in warm tents for only about 25,000 refugees.
He added that the ``official position'' of the Russian government
was that ``by Oct. 1, all Chechens should be in Chechnya.''
</P>
<P>
   One government plan is to move the refugee camps just across the
border into Chechnya, removing them from what they view as the
protection of the Ingushetia government. In Chechnya, whether in
camps or back home, they would be policed by the Russian army and
the Moscow-appointed administration of Akhmad Kadyrov.
</P>
<P>
   But the refugees here insist that they will not return to their
republic until the shooting ends and the army stops inciting fear
among civilians with late-night knocks on the door, incessant
checkpoint searches, intimidation and extortion.

   The line between law enforcement and oppression in Chechnya is
difficult to distinguish even from the official communiques.
</P>
<P>
   On Aug. 17, for example, a statement issued from the office of
Sergei Yastrzhembsky, an aide to President Vladimir Putin, said 44
people had been arrested after ``search and raid operations'' in
the villages of Alkhankala and Alkhan-Yurt in the preceding 24
hours.
</P>
<P>
   Those arrested included Chechens with ``scars from wounds'' and
individuals who had secretly transported the bodies of rebels after
they had been killed in battle _ presumably to carry out the
tradition among the Muslim Chechens to bury them by sundown.
</P>
<P>
   ``Kadyrov says come home, but how can we come home when the
Russians promise endless mopping-up operations?'' said Taharik
Vitaiyevo as she passed through a field of open latrines and
outhouses. ``We would approve of Kadyrov if he would do something
to end the war.''
</P>
<P>
   Every family at the Sputnik camp has a story. Many have sent
family members back to Grozny this summer to conduct reconnaissance
on whether it is safe to return. For most, the answer has been no.
</P>
<P>
   Zainab Ismailova, 41, arrived in Ingushetia on July 31 with her
three children. On her first attempt to get here last December, the
family narrowly escaped death when her refugee convoy was attacked
by Russian helicopters, she said. Now, she is determined not to
leave Ingushetia ``until I am sure that nothing will happen to my
family when I return'' home.
</P>
<P>
   Sitting on a cot among her new neighbors, Ismailova kept her
eyes on her 2-year-old son, Islam. ``I left Grozny because of this
child,'' she explained. ``During the whole war we stayed in the
city, living in the cellar, but my son cannot stand to hear
aviation noise anymore. He becomes paralyzed with fear.''
</P>
<P>
   Many children here suffer from nightmares and paralyzing fear.
One father said his daughter passes out when she hears a jet or
helicopter. It reminds her of the bombing. A woman fears that her
infant son has nerve damage, because his leg shakes when he sleeps.
</P>
<P>
   There is one tent where disturbed children are getting
psychological counseling. They draw pictures: Grozny in flames,
flowers coming out of cannons (titled ``The World as It Should
Be''), a screaming girl with body parts around her and a devastated
landscape called ``Bloody Sunday in the City of Shali.''
</P>
<P>
   ``These children have seen a great deal of evil in the last
year,'' said Khamila Khadisova, a Chechen schoolteacher working
with the children. ``Many drawings here show acts of revenge, but
this is very unwished for. We do everything we can to lighten their
pain and brighten their mood by dwelling on peace and friendship.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Not far from here, in the village of Gamuriyevo, 100 Chechen
refugees have moved into an abandoned house. All that was left by
the time Zarima Dzaitayev, 44, and her husband showed up was the
garage, which they share with 10 other people.
</P>
<P>
   ``I returned to our home near Grozny recently,'' Dzaitayev said.
``It was an apartment building, and now two of the entrances have
collapsed and there is nothing left.
</P>
<P>
   ``We would like to go home, even if we had to live in the
basement, but it is impossible because someone shoots at night, or
the soldiers come to you drunk and ask for money or vodka,'' she
said, adding, ``My daughter is 17 and I don't want to take her
there.''
</P>
<P>
   For now, Dzaitayev and her husband, a construction engineer who
worked for the Chechen government and who has not been paid in
three years, will remain in the garage. They sleep on mats on the
concrete floor with their children.
</P>
<P>
   ``Last winter my mother died and we had to take her home to bury
her,'' Dzaitayev said, ``but at the checkpoints the Russians
suspected we were smuggling weapons, because my mother's body was
wrapped in a blanket, and so we had to unwrap her to show them and
then pay a bribe.''
</P>
<P>
   Dzaitayev began to cry, interrupting herself to say: ``Not every
Chechen is a bandit. Every nation has good and bad people in it,
but they call us a criminal nation, and it is not right.''

STRIP-SEARCH OF CHINESE BUSINESSWOMAN HAS PORTLAND DEFENDING ITS
IMAGE 
</HEADLINE>
   By SAM HOWE VERHOVEK   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   PORTLAND, Ore. _ ``Monstrous'' is the word used by Portland's
mayor, Vera Katz. The executive director of the Port of Portland
says the city's reputation has been tarred by ``Gestapo-type
actions.'' A state senator here says the conduct in question is
``racist and xenophobic.'' And U.S. Sen. Gordon Smith, a
Republican, put it this way Wednesday: ``We don't want Portland to
be known as ``Deportland.''
</P>
<P>
   All four are talking about the conduct of the local branch of
the federal Immigration and Naturalization Service. The furor has
been fanned by the recent strip-search and two-night jailing of a
Chinese businesswoman who had landed here on her way to New York.
But public officials were already concerned that immigration agents
were detaining or deporting foreign travelers at a much higher rate
than at other West Coast airports.
</P>
<P>
   For Portland, which labored mightily to persuade Delta Air Lines
to establish a mini-hub here with nonstop flights to Asia, the
controversy over the immigration office has been a blow to the
city's image abroad. The South China Morning Post reported recently
that the city was already known as ``Deportland'' in some Asian
countries, and the Kyodo News Service of Japan has also reported on
the problems, prompting some Japanese travel agencies to advise
their customers to avoid flying through Portland if they can avoid
doing so.
</P>
<P>
   Delta has already scaled back its cross-Pacific flights to
Portland to two a day, both from Japan, having once had four daily
nonstops, including flights from Seoul and Taipei.
</P>
<P>
   And, citing fears that the controversy over the immigration
service's treatment of foreigners here may lead the airline to
scrap them altogether, public officials here have begun mounting a
furious campaign to revamp the office. The mayor, the governor and
both U.S. senators here, as well as one from neighboring Washington
state, have all called for the resignation of the local director.
</P>
<P>
   For Portland, which prides itself on being one of the nation's
more livable and culturally tolerant cities, the entire controversy
is strange and wounding, and it could have severe economic
consequences. A Port of Portland study said that losing the direct
air link to Asia could cost the city as much as $900 million a year
in lost trade and tourism. And even as the immigration agency has
faced accusations of mistreatment or insensitivity in its dealings
with foreigners at ports-of-entry around the country, the criticism
here is particularly harsh, prompting officials to promise a
complete review of the Portland office.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are absolutely committed to restoring public confidence in
our operations at PDX,'' said Virginia Kice, a spokeswoman for the
agency's western division, using the three-letter airport code for
Portland. ``We will not rest until the job is done. We're on the
offensive here, and I mean that in a good way.''
</P>
<P>
   Inspectors at the Portland airport will be given additional
training in ``cultural awareness and professional communications
skills,'' Kice said, and the western regional director for the
agency, Johnny Williams, traveled to Portland on Monday to meet
with public officials and announce other procedures, including
higher-level authorization for decisions to detain or search
foreigners arriving at the airport, and a better system for
translation.
</P>
<P>
   Even as they acknowledged that Portland's deportation rates were
indeed demonstrably higher than those in Los Angeles, San Francisco
and Seattle, immigration officials noted that the vast majority of
foreigners were admitted into the country at any of those airports,
and that the difference in rates between Portland and other West
Coast airports had narrowed significantly in the past year.
</P>
<P>
   According to the immigration agency, from May through July of
this year, Portland turned back 58 of 34,694 foreigners arriving
here, meaning that it admitted 99.83 percent of all such
passengers. Seattle admitted all but 80 of 122,633 (99.94 percent),
and Los Angeles admitted all but 752 of 1,236,679 (also 99.94
percent).
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, they said, there may be additional reasons that
Portland has a higher rate of deportations, the officials said.
Because it has much smaller numbers of foreign travelers, they
said, agents here may actually be able to do a better job of
screening out counterfeit documents, and a higher percentage of
people arriving here are workers, who are more likely than tourists
to have problems proving they have the proper authorization to
remain in the country.
</P>
<P>
   None of that, however, seems to have quelled the public outrage
here or the perception abroad that Portland is a bad place to enter
the country. And the strip-search treatment of the Chinese
businesswoman, which was brought to light by a news article in The
Oregonian, the daily newspaper here, was described as the ``last
straw'' by Mike Thorne, the executive director of the Port of
Portland.
</P>
<P>
   The woman, Guo Liming, of Guangzhou, China, arrived here on a
flight Aug. 19. An agent, who has not been publicly identified by
the immigration service, decided that her passport was suspicious
because the laminate over the photograph was loose (meaning the
photograph could have been replaced). The director of the office
here, David Beebe, also later told the Oregonian that the woman
``fit the profile'' of an illegal immigrant because she was
traveling with another person _ a man who turned out to be her
fiance.
</P>
<P>
   Guo was shortly removed to room where she was order to strip
down to her underwear, and was inspected by two female agents. Then
she was handcuffed and taken to Northern Oregon Regional
Corrections Facility in The Dalles, 80 miles away, while the agency
investigated whether her passport was bogus. Inspectors declined to
tell her fiance, Hsieh Tsuhui, where she was, and he finally
resorted to hiring a Portland immigration lawyer to track her down.
</P>
<P>
   After spending two nights in jail, Guo was told by the
immigration service that her passport was indeed authentic, and
they brought her back to the airport for a flight to New York.
Beebe initially defended the agency's treatment of her, but after
the article in the Oregonian about her ordeal sparked a storm of
outrage, he reviewed the incident, announced that agents had erred
in their handling of her, and offered Guo an apology. She is
traveling and could not be reached for an interview, said her
Portland lawyer, Bao Lin Chen.
</P>
<P>
   The incident was not an isolated one: the immigration service
here has come under fire for jailings of other foreigners,
including six Chinese teen-agers seeking asylum. But Beebe has
resisted calls from elected officials for his resignation, and the
agency has not announced any disciplinary action against the agents
who dealt with Guo.
</P>
<P>
   Beebe referred calls to the immigration service's regional
office in Laguna Niguel, Calif. Williams, the director there, said
it was too early to call for anyone's dismissal here. ``You would
not jump to that kind of a decision without benefit of a full look
at all the issues at hand,'' he said.

 RELIGIOUS LEADERS LOOK TO BUILD ON MEETING 
</HEADLINE>
   By GUSTAV NIEBUHR   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   UNITED NATIONS _ One religious leader among hundreds who have
come from around the world to New York this week to talk about
peace, Dastur Firoze M. Kotwal said he hoped the four-day gathering
fosters friendships across faith boundaries, a sharing of
viewpoints and ``unity among religions.''
</P>
<P>
   ``And this,'' added Dr. Kotwal, a soft-spoken, bearded dastur,
or high priest among Zoroastrians in Bombay, India, ``will suppress
violence and terrorism that is going on in the name of religion.''
</P>
<P>
   He was not alone in expressing such hopes for the Millennium
World Peace Summit of Religious and Spiritual Leaders, which
convened late Monday at the United Nations and has since moved to a
nearby hotel.
</P>
<P>
   Funded largely by corporations and held in collaboration with
the U.N. General Secretary's office, the conference has brought
together people as distinguished by their professed good intentions
as by the diversity of their theologies and the different hues and
shapes of their dress.
</P>
<P>
   Talking about how they might work together to stifle conflict,
ease poverty and help the environment are Shiite Muslims in dark
turbans, Buddhist monks in saffron robes, black-suited Christian
clerics and men and women from tribal groups.
</P>
<P>
   After a formal opening at the United Nations, group discussions
have been closed. On Thursday, the conference is to issue a
declaration endorsing specific measures on behalf of world peace.
</P>
<P>
   In interviews, several participants called the event significant
for its venue, having allowed religious leaders access en mass to
the United Nations _ a forum typically reserved for political
leaders _ and for having afforded people of such diverse
backgrounds the chance to meet.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is very important,'' said Gensho Hozumi, chief priest of
a Zen Buddhist temple in Kyoto, Japan. ``For the first time, to be
heard in the United Nations.''
</P>
<P>
   But a major shadow over the conference has been the absence of
the Dalai Lama, spiritual leader of Tibet, whose participation at
the United Nations was blocked by China's objections.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the conference's business has been taking place
informally in the hotel corridors, where participants meet one
another, exchange business cards, even take each other's photos.
</P>
<P>
   For some, the sight of such harmony has imparted the sense that
a common purpose is at work. ``It's good to see we are all here to
work for peace, and for the love of God, and to do something for
the society,'' said Sister Marie-Odila Perochan, dressed in a nun's
habit, a crucifix around her neck. She is a member of Fraternite
Notre-Dame, a Roman Catholic order based in France, which runs
charitable projects worldwide, including one in Harlem.
</P>
<P>
   Among participants, a frequent theme is that government
officials need to know that religious leaders still carry
considerable influence and thus could help in large-scale good
works.
</P>
<P>
   Sayyed Mohammed Musawi, secretary general of the World Ahlul
Bayt Islamic League, a Shiite Muslim organization in London, said
that ``the United Nations' noble causes cannot be implemented by
governments only, unless there is participation'' by people within
those nations. ``And nobody can influence the people of the nations
more than the religious leaders,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to talking about peace, some have come with specific
concerns, particularly related to the environment. Paul Gualingua
Toala, a member of a three-man delegation representing the Quichua,
an Indian group in Ecuador, said the delegation wants to spread the
word about ecological problems in the Amazon.
</P>
<P>
   Wylee LaRocque, a member of the Turtle Mountain Band of the
Chippewa tribe, from Belcourt, N.D., voiced a similar concern. ``To
take care of the earth,'' he said, when asked what message the
Chippewas wanted to send.
</P>
<P>
   ``If there's a thing that all people have in common, regardless
of race or income level, we all live on the same planet,'' said
LaRocque, whose eagle feather headdress, rabbit bone vest and
beaded moccasins made him a person with whom a stream of delegates
wanted to have their pictures taken.
</P>
<P>
   But some participants also said they were disappointed that time
alotted for individual speakers was too short to allow much depth
of discussion in the formal sessions.
</P>
<P>
   Rabbi Rene Samuel Sirat, former chief rabbi of France and
currently vice president of the conference of rabbis of Europe,
said, ``There are so many people here who would like to express
themselves, and they're only given a limited time to get their
message across.'' He suggested that another such meeting, perhaps
in two or three years, could build on the momentum.
</P>
<P>
   And at least one person voiced concern about the challenge posed
by religious leaders not attending, whose views are antithetical to
peaceful encounters between faiths.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have to marginalize religious leaders who are peace
spoilers and are inciting hatred and nationalistic passions, which
destroys life,'' said Rabbi Arthur Schneier of New York, president
of the Appeal of Conscience Foundation, which has sought to foster
interfaith dialogue.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's nice to come together here,'' he said, ``but we have a
lot of those who are out there who are not in sync, and who are
seeking to undermine our peacemaking, bridge-building efforts.''

23 HURT IN PARIS SUBWAY DERAILMENT 
</HEADLINE>
  (EDS: no byline) 
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   PARIS _ A mysterious derailment injured 24 passengers in the
Paris subway Wednesday, but a catastrophe was narrowly averted
because the car that had tipped over skidded to a halt only 3 feet
from a train on the opposite track.
</P>
<P>
   Accidents in the Paris subway, which celebrated its 100th
birthday this year, are rare. Many of the trains, which run more
slowly and considerably more quietly than New York subways, have
side wheels that help stabilize them.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday's derailment happened at 1:23 p.m. as the lead car of
a No. 12 train coming into the Notre Dame de Lorette station at
normal speed just ``keeled over on the opposite track,'' said Alain
Caire, controller general of security for the subway system. In his
31 years on the job,
</P>
<P>
   Caire said, ``I never saw a train keel over like that.''
</P>
<P>
   Passengers suffered cuts and bruises and one had a leg broken.
Firefighters quickly activated ``the Red Plan,'' designed for bombs
or terrorist incidents and nearly 200 firefighters in 20 trucks
converged on the scene and set up first aid stations on the subway
platform and in a nearby cafe. The neighborhood, where the
boulevards of central Paris begin the climb up to the narrow alleys
of bohemian Montmartre, was closed off for hours by dozens of
police officers.
</P>
<P>
   Other officials said it was possible something on the tracks had
knocked over the car and an investigation was ordered.
</P>
<P>
   The minor accident came on the heels of a major disaster for
French transport, the crash of a supersonic Concorde on takeoff
from a Paris airport, which killed 113. Preliminary results of an
investigation into that crash are due to be released Thursday.
Chief blame in that case is expected to focus on a piece of metal
left on the runway that burst a tire.

 &HT;    Jewelers try to avoid war-tainted diamonds
 &HT;    By Kirsten Searer
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ African rebels have proved that a good diamond can buy
a lot of buried land mines, rusty machetes and dull axes.
</P>
<P>
   Now some diamond dealers say they can make sure that doesn't
happen anymore. For years, militants have funded their brutal
campaigns against governments in Sierra Leone and Angola with
black-market diamonds sold to consumers in wealthier countries.
Human rights organizations all the way up to the United Nations are
calling for a ban on the sale of those gems, which they call
``conflict diamonds.''
</P>
<P>
   That's easier said than done, say advocates and those in the
industry. Even the world's best experts cannot eyeball a diamond
and say whether it came from South Africa, Australia, Canada _ or
the killing fields of Angola.
</P>
<P>
   Atlanta's LeeBrant Jewelers is one of the first in this area to
offer diamonds that are certified as conflict-free. But the price
for a clear conscience won't be cheap. Only LeeBrant's most
expensive diamonds are certified as coming from areas not at war.
Since June, the jeweler has carried up to a dozen _ each costing
$5,000 to $10,000.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're not the stones you see advertised in print or on
radio,'' said John Reid, a certified gemologist at LeeBrant
Jewelers in Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   In a business where a diamond passes through many hands before
it sits on yours, some, including the Gemological Institute of
America, say it's almost impossible to accurately track the stones.
Several jewelers said the best they can do is to deal with trusted
diamond cutters, who vouch that their diamonds do not come from
Africa's more brutal areas.
</P>
<P>
   The diamond business is built on trust, said Dhanesh Bhindi,
owner of Bhindi Jewelers. That's why he takes the word of his
diamond dealers in Israel and New York who say their diamonds come
from Russia and Belgium.
</P>
<P>
   Beyond that, he said, dealers cannot truly guarantee where their
diamonds came from.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's impossible,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Barbara Chambliss, assistant manager of the Shane Co. in
Marietta, Ga., said, ``It is possible, because of who we do
business with. They have to present certification to us that they
do not deal with people in that area.''
</P>
<P>
   In that process, LeeBrant's supplier, Codiam Inc., guarantees
their Rand diamonds come from South Africa, said Codiam president
Leon Cohen. The company started selling the diamonds in June.
</P>
<P>
   Each diamond is photographed and blueprinted soon after it
leaves the mine, and a minuscule identification number is
laser-inscribed by the craftsman who cuts and polishes the stone.
</P>
<P>
   Cohen says his company does not charge more for the
documentation: ``We're not putting a price on morality.''
</P>
<P>
   Now he offers his jewelers in the United States, Southeast Asia,
the Middle East, South Africa and Europe diamonds as small as a
third-carat. In a few months, he will supply his certified diamonds
from a quarter-carat up. For almost a decade, insurgents in Sierra
Leone and Angola _ funded in large part by diamonds mined from
territory they control _ have amputated the limbs of civilians,
including small children, to terrorize the population, said Alex
Yearsley, an activist for Global Witness. The London-based human
rights group was one of the first to point out the connection
between diamonds and the atrocities.
</P>
<P>
   ``It basically became the main scare tactic to put the fear of
God in people,'' Yearsley said, ``and it certainly worked.''
</P>
<P>
   For the past four years, Global Witness has called for a global
tracking system for diamonds, with a certification process that
would document each diamond from the start.
</P>
<P>
   Yearsley had not heard of Codiam's tracking system, but he said
most diamond dealers are not sophisticated enough to really track
diamonds.
</P>
<P>
   ``For a jewelry shop to put up a sign saying `conflict-free
diamonds' without offering confirmation _ I think it's a little
early for that,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   But he supports Codiam's process of assigning a tracking number
to diamonds and photographing them as they are cut, polished and
transported.
</P>
<P>
   The United Nations has imposed an embargo on diamonds coming
from mines belonging to the Angolan rebel group UNITA but not on
diamonds coming from Democratic Republic of Congo or Sierra Leone.
The U.N.'s Children's Fund ranks Angola as the worst place to be a
child.
</P>
<P>
   De Beers, the world's most famous diamond diggers, decided a
little more than a year ago not to sell conflict diamonds. The
company has estimated that about 4 percent of the world's supply of
diamonds comes from conflict areas.
</P>
<P>
   Just three years ago, when the rebels were at their peak of
power, about 15 percent of the world's supply of diamonds were sold
to fund the wars in Africa, Yearsley said.

Tchaikovsky at the Bowl 
(For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By VALERIE KUKLENSKI 
c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The hills will be alive tonight with the sounds of cannons as
the Hollywood Bowl Orchestra kicks off a three-night run of its
popular Tchaikovsky Spectacular. The San Francisco Ballet will
perform the well-known Act II of Peter Iliyich Tchaikovsky's ``Swan
Lake,'' and the orchestra will bring lush romance to the evening
with the Romeo and Juliet Fantasy-Overture.
</P>
<P>
   The USC Trojan Marching Band will help pull out the stops on the
1812 Overture, complete with roaring cannons and fireworks. It's a
rare reprise of the 1997 Tchaikovsky concert program.
</P>
<P>
   ``Three years ago when we did three performances, we sold 50,000
seats, which is phenomenal,'' said John Mauceri, principal
conductor of the Hollywood Bowl Orchestra.
</P>
<P>
   ``Under normal circumstances, I never repeat a program. This was
deemed so special and so beautiful, and since the San Francisco
Ballet was available (the company had rechoreographed the piece
just for the limited space of the Bowl), we decided to do it
again.''

<P>
   Mauceri said Tchaikovsky has proved to be the most popular
classical composer with Bowl audiences.
</P>
<P>
   ``The 1812 Overture with fireworks is one of those memories of a
Bowl performance that people carry with them,'' he said.

<P>
   Apparently, it's even memorable when the 1812 is NOT performed.

   ``Last summer, a visiting orchestra had to do Tchaikovsky
without it and there was practically a riot.''

<P>
   All right, so nobody actually flung a Williams-Sonoma picnic

FAYED PLANS TO SUE U.S. FOR DATA ON DEATHS OF DIANA AND HIS SON 
</HEADLINE>
   c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Mohamed Al Fayed, owner of Harrods department store
of London, said Wednesday that he would sue the United States
government for all information that it has on the high-speed
automobile accident that killed his son Emad Mohamed Al Fayed and
Diana, Princess of Wales, three years ago in Paris.
</P>
<P>
   The suit, which he said would be filed in U.S. District Court
here under the Freedom of Information Act, requests that several
government departments and agencies _ including the National
Security Agency, the CIA, the Justice Department, the Defense
Department and the FBI _ turn over documents, photographs and audio
tapes related to the crash.
</P>
<P>
   Previous requests for documents from the federal government were
denied in the interest of national security, said Fayed's lawyer,
Mark S. Zaid.
</P>
<P>
   Diana and Fayed's son, known as Dodi, died on Aug. 31, 1997,
after leaving the Ritz Hotel in a chauffeured car. Fayed owns the
hotel and employed the driver, Henri Paul, who also died in the
crash, and was found to have had alcohol in his system.
</P>
<P>
   Fayed contends that the NSA spied on Diana and his son, and
passed the information to MI6, the British foreign intelligence
service. Further, Fayed alleges that the Justice Department failed
to investigate and prosecute individuals who attempted to extort
$20 million from him for CIA documents describing the involvement
of MI6 in the accident.

DRUG WAR CAN SUCCEED, CLINTON TELLS COLOMBIANS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RICHARD CHACON  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   CARTAGENA, Colombia _ Trying to put a more humanitarian face on
a drug-fighting package that relies heavily on military spending,
President Clinton paid a day-long visit to this violence-torn
country Wednesday, saying Colombia can triumph over drug lords and
insurgents and attain peace.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's whirlwind, 8-hour visit to this Caribbean port city,
which included meetings with widows of slain army officers and a
private discussion with President Andres Pastrana, was meant to
promote a $1.3 billion assistance package that over the next two
years will provide military training, 60 US-made helicopters, and
funds for new justice, agricultural and human rights initiatives.
</P>
<P>
   Pushing aside criticism that the package emphasizes military
over humanitarian strategies to help solve Colombia's problems,
Clinton said the assistance would help reduce the country's drug
supply and bring an end to a 40-year civil war.
</P>
<P>
   He denied that the initiative would lead to a deeper US
involvement in Colombia's civil strife.
</P>
<P>
   ``I reject the idea that we must choose between supporting peace
and fighting drugs,'' Clinton said at a press conference with
Pastrana. ``We can do both, and indeed, to succeed, we must do
both.''
</P>
<P>
   The president's visit was largely symbolic for an aid package
that was approved by Congress earlier this summer. But Clinton's
presence in Colombia _ the first presidential visit since George
Bush's brief stop here in 1990 _ represented just how far relations
between the two countries have improved since Pastrana's
predecessor, Ernesto Samper, was denied a US visa for his alleged
ties to drug cartels.
</P>
<P>
   A former journalist who was once kidnapped by the Medellin drug
cartel, Pastrana, 46, has pinned the success of his two-year-old
administration on reducing the country's illegal drug trade and on
a broad economic and social agenda known as Plan Colombia, which is
aimed primarily at ending the warfare with both leftist guerrillas
and right-wing paramilitary groups.
</P>
<P>
   During the last decade, the civil strife has killed an estimated
35,000 people, displaced more than 1 million residents, and even
threatened to destablilize one of Latin America's longest-running
democracies. Meanwhile, drug production in the country has
skyrocketed over the past five years to roughly 550 tons annually.
</P>
<P>
   ``Many times over the past decades, Colombians have felt alone
in bearing the burden of the international drug war,'' Pastrana
said in praising the new US commitment.
</P>
<P>
   One of Clinton's first stops after arriving in Cartagena was to
the city's port, where he reviewed some of the Colombia's anti-drug
work. He then met with a group of women whose husbands were killed
in drug-related violence.
</P>
<P>
   A heavy security contingent of more than 5,000 officers _ made
up of both Colombian and US agents _ guarded this colonial city
during the president's visit.
</P>
<P>
   Colombian National Police said they arrested two Marxist rebels
who were setting up a bomb in a working-class neighborhood near a
new courthouse where Clinton was scheduled to appear, Reuters
reported. Officials said hundreds of pamphlets signed by the
leftist Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia, known as the FARC,
were also found at the site.
</P>
<P>
   The guerrillas, who have nearly 20,000 members and control large
portions of southern Colombia, have pledged that the aid package
will lead to more fighting across the country.
</P>
<P>
   Residents, for now, seem to agree. Recent public opinion polls
show that more than half of Colombians fear an escalation of
violence as a consequence of the aid package, although most also
support the Pastrana administration's peace efforts.
</P>
<P>
   Hundreds of residents lined the streets as the Clinton motorcade
wound its way around the narrow streets of this city of 2 million
people.
</P>
<P>
   Fernando Ortiz, dressed in shorts and sandals, shrugged his
shoulders when asked about his hope for peace.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think anyone can win this war,'' Ortiz, a 22-year-old
fish vendor, said. ``But we're still fighting it because no one
wants to give up. So more people are dying.''
</P>
<P>
   Jorge Rojas, director of Paz Colombia, an umbrella group of 150
Colombian community and human rights organizations, said residents
would only put faith in the Pastrana plan if it advances
negotiations between the government and guerrillas.
</P>
<P>
   ``It will be validated if and when we move from rhetoric to acts
that lead to peace,'' Rojas said.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton was accompanied by several Cabinet members, including
Secretary of State Madeline K. Albright and Attorney General Janet
Reno, and by several members of Congress, including House Speaker
Dennis Hastert, Senator Joseph Biden and Representative William
Delahunt.
</P>
<P>
   With the aid package, Colombia, which supplies 90 percent of the
cocaine sold in the United States, now becomes one of the largest
recipients of US foreign aid. The two-year assistance package will
increase by 10 times the amount of aid allocated for agricultural
and human rights programs in Colombia to more than $200 million.
</P>
<P>
   But it is the funds for 60 new US-made helicopters and for
military training, which make up the bulk of the US aid, that has
angered the plan's critics. Many observers note that Colombia's
military and police forces are severely understaffed and poorly
equipped to fight against rebels who are increasingly financed by
cocaine and heroin sales.
</P>
<P>
   However, the military's own poor record of human rights
violations, its unwillingness to prosecute high-ranking officials
and its alleged links to right-wing paramilitary groups have left
it open to criticism that more money will lead to more crimes
against civilians.

 &HT;    Reshuffling of management comeback plan for ratings slide
 &HT;    By Matt Kempner and Phil Kloer
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ CNN, fighting a ratings slide and preparing for the
merger of parent Time Warner and America Online, is creating a
comeback plan with reshuffled management.
</P>
<P>
   A reorganization unveiled Wednesday dilutes the role of Tom
Johnson, the chairman and chief executive of the CNN News Group,
and gives TV executives responsibilities for CNN Internet sites.
</P>
<P>
   It also gives executives from Turner Broadcasting System, of
which CNN is a unit, more direct say in the Atlanta-based news
operation.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson, who continues to report directly to TBS Chairman Terry
McGuirk, until now has overseen all of CNN's operations. Under the
changes, he will be responsible for the news product but loses his
president's title and cedes control of business operations. The
business responsibilities will be funneled up to Steve Heyer, TBS's
president and McGuirk's top lieutenant.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is about how to make CNN bigger and better,'' spokeswoman
Edna Johnson said. ``Johnson is going to be focused on the better.
Heyer is going to be focused on the bigger.''
</P>
<P>
   The shakeup includes the departure, as expected, of Rick Kaplan,
president of the flagship network CNN-US.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, four company insiders emerge with enhanced roles.
Phil Kent, who headed Turner Broadcasting's sales, distribution and
business alliances outside the United States, will join the CNN
News Group as president _ formerly one of Johnson's titles _ and
chief operating officer. He will report to Johnson on editorial
matters and Heyer on operations.
</P>
<P>
   Jim Walton, who oversaw both CNN's TV sports network (CNN/SI)
and sports Web site (CNNSI.com), becomes president of a new
grouping of CNN operations in the United States, including TV
networks and Internet sites. Eason Jordan, who presided over CNN
International, takes the new title of chief news executive of the
CNN News Group. One of his lieutenants, Chris Cramer, becomes
president of a new group that includes all of CNN's international
operations, including both TV and the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   ``That it was done with insiders and not an outsider is telling
of how AOL is going to work for now: Give it a chance to see how
the local boys do,'' said Ed Turner, a former CNN vice president
who built the network during its formative years.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson, who turns 59 in September and joined CNN as president
in 1990, said he is ``enthusiastic'' about the new era at CNN.
``There is no better team in which to entrust the future of CNN,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   McGuirk said he expects Johnson to remain chairman and CEO of
the news group ``for a very long time.'' Johnson was ``one of the
few non-negotiables'' when contemplating the changes, McGuirk said.
</P>
<P>
   McGuirk said he and Johnson began reviewing CNN's management
structure over the summer in preparation for the planned merger
this fall of AOL and Time Warner. AOL has said it intends to build
on Time Warner's well known brands, including CNN.
</P>
<P>
   ``We determined that organizationally we have some improvements
to make,'' McGuirk said. The plan, he said, is to increase CNN's
``ability to integrate the analog business and the digital business
in a smooth way.''
</P>
<P>
   Johnson said the reorganization should bring better intertwining
of CNN on TV and the Web. ``It is time to seize the moment because
this is the new era of the Internet and convergence.''
</P>
<P>
   Kaplan, whose power would have been reduced under the
reorganization, instead resigned.
</P>
<P>
   ``They have offered me several opportunities about how I might
contribute in the future. But I believe it is best that I now move
on,'' Kaplan said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
   He had been president of CNN's flagship network for exactly
three years, having come from ABC News. Brought in to revitalize
the CNN network and improve ratings, Kaplan managed the former, in
the minds of some staffers, but not the latter. Despite spending
heavily on new prime-time shows such as ``The World Today'' and
``NewsStand,'' CNN's ratings are down more than 35 percent this
year compared to 1999.
</P>
<P>
   Kaplan's post will be filled on an interim basis by Sid
Bedingfield, formerly executive vice president of CNN-US and
Kaplan's right-hand man.
</P>
<P>
   CNN's ratings have dropped in the past during slow news periods,
but the impact is greater now that the network faces more
competition from young cable news channels, including MSNBC, Fox
News Channel and CNBC.
</P>
<P>
   Tom Johnson attributes CNN's ratings drop to a shortage of big
news. But it has also been due to gains by competitors and younger
audiences less interested in traditional news.
</P>
<P>
   ``The real problems that they face are problems faced by all
news organizations,'' Andrew Kohut, director of the Pew Research
Center for the People and the Press, said earlier this year. Those
include, he said, a younger audience not interested in traditional
news, and increasing choices for people who care about news.
</P>
<P>
   One way CNN has sought a broader audience is by becoming one of
the first major news providers on the Internet. It is the number
two general news and information Web site in the nation, but it's
share of the market has eroded while that of the number one site,
MSNBC.com, has grown, according to Web measurement firm Media
Metrix.
</P>
<P>
   Jack Myers, chief economist for The Myers Report, a media
industry analyst, said CNN needs to study how rival MSNBC uses its
cable channel and Internet sites to reinforce one another.
</P>
<P>
   As for the management changes, Myers said, ``Kent is an
interesting move. He's very experienced in the international side,
the deal-making side. That sends a certain message in terms of
direction.''
</P>
<P>
   ``They are taking this as an opportunity to regroup,'' said Tom
Wolzien, an analyst with Sanford C. Bernstein who is a former
senior vice president of NBC. ``This is typical in the life of news
organization. When ratings have been down for a while, when things
are not working as well as they might like and a new owner is
taking over, it is time to do something differently.''
</P>
<P>
   But making big changes at CNN may not be cheap.
</P>
<P>
   Bolstering content even further is costly, said Michael Goodman,
senior analyst on media and entertainment issues for the Yankee
Group.
</P>
<P>
   One area CNN should concentrate on is producing more original
content on its Internet sites, said Michael Goodman, a media
analyst at the Yankee Group. The news group should offer different
enough fare that people rely on both mediums, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Either way, Goodman said, CNN needs top executives who
understand the business but are open to new ideas, ``because
clearly what they are doing now _ the status quo _ is not
working.''

FACTORY CLOSINGS IN CHINA PROVOKE VIOLENCE BY WORKERS

 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   TIANJIN, China _ The brick-walled Meite Packaging factory is
nearly deserted now, its managers and machines hastily transferred
in the last couple of days to a special development zone 30 miles
outside this industrial city.
</P>
<P>
   Although the closing had long been planned, the sudden departure
was prompted by an unusual event here. Last week, desperate Chinese
workers expecting layoffs seized six foreign managers from Meite's
American parent company and held them hostage in the factory for 40
hours.
</P>
<P>
   In the space of a decade, the Meite plant was transformed from a
state-owned company making pipes to a beverage packaging firm
jointly owned by the Chinese and an American corporation _ and,
just recently, to a factory wholly owned by the foreign partner,
the Ball Corp. of Broomfield, Colo.
</P>
<P>
   And so this sweltering summer, middle-aged workers who not so
many years ago were promised cradle-to-grave security by the state
factory found themselves suddenly in the middle of a capitalist
corporate restructuring and felt they had nowhere to turn.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every day since the beginning of August they were there at the
gate, protesting and trying to block deliveries and people from
going in,'' said Liu Qiuling, a retiree who lives next to the
factory and knows many who worked there. ``But the managers didn't
meet with them. I think that's why the workers were so mad.''
</P>
<P>
   Taking foreign business leaders hostage is rare in China,
despite the thousands of often fractious business partnerships
between Chinese and foreign companies. But the workers'
frustrations that touched off the disturbance were common, leading
to hundreds of protests in recent years.
</P>
<P>
   Under government orders to become economically self-sufficient,
many factories that formerly were state-owned have attempted
thorough transformations, often with the help of foreign partners
or management teams.
</P>
<P>
   The sink-or-swim strategy promoted by Prime Minister Zhu Rongji,
who oversees economic policy, has no doubt rescued thousands of
companies from bankruptcy and prepared them to compete in the
global market. It has also often enriched many former state factory
officials, who are often offered lucrative positions in the
revamped business.
</P>
<P>
   But it has been painful and confusing for China's tens of
millions of workers, echoing similar privatization efforts in the
former Soviet bloc. The workers are unfamiliar with the intricacies
of buyouts and severance packages, generally lack effective labor
unions and have little outlet for their complaints against new,
often absentee, bosses.
</P>
<P>
   ``Workers' rights are not protected much when this happens,''
said Anita Chan, a labor expert at Australian National University.
``These are people who worked for the state and thought they would
work and then retire and enjoy certain benefits: health care,
pensions, things like that.
</P>
<P>
   ``But then one day it's just finished, you see. And they are 40
and have many decades of life ahead of them. What will they live
on?''
</P>
<P>
   She said the workers at Meite, who were offered a severance
package, did better than many others who got nothing at all.
</P>
<P>
   The conversion of state factories has often left the workers at
odds with new employers, both foreign and Chinese. And protests,
though rarely reported in the Chinese media, frequently occur.
</P>
<P>
   This month, also in Tianjin, disputes erupted between workers at
a state-owned liquor company and its German partner, which wanted
to sell factory parts for scrap metal. The workers blocked a truck,
insisting that the profits from the metal were rightfully theirs.
</P>
<P>
   Late last year, workers at the formerly state-owned Red Lion
Paint Factory in Beijing ended up in a near-fatal standoff with the
management after a new private owner, a Chinese company from
Shandong Province, wanted to close the plant and sell the land.
</P>
<P>
   When a delegation of workers failed to persuade the management
to keep the factory going, some of the workers attempted suicide in
the office of the factory's Communist Party secretary, who had
sided with the new owners. One women swallowed a bottle of
pesticide, and two men slashed their wrists.
</P>
<P>
   Workers are often particularly incensed when factory bosses reap
profits from restructuring while the workers suffer.
</P>
<P>
   Opportunities for corruption abound when state property is
released into the private market, because it is often difficult to
place a value on such companies. Some former factory bosses have
managed to buy profitable ventures at bargain basement rates.
</P>
<P>
   ``What laid-off workers particularly hate to see is their
factory taken over by the factory management and converted to
private assets,'' said Dai Jianzhong, a specialist in labor issues
at the Beijing Academy of Social Sciences. ``They see factory
assets being used to buy cars and houses.''
</P>
<P>
   Often the desperate acts reflect the dire situation of
middle-aged workers who find themselves abruptly without jobs in a
country still ill-prepared to deal with unemployment.
</P>
<P>
   Until a decade ago, nearly all urban Chinese workers received
housing, health care and pensions through state jobs. Although that
is changing, China has yet to develop an effective social security
net for the unemployed or elderly. Its embryonic welfare system
offers no health care or jobless benefits for people like those
laid off from Meite.
</P>
<P>
   And the ranks of such workers are likely to grow, because the
Meite plant was the victim of what in the West would count as
business as usual.

</P>
<P>
   Through a series of joint-venture partnerships in the 1990s,
Meite's parent company, the Ball Corp., has ended up with four
packaging plants in Tianjin, mostly making soda and beer
containers.
</P>
<P>
   The plan now is to consolidate the four into one _ in the
special economic development zone, which offers tax advantages,
said Scott McCarty, a Ball spokesman.
</P>
<P>
   Ball has 17 wholly owned or joint-venture companies in China and
has been doing business in the country for more than 15 years.
</P>
<P>
   The folding of four factories into one meant layoffs, and the
company invited some workers at Meite, mostly men in their 20s, to
move with it, a worker who answered the phone at the plant said.
The decision is typical for downsizing Chinese companies, experts
say, since the younger workers tend to be better educated.
</P>
<P>
   The rest of the workers were offered a one-time severance
payment of about $1,200, which many considered inadequate.
</P>
<P>
   On Aug. 23, when executives from Ball's Hong Kong office went to
post a closing notice in the factory, workers detained them in an
office and would not let them leave, McCarty said. He said that the
six men had not been physically harmed, but that the workers were
verbally aggressive at times.
</P>
<P>
   ``Just like in the U.S., people were upset that their plant
would close _ that's understandable,'' said McCarty, noting that
``from our point of view the incident is over now and it's fine.''
Still, he said the company would probably change some of its
procedures, including those for closing factories.
</P>
<P>
   The police did not enter the factory during the ordeal, calling
it an ``internal'' matter, although they bought food for the
hostages. The police would not say Wednesday if there had been any
arrests.
</P>
<P>
   The foreigners _ an American, two Malaysians and three Hong Kong
residents _ were released after 40 hours early on Friday. McCarty
said he was unsure if any concessions had been made, although a
worker at the factory said the severance payment had been raised a
bit.
</P>
<P>
   But in a city with hundreds of thousands of laid-off and
unemployed workers, that may provide little comfort. Of 30 jobs
listed outside the district employment center near the factory,
only one was listed as open to applicants over 35.
</P>
<P>
   ``People count me as lucky,'' said Liu, the factory neighbor,
sitting on his old bicycle cart. ``I retired a long time ago, so I
have a pension. But what will these workers do if they get sick?
How will they pay for that?'' Farmers in Violent Protests

   The European financial establishment is on a buying binge, and
it's shopping almost exclusively for the made-in-America label _
even at top dollar.
</P>
<P>
   Five prominent US financial firms have agreed this summer to be
bought by European companies. Three are investment managers

United Asset Management Corp. Two are big-name Wall Street firms.
The details of the deals are different, but they have this in

   European banks and insurance companies are paying premiums of 20
percent to more than 100 percent to get a foothold in the US
market. Their aim is, in part, to diversify their revenue streams
and to gain access to the hottest stock market on the globe for
five years running. They're also trying to address Europe's
changing investment appetite, as individuals and pension funds
follow the US lead into more aggressive stock investing.
</P>
<P>
   ``They are confronting a world to come in which asset
management, whether by individuals or pension funds, is going to be
an important competitive issue,'' observed Neil Epstein, an analyst
with Putnam Lovell Securities Inc. in New York. They're attracted
to the United States, he said, ``to get hold of capabilities and
insights of a more open financial structure.''
</P>
<P>
   The question, in some instances, is whether the Europeans are
spending wisely.
</P>
<P>
   In the case of United Asset Management, London-based Old Mutual
Plc _ South Africa's biggest insurance company _ is forking over
$2.2 billion, or a 22 percent premium, for a shrinking company.
</P>
<P>
   UAM, with $188 billion under management, made its name buying up
dozens of investment boutiques in the 1980s and early 1990s. The
sellers loved the model, it was often said, because UAM let them
operate independently. But the parent has seen tens of billions of
dollars pour out the door over the past three years, in part
because its affiliates were heavily involved in traditional pension
plans, where business is dwindling, instead of the booming 401(k)
realm. In addition, insiders now say, UAM failed to reinvest
adequately in its units.
</P>
<P>
   Norton Reamer, UAM's founder, did not want to sell the company,
say people familiar with the talks. Meetings held through the
summer of 1999 with Old Mutual, with the help of advisers at
Goldman, Sachs &AMP; Co. yielded no agreements, according to UAM
filings with securities regulators.
</P>
<P>
   At a meeting in London in November, Old Mutual offered to buy a
small group of UAM's companies, with $15.5 billion under
management. The answer was still no. But the writing was on the
wall; later that month, Reamer's planned successor as CEO, Ed
Haldeman, said he would resign at year end.
</P>
<P>
   Reamer, then seeking a new chief executive, declined a
$20-a-share offer from Old Mutual in March. By April, he said he'd
take no less than $23 per share. In May, the new chief, James F.
Orr III, was aboard but the sale appeared to be falling apart, due
to numerous delays. But in a telephone negotiation, Orr secured the
sale price that stuck _ $25 a share, or $1.4 billion, the filing
says.
</P>
<P>
   He got the last couple of bucks at the eleventh hour, industry
sources say, thanks in part to an agreement a few days prior by
Boston's Nvest LP, which sold to Caisse des Depots et Consignations
Group of Paris for $2.2 billion. Shareholders got $40 per limited
partnership unit, or double the market price before the deal was
announced.
</P>
<P>
   Why the big payout for a firm that had been growing at a snail's
pace?
</P>
<P>
   ``Financial services firms, no matter where they are in the
world, need the kind of steady, noncyclical revenues of asset
management firms,'' said Ben Phillips, London-based managing
director of Cerulli Associates, a Boston research firm. As banks
consolidate across Europe, he added, ``Asset management is the one
(business) they've all been screaming after, and the US is the
biggest market.''
</P>
<P>
   The firms that are selling out say they are gaining new markets.
It's difficult for US firms to sell their services in Europe, and
to attract new customers, without a local profile. The buyers aim
both to offer the US talent to foreign investors and to put new
muscle behind US sales efforts.
</P>
<P>
   Phillips thinks the buyout of Pioneer Group, a 72-year-old
Boston mutual fund group, is even pricier than Nvest, for what
UniCredito Italiano Group is getting. Italy's number-two bank
offered $1.2 billion, or a 40 percent premium, for a $24 billion
company that failed to grow during the vast bull market of the
1990s.
</P>
<P>
   ``Pioneer is clearly above premium price,'' Phillips said.
</P>
<P>
   The sale prices are even more astonishing, observers note, given
that the dollar is very strong. The euro has tumbled 23 percent vs.
the greenback since the European currency was introduced in January
1999. That makes anything Europeans buy here more expensive, said
Paul Podolsky, currency strategist at FleetBoston Financial Corp.
</P>
<P>
   A heavy flow of European dollars leaving the continent to invest
in American companies is fueling the euro's decline, Podolsky said.
``There's a perception that the US has something special right now
that's worth paying for, at a time of rapid technical and economic
change.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, Wall Street brokerage Paine Webber Group Inc. agreed
last month to be sold for $16 billion, in the biggest foreign
takeover of a US securities firm to date. The $73.50 that
shareholders reaped from Swiss banking giant UBS represented a 47
percent premium over the prior trading price.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, blue-chip investment banker Donaldson, Lufkin &AMP;
Jenrette Inc. is being traded from French owners to the Swiss. Axa
SA, a French insurer, will fetch $13.4 billion, or a 36 percent
premium, in its sale of DLJ to Credit Suisse Group, which already
owns New York's Credit Suisse First Boston.
</P>
<P>
   The combination gives the Swiss firm a research powerhouse, a
contender in the online trading game, and a significant junk bond
operation.
</P>
<P>
   It is widely speculated that the buying frenzy is not over.
Investors are bidding up shares of the remaining independent
investment banks, including Lehman Brothers, Bear Stearns &AMP; Co.,
and J.P. Morgan. And there are dozens of asset managers that could
be targets for acquisitions, from Eaton Vance Corp. and Franklin
Templeton Investments to Invescap, parent of the AIM funds.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think this is the end of the line,'' said Epstein, the
analyst. He noted that this buying spree is merely the latest round
in a long-running trend.
</P>
<P>
   In 1997, Boston's Scudder, Stevens &AMP; Clark Inc. was acquired by
Zurich Group, Switzerland's biggest insurer, for $1.7 billion.
Zurich had previously purchased Chicago's Kemper Investments.
</P>
<P>
   In one of the rare examples of major acquisitions in the other
direction, Merrill Lynch &AMP; Co. in 1998 bought Mercury Asset
Management Group, the UK's biggest fund company, for $5.23 billion.

SPORTS COLUMN: THE SATCH IS WHERE IT'S AT
</HEADLINE>
  By GEORGE VECSEY   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The old stadium is a relic of Jennifer Capriati's
vanished youth, the way former schools and teachers seem gigantic
from a distance of time.
</P>
<P>
   ``And you know, I still see it as the real stadium sometimes,''
said Capriati, who does not seem to be the type who dwells on
apparitions.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, Louis Armstrong Stadium has gotten smaller. In the
recent renovation of the joint, they shaved off the top deck,
turning it into the absolute star of the National Tennis Center,
the place where people jam and maneuver and wheedle to get a good
seat. How New York is that?
</P>
<P>
   ``They still crowd in, and they're not quiet until, like, the
first few points are over from the changeover,'' said Capriati who,
in her relative dotage, would not have it any other way.
</P>
<P>
   The stadium named for the great jazz musician rocked and swayed
for Capriati Wednesday, with men and women of a certain age
shouting, ``Good girl, Jen,'' and other parental sentiments as
Capriati whacked Henrieta Nagyova, 6-2, 6-2. The fans knew of her
troubles, an old story by now, and they were glad to see her show
vestigial glimpses of that right-handed forehand that once made her
a contenduh, as Marlon Brando put it.
</P>
<P>
   The Satch is an equal opportunity site. The fans love everybody
because they can get close enough to express that love. Whoever
plays there benefits from the impromptu joy of fans celebrating
something going out of style _ immediacy, intimacy, visibility.
</P>
<P>
   This certainly is not the case in the dreadfully conceived
Arthur Ashe Stadium, where nobody has yet performed the
Fountainhead thing and pushed the plunger, so they could start all
over. At the Art, there are corporate boxes and luxury boxes and
then tiers of seats stretching up to the Delta Shuttle. Television
hates the sight of the empty seats _ psychologically bad for
ratings.
</P>
<P>
   ``I mean, it's unfortunate,'' said Monica Seles, who beat Anne
Kremer, 6-3, 6-4, in the Art Wednesday. ``I understand, with the
whole boxes and corporations and so on and so on.'' Well, yes, the
corporate ennui does help pay Monica's prize money. But still.
</P>
<P>
   They could fix it by letting the ushers scalp the empty seats,
but that grand old Open tradition is apparently discouraged,
creating a vacuum. Where have all the people gone? To the Satch,
more often than not.
</P>
<P>
   ``I went to the main stadium; it was ridiculous,'' said a lady
in a sundress after Marat Safin outlasted Theirry Guardiola at the
Satch.
</P>
<P>
   With Capriati warming up, fans jammed the narrow hatchways and
deftly tried to cut the lines and fill in the 8,253 open seats
directly behind the 1,436 reserved seats in the lower boxes. ``It's
a cozy stadium,'' said Paul Bruehl of Locust Valley, Long Island
``In the big stadium it's like watching it on TV. I buy the
cheapest seat in the stadium, and then I move around for the first
week.''
</P>
<P>
   It is difficult to remember how reviled the Satch was as the
main stadium. But now it has four handsome towers at the corners,
scoreboards at the north and south ends, precious little
advertising and a handsome, compact feel. And the fans flow in and
out like the tide, sometimes a riptide.
</P>
<P>
   Only one force is greater than the Satch, and that is the appeal
of the Williams Sisters, the hottest draw in the sport no matter
how much poor, fried John McEnroe blathers against women's tennis.
Wednesday, the sisters were supposed to play doubles in the Satch
in the late afternoon, but their match was rescheduled for the Art,
with its 23,219 seats.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Look out! There went thousands of pilgrims racing across the
plaza, leaving behind a modest audience for two young Yanks,
Jan-Michael Gambill and Mardy Fish. Among the stalwarts was
Kathleen Bernard, originally from Montego Bay, Jamaica, and now a
tennis pro at the Roosevelt Island Racquet Club.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've lost Guga, I've lost Rafter, and now Jan-Michael is in
trouble,'' Bernard said, mourning the losses of Gustavo Kuerten and
Patrick Rafter on Tuesday. ``I can see the Williamses anytime, but
I've got to cheer for my man Jan-Michael.''
</P>
<P>
   Bernard was fair. She watched Fish whip forehands into the
corners, and she cheered, ``Go, Mr. Fish, you're really swimming
now.''
</P>
<P>
   The Williamses dispatched their opponents, and the hard-core
fans surged back to the Satch to watch Gambill defeat Fish in the
fifth set. As darkness fell, Martina Hingis and Pete Sampras were
on deck at the Art, which does perk up at night. Meanwhile,
Capriati was due back at the Satch for doubles, along with her
partner, one Anna Kournikova. At the Satch, the hits just keep on
coming.

CHICAGO ANTI-LOITERING LAW AIMS TO DISRUPT GANGS 
</HEADLINE>
   By PAM BELLUCK   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHICAGO _ The corner of 18th and Throop Streets is the heart of
Chicago gang territory. At least three gangs battle over turf in
this Southwest Side neighborhood, and gunfire erupts at all hours.
Children walking to Manuel Perez Jr. Elementary School have been
pelted with bottles or assaulted.
</P>
<P>
   ``For many of our kids, simply getting to school can be a matter
of life and death,'' Sylvia Stamatoglou, principal of the Perez
school, said.
</P>
<P>
   So few would argue that the corner was a poor choice for the
first arrests issued under a new Chicago anti-gang ordinance this
month. The ordinance lets police officers arrest suspected gang
members or drug dealers if they disregard an order to leave a
corner or block that the police have identified as a gang ``hot
spot.'' On Aug. 18, the police say, three men who had been flashing
gang signs disobeyed an order to stay away from 18th and Throop for
at least three hours.
</P>
<P>
   While the city's new ordinance _ written after the Supreme Court
struck down a highly publicized anti-loitering ordinance that had
been a model for other cities _ has attracted early praise. It has
also drawn criticism.
</P>
<P>
   It is less broad than the old one, but civil rights advocates
still question whether innocent people will get swept off the
streets. Some aldermen are irked that the city has not told them
where the ``hot spots'' in their wards are. Some people question
whether the measure will make a real difference.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a good thing, but at the same time it doesn't solve the
root of the problem,'' said Sister Rayo Cuaya-Castillo of Holy
Trinity Croatian Church, a half-block from 18th and Throop.
Cuaya-Castillo said that after the arrests, gang members returned
to the corner, and there was shooting that night and the next.
Ultimately, she said, gangs might ``move to another neighborhood,''
but ``they will continue to do the same thing.''
</P>
<P>
   Under the old anti-loitering ordinance, ruled unconstitutional
by the Supreme Court last year, the police arrested more than
42,000 people. That measure made it a crime for anyone standing
with a suspected gang member to ``remain in any one place with no
apparent purpose'' after a police order to disperse.
</P>
<P>
   ``It matters not,'' wrote Justice John Paul Stevens in the 6-3
opinion that struck down the ordinance, ``whether the reason that a
gang member and his father, for example, might loiter near Wrigley
Field is to rob an unsuspecting fan or just to get a glimpse of
Sammy Sosa leaving the ballpark.''
</P>
<P>
   Lawrence Rosenthal, the city's deputy corporation counsel, said
that the new ordinance _ besides requiring arrests in designated
``hot spots'' _ requires a police officer to have ``a reasonable
belief that gang or drug activity is taking place.'' It also
requires ``more extensive documentation,'' he said, on arrests and
dispersal orders that do not lead to arrests.
</P>
<P>
   Rosenthal said the city knew that the ordinance would not
instantly solve the gang problem. Those arrested can be jailed only
until their fingerprints are processed, usually a day, unless they
are found with drugs or guns. While the locations of ``hot spots''
_ there are currently 86 _ are not being disclosed, as arrests are
made, gang members figure them out.
</P>
<P>
   ``But the gangs have a limited ability to adapt to this,''
Rosenthal said. ``Their own gang boundaries are limited because
they can't go on rival gang turf. And they have to be where their
buyers expect them to be. You're disrupting the drug markets,
making it harder for people to find their accustomed source of
drugs, making the gangs less profitable. And if they keep going out
there, they're going to wind up doing life in prison one day at a
time.''
</P>
<P>
   Pat Camden, a police department spokesman, said that so far
officers had issued 39 dispersal orders involving 174 people, and
that 12 people had been arrested in four incidents. The list of hot
spots is to change every three months. The hope, Camden and
Rosenthal said, is that once people see police taking action, they
will be more comfortable helping the police.
</P>
<P>
   The American Civil Liberties Union, which brought the lawsuit
against the first ordinance, said it opposed the new one and would
monitor its use.
</P>
<P>
   ``The ordinance leaves itself far too open for wrongful
enforcement,'' said Ed Yohnka, a spokesman for the ACLU. ``If young
men are made to feel suspect when they're doing nothing wrong, then
ultimately it's going to be hard to bring those people into a real
meaningful program of community policing.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, people like Stamataglou, the principal, welcomed the new
efforts. After all, she said, hers was a neighborhood where people
were too afraid to form parent patrols to escort children to
school. At least the new ordinance would make the police more
visible.

34 PERCENT OF COLLEGES POLLED BLOCK NAPSTER, SURVEY SAYS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ALEX PHAM  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   OAKLAND, Calif. _ A survey of 50 US colleges and universities
found that 34 percent of campuses block access to Napster Inc.'s
Web site on school computers.
</P>
<P>
   The survey, released Wednesday by the Gartner Group in Stamford,
Conn., found that none of the six Massachusetts schools queried,
however, prohibit Napster, the controversial software that lets
users swap music over the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   Napster, a program written by Shawn Fanning, a former
Northeastern University student, is distributed for free on the
Internet by Napster Inc., a San Mateo, Calif., company that is
currently under legal attack by the music industry for copyright
infringement.
</P>
<P>
   Babson College, Boston College, Boston University, Harvard
University, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, and Wellesley
College were among the schools that did not explicitly ban Napster.
NU was contacted by Gartner researchers, but did not reply in time
for the survey.
</P>
<P>
   Many schools have objected to the use of Napster software
because the program ties up too many computers for what is regarded
as a nonacademic use. However, many schools are also wary of the
legal consequences of allowing the use of Napster on school
computers.
</P>
<P>
   ``If the music industry wins its case against Napster, it's
possible they will go after individual users and the institutions
that give these users Internet access, including colleges and
universities,'' said P.J. McNealy, senior analyst with the Gartner
Group. ``Legal liability is the monster lurking at the end of the
hallway.''

 &HT;    Enron officials attribute success to Internet ventures
 &HT;    By Jerry Mahoney
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ Enron Corp. President and Chief Operating
Officer Jeff Skilling said he is pleased that the Houston company
is often cited as a good example of an Old Economy enterprise that
successfully joined the Internet Age.
</P>
<P>
   In the past decade, the company morphed from a natural-gas
pipeline company dependent on fixed and buried assets and limited
suppliers to the leading trader of energy in North America.
EnronOnline, a division that Skilling helped launch, handles gas
and electricity contracts with an estimated value of $1 billion a
day as it uses the Internet to buy and sell deregulated energy
wholesale. That business accounted for most of Enron's $289 million
in profit in the second quarter and has made the 47-year-old
Skilling heir apparent to Enron Chief Executive Kenneth Lay.
</P>
<P>
   But Enron officials note that the Internet didn't make Enron
successful. Enron's commodities-trading business, which was
launched nearly 10 years ago, exploited the Internet to create new
markets.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's just like turning on the after-burners,'' Skilling told
an audience of about 100 people at the Austin Convention Center.
</P>
<P>
   When deregulation made energy a commodity in 1989, Enron spent
took nine months to negotiate one transaction, Skilling said. Now,
EnronOnline handles 40 transactions a week, which take only
seconds.
</P>
<P>
   The idea that the Internet is a tool and not the solution to
e-commerce is part of the message at InteractiveTexas, a three-day
conference sponsored by Enron, Sun Microsystems, Hewlett-Packard
Co. and others.
</P>
<P>
   Skilling, who was the keynote speaker at a panel Wednesday, said
Enron derives 80 percent of its profit from businesses it has
launched in the past 10 years.
</P>
<P>
   He said start-ups that expect to exploit the Internet by
focusing only on providing services like information exchanges,
which Internet users are used to getting free, will not survive.
</P>
<P>
   ``Very few free-standing (business-to-business) sites will be a
revenue generator,'' he said.

   ALTAVISTA EXECUTIVE RESIGNS
</P>
<P>
   AltaVista said that its U.K. managing director Andy Mitchell had
resigned. The news follows the company's botched plans to provide
flat-fee Internet access service to British customers. AltaVista
trumped competitors by being first to announce that it would
provide cut-rate Internet access for a single low-cost payment, but
then failed to deliver the service. Unlike the free and fixed-rate
services in the United States, those in Britain charge by the
minute. AltaVista had planned to take advantage of new rules aimed
at loosening British Telecommunications PLC's grip on the local
phone market. ``The mistakes in our planned Internet access
service, which we do acknowledge, probably made Andy's departure
inevitable,'' said Pierre Paperon, president of AltaVista Europe.
Stephanie Himoff, who has replaced Mitchell in the role of acting
managing director, said she will focus on the company's core
business of providing Internet search engines.

   NEW CHIEF EXECUTIVE AT PHILIPS
</P>
<P>
   Royal Philips Electronics said Gerard Kleisterlee, a 25-year
veteran of the Amsterdam-based consumer electronics company, will
replace Cor Boonstra as chief executive when he steps down April
30. During Boonstra's four years at the helm, he streamlined the
company and shored-up profits by selling lagging divisions. His
successor, Kleisterlee, has held numerous positions within Philips,
including running the company's components business in Asia. The
departure of the 62-year-old Boonstra, coincides with the
resignation of Adri Baan, 57, who will step down from his post as
president and chief executive of Philips Consumer Electronics March
29. &QL;

   SWEDISH VENTURE FUND
</P>
<P>
   Three Swedish companies, Ericsson, Investor AB and AB
Industrivarden, along with Merrill Lynch, said they would form a
$300 million venture capital fund to invest in mobile Internet
start-up firms. The fund will be called Ericsson Venture Partners
and will focus on all aspects of mobile Internet technology,
including network infrastructure, services and applications. Each
partner is committing $75 million to the fund, which is expected to
be operational by October. In June Ericsson, the Stockholm-based
telecommunications company, said it would launch an incubator and
venture-capital company called INN to develop new technologies
beyond its core telecommunications-equipment business.
Industrivarden is one of Sweden's largest holding companies with a
stock portfolio worth about $8 billion. Investor, whose largest
shareholder is the Wallenberg family of Sweden, manages about $20
billion in assets.

   VOLKSWAGEN TALKS BREAK DOWN
</P>
<P>
   The latest round of wage talks between union leaders and
management at Volkswagen's plant in Puebla, Mexico, have broken
down despite the government arbitrator announcing late Tuesday
night that Volkswagen had raised its offer to 20 percent. Union
leaders representing 12,600 workers at the only plant in the world
that still produces the VW Bug and its popular successor, the New
Beetle, are holding out for a 21 percent rise. But a union
spokesman said that the two sides could reach agreement when talks
reconvene Wednesday night.

   SATELLITE SWITCHED OFF
</P>
<P>
   Solidaridad 1, a Mexican telecommunications satellite that broke
down over the weekend, was switched off after the operating
company's repeated efforts to restart the central processor failed.
The $250 million satellite, built by General Motors Corp.'s Hughes
Space &AMP; Communications Co., failed Sunday morning and prompted
Mexico's only satellite operating company, Satmex, to shift service
for more than 100 domestic and international clients to its other
three satellites and other orbiters owned by other companies.
Solidaridad 1 was operating at half its capacity on a back up
computer after the principal central processor broke down last
year.

   In a further consolidation of Canadian mutual fund managers, AGF
Management has agreed to buy Global Strategy Holdings for $438
million (Canadian), or $295 million (U.S.). Global and AGF (for
American Growth Fund) are both based in Toronto. With Global's 6
billion Canadian dollars in 22 funds, the combined company will
manage $35 billion (Canadian) dollars worth of assets ($23.6
billion U.S.) in 102 mutual funds, moving it close to front-ranked
Investors Group and the Trimark-AIM combination. Over the past five
years, several smaller Canadian fund companies have been bought by
larger competitors as sales have slowed, and managers have had to
trim costs to compete with lower fees charged by foreign
competitors.

   The head of South Korea's largest brokerage house, Hyundai
Securities, resigned, bowing to pressure from the government and
creditor banks that had accused him of hindering restructuring
efforts at its parent company, Hyundai Group, South Korea's largest
conglomerate. The executive, Lee Ik-chi, 56, has been a close aide
to the Chung family that founded Hyundai Group. Creditor banks
blamed Lee, and other executives loyal to the Chung family, of
playing a major role in leading to the financial trouble at the
conglomerate. His resignation will be accepted at a board meeting
scheduled for next Monday, Hyundai Securities said.

`THE KNOX BROTHERS': PENELOPE FITZGERALD'S FAMILY BIOGRAPHY 
</HEADLINE>
   (Editors: Publication notes appear at end of review.)  
 By RICHARD EDER   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   The birth of a writer is a mystery; occurring as it does well
past the womb and in plain sight, and all the more hidden because
of it. Few writer births can have been more mysterious than that of
the late Penelope Fitzgerald, one of the most remarkable British
novelists of the last half-century.
</P>
<P>
   She was only a couple of years shy of 60 when she began to
write, after a near-lifetime that began in a degree of privilege
and descended into a maelstrom of penury, marriage to a shiftless
alcoholic, the struggle to support her family and a series of
erratic house moves. One was to a houseboat that sank with
virtually all her possessions: most important, her photographs,
letters, notes and journals.
</P>
<P>
   It is tempting to date the writer's conception right here,
though birth would occur 10 years later. With all you have been, or
thought someday to become, sunk beneath the Thames, your only
salvager is the typewriter and the mind that waited so long to use
it.
</P>
<P>
   Fitzgerald's first two books were a thriller written to amuse
her dying husband and a life of the pre-Raphaelite painter Edward
Burne-Jones. Almost at the same time she completed a biography of
her father and his three brothers: remarkable men all, in
idiosyncratic ways.
</P>
<P>
   These books were a fluttering of wings for the aged domestic
duckling, soon to swan out in eight novels written over the next 20
years and culminating in four masterpieces: ``Innocence,'' ``The
Beginning of Spring,'' ``Gate of Angels'' and ``The Blue Flower.''
Set respectively in Italy, pre-Revolution Russia, Cambridge
University at the start of the 20th century, and 19th-century
Germany, their quirky beguilement is the float zigzagging as a
murky form lips the fish hook 10 feet down.
</P>
<P>
   Fitzgerald died last spring at 83, leaving a group of short
stories that will come out in the fall. Meanwhile a new edition of
the family biography, ``The Knox Brothers,'' has been published by
Counterpoint, partly revised by the author in collaboration with
her longtime American editor, Christopher Carduff. The original
version appeared in the United States a quarter-century ago, well
before the novels that would gradually win attention. It sold only
a few thousand copies and received little notice.
</P>
<P>
   It is well worth notice; both for itself and for the light it
casts on an author's evolution _ particularly such a late evolution
_ into what she would become. In its own right ``The Knox
Brothers'' is a lively account of two generations of a remarkable
English family straddling the divide between late Victorian and
Edwardian. Edmund Knox, Fitzgerald's grandfather, was a staunch
Church of England clergyman, a Low Church doctrinal conservative
with a social conscience that led him to resign the rural parish
where his children blissfully grew up for a gritty slum outside
Birmingham. His energy and devotion led to eventual elevation as
Bishop of Manchester. Fitzgerald portrays a man whose stern
rectitude was joined to the conviction that fun was essential and
that children should be very happy (the late in late Victorian:
think Lewis Carroll). By and large his were.
</P>
<P>
   Happiness, at least, was their inheritance; so was intellectual
ardor, combativeness and a moral energy that propelled them onto
the world at eccentric, sometimes painful angles. Edmund Knox
(nicknamed Evoe), Fitzgerald's father, was a journalist who rose to
be the editor of Punch, a post well paid and refulgent. Its
incumbent was known, part seriously, as King of Fleet Street.
</P>
<P>
   Dillwyn, known as Dilly, was a Cambridge Greek scholar co-opted
from his lifelong passion into an almost lifelong post as
cryptographer for the intelligence services, at first in the
famously cryptic Room 40 and in World War II at Bletchley Park.
There he played an important role (Fitzgerald tries but fails quite
to explain it) in cracking the Nazi's Enigma codes. The two
brothers were unbelievers, mild and truculent respectively, thus
putting them at odds with the bishop. Also with their younger
brothers, Wilfred and Ronald, Anglican clergymen both, until Ronald
converted and became a celebrated Roman Catholic priest, apologist
and translator of a Catholic Bible. That put them at odds with one
another as well; and in the case of Ronald, with their father, who
cut him out of his will.
</P>
<P>
   It was a family of perpetual intransigent argument. Yet
Fitzgerald persuasively maintains it was a matter of the bonds
beneath the odds. ``When I was very young, I took my uncles for
granted, and it never occurred to me that everyone else in the
world was not like them,'' she writes. Like platypuses bickering,
the Knoxes were more different from the world than from one
another.
</P>
<P>
   The anecdotes are wonderful. They illuminate Evoe, kind, witty
and diffident, as if success were something of a blemish; Dilly,
prickly and Eeyore-like; Wilfred, saintly and tattered; and Ronald,
a lifelong child prodigy who found the priesthood lonely and ended
happily as the cosseted chaplain to a series of great Catholic
families.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Knox Brothers'' is engaging and sometimes moving. It is
also uneven. It was Fitzgerald's family, and some passages have the
home-movie quality of a family newsletter. There are odd gaps, as
well, as if the author's closeness imposed silence. She appears
several times as a niece; never as a daughter. Her uncles' deaths
but not her father's are evoked; her father's second wife is hardly
mentioned.
</P>
<P>
   Fitzgerald was still new at writing, and biography was not her
forte (though later she would write a brief, perfect account of the
poet Charlotte Mew). Yet ``The Knox Brothers'' provides a striking
insight into the elusive nature of her genius.
</P>
<P>
   Note that of the four brothers it is Wilfred who gets the fewest
anecdotes. But he is the one who follows us out of the book and
stays. The figures in the biography offer foreshadowing hints of
some of those in her novels. (Ronald, for instance, suggests ``the
Bernhard,'' the golden little brother in ``The Blue Flower.'') Yet
they are far less real.
</P>
<P>
   Reality was a realm that Fitzgerald, after decades of silent
struggle with the all-too-real, was climbing toward. She found it
most comically, radiantly and unaccountably in her imagination.

<P>
   On Monday in a steamy union hall in Chicago, some 1,300 rowdy
Democrats roared the now-ritualistic chant ``Go, Joe, go!'' as
Mayor Richard M. Daley and the other big wheels of the Chicago
Democratic machine escorted Sen. Joseph Lieberman to the stage.
</P>
<P>
   Handing his rumpled jacket to an aide, Lieberman began a folksy
stump speech that was interrupted by applause, laughter and more
chanting. When he stepped off the stage to shake hands, people
surged forward. Men clapped him on the back. Women leaned in with
kisses and whispered words of encouragement in Hebrew.
</P>
<P>
   The next morning, 400 miles away in Kansas City, Mo., fewer than
75 people waited for Dick Cheney, the Republican nominee for vice
president, to speak at the headquarters of Fellowship of Christian
Athletes. Most of those in the audience were employees of the
organization. They sat in polite silence. There were no campaign
signs. Cheney and his wife, Lynne, entered the hall unannounced;
for a painful minute, there was no response until a few people up
front realized they ought to clap.
</P>
<P>
   A few introductory speakers talked about the importance of faith
and abstinence, and Mike Sweeney, first baseman for the Kansas City
Royals, gave Cheney a jersey. Another moment of awkward silence
followed before Cheney began a brief, low-key speech about teaching
children the importance of character. ``It's about what you do when
nobody is looking.'' Then he sat back down to brief, low-key
applause.
</P>
<P>
   With Vice President Al Gore and Gov. George W. Bush of Texas
entering a crucial phase of their race for the White House, their
running mates are waging starkly different campaigns as they strike
out on their own for the first time since each party's national
convention.
</P>
<P>
   Cheney, who has confronted questions about his health, his
voting record in Congress and his multimillion-dollar retirement
package from a major oil services corporation, has largely kept a
low profile, staging small events, sticking to a safe speech script
and generally staying clear of reporters from national news
organizations.
</P>
<P>
   Lieberman has been more active, drawing far larger crowds and
attracting _ indeed courting _ more media coverage. On Monday in
Chicago, his motorcade included two vans filled with reporters,
most from national news organizations, who are flying with him on
his campaign airplane. Cheney's campaign has no accommodations for
a traveling press corps at this time. National reporters follow his
campaign by taking commercial flights and taxicabs to his events.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, when Cheney finally took questions from the national
press corps on the last day of a three-day trip through California
and Oregon, he found only three journalists facing him. ``Why do I
need a press secretary if I've only got three?'' he said jokingly
to his press secretary, Dirk Vande Beek.
</P>
<P>
   After his event on Tuesday, Cheney paused briefly to take
questions from reporters. When one tried to ask a follow-up
question, Cheney cut her off, saying, ``You had your question.''
</P>
<P>
   After four questions, Vande Beek ended the interview. Trying for
a fifth question, a reporter asked Cheney how he planned to
celebrate his 36th wedding anniversary.
</P>
<P>
   ``That,'' Cheney said, ``is a secret.''
</P>
<P>
   He did answer one question about the differences between his
campaign style and Lieberman's.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's sort of in keeping with my quiet, low-key demeanor,''
Cheney said. ``I come from the West. A man of few words. Grew up in
the House of Representatives where we are limited to five minutes
in our speeches. Joe's from Connecticut. He comes from the Senate,
where they make a lot longer speeches.''
</P>
<P>
   But he firmly rejected what has become conventional political
wisdom among even some Republicans _ that while Lieberman is
helping Gore, Cheney is not yet doing the same for Bush, whose
standing in the polls has sagged since his selection of Cheney.
</P>
<P>
   ``People seem to respond favorably to my being on the ticket,''
Cheney said, adding, ``I don't want to take personal credit or
blame for what happens in the polls.''
</P>
<P>
   But if Cheney's taste for the low profile sometimes fails to
grab headlines or move polls, Lieberman's high-profile appearances
have risks of their own.
</P>
<P>
   Lieberman demonstrated this on Sunday in Detroit, when his
assertion that religion is the basis of morality drew a strong
rebuke from the Anti-Defamation League, atheists and groups that
advocate a strict separation of church and state.
</P>
<P>
   An earlier high-profile appearance before the black caucus of
the Democratic National Committee served to highlight Lieberman's
past differences with black leaders about affirmative action and
school vouchers.
</P>
<P>
   Cheney's restrained style, meanwhile, reinforces what many
consider to be his strongest contribution to Bush: his reputation
as a senior statesman with the depth of experience to offset Bush's
relative lack of exposure to military issues, foreign affairs and
the ways of Congress.
</P>
<P>
   Cheney's understatement has also added a quiet potency to his
criticisms of Gore and President Clinton, not to mention his calls
for a restoration of honor in the Oval Office, a line that drew
roars of approval from party stalwarts at the Republican National
Convention in Philadelphia.
</P>
<P>
   Only Wednesday, in a campaign event in Atlanta, Cheney drew on
his experience as secretary of defense in the Bush administration
to accuse Clinton and Gore of presiding over a military that is
``overused and under-resourced.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Since 1990,'' he said, ``America has pursued a strategy that
would allow us to fight two wars simultaneously, and win both
decisively, with the lowest possible risk to our troops.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yet just last fall, the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff
testified that the risk involved in two wars has increased, and
would now be `moderate' risk in the first, and `high' risk in the
second. And how would that risk be measured? Ultimately, it's
measured in the lives of our troops.''
</P>
<P>
   Lieberman has also chosen to adopt an understated tone when
laying into Bush and Cheney. He usually sets up his sharpest
criticisms by first declaring that both men are ``decent and
honorable.'' And after he delivers a zinger, he tends to soften the
blow by smiling and raising his eyebrows, as if to ask, ``Wasn't
that a good one?''
</P>
<P>
   But on the stump, Lieberman differs most from Cheney in his
eagerness to place his life story at the center of his political
message. He never fails to remind audiences that he is the son of a
bakery truck driver, that his wife's parents escaped the death
camps in Germany, and the communists in Czechoslovakia, that he was
the first person in his family to graduate from college, that he
went to Mississippi in 1963 to fight for voting rights for black
people.
</P>
<P>
   At nearly every stop he speaks of his religion, and about how
his status as the first Jew on a presidential ticket means that
``doors of opportunity'' have opened for all who have faced
discrimination.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Cheney is not nearly so effusive. After he addressed a chapter
of the Future Farmers of America at Crater High School in Medford,
Ore., a student asked him what most politicians would consider the
easiest of softballs.
</P>
<P>
   ``My question for you is, who are you?'' the boy asked. ``What
do you like to do on the weekends? What are your hobbies, and where
do you like to travel?''
</P>
<P>
   Cheney might have used the moment to tell some dramatic stories
about perhaps his greatest professional triumph, victory in the
Gulf War as President George Bush's secretary of defense.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, he gave a bare-bones recitation of his resume _ schools
attended, jobs held, place of birth, number of children and
grandchildren, the latter ``a very important part of our lives.''
</P>
<P>
   Hobbies? ``You can usually find me if I have some time off with
either a fly rod or a shotgun in my hand.'' And that was about it.
</P>
<P>
   A spokeswoman for Cheney, Juleanna Glover Weiss, said Wednesday
that Cheney would soon play a more visible role on the campaign
trail.
</P>
<P>
   Weiss said reporters would be able to fly with Cheney sometime
next week, when he expects to inherit the Boeing 727 that Bush has
been using for his campaigning.
</P>
<P>
   ``Secretary Cheney looks forward to many long and fruitful
conversations with the national reporters in the back of the
plane,'' she said. ``He's one of those guys that the more you see,
the more you like.''

ANALYSIS: COULD COLOMBIA BECOME ANOTHER EL SALVADOR OR VIETNAM FOR
U.S.? 
</HEADLINE>
  (With COLOMBIA-CLINTON) 
 By CLIFFORD KRAUSS   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   CARTAGENA, Colombia _ ``We have no military objective,''
President Clinton told the Colombian people in a passionate
television address on the eve of his one-day visit here Wednesday.
``We do not believe your conflict has a military solution. Our
approach is both pro-peace and anti-drug.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton did everything he could Wednesday to dispel the notion
that the United States is about to slip into the morass of another
jungle war like El Salvador, or worse yet, Vietnam. Colombian
officials invited him to visit a naval base involved in drug
interdiction, but instead he chose to visit a neighborhood justice
center, to show the humane side of U.S. aid.
</P>
<P>
   But it is one thing to engage in photo-ops during an eight-hour
trip to Cartagena, a Caribbean tourist center far from any
fighting; it is quite another to help the Colombian government to
retake control of the half of its territory that has been lost to
Marxist guerrillas who are in league with coca growers and drug
traffickers.
</P>
<P>
   Drugs are so lucrative that they cannot be easily separated from
a tangle of treacherous risks that will face any growing U.S.
involvement in Colombia.
</P>
<P>
   The production and trafficking of cocaine and heroin touch and
corrupt the country's judicial system, politics and economics, and
they fuel not only a growing guerrilla movement but also a brutal
paramilitary movement loosely linked to local military units.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's trip here is effectively a colorful handoff of a check
for $1.3 billion in mostly military aid recently approved by
Congress. An anti-drug brigade will soon begin backing police
efforts to eradicate coca fields in two southern provinces largely
controlled by Colombia's most powerful guerrilla group. The 60
helicopters included in the package are to be used only for
anti-drug efforts, unless military units fighting drugs are
attacked by the guerrillas.
</P>
<P>
   This plan, according to U.S. officials, is nothing more than a
fight against drugs that are subverting Colombia's democracy and
poisoning Americans. In all likelihood, no U.S. troops will be
engaged in the fighting because there is no desire for that in
Congress and because the Pentagon has shown no enthusiasm for a
deepening involvement, in contrast to the early days of the Vietnam
War.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, the program is a sharp break from past policy.
Washington treated the last president of Colombia as a pariah _
refusing even to grant him a visa _ when it was discovered that his
campaign accepted a $6 million contribution from the Cali drug
cartel. Washington for years snubbed the armed forces, and funneled
most aid to the national police, after military commanders
protected leaders of the Medellin drug cartel in the 1980s.
</P>
<P>
   The change in policy requires some nose-holding, even though
President Andres Pastrana is considered a well-intentioned
reformer.
</P>
<P>
   Before a single helicopter has arrived, Clinton had to waive
human rights amendments Congress added to the aid program on
national security grounds. The decision was an acknowledgement that
the United States must put up with rights offenses that might
otherwise be considered intolerable. Any other decision would have
undermined the new program before it even got started, and human
rights concerns are not likely to derail what promises to be a
long-term involvement.
</P>
<P>
   It was much the same when President Ronald Reagan repeatedly
overlooked the human rights violations of El Salvador's military
and Nicaragua's Contras to keep his Central America program going.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   The guerrillas here are not nearly as formidable as were the
Viet Cong or even the Farabundo Marti National Liberation Front of
El Salvador. With the Cold War over, communism is no longer a
threat, U.S. officials admit, and the guerrillas who have fought
here for the last 40 years no longer can count on the help of
Moscow or Havana. And according to opinion polls, they have the
support of less than 5 percent of the people.
</P>
<P>
   The most important support the Colombian guerrillas have going
for them, say most analysts, is a ready gold mine of drug
protection money estimated at several hundred million dollars a
year. That is enough to keep them well-equipped, well-fed and
unenthusiastic about making peace.
</P>
<P>
   Critics of the aid program say it is designed in Washington to
meet U.S. domestic political concerns and has no relevance to the
reality in Colombia.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is no way to sustain the distinction between drug
traffickers and guerrillas in southern Colombia,'' said Bruce
Bagley, a professor of international studies at the University of
Miami. ``U.S. policy will break down the first day.''
</P>
<P>
   Colombian officials disagree, saying the plan will ultimately
destroy the guerrillas' capacity to make war.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not a matter of Marxist philosophy anymore,'' said
General Fernando Tapias, commander of the armed forces, in a recent
interview. ``The guerrillas are now in the fight for the money. .
``The plan for peace will not work without a decisive fight against
drugs.''
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, Colombia's armed forces remain small,
under-equipped, under-trained, deficient in intelligence-gathering
capabilities and lacking in mobility even with the new helicopters.
It took a decade to rebuild the Salvadoran army, and the U.S.
effort to do the same in Colombia is not a short-term project
either, as U.S. officials concede.
</P>
<P>
   Those deficiencies make a long war likely.
</P>
<P>
   What does Washington do if the guerrillas shoot at the
helicopters, or worse yet at the U.S. military trainers working
with the new anti-drug brigade? What if the guerrillas and the coca
growers and drug traffickers simply move from the two southern
provinces and spread the war to other Colombian provinces or even
neighboring countries like Peru and Brazil?
</P>
<P>
   Either President Al Gore or President George W. Bush may well
have to face those contingencies, and the options they will have to
choose from will not be easy.

COMMENTARY: CHILDREN'S CHAMPIONS? 
</HEADLINE>
   By BOB HERBERT    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   George W. Bush and the Republicans have spent much of the
presidential campaign promising to look out for the nation's
children. They have gone so far as to hijack the phrase ``leave no
child behind'' from the very liberal Children's Defense Fund.
</P>
<P>
   Trust me, it was odd watching Dick Cheney, who as a congressman
voted against funding for Head Start, against subsidizing school
lunches for poor children and against federal aid for college
students, delivering the following lines to the very conservative
delegates at the Republican convention in Philadelphia:
</P>
<P>
   ``When George W. Bush is president and I am vice president,
tests will be taken, results will be measured, schools will answer
to parents, and no child will be left behind.''
</P>
<P>
   It is understandable that some voters might be skeptical. For
years the GOP has fended off new programs designed to help
children, while fighting hard to slash support for those that
already exist. It was Ronald Reagan's administration, during a
celebrated assault on school lunches, that tried to have ketchup
declared a vegetable.
</P>
<P>
   Now, with George W. Bush campaigning as a champion for children,
we learn that the state of Texas has not bothered to comply with a
1996 consent decree requiring it to provide appropriate health care
services to more than 1.5 million children who are eligible for
Medicaid.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. District Judge William Wayne Justice ruled, among other
things, that the state had failed to inform indigent families about
the availability of health services, that managed-care plans to
which some indigent Texans had been assigned were not providing the
required services, and that approximately one million eligible
individuals had received no dental care.
</P>
<P>
   ``Basically, what we have is a Medicaid program in shambles,''
said Susan Zinn, a San Antonio lawyer who filed the class-action
lawsuit that led to the consent decree.
</P>
<P>
   This is not just about health care. Dr. Irwin Redlener, a
prominent New York pediatrician who has worked with children in all
parts of the country, including Texas, has been looking for some
time at the connection between children's health care and
educational achievement.
</P>
<P>
   He believes it is impossible to meet the education needs of
children without meeting their health care needs.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's abundantly clear to both pediatricians and
educators that health and the education potential of children are
inexorably linked,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Redlener is a supporter of the Gore-Lieberman ticket and has
been an adviser to Vice President Gore on health matters. So he is
hardly nonpartisan. But his attempt to draw more attention to the
link between health care and education is an important one. He
talked to me more than a year ago about chronic medical conditions,
like asthma and ear infections, that interfere with a child's
ability to function in school.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every pediatrician knows that under-treated or undiagnosed
asthma is a disaster for school-age children,'' Redlener said
Wednesday. He noted that the wheezing and other forms of
respiratory distress can be so intense as to make it almost
impossible to concentrate on schoolwork.
</P>
<P>
   ``And yet,'' he said, ``these symptoms are entirely controllable
when there is access to a competent source of ongoing health
care.''
</P>
<P>
   Ear infections are also common in young children. When they
remain undiagnosed and untreated they can lead to hearing loss,
inhibited language development and poor school performance. There
are many other similar problems.
</P>
<P>
   Bush and Cheney may be sincere when they say they want to leave
no child behind. But they come late to this issue. Cheney's
congressional voting record on legislation to help children was
hideous. And Bush's Texas has an abysmal record on children's
health issues.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, Bush and Cheney may have considerable trouble dragging
other elements in their party _ the Trent Lotts, the Tom DeLays,
the Dick Armeys _ anywhere near a progressive program for children.
</P>
<P>
   The Children's Defense Fund has been a terrific group for many
years. Bush and Cheney and the Republicans have stolen its motto.
Now might be a good time to borrow its commitment.

COMMENTARY: VOUCHERS HELP BLACKS 
</HEADLINE>
   By WILLIAM SAFIRE    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ School vouchers make a big difference for black
students.
</P>
<P>
   That is the conclusion of a two-year study in three cities _ New
York, Washington and Dayton, Ohio _ conducted by a team from
Harvard, the University of Wisconsin and the Brookings Institution.
These are not hotbeds of right-wing ideology.
</P>
<P>
   The improved test performance of African-American students who
were able to take advantage of vouchers suggests a stunning
reversal of their fortunes. If the trend line continues, the report
says, ``the black-white test gap could be eliminated in subsequent
years of education for black students who use a voucher to switch
from public to private school.''
</P>
<P>
   Thus do vouchers change lives. In this randomized field trial _
a rigorous technique used in medical research, rarely in education
surveys _ a fair comparison could be made with a reduction of class
size among black students in Tennessee. ``The effects of vouchers
after two years,'' the report observes, ``are over twice as
large.''
</P>
<P>
   This hard evidence is not what teacher unionists want to hear.
``It's the first controlled experiment in the school-choice area,''
says Chester Finn, the Moynihan disciple who heads one of the dozen
foundations that commissioned it. ``This gives us the
highest-quality study we've ever had, and the result in three areas
is unequivocal: School vouchers dramatically raise test scores for
blacks.''
</P>
<P>
   We can expect some academics to disparage the private funders
and thereby to suggest that the eminent academic researchers sold
out. But other educators, even those concerned about directing
public funds to the 10 percent of schools that are private, will
pay attention to evidence that conflicts with their assumptions.
</P>
<P>
   Why is it that only blacks, and no other racial or socioeconomic
group, improved their scores using vouchers? I put that question to
the lead investigator, Paul Peterson, who is director of Harvard's
Program on Education Policy and Governance.
</P>
<P>
   ``That puzzled us, too,'' said Peterson. ``African-American
parents in New York City pointed to less fighting and race conflict
in the private schools, the expectation of more homework, and
better communication between parent and teacher. Public schools
that serve mainly black students are more different from private
schools,'' he concluded, ``than are the public schools that serve
mainly white or Hispanic-American students.''
</P>
<P>
   I take that to mean that the teaching, facilities and atmosphere
in schools where blacks predominate is often so bad that the
students given the chance to escape that environment ultimately
show the most improvement. That kicks in the head theories of
racial inferiority and offers hope to kids now in poor schools.
</P>
<P>
   So what's to be done about encouraging private competition to
the near-monopoly now held by government? How do we give parents in
urban ghettos a choice?
</P>
<P>
   Al Gore told cheering teacher-delegates, ``I will never support
private school vouchers, which would drain public money away from
public education.'' Litmus-testily, he indicated that his Supreme
Court choices would vote against vouchers' constitutionality, which
the present court has declined to do.
</P>
<P>
   George W. Bush holds an opposing view. He wants local
communities to set standards and hold schools accountable for
meeting them. If after three years the schools fail, then the
federal contribution should go to parents to spend at competing
private schools. He pointedly agrees with Joe Lieberman's
pre-convention support of vouchers. And to counter Gore's warning
about ``draining,'' Bush vows to increase federal spending on
schools.
</P>
<P>
   Here is an issue with battle lines drawn _ but where's the
battle? The front lines are in California and Michigan, where
voucher propositions are on the ballot, but when I tried to get a
straight answer on the hot votes, both camps befogged me with ``he
generally does not take positions on state ballot matters.''
</P>
<P>
   The Harvard study shows Bush is on the right side of this. He
should embrace the successful voucher students and joyfully join
the controversy in states where children's futures are now at
stake.

FOR U.S. OPEN TENNIS, A SERVICE LINE UMPIRE THAT NEVER BLINKS

<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Tennis fans who dislike the temper tantrums thrown by
some top players over line umpires' calls can thank Bill Carlton
that there aren't more of them.
</P>
<P>
   Carlton, an inventor from Malta, developed a system called the
Cyclops by Carlton, a service line monitor that uses infrared beams
to determine whether a serve is in or out.
</P>
<P>
   The Cyclops, which was developed about two decades ago and has
been refined continually since then, is now used in many major
tournaments, including Wimbledon and the U.S. Open, which is taking
place this week and next at the National Tennis Center in Flushing
Meadows-Corona Park. Line umpires say the system helps relieve some
of the pressure when calling serves.
</P>
<P>
   ``As an umpire, I loved it,'' said Jay Snyder, tournament
director at the U.S. Tennis Association. ``Probably the most
argued-over call in tennis is the serve because it's so
split-second. But the players don't argue with the Cyclops. They've
come to accept it.''
</P>
<P>
   Although there are no published accuracy statistics, Snyder said
that Cyclops' calls were accurate more than 99 percent of the time,
barring extreme temperature changes that can affect the court
surface.
</P>
<P>
   Other umpires appreciate the system's objectivity in situations
where they could be accused of favoritism.
</P>
<P>
   ``The machine doesn't care whether you're from Spain or from Los
Angeles,'' said Brian Early, a referee with the U.S. Tennis
Association. ``It just calls the balls the way it is, and that's
fine.''
</P>
<P>
   Before the U.S. Open gets under way each year at the National
Tennis Center, Bill Carlton's daughter, Sarah Gauci Carlton,
arrives from Malta to set up Cyclops systems on center court and on
three others where marquee matches are played. Carlton stays
through the tournament to maintain the systems and make
adjustments.
</P>
<P>
   The tennis association, which started using Cyclops for the Open
in 1981, rents the systems from the Carltons. Cyclops is also used
at Wimbledon and the Australian Open.
</P>
<P>
   The Cyclops system consists of two boxes bolted to the court
surface on the sidelines, in line with the back of the service box.
One of the Cyclops boxes transmits five infrared beams across the
court to the other box, which is the receiver and is connected to a
smaller control box held by the service line umpire. There is an
identical setup on the other side of the net.
</P>
<P>
   The boxes are positioned so one infrared beam runs along the
good side of the service box line, and the other four run on the
fault side, up to 18 inches from the line. When a ball hits on the
line (or just inside the line) it momentarily breaks the first beam
and turns off the others. If the serve is long, it breaks one of
the four other beams.
</P>
<P>
   The control box signals with a green light when the serve breaks
the first beam. It it breaks any of the others without breaking the
first beam, it signals with a red light and a loud beep. A serve
well beyond or in front of the beams is considered easy enough for
the umpire to judge by eye.
</P>
<P>
   The Cyclops can be used only at the service line because, unlike
the baselines or sidelines, there are no feet or rackets present to
break the infrared beams. The system must be inactivated (the
umpire pushes a button on the control box) immediately after a good
serve so the ball, racket or feet do not trip the beams again,
triggering more beeps.
</P>
<P>
   Another system, called Tennis Electronic Lines, was installed to
monitor baseline activity at the U.S. Open in the early 1990s,
Snyder said, but it was unsuccessful. The system used metal sensors
under the court lines and a tennis ball with metallic fibers to
determine the ball's location. The system was expensive, and it was
frequently set off by players who had metal eyelets in their tennis
shoes or metallic fibers in their rackets.
</P>
<P>
   Over the years, the Cyclops system has been redesigned to be
less sensitive to insects attracted by the lights that are used for
night games, Snyder said. And the whistle that was initially used
to indicate a fault has been replaced by a lower-pitched beep,
partly because it can be heard better in large stadiums and partly
because some spectators would occasionally mimic the whistle sound
when they thought that a ball was out.
</P>
<P>
   As precise as it is, the Cyclops system is used to complement,
not replace, people. The line umpire has the final call and can
shut down the system if there are questions about its accuracy.
That rarely happens.
</P>
<P>
   At the end of each match of the Open, Carlton speaks to the
service-line umpire about how well the system worked. ``There are a
few linesmen who are more particular than others, but very few who
don't like it,'' she said.

 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   For the first time, computer scientists have created a robot
that designs and builds other robots, almost entirely without human
help or expertise.
</P>
<P>
   In the short run, this advance could lead to a new industry of
inexpensive robots customized for specific tasks. In the long run _
decades at least _ robots may one day be truly regarded as
``artificial life,'' able to reproduce and evolve, building
improved versions of themselves.
</P>
<P>
   Such durable, adaptive robots, astronomers have suggested, could
someday be sent into space to explore the galaxy or search for
other life.
</P>
<P>
   But the quest to create artificial life also revives concerns
that computer scientists could eventually create a robotic species
that would supplant biological life, including humans.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some things we probably can do we shouldn't do,'' said Bill
Joy, chief scientist at Sun Microsystems, who wrote a recent
article warning of the power of emerging technologies. ``Just like
we can kill things with DDT, but we shouldn't.''
</P>
<P>
   For now, the robotic manufacturing system _ a computer hooked up
to a machine that builds plastic models _ in the laboratory of
Jordan B. Pollack and Hod Lipson at Brandeis University in Waltham,
Mass., cannot create anything nearly as complicated as itself.
Instead, it produces eight-inch-long contraptions of plastic bars
and ball joints.
</P>
<P>
   When a motor and microchip are added, the automatons have one,
and only one, ability: to crawl slowly. The fastest can scuttle
along at a few inches a second.
</P>
<P>
   ``They look like toys,'' said Pollack, a professor of computer
science. But, he added, ``They were not engineered by humans and
they were not manufactured by humans.''
</P>
<P>
   Pollack and Lipson, a research scientist, are reporting their
results Thursday in the journal Nature. ``This is the first example
of pretty much 100 percent automated evolution of a machine,'' said
Philip Husbands, a professor of artificial intelligence at the
University of Sussex in England. ``It's a rather primitive example,
but it's the first step to something that could be quite
significant.''
</P>
<P>
   In the future, the technique could be used to design robots that
assemble parts in factories, clean up chemical spills or vacuum a
home.
</P>
<P>
   Because computers cost much less than human engineers, ``It
opens for the first time a more economical approach to robotics,''
Pollack said. ``We can now essentially design for free and build
for a few thousand dollars.''
</P>
<P>
   The cost of designing a robot today typically runs from hundreds
of thousands of dollars to millions of dollars, Pollack said.
</P>
<P>
   The computer in the Brandeis system had no idea what a
successful design might look like. Instead, it was merely given a
list of possible parts it could work with, the physical laws of
gravity and friction, the goal of moving on a horizontal surface
and a group of 200 randomly constructed nonworking designs.
</P>
<P>
   Mimicking biological evolution, the computer added, subtracted
and changed pieces in the designs. At the same time, the computer
similarly mutated the programming instructions for controlling the
robot's movements. After each step, the computer ran simulations to
test the designs, keeping the ones that moved well and discarding
the failures.
</P>
<P>
   After 300 to 600 generations of evolution and fine-tuning, the
computer dispatched the design to a rapid prototyping machine, used
by manufacturers to build test models of product designs, to build
the robot. Then, in the step that required human help, the
researchers installed the robot's motor and microchip and
downloaded the robot's programming instructions.
</P>
<P>
   Changing the initial configuration of the robot parts produced a
different design and a different approach to locomotion. One pushes
itself along. ``It's kind of like an accordion,'' Pollack said.
</P>
<P>
   Another one ``walks something like a crab,'' Lipson said. ``It
looks like it's crawling on the floor. It's quite surprising the
diversity of solutions we get.''
</P>
<P>
   In earlier work, other researchers used similar
evolution-inspired algorithms to evolve imaginary creatures that
existed only in virtual computer worlds or to design the
programming instructions.
</P>
<P>
   The robots' evolution is now a dead-end, as the designing
computer never learns how well its designs work in the real world.
The simple robots also have no ability to improve their
performance. According to the researchers, the robots now have the
brainpower of bacteria. ``We hope to get up to insect level within
a couple of years,'' Pollack said. ``There's no danger of Commander
Data walking out of our fabricator anytime soon,'' he said,
referring to the android character in ``Star Trek.''
</P>
<P>
   In future research, the Brandeis researchers intend to add
sensors to the robots and improve the design programs. Future
robots may also be able to exchange information among one another
and learn from one another's experiences.
</P>
<P>
   As computer chips speed up and fabrication machines become more
sophisticated, the robotic designers will produce robots that are
more and more complex. Some have wondered what will happen when a
robot can design and build something as complex as itself.
</P>
<P>
   For example, Seth Shostak, an astronomer at the SETI Institute
in Mountain View, Calif., has suggested that researchers listening
for radio signals from alien civilizations are more likely to first
come across intelligent machines created by aliens.
</P>
<P>
   In an article in the April issue of Wired, Joy of Sun
Microsystems argued that scientists should perhaps deliberately
steer themselves away from research that would create
self-replicating, evolving, autonomous robots. With forethought, he
said, computer scientists should be able to tap into most of the
benefits of the emerging technology while avoiding the dangers.
</P>
<P>
   ``This doesn't have enough of the pieces to be by itself
dangerous,'' Joy said about the Brandeis work. But, he added,
``We're on the road to somewhere where there's big issues down the
road.''
</P>
<P>
   Others working in the field are not as worried, even if
technological advances make such devices possible. Ralph C. Merkle
of the nanotechnology firm Zyvex and an adviser to the Foresight
Institute, said that high costs would probably prevent the design
of dangerous robots. Rather, robots would continue to be designed
for specific tasks with little or no ability to evolve and adapt.
</P>
<P>
   ``It looks like having a device to work at all is hard,'' Merkle
said. ``There is no desire to add additional complexity. Those
systems do not look like they would be dangerous.''
</P>
<P>
   The Brandeis researchers find the speculation premature.
``Really, it's so far removed from anything dangerous,'' Lipson
said about their work. ``There are many other things to worry about
before this.''

LABOR BOARD MAKES UNION MEMBERSHIP EASIER FOR TEMPS 
</HEADLINE>
   By STEVEN GREENHOUSE   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ For years it was nearly impossible for temporary
workers to join unions, but the National Labor Relations Board
issued a ruling on Wednesday that opened the door for many temps to
join unions at their workplaces.
</P>
<P>
   The Washington-based labor board, in a 3-1 decision that took
effect immediately, authorized temporary workers at a business to
join the same union as the company's permanent workers without
first obtaining permission from the employment agency that assigned
the temps to the business.
</P>
<P>
   In its previous rulings, the board stated that temporary workers
sent by an employment agency to a company could vote to join a
union at the company only if the employment agency agreed.
Temporary help agencies rarely gave the workers they sent to a
company the go-ahead to join a union at the company.
</P>
<P>
   Officials with the AFL-CIO hailed the ruling, saying it would
help improve wages, benefits and working conditions for many of the
1.2 million people employed by temporary agencies _ one of the
fastest growing segments of the work force.
</P>
<P>
   But many business groups criticized the ruling, insisting that
it would raise production costs for many employers and might force
companies to pay their temporary workers more than they had agreed
to in their contract with temporary staffing agencies.
</P>
<P>
   The labor board ruled that in many cases temporary workers are
in effect the employees of the user company and not of the agency
and that, because of their similar circumstances, they should be
treated as part of the same bargaining unit as the user company's
permanent employees.
</P>
<P>
   The labor board wrote, ``A growing number of employees who are
part of what is commonly described as the `contingent work force'
are being effectively denied representational rights guaranteed
them under the National Labor Relations Act.''
</P>
<P>
   Under the decision, labor unions might simply petition the labor
board to rule that several dozen temporary employees at a unionized
work site should be added to the union bargaining unit, even
without a vote by the temporary workers.
</P>
<P>
   At a time when the union movement is straining to add workers,
the decision was important for labor because the number of people
working for temporary help agencies soared more than sixfold from
1982 to 1998, while jobs over all grew by 41 percent.
</P>
<P>
   John Sweeney, the AFL-CIO's president, said the ruling ``is an
important step in addressing the rights of contingent work force
employees, who have too often been relegated to second-class status
and rights, if any.''
</P>
<P>
   Charles Craver, a labor relations expert at George Washington
University, said, ``For unionized firms that have been bringing in
temporary workers to save money, that benefit may be lost because
all of a sudden those temp workers may have to be in the same
bargaining unit as the permanent workers. As a result, there will
be less incentive to use outside workers.''
</P>
<P>
   David Miller, a lawyer for one of the companies that lost the
case, the Jeffboat Division of the American Commercial Marine
Service Co., said, ``This could be a devastating decision. It means
that these employees could be covered by the wages and benefits in
a union contract when neither the user company or the temp agency
had considered that.''

IGNORING EACH OTHER, BUSH AND GORE SHARPEN FOCUS ON THEIR KEY
ISSUES 
</HEADLINE>
   By KEVIN SACK with JAMES DAO   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   PORTLAND, Ore. _ Sticking to message like epoxy, Vice President
Al Gore and Gov. George W. Bush continued their efforts Wednesday
to set the terms of engagement in their presidential contest, with
Gore promoting his plans to fortify Medicare and Bush pledging to
increase federal aid to college students.
</P>
<P>
   Both men studiously avoided responding to the other's swipes as
the campaign settled into a day-by-day battle for control of the
policy agenda. The Gore campaign believes it prospers if the debate
centers on health care, while the Bush campaign, both in its
advertising and the focus of its candidate, sees education as the
key to stealing women's votes from the Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   But wary of appearing defensive, the candidates have been
careful not to engage the opposition. Last week, the Bush campaign
was thrown somewhat off balance by Gore's attacks on his proposed
income tax cut and Bush's own admission that he had to do a better
job of explaining his plan.
</P>
<P>
   Neither candidate wants to fall into that trap this week. Gore
spent the day arguing that Bush's proposed income tax cut would not
leave enough of the federal surplus to protect Medicare, a charge
that Bush ignored. Bush, meanwhile, accused Gore and President
Clinton of overseeing ``seven years of stagnancy'' in education,
and Gore likewise acted as if he had not heard the charge.
</P>
<P>
   Gore, the Democratic nominee, rejoined his running mate, Sen.
Joseph Lieberman of Connecticut, Wednesday at a forum on Medicare
at Portland State University here. As has been the case throughout
a week devoted to health policy, the minutiae of Gore's remarks
concerned insurance coverage, but his underlying purpose was to
demonstrate his deep philosophical differences with Bush over how
to spend the federal surplus.
</P>
<P>
   ``The other side has placed its top priority on taking virtually
all of this projected surplus and giving it all in the form of a
giant tax cut, mainly to the wealthy,'' Gore said. ``And their
theory is that's going to be good for the country, and they say
it's your money. Well, it is your money. But it's your Medicare,
it's your Social Security, it's your environment, it's your school
system, it's your country.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore renewed his call Wednesday for spending $339 billion over
10 years to add a prescription drug benefit to the Medicare program
and to restore Medicare financing to teaching hospitals, nursing
homes, rural hospitals, home health care aides, and rehabilitative
services. Money for those programs was cut under the 1997 balanced
budget act, and Gore said Wednesday that those reductions ``went
too far.''
</P>
<P>
   He also said he would extend the solvency of Medicare by putting
the $400 billion Medicare surplus that is expected in the next
decade in a so-called lock box to protect it from spending raids by
Congress. Under Gore's plan, that money would be used to reduce the
federal debt, saving $75 billion in interest payments that would
then be used to extend the solvency of Medicare from 2025 to 2030.
</P>
<P>
   Gore also rejected the majority conclusions reached last year by
a bipartisan commission on Medicare, saying he would not support
raising the Medicare eligibility age to 67 from 65, forcing the
elderly into managed care, or raising premiums and co-payments.
</P>
<P>
   One of those who has supported such measures in the past is
Lieberman, who sided with Republicans in a series of
balanced-budget votes in 1997 to raise the eligibility age and to
impose increases in premiums and fees for some Medicare recipients.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is important to put these votes in context,'' said Dan
Gerstein, Lieberman's Senate press secretary. ``At the time
projections were that the system would be bankrupt in four or five
years. Senator Lieberman and a lot of other people saw it as
necessary to salvage the program.''
</P>
<P>
   Gerstein noted Lieberman voted last year against the
recommendations of the bipartisan commission to further restrict
eligibility and allow some additional charges for recipients. ``His
recent record shows he's very much in sync with the vice
president,'' he said.
</P>

   Bush plans to spell out the details of his Medicare reform
proposals in a major address in Allentown, Pa., on Tuesday. His
aides have said he will base his plan on bipartisan Senate
legislation that would give Medicare recipients the ability to
choose between a variety of public and private insurance plans.
They have said that such a restructuring of Medicare, by promoting
competition, would produce savings to keep the program solvent for
the long term.
</P>
<P>
   Gore's plan, Bartlett said, would amount to tinkering when
compared to Bush's yet-to-be-announced approach. ``You're extending
the day of reckoning by five years?'' he asked. ``That's not
leadership. That's passing the buck.''
</P>
<P>
   In Erie, Pa., Wednesday, Bush proposed expanding the federal
Pell grant program to help more low-income students attend college,
warning that the achievement gap separating rich and poor, black
and white students is ``wide and growing wider.''
</P>
<P>
   In a speech before local Republicans, a subdued Bush focused
heavily on education for the third day this week, emphasizing local
control and school accountability, while attacking Gore for
upholding what he called a failed status quo.
</P>
<P>
   ``Today, incredibly enough in our country, 7 out of 10 fourth
graders in our highest poverty schools cannot read,'' Bush said.
``They are children who are destined to be locked into failed hopes
and diminished dreams. The achievement gap between minority and
non-minority students is wide and growing wider. And we must do
something about it in America early, before it's too late.''
</P>
<P>
   This year, the federal government is expected to award nearly $8
billion in Pell grants to 3.8 million students, more than half of
whom come from families making less than $15,000 a year.
</P>
<P>
   Arguing that freshman year is often the most difficult for
college students, Bush proposed increasing the maximum first-year
Pell grant to $5,100 per student, from $3,300. The proposal would
cost $5 billion over 5 years, his aides said. Under the Clinton
administration, spending on Pell grants has increased by $1.5
billion, to $7.9 billion.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Bush on Wednesday also called for building a $1.5 billion
federal fund over the next 5 years to help states create or expand
merit scholarship programs. And he proposed abolishing federal
taxes on so-called pre-paid college tuition plans that allow
parents to create special escrow accounts to finance future tuition
costs. This program would cost $275 million over five years, his
aides said.
</P>
<P>
   Bush began the day with an education event in Portsmouth, N.H.,
and ended it with three fund-raisers in Cincinnati that were
expected to raise more than $3.3 million for national and state
Republican committees. The events were arranged by two former
partners of Bush's in the Texas Rangers major league baseball team.
</P>
<P>
   With the campaign having taken a more testy turn in recent days,
Bush sought to capture the high ground Wednesday by repeatedly
calling for greater civility. Without mentioning Gore by name, he
suggested the vice president had poisoned the presidential debate
with negative, overly partisan campaigning.
</P>
<P>
   ``We should have political discourse and disagreement and
debate,'' Bush said in Portsmouth. ``But we can do so in a spirit
of civility, we can do so without calling names. Or belittling
people. We can do so without wagging our fingers and claiming
someone is bad just because they disagree with us.''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Lieberman said he expected to talk less about
religion than he has this week, after he came under criticism for
saying that faith should play a greater role in public life. ``I
don't expect this to be a major theme of the campaign,'' Leiberman
said in a interview in Portland where he appeared with Gore.
</P>
<P>
   He said the emphasis on religion had resulted from the novelty
of his selection as the first Jewish nominee for national office,
and from the timing quirk of his appearing Sunday in a church in
Detroit and Monday at a meeting of religious leaders in Chicago,
events that he said naturally led to talk of faith.

   KHAYELITSHA, South Africa _ The white politicians ventured into
this dusty black township, determined to connect.
</P>
<P>
   Helen Zille practiced the clicking sounds of the local Xhosa
language, her tongue dancing as the words tumbled from her lips.
Dene Smuts hailed the black crowds as ``sisters and brothers,''
salting her English with the familiar flavor of African-style
oratory.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're reaching out,'' said Phillip Grobler, a spokesman for
the opposition party, the Democratic Alliance, as his caravan of
politicians rolled through these shantytowns near Cape Town to a
rally in early August. ``The race question always comes back, but
we're trying to cross those lines.''
</P>
<P>
   Promising to transcend racially polarized politics handshake by
handshake and township by township, South Africa's biggest
opposition party has kicked off a national campaign to woo the
black majority and to dent the overwhelming popularity and power of
the governing African National Congress.
</P>
<P>
   It is clearly an uphill battle. Six years after apartheid ended,
no political party has managed to match the ANC's appeal or to
bridge this country's racial divide. But as the nation readies for
elections in November, the predominantly white Democratic Alliance
is emboldened by startling fractures within the governing party's
black supporters.
</P>
<P>
   Polls suggest that a growing percentage of blacks are willing to
consider alternatives to the ANC as they focus less on the politics
of liberation and more on basic governance, community services and
the high rates of unemployment and crime.
</P>
<P>
   Factional fighting and corruption within the party have led
increasing numbers of blacks to view the ANC as ``uncaring for the
masses and mainly interested in personal gain and power,''
according to the party's annual report and recent internal
critiques.
</P>
<P>
   In the past year, Congress membership has declined in all but
two of the nine provinces, according to statistics released at the
party's national meeting in July.
</P>
<P>
   This does not mean that the Democratic Alliance will win
significant numbers of black converts. The alliance is the product
of the recent merger between the New National Party, whose
predecessor created apartheid, and its stronger rival, the
Democratic Party.
</P>
<P>
   After all, blacks still vote mostly for blacks, whites still
vote mostly for whites and distrust between the races still
rankles. In the national election of 1999, only a tiny percentage
of black and white voters _ estimates run at fewer than 2 percent _
crossed the color line.
</P>
<P>
   When opposition politicians arrived in this Congress stronghold,
they discovered that posters of their white leader, Tony Leon, had
been torn to shreds.
</P>
<P>
   Many people still revere the ANC government for giving millions
of blacks houses and access to clean water and electricity. And
while the Democratic Alliance describes itself as a multiracial
party, it counts painfully few blacks among its leaders and
members.
</P>
<P>
   But there is room for opposition inroads. More than a third of
potential black voters surveyed before the 1999 election said they
did not feel close to any political party, according to the
Institute for Democracy in South Africa.
</P>
<P>
   The Congress won 66 percent of the vote in 1999 _ up, in fact,
from the 62 percent in the previous national election. But
political experts believe some people voted for the Congress this
time because they did not find credible alternatives. (The New
National Party and the Democratic Party together garnered about 18
percent of the vote.)
</P>
<P>
   Some blacks are clearly ready to hear a new message. At the
rally here, hundreds turned out to shake their fists in support of
the Democratic Alliance politicians, who promised to tackle violent
crime and the AIDS epidemic.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are determined to stand up on the street corners of South
Africa and on every corner of Khayelitsha and to take the resources
of the street to the people,'' cried Leon, and the crowd roared.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Lawrence Makwela stood in the back of the community hall and
peered at the politicians over the eyeglasses sliding down his
nose. He is a proud member of this community and vividly recalls
the ugly days of apartheid. Still, he said, he would not rule out
voting for a white man.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want to hear what he's going to say,'' said Makwela, 46, who
makes his living selling vegetables. ``He's a good leader, but this
is an African area. We have to be quite sure they mean business,
that they're not taking us for a ride. What kind of message is he
going to give to African people? Do we have a future with this
Democratic Alliance or not?''
</P>
<P>
   That, of course, is the million-dollar question.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONALTRIM)
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
   Leaders of the two former opposition parties, who competed
fiercely for white, Indian and mixed-race voters until their merger
in June, say they can expand their support among blacks, who make
up more than 70 percent of the population. The Alliance registered
as a new party in mid-August.
</P>
<P>
   The party's goal is to cut the ANC's share of the vote to below
50 percent by 2009, in the presidential election after next.
</P>
<P>
   But many political analysts remain skeptical.
</P>
<P>
   ``The discontent is there, but the real debate is over whether
anybody can capitalize on it,'' said Adam Habib, a professor of
politics at the University of Durban-Westville. ``The gap is there.
But you need a political structure, and that hasn't emerged yet.''
</P>
<P>
   The predominantly black Inkatha Freedom Party, once the
Congress' most bitter rival, has considered merging with the
governing party because its supporters are now largely ANC voters
and the party's leader, Mangosuthu Buthelezi, is now minister of
home affairs.
</P>
<P>
   But other parties are building their hopes on dissatisfied
blacks. Two tiny black parties _ the Pan Africanist Congress and
the Azanian People's Organization _ began discussions in August
about merging to improve their chances of attracting those voters.
</P>
<P>
   And to those who dismiss the Democratic Alliance's quest for
black support, the party's strategists point to Zimbabwe. There, an
unlikely alliance of white business executives and black workers
recently won more than a third of the seats in Parliament and
generated the first strong opposition since the end of all-white
rule 20 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   The Alliance leaders here do not expect such radical changes.
Instead, they are wooing working-class blacks with an eye to
winning 5 percent of the black vote in the next presidential
election, in 2004, and 9 to 12 percent by the vote in 2009.
</P>
<P>
   The party has selected Joe Seremane, a black opposition member
of Parliament and a former political prisoner, as its national
chairman. And it is recruiting black members and visiting local
townships to hear community concerns.
</P>
<P>
   ``The challenge is to become a party that black voters can
identify with,'' said Ryan Coetzee, the political strategist for
the Democratic Alliance. ``We've got to build up credibility.
You've got to go where they live and you've got to deliver. White
voters don't want you to pitch up at the shopping mall. But black
voters want to see that you care and see that you identify with
them.''
</P>
<P>
   ANC officials contend, however _ and most political experts seem
to agree _ that the Alliance has a long way to go before it sheds
its image as a party for wealthy whites. (Opposition officials
recently toured Hammanskraal, an impoverished community north of
Pretoria, in a caravan full of shiny Mercedes-Benzes.)
</P>
<P>
   At the Alliance rally here in Khayelitsha, only one of the six
people who addressed the crowd spoke fluent Xhosa, and she was a
longtime ANC worker who had joined the opposition only eight days
earlier.
</P>
<P>
   The Xhosa speaker, Nontsikelelo Jaxa, said the Democratic
Alliance should not expect a quick surge in black membership. ``It
was a very, very difficult decision to make, joining the DA,'' she
said. ``You find yourself feeling like you're betraying your own
people.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The ANC has dismissed the alliance as a ploy to preserve white
privilege, as an attempt by whites to regain political power so
they can halt affirmative action and other programs designed to
empower blacks.
</P>
<P>
   But there is no doubt that the governing party is worried about
losing disaffected voters. Unemployment runs as high as 40 percent
by some estimates. Crime rates are high, and frustration is
simmering.
</P>
<P>
   At the ANC's meeting in July, President Thabo Mbeki warned that
the party could lose power if it loses touch with the masses. He
said there is no room in the Congress for people who join in the
hope it will help them grow rich.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are many instances in Africa and elsewhere in the world
that show what happens when, on becoming a ruling party, a
genuinely popular national liberation movement such as ours loses
contact with the people and its leaders transform themselves into a
self-centered ruling elite,'' Mbeki warned.
</P>
<P>
   The Congress says it has already taken steps to solve its
problems. The party has audited the performance of each city
council, condemned corruption in its ranks and pledged that local
politicians will be more responsive to community concerns.
</P>
<P>
   But some experts say that Leon, the leader of the Democratic
Alliance, has the personality to rally support in ways that Mbeki
cannot. While South Africa's bookish and reserved president rarely
ventures among ordinary people, Leon wandered down the streets
here, shaking hands with astonished citizens, visiting local
clinics and discussing the shortages of medicines and supplies.

 &HT;    
 &HT;    Q: I am having trouble clearing a clog from my bathtub drain.
Water runs out so slowly that it can take up to an hour for the tub
to empty completely.
 &HT;    I pulled out the pop-up drain in the bottom of the tub and
cleaned out all the matted hair and soap, then used a plunger on
the drain opening. This helped only slightly.
 &HT;    Short of using a strong chemical drain cleaner (which I have
been advised to avoid) is there something else you can suggest?
 &HT;    A: You can use a drum-type cable auger (or ``snake'') to clear
tub clogs that are further down in the drain line.
 &HT;    Remove the pop-up drain first, then unscrew and remove the
overflow plate (at the top of the tub). The linkage that connects
this plate to the drain stopper will come out with it.
 &HT;    Next, feed about three feet of the auger cable down through the
overflow tube pushing it in with steady pressure while turning the
crank on the handle.
 &HT;    After pushing through the trap (you will feel resistance
decrease sharply) pull the cable out and run lots of hot water down
the drain.
 &HT;    Then replace the pop-up drain and the overflow plate.
 &HT;    
 &HT;    Q: My plastic laminate kitchen counters are now dull looking,
not bright like they were originally.
 &HT;    Is there anything you can suggest to restore their luster?
 &HT;    A: There are products on the market that are supposed to restore
the gloss to worn Formica and similar plastic surfaces, but as a
rule these only work well on walls, cabinets and other vertical
surfaces.
 &HT;    They can be used on counter tops, but will not last very long
and will wash off easily.
 &HT;    The only other option would be to cover the old laminate with a
new layer of plastic laminate.
 &HT;    Or maybe try something like a clear polyurethane coating over
the old surface _ though I am not sure if the counter would then be
safe for cutting foods on.
 &HT;    
 &HT;    Q:. We have a retaining wall behind our house that is made of
railroad ties piled on top of each other.
 &HT;    The ties had been treated with creosote and this creosote is
constantly seeping out of the exposed wood. The odor is very strong
and annoying.
 &HT;    Is there any way we can treat this exposed wood to seal in this
odor?
 &HT;    A: This problem is not easy to solve. Scraping off as much of
the creosote as you can will help.
 &HT;    Then wash with a solvent such as paint thinner or kerosene. This
will dissolve the creosote on the surface so it can be washed off.
 &HT;    Even more effective would be to use a pressure washer or steam
cleaner, although this may only help for awhile because some of the
creosote may continue to ooze out later on.
 &HT;    Longer lasting results will be secured if you paint over the
creosote with two coats of a stain-killing sealer such as BIN or
Kilz after the wood has been cleaned. These dry white, but the
creosote would probably cause them to turn a brownish color as it
``burns through'' the finish.
 &HT;    
 &HT;    Q: My wood chairs had a heavy wax buildup which I finally
cleaned off several years ago.
 &HT;    However, the finish on the chairs is now sticky again _ when
people sit on a chair they tend to stick to it.
 &HT;    What would you suggest to clean off this sticky film of wax or
soil?
 &HT;    A: For removing wax and polish I have found that mineral spirits
(paint thinner) works well.
 &HT;    Dry cleaning fluid also works well in most cases, and is safer
to use because it is not flammable, but make sure there is plenty
of ventilation in the room when you use any of these.
 &HT;    Wet a rag with the solvent and rub on vigorously over one
section at time. Change rags as they get dirty.
 &HT;    Then rub with a dry cloth to remove the softened wax.
 &HT;    Repeat if necessary.
 &HT;    If the surface is dull apply a cream type furniture polish _ but
apply this sparingly and not too often.
 &HT;    
 &HT;    Questions about home-repair problems should be addressed to

NEW SOFTWARE BEING OFFERED BY MICROSOFT TO CATCH AOL 
</HEADLINE>
   By JOHN MARKOFF   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ For years, it seems, nothing in the software world
has been more ubiquitous than the America Online discs offering
free online hours.
</P>
<P>
   Now Microsoft, which has had trouble gaining ground against AOL
in the online-service market, is preparing a new marketing push.
And for the first time it will offer its own mass-distributed
software for users of its Internet service, MSN.
</P>
<P>
   The campaign, to begin in October, will include more free hours
for signing up, promotional deals with Radio Shack and Best Buy,
broadband service and special software designed to make it easier
to use Microsoft sites like MoneyCentral, Encarta and HomeAdvisor.
</P>
<P>
   A test version of the program, to be called MSN Explorer, will
be available for downloading on Thursday from MSN.com. Once the
promotion has begun, the software will also be distributed on disks
in the fall.
</P>
<P>
   The new software, which requires about five megabytes of
storage, is intended to offer a single point of entry for new users
for all Web and Internet activities.
</P>
<P>
   The idea, said Yusuf Mehdi, who is in charge of marketing for
MSN, is to make it easier to sign up for MSN and for improved
features like Internet search, access to specialized content areas
and electronic shopping.
</P>
<P>
   MSN Explorer has a new look-and-feel, or user interface, he
said, based on an internal Microsoft effort code-named Mars, which
will also guide design of other Microsoft products.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Microsoft, which now claims 3 million Internet-access
subscribers, faces a daunting task in catching the leader, AOL,
which reported a net gain of 750,000 subscribers the last three
months compared with 450,000 for Microsoft.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft executives who have long extolled Microsoft's
leadership in software features are trying to turn MSN Explorer's
paucity of features into an advantage.
</P>
<P>
   Version 5.0 of America Online's software has 138 options that
make it confusing, a Microsoft executive said. The new MSN Explorer
program has far fewer choices.

 &HT;    Qualifying draw aids Euro washouts
 &HT;    By Wendy Parker
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ The new European order that was created after this
summer's Euro 2000 tournament might not remain for long.
</P>
<P>
   UEFA's ``blind draw'' ensured that a few of the
poorer-performing clubs stand a decent chance of reaching the 2002
World Cup. European qualifying starts on Saturday, and some of the
blander sides _ England, Germany, Norway, Belgium and Denmark _
face very weak opposition.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, two of the best teams of the summer _ stylish Euro
semifinalists Holland and Portugal _ are lumped together in Group
2, although they should have no trouble prevailing when qualifying
concludes a year from now. The nine group winners and the top
second-place team advance directly to play in Japan and South
Korea. The remaining eight runners-up will play off for the
remaining four positions.
</P>
<P>
   The most compelling battle this weekend could be Saturday's
friendly in Paris between reigning champion France and England,
which doesn't start qualifying until next month. The match will be
the last for retiring French captain Didier Deschamps, but England
is taking a similar side to the one that disappointed during the
Euro. The major addition is striker Andy Cole of Manchester United,
who could inherit the role of the retired Alan Shearer.
</P>
<P>
   The weekend also will mark the competitive debuts for new
coaches with four of the biggest teams in Europe: Giovanni
Trappatoni of Italy, Louis van Gaal of Holland, Rudi Voller of
Germany and Antonio Oliveira of Portugal.
</P>
<P>
   In Group 1, Yugoslavia is the clear favorite. The Republic of
Ireland has a brutal draw in Group 2, playing at Holland and
Portugal to start. Bulgaria, the Czech Republic and Denmark should
compete in Group 3.
</P>
<P>
   Turkey has never qualified for the World Cup, but has a good
chance in a Group 4 draw with only Sweden to worry about. Norway
and the Ukraine are the best of the lot in Group 5, with Croatia,
Scotland and Belgium enjoying the same status in Group 6.
</P>
<P>
   Spain should have no trouble winning Group 7, and Group 8 honors
should go to Italy and Romania. England and Germany didn't make it
out of the same Euro foursome, but Group 9 probably will be theirs,
because Finland, Greece and Albania haven't come close to reaching
the World Cup.
</P>
<P>
   In CONCACAF, the United States on Sunday plays host to
Guatemala, which never has won on American soil. The contest at RFK
Stadium could propel the Yanks into the next round. Erratic Mexico
plays host to Panama, and Trinidad and Tobago could clinch a berth
against Canada.

   The international and European federations allege that the EC's

   CHAMPIONS LEAGUE Defending champion Real Madrid has earned a
relatively easy break for first-round group play in the Champions
League, which kicks off Sept. 12. Real will meet Bayer Leverkusen,
Sporting Lisbon and Spartak Moscow. Manchester United also has a
favorable draw with Dynamo Kiev, Dutch champions PSV Eindhoven and
Belgian power Anderlecht. Italian champion Lazio should advance out
of a group that includes Arsenal, Sparta Prague and Shakhtar
Donetsk of the Ukraine. The toughest cluster is Group H, with
Barcelona, AC Milan, Leeds and Turkish runner-up Besiktas.

<P>
   It has been a banner season for slobs. As the nation spent the
summer watching those telegenic survivors turn desert-island filth
into high ratings, researchers in the United States and in England
told a different kind of dirty story: a little squalor may be good
for the health. Common household germs and dust, it seems, play a
vital role in the development of immune systems. In housekeeping
terms, this is the equivalent of discovering that chocolate bonbons
cure varicose veins.
</P>
<P>
   All of this may come as a surprise to those who watched Cheryl
Mendelson's manual, ``Home Comforts: The Art and Science of Keeping
House'' (Scribner, $35), rise up best-seller lists last year.
Riding a drift in the national mood, Mendelson raised a crisply
ironed flag for a holy mission against disorder. Even the neatest
of us, she proposed, lives but one step removed from ``the
oppression of dirt, with its associations of death, discomfort,
shame and danger.'' Wielded with due rigor, the Electrolux becomes
not just a modern convenience but a weapon in a moral crusade.
</P>
<P>
   Now, a handful of studies indicate that this crusade may have
gone too far. Though the evidence is still preliminary, researchers
believe our progress in domestic hygiene may be at least partly
responsible for increased rates of asthma, eczema, hay fever and
allergies, and that it may open the avenue for the emergence of new
germs.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are changing the bacteria that we've adapted to over
millions of years,'' said Dr. Stuart Levy, director of the Center
for Adaptation Genetics and Drug Resistance at Tufts University
School of Medicine. The results of this tinkering, he said, are
ominous.
</P>
<P>
   Even a clean room _ that holy grail of parenting _ is overrated,
said Robert Billingham, a professor of human development and family
studies at Indiana University.
</P>
<P>
   ``Parents have bought into the idea that if I don't teach my kid
to be clean and organized, I'm not a good parent,'' said
Billingham, who admitted to not being terribly neat. ``But there
isn't any research that shows messy children are any less healthy
or successful or happy than orderly ones.''
</P>
<P>
   Researchers at the University of Arizona reported last week in
The New England Journal of Medicine that children who were exposed
early to common household germs and infections were less likely to
develop asthma and wheezing by the time they turned 6. Forget about
protecting kids from germs: Those who had older siblings or
attended day care before the age of 6 months _ both prime sources
of filth and infection _ were healthier than the ones who did not.
</P>
<P>
   The results offered the latest round of support for what has
been called the ``hygiene hypothesis,'' a growing contention that
we don't have enough dirt and germs in our lives. In the 1980s,
researchers sought to explain why asthma and allergies were growing
at striking rates in some parts of the world, including the United
States, while pottering along in others. The most obvious
explanation was that pollutants in industrial societies were making
people sick.
</P>
<P>
   Then a string of studies found an unexpected pattern: more
highly polluted cities in places like the former East Germany and
industrial China actually had lower rates of asthma than their
cleaner counterparts in West Germany or Hong Kong. The explanation,
clearly, lay elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
   ``What we're finding is that childhood exposure to infections
and certain environmental toxins seems to have a protective
effect,'' said Dr. Andrew Liu, a pediatric asthma specialist at the
National Jewish Medical and Research Center in Denver. In dirtier
cities, the children grew up around high levels of toxins, and
their immune systems developed the right defensive responses; in
cleaner cities, those growing up in meticulously tidy homes were
less likely to develop defenses against the toxins _ and by
extension, more likely to develop asthma.
</P>
<P>
   Liu and a team of researchers in Denver found that early
exposure to ordinary house dust appears to reduce young children's
chances of developing asthma. The researchers surmised that the
children developed an immune response to common bacterial
components called endotoxins, which are found in dust and around
many animals.
</P>
<P>
   ``The immune system learns much like our brain learns,'' Liu
said. ``There's a tremendous amount of learning in the early years.
It's also possible that there's a critical period for learning an
immune response, and that you may have difficulty catching up
later.'' He cautioned, however, that if someone already has asthma,
dust will only make it worse.
</P>
<P>
   Some researchers further speculate that, with too few germs or
allergens to attack, the immune system turns on the body's own
cells. But the studies of this autoimmune response have been mixed,
Liu said.
</P>
<P>
   Even more risky than the overzealous broom are the armies of
antibacterial products waiting to invade the kitchen, Levy of Tufts
said. A recent survey conducted for the Infectious Diseases Society
of America found that nearly half of all soaps on the market now
contain antibacterial agents.
</P>
<P>
   ``Why does Windex need an antibacterial in it?'' he asked. ``It
already has alcohol.''
</P>
<P>
   At best, Levy said, these products are ineffective. But even if
one did work when first applied, as its level of concentration
dropped, bacteria could produce strains that resist it. Earlier
this summer, in response to this threat, the American Medical
Association suggested government regulation for antibacterial
products. Regular soap and water, Levy said, are the best defense
against germs.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   The war against mess, like other passions of the home, has long
had a social and moral dimension. In America, after all, ``the
great unwashed'' bear a deep social stigma. At the turn of the last
century, keeping a clean home was a ritual not just of hygiene, but
of assimilation, said Suellen Hoy, a historian and the author of
``Chasing Dirt: The American Pursuit of Cleanliness'' (Oxford,
1995). ``It was how you showed you were eager to be an American,''
Hoy said.
</P>
<P>
   Though early pioneers had to establish basic levels of hygiene
to survive, cleanliness quickly evolved into a mark of status and
social mobility _ not next to godliness, as the Methodist leader
John Wesley preached, but next to worldly success. Poor families in
the South swept their dirt floors; immigrants in New York scrubbed
tenement stoops to hospital levels of cleanliness.
</P>
<P>
   Long before Martha Stewart arrived on the scene, tidy rooms and
spotless floors became landmarks in the American mythology.
</P>
<P>
   ``You were cleaning up and moving up,'' Hoy said. ``For a
country that has a hard time coming together on anything, we
certainly do on cleanliness.''
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM.)
</P>
<P>
   This is a tradition that never dies. This year, Ace Hardware ran
a contest soliciting photographs of America's messiest room. They
are portraits of the abyss, the quagmire from which civilization
nonetheless continues to arise.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM.)
</P>
<P>
   The current attack on germs also continues a history, said Nancy
Tomes, a professor of history at the State University of New York
at Stony Brook and the author of ``The Gospel of Germs: Men, Women
and the Microbe in American Life'' (Harvard, 1998). The last germ
panic, as she calls it, took shape in the 1900s. Then, as now, the
anxieties about germs rose during a period of increased immigration
and travel.
</P>
<P>
   ``All of a sudden in the early 20th century, people far away
from you were making your clothes,'' she said. ``The movement to
regulate sweatshops arose from a fear of germs from all these
immigrant workers. With the railroads and subways, people started
to travel among people they didn't know, and whose cleanliness
habits were unknown.''
</P>
<P>
   The current germ mania, she said, began with the outbreak of
AIDS, but has grown beyond the limits of reason. ``I understand the
anxieties about emerging viruses,'' she said. ``But there's nothing
in the science of public health to back up those fears.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   In the end, the struggle for a clean home is a quest not just
for hygiene, but for control. If we cannot control the decline of
civilization in global politics or at the multiplex, at least we
can oppress the dirt in the foyer. In this battle, the control
freaks may have pushed their advantage too far, opening the door
for new levels of chaos and squalor. Sloth may appear lazy, but it
never stays down that long.

U.S.-BORN, JAMAICAN-BORN: PRIMARY HITS ETHNIC NERVE 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Tenn.)   By JONATHAN P. HICKS   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ It is a primary race that has spawned a soap
opera-like drama. The bitterness of a feud between two Democrats in
the 11th Congressional District in Brooklyn has not only torn apart
a longstanding friendship but has also delivered some of that
anguish to the doorsteps of other politicians and voters in
Brooklyn.
</P>
<P>
   But it is also a race that has brought to the surface simmering
_ and often unspoken _ tension between black New Yorkers whose
roots are in the U.S. and those with Caribbean heritage. In her
campaign for Congress, Una Clarke, the Jamaican-born city
councilwoman, has not only heralded her Caribbean roots in the
campaign, but has also accused her old friend and mentor, U.S. Rep.
Major Owens, of being anti-immigrant. Owens, who was born in
Memphis, has accused Clarke of trying to turn black Brooklynites
against one another by using ethnic chauvinism to get votes.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, theirs has not just been a political contest. It
has represented a springboard for many to consider anew the
relationship between two groups of black New Yorkers who often have
their own share of prejudices against one another. At the same
time, it has focused attention on the political impact of New
York's growing Caribbean population.
</P>
<P>
   ``There has always been some degree of tension between
African-Americans and Caribbean-Americans over the years,'' said
Don Quinn Kelley, a professor of history at Medgar Evers College in
Brooklyn. ``Color is the thing the two have in common. But there
are misconceptions, and some degree of mistrust.'' And a race like
the one between Owens and Clarke, he said, ``causes people to focus
on them again.''
</P>
<P>
   Some of that mistrust may come from a natural succession that
has become part of the fabric of New York: The latest immigrant
group encroaching on the territory of earlier groups. In this case,
the wariness has been complicated by the fact that many U.S.-born
blacks in New York City have not had the same economic success that
earlier groups of immigrants had.
</P>
<P>
   ``African-Americans have not translated their gains in the
public sector in the way that the Jews or the Italians did,'' said
Philip Kasinitz, a professor of sociology at the City University
Graduate Center and author of the book ``Caribbean New York.''
``So, when they face the same issues of ethnic succession, in this
case by Caribbeans, it seems that there is more to lose. And that
contributes to the tension.''
</P>
<P>
   To Clarke, a 64-year-old legislator known for her sharp tongue
and her championing of immigrant rights, Owens, also 64, is a tired
congressman who has grown ineffective and disconnected. ``It's not
about friendship,'' she said. ``Too much has been made of
friendship. It's about leadership and effectiveness. I don't think
he has kept up with the needs of the changing community.''
</P>
<P>
   Owens sees Clarke's challenge through a different lens. It is,
he insists, spurred purely by her desire to cling to public office
in the face of a term-limit law that prohibits her from running for
re-election to the New York City Council.
</P>
<P>
   Owens says that by appealing to voters based on her Jamaican
background, Clarke has crossed the line between ethnic pride and
demagoguery. In a recent debate on New York 1, the New York City
cable news network, he likened those tactics to Hitler's.
</P>
<P>
   Clarke said the congressman accused her of something she has
never done. ``I appeal to everyone in every community,'' she said.
Clarke added that it was the congressman who was trying to place a
wedge between citizens born here and those born overseas. The
debate turned into a shouting match, with Clarke declaring
repeatedly, ``Major Owens, you're a liar.''
</P>
<P>
   The population of the 11th Congressional District is about 55
percent black, with more than two-thirds of those being Caribbean
blacks. The district is also about 25 percent white, which includes
a significant population of Orthodox Jewish voters.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the elected officials in central Brooklyn have endorsed
Owens, saying that his seniority in Congress would place him in a
position to be chairman of a committee or subcommittee, should the
Democrats regain control of the House. Moreover, while many
officials complain that the congressman's record has been
unremarkable, they say he has nonetheless been effective and has
roots deep in the community.
</P>
<P>
   The congressman has taken great pains to portray Clarke as an
ally of the Republican Mayor Rudolph Giuliani, which is not
considered a plus in this heavily Democratic district. He charges
that Clarke has not been outspoken about incidents where police
brutality was alleged, pointing out that he was arrested during
civil disobedience activities while she had not been.
</P>
<P>
   ``I dare say that I will get far more Caribbean votes than she
will,'' Owens said. ``And I will get more Jewish votes, too. I
haven't just started forging relationships in this community.''
</P>
<P>
   But Clarke suggests that she expects Caribbean and Jewish voters
to respond favorably to her view on Owens' stewardship.
</P>
<P>
   She denies his contention that she is motivated by term limits;
rather, she calls it a sincere desire to improve the quality of
representation in the district.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you ask people in the district to name a couple of things
that the incumbent has done that demand his remaining, they are
hard pressed,'' she said.

GERALDO CONSIDERS A RUN FOR MAYOR 
</HEADLINE>
   By BILL CARTER   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Geraldo Rivera wants to run for mayor of New York
City and he does not mind if that makes people laugh.
</P>
<P>
   ``I expect the first reaction to be, `Geraldo as mayor, ha
ha,''' Rivera said.
</P>
<P>
   But Rivera, the longtime television journalist who is anchor of
a talk show on CNBC, said on Wednesday that he was completely
serious about an independent campaign for mayor, after a petition
drive to get his name on the ballot, a campaign that he said would
be ``totally self-financed'' _ even if it costs $5 million to $10
million.
</P>
<P>
   The campaign is ``just an exploration'' now, Rivera said. He
said he was considering commissioning a poll to determine his
chances. As for qualifications, Rivera cited his long career
covering issues of relevance to the city, his background as a
lawyer, and, as he put it: ``My whole gene pool is New York. I'm
Puerto Rican and Jewish.''
</P>
<P>
   Rivera's proposed candidacy harks back to a long New York
tradition of media figures' seeking to run for City Hall, reaching
at least as far back as the newspaper publisher William Randolph
Hearst in 1905 and including efforts by William F. Buckley Jr., the
conservative writer and talk show host, in 1965 and the novelist
Norman Mailer in 1969.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, they all lost.
</P>
<P>
   Rivera would prefer a different comparison. ``I think Jesse
Ventura comes much closer to what I want to do: a truly independent
campaign from a political outsider with a serious agenda.'' He said
he would not enter the primaries or try to win the nomination of
any political party.
</P>
<P>
   In a telephone interview, Rivera, who had lived in New Jersey
but has moved back to Manhattan, said he was convinced the city
needed ``a way to come back together.''
</P>
<P>
   Rivera acknowledged that his often made-for-tabloid personal
history, which has included multiple romantic liaisons and public
fistfights, could pose problems. But he said he had sought
redemption the last several years in serious journalism for CNBC
and NBC News. ``I think I've succeeded,'' he said. ``I defy anyone
to debate me on any issue of consequence to New York.''
</P>
<P>
   One question left unanswered: Would it be Mayor Rivera or Mayor
Geraldo? Rivera said, ``Like Elvis and Lassie and Oprah, I have
one-name recognition.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   CARTAGENA, Colombia _ President Clinton made a one-day visit
Wednesday to this secure oasis of Colombia to lend backing to the
nation's counternarcotics program.
</P>
<P>
   He insisted that the $1.3 billion in military aid that
Washington recently agreed to is limited to the drug fight, not
directed toward ending the government's decades-long battle with
rebel groups. ``This is not Vietnam,'' Clinton said, ``nor is it
Yankee imperialism.''
</P>
<P>
   He was reacting to critics at home and in Colombia who fear the
consequences of an increasing fight to stop the drug traffickers of
Colombia, who supply 90 percent of the cocaine and most of the
heroin that enters the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Accompanied by Republican and Democratic lawmakers, Clinton said
the United States was helping Colombia with its $7.5 billion
five-year program to destroy much of its drug crop, root out
traffickers and rebuild its judiciary and other government
operations. Part of those funds are coming from Europe and
international agencies.
</P>
<P>
   But Clinton said continuing support would depend on the Bogota
government's breaking ties with paramilitary groups and adhering to
strict human rights standards.
</P>
<P>
   Rebels bombed three banks, blockaded a road east of Bogota and
engaged in skirmishes with government troops in the hours before
Clinton arrived, the authorities said.
</P>
<P>
   In Bogota, a protest outside the U.S. Embassy turned violent,
and police in Cartagena arrested three men who they said had
bomb-making materials in a house six blocks from one of Clinton's
stops.
</P>
<P>
   The president urged the country's neighbors to stand by Colombia
in its struggle against the drug trade, even if they suffered from
an overflow of refugees, coca growers and guerrillas. Some of those
neighbors are worried about the American attack helicopters and
military advisers headed here. Already rebel activity has increased
since Congress voted the aid.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you really say Colombia can't attack this in an aggressive
way because there will be some negative consequences on our
border,'' Clinton said, ``the logical conclusion is that all the
cancer of narco-trafficking and lawless violence in this entire
vast continent should rest on the shoulders and burden the children
of this one nation. And that's just not right.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton, the first president to visit Colombia in 10 years,
toured one of the main ports and, with President Andres Pastrana
acting as a translator, held emotional meetings with a dozen wives
and mothers of slain soldiers and drug agents.
</P>
<P>
   ``Please help us,'' Diana Viveros, a widow, pleaded to the
president, sobbing and clutching his hand. Clinton looked her in
the eyes and said: ``I came to help. We have to make sure your
husband did not die in vain.''
</P>
<P>
   Tears streamed down the face of Yina Torres, a pregnant woman
whose husband, a soldier, was struck down in the drug war.
``Remember, my mother carried me as a widow,'' Clinton said to
console her, words that caused her to sob deeply. The president
wiped the tears from her face and gave her a hug.
</P>
<P>
   It was the president who became choked up when Carmen Elisa
Nunez handed him a medal that her husband had won for his heroics
before he was killed. The army captain had escaped from rebels of
the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia last year but was
tortured and later killed by them when caught.
</P>
<P>
   ``I will put this up in the White House,'' the president said,
holding the medal close to him.
</P>
<P>
   The meetings were arranged by Pastrana, who in his two years in
office has cooperated closely with the United States, and were
intended to show the depth of the government's struggle against
drug lords and rebels.
</P>
<P>
   Pastrana, addressing the concerns of human rights groups, vowed
to continue to press for improvements in the government's
performance. He asked for time, though, to revamp his army and
police force. ``We are asking the rest of the world to understand
the complexities we have in this country,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   At Clinton's side for much of the day was J. Dennis Hastert, the
House speaker, and other lawmakers who voted to back Pastrana's
``Plan Colombia.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We share a great burden,'' Hastert told the Colombian
president, noting that thousands of people in the United States and
thousands more in Colombia died every year as a result of drug
abuse and violence.
</P>
<P>
   At the port of Cartagena, the entourage of U.S. officials viewed
a high-speed boat used by narcotics agents to intercept smugglers
at sea and a submarinelike vehicle used by traffickers.
</P>
<P>
   Strolling at the water's edge, Clinton stopped to pet a
drug-sniffing dog and inspect a variety of hidden compartments used
to smuggle drugs. ``Very clever,'' he remarked as a captain with
the Colombian navy showed him a boat battery that doubled as a
cocaine hideaway.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton also visited a Casa de Justicia, one of the
U.S.-financed centers aimed at rebuilding the tattered criminal
justice system across Colombia.
</P>
<P>
   There was extraordinary security in place for Clinton's visit,
the first by an American president since President George Bush
visited. Cartegena is a tourist haven and one of Colombia's cities,
unlike the capital, Bogota, and various areas where drug cartels
rule. Similarly, Clinton spent part of last week in Nigeria in the
new capital, Abuja, avoiding the tumult of Lagos, the country's
largest city.
</P>
<P>
   In Bogota on Wednesday, union and student groups protested the
president's visit, on the ground that the nation's war would just
go on longer with the new aid. A police spokesman said of that 20
people had died since early Tuesday, 11 of them civilians, three
guerrillas and six police officers.  &QL; 
A riot policeman was killed in the capital when hooded students
threw a home-made explosive during running battles outside the
National University.

CREDIT SUISSE-DLJ DEAL MAY SIGNAL WAVE OF FUTURE ON WALL STREET 
</HEADLINE>
   By PATRICK McGEEHAN  
 
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ For years, David H. Komansky, the chief executive of
Merrill Lynch &AMP; Co., has been predicting that the financial world
one day will be dominated by a handful of global giants. That
forecast has become accepted wisdom on Wall Street but figuring out
who the eventual rulers will be _ and how many of them will be
based in the United States _ is not getting much easier.
</P>
<P>
   What is clear is that several Wall Street firms, including J.P.
Morgan and Lehman Brothers Holdings, are too small to be among them
unless they buy or are bought by other banks or brokerage firms.
The proposed sale of mid-sized investment bank Donaldson, Lufkin &AMP;
Jenrette to Credit Suisse Group is the clearest sign yet that
securities firms need to be diverse, both geographically and in
their lines of business, to serve the biggest corporations.
</P>
<P>
   Even Merrill Lynch, with the biggest network of stockbrokers in
the world, is not assured a seat at the head table if its
competitors continue to grow at a faster pace. Merrill is no bigger
than any of the other companies generally considered to rank among
the world's top five investment banks.
</P>
<P>
   Its stock-market valuation of about $56 billion makes it the
equal of the Goldman Sachs Group and Credit Suisse and considerably
smaller than Citigroup and Morgan Stanley Dean Witter. By that
measure, Merrill is only about 10 percent bigger than the discount
brokerage firm Charles Schwab Corp.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't believe the management of Merrill Lynch or Goldman
Sachs woke up this morning and said, `Gee, this is great,''' said
Michael Holland, president of the money-management firm Holland &AMP;
Co., referring to Credit Suisse's proposed $12.8 billion purchase
of Donaldson, which was officially announced Wednesday. ``It is
clearly a more competitive creature.''
</P>
<P>
   Joe L. Roby, Donaldson's chief executive who will be chairman of
First Boston's executive committee for three years after the
merger, said his management team decided to sell now because
``there's significant change afoot in our industry.'' Alluding to
consolidation that he expects to continue, he said, ``We were
concerned about activities around us which could have an impact on
our competitive position.''
</P>
<P>
   Jerome P. Kenney, a Merrill executive vice president who
formulates corporate strategy, acknowledged that the combination of
Donaldson and Credit Suisse's Credit Suisse First Boston investment
bank, appears competitive with Merrill on paper. ``One firm is
elevated and could be ranked higher than we are in a few
categories,'' he said. ``This will be a tougher challenge for us
but one we think we're ready for.''
</P>
<P>
   Kenney said Merrill's executives had long anticipated the
consolidation in financial services now taking place. They expected
Donaldson to be snapped up by a competitor and believe similar
acquisitions were inevitable, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Within three years, we expect there to be no major mid-size
independent securities firms in this country,'' he said. ``We'll
end up with 6 to 10 top-tier global players.''
</P>
<P>
   A few years ago, Merrill, Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley were
an unchallenged triumvirate known as ``MGM'' on Wall Street. But
several changes have shaken up the ranks of investment banks:
Morgan Stanley merged with the Dean Witter brokerage firm and grew
much larger, Salomon Brothers merged with the Smith Barney
brokerage firm and then became part of the Citigroup financial
conglomerate, and Goldman Sachs went public and raised capital to
finance its growth.
</P>
<P>
   In the meantime, Credit Suisse became a contender by building up
its technology banking practice in Silicon Valley, just in time to
cash in on the bonanza of Internet stock offerings. Another Swiss
bank, UBS AG, has acquired two investment banks in the last five
years and is in the process of buying PaineWebber Group, the
fourth-largest brokerage firm in the United States, for about $12
billion.
</P>
<P>
   A third big European bank, Deutsche Bank of Germany, acquired a
presence on Wall Street by buying Bankers Trust and its Alex. Brown
brokerage unit, based in Baltimore. And Chase Manhattan Corp.,
which owns the nation's third-biggest bank, has been buying up
investment banks with the hope of becoming competitive in a hurry.
</P>
<P>
   Each of those banks has the resources to buy one or more of the
remaining independent firms on Wall Street. The imbalance of supply
to the potential demand has driven up the prices of shares of those
firms, including Lehman Brothers, J.P. Morgan and Bear Stearns.
</P>
<P>
   The pending purchase of Donaldson has set a floor under the
prices those firms would fetch, analysts said. Credit Suisse has
agreed to pay about three times Donaldson's book value, or the
value of its assets minus liabilities.
</P>
<P>
   Some analysts said other firms would sell for a higher multiple
of their book value, either because they have more stable revenue
and earnings than Donaldson or because a merger involving them
would not involve as much cost-cutting and as many layoffs as are
expected in the Donaldson deal.
</P>
<P>
   Officials of Donaldson and First Boston said they expected to
eliminate about 2,500 jobs in merging the two firms, or about 9
percent of the combined work force of 26,000. Richard Thornburgh,
First Boston's chief financial officer, said that number was low
compared with some bank mergers.
</P>
<P>
   But some analysts said they expected more. ``There will be a lot
of carnage here, tons,'' said Steven Eisman, an analyst at CIBC
Oppenheimer. In addition to layoffs, he said, ``I see a lot of
people coming in here and picking off employees.''
</P>
<P>
   Judah Kraushaar, an analyst at Merrill Lynch, said he thought
J.P. Morgan was the truly attractive target on Wall Street because
it had a strong money-management business that produces steady
fees. He estimates that J.P. Morgan could be acquired for $180 to
$240 a share, compared with its current price of $151.06.
</P>
<P>
   ``The second-tier firms share a lot of the challenges that DLJ
confronted,'' he said. ``After this, they will have a deep-seated
need to reassess a go-it-alone strategy. That's not to say that
some of the bigger companies might not react too.''
</P>
<P>
   Kraushaar said that Chase ``had an interest in DLJ'' and seemed
``eager and willing to look at anything that might come on the
block.''

MISTAKE LEADS TO EARLY RELEASE OF US NEWS COLLEGE RANKINGS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By PATRICK HEALY  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Like actors learning who'll win the Academy Awards a week before
Oscar night, many Northeast colleges got a surprise peek this week
at the latest US News and World Report college rankings, after they
accidentally went on sale before planned.
</P>
<P>
   The 2001 list, a copy of which was obtained by The Boston Globe,
named Princeton University as the nation's number one school.
Harvard University and Yale University tied for second, followed by
the California Institute of Technology _ which was last year's top
school _ and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
</P>
<P>
   A snafu among shipping distributors led bookstores and
supermarkets in Ohio, Vermont, and other states in the region to
put the rankings guidebook on their shelves before the Sept. 4 sell
date.
</P>
<P>
   ``The only fresh item in our Grand Union is the US News
magazine,'' said Phil Benoit, a spokesman for Middlebury College,
quoting from an e-mail about a local market that started selling
the rankings this week.
</P>
<P>
   Benoit and others at Middlebury, who were furiously faxing the
list to colleagues Wednesday, said a few people at the college had
stumbled across the rankings by luck.
</P>
<P>
   Jim Denko, a grocery manager at the Grand Union in town, said
deliverymen put the new guidebooks on the magazine racks days ago,
perhaps not knowing the release date.
</P>
<P>
   ``No idea how it happened,'' Denko said.
</P>
<P>
   The slip-up comes in the wake of an even bigger embarrassment
for US News: The recent disclosure that consultants to the magazine
in 1997 had harsh words for the rankings project.
</P>
<P>
   In a report, publicized last week by the magazine Washington
Monthly, the National Opinion Research Center rapped the rankings
as lacking ``any defensible empirical or theoretical basis'' _ a
criticism many college leaders have made for years.
</P>
<P>
   While the top 25 lists aren't necessarily wrong, the 1997 report
concluded, the ``best'' colleges are not determined scientifically,
but instead through the sometimes-arbitrary decisions of the US
News staff.
</P>
<P>
   ``These consultants have identified some fallacies,'' said
Arthur J. Rothkopf, president of Lafayette College and a critic of
the ranking system. ``The rankings don't give enough weight to how
good a job an institution does at educating students, and how
cost-effective a job it does.''
</P>
<P>
   The magazine uses 16 measures to rank colleges and universities,
such as graduation and retention rates, alumni donations, and
per-student spending.
</P>
<P>
   The most influential measure, worth about 25 percent of the
grade in the US News formula, comes from a survey of college
leaders, who are asked to judge the academic reputation of American
colleges.
</P>
<P>
   Many university officials rail against these measures, but at
the same time, some eagerly tout how big a jump their schools make
on the list. In 1997 some college officials unsuccessfully tried to
boycott the survey on academic reputation, hoping to torpedo the
rankings. But that effort flopped.
</P>
<P>
   Peter Cary, special projects editor at US News, said a survey of
college officials about the 16 measures _ done after the 1997
consultants' report _ showed that most of them endorsed many of the
measures to judge academic quality.
</P>
<P>
   In particular, Cary said, respondents liked ranking colleges on
the number of faculty with terminal degrees, the percentage of
faculty teaching full-time, and student-to-faculty ratios.
</P>
<P>
   ``The present system isn't necessarily wrong, but it's based on
our best judgment,'' Cary said.
</P>
<P>
   In the wake of the consultants' report, however, some educators
are again calling for a better system to help families evaluate
American colleges.
</P>
<P>
   John Lombardi, former president of the University of Florida,
recently published a new sorting system that he argues is more
reliable than the US News approach. His method adjusts data, such
as research spending, endowments, and private donations, so
campuses and university systems are compared with others in their
classes.
</P>
<P>
   ``Opinion-based rankings are highly unreliable because most
experts on universities actually only know about 10 or 12
universities well enough to have even a semi-informed opinion,''
Lombardi said.
</P>
<P>
   But Lombardi's approach lacks rankings and number one schools,
making it much less appealing to students and parents who love
lists.
</P>
<P>
   This year's US News list, however, points up at least one
shortcoming in ranking some institutions ahead of others.
</P>
<P>
   Cal Tech and Johns Hopkins University both fell from their 2000
rankings because the magazine changed how it accounted for
per-student spending. More emphasis was put on undergraduate
education this year, hurting schools with major research and
graduate programs. As a result, Johns Hopkins could have a public
relations dilemma as it tries to explain why it fell from number
seven to number 15.
</P>
<P>
   As for the distribution mistake, Richard Folkers, a spokesman
for US News, Wednesday chalked it up to bad luck. He said the
guidebook ``America's Best Colleges,'' which has the 2001 rankings,
was printed in July and scheduled for sale next week.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's like the last Harry Potter book that busted out a little
early, too,'' Folkers said.
</P>
<P>
   The annual publication of the rankings, timed as seniors return
to high school and try to decide where to apply to college, is
scheduled for Friday on the US News Web site. The magazine has
blitzed college officials and reporters with e-mail about the
Internet release, which made some educators that much more
surprised to find the new list among the grocery aisles first.
</P>
<P>
   The magazine uses a separate category to rank liberal arts
colleges, which tend to have smaller endowments and enrollments,
and fewer graduate programs, than universities. In 2001, the top
five liberal arts schools are listed as Amherst, Swarthmore,
Williams, Wellesley, and Pomona.

ACLU SAYS IT WILL DEFEND PEDOPHILE GROUP IN CIVIL SUIT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RALPH RANALLI  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ Calling it an important case for freedom of speech and
association, the American Civil Liberties Union has stepped in to
defend a $200 million federal civil rights lawsuit brought by the
family of a murdered boy against a controversial group that
advocates sex between adult men and boys.
</P>
<P>
   The ACLU of Massachusetts says it will use the same arguments to
defend the North American Man/Boy Love Association that were used
before the US Supreme Court in the 1960s to protect the NAACP.
</P>
<P>
   The civil liberties group will also act as a surrogate for
NAMBLA, allowing its members to defend themselves in court while
remaining anonymous.
</P>
<P>
   The family of 10-year-old Jeffrey Curley of East Cambridge sued
NAMBLA in federal court in mid-May, alleging that the group and its
Web site _ which is now off line _ incited the attempted
molestation and murder of the boy on Oct. 1, 1997.
</P>
<P>
   One of the two men serving life in prison for the murder,
Charles Jaynes, reportedly viewed the NAMBLA Web site shortly
before the crime and had NAMBLA publications in his possession.
</P>
<P>
   ACLU officials, though, say NAMBLA members deny encouraging
coercion, rape or violence.
</P>
<P>
   ``For us it is a fundamental First Amendment case,'' John
Roberts, executive director of the Massachusetts branch of the
ACLU, said Wednesday. ``It has to do with communications on a Web
site and material that does not promote any kind of criminal
behavior whatsoever.''
</P>
<P>
   It is a crime in Massachusetts to have sex with children under
the age of 16, laws that NAMBLA wants repealed.
</P>
<P>
   Members of NAMBLA contacted the ACLU shortly after the lawsuit
was filed, and the civil rights group formally entered the case
within the last week.
</P>
<P>
   The ACLU's involvement in the case was welcomed as good news by
Curley family attorney Lawrence Frisoli, who said he has had
difficulty trying to serve NAMBLA and its organizers with court
papers.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am actually happy that someone is defending NAMBLA,''
Frisoli said Wednesday. ``Now we can go forward with discovery in
the case.''
</P>
<P>
   One of Frisoli's stated goals for the lawsuit is to ``flush
out'' NAMBLA's leaders, who once held public meetings but have
become increasingly circumspect as publicity about the Curley
lawsuit has grown. Yet Frisoli may not get the additional
information he is seeking if the civil liberties group prevails in
court.
</P>
<P>
   ACLU board member Harvey Silverglate said Wednesday that the
group's attorneys will try to block any attempt by the Curleys to
get NAMBLA's membership lists or other materials identifying
members, citing US Supreme Court cases from the 1960s that
protected the NAACP's civil rights activities in the South.
</P>
<P>
   In two cases during the civil rights era, the Supreme Court held
that the NAACP could not be forced to disclose its membership lists
because to do so would be an unacceptable encroachment on the right
to freedom of assembly guaranteed by the First Amendment.
</P>
<P>
   Silverglate also said the ACLU will use another Supreme Court
case, Claiborne Hardware v. NAACP, to block the Curleys' attempt to
hold NAMBLA responsible for the actions of Jaynes, 25, of Brockton,
and the other convicted killer in the case, Salvatore Sicari, 24,
of Cambridge.
</P>
<P>
   In that case, the merchants of Claiborne County, Miss., sued the
NAACP, claiming it had incited its members to physically attack and
destroy the property of blacks who did not honor a boycott of
white-owned businesses.
</P>
<P>
   State courts in Mississippi gave the merchants a huge monetary
award that would have bankrupted the NAACP in much the same way
that Frisoli has vowed to bankrupt NAMBLA and put it out of
business, Silverglate said. But the Supreme Court overturned the
verdict.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was one of the most important decisions on freedom of
association,'' he said. ``The court held that any action by an
individual can only be held against the individual, not the
group.''
</P>
<P>
   The ACLU has caused public stirs in the past by defending
neo-Nazis and Ku Klux Klan members. NAMBLA is just the sort of
publicly unpopular group whose free speech and association rights
need to be defended most, Silverglate said.
</P>
<P>
   ``This case is exactly where the rubber meets the road,'' he
said. ``They (NAMBLA) don't encourage breaking the law. They are a
political advocacy organization.''
</P>
<P>
   Attempts by the Globe to contact NAMBLA have proven
unsuccessful, although a person claiming to be a member of the
organization attempted to arrange an anonymous interview through
the American Friends Service Committee, a politically-neutral human
rights organization based in Cambridge.
</P>
<P>
   The Globe declined the interview, however, when the person
refused to divulge his name or offer any other proof of an
affiliation with NAMBLA.
</P>
<P>
   In the past, however, NAMBLA officials have insisted that they
do not advocate forcible or coercive sex. Their main goal, they
say, is the abolition of age-of-consent laws that classify sex with
children as rape.
</P>
<P>
   NAMBLA representatives have said they believe boys as young as 8
are capable of deciding for themselves whether to have consensual
sex with an older man.

 By JIM RUTENBERG   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   In 1997, CNN, the 24-hour cable news channel, found itself at
somewhat of a dead end.
</P>
<P>
   Its blanket coverage of the Persian Gulf war had already
established it as the news outlet to turn to in times of crisis.
But it was not the one to watch for general news when times were
quiet.
</P>
<P>
   With the country well into a prolonged period of prosperity, and
new cable news outlets being started by Fox and General Electric's
NBC _ creating the threat of competition where there had been none
before _ CNN's executives were looking for something to make it the
news outlet of record all of the time.
</P>
<P>
   So they hired Richard N. Kaplan, an ABC News producer widely
regarded as gifted, in the hope that as the president of their
United States operation, he would bring to CNN what the broadcast
networks already had: highly produced news programming so
compelling that millions of people would tune in regularly whether
there was big news or not. Think ``Nightline'' and ``Prime Time
Live'' on ABC, a unit of the Walt Disney Co.
</P>
<P>
   But in the three years that have passed, CNN's audience has
shrunk to its lowest levels in at least a decade. Advertising
revenues, while still increasingly significant thanks to a robust
market, are not meeting expectations, executives there said.
</P>
<P>
   Dual announcements Wednesday that Kaplan was resigning from CNN
and that its entire executive structure was being revamped were
accompanied by admissions that the strategy did not work and a
sense in some quarters that the network had become too slick and
sophisticated for its own good. The situation seems to be of
pressing concern as CNN finds itself in an increasingly competitive
environment.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is important that CNN News group make major changes, which
will better equip us to strengthen ourselves,'' said Tom Johnson,
the CNN chairman, ``and to become even more competitive in the
Internet world.''
</P>
<P>
   The question remains: where, exactly, does CNN go from here?
</P>
<P>
   Can it ever regain its status as a must-see network at a time
when its franchise has been chipped away at relentlessly _ among
conservatives and political junkies, by the News Corp.'s Fox News
Network, among the young, by MSNBC, and among the financial news
junkies now being served by the fast-rising CNBC?
</P>
<P>
   Kaplan's resignation also raises the question of what CNN will
look like inside its prospective, new corporate parent, America
Online, which is acquiring Time Warner, of which CNN is a
subsidiary.
</P>
<P>
   These are questions that have been consuming much of the CNN
executives' time. In recent weeks, at meetings at the Four Seasons
Hotel in Atlanta and other venues, they have been in various,
sometimes tense discussions trying to analyze the network's
failings and trying to figure out what can be done to draw viewers.
</P>
<P>
   Amid the fallout from Wednesday's news, executives at CNN's
Atlanta's headquarters were sending somewhat mixed signals as to
what needed to be done to turn things around at the network.
</P>
<P>
   There was wide agreement that the expensive and highly produced
programming that Kaplan made his trademark at the network would not
be in such abundance, that the network would go for somewhat of a
rougher, newsier feel like the one that helped put it on the map in
the first place.
</P>
<P>
   Where Kaplan had tried to bring a higher level of sophistication
to the network, one top-level manager said executives would like to
also produce a greater number of stories with broader audience
appeal, though he did not offer specifics. There was also an
acknowledgment that the network needs more news stars, large
personalities who will stand out above the din, help CNN
distinguish itself and draw viewers _ echoing a refrain from before
Kaplan's arrival there.
</P>
<P>
   In conversations with numerous CNN executives Wednesday, there
was a sense that the network had been slowfooted in adapting to the
new environment, after being, for so long, the only major cable
news provider.
</P>
<P>
   They said they believe this led to one of their greater
failings: not realizing that with all the new competition, CNN
needed to be more heavily promoted in other media.
</P>
<P>
   Kaplan _ whose fate was sealed Tuesday, when he was presented
with a new CNN flow chart that did not include him _ said the lack
of promotion was a key factor in the failure of his magazine-style
programs, and, ultimately, in his downfall.
</P>
<P>
   Boasting a large presence both literally and physically _ he is
6 feet 4 inches tall with a booming voice _ Kaplan arrived at CNN
with a reputation as an imposing figure in the broadcasting
establishment.
</P>
<P>
   He brought in some of his former stars from ABC, like Willow Bay
and Jeff Greenfield, as well as some producers. Some old guard CNN
executives who were at the network from its start in 1980 and still
saw themselves as television news renegades, took to calling Kaplan
and his new hires ``the ABC mafia.''
</P>
<P>
   They predicted that his signature news magazine program,
``NewsStand,'' would not work on cable, where viewers tend to flip
between channels and do not necessarily have patience for longer,
in-depth stories. It has still not taken off with viewers. The
program stumbled when its first episode, alleging that the United
States military used nerve gas during the Vietnam War, had to be
retracted.
</P>
<P>
   In a telephone interview from his office in Atlanta Wednesday,
Kaplan said he thought ``NewsStand,'' like all of CNN's
programming, would have done better in the ratings if it had been
better advertised to the public.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think our problem is that, in an age when people are
promoting the hell out of everything they do, for CNN to still do
absolutely no promotion is wrong, and is debilitating, and I think
they know that,'' Kaplan said.
</P>
<P>
   He noted that the network is now planning to make a major
promotional push in order to raise audience awareness about its
programs. ``I wish it was something that happened when I was
here,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   He said he expected that the merger between CNN's parent and AOL
would further help promote the network.
</P>
<P>
   But AOL's appearance on the scene is said by top CNN executives
to be among the largest factors in Kaplan's forced resignation.

GERALDO CONSIDERS A RUN FOR MAYOR 
</HEADLINE>
   (eds: also moved in `p' category)  
 By BILL CARTER   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Geraldo Rivera wants to run for mayor of New York
City and he does not mind if that makes people laugh.
</P>
<P>
   ``I expect the first reaction to be, `Geraldo as mayor, ha
ha,''' Rivera said.
</P>
<P>
   But Rivera, the longtime television journalist who is anchor of
a talk show on CNBC, said on Wednesday that he was completely
serious about an independent campaign for mayor, after a petition
drive to get his name on the ballot, a campaign that he said would
be ``totally self-financed'' _ even if it costs $5 million to $10
million.
</P>
<P>
   The campaign is ``just an exploration'' now, Rivera said. He
said he was considering commissioning a poll to determine his
chances. As for qualifications, Rivera cited his long career
covering issues of relevance to the city, his background as a
lawyer, and, as he put it: ``My whole gene pool is New York. I'm
Puerto Rican and Jewish.''
</P>
<P>
   Rivera's proposed candidacy harks back to a long New York
tradition of media figures' seeking to run for City Hall, reaching
at least as far back as the newspaper publisher William Randolph
Hearst in 1905 and including efforts by William F. Buckley Jr., the
conservative writer and talk show host, in 1965 and the novelist
Norman Mailer in 1969.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, they all lost.
</P>
<P>
   Rivera would prefer a different comparison. ``I think Jesse
Ventura comes much closer to what I want to do: a truly independent
campaign from a political outsider with a serious agenda.'' He said
he would not enter the primaries or try to win the nomination of
any political party.
</P>
<P>
   In a telephone interview, Rivera, who had lived in New Jersey
but has moved back to Manhattan, said he was convinced the city
needed ``a way to come back together.''
</P>
<P>
   Rivera acknowledged that his often made-for-tabloid personal
history, which has included multiple romantic liaisons and public
fistfights, could pose problems. But he said he had sought
redemption the last several years in serious journalism for CNBC
and NBC News. ``I think I've succeeded,'' he said. ``I defy anyone
to debate me on any issue of consequence to New York.''
</P>
<P>
   One question left unanswered: Would it be Mayor Rivera or Mayor
Geraldo? Rivera said, ``Like Elvis and Lassie and Oprah, I have
one-name recognition.''

WILLIAMS SISTERS DOGGED BY FANS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BUD COLLINS  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Venus and Serena are running. They are sprinting
across the crimson paving stones of the plaza at the National
Tennis Center Wednesday afternoon, and everybody is trying to catch
up.
</P>
<P>
   ``Venus, Serena,'' people are shouting. ``Hey, there they are.
Hey, sisters.''
</P>
<P>
   The mighty Sisters Sledgehammer have to be careful that they
don't trample their pet dogs _ tiny, leashed terriers that seem to
be running for their lives. Jack Russell Williams, Serena's
bauble-on-legs, is white with beige splotches. Pete Williams,
Venus's butterscotch Yorkshire, reminds me of one of Martina
Navratilova's midget curs that her coach with the bygone Boston
Lobsters, Roy Emerson, described as ``a rat with a hair stylist.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Venus, Serena.''
</P>
<P>
   People are following, waving pens for autographs, and just plain
waving. Or cameras, trying to get the Misses Williams _ Serena in
purple slacks and top, Venus in navy shorts and T _ in their camera
sights. This has become a parade to make the Pied Piper of Hamelin
jealous.
</P>
<P>
   But instead of flutes, the sisters mesmerize with rackets. The
procession is a movable metaphor for tennis and the US Open: The
crowd _ their rivals _ pursues like puppies but cannot overtake.
The way these sisters accelerate, who could do anything but end up
coughing, swallowing their dust? To catch a Williams you'd have to
be a Williams _ in the title bout. Either Serena keeps her title,
or Venus takes it away.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd love to play Serena in the final,'' Venus says. She has
just flattened Kveta Hrdlickova, 6-1, 6-1, in a 48-minute
second-rounder. The sisters are perched on opposite sides of the
draw, third-seeded Venus in 1997 champ Martina Hingis's precinct,
fifth-seeded Serena in 1998 champ Lindsay Davenport's. ``That would
be my pick, Serena and me. We've played each other in practice
almost every day for years. But we'd like this better, playing for
a lot of people. We feel badly when there's no one there to
watch.''
</P>
<P>
   Folks are watching the giggling, grinning sisters' gigantic
strides now as they pass a throng, maybe a couple of thousand,
waiting for Anna Kournikova at a scheduled autograph session.
Kournikova, the most luminous Russian since Catherine the Great,
may win more male hearts, but she's merely a sideshow here. The
sisters are the Grand Exposition, the kids who win on court, too.
</P>
<P>
   As they keep moving along the plaza toward Louis Armstrong
Stadium to browse the gallery containing the International Tennis
Hall of Fame's championship exhibit, word spreads of another
brouhaha and defeat of Dokic. That would be the erratic Damir
Dokic, president of the sport's Bad Dads Club, father/coach of
gifted 17-year-old Aussie Jelena Dokic, who ranks No. 43.
</P>
<P>
   Papa Dokic, a relative newcomer to the scene but already a
persona non grata internationally, got into yet another jam,
screaming at employees of the players' dining room over the price
(adjudged too big, $13.50) of a piece of salmon (adjudged too
small). Unable to calm him, security called a police officer, who
threw him off the grounds from which he's been banned. Nothing new.
Another fine kettle of fish, leaving his daughter weeping. He was
pitched from the Birmingham (England) tourney last year.
</P>
<P>
   This year, burly, bearded Daddy D. has assaulted a TV cameraman
at the Australian Open, and a TV reporter at Wimbledon. Dokic
watchers wonder why he was so uncharacteristically docile at the
French Open. An outburst there, coupled with Wednesday's
performance, could have given him a Grand Slam of boorishness.
</P>
<P>
   The sisters' papa, Richard Williams, has had his moments on
camera, too. But such as his victory dance on a TV booth after
Venus won Wimbledon are hardly in Dokic's ill-tempered league.
</P>
<P>
   Arriving at the gallery, the sisters pause at one of numerous
huge banners, a photographic juxtaposition of Ellen Hansell, the
original US champion, victor in 1887, and Serena, the last champion
of the 20th century. A pair of 17-year-olds. The show, entitled
``The Lady is a Champ,'' features 35 Americans who have won US
women's singles titles.
</P>
<P>
   ``Pretty long dress on her,'' Serena is amazed at the shoetop,
fully-sleeved gown enshrouding Hansell. ``Pretty hard to run.''
</P>
<P>
   ``No ankles unveiled in those days,'' says Mark Young of the
Hall of Fame. ``And they wore whalebone corsets.'' The sisters
wince.
</P>
<P>
   Peering into a display case, they are intrigued by the spiked
shoes of Helen Jacobs, the victor of 1932, '33, '34, and '35.
``They must have used them when the tournament was on grass,''
Venus surmises correctly.
</P>
<P>
   Althea Gibson, who hurdled the tennis color bar in 1950 and won
the title in 1957 and '58, grabs their attention.
</P>
<P>
   A man standing nearby says, ``Althea was the hardest-serving
champ until you, Serena.''
</P>
<P>
   But the item that really gasses them is the red gingham dress
that Tracy Austin (winner in 1979 and '81) wore in her 1977 debut
as a 90-pound, 14-year-old quarterfinalist. It's a pinafore made by
her mother.
</P>
<P>
   ``Imagine me trying to get into that,'' laughs Serena.
</P>
<P>
   ``It wouldn't even be a T-shirt for you,'' responds Venus.
``But, remember? Mom made my outfit for my first pro tournament in
'94.''
</P>
<P>
   They're off on the run again, and the dogs look intimidated.
``Gotta get back to the locker room and change for doubles,'' says
Serena. That will be a 45-minute gig over Kristy Boogert and Miriam
Oremans, 6-1, 6-1.
</P>
<P>
   ``What was it like?'' the vanquished Netherlanders are asked.
``The stadium was nice,'' says Boogert. ``But the Williams are too
big, too strong, too good.''
</P>
<P>
   And running too fast.

<P>
   NEW YORK _ When John Fix III closes Cornell's True Value
hardware store in Eastchester, N.Y., every night at 6, he turns out
the lights but leaves the computers running. During the day they
perform inventory checks or crunch numbers, but at night, the
store's 12 personal computers are connected to Napster, the music
file-sharing service.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike other Napster users, Fix doesn't have a long list of
favorite songs he hopes to have downloaded by the time he returns
in the morning. Instead, he is using his battalion of PCs to work
toward a different goal: he wants to riddle the Napster universe
with thousands of unusable song files, thereby making Napster less
reliable _ and less attractive _ to its many fans.
</P>
<P>
   Fix and his brother, Michael, operate a Web site that explains
how to ``lay'' what they call cuckoo's eggs, or bad song files,
onto the hard drives of Napster users. The brothers' Web site is
just one of many homespun initiatives to come out of the disputes
generated by Napster and other sites, like Gnutella and Scour, that
let users trade MP3 music files.
</P>
<P>
   In September, a three-judge panel is expected to hear arguments
on whether to permit an injunction against Napster to go into
effect. The injunction would stop Napster users from trading
copyrighted music. But many people have not been content to wait
and have gone online to express their own opinions on the issue _
and even take action to promote their points of view.
</P>
<P>
   Napster and its kin can be viewed as sharing or stealing, as an
innocent means of file sharing or an insidious way to infringe on
copyright. There are plenty of sites on both sides of the issue.
</P>
<P>
   Musicians are behind many of the anti-Napster sites. Earlier
this summer, the Fix brothers were gleefully downloading live Bruce
Springsteen tracks from Napster and reveling in the fact that all
of it was free. But Michael Fix, whose wife, Stephanie, is a singer
and songwriter, started thinking about the unfairness of taking the
work of other people without their permission.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was all thrilled by it,'' he said, ``and then all of a
sudden repulsed by it because of Stephanie. We wish there was a
fair system for artists to share their work online. It's not so
much about compensation for us, but it is about permission. It
should be up to the artist.''
</P>
<P>
   Working after hours at the hardware store, the Fix brothers
released their first batch of cuckoo's eggs in mid-June,
transferring songs by Stephanie Fix to Napster and renaming them as
songs by popular artists. Napster users who searched for Bruce
Springsteen's ``American Skin,'' for example, and downloaded the
version offered by the Fix brothers would instead hear a song by
Stephanie.
</P>
<P>
   But the Fixes had to change their strategy when they realized
that their message was being misunderstood. ``People sent e-mails
accusing us of promoting Stephanie's work, not protesting
Napster,'' Michael Fix said. The second batch of song files
consisted of correctly named song files, but 30 or so seconds into
each song, the brothers inserted an audio clip of the cartoon
character Charlie Brown saying, ``Congratulations,'' followed by a
clip of Yosemite Sam saying, ``Looks like you goofed up
somewhere,'' followed by the sound of a chirping cuckoo that
continued for the rest of the track.
</P>
<P>
   The Cuckoo's Egg Project has received an onslaught of angry
e-mail messages at the site (www.hand-2-mouth.com/cuckooegg), and
hundreds of messages about it have been sent to Slashdot, the
technology site. John Fix said messages were also sent to the
Napster site from people who have downloaded Cuckoo's Egg Project
song files. He estimates that the 91 cuckoo's eggs he and his
brother have created are downloaded 300 to 400 times a day. He said
he was banking on the idea that many people made their song files
available to others without listening to them first.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   ``Most of the folks who disagree write a profane e-mail and move
on, or try to write an intelligent response,'' Michael Fix said,
``but a lot of people have contacted us to say they think we're
doing a great job. The discussion makes us happy and makes it worth
all the work.''
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   One cuckoo's egg went to Tim Poirier, of Bath, Maine, when he
recently downloaded what he thought was a Backstreet Boys remix for
his daughter. When he played the song using a Winamp MP3 player, he
heard a string of cuckoos and saw the Cuckoo's Egg Project Web site
address in the tag window. He went to the site to find out what had
happened.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was annoyed at first,'' Poirier said, ``but then I went to
check it out and read what he had to say. He has a very good case
that people like his wife aren't ever going to make any money
through Napster.''
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   He also went to Stephanie Fix's site and listened to a couple of
her songs. The experience made him re-evaluate his use of Napster.
``I have no problem downloading a song for my kids that they're
going to listen to once instead of buying the CD for $15,'' he
said. ``But I'd buy Stephanie's CD instead of downloading it
because it's something I'd listen to again and again.''
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Another site, Stopnapster.com (www.stopnapster.com), started by
The Tabloids, a rock band in Oakland, Calif., explains and
encourages the use of ``Napster bombs'' (mislabeled song files) and
cuckoo's eggs (it calls them Trojan horses). It also presents the
legal arguments against sharing copyrighted material, as well as
the dangers file sharing presents for users' computers. (Michael
Robinson, lead singer of The Tabloids, says file sharing is like
``unsafe sex.'') Robinson says sites like Napster hurt recording
artists who release albums on independent labels because it is more
difficult for them to recover the costs of lost album sales.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   If record companies hired anti-Napster staffs to create and
disperse bad song files, the site says, Napster and other
file-sharing sites would soon ``go the way of the Hula-Hoop.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Napster has started this Orwellian logic where things aren't
really what they seem,'' Robinson said. ``Stealing is called
`sharing' or `sampling,' but in our minds, it's stolen.''
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Robinson said he had started the site because he believed that
people were overlooking the fact that Napster is a business. ``This
is not two college kids e-mailing songs to each other,'' he said,
``but a corporation making money off of published music.''
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Tracy Robinson, Stopnapster's administrative manager, said the
site got about 4,000 visitors a day and a steady influx of e-mail.
The site has received 132 e-mail messages from people who are
anti-Napster, 173 e-mail notes from people who are still on the
fence, and 278 e-mail messages from people who support Napster _
some of whom Robinson calls howlers because of the obscenities they
use in their protests.

</P>
<P>
   Travis Hill, a software designer in Provo, Utah, has been
working on a different way to squelch Napster users. His Media
Enforcer software (www.mediaenforcer.net), which he released in
May, allows an individual to search Napster and Gnutella servers
and compile lists of the screen names of people who are offering to
share specific artists or song titles. A new version of the
software, which will soon be released, will also reveal the music
sharer's IP address, which can be traced to that person's Internet
service provider.
</P>
<P>
   Hill, an amateur musician, said he had designed the program to
help artists track people distributing their music without
permission. He thinks that music-sharing sites are a deterrent for
aspiring artists, he said. ``If you eliminate intellectual property
royalties,'' he said, ``there won't be a reason for musicians to
create any work. The music industry really should put together a
better digital distribution plan. But for now, people need to
respect copyrights and intellectual property.''
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Although the trail back to the Napster user ends with the ISP,
Hill said, his software will allow artists, their managers or their
record labels to get in contact with the ISP with a request to
forward a ``cease and desist'' notice from the artist to the
computer that was used to share music files. The privacy policies
of most ISPs require a court order before they will contact one of
their clients or forward a message to a client, but Hill said he
believed that an artist whose music was being shared without
permission would have grounds to get such an order. Hill said the
Media Enforcer software would work on other MP3 sites so would be
effective even if Napster was shut down.

   &LR;

<P>
   ``If an artist or a label really wants to stop someone from
making their music available,'' Hill said, ``they're going to need
a sizable group of people working just to track the usage patterns
of Napster users on the Internet. It's really the only productive
way to go about it.''
</P>
<P>
   The flip side of the music-sharing debate _ the contention that
MP3 sites like Napster and Gnutella benefit musicians and that file
sharing over the Internet should be unregulated _ are also
represented online. Matt Miszewski, a band manager in Milwaukee,
for example, began Napster Freedom (Napsterfreedom.com) in August
in an effort to show anti-Napster bands that consumers were buying
their albums as a result of listening to them through files shared
online.
</P>
<P>
   The site's Tracker section features a list of recording artists
who have spoken out against Napster, and it invites visitors to say
how much they have spent on records by each artist. That
information (which the site does not verify) is sent to each
artist's management.
</P>
<P>
   In a press release, Miszewski wrote that Napster Freedom was a
powerful way to garner support for ``downloadable music and its
martyr, Napster.'' The site also features a pro-Napster petition
and encourages the purchase of CD's from pro-Napster artists by
listing some of them.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Miszewski's argument for supporting Napster _ that it helps
support little-known bands _ has been widely debated. ``We utilize
Napster and other MP3 sites to market products that aren't getting
air time elsewhere,'' he said. ``Shutting down the site will be an
unfortunate side effect for them.''
</P>
<P>
   Many people believe that because Napster is a search engine that
lets people look up specific songs and artists, there is little
opportunity for people to encounter new artists through
serendipity. (Miszewski argues that Napster and similar sites
promote new artists through chat rooms and other programs.) Other
music sites, like ThrottleBox (Throttlebox.com) and Freelisten.com
(freelisten.com), have been created to help promote the work of
lesser-known recording artists via the Web.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   ThrottleBox, based in Johnson City, N.Y., promotes the work of
new and lesser-known artists by making audio and video files, liner
notes and other marketing material available. It also protects the
artists' work by putting them into a file format that is difficult
to copy (users must download ThrottleBox Player software to listen
to the music files).
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   ``We have what we believe to be the single-largest collection of
sanctioned downloadable content for free,'' said Drew Saur,
ThrottleBox's chief technology officer. The site, he said, is based
on the idea that exposure drives record sales.
</P>
<P>
   ``I find that after I find something I like, I buy it,'' he
said. ``Now it's time for the record labels to step up to the plate
and start doing this sort of thing.''
</P>
<P>
   Adario Strange, formerly editor in chief of The Source, a
hip-hop magazine, started Freelisten.com this month to highlight
new artists with both free music files and other promotional
material. Instead of providing an unending array of free music
files, Strange said, Freelisten will focus on a few artists and
offer exclusives from better-known artists to attract listeners.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm trying to accrue value and cool points with the fans,''
Strange said.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Fans can tip their favorite artists online through Fairtunes,
which was started this month by two students at the University of
Waterloo in Ontario (fairtunes.com). The site lets the fan enter in
a dollar amount, indicate the recipient and submit a credit card
number. The founders of Fairtunes, Matt Goyer and John Cormie, then
send checks to the artist's management. ( Goyer said postage fees
came out of their tuition money.)
</P>
<P>
   ``We started the site because we were downloading songs from our
favorite artists but it seemed inefficient to go to the record
store and buy a CD as a way of compensating them,'' Goyer said.
``We thought, `We can get songs over the Web, so why can't we pay
artists over the Web?'''
</P>
<P>
   Fairtunes has raised nearly $1,400 in American and Canadian
dollars. It recently sent a check to U2 for $80, and a check for
$30 to a lesser-known Canadian band called The Noisies, Goyer said.
</P>
<P>
   Goyer and Cormie also hope to work with other MP3 sites to add
tip buttons next to downloading bars so people downloading music
can choose to pay the artists through the Web site.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   It's even conceivable that Fairtunes or other programs like it
could become a vehicle for not only voluntary tipping, but enforced
payment. Last week, NapsterFreedom made an agreement with Fairtunes
to include a voluntary tipping button on a new Napster-like
file-sharing program being developed by Topical Networks, the
company that created NapsterFreedom.
</P>

   Miszewski, of NapsterFreedom, said that the new file-sharing
program would be based on voluntary payments but that Topical
Networks would work with record companies if a court decision
mandated payment for MP3 files.
</P>
<P>
   ``We won't flip the switch until a court decision mandates
payment,'' Miszewski said, ``but we're ready for it if it
happens.''

 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)   &HT;    Lesbians plan legal marriage
 &HT;    Judge cites sex ruling, vows to grant Texas' first license
 &HT;    
 &HT;    
 &HT;    
 &HT;    By POLLY ROSS HUGHES
 &HT;    c. 2000 Houston Chronicle
<TEXT>
<P>
   A lesbian couple from Houston plans to legally marry in Texas
next month, a prospect that has stymied the Texas Christian
Coalition and its social conservative allies.
</P>
<P>
   Next Wednesday, Robin Wicks and Jessica Wicks plan to travel to
San Antonio, said their attorney, where the county clerk promises
to grant the two women a marriage license.
</P>
<P>
   It would be the state's first legal recognition of a lesbian
marriage, and it is made legal because one of the women used to be
a man.
</P>
<P>
   Robin Wicks was born a female, Robin Manhart. Jessica Wicks was
born a male, Grady Roland Wicks, and had a sex-change operation.
Robin legally changed her name to Wicks because of their love for
each other and their desire to wed.
</P>
<P>
   The two women declined to be interviewed but agreed to be
photographed and have referred all questions to their attorney,
Phyllis Randolph Frye.
</P>
<P>
   Bexar County clerk Gerard C. Rickoff &UR;  &LR; confirmed he will grant
the women a license. He cited a San Antonio appeals court ruling
that determined, as he put it, ``you are what you are by your
creator.''
</P>
<P>
   The two women were turned down in Harris County three weeks ago,
when the Houston clerk cited the Texas Family Code's prohibition
against same-sex marriages. The appeals court decision in San
Antonio, however, gave Frye the idea to go there to seek the
license. Now, the couple is happily planning a Sept. 16 wedding.
</P>
<P>
   In a different gender case last year, the 4th Court of Appeals
in San Antonio ruled in a wrongful death medical malpractice suit
filed by a widow. That court ruling blocked the suit by negating
the widow's seven-year marriage to the deceased man.
</P>
<P>
   The court ruled that the widow, Christie Lee Cavazos Littleton,
who had had a sex-change operation, had been born a man and
therefore the marriage wasn't legal. The court said sex is
determined by chromosomes, not by medically induced genital
alterations.
</P>
<P>
   Even the Texas Legislature's staunchest opponent of same-sex
marriage says he sees no legal impediments to the &UR;  &LR; marriage of
Robin and Jessica Wicks.
</P>
<P>
   ``What a twisted world we live in,'' said state Rep. Warren
Chisum, R-Pampa. ``I agree that gender is based on chromosomes, so
I think that would set precedent, and I can't disagree with that. I
don't know anything legislatively you can do about that. You strike
up the most bizarre situation in the world, and the law's not
always able to contend with it.''
</P>
<P>
   Attorney Frye, a transsexual herself, said that if chromosomes
matter but genitals don't, the court has cleared the way for
same-sex marriages involving partnerships in which one person was
born a male and the other a female.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are trying to point out how stupid the Littleton ruling
was,'' said Frye, who represented the appeal of Christie Littleton,
who lives in San Antonio. Frye said the Texas Supreme Court has
twice refused to consider the arguments in that case, but the U.S.
Supreme Court will decide in September whether or not to hear it.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're making it an issue with this (Wicks) marriage because
the conservatives thought, with the Littleton decision, the
prevention of same-sex marriage was secure,'' Frye said. ``We're
going to start encouraging all the transgendered people in the
state who are in gay and lesbian relationships to take advantage of
the Littleton decision and start seeking marriage licenses.''
</P>
<P>
   Dianne Hardy-Garcia, executive director of the Lesbian-Gay
Rights Lobby of Texas, said the Wicks marriage breaks new ground in
Texas but also apparently nationally.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is really new, and I don't know of any other case,'' she
said. ``Certainly Phyllis Frye out of Houston has been at the
cutting edge of transgender activism for many years. Texas has one
of the most outspoken transgender communities in the nation.''
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Glen Maxey, D-Austin, the only openly gay member of the
Texas Legislature, said the unusual case in Houston shows exactly
why government should not be getting involved in the private lives
of its citizens.
</P>
<P>
   ``Because government got involved in something they should have
never gotten involved with,'' he said, ``you have these absurdities
and seeming irrationalities.''
</P>
<P>
   On this point, the Texas Christian Coalition appears to agree.
</P>
<P>
   Although the group believes in the sanctity of the male-female
marriage, the Wicks situation boggles the mind, said Chuck
Anderson, the coalition's executive director.
</P>
<P>
   ``Leave it to lawyers to come up with all these situations,'' he
said. ``It's creepy. I don't think anyone could even speculate in
their wildest dreams that this could come about.''

CHENEY CONTENDS THAT CLINTON HAS HANDLED MILITARY POORLY

 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Dick Cheney, the Republican vice presidential
candidate and former defense secretary, delivered a harsh
assessment Wednesday of the condition of the armed forces under
President Clinton, accusing him of ``running down'' a military that
has succeeded in recent conflicts only because of the military
buildup of past Republican administrations.
</P>
<P>
   Cheney said the American military was stretched over too many
foreign theaters and hampered by low morale, low pay, inadequate
training and unreliable weapons and equipment. He accused Clinton,
and by association Vice President Al Gore, of neglecting the
national defense to the point where military planners were no
longer certain that the United States could meet its stated goals
of being prepared to fight two medium-sized conflicts at the same
time.
</P>
<P>
   ``Decisions made today shape the forces of tomorrow,'' he told
an audience of several hundred veterans and political supporters in
a hotel ballroom here. ``That is why we were able to win the Gulf
War _ because we were commanding a military that had been rebuilt
in the 1980s.
</P>
<P>
   ``And that is why the current administration has been able to
conduct its vast deployments, from Baghdad to Belgrade. The ships
and planes were ready. The pilots and crewmen were prepared. The
missiles, the ammunition, the equipment and the men and women to
use them were all there. That is the military they inherited. The
question today is what future presidents will inherit.''
</P>
<P>
   Defense analysts acknowledged several of Cheney's arguments, but
cautioned that he exaggerated some of the criticisms and ignored
positive trends in the military under the Clinton administration.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are a lot valid points in the speech _ things aren't
quite as good as they were under Cheney,'' said Michael O'Hanlon, a
defense policy specialist at the Brookings Institution in
Washington. ``But he greatly overstates the case.''
</P>
<P>
   Cheney's appearance, which was scheduled only in recent days,
seemed to signal a shift in tactics in the Bush campaign. Cheney's
aides had said he would spend the week talking about education. But
after more than a week in which the Bush campaign found itself
defending its policies on tax and health care, Cheney returned to
more familiar Republican ground with an appeal on national
security.
</P>
<P>
   In doing so, Cheney also seemed to be trying to play the role
that Republicans had hoped he would take in the campaign _ lending
his age, experience and authority as a former defense secretary to
Gov. George W. Bush of Texas, the Republican presidential nominee.
Indeed, Cheney not only framed his remarks as the words of the
defense secretary who helped defeat Iraq, but portrayed himself as
a man who had returned to public life in large part because of his
desire to repair the damage he said had been done to the military.
</P>
<P>
   Cheney offered few concrete proposals in his speech Wednesday.
But in the past the Bush campaign has called for a $20 billion
increase in the military budget for research and development from
2002 through 2006, for directing the Defense Department to spend a
fifth of its procurement budget on new technologies and for
increasing the recently enacted pay raise for members of the armed
services by $1 billion more a year.
</P>
<P>
   In his speech, Cheney also sought to counter the Democratic
response to the criticism directed by Bush at President Clinton's
military policies. Since those attacks began in recent weeks, Gore
and his running mate, Sen. Joseph Lieberman of Connecticut, accused
Bush and Cheney of denigrating the American military, which they
said sent a bad signal to allies and potential adversaries.
</P>
<P>
   ``To point out that our military has been overextended, taken
for granted, and neglected _ that is no criticism of the
military,'' Cheney said Wednesday. ``That is a criticism of a
president and a vice president, and the record they have built
together.''
</P>
<P>
   Cheney said that Gore had expressed concerns that criticism
about the military would send the wrong message to potential
adversaries, and he used it to make another dig at the Clinton
administration. ``If our potential adversaries have received any
`wrong messages' recently,'' he said, ``it was not from the
newspapers, but from the nuclear lab at Los Alamos. And what lesson
do they draw from the fact that this administration has failed to
safeguard our nation's most vital national secrets?''
</P>
<P>
   Cheney attributed the Clinton administration's recent military
successes, like the NATO bombing that led to the withdrawal of of
Serb forces from Kosovo and the air strikes on Iraq, to the
military build-up under Presidents Ronald Reagan and George Bush.
And he said that the Republicans in Congress deserved the credit
for recent increases in the defense budget.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   While many of the examples Cheney cited echoed his past remarks
_ that fewer units are ready for combat, recruitment is down, aging
equipment poses a danger and low pay is damaging morale _ he cast
his criticisms in a much more partisan light.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is the record of eight years of stewardship over the
American armed forces by President Clinton and Vice President
Gore,'' he said. ``Eight years of neglect and misplaced priorities.
Eight years of multiplying missions and unclear goals. Eight years
during which the enemies of freedom have not been idle. Eight years
is a long time _ and eight years is long enough.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our military today is overused and under-resourced,'' he said.
``All this has brought on serious problems of readiness,
recruiting, retention and morale.''
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   O'Hanlon, the Brookings Institution analyst, criticized Cheney
for not proposing a specific alternative for overseas commitments
or enlarging the military. ``As much as Cheney says we've
overdeployed and overcut, there's been no proposal by the campaign
to reverse either of those policies,'' O'Hanlon said. ``The idea
they'll review U.S. commitments and find any big cutbacks is
illusory.''
</P>
<P>
   A former national security budget specialist under Clinton,
Gordon Adams, said many of the problems Cheney cited, including
substandard military housing, was prevalent during the Bush
administration.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's selectively culled barnicles of the readiness issue, but
many are out of context,'' said Adams, who now directs the security
policy studies program at George Washington University. ``This is
not neglect, I'm sorry.''
</P>
<P>
   Adams also said the former defense secretary was not giving the
military enough credit.
</P>
<P>
   ``When called upon, this force has performed spectacularly
well,'' Adams said. ``He fails to note the question of readiness
for what? To the rest of the world, the U.S. military isn't just
the toughest kid on the block, it's the toughest by far.''
</P>
<P>
   A spokesman for the Gore campaign echoed the criticism. ``By
twisting facts about our military for partisan gain, Governor Bush
has demonstrated that he is not ready to be America's
commander-in-chief,'' said the spokesman, Douglas Hattaway. ``Our
military is the strongest, most capable, most ready fighting force
in the world.''
</P>
<P>
   Pentagon officials have countered Cheney's assertion that morale
is declining, citing improvements in the number of troops
re-enlisting, which they attribute to two years of increases in pay
and benefits. They have also pointed to improvements this year in
recruiting, although reserve recruiting has declined and there has
been a shortage in commissioned officers, with a drastic increase
in the number of captains leaving the Army.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Cheney offered few concrete proposals to bolster the nation's
military in his speech although he did say that a Bush-Cheney
administration would spend more money researching new technologies
and deploying missile defenses, that it would raise pay for the
troops and improve their housing and schools.
</P>
<P>
   To underscore the importance of what aides billed as a major
policy speech, Cheney's aides encouraged reporters to interview
another Gulf War colleague of Cheney's _ Colin Powell, the retired
general who led the joint chiefs of staff. ``I share his view,''
Powell said in a telephone interview. ``We still have a great
force, and I don't think anybody would say we don't. But we owe
them everything they need to get the jobs done.''
</P>
<P>
   And Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., released a statement in support
of the speech. ``Congress deserves a share of the blame for this
problem for annually treating the defense budget as just another
pork barrel,'' he said. ``But the lion's share of our failure
belongs rightfully to the man honored to serve as
commander-in-chief.''
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps Cheney's most pointed dig at the opposition came when he
quoted an ``observer of the military'' in his speech. ``One
observer of the military,'' he said. ``had this to say last year:
`Our military faces readiness problems,' he cautioned, `including
falling recruitment, and retention in critical skill areas; aging
equipment that costs more to keep operating at acceptable levels of
reliability; a need for more support services for a force with a
high percentage of married personnel; and frequent deployments.'''
</P>
<P>
   ``That is a fair summary of the problem,'' Cheney said, ``and it
came from Senator Joseph Lieberman.''

MARKET PLACE: WHIRLPOOL LOWERS FORECAST, REFLECTING INDUSTRY
ANXIETY

<P>
   CHICAGO _ Whirlpool, the nation's largest maker of home
appliances, on Wednesday warned that its profit would be sharply
lower than expected in the second half of the year, partly because
of Circuit City's decision to stop selling major appliances at its
retail outlets.
</P>
<P>
   Whirlpool also blamed an industrywide slowdown and fierce price
competition that is cutting into profit margins. A large part of
the downturn in the home appliance market is being attributed to
slumping retail sales and a weakening housing market in the United
States, where higher interest rates have cooled consumer buying.
</P>
<P>
   Whirlpool reduced its profit estimates by as much as 37 percent
for the third quarter and 25 percent for the second half. A week
ago, Wall Street was projecting profits of $7 a diluted share this
year, according to First Call/Thomson Financial. Now, analysts are
expecting profits of about $5.58 a share.
</P>
<P>
   The analysts said that five weeks ago, when Circuit City made
its announcement, Whirlpool played down the news, so few on Wall
Street expected such a sharp cut in the earnings forecasts.
</P>
<P>
   ``They caught everybody by surprise today,'' said Justin Maurer,
an analyst at Merrill Lynch. ``I took my number down to $6.25, but
obviously it wasn't enough.''
</P>
<P>
   Whirlpool closed unchanged, at $37.88, in heavy trading on the
New York Stock Exchange, though at one point in Wednesday's session
it had been off as much as $6.61. But the stock has been hammered
in recent weeks and is near an eight-year low on concern that the
company's prospects are declining.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, the Whirlpool announcement was just the latest blow to
an industry that has been jolted by a weakening housing market and
changes in the retailing market that have Circuit City quitting the
business and Wal-Mart Stores selling major appliances in a low-cost
format. The stock of Maytag has plummeted more than 40 percent the
last year because of two profit warnings partly caused by a
slowdown in the sale of its lower-priced models. With the industry
under pressure, Electrolux, the giant Swedish appliance maker, has
recently been talking with Maytag about a possible merger.
</P>
<P>
   The industry has also been shaken by changes in the retail
market and developments with the Internet. GE Appliances, a unit of
the General Electric, has made deals with Home Depot and Wal-Mart
to ship its inventory directly to homes. The customers, though,
would order at a retailer's kiosk or Web site.
</P>
<P>
   General Electric is creating a system that would allow it to
sell through big retailers but handle all the inventory and
shipping to the customer itself. This week, Lloyd D. Ward, the
chief executive at Maytag, said it was also considering
distributing its products through GE.
</P>
<P>
   ``The traditional model has changed overnight,'' said Terry
Dunn, a spokesman at GE Appliances. ``A retailer doesn't need
trucks, systems and warehouses to be in the appliance business.''
</P>
<P>
   Wall Street analysts say distribution is a major factor in the
pessimism surrounding Whirlpool's stock. Some of that pessimism was
aroused on Monday, after Nicholas P. Heymann, an analyst at
Prudential Securities, issued a bearish forecast on Whirlpool's
prospect with a rare ``sell'' rating on the stock.
</P>
<P>
   Heymann said that Whirlpool's profit outlook was dim over the
next few years and that the stock could fall to as low as $25 a
share because companies like GE were changing the industry's
dynamics.
</P>
<P>
   In a conference call with Wall Street analysts, however,
Whirlpool officials denounced Heymann's report as misguided and
``lacking credibility.'' They said the company's own studies had
found that consumers were not changing their buying habits and
still wanted what would, in effect, be full-service offerings from
retailers.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is pure speculation about where business will be done,''
said David R. Whitwam, chief executive at Whirlpool, based in
Benton Harbor, Mich. ``And if people want to buy in different
formats in the future, we'll be there.''
</P>
<P>
   Whirlpool also said that its own retail distribution setup had
``similar capabilities'' and was ``competitive'' with that of GE.
</P>
<P>
   Company officials also told analysts that the market's valuing
of Whirlpool was ``illogical,'' particularly because the company
expects business to recover in the fourth quarter with profits
expected to grow about 15 percent in 2001.
</P>
<P>
   In the meantime, Whirlpool plans to step up a stock buyback that
until recently had repurchased millions of shares at an average of
$55 a share.
</P>
<P>
   Company officials also said the industry's price war was
``irrational'' and could have a longer-term impact but that Circuit
City's decision to leave the business would only have a short-term
effect. Circuit City did about 5 percent of the nation's retail
appliance business, Whirlpool said.
</P>
<P>
   Whirlpool said its own studies suggested that customers would
move to Sears, Best Buy, Lowe's and other outlets, where Whirlpool
was a dominant player with its brands that include Whirlpool, Roper
and KitchenAid. And company executives say they would not compete
simply on price.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have products no one can match,'' Whitwam said. ``Price is
not the first purchase criteria for most of our customers.'' &QL;

 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)   &HT;    Jewish group says prayer efforts show insensitivity
 &HT;    
 &HT;    
 &HT;    
 &HT;    By KEVIN MORAN
 &HT;    c. 2000 Houston Chronicle
<TEXT>
<P>
   SANTA FE _ Efforts promoting Christian prayer in the stands at
Santa Fe's public school football stadium are insensitive to
religious minorities, Jewish Anti-Defamation League officials said
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``This effort undermines the Supreme Court's efforts to protect
the religious liberties of all students,'' league spokeswoman Dena
Marks of Houston said.
</P>
<P>
   The Ministerial Alliance of Santa Fe and Hitchcock announced
Tuesday that area Christian pastors would be urging their
congregants and others to begin reciting the Lord's Prayer after
the national anthem is played before Friday's season-opening game
between the Santa Fe Indians and the Hitchcock Bulldogs.
</P>
<P>
   In June, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled that the Santa Fe
Independent School District could not allow student-led prayer over
the public address systems at football games.
</P>
<P>
   Besides pastors of about 30 area churches, a Temple-based group
called No Pray, No Play has been urging Christians across the state
to descend on Santa Fe's new high school stadium Friday to join in
the what is being called a ``spontaneous'' prayer effort.
</P>
<P>
   No one person is expected to lead the prayer and the organizers
have said they will not use a public address system. Organizers
predicted that as many as 10,000 people, in addition to the nearly
5,000 the stadium holds, will be on hand.
</P>
<P>
   The No Pray, No Play group is urging people to park as close to
the stadium as possible. ``We will pack in around the stadium,''
the group said on its Web site.
</P>
<P>
   Anti-Defamation League leaders maintain that No Pray, No Play
and other stadium prayer organizers' claims of sensitivity to
non-Christians have a hollow ring. Christian organizers had
suggested that anyone who didn't want to hear the prayer could come
late to the ballgame.
</P>
<P>
   ``Even if the group's efforts were to pass constitutional
muster, its highly publicized efforts to engage in religious
worship are likely to cause members of minority faiths to feel
coerced and vulnerable at a place where everyone should feel
welcome,'' Marks said.
</P>
<P>
   Alex Yovan, pastor of Santa Fe's Maranatha Christian Center,
said those who want to pray at the game have no intention of
hurting anyone's feelings.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm a Vietnam veteran and Vietnam veterans fought for the
minorities,'' Yovan said. ``And we don't want to step on anyone's
religious rights whether they're in the majority or the minority.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Whether you're in the minority or the majority, I think we
ought to be allowed to worship God or to pray anywhere we want to,
in school, out of school, in church or out of church,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   No Pray, No Play director Kody Shed was unavailable for comment
Wednesday on whether he had secured a site for a proposed prayer
rally after the prayer recitation.
</P>
<P>
   But on the group's Web site Wednesday, Shed told visitors that
``a main stage will be set up near the stadium (off government
property) for a post-game celebration to include live music. Local
pastors will be given the opportunity to lead the army of prayer
warriors in intercession for the town, our state and our nation.''
</P>
<P>
   Santa Fe Police Chief Barry Cook said his department had not
been notified Wednesday of the time or location of any gathering
aside from the one at which people are expected to pray before
kickoff.
</P>
<P>
   Opponents of traditionally Christian prayer at public school
football stadiums in Santa Fe and other Texas cities have argued
that such prayer violates the principle of separation of church and
state. They also maintain that non-Christians in tax-supported,
publicly owned stadiums should not be subjected to Christian
prayer.
</P>
<P>
   Organizers of Friday's planned prayer in the stands said they do
not intend to offend anyone but they are not willing to forgo the
decades-old tradition of praying at public school football games.
</P>
<P>
   If members of non-Christian religions are offended by the
stadium prayer, Yovan said he would respond: ``We apologize that we
made you uncomfortable, but we also have rights.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We love people _ whether Mormons or Jews or gentiles or
Buddhists,'' Yovan said. ``I have nothing bad to say about them.
</P>
<P>
   ``All I want them to do at this point is to allow me to pray the
prayers I want to pray, if it's in private or in public.''

BUSH ADVISERS AND NETWORKS GATHER TO DISCUSS THE DEBATES 
</HEADLINE>
   By FRANK BRUNI   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Senior advisers to Gov. George W. Bush met here
Wednesday with representatives from three television networks to
discuss presidential debates that individual networks have
proposed.
</P>
<P>
   Bush has said that he will participate in three debates and that
he wants those debates to be watched by as many television viewers
as possible. But he has not agreed to the three debates proposed by
the Commission on Presidential Debates, which are by far the most
likely to garner prime-time coverage by all the major networks as
opposed to an individual network sponsor.
</P>
<P>
   The commission, an independent, bipartisan group that consults
with all of the networks on acceptable dates and times for debates
before proposing its schedule, has sponsored all of the
general-election presidential debates starting with the 1988
campaign.
</P>
<P>
   If Bush instead chooses one or more debates sponsored by
individual networks, there is a strong likelihood that networks
other than the one sponsoring the debate would not televise it, and
that the audience for the event would be diminished.
</P>
<P>
   Bush's aides said that was not their aim, and that it was one of
the factors they were weighing and discussing with network
executives. A trio of Bush's senior advisers met Wednesday with
representatives from CNN, ABC and CBS, and these advisers were
scheduled to meet on Thursday with representatives from Fox, NBC
and PBS, said Ari Fleischer, a Bush spokesman.
</P>
<P>
   ``The governor believes the debates should be seen as widely as
possible,'' Fleischer said, echoing comments that Bush made on
Tuesday as he tried to beat back news reports that he might be
casting around for formats that would not be as prominently
broadcast.
</P>
<P>
   But by not yet agreeing to the commission's debates and publicly
entertaining other options, Bush has opened himself to accusations
by aides to Vice President Al Gore that he is trying to minimize
the impact of the debates or contrive formats tailor-made to his
preferences and strengths.
</P>
<P>
   ``He says he wants a big audience, so it's a mystery why he
wouldn't accept the commission debates,'' said Douglas Hattaway, a
spokesman for the Gore campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Gore has essentially signed off on the commission debates and
accepted invitations to 42 others, a number that is almost
unimaginable from a logistical standpoint and clearly intended to
provide a contrast to Bush's response and paint the Texas governor
as timid.
</P>
<P>
   Bush's aides said they simply believed that the two major
party's nominees should have some say over the shape of the debates
and were trying to exert that privilege.
</P>
<P>
   Several political strategists said that Bush might have an
enormous public-relations problem if he did not consent to all or
at least two of the commission's debates.
</P>
<P>
   They also said that his advisers' activities this week might be
nothing more than a way of playing hard-to-get and gaining some
leverage with the commission over certain details of its proposed
debates. Bush's advisers are to meet here with members of the
commission on Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Bush's remarks in recent days, and the comments of several of
his aides, suggest that he prefers informal formats to formal ones.
Officials with the Bush campaign have also questioned the
neutrality of one of the commission's proposed debate sites, a
building in Boston near the John F. Kennedy Library.
</P>
<P>
   Asked whether that site could be changed in negotiations, Janet
Brown, the executive director of the commission, indicated profound
reluctance but did not flatly rule it out.
</P>
<P>
   ``The venues and the dates have been in the works for 18 months,
and we've done a lot of groundwork,'' Brown said. ``There's never
been an objection to one of our sites on the merits, and I think
that all of the sites we have for 2000 are very good.''

MP3.COM STRATEGY REJECTED AT COPYRIGHT TRIAL 
</HEADLINE>
   By AMY HARMON   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ A federal judge on Wednesday rejected the argument of
an online music start-up that Universal Music Group is improperly
pursuing a copyright infringement claim against the company as a
means of driving a potential competitor out of business.
</P>
<P>
   During testimony by Edgar M. Bronfman Jr., the chief of
Universal's parent, the Seagram Co., Judge Jed S. Rakoff of federal
district court in Manhattan, ruled as irrelevant MP3.com's
contention that Universal would not settle the suit because of its
own online strategy.
</P>
<P>
   At issue in the trial is whether MP3.com willfully disregarded
copyright law when it created an online database that included
about 5,000 of the Universal recordings. Rakoff ruled in April that
MP3.com had violated copyrights held by the five major record
labels with the creation of a service called My.MP3.com. All of the
companies except Universal have since reach settlements with
MP3.com that allow their music to be used in the service for an
undisclosed sum. The other companies are Sony Music, Time Warner,
the EMI Group and Bertelsmann A.G.
</P>
<P>
   If the judge finds that MP3.com willfully violated the law, he
could set damages as high as $150,000 per compact disc. If he finds
that the violation was not willful, damages could be as low as
$200.
</P>
<P>
   My.MP3.com allows users to store music centrally on MP3.com's
computers and get access to it through devices like portable music
players or a personal computer. Rather than requiring users to load
their own music into an online locker, which can be a
time-consuming process, My.MP3.com allowed them to simply insert a
CD into the CD-ROM drive of a computer. Once MP3.com's software
verified that the person had possession of a CD, the company gave
the user access to the music stored on its own computers.
</P>
<P>
   MP3.com in May suspended the My.MP3.com service, which it said
had roughly 500,000 participants and about 80,000 CDs.
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday, MP3.com called Bronfman as a hostile witness and
tried to use his testimony to suggest that Universal had an
anticompetitive motive for refusing settlement. Michael Carlinsky,
one of MP3.com's lawyers, asked Bronfman about remarks he had made
comparing MP3.com with Jimmy and Doug's Farmclub, a Web site for
unsigned artists that Universal introduced last year.
</P>
<P>
   ``Did MP3.com's market valuation bother you?'' Carlinsky asked.
</P>
<P>
   ``No, it excited me,'' Bronfman replied.
</P>
<P>
   Carlinsky also asked Bronfman about a speech in which he
described the My.MP3.com service along with two other Web music
sites, Napster and Gnutella, as ``exemplars of theft, of piracy, of
the illegal and willful appropriation of someone else's property.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Do you think there was a willful disregard for the law?''
Carlinksy asked.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you're asking me, do I think someone accidentally purchased
80,000 CDs,'' Bronfman replied.
</P>
<P>
   But after about an hour of back-and-forth, Rakoff dismissed
Bronfman, calling the question of motive irrelevant.
</P>
<P>
   ``No one is obliged to settle a lawsuit,'' the judge said,
adding that he would not allow ``a misuse of a court proceeding for
the airing of hard feelings that understandably exist between the
defendant and the remaining plaintiffs.''

TOP EXECUTIVE LEAVING MORGAN STANLEY 
</HEADLINE>
  By PATRICK McGEEHAN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Peter F. Karches, a top executive of Morgan Stanley
Dean Witter &AMP; Co. and one of its biggest individual shareholders,
has resigned as head of its businesses that cater to institutional
customers.
</P>
<P>
   Morgan Stanley said that John J. Mack, the president and chief
operating officer, would take on Karches' responsibilities. Stephan
F. Newhouse, who has been deputy to Karches, will remain in that
position, reporting to Mack, said Ray O'Rourke, a spokesman for the
firm.
</P>
<P>
   All of Morgan Stanley's investment banking and stock and bond
sales and trading operations report to Mack, the firm's No. 2
executive under Philip J. Purcell, the chairman and chief
executive.
</P>
<P>
   Karches, 48, a horse-racing enthusiast who owns thoroughbreds,
is leaving to ``focus my attention on some other goals and
priorities,'' he said in a statement. He had been taking a less
active role in daily operations, people at the firm said.
</P>
<P>
   He has also kept a low public profile after a regulator found
that the industry's rules on political campaign finance were
violated when Karches made a $1,000 contribution to the Senate
campaign of William F. Weld, then the governor of Massachusetts.
Morgan Stanley was subsequently barred from the municipal finance
business in Massachusetts for two years.
</P>
<P>
   Karches, who was not available for comment, has accumulated a
large stake in the firm since he joined it 24 years ago after
graduating from Columbia Business School. He was the first person
hired directly out of business school by the Morgan Stanley bond
sales and trading business, O'Rourke said.
</P>
<P>
   According to the firm's latest proxy statement, filed in
January, Karches owned about 4.5 million shares of the firm's
stock. That stake would be worth about $475 million.

 &HT;    PORT RESIDENTS HOPE VISIT REVIVES TOURISM
 &HT;    
 &HT;    
 &HT;    
 &HT;    By JOHN R. OTIS
 &HT;    c. 2000 Houston Chronicle
<TEXT>
<P>
   CARTAGENA, Colombia _ Although President Clinton pledged to
support Colombia's fight against drug traffickers, Marxist rebels
and right-wing paramilitaries, residents of this Caribbean port
city seemed far more concerned about tourists Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, they were counting on the hoopla surrounding Clinton's
nine-hour visit to attract thousands of newcomers to Cartagena,
Colombia's most popular tourist destination.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's important for the city's image. All over the world,
people will see Cartagena and realize that it is a secure city,''
said Carlos Angulo, a real estate agent who has lived here all his
life.
</P>
<P>
   Due to a long-running civil war, drug-related violence, and the
highest kidnapping rate in the world, Colombia's tourist industry
is suffering.
</P>
<P>
   Just 841,000 international tourists ventured to Colombia last
year, down from 1.4 million in 1995. Even communist Cuba, which is
officially off-limits to most U.S. visitors, has a more robust
tourist trade.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. State Department has warned tourists against traveling
to Colombia.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a greater risk of being kidnapped in Colombia than in
any other country in the world. ... Acts of violence against
foreigners have occurred in all regions of Colombia, both urban and
rural,'' a State Department travel advisory says.
</P>
<P>
   But civic leaders here point out that Cartagena is one of the
safest destinations in the Caribbean and is more secure than many
U.S. cities. They are lobbying Washington to exclude Colombia from
the travel advisory, which carries great weight in the tourism
industry.
</P>
<P>
   ``In order to reactivate tourism, the State Department must
modify its travel warning regarding Cartagena,'' said an editorial
Wednesday in the daily El Universal.
</P>
<P>
   A walled Spanish colonial port, Cartagena is packed with
fortresses, mansions, churches, monasteries, and plazas. It has
served as the setting for novels, paintings, and movies and is a
favorite spot for honeymooners.
</P>
<P>
   Nobel-prize-winning novelist Gabriel Garcia Marquez has a house
here while Cartagena also serves as a vacation retreat for
Colombia's presidents.
</P>
<P>
   A decade ago, President Bush visited Cartagena for an anti-drug
summit, while President Kennedy stopped here in the early 1960s to
promote his ``Alliance for Progress,'' a massive social program for
Latin America.
</P>
<P>
   To prepare for Clinton's visit, city hall workers embarked a
series of small-scale social programs. They paved streets, fixed
pot holes, painted buildings and walls and removed homeless people
from the historic city center.
</P>
<P>
   Across the street from a community justice center in a poor
Cartagena neighborhood toured by Clinton, workers tore down the
shanty of 85-year-old Antonia Sarmiento because it was deemed an
eyesore. They are now building her a new cinderblock house.
</P>
<P>
   Some believe that the urban renewal has gone overboard and said
the American president ought to have seen Cartagena, warts and all.
</P>
<P>
   ``Why are they trying to get rid of everything that is ugly?''
said Sonia Penalosa (TILDE OVER N in Penalosa) an unemployed
Cartagena resident. ``They should show (Clinton) the poor parts.
There is so much poverty here in Colombia.''

   A NAME AND A DATE FOR SONY'S NEW PDA
</P>
<P>
   After almost a year of dribbling out bits and bytes of
information about a collaboration with Palm Inc., Sony announced
this week that its sleek, new personal digital assistant would go
on sale next month. And the device, which will have
lithium-rechargeable batteries and a gray-scale display (color is
in the works), finally has a name: CLIE (pronounced KLEE-ay).
Advance orders can be placed at www.sony.com/clie. CLIE is an
acronym, for communication, link, information and entertainment.
</P>
<P>
   Using the Palm operating system licensed from Palm Inc., the
CLIE features applications commonly found on Palms, like electronic
address books, calendars, to-do lists and easy synchronization with
personal computers and laptops.
</P>
<P>
   But the CLIE's designers say they have tweaked the Palm system
to add functions. For instance, the device can store and play back
short video clips and can place names with pictures of faces in its
address book.
</P>
<P>
   Many of the CLIE's distinctive features are made possible
because of Memory Sticks, Sony's solid-state removable storage
medium. A stick may be inserted into a slot on top of the slender
(five-eighths of an inch) device. The device comes with 8 megabytes
of internal memory, more than most Palms, and an 8-megabyte Memory
Stick. Additional Memory Sticks for the CLIE come in 16, 32 and 64
megabytes, with a 128-megabyte version scheduled for release, Sony
executives said. Functions that may soon be added to the CLIE
through special Memory Stick expansion modules include a camera, a
Global Positioning System tracker and a voice recorder.
</P>
<P>
   ``With the CLIE handheld,'' said Russell Paik, vice president
for handheld marketing at Sony Electronics, ``Sony is continuing to
pioneer the integration of entertainment with clever, functional
and elegant electronics devices.''
</P>
<P>
   MICE FOR THE TOUCHY-FEELY AND FOR THE SHORT OF SPACE
</P>
<P>
   Consumers make lots of choices about the computer itself _ how
fast, how much storage, how much RAM _ but a mouse is taken for
granted as just part of the package. You have to have a really good
reason to change the default mouse.
</P>
<P>
   Two new optical mice from the manufacturers Logitech and Targus,
trying to stand out from the crowd. Optical mice replace the rubber
roller ball with light sensors that bounce off any surface and
pinpoint the position of the mouse. Since there are no moving
parts, it doesn't get clogged with dust or get pitted like the
roller ball mice.
</P>
<P>
   Logitech has added force feedback to its new iFeel mouse. Force
feedback is an old concept to computer gamers, but this is a newer
addition to a mouse for the general public. For example, in a
flight simulation game, when you bank left, a signal is sent to the
joystick activating a motor that simulates the effect of resistance
to executing the turn that you'd feel in a real plane. Just about
everybody uses the technology called TouchSense developed by
Immersion Corp.
</P>
<P>
   With the iFeel mouse, the same principle is applied when the
mouse moves over menu items in any Windows program or hyperlinks on
a Web site. Logitech also used Immersion technology. Depending on
which of Immersion's options you use, you get a different sensation
when you move the mouse over different objects on the screen. It
could be a vibration or even a tone. Once the software for the
iFeel mouse is loaded, all Windows programs and all Web sites will
provide feedback.
</P>
<P>
   The question, of course, is why does anyone need a mouse that
shakes, rattles and rolls? Bruce Schena, vice president and chief
technology officer of Immersion, said: ``It's the missing element
in how we interact with our computers. We have the visual and
auditory component and now we're adding the tactile.'' There are
two versions of the Logitech iFeel mouse, the MouseMan ($59) and
the Mouse ($39).
</P>
<P>
   Targus, on the other hand, is aiming its new optical mouse at
mobile professionals and those with cramped computing space. Anyone
who has tried to use a laptop on a plane knows that there is barely
room for the computer on the tray, let alone an external mouse.
Targus' Mini-Mouse ($49.99) is half the size of the standard mouse.
The USB mouse comes with a converter that allows older laptops
without a USB port to use the mouse (although the computer must run
Windows 98 or higher).
</P>
<P>
   PROGRAM RAISES THE SPECTER OF VIRUSES ATTACKING PDA'S
</P>
<P>
   The first malicious program to attack a Palm organizer appeared
on the Internet this week, causing no permanent damage but leading
security experts to warn that more harmful incursions are probably
around the corner.
</P>
<P>
   The program, known as Liberty Crack, is a not a virus because it
does not automatically replicate. For that reason, most experts
believe that it is already nearly extinct.
</P>
<P>
   Still, said David Perry, public education director for Trend
Micro, a security company, the program represents a milestone.
``This is the first time in history that someone has written a
piece of malicious software to affect a Palm Pilot.'' The program
was a Trojan horse, designed to trick users into thinking it was a
piece of code that would override the copyright restrictions on
Liberty, a program that lets people play Gameboy games on the Palm.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, the program was designed to delete any software that
had been previously downloaded to the Palm, like maps, games and
city guides. Programs that came loaded with the Palm, like the
address book, were not supposed to be affected.
</P>
<P>
   The first warnings about the Trojan horse came from the author
himself, Aaron Ardiri, a software programmer in Sweden who develops
applications for the Palm.
</P>
<P>
   In an e-mail interview, Ardiri said he had never intended the
program for distribution. He wrote it as a piece of code that would
help clean out the Palm when it was reset. He named it ``test'' and
passed it on to a couple of friends via Internet Relay Chat. Only
later, he said, did he find out that it had been renamed as a crack
program for Liberty, a program that he himself created. ``I have
tried to do anything and everything to prevent its spread and
`infection,''' Ardiri wrote. He also told Internet security
companies about the program.
</P>
<P>
   So far, no one has reported being victimized by the Trojan
horse, Perry said. ``I consider the case closed,'' he said. But it
may not be long, he added, before similar programs are unleashed as
replicating programs, wreaking much more havoc on personal digital
assistants.
</P>
<P>
   ``This opens the door for more development of PDA-malicious
software,'' he said, ``particularly viruses.''

   CALIFORNIA JUDGE RULES MICROSOFT CASE CAN GO ON
</P>
<P>
   A California Superior Court judge in San Francisco has allowed
the first class-action suit to proceed against Microsoft Corp.
based on allegations that the software company used its monopoly to
harm California consumers. Many similar suits have been filed
across the country since Judge Thomas Penfield Jackson of U.S.
District Court in Washington ruled that the company had violated
federal antitrust laws. In the California case, Superior Court
Judge Stuart R. Pollak said an unspecified number of California
consumers could be represented in one trial to determine whether
they were forced to pay unreasonably high prices for Microsoft
Windows, Word and other products. Microsoft said it was reviewing
the ruling. No trial date has been set.

   DRKOOP.COM CUTS STAFF BY A THIRD
</P>
<P>
   Drkoop.com, the struggling health information Web site, plans to
cut its work force by 33 percent, bringing the number of employees
down to 80. The cuts are being implemented by the group of
investors who last week provided the company with a much needed
$27.5 million cash infusion. Drkoop.com laid off 35 percent of its
staff in May. ``Drkoop's tremendous sales and marketing expenses,
coupled with the lack of success they've had in getting a
significant revenue stream from advertisers has led them to this
point,'' said Rachel Terrace, a health analyst with Jupiter
Communications. ``When the investors took over, they said they
wanted to start running drkoop like a business, and their first
order of business, to lay off employees, is not surprising.''
</P>
<P>
   ONLINE RETAILERS CUTTING SOME COSTS
</P>
<P>
   Reflecting a shift from costly television ads to less expensive
online advertising and marketing, per-customer acquisition costs
for online retailers declined to $40 in the second quarter of this
year, from a high of $71 in the fourth quarter of 1999, a new
survey says. The a survey of 66 North American online retailers,
conducted by Boston Consulting Group and Shop.org, a trade
association for Internet retailers, also found, however, that
acquisition costs were higher in the second quarter than the $35
per customer found in the third quarter of 1999, when the survey
was first conducted. Conversion rates _ the proportion of online
customer visits that turn into actual orders, as well as the rate
of repeat customers, improved slightly, according to the study.
``These key economic factors are all marginally up, but in
aggregate they'll have a significant impact for online retailers as
they try to achieve profitability,'' said James Vogtle, the
director of e-commerce research at Boston Consulting.

 &HT;    Colombia gets pledge of support
 &HT;    Clinton aims to stay out of shooting war &HT;    By JOHN OTIS
 &HT;    c. 2000 Houston Chronicle
<TEXT>
<P>
   CARTAGENA, Colombia _ Amid tight security and violent protests,
President Clinton Wednesday pledged lasting support for Colombia's
fight against drug traffickers but insisted that U.S. troops would
not be drawn into a Vietnam-style quagmire.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are not going to get into a shooting war. This is not
Vietnam,`` Clinton said at a news conference mid-way through his
half-day visit to this port city on Colombia's Caribbean coast.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's trip came just two months after the U.S. Congress
approved a $1.3 billion aid package to fight drug trafficking in
the Andean nations.
</P>
<P>
   The bulk of the aid consists of 60 helicopters and training for
three anti-narcotics army battalions that will push into
guerrilla-controlled, drug-producing zones in southern Colombia.
</P>
<P>
   Critics warn that the aid may be the first step toward direct
U.S. intervention in this nation's 36-year war involving the army,
leftist guerrillas and right-wing paramilitaries. Colombian
President Andres Pastrana, who also spoke at the news conference,
rejected the prospect of a larger U.S. role in the war.
</P>
<P>
   ``As long as Andres Pastrana is president of Colombia, there
will be no foreign intervention,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the official good will, Clinton's visit was marred by a
bomb scare and deadly protests.
</P>
<P>
   Thousands of students and workers clashed with police Wednesday
and burned effigies of Clinton and Pastrana outside the U.S.
Embassy in the capital city of Bogota. Some shouted ``Yankee, Go
Home!'' and ``Imperialism Out Of Colombia.'' They claimed that the
U.S. aid package would widen the civil war and doom ongoing peace
talks with the guerrillas.
</P>
<P>
   Elsewhere, an 18-year-old policeman was killed by a homemade
bomb during clashes with students at the main gates of Bogota's
National University. ``An explosive fell on the policeman's head
and killed him,'' police Col. Pedro Antonio Molano said.
</P>
<P>
   In Cartagena, police arrested two alleged Marxist rebels as they
were setting up a 4.4 pound bomb about 400 yards from a building
Clinton visited later in the day.
</P>
<P>
   A senior police source said the men were captured in a house in
Cartagena's working-class neighborhood as they hooked up a
detonator to the device packed with dynamite. The source said the
bomb was designed to ``cause panic but not huge damage.''
</P>
<P>
   Also found at the site were hundreds of pamphlets protesting
U.S. intervention in Colombia and signed by the Revolutionary Armed
Forces of Colombia, the nation's largest guerrilla group known as
the FARC.
</P>
<P>
   Still, many Colombians seemed pleased with Clinton's visit.
Residents lined the streets of Cartagena and waved tiny Colombian
flags as they waited for the presidential motorcade to pass by.
</P>
<P>
   What's more, Clinton's trip focused on the least-controversial
aspects of the U.S. aid package, which includes millions of dollars
for drug interdiction operations and support for human rights and
justice programs in Colombia.
</P>
<P>
   After greeting Pastrana and his family at Cartagena's
international airport Wednesday morning, Clinton toured the Port of
Cartagena, where Colombian police and customs agents explained how
they had intercepted tons of cocaine bound for Europe and the
United States during recent operations.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton spent a moment petting a drug-sniffing dog, then greeted
11 widows of police officers slain in the fight against drug
traffickers and guerrillas.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton also visited a U.S.-funded neighborhood justice center
designed to provide communities with fast and effective judicial
services. He greeted onlookers with hugs and handshakes and was
serenaded by a band playing vallenato, a type of Colombian folk
music.
</P>
<P>
   The trip was the first by a U.S. president to Colombia since
George Bush arrived here 10 years ago for an anti-drug summit. As a
result, it was a stark reminder that past U.S. policies have failed
to stem the flow of narcotics out of Colombia.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the dismantling of the Medellin and Cali cartels in the
1990s, smaller drug organizations have filled the vacuum and sought
the protection of the FARC rebels.
</P>
<P>
   The CIA estimates that Colombia produced a record 520 metric
tons of cocaine last year and six metric tons of heroin. The South
American nation supplies 90 percent of the cocaine and more than
half of the heroin sold on U.S. streets.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton insisted that U.S. policies can be effective. He said
that overall cocaine produciton in the Andean region is down and
that Pastrana has the courage and political skills to follow
through with tough anti-drug policies.
</P>
<P>
   ``I believe this will work because I think this president and
this government are willing to take the risks necessary to make it
work,`` Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
   Others suspect that Clinton's visit was mainly a show of support
for Pastrana, who has fallen in the opinion polls due to a
prolonged economic recession and a surge in political violence and
kidnappings.
</P>
<P>
   ``Clinton has come to strengthen the image of Pastrana, who has
been a very mediocre president,'' said Juan Villareal, a high
school teacher in Cartagena.
</P>
<P>
   Pastrana called Clinton's visit a ``historic moment'' that marks
a high-water mark in U.S.-Colombian relations. The two-year $1.3
billion U.S. aid package makes Colombia the third largest recipient
of U.S. aid after Israel and Egypt.
</P>
<P>
   ``The journey now begins,'' said Sen. Joe Biden, D-Del., who
assured Pastrana that there will be bipartisan congressional
support for Colombian aid even after Clinton leaves office in
January. ``We are in this for the long haul.''

CLASSIC BEAUTY, CUBED 
</HEADLINE>
   (Circuits)  
 By PETER H. LEWIS    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Come away with me to my desert island, sort of a cross between
``Survivor'' and ``Fantasy Island.'' The fantasy comes into play in
that the island would already have a Power Macintosh G4 Cube
computer with a 15-inch flat-panel Studio Display, a set of Harman
Kardon SoundSticks speakers and a fast Internet connection. Add to
that just one luxury item, ``Survivor'' style, and that would be a
copy of Culture 4.0, an endlessly fascinating CD-ROM from Cultural
Resources.
</P>
<P>
   Culture 4.0 (www.culturalresources.com) is an ambitious Western
civilization study guide for the Internet age, for adults as well
as for students. It works with Windows computers as well as with
Macs.
</P>
<P>
   Although I have become quite intimate with both types of
machines over time, I think I'm going to vote Windows off my
island. I suppose some things would move me to choose Windows _ if,
say, the alternative were eating rats. Both are acquired tastes.
But the new Macintosh G4 Cube computer, like the Parthenon in
Athens, is a thing of classic beauty.
</P>
<P>
   The Parthenon, as I was reminded by browsing through the Culture
4.0 software, is a superb architectural example of the golden
rectangle, one that has the most aesthetically pleasing ratio of
length to width _ the mama bear of rectangles, according to one of
the many clever academics, historians and critics whose views are
included in Culture 4.0. A golden rectangle can be divided into a
square and a smaller rectangle that has the same proportions as the
original rectangle, and the smaller rectangle can itself be
subdivided into a square and still smaller rectangle with those
proportions, and so on.
</P>
<P>
   Apple may have messed up the dimensions slightly, but the Cube
is still the most aesthetically pleasing personal computer on the
market, at least in the eye of this beholder.
</P>
<P>
   The Cube is a Power Macintosh G4 computer shrunk to an 8-inch
silver square. The computer is suspended at the top of a crystal
clear, rectangular case that takes up less than a square foot of
desk space. It is an impressive technical achievement, and one that
should please anyone who lives in a small apartment or works at a
small desk. Because it has no internal fan, the Cube computer is
silent, which is another bonus.
</P>
<P>
   There is a price to pay for such beauty. The basic Cube, with a
450-megahertz G4 microprocessor, costs $1,799, which is more than
one would pay for a comparable Macintosh in the larger, tower
configuration. It also lacks expansion slots, other than one for an
Apple Airport wireless network card.
</P>
<P>
   Apple says the 450-MHz G4 chip delivers better performance than
a Pentium III chip operating at twice the processor speed. Its
marketing pitch for the Cube boasts, ``Honey, we shrunk the
supercomputer.'' Intel and Advanced Micro Devices counter that
Apple must have been out in the sun too long.
</P>
<P>
   But the Apple G4 chip can indeed hold its own with any
Windows-based machine, even those with Pentium III chips, which now
reach 1,000 megahertz or more. Megahertz is just one measure of a
chip's performance, and it can be misleading, like trying to
compare a Ferrari engine running at 4,000 revolutions per minute
with a Honda engine at the same rpm. In this case, the G4 chip is
the Ferarri.
</P>
<P>
   The Cube comes with 64 megabytes of system memory, a 20-gigabyte
hard drive, a DVD-ROM drive that loads from the top the way a
toaster does, a better-than-average graphics card, an Ethernet
port, FireWire and USB ports, and a 56K modem. A pair of
baseball-size Harman Kardon digital speakers, also in clear
plastic, sound as good as they look.
</P>
<P>
   The Cube also comes with a greatly improved Apple Pro keyboard
and an elliptical Apple Pro optical mouse, replacing the hated
hockey-puck mechanical mouse and skeletal keyboard that Apple has
been using since the introduction of the iMac.
</P>
<P>
   The old round mouse was a case study in the hazards of putting
form over function. The new optical mouse blends form and function
much more harmoniously, and it is more accurate and more reliable
than the mechanical mouse it replaces.
</P>
<P>
   Owners of older Macintoshes will be able to buy the new
USB-based Apple Pro keyboard and mouse from the Apple Store later
this year for $60 each, but they will also have to upgrade to
Version 9.0.4 of the OS.
</P>
<P>
   On my fantasy island there is also a pirate's chest of gold,
which would allow me to spend $2,299 for a souped-up Cube with a
500-megahertz G4 chip, 128 megabytes of RAM and a 30-gigabyte hard
disk. The memory can be expanded to 256 megabytes for an extra
$300, and the hard disk to 40 gigabytes for $100.
</P>
<P>
   The perfect complement for the Cube is Apple's elegant new
15-inch flat-panel Studio Display LCD ($999), which matches the
silver and crystal scheme and takes up a fraction of the desk space
of a conventional monitor. (It is a Mini-Me version of Apple's
magnificent but magnificently priced 22-inch Cinema Display, which
at $3,999 goes beyond the resources of even a pirate chest.) The
Cube works with any VGA monitor, but the 15-inch Studio Display LCD
(liquid crystal display) takes less desk space than a comparable
17-inch tube display.
</P>
<P>
   In part because it uses a truly digital interface, the Studio
Display LCD delivers a brighter and sharper image than any other
flat-panel monitor I've seen. And the Studio Display LCD plugs
directly into the Cube without the need for a separate power cord,
enhancing the monitor's already unmatched desk appeal.
</P>
<P>
   To complete the package, consider adding the beautiful Harman
Kardon SoundSticks speaker package ($299), available only through
Apple's online store (www.apple.com). The three-piece system
consists of a beach-ball subwoofer and a pair of nine-inch desk
speakers, all in clear plastic. Although the subwoofer is intended
to be placed under the user's desk, it is a shame to hide its
mesmerizing violet light. On the other hand, the subwoofer may
remind some people of the severed head of Robby the Robot.
</P>
<P>
   The SoundSticks system delivers brilliant sound, especially when
the user is watching DVD movies on the Studio Display.
</P>
<P>
   Together, the Cube, the Studio Display LCD and the SoundSticks
speakers create a stunning array of desk sculpture. It is a shame,
then, that one has to junk it up with an ugly printer. There are no
printers available in the crystal and silver color scheme, although
the gray-and-black Hewlett-Packard DeskJet 970 comes closest. Apple
has not indicated whether it will license its silver color scheme
to peripherals makers, but I hope it does.
</P>
<P>
   All these thoughts about beauty and art surfaced as I was using
the Cube to browse Culture 4.0, which is subtitled The Contextual
Guide and Internet Index to Western Civilization, Covering Various
and Sundry Things Every High School Student Should Learn and Every
College Student and Graduate Should Know.
</P>
<P>
   Culture 4.0 ($69, plus $5 shipping) draws heavily from the
lectures of Dr. Walter Reinhold, a professor of music history and
humanities who has twice been voted teacher of the year at New York
University. Classroom teachers or self-teachers may want to order
the 195-page printed workbook ($29, plus $5 shipping).
</P>
<P>
   The first Culture version appeared a decade ago in Apple's
Hypercard format, which could be described as a prototype of the
World Wide Web, only with training wheels. Culture 4.0 has now been
rewritten in Web format so it requires the use of a browser.
</P>
<P>
   Compared with fancier educational programs created by big
software companies with multimillion-dollar production budgets,
Culture 4.0's presentation is a bit threadbare, and it can be
occasionally difficult to navigate. But the program is rich in
ideas and content, which is where it really counts.
</P>
<P>
   The disk itself comes with more than 10,000 profiles of famous
people, more than 1,700 pictures and illustrations, and more than
200 short, entertaining essays on political, literary, musical,
artistic, philosophical and theological history, all woven together
to put people, events and ideas into context. The program's scope
is virtually unlimited because it has more than 25,000 links to
related sources of information on the Web. And most of those links
have links, creating an outward spiral of information as elegant as
the Nautilus shell.
</P>
<P>
   ``Personalities, events, works of art and styles all play on and
off each other,'' Reinhold notes in an introduction to the program.
Culture 4.0 builds order out of what might otherwise seem to be the
chaos of historical events and ideas, and that, after all, is what
civilization is all about.
</P>
<P>
   Above all, Culture 4.0 reminds us that in our haste to make
computer literacy a goal of our schools, we must not forget
cultural literacy. And that is a beautiful thing.

INTEL SUES BROADCOM, CLAIMING PATENT INFRINGEMENT 
</HEADLINE>
   By LAWRENCE M. FISHER   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Intel filed a lawsuit on Wednesday accusing the
Broadcom Corp. of ``a carefully crafted plan'' to build its
business in cable and high-speed networking products by violating
Intel patents.
</P>
<P>
   The lawsuit, filed in U.S. District Court in Delaware, stems
from an earlier Intel case alleging that Broadcom misappropriated
trade secrets.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nearly every aspect of Broadcom's business _ cable products,
high-speed networking products, even semiconductor package
configurations _ violates one or more Intel patents,'' the new
complaint alleges. ``Broadcom focused on acquiring Intel technology
by inducing Intel employees to disclose trade secrets.''
</P>
<P>
   Broadcom shares dropped by 5 percent on Wednesday, closing at
$238.44, down $13.50, in Nasdaq trading. Intel shares closed at
$73.50, down 56 cents.
</P>
<P>
   Chuck Mulloy, an Intel spokesman, said, ``Typically we would
prefer to find some sort of amicable solution, but it is clear that
Broadcom does not have any respect for Intel's intellectual
property.''
</P>
<P>
   Bill Blanning, a spokesman for Broadcom, said the company had
heard of the suit only through press inquiries. ``We haven't had a
chance to review it,'' Blanning said. ``Intel made no effort to
contact us or resolve any issues they might have with us. We're
confident in the soundness of our business practices and will
defend ourselves vigorously.''
</P>
<P>
   But according to the complaint, Intel made many attempts to
contact Broadcom and secure the return of its trade secrets.
</P>
<P>
   Intel sued Broadcom in a California state court on March 8 in
the trade secrets case, and on March 10 that court entered a
temporary restraining order prohibiting Broadcom from ``disclosing,
using or acquiring'' Intel's trade secrets. Nine days later, the
court issued a preliminary injunction against Broadcom.
</P>
<P>
   In a May 25 order, the California court said there was probable
cause to believe that only days after the temporary restraining
order was issued, Broadcom's highest management had misappropriated
Intel trade secrets under the pretense of employment interviews.
The court said that ``Broadcom's approach to protecting Intel's
trade secrets was extremely cavalier,'' adding that it found
excuses offered in testimony by Broadcom's chief executive, Henry
T. Nicholas 3rd, ``unpersuasive and not credible.''
</P>
<P>
   Broadcom, based in Irvine, Calif., is subject to a
court-appointed, independent monitor to ensure that it complies
with the court's order not to misappropriate Intel's trade secrets.
</P>
<P>
   Intel said the patents involved covered a range of technologies,
including networking products, motion picture decoding used in
Broadcom cable products, and packages that Broadcom uses to sell
its chips. Intel, based in Santa Clara, Calif., seeks monetary
damages to compensate for Broadcom's past infringement and requests
the court to block sales of future infringing products.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the bulk of Intel's charges, Mark Edelstone, an analyst
with Morgan Stanley, said that Broadcom had substantial
intellectual property of its own, and would inevitably countersue,
probably ultimately resulting in a cross-licensing agreement
between the two companies.

<P>
   SARATOGA SPRINGS, N.Y. _ God may have given people dominion over
the animals, but such Biblical injunctions mean little for the
sleek, toned thoroughbreds that are stabled around the Saratoga
racetrack.
</P>
<P>
   Here horses are supreme. They are waited upon and cared for by
hundreds of grooms, hot walkers, exercise riders, veterinarians,
night watchmen, assistant trainers, trainers, jockeys and owners.
They fetch tens of thousands to millions of dollars at auctions,
and the race to the wire not only breaks or makes fortunes, but
imparts worth and identity to the lowest of stable hands. All of
life, it seems, is viewed through a totemic relationship to a
horse.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was given an autographed picture by the exercise rider who
handled Secretariat,'' said the Rev. Jim Watson, 51, the Southern
Baptist minister who serves as the race track chaplain in the
summer at Saratoga and each fall at Belmont, ``and this was 20
years after Secretariat won the Triple Crown. But in this world, he
is somebody because he once rode Secretariat.''
</P>
<P>
   There are two enclaves at the racetrack for horse enthusiasts.
In the world the public sees, the animals are unleashed at 40 miles
an hour in a thundering fury by diminutive jockeys dressed in
colorful silk jackets and polished black boots. Presiding over this
world are owners who often invest millions of dollars to finance
their passion and rarely turn a profit. It is the Saratoga of show,
glitter, excitement and sumptuous excess.
</P>
<P>
   The underside of the sport is the backstretch, where 1,200
migrant workers, who tend the stables and the mounts, live crowded
into dirty, spartan rooms and usually work seven days a week for a
couple of hundred dollars. The backstretch was dominated a few
decades ago by African-Americans from the South, but it now belongs
mostly to Puerto Ricans and Mexicans.
</P>
<P>
   Those in this world rise as early as 4 a.m. They dart around the
highly strung 1,000-pound animals, cleaning out the stalls, filling
water buckets, pouring out feed, washing down the animals and
walking them to cool down after their daily 20 minutes of exercise.
Most work seven days a week. Few receive overtime. Nearly all have
been kicked, crushed or knocked over by the horses, with many
spending weeks recovering from broken bones.
</P>
<P>
   ``As soon as we go outside the gates we are made to feel we do
not belong,'' said Maria Roma, 49, who has worked most of her life
as a groom, ``especially in Saratoga. You should see how they look
at us, like dogs.
</P>
<P>
   ``But I would not give up this life. I like the movement, the
excitement and the people. I was not made to sit at home in a
house. I don't like to be tied down.''
</P>
<P>
   Watson, a portly preacher who speaks English and Spanish in a
slow Arkansas drawl, says he is called to minister in the
backstretch. He often rises early in the morning to drink coffee
along the rail of the practice track, chat and watch the exercise
riders, bent low or riding high in the stirrups, as they work the
horses.
</P>
<P>
   He broke horses in Hot Springs, Ark., as a young man, and has a
scar running from his left armpit to his hip where he was tossed
into a barbed wire fence. He has spent most of his life at tracks,
hanging around Oakland Park in Arkansas as a boy, and has worked
for 14 years as a chaplain at Belmont, Aqueduct and Saratoga, hired
by Race Track Chaplains of America.
</P>
<P>
   While he loves the animals and says he adores the misfits and
oddballs that make up the racing scene, he also sees it as
destructive to many who toil in its lower rungs. His weekly service
and daily devotionals with the jockeys rarely attract more than a
dozen congregants. But he slogs on, hoping to relieve what he says
is widespread fatalism and despair.
</P>
<P>
   ``I do not like the emphasis that makes an animal more important
than a human being,'' he said. ``It affects the way the people on
the backstretch think of themselves. It is not so much that they
are told they are not important, but that they are constantly told
how important is the horse.
</P>
<P>
   ``It has a tremendous impact on self-esteem. If a horse limps
out of a stall, everyone gets excited and upset. If a groom limps,
no one cares as long as he can make it around the shed row.''
</P>
<P>
   The migrant workers move from track to track. They may spend the
summer in Saratoga, the fall at Belmont or Aqueduct and the winter
in Florida. Most have few possessions, little job security and no
roots.
</P>
<P>
   ``Life at the track teaches you to live day by day,'' Watson
said one morning, as half a dozen horses were pounding down the
dirt strip. ``You learn not to count on tomorrow. I would say that
95 percent of those in the backstretch do not know when they will
leave Saratoga for New York. If they are lucky the trainer will
tell them the night before, if they are not they will learn about
it the morning of departure. And many do not even know if they will
go from here to Belmont or Kentucky.''
</P>
<P>
   ``You can have the top horse in the country and he can take one
misstep out there and suddenly after all that work you have
nothing,'' he said. ``The problem with living like this is that it
makes people fatalistic. They believe they do not have control.
They merely react to what happens. There is a very fine line
between learning to live day by day and giving up on life and
letting things happen. And this fatalism shows itself in alcohol
abuse and drug use.''
</P>
<P>
   In the dusk one evening this week, after the races had ended and
the horses been put into their stalls for the night, Hispanic
laborers, some of whom admitted they were in the country illegally,
crowded around a pavilion where two women cooked rice, beans,
tortillas and hunks of beef. The women dished out the food on thin
aluminum plates and stuffed crumbled $5 bills from the workers into
their aprons. Those eating the food clutched bottles of Budweiser
with soiled fingers.
</P>
<P>
   They spoke of children and wives back home and the struggles to
wire enough of their earnings to support them. They spat out the
names of jockeys, who can earn hundreds of thousands of dollars a
year, but bring them only a box of donuts the morning after winning
huge purses. They cursed trainers who they said pushed them too
hard.
</P>
<P>
   When they talked of their ambitions, all stayed within the
narrow hierarchy of the track. They said they dreamed of moving
from hot walker to groom to exercise rider to trainer, as if this
was the only progress in life worth contemplating. All said they
loved horses.
</P>
<P>
   ``My father spent 11 years as a groom here,'' said Carlos
Sepulvera, 21, a groom from Chile, his long hair cascading out of a
baseball cap. ``Now he is an assistant trainer in Chile. I am
waiting to go back and train my own horses.''
</P>
<P>
   Until then, Sepulvera, who works seven days a week and sleeps on
the floor of a room with four other men, survives on $200 a week
and waits.
</P>
<P>
</P>

 By DAVID STOUT

<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Two aides to President Richard M. Nixon said
Wednesday that they doubted he ever took the drug Dilantin, an
anti-seizure medication, despite a new book that says he did.
</P>
<P>
   The aides, John H. Taylor, the director of the Nixon Library in
Yorba Linda, Calif., who knew Nixon from the mid-1980s until the
former president's death in 1994, and Steve Bull, who was Nixon's
personal aide from mid-1969 until late 1974, said they were
skeptical of assertions in the book that Nixon medicated himself
with Dilantin given to him by Jack Dreyfus, the founder of the
Dreyfus Fund and an avid promoter of the drug.
</P>
<P>
   Dreyfus said last week that an account in the book, ``The
Arrogance of Power: The Secret World of Richard Nixon,'' that he
gave Dilantin to Nixon in 1968 was correct. Dreyfus said he gave
Nixon a bottle of 1,000 capsules of 100 milligrams each ``when his
mood wasn't too good,'' and later gave him another bottle of 1,000
capsules.
</P>
<P>
   The book written by Anthony Summers and published by Viking
paints an unfavorable portrait of Nixon politically and personally.
Its assertion that he freely medicated himself while coping with
the burdens of the White House is one of several contentions that
have been disputed by Nixon's relatives and associates. Taylor and
Bull volunteered their views in reaction to reports about the book.
</P>
<P>
   Taylor said the Richard Nixon he knew ``went to traditional
doctors when he was sick and always did what they said.''
</P>
<P>
   As for Dilantin, Bull, who is now director of government
relations for the U.S. Olympic Committee, said, ``I never saw any
evidence that he used any medication of that kind. Never.''
</P>
<P>
   Dreyfus has advocated the drug as being effective in dealing
with anxiety, anger, depression and other troubling conditions.
</P>
<P>
   Dilantin, introduced in the 1930s, is routinely prescribed by
neurologists to prevent seizures caused by epilepsy or other
conditions, but is rarely used to treat mental disorders. However,
other, newer anti-seizure drugs _ including Tegritol and Depakote _
are used in the treatment of depression and some other psychiatric
illnesses.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Frederick Jacobsen, a psychopharmacologist at George
Washington University, said Dilantin was not widely used because it
had not proved very effective as a treatment for mental disorders,
and had more side effects than newer drugs.
</P>
<P>
   Common side effects of Dilantin, which is chemically related to
barbiturates but does not share their addictive properties, can
include sedation, mental confusion or fuzziness, physical
unsteadiness and slurred speech. According to the Physician's Desk
Reference, such side effects occur primarily when patients take too
much Dilantin. But Jacobsen said confusion can also occur ``with
doses within the therapeutic range.''
</P>
<P>
   With long-term use Dilantin can also cause an overgrowth of the
gums.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the majority of psychiatrists do not find much benefit
for Dilantin,'' Jacobsen said. ``It's not in the standard
repertoire of the general psychopharmacologist.''
</P>
<P>
   Jacobsen said that to describe Dilantin as a ``mind-altering
drug'' was not entirely accurate. ``It would be more accurate to
characterize it as a `brain-altering drug,''' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Self-medicating with Dilantin, as the book contends Nixon did,
would not be a good idea, Jacobsen added. ``Self-medication in
general is not a good idea, and certainly one runs the risk of
toxicity,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Taylor produced a summary of White House records from April 1969
through mid-1973 recalling numerous attempts by Dreyfus to gain
government backing for Dilantin through Nixon. The records state
that Nixon met with Dreyfus now and then socially, but they portray
the president as reluctant to get into lengthy discussions about
Dilantin.
</P>
<P>
   Taylor said Nixon might have accepted Dilantin from Dreyfus so
as not to hurt his feelings, but that if he did he threw it out
rather than taking it.

U.S. EXPANDS SCOPE OF INQUIRY ON DEFECTIVE FIRESTONE TIRES 
</HEADLINE>
  (EDS: Subs to recast throughout, updates background, details and
quotes.) 
 By STEPHEN LABATON   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Federal regulators trying to determine how much the
Ford Motor Co. knew about defective tires used on its Explorers
expanded their investigation Wednesday by demanding that the
company provide detailed information on any tire problems in 16
countries outside the United States.
</P>
<P>
   The disclosure was made public by regulators in a letter sent on
Tuesday to Ford from officials at the National Highway
Transportation Safety Administration. Both the agency and the
automaker have come under increasing political pressure,
particularly as it has become clear that for nearly two years Ford
received complaints from overseas about possible problems with
Firestone tires on its Explorers but did not recall them until this
month. U.S. regulators say that they have received more than 750
complaints about the tires involving at least 62 deaths. Almost all
of the deaths occurred in sport utility vehicles, mostly Explorers,
that rolled over.
</P>
<P>
   The letter was a clear attempt by the regulators to determine
who knew what, and when. Ford executives have said that they
investigated complaints in Venezuela and in Saudi Arabia about tire
problems and challenged the conclusions of Bridgestone/Firestone
Inc., the American unit of Bridgestone of Japan, that the tires
were not defective. But Ford executives have also said that they
did not understand the true magnitude of the problems until earlier
this month after discussions with Firestone and that they then
acted quickly to begin the process of replacing 6.5 million tires.
</P>
<P>
   Federal officials say they have limited ability to monitor
recalls and defects of cars sold abroad, although some critics like
Joan Claybrook, a former top official at the National Highway
Transportation Safety Administration, say the agency has the
authority under a 1966 law to monitor recalls and defects abroad
but refuses to exercise it.
</P>
<P>
   Congress is exploring whether to expand the authority of the
regulators and impose new rules on automakers to report problems
discovered outside the United States. This week, Ford and Firestone
described a series of disagreements about the tires after
complaints in 1998 in Venezuela and last year in Saudi Arabia. Ford
had concluded the tires were defective, while Firestone insisted
they were not.
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday, a government agency in Venezuela is expected to
issue a report criticizing both Ford and Firestone for the way that
they handled tire problems there. Ford had recalled vehicles with
the tires in Venezuela in May and had earlier replaced tires on 160
Explorers in Thailand in March and April.
</P>
<P>
   The two companies and American regulators are expected to face
intensive questioning next week when congressional hearings begin
over the tire recall. The companies are obliged to report defects
in the United States to regulators, but regulators have said the
companies do not face reporting obligations in many circumstances
when the problems are noticed in cars abroad.
</P>
<P>
   ``Manufacturers have certain legal obligations to report defect
problems and NHTSA has some obligations to Congress,'' said Ken
Johnson, a spokesman for Rep. Billy Tauzin, R-La., who heads one of
the House committees investigating the tire recall. ``Someone
dropped the ball, and we're trying to find out who. But we're
really trying to figure out some broader issues. Did Firestone
break the law or is the law broken? We're going to have to take a
hard look at the law to make sure it's strong enough.''
</P>
<P>
   Those scheduled to testify next week at the proceedings before
two House committees include Transportation Secretary Rodney
Slater, other transportation regulators, executives from the two
companies and safety experts. Congressional aides say they may also
take testimony from owners of Explorers involved in traffic
accidents that they think were caused by defective tires.
</P>
<P>
   There were further negotiations Wednesday between lawmakers and
Ford over the possible appearance at the hearings of Jacques A.
Nasser, the chief executive of Ford, who has refused to testify.
The company announced Wednesday that it would send Helen
Petrauskas, vice president for environmental and safety
engineering, and Tom Baughman, an engineering director, to testify.
By contrast, Bridgestone/Firestone agreed to send Masatoshi Ono,
its chief executive, to the hearing.
</P>
<P>
   In the Senate, the Commerce Committee said Wednesday that it
would postpone the beginning of its hearings by a week until
mid-September. Congressional aides said the hearings were delayed
to give the committee's chairman, Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., more
time to recuperate from recent surgery for skin cancer.
</P>
<P>
   Congressional officials said that the Senate hearing could be
broader than the House proceeding and that it might also examine a
court decision on Tuesday that said Ford had knowingly installed
defective ignition mechanisms in nearly 2 million vehicles produced
from 1983 to 1995. Ford has disputed those findings.
</P>
<P>
   Officials at the National Highway Transportation Safety
Administration declined to comment about the judge's decision
Wednesday. Nearly two years ago, the agency concluded that Ford had
not been forthcoming about ignition problems but decided to take no
action against the company. In a letter sent at the time to Ford
and a plaintiff's lawyer who had raised complaints that the company
was deceptive, the transportation agency's chief counsel decided
not to penalize Ford because the company's failure to be
forthcoming had occurred in the 1980s and the potential penalties
would amount only to a maximum of $7,000.
</P>
<P>
   The stocks of both Ford and Bridgestone have slumped since the
tire recall was announced. Shares of Ford have fallen 12 percent,
to $26, while the American depository receipts of Bridgestone have
fallen 22 percent, to $144.50. In Japan, shares of Bridgestone have
declined 34.6 percent.

DEATH PENALTY IN TEXAS CASE IS OVERTURNED
</HEADLINE>
 By RICHARD A. OPPEL Jr.   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   DALLAS _ A federal judge has overturned the death sentence of a
Texas man convicted of killing a 16-year-old boy, citing the
``dismal'' performance of the convicted man's lawyer during his
trial as well as the prosecution's failure to disclose to jurors
that an important witness was a paid informer.
</P>
<P>
   Judge David Folsom of U.S. District Court in Texarkana, Texas,
ruling on a motion filed four years ago, left intact the conviction
of Delma Banks Jr. for the April 1980 murder of Richard Wayne
Whitehead. Prosecutors say Banks shot Whitehead in Nash, Texas, and
then stole his car to drive to Dallas.
</P>
<P>
   But Folsom ordered the state either to reduce Banks' sentence or
to order a new sentencing trial within 120 days.
</P>
<P>
   The ruling endorsed the findings of a federal magistrate,
Caroline Malone, who in May cited the poor job done by Banks'
lawyer and the prosecution's failure to disclose that one of its
witnesses, Robert Farr, was a paid informant.
</P>
<P>
   Folsom's ruling was issued on Aug. 18 but was first reported on
Wednesday in The Texarkana Gazette. He cited the magistrate's
finding of ``a reasonable probability that but for the errors and
omissions of trial counsel at the punishment phase, combined with
the state's failure to disclose Farr as a paid informant, the
outcome of Banks' punishment phase would have been different.''
</P>
<P>
   The magistrate also stated that ``the state's failure to
disclose Farr's informant status, coupled with trial counsel's
dismal performance during the punishment phase, undermined the
reliability of the jury's verdict regarding punishment.''
</P>
<P>
   Clifton L. Holmes, a Longview, Texas., defense lawyer who is one
of Banks' appellate lawyers, said Banks' trial lawyer did ``very
little preparation in terms of preparing for the punishment trial
and introducing those kinds of things that all courts recognize as
mitigating factors, such as the condition of his upbringing and the
like.''
</P>
<P>
   If Banks were to be retried to determine whether he is to be
executed by lethal injection, he would stand a good chance of
receiving only prison time, Holmes said. He contended that evidence
collected since the trial casts doubt on the conviction, and he
said that Banks has not been a dangerous or violent inmate in his
20 years on death row, making it difficult for prosecutors to argue
that he is a danger to society.
</P>
<P>
   If Banks is not sentenced to death, he could be eligible for
parole, based on the time he has already spent in prison, the Bowie
County district attorney, Bobby Lockhart, told the Texarkana
Gazette.
</P>
<P>
   Lockhart, who did not return a telephone call seeking comment,
told the newspaper that ``we feel like he'd be eligible for parole
right now.'' He said his office plans to appeal Folsom's ruling to
the 5th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, and that he would leave the
decision of whether to retry Banks to Whitehead's family and to one
of his assistant prosecutors. ``I can't imagine any reason why we
wouldn't retry it,'' he told the newspaper.
</P>
<P>
   The competency of lawyers who represents indigent defendants in
capital cases in Texas has become a political issue this year.
George W. Bush, the governor of Texas and the Republican
presidential nominee, is a strong supporter of the fairness of the
state's death penalty system.
</P>
<P>
   Yet critics have attacked the system, arguing that many
defendants receive inadequate counsel, including at least three
widely publicized cases of lawyers who have slept through parts of
the proceedings. The state appeals court has reversed only eight
death penalty cases in the last five years, while affirming the
convictions and death sentences in 256 cases, according to court
statistics. This is the lowest reversal rate in capital cases in
the country.
</P>
<P>
   Florida, which ranks behind Texas with the nation's
third-highest death row population, has a 50 percent reversal rate.
</P>
<P>
   Folsom's ruling was on a writ of habeas corpus, a motion that
seeks court review of an imprisonment. Such petitions are common in
death-penalty cases, but they are not granted very often. However,
Maurie Levin, a lawyer at the Texas Defender Service, in Austin,
which represents indigent death-row inmates, said federal judges in
Texas have granted some form of habeas relief in at least two other
death penalty cases just this year.
</P>
<P>
   The habeas rulings, Levin said, ``underscore and exemplify the
errors in the system and the need for the kind of advocacy'' during
the appeals process that revealed errors at trial.

DEMOCRATS HOPE TO BEGIN RETAKING GOVERNORSHIPS
</HEADLINE>
 By MICHAEL JANOFSKY   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   For the first time in Mississippi's history, state lawmakers
were called on early this year to choose the next governor. No
candidate had reached the 50 percent plus one required to win the
popular vote, and so the election went to the House of
Representatives, where the outcome was far more certain.
Overwhelmingly Democratic, the House made Lt. Gov. Ronnie Musgrove
the winner over his Republican opponent, Mike Parker, a former
congressman.
</P>
<P>
   It is upon such thin reeds that Democrats are building their
hopes of making even a dent this fall in the Republican Party's
30-18 advantage in governorships. (Maine has an independent as
governor, Angus King, and Minnesota has Jesse Ventura, now with the
Minnesota Independence Party.)
</P>
<P>
   Only 11 states are holding elections for governor in November.
By all accounts most of the races are too close to call, but the
biggest swing that either party realistically envisions is two or
three seats. The real test of the parties' struggle for the
nation's statehouses is not likely to come until the off-year
elections of 2002, with governors' races in 36 states.
</P>
<P>
   It was the elections in those states in 1994 that dug the hole
from which the Democrats are now trying to emerge. Two years into
President Clinton's first term, a restless electorate not only
delivered control of both houses of Congress to Republicans for the
first time in 40 years but also turned the Democrats' 30-18
advantage in governorships into a 30-19 lead for Republicans.
</P>
<P>
   In 1996 and again in 1998, the Republicans extended their
advantage by one, to give them 32 governors, a 50-year high for the
party.
</P>
<P>
   Now, with Republicans holding slimmer margins in Congress and
Vice President Al Gore edging ahead of Gov. George W. Bush in some
national polls, Democrats say the time is right for them to reclaim
some of the executive offices they have lost.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I were making book, I'd say we will pick up one to three
seats this year and will very likely pick up two,'' said Gov. Paul
Patton of Kentucky, chairman of the Democratic Governors'
Association. ``Then I'd expect to pick up another one next year.''
</P>
<P>
   Democrats are defending governorships this fall in Delaware,
Indiana, Missouri, New Hampshire, North Carolina, Vermont and
Washington. Republicans are defending in Montana, North Dakota,
Utah and West Virginia.
</P>
<P>
   In 2001, only New Jersey and Virginia will have races for
governor, and in both the office is now held by Republicans barred
from seeking re-election. Democrats view their chances as
especially strong in New Jersey, where James McGreevey, who barely
lost to Gov. Christie Whitman in 1997, has time to generate money
and support while Republicans fight over which of three candidates
will oppose him.
</P>
<P>
   Republican officials brush off any projections of significant
Democratic gains, contending that more Republicans are elected as
governor these days because voters prefer them. Republicans also
say they are encouraged because the four Democratic governors who
this year are seeking another term _ Frank O'Bannon in Indiana,
Jeanne Shaheen in New Hampshire, Howard Dean in Vermont and Gary
Locke in Washington _ are all facing Republican opposition that is
stronger than first expected.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd like to just say we're better than them,'' said Clinton
Key, executive director of the Republican Governors' Association.
``Our guys get it. We have a group of truly talented people who
know how to get elected and get things accomplished. Our
attractiveness is as high as it's ever been.''
</P>
<P>
   With only a relative handful of elections this year, it is
difficult to discern an overriding theme. Issues like education and
taxes have dominated the political discourse among most candidates,
but the particular needs and nature of each of the states tend to
keep them from being meaningfully linked.
</P>
<P>
   ``Gubernatorial candidates are going to be evaluated on their
own merits more so than how some candidate performs in a
neighboring state,'' said Thomas Carsey, associate professor of
political science at Florida State University and author of a new
book, ``Campaign Dynamics: The Race for Governor.''
</P>
<P>
   One variable, particularly in the close races, is the effect of
the presidential election. A strong Democratic turnout for Gore in
West Virginia, where Rep. Bob Wise, a nine-term Democrat, is
challenging Gov. Cecil Underwood, could help Wise in one of the six
races for governor rated a tossup by The Cook Political Report. The
other tossup states, where presidential fortunes could play a role,
are Delaware, Missouri, Montana, North Carolina and North Dakota.
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, a strong showing in Indiana by O'Bannon, who
is leading his Republican challenger, Rep. David McIntosh, in
recent polls, could help Gore win a state that has voted for only
two Democratic presidential nominees in 100 years, Franklin D.
Roosevelt and Lyndon B. Johnson.

   GORE RETAINS MOMENTUM IN POLLS
</P>
<P>
   Vice President Al Gore is still enjoying a post-convention
bounce in presidential preference polls. Gore has taken a 15-point
lead over Gov. George W. Bush of Texas in Maryland, an 8-point lead
in Florida, a 5-point lead in Illinois and has closed to within 4
points in New Hampshire. In Maryland, according to a
Gonzales-Arscott poll of 649 registered voters taken Wednesday
through Sunday, Gore leads 51 percent to 36 percent, while in
Florida, according to a Rasmussen Research poll of 439 voters
conducted Saturday and Sunday, he leads 48 percent to 40 percent.
In Illinois, a Mason-Dixon poll of 629 voters taken Thursday
through Sunday showed Gore ahead of Bush 46 percent to 41 percent,
while in a New Hampshire poll, covering 540 registered voters and
conducted Thursday through Saturday, Bush retained a lead of 48
percent to 44 percent. The margin of sampling error for the new
Florida poll was plus or minus 5 percentage points. In the three
other polls it was plus or minus 4 percentage points.

   NADER WINS UNION BACKING
</P>
<P>
   The news is good and bad this week for Ralph Nader, the Green
Party's presidential candidate. On Wednesday in Erie, Pa., Nader
won the endorsement of the 35,000-member United Electrical, Radio
and Machine Workers of America, after telling the union's
convention that while the Democratic Party might be labor's
traditional political partner in presidential races, it always
promised more than it delivered. He promised to deliver. The union
seldom endorses presidential candidates. But there was bad
political news for Nader on Tuesday in South Dakota, where he had
missed the June 20 filing deadline for getting on the fall ballot
and had been trying to persuade a judge that he should be listed
anyway. The judge turned him down. Also, in Wyoming on Tuesday,
state election officials said that Nader would not be on the fall
ballot there because he fell short of the 3,584 signatures needed
to qualify. One reason he fell short was that a volunteer walked
off with a petition containing 650 signatures.
</P>
<P>
   REFORM PARTY FEUD UNRESOLVED
</P>
<P>
   A federal judge in Lynchburg, Va., ruled Wednesday that he did
not have jurisdiction to decide the bitter feud over who is the
Reform Party's presidential nominee. Allies of one candidate, Pat
Buchanan, sought an order barring a competing faction from
operating under the party's name. But Judge Norman K. Moon of U.S.
District Court, who has heard other Reform Party disputes, said he
lacked jurisdiction in this instance because the power struggle did
not raise any constitutional issue. At the party's convention in
Long Beach, Calif., earlier this month, delegates opposed to
Buchanan declared his nomination illegal and walked out, asserting
that he had packed the convention with hard-right followers who
were not qualified delegates. The rump group then held its own
convention across the street and nominated John Hagelin, a
physicist from Iowa. Both sides are seeking $12.6 million in
Federal Election Commission money and competing to get sole billing
on state ballots. Buchanan officials said they would next try a
state court.

   WASHINGTON STATE'S BATTLE OF THE ADS
</P>
<P>
   With just three weeks to go before the Democratic primary in
Washington state, Insurance Commissioner Deborah Senn has unveiled
her television advertising campaign for the U.S. Senate nomination.
Senn accuses her better-financed opponent, former Rep. Maria
Cantwell, of dodging debates and ``hiding in a TV'' via her own
commercials. Cantwell, who became a millionaire several times over
as an Internet executive after being turned out of office in the
1994 Republican takeover of Congress, has been showing
advertisements throughout the summer, pointing out her business
experience and other credentials and all but ignoring Senn. Some
polls have shown Cantwell well in front, but Senn says those polls
demonstrated only name recognition, not popular support. The winner

   It was bound to happen. On Tuesday, at a late night rally in
downtown Portland, Ore., Vice President Al Gore and his running
mate, Sen. Joseph Lieberman (did we mention that he's Jewish?),
were greeted by supporters waving placards that spelled out
Gore-Lieberman in Hebrew letters. It should be noted, however, that
the signs said ``Gore-Lieberman 2000,'' not Gore-Lieberman 5761,
the date of the coming election in the Hebrew calendar.

   RUSSIA: AMERICAN'S PLEA SCHEDULED
</P>
<P>
   A day after Edmond Pope's wife and his congressman made a public
appeal for better medical treatment for the former naval
intelligence officer awaiting trial in Moscow on espionage charges,
a Moscow court scheduled a hearing to reconsider Pope's plea for
conditional release. The Moscow City Court, responding swiftly to a
new petition, announced it will hear an appeal on Sept. 11 from
Pope's lawyer, Pavel Astakhov, whose earlier filings were rejected.

</P>
<P>
   A Croatian witness in war crimes trials who testified nearly two
years ago was slain in a bomb blast near his home in Zagreb in what
was seen as a warning to others who might testify to the
International Criminal Tribunal on the Former Yugoslavia about
possible Croatian war crimes in Bosnia. Tribunal officials said
Milan Levar was given government protection in April 1998, after he
testified for the third and last time, and that they had had no

   John Hume, the leader of the moderate Catholic Social Democratic
and Labor Party and a principal architect of the Ulster peace pact,
said he was giving up his seat in the new Northern Ireland
Assembly, explaining that ``for health reasons, I have decided it

   The British province's most powerful Protestant politician, the
Ulster Unionist leader David Trimble, condemned warring Protestant
paramilitary groups whose turf war led to the firebombing of more
than 25 homes in two towns and has resulted in the deaths of three
men and the shooting of an 11-year-old girl in the past 10 days.
Police say the violence is a struggle for control of the drug

   BRITAIN: STRIKE HITS TOURISTS
</P>
<P>
   Thousands of vacationing British tourists were stranded at ferry
terminals on both sides of the English Channel as French fishermen
blockaded piers to protest rising fuel prices. Also on the rise
were neighborly irritations. One Englishman stuck in Calais, David

&HT;    GOVERNOR TO DECIDE FATE OF CALIFORNIA E-TAX BILL
</HEADLINE>
(For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By PAM PARK 
c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News 
<TEXT>
 &LR;
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Retailers with a brick-and-mortar presence in the
state will be required to pay sales tax on their Web site sales to
Californians if Gov. Gray Davis signs a just-approved e-commerce
bill into law.
</P>
<P>
   But the fate of the E-Commerce Sales Tax Fairness Bill, which
was approved by the Senate late Tuesday, is uncertain at best.
Davis has not decided whether to sign it but is generally opposed
to Internet taxation, said spokesman Roger Salazar.
</P>
<P>
   He has until Sept. 30 to sign or veto it.
</P>
<P>
   Internet sales taxation is a national issue, and the U.S.
Supreme Court has ruled remote Internet businesses can't be taxed
by a state if they have no physical presence there.
</P>
<P>
   Some retailers who have facilities in California voluntarily pay
sales tax on their Web site sales, even if their dot.com
subsidiaries are located in another state.
</P>
<P>
   Others, including a couple of large bookstore chains, don't
collect the tax, said Assemblywoman Carole Migden, D-San Francisco,
who cosponsored the bill with Assemblywoman Dion Aroner,
D-Berkeley.
</P>
<P>
   A Senate floor analysis estimates the state is losing $14.4
million annually in these uncollected sales taxes.
</P>
<P>
   Migden said the bill's purpose was to clarify California sales
tax law. She argued that if a store is located in California, it
must collect sales tax and forming an Internet-based subsidiary
that sells essentially the same products doesn't relieve the store
of its obligation.
</P>
<P>
   Opponents have said the bill is unconstitutional and imposes a
new tax.
</P>
<P>
   The Internet sales tax issue has parallels in any retail
segment, but independent booksellers pushed for the California
bill.
</P>
<P>
   The mega-booksellers who have stores in California but don't
collect sales taxes on online sales to Californians put
independents at a competitive disadvantage, and they take needed
tax revenue away from the communities they do business in, said Hut
Landon, owner of Landon Books in Mill Valley.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're just saying enforce the law across the board,'' Landon
said.
</P>
<P>
   The independent booksellers don't know what the governor will
do, but they hope he will support local businesses and communities,
Landon said.
</P>
<P>
   That's not the issue, said Jeffrey Solsby, spokesman for U.S.
Rep. James Rogan, R-Pasadena. The state Legislature is more
interested in collecting new taxes to fund its spending than
protecting small businesses that are the lifeblood of the country,
Solsby said.
</P>
<P>
   Rogan is an ardent supporter of the Internet tax moratorium,
Solsby said. The Internet Tax Freedom Act Internet businesses,
including the giant online bookseller Amazon.com, gives a pass on
new or discriminatory taxes until October 2001.
</P>
<P>
   Solsby predicted the technology and e-commerce lobbyists would
put pressure on Davis to veto the bill and might force another
split with the statehouse.

SWIMMER CARVIN OVERCOMES DEPRESSION, SUICIDE ATTEMPT
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By KAREN CROUSE  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PASADENA, Calif. _ Swimmer Chad Carvin had a bad practice the
other day. It's bound to happen when you're treating your muscles
like old buildings that need to be razed to make way for something
sleeker and more staggering.
</P>
<P>
   Carvin was breaking down his body in order to build it back up
so it'll be stronger by the time he gets to Sydney. Ensconced here
with the rest of the 48-member U.S. Olympic swimming squad, the
Mission Viejo standout has been covering almost as many miles as a
migrating whale does in a day and he was exhausted.
</P>
<P>
   So there were simple physiological reasons why Carvin was
struggling through his interval training at the Rose Bowl Aquatics
Center the other morning and going much slower than he felt was
satisfactory.
</P>
<P>
   Carvin, who will compete in the 400-meter freestyle and the 800
freestyle relay in Sydney, knew that. But he had complex
psychological reasons for panicking anyway.
</P>
<P>
   In the fall of 1995, when Carvin was far and away America's best
middle-distance swimmer, his times started tailing off in practice.
His poor performances sent him into a downward spiral that resulted
in a well thought out (but, thankfully, poorly executed) suicide
attempt that December.
</P>
<P>
   Carvin, 26, had convinced himself he was going crazy, that his
poor swimming was psychosomatic. It was only when he was in a
Tucson, Ariz., hospital having a fistful of sleeping pills pumped
from his stomach that doctors ran the tests that revealed his
problem: A virus had attacked his heart, which was operating at 28
percent capacity.
</P>
<P>
   As soon as Carvin realized there was a logical explanation for
his fatigue, he felt better. He bypassed the 1996 Olympic Trials to
allow his heart time to repair itself, but he was back swimming -
and winning - by the end of the year.
</P>
<P>
   He thought his dark days were behind him.
</P>
<P>
   In 1997 Carvin became the first man since Mark Spitz to win four
individual titles at a U.S. Nationals. He was back on top of the
world.
</P>
<P>
   And then, in December of that year he started feeling horrible
and helpless again.
</P>
<P>
   He was diagnosed with a bulging disk in his back and found
himself entertaining the same suicidal thoughts as before. That's
when Carvin realized his problems went much deeper than his disk.
</P>
<P>
   He had been suffering from clinical depression and didn't know
it. Or rather, he hadn't chosen to consider it until his own morbid
thoughts scared him into resurrecting feelings and issues that had
long been buried.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I started having the same thoughts and feelings as
before, I realized I couldn't conquer them unless I got help,''
Carvin said the other day in an interview at the hotel where the
U.S. team is sequestered until Saturday, when it leaves for
Australia.
</P>
<P>
   Clinical depression is not rare, just rarely talked about. Some
15 million Americans suffer from it at any given time. That means
roughly 5 percent of the population knows the kind of despair that
has gripped Carvin.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the fact one person in six will experience a serious
depressive episode at some point in life, clinical depression
remains a scarlet-letter sickness. Society insinuates that
depression is a sign of weakness and so its sufferers often feel
stigmatized.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you've never had problems like that, it's hard to relate,''
Carvin admitted. ``I know I was the exact same way in my life
before. If someone was going through a down period, I'd be like,
'C'mon, toughen up a little bit.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Nobody thinks twice about going to a dentist for a toothache.
But when your very soul is what's throbbing, it's not so easy to
take the logical step and seek professional help.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was hesitant about seeking psychotherapy for that reason,''
Carvin said. ``It's hard to get past thinking that someone going
through psychotherapy must be nuts.''
</P>
<P>
   The athletic culture doesn't make it any easier. In sports,
suffering is seen as just another opponent the strong must conquer
in order to survive. Then there's the unspoken macho creed, Carvin
said, which makes it clear male athletes aren't supposed to have
feelings, much less give in to them.
</P>
<P>
   Though he has been mining his feelings with the help of a
psychotherapist for the past two years, ``I still have that
mentality,'' Carvin admitted. ``I still fight it.''
</P>
<P>
   That's why the bad workout the other day packed a punch. Carvin
had to bob and weave around the inner voice that wondered if maybe
the workout wasn't a sign that his body was about to fail him again
in some way, that it was, as he put it, ``the start of something I
couldn't get through.''
</P>
<P>
   His circumstances are different now, of course, and that's his
salvation. Carvin has people who can talk him through his anxiety.
He is strong enough to be able to call out his insecurities so they
no longer have the power to hurt him.
</P>
<P>
   The day after his bad workout, he went body surfing in Laguna
Beach with a few other swimmers on the Olympic team. Depression no
longer is holding him back.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's easier every day I talk about it,'' Carvin said.
</P>
<P>
   He was a finance major at the University of Arizona but now he
sees himself working with people, not numbers.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want to look into being a spokesman for mental health,'' he
said. ``I'm not here on some kind of crusade. I just want to let
people who are suffering from clinical depression know they aren't
alone. That's the biggest message I want to deliver. When you're
struggling, it's OK to talk to people, no matter what those
feelings are.''

VIDEO GAME COMPANY PAYS FOR PLAY
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By ROBERT MONROE 
c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News 
<TEXT>
<P>
   CALABASAS, Calif. _ When Jim Boone was growing up, he and his
fellow video game addicts figured you gotta be some kind of genius
to have created titles like Space Invaders and Tempest.
</P>
<P>
   Never did they think they could crack that world.
</P>
<P>
   The 28-year-old thinks upon this as he puts the finishing
touches on Summoner, a swords and sorcery game being launched with
Sony's PlayStation 2 on Oct. 26. He is senior producer at THQ, the
video game company that has brought you titles like WWF
Wrestlemania 2000.
</P>
<P>
   Boone took a few community college courses _ he meant to become
a firefighter _ but he was schooled by Atari, ColecoVision and
IntelliVision. Now he looks back and laughs at his serendipitous
rise. His parents look back and laugh too.
</P>
<P>
   ``They'd say, You play so many video games. It's never going to
help you out getting a job,'' said Boone, a senior producer.
</P>
<P>
   It would seem like a case of arrested development if the job
didn't pay so well. Management salaries range anywhere from $75,000
to $150,000 in the industry and designers make royalties in the
same manner as recording artists.
</P>
<P>
   That and the incredibly high stakes of the business are the
reminders that there's a job behind the fun. Video games are an
industry in which companies rise and fall daily based on things
like market share and share price.
</P>
<P>
   The journey to Boone's office through the development section of
THQ headquarters is like a trip through a sci-fi convention. The
cubicles, draped in all manner of toys and video game controllers,
resemble vendor booths and they're all populated by
twenty-somethings wearing baggy cargo pants.
</P>
<P>
   ``As soon as this starts feeling like a job, people will
leave,'' said Boone's boss, Vice President of Product Development
Michael Rubinelli.
</P>
<P>
   So Rubinelli wasn't too surprised to walk down the hall at 12:30
a.m. Wednesday and find Boone still hard at work reviewing
Summoner.
</P>
<P>
   ``He had no shoes on, his feet up on the desk,'' said Rubinelli.
</P>
<P>
   And that was OK even at a company Boone said is considered
somewhat conservative by video game industry standards. Employees
(begin italics) must (end italics) wear long pants.
</P>
<P>
   The culture is why Boone doesn't mind the late hours and why
stress doesn't register. Play and work are one to him.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the end, we're still making video games,'' he said. ``We're
not making defense systems or something like that.''

<P>
   On Monday in a steamy union hall in Chicago, some 1,300 rowdy
Democrats roared the now-ritualistic chant ``Go, Joe, go!'' as
Mayor Richard M. Daley and the other big wheels of the Chicago
Democratic machine escorted Sen. Joseph Lieberman to the stage.
</P>
<P>
   Handing his rumpled jacket to an aide, Lieberman began a folksy
stump speech that was interrupted by applause, laughter and more
chanting. When he stepped off the stage to shake hands, people
surged forward. Men clapped him on the back. Women leaned in with
kisses and whispered words of encouragement in Hebrew.
</P>
<P>
   The next morning, 400 miles away in Kansas City, Mo., fewer than
75 people waited for Dick Cheney, the Republican nominee for vice
president, to speak at the headquarters of Fellowship of Christian
Athletes. Most of those in the audience were employees of the
organization. They sat in polite silence. There were no campaign
signs. Cheney and his wife, Lynne, entered the hall unannounced;
for a painful minute, there was no response until a few people up
front realized they ought to clap.
</P>
<P>
   A few introductory speakers talked about the importance of faith
and abstinence, and Mike Sweeney, first baseman for the Kansas City
Royals, gave Cheney a jersey. Another moment of awkward silence
followed before Cheney began a brief, low-key speech about teaching
children the importance of character. ``It's about what you do when
nobody is looking.'' Then he sat back down to brief, low-key
applause.
</P>
<P>
   With Vice President Al Gore and Gov. George W. Bush of Texas
entering a crucial phase of their race for the White House, their
running mates are waging starkly different campaigns as they strike
out on their own for the first time since each party's national
convention.
</P>
<P>
   Cheney, who has confronted questions about his health, his
voting record in Congress and his multimillion-dollar retirement
package from a major oil services corporation, has largely kept a
low profile, staging small events, sticking to a familiar speech
script and generally staying clear of reporters from national news
organizations.
</P>
<P>
   Lieberman has been more active, drawing far larger crowds and
attracting _ indeed courting _ more media coverage. On Monday in
Chicago, his motorcade included two vans filled with reporters,
most from national news organizations, who are flying with him on
his campaign airplane. Cheney's campaign has no accommodations for
a traveling press corps at this time. National reporters follow his
campaign by taking commercial flights and taxicabs to his events.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, when Cheney finally took questions from the national
press corps on the last day of a three-day trip through California
and Oregon, he found only three journalists facing him. ``Why do I
need a press secretary if I've only got three?'' he said jokingly
to his press secretary, Dirk Vande Beek.
</P>
<P>
   After his event on Tuesday, Cheney paused briefly to take
questions from reporters. When one tried to ask a follow-up
question, Cheney cut her off, saying, ``You had your question.''
</P>
<P>
   After four questions, Vande Beek ended the interview. Trying for
a fifth question, a reporter asked Cheney how he planned to
celebrate his 36th wedding anniversary.
</P>
<P>
   ``That,'' Cheney said, ``is a secret.''
</P>
<P>
   He did answer one question about the differences between his
campaign style and Lieberman's.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's sort of in keeping with my quiet, low-key demeanor,''
Cheney said. ``I come from the West. A man of few words. Grew up in
the House of Representatives where we are limited to five minutes
in our speeches. Joe's from Connecticut. He comes from the Senate,
where they make a lot longer speeches.''
</P>
<P>
   But he firmly rejected what has become conventional political
wisdom among even some Republicans _ that while Lieberman is
helping Gore, Cheney is not yet doing the same for Bush, whose
standing in the polls has sagged since his selection of Cheney.
</P>
<P>
   ``People seem to respond favorably to my being on the ticket,''
Cheney said, adding, ``I don't want to take personal credit or
blame for what happens in the polls.''
</P>
<P>
   But if Cheney's taste for the low profile sometimes fails to
grab headlines or move polls, Lieberman's high-profile appearances
have risks of their own.
</P>
<P>
   Lieberman demonstrated this on Sunday in Detroit, when his
assertion that religion is the basis of morality drew a strong
rebuke from the Anti-Defamation League, atheists and groups that
advocate a strict separation of church and state.
</P>
<P>
   An earlier high-profile appearance before the black caucus of
the Democratic National Committee served to highlight Lieberman's
past differences with black leaders about affirmative action and
school vouchers.
</P>
<P>
   Cheney's restrained style, meanwhile, reinforces what many
consider to be his strongest contribution to Bush: his reputation
as a senior statesman with the depth of experience to offset Bush's
relative lack of exposure to military issues, foreign affairs and
the ways of Congress.
</P>
<P>
   Cheney's understatement has also added a quiet potency to his
criticisms of Gore and President Clinton, not to mention his calls
for a restoration of honor in the Oval Office, a line that drew
roars of approval from party stalwarts at the Republican National
Convention in Philadelphia.
</P>
<P>
   Only Wednesday, in a campaign event in Atlanta, Cheney drew on
his experience as secretary of defense in the Bush administration
to accuse Clinton and Gore of presiding over a military that is
``overused and under-resourced.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Since 1990,'' he said, ``America has pursued a strategy that
would allow us to fight two wars simultaneously, and win both
decisively, with the lowest possible risk to our troops.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yet just last fall, the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff
testified that the risk involved in two wars has increased, and
would now be `moderate' risk in the first, and `high' risk in the
second. And how would that risk be measured? Ultimately, it's
measured in the lives of our troops.''
</P>
<P>
   Lieberman has also chosen to adopt an understated tone when
laying into Bush and Cheney. He usually sets up his sharpest
criticisms by first declaring that both men are ``decent and
honorable.'' And after he delivers a zinger, he tends to soften the
blow by smiling and raising his eyebrows, as if to ask, ``Wasn't
that a good one?''
</P>
<P>
   But on the stump, Lieberman differs most from Cheney in his
eagerness to place his life story at the center of his political
message. He never fails to remind audiences that he is the son of a
bakery truck driver, that his wife's parents escaped the death
camps in Germany, and the communists in Czechoslovakia, that he was
the first person in his family to graduate from college, that he
went to Mississippi in 1963 to fight for voting rights for black
people.
</P>
<P>
   At nearly every stop he speaks of his religion, and about how
his status as the first Jew on a presidential ticket means that
``doors of opportunity'' have opened for all who have faced
discrimination.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Cheney is not nearly so effusive. After he addressed a chapter
of the Future Farmers of America at Crater High School in Medford,
Ore., a student asked him what most politicians would consider the
easiest of softballs.
</P>
<P>
   ``My question for you is, who are you?'' the boy asked. ``What
do you like to do on the weekends? What are your hobbies, and where
do you like to travel?''
</P>
<P>
   Cheney might have used the moment to tell some dramatic stories
about perhaps his greatest professional triumph, victory in the
Gulf War as President George Bush's secretary of defense.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, he gave a bare-bones recitation of his resume _ schools
attended, jobs held, place of birth, number of children and
grandchildren, the latter ``a very important part of our lives.''
</P>
<P>
   Hobbies? ``You can usually find me if I have some time off with
either a fly rod or a shotgun in my hand.'' And that was about it.
</P>
<P>
   A spokeswoman for Cheney, Juleanna Glover Weiss, said Wednesday
that Cheney would soon play a more visible role on the campaign
trail.
</P>
<P>
   Weiss said reporters would be able to fly with Cheney sometime
next week, when he expects to inherit the Boeing 727 that Bush has
been using for his campaigning.
</P>
<P>
   ``Secretary Cheney looks forward to many long and fruitful
conversations with the national reporters in the back of the
plane,'' she said. ``He's one of those guys that the more you see,
the more you like.''
</P>
<P>
   But the larger question is whether Cheney will prove capable of
forging a critical bond with his audiences over the next months.
Can he, through force of personality or the power of his oratory,
do what the best politicians do: turn a 10-minute stump speech into
a moment of magic that translates into votes won?
</P>
<P>
   At the Kansas City event, before a crowd that was mostly
receptive to his message, Cheney failed that test.
</P>
<P>
   While his wife, Lynne, approached the front row to shake a few
hands after his speech, Cheney lingered behind the lectern.
</P>
<P>
   ``Somebody tell us what to do,'' an elderly woman said a few
rows back, uncertain if it was all right to leave.
</P>
<P>
   Just then the woman noticed a man pushing his way out the back
of the hall. ``There's a leader,'' she said to her friends. ``We'll
follow him.''

EWING FOR HOWARD IS LATEST TALK 
</HEADLINE>
  By CHRIS BROUSSARD   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   One week after the collapse of a four-way trade that would have
sent Patrick Ewing to Seattle, the Knicks have renewed efforts to
trade the future Hall of Fame center.
</P>
<P>
   In what appears to be more evidence of a nearly irreconcilable
chasm between Ewing and New York, the Knicks have discussed sending
Ewing to the Washington Wizards for Juwan Howard, two Eastern
Conference officials said.
</P>
<P>
   No deal is imminent, but according to NBAofficials, Washington
would jump at making the move. If the Wizards received Ewing, who
has one year and $14 million remaining on his contract, they could
potentially be $10 million beneath the salary cap next summer and
vie for a top-flight free agent such as Michael Finley, Dikembe
Mutombo or Chris Webber.
</P>
<P>
   Why the Knicks would make such a trade is less clear. Howard is
coming off the worst season of his six-year career. On a team that
underachieved from start to finish, Howard averaged 14.9 points and
5.7 rebounds and, on several occasions, was booed lustily by his
home fans. If Howard, a 6-foot-9-inch forward who is not
particularly powerful or graceful, could return to the form that
saw him average 19.3 points and 7.9 rebounds over his first five
seasons, he could be productive.
</P>
<P>
   The Knicks and the Wizards have spoken about a deal for Ewing
several times over the past year, including two weeks ago before
the Knicks put together the foiled four-team, 13-player trade that
would have sent Ewing to the Seattle SuperSonics. During those
discussions, the Wizards' president, Michael Jordan, rebuffed a
Knicks offer that included Larry Johnson and Chris Dudley because
he felt the Knicks were trying to dump multiple big-money,
long-term contracts onto his team. After the trade collapsed, the
Knicks rekindled talks on a more realistic and less ambitious
scale.
</P>
<P>
   But the Knicks would still have only Marcus Camby and Chris
Dudley at the center position. And they would be an even weaker
rebounding team than they were last season, when they finished 24th
overall in rebounding and dead last on the offensive end. Giving up
Ewing for Howard certainly would not make the Knicks a threat to
the new-look Miami Heat, which acquired Brian Grant from Portland
Wednesday in a three-team deal that sent Shawn Kemp from Cleveland
to Portland and Chris Gatling, Clarence Weatherspoon and Gary Grant
from Miami to Cleveland.
</P>
<P>
   There has been speculation that a Ewing-for-Howard trade would
lead to a second move, in which the Knicks would send Camby and
Allan Houston to the Atlanta Hawks for the All-Star center, Dikembe
Mutombo. But an official with the Hawks said Wednesday that no such
deal has been discussed.
</P>
<P>
   Neither Knicks General Manager Scott Layden nor Coach Jeff Van
Gundy could be reached for comment, but Layden said last week that
the Knicks, working in concert with Ewing and his agent, David
Falk, would continue to explore trade opportunities that benefited
both the team and the player.
</P>
<P>
   But few deals that would meet that criteria seem to be possible.
The Phoenix Suns, whom Ewing would approve a trade to, are not
willing to dismantle their promising young nucleus for the
38-year-old Ewing, and few other teams are willing to give up top
talent to take on his salary.
</P>
<P>
   While a deal with Washington might be the Knicks only realistic
chance for a trade, even it does not fit the description given by
Layden. If Ewing is sincere in his quest for a championship, he
will not want to spend a season in Washington, where the Wizards
have no chance of winning the East. And it is doubtful that the
Wizards would re-sign Ewing for two more years after next season.
</P>
<P>
   The talks between the Knicks and the Wizards seems to be a clear
indication of the enormous disgust that Ewing has developed for the
Knicks and New York City.
</P>
<P>
   Those close to Ewing say he was deeply hurt by the negative
response of the news media and the fans to his being traded last
week, and even before his public censure, his acceptance of a trade
to Seattle, where neither a contract extension nor a finals
appearance was likely, pointed to his simply wanting to leave New
York.
</P>
<P>
   While playing in Washington will not pit Ewing, who lives in
nearby Potomac, Md., during the off season, against Indiana or
Miami in the second round of the playoffs, it would allow him to
close out his career in the city of his collegiate glory
(Georgetown) alongside a close friend (Jordan).
</P>
<P>
   These talks may be a sign that Ewing has told the Knicks to
trade him or else, that he no longer wants to be the third
offensive wheel on a team he once ruled.

200,000 HOUSES IN CHICAGO TO BE INSPECTED FOR MERCURY 
 
</HEADLINE>
  c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHICAGO _ The company that sells natural gas to people across
much of northern Illinois plans to inspect as many as 200,000
suburban Chicago homes for traces of mercury, having discovered it
in 44 during a preliminary investigation.
</P>
<P>
   The company, Nicor Gas of nearby Naperville, Ill., will inspect
houses where workers may have spilled liquid mercury while removing
natural-gas meters that were being updated in a project that has
been under way in the northwest suburbs for a decade. Before 1961,
in a practice that was once common, two teaspoons of elemental
mercury, or quicksilver, was placed in Nicor meters to regulate the
flow of natural gas.
</P>
<P>
   In its liquid form, elemental mercury, the type in the meters,
is not nearly so dangerous as organic mercury, or methylmercury,
which can cause extreme levels of toxicity in lakes and fish. As a
liquid, elemental mercury is slow to be absorbed through the skin
and into the bloodstream.
</P>
<P>
   As a vapor, however, elemental mercury rapidly enters the
bloodstream once breathed in. It can then cause disorders ranging
from hand tremors and appetite loss to vast brain and kidney
damage.
</P>
<P>
   A Chicago spokeswoman for the Environmental Protection Agency
said the number of residences to be inspected by Nicor apparently
made this the largest single search for toxicity in the home that a
company had ever undertaken. The spokeswoman, Phillippa Cannon,
said that she had been speaking to colleagues at the agency's
headquarters in Washington and that no one there ``is aware of
anything this big.''
</P>
<P>
   The mercury scare began on July 20, when a Nicor customer
reported the presence of a silvery substance in his basement. Since
then, the company has been testing for mercury in hundreds of
houses, and in some cases finding it. As of Tuesday morning,
inspectors had been to 358 homes, with 44 testing positive and 314
negative.
</P>
<P>
   Nicor at first attributed the leaks to the faulty work of an
outside contractor that the company had hired to work on the
meter-updating project. But then a crew detected mercury in a home
where Nicor employees themselves had removed the meter. As a
result, the number of suspect homes leaped overnight, to 200,000
from 200.
</P>
<P>
   Inspecting that many homes will take six months, Nicor said,
although a company spokesman, Lee Haines, could not estimate the
cost of the inspections and cleanups combined. Varying conditions
in the home, Haines said, will cause costs of a cleanup to differ
from house to house.
</P>
<P>
   Daphne Magnuson, a spokeswoman for the American Gas Association,
said it appeared that most gas utilities had already replaced their
mercury-containing meters, in updating programs that began in the
1970s.
</P>
<P>
   Magnuson noted that those programs had nothing to do with any
concern about the mercury. The old meters were replaced, she said,
in favor of new technology that made the readings more precise.

   Whirlpool Lowers Forecast, Reflecting Industry Anxiety
</P>
<P>
   Whirlpool, the nation's largest maker of home appliances, warned
that its profit would be sharply lower than expected in the second
half of the year, partly because of Circuit City's decision to stop
selling major appliances at its retail outlets. Whirlpool also
blamed an industrywide slowdown and fierce price competition that
is cutting into profit margins. Much of the downturn in the home
appliance market is attributed to slumping retail sales and a
weakening housing market.

   Gap Says Sales in August To Decline a Surprising 14 Percent
</P>
<P>
   The Gap stunned investors by announcing after the stock market
closed that sales in stores open at least a year, a key industry
measurement, would decline 14 percent in August, well below what
most analysts expected. The Gap's announcement is more remarkable
because it comes after a series of highly atypical stumbles. The
company had a rare earnings disappointment in the first quarter,
and then announced a more pronounced earnings shortfall in the
second quarter and predicted that earnings would be lower than
analysts expected for the entire year.

   Mexico Ordered to Pay Damages
</P>
<P>
   An international tribunal that worked to arbitrate a
cross-border dispute between an American company, Metalclad, and
the Mexican government ordered Mexico to pay nearly $17 million in
damages. Citing investor protection provisions of the North
American Free Trade Agreement, the tribunal found that the
government's actions amounted to an expropriation because they
prevented Metalclad from enjoying the full use of the hazardous

Metalclad rose 6 cents, to $4.31.

ARTHUR F. ANDERS, HERO   ABOARD U.S. GUNBOAT IN 1937, DIES AT 96 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Attn: Texas, Calif., Wash., Md., China, Japan)   By ERIC PACE   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Arthur F. Anders, an officer of the U.S. Navy gunboat Panay who
took command despite serious wounds after Japanese warplanes
attacked it on the Yangtze River in China in 1937, died on Sunday
at his home in Rancho Bernardo, Calif. He was 96.
</P>
<P>
   Anders, nicknamed Tex, was a lieutenant and the Panay's
executive officer when the attack, which became known as the Panay
incident, came on a clear Sunday, Dec. 12, 1937. It was an ominous
event in the turbulent years preceding World War II. Japan had
invaded China in July of that year, and its troops had seized
Nanjing, on the Yangtze in east central China, in November.
</P>
<P>
   Anders, whose deeds that day won him the Navy Cross and the
Purple Heart, recalled in a 1989 interview that at first, ``the
Japanese government said bad visibility was the cause'' of the
attack on the Panay, but that the assault ``was deliberate and
planned.''
</P>
<P>
   Japan later apologized for the attack and offered reparations.
</P>
<P>
   The Panay, clearly marked as a U.S. vessel, was 27 miles above
Nanjing when the incident began. In his 1989 interview, Anders
recalled: ``That Sunday on the Panay we had just had our chicken
dinner. We heard Japanese heavy bombers coming. It wasn't a new
sound. They were hitting the Chinese ashore,'' but ``the Japanese
hadn't struck us. America was neutral.''
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, ``this time the heavy bombers didn't wing past us
and hit the Chinese onshore,'' Anders, who had retired from the
Navy, added. ``The three heavies came at us. And they were followed
by six dive bombers.''
</P>
<P>
   The Japanese warplanes bombed and strafed the Panay, seriously
wounding its captain, Lt. Cmdr. James J. Hughes.
</P>
<P>
   Taking to the bridge, Anders, whose hands were wounded, gave an
order for the Panay's machine guns to open fire on the planes. He
then suffered a shrapnel wound to the throat, which forced him to
give orders in writing _ including one, with the gunboat gravely
damaged, to abandon ship.
</P>
<P>
   Accounts of the casualties in the Panay incident differ. Anders'
son, William, a retired major general of the Air Force, said on
Tuesday that the only people killed on the Panay that day were a
crew member and an Italian journalist.
</P>
<P>
   Writing of the incident in 1963, a University of California
historian, Alexander De Conde, said: ``The American people, after a
brief burst of warlike anger, took the matter relatively calmly.
The crisis passed within a few weeks. Nonetheless, it showed how
precarious peace was, even for the United States.''
</P>
<P>
   Tex Anders was born in Weimar, Texas, graduated from the U.S.
Naval Academy in 1927 and served on naval vessels in Central
American and Asian waters before the Panay incident.
</P>
<P>
   His wife, Muriel Adams Anders, died in 1990.
</P>
<P>
   He is survived by his son, William Anders, of Deer Harbor,
Wash., who was an astronaut in Apollo 8 when it circled the moon in
1968; a brother, Edgar Anders of La Grange, Tex.; six
grandchildren; six great-grandchildren; and his companion, Marian
Hamburg of Rancho Bernardo.

instructors say that many do-it-yourselfers don't know how to drive

   MOSCOW _ Muscovites were thrown back to the pre-electronic age
Tuesday after the devastating fire at the Ostankino television
tower, which knocked most of their TV channels off the air.
</P>
<P>
   The body of a third victim, trapped in an elevator which
plummeted during the blaze, was identified, but all but close
relatives of the dead were more concerned about how they would cope
with the loss of news and entertainment programs to which they had
become addicted.
</P>
<P>
   The authorities were exploring ways of resuming normal service
as soon as possible. One idea was to use the spire of Moscow State
University, one of the seven famous ``wedding cake'' skyscrapers
built under Stalin, for broadcasting. Another was to attach
transmitters to dirigibles.
</P>
<P>
   Independent NTV had already found a partial solution by
transferring its programs to the TNT channel, which did not rely on
Ostankino, and it offered to make room for the pro-Kremlin channels
there as well. But the offer was sniffily rejected.
</P>
<P>
   Watching NTV on TNT was only an option for a small number of
Moscow's 10 million inhabitants, however, as reception was
impossible in the built-up inner city.
</P>
<P>
   It was ironic that the Russian provinces, often seen as
languishing in the Stone Age compared with go-ahead Moscow, were
receiving television broadcasts while most viewers in the capital
could see nothing on their screens but snow.
</P>
<P>
   ``And we haven't even had a coup,'' quipped my friend, Vitaly.
His 17-year-old son, Kirill, was in a black depression.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is terrible,'' he said. ``I don't know how I'm going to
live from now on.'' ``Well, you could see it as a chance to catch
up on all that history you still have not read,'' said Vitaly.
``I'm not going to do that,'' snorted the teenager. ``You'll have
to get me the Internet now.''

   Time was when Russia, along with Iceland, had the highest

   MOSCOW _ Muscovites were thrown back to the pre-electronic age
Tuesday after the devastating fire at the Ostankino television
tower, which knocked most of their TV channels off the air.
</P>
<P>
   The body of a third victim, trapped in an elevator which
plummeted during the blaze, was identified, but all but close
relatives of the dead were more concerned about how they would cope
with the loss of news and entertainment programs to which they had
become addicted.
</P>
<P>
   The authorities were exploring ways of resuming normal service
as soon as possible. One idea was to use the spire of Moscow State
University, one of the seven famous ``wedding cake'' skyscrapers
built under Stalin, for broadcasting. Another was to attach
transmitters to dirigibles.
</P>
<P>
   Independent NTV had already found a partial solution by
transferring its programs to the TNT channel, which did not rely on
Ostankino, and it offered to make room for the pro-Kremlin channels
there as well. But the offer was sniffily rejected.
</P>
<P>
   Watching NTV on TNT was only an option for a small number of
Moscow's 10 million inhabitants, however, as reception was
impossible in the built-up inner city.
</P>
<P>
   It was ironic that the Russian provinces, often seen as
languishing in the Stone Age compared with go-ahead Moscow, were
receiving television broadcasts while most viewers in the capital
could see nothing on their screens but snow.
</P>
<P>
   ``And we haven't even had a coup,'' quipped my friend, Vitaly.
His 17-year-old son, Kirill, was in a black depression.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is terrible,'' he said. ``I don't know how I'm going to
live from now on.'' ``Well, you could see it as a chance to catch
up on all that history you still have not read,'' said Vitaly.
``I'm not going to do that,'' snorted the teenager. ``You'll have
to get me the Internet now.''
</P>
<P>
   Time was when Russia, along with Iceland, had the highest
literacy rates and the most avid readers in the world. The
Icelanders read because of the dark winters. The Russians read
because Soviet television, with its endless reports of Brezhnev
speeches and bumper grain harvests, was unwatchable.
</P>

 &UR; (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) &LR;  &QC;
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ When the Republican presidential nominee, George W.
Bush, named Richard Cheney to be his running mate four weeks ago,
there were quips from Bush-critics that the ticket was the wrong
way around.
</P>
<P>
   Was not Cheney, a former White House chief of staff and
respected defense secretary during the Gulf War, better equipped to
be president than the one-and-a-half-term governor of Texas, George
Bush?
</P>
<P>
   Now, though, with opinion polls showing Bush and his Democratic
opponent, Vice President Al Gore, running neck and neck into the
crucial Labor Day weekend, that same Cheney is looking increasingly
like a liability for the Bush ticket.
</P>
<P>
   A series of missteps has called into question Cheney's political
acumen and last Sunday, as the two nominees took a rare weekend off
from campaigning, the Republican candidate for vice president found
himself in the hot seat of the television talk shows, trying to
limit the damage.
</P>
<P>
   One of the thorniest problems concerns a possible conflict of
interest relating to the position he has just relinquished as chief
executive of the Texas oil equipment company, Halliburton.
</P>
<P>
   Not only was he awarded a multimillion-dollar retirement package
_ which he says is standard for the industry, even though he broke
the terms of his contract by leaving early _ but he continues to
hold share options which cannot be exercised for another two years.
</P>
<P>
   So far, Cheney has refused to countenance giving up the options,
nor did he do so Sunday, saying only that he had advisers working
on ways that the appearance of any conflict of interest could be
avoided.
</P>
<P>
   So long as the share option problem persists, Cheney draws
attention to his (and Bush's) ties with what Gore derides as ``big
oil,'' and perpetuates a view that there is one law for the rich
and another for ordinary people.
</P>
<P>
   The government experience Cheney was supposed to bring to the
Republican ticket is also turning out to be counterproductive.
</P>
<P>
   When Bush attacked the state of the country's armed forces,
blaming the Clinton-Gore administration for underfunding the
military, the one-time defense secretary was not on hand to back
him up. (He was actually honing his blunted campaign skills,
reading ``The Hungry Caterpillar'' to elementary school children.)
</P>
<P>
   As Democrats delighted in pointing out, it was Cheney who had
decreed the biggest cuts in military spending _ holding out the
prospect of a 25 percent cut as the post-Cold War ``peace
dividend'' _ during the administration of Bush's father.
</P>
<P>
   Responding for the first time Sunday, Cheney quoted figures to
show certain branches of the military slashed by almost half in
recent years, but he had no answer to the central charge.
</P>
<P>
   Before his television appearances last weekend, Cheney's
contributions to the Bush campaign had been alternately invisible
and clumsy.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, he even suggested that a Bush administration might
reverse some of Clinton's orders designating new national parks: a
proposal that only reinforced the Democrats' portrayal of the
Republican candidate as anti-environment and pro-big business.
</P>
<P>
   And when he appeared on television Sunday _ at 6 a.m. local time
from his vacation home in Wyoming _ he flouted the weekend
political dress code, appearing overly formal in dark suit and tie.
</P>
<P>
   Conventional wisdom has it that a running mate has no impact on
the success or otherwise of a presidential ticket _ an argument
apparently borne out by the Bush-Quayle victory in 1988.
</P>
<P>
   This year, both candidates chose running mates who could
compensate for deficiencies in their own character or records. Of
the two, however, MrGore's choice of Joseph Lieberman seems so far
the more successful.
</P>
<P>
   Warm, relaxed and politically sharp, Lieberman has shown himself
an accomplished solo performer as well as a supportive team player.
</P>
<P>
   Cheney, in contrast, seems cool and aloof, hardly part of a
joint ticket at all, and his experience of high office is proving
to be as much burden as boon.
</P>
<P>
   A running mate may not save or sink the ticket, but a bad choice
cannot but reflect poorly on the candidate's judgment. &QL;

<P>
   ERIE, Pa. _ Fighting to regain momentum against Democratic foe
Al Gore, George W. Bush on Wednesday accused the Clinton-Gore
administration of failing to provide leadership on health care and
tax relief.
</P>
<P>
   The Republican presidential nominee had planned this week to
showcase his educational achievements as Texas governor and promote
education initiatives. And he reviewed his educational priorities
in speeches here and in New Hampshire, but he also has been forced
to address distractions.
</P>
<P>
   First, Bush watched a double-digit lead over Gore evaporate in
voter polls. Then he found himself embroiled in a controversy over
health care and presidential debates. And finally, he faced even
more bad news on Wednesday _ a federal court finding that his home
state has been deficient in providing health care to low-income
children on Medicaid.
</P>
<P>
   He denied suggestions that he had been forced into a defensive
posture. ``I feel like I'm making good progress getting my message
out. I feel very comfortable about it,'' he said. But he also went
on the attack.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a lot of talk in this campaign, but it's time to get
leadership in Washington who will get something done,'' Bush said
at an airport rally on arriving in Erie, a key center in a
battleground state.
</P>
<P>
   On the other side of the country, Vice President Gore and his
running mate, Sen. Joseph Lieberman, D-Conn., campaigned together
in Oregon, continued to push their health care proposals and
accused Bush of being unwilling to guarantee the sanctity of future
Medicare funding.
</P>
<P>
   Gore said the Republicans want to use the federal budget surplus
on a tax cut mostly benefiting the wealthy. ``Their theory is
that's going to be good for the country, and they say it's your
money,'' Gore said. ``Well, it is your money, but it's your
Medicare.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore is proposing removing Medicare from the federal budget so
that future surpluses can't be used to cover other expenses. By
doing so, Gore estimates that $400 million over the next 10 years
could go to strengthening Medicare.
</P>
<P>
   The Democratic contenders have criticized Bush for failing to
commit to similar protective measures, and for declining so far to
outline specifics of his own health care plan. Bush has said he
will detail his proposals on health care next week.
</P>
<P>
   Appearing Wednesday morning on CNN, where he fielded questions
posed over the Internet, Bush reiterated his charge that the
Clinton administration squandered its chances to reform Medicare
and Social Security.
</P>
<P>
   ``This administration has had seven years to get something
done.'' Bush has said he favors a bipartisan congressional proposal
to give Medicaid beneficiaries the option of selecting from a range
of private health plans that would include drug coverage.
</P>
<P>
   In a town hall meeting at Portland State University in Oregon,
Gore said he is against that plan because it would raise premiums
for coverage, force seniors into health maintenance organizations
against their will, and raise the eligibility age for Medicare from
65 years to 67 years.
</P>
<P>
   Lieberman in the past has supported raising the eligibility for
Medicare. Since accepting the slot as vice presidential running
mate, Lieberman has said he is deferring to Gore on such policy
positions.
</P>
<P>
   He reiterated Gore's contention that Republican tax cuts could
benefit wealthier Americans at the expense of the lower and middle
classes. ``There's nothing wrong with being rich. In America
everybody dreams of being rich,'' he said. ``But the fact is that
if we've got this kind of surplus, we shouldn't give it most to
those who need it least, and least to those who need it most.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush sought to claim the tax issue himself Wednesday, citing
what he said were broken promises after President Clinton and Gore
were elected.
</P>
<P>
   ``It reminded me of 1992 all over again. Remember the
(Democratic) promises to give the middle class tax relief?'' he
asked the audience in Erie.
</P>
<P>
   ``Upon election the middle class didn't get tax relief. They got
a tax increase,'' he added.
</P>
<P>
   A spokesman said Bush was referring to a federal tax increase
enacted in 1993, the first year of the Clinton-Gore administration.
He said that package raised the gasoline tax, increased the tax on
Social Security benefits and raised the top income tax rates.

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ When the Republican presidential nominee, George W.
Bush, named Richard Cheney to be his running mate four weeks ago,
there were quips from Bush-critics that the ticket was the wrong
way around.
</P>
<P>
   Was not Cheney, a former White House chief of staff and
respected defense secretary during the Gulf War, better equipped to
be president than the one-and-a-half-term governor of Texas, George
Bush?
</P>
<P>
   Now, though, with opinion polls showing Bush and his Democratic
opponent, Vice President Al Gore, running neck and neck into the
crucial Labor Day weekend, that same Cheney is looking increasingly
like a liability for the Bush ticket.
</P>
<P>
   A series of missteps has called into question Cheney's political
acumen and last Sunday, as the two nominees took a rare weekend off
from campaigning, the Republican candidate for vice president found
himself in the hot seat of the television talk shows, trying to
limit the damage.
</P>
<P>
   One of the thorniest problems concerns a possible conflict of
interest relating to the position he has just relinquished as chief
executive of the Texas oil equipment company, Halliburton.
</P>
<P>
   Not only was he awarded a multimillion-dollar retirement package
_ which he says is standard for the industry, even though he broke
the terms of his contract by leaving early _ but he continues to
hold share options which cannot be exercised for another two years.
</P>
<P>
   So far, Cheney has refused to countenance giving up the options,
nor did he do so Sunday, saying only that he had advisers working
on ways that the appearance of any conflict of interest could be
avoided.
</P>
<P>
   So long as the share option problem persists, Cheney draws
attention to his (and Bush's) ties with what Gore derides as ``big
oil,'' and perpetuates a view that there is one law for the rich
and another for ordinary people.
</P>
<P>
   The government experience Cheney was supposed to bring to the
Republican ticket is also turning out to be counterproductive.
</P>
<P>
   When Bush attacked the state of the country's armed forces,
blaming the Clinton-Gore administration for underfunding the
military, the one-time defense secretary was not on hand to back
him up. (He was actually honing his blunted campaign skills,
reading ``The Hungry Caterpillar'' to elementary school children.)
</P>
<P>
   As Democrats delighted in pointing out, it was Cheney who had
decreed the biggest cuts in military spending _ holding out the
prospect of a 25 percent cut as the post-Cold War ``peace
dividend'' _ during the administration of Bush's father.
</P>
<P>
   Responding for the first time Sunday, Cheney quoted figures to
show certain branches of the military slashed by almost half in
recent years, but he had no answer to the central charge.
</P>
<P>
   Before his television appearances last weekend, Cheney's
contributions to the Bush campaign had been alternately invisible
and clumsy.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, he even suggested that a Bush administration might
reverse some of Clinton's orders designating new national parks: a
proposal that only reinforced the Democrats' portrayal of the
Republican candidate as anti-environment and pro-big business.
</P>
<P>
   And when he appeared on television Sunday _ at 6 a.m. local time
from his vacation home in Wyoming _ he flouted the weekend
political dress code, appearing overly formal in dark suit and tie.
</P>
<P>
   Conventional wisdom has it that a running mate has no impact on
the success or otherwise of a presidential ticket _ an argument
apparently borne out by the Bush-Quayle victory in 1988.
</P>
<P>
   This year, both candidates chose running mates who could
compensate for deficiencies in their own character or records. Of
the two, however, MrGore's choice of Joseph Lieberman seems so far
the more successful.
</P>
<P>
   Warm, relaxed and politically sharp, Lieberman has shown himself
an accomplished solo performer as well as a supportive team player.
</P>
<P>
   Cheney, in contrast, seems cool and aloof, hardly part of a
joint ticket at all, and his experience of high office is proving
to be as much burden as boon.
</P>

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ When the Republican presidential nominee, George W.
Bush, named Richard Cheney to be his running mate four weeks ago,
there were quips from Bush-critics that the ticket was the wrong
way around.
</P>
<P>
   Was not Cheney, a former White House chief of staff and
respected defense secretary during the Gulf War, better equipped to
be president than the one-and-a-half-term governor of Texas, George
Bush?
</P>
<P>
   Now, though, with opinion polls showing Bush and his Democratic
opponent, Vice President Al Gore, running neck and neck into the
crucial Labor Day weekend, that same Cheney is looking increasingly
like a liability for the Bush ticket.
</P>
<P>
   A series of missteps has called into question Cheney's political
acumen and last Sunday, as the two nominees took a rare weekend off
from campaigning, the Republican candidate for vice president found
himself in the hot seat of the television talk shows, trying to
limit the damage.
</P>
<P>
   One of the thorniest problems concerns a possible conflict of
interest relating to the position he has just relinquished as chief
executive of the Texas oil equipment company, Halliburton.
</P>
<P>
   Not only was he awarded a multimillion-dollar retirement package
_ which he says is standard for the industry, even though he broke
the terms of his contract by leaving early _ but he continues to
hold share options which cannot be exercised for another two years.
</P>
<P>
   So far, Cheney has refused to countenance giving up the options,
nor did he do so Sunday, saying only that he had advisers working
on ways that the appearance of any conflict of interest could be
avoided.
</P>
<P>
   So long as the share option problem persists, Cheney draws
attention to his (and Bush's) ties with what Gore derides as ``big
oil,'' and perpetuates a view that there is one law for the rich
and another for ordinary people.
</P>
<P>
   The government experience Cheney was supposed to bring to the
Republican ticket is also turning out to be counterproductive.
</P>
<P>
   When Bush attacked the state of the country's armed forces,
blaming the Clinton-Gore administration for underfunding the
military, the one-time defense secretary was not on hand to back
him up. (He was actually honing his blunted campaign skills,
reading ``The Hungry Caterpillar'' to elementary school children.)
</P>
<P>
   As Democrats delighted in pointing out, it was Cheney who had
decreed the biggest cuts in military spending _ holding out the
prospect of a 25 percent cut as the post-Cold War ``peace
dividend'' _ during the administration of Bush's father.
</P>
<P>
   Responding for the first time Sunday, Cheney quoted figures to
show certain branches of the military slashed by almost half in
recent years, but he had no answer to the central charge.
</P>
<P>
   Before his television appearances last weekend, Cheney's
contributions to the Bush campaign had been alternately invisible
and clumsy.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, he even suggested that a Bush administration might
reverse some of Clinton's orders designating new national parks: a
proposal that only reinforced the Democrats' portrayal of the
Republican candidate as anti-environment and pro-big business.
</P>
<P>
   And when he appeared on television Sunday _ at 6 a.m. local time
from his vacation home in Wyoming _ he flouted the weekend
political dress code, appearing overly formal in dark suit and tie.
</P>
<P>
   Conventional wisdom has it that a running mate has no impact on
the success or otherwise of a presidential ticket _ an argument
apparently borne out by the Bush-Quayle victory in 1988.
</P>
<P>
   This year, both candidates chose running mates who could
compensate for deficiencies in their own character or records. Of
the two, however, MrGore's choice of Joseph Lieberman seems so far
the more successful.
</P>
<P>
   Warm, relaxed and politically sharp, Lieberman has shown himself
an accomplished solo performer as well as a supportive team player.
</P>
<P>
   Cheney, in contrast, seems cool and aloof, hardly part of a
joint ticket at all, and his experience of high office is proving
to be as much burden as boon.
</P>
<P>
   A running mate may not save or sink the ticket, but a bad choice
cannot but reflect poorly on the candidate's judgment. &QL;

METS STOP ASTROS AND KEEP SHARE OF FIRST 
</HEADLINE>
  By JACK CURRY   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ There is no fussing so far as Rick Reed is concerned.
He stands on the mound, he receives a sign, he winds up and he
usually throws a pitch that is close to the strike zone. Then Reed
retreats to the pitcher's rubber and repeats the same routine,
eager to keep the game moving and to keep the tempo flowing. Why
waste time?
</P>
<P>
   Reed moved at his swift and efficient pace Wednesday night,
retiring batter after batter against the baffled Houston Astros.
Reed's fastball almost never reaches 90 mph, but he locates all of
his pitches so precisely that the fastball looks more imposing.
That helped make the Astros look helpless.
</P>
<P>
   The Astros did not get a hit off Reed until the fifth inning and
they did not score off him through seven innings as the Mets
tip-toed to a 1-0 victory at Shea Stadium. Chris Holt gave up the
game's only run, in the first inning, when he unleashed a two-out
wild pitch that enabled Benny Agbayani to cruise home. It was a
frustrating way to lose for the Astros, epitomizing their dreary
season.
</P>
<P>
   For the Mets, it was another tidy performance by Reed, who won a
second straight start by allowing three singles, and another day
spent tied for first place in the National League East with the
Atlanta Braves.
</P>
<P>
   The Mets and the Braves, who beat the Cincinnati Reds, 5-2,
Wednesday night, have shared first in the National League East for
the last three days. It is the latest into a season that the Mets
have been in first since they were alone at the top on Sept. 3,
1990.
</P>
<P>
   The fans at Shea Stadium picked up on Reed's no-hit bid in the
fifth and clapped rhythmically when he jumped ahead of Mitch
Meluskey with an 0-2 count. Meluskey hit a grounder toward the
second base hole, but Edgardo Alfonzo took a few steps to his left,
scooped the ball up and flipped to Todd Zeile.
</P>
<P>
   Thirteen outs without a hit, 14 more to go. Reed did not change
his rapid pace on a warm night. He picked up the resin bag a few
times to reduce the perspiration on his fingers, but he continued
working quickly.
</P>
<P>
   Bill Spiers, who was four for 15 against Reed in his career,
worked the count to 3-2. Reed had three strikeouts at that point
and all three had been on fastballs. Would Spiers be expecting a
fastball with a full count? Perhaps Reed thought so. He tossed a
changeup that stayed high and Spiers flicked it into left field for
a single.
</P>
<P>
   With the chance for a no-hitter eliminated, the fans gave Reed a
polite ovation. All Reed did was go back to work. He retired Tim
Bogar on a twisting liner to right field and got Holt to wave at a
curveball for strike three. The Astros finally had their first hit,
but they still looked anemic.
</P>
<P>
   Reed allowed a one-out single to Julio Lugo in the sixth, but
erased him by getting Jeff Bagwell to rap into a
third-to-second-to-first double play. Robin Ventura's throw to
second was below Alfonzo's waist, but he neatly caught the ball and
whipped it on to first. Lance Berkman singled in the seventh, but
Reed anchored him to first by retiring the next three Astros.
</P>
<P>
   For a pitcher with control as precise as Reed, having a plate
umpire like Mark Hirschbeck was like receiving an early birthday
present. Hirschbeck was calling inside strikes so Reed kept trying
to swipe another inch to see how much of the plate he could get.
Reed twice fired called third strikes by the former Met Roger
Cedeno, who jumped back from the plate in animated fashion each
time.
</P>
<P>
   Agbayani, who only looks like a leadoff hitter when someone
stares at his .404 on-base percentage instead of his
5-foot-10-inch, 225-pound body, did what leadoff hitters should do
when he walked in the first. Darryl Hamilton, who probably would
have rested a sore left shoulder if Derek Bell (bruised left knee
and strained left groin) were available, followed with a nifty bunt
single along the third-base line.
</P>
<P>
   Holt induced Alfonzo to slap into a double play. But Holt's
breaking pitches, which are the reason he is second in the league
in securing double plays, were the reason the Mets scored. Holt
bounced a pitch to Mike Piazza that slithered under Meluskey's
glove and enabled Agbayani to chug 90 feet with what became the
only run of the game.
</P>
<P>
   Reed did the rest, routinely, with help from Turk Wendell in the
eighth and Armando Benitez in the ninth.

 - NITZSCHE-NYT  
 (ATTN: Calif., Ill., Mich.)   By JON PARELES   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Jack Nitzsche, an Oscar-winning songwriter, keyboardist and
arranger who worked with musicians like Phil Spector, the Rolling
Stones, Neil Young and Miles Davis, died Aug. 25 in Hollywood. He
was 63 and lived in Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   The cause of death was cardiac arrest brought on by a recurring
bronchial infection, said his son, Jack Nitzsche Jr.
</P>
<P>
   Nitzsche made a career as a prized collaborator, drawing on
idioms as old as the blues and as new as electronic music. He wrote
songs with Buffy Sainte-Marie, who was his wife during the 1980s
(``Up Where We Belong,'' which won an Academy Award as Best Song,
from ``An Officer and a Gentleman''), and with Sonny Bono
(``Needles and Pins,'' a 1964 hit for the Searchers). He played
piano with Neil Young and the Rolling Stones; he arranged full
orchestras or skeletal, atmospheric handfuls of instruments as film
soundtracks or as accompaniments for rock songs.
</P>
<P>
   Bernard Alfred Nitzsche was born in Chicago in 1937, and grew up
on a farm near Newaygo, Mich. He hoped to become a jazz saxophonist
and moved to Los Angeles in 1955, but dropped out of music school.
Bono, who was an artists-and-repertory executive at Specialty
Records, hired him as a copyist. Nitzsche then worked for Capitol
Records, where he met the singer Gracia Ann May, who became his
first wife.
</P>
<P>
   Nitzsche became Phil Spector's arranger in 1962, creating the
thunderous orchestrations of the Wall of Sound for hits that
included the Crystals' ``He's a Rebel,'' ``Da Doo Ron Ron'' and
``Then He Kissed Me''; the Ronettes' ``Be My Baby'' and ``Baby I
Love You''; and Ike and Tina Turner's ``River Deep, Mountain
High.''
</P>
<P>
   During the 1960s he was also a session keyboardist and arranger
for the Rolling Stones, working on their albums from 1964 to 1974,
including ``Let It Bleed'' and ``Sticky Fingers.'' He began a long
association with Neil Young when he orchestrated ``Expecting to
Fly'' for the Buffalo Springfield in 1967. He played piano on
Young's albums ``Tonight's the Night'' and ``Time Fades Away'' and
wrote arrangements for Young's 1972 album, ``Harvest,'' and his
1992 album, ``Harvest Moon.'' He also worked with Randy Newman,
Marianne Faithfull, the Neville Brothers, Jackie DeShannon and the
Monkees, among many others.
</P>
<P>
   Under his own name he recorded an instrumental hit, ``The Lonely
Surfer,'' in 1963, and released an album of orchestral pieces,
``St. Giles Cripplegate,'' in 1973. In the late 1970s Nitzsche
turned to New Wave rock, producing Graham Parker's ``Squeezing Out
Sparks'' and albums by Mink DeVille. Most recently, he produced
recordings by the Louisiana rocker C.C. Adcock, which remain
unreleased.
</P>
<P>
   But Nitzsche was most widely recognized for his film scores. His
1975 score for ``One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest'' was nominated
for an Academy Award, as was his score for ``An Officer and a
Gentleman'' in 1982, the year ``Up Where We Belong'' won as best
song.
</P>
<P>
   His first film music was for the 1964 rock and soul documentary,
``The T.A.M.I. Show,'' and he went on to write scores for more than
30 films, including ``Performance'' (1970), ``Greaser's Palace''
(1972), ``The Exorcist'' (1973), ``Heart Beat'' (1980), ``Cutter's
Way'' (1981), ``Personal Best'' (1982), ``Starman'' (1984), ``The
Razor's Edge (1984), ``The Jewel of the Nile'' (1985), ``9{ Weeks''
(1986), ``Stand by Me'' (1986), ``Revenge'' (1990) and ``The
Crossing Guard'' (1995). His score for ``The Hot Spot,'' a 1990
film by Dennis Hopper, brought together John Lee Hooker, Taj Mahal
and Miles Davis.
</P>
<P>
   Nitzsche had a persistent drug problem and was known, at times,
for volatile behavior. In 1979 he was sentenced to three years'
probation for breaking and entering following a domestic dispute
with his girlfriend at the time, the actress Carrie Snodgress. In
the late 1990s, The Los Angeles Times reported, his arrest was
shown on the television series ``Cops'' after he waved a gun at
someone who had stolen his hat.
</P>
<P>
   He is survived by his son.  &QL;

A WEIGHT LIFTED FOR DC COMICS: CHARLES ATLAS SUIT IS REJECTED
</HEADLINE>
  By JOHN SULLIVAN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Charles Atlas might have been one of America's most
famous musclemen, ably taking on bullies who kicked sand in his
face at the beach. But this week, a federal judge treated his
company like a 97-pound weakling and threw it out of court.
</P>
<P>
   The company, which markets a bodybuilding course popularized in
part through generations of comic book advertisements, had gone to
court claiming that a character in a short-lived DC comic was taken
from Atlas' famous campaign ``The Insult That Made a Man out of
Mac.''
</P>
<P>
   The advertisement told the brief story of Mac, the 97-pound
weakling, and a bully who kicks sand in his face. Mac, humiliated
by the sand kicking, takes the Charles Atlas course, becomes a
hulking giant and returns to thrash the bully. In the final panel,
the words ``Hero of the Beach'' hover over Mac's head, while his
girlfriend looks on.
</P>
<P>
   In 1991, DC Comics published a book featuring a character called
Flex Mentallo. The comic book featured a vignette titled
``Musclebound _ The Secret Origin of Flex Mentallo.'' Like Mac,
Flex started out as a weakling, was humiliated by a bully and
gained super strength through exercise. But after beating the
bully, Flex turns on his girlfriend and beats her, proclaiming, ``I
don't need a tramp like you anymore.''
</P>
<P>
   Charles Atlas Ltd. claimed the Flex Mentallo character owed its
origin to the Mac advertising campaign, and that DC's portrayal had
damaged the good will gained by the original advertisement.
</P>
<P>
   But Judge Naomi Reice Buchwald, of U.S. District Court in
Manhattan, rejected Atlas' argument. She granted DC's motion for a
summary judgment and dismissed the case on Tuesday. Buchwald ruled
that Charles Atlas had failed to raise the issue within the
six-year statute of limitations required by such cases, and she
also found that the DC comic was a parody of the Charles Atlas
advertisements, and therefore not subject to a lawsuit for
trademark infringement.
</P>
<P>
   Lillian Laserson, vice president and general counsel for DC
Comics, welcomed the decision, saying the episode was meant as a
parody. ``We meant no harm to the Charles Atlas company, nor do I
think we caused any harm,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   But the lawyer for Charles Atlas said DC Comics should not have
copied the campaign.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is our position, whether or not he had turned around and
beat up his own girlfriend after he became an Atlas man, it would
have been an infringement,'' said Seth Akabas, a lawyer whose firm
represented Charles Atlas Ltd.
</P>
<P>
   The company survives the bodybuilder Charles Atlas, who died in
1972. He was often featured in the advertisements in his bathing
suit.

   SYDNEY _ With only a fortnight to go until the Sydney Olympic
Games, the Australian government has taken the controversial step
of banning visits by United Nations human-rights inspectors in the
wake of recent criticism of the country's treatment of its
Aboriginal people and of asylum-seekers.
</P>
<P>
   The foreign minister, Alexander Downer, said Tuesday that U.N.
committees would not be allowed to visit Australia or be supplied
with any information unless there was a compelling reason to do so.
He said that Australia's future involvement with the committees was
dependent on them being reformed.
</P>
<P>
   The timing of the move could hardly be more provocative, ahead
of the Olympic Games, which Aboriginal activists have threatened to
use as a platform to highlight their second-class status.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this year the U.N. Human-Rights Committee criticized the
Australian government for its stance on Aboriginal land rights and
for mandatory sentencing laws which it said resulted in
disproportionate numbers of Aborigines being sent to jail.
</P>
<P>
   The attorney-general, Daryl Williams, accused the U.N. of
concentrating on relatively minor issues in democratic countries
like Australia while ignoring serious human-rights abuses
elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
   He said: ``If we are comparing (Australia's record) with
arbitrary arrests and executions and having your arms chopped off,
the problems in Australia pale into insignificance.''
</P>
<P>
   But the opposition Labor party criticized the government's
response, as did Amnesty International, which said that Australia
appeared to want to be accountable only to itself. ``This is an
irresponsible overreaction to recent poor report cards,'' said Kate
Gilmore, Amnesty's Australian director.
</P>
<P>
   Australia's 400,000 Aborigines are the country's most
disadvantaged group, with much higher infant mortality and much
lower life expectancy than the rest of the population of 19
million.
</P>
<P>
   Last May the U.N. committee on the elimination of racial
discrimination published a report criticizing the federal
government for its failure to override mandatory sentencing laws
that are in effect in Western Australia and the Northern Territory.
</P>
<P>
   The laws require that repeat offenders be jailed even for
trivial crimes and, according to human-rights campaigners, target
the kind of offenses committed by Aborigines.
</P>
<P>
   U.N. committees have also criticized Australia's policy of
holding illegal immigrants in detention camps while their refugee
applications are determined. &QL;

MEXICO IS ORDERED TO PAY A U.S. COMPANY $16.7 MILLION 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Calif., Miss., Va.)   By ANTHONY DePALMA  
 
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   An international tribunal that worked behind closed doors to
arbitrate a cross-border dispute between a U.S. company and the
Mexican government ordered Mexico to pay nearly $17 million in
compensatory damages Wednesday for failing to protect the company's
rights as a foreign investor.
</P>
<P>
   The tribunal, citing investor-protection measures in Chapter 11
of the North American Free Trade Agreement, found that the
government's actions amounted to an expropriation because they
prevented Metalclad Corp. of Newport Beach, Calif., from making
full use of a multimillion-dollar hazardous waste treatment and
disposal site it built several years ago in a central Mexican
state, San Luis Potosi.
</P>
<P>
   Authorities in the state stopped the project, saying it was
environmentally unsound, and eventually declared the area where it
was situated an environmental reserve, preventing it from ever
opening.
</P>
<P>
   The Metalclad dispute, and the $16.7 million judgment, represent
the latest unexpected turn in the way NAFTA has been used since it
took effect in January 1994. Several U.S. and Canadian companies
have used the agreement to challenge unfavorable actions of local
governments. Coming after the large-scale protests against
globalization in Seattle, and amid a growing backlash against trade
that is seen as too free, the decision is likely to increase
concern that trade accords could be used to circumvent local laws.
</P>
<P>
   Mary E. Bottari, who tracks regulatory changes for Global Trade
Watch, a Washington-based group aligned with Public Citizen, said:
``Anytime any investment is infringed upon by regulation, anytime
any worker safety protection puts any burden on a company, these
companies may use this Chapter 11 system to directly sue sovereign
governments _ it's crazy. This is a part of the hidden agenda of
NAFTA.''
</P>
<P>
   Clyde C. Pearce, the lawyer representing Metalclad, which did
insulation and asbestos-removal work in Southern California before
expanding into Mexico, said such thinking is ``dead wrong.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Metalclad met all federal and state environmental
regulations,'' he said. ``Besides, there is nothing stopping these
governments from denying a landfill at any point, as long as they
pay for it.''
</P>
<P>
   Under NAFTA's Chapter 11 investor provisions, disputes of this
type that cannot be settled through negotiation may be brought
before the tribunal, the International Center for Investment
Dispute Settlement, an obscure arm of the World Bank.
</P>
<P>
   A three-person panel, composed of arbitrators picked by the
opposing sides, operates with broad latitude and almost complete
institutional secrecy. Its sessions are private, its actions cannot
be appealed except in limited circumstances, and its decisions may
not be publicized unless the principals involved choose to make
them known.
</P>
<P>
   Grant S. Kesler, president and chief executive of Metalclad,
called the panel's decision in his company's favor ``as Pyrrhic a
victory as any I've experienced.''
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a token amount of money that doesn't really reflect
the value of the project,'' he said. The company had asked for $90
million in damages and estimated that it had spent more than $20
million in planning, permitting and construction.
</P>
<P>
   ``The biggest losers of all,'' Kesler added, ``are the people of
Mexico who continue to have to live in a country that produces 10
million tons of hazardous waste a year and has only one facility in
the whole country to handle it.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Metalclad made its move into Mexico in 1991, opening waste
transfer stations and collection sites in a dozen states. It then
bought an existing but poorly prepared disposal site in San Luis
Potosi, getting the necessary approvals from the national
government to build a disposal plant capable of handling up to
360,000 tons of hazardous waste a year.
</P>
<P>
   The site was ready to begin operation in March 1995 when Mexican
citizens set up protests outside. The local governor brought in the
police and effectively blocked Metalclad from operating.
</P>
<P>
   Pearce, Metalclad's lawyer, said company officials tried for
years to negotiate with the local authorities, agreeing to conduct
$500,000 in additional environmental studies and working with the
surrounding community.
</P>
<P>
   But the governor continued to oppose the project, despite Mexico
City approval. Pearce said federal studies all indicated that the
site, originally selected by the authorities, was environmentally
sound.
</P>
<P>
   Metalclad filed its NAFTA claim in January 1997. Hearings were
held in Washington last summer, and nothing was heard from the
tribunal until yesterday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   The Mexican government now has 45 days to begin making the $16.7
million payment to Metalclad. If it does not pay by then, 6 percent
interest, compounded monthly, will be added to the award.
</P>
<P>
   Pearce said the tribunal's ruling was the first time a sovereign
nation had been found not to have provided foreign investors fair
and equitable treatment. The impact, he said, could be significant
because other countries are now put on notice that they will be
expected to extend to foreign companies the openness and clear
regulations those companies are entitled to at home.
</P>
<P>
   He said the governor's obstruction ``resulted in `a
state-of-the-art, fully completed hazardous waste facility that is
just sitting there, while tons of dangerous materials are just
dumped clandestinely all over Mexico.''
</P>
<P>
   Mexican officials said they were surprised by the panel's
decision and might seek to have it nullified. They were
particularly upset by the finding that Metalclad had not been
treated fairly because it was led to believe that it had all the
necessary permits to operate the hazardous waste site.
</P>
<P>
   Luis de la Calle, Mexico's under secretary of commerce, said
local jurisdiction over construction of such sensitive
environmental projects was clear. He said he was not worried that
the problems encountered by Metalclad might cause other U.S.
companies to hesitate before investing in Mexico.
</P>
<P>
   Several other North American business disputes have found their
way to the NAFTA arbitration process. In one, Ethyl Corp. of
Richmond, Va., took action against the Canadian government because
of a ban on the importing of its gasoline additive. Canada was
eventually forced to lift the ban.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, Methanex Corp. of Vancouver, British Columbia, filed
a $970 million claim against the U.S. government because California
had banned imports of its own gasoline additive. That claim is
pending.
</P>
<P>
   And Loewen Group, a large funeral home operator throughout North
America that is based in Canada, is trying to use NAFTA to overturn
a huge judgment against it for anti-competitive practices. A
Mississippi state jury found that Loewen had tried to drive a local
funeral establishment out of business and awarded the local company
$500 million in compensatory and punitive damages. Loewen settled
out of court for $150 million.
</P>
<P>
   Loewen later brought a NAFTA action against the United States on
grounds that the Mississippi jury's damage award violated its
rights as an investor in the United States. A decision has not yet
been handed down.

GAP PROJECTS DECLINE OF 14 PERCENT IN ITS AUGUST SALES 
</HEADLINE>
   By LESLIE KAUFMAN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Gap Inc. stunned investors Wednesday evening by announcing after
the stock market closed that sales in stores open at least a year,
a well-watched industry measurement, would decline 14 percent in
August. The numbers were not only well below what most analysts
expected, they seemed to truly surprise the normally efficient
company.
</P>
<P>
   ``The results were clearly a disappointment and feel well below
our own expectations,'' said Heidi Kunz, executive vice president
and chief financial officer, in a recorded message for investors on
monthly sales. While August hardly rivals December for retailers,
it is nonetheless an important month because of back-to-school
sales.
</P>
<P>
   Sales at each of Gap's brands were lower than they were last
year in stores open at least a year. Gap's lower-priced chain, Old
Navy, which after blazing growth last year had a sharp downturn
early this summer, a sales decline of more than 20 percent. Sales
at the namesake The Gap stores were down, the company said, ``in
the mid-single digits.'' And even Banana Republic, previously a
growth stalwart for the company, had similar declines in sales.
</P>
<P>
   Gap's miss on sales is more remarkable because it comes after a
series of highly atypical stumbles. The company had a rare earnings
disappointment in the first quarter, and then announced a more
pronounced earnings shortfall in the second quarter and predicted
that earnings would be lower than analysts expected for the entire
year.
</P>
<P>
   Investors sent shares of Gap plunging 12 percent, to $22.50, in
after-hours trading after the company announced its August sales.
The shares are down more than 50 percent from a February high of
$53 and are trading at their lowest point since October 1998. And
the news could get worse.
</P>
<P>
   The company acknowledged that because of a ``highly
promotional'' environment, with sales earlier and more widespread,
gross margins were lower this August than last year, and said the
trend could further hurt earnings. ``We continue to see risk and
challenge in the third and fourth quarters,'' Kunz said in the
telephone message.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this year, Barbara Miller, an analyst with Goldman,
Sachs, thought Gap's earnings a share would be $1.58. Earlier this
month, she lowered her forecast to $1.28. Wednesday night she would
not say if she planned to lower her estimates again, but did say,
``This certainly gives me pause.''
</P>
<P>
   Gap said that some problems emerged with all its brands. First,
back-to-school sales, which the company said had built consistently
through the month previously, failed to expand in August. The
company also blamed the cutback in spending by consumers for retail
items.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, the company cited its decision to rely less on
television commercials.
</P>
<P>
   ``Gap brand's decision to shift its marketing mix away from TV
in favor of in-store marketing and promotion efforts did not
succeed as well as we had hoped,'' said Millard S. Drexler, the
company's president and chief executive, in a press release. The
Gap said it would change course and support its brands with lots of
television advertising in the holiday season.
</P>
<P>
   Many retailers have had a disappointing year. After six interest
rate increases by the Federal Reserve, consumer spending on retail
is declining. After the second quarter, many of the biggest
retailers said they were expecting a consumer slowdown in the third
and fourth quarters.
</P>
<P>
   Still, some retailers managed to do well with teen-agers heading
back to school. Analysts are expecting American Eagle Outfitters, a
fast-growing Gap rivals, to report a sales gain of 9 percent
Friday.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Analysts worried that there might be something more amiss with
Gap. ``There are no teen-agers going naked back to school,'' said
Richard Jaffe, a retailing analyst at PaineWebber. ``There have to
be other issues impacting Gap. It is a cause for concern.''

WORKFARE CRITICS CITE THE CASE OF A WOMAN WHO DIED ON THE JOB 
</HEADLINE>
  By THOMAS J. LUECK  
c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ A woman's death at her job in the city's workfare
program earlier this month prompted bitter criticism of the mayor
Wednesday by opponents of the program, who said the woman had been
afraid to take time off to visit her doctor.
</P>
<P>
   The woman, Laura Morales, 34, a mother of three, died Aug. 11
while working as a kitchen aide at a Brooklyn homeless shelter.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday morning, a group of about 100 people protested the
rigors of workfare outside the offices of Jason Turner, the
commissioner of the Human Resources Administration, who is in
charge of the workfare program.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is not the type of work that caused this death, but the
atmosphere in which she worked,'' said Stephen DiBrienza, the
chairman of the City Council General Welfare Committee and an
impassioned critic of workfare, who attended the protest.
</P>
<P>
   In an interview, he said Morales ``lived in fear and died in
fear, and it is Jason Turner who is responsible.''
</P>
<P>
   According to an account Wednesday in the Queens edition of
Newsday, friends and relatives of Morales' said she had been
experiencing severe headaches, but had refused to take time off for
fear of losing her welfare benefits.
</P>
<P>
   The cause of the woman's death has not been disclosed by the
city's medical examiner. But Mayor Rudolph Giuliani, responding to
the protest at a news conference, said that evidence indicated she
had died of a stroke.
</P>
<P>
   In defending the workfare program, the mayor also said that
Morales would not have been prevented from seeing a doctor because
of her assignment.
</P>
<P>
   ``Tragically, unfortunately, people do die at work,'' the mayor
said. He appeared at City Hall with Turner and several workfare
administrators and praised their ``aggressive efforts to move
thousands of people from welfare to work.''

   TEMELIN, CZECH REPUBLIC _ The people who live near Temelin, in
the rolling hills of south Bohemia, have been issued with two small
tablets each. They have been told to keep them in a safe place _
and to take them if anything goes wrong at the Soviet-designed
nuclear power plant that is about to be activated a few miles from
their homes, a plant Germany said this week it was not convinced is
safe.
</P>
<P>
   You can see the four massive cooling towers that rise over
Temelin for miles around. The nuclear power plant, Russian-designed
and partly modernized by a subsidiary of British Nuclear Fuels Ltd.
(BNFL), is due to be activated some time around Sept. 10.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday, the German government announced that its nuclear
watchdog, the GRS, is not convinced Temelin is safe, and demanded
urgent meetings with the Czech authorities before the first reactor
is activated. The Germans say Temelin could affect the Czech's
Republic's application for membership of the European Union.
</P>
<P>
   The Czech authorities have agreed to meet their German
counterparts on Sept 5. But that meeting will have no effect on the
decision to activate Temelin, they insist.
</P>
<P>
   Austria, whose border is only 30 miles away, has been furiously
lobbying against Temelin for months. Greenpeace claims there are
serious safety shortcomings at Temelin _ claims which are
strenuously denied by the Czech nuclear safety authority.
</P>
<P>
   Work started at Temelin under the old communist authorities, in
1983, and has been going on ever since. Last year, the Czech
authorities decided to finish and activate the reactor. The Czech
Republic is not short of electricity, but Temelin is expected to
provide lucrative energy exports.
</P>
<P>
   In the villages around Temelin, opinion is divided. ``They
should have switched it on months ago,'' says Frantisek Petrasek.
``We should be making money from it. The Germans should mind their
own business. They're just trying to ruin our economy. We've
already sold most of the country to the West as it is.''
</P>
<P>
   But not everybody agrees. ``Of course I'm scared,'' says Gerhard
Draschko, an Austrian visiting Hluboka castle with his two young
children. ``I'm scared for the children.'' Draschko lives just
across the border, 30 miles from Temelin.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Germans say it's not safe and I think they're right,''
says Jana Rosa, a Czech who owns a cafe near the castle. ``What can
we do?'' asks her husband, Vladimir. ``Nobody asked us about it. It
was decided in communist times, when they made the decisions and
just told us, `Shut up.' Nothing's changed, they still don't ask
us.''
</P>
<P>
   A national referendum on Temelin was proposed, but it never
materialized.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now they've spent so much of our taxes on it, we have to
switch it on so we can get the money back,'' says Rosa.
</P>
<P>
   ``Czech people don't realize we have a democracy now,'' says
Horst Lampert, an anti-nuclear campaigner who lives a few miles
from Temelin. ``They think we have to accept what the politicians
decide, like in the old days. They don't realize we can object, so
they don't.''
</P>
<P>
   Lampert, who once won a keg of beer from his local landlord when
he bet he could power the local school with solar energy, organizes
vacations in the Czech Republic for the child victims of the
Chernobyl disaster.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've seen the children of Chernobyl,'' says Lampert. ``They've
got no hair, they know there is no cure for them and that they're
dying,'' says Lampert. ``I have three children and two
grandchildren. I'm worried.'' &QL;

<P>
   Temelin's two reactors are Russian VVER-1000s _ generally
regarded as the safest of the Russian designs, and completely
different from the reactor that went wrong at Chernobyl.
</P>
<P>
   Parts of the plant _ the instrumentation and control _ are being
replaced with American designs by the U.S. firm Westinghouse, a
subsidiary of BNFL.
</P>
<P>
   The GRS, Germany's nuclear watchdog, in a report for the German
government, has identified three areas of concern at Temelin, all
of them concerned with emergency safety mechanisms.
</P>
<P>
   The most serious appears to be the fear that safety valves which
allow steam out of the reactor cannot cope if water comes out
instead _ a very rare but potentially dangerous occurrence which
was first identified in America's Three Mile Island disaster.
</P>
<P>
   The Czech nuclear licensing authority, the SUJB, is confident it
has already resolved the Germans' other two worries. One is a fear
cooling pipes may break; the SUJB says that is prevented by an
American design the Germans are not familiar with. The other is
that emergency batteries do not have enough capacity; the Czechs
say it has already been increased.
</P>
<P>
   But the German Environment Ministry says it is concerned with
Temelin in general. The plant is surrounded with unsubstantiated
allegations of safety lapses and incompetence.
</P>
<P>
   Greenpeace claims there are cracks in the reactor vessel larger
than the safety limit, but offers no documentary evidence. The SUJB
says the cracks are well within the safety limit.
</P>
<P>
   Greenpeace says repair welding to cooling pipes wasn't tested.
The SUJB says it was, and was proved safe.
</P>
<P>
   A Czech engineer who worked on the project says pipes weren't
properly cleaned, which could allow dirt to get into the reactor.
The SUJB says they were thoroughly cleaned.
</P>
<P>
   There are claims nuclear fuel was moved without precautions and
radioactivity escaped. The SUJB denies this. There is no conclusive
evidence for any of these allegations.
</P>
<P>
   The SUJB's own annual reports, though, are damning of safety
procedures at Temelin _ particularly of those of Skoda, the Czech
contractor responsible for most for the hardware. But Dana Drabova,
chairman of the SUJB, says those concerns do not affect the safety
of the finished reactor, which is being thoroughly tested. &QL;

EDITORIAL: LIEBERMAN'S RELIGIOUS WORDS 
</HEADLINE>
   c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial for Thursday, Aug. 31:
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Joseph Lieberman's nomination as the Democratic
vice-presidential candidate was widely hailed as a breakthrough for
tolerance. Now, in a remarkable campaign development, Lieberman is
being criticized by some Jewish leaders and others fearful that his
declarations of faith as a devout Jew, and his calls for more
religion in public life, are an affront to Americans who are less
religious or whose faith comes from a different tradition.
</P>
<P>
   Ironically, leaders of the Christian right are defending
Lieberman while asserting that some of their own leaders who seek a
bigger role for religion and religious institutions should be
absolved of similar charges of intolerance.
</P>
<P>
   Lieberman has long and eloquently argued that a general decline
in moral values, especially in popular culture, must be reversed by
a reaffirmation of religion. However, in comments last Sunday he
seemed to cross the boundaries of tolerance when he declared that
``George Washington warned us never to indulge the supposition
`that morality can be maintained without religion.''' As the
Anti-Defamation League pointed out, this sort of talk is offensive
to many highly ethical citizens who are not religious. On Tuesday
Lieberman explained that he did not mean to suggest that
irreligious people could not be moral. But whenever religious
matters are addressed, Lieberman should firmly and unequivocally
reiterate his support for the separation of church and state, a
bedrock principle of the U.S. Constitution and political system.
</P>
<P>
   No one should want Lieberman to refrain from speaking from his
heart about his faith. Voters are entitled to know _ indeed they
need to know _ what inspires and informs the thinking of anyone
running for office. Lieberman has also performed a great service by
reiterating that deep religious faith is not a monopoly of
conservatives. As he notes, religious ``awakenings'' led to such
liberal milestones as the Bill of Rights in the 18th century, the
abolition of slavery and various progressive social reforms in the
19th century, and the civil rights revolution of the 20th century.
</P>
<P>
   Today Lieberman is calling for a fourth ``awakening'' of
religion as an antidote to violence, promiscuity and the
degradation of family values. These positions, not to mention his
condemnation of President Clinton's sexual misconduct in 1998,
appeal to many voters and were clearly a major reason Vice
President Al Gore selected him as a running mate.
</P>
<P>
   The idea that spiritual guidance can help in combating
immorality is irrefutable. The danger lies in political appeals
that are so zealous that they unsettle Americans with different
religious views, making them feel like second-class citizens, or
lead to policies coercive toward non-believers.
</P>
<P>
   As Lieberman has pointed out, throughout U.S. history tolerance
for American pluralism and diversity has done far more to enhance
religion than to undermine it. That is why it is good for the
national dialogue to see someone of deep religious faith argue in
favor of abortion rights, against school prayer and against
discrimination of homosexuals, as Lieberman has.
</P>
<P>
   Lieberman has also condemned the movie industry for its disdain
of moral values, deplored the proliferation of pornographic and
violent material on the Internet and _ like Gore and Gov. George W.
Bush _ called for greater government funding for ``faith-based''
organizations that deliver services to the poor and the homeless.
</P>
<P>
   In instituting these policies, there should never be any
compromise with the Constitution's ban on government establishment
of religion. Exhorting Hollywood to make different movies cannot
veer into government censorship, and government funding of
``faith-based'' organizations should never be used to support
religious proselytizing by these groups.
</P>
<P>
   What should also never happen is for either side to frame the
debate over these questions as a kind of litmus test of one's
religious conviction, which is something many advocates of school
prayer and other issues have done. It is fine to call for more
religion in American public life.
</P>
<P>
   But supporting the constitutionally based separation of religion
from public policy or favoring limits on the role of government in
promoting religious values should not be denigrated as immoral or
anti-religion. In the end, tolerance and understanding of the
boundaries between church and state are what have allowed religion
to flourish in the United States as it has in few other countries
in history.

THE AD CAMPAIGN: LAZIO MAKES TRUST THE ISSUE
</HEADLINE>
  By ADAM NAGOURNEY   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   This is a new 30-second commercial, called ``Believe,'' that the
Lazio campaign began broadcasting Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   PRODUCER: The Murphy Pintak Gautier Hudome Agency.
</P>
<P>
   ON THE SCREEN: A single shot: Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz.,
champion of legislation to overhaul campaign finance laws, sitting
in a chair, calmly talking straight into the camera, and showing a
bit of disappointment.
</P>
<P>
   THE SCRIPT: ``You know, when Mrs. Clinton said she wouldn't take
huge special interest soft money contributions if her opponent
wouldn't, I believed her. But since then, she's taken in millions
in soft money and used it for attack ads distorting Rick Lazio's
record. Rick Lazio has said he'll agree to a soft money ban, but
Mrs. Clinton just refuses. So it's pretty clear there's only one
Senate candidate who really wants campaign finance reform. Rick
Lazio _ he's the candidate you can trust.''
</P>
<P>
   ACCURACY: It is less than accurate to say, as McCain does in the
ad, that Clinton refuses to agree to a ban on soft-money
contributions, the largely unregulated contributions that are
supposed to be used mainly for party building. Clinton called for
such a ban before Lazio even entered the race. However, she
attached conditions on her proposal that Lazio's aides have
dismissed as untenable: that he make certain that a dozen or so
independent committees that are financing television campaigns
attacking Clinton halt their efforts as well. The result is a
deadlock unlikely to break.
</P>
<P>
   SCORECARD: Although the ostensible subject of the advertisement
is campaign finance reform, it really is about Clinton's
credibility, and thus, the crucial sentence in this advertisement
is the last one. It is a theme that Lazio used in another ad
earlier this week, and will be a recurrent one throughout the
campaign. McCain was a popular figure, nationally, during his run
for the presidency this year, although he did lose the presidential
primary in New York to George W. Bush. In theory, at least, he
appeals to independent voters who may not have made up their minds
in this race. However, it is unclear whether he carries the sway
today that he did when he was a candidate.

 c.2000 The Independent, London  
<TEXT>
 &UR; (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) &LR;  &QC;
<P>
   LONDON _ Children's progress at school is determined partly by
the contents of their pencil cases, a child development expert
claims.
</P>
<P>
   As thousands of British children prepared to start school next
week, Dr. Rhona Stainthorp of London University's Institute of
Education spoke of the perils of using the wrong kind of pencil.
</P>
<P>
   Even the absence of a pencil sharpener could be critical; the
child's handwriting may be poor because of a blunt lead, she said.
And too many colored pencils may also hinder progress if pupils are
diverted from the important matter of the three Rs to choosing
whether to use the blue or green one next.
</P>
<P>
   Children aged between five and seven, she argued, needed a
pencil with a triangular cross-section, not an ordinary hexagonal
one, if they were to become quick and enthusiastic writers. Some
experts have suggested that bad handwriting means lower grades in
exams.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Stainthorp said: ``Children need to know how to move a
pencil using just the thumb, first finger and middle finger.
</P>
<P>
   If you have a triangular pencil, it is easy to see where to put
each of those digits. Some children try to write with four or five
fingers scrunched up. It is harder and you don't have as much
control.''
</P>
<P>
   Mastering the art of sharpening a pencil _ a two-handed action _
is also important. Dr. Stainthorp, a member of the Handwriting
Interest Group, said: ``A blunt instrument gives a fuzzy line and
children tend to start writing even bigger.''
</P>
<P>
   Wax crayons should be left at home in the cupboard. ``Even
coloring in wax crayon makes children scribble,'' she said. Felt
tips, on the other hand, are getting ``better and better.''
</P>
<P>
   An eraser has to be reasonably big and it has to work, Dr.
Stainthorp said. ``There are real problems with rubbers (erasers).
Some schools will say that they don't allow children to rub out
anything. On the whole, children need to learn that a little
mistake can be crossed out.''
</P>
<P>
   This equipment helps a child's educational progress, she said,
because it is very important for pupils to be able to write quickly
by the time they start taking exams.
</P>
<P>
   ``We need to get the basic handwriting skills right early on. In
terms of your own self-esteem, you need to have a good style before
you start using a pen,'' she said.

<P>
   LONDON _ Children's progress at school is determined partly by
the contents of their pencil cases, a child development expert
claims.
</P>
<P>
   As thousands of British children prepared to start school next
week, Dr. Rhona Stainthorp of London University's Institute of
Education spoke of the perils of using the wrong kind of pencil.
</P>
<P>
   Even the absence of a pencil sharpener could be critical; the
child's handwriting may be poor because of a blunt lead, she said.
And too many colored pencils may also hinder progress if pupils are
diverted from the important matter of the three Rs to choosing
whether to use the blue or green one next.
</P>
<P>
   Children aged between five and seven, she argued, needed a
pencil with a triangular cross-section, not an ordinary hexagonal
one, if they were to become quick and enthusiastic writers. Some
experts have suggested that bad handwriting means lower grades in
exams.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Stainthorp said: ``Children need to know how to move a
pencil using just the thumb, first finger and middle finger.
</P>
<P>
   If you have a triangular pencil, it is easy to see where to put
each of those digits. Some children try to write with four or five
fingers scrunched up. It is harder and you don't have as much
control.''
</P>
<P>
   Mastering the art of sharpening a pencil _ a two-handed action _
is also important. Dr. Stainthorp, a member of the Handwriting
Interest Group, said: ``A blunt instrument gives a fuzzy line and
children tend to start writing even bigger.''
</P>
<P>
   Wax crayons should be left at home in the cupboard. ``Even
coloring in wax crayon makes children scribble,'' she said. Felt
tips, on the other hand, are getting ``better and better.''
</P>
<P>
   An eraser has to be reasonably big and it has to work, Dr.
Stainthorp said. ``There are real problems with rubbers (erasers).
Some schools will say that they don't allow children to rub out
anything. On the whole, children need to learn that a little
mistake can be crossed out.''
</P>
<P>
   This equipment helps a child's educational progress, she said,
because it is very important for pupils to be able to write quickly
by the time they start taking exams.
</P>
<P>
   ``We need to get the basic handwriting skills right early on. In
terms of your own self-esteem, you need to have a good style before
you start using a pen,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Ballpoint pens are out. ``Although they offer excellent value
for money for older students and adults, they produce a poor line
and are difficulty for youngsters to control.''
</P>
<P>
   Partners the Stationer, a stationery company, has produced a
chart showing what a child's pencil case should contain, based on
Dr. Stainthorp's advice.
</P>
<P>
   Children aged five to seven need a short, triangular shaft

and pencil sharpener.
</P>
<P>
   Those aged seven to 11 need a fountain pen or a fiber-tipped

<P>
   BEIRUT _ Muammar Qaddafi must sometimes find it difficult to
remember which ``liberation'' movement he has supported and which
he has ignored.
</P>
<P>
   Ten years ago, Sierre Leone's Foday Sankoh _ famous for his
group's leg, ear, hand and lip amputations _ trained in Libya
alongside Charles Taylor, Liberia's gangland boss-made president.
In May, Qaddafi sent a delegation to Sierre Leone to work for the
release of U.N. staff taken hostage by rebels.
</P>
<P>
   Sankoh's appalling Revolutionary United Front has been supported
by Liberia and by Burkina Faso whose president, Blaise Compaore _
whose close ties with Qaddafi have been in evidence for years _ has
been accused of channelling weapons to the RUF.
</P>
<P>
   Taylor and Compaore have both been charged by an international
investigation of exchanging guns _ some of them from Qaddafi's
Libya _ for diamonds that end up in the trading houses of Antwerp,
Tel Aviv and New York.
</P>
<P>
   Libyan weapons, including shoulder-fired SAM-7 missiles, are
said to be legally purchased from Libya by Burkina Faso and then
sent on to Liberia, often through the jungle.
</P>
<P>
   When he turned up at an African summit in Cairo in December of
last year, Qaddafi was hard at work trying to convince the
presidents of Sudan, Eritrea, Uganda and Congo to drop their
differences and support Sudanese president Omar Bashir's new state
of emergency in Khartoum.
</P>
<P>
   In Qaddafi's presence, Bashir and President Yoweri Museveni
signed an agreement to establish diplomatic relations between their
two countries.
</P>
<P>
   By the middle of this year, Bashir was urging Qaddafi and
President Moubarak of Libya to persuade John Garang's Sudan
People's Liberation Army to make peace with Khartoum, while Qaddafi
all the time blamed the United States for encouraging the southern
Sudanese rebels to delay an agreement.
</P>
<P>
   His successes in Africa may not always be obvious, but his
delight in publicity has never been in doubt.
</P>
<P>
   Last April, for example, Qaddafi travelled to a Togo summit in a
massive convoy that made its ponderous way across Niger, Burkina
Faso and Ghana. The wagon train took a week to reach its
destination.
</P>
<P>
   He regularly arrives at North African conferences escorted by
long-haired maidens with automatic rifles, his special protection
squad who run alongside his air-conditioned limousine.
</P>
<P>
   Qaddafi's support for the African National Congress during the
apartheid years was a singularly shrewd policy, earning him the
friendship of former South African President Nelson Mandela and a
special visit to Tripoli this month by South African minister
Ronnie Kasrils, to receive the two South African hostages of the
Philippines' Abu Sayyaf rebels.
</P>
<P>
   Kasrils spent several years in Libya as an exile during the
apartheid era.
</P>
<P>
   At an Organization of African Unity conference in Algiers a year
ago, Qaddafi was supposed to end the Ethiopean-Eritrean border war
and send a peacekeeping force to the Congo. He set up his green
tent on the lawns of the Sheraton Hotel in Algiers but refused to
stay inside the building because it was ``a symbol of American
imperialism.''
</P>
<P>
   In May this year, Qaddafi was hosting Chadian President Idriss
Deby in Tripoli and President Alfa Omar Konare of Mali. He wanted
greater economic cooperation between the Sahel and Saharan nations
of Libya, Sudan, Mali, Chad, Burkina Faso, Eritrea. Niger and the
Central African Republic.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is no time to waste over backward ideologies like
border, tribal and ethnic disputes,'' he admonished the Cairo
summit last December. ``We don't want future generations to inherit
ethnic and tribal conflicts.''
</P>
<P>
   The ``peacemaker of Africa'' naturally earns tributes in his own
newspapers. Indeed, a columnist in Al-Zhaf al-Akhdar _ whose views
exactly parallel those of the great leader _ recently rhapsodized
about Qaddafi's supposed good looks.
</P>
<P>
   His teeth, the writer announced, were ``naturally immune to
stain'' for when he released ``a full-blown smile, the naturally
white teeth discharge a radiation pregnant with sweet joy and real
happiness.''
</P>
<P>
   Which just shows what peacemaking can do for you. &QL;

DICK CHENEY: IN HIS OWN WORDS 
 
</HEADLINE>
  c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Remarks prepared for delivery yesterday at an Atlanta hotel at
an event sponsored by the Southern Center for International
Relations:
</P>
<P>
   ``Our military today is overused and under-resourced. Defense
spending today is lower as a percentage of GNP than at any time
since 1940 _ the year before the attack on Pearl Harbor. At the
same time, overseas deployments have multiplied, stretching the
services to the limit, and causing shortages of spare parts and
equipment. All of this has brought on serious problems of
readiness, recruiting, retention, and morale.
</P>
<P>
   Let me be specific. Over the last decade, commitments worldwide
have gone up 300 percent, while our military forces have been cut
by 40 percent. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   As of January 1993, 85 percent of Air Force combat units were
fully ready for their mission. Today that number is at 65 percent.
Part of the problem, according to the secretary of the Air Force,
is that pilots are flying more missions on older aircraft. The
average plane is 20 years old. And even with new planes coming
online, by the year 2015, the average plane will be 30 years old. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The Army reports that 40 percent of its helicopter fleet is not
up to performing its mission. The main reason is aging rotary-wing
aircraft. The Army also reports a `dramatic decline' in aviator
experience. Flight hours of aviation battalion commanders have
declined from an average of 2,000 hours 10 years ago to 1,000
today. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Budget shortfalls have slowed some training missions and brought
others to a complete stop, as when the U.S.S. Decatur was forced to
return to port a month early this summer _ because there wasn't
enough money for fuel. General Zinni, the recently retired
commander of U.S. forces in the Persian Gulf, has said that our
military has inadequate resources and too many commitments for the
size of the force. Not long ago, he said that America would have
trouble mounting another major operation like Desert Storm. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In that conflict, we had no more effective weapons than the
cruise missile, which destroyed the main power grid in Baghdad on
the first night of the air war. It was among the weapons of choice
in Kosovo as well. The Procurement Subcommittee of the House Armed
Services Committee found that at the end of that campaign last
year, the Navy had only enough cruise missiles to satisfy a little
over half of what is required for two major theater wars ... The
Air Force was left with only one-tenth of what it needed. ... &QL;
</P>
<P>
   For the fifth consecutive year, the Army and Navy will fail to
meet their targets for commissioned officers. Both branches are
facing a situation where junior officers are increasingly headed
for the door. In a recent GAO survey of more than a thousand
officers and enlisted men, a majority said they intended to leave
rather than stay and pursue a career. Why are they leaving? For
many, the question really is, why stay _ when training is
inadequate, equipment is lacking, units are undermanned and forces
are deployed in more than a hundred places across the globe, often
with unclear missions and inadequate support? ... &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A much easier call is where to place responsibility for all of
this. It is the record of eight years of stewardship over the
American armed forces by President Clinton and Vice President Gore.
Eight years of neglect and misplaced priorities. Eight years of
multiplying missions and unclear goals. . . . &QL;
</P>
<P>
   They claim to have turned things around, but the only thing that
has kept it from falling further has been Congress, which has added
$50 billion to the administration's defense budget requests over
the last several years. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The needs of our nation's defense, and the needs of our
defenders, are not merely relevant in a national campaign. They
must be front and center. For his part, Governor Bush has been
raising these issues for more than a year. He has offered specific
proposals to rebuild the strength and morale of the armed forces,
and make them fully capable of meeting every challenge the new
century will bring. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Seizing this opportunity will require not just spending more,
but spending more wisely. It means giving today's military what it
needs. It means beginning to create the military of the future, by
capitalizing on new technologies and placing greater emphasis on
R&AMP;D. It means accelerating research and deployment of missile
defenses.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   But the first order of business is to renew the bond of trust
between the commander in chief and the military. This includes very
practical steps, like higher pay, improved housing, and better
schools for their children. It certainly means reviewing our
overseas deployments in dozens of countries, and insisting that
deployments have well-defined objectives. It means keeping faith
with our veterans, by providing first-rate health care and treating
them with dignity. Above all, it means respecting the military and
earning their trust in return.''  &QL;

   IRVING, Texas _ Kareem Larrimore practiced at left cornerback
with the Dallas Cowboys' first-team Wednesday, and practiced well.
</P>
<P>
   Larrimore's performance was exemplary, especially because
Phillippi Sparks was on the same practice field for the first time
since the Cowboys lured the retired veteran out of his living room
and away from his children for $2 million this season.
</P>
<P>
   ``Kareem had a real good practice,'' Cowboys defensive
coordinator Mike Zimmer said at Valley Ranch. ``I would've been
disappointed if he hadn't.''
</P>
<P>
   Larrimore, who did not mope or press at practice, has emerged as
the most game-ready member of a trio of rookie cornerbacks drafted
by the Cowboys in April. They arrived in this order: Dwayne
Goodrich (second round), Larrimore (fourth) and Mario Edwards
(sixth).
</P>
<P>
   While their roles still have not been defined just days from the
regular-season opener against Philadelphia, Larrimore has dealt
with the extra pressure of seeing his three-week hold on a starting
job turn into a game-day decision. Either he or Sparks could start
at left cornerback on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would have to lose that spot. I have to flat out do some
stupid things to lose it,'' Larrimore said, adding, ``I'm not
worried. I'm taking it as a business decision. It's all about
winning games.''
</P>
<P>
   The position Larrimore finds himself in is the latest in a
series of setbacks that have affected the rookie cornerbacks this
summer.
</P>
<P>
   Goodrich, under the gun early for falling behind the others,
hasn't played since the preseason game in Tokyo on Aug. 5 because
of a strained right hamstring.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's probably the most frustrated I've ever been,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Edwards hasn't played since the Oakland preseason game Aug. 13
because of a strained left hamstring, although he returned to
practice this week.
</P>
<P>
   ``This game is hard enough anyway,'' Edwards said. ``If it was
easy, you'd have people lining up from here to MacArthur Boulevard
wanting to give it a try.''
</P>
<P>
   All three rookie cornerbacks became friends at the Senior Bowl
in January, and they've remained friends despite competing for
playing time. Their lockers are within 12 feet of each other.
Larrimore is more of a loner, but they do socialize off the field.
</P>
<P>
   The three are here because of how the Cowboys reacted in April
to the pending loss of Deion Sanders in June.
</P>
<P>
   Sanders wanted an $8 million signing bonus, which he got with
Washington, while Goodrich ($1 million signing bonus/$250,000
first-year salary), Larrimore ($280,000/$193,000) and Edwards
($60,000/$193,000) will cost the Cowboys less than $2 million
combined this season.
</P>
<P>
   They represent the future. But once Kevin Smith left the team,
presumably to retire, the thinking in training camp was that if one
of the three rookies could start this season it would be a steal.
</P>
<P>
   That changed when Larrimore was burned on several big plays in a
preseason game in Denver, Goodrich and Edwards were sidelined, and
Sparks was signed.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know my ability,'' Larrimore said. ``I'm confident _ not too
much cocky _ but I also take things slow. I really feel that I was
born to play this position.''
</P>
<P>
   Darren Woodson, the Cowboys' five-time Pro Bowl strong safety,
said rookie cornerbacks are put in a tough position: They must be
humble because they are rookies, but cocky because they are
cornerbacks.
</P>
<P>
   ``If a rookie cornerback doesn't have any confidence in his
ability, he's not going to make it in this league. That's just
being honest,'' Woodson said. ``You're going to get beat. It's how
you react after you get beat that matters. You've got to have a
really short memory.''
</P>
<P>
   And blinders.
</P>
<P>
   Larrimore, who has resumed play in nickel packages against slot
receivers, was being watched closely again Wednesday as Sparks
worked with both the first and second team.
</P>
<P>
   ``He looked rusty, but good,'' Zimmer said of Sparks, who
participated in his first team drills since preparing for the New
York Giants' season-ending game at Texas Stadium in December.
</P>
<P>
   Larrimore, for his part, recalls how he felt invisible when he
moved into Sanders' old locker at Valley Ranch three months ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``No one knew who I was,'' Larrimore said. ``Now everyone wants
to know what I can do.'' nn

BAPTISM IN HEAT TOUGH ON SPARKS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By CLARENCE E. HILL JR. 
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   IRVING, Texas _ Summer vacation officially ended Wednesday for
newly signed Dallas Cowboys cornerback Phillippi Sparks.
</P>
<P>
   Sparks, who vomited several times on the sidelines, admitted
struggling through his first workout in 103-degree temperatures.
But he said, ``I'll get there, baby.''
</P>
<P>
   The question is whether Sparks will get there in time to make a
contribution in the season opener against the Philadelphia Eagles
on Sunday. Sparks, a former New York Giants cornerback who came out
of retirement to sign with the Cowboys on Tuesday, has not had a
serious workout since last season.
</P>
<P>
   Cowboys coach Dave Campo said he'll be able to better assess
Sparks' readiness after he has gone through a few more practices.
Campo said he expected Sparks' conditioning to be rusty because he
missed training camp.
</P>
<P>
   However, Campo said there's no question that the nine-year
veteran will play against the Eagles. It's just a matter of how
much.
</P>
<P>
   ``We limited his reps in practice to make sure we're not pushing
him too hard,'' Campo said. ``From not participating, we don't want
him to end up pulling something. But he's a veteran. He sees
things. He's going to be fine. We will do some extra things with
him to make sure he is mentally ready to go.'' HOPING TO PUT HEAT
ON EAGLES
</P>
<P>
   With the high temperature expected to be in or near triple
digits Sunday, the Cowboys are counting on the Eagles to experience
a little of what Phillippi Sparks was feeling Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Dave Campo, who had the Cowboys running sprints after practice
Wednesday, said the heat should be an advantage for the Cowboys
against a team that's not used to it.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's tough to concentrate and focus in the heat, especially in
the fourth quarter,'' Campo said. ``I talked to our team about that
during team drills and after practice.'' PRACTICE SQUAD UPDATE
</P>
<P>
   After adding rookie tight end James Whalen to the practice squad
Tuesday, the Cowboys worked out former Pittsburgh Steelers
quarterback Anthony Wright on Wednesday in an attempt to close out
their practice-squad numbers.
</P>
<P>
   Cowboys vice president Stephen Jones said they were just waiting
for Wright to pass a physical before signing him. Wright, a
two-year veteran who played in college at South Carolina, would be
the second quarterback on the practice squad, along with Clint
Stoerner. Jones said the Cowboys had no problem having two
quarterbacks on the practice squad.
</P>
<P>
   Whalen was picked in the fifth round of the 2000 draft by the
Tampa Bay Buccaneers, who released him Sunday. A former Kentucky
standout, Whalen is considered an ideal H-back prospect.
</P>
<P>
   Already signed to the practice squad are receiver Damon Hodge
and running back Troy Hambrick. BRIEFLY
</P>
<P>
   _ Cornerback Mario Edwards (hamstring) is back at practice.
However, his availability for Sunday's game won't be assessed until
later in the week.
</P>
<P>
   _ Cornerbacks Charlie Williams (knee) and Dwayne Goodrich
(hamstring) have been ruled out of the Eagles game.
</P>
<P>
   _ The Cowboys handed out 1999 team awards at Tuesday's kickoff
luncheon. Emmitt Smith was named offensive player of the year.
Dexter Coakley was named defensive player of the year. Former
Cowboys receiver Ernie Mills won the Ed Block Memorial Courage
Award. The Legends award was renamed the Tom Landry Legend's award.
The late Cowboys coach was honored as the 2000 recipient. His
widow, Alicia Landry, accepted the award. nn

MAYBE PISTONS WILL GET LAST LAUGH ON LAETTNER
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By RANDY GALLOWAY 
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   If the story is true, and the truth is somewhat blurred, then a
twist of irony has been wrapped around prominent jock kingdom necks
of late.
</P>
<P>
   Follow along:
</P>
<P>
   Once upon a time, Don Nelson was hired to coach the New York
Knicks, where he immediately fell out of favor with the star
player, one Patrick Ewing, and with all fans and media of the most
important franchise in the NBA. And if you don't believe me on that
last point, just ask the league office, or better yet, watch how
the referees call any playoff game involving the beloved Knickies.
</P>
<P>
   But I wander aimlessly. As I was saying, Nelson decided his new
club in New York could never win a championship with Ewing as the
focal point of the offense. He wanted to spread the shots, and the
floor. The rebellion, however, was harsh and swift.
</P>
<P>
   Ewing turned on Nelson. He recruited other players in the
revolt. The fans joined in. The media ganged up. All that got
Nelson fired, pronto. Big Nellie didn't last the season in New
York.
</P>
<P>
   But fast-forward the shot clock some four years, which brings us
to this week. The Dallas Mavericks made a trade with the Detroit
Pistons, and a very questionable trade it was. Known trouble
arrived in the 6-foot-11 quirky package labeled Christian Laettner.
</P>
<P>
   Nelson, however, hooted loudly over the Mavericks' good fortune,
as did owner Mark Cuban. They are promoting Laettner as a welcome
addition, which is normal in these cases. Nelson and Cuban worked
for weeks to make the deal happen.
</P>
<P>
   For Big Nellie, there was also additional glee that the
Mavericks (or so the local story goes) personally wrecked a
four-team trade last week that had made national headlines. That
one involved the Knicks dealing Ewing to Seattle for Vin Baker,
with the Lakers getting Laettner and Detroit ending up with various
iguanas.
</P>
<P>
   Ewing, however, was the centerpiece of the transaction, mainly
because the Knicks wanted to dump him. And when that trade died, a
mighty roar of displeasure came from all precincts in New York,
particularly fans and media. They wanted this guy gone. Why? Too
selfish to assume a lesser role, that's why. And the Knicks
couldn't win a championship with Ewing as the focal point, that's
why.
</P>
<P>
   Hey, hold it a second. Isn't that what Nelson said four years
ago? And was barbecued for offering that theory on Patrick?
</P>
<P>
   The reason Ewing remains in New York, so says Nelson, is because
he and Cuban convinced the Pistons to pull out of the deal because
the Mavericks had a better package of players to offer for Laettner
than Detroit would be receiving in the four-way rodeo.
</P>
<P>
   This is indeed sweet irony. And some nice revenge for Nelson. He
gave back to New York exactly what Gotham had once told him it
dearly wanted. Except ...
</P>
<P>
   The Pistons now claim they pulled out of the earlier deal on
their own, not due to advice from any voices down Dallas way. And
that the Mavericks' deal was the one they planned on making all
along.
</P>
<P>
   Last laughs are fun, and Nelson is having one at the moment. But
give it a season and will the Pistons be chuckling over unloading
Laettner on the Mavs?
</P>
<P>
   This just in from a Detroit sports page columnist Wednesday:
</P>
<P>
   ``The more the Pistons struggled, the more Laettner looked to
satisfy his own self-interests. He'd sulk if he didn't get enough
shots and was one of the first in the locker room to tune out Alvin
Gentry, contributing to the coach's ouster late last season.
</P>
<P>
   ``It didn't matter whom the Pistons acquired for Laettner.
What's most important is he's gone.''
</P>
<P>
   Laettner has left similar impressions in two other NBA stops.
Not a very likable guy to start with, his talent level isn't good
enough to overcome a cobra personality.
</P>
<P>
   There's no doubt, however, Nelson pushed Cuban hard to land
Laettner, and the owner was more than willing to come up with yet
another $3 million, in cash, to grease Detroit palms. Cuban always
seems to have an extra $3 million in his hip pocket anytime the
Mavericks are trade-ready, which is all the time.
</P>
<P>
   But as Cuban, Nelson and a nice foundation of young talent have
caused a total U-turn in public perception for a franchise that
went unloved locally for a decade, Laettner represents a threat to
a budding success story.
</P>
<P>
   The team unity was strong last season. Even with Worm Rodman in
town for a while, that unity didn't crumble. But Laettner could
wreck all that in a second.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just don't think it's true about this guy being big
trouble,'' Nelson said Wednesday by phone from Hawaii. ``Yes, he's
had his moments in the league. Yes, he's a little different. But I
think I know him well enough, that all that can be handled. I
certainly don't anticipate problems.''
</P>
<P>
   Basketball-wise, Laettner is a big man who plays a Nellie kind
of game. You can spread the floor with him, and dictate matchups.
He gives a contrast at center with Shawn Bradley, but then again,
who doesn't? One other factor which can be viewed as favorable _
Laettner is in the last year of his contract. If the Mavs don't
re-sign him, they get the salary cap bump. But a player in the last
year of his contract is also normally on his best behavior while
attempting to play at his best.
</P>
<P>
   Last laughs and great irony aside, Laettner will have to be
monitored closely, both on the floor and in the area known as
goodwill toward teammates. nn

 WILLIAMS HANDLES EVERYTHING _ INCLUDING McENROE 
(REPLACES earlier version)  
 By SELENA ROBERTS   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ It was long after she impressively tucked away her
21st match in a row, but Venus Williams was still on her game,
still delivering returns with the speed of a quick wit.
</P>
<P>
   This is how you handle a heckler; and this is how she put away
John McEnroe.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday, the comments McEnroe made in this week's issue of The
New Yorker _ where he declared that the dominant Williams sisters
could be beaten by a male college player or any man on the senior
tour (like him) _ made their way to Venus Williams. Instead of
taking offense to remarks that belittle her achievements, she took
the challenge with a good rip at humor.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know if I could fit him in my schedule right now,''
Williams said when asked about a battle-of-the-sexes match with
McEnroe. ``I don't think it's fair to put a 20-year-old against a
40-something person. So, I'll let that pass.''
</P>
<P>
   She was in too good a mood to let anyone spoil it. She had just
unnerved Kveta Hrdlickova with the might of her lumberjack strokes,
and exited the court with a 48-minute, 6-1, 6-1 exclamation mark to
her current roll.
</P>
<P>
   Williams could not help but finding the light side of Day 3 at
the U.S. Open. After leaving the interview room, she stopped and
posed for a picture, gave the lens a bright crescent-moon smile,
and all but skipped toward the locker room.
</P>
<P>
   For a while, there was a feel-good atmosphere to the day. In the
same hallway, Jennifer Capriati was spotted embracing her
boyfriend, Xavier Malisse, and wishing him good luck just before
she went off to win her second-round match in Louis Armstrong
Stadium and he departed for Court 10, where he took his first-round
victory.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's hard when we play at the same time,'' Malisse said. ``I
want to see her, and she wants to be at my match. She finished
first. So, I liked seeing her come in. It was good to look and see
her there.''
</P>
<P>
   But there was a limit to the positive vibes. Outside the
players' cafeteria, Jelena Dokic was seen crying. It was her father
again. As a reminder of the sports dysfunctional dark side, Damir
Dokic was making a scene for the second Grand Slam in a row. At
Wimbledon, he went on a tirade as he made his way through the
pristine grounds, ending his out-of-control behavior by smashing
the cell phone of a reporter before security led him away.
</P>
<P>
   It was uncertain what triggered that outburst. This time, it was
the price of salmon. Apparently outraged at the cost of the lunch
in the players' cafeteria, Dokic went off on a shouting binge until
security officers hustled him away. His daughter was the teary-eyed
witness to it all.
</P>
<P>
   ``To be honest, I feel sorry for her,'' a fellow Aussie, Mark
Philippoussis, said. ``She should be enjoying herself. When I
played mixed doubles with her at Hopman Cup, she didn't look like a
happy 16-year-old girl. She's not. She's not smiling out there.''
</P>
<P>
   The vision of Jelena Dokic provided a dose of reality to an
otherwise lighthearted day. Although the wild-card entrant Mardy
Fish, a personable 18-year-old from Vero Beach, Fla., could not
fight off the popular Jan-Michael Gambill in the fifth set, his
growing cult following was pleased with his effort. In the stands,
the Fish Heads, as his fans are known, were cheering.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the beginning I tried to get the crowd on my side because I
knew I would need them if it went long,'' said Fish, who could hear
the crowd chanting his name. ``It helped a lot. I had my mom, my
sister and my dad here.''
</P>
<P>
   There is such a thing as a normal player's family. But there are
certain parents who stand out. Damir Dokic is one of them. And the
father of Venus and Serena Williams, Richard, is another. But even
though the eccentric Richard Williams has been an attention-grabber
at times _ making outrageous statements and waving signs in the
friends box _ his daughters don't show any side effects from his
behavior.
</P>
<P>
   Venus Williams was proof of that Wednesday. She didn't need
anyone to defend her against McEnroe's opinions; she had her own
thoughts as to whether McEnroe or a male college player could beat
her.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you're playing a college player, they just aren't as
smart,'' Williams said. ``They don't understand what it is to be at
30-all, 40-all in a big situation. They don't understand these
things. So therefore. ... Well, I've played a lot of guys that were
stronger than me, and I was smarter.
</P>
<P>
   ``But this is not important. I have a career, and it's very
successful.''
</P>
<P>
   She had a point. Williams is on the kind of streak many,
including McEnroe, might envy.
</P>
<P>
   ``Martina Navratilova went a year and she lost only one match,''
Williams said when asked if a Tiger Woods-type roll was possible.
</P>
<P>
   ``When Monica Seles was out in the early '90s, she had all types
of winning streaks. And Steffi won four Grand Slams in one year,
plus the Olympics,'' she said, referring to Steffi Graf.
</P>
<P>
   For now, Williams will stick to those goals, and leave the
struggling men's tour on its own. ``I'm a lady,'' Williams said.
``I don't want to play with the men's tour. The ladies' tour is
where it's good to be at right now. I want to be right here.''
</P>
<P>
   Good comeback.

OFF-DUTY OFFICERS BALK AT DRIVING TAXIS
</HEADLINE>
 By ELISSA GOOTMAN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ In an effort to build the ranks of taxi drivers, the
city's Taxi and Limousine Commission is considering a proposal to
encourage police officers to moonlight behind the wheels of yellow
cabs, but the plan is being greeted coldly by police officers.
</P>
<P>
   Under the proposal, officers would be able to waive an 80-hour
training course and a drug test that taxi drivers must take.
Officials with the commission, which is scheduled to discuss the
plan on Sept. 28, say the taxi industry proposed it as a way to
deal with a driver shortage. The officials said police officers
were an obvious choice, because they had completed driver training
courses and were randomly tested for drug use.
</P>
<P>
   But though many officers do hold down second jobs, many note
that they already spend their days dealing with the public and
patrolling the streets.
</P>
<P>
   ``It just doesn't appeal to me,'' said Rick Lee, the community
affairs officer in Lower Manhattan. ``I think there should be other
ways we should be compensated. We should maybe make a little better
salary.'' He called the plan insulting.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's kind of saying, `Well, it might be all you're good
for,''' Lee said.
</P>
<P>
   The taxi owners realize officers may not be interested, but they
thought it was worth a try, said Diane McGrath-McKechnie, the
chairwoman of the commission. ``The economy is very, very strong
right now, and they're having more difficulty than usual in
recruiting drivers.''
</P>
<P>
   She estimated that at any given time, 8 to 10 percent of the
city's more than 12,000 medallions were unused, primarily because
of the driver shortage.
</P>
<P>
   The shortage is so acute, said the spokeswoman for the
Metropolitan Taxicab Board of Trade, Maureen Connelly, that some
fleet operators are willing to lease taxis for shorter periods than
the standard 12-hour shift.
</P>
<P>
   But officers say they were all too familiar with the woes and
perils of cabby life, and do not want to be a part of it.
</P>
<P>
   ``People drunk, people not paying, people making a mess in the
back of the cab,'' said Officer Thomas Reilly, 29. ``I've seen a
lot of cabdrivers. I see a lot of the problems they have.''

NELLIE LOVES MAVERICKS' MAKEOVER
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By DWAIN PRICE 
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   DALLAS _ This time of year in North Texas the heat has become so
stifling that even the most ardent sun-worshipper would probably
want to rush to the ocean to catch a breeze.
</P>
<P>
   Not Don Nelson.
</P>
<P>
   Nelson is vacationing in his off-season home in majestic Maui,
Hawaii. While the scenery there is magnificent, to Nelson nothing
is as inspiring as the roster the Mavericks have pieced together
during the off-season.
</P>
<P>
   ``I love Maui, but I can hardly wait for training camp to
start,'' said Nelson, the Mavericks' coach and general manager.
``It's been quite a summer from the draft until now.''
</P>
<P>
   Nelson said the crown jewel of his red-hot summer was Tuesday,
when the Mavericks acquired former All-Star Christian Laettner and
Terry Mills from the Detroit Pistons for Cedric Ceballos, Eric
Murdock, John Wallace and $3 million.
</P>
<P>
   Laettner and Mills will both be backups for center Shawn
Bradley, and they both can play power forward.
</P>
<P>
   Those acquisitions, along with the acquisitions of rookies
Courtney Alexander, Etan Thomas, Donnell Harvey and Eduardo Najera,
and veterans Howard Eisley, Bill Curley and Dana Barros, has Nelson
wishing the Oct. 3 opening of training camp could be pushed up a
month.
</P>
<P>
   From their roster of a season ago, the Mavericks traded away
Erick Strickland, Sean Rooks, Robert Pack, Bruno Sundov and
Ceballos, and decided not to re-sign Damon Jones. But Nelson isn't
fretting.
</P>
<P>
   ``We really like the players we got,'' Nelson said. ``The
players we lost, we feel we can work around their departure, so
we're as excited as heck.''
</P>
<P>
   Nelson also is exciting about going into his first full season
with Mark Cuban as the Mavericks' owner. Cuban obtained official
control of the Mavericks from Ross Perot Jr. late last season, and
has pledged to turn the team's fortunes around .
</P>
<P>
   Cuban said money would be no object. As an example, the NBA
allows a team to toss in a maximum of $3 million to complete a
deal, if such a transaction is needed. NBA owners normally don't
toss in $3 million to complete deals, but Cuban didn't bat an eye
while using this strategy three times over the summer.
</P>
<P>
   ``My whole career I coached and was a general manager for
conservative guys, and I'm used to that,'' Nelson said. ``I'm used
to pinching pennies, but that has changed and it's fun.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm like a kid in a candy store. I'm like a hobo on a ham
sandwich.''
</P>
<P>
   Cuban pulled a surprise in May when he signed Nelson to an
11-year, $22 million deal. Nelson will be the Mavericks' coach and
general manager for the next three seasons, work solely as the GM
from 2003-'06, and be a team consultant from 2006-'11.
</P>
<P>
   It's a deal that stunned even Nelson, who had planned to retire
after last season.
</P>
<P>
   Cuban's bold style has rejuvenated the 60-year-old Nelson and
allowed him to consummate deals without money being a shield.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mark has done a fantastic job,'' Nelson said. ``He has put his
money where his mouth is.''
</P>
<P>
   For Cuban, shaping the Mavericks into what appears to be their
most competitive team since the 1989-'90 season has been as much
fun as the $1.5 billion he collected from helping build
Broadcast.com into an Internet phenomenon.
</P>
<P>
   ``I love this team and what we can do,'' Cuban said. ``This will
be my first (training) camp, so naturally I'm excited to see how
all the pieces play out and see what I can do to make the
environment better for winning.''
</P>
<P>
   As far as Nelson is concerned, Cuban has gone above and beyond
what he could ask any owner to do.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's done what he said he was going to do,'' Nelson said.
``And we were able to make a lot more deals because of that
philosophy.'' nn

INDONESIA WAITS TO SEE IF SUHARTO WILL ATTEND HIS OWN TRIAL
</HEADLINE>
 (EDS: SUBS with trial begining, rewriting throughout.) 
By MARK LANDLER  
c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   JAKARTA, Indonesia _ The corruption trial of Indonesia's fallen
leader, Suharto, got under way on Thursday morning in the converted
auditorium of a government ministry that was crowded with
spectators and ringed by police, but missing one man: the accused.
</P>
<P>
   Moments before Suharto was scheduled to appear before the court
to answer charges that he siphoned hundreds of millions of dollars
for his own use through charitable organizations under his control,
lawyers for the 79-year-old former president said he was too ill to
attend the hearing.
</P>
<P>
   Suharto's chief lawyer, Juan-Felix Tampubolon, told the judge
that his client had been examined by a team of 23 doctors at his
residence in central Jakarta early this morning. The doctors
concluded that Suharto was ``very ill'' and could not attend the
hearing, Tampubolon said. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Guessing whether Suharto would show up had become a sort of
parlor game here in recent days, as demonstrators have marched,
prosecutors have made tough statements and newspapers have mused
about his state of mind. Few people were surprised that he pleaded
illness.
</P>
<P>
   Even after the tumultuous changes that followed Suharto's ouster
in May 1998, people here are skeptical that their stunted legal
system can take on a strongman who ruled this country for 32 years,
amassing a vast fortune made Indonesia synonymous with corruption.
</P>
<P>
   The mood in Jakarta turned tense in the hours before Suharto was
scheduled to appear. Late Wednesday, a small bomb exploded in an
empty bus parked near the building where the trial is set to take
place. There were no injuries, but the bus was destroyed.
Authorities had moved the trial from the South Jakarta District
Court to the Department of Agriculture for security reasons, and to
accommodate a large crowd.
</P>
<P>
   The stakes go beyond Suharto's future. Legal experts and
political analysts said that unless the government successfully
prosecutes the former president, Indonesia will never cleanse
itself of a legacy of corruption that ranges from financial
scandals to military massacres.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have to make an example of Suharto,'' said Umar Juoro, a
former adviser to Suharto's successor, B.J. Habibie. ``Bring him
into the court, charge him, convict him, and then pardon him if
necessary. But we must demonstrate that everybody is the same
before the law.''
</P>
<P>
   The case against Suharto was dealt its first setback under
former President Habibie, when his government dropped its
investigation of him last October, saying it could not turn up
enough evidence. That decision drew howls of protest from people,
and it contributed to Habibie's ignominious withdrawal from the
presidential election held later that month.
</P>
<P>
   Habibie's successor, President Abdurrahman Wahid, swiftly
reopened the case. And his prosecutors have steadily tightened the
noose around Suharto _ placing him under city arrest in April,
house arrest in May, and formally charging him with corruption this
month.
</P>
<P>
   Wahid has promised to pardon Suharto _ but only after he is
judged. The president has also suggested that Suharto could strike
a deal by returning money stolen from the state. One of Wahid's
senior advisers, Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono, began negotiations with
members of the Suharto family. But he said on Thursday that those
talks had been suspended.
</P>
<P>
   Suharto and his family are accused of building a
multibillion-dollar fortune by siphoning state money and steering
contracts to family-owned firms. But Gen. Marsuki Darusman,
Indonesia's attorney general, has focused on a narrower set of
allegations involving seven tax-free foundations under Suharto's
control.
</P>
<P>
   He is accused of funneling at least $150 million through the
foundations into personal accounts.
</P>
<P>
   Suharto's trial is so important because it comes at a time when
the struggle for Indonesia's future has shifted from the streets
into the courtroom. His case is one of nearly a dozen
investigations and prosecutions of people who were officials,
cronies, or tycoons in the Suharto era.

THE AD CAMPAIGN: DEMOCRATS CONJURE SPECTER OF GINGRICH 
</HEADLINE>
  By SARAH KERSHAW   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   This is a new 30-second commercial, called ``Stand,'' which the
New York State Democratic Party began broadcasting Tuesday night.
</P>
<P>
   PRODUCER: David Axelrod.
</P>
<P>
   ON THE SCREEN: The advertisement takes a ``man on the street''
approach, a departure from the previous commercials for the Senate
campaign. It opens with a close-up of a woman as the off-camera
narrator asks, ``Excuse me, did you know that for four years Rick
Lazio was deputy whip to Newt Gingrich in Congress?'' The woman
looks stunned and says she did not know. The announcer goes on to
make a series of statements about Lazio's record, as phrases like
``$270 billion in Medicare cuts'' scroll across the screen. The
camera cuts quickly from one wholesome-looking person to another,
each of them looking surprised and saying things like, ``Oh, my
goodness,'' as they hear about Lazio.
</P>
<P>
   THE SCRIPT: ``Excuse me, did you know that for four years, Rick
Lazio was deputy whip to Newt Gingrich in Congress?''
</P>
<P>
   ``No, I didn't know that.''
</P>
<P>
   ``This does surprise me.''
</P>
<P>
   ``And that he helped write and pass the Gingrich budget, with
two hundred and seventy billion in Medicare cuts?''
</P>
<P>
   ``I find that rather disappointing, yes.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought he was more pro-health care.''
</P>
<P>
   ``And that Lazio followed Gingrich's lead and voted for the
largest education cuts in history?''
</P>
<P>
   ``Oh my goodness, I didn't know that.''
</P>
<P>
   ``That's not good.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Tell Lazio to stop playing both sides.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Who knew?''
</P>
<P>
   ACCURACY: The narrator sounds as if he is revealing deep, dark
secrets about Lazio: his votes to reduce Medicare spending and to
make the largest national education spending cut in history. But
the Clinton campaign has attacked Lazio on Medicare and education
spending in its commercials before, based on the same two votes.
Lazio voted to cut the rate of growth in Medicare spending, not the
Medicare budget, as his campaign reiterated Wednesday. The cut in
education spending, the Lazio campaign insisted, was smaller than
one proposed by President Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   SCORECARD: The Democrats seem to think that reminding voters of
Lazio's link to Newt Gingrich may be an effective move, although
the Clinton campaign tried and abandoned that tactic weeks ago.
What is most notable about the commercial is the absence of
slickness and the use of ordinary people reacting to Lazio's
record. The ad is financed with so-called soft money _ unregulated
contributions that legally cannot be spent to promote individual
candidates. Employing a loophole now widely used by both major
parties, the Democrats use a script that attacks Lazio but never
explicitly refers to the Senate race.

   (UNDATED) - One last (beginitalic)Survivor(enditalic)
observation, if you'll permit it.
</P>
<P>
   I've heard from a lot of people since Rich walked off naked,
(less) fat and happy with $1million, either by phone, e-mail or the
radio and online talk shows I've sat in on. And the astonishing
thing is this:
</P>
<P>
   Almost no one admits to watching the show.
</P>
<P>
   Now come on. Nearly 52 million people tuned in for the two-hour
finale. What gives?
</P>
<P>
   At first, this perplexed me, but then I remembered a
conversation with my predecessor in this job. Should I worry, I
asked shortly after taking over, that whenever I tell people I'm a
TV critic, they stick their nose in the air and huff, ``I don't
watch TV?''
</P>
<P>
   ``No,'' he said. And why not?
</P>
<P>
   ``They're lying.''
</P>
<P>
   I suspect something similar here. (beginitalic)You're(enditalic)
not lying, of course. All those other people are. And to them I
say: You have nothing to be ashamed of. Don't fear reality TV.
Respect it. Admitting that you watch is the first step toward a
cure.
</P>
<P>
   Now don't you feel better?
</P>
<P>
   OK, I lied. That wasn't the last (beginitalic)Survivor
(enditalic)bit. Just so you can feel secure in knowing that the
castaways are working hard to extend their window of fame, know
that Rich is going to be a presenter at the MTV Video Music Awards
next Thursday. Rich, Sue, Gervase and Jenna will appear on special
editions of (beginitalic)Hollywood Squares(enditalic). And don't
feel bad for Kelly. She hosted (beginitalic)Talk Soup (enditalic)on
Monday.
</P>
<P>
   If you're a (beginitalic)West Wing (enditalic)fan, you've got to
like reading the Emmy tea leaves. The oft-nominated NBC rookie show
won four technical awards at the Creative Arts Emmys, held
Saturday. Other notable winners: Bruce Willis for Best Guest Actor
in a comedy for his role in (beginitalic)Friends(enditalic), Jean
Smart for Best Guest Actress for her (beginitalic)Frasier
(enditalic)stint; and in drama, James Whitmore for Best Guest Actor
and Beah Richards for Best Guest Actress, both for (beginitalic)The
Practice(enditalic).
</P>
<P>
   But nothing makes me happier than this: (beginitalic)Freaks and
Geeks (enditalic)won for outstanding casting for a comedy. Sure,
it's as obscure an award as you can get. But the late great show
left high and dry by NBC deserves all the good things it gets.
</P>
<P>
   The big Emmys will be given out Sept. 10.

NEW JERSEY AND PENTAGON SIGN CLEANUP AGREEMENT
</HEADLINE>
 By RONALD SMOTHERS   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Department of Defense officials and New Jersey environmental
regulators have signed an accord in which the Pentagon agreed to
finance the cleanup of 550 contaminated sites on former military
bases around the state.
</P>
<P>
   The signing came two years after the two parties agreed in
principle to such a plan and after surveys to identify the sites on
29 former and current Army, Navy and Air Force bases, said Robert
C. Shinn Jr., commissioner of the state's Department of
Environmental Protection.
</P>
<P>
   The agreement gives state officials a role in setting priorities
for which sites are cleaned up as Defense Department funds become
available. Shinn said the total cost of the cleanup, for which
there is no firm timetable, is expected to be $350 million.
</P>
<P>
   New Jersey became only the second state to enter into such an
arrangement with the military, which began shrinking its forces and
facilities after the Cold War ended. Pennsylvania signed a similar
agreement in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   ``The whole thrust of this agreement is to have a joint priority
list and really focus on cleanup,'' Shinn said. ``They are saying
that they are responsible for the costs of the cleanups, and they
want to get budget allocations for projects that they can actually
complete without problems at the state level.''
</P>
<P>
   Sherri W. Goodman, deputy under secretary of defense for
environmental security, said that New Jersey and any other states
that sign agreements will ``benefit from having a known plan for
addressing future assessments and cleanups.''
</P>
<P>
   The key cleanup sites, Shinn said, include a missile silo at
McGuire Air Force Base where a 1960 fire caused plutonium
contamination. Since then, the site has been sealed in reinforced
concrete. Another site is a Fort Dix bombing range, on the fringes
of the Pinelands in the center of the state, where there is a risk
of dummy bombs leaching lead into ground water.
</P>
<P>
   The environmental effort will also allow the state and federal
governments to experiment with cleanup technologies, as they
already have at one Fort Dix site near Pemberton Township. There,
Shinn said, the Army is financing a soil washing program to remove
lead from a target range and planting mustard plants to absorb any
lead residue that remains.
</P>
<P>
   But Shinn observed that the most important feature of the
agreement _ aside from experimental technologies and federal
financing _ was that it would speed up the effort to clean up sites
before extensive environmental damage and threats to health and
safety occur.

CONRAD MARCA-RELLI, COLLAGIST AND PAINTER, IS DEAD AT 87
</HEADLINE>
 By MICHAEL KIMMELMAN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Conrad Marca-Relli, an American artist linked to
Abstract Expressionism and known for making large patchwork
collages of cut pieces of canvas, died Tuesday at his home in
Parma, Italy. He was 87.
</P>
<P>
   In 1967, when the Whitney Museum of American Art organized a
retrospective of Marca-Relli's work, the show's curator, William
Agee, said, ``Marca-Relli's achievement has been to raise collage
to a scale and complexity equal to that of monumental painting.''
</P>
<P>
   John Canaday, reviewing the show in The New York Times,
described the artist's ``success in bringing restlessly energetic
forms into static position without deadening them, his strong
echoes of classical architecture as filtered through the Italian
Renaissance, and his increasing interest in high polish.''
</P>
<P>
   Born in Boston in 1913, Marca-Relli was the son of a journalist
whose assignments abroad allowed the family to spend years in
Europe. Marca-Relli had his first art lessons as a boy in Italy. In
the United States, he attended Cooper Union briefly and then, at
18, struck out on his own. He taught art, worked as an illustrator
for newspapers and magazines and joined the Federal Art Project of
the WPA, through which he met Willem de Kooning, Franz Kline and
John Graham. His acquaintance with them helped familiarize him with
modernism.
</P>
<P>
   After serving in the Army, he had his first solo show in New
York in 1947: surreal dreamscapes with circus themes and allusions
to Italian Renaissance buildings, influenced by the work of Giorgio
de Chirico. He then switched to thickly painted, agitated
abstractions, affected by an exhibition he had seen of the painter
Arshile Gorky. But he was dissatisfied.
</P>
<P>
   He had a breakthrough in Mexico during the summer of 1953, when,
having run out of paint, he started making collages from what was
at hand. Returning to the United States and inspired by de
Kooning's ``Women,'' Marca-Relli began a series of abstract
collages based on human figures. These jigsaw collages consisted of
raw canvas or linen stuck like shingles to a larger canvas and then
painted.
</P>
<P>
   He described his goal as bringing accident and gesture,
qualities of Abstract Expressionism, to the usually methodical
medium of collage. He cut shapes quickly, intuitively. The idea was
not ``speed for its own sake, but to create through free, automatic
action, before conscious thought can censor out creativity,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   During the 1960s he applied the technique to metal and vinyl,
creating works alluding to wings, fuselages and airplanes, and this
activity led him to make sculptures before returning to canvas and
paint. Painting, he said, is ``a continuous attempt at solving
insoluble problems.''
</P>
<P>
   ``You just keep working and you never get it clear to
yourself,'' he added.
</P>
<P>
   Marca-Relli made intense small-scale abstractions and bigger
figurative collages in the '70s, Belle Epoque spoofs in the '80s.
His palette, typically somber, broadened, and for a while he even
experimented with spray paint, but without undoing his essential
European-inflected elegance, which was a virtue to supporters, a
weakness to detractors, who complained occasionally about what one
critic called ``secondhand sumptuousness.''
</P>
<P>
   He was elegant in person, known among friends as a restless,
charming hypochondriac. Writers stressed his fondness for fast
cars. In 1951 he married Anita Gibson, a Peruvian and the daughter
of Percy Gibson, the poet. Over the years they lived in East
Hampton, N.Y., where he became a friend and neighbor of Jackson
Pollock; and also in Wayne, N.J.; Ibiza, Spain; Sarasota, Fla.;
Rome; Paris; and London. The couple moved to Parma four years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Marca-Relli's work was frequently shown and collected. Among
recent exhibitions were a survey last year at the Peggy Guggenheim
Museum in Venice and another this year in Darmstadt, Germany. Last
year he was made an honorary citizen of Italy.
</P>
<P>
   He is survived by his wife. &QL;

EDITORIAL: WAITING FOR JUSTICE IN PERU 
</HEADLINE>
   c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial for Thursday, Aug. 31:
</P>
<P>
   Peru has taken a step in the right direction by revoking the
life sentence that a military tribunal imposed on Lori Berenson
four and a half years ago after a sham trial. Now it must ensure
that the civilian court that will retry the Berenson case observes
the basic standards of justice that the military court ignored.
</P>
<P>
   Berenson was originally charged with helping terrorists of the
Tupac Amaru Revolutionary Movement plan an attack on Peru's
Congress. At her trial she was not allowed to challenge the
prosecution's evidence or cross-examine its witnesses. Neither
could she call witnesses in her own behalf. Now Peru says it has
uncovered new evidence suggesting that Berenson never played a
leadership role in the guerrilla organization, something that might
have been discovered much earlier had she not been denied a fair
trial.
</P>
<P>
   The exact nature of her relationship with Tupac Amaru has yet to
be established. A fair trial could help clarify it. She openly
supports the group's political aims, but claims she was unaware of
its violent methods. A year after her trial, Tupac Amaru guerrillas
invaded the Japanese ambassador's residence in Lima, seizing
hostages.
</P>
<P>
   Like Berenson, thousands of Peruvians arrested in President
Alberto Fujimori's anti-terrorist sweeps of the mid-1990s were
denied due process and subjected to years of harsh imprisonment.
Many of those Peruvians have now been released. Berenson's fate
depends on the outcome of her second trial.
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton administration has been rightly critical of
President Fujimori for rigging his own re-election earlier this
year. By assuring a fair trial for Berenson, he can help make
relations with Washington somewhat less frosty. But until Peru is
again a democracy and its judicial system fully independent, there
can be no return to the traditional cordiality between the two
countries.
